PRESBYTERY OF DUMFRIES, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. ROBERT WALLACE, Minister of St Michael's. 
THE REV. THOMAS T. DUNCAN, D. D. Minister of the New 
Church.  



I. Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, Sc. — Etymologists are somewhat at va- 
riance respecting the origin of the name which this town and 
parish bear. The supposition that appears to me the most pro- 
bable, is that which refers the name to the Gaelic words, " dun," 
a mount, and " phreas," brushwood or furze, — implying a rising 
ground covered with furze. This derivation is supported by the 
fact, that the soil is of that light sandy nature, on which, in its. 
uncultivated state, whins and brushwood generally abound. 

The parish is from six to seven miles in length, from two to 
three in breadth, and contains fourteen square miles and a-half. 
It is bounded on the north-west and north by the parishes of 
Kirkmahoe and Tinwald ; on the north-east by that of Torthor- 
wald ; and on the east and south by the parishes of Mousewald and 
Caerlaverock ; while the river Nith is the boundary on the west, 
separating it from Holywood, Terregles, and Troqueer. 

Topographical Appearances. — The surface of the parish may be 
considered as almost level, if we except the site of the burgh, and 
a low ridge of hills, which, rising near its southern extremity, 
stretches to Caerlaverock, in a direction nearly parallel to the river 
Nith. These hills slope gradually down towards the south-west, 
on the side next the river ; but on the north-east side, they are 
much more abrupt, presenting a bold front and picturesque outline. 
Rather more than a mile from the town, two precipitous ledges of 
rock form the face of the hill, rising perpendicularly to a consider- 
able height. Near the summit of one of these precipices is a sin-

The eastern and south-eastern district of the parish consists of 
the extensive morass, called Lochar Moss, lying along the con- 
fines of Torthorwald and Mousewald. This moss is nearly a 
dead level of from twto three miles in breadth, and ten miles 
m length, stretching from the shore of the Solway Firth into the 
interior of the country. There is a tradition, that thi&amp; liarren 
waste was, at some remote period, covered with wood, and that 
afterwards, it was inundated by the sea, which, upon receding, left 
behmd it the decayed vegetable matter in which the moss origi- 
nated. This tradition has been embodied by the peasantry in the 
following couplet : 

" First a wood, and then a sea, 
" Now a moss, and ever will be." 

And its truth is corroborated by the fact, that the moss rests upon 
a deep stratum of sea-sand, out of which not only are shells and 
other marine deposits frequently dug, but fragments of ancient 
vessels of no very inconsiderable size have been repeatedly dis- 
covered, together with several iron grapples or anchors. Some 
ancient canoes or boats have also been found, and in particular, 
one formed out of the trunk of a large oak, hollowed apparently by 
fire. Between the surface of the moss and the sea-sand immense 
trunks of trees are found. These, which are principally fir, invariably 
lie with their tops towards the north-east from which it would ap- 
pear, that their roots having been previously loosened by the inunda- 
tion of the sea, they had been levelled by the fury of the south-western 
blast. It has been conceived by some, that the River Nith, at some 
early period, flowed through Lochar Moss, entering it from the north- 
east; but this, taking into account the nature of the ground between 
the head of the moss and the present course of the river, seems ex- 
ceedingly doubtful. In the dry summer of 1826, the moss having 
caught fire, burned with great rapidity, advancing in a direction 
contrary to that of the wind ; when several cottages fell a prey to 
the flames before these could be extinguished. 

II. — Civil History. 

Accounts of the Parish. — A manuscript copy of the Statistical 
account of this town and parish, drawn up by the late Reverend 
Dr Burnside for the former Statistical Account, in which work 
it is very much abridged, is preserved in the Society Library here. 

Historical events. — No historical documents exist, whereby we

can determine at what precise period the town of Dumfries was 
founded. From several remains of antiquity, however, we may 
conjecture that it must have been a place of considerable resort 
before the end of the eighth century. earliest historical fact 

which we find authentically recorded, is the erection of a monastery 
for Franciscan friars previous to the middle of the thirteenth cen- 
tury, by Dervorgilla, daughter to Allan, Lord of Galloway, and 
mother of John Baliol, king of Scotland. The base of the mount 
upon which this religious house stood, is washed by the waters of the 
Nith on the north and west. It was in the chapel and cloisters of this 
monastery that the Comynswere slain by Robert the Bruce, aided by 
Roger de Kirkpatrick and James Lindsay, on the 10th of February 
1305. In ] 307, the year after the Prince's coronation, Edward II. ad- 
vanced to Dumfries, and received the homage of several Scottish 
noblemen. The town was burnt by the English previously to the 
year 1448, and again in 1 536. This latter injury was amply revenged 
by the Lord Maxwell, who crossed the border with a small body of 
retainers, entered the town of Penrith, and reduced it to ashes. 
About this period a magnificent castle was erected out of the ruins, 
and almost on the site of the Friary, by the Maxwells, then a very 
powerful family. Previously to this, a strong castle had stood 
near the same spot. This is supposed to have been erected some 
time in the course of the twelfth century. In 1563, Queen Mary 
and her privy council were at Dumfries ratifying a peace with Eng- 
land ; and two years afterwards, the disaffected lords Argyle, Mur- 
ray, and Rothes, having assembled a force in the neighbourhood, 
Mary advanced upon the town with an army of 18,000 men. At 
her approach these nobles fled into England, and Maxwell of Ter- 
regles having incurred her royal displeasure, was glad to make his 
peace by surrendering the castle of Dumfries into the hands of his 
sovereign. The government of this fortress, however, was not with- 
drawn from the family. In 1570 the castle was taken and sacked, 
together with the town, by the English, under the Earl of Essex 
and Lord Scrope. In 1617, James the Sixth, on his return from 
a tour through his ancient kingdom of Scotland, after his accession 
to the English throne, passed through Dumfries, where he was re- 

• It is said that the monastery of Greyfriars was deserted in consequence of its 
having been polhucd by the slaughter of the Red Comyn before the high altar. Cer- 
tain it is, that soon after his death, the people resorted for worship to St Michael's 
chapel, upon the site of which the parish church of St Michael now stands, towards 
the south-east end of the town.

ceivecl with every demonstration of loyalty ; and in return, he pre- 
sented the Incorporated Trades of the burgh with a small silver gun, 
to be awarded from time to time to the best marksman amongst their 
number. From this dae, the annals of the town present nothing 
worthy of record till the year 1706, when the inhabitants displayed 
their opposition to the Union with England by burning the Articles, 
together with the names of the Commissioners, at the market-cross. 
Upon the breaking out of the rebellion, however, in 1715, they 
evinced the greatest loyalty towards the reigning family ; for hear- 
ing that Viscount Kenmore, at the head of a considerable body of 
insurgents, purposed to march upon the town, they so completely 
fortified it by a rampart where it was unprotected by the river, and 
presented so determined and warlike an attitude, that the rebels 
judged it most expedient to alter their line of march. But in 1745, 
a party of Dumfrisians having annoyed the rebel army in its march 
southwards, the town was severely dealt with upon the return of 
those lawless intruders, who, not satisfied with levying the excise, im- 
posed upon the inhabitants a fine of L.2000 Sterling, and 1000 
pairs of shoes. Before, however, more than L. 1 100 of the sum had 
been paid, a false alarm of the approach of the Duke of Cumber- 
land having been given, Prince Charles and his army hastily aban- 
doned the town, carrying with them Provost Corbet, and MrHid- 
dell of Glenriddell, as hostages, to ensure payment of the remain- 
der. 

Eminent Characters.— The Rev. William Veitch, who suffered 
much during the struggles betwixt Presbytery and Episcopacy, and 
of whose hfe an account has been pubhshed by Dr M'Crie, was, for 
some time after the Revolution, minister of Dumfries. His pulpit 
Bible is at present in the possession of a relation who resides here. 

The poet Burns spent the latter part of his life in Dumfries, and 
his ashes rest in the burying-ground attached to St Michael's 
Church. 

Cholera.— In 1832, Dumfries was visited with Indian or spas- 
modic cholera, and experienced its effects with more than ordinary 
severity ; on which account some notice may here be allowed of the 
progress of the disease in this place. 

The first case occurred on the 15th of September, and ter- 
minated fatally in a few hours. Two other similar cases occur- 
red next day, although no personal communication had taken 
place with the individual first attacked. In the course of the en- 
suing week, several others were seized; but still the inhabitants

flattered themselves that the visitation would prove slight. On 
Sunday the •23d, however, the malady broke out so generally m 
the already infected districts of the town, and in the neighbouring 
buroh of Maxwelltown, on the opposite bank of the river, as to 
convince the most sanguine that his hopes were ill founded From 
that day, the disorder spread with increasing rapidity, attacking 
and cai;ying off, not only the intemperate and the needy, but u ti- 
mately many of those whose regular habits and comfortable 
circumstances rendered them apparently less hable to be affected. 
From the limited nature of society, in a provmcial town such as 
Dumfries, the danger appearing to be in the very midst of it, the 
alarm of the inhabitants was great. 

A cholera hospital had been provided; and the accommodations 
were scarcely finished, when its appliances and means were put into 
requisition, under the able and efficient superintendence of Dr 
Grieve, and Mr Charles Bell surgeon. The patients were con- 
veyed thither in palanquins or htters, borne on men's shoulders. 
The hospital was crowded, but was not large enough to hold one- 
eighth part of the sick ; and during the few dreadful days in which 
the disease'raged with such uncontrollable fury, our own medical 
practitioners, although very numerous, were not sufficient for the 
emergency ; so that the Board of Health was forced to call in as- 
sistance from Edinburgh and elsewhere. Almost every one of the 
medical men suffered more or less, either from the effects of ex- 
treme bodily and mental exhaustion, or from the attacks of the 
disease itself. Three of them, indeed, were cut off in the midst 
of their usefulness ; two belonging to this town, much and deeply 
regretted,, and the third, one of those who had been called from 
a distance.  

 To enable the reader more easily to judge of the progress of the disorder, we 
here subjoin an extract from the official report of the Dumfries Board of Health, to 
the Central Board in London.

8 DUMFRIES-SIIIRE. , 

The disease now prevailed in almost every part of the town, 
but raged with the greatest severity in English Street, St Michael 
Street, King Street, Queensberry Street, and the closes leading | 
from the High Street. The practitioner, as he went his rounds, ; 
was often beset by several poor distracted creatures at once, eager- 
ly seizing him by the clothes, and each imploring a preference 
in behalf of some suffering relative. Trade of every description 
was at a stand ; and few shops remained open except those of , 
apothecaries, and of some bakers and grocers ; — other men of | 
business having, for the most part, retired from the scene of dan- 
ger. Partly from this cause, and partly from the want of a suffi- 
cient number of hands to prepare the materials, many who had lost j 
their nearest relations were obliged to dispense with the wearing of ' 
mourning. As no inhabitant of the country would willingly brave the 
influence of the tainted air, the market-day was undistinguished from 
the other days of the week, over all of which a more than sabbatical 
stillness seemed to reign. Many families fled with the utmost pre- , 
cipitation to the country, and the houses in the streets occupied ' 
by the higher ranks were, with few exceptions, shut up. Flight, ; 
however, did not always ensure safety. Many perished by the way, 
or on reaching their destination, far from medical aid and the com-  
forts of home. The g :ntlemen of the Faculty, worn out by incessant  
toil, were forced to ride even the shortest distances, and theirs were , 
the only vehicles to be seen on the streets, with the exception of j 
hearses, which, without the usual formahty of a funeral, hurried 5 
the dead to the " ever yawning and never satisfied grave." : 
As we have just hinted, the deceased, while the pestilence was \ 
at its height, were, for the most part, followed to the place of in- ■ 
terment by none but their immediate relations, and were often j 
conveyed thither without even a single attendant save the driver of , 
the hearse. When, however, a funeral procession was to be form- j 
ed, the mourners, instead of entering the house of the deceased, j 
were in the habit of assembling in the middle of the street a few ■ 
hours after the death was known to have taken place, and of pro- \ 
ceeding to the churchyard in front of the hearse, or on the weather ' 
side of it. Such families as possessed burying-grounds of their own, ; 
made use of them ; but for the rest, two rows of large pits were dug : 
in the more unoccupied part of the cemetery ; and in these the bo- | 
dies were piled one upon another,— every coffin being surrounded  
by a layer of quick-lime. Each pit, when the coffins had reached  
to about two feet from the surface, was filled up with Inne and |

earth ; and, finally, when all the pits had been closed, a fresh 
stratum of about a foot thick was laid over the whole. 

Owincr to the absence of some, and the actual sickness, or 
fear of o°thers, public worship was for some time very scantily at- 
tended; but weekly prayer meetings were held in the estabhsh- 
ed churches, and in the different dissenting chapels, both for 
some time previous to the breaking out of the disease, and dur- 
ing its prevalence. Many private meetings for a similar purpose 
were hkewise constituted at this time, and one or two are still con- 
tinued,— a proof, we trust, that the awful dispensation has produced 
at least some permanent good effect. 

From an early period of the disease, by order of the Board of 
Health, pots of pitch and tar were kept continually burning in the 
streets and closes, which were profusely strewed with lime, in the 
hope of purifying the atmosphere ; but all apparently without any 
good effect. It is worthy of remark, that, up to this date, Dum- 
fries, whether as viewed from within, or looked down upon from any 
of the surrounding heights, appeared enveloped in a thick and im- 
pervious cloud, altogether distinct and different from the smoke, 
and which retained its station in spite of wind and rain. The in- 
habitants experienced a raw damp mist, and an atmosphere of a 
peculiarly depressing nature. 

In this state matters continued till Thursday the 4th of Oc- 
tober, which had been appointed by the kirk-session to be kept as 
a day of humiliation and prayer. That night, a thunder-storm 
burst over the town, the peals being uncommonly long and loud, 
and the lightning vivid. The weather had previously been by no 
means such as to warrant the anticipation of a storm, yet awful and 
unexpected as it was, the most timorous hailed it with joy, as a 
means of dispelling the poison with which the atmosphere was con- 
taminated. From this date the number of cases continued to 
decrease, till, through the mercy of God, the disease entirely dis- 
appeared. 

The total number of cases officially reported, is 837 ; of deaths, 
422; and of recoveries, 415. It is certain, however, that many 
cases were not reported. The last which occurred terminated fa- 
tally on the 27th of November. 

It is remarkable that the proportion of females who were seized 
much exceeded that of males ; and that the greater number, at the 
period of attack, were either menstruating, pregnant, or nursing.

DUMFRIES-SHIUE. 



Chiklrea seemed equally susceptible of the disease with adults, but 
they sooner rallied ; and seemingly their constitutions received less 
detriment. Another circumstance we must not neglect to men- 
tion, is one which, so far as we know, has not been noticed as attending 
cholera in any other place. It is described by Dr Grieve, in his printed 
report, as " a benumbing or tingling sensation, exactly similar to a 
slight galvanic shock, felt on applying the hand to the skin of a cho- 
lera patient, when in the collapsed state, and more particularly when 
the body is bedewed with a cold and clammy sweat, which extends 
from the extremities of the fingers to the elbow, and sometimes even 
to the shoulder. Occasionally the effect was so powerful, as to de- 
prive the arm for a few seconds of sensation and motion. Whether or 
not," continues Dr Grieve, " this peculiarity depends upon some 
extraordinary state of the nervous system, I cannot take upon myself 
to determine. It may not, however, be uninteresting to state, that 
not a single individual afflicted with paralysis, partial or confirmed, 
has been attacked with cholera. The same sensation was experi- 
enced by several of the practitioners of this town." 

Parochial Registers. — These consist of iwenty-five volumes, 
including the proceedings of the kirk-session, the record of which 
commences on the 17th of September 1635. The record of bap- 
tisms commences in 1605, of marriages in 1616, and of burials in 
1617 ; in all of which the entries are regular. 

Antiquities. — The ancient castle belonging to the Comyns 
was romantically situated on a spot which still bears the name of 
Castledykes, overlooking a beautiful bend of the river, at a short dis- 
tance south from the town. It is not known at what period this for- 
tress was erected, and none of its walls are now standing; but notice 
of its existence is taken in the history of the reign of Edward L We 
have mentioned the erection of a monastery at Dumfries. For the 
convenience of the inmates of that rehgious house, its foundress 
caused a bridge to be constructed across the river Nith. This 
bridge is said at one time to have been considered, next to that of 
London, the best in the two kingdoms. It formerly consisted 
of thirteen arches ; but, having undergone various alterations, has 
now only seven left, and is used exclusively by foot-passengers. 
The narrow street which leads from the bridge to the spot where 

 In the accounts of the comptroller of the wardrobe to King Edward I. there is 
a charge for a palisade, granted by Edward for this castle, from the forest of Ingle- 
wood in Cumberland.

the friary formerly stood, is still called the Friars Vermel The 
castle of the Maxwells has already been mentioned. In the year 
1583, a strong building, called the New Wark, was erected, which 
served the double purpose of a fortress and a place of safety, where- 
in the effects of the inhabitants might be secured agamst the law- 
less attacks of the borderers. No vestiges, however, of this build- 
ino-, or of either of the castles, or of the friary, now remain 

''On a slight eminence at the entrance of the town by Enghsh 
Street, may still be traced the foundation of Saint Christopher s 
Chapel, which was built by King Robert Bruce as a place where 
mass might be said for the soul of his father-in-law, Sir Christo- 
pher Seton, who was hanged on the spot by order of Edward i. 
On the left bank of the river, just above the town, is another emi- 
nence, which is designated in the ancient records as the Moat 
Brae, and which still bears that name. This artificial mount, like 
many of a similar description in Galloway, is supposed to have been 
formed and used by the Saxons as a place where their freeholders met 
for the administration of justice; f but, owing partly to the encroach- 
ment of the river, and partly to the spot on which it stood having 
been laid out as pleasure ground, it has entirely lost the peculiar 
features which characterized it as a relic of antiquity. At no great 
distance, is another mound, seemingly of a similar nature, called 
the Kirkland Moat. " In fact," says Chalmers, in his Caledonia, 
« there was a moat hill in every district of North Britain, during 
an age when justice was administered to a coarse people in the open 



air." 



Near Castledykes above-mentioned, is a field called the Kinr/- 
holm ; which name may either have been given it by Bruce after 

" The ancient armorial bearings of the town were a cheveron, with three Jlcurs de 
lis ; but instead of these, St Michael, the tutelary saint of Dumfries, represented with 
wings, a pastoral staff in his hand, and clothed in a friar's dress, treading a serpent 
under his bare feet, has long been used. The motto is " Aloreburn" or " Lore- 
burn," — a word of which the precise import has never been ascertained. It is cer- 
tain, however, that it was the ancient slogan or war-cry of the inhabitants, and is be- 
lieved to be a corruption of the words lower hum, having reference to a small rivu- 
let, the banks of 'which used to be the rendezvous of the inhabitants when they as- 
sembled in arms on the approach of a hostile force. Accordingly, a street in the im- 
mediate neiglibourliood of the original course of the stream in question, bears the 
name of" Lorcburn Street." 

t Moat or Mote signifies jneetivg. Thus, the Saxons termed their national coun- 
cil a Willcnngemote meeting of the wise, and a county court they named a Folkmotc, 
tliat if:, a meeting of the people. The word mote was transferred from the assembly 
to the place where the assembly was held, as in the case of the word Church.

his accession to the throne, or may be a corruption from CumyiCs 
holm, a name which it once bore. 

Toward the south-east end of the parish, is an eminence called 
Trohaughton, which Pennant notices as a Roman station. A relic 
of antiquity, supposed to be a Roman sandal, was found many years 
ago towards the east end of the parish ; and in the river, nearly 
opposite to the town mills, was found a gold coin of about the cir- 
cumference of a sixpence, and the thickness of a half crown, bear- 
ing the inscription " Augustus" round the impression of a Roman 
head. Several Roman and Scottish coins also have at different 
times been discovered in digging the foundations of houses in the 
town. It may be mentioned, that there is still to be seen a small 
part of a deep track of road which led through the castle garden 
to the river, where a causeway was formed, by means of which the 
family at the castle could cross over to their seat at Terregles with- 
out passing through the town. The buildings in Castle Street, 
however, have now almost entirely obliterated it. A curious relic 
of antiquity was some time ago discovered by Mr Affleck, iron- 
founder, while employed in selecting some pieces of old metal to 
throw into the crucible. It is circular, fully two inches in dia- 
meter, and about the thickness of a penny. Upon being struck 
with a hammer a crust of verdigris came off, and on one side of it 
was discovered engraved a lion rampant in the midst of a shield 
bordered with fleur des lis, and surrounded, in reversed characters, 

by the legend 

" Jacobus Dei gra. Rex Scotorum;" 
after which is a figure nearly similar to the letter S, which we 
conclude must have been intended to represent the buckle of the 
belt on which the inscription is engraved. The seal, for such it 
appears to be, is formed of a compound of copper with some other 
metals, and is, with some plausibility, supposed to have been the 
privy seal of one of the kings of Scotland. It is evidently of con- 
siderable antiquity, and closely resembles, on the engraved side, a 
silver groat of the date of James the Fifth. The other side is per- 
fectly smooth, and no traces are discernable of a handle ever hav- 
ing been attached to it. The seal remains in possession of Mr 
Affleck. 

Modern Buildings, -c.—The county town of Dumfries is beau- 
tifully situated on the left bank of the river Nith, in 55° 2' 45" north 
latitude, and 3° 36' west longitude from Greenwich. It is nearly

•X mile in lenotb, cand a qnarter of a mile in breadth. It has long- 
possessed the character of being a clean, well built town, and has 
been improved and considerably enlarged within the last forty years. 
The streets, and most of the public buildings, are well lighted by 
gas which was introduced about five years ago, about which pe- 
riod also a great improvement took place in the appearance and 
fitting up of the shops, which are larger and much handsomer than 
those of most provincial towns. The houses are bmlt of red free- 
stone; such as are of older date being generally white-vashed, and 
many in the modern part of the town painted in imitation of Port- 
land stone. 

There are in Dumfries two parish churches. St Michael s, 
which is furnished with a tall and handsome spire, was built 
in 1745, and stands at the south-east end of the town on the site 
of a place of worship originally Popish, but converted into the 
Protestant parish church after the Reformation. The other 
church, which was not founded till 1724, and is still called the 
New Church, terminates the High Street to the north-west, and 
occupies the site of the old castle of Dumfries, out of the ruins of 
which, materials for its erection were obtained. This church was 
first opened for public worship in 1727. 

St Michael's, or the Old Church, is surrounded by an extensive 
and crowded burying-ground, which contains a vast number and 
variety of monuments, some of them very ancient. We mentioned 
above that in this cemetery are deposited the remains of our na- 
tional poet Burns. They were originally interred in the north corner 
of the churchyard, upon which spot a simple table-stone was raised to 
his memory; but in 1815 his ashes were removed to a vault beneath 
an elegant mausoleum, which was erected by subscription as a tribute 
to his genius, at a cost of L. 1450. This monument contains a hand- 
some piece of marble sculpture, executed by TurnerelU, representing 
the genius of Scotland finding the poet at the plough, and throwing 
" her inspiring mantle" over him. This burying-ground also con- 
tains all that could die of three witnesses for the truth, who seal- 
ed their testimony with their blood during the merciless persecu- 
tions by which the house of Stewart vainly endeavoured to con- 
taminate the purity of our Presbyterian faith and worship. The 
graves are marked by plain slabs of freestone, with rude inscrip- 

 Measures are now 1833 in progress for supplying the town, by means of pipes, 
with good spring water.

tionsj but a more suitable monument is about to be erected on 
the spot, as a proof how highly their grateful countrymen respect 
the memory of the martyrs in the southern district of Scotland. 
Mr M'Diarmid, the editor of the Dumfries and Galloway Courier, 
and author of the " Sketches from Nature," calculates, in the 
latter of these works, that the value of the monuments in St 
Michael's church-yard, now in a state of preservation, cannot 
come far short of L. 100,000. Of the first class of monuments, 
there are 109; of tombstones on pillars, 712; besides about 1000 
other memorials of the departed, more or less dilapidated. 

In 1780, the county gentlemen erected a handsome Doric column, 
to commemorate the virtues of Charles Duke of Queensberry ; this 
monument stands in Queensberry Square, an open space near the 
centre of the town. Not far from this, and awkwardly placed in the 
middle of the High Street, is the Mid Steeple, the work of the famous 
architect, Inigo Jones. In this structure are the chambers where the 
Town- Council hold their meetings. Opposite to it, on the east side of 
the street, is the Trades' Hall, an unpretending, but chaste build- 
ing, erected in 1804, for the public meetings of the seven incorpo- 
rated trades, to be noticed below. The Court-house is an elegant 
and commodious structure, wherein the circuit and sheriff-courts, 
the quarter sessions and the county meetings are held. Opposite 
to this stands a heavy-looking building, which was at first intended 
for a court-house, but is now converted into a Bridewell, the in- 
terior of which is arranged on the same plan with that of Edin- 
burgh, but on so small a scale, that it is thought, from the faci- 
lity with which the prisoners can hold intercourse with one an- 
other, to be very ill adapted for a place of confinement. Behind 
this, in a low damp yard, and surrounded by a high wall, is 
situated the county Jail, which, along with the Bridewell, was built 
in 1807. Previously to that period, the jail was in the centre of 
the town. A vaulted passage under the street, forms a communi- 
cation between the prison-yard and the court-house. The debtors 
have the liberty of exercising themselves within the enclosed yard. 
A very handsome suite of Assembly-rooms was lately erected in 
George Street. 

There are in Dumfries two meeting-houses belonging to the unit- 
ed Secession Church; a Cameronian, a Relief, an Independent, 
and a Methodist Meeting-house ; an Episcopalian Chapel, a Ro- 
man Catholic Chapel, and a Theatre. The Cameronian, and one

of the Secession Meeting-houses, are new and handsome speci- 
mens of ai'chitectm'e. 

The Academy is a fine roomy structure, in a dry and healthy si- 
tuation. There are also a Poor's-house, and an Infirmary; which 
latter building stands on an airy locahty, at the south east extremity 
of the town, the right wing being used as a lunatic asylum. This 
institution has proved a great blessing to the whole south of Scot- 
land. 

There are branches of the following banks in Dumfries,— viz. 
the British Linen Company, the Bank of Scotland, the National, 
and the Commercial Banks. For the latter of these, a costly and 
classical structure has lately been erected. A house which was 
originally intended for a Bridewell, has long been employed as a 
depot for the arms and accoutrements of the county mihtia. There 
are three water-mills belonging to the town, but these stand on the 
opposite side of the river, in the parish of Troqueer. A little 
above the old bridge, already noticed, stands the new bridge, erect- 
ed in 1794, and which, though more substantial than elegant, is 
not destitute of beauty. 

III. — Population. 

According to the Government Census, the population of the parish in 1811 was, 9,262 
In 1821, . . . . • 11,052 

In 1831, ... . . 11,606 

In 1831, the number of males was 5206; of females, 6400. 
The number of the population residing in the town of Dumfries is 
8432; in villages, and in the country, 3174. The yearly average 
of births for the last seven years is, as near as can be learnt, about 
260 ; of marriages, 81 ; of deaths, 229. 

The number of inhabited houses is 1512 ; of unfinished houses, 
6. The number of lunatics in the parish is 7 ; of idiots, 15 ; of 
deaf and dumb, 4 ; of blind, 9. The number of families in the 
parish is 2599 ; whereof 248 are chiefly employed in agriculture ; 
and 1170 in trade, manufactures, and handicraft. 

Landed Proprietors. — There are eighty-one heritors in the pa- 
rish, most, if not all of whom, possess land of the yearly vahie 
of L. 50 at least ; thirty-five of these possess estates without the 
burgh roods, and therefore have a voice in the parochial meetings of 
heritors ; but the other forty-six, whose property lies within the 
burgh roods, are represented by the magistrates and town-council.

Language Customs, Sj-c. — The language universally spoken by 
the lower ranks is the lowland Scotch, which has, however, with- 
in the last forty years, lost much of its national peculiarity, — many 
words which were then used having now become obsolete. 

We have already mentioned the " siller gun." This royal gift 
is competed for at least once in seven years, and oftener if the 
trades think fit. Upon such occasions, every member of the in- 
corporations is bound under a penalty to appear armed with a 
firelock, and to answer to his name. This done, the whole march 
in due form to some convenient open ground in the neighbourhood, 
and there contend for the prize by shooting in rotation at a target. 
The successful marksman returns to the town in front of the pro- 
cession, bearing attached to his hat, and adorned with ribbons, the 
piece of ordnance, of which he is the nominal custodier until the 
next trial of skill takes place. 

There are annual races on Tinwald Downs in the month 
of September, at which period assemblies are held in the town. 
The theatre is generally open for two or three months in the 
year. 

The people have of late made considerable advances in cleanH- 
ness; and the practice of going barefoot, formerly so common 
throughout Scotland, is here fast losing ground. The standard 
articles of food ainongst the lower orders are potatoes, porridge, oat- 
cakes, and milk; salt herrings are also very much used. Al- 
though a great deal of poverty exists in the obscure parts of the 
town, the inhabitants in general seem to enjoy in a very considerable 
degree the comforts and advantages of society, and are contented 
with their situation and circumstances. 

Character of the people.— The people are generally intelligent, 
and although there are many amongst the labouring classes who 
can neither read nor write, yet these are, in but a very few in- 
stances, natives of Scotland. Living in a district where no manu- 
factures are carried on upon an extensive scale, the inhabitants 
have not amongst them those exciting motives to discontent and 
insubordination which exist more or less in all manufacturing 
towns. They possess the character of being decent in then- exter- 
nal deportment, and respectful to their superiors. Poaching, how- 
ever, both in game and in the salmon fisheries, prevails to a con- 
siderable extent.

Bent of Land. — The average rent of arable land is from thirty 
to forty shillings per acre ; except in the immediate neighbourhood 
of the town, where it is from L. 4 to L. 6. The average rent of 
grazing for a cow is about L. 4. No sheep are put out to graze in 
that way. The total estimated rental of the burgh and burgh 
roods is L. 21,000, and that of the landward part of the parish is 
L. 8810, — making the rental of the whole parish about L. 29,810. 

Rate of Wages, Sfc. — The rate of labour, winter and summer, 
for farm labourers and country artisans, is Is. 6d. per day. The 
daily hire of a mason, carpenter, and other mechanical workmen 
in the country, is 2s. with victuals ; 2s. 6d. without. In town the 
rate is from 2s. to 2s. 6d. per day. A joiner or cabinet-maker's 
weekly wages average about 15s. An iron plough costs from 
L. 3, to L. 3, 10s. A full mounted cart, L. 8. 

Breeds of Live Stock. — Very few sheep are bred in the parish. 
The only cattle bred and reared are of the pure Galloway kind ; 
which, owing to the attention of late bestowed upon the breeding 
of them, has very much improved. Almost as many Ayrshire as 
Galloway cows are kept for milk; but none of the former are rear- 
ed in the parish. 

Husbandry. — The principal part of the arable land is managed 
under what is technically termed a ve or six year's shift, viz. in the 
first year oats ; in the second, turnips or potatoes ; in the third, 
wheat or barley; in the fourth, generally hay; and in the fifth and 
sixth, pasture. Within the last forty years, about 250 acres have 
been reclaimed from Lochar Moss, which have amply repaid the 
outlay, yielding abundant crops of oats, potatoes, and rye-grass 
hay. Much more might be brought into cultivation if sufficient 
encouragement were given by proprietors, such, for instance, as a 
general drainage of the river Lochar. We may here mention that 
It has been more than once proposed to carry a canal from the 
Lochar Bridge Quarry to the sea, a distance of about twelve miles, 
in which there is a fall of thirty feet, having a branch to communi-

cate with Dumfries. This, it is considered, would be of immense 
local importance. 

The turnip husbandry is now carried on to the greatest pos- 
sible extent, and is found to be a valuable improvement upon the 
dry sharp sandy soils, of which a large proportion of the arable 
land in this parish consists. Forty years ago it was a rare thing 
to see turnips sown ; but for the last five years, 150 acres have 
been about the average extent of land occupied by that article. 
Almost all the turnip crops are eaten on the ground by sheep. 
About one-half of the quantity of turnips is raised by the aid of 
bone manure, at an expense of from L. 3, 10s. to L. 4, 10s. per 
acre. The general duration of leases is from fifteen to nineteen 
years. These leases are decidedly favourable to the tenants, who 
generally prefer the latter period. 

The farm-buildings, upon the whole, are by no means so com- 
fortable as they should be, owing chiefly to a large proportion of 
the landward part of the parish being entailed property. The 
fences are in a better condition. 

Quarries. — Four red sandstone quarries are worked in this 
parish ; and at an annual expense of about L. 1000. 

Fisheries. — The only fisheries carried on are those of salmon 
and trout ; the rents of which amount to about L. 500 a-year. 

Produce. — The average gross amount and value of raw produce 
raised in the parish may be as follows : 

Produce of grain of aU kinds, whether cultivated for food of man, or the domestic 
anixnals, 12,800 0 0 

Of potatoes, turnips, cabbages, beet, and other plants, cultivated m

Totalyearly value of raw produce raised, - L. 22,186 0 0 

Manufactures.— The only manufactures carried on to any great 
extent in Dumfries are those of hats and stockings. The latter 
of these does not at present yield a very encouraging remunera- 
tion No fewer than 279 frames are employed by the stock- 
ing-weavers in this place. There are three hat-manufactories; 
in which together, nearly 200 workmen are employed. Formerly 
checked cottons were fabricated, but this branch has fallen off; and 
most of the cotton-spinners who remain are m the employ ot 
Cariisle or Glasgow manufacturers. The trade of tannmg is also 



DUMFRIES.

carried on to some extent ; and hides prepared here are disposed 
of in Glasgow, London, and other parts of the United Kingdom. 
There arealso several breweries in Dumfries, and one very exten- 
sive basket-making establishment. The manufacture of clogs, or 
strong shoes with thick wooden soles, the use of which was till late- 
ly confined to the south of Scotland, affords no inconsiderable pro- 
fit to those engaged in it. Large quantities of shoes are also ex- 
ported, and in the manufacture of these articles upwards of 300 in- 
dividuals are employed. The manufactures carried on are not 
sufficiently extensive to produce much effect upon either the health, 
or the morals, of the general population. 

Trade. — Many thousand carcases of pork are sold here dur- 
ing the season, which lasts from the end of December to the begin- 
ning of April, and are sent off to the south to be cured. More than 
700 are sold weekly; and, in some instances, from L. 4000 to 
L. 5000 worth of pork has been disposed of in one day. A butcher- 
market was many years ago prepared, and the stalls were oc- 
cupied ; but it is now entirely deserted, — the " fleshers" finding 
it of greater advantage to disperse themselves over the town. In 
the meal-market, business is transacted under cover. It has been 
for some time in contemplation to build new markets, somewhat 
upon the plan of those in Edinburgh ; but nothing has as yet been 
done towards the accomplishment of this design. 

About eighty years ago, a considerable tobacco trade was car- 
ried on in Dumfries ; but, in consequence of the detection of some 
systematic and successful attempts at smuggling, the traffic in this 
article came to be discouraged. 

The only foreign trade is with America, for timber, in which 
several pretty large vessels are employed. The other vessels are 
coasters, plying to Liverpool, Whitehaven, Maryport, and other 
parts. The imports are, principally coal, slate, iron, tallow, timber, 
hemp, and wine. The annual value of the timber imported can- 
not be less than from L. 8000 to L. 10,000 Sterling. The ex- 
ports are wool, freestone, oats, wheat, and barley. 

Navigation. — The number of vessels of all burdens belonging 
to the port of Dumfries, including the Creek of Annan, amounts 
to 84, the total burden of which is 5783 tons. The number 
of foreign vessels usually trading to this port is from 12 to 18.

at the head of the Solway Firth, to Glenhice, on the coast of Gal- 
loway. The gross amount of Customs collected at the port of 
Dumfries for the year ending 5th January 1832, was L, 5089. 

A steam-boat plies once a-week during the summer months be- 
tween Dumfries and Whitehaven, in connection with one from 
thence to Liverpool ; by which conveyance an immense quantity of 
goods and live stock, particularly sheep, are exported for the English 
market. 

Societies for Encouragement of Industry. — The Dumfries and 
Galloway Horticultural Society, instituted in 1812, and which 
meets periodically in Dumfries, has been of great use in stirring 
up to emulation, industry, and improvement, the gardeners in this 
district, prizes being awarded to those who produce the best and 
rarest articles. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Markets, Sj-c. — Dumfries has long been celebrated for its 
markets, which are held every Wednesday; when a great deal of 
business is done among the cattle-dealers upon the " Sands," an 
open space by the river side, set apart for the purpose ; but, be- 
sides these, there are four great annual fairs, viz. one at Whitsun- 
day and another at Martinmas, when an immense number of black- 
cattle are sold; and the other two for horses, in October and Fe- 
bruary. The greatest annual cattle-market held on Dumfries 
Sands, is that preceding and corresponding with Brough-hill Fair 
in Cumberland, and usually takes place in the last week of Sep- 
tember. On each of two occasions, during the last five years, 
viz. in 1829 and 1830, there have been about 6000 head of cattle 
exposed, — the majority being aged, or three-year old Galloways 
and Highlanders ; and on each of these occasions business has 
been done to an amount exceeding L. 30,000. The numbers 
usually exposed for sale on that day, however, during the last 
dozen years, amount to from 3500 to 4500 yearly; and for six 
weeks about this period, an amount of cattle, varying from 1500 
to 2000, are generally exposed on the Sands of Dumfries. Fully 
one-half of these are drove or heavy cattle. But the business 
done in the public market gives but an inadequate idea of the 
magnitude of the trade in general; for an immense variety of 
transactions are effected by the dealers privately throughout Dum- 
fries-shire and Galloway ; and in a period of ten days, during the 
droving season, more than 20,000 head of cattle have been known to

pay toll on the English road, and not one of which had been exposed 
in the market. Added to the business done in heavy cattle, a very 
important and bustling trade is carried on by the farmers, graziers 
and iobbers,-disposing, on the one hand, of young cattle, which 
have been grazed or fed on fodder a certain period ; and, on the 
other, purchasing cattle a stage younger, which are grazed in their 
turn; the difference between the original cost and that which is 
received at the sale constituting the profit, or sum mtended tor the 

expenses of keep. 

Of the horse-market, it is impossible to speak with any thing 
like accuracy. There, again, an immense part of the business is 
transacted privately ; and at the fairs of Candlemas and Roodsmass, 
the number of all kinds exposed may perhaps vary from 400 to 600. 
A portion of the best draught horses are retained for service in 
the district in which they have been reared ; and the surplus car- 
ried by the dealers to Edinburgh, Glasgow,— the west country ge- 
nerally, and to the north of England. 

At the fair in February, an incredible quantity of hare-skins is 
purchased. The average number cannot be under 30,000 ; and 
one year, no less a sum than L. 6000 is said to have been paid for 
that one article. 

Burgh.— Bnmiries is a royal burgh, and is entitled to one of 
five votes for a member of Parliament. The tradesmen are divided 
into seven incorporations, from each of which a deacon is annually 
elected ; and of the seven deacons thus elected, one is chosen conve- 
ner, to assemble and preside over the whole craft, which is composed 
of, 1st, the hammermen, consisting of blacksmiths, whitesmiths, tin- 
smiths, coppersmiths, and saddlers, making in all 100 freemen ; 
2d, the squaremen, 100 in number, and including joiners, cabinet- 
makers, masons, glaziers, coopers, and slaters; 3/, weavers, amount- 
ing to 30 ; 4:th, tailors, also amounting to 30 ; 5th, shoemakers, 
numbering 100; 6th, skinners; and 7th, butchers; both of which 
last incorporations are of small numerical strength. The town- 
council consists of a provost, three bailies, a dean of guild, a trea- 
surer, twelve merchant councillors, and the convener of the seven in- 
corporated trades, together with the six remaining deacons, making 
in all twenty-five members. There are six wards of police, 
and two commissioners for each ward are elected annually in 
.Tune, by renters of L. 10 each. The provost, the three baihes, 
and the convener of the incorporations are commissioners ex officio. 
As the capital of the county, Dumfries is the scat of the sheriff 
and commissary courts. The quarter-sessions, the commissioners

of supply, and the freeholders assemble in this town ; and here 
also the Justiciary and Jury courts sit during the spring and autumn 
circuits. Dumfries is, besides, the seat of a presbytery and a pro -

Dumfries, was, for the year 1832, about L. 2500, after deductions 
for salaries, &amp;c. &amp;c. 

There are three turnpike roads, each of which, from its com- 
mencement at Dumfries, to the boundary of the parish, measures 
about three miles. The London, Edinburgh, and Portpatrick 
mail-coaches, daily arrive in and leave Dumfries ; and there are 
besides, coaches to Edinburgh, Glasgow, and London, and carriers 
to those places twice a-week. Owing to the channel of the river 
having lately been deepened, vessels of considerable burthen can 
discharge their cargoes close to the town, and by this means the 
inhabitants have their coals transported by water from Whitehaven 
almost to their very doors. There is also a quay at the bend of 
the river near Castledykes; one for vessels of greater burthen 
about a mile and a-half further down ; and another near the mouth 
of the river for foreign vessels, and such as draw too much water 
to approach nearer to the town. 

The sums expended on the improvement and repairs of the har- 
bour, and the deepening of the river since the act of Parliament 
was passed for the purpose, amount to L. 18,530, 9s. lid. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The clergyman of each of the two churelies 
before noticed has a distinct district allotted to him as the scene of 
his labours. The landward district, and a part of the town, is under 
the minister of St Michael's, and the remainder of the town is under 
the care of the minister of the New Church. The officiating elders, 
and the clergymen of both churches, constitute a joint session. The 
churches are both very well situated for the convenience of the po- 
pulation. The Old church is now in a good state of repair, and 
accommodates 1250 sitters. For the New church, much may yet 
be done to promote the comfort and convenience of the congrega- 
tion. It is seated for 1200. There are no free sittings in either 
of the churches; 1000 families attend the two established churches; 
and the number of communicants at both is about 1500. The 
manse is a building of the last century ; but underwent a very tho- 
rough repair in the year 1831. 

The extent of the glebe is about seven acres and a-half, exclu- 
sive of the garden attached to the manse, and its yearly value m

There are eight dissenting places of worship in the parish, which 
we have already particularly specified. The stipends of the dissent- 
ing ministers are paid from the seat-rents, and amount to from about 
L.'lOO to L. 130 each ; they have, besides, a free house, and an ad- 
ditional allowance for expense at the time o the communion. 125 
families attend the Relief chapel, of whom 102 live within the pa- 
rish ; 70 families attend the Cameronian chapel, of whom only 12 
live within the parish ; 56 famihes attend the Episcopalian chapel, 
one-third of whom are without the bounds of the parish ; 43 fami- 
hes, all within the parish, attend the Methodist chapel. It is sup- 
posed that the total number of individuals attending the dissenting 
places of worship may be about 700. 

The Roman Catholic chapel derives a large proportion of its 
congregation from the neighbouring burgh of Maxwelltown, a great 
part of the population of which consists of low Irish. The bishop 
resides in Edinburgh. 

Societies fo' Religious purposes.-— Theve ai'e in the parish a 
Bible Society, a Missionary Society, a Bible and Missionary So- 
ciety, a Highland Education Society, a Samaritan Society, for pro- 
moting the temporal and spiritual welfare of the poor. Ladies' and 
a Gentlemen's Liberian Society, for the purpose of promoting the 
interests of the colony of free blacks on the coast of Africa, an As- 
sociation against Infidelity and Radicalism, and a Benevolent So- 
ciety, the object of which we have to notice in the sequel. 

Education. — This parish is well supplied with the means of edu- 
cation, the total number of schools being no less than thirty-nine. 
None of these are parochial, but four of them are endowed schools, 
under the patronage of the magistrates, town-council, and ministers, 
and are united under the name of the Dumfries Academy. The 



24 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



branches taught at the academy are, Greek and Latin, Enghsh, 
mathematics, geography, arithmetic, book-keeping, writing, French, 
and drawing. The salaries of the masters, and the school fees, are as 
follow:— The salary of the master of the grammar-school is the inte- 
rest of L. 660, 6s. 3d., with fees at 7s. 6d. per quarter. The salaries of 
the other masters are, the interest of L.204, 8s. lOd. each, with fees 
at 5s. per quarter, for English reading, geography, arithmetic, and 
writing ; but at 10s. 6d. per quarter for mathematics. The French 
and drawing classes are not endowed, and the teachers have the 
power of fixing the amount of their own fees. Two other schools 
are supported by the Benevolent Society above alluded to ; one of 
these being instituted for the instruction of poor children of both 
sexes in reading, writing, arithmetic, and the principles of religion; 
and the other for teaching girls to sew and read the Bible. The 
teachers have each a house attached to the school-house, and a 
salary, — that of the former being L. 60 per annum, and that of the 
other L. 20, with sixpence a month from each pupil. There are 
also two adult schools, one for males, the other for females. These 
are supported by charitable contributions, and are attended by 
about 200 scholars, chiefly Irish, of whom about eighty are females. 
The remaining thirty-one schools are private undertakings, the 
teachers being supported by the wages only. Of the private 
schools, eleven are taught by females, and twenty by males. They 
are of various grades, from dame schools for infants, to seminaries 
where the higher branches of mathematics and the languages are 
taught. Wages from Is. Id. to 10s. 6d. per quarter. The people 
in general seem fully alive to the benefits of education.  

Literature. — The presbytery of this district has a valuable li- 
brary in Dumfries ; besides which, there are three others belong- 
ing to societies. Of what are called circulating libraries, there are 
four kept by booksellers on speculation, and a select one, open to 
the public. There exists also a Mechanics' Institution, in the hst 
of whose members appear the names of many respectable indivi- 
duals belonging to the town. There are already four public read- 
ing-rooms. Two weekly newspapers are published in Dumfries. 
Other periodical works have been often attempted, but have never 
prospered. 

Charitable and other Institutions. — Poors-Housc. — The Poor's- 
House was erected in 1753, from funds bequeathed by William 
Muirhead, " Merchant Adventurer" in Carlisle, and James Muir- 

" The formation of an Infant School is at present contemplated.

head in Castledykes, "his brother-german," for poor orphans, and 
for aged paupers of both sexes. A master and mistress reside in 
the house, and the children are taught reading, writing, arith- 
metic, and the principles of religion ; after which they are sent to 
service, or apprenticed to tradesmen. The comforts of the aged 
inmates are well cared for; and, besides these, there are forty- 
two widows, who receive pension at their private houses. The af- 
fairs of the institution are under the excellent management of a 
weekly committee of directors, the members of which are selected 
from the kirk session, the town-council, and the inhabitants. The 
funds are derived partly from the interest of mortified money and 
rent of lands, partly from annual subscriptions, and partly from 
donations ; and since its foundation, the Institution has received 
donations, subscriptions, &amp;c. amounting to more than L. 6000. 
The house accommodates, upon an average, about thirty old, and 
twenty young paupers. The annual expenditure is about L. 500. 
Various attempts have been made to introduce some kind of han- 
dicraft into the establishment, but hitherto without much success. 
The girls, however, are taught to sew and to knit, and such of 
the elderly females as are able, employ their time in that way ; 
the strongest of the men are engaged in dressing the garden, which 
is pretty extensive. 

Infirmary and Dispensary. — The Infirmary was opened in the 
outskirts of the town for the benefit of Dumfries-shire and Gal- 
loway, in the year 1776, and is still the only institution of the 
kind in the south of Scotland. As already intimated, a lunatic 
asylum forms part of the institution, which has now obtained a 
royal charter. Its income is derived from land and other invest- 
ments of capital, and from legacies, donations, and subscriptions, in- 
cluding parochial contributions, and liberal annual allowances from 
the counties of Dumfries and Wigton, and the stewartry of Kirkcud- 
bright. This is quite adequate to the expenditure, which may be stated 
at L. 1200 or L. 1300 per annum. The average number of patients 
is about 30; the number treated in the course of a year about 
500 ; the number attended at their own homes about 470. The 
Infirmary dispenses medicines, gratis, to out-patients who do not 
require to be visited. The medical attendants consist of twa 
physicians, two surgeons, and a house-surgeon or clerk. A licen- 
tiate of the estabhshed church regularly officiates as chaplain. A 
weekly committee of management is chosen from among the sub- 
scribers. The donations and bequests to the Infirmary, within the 



26 



DUMFRIES-SHIRK. 



last fifty years, amount together to about L. 18,000. There is 
also a public Dispensary at the west end of the town which, dur- 
ing the year 1831, took under its care 2538 patients, and supplied 
them at the wonderfully trifling cost of L. 30. 

Friendly Societies.— i:\ie friendly societies of this parish are now 
all extinct except one, their rules having been drawn up on false 
principles. The surviving one has for its object the support of 
widows. 

Savings Banks.— K parish bank has existed here ever since the 
beginning of 1815 ; and with the happiest eff"ects, of which striking 
proof has been given in individual cases. The average yearly in- 
vestments amount to L. 3997, 17s. 6d. and the average yearly re- 
payments to L. 3293, 7s. The small sums deposited in the course 
of the year 1831, amounted to no less than L. 4829, 2s. 4d. The 
repayments during the same period, were L. 2816, 7s. 7d. The 
whole stock now accumulated is L.7716, 7s. 7d. The invest- 
ments are chiefly made by labourers, industrious mechanics, and 
servants. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The average number of per- 
sons receiving parochial aid directly from the kirk-session, pre- 
vious to the year 1832, was 560 ; and the average allowance to each 
of these was about 14s. But this does not include the fifty inmates 
nor the forty-two pensioners of the Poor- House, nor ten pensioners 
supported by a fund left by the late Mrs Carruthers of Warman- 
by, for the lame and blind, among whom not less than L. 200 \sall 
be annually distributed by the trustees, under the will of the tes- 
tatrix. Since the commencement of 1832, however, pauperism 
has, owing to the desolations caused in many families by cholera, 
so much increased, that it is impossible to give any accurate ac- 
count, either of the present number of the poor, or of their annual 
average allowances. 

The contributions for their reUef, including L. 205 of collec- 
tions at the churches, donations, fees for proclamation and baptism, 
and the use of the mort-cloth, the interest of legacies, a large vo- 
luntary assessment, subscriptions to the poor-house above-mention- 
ed, rent of land belonging to that institution, and the annual pro- 
ceeds of the Warmanby bequest, besides one or two minor chanties 
not managed by public bodies, can hardly be estimated at less than 
L 1 500 per annum. In former times, the poor were supported without 
the aid of extraordinary contributions from the heritors. T-thlrds 
of the session's funds were placed at the disposal of the direcloi- 



s 



DUMFRIES. 



27 



of the poor's-house, who undertook to provide for the whole poor 
resident in the town, while the session, with the remaining third, were 
to support the landward paupers. In point of fact, however, it is 
believed that the directors never fully implemented their part of 
the compact, and that the session have always been burdened 
with a portion of the town's poor. On these grounds, the agree- 
ment was lately declared null. 

The parish is cUvided into forty-one districts, to each of which 
a visitor is appointed, to inquire into, and supply the wants of the 
poor from his private purse ; advancing money, which is repaid at 
the end of the month by a board of control, nominated by the ma- 
gistrates, heritors, and session. How this system may work is yet 
uncertain; but it is much to be feared it must give place to a legal 
assessment. 

Prisons. — The number of prisoners, exclusive of debtors, com- 
mitted to the county jail during the last year, amounts to 45. 

Inns, 8j-c. — The three principal inns in Dumfries are, — the King's 
Arms, the George, and the Commercial Inn. Upon a moderate 
average, no fewer than 168 individuals annually have licences 
granted them to sell ale and spirits, and the effect upon the morals 
of the popvdation is truly deplorable. 

Fuel. — The fuel used in the parish consists of coals from San- 
quhar, in this county, and from Maryport and Whitehaven in Cum- 
berland, and peats from Lochar Moss. As peats can be procured in 
smaller quantities than coals, they are generally used by the poorer 
classes, although in the end coals are found to be cheaper. The 
Marvort coal sells at one shilling a measure ; the measure being 
equal to 28 gallons. The best Sanquhar coal sells at sixpence 
per measure, or L. 1, 5s. for a waggon load. An inferior descrip- 
tion of Sanquhar coal sells at fourpence per measure, or L. 1 for 
a waggon load. 

VI. — Miscellaneous Observations. 

The most remarkable features of difference betwixt the state of 
the parish at the period when the last Statistical Account was drawn 
up, and its state at the present time, seem to be the general en- 
largement of the town, and its improvement in appearance, as well 
as in trade ; the increased facility of navigation in the Nith, the 
great improvement which has taken place in husbandry throughout 
\\\e parish, and the advance of knowledge amongst the lower ranks 
of society. Much has been done in reclaiming waste land from 



28 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



Lochcar Moss, and much more may yet be done, if sufficient en- 
couragement be given. The cutting of a channel at the mouth 
of the Lochar, so as to secure to its waters a free escape into the 
Solway Firth, or the forming of a canal as has been proposed, 
from the quarry of Lochar bridge to that estuary, is considered to 
be the only eflFectual mode by which the moss might be drained. 
The greatest obstacle to the accomplishment of this desirable ob- 
ject, is a mill which stands near the mouth of the Lochar, and to 
the removal of which there are at present insuperable difficulties. 
From Lochar Bridge to the sea the distance is more than ten miles, 
and the fall is only thirty feet ; so that, in consequence of the dam 
which is attached to the mill, a body of dead water, more than six 
feet in depth, is kept standing in the bed of the river for several 
miles, completely saturating the spongy soil in every direction.

PRESBYTERY OF DUMFRIES, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. JOHN YORSTOUN, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, Sfc. — The etymology of " Torthorwald," 
the name of this parish, is matter of conjectm-e. That given in 
the former Statistical Report is probably as good as any other, 
viz. that it signifies the Tovrer or Castle of Thor in the wood. There 
is still a large ruin of a strong castle near the centre of the parish, 
supposed, from the style of building, to have been erected 700 
or 800 years ago ; and the parish is said to have been formerly sur- 
rounded by an extensive forest, though at present there is very 
little wood in it.  

Torthorwald is bounded by the parish of Mousewald on the south; 
of Lochmabenonthe east; of Tinwald on the north; and of Dumfries 
on the west. It lies on the south-west face of a gently sloping ridge, 
the summit of which, about 600 or 700 feet in height, constitutes 
the march between two divisions of the county of Dumfries, Niths- 
dale, and Annandale, — taking their names from the two rivers of 
Nith and Annan, which run along their valleys in a southerly di- 
rection, and empty themselves into the Solway Firth. The boun- 
daries betwixt this parish and those of Mousewald, Lochmaben, 
and Tinwald, are not of any strongly defined natural kind, but 
chiefly dikes, ditches, or small runners, separating the lands of con- 
terminous proprietors. But from the parish of Dumfries it is se- 
parated by the water or river of Lochar, which runs along the 
whole line of march. The shape of the parish is pretty compact, 
and nearly square, excepting one long point, consisting principally 
of moss, and projecting about three miles beyond the rest towards 

The old castle of Torthorwald, which is particularly described in the former Sta- 
tistical Report, is situate near the church and manse and village of Torthorwald 
a great part of the walls are still standing. No decay or dilapidation has taken pl'acc 
on It since last Statistical Report ; indeed it may stand as it is for many years, as the 
mortar with which it is cemented is as firm as the solid stone.

the south. In this tract, there is a very long strip of valuable 
meadow along the water of Lochar, and a small tributary stream ; 
but all the rest is a barren moss, neither cultivated nor inhabited; 
— being part of what is known by the name of Lochar Moss. Ac- 
cording to Crawford's map of the county of Dumfries, this parish 
contains 8| square miles, and 5600 English acres. 

Lochar- Moss, which hes along the west side of this parish, is 
of great extent, being about thirteen miles long, and, at an average, 
from two to three miles broad. The slow running-water or river 
called Lochar divides it nearly from north to south. The moss 
on the west side of the water is in the parishes of Dumfries and 
Caerlaverock ; that on the east side is in the parishes of Tinwald, 
Torthorwald, Mousewald, and Ruthwell. 

Meteorology. — The temperature of the atmosphere here is 
in general mild; rather moist than otherwise. No effluvia in- 
jurious to health arise from the great tract of Lochar Moss. 
Agues are hardly known in this district, except when brought 
from other parts of the country. The most prevailing winds are 
from the south-west ; and from the same quarter, the most frequent 
rains come. The temperature of the air is in spring milder here 
than in the Lothians; but the latter enjoy a great advantage over 
us in autumn, as their weather is then much drier and steadier than 
ours. Indeed, I believe these differences of climate and weather 
are general between the east and west coasts, both of England and 

Scotland. _ 

Geologij.—T\\e geology of this parish seems very simple. 1 he 
soil of the greater part of the good land in it is formed from the 
debris of greywacke or transition rock, which is the prevailing rock 
of the ridge that separates the valleys of Nith and Annan, along 
the west side of which Torthorwald lies. In this and the adjom- 
' ing parish of Tinwald, there is perhaps a greater quantity of good 
land lying together, than is to be metwith anywhereelse in Nithsdale. 
The soil is strong enough for wheat, and dry enough for turnips ; 
thus possessing two of the most valuable properties of good land. 

There are neither coals, nor lime, nor stone quarries in this 
parish Stones, which in many places are found near the surface, 
have been used a good deal in building dikes ; but when exposed 
to the weather many of them crumble down, and consequently the 
dikes are not lasting fences. Thorn hedges, when properly taken

care of, thrive well here, and are much more ornamental and bet- 
ter fences than the stone dikes such as we have. 

Beside the extensive moss and meadows lying along Lochar, 
there are three kinds and qualities of lands in Torthorwald pa- 
rish. The first, a long narrow strip, extending from the moss 
one-quarter of a mile upwards, is a light kindly soil, upon a sandy 
or gravelly bottom, and is well adapted to potatoes, or turnips 
and barley. The second division, extending up the ridge about 
half a mile farther, is equally fertile, of a stronger quality, and 
upon a rotten slaty rock bottom. This is also excellent turnip 
and barley soil, and bears good wheat. Both these divisions are 
sound dry ground. But the former is apt to suffer much in a se- 
vere drought. The third division, extending to the top of the 
ridge, is steeper and more uneven on its surface, the soil colder, 
and of a less kindly quality; much of it upon a retentive tilly 
bottom, and, from its high, bare, and exposed situation, far inferior 
in value to either of the other two divisions. 

II. — Civil History. 

Parochial Registers. — The earliest date of the register of births, 
&amp;c. kept in this parish is 1696, and the register in general seems 
to be pretty correct. 

Land-oioners. — The whole parish of Torthorwald belongs to two 
heritors — the Marquis of Queensberry and Sir Robert Grierson, 
of Lag, Bart. Neither of them reside in the parish. The Mar- 
quis's residence is at Kinmont, in the parish of Cummertrees, 
about ten miles south from Torthorwald ; and Sir Robert Grier- 
son's is at Rockhall, in the parish of Mousewald, immediately ad- 
joining to Torthorwald on the south. 

Rental. — The rental of the parish as stated in the Statistical 
Report of 1791, was L. 1850. It is now L. 4765. So great an 
increase cannot be sufficiently accounted for by the rise in the 
price of farm produce, and by the improved system of husbandry. 
In addition to these causes, it is feared there must be taken into 
account the smaller profits which the tenants now make. At the 
former period, most of them were saving money ; but at present, 
very few of them can do more from the produce of their farms, than 
pay their rents and maintain their families. 

III. — Population. 
The population, according to the census taken in 1831, amount. 



32 DUMFRIES-SlIlllE. 

ed to 1320, of whom 651 were males, and 669 females. Tliis is 
exactly double of what the population was in 1791, when the last 
Statistical Report was drawn up. The increase is to be ac- 
counted for in this manner : Sir Robert Grierson, who is proprie- 
tor of a large share of Lochar Moss, and of the adjoining land, 
and through whose property the turnpike road from Dumfries to 
Carhsle passes for a considerable length in two divisions, began 
about twenty-five or thirty years ago to encourage the building of 
a village called Collin, adjoining said road, and near the moss, by 
granting building leases for ninety-nine years, of small portions of 
land. So rapid has been the growth of the village and its bran- 
ches, that nearly one-half of the whole population of the parish 
is now resident upon the same ground which was formerly oc- 
cupied by only five or six families. The principal inducement to 
build in this situation, is its proximity to a great and well fre- 
quented pubUc road, which always has its attractions and advan- 
tages, and to Lochar Moss, where the villagers get a cheap and 
abundant supply of fuel. It was formerly thought by many pro- 
prietors of land, that the great desideratum was to get plenty of 
people to build and settle upon their estates. But experience has 
taught them, that collecting a multitude of people, when there is j 
not sufficient employment for them, instead of being any advan- i 
tage, has no better eff'ect than to bring a heavy burden upon them- I 
selves, and upon the neighbourhood, and is the sure way to increase  
the number of paupers, and to introduce parochial assessments for 
the maintenance of the poor, with all their concomitant evils.

The number of families in the parish is 273, of which 48 are ; 

chiefly employed in agriculture, and 82 in trade, manufactures, | 

and handicraft. The average number of births for the last seven , 

years is 29: of deaths, 17; of marriages, 7. ;

Rent of Land, 3ic. — The rent of arable land varies according to 
quality and situation, from L. 2 to 7s. 6d. the imperial acre. Leases 
are commonly for fifteen or nineteen years. 

The yearly rent of labourers' and cottagers' houses, is from L. 1 
to L. 5. Those at the lowest rent are miserable hovels ; and the 
rent of the best places them beyond the reach of labourers, or even 
common tradesmen. It is of great disadvantage that so many of 
the houses are covered with thatch. 

Prices of Provisions. — The prices of butter, eggs, and poultry, 
are regulated by the Dumfries market, of which Reports are published 
weekly in the Dumfries newspapers; and the Dumfries markets again 
are very much affected by those of Edinburgh and Glasgow, there 
being carriers who make a business of transporting such articles to 
these more distant markets, whenever a profit can be made by them. 
Indeed, the very cheap and rapid communication which is now 
established, and continually improving, between the most distant 
markets, is fast bringing the prices of articles every where nearly 
to a level, and thus benefiting all classes ; raising the prices in re- 
mote parts of the country where the articles are produced ; and 
lowering them in cities and towns where they are principally con- 
sumed. 

Live Stock. — The number of horses kept in the parish, almost 
all farm work-horses of a middle size, is 150. Young horses bred 
by the farmers, 35 ; cows kept, 354 ; young black-cattle, 495 ; 
sheep kept through the year, 284 ; sheep fed on turnips in winter, 
1800 ; swine bred and fattened yearly, 388. 

Rate of Wages, Sc. — The wages of day-labourers are at an ave- 
rage Is. 6d. in summer, and Is, 3d. in winter, without victuals. 
Most of the farm-servants here are unmarried, and are lodged and 
fed in the farmers' houses. The wages of men-servants vary from 
L. 9 to L. 14 a-year, and of women-servants from L. 5 to L. 6 a- 
year. Doing work by the piece is very general ; such as mowing,

ditching, and turnip-hoeing. This last costs from 4s. to 5s. the 
acre. 

Produce. The average gross amount and value of raw produce 

raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows : 

Produce of grain of all kinds, whether cultivated for food of man, or the domestic 

animals, deducting seed, - - - - . '   

potatoes, turnips, cabbages, beet, and other plants culti- 
vated in the fields for food, - - - " 898 0 0

land in pasture, rating it at L. 2 per cow, or full-grown 

ox, grazed, or that may be grazed for the season ; at 6s. per ewe, 
or full-grown sheep, pastured, or that may be pastured, for the 

year, - - " " 

Total value of raw produce raised, - L. 13,487 0 0 

Of the crop of oats, the greater part is used for feeding horses 
and swine, and employed as meal for the farmers' families. The po- 
tatoe crop is almost all used for the same purposes. More than one- 
half of the artificial hay is used in feeding the farmers' horses ; and 
almost the whole of the natural hay is used in feeding the farm 
stock 

Ma7iufactures.— In this parish there are no manufactures ; but 
a considerable number of weavers who work in their own houses, 
some of them country work; but more of them are employed m 
weaving cotton for the manufacturers of Carhsle and other places, 
the prices allowed for which vary exceedingly, and, when very 
low, are attended with great want and misery to the poor weavers. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Covimunication.—Bumivies is the post town of the 
district ; and both a mail-coach, and another coach between it 
and England, pass twice daily through the parish ; and a foot 
post also passes twice every day between Dumfries and Lochma- 
ben, by another turnpike road through this parish. The length 
of turnpike roads in the parish is about seven miles and a-half; and 
thev are kept in excellent order, as are also the parish roads, 
which are about twelve miles long, and are kept up by an assess- 
ment of L. 1 upon the 100 merks of valued rent, amounting to 
about L. 36 a-year. At present the assessment is reduced to los. 
per 100 merks producing only about L. 27 a.year. The roads 
L now in so good a state that it is thought the annual expend - 
ture of this small sum will keep them m proper repair. The sjs-

tern of making and repairing the roads with broken stones, as in- 
troduced by Mr Macadam, prevails universally here. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is a substantial commo- 
dious building, erected in 1782; it affords accommodation for 500 
persons, and the sittings are all free. It is conveniently situated near 
the centre of the parish. The manse has been built at three different 
periods. The oldest part of it was built about 1730 ; an addition 
was made about 1791 ; and another addition in 1809. It is now a 
large and tolerably convenient house. The stipend is fifteen chal- 
ders, half barley, half meal, payable at the rate of the county fiars ; 
and L. 8, 6s. 8d. is given for communion elements. Converted to 
money at the average of the last seven years, the stipend amounts to 
L.248, Is. Id. The glebe contains eleven acres of good land, including 
the garden ground, steads of the manse and offices, and court-yard. 

There are no chapels or dissenting meeting-houses of any kind 
here, though there are in the parish about twenty-eight families of 
Dissenters, and six poor Irish Roman Catholics. The church is 
upon the whole well frequented, and is attended by about 224 fa- 
milies. The average number of communicants is about 335. 

Education. — There are two schools in the parish. One of these 
is near the church, where English reading, writing, arithmetic, 
book-keeping, geography, Latin, and Greek, are very well taught by 
an able, diligent, and successful instructor of youth. His yearly sa- 
lary is L.31, 6s. 6|d. and the interest of L. 160 of mortified money. 
The wages paid by the scholars are extremely moderate, — Is. 6d. 
per quarter for reading, writing, and the four common rules of arith- 
metic ; 3s. per quarter for writing and the higher branches of arith- 
metic ; 5s. per quarter for book-keeping, Latin and Greek. The 
fees for geography, mathematics, and navigation are generally settled 
by agreement between the master and scholars. The yearly amount 
of fees actually received by him may be L. 30. There is a good 
school-house and schoolmaster's house, and small garden. The 
number of scholars attending the school is in winter about 120, and 
in summer about 72. The other school is about two miles to the 
south of this, at the village of Collin. In it are taught reading, 
writing, arithmetic, and book-keeping. The wages paid by the 
scholars for these branches are the same as in the other school. 
The yeariy salary is L. 20, and the amount of fees received may 
be L. 20 per annum. There is a good school and schoolmaster's 
house, and about three-fourths of an acre of land, chiefly re- 
claimed from moss, which is now a considerable advantage to the

master. This school is also well attended. The people of this 
parish are thus amply provided with opportunities of education, and 
scarcely any of them arrive at ten years of age without being able 

to read and write. 

Savings Banks, Sc. — There are no circulating libraries, nor friendly 
societies, nor savings banks in this parish ; but its contiguity to the 
town of Dumfries, where the inhabitants have an opportunity of 
joining in any or all of these, renders establishing them in this pa- 
rish unnecessary. Several of the inhabitants do avail themselves 
of the opportunity of depositing small sums either in the Dumfries 
savings bank, or in that of Ruthwell, which is only eight miles dis- 
tant, and for which it is natural to have a partiahty, as being the 
parent institution established by the worthy and patriotic clergyman 
of that parish, Dr Henry Duncan. 

Poor. The average number of poor persons receiving parochial 

aid is 2 1 . Of these only four are males, and seventeen females, and al- 
most all are old persons. Among these is divided by the kirk-session  
about L. 39 annually, arising from collections at the church, and L. 19, 
5s., being the interest at 3 per cent, of a sum, amounting to L. 550, 
formed out of bequests made to the poor at different times. A general 
distribution is made four times in the year ; but it is also found ne 
cessary to make many partial intermediate disbursements. L. 39 
divided among twenty-one persons makes an average of L. 1, 17s. 
1 |d. to each person. But this gives no just idea of the actual state 
of the distribution, which varies very widely according to the cir- 
cumstances of the paupers; some getting L. 5, 5s. while others not 
more than L. 1 yearly. The time is past when the poor were asham- 
ed, or thought it degrading, to apply for parochial aid. Though 
there is not a single proprietor residing in this parish, the poor have 
hitherto been maintained by voluntary charity, without recourse 
being had to assessments of any kind. In 1791, the number of per- 
sons on the poors' roll was only five ; at present, there are twenty- 
one. Thus the poor have quadrupled, while the number of mha- 
bitants has doubled. At the former period there was distributed 
among the five paupers only L. 5, 9s. yearly. But at that tune a 
considerable quantity of lint was grown in this district, the spinning 
of which gave profitable employment to many persons, particularly 
to old women, and enabled them, in a great measure, to maintain 
themselves ; but the very low price of cotton cloth has now almost 
entirely supplanted the manufacture of home-made linen, and thus 
deprived old women of a useful and profitable branch of employ-

ment, for which they have no substitute; and they are thus made 
much more dependent upon the bounty of others. 

Lins, c5'c.— There are no fewer than five ale, or rather whisky 
houses, in this parish, while there is really no use for one in a place 
so near Dumfries ; and nothing is more pernicious to the industry 
and morals of the people. 

Fuel.— The parish is well supplied with fuel, consisting chiefly 
of peats, from Lochar Moss. But an abundjlnt supply of coals also 
is brought by sea from the opposite English coast to Dumfries, and 
sold there for about 13s. or 14s. the ton. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Lochar Moss. — The most obvious and important improvements 
which are wanted in this parish are, Isf, the draining and dressing 
the moss and meadows along Lochar, which, as before-mentioned, 
are very extensive. There is enough of declivity in this moss 
to admit of its being sufficiently drained for culture, if a straight 
wide course were cut for the water of Lochar, and a mill-dam re- 
moved, which is near the southern end of it in the parish of Car- 
laverock, and which at present stops up the water, and raises it to 
the height of six or seven feet. This great interruption to the 
di-ainage is all for the sake of a small trifling mill, which yields 
very little rent to the proprietor, and is hardly of any consequence 
to the tenants. If this mill-dam were removed, and a proper course 
cut for the main water all along the moss, with the necessary late- 
ral drains, — improvements which could be done at a very moderate 
expense, it is not easy to calculate the vast quantity of ground now 
useless that might be formed into valuable meadows. The prin- 
cipal proprietors of this great moss are the Marquis of Queensber- 
ry, Sir Robert Grierson, Bart., Mr Paterson, the Earl of Mans- 
field, Mr Maxwell of Nithsdale, Mr Douglas of Craigs, Mr Heron, 
and Mr Johnston of Carnsalloch. Where so many proprietors are 
concerned, it is not easy to induce them to agree and co-operate 
heartily in any one plan. But the draining and improving of this 
vast moss, which lies in a low country, in a healthy warm climate, 
and on the edge of the sea, is evidently so much for the advantage 
of all concerned, is so plain and simple an operation, and might be 
completed at so small an expense, in comparison with the return 
it would make to the proprietors, that it is most wonderful, and 
much to be regretted, that it has been neglected so long, although 
it has been in contemplation for seventy or eighty years. About 



38 



PUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



the beginning of that period, Charles Duke of Queensberry, who 
was then proprietor of a large portion of this moss, and whose 
memory, for his benevolence and public spirit, is still held in vene- 
ration by all the inhabitants of this part of the country, employ- 
ed Smeaton, the most eminent civil engineer of that time, to survey 
the moss and make a plan and estimate of the expense of draining 
and improving it. The survey, plan, and estimate were made, and 
are pubhshed in Dr 'Singer's Agricultural Account of Dumfries- 
shire ; but unfortunately the plan has never been followed out. The 
work could not be properly carried on unless the whole proprietors 
were cordially to co-operate, and it is not easy to say when this 
may happen. The estimated expense when Mr Smeaton made 
his survey was only L. 2952. 

2cZ, Much benefit would arise to the parish from the building 
of more substantial and commodious farm-steadings, and if more at- 
tention were paid to the rearing and managing thorn hedges for in- 
closing and subdividing the farms. 

3d, It would also be of great advantage, particularly on the higher 
grounds of this parish, if plantations were to be reared in different 
places. These would not only beautify the country, but, by the 
shelter they would afford, render the climate warmer, and contri- 
bute very much to the comfort and improvement of the cattle, which 
thrive but very poorly at present on the high grounds, exposed to 
every cold blast. 

4:th, The greatest improvement which has lately taken place m 
agriculture here is the introduction and general adoption of the 
culture of turnips. It is not more than seven or eight years since 
this has become general; it is of the greatest advantage to the ten- 
ants, and enables them to pay rents which would otherwise have 
been ruinous to them. The soil is very much adapted to turnips, 
the crops are in general good, and the following crops of barley 
and grass are wonderfully improved by the feeding of sheep on the 
turnip fields.

• The metliod which a]pear.s most likely for accomplishing an extensive work of 
this kind, in which so many proprietors are concerned, is for some skilful and enter- 
prising individual, with sufficient capital, to obtain along lease of the whole from the 
proprietors for a rent very low at first, but more than it yields at present, and gra- 
dually rising, with full right to cut the main course straight, and such other lateral 
drains as he may find necessary. To enable the proprietors to grant such a lease, 
an act of Parliament would be required, as great part of the property is under entail.

I. Topography and Natural History. 

Name and Boundaries.— Ijif the Account formerly given of this 
parish, the name Tinwald is supposed to be derived from the 
Gaelic, and to signify the harbour ; or from the Saxon, and to 
signify the house in the wood. Whatever may be the import 
of the latter syllable of the word, which in the old presbytery 
records is spelt iceld, the former, viz. Tin or Ting, appears 
more probably to have been derived from the Ting, or court of 
the ancient Saxons or Scandinavians, who at one time posses- 
sed a considerable portion of the country. Tings or courts are 
well known to have been held in the open air ; and immediately 
adjoining the church here, there is a mound which a few years 
ago was perfectly entire, but is now much defaced " Seges est ubi 
Troja fuit" evidently artificial, and said to bear a striking resem- 
blance to one bearing the same name in the Isle of Man, upon which 
local courts were held, until a very recent period. Tingwall in 
Shetland appears to have derived its name from the same circum- 
stance.— See Peveril of the Peak, Vol. i. ch. v. Note 2d. Trail- 
flat is probably from a Gaehc etymon, which signifies a sloping loet 
side. It was united to Tinwald in 1650. 

The united parish forms an irregular figure of about 6 miles 
by 4 in its extreme length and breadth, and contains about 15 
square miles. It is bounded by the parish of Kirkmichael upon 
the north; by that of Lochmaben upon the east; by those of 
Torthorwald and Dumfries upon the south and south-west ; and 
by that of Kirkmahoe upon the west and north-west.

Topographical ApjMarances. — The only hills in the parish are 
the northern part of a range which extends to the S. E. through 
the parishes of Torthorwald and Mousewald, and sinks gradually as 
it approaches the Solway ; their acclivity is in most cases gentle, 
and with scarcely an exception they admit of cultivation to the tops. 
The elevation of the highest hill above the level of the sea, accord- 
ing to barometrical measurement, is 682 feet. 

Hydrography. — There is one lake in the parish, called the Mur- 
der Loch. It is of small extent, and has been considerably dimi- 
nished lately by means of draining. It is now only about eighteen 
feet at its greatest depth. 

The only streams connected with the parish worth noticing are 
the Ae and the Lochar; the former of which forms the north- 
ern boundary of the parish. It has its source from the Queens- 
berry hill, whence it proceeds in a southern direction, sepa- 
rating the parish of Kirkmichael from those of Closeburn and 
Kirkmahoe; then turning to the east, it separates Kirkmichael 
from Tinwald, joins the Kannel near its southern extremity, 
and with it falls into the Annan above Lochmaben. It is a 
rapid stream, very liable to floods, which come down from the 
high grounds with great velocity, and often do considerable 
damage. Its bed being of a gravelly nature, this stream is conti- 
nually undermining its banks and changing its course. 

The Lochar commences near a small village upon the Edinburgh 
road, called Jericho, where two rivulets of nearly the same size the 
one forming for a considerable space the western boundary of 
the parish join together, and afterwards assume that name. It 
separates the parishes of Tinwald and Dumfries so far as they lie 
contiguous. 

Geology. — The rocks of which the hills in this parish are com- 
posed consist entirely of greywackeandgreywacke slate, all of which 
dip towards the south at almost every degree of inclination, some 
being nearly vertical, others nearly horizontal. There are a few 
tJ-ifling veins scarcely worthy of the name perhaps of crystallized 
felspar, to be raiet with amongst them. Peat-moss is pretty ex- 
tensive ; but there is none of any depth, except a small portion upon 
the eastern boimdary of the parish, and that lying contiguous to 
the Lochar, most of which has been improved. 

gil There is a considerable variety of soil in the parish. 

On the south-western boundary of the parish, there is the moss at 
the side of the Lochar, already mentioned, and extending to about 



TINWALD AND TRAILFLAT.

a mile in length, by a quarter of a mile in breadth, — which has been 
converted into meadow of very superior quahty. Next to this, 
upon the east, and closing round it upon the north, is a range of 
fields from a quarter to half a mile in breadth, of a sandy gravel : 
The materials of which these fields are composed have evidently 
been transported by water. The range now referred to extends  N. 
W. through the parish of Kirkmahoe ; and there is every probabi- 
lity that the old tradition, of such having once been the course of the 
Nith, is correct. Above these fields, and farther from the Lochar, is 
a range of much greater length as well as breadth, extending to about 
two-thirds of the whole length of the parish, and consisting of a 
dry clay loam very much mixed in some places with small stones 
of great fertility, and well adapted to every variety of crop. This 
latter description of soil extends to the top, and except at one 
place, where they form a sort of double range, with about a mile 
by three-fourths of moor and moss intervening, quite over the hills, 
until it terminates in a moss upon the eastern side. That towards 
the east, however, is of a stiffer and more retentive clay, rather 
spongy, and from its less favourable exposure, not so well adapted 
for cultivation. The north and north-west portion of the parish, 
with a small exception immediately upon the banks of the Ae, con- 
sists of a cold moorish clay, covered in some places by a few inches 
of peat, and very unproductive. In the middle of Lochar meadow, 
there is a pretty high ridge, still called the Isle, upwards of half a 
mile in length, and containing about thirty Scotch acres ; which is 
entirely composed of sea sand, and evidently shows that at one time 
the tide must have flowed in this direction. In confirmation of this, 
it is said to have been found marked upon an old Dutch chart, " that 
the isles of Tin wald afforded the safest and most commodious harbour 
for shipping in Scotland." — Nearly opposite to the manse, too, at 
the bottom of what in former times must have been a deep narrow 
gut, there is a place called Collyveat, or Cully veat, where there 
is the visible formation of a small bay. There was a ferry, it has been 
supposed, at this place ; and Cully veat is said to be a corruption of 
Collin's boat. A much more probable supposition, however, and 
one rendered doubly so by the circumstance of the Dutch having 
been acquainted with the Tinwald isles and harbours, is that the 
name in question signifies i\ie foot of the juUy, voet being the low 
Dutch for foot. According to others it is of Gaelic extraction, and 
should be spelt cully vat, which signifies a harbour for boats.

pear, and do very considerable damage, especially to the Swed- 
ish turnips. They are most destructive in dry hot weather, 
when there is a deficiency of moisture in the atmosphere for the 
purposes of vegetation. The eggs are deposited upon the under 
side of the leaves of the most luxuriant plants, on the juice of 
which, after having been hatched, they live during the different 
stages of their progressive existence Two years ago, I saw a 
small field of Swedes almost entirely destroyed by these httle crea- 
tures ; the leaves were covered with hundreds upon every square 
inch, and in the course of about three weeks, except the back stem, 
and one or two of the larger veins, they were almost entirely withered 
away. In moist or genial weather they are seldom to be met with, 
and then, when they do appear, vegetation is so vigorous, that the 
plants are able to sustain them, without receiving essential injury. 
Hot lime and salt are sometimes employed to destroy them, but ge- 
nerally without much effect. The turnip crops, however, are, at 
an earlier stage, and just as they begin to appear above ground, 
exposed to the depredations of another very destructive insect, 
usually, though perhaps improperly, called the turnip fly— the 
Haltica nemorum of entomologists : whole fields are sometimes so 
entirely destroyed by it, that it is found necessary to sow them a 
second time ; which seldom succeeds.

A laro-e portion of the parish was at one time covered with wood, 
the o-reater part of which was cut down by the last Duke of 
Queensberry ; and now, except a quantity upon the estate of Amis- 
field, very little remains. The soil seems most congenial to oak and 
ash. We have also a few small belts of Scotch and larch fir ; but 
these have all been planted. There is also here and there a tree of 
the more common descriptions, both of hard and of soft wood. The 
church and churchyard are surrounded by a thick row, at some places 
double, of large planes and ashes, upwards of a hundred years old. 
Of these, however, there are a greater number, and many of them 
of a greater age, upon the poHcy at Amisfield. And in the garden 
there, there is an old holly whoSe stem below the branches measures 
nine feet by seven and a-half as its mean girt. Its branches are 
rather pecuharly formed: for immediately upon the top of the 
trunk they diverge all around in such a manner as to form a large 
open space in the middle, where a number of people might conceal 
themselves. 

IL— Civil History. 

Eminent Men. — 1. The first person, in point of date, of any emi- 
nence connected with the parish appears to be Sir Thomas Charte- 
ris of Amisfield, who was appointed Lord High Chancellor of Scot- 
land by Alexander HI. in 1280. He seems to have been the first 
layman that ever held that office. —  Douglas' Baronage of Scotland, 
Vol.i.p. 150. — 2. Sir Thomas Charteris, his great grandson, also 
connected with the parish, was appointed to the same office by King : 
David in 1134. He was killed at the battle of Durham, where his 
royal master was taken prisoner. — {Ibid. 3. We find Sir John 
Charteris, also of Amisfield, holding, in the reign of James V., the of- 
fice of Warden of the West Marches, one of the most important un- 
der the crown : and there is a traditionary story of rather a singu- 
lar visit having been paid him by the king, which led to consequen- 
ces by which the family were in a great measure reduced. —  For- 
sgth's Beauties of Scotland, Vol. ii. p. 312. This family was still 
farther reduced by the severities directed against it by the govern-

ment of the Protector, in consequence of the active aid lent by Sir 
John Charteris to Montrose towards the restoration of King Charles. 
4. " The famous Paterson, too, who planned the Darien scheme, 
and the Bank of England, &amp;c. was born at Skipmire, in the old pa- 
rish of Trailflat, about the year 1660. The same house gave birth 
to his grand-nephew, Dr James Mounsey, first physician for many 
years to the Empress of Russia." 5. General Fead, also, was born 
at Fulton, in this parish, about the year 1 720. He enlisted a pri- 
vate in the British artillery, and rose from the ranks to be a gene- 
ral, and a very distinguished officer. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners in the parish are the Mar- 
quis of Queensberry, Douglas of Craigs, Charteris of Amisfield, 
and Dalzell of Glenae. 

Parochial Register. — The only register in the parish regularly 
kept for any length of time is that of births ; the earliest entry in 
which is on April 4, 1762. 

Antiquities. — There are distinct traces of a camp of considerable 
size upon the top of Barshell hill, which, from its round form, is 
supposed to have been British. There are also the visible remains 
of three smaller forts, one upon the farm of Shielhill, another at 
Highauchnane, and the third at Amisfield. The last, approaching 
to a square, may possibly have been a Roman station, where a cohort 
or two may occasionally have been placed. What renders this more 
probable is, that the old Roman road from Burnswark by Trailflat 
passed close by. At Amisfield, also, there is an old baronial tower, 
still perfectly entire, said to be the most perfect of the kind now 
existing in the kingdom. 

The old place of Tinwald, situated in what was formerly a part 
of Lochar Moss, and the seat of a branch of the Maxwell family, 
seems to have been well fitted for a place of defence. Till within 
a few years, part of the old building remained. It is now entirely 
demolished, and the materials have been removed. 

Modern Buildings. — There are three mansion-houses in the 
parish, — that of Glenae, belonging to Major Dalzell, — that of 
Tinwald, belonging to the Marquis of Queensberry; and Amis- 
field, the seat of the old family of Charteris. " The sirname 
Charteris" says Douglas in his Baronage of Scotland, " is 
of great antiquity in Scotland. It is the opinion of some antiqua- 
ries that it is of French extraction,— that William, a son of 
the Earl of Charteris in France, came to England with William 



TINWALD AND TRATLFLAT. 



45 



the Conqueror,— that a son or grandson of his came to Scotland 
with King David the First, and was the progenitor of all of the 
sirname o'f Charteris in this kingdom ; and certain it is they began 
to make a figure in the south of Scotland soon after that era."

1821, - - - 1248 

1831, - - - 1220 

The decrease during the last twelve years has been occasioned 
by a great many cottages having been thrown down in the progress 
of improvement. There seems to be a general disposition among 
the proprietors to continue this practice, as the present cottars die 
out or remove.

The people, with few exceptions, are sober, cleanly, and indus- 
trious, strictly lionest, and abundantly comfortable and contented 
with their situation and circumstances. Oatmeal pottage, with 
milk, is the general breakfast of the peasantry, and of the younger 
portion of every family in the parish. Potatoes among the work- 
ing-classes commonly occupy a principal place both at dinner and 
supper. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — There are as nearly as I 
have been able to ascertain, 9405 imperial acres in the parish, 
roads, fences, &amp;c. included; and of these there are about 119 
acres under wood, 350 in meadow, and 1647 which never have 
been cultivated. Of the last there may be a few acres, perhaps, 

 Returns respecting marriages can scarcely be relied on, as the parties very fre- 
quently belong to different parishes, and it is probable that in many cases their mar- 
riages may be returned for two parishes.

upon which the soil is so thin as not to admit of being pared and 
burnt ; and in this case, when hme and manure must both be driven 
from a distance, the profits arising from cultivation might not be 
great. But in general the uncultivated land in the parish is either 
moss, or moor, of sufficient depth, and will eventually pay well for 
improvement, which is gradually, though slowly, advancing. Pro- 
bably 1500 acres might, with a profitable application of capital, 
be added to the cultivated land of the parish. 

Rent of Land. — Ai-able land rents from 6s. to L. 2, 8s. per 
acre, averaging about 16s. The average rate of grazing is, per 
cow, L. 3 ; per ox, L. 2 ; and per ewe, or full-grown sheep, for the 
year, 10s. 

Rate of Wages. — Farm-servants are commonly hired by the half 
year ; exclusive of board, men-servants receive from L. 5, 10s. to 
L. 6 ; women, L. 2, 5s. to L. 2, 12s. Labourers engaged by the 
day are paid, in summer, with victuals, — men, from Is. to Is. 2d. ; 
women, 6d : without victuals during summer, men receive from Is. 6d. 
• to Is. 8d.; women, 9d., except during harvest, when men and women 
receive the same rates, which are frequently 2s., and sometimes 
2s. 6d., according to the demand. In winter, without victuals, men 
are paid Is. 3d. per day; women, 8d. Mason and carpenter-work 
is commonly done by the piece ; but when employed by the day, 
which occasionally happens, masons, with victuals, charge 3s. ; with- 
out victuals, 3s. 6d.: carpenters, with victuals, 2s.; without victuals, 
2s. 6d. Tailors are paid, with victuals, at the rate of Is. 3d. per 
day. 

Breeds of Live Stock. — The common breed of cattle is the Gal- 
loway ; and very considerable attention has been for some time, and 
is still, paid to its improvement. Of late years, the Ayrshire breed 
has been introduced, and seems to be gaining ground. Of this 
latter description only the queys are reared ; and these when near- 
ly three years old, and in calf, are in great demand in the Eng- 
lish market. 

Husbandjy.— Farming is not in greater perfection in any part 
of Scotland than in this parish. Upon the best dry arable 
land, what is called the five-shift rotation, is followed, i. e. 1st year, 
oats ; 2d, potatoes or turnips fed off by sheep ; 3d, wheat or 
barley, sown down with clover and rye-grass ; 4th, hay ; and 5th, 
pasture. 

Upon cold land, not fit for wheat and barley, a seven year rota- 
tion is generally followed, viz. two crops of oats, one rape fed off by 



TINWALD AND TRAILFLAT. 



47 



sheep, another oats, sown down with grass seeds, ancj three years 
pasture. Our best farmers plant but few potatoes, and cut only 
a small portion of their sown hay : even that, however, they never 
do upon their poor land, but allow it the advantage of an addi- 
tional year's pasturage. j j j 
It is only about fifteen years since turnip husbandry and good 
farming were introduced into the parish. Previous to this period, 
the land was much over-cropped, and this seems still the prevailing 
error into which the less judicious of the tenantry are apt to fall. 
Most of the brushwood in the parish has been rooted ; and drain- 
ing, levelling of moss, paring and burning of moor, liming, &amp;c. are 
carried on to a considerable extent every year. Irrigation is also 
practised where water can be had conveniently, but not to any 
great extent. 

The duration of leases is generally 19 years ; and for land adapt- 
ed to the Jive-shift rotation none could be more favourable. 
Generally the new tenant enters at Whitsunday to the grass and 
green crop lands, while the old tenant has the white crop then upon 
the ground. Thus a nineteen years' lease allows five seasons for 
cleaning and improving, the whole of which time is required 
before the farm is got regularly over, and three full rota- 
tions afterwards, by which time it is sufficiently prepared for a 
new supply of lime, &amp;c. The state of farm-buildings, with three 
or four exceptions, is far from being good. The advantages of 
enclosing and subdividing are fully appreciated ; and nearly the 
whole arable part of the parish has been laid out in fields, sur- 
rounded by sufficient fences. • 

The principal improvement recently made in the parish is the 
cultivation of the high grounds ; which the farmers have been able 
to effect by means oUone manure. These grounds are in general so 
difficult of access, that nothing bulky can be conveyed to them with- 
out a trouble and expense far exceeding the profit : and former- 
ly, when they became fogged, to which they have a tendency, they 
were commonly broken up ; and after carrying a crop or two, they 
were again laid out to improve themselves without any farther assist- 
ance. But now that bruised bones sufficient for a Scotch acre can 
be taken up in a single cart, 30 imperial bushels being the usual 
quantity, we have the most luxuriant crops of turnip, and, con- 
sequently, of grain, upon the very tops of the hills. Rape dust 
is also used as a manure, in the proportion of about 10 and 12 
cwts. to an acre.

Highland wedders fed off upon turnip annually. The produce or 
rent of cottages may be about L. 213 per annum. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market- Toiv7is. — Dumfries, our principal market-town, lies up- 
on the S. W. of, and is distant about six miles from, the middle of 
the parish. There are also occasional markets at Lochmaben and 
Lockerby, which lie upon the east, — the latter about the same dis- 
tance as Dumfries, the former three miles nearer. Dumfries and 
Lochmaben are our post towns. About four miles of the turn- 
pike road between Dumfries and Edinburgh lie within the pa- 
rish; upon which a mail-coach passes and repasses daily. Our 
parish roads and bridges are in an excellent state of repair. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is situated rather inconve- 
niently upon the western side of the parish, about a mile from the 
one extremity, and five from the other. It was built in 1763, is 
a long narrow rectangular house, without either aisle or gallery. It 
is in a state of good repair, and affords accommodation for about 
400 sitters. The seats are all common, except the few which have 
been attached to the principal farms, and those which are occupied 
by resident proprietors. The manse was built in 1720, and un- 
derwent considerable repairs in 1790, and also in 1800. 

The glebe consists of about seventeen Scotch acres, fences, &amp;c. 



TINWALD AND TRAILFLAT. 49 

included; it is all arable, and if let might bring of yearly rent from 
L. 30 to L. 35. 

The stipend is composed of L. 1 14, 4s. 5d. money ; 265 stones 
imperial of oatmeal; 77.676 imperial bushels of barley; and 
L. 8, 12s. lOd. of Government allowance, — communion elements 
included. The amount of the stipend in money is L. 150. 

The parish church is the only place of public worship in the 
parish ; though occasionally the dissenters make use of a barn as a 
sort of chapel. There are 22 families, consisting of 87 individuals, 
who do not attend the Estabhshed church. Of these, two famihes 
consisting of 9 individuals, are Roman Catholics, and one, con- 
sisting of 8 individuals, ranks among the Independents. The rest 
are dissenters and seceders. The Established church, however, 
has always been well attended : and the people in general have a 
proper sense of the importance of the public ordinances of religion. 
The Sacrament is dispensed once in the year, and usually to about 
400 communicants. 

Collections in the church average about L. 30 yearly ; and once 
in the three years or thereabouts a collection, amounting to L. 12 
or L. 15, is made for some religious or charitable purpose, in which 
the parish is not immediately interested. 

Education. — There are two schools in the parish, both parochial, 
at which all the ordinary branches of education are taught. The 
principal schoolmaster has two chalders of oatmeal, and the in- 
terest of L. 114 of mortified money, for a salary, amounting in 
whole to L. 37, 12s. 9d. The other has one chalder, and the in- 
terest of L. 77,— in money, L. 19, 8s. 4id. Both have the legal 
accommodation ; — the former a great deal more. 

The wages paid in the parish school may be stated upon an 
average to amount to L. 30 per annum. Children are commonly 
sent to school about four and five years of age, and no persons above 
six years old are unable to read. The people are fully alive to the 
advantages of instruction, and would much rather deprive themselves 
of many of the comforts of life than withhold from their children 
the benefits of a liberal education. 

Savinrfs BanL—Some years ago there was a savings bank in the 
parish, which at first, while the thing was new, and the per centage 
high, succeeded pretty well. But as soon as the novelty was over, 
and the rate of interest reduced, it gradually went backwards, and 
was at ast given up as no longer beneficial,— the people generally 
preferring to go to the larger banks, where they can deposit their 

DUMFRIES. D 



50 



DUMFIIIES-SHIIIK, 



money, without any one attending, either to what they have or what 
they have not. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— We have 14 individuals upon our 
poors' roll, who regularly receive parochial relief; but of these 
there is only one entirely dependent upon the parish, and for his 
board L. 4 per annum is paid. The others receive from L. 1 to 
L. 2 yearly, according to their necessities. There are about 6 or 8 
more who require a little occasional assistance. 

The annual amount of contributions for support of the poor are, 
our church collections, which average about L. 26 in the year, and 
the interest of L. 300, mortified by various charitable persons. 
Besides these, the Duke of Quensberry allows six free cottages to 
poor old women ; and the late Mr Douglas of Craigs was a regular 
benefactor of the poor, as well as a very generous landlord. 

The poor in general are at first very averse to seek parochial 
relief; and there are individuals in the parish who, I believe, would 
almost rather starve than have recourse to it. This noble spirit 
of independence I do all in my power to encourage. But when 
once individuals are fairly upon the roll, they soon lose all feeling 
of delicacy, take their allowance as their right, and in some in- 
stances, instead of being thankful for the portion they receive, 
upbraid the members of the session with partiality in the distribu- 
tion. 

For the last four years, the period during which I have had the 
management of the poors' funds, not a single name has been ad- 
ded to the public hst. I find from experience that 8s. or 10s. given 
privately when the people can rely upon the discretion of the 
donor will excite more gratitude, and afford more true comfort, 
than a poMW given otherwise. 

Alehouses— There are at present two small dram-shops m the 
parish, which we have the prospect of soon getting rid of. They 
have the worst possible effect upon the morals of the people : and 
there is scarcely a crime brought before a court that has not origi- 
nated in,'or been somehow connected with, one of these nests of ini- 
quity. All our toll-keepers have houses of this description, and our 
country roads are to a considerable extent maintained by the gains 
of intemperance. We are highly indebted to the Circuit Judges 
for the severe terms in which they occasionally reprobate the tole- 
rance of such places. Their reproofs have had a good effect. 

Fuel— The common fuel used is peat, a great part of whicti is 
procured in Lochar Moss, in the parish of Dumfries. In cases 



TINWALD AND TRAILFLAT. 



51 



where the material has to be paid for, a single horse load costs 
from Is. 6d. to 2s.; and when moss is attached to the farm or house, 
the load costs from Is. to Is. 6d. according to the difficulty of cut- 
ting. Coals are beginning to come into more general use. These 
are brought from the English coast to Dumfries by water, and are 
sold commonly about 8s. per cart load. They are also to be had 
at Sanquhar, at about 3s. per cart load. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

The time of sowing oats and barley is about ten days earher now, 
than that stated in the former Statistical Account of the parish; and 
wheat after turnips is very frequently sown about the end of Decem- 
ber, and sometimes even later. The average rent, especially of the 
best arable and meadow land, is fully double of what it seems to 
have been then. Dry hard land, which formerly was not worth 
one-third of the holm land per acre, is now in consequence of the 
facility with which bone manure, &amp;c. can be procured fully equal to 
that in value. There are not now above five scores of stock sheep 
in the parish. The rental of the parish, which at the time the for- 
mer Statistical Account was written, is stated to have been L. 2559, 
is now L. 6208. The population has increased from 850 to 1215. 
The weekly church collections have advanced from L. 15 to L. 26 
per annum; and the mortified money from L. 140 to L. 300. The 
wages of day labourers have been raised from Is. to Is. 6d. ; car- 
penters from Is. lOd. to 2s. 6d. ; masons from Is. lOd. to 3s. 6d. ; 
tailors from 8d. to Is. 3d. And the minister's stipend has been 
advanced from L. 77, 4s. to L. 150. Parish roads, then reported 
to have been bad, are now excellent : all Macadamized. 

The parish is very properly divided into small and large farms, 
varying from L. 40 to L. 600 of rental, thus affording for all classes 
a sufficient motive to industry. The servant, by frugality and care, 
raises himself to a small tenant, and the small tenant is, by the same 
means, raised to a greater. This system of progressive advance- 
ment, however, can never possibly come into salutary operation, 
so long as the laio of hypothec is permitted to remain. A man 
who has little or nothing to lose is much less timorous, and much 
more ready to bind himself for the payment of a large rent, than 
one possessed of capital. And as the law now is, a proprietor has 
little interest in being scrupulous about a tenant, for, lose who may, 
it must be his own fault if he ever do ; while the tenant, if so dis- 



52 



DUMFRIES-SIIIRE. 



posed, has it in his power to practice the grossest frauds upon his 
creditors. 

Nothing, however, would contribute more to promote the com- 
fort and happiness of the labouring classes in this quarter, than the 
good government and general improvement of Ireland. We are 
constantly infested with swarms of Irish vagrants, who, besides being 
in general superior workers with the spade, have commonly, while 
they remain, their wives engaged in begging, if not in stealing, and 
are thus enabled to undertake work at a lower rate than that by 
which our own countrymen can support themselves.

PRESBYTERY OF DUMFRIES, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. JOHN WIGHTMAN, MINISTER. 



I. Topography and Natural History. 

Name md Boundaries.— Thb nsnne of the parish is of doubtful 
origin, but perhaps it may signify the church in the valley, or in 
the plain, near or by the river. Indeed, the Nith is still not 
far from the church, and has left evident proofs of its having, at 
some former period, run close by the church walls, and passed 
through Lochar Moss in its way to the Solway Frith. The pa- 
rish is bounded by Dumfries on the S. and S. E. ; by Holywood 
on the W. ; by Dunscore on the N. W. ; by Closeburn on the 
N. ; and by Kirkmichael and Tinwald on the N. E. and E. It 
is 7 miles in length, and, at its greatest breadth, it is 5 1 miles 
broad. It contains between 18 and 19 square miles. 

Topographical Appearances. — The hills range from N. to S., 
with peaks pointing eastward, and the exposure is W. and S. W., 
—the land rising gradually till it terminates in heights, some of 
which are 600, and some 670, feet above the level of the sea. 
Wardlaw Guard hill and Auchengeith hill rise 770 feet above 
the sea level, and have a dechvity southward. Our hill streams 
have in several places formed " hermit-fancied caves" for their 
Naiads out of the living rock, in the most curious style ; and there 
is a cave at Crofthead of Dalswinton which deserves to be men- 
tioned. Kirkmahoe is entirely an inland parish, but there is a 
beautiful view of the sea, from the uplands and hills, especially the 
Watchman's hill, where in a clear day the Solway is seen in the 
distance. 

Meteorology. — The medium temperature is about 47° and the 
prevailing winds are the W. and the S. W. We, as well as others, 
have our prognostics of changes in the weather. Not to men- 
tion the signs afforded by Criffel, a high hill which overlooks 
the estuary of the Nith, we may notice that if, during the day, the 



54

face of nature be remarkably bland and sweet, and, especially, if 
in the afternoon, a certain sunny softness seem to sleep on the land- 
scape, or if the hamlet's smoke rise in long straight pillars, a very 
heavy fall of rain is likely to take place before the close of next 
day. So also at night, when the galaxy is vivid and strongly de- 
fined, and the stars are twinkling with a sickly lustre, a similar 
sequence may be expected. 

The splendid meteor, or Draco volans of 1783, was distinctly seen 
and carefully observed by the writer of this account, while it sailed 
in superb majesty over the town and neighbourhood of Dumfries, 
with a tremendous length of train, longo tractu, a tergo albes- 
cente  and while it moved equably in a S. E. direction, sinking 
at last from view towards the mouth of the river Annan, when a 
rumbling noise was heard as if some huge mass of red-hot iron had 
there fallen into the sea. 

Hydrography. — The river Nith, though it intersects a small cor- 
ner of the parish at Isle, may perhaps be said rather to form its west 
boundary than to be one of its streams. We have several stream- 
lets or burns, however, which are generally very romantic and pic- 
turesque in their scenery, and abound in trout. In the Duncow or 
Newlands burn there are three waterfalls, one of which, the 
Whitehall or Glencarrick leap, when the stream is swollen with 
heavy rains, presents a sight peculiarly striking. 

Geology. — On the rocky banks of some of our streams, beds or 
strata of stone are observable, generally dipping to the west. There 
is a red freestone quarry wrought with pick and wedges at 
Quarrel  Quarry wood, having its dip in the same direction ; and 
there is at the same place a variety of sandstone impregnated with 
that variety of red iron ore used by the natives of Southern Africa 
in painting their bodies and powdering their hair, which has been 
noticed by geologists. Some white marl has been found in the 
southern parts of the parish. Near the middle of the parish, 
in sinking for water, 60 feet of loose watery gravel were found, 
and beneath the gravel, 12 or 14 feet of very fine sand of a red 
colour, and soft as brown sugar. The depth of this bed is not known. 
On the high grounds are often found mossy strata about six inches 
thick, then a bed of earthy gravel, after that, red till, schist, 
and decomposed slaty rocks. A gravelly soil, inclining much to 
sand, intermixed with small round stones, is generally found on the 
hraes or sloping grounds, while there is on the low lying or holm 
land an alluvial soil intimately mingled with clay, and apparently

vestino- on water. The banks of the Nith, at the fords, are covered 
with heaps of small stones of ahnost every shape and colour. Some 
of them are curiously marked with straight, some with curved Imes, 
some with spots of various hues, and some are graced with red cir- 
cles Many are of a soft and snowy whiteness, and not a lew ot 
a ciamy paleness. These two last kinds appear to be peculiar 
to the valley rivers, and are not to be found in our mountain 
streams,-at least of such fine grain and quahty. The strath and 
the rising ground, also, from the river to the very tops of the dis- 
tant eminences, are full of pebbles and rolling-stones, evidently 
smoothed and rounded by attrition ; and here and there specimens 
of farcihte or pudding-stone may be observed, and small stones 
embodied with larger ones. The Nith, it would appear, at differ- 
ent periods, and by diff-erent tracts respectively, has run through 
all these undulating grounds before it sunk, in the lapse of centu- 
ries, to its now lowly bed, or before they rose to their present va- 
rious heights. But by what instrumental agency was this depres- 
sion, or this elevation, effected The fresh water of our streams, 
and the briny surges of the Solway, may have been at work " in 
old dusky time," with the aid of some electric or elastic auxiliaries, 
some subterranean fires, or submarine springs forming those 
high and hollow places which now exhibit the appearance of a 
swelling sea, converted into grass and corn-fields. 

Botani/.— Under this head there is nothing pecuhar to the pa- 
rish ; but it may be mentioned, that we have many plantations, less 
or more extensive ; and we have, in various places, a great number 
of beautiful trees, some of which stand in social clumps, and others 
in sohtary state, on the lands of Dalswinton, Carnsalloch, Miln- 
head, Carzield, Kemyshall, Whitehall, Netherhall, Auchencairn, 
Glenmaid; and in other parts of the parish there are planta- 
tions of various sorts of timber ; and new plantations are rising 
on every hand. The prospect is thus finely diversified, and the 
grounds exhibit a rich and sheltered appearance. At Dalswinton 
there are many stately Scots elms, some in graceful ranks, and 
some in no less agreeable confusion, while others stand majes- 
tically alone. There are also here fine beeches, some of which 
measure above twelve feet in circumference at the height of four 
feet. A noble ash stands here also, measuring 21 feet in cir- 
cumference, and containing 300 feet of solid timber. In one of 
the parks there is a gigantic oak, under the protection of whose 
knotted arms, it has been said that 1000 armed men might 



56 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE- 



easily stand without josthng one another. There are also some 
large and stately trees on the estate of Carnsalloch. Two noble 
files of beeches, planted by the late Alexander Johnston, Esq. 
and which were among the first hedge-rows in this part of the 
country, form, when they are in leaf, a fine berceau-canopy over 
the head of the traveller on the public road, and afford him a plea- 
sant vista on his way to or from Dumfries. Near the mansion- 
house of Carnsalloch there is a Spanish or sweet chestnut, very 
remarkable for its size and beauty. At the head of the huge 
trunk, it branches out into four large arms nearly equal in size, 
one of which was broken in February 1827 by a high wind, but 
the other three are almost entire. In August 1826, this tree 
contained 528 cubic feet of timber. The trunk now Jan. 8, 1834, 
is 28 feet, each of the three remaining branches 11 feet in cir- 
cumference, and the average diameter of the ground over-canopied 
by its grandly spreading boughs is 18 paces  Not far from Carn- 
salloch gate, on the east side of the road, stands a venerable oak, 
which contains 282 cubic feet of wood. The trunk itself contains 
117 feet of solid timber, and is 9 feet 7 inches high, and 25 paces 
are the average ground which this gnarled dignitary overhangs 
with his giant arms. It is not yet twenty years since this tree was 
seriously believed by some otherwise sensible persons to be haunted 
by a spirit. 

II. — Civil History. - 

Historical Notices. — Four large estates, which in former times 
were much more extensive than they are now, constituted the 
principal part of this parish ; and a short notice of these will, in 
some degree, illustrate this head of its statistics. 

1. Dalswinton, or the Dale of Swinton. We find this estate 
first in the possession of the Cumins, and afterwards in that of the 
Stewarts. " In 1250, Sir John Cumin possessed the manor of 
Dalswinton, and Duncol, or Duncow, and in that year he gave the 
monks of Melrose a free passage through the lands of these ma- 
nors to their granges in Nithsdale," Dunscore; but, on the ac- 
cession of Bruce, Dalswinton was granted to Walter Stewart, third 
son of Sir John Stewart of Jedworth, and it remained in the pos- 
session of the Galloway family till 1680, when, with some speci- 
fied exceptions, the barony of Dalswinton was disponed to the 
Duke of Queensberry. This estate became afterwards the pro- 
perty of the Maxwells, and about fifty years ago, it was sold by 

4 



KlllKMAIlOE. 57 

« 

them to the late enterprising Patrick Miller, Esq. who made many 
expensive improvements on it. This fine estate, which contains 
5132 imperial acres, and is about a third part of the parish, is now 
the property of James Macalpine Leny, Esq. whose excellent qua- 
lities of character have raised him high in pubhc esteem, and se- 
cured him the affection of all who have the honour of being ac- 
quainted with him. He has tastefully improved upon some of Mr 
Miller's arrangements,— rendered the approach to the mansion- 
house much more convenient,— and adorned its precincts with 
some exquisitely rich and beautiful decorations. 

2. Duncoio or Duncol, so called from the round hill or doon at 
the village, and signifying the same thing with cow or colhill. This 
barony also belonged once to the Cumins. It was forfeited as 
well as Dalswinton on the accession of Bruce, and was bestowed 
on Robert Boyd. In August 1550, Robert Lord Maxwell was re- 
turned to the 20 pound land of Dunkow, in right of his father, 
of the same name and title. From that time it remained in the 
possession of the Nithsdale family till about forty years ago, when 
it was sold to various purchasers, some of whom bought their own 
farms. So indulgent to their tenantry were the Maxwells of Niths- 
dale  It was in this village that King James V. spent the night, 
and where he left his attendants before he paid his angry visit to 
Sir John Charteris of Amisfield, as related by Grose. Until about 
thirty years ago, a large stone marked the site of the cottage where 
the king slept, near the small doon called the Chapel-hill. 

3. Milnhead or Millhead. In May 1700, Bertha, spouse of 
Robert Brown of Bishopton, and heiress of Homer Maxwell of 
Ealbean, was returned as possessing certain lands, specified in 
the document, with the 4s. land of Milnhead. This estate was 
possessed by the family of Brown till, some twenty years ago, 
the late Miss Winefred Brown left it to Frederick Maxwell, 
Esq. and other heirs of entail. It contains 1061 acres, and is 
now in the possession of Henry Maxwell, Esq. one of these heirs, 
and third son of the late Marmaduke Constable Maxwell, Esq. of 
Nithsdale, who was one of the best of landlords, and whose sons, 
three of whom are extensive proprietors, inherit the liberal views 
of their father. 

4. Carnsalloch, the " cairn of the willows," as some have supposed, 
or rather " the cairn of the shallow." In 1550, as appears from a 
return, August 5th of that year, it was in the possession of Robert 
Lord Maxwell. He gave it to Homer Maxwell, a younger son.

DUMFRIES-SIIIRF.. 



with Durrisquhin, now Dalscone, and a L. 5 property within the 
liberties of Dumfries, and the estate was possessed by the Max- 
well family till it was sold to the late Alexander Johnston, Esq. 
about the year 1750. It is now in the possession of his son, the 
learned and accomplished Peter Johnston, Esq. who, at the very 
advanced age of about eighty years, enjoys entire the faculties of 
his vigorous and cultivated mind, and is the delight and the orna- 
inen.t of his social and domestic circle. 

The Earl of Galloway had formerly a large property in this pa- 
rish, and there is still a place distinguished by the name of " Gar- 
lies ;" but the parish is now possessed by a great number of pro- 
prietors, of whose estates and families the limits prescribed to this 
survey preclude a particular description. The proprietors of Dals- 
winton, Carnsalloch, and Milnhead, possess nearly the half of the 
parish, the other part belongs to forty different land-owners. 

Eminent Men. — Under this head the late Patrick Miller, Esq. 
of Dalswinton well deserves to be noticed. His ingenuity and per- 
 severance in applying the wonderful power of steam to the purposes 
of navigation will transmit his name with honour to posterity. 
Patrick Miller, Esq. his eldest son, has published an elaborate 
" Narrative of Facts" on his claim to the invention and practice 
of steam navigation, to which the reader is referred for ample and 
satisfactory information upon this interesting subject. The present 
archdeacon of Calcutta, Daniel Corrie, belongs also to this parish, 
and received his education at the parochial school. His grand- 
father was tenant of Duncow mill, and his father was curate at 
Colsterworth in Lincolnshire. The late Luke Frazer, Esq. of Glen- 
maid, who was so long an able and zealous instructor of youth in 
the High School of Edinburgh, was born at Auchenrath. Mr Al- 
lan Cunningham, well known for his various literary publications, 
is a native of this parish. So also, I may add, is Mr Andrew 
Crichton, author of the Life of Blackadder, History of Arabia, 
&amp;c. It may be noticed also, that Sir Andrew Halliday, physi- 
cian, was in early life a candidate for our parish school at Duncow. 

Parochial Register. — The earliest date of our parish register, 
containing baptisms, marriages, discipline, and division of poors' 
money, is 1725 : it has been always kept with considerable care, 
except during, the last incumbency. For a long time the dissen- 
ters declined to give their names to be inserted, though they had 
the offer of registration free of expense. Even now our registers 
are not entirely full.

Antiquities.— There are several motes in this parish, but they 
are of a circular and British, not of a square and Roman form. 
In the appendix of Dr Singer's Survey of the county, No 18, 
there is notice taken of a Roman road, which is described as 
having passed through the northern part of this parish, and the 
remains of forts, barrows, and tumuh, are still to be recognized 
in several parts of it— In a shoemaker's garden at Duncow an 
urn was lately dug up, with something in it like ashes, but it was 
broken by the spade.-In digging for a foundation to our new 
church, the workmen found a human skeleton lying in a different 
direction from that of other dead bodies in our burying-grounds, 
with its head towards the south, with an axe, very like a common 
one, and a lamina, apparently of iron or steel, like a sword-blade, 
deposited by its left side. The axe handle and the bones when 
touched crumbled into dust, being entirely rotten, and the axe's 
head, and the sword-like blade, were almost totally consumed with 
rust, — " exesa rubigine scabra " 

Mr Allan Cunningham, who spent his boyish days near the 
spot where it stood, remembers to have seen the ruins of Cumin's 
castle at Dalswinton. He says, in a letter to the writer, " when 
Comyn was slain in Dumfries" when Bruce had given him the 
" perilous gash," and Kirkpatrick " had makit sicker" "Bruce, it 
is said, burnt his castle ;" and adds, " that a part of the walls 
was standing in 1792." They were, he says, 12, and, in one 
place, 14, feet thick, and " bits of burnt wood" were still cling- 
ing to them. He notices the old cow-house of Dalswinton as a 
great curiosity, and says, that he had seen it entire, with its 
« heavy stone vault," its " outer door of wrought iron," and 
" its inner door traced with broad iron bars, fastened with iron 
rivets." — " Three distinct hnes of entrenchment" were seen and 
carefully traced by Mr Cunningham and his intelligent father, en- 
compassing " the summit of Moloch hill," above Dalswinton vil- 
lage, when they were measuring the land with a chain. These 
lines were " composed of earth and stone, forming room for an ar- 
my to encamp." He also says, that below, " on the south side of 
the same hill," there had been " defences of the same sort on a 
much smaller scale." 

" The Nith," Mr Cunningham remarks, " instead of circling 
the Sca7ir of Ellisland, and running nigh the Isle, directed its course 
by Bankfoot, and came close to the castle;" and he remembers "a 
pool near the old house of Dalswinton called Comyn's pool, which 



DUMnUES-SHIRK 



belonged to the old water course, and connected itself with the 
back water in the Willow isle, by the way of the Lady's meadow. 
Here Cumin is alleged to have sunk his treasure- chest before he 
went to Dumfries, leaving it in charge of the water sprite. A 
net, it is said, was fixed in this pool, to which a small bell in the 
castle was attached, which rang when a salmon was in the snare " 
" The golden pippins and honey pears" which were produced in 
the orchard, on or near the place once occupied by the notable 
.pool, must not be entirely overlooked. The pippins grew on six " 
remarkable trees : the pears on the same number of trees were no 
less remarkable, and the fruit, for flavour and sweetness, could not 
then be " equalled in any other garden of the district." 

III. — Population. 

The number of parishioners, as far back as the writer can trace 
it, has never been less than lOOO. 

In 1755, it was 1098 

1821, - - . .. 1608 

1831, . - - - 1601 

The number of males by the last census was - 776 

of females, _ _ _ 825 

Upwards of forty persons, old and young, have emigrated to 
America within the last ten years. About 500 reside in villages, 
and about 1100 in the other parts of the parish. 



1. Number of families in the parish, - - - 338 

of families chiefly employed in agriculture, - 152 
chiefly employed in trade, manufactures, or handicraft, 102 

2. The average number of births yearly is about - - - 50 

of deaths, - - - 30 

of marriages, - - - 20 

3. The number of persons at present under 15 years of age, - - 600 

upwards of 70, - - - "10 



There are 4 families who have comparatively large estates ; 
10 or 12, or even more, who may be said to be " of independ- 
ent fortune." Twenty-eight landed proprietors receive each L. 50 
and upwards of annual rent. 

Character and Habits of the People. — The people are generally 
disposed to cleanliness, with respect to dwelling, furniture, food, 
and clothing. They are neat in their dress, and especially in their 
Sunday attire. Their clean and comfortable appearance, as well 
as their devout and becoming deportment in the church on the 
Sabbath day, has often attracted the notice, and received the ap- 
plause, of strangers. The ordinary food of the people consists of 
the different preparations of oatmeal, of potatoes, milk, and flesh 



KIRKMAHOE. 



meat. Tradesmen, such as masons, joiners, blacksmiths, and tai- 
lors, when well employed, live and dress in a very comfortable way 
Weavers of all kinds of home-made clothing, who were once a 
pretty numerous class here, but whose occupation is now almos 
Tone owin to the introduction of the power loom, have, at least 
Tny o thm, been obliged to fall into the ranks of farm-labour- 
rr thus diminishing the comforts of both classes. Our people 
are in general well-informed, sincerely religious, and morally cor- 
rect. Few of them are ever guilty of gross offences agamst jus- 
tice, charity, or temperance. 

IV. — Industry. 
Anricullkre and Rural Economy. is properly an agricul- 
tural parish, and perhaps produces more food for nian, according 
to its extent, than any other parish in the county. The lower part 
of it has been called " the trough of Nith" which may be/r..Zy 
translated com-chest or granary. That river, as viewed from the 
heights above Dalswinton village, presents the form of an immense , 
corn sickle, with the back of its crescent, or curve, turned to Cow- 
hill, and with its handle stretching up towards Isle and Elhsland, 
and may suggest to the imagination of the classical spectator the rich 
harvests which are yearly reaped on its fertile banks. A thousand 
acres of arable land lie along the river, and about 10,000 acres ot 
the parish are occasionally under the plough. This was the case, 
at least, not above five or six years ago ; but some reckon that there 
are not many more than 8000 acres now of that description, the 
ground in some parts being considered as paying better in pasture 
than in tillage. About 500, or perhaps near 600, acres are in wood, 
and 400 of these are on the estate of Dalswinton. There are 
4000 acres which have never been cultivated; of these, 200 at least ' 
might, by the judicious " application of capital, be added to the 
cultivated land of the parish." On the remainder, nature seems 
to have pronounced her veto, and doomed it to continue under per- 
petual servitude in her own hand. A considerable portion of ground 
is occupied by single trees, and by trees standing together, to the 
number of two or three. 

Rent of Land.— The average rent is 19s. per acre; the average 
rent of grazing is L. 3 per ox, if fed in winter with fodder ; L. 5 
per cow; 12s. per sheep, if winter fed; but a sheep may be pas- 
tured for 5s. per annum. The gross rental of the parish is from 
L. 9000 to L. 10,000 a year. 



62 



DUMFlllES-SHIRR, 



Rate of Wages. — A man-servant maintained in the family gets 
from L. 5 to L. 7 in the half year, and a female from L. 2 to L. 3, 
3s. The farm-servant, called a benefit man, has a cottage and 
kitchen garden, a pint of skimmed milk per day, 30 cwt. of po- 
tatoes, also his fuel led home, and about L. 20 in money. When 
he maintains himself and his family, he receives from L. 22 to 
L, 25. A labourer, per day, receives from 1st March to 1st No- 
vember, Is. 6d., and for the remainder of the year. Is. 3d., with- 
out victuals. Mowers, without victuals, receive per day from 2s. 
to 2s. 6d. ; and with victuals. Is. 6d. Joiners get in summer from 
Is. 6d. to 2s. per day, and masons the same. Smiths generally 
contract with farmers at L. 2, 10s. per annum, to keep a plough and 
the iron work of a pair of horses in good order, finding the iron, 
as well as performing the work, but when there is no contract, each 
piece of work is charged separately. 

Breeds of Live Stock. — The common breed of sheep is the Che- 
viot breed, crossed by Leicester rams. About 70 or 80 scores of 
lambs ai-e annually raised on the hill grounds ; and in most of the 
farms, the calves are sold to the fleshers of Dumfries when about six 
weeks old, at from 30s. to 40s. each, according to the quality of the 
veal. It is becoming a practice here to buy Highland draught 
ewes, and bring them to the lower grounds, — to take the lambs 
from the ewes, and send them to Liverpool, and to fatten the ewes 
for the same market. 

Husbandry. — The alternate system of husbandry is prevalent 
with us ; viz. oats from lea ; fallows of potatoes and turnips, the lat- 
ter fed off by sheep ; wheat or barley, and sown down with grass 
seeds ; one or more years lying in grass, as the subdivisions of the 
farm will permit. Some tenants prefer a crop of barley after 
wheat ; but this is generally considered as bad management, and the 
practice is fast falling into disuse. The following order of hus- 
bandry has also been obligingly communicated to the writer, and 
is approved by very competent judges in our parish. For holm 
land, first year, oats ; second year, part potatoes and part turnips, 
the turnips fed off" by sheep; third year, wheat, sown down with grass 
seeds ; fourth year, grass to be cut for hay. For hard land, the two 
first years, the same order as for holm land; the third year, barley, 
sown down with grass seeds; the fourth year, grass, part for cutting, 
and part for pasture. Irrigation is used only to a small extent, but 
surface draining is much practised, and is found very useful ; but 
by sending off" the water from the pastures, our rivulets are pro-

portionally swelled. The Nith sometimes threatens to break mto 
our tine corn-fields, but they are well defended agamst " the horn- 
ed flood" by strong and expensive embankments and fences ot va- 
rious forms and materials, constructed and executed with all the 
skill which science could furnish, and with every auxdiary of art. 

The general duration of leases is fifteen years, but some farms 
are let for nineteen, and some for only seven years. Our proprie- 
tors appear to take delight in seeing the dwelling-houses on their 
respective properties neat and comfortable, and even elegantly com- 
modious, and all their office-houses suitable and substantial. 1 he 
principal improvements of a general nature are, the feeding of sheep 
with turnips, which is more practised now in this parish than it was 
in the whole countv thirty years ago ; thrashing-machines, intro- 
duced by the late Mr Miller of Dalswinton, who also made us ac- 
quainted with the ruta baga ; iron ploughs; and the use of bone ma- 
nure. The most approved plans of husbandry have been eagerly 
adopted and ardently prosecuted by our agriculturists, who form a 
numerous and respectable body of the population. It would be dif- 
ficult to do any thing like justice to those individuals who have re- 
claimed waste lands, and made the wilderness a corn or grass field, 
or a green wood ; who have thus graced our hills and moors with in- 
delible memorials of their industry and perseverance. The late 
Patrick Miller, Esq. of Dalswinton ; the late William Allan, Esq. 
of Newlands; James Dinwiddie, Esq. of Whitehall; Joseph Bell, 
Esq. of Netherhall; Joseph Mitchell, Esq. of Whitestanes ; John 
Morin, Esq. of Carzield, deserve to be particularly noticed. Un - 
der the animating auspices of our landlords, the parks and fields 
in the lower grounds have of late assumed an improved appearance, 
and cultivation has ascended our heights as far as she could urge 
her way. The moor-cock, with his frighted covey, fled at the start- 
ling sound of fervent industry, and, from his rocky retreats, crowed 
defiance to the tyrants that would encroach on his wild domain, or, 
in moody melody, deplored the abridgement of his ancient bounds  

Produce. — The average gross amount and value of raw produce 
yearly raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as 
follows : — 

Grain of all kinds, _ . . - - L. 13,500 0 0 

Potatoes, turnips, &amp;c. with the gross produce of green crop, hay 
pasture, and the stock fed thereon, _ - - 6,500 0 0 

L. 20,000 0 0

DUMFlllES-SIIIRE. 



V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Town. — Dumfries is the nearest market-town, and is 
scarcely two miles distant from the south part of the parish. We 
have no post-offices ; but a runner, or penny-post, to carry letters 
to and from the town might be useful. A spacious public road 
runs, almost six miles, in a longitudinal way through the parish. 
The bridges and fences are kept in good repair. 

Ecclesiastical State. — It appears from ancient records, that " Da- 
vid 11. granted to the monks of Arbroath the church of St Quin- 
tin of Kirkmaho, in the diocese of Glasgow." This grant, how- 
ever, seems never to have been effectual, at least as to the pa- 
tronage, for that " continued to belong to the Stewarts," who suc- 
ceeded the Cumins in the barony " of Dalswinton. In 1429, the 
rectory of Kirkmaho was constituted one of the prebends of the 
bishoprick of Glasgow, with the consent, however, of Marion Stew- 
wart, the heiress of Dalswinton, and of Sir John Forrester, her se- 
cond husband, and of William Stewart, her son and heir ; she and 
her heirs continued to be patrons of this rectorial prebend. At the 
Reformation, the rectory of Kirkmaho was held by John Stewart, 
the second son of the patron, Sir Alexander Stewart of Garlies. In 
the seventeenth century, the patronage of Kirkmaho passed, with 
the barony of Dalswinton, from the Earl of Galloway to the Earl of 
Queensberry. It continued in the Queensberry family through- 
out the eighteenth century, and in 1810 passed to the Duke of 
Buccleuch and Queensberry." f 

The parish church was built twelve years ago, a little farther to 
the north than the old church, and stands exactly four miles distant 
from the cross of Dumfries. It is a comely Gothic structure, and, 
amidst the trees of the churchyard and vicinity, it makes a very 
graceful appearance. Its situation, however, is far from being con- 
venient for a part of the population. It has no seats peculiarly 
appropriated to the poor. 

The manse was built in 1799, and has had almost no repair hi- 
therto. The glebe contains about eight acres of good land. 

The stipend, by the last augmentation, commencing with crop 
and year 1825, is 16 chalders, half meal half barley, payable in 
money, according to the highest fiars prices of the county, yield- 
ing, upon an average of the last seven years, about L. 275 ; besides 
L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements.

KIRKMAHOE. 



65 



At Quarrelwood there is a dissenting meeting-house belonging 
to the Cameronian Presbyterians ; but, for some years past, di- 
vine service has been seldom performed in it, as the hearers have 
a new chapel in Dumfries, where attendance is more convenient for 
them. There are 1600 parishioners in Kirkmahoe ; and of these 
perhaps 20 are Cameronians, — 20 or 30 more, perhaps, attend 
different meeting-houses in Dumfries ; all the rest profess to at- 
tend the parish church, and are in that respect, on the whole, very 
exemplary. The writer records this circumstance with much and 
heartfelt satisfaction. The average number of communicants may 
be 600 ; and about 30 communicate for the first time at the cele- 
bration of the Lord's Supper every summer, on the first Sunday 
of July. 

Education. — There are three schools in this parish, whose mas- 
ters receive each a part of the parochial salary, — one at the village 
of Duncow, the master of which school receives an yearly salary oi 
L. 25, 13s. 3d.; another in Dalswinton village, whose salary is 
L. 17 ; and there is a third school in a remote corner of the parish, 
to which is appropriated the yearly sum of L. 8, Os. 6|d. Besides 
these there are two or three private schools. Two well-disposed 
females teach a few young girls to sew and to read. Latin and 
Greek, and the practical branches of mathematics, are occasionally 
taught in our schools. The total amount of school fees received 
at the three parochial schools is probably about L. 120. The ac- 
commodation of none of the public teachers is so comfortable as 
could be wished. 

Library. — A parish library was opened in the school-house of 
Duncow, under the auspices of the present minister, on the 1st day 
of January 1800, and for some years the concern flourished; but 
by degrees it languished, and at last expired. Books were so nume- 
rous in private houses, and so easily to be gotten from the pub- 
lic libraries of Dumfries, that we allowed this parish light to go 
out. 

The average number of poor on the session-roll is 28. It was 
22 fifty years ago. L. 2, on an average, are given yearly to each 
pauper from the church collections ; and L. 2, 10s. or more, when 
other sources are taken into the account. No other methods have 
yet been employed to provide for the poor, besides the collections 
and the interest of our mortified money, amounting to L. 500. 
Withm these last few years, some poor persons have been heard 
saying, in a bold tone, that « the rich are obliged to maintain the 

DUMFRIES. p

poor." If absent heritors do not contribute their parts in aiding 
the parish funds, and if voluntary contributions are not generally 
and liberally supported, some legal assessment, it is feared, must 
soon become more general. 

Alehouses.— We have four alehouses, where spirits are sold. 
The half of the number would be sufficient ; but it is right to ad- 
mit, that the houses are kept in an orderly manner. 

PweZ.— The fuel generally used is peat and coals ; the latter 
are brouo-ht from the collieries at Sanquhar, Kirkconnel, and Mans- 
field, and also more frequently from the coal-vessels at Dumfries, 
which import them in large quantities from the coast of Cumber- 
land. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

A very general change has taken place in the condition and 
aspect of this parish within these last forty years. Property has 
been much divided, and the purchasers of the divisions have been 
emulously diligent in improving them. New and neat villas have 
arisen on every side ; polished farms and thriving plantations adorn 
the prospect ; and the eye is delighted with the most tasteful forms 
of sylvan decoration, and with all the signs of a highly improved 
style of rural economy. nn e 

A survey was made by Mr Smeaton, as far back as 1754, lor a 
canal to commence at the Frith of Solway, and to terminate at the 
lower end of this parish ; and a railway was projected by an able 
engineer, to stretch from Sanquhar to the middle, at least, of Kirk- 
mahoe. These and such like plans, if executed, no doubt would 
be attended with great advantage not only to this, but also to the 
neighbouring parishes. A distillery on a judicious and moderate 
scale has lately been erected at Glencarrick in this parish, above 
Duncow, and near Whitehall, on the banks of the romantic rivu- 
let already noticed as remarkable for its rocky recesses and tiny 
Niagaras, and is in full and prosperous operation. It furnishes 
a convenient market for our farm produce and that of the neigh- 
bourhood, and also generates a very nutritive and agreeable kind 
of food for fattening cattle.

PRESBYTERY OF EftCHMABEN, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. JAMES SMAIL, MINISTER. 
THE REV. H. DOBIE, ASSISTANT.  



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name and Boundaries. — The parish, known by the above title, 
consists of the original cure of Kirkmichael, and the greater part 
of the old parish of Garrel,f which were united about 1674. The 
derivation of the name Kirkmichael is evidently from St Michael, 
to whom the church was dedicated. Garrel is a vulgar abbrevia- 
tion of Garvald or Garwald, signifying in the Scoto-Irish, the 
rough rivulet ; an appellation which is very frequent in the North 
British topography, and which here applies to the rivulet that runs 
in a very stony channel past the old church. 

The united parish is elliptical in form, and extends 9 miles 
in length, and 4| in extreme breadth. It is bounded on the north 
by Kirkpatrick-Juxta; on the north-east and east by Johnstone; on 
the south by Lochmaben and Tinwald; and on the west by Kirk- 
mahoe and Closeburn. 

Topographical Appearances. — There are two ranges of moun- 
tains in this parish, stretching nearly north and south, the one si- 
tuate between the small river Ae and Glenkiln-burn, and the other 
between Glenkiln-burn and the lower grounds. The hill of Hole- 
house, on the northern part of the first range, is about 1500 feet 
above the level of the sea; Woodhill, on the south, about 1250; 
Knock-craig, at the head of the second range, about 1400 ; and 

" This account has been drawn up by Mr Dobie, Assistant Minister. 

t The lands of Rachills, the elegant seat of J. J. Hope Jolnistone, Esq. M. P., 
the two Minnygaps, Mollins, Crunzie-town, and Hartfield, now annexed to the pa- 
rish of Jolinstone, formerly belonged to Garrel — See Act. Pari. vii. 644, a. d. 16G9, 
entitled, " Ratification in favour of Sir John Dalzicl of Glenae, and Robert, his son, 
of all and haiU the lands of Raehills, and others therein mentioned, lyinir mthiu the 
parocMn of Garrel." 



68 DUMFRIES-SHTRE. 

Kirkmicliael-fell, at the other extremity, about 1100 feet. The 
southern part of the parish is, in general, level ; though there are 
several rising grounds interspersed, which descend, by a gradual 
declivity, towards the farm of Cumrue, at the southern extremity, 
about 190 feet above the level of the sea. 

Climate.— The quality of the soil of this parish,— the conti- 
guity of the mountains before-mentioned,— and the rivers and 
burns by which it is bounded and intersected,— render the air in ge- 
neral rather moist. But from the rapidity of the waters, m conse- 
quence of the very considerable declivity of the ground, the air is 
frequently changed, and not permitted to stagnate. The inhabit- 
ants are in general remarkably healthy. When a severe epidemic 
disease prevailed last season to a fearful extent in Dumfries, which 
is only eight miles distant, there was not a single instance of infec- 
tion in the whole of this parish. 

Hydrography.— There are several veins of ironstone and ochre 
in the parish, and consequently many springs of chalybeate water; 
but none of a strength so remarkable as to deserve particular no- 
tice. There are two lochs or lakes, the one on the summit of the first 
mountain range, called Crane Loch,— one acre in extent, and very 
deep • the other, called Cumrue Loch, on the farm of that name,— 
four acres in extent, and fourteen feet in depth. This loch formerly 
comprehended ten or twelve acres, but has been reduced by drain- 
ing to its present size. There are two or three small cascades in 
Garrel Water, the largest of which is eighteen feet m height. 

Geology and Mineralogy.— The general direction of the strata 
of the transition rocks, which compose the high ranges of this pa- 
rish, is from north-east to south-west; and their angle of nortb- 
westerly dip with the horizon may- be stated at from 43 to 60 de- 
grees About half a mile from the manse is a rock of alum-slate, 
having interspersed through it iron pyrites. The lower part of this 
parish is of sandstone formation, incumbent on the cropping of the 
basaltic rocks, and ranging, near their junction, almost parallel. 
Its strata there dip towards the south-east, havmg a very consider- 
able inclination. Two miles south of this, at Ross, where it is 
wrought, this rock dips about one in three south-westward, the beds 
stretching from south-east towards north-west. The colour is red. 
The several holms on the banks of the different streams appear to 
have been formed by deposits washed down, in the course ol ages, 
from the higher grounds.

II. — Civil History. 

Land-oioners. — The land-owners are his Grace the Duke of 
Buccleuch; John S. Lyon, Esq. of Kirkmichael; James S. Wight- 
man, Esq. of Courance ; Robert Kennedy, Esq. of Craigshiels ; 
John Swan, Esq. of Glenkiln; WilHam Robson, Esq. of Hazhe- 
brae; Patrick Campbell, Esq. of Lawers; and Henry Constable 
Maxwell, Esq. of Milnhead. The Duke of Buccleuch draws L. 150 
per annum above the half of the present rental. Mr Lyon's estate 
is next in extent and value. The others are stated above in the 
order which corresponds to the valued rent of their properties. 

Parochial Registers.— 'o parochial registers appear to have been 
kept prior to the year 1727 ; and those from 1727 to 1759 are very 
imperfect. Since the latter period they have been better attended 
to, but are confined entirely to births. 

Antiquities. — On a bank, which is washed by the rivulet of Gar- 
rel, may be seen the ruins of the church bearing that name, with 
its accompanying cemetery. Garvald was rebuilt in 1617 ; but, 
from the time of its annexation to Kirkmichael, has been allow- 
ed to fall into decay. The church-yard, however, is surrounded 
by a stone and lime wall, with a plantation of weeping-birches, 
and other trees suited to the place. 

The only Roman work in the parish is a branch of the great 
road, that led from Netherby, in Cumberland, to the chain of forts, 
built by Lollius Urbicus, between the Forth and the Clyde. This 
can still be traced through a moss, and seems to have terminated 
at a castellum, of which two sides still remain very distinct, and 
which now forms the minister's garden. 

On the farm of Wood is the ruin of the old tower of Glenae, 
which, in 1666, gave the title of Baronet to a branch of the family 
of Dalzell, before its succession to the earldom of Carnwath. 

There are several indistinct remains of ancient fortifications ; but 
no traditions about any of them, except a small fort, commonly 
called Wallace's Tower, adjoining Tor-linn, a glen filled with na- 
tural oak, and stretching westward from Knockwood. This fort 
commands an extensive view to the south, occupying the summit 
of an angle formed by the junction of two branches of that steep 
ravine ; and being protected on its third side by a large fosse, it 
must have been in former times, before the general use of fire-arms, 
a strong place of defence. Sir William Wallace, while meditating 
the capture of the castle of Lochmaben in 1297, is said to have kept 
sixteen men there, with whom he sallied forth to annoy the English

gan-ison under Greystock and Sir Hugh of Moreland. Having taken 
some of their horses, the Scottish hero was pursued to Tor-head, a 
name descriptive of the situation, the Celtic Tor signifying mount, 
by Moreland, who, in the encounter which ensued, was slain, with 
several of his followers. A large stone, named " sax corses," 
i. e. six corpses, a short way distant, marks the burial place of the 
vanquished. Greystock, enraged at this defeat, and strengthened 
by fresh supplies from England, immediately proceeded to attack 
Wallace with 300 men. Thus overpowered by numbers, he fell 
back among the hills ; and being joined by Sir John Graham of 
Dundaff with thirty men, and Kirkpatrick, his kinsman, with twen- 
ty of his retainers, was overtaken on the north border of the lands 
of Holehouse, near the bottom of Queensberry, where a general 
engagement took place. Greystock fell ; the victory was complete ; 
and the survivors seeking shelter in the wood from which they had 
pursued the Scots, Wallace reached Lochmaben before them, and 
took possession of the castle. A cairn, as was then usual, has 
been raised on the field of battle, where may be seen the long flat 
stones, set on edge in the form of graves, believed to surround the 
remains of the dead. A stream runs from the place, called " Dis- 
comfit Gutter." A moss brow, bearing the name of " Graham's 
hag," is at a short distance ; as is hkewise " Bledy-gill," ei- 
dently a corruption of Bloody-gill. 

About the year 1785, there was found, in a small piece of peat- 
moss near the line of the old Roman road, a pretty large pot, of a 
sort of base copper, and a decanter of the same metal, of the shape 
and size of our white stone quart decanters, with 3 feet about 1 1 
inch long. They were both sent by Dr Burgess, then minister 
of the parish, to the Society of Antiquarians at Edinburgh, and are 
in their museum. They were thought to be Roman. They 
might have been thrown into the place where they were found 
when the Romans left the castellum, perhaps pursued by the na- 
tives, and obliged to abandon their heavy luggage to expedite their 
flight. 

Last summer, another antique of similar metal, capable of con- 
taining 13 imperial gills, with 3 feet 2i inches in length, and al- 
together 10 inches in height, having a handle and spout, and 
somewhat resembling in shape a modern coffee-pot, was dug up 
in a place called Car's moss, near the mains of Ross, In that 
moss are the vestiges of a small British station, from which it pro- 
bably takes the ancient British or Celtic etymon of Car or Caer,

meaning yr. Not far from the same spot was found, several 
years ago, a large round leaden dish, which contained two pieces 
of iron, much corroded, resembling a mason's trowel and tool. 
This led to the supposition that it had been used for holding mor- 
tar. A hole was pierced on each side, to which a handle might 

have been fastened. 

A number of small silver coins of Alexander III. of Scotland, 
and Edward I. of England, were discovered upon the 10th No- 
vember 1821, in a piece of soft ground, about half way between 
Nether- Garrel and Courance. A year or two afterwards, nearly 
a quarter of a mile from the same place, was found a small silver 
coin of James 1. of Scotland. Several of these coins, and the 
brazen decanter found lately, as described above, are in possession 
of one of the heritors. 

Many of the ancient circular British encampments appear in 
the parish. Upon some of these being opened, ashes have been 
found ; likewise several broken querns, or hand-mills, formerly used 
for grinding corn ; and in one of them, upon the farm of Gilrig, 
with a partition crossing it, and which seems to have been occupied 
during later times, there was dug out a sword having a basket-hilt, 
but so much covered with rust, that it was impossible to form any 
accurate opinion respecting its antiquity. There was also seen a 
number of pipes of burnt clay, with heads somewhat smaller than 
that of the tobacco-pipe now in use, swelled at the middle, and 
straiter at the top. 

Modern Buildings. — A very handsome and elegant mansion- 
house has been erected by Mr Lyon, on his estate of Kirkmichael, 
and is just finished. It is built in the old manorial style, after a 
plan made by Mr Burn of Edinburgh. It is surrounded by a very 
considerable extent of fine old timber, and the pleasure-grounds 
are embellished by beautiful flower-gardens, and two fine artificial 
pieces of water. Mr Lyon has also made a very excellent walled 
garden and hot-house. 

There are two mills in the parish ; one, upon the barony of 
Ross, for oats, wheat, and barley ; and another, upon the estate 
of Kirkmichael, adapted merely for oats and barley. 

III. — Population. 

The amount of the population of the parish cannot be traced 
any farther back than 1759. At that time, the number of inha- 
bitants was 730 : in 1791, it was 950. The increase was supposed 



72 



DUMFBIES-SHIRE. 



to be owing to the division and cultivation of a very large common, 
and the improvement of other lands. In 1801, the population was 
reduced to 904. The decrease was probably occasioned by a prac- 
tice, then becoming prevalent, of leading farms, as it was called ; 
that is, a farmer having one farm, possessed, at the same time, an- 
other, which was said to be led along with it. By this means, se- 
veral farms, formerly having numerous families residing on them, 
were, when thus led along with others, left almost uninhabited. 
At each census, "since that period, there has been a gradual increase, 
which would perhaps have been much greater, had it not been for 
the change which has taken place by the enlargement of many of 
the farms. In 1831 the population was 1226.

parochial burdens. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Economy — The whole of the parish has 
been surveyed, and plans made of the several farms, at different 
times, and by different land-measurers. The number of acres 
standard and imperial measure is as follows. 

Meadow and arable land, 6700 Acres. 

Sheep pasture, - - - - _ - - 9190 

Mossy pasture interspersed through the arable lands, partly convertible 
into meadow, and including the mosses from which the inhabitants 
are supplied with peat, - . _ - - 550 

Sand-bed pasture, comprehending roads, lakes, and water-courses, - 280 
Under wood, natural or planted, - - - 

17070 

Probably 300 or 400 acres of this hill land might be advanta- 
geously broken up, fallowed, and thereafter sown down with grass 
seeds, to improve the pasture. 



KIRKMICHAEL. 



7B 



The natural woods consist principally of oak, ash, birch, and 
elder. The young plantations are composed of Scotch, larch, and 
spruce firs, with a°sufficiency of oak, ash, and elm, for standards. 

Rent of Land.— The average rent per acre of meadow and arable 
land is 14s. 6d. ; of sheep pasture, 3s. ; of mossy pasture inter- 
spersed through the arable lands, partly convertible into meadow, 
and including the mosses from which the inhabitants are suppKed 
with peat,  4s. ; of sand-bed pasture which, after deducting 130 
acres for roads, lakes, and water-courses, will be reduced to 150 
acres, L. 1. 

The average rent of grazing cattle is at the rate of 25s. for a 
one year old; 35s. for a two years old; and L. 4 for a cow or full- 
grown ox ; and at the rate of 4s. 9d. for a ewe, or full-grown sheep, 
pastured for the year. 

Breeds of Live Stock. — The cattle are all of the Galloway breed. 
Turnips are cultivated to such an extent, that 2200 Cheviot and 
Highland wedders, inclusive of several score of half-bred hogs, 
are annually fattened upon them. 

Husbandry. — The system of husbandry pursued is, in some 
cases, a six, and in others a four years' rotation. Since 1822, when 
the old leases terminated, very great, judicious, and expensive 
improvements have been made by the Duke of Buccleuch, on his 
beautiful and valuable barony of Ross, in this parish, by building 
very excellent and even elegant farm-steadings, containing every 
accommodation of the most convenient and substantial kind that 
a farmer can desire ; planting both for shelter and ornament ; en- 
closing, partly with stone dikes, but principally with hedges ; mak- 
ing roads, and giving every encouragement to promote and ex- 
tend the cultivation of the land. There is no part of the country, 
through which a traveller can pass, where he will be more delighted 
with a view of the rapid progress of very spirited and substantial 
improvements. Such are the invaluable advantages which a dis- 
trict derives from being blessed with a liberal and patriotic land- 
lord. 

The duration of leases is, in some cases, 15, in others 19 years. 
The greater part of the farm-buildings on the other properties in 
the parish is new and of a superior description. The hedges 
that have lately been planted are very extensive ; and are all in a 
thriving state, being well attended to. 



• Much mossy land has already been reclaimed, and now yields good crops of hay.

Rate of Wages. — Men employed in husbandry labour receive 
Is. 6d. per day in summer and Is. 3d. in winter, and women 9d. 
per day, without victuals. Men-servants, who are fit for every kind 
of husbandry work, and are boarded in the house, receive, on an 
average L. 5 in the half year, and women-servants from L. 2, 10s. 
to L. 3. Masons and joiners generally charge 2s. 6d. per day. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Towns, 8fc. — There are no towns or villages in the pa- 
rish. Lockerby is distant from Cumrue five miles to the south- 
east ; but Dumfries, which is fully seven miles from the bridge of 
Ae southward, is the market-town most frequented. The length 
of turnpike road, crossing the parish, is nearly five miles. The 
mail-coach from Edinburgh to Dumfries travels along it twice 
daily. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The patronage of the old parish of Kirk- 
michael has belonged to the noble house of Queensberry since 
the Reformation, and is now held by the Duke of Buccleuch. 
There belonged to this church, during the reign of Catholicism, 



KIRKMICHAEL. 



75 



three merk lands of the old extent, now the property of Mr Lyon. 
Garvald was of old a mensal church of the bishops of Glasgow; 
and Robert Blackadder, the first archbishop of that see, in 1506, 
assigned this rectory to the college of Glasgow. The patronage 
thereof at the Reformation belonged to the convent of Red 
Friars at Failfurd, in the county of Ayr ; was thereafter vested in 
the Crown ; and, so far as is known, remains so, although it has 
not for a long period been exercised by the king. The church 
lands of Garrel, extending to five pound lands of the ancient va- 
luation, in 1565, exclusive of the glebe united by excambion to 
that of Kirkmichael, passed from that convent into lay lands, and 
are now mostly comprehended within the barony of Ross. 

The present parish church is near the south-western boundary ; 
a situation not at all convenient for the greater part of the popu- 
lation, being fully five miles from the opposite side and southern 
extremity. It was built in 1815, and is in good repair. It con- 
tains sittings for upwards of 500. The manse was built in 1798, 
and has since that time undergone several repairs. The glebe is 
about 18 imperial acres in extent, and may be valued at L. 18 a- 
year. The stipend is 15 chalders, half meal, and half barley, and 
L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements, amounting, at the county 
fiars' price of the seven years preceding the augmentation 5th 
December 1821, to L. 232, Os. d. There being no place of 
worship in the parish but the Established church, it is attended by 
all the inhabitants, except about 30, who are dissenters. Divine 
service is generally well attended. The average number of com- 
municants is 330. 

Education. — There are two schools in the parish, the principal 
one being placed near the centre of the greatest population. The 
branches of instruction generally taught are English, writing, arith- 
metic, Latin, Greek, and geometry. The salary of this school is 
the maximum, viz. L. 34, 4s. 4|d., and the fees amount to about 
L. 16 per annum. The teacher has considerably more than the 
legal accommodations with respect to a dwelling-house and garden. 
No salary is attached to the side-school. The master of it is paid 
entirely by fees received from the scholars, which are the same as 
those of the parochial school. 

The - people are in general alive to the benefits of education. 
There are none above fifteen years of age idiots excepted who 
cannot read. Two sheep-farms on the north-western side of the 
parish are about six miles distant from these schools. But the po-

pulation in that quarter is small, and there is access to a side-school 
in the neighbouring parish of Closeburn. 

Poor and Parochial Funds— The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is 20, and the average sum allotted to 
each per year is L. 1, 4s. There are no legacies or mortifications. 
The annual amount of church collections, with small fines exacted 
from dehnquents, and other dues, is about L. 35, 3s. 10 d. Se- 
veral persons, not on the poors' roll, obtain occasional relief. It is 
still with reluctance that the necessitous are induced to apply for 
parochial assistance. But it is easy to perceive that the spirit of 
independence by which the lower classes in this country have been 
so long distinguished, is here, as in other places, exhibiting symp- 
toms of decay. 

It may be remarked, in concluding, that the rental of the parish, 
when the former Statistical Account was drawn up, was L. 2500, 
and that at present it amounts to L. 6475 jpeY annum.

PRESBYTERY OF PENPONT, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. ANDREW BENNET, MINISTER. 



1. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Boundaries, c— Closeburn, to which the extensive pa- 
rish of Dalgarno was united in the end of the seventeenth century, 
was anciently called Kilosbern, from Cella Oshurni. It is 10 
miles in extreme length, and 7- in extreme breadth. It is bound- 
ed on the north by Morton and Crawfurd, on the east by Kirk- 
michael and Kirkpatrick-Juxta, on the south by Kirkmahoe, and 
on the west by Keir, from which it is separated by the river Nith. 
From the great quantity of secondary sandstone strata, and water- 
worn gravel, to the depth in many parts of nearly 20 feet, the 
valley of Closeburn, comprehending, besides the western part of 
this parish, portions of other parishes,, has in all probabihty been 
a lake, the water issuing from its lower level, or south extremity, 
having in the course of time worn away the restraining barrier. 
In confirmation of this opinion I may mention, that the rising 
grounds at the south end of the valley are separated from each 
other by the channel of the Nith. What must have been the 
bottom of the lake is a fine alluvial or carse soil. The higher le- 
vel of the 'parish, before the ascent of the transition hills, is in ge- 
neral water-worn gravel upon freestone. 

Topographical Appearances. — The valley of Closeburn is one 
of the valleys situated in the mountain range, chiefly of transition 
rock, which runs across the island from the German to the Atlan- 
tic Ocean. The highest hill in the parish is Queensberry, the 
summit of which is 2140 feet above the sea. It was called Queens- 
berry, not, as has been supposed, from a species of berry which 
grows upon it, but from the Anglo-Saxon, herg, a hill, which is 
often formed into berry. It is most appropriately designated the 
queen of hills, being one of the highest in the south of Scotland. 
Climate. — It might be supposed that the proximity of this dis- 



78 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



trict to the Atlantic Ocean, and the prevalence of the south and 
south-west winds, would render the climate rainy and variable. 
Although it be not so dry as some districts of Scotland, the co- 
pious exhalations from this vast reservoir of water are in some 
measure intercepted, and the violence of these winds moderated 
by the interposition of Galloway and the north of Ireland. For 
mildness of climate, its situation is pecuHarly favourable. Besides 
having- a southern aspect, the ranges of hills that environ it on the 
north and east afford shelter from those cold and piercing winds 
that predominate in spring, and annoy other parts of the kingdom. 
The salubrity of the climate may, to a certain extent, be ascribed 
to the improved system of agriculture and draining introduced a 
considerable number of years ago. From that cause intermittent 
fevers have now entirely disappeared. As a proof of the salubrity 
of the climate I may mention, that of 28 individuals who died in 
1831, 20 had attained to upwards of 70 years of age. Pulmonary 
complaints, however, are not uncommon in this district; and cases 
of inflammation occasionally occur. 

Hydrography. — The water is in general extremely pure, as it 
flowa from springs running through freestone, limestone, and tran- 
sition rock. The only foreign ingredient some of the springs con- 
tain, is a little iron in solution by carbonic acid. In the imme- 
diate vicinity of Closeburn Castle, a spring issuing from a peat- 
moss is impregnated vdth a small quantity of sulphuretted hydro- 
gen, and has been of signal advantage in cutaneous complaints. 
The river Nith forms the western boundary ; and the Cample 
forms the northern boundary of the parish. There are several 
streams, the most remarkable of which is Crickup. By falling over 
a precipice 90 feet in height, it forms a cascade, known by the 
name of Grey's mare's tail. After heavy rains, it has the appear- 
ance of an unbroken sheet of water, and is seen at the distance of 
many miles. This stream, possessing some romantic scenery, is 
visited by strangers. The place of the greatest interest is Crick- 
up Linn. The water in its passage over a hill of old red sandstone 
has in the course of ages cut a deep ravine, so narrow at the top, 
that in many places one may leap across it. The sides of this 
ravine, overhung by rich foliage, and presenting rocks of the most 
picturesque forms, the noise and agitation of the water underneath, 
produce a singularly imposing effect. To this spot covenanters in 
the times of persecution betook themselves for safety. The author 
of Waverley has given it additional interest, by describing it as a

Geoloqy and Miner alogy.-T\ve strata in the parish of Close- 
burn, forming a part of a considerable basin of strata ten miles m 
lenoth, and nearly four in breadth, arise in a south-eastern direc- 
tion, and dip to the north-west and west. The prevaihng rocks 
are transition rock or greywacke, transition limestone, a coarse 
oray quartzy freestone and old red sandstone, of which the moun- 
tains, hills, and plains are composed. The red sandstone is the 
uppermost stratum in the low parts of the valley, and is nearly 
three miles in width from the river Nith, in an eastern direction. 
From under the red sandstone the gray freestone rises nearly a 
mile in width in the same direction; in some places the transition 
limestone; and last of all, the transition rocks, upon which the 
foregoing strata are deposited, rise to the height of 1200 feet above 
the sea. The only genera and species of organic remains are m 
the transition limestone ; they consist of cornua ammonis, lelemnites, 
and orthoceratites, and are the largest found in the island. 

The hmestone quarry worked in the parish, chiefly for agricul- 
tural purposes, consists of two beds. The upper bed is 16 feet 
thick, and is composed of 40 parts of magnesian limestone, and 60 
parts of carbonate of hme, and contains no organic remains. The 
lower bed is 18 feet thick, and contains 88 parts of carbonate of 
lime, 8 of clay and sand, and 4 of iron. It is therefore peculiarly 
well adapted for building, as it takes a strong hand, and hardens 
under water. This lower bed consists of a number of lamina, 
divided by horizontal fissures, between several of which a kind of 
stone marl is interposed, having impressions of shells, apparently 
dissolved. This stone-marl consists of about 10 parts of carbonate 
of lime, and has been successfully employed as a top dressing upon 
the light sandy soils in the neighbourhood. None of the upper 
bed or magnesian limestone is worked, as it is a long time before 
it loses its caustic quahties, by the absorption of carbonic acid. It 
is found to heave or loosen the soil when used for the growth of 
corn, and to produce an abundant crop of dai/ nettle,  Lamium 
album. These two beds are separated from each other by about 
18 feet of bastard or impure hmestone, and indurated clay em- 
ployed for making bricks, after undergoing the operation of bruis- 
ing, by passing between cast iron rollers. The alluvial deposits 
are sand from the debris of the old red sandstone, and quartzy free- 
stone and gravel, consisting of water-worn greywacke and basalt, 



80 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



brought down from the upper part of the river Nith. Large blocks 
of granite have been found, although there are no granite moun- 
tains within twenty miles. 

The soil near the Nith, or lowest extremity of the parish, is 
sandy loam : upon a higher level it is a sandy gravel, to the depth 
of upwards of 20 feet, and is well suited for barley and turnip. 
Above the greywacke it is more tenacious and less sandy, but 
equally well suited for the same crops. On this soil, composed 
of the debris of the greywacke, the larch tree arrives at greater 
perfection than the Scotch fir, which prefers a more sandy soil ; 
but upon the red sandstone soil or sandy gravel the larch is liable 
to decay in the heart, and becomes covered with white moss after 
it is planted only a very few years. On the transition rock it is 
healthy and vigorous, and evinces no such symptoms of premature 
disease. The writer is assured by Mr Menteath of Closeburn, that 
the larch tree is found to grow indigenously in Switzerland, but 
never upon the secondary strata. 

II. — Civil History. 

Of the early history of the parish little is known. Of itself the 
parish of Closeburn seems originally to have been of small extent, 
while that of Dalgarno comprehended a very considerable terri- 
tory. The former belonged to the abbey of Holyroodhouse, and 
the latter to the abbey of Kelso, and formed part of the patrimony 
and spirituality of these establishments. At the period of the Re- 
formation in Scotland, each parish was provided with a reader, and 
in 1576, we find from the register of assignation and modification 
of ministers' stipends, a minister for the first time established at 
Closeburn.  

The patronage of both churches, as well as most of the territory 
of these parishes, belonged for a very considerable period to the 
family of Kirkpatrick of Closeburn ; although by a ratification in 
Parhament 1594, King James VI. confirmed a charter granted by 
him under the great seal to Sir James Douglas of Drumlangrig, 
Knight, dated in January 1591, " of the advocation and donation 

• The following are the words of the register : — " Closberne — Mr James Ramsa/ 
minister, his stipend, L. 75, 2s. 5d. to be payit out of the third of the personage of 
Kirkmado, &amp;c. 

" John Thomsoune, reidare at Closberne, his stipend, L. 20, with the kirk land, to 
be payit out of the third of Kelso, &amp;c. 

" Dalgarno James Williamsoun, reidar at Dalgarno, his stipend xvjlib, with the 

kirk land," &amp;c.

of the pai-och kirks and parochins of Kirk]ryd, Durisdeir, Glen- 
cairn, Penpont, Mortoun, and Dalgarnok ;" but the grant was thus 
qualified : " Provyding alwayes that the said Sir James sail re- 
signe and renunce the advocatioun and donatioun of the said paroch 
kirk of Dalgarnok, to Thomas Kirkpatrik of Cloisburne, his aris and 
assignayes,"  &amp;c. 

In the year 1606, these churches were united by the General 
Assembly held at Linlithgow, f They continued so till the year 
1648, when the Presbytery of Penpont, after examining the ren- 
tals of both parishes, which were produced to them, and after hear- 
incr the " information anent the condition of the united kirkis of 
Dalgarno and Closeburn, wher ther is two standing kirkis, with ther 
several manses and gleebs," X recommended them to be disjoined 

 Acts of the rarliamcnts of Scotland, iv. 90. 

f On this subject we find in the register quoted above the following entries ; — 
" 1608. Dalgarno Cloisburne, Mr David Rodger, minister, his stipend, iiij. xx lib. 
money, to be payit out of the lordship of Kelso, or ony part therof, be the Lord of 
Kelso, his airis and successouris, &amp;c. and mair viij xx, xvij lib. xvijs. for the service at 
the kirk of Dalgarno, be Sir Thomas Kirkpatrik of Cloisburne, Knicht, takisman of 
Dalgarno. 

" 1613. Cloisburne and Dalgarno, Alexander Flemyng, minister, his stipend, iiij xx 
lib. money, to be payit out of the lordship of Kelso, or onie part therof, be the Lord 
of Kelso, his airis and successouris, &amp;c. and viij xx xvij lib. xvijs. for the service at the 
kirk of Dalgarno, be Sir Thomas Kirkpatrik of Cloisburne, Knicht, takisman of Dal- 
garno, with xxxij lib. out of the prebendaries of Iincluden, to be payit be the takisman 
and parochinaris of Carlaverock." 

\ From this iiiformafion the following is an extract : — " Dalgarno is a pendicle of 
Halyroodhouse. The teinds whereof the minister being payed did belong to the 
Bishop of Edinburch ; hot efter abolitioun of episcopacie wer disponed for mantainans 
of the Castle of Edinburgh. The worth of the lands of this parochin, in stok and teind 
personage and vicai'age, is about 9000 merkis." 

" Closburne is a pendicle of Kelso, the teinds whereof wer a part of the rent of 
the Bishop of Galloway's, hot Episcopacie being now abolished, is assigned to the Col- 
ledge of Gla-sgow. The worth of this parochin, stock and teind personage and vicar- 
age, is about 3000 merkis." — " Inde 12000 merkis."—" The two parochins upon the 
supplication of the heritors to the Assemblie at Linlithgow, in anno 1606, wer judged 
fit to be one congrcgatioun, and the union ratified by Parliament." 

The following, aiv.ong other reasons, are given by the Presbytery for the division 
of those kirks : " 1 . That the said two kirks wer united in the dayes of corruption 
and Episcopacie, to the great detriment and hurt of the church. 2. That the two 
kirks being in rent of slock and teind seventein thousand merks and upwaid, may 
verie convcnientlie affbord maintainancc to two ministers for serving the cure at the 
saids kirks. 3.. The number of communicants being seven hundreth or thereabout, 
may be two flocks, sufficient for two ministers. 4. That the heritours being cited to 
compeir befor the Presbytrie, most part of them compeircd, and could not object any 
relevant reason, in our judgment, quherfor they might not be disjoyncd. 5. That 
the fabrickes of both churches are now in a gud frame, quhilk will not long continue 
if they should rcmaine in the present condition," &amp;c.

forthwith. The parishes continued disunited until the year 1697, 
when Dalgarno was again annexed to Closeburn. 

Accounts of the Parish.— There is a history in manuscript of 
each parish in the presbytery of Penpont, drawn up, above a cen- 
tury ago, by a Mr Rae, minister' of Kirkconneh He has unfor- 
tunately done little more than commence that of Closeburn. 

Eminent Men, -c— Among the literati to whom this parish has 
given birth is the venerable Dr Hunter of St Andrew's, unques- 
tionably the first philologist of the age. 

Few parishes in proportion to their population have furnished 
a larger number of successful candidates for the ministry, there 
being at present no less than nine parochial clergymen of our na- 
tional church to whom this parish has given birth. 

La7id-owners.—The chief land-owner is Mr Stuart Menteath, 
the male representative of the ancient Earls of Menteath. The 
estate of Closeburn after having been for several centuries in the 
possession of the family of Kirkpatrick,  well known in history, 
was purchased by the present family, at the termination of the 
American war, when agricultural improvements may be said to have 
commenced in this part of the country. 

Parochial Registers.— The date of the earliest entry of the pa- 
rochial registers is 1726. From 1754 to 1777, there appears to 
have been no register at all. This omission has been m some 
measure supphed by a register of baptisms, from 1765 to 1776, 
kept by an individual who was church officer, durmg that period, 
for his own use. This httle volume is now in the possession of the 
kirk-session, and in some important cases has furnished the infor- 
mation required. At present, the parochial registers are regular- 
ly kept. There is also an obituary, with a correspondmg register 
of every disease that proves fatal. 

Antiquities.— Chsehmn Castle is a vaulted quadrilateral tower 
about 50 feet high, 33i long, and 451 broad. There is a ground 
floor, the walls of which are 12 feet thick, and three series of apart- 
ments, all separated from each other by arched roofs. An arched 
roof crowns the whole. As it bears no date or inscription, its age 
cannot be correctly ascertained. From the plan of the building, 
and the style of the mouldings of the doors, it cannot be ess than j 
800 years old. It is at present occupied by Mr Menteath s lapd- , 
steward, and is a very comfortable residence.- A few years ago

were to be seen the ruins of a chapel, dedicated to St Patrick, 
which o-ives the name of Kirkpatrick to the farm on which it stood. 

On another farm there are the remains of a vaulted building.— r- 

There are several large cairns, but no account of any of them is 
transmitted to the present times.— Six years ago an urn of coarse 
earthen-ware, about one foot in depth, and nine inches in width, 
filled with human bones, considerably decayed, was found in a piece 
of garden ground belonging to the free school. Beside this urn 
was a smaller one empty, and capable of containing about a 
quart. It was raised nearly entire, but the other, in an attempt to 
raise it, fell to pieces. If they be of Roman manufacture, which 
is very probable, they must have been under ground above 1400 
years. Both of these relicts were deposited in the museum of the 
antiquaries of Scotland. It may be added, that at a small distance 
from these urns, two other deposits of human bones were soon after 
found in a very decayed state. 

Modern Buildings. — The only modern building is Closeburn 
Hall, the seat of Mr Stuart Menteath. It is a large building of 
Grecian architecture, and situated in one of the most beautiful val- 
leys in the south of Scotland. 

III. — Population. 

One of the reasons in the recommendation of the Presbytery of 
Penpont for the disjunction of the parishes of Closeburn and Dal- 
garno was, that " the number of communicants being 700 or there- 
about, may be two flocks sufficient for two ministers." I mention 
this circumstance, as showing that the united parishes were at 
least as populous then as at present. 

In 1755, the population was 999 
In 1791, - , - 1490 
In 1811, - - 1762 
In 1821, - - 1682 
In 1831, - - 1680 

The progressive increase was occasioned partly by extensive 
lime-works which commenced in 1772, and partly by the improve- 
ments of the present proprietor : and the decrease, by these improve- 
ments having been in a great measure completed, which circum- 
stance rendered it necessary for many day-labourers to go else- 
where for employment. The number of the population residing 
in villages is 628, and in the country 1052.

There are 5 landed proprietors of the yearly value of L. 50 and 
upwards. The average number of children in each family is 4. 
There are 2 insane, and 3 fatuous persons. 

Character of the People.— The people in general are sober, 
cleanly, frugal, and industrious ; decent and exemplary in their at- 
tendance on religious ordinances ; peaceable and friendly. They 
enjoy in a reasonable degree the comforts and advantages of so- 
ciety, and are contented with their situation and circumstances. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Econom/.— The number of acres in the 
parish under tillage is 5683, and in pasture 23,006,-4428 of 
which are arable. Although the greater proportion of the ground 
between the river Nith, or western boundary, and the moun- 
tains on the eastern boundary, which fifty years ago was in a state 
of nature and covered witli stunted heath, is brought into culti- 
vation, either for grass or corn,— a considerable extent, perhaps not 
less than 2000 acres, of the higher ground might yet be improved 
permanently for pasture, by means of lime, and would probably 
yield an additional rent of five per cent, for the outlay. There are 
about 1-500 acres of natural woods and plantations. 

The natural woods consist of oak, ash, alder and birch ; and 
the plantations, of oak, ash, elm, beech, Scotch fir, spruce fir, 
and larch. As more attention is paid to thinning the plantations 
in the early stages of their growth than is usual in Scotland they 
are in a very thriving condition. About 1200 of these acres un- 
der wood belong to the chief land-owner. He lately finished cut- 
ting down a plantation of 90 acres of Scotch fir. sixty years old, 
which he disposed of for L. 1 0,000. It grew on the poorest sandy 
■ soil, not worth sixpence per acre, when the trees were planted. 
Rent of Land, c-c— The average rent of arable land per acre 
is L. 1, 5s. and of grazing, is L. 4 per cow grazed, L. 2 per ox, and 
4s. 6d per ewe, or full-grown sheep. 

Rate of Wages.— The wages of a farm male-servant, board m- 
cluded, are L. 20 ; and female-servant L. 13 for the year. When 



CLOSEBURN. 



85 



there is no contract by piece-work the rate of mason, carpenter, 
and other mechanical work, is 2s. 6d. for the day. A day-labourer 
receives Is. 8d. in summer, and Is, 4d. in winter. The price of 
coarse black faced wool is 7s., and of Cheviot wool 15s. per stone 
of 24 lbs. 

Breeds, §-c.— The common breeds of cattle are the Galloway and 
Ayrshrre,'to the improvement of which great attention has been paid. 

Husbandry.— approved course of agriculture followed in 
this parish is, the first year, oats upon newly broken up pasture; 
second year, potatoes, or turnips, consumed by sheep where they 
grow; third year, barley and grass seeds; fourth, hay; the two 
successive years, pasture. Bone-manure is now much used in the  
drill husbandry. It enables the farmer to raise turnips on ground, 
of which he could not otherwise avail himself. Till within these 
ten years, this highly beneficial crop was comparatively little cul- 
tivated in Nithsdale : and perhaps no part of Scotland is better 
adapted for it, and for its being consumed where it grows. The 
soil being porous soon becomes dry after the heaviest rains. Steam 
navigation has given a great stim\dus to this branch of agriculture 
in this part of the country. Fat stock can now be conveyed in six- 
teen or eighteen hours to Liverpool, where there is always a ready, 
market. Before this cheap and easy mode of conveyance was prac- 
tised, Edinburgh and Glasgow were the only markets of which the 
farmer could avail himself, and these were attended with many ob- 
vious disadvantages. The common method adopted in the im- 
provement of waste land is to spread 120 bushels of lime on each 
acre ; then, at the distance of two or three years, to plough it for a 
crop of oats ; then to prepare it with manure for fallow or green 
crop. Sometimes two or three crops are taken from the moorish 
soils. There being a considerable extent of poor moorish land on 
the estate of Closeburn, the proprietor had recourse to the follow- 
ing method of imprQving it, which was attended with complete suc- 
cess : Unwilling to deprive the richer grounds of manure, he com- 
menced operations on a sterile district, by paring and burning the 
surface the first season ; he ploughed it in the autumn and winter, 
and spread on it lime at the rate of 200 bushels per acre in the fol- 
lowing spring; in the month of July he sowed grass seeds York- 
shire fog at the rate of five bushels per acre. This land has re- 
mained in pasture for twenty years, and is let annually at from 12s. 
to 15s. per acre. In its unimproved state it was not worth 2s. 6d. 
The expense of this improvement was about L. 6 per acre. Top-

dressing with lime is found to nearly double the value of land in 
pasture, both in quality and quantity, and is much practised in this 
parish by Mr Menteath. 

The duration of leases is for 13, 15, or 19 years, according to 
the condition of the farm. Half a century ago the farm-houses of 
this parish were cottages built of rough stone and clay mortar, and 
containing generally two, sometimes three apartments, one of which 
was the kitchen. The floors were paved with mud, and the roofs 
destitute of ceiling. Such miserable buildings have been succeed- 
ed by comfortable and commodious dwelling-houses, generally of 
two stories, and in every way fitted for the convenience and accom- 
modation of the respectable tenantry that inhabit them. The cot- 
tages of the peasantry are, with scarcely an exception, superior to 
the dwelling-houses fifty years ago, on farms now let at L. 500 a- 
year. The chief land-owner, by draining, liming, and enclosing, 
with stone walls, the whole arable part of his estate, amounting to 
6550 acres, has expended more than double the sum for which the 
estate was purchased in 1783. In the very centre of the richest 
portions of it, a number of small peat mosses were deposited in ba- 
sins of 150 acres in extent. It was a very expensive operation to 
fill up the numerous holes made by the parishioners, who had been 
for a long course of time in the habit of digging their supply of 
fuel from them. The liming, draining, and levelling, sometimes 
cost L. 40 an acre. They are now rich irrigated meadows, and 
yield an ample return for the outlay. The average quantity of 
hay is from 300 to 400 stones on each Scotch acre. On these 
meadows hay harvest commences about the beginning of July. 
What is cut down in one day, if the weather continue favourable, 
is housed on the evening of the next. This method preserves the 
saccharine juices which, by exposure to the weather, are evaporated, 
and the quality of the hay thereby deteriorated. 

These moss meadows being very unproductive in dry seasons, 
the proprietor has availed himself of the command of water, which 
the more elevated parts of his property aff'orded. Several streams, 
many miles distant, have been diverted from their channels, and 
are employed most advantageously in irrigating these meadows in 
the months of April, May, and June. 

Quarries.— There are several quarries of freestone, chiefly of old 
red sandstone, and one of limestone. The former are worked by 
removing the cover, and afford an excellent material for building 
and flooring. The lamina or plates are capable of being separated

so thin as to become an economical substitute for blue slate. When 
brushed over with coal tar, they are impervious to water. Advan- 
tao-e has been taken of a rivulet in the immediate vicmity of one 
ofhese quarries, to put in motion pumps, by a water-wheel, to 
drain it. Limestone is found in almost inexhaustible abundance 
The cover being deep, it is extracted from the quarry by means of 
excavations. In proceeding with these operations, the miners leave 
pillars of six square yards in thickness, at the distance Qf 30 teet, 
to support the roof, which, together with the floor, is workedinto 
a reo-ular form. The rock being very compact, they avail them- 
selves of the aid of gunpowder. The mode of raising the hmestone 
from this quarry is rather ingenious. From the centre of the ex- 
cavations an iron railway on an inclined plane, 200 yards long, ex- 
tends to the top of the kiln, up which loaded waggons ascend with 
the utmost facility, by means of a water-wheel put in motion by a 
stream of water brought six miles for the purpose. This stream 
is appropriated to other purposes. Descending to a lower level, it 
falls on another wheel, which puts in motion fanners to throw air 
into the bottom of lime-kilns, to facilitate the burning of limestone, 
and diminish the fuel necessary for driving off the carbonic acid ; 
to move pumps to drain the lime quarry, and also machinery for 
sawing timber. This stream is then conveyed away for irrigation. 
The kilns here mentioned are of the most improved construction 
for burning lime with the smallest quantity of fuel. 

Produce.— The gross amount and value of raw produce yearly 
raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows : 

Produce of grain of all kinds, - - - - L. 14,800 

of potatoes and turnips, - - - - 7000 

of hay, meadow and cultivated, - - - 5000 

of land in pasture, rating it at L. 2 per ox, and 4s. 6d. per ewe, - 8000

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Markets, -c— The nearest market-town is Dumfries, 12 miles 
distant. There are four small villages in the parish. There are 
two turnpike roads ; the one connects Annandale with Nithsdale, 
and is about eight miles long ; the other is six miles long, and 
forms a part of the great road from Carlisle to Glasgow by Dum- 
fries. About four miles northward it sends off a branch to Edin-p

burgh. On this road two coaches travel ; the one from Carlisle 
to Glasgow daily, and the other from Dumfries to Edinburgh 
thrice a-week. These and the district roads are well supplied 
with bridges, and in excellent condition. All the arable and pas- 
ture lands in the parish are inclosed with dry-stone fences. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is very conveniently situated 
for the greater part of the population. It was built in 1741, and 
is distant about three miles from the western, and eight from the 
eastern, extremity of the parish. Having undergone lately a tho- 
rough repair, it is one of the handsomest in this part of the coun- 
try, and contains sittings for 650 people. Six of the seats are free, 
and capable of accommodating 80 people. The free sittings are 
uniformly the first occupied, and the most crowded. The manse 
was built in 1760, and repaired in 1816, when a large addition 
was made to it, which has rendered it both comfortable and com- 
modious. The glebe is 10 acres in extent, and about L. 20 in 
value. The stipend is 16 chalders of meal and barley, in equal 
proportions, and L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. 

The Established church is the only place of worship in the parish. 
The number of Presbyterian dissenters of all ages, including five 
Cathohcs, is 137. The remainder of the population adhere to the 
Establishment. Wlien the weather is favourable, the church is 
remarkably well attended, and by people from every quarter of the 
parish. ihe average number of communicants is 500. 

Education.— There are five schools; but no legal salary is at- 
tached to any of thein. The principal one is a free school, which 
was amply endowed in 1723 by John Wallace, a native of the pa- 
rish, who had reahzed a considerable fortune in Glasgow by mer- 
cantile pursuits. The sum he bequeathed for carrying his bene- 
volent intentions into effect was L. 1600, the greater part of which, 
in terms of the deed of endowment, was to be invested in land ; 
the remainder to be appropriated to the erection of a school and 
dwelling-house for the rector, and the purchase of a contiguous 
field of five acres. The management of the fund was committed 
to the Presbytery of Penpont, who were authorized to watch over 
the interests of the seminary, and to judge of the qualifica- 
tions of the rector and the assistant teacher. In this seminary 
the children of the parish, but not those who attend from other 
parishes, arc entitled to be taught English, writing, arith- 
metic, book-keeping, Greek, and Latin, free of expense. Other 
branches also are taught. Irregular attendance on the part of

the scholars generally,-a circumstance over which the rector has 
no control -tends much to impede their progress. This defect 
mio-ht have been in a great measure remedied, had he been per- 
mitted to exact a small fee from each. It is, however, a great 
blessing to the parish, and has been the means of rescuing many 
from obscurity who have risen to eminence and adorned the situa- 
tions they occupied. The present rector has expended a conside- 
rable sum in building a large and commodious dwelling-house, and 
otherwise improving the endowment. His annual mcome, after 
deductino- public burdens, and the salary of the assistant, is L. 356. 

About\ quarter of a mile from the free school, there is a female 
school, at which are taught needle-work, sewing, reading, writ- 
ing, arithmetic, and geography. Mr Menteath pays a handsome 
salary to the teacher. He has fitted up and furnished a commo- 
dious dwelling-house for her. The fees are very moderate, and 
suited to the circumstances of the parents. There are other three 
schools situated in districts too distant to reap advantage from the 
free school, at which the same branches are taught as in the free 
school, with the exception of the Greek and Latin. The school 
of Wallace-hall being in the centre of the parish, renders a legal 
one unnecessary. There being no parochial school, the Jieritors 
voluntarily assess themselves in the sum of L. 35 annually which, 
with the addition of L. 5 paid by the rector of the free school in 
terms of the deed of endowment, affords to each of the teachers 
a salary of about L. 13 a-year. The general expense of education 
at these schools varies from 6s. to 12s. a-year, according to the 
attainments of the children. The annual amount of school fees 
does not exceed L. 24. There is not an individual in the parish, 
so far as I know, who has not received the elements of a common 
education. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is 21, and the average sum allotted to each 
is L. 3 a-year. A few indigent families get an occasional supply. 
The sum at the disposal of the kirk-session for behoof of the poor 
is L. 71 annually. This arises from the interest of L. 225, be- 
queathed at dilfereitt times, and lent at four per cent., the weekly 
collections at the church door, amounting to L. 52, mortcloth and 
marriage dues. In general, none apply for parochial aid until for- 
ced to do so by necessity. Such is the feeling of independence 
on the part of the people generally, that, did their age and in fir- 



90 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



mities permit, they would much rather support themselves by their 
own exertions. 

Fuel, c— The high grounds afford an inexhaustible supply of 
peat. This substance requiring much time and labour, and like- 
wise a dry season to prepare it for domestic purposes, has in a 
great measure been superseded by coal. The nearest coal field is 
that of Sanquhar, at the distance of 14 miles. Excellent San- 
quhar coal can be purchased at lis. per ton, carriage included. 
Mansfield coal, in Ayrshire, at the distance of 25 miles, and not 
inferior in quality to any in Scotland, is also much used, and can 
be procured at 13s. per ton, carriage included. English coal, ship- 
borne, can be purchased at 21s. per ton. The extensive woods 
furnish the poor with a pretty regular supply of fuel. It is now a 
prevalent opinion that peat is more expensive than coal. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

When the former Statistical Account was written, the number of 
arable acres was about 2400, and the rental of the parish L. 3500. 
There were very few enclosures, and the farm-houses and offices 
were miserable hovels. At present the number of arable acres is 
9000, all well enclosed ; the rental is above L. 12,000 ; and the 
farm-houses and offices substantially built, and neatly finished. 
Closebui'n, which half a century ago was one of the bleakest and 
most uncultivated, is now one of the most improved, beautiful, and 
richly wooded parishes in the south of Scotland.

PRESBYTERY OF PENPONT, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. DAVID SMITH, MINISTER. 



I. Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boimdaries.—Moro, an Anglo-Saxon word, signi- 
fies the sironc/hold or dwelling on the moor. On the north-west 
extremity of an extensive moor, and at the bottom of a beau- 
tiful green hill, from which it is separated by a deep glen, stands 
the old castle or stronghold of Morton, from which the parish seems 

to have taken its name. 

The boundaries and figure of the parish are very irregular. On 
the north-west and west it is bounded by the parish of Durrisdeer, 
from which it is separated by the Shielhouse rivulet and the river 
Carron; on the south-west, by the river Nith, which divides it from 
the parish of Penpont, with the exception of about 120 acres called 
Morton-holm, lying on the south bank of that river ; on the south- 
east and east, by the united parishes of Closeburn and Dalgarno, 
from which it is separated by the Cample; and on the north 
and north-west, it is bounded by Crawford parish in Lanarkshire. 
The march runs from the north-eastward along the waterfall of a 
mountain called Glenleith. The extent of the parish from south to 
north is about seven imperial miles, and its mean breadth about 
four ; and it contains about twenty-eight square miles. 

Topographical Appearances. — The external surface of this parish 
is varied, being diversified by ridge and valley. Along the banks of 
the rivers, especially the Nith and Cample, it is low and level, and the 
soil rich and productive. To the north of the Nith, there is a con- 
siderable ridge of rising ground, the soil of which is light, but kindly 
and fertile, and lies on a gravelly bottom. On the most elevated part 
of this ridge Thornhill is situated, a clean, healthy, and populous 
village; through which the high roads from Dumfries and from Gal- 
loway, by Minihivc and Penpont, pass to Edinburgh and Glasgow, and 
separate again to each of these cities at Carron-bridge, the boun-

clary of Morton with Durrisdeer. A little farther to the northward 
from Thornhill, other two ridges run across the parish, rising 
gently the one above the other. Here the soil is damp and wettish, 
lying on a clayey bottom. Of these, extensive tracts are still in a 
state of nature, though capable of cultivation ; and will, we trust, 
soon be improved, from the great encouragement given by the 
present Noble and spirited proprietor. Beyond this, again, the sur- 
face inclines with a gentle depression ; and, on the other side of 
this valley, the remainder of the parish rises into hills and moun- 
tains, some of which are of considerable height, especially one, 
which is about 2500 feet above the level of the sea. At the bottom 
of these hills and mountains, there is a considerable extent of arable 
and meadow land, of a rich alluvial soil, and very productive. The 
ranges of the ridges and rising grounds of the hills and mountains 
run across the parish from south-east to north-west. The greater 
part of the arable land lies on a free red sandstone bottom, under 
the clay or gravel ; and the mountains rest on the primitive and 
whinstone rocks. 

Meteorology. — The soil in this parish and district being in ge- 
neral dry, without fens, bogs, or morasses, and the air pure, mild, 
and temperate, the chmate is good, and the people healthy. The 
prevailing winds here are from the westward, perhaps nearly two- 
thirds of the year. Our heaviest rains are from the south-west, 
and settled dry weather chiefly from the north-west. In the spring 
months of March and April, indeed, we have often very high, cold, 
and stormy winds from the east. Sometimes also, at this season, 
there are very drenching and heavy rains from the south-east. 

Hydrography. — This parish is well supplied with water by the 
rivers Carron and Cample, as above stated, on its western and 
eastern boundaries; on the south, by the Nith, which, running 
south-east, flows into the Sol way Firth about four miles south-west 
from Dumfries ; and the interior part is abundantly supplied by 
burns, rivulets, and perennial springs. . There is also a strong 
chalybeate spring or spa, from which many are said to have de- 
rived great benefit in bilious and bowel complaints. 

Zoology. — The zoology of this parish is not at present distin- 
guished by any of the rarer species of animals. Under this head, 
however, the writer may take occasion to notice, that the Nith 
and" all its tributary streams close on the 25th September, and 
open on the 10th March ; and that to these terms there are very 
strong and not unfounded objections. The general opinion and 



MOllTON. 



wi.h seem to be, that the rivers of this county, the Esk, the An- 
nan, and the Nith, should close and open at the sarne time as the 
Tweed and in this respect be under the same regulations. 

The Nith and all its branches are poached without interruption 
during the whole of the close season, and to such extent that, m 
r oineral opinion, for every salmon taken in the open or legal 
season, more than thirty are destroyed in the close period,-a prac- 
tice which ruins the health, destroys the industry, corrupts the 
morals, and, famiharizing the mind to habitual and open violations 
of law, seldom fails to terminate in atrocious and darmg acts ot 
wickedness ; while by the toleration of such irregular deeds, thou- 
sands of parent fishes are destroyed in the breeding season. 
The season when every other animal is not only spared, but pro- 
tected and watched with care, is to the finny tribe the season ot 
insecurity, danger, and destruction. And the breeding fishes, 
impelled by an instinct or feeling common to all animated nature, 
the provident and wise inspiration of its Author, when m the very 
act of bringing forth or providing a place of security wherein to de- 
posit their fry, are barbarously destroyed with millions of then- 
young, destined by Heaven, but for the improvident cruelty of man, 
to minister to his comforts, and feed the hungry in coming years. 
Nor is there any hkelihood of the practice being put a stop to, 
until some regulation shall take place, respecting an embankment 
or barrier across the river Nith at Dumfries. By this embank- 
ment the course or run of the fishes is impeded, almost entirely 
prevented, and the fishing properties of the river and its branches 
are greatly deteriorated and rendered of very httle value in the 
upper districts ; and hence the proprietors refuse to give their aid, 
or be at any expense, to suppress the practice, unless such a run 
shall be opened and protected as to render their fishing properties 
valuable. It is only when the river is large and swelled by the 
autumnal and winter rains, the very time when the river is closed, 
• that any salmon can overleap the embankment and find their way 
up the streams. At other times, and when the river is small, as 
is the case during the greater part of the open season, hardly is 
there a salmon to be seen in the upper districts, and fishings which 
formerly were of great value are at present worth little or nothing.

believed, by a Norman chief of the name of De Moreville, whose 
family settled in Scotland in the tenth centui-y, became connected 
with some of the chief families of the kingdom, and rose to great 
power, wealth, and eminence. He obtained extensive grants of 
territory in this and other parts of the country, and was appoint- 
ed hereditary Lord High Constable of Scotland. His grandson, 
Hugo De Moreville, appears a witness to various royal charters 
granted in the reigns of Alexander and David I. In the year 1 140, 
he founded the monastery of Kilwinning in Ayrshire, and in 1 144, 
the Abbey of Dryburgh in Teviotdale. A short time afterwards he 
gave a portion of land called the Park to the Abbey of Melrose, 
which, with the church of Morton, was afterwards bestowed on the 
monks of Kelso. Wlien these monks formed an estimate of their 
property in the fourteenth century, they stated that they possessed 
the church of Morton in rectorial, which used to render by the 
year L. 10. He was succeeded by his son Richard De Moreville, 
who also appears as a witness to various royal charters in the reigns 
of David and Malcolm IV. Richard was succeeded by his son Wil- 
liam De Moreville, who died without issue ; and Rolland Lord of 
Galloway, who had married Emma, daughter of Richard, and the 
sister of William De Moreville, succeeded to the office of Lord 
High Constable of Scotland, the castle of Morton, and all the pos- 
sessions and wealth of the family. Allan, Rolland's son, married Mar- 
garet, the eldest daughter of David Earl of Huntington, by whom 
he had three daughters, the eldest of whom married John Baliol, 
the father of John Baliol, who for seven years was king of Scotland. 
After the Baliol and English party were overthrown, and Robert 
Bruce firmly seated on the Scottish throne, the lands and fortunes 
of the former and their adherents were bestowed as rewards of ser- 
vice on the friends of Bruce; and of these Randolph, the king's ne- 
phew, obtained extensive grants of lands in Annandale, and the 
lands and castle of Morton, which he held when Regent, during the 
minority of David Bruce. By a secret article of the treaty for the 
restoration of David II. it is said, the Scots agreed to dismantle 
the castles of Dumfries, Dalswinton, Morton, and Durrisdeer. In 
the reign of Robert II. the king bestowed his daughter Egidia, the 
loveliest woman of the age, on William Douglas, natural son of 
Archibald Douglas Lord of Galloway, then the most distinguished 
of the Scottish youth for dignified and graceful appearance, for mo- 
desty, bravery, and every mental and corporeal endowment, — and 
with her, the castle of Morton and county of Nithsdale next to Gal- 



MORTON. 9 



lovvay, as a dowry. In 1390, William Douglas of Nithsdale, his 
country being at peace, and he not willing to languish in indolence a 
home, set out to Prussia to the Holy war, and was assassinated at 
Dantzic, on the Vistula, by assassins hired by Clifford, an English- 
man, formerly his rival, and now envious of his honour and pro- 
motion. Ever since this period, the castle and lands of Morton 
have been in the possession of one or other of the family of Douglas. 

Antiquities.-Oi these the old castle, with its appendages of for- 
tification and means of defence, is most worthy of notice. Though 
not more than one-half of the original structure now exists, it is, not- 
withstanding, the most perfect ruin of the kind in this part of the 
country. Situated on the brink of a deep glen, extending to a 
considerable distance south-east and north-west, and in which the 
water being stopt by large dams, and strong embankments at each 
extremity, must have collected to the depth of several fathoms,— 
the place must have been proof against assault or surprise on this 
side. The present remains extend to upwards of 100 feet in length, 
by nearly 30 in width ; but, to judge from the vestiges of the foun- 
dation, the Castle must have occupied, when entire, a much larger 
space. The wall of the south front is yet entire ; from the foun- 
dation, it is about 40 feet high; and on the top, at each corner, it 
has a large round tower about 12 feet in diameter. The walls at 
the foundation are about 8, in some places 10, feet thick. 

At a short distance north-west of the castle, and on the other side 
of the glen, are the remains of a strong fortification, with entrench- 
ments, which seem to have been a Roman fort or castellum, still 
called by the name of Deer Camp it is about two miles north of 
Tibbers, Tiberii Castra— the great Roman station in the parish 
of Penpont, a station well chosen to watch and guard against in- 

• This parish gives the title of Earl to Douglas Earl of Morton. Morton Castle, 
it is said, was at one time his place of residence. He was proprietor of the whole 
parish, with the exception of the Mains of Morton, lying north-west of the castle, 
which belonged to James Douglas, laird of Morton, whose son, Malcolm Douglas 
of Mains, was distinguished for bravery in the border history. The last of this fa- 
mily was Captain .Tames Douglas, who died at Bratford, in the parish of Penpont, 
ab-out the beginning of last century. The Earl of Morton, who possessed large 
estates and c;istles in different part of the country, sold his whole property and 
interest in this parish to Sir William Douglas Cashoggle, who erected a house a 
little south of Thornhill, called the Red-House, where he sometimes resided ; but 
the Earl of Queensberry having obtained from Cashoggle all his lands, as well as 
the lands of Morton Mains from the other family, and being lord of the regality of 
Hawick, he obtained authority to translate that regality to Thornhill in 1610, and 
called it New Dalgarnocli.

cursions from recesses of the mountains on the north and north- 
east. At a small distance from this fort, stood a venerable tree, 
which, a considerable number of years ago, was overthrown and 
uprooted by a tremendous gust of wind, and which, according to 
the tradition of the country, was for generations known by the 
name of the Judgment Thorn ; and at about a mile south of this 
seat of Judgment, is a field still distinguished by the name of Gal- 
liflat, or Gallow's Flat, where it is said, judgment was carried into 
execution; and about 300 yards south from the old castle, and on 
a rising ground, is the vestige of a small station or camp, called 
Watchman Knowe. 

In the beginning of last century, there was a boat cut out of 
one solid piece of wood, in the form of an Indian canoe, dug out of 
the bottom of a moss not far from the old castle, — a proof that, 
at one time, it must have been a loch. A short time after this, 
there was dug out of the same moss a small copper camp-kettle ; 
and in the year 1728, a fine copper cast tea-pot stroop, quite 
entire. It is said also, that not long ago a large massy piece of pure 
solid gold, in the form of a circle or ring, such as is used on the 
handle of a sword, for ornament or defence "for the hand, was 
found by a man casting turf, who sold it for one guinea, and that 
it was sold again for upwards of twenty guineas. Near this same 
place, stood two lofty columns or pillars of hewn stone, and about 
a mile south of these, stood another of the same description, — both, 
probably, memorials of the brave who had fallen in battle. Another 
cross or column stood a little to the west of the church, — said to 
have been originally surrounded by a large circle of coarse blocks 
of stone, at equal and regular distances, and which were gradually 
removed in the progress of improvement. This column must 
have been British, — probably a Druidical fane. These columns, 
about fifty years ago, were very improperly allowed to be removed 
and carried off from the parish by a gentleman, who then sought 
to signalize himself as an antiquarian, though he seems not to have 
known or reflected, that monuments of antiquity lose all their value 
by removal from the place where they have long stood, and were 
loriginally erfected. 

In this parish I have seen two or three tumuli, which, some 
years ago, were removed to make or repair roads, by persons who 
were incompetent either to examine the contents, or to give an ac- 
count of what was discovered. They could only report that in 
the centre, were found a few flag-stones set together, lut nothing

else worthy of notice. About thirty-six years ago, the writer was 
present at the opening of two tumuh in Annandale, in every re- 
spect similar to the two above mentioned, in external form and ap- 
pearance. In the centre of the first, was found a red flag laid level 
on the earth, on which were placed two other flags of equal size, 
parallel to each other ; and other two, one at each end ; another 
was laid on the top as a cover. In the interior of this, was an urn 
containing ashes, with a few very thin plates of iron in the form of 
rings, so completely corroded with rust, that, when exposed to the 
air, they instantly crumbled into dust. The other likewise con- 
tained an urn ; but, from want of care in forming the tumulus, or 
from some other cause, both the flags and urn were crushed and 
broken in pieces, and no discovery could be made ; but, from what 
was observed in the former, it seemed probable, that they were Bri- 
tish. Csesar informs us, when he invaded Britain, that the Bri- 
tish used iron for money, — " Annulis ferreis pro nummis utuntur."

by dissenting clergymen ; and in the whole parish there have been 
altogether within these two periods only three deaths. 

The Duke of Buccleuch, who succeeded to the dukedom of 
Queensberry in 1810, is now sole proprietor of the parish of Mor- 
ton, with the exception of the farm of Ridings, which is the pro- 
perty of Robert Kennedy, Esq. of Dalwhat, who resides m this 
parish on his property. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy.— parish contains about 
9000 imperial acres ; and the gross rental is L. 3060, which, on an 
average, will be between 6s. and 7s. per acre. Of the above, as 
nearly as can be ascertained, 2600 acres have been cultivated, and 
are occasionally in tillage, or in meadow, and of which the rent, ac- 
cording to its situation, quahty, or state of cultivauon, does not 
exceed at present 8s. 10s. or 16s. per acre. About 3500 acres 
must remain waste or in pasture ; and I have no doubt that 1000 
or 1200 acres more may, with a profitable apphcation of capital, 
be added to the cultivated land,-either for meadow, occasional til- 
lage, or permanent pasture. About 480 imperial acres are under 
wood, 90 acres of which is natural, and consists chiefly of Bri ish 
oak from 45 to 50 years old, with a few withered bvrches. 100 
acres more are now in the course of being planted. There are no 
undivided lands or commons in this parish.    

Breeds, c.-Of the kinds of sheep, the black-faced are consi- 
dered the best suited for this parish, being a more hardy, sound, 
and healthy stock, and better suited to the climate and pasture ; 
"t, in an adjo-ing farm in the parish of Closeburn the Cheviot 
I eed has been introduced with success. Upon the fanBS adapted 
for cattle, especially where the young are reared, the stock select- 
ed is of the Galloway breed. By the farmers whose attention is 
directed to the dairy system, the Ayrshire cows are preferred, as 
' ivLt milk in larger quantities; yet there are some who prefer 
le GaUoway cowf though the milk be less in quantity, it is sure 
to be rther, and of superior quality. And, with i.gard to horses, 
attentbn is here chiefly given to the breed of work-horses, which, 
lofo vpnrs; has been much improved.

lue, have already been reclaimed, and will this year be under white 
crop ; and if the present spirit does not greatly relax, there is every 
reason to beheve, that in the course of a few seasons, an addition 
of more than a third will be made to the improved arable, meadow, 
and pasture grounds. Inclosures and plantations are advancing 
with astonishing rapidity. New erections of houses and farming 
establishments for the accommodation of tenants are rising in 
every direction, as comfortable and convenient, substantial and 
useful, to the occupiers, as ornamental to the country, which al- 
ready begins to assume a new aspect. Nor is the change for the 
better less observable in the village of Thornhill, where the bene- 
volent proprietor, the Duke of Buccleuch, with great judgment 
and propriety, is at present expending very considerable sums in 
levelling and paving the streets, in forming common sewers, remov- 
ing nuisances, providing a supply of good water, and making other 
improvements tending to promote the comfort, the cleanliness, the 
health, morality, and virtue of the inhabitants. 

Rate of Wages. — -The wages of farm-servants, labourers, artisans, 
and others connected with husbandry, are various, but are nearly 
as follows, yearly. For a man-servant living in the family, L. 12, 
12s.; qualified ploughman, L. 16, 16s.; farm female-servant, L. 6, 
6s. ; dairy-maid or byre-woman, L. 7, 7s. Farm-labourers receive 
per day, Is. 6d, ; hay, turnip, and potatoe-labourers. Is. 2d. ; a mower 
to cut or mow hay, 3s. ; a carpenter or joiner, 2s. 6d ; a mason 3s. 
In autumn the rates are higher, and vary almost every day, being 
sometimes as high as 2s. 6d. with maintenance in the farmer's fa- 
mily. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce raised 
yearly in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows : 



120 acres potatoes, 
80 do. turnip, 
280 do. oats, 
170 do. barley, 
100 do. meadow hay,

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Markets, §-c.— The village of ThornhiU was at first intended to 
be a market-town, and authority was obtained to hold a market m 
it every Tuesday. But though a weekly market established in this 
village would be a great public benefit conferred upon this part of 
the country, as well as the village, it has never yet succeeded it 
is supposed, however, that it could be easily made to succeed by 
the present Noble proprietor, who would thereby merit.the public 

gratitude. . i • i. 

Ecclesiastical Sto.-The church was bmlt m 1781, and is not 
inconveniently situate for the parish in general. At present it is 
not in a good state of repair,-the repairs having been delayed in 
the prospect of its being soon removed to a situation more conve- 
nient for the inhabitants of the village. It affords accommodation 
for between 500 and 600 persons, and is too small for the present 
population ; but, by the erection of galleries, may be made to accom- 
modate 200 more, and be sufficiently large : the seats are all tree. 
The manse was built about the middle of last century, was repair- 
ed lately, and though small, is comfortable. The glebe is about 
twenty acres in extent, andis worth about L. 25 yearly. The stipend 
is 16 chalders, half meal, half barley, with L. 10 for commmuon 
elements; it was augmented on the 27th January 1830 bince 
which time the stipend, converted to money, has averaged L. 24/, 

9s. 21d. per annum. . , i j j 

Divine service at the Established church is regularly attended 
by about 350 famihes, and the average number of communicants 
is about 500. There is a dissenting chapel in the village, former- 
ly of the Antiburgher persuasion, now of the United Associate 
Synod. There are besides, a few Cameronians, and several of the 
Relief persuasion attached to these two congregations, m the ad- 
Ling parish of Penpont. The number of famihes belonging to 
the Secession Associate Synod, Relief, and Cameronians, is 133. 
Only 15 individuals are Cameronians. Of late maijy of the young 
in the families of Seceders have been returning to the Established

Library —Though we have not yet reached the estabUshment 
of a puWic reading-room, there are several clubs or societies for 
the purchase of newspapers and other periodical pubhcations, to be 
read and perused in their own dwelhngs. The desire for reading 
and information of every description has of late years much m- 
creased, and seems still increasing. A subscription library was 
established in Thornhill in 1814, which is doing well; and the sub- 
scribers are numerous. 

Charitable Institutions, -c.- There are three men s and one 
women's Society ; two of the men's are stock societies, and one 
what is called a penny society. One of the stock societies has ex- 
isted for upwards of 30 years; one 22 years ; the penny society 
about 10 years ; and the women's society 25 years. It is impos- 
sible to speak too highly of their benevolent object; and the good 
they have accomplished here is inexpressible. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The average number of poor receiv- 
ing parish aid has of late been about 30, and is rapidly increasing, 
—the aversion to make apphcation, and be put on the poors' roll, 
though still in some degree felt, gradually wearing away. Our 
only regular source of supply for their relief is from the weekly 
collections in the cliurch, which amount to L.40 yearly, with the in- 
terest of L.60 ; and from occasional collections and contributions 
from the heritors and others, which may amount to as much. There 
are two general distributions in the year, at Whitsunday and Mar- 
tinmas, besides almost weekly private disbursements to those whose 
necessities require it. The yearly sum to those on the roll is va- 
rious, from L. 1, 4s. to L. 6 ; but besides the above, I beUeve 
more is given by individuals in private alms, in clothing, in articles 
of food, and also in money. No regular assessment of poors' rate 
has yet been had recourse to in this parish. 

Inns, 4-c.— There are two very respectable inns in the village, 
which are sufficient for the parish; though there are eight or 
ten inferior lodging and dram-houses in the same place, besides 
three in Carronbridge. 

Fuel.—T\\Q fuel used here is peat and coal; of the former, 
there is still a moderate supply within the bounds of the parish, 
though now wearing fast away: and the nearest coal is at Sanquhar, 
about twelve miles distant.

PRESBYTERY OF LOCHMABEN, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER JOHNSTONE, MINISTER.  



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, Sc. — The name is ancient, and applies to 
the village, to the parish, and to the principal stream and vale. 
When the deep and romantic pastoral valley of Moffat Water was 
densely viooded, it must have well suited the name it bore in the 
Gaelic language, " Oua-vat," which is said to signify " a long 
deep mountain hollow." 

The greatest length of the parish is about 15 miles, and the 
greatest breadth from 8 to 9 miles. The contents, according 
to the county map, are 56| square miles ; but including Hart- 
hope and Raecleugh in Lanarkshire, they must be 60 square 
miles, or 38,400 English acres. It is bounded on the north by 
Tweedsmuir parish with part of Lyne and Megget; by Esk- 
dale-muir and Hatton on the east ; by Wamphray and Kirkpa- 
trick-Juxta on the south ; and by the latter parish, and that of 
Crawford on the west. The figure is irregular, projecting con- 
siderably to the N. E., between the counties of Peebles and Sel- 
kirk, but is deeply indented on the east by a part of Selkirk- 
shire, and on the S. W. by the parish of Kirkpatrick-Juxta. In 
the line of the boundaries are the summits of Hartfell and Loch- 
craig, on the north ; Birkhill pass, and the tops of Bodisbeck and 
Lochfell on the N. E. ; the Bell Craig linn burn on the south ; on 
the west, the river Annan from Woodfoot to Bridgend, and thence 
by the Meikle holm side burn, the Blacklaw hill, — a small part of 
Middlegill burn, — and the grain of Garpel Water head; then on the 
N. W. are the hills whose water-shed is into the Daer and the Clyde. 

Topographical Appearances. — Parallel ranges of hills of moderate 
elevation form the waterfalls of Evan on the N. W., and of Annan

in the northern central parts; and steeper and higher lands range  
along Moftat Water ; the gorges of these three vales and the three 
rivers uniting below Moffat ; and the united streams afterwards pas- 
ig under the name of the river Annan. Although the vdlage of 
Moffat is situated at an elevation of about 370 feet above the sea and 
the meeting of the three rivers below must be at an elevation of about 
350 feet above sea level, to this point of junction they a 1 descend 
briskly in their courses : Annan Water runnmg southward about se- 
ven miles: Moffat Water descending to the south-west about ten 
miles ; and only about four or five miles of the upper part of Evan 
Water being in this parish, moving to the south by east. The beds 
of Annan and Moffat Waters are mostly formed of gravel and sand 
with rounded stones; the course of Evan is over almost vertical rocks. 
The hills and mountains ranging along these rivers are generally 
steep, in some instances almost inaccessible ; but though the water- 
fall is brisk, it is distributed over long spaces, and excellent public 
roads have been long open in the direction of these rivers ; the 
well-known Evandale road, affording a safe and easy communica- 
tion as part of the mail-coach road from Carlisle to Glasgow, and 
the improved line in the direction of Annan Water being part of 
the mail-coach road from Dumfries to Edinburgh; while up Mof- 
fat Water carriages pass without any difficulty or danger by the 
lakes and Yarrow to Selkirk, the access being good and safe in all 
these directions; and very easy to the burgh of Annan on the south, 
distant 27 miles. The vales formed along Annan and Moffat 
Waters are narrow, but of a dry and fertile soil; that of Evan Water 
is not only more confined, but less fertile, and more heathy. All 
these water-courses are well adapted for pasturage ; and in the 
vales of Annan and Moffat Waters there is also a proportion of 
land in cultivation and planted with trees. It is believed that the 
passes at the upper parts of these rivers, when the greatest ascent 
along the road from Moffat has been gained, may rise generally 
to near a thousand feet in all, which, if distributed over a space 
of ten miles, would make an ascent as easy as necessary. But, of 
course, part of the roads are steeper. 

The group of mountains called after Hartfell, and forming the 
highest land in Scotland lying south of the Forth, contains the fol- 
lowing, viz. Harff ell, vfhose height above the seaat low water is 2635 
feet ; Whitecoom, looking down on the basin of Lochskeen, 2685 
feet; Broadlaio in Peebles-shire and Tweedsmuir parish, 2741 feet; 
FAtrick Pen, whose height is 2256 feet ; and Queensberry to the 



104 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



S. W. whose elevation is 2259 feet ; and the summit whereof is 
in latitude 55° 17' 2" N. ; and longitude 3° 34' 47" west. The 
heights of Saddleback and Lochcraig have not yet been correctly 
ascertained. The position of Queensberry was correctly laid 
down, and the precise elevations, in so far as above stated, have 
been certified from the great Ordnance survey, and by the highest 
authority.  The Hartfell group of mountains includes Lochfell, 
nearly equal in height to the rest ; together with Bodsheck and some 
others, whose elevation is not correctly known. The Fells in the 
south of Scotland and north of England are generally soft green hills 
of considerable elevation, and easy curved outline. If the word 
" meaol" or veaol, as it is often pronounced, and which in Gaelic 
is said to signify a lump or jiattish hill, be the true etymon of 
these fells, it seems not inappropriate to their description. The 
Hopes are not uncommon terms as parts of mountain scenery in 
the pastoral regions of the south of Scotland, and they occur most 
frequently where the bases of mountains meet each other without 
leaving any level, as a vale. It is this hne of meeting and ascent 
from it that is commonly called a hope, and with the name of the 
hill or farm superadded. 

Hartfell may be ascended nearly all the way on horseback ; and 
from its green flat summit may be seen, in fine weather, the Che- 
viots in Northumberland, Skiddaw, and other mountains of Cum- 
berland ; CrifFell in Galloway, Queensberry, and the other moun- 
tains on the west ; Corsoncone in Nithsdale, Blacklarg in Ayrshire, 
and, at sunset, also Benlomond in Stirlingshire. 

Meteorology. — The temperature of Moffat parish varies, of 
course, very considerably over the vales and mountains. But the 
aspect is to the southward, and the soil is commonly either natu- 
rally dry, or it has been drained where it was damp ; and the com- 
bined effect of these two causes has been felt to advantage in im- 
proving the climate throughout the parish. Snow is frequently 
attracted in showers to the mountains, and is seen lying there, 
white on the summits, when there is none below in the vales. 

• It may be interesting, for the purpose of comparison, to notice here the elevations 
of some higher mountains in England, on the south, and partly in sight of the above 
group. Skiddaw in Cumberland, above sea level, 3022 feet ; Helvellyn, in the same 
county, 3055 feet ; Cheviot, in Northumberland, 2665 feet. The elevations of some 
of the Scottish mountains in the north are as follows : Bennachie, in Aberdeenshire, 
above sea level, 2858 feet ; Lochnagarr in the same, 3777 feet ; Bcntnachdowie, in the 
same, 4305 feet ; Critachan in Argyleshirc, 3654 feet ; Benncvis, in Inverness-shire, 
4368 feet. 



MOFFAT.

The great elevation of the Hartfell group of mountains may 
account for occasionally deep falls of snow, attended by storms of 
wind and snow drift, of which very serious instances have occurred 
in this parish; but after all, the fact is not denied, that on 
these mountains the losses in sheep are not so great as in the less 
favourably situated hill pastures in the counties of Lanark, Peebles, 
and Selkirkshire, lying near them ; and in the greener and lower, 
but softer hills of Eskdalemuir in Dumfries-shire, with a less fa- 
vourable soil and aspect. The climate and temperature of the vil- 
lage of Moffat may be stated most intelligibly by comparison, being 
neither so cold as in Edinburgh, nor so wet as in Glasgow; and 
not so warm as in Dumfries and Annan ; but all observation and 
experience concur in assigning to Moffat a mild temperature, and a 
healthy- climate. The town is built on, and surrounded by, lands 
of a dry and gravelly description, so that the streets and roads 
around the village are soon dried after falls of rain. It has a 
gentle declivity to the south, and a noble screen of lofty moun- 
tains protecting it from north and east, and frequently attract- 
ing showers which otherwise must have fallen in the vale. There 
is here no eastern fog or. liaar as it is called in Edinburgh 
when there is an east wind, nor is Moffat exposed to the dense fogs 
that visit and hang over Dumfries and Annan from the Solway 
Firth, and from the vast mass of spongy peat still undrained in 
Lochar Moss. There is no furnace to cause a nuisance and con- 
taminate the pure air, as in the vicinity of many populous and ma- 
nufacturing towns. The centre of Moffat has been cleared and 
widened to the diniensions of a moderate square. It may be added, 
as connected with salubrity at least, that a full supply of the very best 
and purest spring water has lately been introduced in lead pipes from 
the parish of Kirkpatrick- Juxta, and carried below the bed of the An- 
nan Water into Moffat; that in all directions the intercourse is easy 
and regular ; that an elegant set of baths, and a long-room for the 
purposes of reading and assemblies, have been lately constructed 
on a superior plan ; and that the habits of early rising, in order 
to visit the well, to which also there is a good walking and car- 
riage road, have been thought materially to contribute to health. 
It may be added, that there is hardly any clay-bog undrained 
in the parish; that peat-bogs are not known to cause marsh 
fever; and that most of these are now drained for the benefit 
of the sheep, or for the purpose of being cut into peats, or im- 
proved and laid down in meadow grass ; and, accordingly, among 



106 



DUMFRIES-SIIIIIE. 



the resideHters in Moffat, there are very few instances of ague. 
Typhus has often prevailed in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Carlisle, and 
other cities, when there was no such distemper in Moffat. Pro- 
vidence averted even the cholera, though severe in Glasgow, and 
especially in Dumfries, with which there was daily intercourse,— 
only two or three doubtful cases having occurred, and among 
strangers affected before they reached Moffat. If the chmate be 
the cause of any local distempers, the writer has never heard of it, 
nor the medical friends he has consulted on the point. 

The prevailing winds are from the west, and these are also the 
most powerful. The north wind is dry, and so also, for the most part, 
is the east wind. The south wind is warm, and inclines to moisture. 
About 40 shepherds reside in the parish, all observant enough of 
the prognostics of weather from so many mountain summits, — 
store-masters and farmers being also generally provided with barome- 
ters. The dreadful snow fall and blast of the 24th January 1 794 was 
indicated by an uncommon fall in the barometer. A wet season 
is not so much dreaded here, because the soil of the mountains 
and the vales is mostly dry, and the sheep are not hable to the 
distemper called the rot, so fatal in some of the most fertile parts 
of England. The dry summer of 1826 threatened famine to the 
flocks and folds, and suffering to the poor ; but the wheat crop 
of that year was very superior. One of the most alarming conse- 
quences of the droughts in 1826 and in 1832 was the failure of 
springs and of the smaller burns, which in some places occasioned 
a want of good water ; and, on the whole, in such a soil as the 
mountains and vales of Moffat consist of, the frequent recurrence of 

showers is beneficial. 

Hydrography— Moffat Well and Harffell Spa.— As to common 
springs, they are numerous and pure, arising out of the gravelly soil. 
But with respect to medicinal springs, there are two, which have long 
been well known, and have attained great celebrity; one of which is 
called Moffat Well, and is of a sulphureous character ; the other, a 
chalybeate, rising at the distance of four miles from the village, and 
known by the name of the Hartfell Spa. This chalybeate spring 
issues out of a deep ravine on the west side of the mountain, whose 
name it bears, about four miles N. W. from the village of Moffat. 
The ground all around having been deeply exposed, masses of con- 
glomerate appear, containing rounded stones cemented by ferrugi- 
nous and aluminous earths, of the properties of both which the 
spring partakes. John Williamson, who discovered this water, 



MOFFAT. 



107 



had a monument erected to his memory in 1769. The water, as 
analyzed by Dr Garnet, contains 5 cubic inches azotic gas per 
wine o-allon ; 84 grains of sulphate of iron in the same ; 12 grains 
of sulphate of alumina ; 15 grains oxide of iron. The taste is not 
unpleasant. The water is richest immediately after heavy falls ot 
rain ; and it keeps long, and may be sent to distant places when 
the bottles are well-corked and sealed. A large wme-glassful is 
the common dose of the Hartfell Spa, taken twice or thrice a-day. 

The Well, as it is called, was discovered nearly 200 years ago, and 
continues to maintain its character as a slow but sure and safe re- 
medy in the complaints to which waters of this description are ap- 
phed. It sparkles hke champagne when taken from the foun- 
tain, and becomes pleasant by habitual use ; some at last pre- 
ferring to drink it before the purest spring-water; and, being 
light, It is taken in very large quantities. Dr Garnet's analysis 
gfves 4 cubic inches of nitrogen gas in the wine gallon ; 5 cubic 
inches of carbonic acid gas ; 10 cubic inches of sulphuretted hy- 
drogen gas; 36 grains of muriate of soda. This water is now 
conveyed in pipes to Moffat, for the use of persons inclined to 
have it there for warm-baths ; but those who drink the water, of 
•course, find it purest and most pleasant at the fountain, about a 
mile from Moffat, where a woman attends in an apartment for the 
use of visitants. 

Lochskeen. — The only lake of importance is Lochskeen, formed in 
an elevated mountain basin, rather mossy, and having one or two 
rocky islets within its waters. Lochskeen is about three-quarters of a 
mile in length, and one quarter in breadth. Its elevated situation 
is thought to be above 1000 feet above sea level, and yet it con- 
tains the finest trout in this part of Scotland. The outlet of its 
waters is by the lofty cascade, called the Gray Mare's Tail, falling 
over precipitous rocks, which have been computed in all at 400 
feet elevation above the vale, — this waterfall being broken into 
parts. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The soil of the vales is alluvial, and 
contains many rounded stones, with sand and gravel. The dry 
mountain soils are light, with grass and heath ; but the growth of 
peat-moss heath is interrupted by draining and burning. Grass 
mixed with heath grows to the summit of the mountains, the out- 
lines of which are curved and somewhat regular. The rivers and 
rivulets have opened scars in various places, exposing the sub- 



108 



DUMFllIES-SIIIRE. 



strata; but these have not been at any time very particularly exa- 
mined. 

For the mineralogy of this parish, reference may be made to 
the survey of this county by Professor Jameson, and to the prac- 
tical survey of the Bushbys coal-viewers, also to the sketch on the 
county map, inserted by the late General Dirom ; but this field 
seems to have been little explored, and probably may yet be found 
rich in future discoveries. 

Sandstone exists, but is not worked ; and the same remark ap- 
plies to roofing-slate. Coal has not been found, nor lime, but 
neither of them has been duly sought for. A drift was put into 
Hartfell, in search of copper ore, but without success. Gypsum 
occurs in thin veins, and also calcareous spar. The fine blue 
Moffat whinstone is one of the best for building, being rich in dif- 
fused quartz. No mine has been worked in this parish, and no 
adequate pains taken for the discovery of minerals, — the only trial 
for coal not having been well supported, nor made with judgment 
and perseverance. 

Zoology. — In former times, the hart and hind were found in 
this parish; the last hart was killed in 1754, having been long 
single. The roebuck and doe were also natives, but have long 
since disappeared. The eagle has become a rare bird, though 
still it may be seen occasionally floating over the summits of the 
high mountains. The Uue hawk bred lately in the Bell Craig 
Linn. The fox continues to haunt in the hills and mountains, and 
to be destructive to lambs and poultry. It would be a wise mea- 
sure to employ all the strength of the community here, as for- 
merly in Dryfe, for destroying in season all sorts of birds and beasts 
of prey, and their broods, early in May, that being the proper time. 
Game appears liable to fluctuations, depending partly on the sea- 
sons, and partly, as is supposed, on the burning of the heath, and 
the care taken to destroy such creatures as are hurtful to the game; 
a task not easily performed, unless the shepherds take a part m it. 
Black and red game, vfith partridges, are found as usual in the pro- 
per situations. Ptarmigan are very rarely seen. The heron is 
often seen among the waters ; and 2oild ducks occasionally visit 
them. Wood pigeons are numerous ; and there are cojnmon pigeons 
which have bred in remote parts or old towers, and have become 

wild. 1 J 

The domestic cattle are mostly of the Galloway breed, as reared 
for sale ; and of the Ayrshire kind, as kept for milk cows. A cow

pasture at Moffat accommodates about thirty of the resent 
famihes enabhno- them to sell milk to visitants. The sheep 
::f::;e larg-e and excellent; and are all, or  
only a few of the black-faced breed being now left in the most ex- 
p Id pastures, and a few crosses of Cheviots and L-cester in he 
Lver farms. A few goats, for milk to strangers, have long been 
ke't Ir the well. Pigs are not reared in this parish to any great 

Tt fishings of all the rivers of Dumfries -shire have become of 
httle value, Snce stake-nets were permitted 'Z 
the plan most destructive of the fish as they enter these iiveis, 
and\t is not easy to understand why the old acts which were 
framed before the union of the kingdoms are still allowed to 
remain in force ; nor why, under these acts, nero and more destruc- 
tive modes of taking the fish have been permitted. Strangers 
who think proper to ask permission, are seldom refused the liberty 
of trouting in any of the rivers near Moffat ; and every one should 
set his face against using nets to destroy the trouts, and still more 
against the mean and pernicious practice of killing the salmon m 
forbidden time, and in the season of spawning; a practice that led 
to the extinction of one poor family in Moffat long ago, that la- 
mily having died out of putrid fever, occasioned by their living 
wholly on such unwholesome food. 

Botamj —The French or herh ivillow, though a rare plant in 
many places, has become naturalized here. The scented woodruff 
appears in the rocky linns ; a few plants oi juniper exist; the wild 
strawberry/ and raspbernj appear in a few places ; cranberry/ in 
mossy bogs, and blaeberrij and crowberry in the mountains. The 
knub-berry, otherwise called the Queens-berry, {Ruhus chamcs- 
morus, would be far more plentiful if the sheep did not eat down 
the blossoms and leaves, and the fire occasionally burn the stems. 
The hay-berry has established itself,— and the ivhite thorn,— then- 
seech being carried and propagated by the birds, as many other 
seeds are. 

Among those plants which grow naturally and sometimes luxu- 
riantly, though not cultivated, nor of much or any use, may be men- 
tioned the whin in stiff tilly bottomed soils ; the broom in fight sand 
or gravel, both of which, though useful in former times, are now 
considered as weeds ; also the sweet gale or gall {Myrica in wet 
turf boo-s ; rushes and ca.rices in the same soils; and the marsh ma-

rigold [CaWiapalustris, and queen of the meadows {Spircea ulmaria ; 
also ferns or hraken in dry deep lands, and the sloe and hramhle 
which ought to be rooted out from all sheep-walks. One of the most 
pernicious weeds in this parish is the great white ox eye {Chrysan- 
themum Leucanthemum, which, though an herb, is perennial, and 
\'ery pernicious when allowed to establish itself. Thistles, docks, 
muywort, and other perennial weeds have, been mostly extirpated, 
and so have some of the worst annuals, as common yule, wild shale, 
and spu7'ry; but corn chamomile still appears occasionally in the 
fields, and is mistaken for the great white ox eye; and still we see a 
few plants of corn-cockle and wild mustard in the cultivated lands, 
— while other weeds infest the meadows and pastures. It would 
be of importance for every farmer to possess a short and practical 
manual containing a description of these and other weeds and of 
the best mode of destroying them. 

The cultivated crops of corn are wheat on a small scale, barley, 
and the best varieties of common and early oats; hear is hardly sown 
as a crop now, and rye is not sown at all. 

Of natural woods in a parish that was, at one period, richly wood- 
ed, there are now very scanty remains at Craigieburn, and in a few 
other places. The oak, the ash, the birch, the hazel, and the moun- 
tain ash, grow spontaneously ; but the interest of those connected 
with the soil induced them to cut down the more valuable trees ; 
and their stoles not being protected, they died out. To compen- 
sate for this, in some degree, persons of pubhc spirit formed plan- 
tations of forest trees ; and among those who did most in this way 
were John Earl of Hopetoun, and Sir George Clerk Maxwell, 
about sixty years ago. The trees planted by them have prospered 
well, and have now arrived at considerable maturity. More recent 
plantations have, therefore, been encouraged, and these have been 
made by the late James Earl of Hopetoun and his representatives; 
by Dr Rogerson of Dumcrieff, and other gentlemen ; and these 
plantations have prospered well, and have paid reasonably in cut- 
tings and thinnings, with the prospect of the timber also doing well. 
The ash loses elasticity and value when suffered to be too aged 
before cutting, the stoles also not rising from the root ; and even 
the oak, when not thriving, is apt to get spotted in the timber, and 
should be cut down. - The Scots fir cannot be expected to lay on red 
heart-wood, unless allowed to stand well on to 100 years. No tree 
is so useful and valuable as the Scots elm; and none comes earlier

H. — Civil History. 
Historical Events.-Nith regard to historical events of an an- 
cient date,-little of this nature has been handed down m such a 
credible and interesting form as to warrant the msertion ol it 
here. Margaret, daughter of Robert HI. was Countess of Doug- 
las, Countess of Galloway, and Lady of Annandale, and was inter- 
red at Lincluden, near Dumfries; but still the traditions of Mot- 
fat contain nothing of that distinguished lady. It is known, how- 
ever, with pride and satisfaction, that in 1333, during a period 
fraught with ignominy and suffering to Scotland, Sir Archibald 
Douglas, at the head of 1000 horse, came down by night to Mof- 
fat, surprised Edward Baliol, defeated the forces he had with him, 
and obliged him to make a precipitate retreat to the Solway, with the 
loss of his brother, and of some English officers of distinction ; and 
that hardly any affair in the history of Scotland appears to have 
been better conducted, as none was more acceptable to the nation. 

It may also be mentioned here, that a division of the Highland 
army of Prince Charles Edward passed through Moffat on their 
way into England; that on their route they had visited the last Duke 
of Douglas in quest of arms; that his Grace treated them with 
great forbearance, and even with kindness, offering some handsome 
presents to the officers, which, in such circumstances, they declined 
to accept; and that, unless it was, in taking such horses and neces- 
saries as could not be dispensed with in their ill-advised and unfor- 
tunate expedition, tradition here records nothing against them, — 
not a single act of hostility or cruelty. 

Eminent Men and Families. — As far back as can be traced, the 
Johnstones were in possession of the most extensive estates in the 
upper district of Annandale; and of all the numerous families bear- 
ing this ancient name, the Johnstones of Lochwood were acknow- 
ledged as the chiefs. This distinguished family maintained their 
ground not only against foreign enemies from the borders of Eng- 
land, but also against the Lords of Sanquhar, the family which 



112 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



became Earls of Dumfries; and against the powerful and an- 
cient family of the Maxwells, Lords of Nithsdale. It was John- 
stone of Lochwood, assisted by Kirkpatrick of Closeburn, and 
Grierson of Lagg, who suppressed the insurrection of the Duke 
of Albany and Earl of Douglas, when raising forces against the 
existing royal authority at Lochmaben. -The flying spur, which 
is the crest of the Johnstones, and their motto " aye ready," seem 
to have been appropriate; for they carried that family safe through 
the civil wars, the Usurpation, and the Revolution ; and their va- 
lour and patriotism obtained for the family of Johnstone of Loch- 
waod, from Charles T. the title of Lord Johnstone ; from Charles 
IL that of Earl ; and from WiUiam III. that of Marquis of An- 
nandale. The principal estate in this parish and district has de- 
scended to Mr Hope Johnstone of Annandale, to whom it is be- 
lieved the titles also, in so far as claimed, of right belong, and 
whose restoration to the dormant honours of the family would afford 
universal satisfaction in this part of Scotland ; because it is the 
general feeling that he has a right to them ; and that in his fa- 
mily, they would not only be supported, but graced. William 
Earl of Annandale was Lord High Commissioner to the General 
Assembly in 1705 and 1711, Charles Earl of Hopetoun in 1723, 
1725, and 1726, and John Earl of Hopetoun in 1754. 

Robert Johnston, Esq. of St Anne's London, bequeathed to Lord 
Johnstone L. 1000, for erecting a grammar-school in Moffat, and 
gave other handsome legacies to various towns and cities, for the 
pubUc advantage; among which appears a sum of L.3000 to the 
magistrates of Edinburgh, for the benefit of the industrious poor 
there, and for giving them useful employment. 

The very eccentric yet highly talented Dr Moffat, wrote, in the 
time of Cromwell, a treatise on Foods, which is still extant; and was 
personally known to that great usurper. 

Bishop Whiteford of Brechin was proprietor of Moffat, and of 
other lands in this parish, in the time of Charles I. His daughter. 
Miss Whiteford, married James Johnstoneof Corehead, the bishop's 
chamberlain,— who thereupon became disponee to the bishop's lands 
in Moffat and Kirkpatrick- Juxta, of which an old decree for valua- 
tion of the teinds bears date 1637, four years after the act 1633 
passed; and the disposition of the lands was in 1639.

stone, M. D. became distinguished in his profession ; he analyzed 
the mineral waters. 

The accession of John Earl of Hopetoun to the management 
of the great estate of Annandale was auspicious ill many respects 
for Moffat. The house belonging to the descendants there, was 
then erected ; and the influence of this accession led also to the 
erection of two houses for the purpose of inns, one of which was 
long occupied as the King's Arms, and afforded such accommo- 
dation as was very unusual at the time of its erection. The 
good Earl James of Hopetoun occasionally resided in Moffat 
House, — at once the patron and example of all that is con- 
nected with the fear of God and benevolence towards mankind. 
His excellent and lamented daughter was like her father; and 
the names of the late Sir William and Lady Anne Johnstone 
Hope are never mentioned but vith esteem and regret: The 
house is now again fitted up as the residence of some of that fa- 
mily, who have a personal as well as a hereditary claim to the re- 
spect of the people of Moffat. Sir George Clerk Maxwell was 
one of the commissioners for the good Duke Charles of Queens- 
berry ; and the influence he possessed, his residence at Dumcrieff 
in this parish, and his eminent public spirit and talents, alto- 
gether were very highly beneficial to this part of the country. 

The Rev. Dr Walker, minister of Moffat, and who was trans- 
lated to the chair of Natural History at Edinburgh, has left many 
admirable specimens of his distinguished qualifications for that 
office. 

Mr Boyd, the celebrated banker, was born at Moffat, and enter- 
tained a kindly regard at all times for the place of his nativity. 

The late Dr Rogerson of Russia having realized a handsome 
fortune in his honourable profession, and by the exercise of talents 
of a very high order, purchased large estates in this district, built 
a respectable mansion at Dumcrieff, to which he was partial as a 
place of residence and retirement ; and settled and ended his life 
there, leaving it to his son and family, a legacy of future benefi- 
cence to the poor of Moffat. 

It would be improper to omit here the name of Mr Murray, a 
native of Moffat, who has risen to high distinction as a scientific 
improver of the chronometer, and who has lin-nished a church 
clock, as a mark of regard to this parish. 

Landholders.— are, Mr Hope Johnstone of Annandale,

hill ; the heirs of the late Mr Tod of Heatheryhaugh ; the heirs 
of the late Adam Amos, Esq. ; Alexander Craig, Esq. of Burn- 
braes ; and various other persons, owners of land and houses in 
Moffat or near to it. 

Parochial Registers. — These have been generally kept with at- 
tention, extending back to 1709, as far as relates to the minutes, 
and to 1723, as far as relates to the lists ; and the heritors, in or- 
der to preserve these, have lately been at the expense of getting 
them all new bound up in a durable and respectable manner. But 
many parents neglect to record the dates of the birth of their child- 
ren. 

Antiquities. — In the list of these may be mentioned that part 
of the old Roman road up the vale of Annan towards Crawfurd, 
which is still visible in part, but which contains nothing, except 
what has often been described. The Romans have, on this hne, 
put down long paving-stones, as the more durable mode of work- 
ing. There is little recorded of the Frenchland Tower, which re- 
mains in tolerably good preservation, and seems rather to have been 
the residence of the family to which it belonged, than a jilace of 
strength. 

Another and an older ruin is what is called the Comal Totcer, 
on the south side of Molfat Water, and which is said to have been 
the property and residence of Johnstone of Redacres, a younger 
branch of the family of Corehead. 

Some of the old eminences, called motes, exist in this parish, 
but tradition gives no special account of them. 

III. — Population.

Character and Habits of the People. — The habits of the people 
are particularly decent and cleanly, and their language is among 
the best samples of English to be found in any Scottish village. 
The gray plaid, thrown round the. body, or across one shoulder 
and under the opposite arm, is still common. Curling with heavy 
dressed stones on the ice is the favourite amusement in winter. 
There is a bowling green ; and a billiard table 'is prepared at the 
bath-rooms. A subscription and a circulating library furnish the 
people with books, exclusive of two daily newspapers and many 
others. There is hardly any smuggling or poaching ; and low and 
gross acts of immorality are seldom heard of in Moffat. 

IV. — Industry. 

The real rent of lands in this parish is about L. 8000; of which 
are paid from sheep L. 5750, and from corn and cattle, L, 2250. 
The sheep-walks comprehend, it is believed, about 34,200 acres ; 
the land in cultivation, about 3750 acres; natural woods, 200 
acres, and plantations 250 acres. In all, 38,400 acres. 

This view of the proportion of the land in cultivation corresponds 
with what was reported in the Statistical Account of 1791, when 
it was considered as about 3000 Scotch acres, being nearly the 
same as 3750 acres English ; and in this respect there seems to be 
on the whole very little alteration. But though the extent of 
lands in culture is nearly the same, it is well known that the mode 
of cultivation is greatly improved. 

The noble author of a celebrated work on emigration was of opi- 
nion, that, for such lands as those of Moffat parish, it was only ne- 
cessary to have the shepherd and his dog. ' But a reasonable propor- 
tion of the lands m cultivation adds materially to the safety and 
value even of the sheep.; and they are indispensable to the com- 
forts and subsistence of that population, by whose labours shel- 
termg walls are erected for the use of the sheep stocks, and green 
crops and sown grasses raised for the support of stocks that re- 
quire it,-corn and cattle entering into the system, with sheltering 
plantations equally beneficial to the owners and their flocks and 



UG 



DUMFRIES-SIIIRE. 



advantageous to landholders and to the community. It is in 
conformity with such an improved system of management that 
the agriculture of this parish is now conducted, and by a judi- 
cious and respectable tenantry. There are about 400 milch cows 
and 550 young cattle in the parish, besides the sheep, and from 
these and the crop lands must be made up the proportion of the 
rent. That part of the rent which is paid from sheep is very 
handsome, but the tenants are provided with suitable accommoda- 
tions; and by means of skill and capital, with lands of a sound qua- 
lity, and flocks of an established character, they are enabled to 
pay large rents, to employ many servants and artisans, and thus 
to divide, with their landholders and with the community, the be- 
nefits of their farming industry. 

Produce. — It is the common rule, that the gross returns from 
farms in general ought to rise to about three times the rents ; and 
this proportion holds in general as to arable and cattle farms ; but 
the whole gross returns of this parish do not much exceed twice 
the rental, and this arises from the greater part being under sheep.

Manufactures. — There is a good corn-mill at Moffat ; also a 
sawi7ig-mill for timber, and a falling-ynUl for cloth ; with various 
looms for making stockings ; and the necessary proportion of skilful 
tradesmen in the various branches required for the village and 
neighbourhood. 

The straw-plait for bonnets was recommended for trial at Mof- 
fat, and no situation appears more promising. The prices have 
fallen much, but still the manufacture would be of some use, both 
for sale and for wear. The material is cheap, and the labour is 
manual, so that it well deserves to be tried, and to meet encourage- 
ment. In the cleanly houses at Moffat, the young women might 
do something at bonnet-making, while the elder females worked at 
spinning and netting into stockings, of strong woollen yarn, or at 
any other work that can be furnished, so as to give them the credit 
and comfort of doing something for their own support, — an object 
of great importance and of growing necessity. 

Agricultural Society. — There is a farming association here, 
which, by stimulating attention to the improvement of stock, has 
been very useful, even at a time rather inauspicious. When the 
value of stock had sunk so far in proportion to that of money, as to 
render the payment of rents, without considerable abatement, hard- 
ly practicable ; even in these circumstances the intrinsic value of 
stock has been considerably improved, in consequence of the pub- 
lic notice excited bv this Association, 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Toion Market Sfc. — The police of the town was lately very 
inadequate ; but has been improved by the nomination of special 
constables and peace-officers. There are two residing magistrates 
in Moffat, and the court of Justices meets there once a-month. 
There is a weekly market ; but it were better if it were to be held 
only once a-month, when, of course, it would be more fully at- 
tended. 

Means of Communication. — The means of communication are 
excellent in the directions of Glasgow and Carlisle, and also 
towards Dumfries and Edinburgh. The road also to Selkirk by the 
lakes is good ; but though another line has been opened by Hut- 
ton, branching to Eskdalemuir, or to Dunnabie, the road to Loch- 
mabcn is still imperfect, and a direct line to Closeburn is wanting. 
An assorting Post-Office at Moffit is well kept and very useful, but 
a post conveyance by Lochmaben to Annan is still wanted. The

mail-coaclv lines ave only about 16 miles long within llie parisii ; 
all the roads and bridges are kept in safe order, and coaches cross 
one another daily in each of the lines to Glasgow and Edinburgh. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church was rebuilt in 1790, and, by 
the liberahty of James Earl of liopetoun, it was put down on some 
ground of his own among aged and venerable trees, in a most 
appropriate site, and not in the church-yard. His Lordship also 
made the building larger and handsomer at his own expense. It 
accommodates about a thousand sitters ; and contains two square 
seats allotted for strangers, and also a few pews for the poor. 
The manse was built in 1771, and an addition to it in 1810. The 
glebe is let at L. 25 rent ; and the stipend is now 17 chalders, or 
for the present year, L. 240 Sterhng. In the continued indispo- 
' sition of the Rev. Mr Johnston, he allows a sum for the regular 
services of the pulpit, which are performed by Mr Wilson, preach- 
er of the Gospel. The parish church is attended by about 335 
families ; and the number of communicants in the sacrament of the 
Lord's supper is seldom under and sometimes above 500. 

There is a Burgher meeting-house in Moffat ; but it cannot be 
very fully attended, or endowed, as only a small proportion of the 
parishioners are dissenters. 

Religious Societies.— There have been two religious or Bible 
associations in Moffat for many years ; one female and one male. 
These have contributed regularly for sacred purposes. A Sab- 
bath-school is taught in the afternoon, and well attended in the 
parish church. The collections at the parish church are respect- 
able, and are supported by liberal contributions from the heritors ; 
there being many poor in Moffat, and a great want of employment 
for the industrious poor, especially in winter. Farmers are not 
made liable for one-half the sums yearly assessed, most of the he- 
ritors paying the whole for their land. The collections at the 
meeting-house cannot be very great. 

Education. — No situation appears more favourable than Mof- 
fat for the purposes of education. A boarding and day-school for 
girls would be very convenient, if all the branches they required 
could be well taught in the village. There are some arrangements 
in view as to the two principal schools, of which it were premature 
to mention particulars; only a conjoined seminary, out of both as an 
academy, would be very beneficial, and might also be expected soon 
to prosper. In the meantime, a s\ibscription-school is well and

ably taught, though not very well attended ; and there are various 

other schools in the place. i . c • , v . 

C7mnY«W./«.t«n4--The Female Benevolent Societyhas 

done much good; a friendly society did not succeed, nor a parish 

bank, chieflj from the low rate of interest. One of these might now 

be tried again, with the aid and concurrence of David Jardine 

Esq. agent for the Glasgow Union Bank, as he could transac 

without the former expense and risk of money-carnage, and that 

bank allows a half per cent, of interest more than some others. 

Poor.- The funds of the poor consist of about L. 50 per annum 
from church collections, from L. 50 to L. 60, which arise from legal 
assessments, and of contributions over and above to the amount ot 
about L. 20. The number of claimants is about 50. 

Fuel— The fuel mostly used is coal, from Douglas ; and the 
price per hundred weight in Moffat lOd. to Is. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
A comparison of the present state of things loith what it was about 
forty years ago may be considered as one of the most interesting 
objects of this new series of statistical reports. 

Since the last Statistical Account was written, not only the po- 
pulation, as before shewn, has greatly increased, but the land rents 
have risen from L.3300 to about L.8000; while in the country 
part of the parish most of the farm-houses and offices have been re- 
built, and a large extent of stone fences erected. Many of the cot- 
tages have been rebuilt also ; and most of these have been covered 
with slate roofs, as the farm-houses and offices have been. Around 
the village, important and attractive improvements have taken 
place. The lands have not only been improved, but villa buildings 
have been erected on a plan combining ornament with comfort; at 
the same time, many new houses have been erected ; one of which, 
now constructing by Mr Macmillan, merchant, is on a very superior 
plan. The church has been rebuilt, and the parish school. The new 
baths have been erected on a superior plan, with reading-room and 
bowling-green. The meal-house and market have been opened up ; 
a square in the centre of the village has also been opened with plenty 
of the finest spring water, in a cistern for public use. The streets 
are always kept in comfortable order; there is a regular market for 
beef and mutton; mail-coaches pass and repass daily, and post 
liorses and carriages may be hired at the principal inn ; all the 
roads and Ijridges communicating with Moffat are now good, safe.

and easy ; and the lodgings for strangers are much improved, af- 
fording also far more extensive accommodation. Even the pub- 
lic roads and walks around the village have been considerably 
improved. Nuisances of all sorts are carefully interdicted, and 
measures taken generally for making such important and exten- 
sive improvements, as have raised the character of Moffat to be 
one of the most attractive watering villages, and one of the most 
comfortable places of residence ; and these improvements being 
under the eye as well as the patronage of the family of Annandale, 
who take pleasure, and have an interest, in the property of Moffat, 
there is no doubt of their being carried on as far as the public 
ought to expect. 

In the cultivation of the arable soils a very great improvement 
has been made; and, by removing obstructions, duly manuring and 
working the lands, observing a proper improved rotation, and keep- 
ing down or destroying noxious weeds, — and farther, by cultivating 
the most valuable crops, it is not too much to say, that within forty 
years the returns of the arable soils have become far better, as well 
as more abundant. The single practice of feeding off sheep on 
turnip lands has been of incalculable benefit. 

As to stocks, if the village cows be excepted, which are pastured, 
it is believed, in too great numbers, and if we also except some 
of the cottagers' cows, the quality of the cattle has been very much 
improved, and the sheep stocks perhaps even more so, within the 
last forty years ; and whatever the prices may now be, affected as 
these are by various causes, and among others by the state of the 
currency, the improvement in quality has been certain and exten- 
sive. 

Let any one now look into the cottages, and he will find them 
nearly or fully as comfortable as the farm-houses were forty years 
ago; and let him compare the dress of the cottagers and their mode 
of living with that of the farmers at the above distance of time, he 
will find that at present they are not greatly inferior. 

And yet it is certain there is a tendency to depression, chiefly 
arising out of want of employment and reduced rates of wages, 
both of which are partly to be ascribed to the influx of labourers 
from Ireland ; the remedy for which is neither very easy nor very 
obvious. The wandering poor are now sent to individual houses to 
be supphed with necessaries, and forwarded to the places to 
which they belong ; but they are not encouraged, as formerly, to 
wander across the country, and to haunt any where in it at then- 



MOFl-'AT. 121 



own discretion. Accordingly, the system oi public heyncj havnig 
thus become less easy and less profitable, it is hoped that many of 
the wandering poor have returned to the places where they are 
known, and that some of them have resumed habits of mdustry, for 
their numbers have been reduced in this neighbourhood; and this 
ought to enable the farmers and others, who formerly were sub- 
jected to such a burden, to give more liberally into the collections 

for the parish poor. 

The practice of irrigation has not been much tried m this pa- 
rish, perhaps on account of the sheep stocks, and the suspicion that 
rot among them would follow. But if lands are not watered m sum - 
mer, this does not happen; and there is no danger at all if the 
water be not laid on before Michaelmas, nor continued past the 

first week of April. 

Another mode of improving soft meadows,— by draining, levelhng, 
and hming the soil, is of great importance ; and as it requires above 
L. 5 per acre, landholders would act wisely in allowing the cost and 
carriage of lime, provided the meadows were not to be broken up, 
and were to be generally kept in pasturage, and not to be cut for 
hay above once in the three years. This plan would answer well 
with the new system of half-bred lambs, which has paid so abun- 
dantly hitherto ; and in order to carry it on to more advantage, a 
part of the hill grounds might farther be enclosed off", and improv- 
ed in cultivation ; and by laying down well-limed into rich grass, to 
feed them to more advantage, and in quietness and seclusion from 
the other stocks. This would pay well, and furnish also useful em- 
ployment, and at least 500 acres might thus be added to the lands 
in culture, perhaps even twice that extent. 

Of building materials at Moffat, the blue whinstone is particu- 
larly valuable ; it cuts better than granite, and lasts almost as long; 
it is so hard that the workmen strike fire with steel from it ; they 
raise and dress it in pieces of convenient thickness, and it looks 
beautiful in front of a building, and turns damp off it, if well-joint- 
ed and laid. Sandstone, and even Portland stone, are hardly thought 
equal to this blue whin, the finer variety of which has to be carried 
some distance to Moffat. It is that variety of the greywacke through 
which the quartz solution appears to have diffused itself, and which 
renders it so hard and so durable. 

There is a heavy red clay near Moffat, which, before the use of 
lime, was commonly used in building. It is a fire-clay, — stands 
well at the back of chimneys, and was used for making the brick 



/ 



122 



DUMFRIES-SHIUE. 



of wlucli the Spur Inli was built, about 70 years ago. A trial has 
been made of some of this clay near the town-head for bricks, but 
it has not answered so well, and perhaps there may be some differ- 
ence in the quahty, or defect in the trials last made. 

One accommodation is much wanted still by farmers, a cool 
shade in hot weather for cattle and sheep, in some lofty situation, 
and at the same time quite accessible. Plantations collect and mul- 
tiply flies, instead of protecting the stocks ; lofty and shady trees 
are much preferable. Water is of use to black cattle against ver- 
min, if deep enough for the tip of their tails to reach it. In some 
cases a moveable shed might be of great advantage. Sheep are 
commonly sent in hot weather to higher cooler pastures. 

It may be remarked, that man/ substances might be applied to 
useful purposes, but are entirely neglected. The bark of the alder 
tree dyes black, and the wood of it burnt into charcoal makes the 
finest gunpowder. These are only mentioned as mere samples of 
that callous inattention and negligence, by which advantages are 
thrown away. The dye-stuff mosses, which are to be found in 
abundance on the rocks and trees, are equally neglected, though 
in a country less informed in the remote Highlands the use of 
these, and of alder-bark, and of heath, and other native plants, has 
been known and attended to from a remote period of time. 

The best walks for visitants at Moffat at present are in the dry 
and well-kept pubhc roads, but it would be a great additional com- 
fort for them if walks were made up to the heights, and through 
the plantations, and so as to give walkers an opportunity of visit- 
ing the well in that direction, but not to allow of persons on horse- 
back taking these walks. 

For the purpose of recreation, an occasional visit may be made 
to the old caves at Newton, cut oiit of the sandstone rock, and 
thence to the Hartfell Spa, the path leading to which is rude 
and romantic. A pic-nic party may have moderate exercise in 
another direction to Earl Randolph's Tower, taking refreshments 
on the moat opposite to it on Coatshill. A similar moderate de- 
gree of exercise would bring the party into Craigieburn wood, 
where there is a charming glade for a place of refreshment. The 
Bell Craig Rock and Linn deserve and will reward a similar visit. 
Any of these moderate excursions may be accomphshed betwixt 
the hours of breakfast and dinner. But if more distant places are 
deemed proper to be visited, the Gray Mare's Tail, after a fall of 
rain, will repay the trouble of a visit, or, if the visitor be nichned to 



MOFFAT. 123 



go farther to see the lakes and the river Yarrow, the little tower oi 
Dryhope may also be seen, in the distance at least, where tradition 
has said that WySc. was born. If the summit of Hartfell be he 
object, it may be ascended nearly all the way on horseback by the 
farm of Newton. A more distant excursion to the summit of Queens- 
berrv will be rewarded by a rich and beautiful view; but let the riders 
beware of sinking among some green spots on the way. Fishers 
may wish to visit Lochskeen, and to feast on the delicate trout of 
that alpine lake, and their way is by the Birkhill cottage, where 
they will find accommodation and directions. In all of these walks 
the lover of nature and of natural history, especially the botanist 
and mineralogist, will be richly gratified.

PRESBYTERY OF LOCHMABEN, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. DR SINGER, MINISTER. 



1. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, c. — The ancient name of this parish was 
Kilpatrick ; now it is Kirkpatrick- Juxta, as being nearer to the 
capital of Scotland than Kirkpatrick- Fleming, Kirpatrick-Dur- 
ham, and Kirpatrick-Irongray, all of which appear to have de- 
rived their names from the famous missionary. He was a native 
of Scotland, who at the call of Celestine, Bishop of Rome, went 
to Ireland in 432, laboured there with eminent success during forty 
years, and left a name highly regarded both in Ireland and in the 
south and west of Scotland. 

T\ieform of this parish is iiTegular, being bounded on the east 
and north by Wamphray and Moffat ; on the N. W. and west by 
Crawford and Closeburn, and on the south by Johnstone parish. 
It contains very nearly 33 square miles, or about 2] ,000 Enghsh acres. 
In the county map, the lands of Whiteholm, being in the county 
of Lanark, were not included. 

The mountain range of Queensberry on the west runs irregu- 
larly northward; another range of lower hills on the east extends in 
a parallel direction, between 2 and 3 miles distant : and between 
these ranges, is the pastoral valley of Kinnel Water. Betwixt the 
latter hilly range and the river Annan, the tract of ground is nearly 
2 miles broad and 8 miles long ; and this consists of hill and vale, 
and constitutes most of the richer and more valuable portion of the 
parish. It is mostly arable, though about one-tenth of the whole 
is either rocky, or consists of lands formerly moor, but now improv- 
ed, or of peat-moss either cut for fuel or converted into meadow 
land. 

Meteorology. — The temperature has improved sensibly by the 
draining of mossy sheep-walks and cultivation of waste lands. The 
most frequent rains are from the S. W., and the most violent wind

parish, that one set of observations may smt both. W he long 
at times the distance from the sea bemg above 20 niiles, though

'°'SL'lL.-Vaccination is generally practised, and yet vagrants 
ca" their children when ill of small-pox, or just recovered 
Rhemnatism is not unfrequent. There was no - 
die cholera last year in this parish, though many premom ory symp 
toms occurred, and one case of British cholera proved fatal 

Many of the people attain the ae of 80 years and some have 
exceeded 90,_one or two arriving at 96 m the co-se of t 
last 30 years. The climate is considered very healthy, like that 
of the neighbouring parish of Moffat. 

Hyclrographj-The springs, issuing commonly from gravelly 
soils, are very pure ; but near the bases of the high mountains, 
where there is a soil impregnated with iron, and a so in some other 
places, the springs are chahjbeate. Near Garpel Water there is 
a very strong chalybeate, not issuing from the earth as a spring, but 
formed in pools by solution in warm weather, when the rain water 
imbibes and dissolves iron atid alum from the clay. The village of 
Moffat was lately accommodated with conveying to it abund- 
ance of water of the purest quahty from the farm of Chapel m this 
parish, and carried below the bed of Annan. The rivey are not 
considerable ; the Kinnell passes from north to south. The Ivan 
runs between two low hill ranges, both of which may be cultivated 
or planted. The Annan enters the parish from that of Mottat, 
forming a boundary. The Garpel forms a cascade near the old 
castle of Achincass, and falls into the Evan. The Annan, Evan, 
and Moffat Waters, unite their streams, and form one river about 
90 feet broad, below the village of Moffat, and running on a gravel- 
ly bottom, with a current of moderate velocity. The river Annan, 
after leaving the confines of this parish, increases considerably, 
receiving other streams on both sides, and falling into the Solway 
Firth, near the royal burgh of Annan, after a course of about 30 
miles. 

Geolof/ij and Mineralogy.— K survey was pubhshed of the mi- 
neralogical structure of Dumfries-shire by Professor Jameson ; and 
observations were made thereon, in the Edinburgh Review, a con-

siderable number of years ago. The late General Dironi of Mount 
Annan enriched Mr Crawfurd'smap of the county with a descrip- 
tion of the minerals, both in the higher and lower districts, referring 
to a letter addressed to him by Dr Walker, and to " Miscellanea 
Scotica," pubhshed in 1710, and to some notices in Pennant's tour; 
also to a practical survey by Messrs Bushby, which, not having 
been published by the gentlemen of the county, was added by the 
author of this article to his agricultural survey of Dumfries-shire 
in 1811. Some further observations occur on the mineralogy of 
the county, in the article Dumfries-shire in the Edinburgh Ency- 
clopsedia. In this parish no freestone quarries have been worked ; 
but there are quantities of trap-rock, and of greywacke, or blue 
stone, which are used for the purpose of common building. Masses 
of loose rocks appear on various lands, and especially on the lands 
of Craiks Craigs ; but on the bottom of Evan, or others of these 
rivers, the joer trap rocks appear stratified, and their dip is com- 
monly to the south and west, and nearly vertical, occasionally dis- 
covering calcareous spar intermixed. There is no solid granite 
rock in the parish or the county ; nor have any ores or fossil re- 
mains worth notice been discovered. 

II. — Civil History, 
There is a county map which was executed by Mr Crawfurd 
about thirty years ago, at the expense of the landholders. The 
names of the heritors, taken in the order corresponding with the 
extent and value of their estates, are as under, viz. Mr Hope 
Johnstone of Annandale, M. P. ; his Grace the Duke of Buc- 
cleuch ; Miss Munro Johnstone of Corehead ; Lieutenant- Gene- 
ral Sharpe of Hoddam, M. P. ; Mr Younger of Craigielands ; 
the heirs of Mr Paterson of Langbedholm ; and Mr Tweedie of 
Oliver. 

Parochial Registers. — The parish register has been long con- 
tinued, but with one considerable space of time blank when it was 
neglected. The first volume begins in 1692, when Mr Thomas 
Goldie was ordained, and extends to 1697. The second volume 
begins in 1736, when Mr William Scott was ordained, and ex- 
tends to 1755, and thence the record extends to 1769 and 1787. 
The late Mr Scott carried it to 1799, from which time it has been 
continued to this year. It contains a record of births and mar-

only resides for about half the year. 

Land-Rents. — The lowest rental of a proprietor is L. 150 ; one 
rental is above L. 600 ; another above L. 1000 ; and the highest 
above L. 2000. The whole are about L. 5000.

Rent, Wages, Prices, Sfc. — The average of arable land per acre 
may be worth L. 1 of rent ; good hill pasture, 5s. ; inferior, 2s. 
per acre. The grazing of an ox or cow for summer costs 
L. 3, exclusive of winter fodder, which costs L. 4 more. The 
year's grazing of a full-grown sheep is 5s. on the mountain pas- 
tures : and may cost 10s. when fed and fattened in the low dis- 
tricts. A man's days wages in summer are Is. -Gd. ; in winter, Is. 
to Is. 2d. A tradesman expects a.bout one-third more than a la- 
bourer. Coal carried and put down here costs per cwt. from lOd. to 
Is. : Peats, per cart load, made, carried, and delivered, 2s. 6d. or 
3s. Larch timber, per cubic foot in the wood, costs Is. 2d. : Oak and 
ash, per foot in the wood, from Is. lOd. to 2s. 3d. : Butter per lb. 
of 24 oz. in summer. Is. : Cheese per lb. of 24 oz. avoirdupois, 4d. 
to 6d. : Beef or mutton per lb. of 16 oz. about 5d. : Wool per 
stone, of 24 lb. coarse, 7s. to 9s. ; fine, 16s. to 20s. : A male 
farm-servant s wages for the year are from L. 10 to L. 12 : A 
female farm-servant s wages for the year, from L. 6 to L. 7. 

Breeds of Cattle and Sheep, Sfc. — The breed of Gallowag cattle 
has been greatly improved of late. The breeds of Cheviot and 
black-faced sheep have also been improved. 

The improvement of the lands in tillage, by draining, fencing, 
manuring, and green crops, has of course tended materially to 
improve the live stock ; and the same effect has been promoted 
hi a different manner by such farmers as had it in their power to 
raise hay by irrigation. 

Leases, Sfc. — The general duration of leases for arable farms is 



KIRKPATRICK-JUXTA. 



129 



from 15 to '21 years; and for sheep farms, 13 years.— Tlie farm- 
builclinos and fences are in a constant state of progressive im- 
provement. 

Obstacles to Improvement— The obstacles to improvement have 
chiefly arisen out of the fall in all the prices of land produce, winch 
has been about one-third; while rents, paid in money at old rates, 
continued the same, and abatements were not always given fully to 
compensate for this deficiency in the returns. There seems also 
to be an increasing deficiency in the circulating medium to answer 
the purposes of an augmented commerce and population. The 
most threatening obstacle to agriculture in Britain is the dange- 
rous and erroneous idea, that poor soils ought not to be cultivated. 
Now, about three-fourths of the corn lands of Britain were poor 
soils at one time ; and some of these have become rich by manures 
and culture ; and to what subject is it possible to apply capital 
and industry to more advantage than in the improvement of bar- 
ren moor and moss, turning the former into cultivated fields, and 
the latter into meadow The most useful employment is here 
conjoined with the means of obtaining subsistence for the labour- 
ers, as well as for the community ; and the permanent returns 
from and value of the land are steadily advanced. 

The last corn law, by admitting grain at all times, and letting 
it out when the prices are high, has prevented all cause of alarm, 
and has also preserved the prices at a moderate and rather equal 
rate, allowing them even to fall too low. The rash project of abo- 
lishing this law, trusting to foreign supplies, and throwing the poor 
lands out of cultivation, is fraught with ruin to the capital, the in- 
dustry, and the resources of the kingdom. 

Let the currency be made safe, but allowed to circulate in suffi- 
cient abundance ; let the land produce as well as manufacturing 
produce be duly protected; and let the corn laws encourage a libe- 
ral and extended cultivation ; and in the nature of things all clas- 
ses will find the benefit. Then give a preference to home produce 
in the granaries and markets of the kingdom, and it will become 
plentiful and cheap also ; but let foreign produce pay duty when 
imported, and the merchants will purchase home-grown as well as 
foreign corn. The dread of constant and speculative interfe- 
rence with that industry which it requires long time to establish, — - 
indeed the very proposal of interference made by men in public 
office or station, and not discouraged, has a most pernicious effect 

DUMFRIES. I

DUMFRIES-SIIIIIE. 



on the public mind. It paralyses industry, deranges improvement, 
withdraws capital, and renders experience and skill of little use. 

Modern Improvements.— The use of bone manure for turnip land, 
and the feeding off of turnips with sheep, are two capital improve- 
ments on dry land ; and the culture of peat-mosses to be laid down 
to meadows, and irrigated if possible, is another. Industry is ne- 
cessary to keep up the fertility even of rich lands, along with capi- 
tal and skill. All these, and the most productive modes of mdus- 
try, together with the subsistence and independence of the nation, 
would be endangered by relaxing the agriculture of these kingdoms. 

Produce.— The gross produce of the whole parish from sheep 
and cattle, as well as corn lands, has been computed at about 
L. 13,000, and the rent being L.5000, is above the usual propor- 
tion, but abatements of rent have been allowed.— The returns of 
course vary according to seasons and prices, and they have altered 
much in the present year, grain having fallen much in value, and 
the produce from sheep and wool having risen. The following 
table can only be considered as approximating to the average re- 
turns, viz. :

The total returns coming to about L. 13000 

There have been so many abatements of land rent allowed, as 
to show the necessity of lowering those lands not recently taken. 
These abatements have run at an average to about 20 per cent. ; 
and on this computation the net rental extends only to L. 4000 a- 
vear Most of the land rents of this parish being carried out ot it 
and spent elsewhere, it stands greatly in need of such fostenng at- 
tentions and improvements as landholders can give to its growmg 
agriculture, by roads, fences, manures, buildings, and encouraging 

'Sz..e..-Relief may be had for servient lands under the sta- 
tute; but landholders commonly relieve tenants of cultures 
their own mills, leaving them at liberty to go to any mill. Still, 
the tacksmen of the mills have some understanding with one an- 
other as to the charges of grinding as well as kiln-drying ; of which

last duty the millers ought to be relieved ; and then a fortieth of 
the oatmeal would compensate for grinding oats, and a fixed price 
might be given for wheat and barley. But in all cases the dust and 
offals should belong to the farmer, who should also see his grain 
dried first and next ground, so as to know the precise outcome, and 
of course the true value. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Markets, §-c.— Moffat, at the distance of three miles from the 
centre of this parish, possesses a post-office and weekly market ; 
and also March and October fairs, with a cattle and sheep show 
and sale in September. The only regular village \ Craigielands, 
built by Mr Younger some years ago, to accommodate the people 
on his lands, consisting of neat small buildings, on a regular plan, 
for 12 families, — the rent being only interest on the outlay. 

Means of Communication. — There is one turnpike road from 
Glasgow to Carlisle, and another intersecting it at Beattock Inn, 
from Dumfries to Edinburgh, with mail-coaches daily on both 
lines. The parish roads are mostly in a decent state of repair. 
An excellent inn was erected near Beattock, on the lands of 
the Duke of Buccleuch, which was paid for as public accommoda- 
tion by the Treasury, and is kept in a superior and most satisfac- 
tory manner by a respectable family, who came to it from Eng- 
land. The length of the turnpike lines in this parish is about 20 
miles ; but no railways or steam-carriages have yet been introdu- 
ced, nor any canal, though all these have been spoken of. The 
bridges are kept in a safe and decent condition. The fences are 
good, so far as they consist of regular walls, built of good stone, 
and to the due height of at least five feet ; but where the soil is 
light and gravelly, it does not bear them so well as beech hedges, 
in either of which it has been found that gaps may be filled by 
cuttings of elder or bower-tree. 

Ecclesiastical State. — T\\q parish church is conveniently situated, 
was built in 1799, and thoroughly repaired in 1824, accommodat- 
ing from 500 to 600 persons ; and the communion table not being 
appropriated, affords at least 50 free sittings. The manse is about 
40 years old, was never very sufficient, but has been at different times 
repaired. The teinds were surrendered in lieu of stipend in 1805, 
and, including meal, lambs, and wool, payable in kind, they come 
generally to about L. 220 of stipend, exclusive of L. 8, 6s. 8d. 
contributed for clement-money by voluntary a:greement. The 



132 DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 

glebe contains about four acres arable, and five acres meadow, 
moss, and garden, with policy; and the whole is worth L. 10 
a-year. The legal right to grass, in addition, has never been 
prosecuted for, nor made good to the minister, nor an equivalent 
asked. 

There is no chapel of ease, nor dissenting meetmg-house ; 
nor are there above four or five families of dissenters or seceders 
within this parish, which contains not one Catholic residenter, nor 
one of the Episcopal persuasion. The number of communicants 
is about 380, out of 981 people,— not including strangers who 

join in that ordinance. 

Religious Societies.— There is a Bible Society, which is renew- 
ed every three years, whose little funds go to various religious 
purposes. A weekly prayer meeting has been long in existence, 
and is attended by a few of the heads of families. 

Education is regularly conducted in two parochial and two con- 
tribution schools ; and there are also three other inferior schools 
in the parish,— the whole of them affording instruction to above 
200 children. The salary of the first parish schoolmaster is 
L 34 4s 4d. being the value of the maximum of two chalders, 
and that of the second school, where the teacher labours during 
pleasure, not being regularly settled, is equal to one chalder, 
L 17 2s 2d The school fees are very moderate, and cannot 
exceed from L. 15 to L.20 a-year in each of the three principal 
schools, exclusive of Candlemas presents, being about L. 3 m each 

of them. . J 

Friendly Societies, c.-A friendly society, constituted on prin- 
ciples too flattering to be implemented, and a bank for savings, 
were both lately dissolved, the interest being small, and the Dum- 
fries banks remote, with some risk and expense in remittances. 

Poor.— The regular number on the poors' list varies from 8 
to 10 or 12 ; and there are several, indeed many others, who need 
incidental aid in various ways for themselves and their children. 
The average yearly amount of church collections for the poor is 
ibout L 30. The average allowance for those on the regular list 
is rather above L.4 a-year to each. The collections do not suf- 
fice without voluntary contributions, in which none of the heritors 
are deficient, the principal heritor setting an example ; and, in 
years of emergency, such as 1800, subscriptions and contributions 
Teingmadeby the heritors and parishioners voluntarily ; so that 
no legular assessments are necessary for the support of the pooi. 



KIRKPATRICK-JUXTA. 133 

Above L. 52 in whole are distributed annually ; the heritors con- 
tributing about ten shillings for every L. 100 land rent, which, 
with the collections, answer in ordinary years. A general contri- 
bution takes place in emergent seasons. 

Inns.— The parish contains one good inn, and two other licensed 

alehouses. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Improve77ie7its.—The improvements made since 1800 have been 
very remarkable, chiefly in the church, the schools, the farm- 
buildings, the roads, fences, and lands. It is not less remarkable 
on the dress of the people ; and has also been considerable in their 
mode of living. The people are still regular in administering to 
persons in want among themselves, though far more to unknown 
beggars and vagrants. Some regulations against common begging 
have been lately adopted, but, owing to the want of co-operation, 
have been given up again. 

Lime and Coal. — Lime and coal are still very distant ; the near- 
est lime above 20, and the nearest coal 30, mile ; and sandstone 
is not worked nearer than 12 miles. The trials for coal have never 
been made to a satisfactory depth in any part of this county, ex- 
cept where it has been found and worked, at Sanquhar and Can- 
nobie. 

The following notices may be added, 1st, In 1637, James John- 
stone, of Corehead resided at Lochhouse, and having married 
Miss Whiteford, only child of the Bishop of Brechin, also parson 
of MolFat, he led a valuation of the teinds of his own lands and of 
those of the bishop in this parish, and in that of Moffat, only four 
years after the act 1633, allowing such valuations to be made once 
for all ; an act to which the improvement of lands in Scotland is 
greatly owing. — 2fZ, The body of Mr John Taylor, formerly mi- 
nister of Wamphray, was conveyed to and buried in, this parish ; 
a party of Highlanders, on their way to England, under the officers 
of Charles Edward, met the procession, uncovered in passing, but 
sent back a detachment after the funeral was decently concluded, 
and seized on some horses. — Sd, Dumgree was at one time a parish, 
but was annexed partly to Johnstone and chiefly to Kirkpatrick- 
Juxta, within which the unenclosed churchyard of Dumgree now 
lies. — 4//., The old church was covered with heath in the time of 
Mr jrcorge Buchanan, who was minister in 1626. It had been 
from end to end a burying-placc before the Reformation ; but 



134 DUMFRlES-SlllKE. 

the dust and bones which it became necessary to remove at the 
last reparation were carefully and decently deposited in another 
place on the outside of the church. — 5th, In 1803, when a volun- 
teer force was of such eminent service for the peace and defence 
of the kingdom, this parish met for prayer and conference, and 
offered one man for every eight persons of the whole population 
to serve as volunteers in arms, above eighty men holding up their 
hand to give this pledge, and with hardly any distinction be- 
tween church-going people and dissenters. The parish of Moffat 
soon after met and offered 120 men. Then followed the parish 
of Wamphray, offering 60; and Johnstone thereafter met and 
agreed to a similar offer. After the volunteer force of the nation 
had risen in arms, there appeared no longer any signs of in- 
ternal disaffection. The minister for Scotland, the late Lord Mel- 
ville, had foreseen this happy result ; and the venerated monarch 
happily authorized that important and salutary measure, which 
prevented invasion as well as disturbance. — 6th When the London 
Missionary Society was first set on foot, the late minister of this 
parish remitted to it a collection of L.30. This parish has 
contributed also to most of the religious and charitable purposes 
recommended by a promise of usefulness, and in particular to 
such as were supported by the countenance of the General As- 
sembly of this church, as the Highland schools, to which L. 15 
were first remitted; the Indian mission, to which L. 8 were first 
sent, with annual sums thereafter; the colonial churches also in 
America, to which, and to other charities, various remittances 
went from this parish.— 7f/j, The poor had great need of support 
in 1800, when oat-meal sold for 7s. per stone,— and also in 1812 
and 1817. But the parishioners gave support: and a generous 
donation of L.300 to the poor by Mr William Marchbank,at Upper 
Murthat, after deducting L.30 for duty, afforded L.76 in 1817 
alone, and liberal aid for other seven years following, when employ- 
ment was scarce; until, as he ordered, it was all apphed, and the 
special accounts preserved and exhibited. — Qth, The late Mrs 
Milligan Johnstone of Corehead settled L. 35 as  fund of charity, 
which the minister accumulated to L.90, and which is now lent on 
bond to a distinguished family, who allow interest at the rate of five 
per cent, for it. This is the only fund of the poor at interest here. 
—9th, The greatest desiderata in this parish are proper clumps of 
trees in the sheep-walks, to sheUer the stock, ornament the country, 
and furnish weedings and thinnings for use. Some parts appear

eminently suited to this mode of improvement, stones aboundmg 
for the fencesj-andferns or brakens, indicating a dry and deep soil 
adapted exceedingly for forest trees. It would be high y useful and 
pleasing also to see fruit-trees in most of the gardens of the farmers 
and cot'tagers, and it is hoped this will soon take place, and that 
landholders will encourage it. The want of osiers and willows for 
baskets may be soon and easily supphed, as cuttings may be had gratis 
for this purpose from the minister's lands. To open up the best quar- 
ries for building stones, especially such as Lochhouse Craig, would 
be of use, and chiefly if good freestone were thus worked in a near 
and convenient place. The road across the hills to the lime-works 
at Closeburn, if made, would be of great advantage not only to this 
parish, but to the country generally; and especially if, as part of 
this line, a road were made from Dumcrieff bridge in an equal 
slope to Bodisbeck height, which would make Hawick ten or twelve 
miles nearer, in the course of time this road will probably be 
accomplished, whatever temporary difficulties may obstruct it; and 
it will open an intercourse from the east to the west of Scotland; 
and there is no question that, by dividing equally the summit eleva- 
tion at Bodisbeck, along the whole slope of five miles to Dumcrieff 
bridge, an easy road could be formed there, which would be far 
better, and even more speedy than any steeper intermediate line 
in leading to Moffat; with the advantage of going direct across 
to the westward by the three river meetings on the Closeburn 
line, or of turning southward in the shortest and safest direc- 
tion. The turnpike road for Lochmaben is incomplete, but it 
has been made a branch of the public lines, and ought to be 
completed and supported out of the general funds of the district. 

The great evil of the poor system in Scotland arises out of end- 
less and uninterrupted public begging; and there is no remedy but 
one, viz. to enforce residence in the parishes where the poor are 
known, and where they must work, and will be looked after. If 
residence were enforced every where, and settlements not acquired 
so easily, the poor laws of Scotland would be almost perfect ; and 
neglect of the poor would tease where it now exists. The acts 
recently passed for clearing England of vagrants from Scotland 
and Ireland, require mutual protection to be given to Scotland, 
into which for some years, vagrants from England have begun to 
find their way, besides the hordes that infest it from Ireland. 

Farmers are liable for half of what may be assessed for the poor, 
if landholders do not pay for them ; and every liberal farmer is 



DUMFRIES-SIIlliE, 



prudent also when he gives in to the collections in an exemplary 
manner. It is very injudicious and inconsistent in those, who spend 
shillings weekly on vagrants, to give in only a penny each, or a 
halfpenny to the collection on the Lord's day. The farmers of 
this parish are too well informed and too liberal to act in this man- 
ner. On the high and holy duties of domestic charity, it is more 
blessed surely to give than to receive ; and as one per cent, on 
the land rents almost suffices for aid to the poor, not one of whom 
goes out to beg, and who are all sober, and, as far as possible, in- 
dustrious, and generally also contented and grateful, every advan- 
tage is reaped from the union of charity with gratitude, industry 
with economy ; the helping hand is here welcome and effective ; 
and if other parishes were to look to their own poor, those of this 
and the neighbouring parishes, would be more abundantly assist- 
ed, while protection would be afforded to the public against end- 
less imposition, accompanied with idleness, vice, and often crime.

PRESBYTERY OF LOCHMABEN, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. CHARLES DICKSON, MINISTER. 



L_TOPOGRAPHY AND NaTURAL HiSTORY. 

'Name, Boundaries, c.-Tub ancient name of the parish was 
Wamfnj or Wamfraij, which appears to have been derived trom 
the Scoto-Irish Uamli-fri, signifying the « den or deep glen m 
the forest." Agreeably to this etymology, the site of the church 
and old manse is in a deep and woody recess on the south side ot 
Wamfray Water. This water divides the parish almost diagonally 
from N. E. to S. W.; and in its winding course runs through a 
romantic glen, which appears formerly to have been entirely co- 
vered with wood. Nothing can be conceived more romantic and 
picturesque than the course of that stream, especially from the 
bridge, about half a mile below the present manse, to about two 
miles above it,— bounded as it is on both sides by high steep 
banks, still clad with young and very thriving woods ; in some places, 
barricadoed by shelving rocks of freestone, from which the water 
oozes or flows from the neighbouring fields; in others, by lotty, 
erect, basaltic columns, from the interstices of which may be seen 
frequent saplings of ash, and the whole mantled over with ivy. 

The parish is bounded on the N. by Moffat; on the N. E. by 
Eskdalemuir; on the E. by Hutton ; on the S. by Applegarth; 
on the W. to S. W. by Kirkpatrick-Juxta and Johnstone ; from 
which two latter parishes it is separated by the river Annan. It 
is of an oblong and nearly quadrilateral figure. The average ex- 
tent of the parish in length is nearly 6 miles, and its breadth 
about 3 miles. In all, it contains about 19 square miles. 

Topographical Appearances.— T\vexQ are two mountain-ranges 
in the northern part of the parish, running parallel with the river 
Annan, and with each other, from S. S. W. to N. N. E. and vary- 
ing from 1000 to betwixt 2000 and 3000 feet in height. Besides 
these, there are tWo ranges of hills nearer the south, and runnuig 



138 



DUMFRIKS-SIIIRI-:. 



also nearly parallel with each other, from S. E. to N. W. The lat- 
ter rise from 500 or 600 feet to about 1000 feet above sea level. 
Though some of the lower hills, and some also of the higher, ap- 
proach to a conical form, yet they are chiefly tabular or ridge. 
Most of the low lands are on the banks of the Annan ; and though 
there are some level tracts along it, yet they generally rise with a 
gentle acclivity to the ranges which run parallel with it. There 
are also some fine valleys more confined and secluded ; especially 
that on the Wamphray Water above the church, where there is a 
number of extensive fields above its woody banks, both rich and 
fertile as well as beautiful. Towards the S. E. of the parish, 
where the hills are low and partly arable, at least yield excel- 
lent pasture, the valleys interspersed are perhaps of the deepest 
soil in the parish, and produce excellent crops. The lowest point 
in the parish is on the Annan, at the S. W. extremity, about 200 
feet above sea level. And the highest point is on the N. E. ex- 
tremity, where the two mountain-ranges formerly mentioned meet, 
and terminate at last in the same direction. It is called Lochfell. 
Its elevation is fully 2500 feet above the sea. 

Meteorology. — From observations taken by Fahrenheit's ther- 
mometer at an elevation of 280 feet above sea level, and nearly 
20 feet from the ground, in the shade, with a north-eastern expo- 
sure, it appears that the average temperature of the year 1830 was 
46°, and that of 1831 was 52°. But as these observations were 
not made at exactly similar periods, and as the seasons were also 
of different temperatures, it may be stated that the mean tempe- 
rature is 47°. The greatest height to which the thermometer 
was observed to rise last year was on the 31st July, when it stood 
at noon at 78°, and at two o'clock p. m. same day at 84°. The 
greatest depression in the same year at noon was on the 25th and 
26th January, on both of which days it stood at 28°. Its greatest 
height in 1830 was on the 28th July, when at noon it stood at 
81°, and betwixt two and three o'clock, p. m. same day at 83°, 
and its greatest depression was on the 24th December, when at 
noon it stood at 22 or 10" below freezing point in the shade. The 
mean pressure of the atmosphere, as ascertained at the same place, 
but about ten feet lower, by daily observation with the barometer 
at noon during the last five months of 1831, gives 29.3°. The 
greatest variation took place in December, both the greatest and 
least pressure being in that month ; when, on the 7th, the mercury 
stood at 28.5", and at 30.3° for several days towards the end of ihe

month. Joining to these the two succeeding months of the present 
vear the average of the whole will be 29.4°. 

Cllas winds prevailmu 
beot lP s and though then, during the day they may 
follow the sun, yet they too often -ume ;" 
night, and being commonly accompanied with f-s s hey prove 
vey hurtful to vegetation and the blossoms of fruit-trees I s 
true, indeed, that this parish, enjoying a westerly and Bouth-west- 
erly exposur , is in a great degree screened froi. their piercing cold 
by the large Intervening hills. But when it blows hard, with snow 
from that quarter, we frequently feel its bitter effects, m sweeping 
the dry snow over the heights into the deep glens, and covering the 
ground where the sheep could be best sheltered from the severity 
of the storm ; and thus, unless the shepherd has been on his guard, 
enveloping the unwary animals in its deep wreaths. 

Snozo storm.-This was particularly experienced in the month of 
March 1827, when there occurred the severest storm remembered 
here since 1794. The snow adhering to the top and branches of 
trees, and freezing immediately, bent them downwards with its 
weight, and the wind afterwards acting upon them with force made 
great destruction, especially among the Scotch, spruce, and silver 
fir-trees. It was a sublime sight, after the cessation of the storm, 
to view the avalanche formed in the deep ravine or on the banks ot 
wood, and the shattered remains of trees appearing here and there 
above its surface. As the storm was renewed in all its severity on 
a following day of the same week, a considerable number of sheep 
were lost; but as every exertion was made to recover as many as 
possible, a great number were found under a considerable depth of 
snow a long time after,— some after three or four weeks, and even 
then hving, though much weakened. 

Winds.— The most prevalent winds, and at the same time the 
highest, blow from the south and south-west. These are very 
commonly accompanied with torrents of rain, especially after a 
continuance of dry weather, according to the proverb, " long foul, 
long fair." The inhabitants of this parish are skilled in the usual 
prognostics of the weather, and especially in those afforded by the 
two conspicuous hills of Queensberry and Criffel. 

Climate.— The climate is moist. And this may be accounted 
for by the vapours which rise from the Solway, being driven in 
this direction and attracted by the high hills. The farmer ac- 
cordingly puts the end of his corn-stooks in one or other of theso

directions, and the mason should at least lay his stones in an in- 
clining- position, to carry off' the wet, which is apt to penetrate the 
wall. In fact, very few of our houses in either of these exposures, 
especially of more than one storey, are free from damp. In calm 
damp weather, also, we are sometimes visited with dense fogs. 
But with these exceptions the air is pure, and frequently bracing. 
The ground is dry, or where wet, it has been drained. There 
being no marshes or stagnant pools, the climate in general is very 
salubrious ; and hence few or no epidemics prevail to any extent. 
Perhaps the most common complaints are of the inflammatory 
kind, arising from sudden transitions from heat to cold, and rheu- 
matism. 

Cascades. — There are several cascades in the parish, famous for 
the romantic or picturesque scenery which surrounds them. One of 
them, called Bell- Craig, on the northern boundaries of the parish, 
where it joins that of Moffat, is much visited by the fashionable 
parties that frequent Moffat mineral waters. There are three others 
not far distant from each other on the Wamphray Water, called 
the pot, washing-tub, and Dub's Cauldron. The grandeur of the 
scenerv about all of these falls is much admired. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The rocks in this parish are chiefly 
of the transition or secondary class, though there are some also of 
the primitive formation. Their inclinations and dips are various. 
The rock which prevails most extensively on the lower hills to- 
wards the south of the parish, which are very green, and of a 
bevelled appearance, seems to be greywacke, which, when exposed 
to the atmosphere, crumbles down into small, hard and dry peb- 
bly substances forming excellent materials for roads. In some 
places, a bastard freestone occurs, and also an appearance of lime- 
stone. 

There are three kinds of soils : \st, The deepish holms along 
the Annan. 2d, A light loam of different shades, from a bright 
red colour to a dark brown or even black. 3f, Meadow ground, 
generally covering a light-coloured clay. The subsoil in the low 
ground is generally gravel or sand. Among the heights it is till, 
rotten whin or freestone. 

Zoology and Botany. — The species of animals and plants are 
much the same as those in the neighbouring parishes. As to the 
former, it may be remarked, that a species of caterpillar sometimes 
hurts the gooseberry bushes, and the grub the oats in spring and 
the begiiming of summer. It has also been attributed to insects

that apple-trees do not thrive well in some gardens here. But 
as that happens only in certain soils, it seems rather to be owmg 
to a subsoil of ferruginous till, which is injurious to the roots It 
may also be observed, that, though the wooded plantations thrive 
tolerably well, yet ash as an indigenous, and larch as an oncotic, 
appear to suit our soil fully better than any other. 

IL— Civil History. 
Eminmt Characters.-Theve was a celebrated clergyman in this 
parish, some time before the Restoration, of the name of Brown. 
Soon after that event he was, on account of his prmciples and sen- 
timents, thrown into prison ; and when, in consequence of haymg 
contracted bad health, he petitioned for a release, he was required 
either to languish in its unwholesome dungeon, or sign his last- 
ing expatriation. He adopted the latter sad alternative, and re- 
tired to Holland, where he was afterwards appointed minister 
of the Scotch Church in Rotterdam, and continued in that of- 
fice till his death. During his exile he published many volumi- 
nous works on rehgious subjects, which were then much read. 
Some of them have been lately republished in this country, and 
have been well received. There is also a MS. history of the 
Church of Scotland, written by him in Latin, and deposited in the 
College Library at Edinburgh,— well spoken of by those who have 
seen and consulted it. 

This parish is also famous for being for some time the residence 
and the burial-place of the late Dr Rogerson of Wamphray. He 
appears to have been born in the parish of Johnstone, but to have 
spent his earher years in this parish.  

Land-owners. — Dr Rogerson is the principal proprietor. The 
other land-owners are the Earl of Hopetoun, who is also patron 
of the parish. General Sharpe of Hoddam, Mr Graham of Shaw, 
Mr Carruthers of Milhouses, Mr Rogerson of Girth-head, Mr 
Carruthers of Stenrieshill, the three last only resident, and Mr 
Proudfoot of Hazlebank. The Duke of Buccleuch, it has been 
lately discovered, has a large tract of hill pasture in this parish, 
though that land was long lost out of the county books, and paid 
no public dues, being joined to a farm in Moflfat parish, and ge- 
nerally supposed to belong to that parish. 

Parochial Registers. — There are no parochial registers in the 
possession of the present incumbent previous to the year 1794.

There is indeed one of an earlier date, commencing in 1758, but 
it relates only to collections and matters of a pecuniai-y nature. 
There appears to have been others, but they were either destroyed 
or carried away during the incumbency of one Donaldson, a per- 
son of dissipated habits, who was superseded by an ordained as- 
sistant in 1794. Since that time they have been kept as regular- 
ly as circumstances will admit, or as can be expected while regu- 
lar registrations are not enfprced by legal enactments. It may be 
added, however, that we have seen five or six small books of ses- 
sional records, and we have heard of another, commencing a few 
years after the Revolution, and containing some registers of births. 
But not having yet inspected them, we cannot say whether they 
fill up the whole intermediate space. 

Antiquities. — There appears to have been a Roman road for 
four or five miles through this parish, from north to south, near 
to the old road from Glasgow to Carlisle, which is still a turnpike 
road, and where in some places pavement stones are occasionally 
dug up, especially on the lower grounds, where there are a few 
houses forming a small village, called Gilgal or Newton. Along 
this hue, too, there are several large stones, about five or six feet 
in height, fixed firmly and perpendicularly in the ground, and 
supposed to have been placed there by the Romans, probably for 
measuring distances. Several traces of camps, supposed by some 
to be Roman, by others British, are also visible in this parish, 
especially an extensive one near to the fore-mentioned road, and 
another at some distance behind it.  There was also a Druidical 
circle, lately almost entire, on the rising ground towards the east 
from the church ; but now the ground is ploughed, and the stones 
removed. Not far from it are two others of smaller dimensions. 

III. — Population. 

In 1755 the number of inhabitants in the parish was, 458 

1791, ----- 487 

1801, . - - - 423 

1811, 481 

1821, ----- 554 

1831, 580 

The increase betwixt 1811 and 1821 was from the circumstance, 
that the late Dr Rogerson had purchased the estate of Wamphray, 
who, making very great improvements in building, fencing, plant-

ing, &amp;c. held out good encouragement to labourers, and thus ni- 
dLd a number to settle in the parish. From the extensive ope- 
rations then carried on, there was less occasion for continued im- 
provements, at least to a great extent, and hence the population 
has not increased since in the same proportion. In fact, the pio- 
prietors feel reluctant to erect any new dwelhngs, or to give en- 
couragement to cottars farther than what is necessary, partly be- 
cause they are aware of the difficulty of finding them employment, 
and from the threatened scarcity of fuel ; and partly, also, from the 
fear of such inhabitants becoming ultimately burdens upon the pa- 
rish. Of the population in 1831, there are about 500 m the coun- 
try, and the remaining 80 in a village.

There are nine proprietors, the yearlyvalueof each of whose lands 
is upwards of L. 100 Sterling. Three only of these reside in the 
parish, and have extensive farms from the principal proprietor; and 
two of them also occupy their own properties along with these. 
The number of inhabited houses is at present 94. 

Character of the PeopZe.— They are in general well acquainted 
with their respective professions or trades, — regular in their de- 
portment, as well as, with some exceptions, in their attendance 
upon religious ordinances. As the farmers are perhaps the wealth- 
iest in the south of Scotland, their houses are exceedingly clean 
and neat, and they enjoy the comforts as well as the necessaries 
of life. The other classes are also in general cleanly. As most 
of these have small pendicles of a few acres attached to their houses 
and gardens, they possess advantages which might otherwise be 
denied them. Thus enjoying the necessaries of life, they are in 
general contented with their situation and circumstances. We are 
sorry, however, to say, that a few do occasionally poach in game, 
especially the salmon fisheries. A check which they have lately 
received will, we trust, have some effect in restraining it : but till 
the stake-nets on the Solway at the mouth of the Annan are taken

DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



away, and the proprietors in the upper parts of the river have more 
interest in discouraging- it, we are afraid that poaching will continue. 
Our chief annoyance in this way, however, has been from largo 
bands from the borders of England traversing the hills, making 
great havoc among the game, and threatening violence to any who 
dares to oppose them. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and JRural Econo7ii/.— The whole extent of the pa- 
rish is about 12,000 imperial acres; of these there may be in ro- 
tation of grain and green crops, and sown down grass, or occasion- 
ally cultivated, nearly 3000 acres. The remaining 9000 are na- 
tural pasture, consisting partly of green grassy ground, and partly 
of heath and moss. Before the middle of the last century, the 
upper or higher situated fatas were much more subdivided, and 
the cultivation extended much farther. It was at that period laid 
more into extensive sheep-farms; large tracts formerly bearing corn 
became covered with heath and coarse herbage. 

Within the last fifteen years the farmers have begun to find it 
very profitable to break up these neglected grounds, which pro- 
duce luxuriant crops of grain, and when laid down to grass, are 
tripled in value for the pasture of sheep. There seems no doubt 
that this sort of cultivation will yet be carried to a much greater 
extent, probably till 1200 or 1500 acres more have been gone over. 
The obstacle to this beneficial improvement is the distance from 
lime, which is from eighteen to twenty miles ; but this is counter- 
balanced by the deep and dry quality of the soil, free of stones, and 
capable of producing green crops as well as oats in great abundance. 

The capital, spirit, and intelligence which are now possessed by 
the holders of these farms, at least in this parish, will, as observed, 
soon render the land quite productive. Already, there are to be 
seen fine fields of oats and turnips enclosed among the sheep-walks, 
800 feet above sea level. 

There are about 250 imperial acres of planted wood, of which 
about 100 are Scots fir of sixty years' growth, planted by the Earl 
of Hopetoun when proprietor of the Wamphray estate. It is good 
for its age, and much used in farm-buildings, but having little red 
or heart-wood, cannot endure long. Within the last ten years the 
red-wood has increased considerably. There are adjommg the 
ruins of the old mansion of Wamphray a number of Scots hrs of 
good size, generally four or five feet in circumference. These are 



WAMPHRAY. 



145 



known to be 130 or 140 years old. They are nearly all red-wood, 
and the quality equal to any Baltic or Highland fir. This and 
other similar facts show that the Scots fir does not attain its valu- 
able qualities till nearly a century at least. There are nearly 150 
acres more of younger plantations, planted chiefly by the late Dr 
Rogerson, and his son the present proprietor, and also by smaller 
proprietors. These are chiefly larch, which are found so much 
more profitable at an early age. Among these, are planted firs 
grown from seed brought by Dr Rogerson from his estates in Po- 
land,— the same as the Riga and Memel timber imported to Britain. 
It is singular enough that these plants, almost exactly similar to 
our Scots fir, have never thriven in any situation; and these, 
planted about 15 or 16 years ago, though still alive, are puny, and 
evidently want strength and vigour. There are 50 or 60 acres 
of oak and ash of natural growth, chiefly along the banks of the 
water and burns, which thrive very well. 

There are also about 1200 acres of arable land along the Annan 
and Wamphray Water, which produce crops of wheat, barley, and 
every sort of green crop, lying from 200 to 300 feet above sea 
level. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of the acres last referred to 
is about 22s. per imperial acre ; the remainder of the arable land, 
lying higher out, and which is here of inferior quality, may be ge- 
nerally rented at 10s. or 12s. per acre. The common leases are 
fifteen years ; a few are nineteen. The farm-buildings and enclo- 
sures are good. The rental of the parish is about L. 4000 Sterling. 

Rate of Wages. — Men-servants get from five to six guineas, a few 
L. 7, per half year ; maid-servants from L. 2, 5s. to L. 3 per half 
year, with victuals. Common labourers have Is. 6d. or Is. 8d. in 
summer, and Is. 2d. in winter, per day ; masons, carpenters, and 
slaters have each 2s. 6d. in summer, and about 2s. in winter, per 
day, without victuals. 

Produce. — The average amount and value of gross produce yearly 
raised in the parish may be as follows : 

730 acres of grain of all sorts, including fodder, at L. 5 per imperial acre, 

L.3750 0 0 

250 acres green crop, turnips, and potatoes, nearly in equal quantities, 1250 0 0

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Towns.— The nesLYest market-towns are; Moffat, which 
is also the post town, seven miles distant from the centre of the pa- 
rish ; and Lockerby, at the distance of ten miles. 

Means of Communication. — The place with which we have most 
regular communication by carriers is Dumfries. For some months 
past, one of the carriers has travelled to Edinburgh once in the fort- 
night. There are about seven or eight miles of turnpike roads, con- 
sisting chiefly of the old hne of road from Glasgow to Carlisle, to- 
gether with that which leaves it about the middle of the parish to- 
wards Langholm. The bridges and fences are excellent, and ge- 
nerally in good repair. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church is placed in a low se- 
questered glen, surrounded on almost all sides by high rising grounds 
and woody banks, and also by large ash trees within the enclosure 
of the church-yard. It is situated about a quarter of a mile from 
the manse, nearly in the centre of the parish in respect of locahty, 
but not of the population. But though it might be more centrical 
to the population, it is not distant more than three and a half miles 
from the remotest of the inhabitants. It is so very old that no 
person can tell when it was built. It is long and narrow, being 
nearly 53 feet long by 18 wide; the wall at the door is 8 feet high, 
and the interior one foot lower than the surface. Altogether, it is 
damp, dirty, and disagreeable both in summer and winter,— by far 
the worst place of worship in the south of Scotland. The serkinp 
and the small wood in the roof and ceihng are entirely rotten. Yet 
the present incumbent has never insisted upon any partial repan-s, 
aware that any such put upon such a building would only incur ex- 
pense, and give little satisfaction. Though closely seated, it affords 
a confined accommodation to no more than 200 sitters, and is there- 
fore quite insufficient for the population of the parish. Many of 
the smaller proprietors have not room enough for their own fami- 
lies much less for their servants and cottars; and Lord Hopetoun, 
the' patron, and a considerable proprietor, has only accommodation 



WAMPHRAY. 



147 



for nine sitters. In fact, all who see our church express their sur- 
prise that heritors so wealthy, and in general so spirited, should 
allow such an insufficient and disagreeable building to stand. 

The manse is good and tolerably substantial. It was built m 
1798, and underwent considerable repairs in 1825, when the pre- 
sent incumbent succeeded to the living. On the whole, it is a 
commodious and comfortable house. The glebe is small, consist- 
ing of high ground now well sheltered by good thorn-hedges. It 
is'supposed to be about eight or nine Scotch acres, or about eleven 
imperial ones, though its boundaries have never been clearly ascer- 
tained. It appears that about eight or ten years after the Revo- 
lution there was no glebe ; or air least what had formerly been 
glebe was occupied by the principal proprietor, and the then in- 
cumbent threatened to employ, if he did not actually employ, le-, 
gal means to have a portion allotted to him. Though there are 
church lands in the parish, yet there evidently appears to have been 
no designation of a grass glebe ; and though it has been greatly 
improved of late, it is still far below the average value and extent 
of the other glebes in the Presbytery. Its yearly value may be 
about L. 12 Sterling. 

The stipend, as augmented in 1830, is fifteen chalders, half oat- 
meal and half barlpy, — or, converted into the fiar, L.253, 13s. 4d., 
exclusive of L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. 

There is a meeting-house in the parish belonging to the Relief 
denomination, and built about fifty years ago. The congregation 
are supplied at present by a worthy person as their pastor, who has 
a few hearers in this parish, as well as from the surrounding ones. 
As these are not very numerous nor wealthy, L. 80 is supposed to 
be the nominal stipend, but the real amount is much less. It arises 
from seat rents, collections, &amp;c. The dissenting minister has also 
a good garden, and a piece of land as grass for a cow. 

Eighty-six families out of a hundred attend the Established church ; 
at which there are about 170 communicants; five families are partly 
Burghers ; nine families belong to the Relief persuasion. 

Education. — There is in the parish only one school, at which 
are taught, besides the ordinary branches, Latin, Greek, and French. 
The schoolmaster's salary is the maximum, with legal accommoda- 
tions. The late schoolmaster, after a long and efficient service, 
retired about eight years ago, and now retains L.20 of the salary. 
The remaining L. 14, as well as the house and garden, are given 
to the present schoolmaster, who has also the school fees, which 



148 



DUMFRIES-SHlllE. 



may amomit at an average to L.25 more. It is attended by all the 
young persons in the parish, except a very few in the extremities, 
who are nearer schools in other parishes, also two or three families 
of shepherds, whose children, especially in winter, are either taught 
at home by their parents, or have a young lad engaged among 
them, who goes to each family a short time in rotation, and takes 
his pupils along with him. They all appear very much alive to the 
benefits of education. There are none, old or young, but can read, 
and few that cannot write. 

Literature. There are no parochial or other circulating libra- 
ries. But one has lately been originated in the neighbouring parish 
of Johnstone, from which a few get books; and there is another at 
Moffat, to which a number in this parish subscribe. It has been 
long estabhshed, and contains many valuable books. Neither are 
there any scientific or literary societies, unless what is called a de- 
bating society, if it may be so denominated, which meets occasion- 
ally, and is composed chiefly of tradesmen and labourers in this and 
the surrounding parishes. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— T\ie average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is 12, and there are some others who re- 
ceive occasional assistance. The greater proportion of the poor 
on the session roll are partially supplied by their relations. They 
all have free houses, which are kept in repair for them. Potatoes, 
and a portion of peat-moss for fuel, are allotted to each of them, 
and about one-half of their number have also money allowed for 
digging their peats. In summers not well fitted for drying them, 
coals or money are given them. In general they receive only 
about 6s. or 8s. per quarter of money, with some farther allowances 
occasionally in the interval. On the whole, though much money 
may not be distributed among them, yet, with equivalents, they 
are in general kept tolerably comfortable, and none of them have 
occasion to beg. There are some besides who have free houses 
given them, chiefly by Dr Rogerson. The church collections for 
the poor average somewhat less than L. 12 per annum ; and the 
donations from non-resident heritors average L. 10 per annum ; 
together with the interest of L. 25, lodged in the Bank of Scot- 
land at Dumfries. Without mentioning the large ash timber m 
the church-yard which is cut down at intervals, a few trees of which 
last Year produced about L. 10, or the money arismg from fines, 
proclamations, use of mortcloth, more than which latter sums are 
required to pay the different church officers, there are generally 



WAMPHRAV, •''y 



■bout L 10 distributed among them and the poorer householders 
in winter arisino- from a cliaritable ball, or some amusement eon- 
:::t a,iy. There is i„ general, and «ith on y a ew ex- 
ceptions, a disposition among the poor to refranr i'omgv- 
rochial relief, .vhich they consider as degradmg. Assessments 
t n l iAerto evaded, from a fear that they might eventually 
n rease h number of the poor. On this head, we must not.e 
the interference madewith the interests of the "f - POor by gteat 
swarms of beggars, not merely the aged and mfirr,, but the yom,g 
and robust, who flock from other quarters f-quently frorn Ireland 
and intmdate this district. It may safely be asserted that they 
extort far more from the inhabitants in the course of the yea., 
than our own poor derive from all the sources formerly enume- 

Inns.— There is only one alehouse in the parish. It is kept 
where the turnpike toll is levied; and from not being very much 
frequented, appears to have no very bad effects upon the morals 

of the people. i • 4.1 • 

iweZ.— Almost the only fuel used here is peat, got partly m this 
■ parish, and partly in Johnstone, where there is an almost inter- 
minable supply.- Most of the peats in this parish are found in a 
moss towards the south. As it hes with little descent, it is much 
overrun with water, and is coming fast to a termination, recourse 
must now be had entirely to other parishes, or coals must be 
brought from a great distance. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The present state of the parish presents a very striking contrast 
in every respect to that which existed at the time of the first Sta- 
tistical Account, which appears to have been written in 1793 or 
1794; and also to the state of things when the last Account was writ- 
ten in 1798. Prices, indeed, appear to have been as remunerating 
to the farmer then as they are now. But all the lands have changed 
their owners, except in three cases, where the proprietors succeeded 
by inheritance. The general appearance, too, presents a very differ- 
ent aspect. The houses, which were then rather indifferent, are now 
very neat and comfortable. The farms are now divided and subdivid- 
ed, and well fenced. A new and far better system of husbandry is 
now followed. The farmers have more capital, and carry on their 
operations with more energy and spirit. A purer breed of Galloway 
cows and cattle has been introduced. Sheep with a finer fleece 



150 



DUMFRIES-SIIIllE. 



cover our hills, and, to improve the carcase, some of the store- 
farmers who have low lands and sown grass, encourage a mixed 
breed from a Cheviot ewe with a Leicestershire ram. Even in 
1798, there were only two thrashing-machines in the parish; now 
every farmer has one. Lands on the side of the hills which have 
not been ploughed for nearly a century, and others which have no 
vestige of having ever been ploughed, have been broken up and 
sown down with artificial grasses. The rental which in 1798 was 
only L. 1900, is now nearly L. 4000 per annum. A more liberal 
education may now be received at our public school ; and hence a 
number of young men have of late years gone to prosecute their 
studies at the universities, with a view to the learned professions. 
With these advantages we may be supposed to enjoy much hap- 
piness in our sequestered retreat, far from the bustle and confu- 
sion of towns or crowded thoroughfares ; and certainly we do, or 
at least should do so, if we were duly aware of the blessings we 
enjoy, and did properly appreciate and improve them. Among 
the disadvantages to which this parish is liable, some complain 
of the distance from markets for the disposal of our produce, espe- 
cially of heavy articles ; but this is partly remedied in one import- 
ant respect, and that is, in regard to bacon, the staple commodi- 
ty of this district. Mr Hamilton, a respectable and extensive 
farmer in this parish, and possessed of capital, who last year sup- 
ported a company in the parish of Johnstone for curing bacon, has 
this year found it convenient to salt a large proportion at his own 
house ; which is also a great convenience, especially to the poor, 
who have no horses to carry it to a distance. He has already 
laid out L. 1000 in purchasing 300 carcases, weighing in whole 
4000 imperial stones. We may also mention, that though we have 
several plantations and clumps of trees, yet there is still a great 
deficiency on the higher ridges, where they would improve the 
climate, and prove a shelter as well as a great ornament to the dis- 
trict.

PRESBYTERY OF LOCHMABEN, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. ROBERT COLVIN, D. D. MINISTER. 

L_T0P0GRAPHY AND NATURAL HiSTORY. 

Name, Boundaries, c.-In the most ancient records extant the 
name of this parish is Johnston, which, - Sa-H' signifies h ton 
or dellinJace of John, and seems to mdicate that from the resi- 
dence in thatquarter of some iUusirious person of that namem Scoto- 
Saxon times, of whom, however, no tradition exists, the surround- 
ing territory was designated. At a later period it is generally written 
and more recently Johnstone. From time immemorial, 
it has been the undisputed property and prmcipal residence of the 
chief of the family of Johnstone. In addition to what was anciently 
so called, Johnstone comprehends a considerable portion of the 
old parishes of Garvald and Dumgree, and is now six miles m 
length, and averages three in breadth, containing twenty square 
miles, or nearly 13,000 imperial acres. It is nearly triangular m 
its figure, and bounded on the north by the parish of Kirkpatrick- 
Juxta, and on the east by Applegarth and Wamphray, from both 
of which it is separated by the river Annan. On the west it is 
bounded by the river Kinnel, which, with a small exception, di- 
vides it from Kirkmichael, and on the south, at a narrow pomt for 
about a mile, by the parish of Lochmaben. The confluence of 
the Annan and Kinnel being about two miles below the southern 
extremity, the parish is in the form of a ridge between those rivers, 
the lower part of which is about 150 feet above the level of the 
sea, the height of the ridge rising gradually to 700 or 800 feet. 
Between these rivers the whole parish is situated, with the excep- 
tion of 2000 or 3000 acres on the west of the Kinnel, which 

 " In Bagimont's RoU, the rectory of Johnstone, in the deanery of Annandale, 
was taxed L °2, 13s. 4d. The advowson belonged, both before and after the Refor- 
mation, to the family of Johnstone, the Lords of the Manor, in whom the right of 
patronage is still vested. "-Vide Chalni. Calcd. Vol. iii. p. 179.

ascend towards Nithsdale-to the height of 1200 or 1500 feet. 
The ascent of the Annan, for the six miles for which it forms the 
eastern boundary, gradually increases from about 100 feet, till it 
reaches 250 feet above the sea level, at the march of Kirkpatrick- 
Juxta. The Kinnel is much more rapid in its course than the 
Annan, particularly after it is joined by its tributary stream Duif 
Kinnel, a little above Raehills. 

Meteorology. — The average temperature of the year, judging 
from observations made in the adjoining parish, may be about 47° 
of Fahrenheit. The climate on the south-east side, inclining to- 
wards the Annan, is somewhat similar to that of the other valleys 
in the south-west of Scotland, situated from 200 to 400 feet above 
sea level. On the north and south-west, in the valley of Kinnel, 
from the vicinity of extensive tracts of wet elevated country, it is 
decidedly more moist and cold at the same elevation. The pre- 
vaihng winds come from the south and south-west, and bring with 
them the heaviest falls of rain. The severest snow storms we ex- 
perience, blow from the north-east; but, owing to the southern ex- 
posure of the parish, and consequent southern direction of its 
streams and streamlets, snow does not lie so long upon the ground 
here as in the adjacent country. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The lower or southmost point of the 
parish, for upwards of a mile, lies upon a bottom of regular red 
sandstone rock. The remainder of it is generally of whinstone, 
of different degrees of fineness. Pieces of pure lead ore, from the 
size of an egg to that of a man's two hands, have been found at 
various times for above fifty years past, in ploughing particular 
fields of several of the farms near Lochwood, in this parish ; and 
detached pieces are occasionally turned up by the plough even at 
this day. The proprietor, Mr Hope Johnstone, naturally con- 
ceiving that these might lead to the discovery of a continuous vein 
below, employed, some years ago, at considerable expense, an 
operative miner from Leadhills, who, with the assistance of some 
day-labourers, drove a level from Cogrieburn southward, in the di- 
rection most likely to catch the vein, if it existed. For some time 
the miner was extremely sanguine of success, and boasted of hav- 
ing come at last to a duskish marly clay, which he described to 
those who visited his subterraneous operations as a never-faihng 
concomitant of lead ore. But unaccountably, and all at once, the 
miner's hopes vanished, and the search on the part of the proprie- 
tor was in the meantime entirely relinquished. In the absence of

...» of lead below, the existence of disseminated lumps in that 
district, and nowhere else in the parish or neighbom-hood, is not 
easily accounted for. They may have been brought from Lead- 
hills to Lochwood, when inhabited, to be smelted for domestic 
purposes, with the wood which must then have abounded, and been 
carried out to the fields, where they are now found among manure or 
rubbish ; or they may be the scattered remnants of a depot which 
at one time was established at Lochwood or its vicinity, for the 
purpose of sending it to be smelted on the English border, where 
coals abounded. 

Along the side of the Annan, there is a considerable extent ot flat 
alluvial land, chiefly dry loam or gravel. In the interior_ parts of 
the parish there is a number of peat-mosses, extending in all to 
some hundred acres, under which large trees of birch, and parti- 
cularly oak, are every where to be found, evidently indicating that 
they had grown from the original soil before the moss began to be 
formed upon them. The moss is probably the remains of the 
SylvcB Caledonice, mentioned by Tacitus, and the hewing down of 
which, in many parts of the island, our Roman invaders experien- 
ced to be such a Herculean task. The collection of vegetable 
matter, made up of the coarser aquatic plants in a state of partial 
and progressive decay, doubtless goes to the more immediate for- 
mation of this substance. These plants being not easily soluble, 
are found to accumulate faster or slower, according to the humi- 
dity of the soil, and temperature of the atmosphere. That cold 
is necessary for the formation of moss is evident from this circum- 
stance, that the moss uniformly becomes thinner as the climate be- 
comes warmer, and that it is not found to exist in the warmer la- 
titudes at all. It is also obvious, that, in proportion as the decom- 
position of the moss advances, its inflammability, one of its most 
important and valuable quahties, is increased. Hence, in digging 
peat for fuel, the upper turf, or brown spongy flow recently formed, 
and not having undergone the requisite chemical change, is laid 
aside; and if the moss has been kept in the same state of humidity 
during the progress of its growth, the undermost stratum is found 
always to produce the solid black peat, which when ignited emits 
most heat. Much correct information remains yet to be obtained 
respecting the essential elements of which this valuable substance 
is composed, — the various chemical changes which, in its progress 
to putrefaction, it undergoes, — and the causes which operate most 
powerfully either in promoting the growth of those numerous tribes

of aquatic plants, so indispensable to its formation, or in forward- 
ing or retarding their decomposition. With the exception of the 
alluvial deposits and moss, the soil is chiefly either of a light loam, 
on a gravel or rock bottom, or a moorish soil, having a substratum 
immediately under it, of a very retentive clay or till. 

Zoology. — There is no doubt that red-deer, and also roe or fo- 
rest-deer, formerly abounded in this parish, as well as in the other 
portions of the district of Annandale ; the names of various farms 
and lands, such as Raehills, Raeknows, &amp;c. having a particular re- 
ference to that circumstance. In the year 1780, about a dozen of 
fallow-deer were, by the then proprietor, the late James third Earl 
of Hopetoun, brought from Hopetoun House in a carriage con- 
structed for that purpose. They were kept for a short time, in an 
enclosure opposite Raehills, and regularly tended ; but their in- 
stinctive love of liberty led them to break loose, and having got at 
large among the extensive plantations, they could never again be 
collected and confined. The Earl then gave orders to his game- 
keeper to employ a few expert marksmen, and endeavour to extir- 
pate them. Permission, indeed, was given at that time to every 
one who chose to destroy them ; and it is reported that not less 
than fifty were killed in one week. This permission, however, as 
might have been expected, was in some instances abused, and con- 
sequently soon recalled. Having long roamed undisturbed among 
the woods, they have now become exceedingly wild, and though 
the proprietor occasionally kills them, they have increased to the 
number, it is supposed, of upwards of 200. A few roe-deer have, 
within these last three years, been discovered ; and from the cu-- 
cumstance, that before that period, within the memory of our oldest 
inhabitants, none had been seen, it is inferred, that they are not 
the descendants of the ancient aborigines of the district, conceived 
to be long since extinct, but that they have wandered from the up- 
per ward of Lanarkshire, where they are pretty numerous, and found 
a shelter in our woods, among their kindred tribe of fallow.— Goa«, 
which were numerous in the vicinity of Raehills about half a cen- 
tury ago, and kept, as our old inhabitants inform us, avowedly for 
the destruction of adders, at which, it is said, they have a great 
antipathy, have long been extirpated, in consequence of the havoc 
which they committed, by barking and topping the young trees m the 
plantations.— The:c, too, is not a stranger among us, but is often 
seen wending his way « at peep of dawn" lo Mollin Cleugh or 
Kinnel Linns, after his midnight work of spoliation, among the 
lambs or poultry.

In the rivers Annan and Kinnel there is abundance of small trout. 
Salmon and salmon-trout were also formerly numerous at all sea- 
sons of the year, and the proprietor derived a small rent from the 
fisheries. For the last twenty years, however, so few have come 
up the rivers at the time when they are at all valuable, in conse- 
quence of the perfection to which the mode of fishmg with stake- 
nets has been brought by the proprietors on the mouth of the river, 
and on the adjoining banks of the Solway Frith, and which detains 
the fish of almost every description both at the ebbings and flowings 
of the tide, that the fishings have become no object, and have not 
therefore been let. They still come up in great numbers from the 
sea in the floods of September and October, for the purpose of 
spawning, and return in the months of March and April to the 
Solway. 

The cockchafer {Melolontha vulgaris, which often does incre- 
dible mischief to the pastures in the south and west of England, 
has been found, though rarely, in this parish, but its larva has not 
been observed. From the variety of soil, and the great extent of 
woods and plantations, a wide field of investigation is presented to 
the Entomologist. A great variety of insects has, indeed, already 
been found- in the vicinity of Raehills, some of which are very rare. 
Of these we may enumerate the following, viz. Leiodes piceus, Stron- 
gylus fervidus, Byrrhus cBueus, Ips quadripustulata, Lesteva 
Leachii, Drepanepteryx phaloenoides, Folia olivacea Chironomus 
elegans, and several other new species which have not been hitherto 
described. 

Botany. — In the woods we find in great abundance, Adoxa mos- 
chatellina, Lysimachia vidgaris. Campanula persicifolia, and more 
rarely Pyrola media. On the heaths and marshy grounds we meet 
with Pinguicula vulgaris, Menyarithes trifoUata, Andromeda poli- 
folia, Narthecium ossifragum, Drosera rotundifolia, and Vaccinium 
oxycoccos. On the sandy grounds, by the sides of the rivers, we 
find Hypericum humifusum, H. perforatum, H. pulchrum. Ononis 
arvensis, 8c. besides many species of that puzzling and imperfectly 
described genus Hieracium.

stone, Esq. M. P., the present representative of that family, there 
is a considerable extent of ground covered with oak and ash tim- 
ber of natural growth. The former, particularly, has the appear- 
ance of great antiquity, and in some instances has attained un- 
usual size. Various trees are, indeed, to be found near the pre- 
sent ruin of Lochwood, containing upwards of L.200 cubic feet of 
timber, and of which one of the largest, is an oak of seventeen feet 
and a-half in circumference. On Mr Johnstone's property in the 
parish, there may be from 1200 to 1500 acres of plantation from 
fifty years old and downwards. Of all the varieties of plants, the 
larch and the spruce but especially the stiver fir  which in certain 
situations grows most rapidly, seem best adapted to our soil and 
climate. The ash and the plane regularly planted round the farm- 
steadings from 100 to 150 years ago, have attained a large size, 
and are still thriving ; and the oak is found to thrive in sheltered 
situations on every description of soil. 

II. — Civil History. 
Eminent Men. — This parish has the honour of being the birth 
place of the late Dr John Rogerson of Wamphray, for many years 
first physician to the late Empress Catherine of Russia; a gentle- 
man distinguished not less by his high attainments in medical 
science, than by the general pohsh of his mind, and the fascinat- 
ing urbanity of his manners. His father, Mr Samuel Rogerson, was 
one of the Marquis of Annandale's tenants in the farm of Lochbrow, 
near the southern extremity of the parish, where the doctor was born. 
He died at Dumcrieff, near Moffat, in the year 1823, and was buried 
in the church-yard of Wamphray. While one-half of Lochbrow was 
farmed by Mr Rogerson, the other was at the same time rented by 
Mr William HaUiday, whose son, Dr Matthew Halliday, then en- 
joyed the appointment of one of her Imperial Majesty's medical 
attendants, which Dr Rogerson afterwards filled, and in which Dr 
Halhday had been preceded by Dr Mounsey, from the parish of 
Tinwald, by Dr Guthrie from Edinburgh, and by Dr Grieve from 
Peebles-shire ; so that we have five eminent Scotch physicians in 
successive or co-etaneous attendance upon royalty in the Russian 
court, of whom two were natives of this parish. Dr Halliday died 
at St Petersburgh about the middle of the eighteenth century. 

In the vault of the family of Annandale attached to the church 
of Johnstone, the remains of several persons of high distinction arc 
deposited. To make room for succeeding generations, the collins

which contahied them were directed to be inhumated, under the 
superintendence of the minister of the parish, in the year 1818, 
who possessed himself at that time of copies of their several in- 

scriptions. . , , • . 

Lancl-oioners.-T\e whole parish, with the exception of two 
farms belonging to the Rev. John Copland and Sir William Jar- 
dine, now belongs to Mr Hope Johnstone of Annandale. The fa- 
mily from which he is descended, have been proprietors ot it and 
other extensive estates in this district of Dumfries-shire as far back 
as tradition goes. They were, as is well known, one of the chiet 
warlike border clans, and in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries 
were distinguished for their constant warfare with the Douglasses, 
their English neighbours, and particularly with the rival Scotch 
family of Maxwell of Nithsdale. Among the ancient records and 
papers of Mr Hope Johnstone, there will no doubt be found much 
to illustrate the history and antiquities of this part of the border, 
"especially during the latter period of the reign of Elizabeth, when 
Sir James Johnstone of that ilk was knighted, and made "warden 
of the west marches,"— an office held more than once by the family, 
under the several successive reigns of the sixteenth century. 

Parochial Becjisters.—o parochial registers, or sessional records 
exist in this parish previous to the year 1735. Since that period 
a book has been kept containing an account of the ordinary collec- 
tions, &amp;c. and of the half yearly distributions to the poor, which is 
balanced and docqueted annually by the session, and to which the 
heritors of the parish have at all times access. Another book is 
kept, in which is recorded the general sessional business, and an- 
other for the registration of those births which are communicated 
to the session-clerk. No record of deaths, or marriages, has ever 
been kept here. 

Antiquities.— There is upon the east side of the small runner which 
separates the farm of Crawknowes from Beastockrigg, a small burrow 
or tumulus, which was never opened in the memory of any person now 
alive, and which is said to be the spot where the Laird of Lochwood 
shot, in a private quarrel, the Laird of Dumgree, and hid his body. 
There is nothing in the shape of a ruin worthy of notice, with the ex- 
ception of the Castle or Tower of Lochwood, in the north end of the 
parish, said to have been built during the fourteenth century, and 
which, from the thickness of its walls, and from its insulated situation,

the Church.

being almost surrounded by impassable bogs and marshes, must have 
been a place of great strength. It was in allusion to this circumstance 
that James VI. is said to have declared, " that the man who built 
Lochwood, though he might have the outward appearance of an 
honest man, must have been a knave at heart." Towards the end 
of the sixteenth century, it was burnt by Robert, natural brother 
to the chieftain, Lord John Maxwell, .who, with savage glee, says 
the historian, exclaimed, while its flames ascended to the skies, 
" I'll give Dame Johnstone light enough to show her to set her 
silken hood." It was again repaired and inhabited until three 
years after the death of the first Marquis William of Annandale, 
which took place there in 1721, when it was finally abandoned by 
the family, and suffered gradually to fall into decay .f 

Modern Buildings. — There is no other mansion-house in the 
parish, excepting Raehills, the seat of J. J. Hope Johnstone, Esq. 
which was built by his grandfather, James Earl of Hopetoun, in 
the year 1786, and is of the castellated or old English baronial 
style of masonry, prevalent in the reign of Queen EUzabeth. A 
large addition fronting the south, and containing several splendid 

" It was in revenge for the destruction of Lochwood's " lofty towers, where 
dwelt the Lords of Annandale," that the Johnstones, aided by the bold Buccleuch, 
the Elliots, the Armstrongs, and the Grahams, these bravest of all the warriors 
of the Scottish border, attacked and cut to pieces a party of the Maxwells 
near Lochmaben, where, among the slain, fell Robert the incendiary himself, 
the natural brother of the chieftain. The surviving few then took refuge in the 
church of Lochmaben, but the church, with all that was in it, was burnt to ashes by 
the Johnstones, and it was this sacrilegious and barbarous act which in its turn occa- 
sioned the memorable battle of Dryfesands, in which the Johnstones finally prevail- 
ed ; and Lord Maxwell, after having performed prodigies of valour, and while " en- 
gaged in single combat with Lord Johnstone, was slain behind his back by the cowardly 
hands of Will of Kirkhill. A tradition entitled to consideration prevails among those 
whose forefathers lived near the very spot where the bloody border battle of Dryfe- 
sands was fought, tht upon that occasion Lord Maxwell was mortally wounded, and 
fell unknown, — that a few hours after the " battle was o'er," the gudewife of the 
Kirkton, a place adjacent to the scene of action, repaired to the spot in quest of her 
husband, or for some other purpose, and having accidentally discovered his Lordsliip 
lying in a state of exhaustion, but still able to tell his name, that this heroine des- 
patched him with the huge key of the tower wMch she carried in her hand. 

-f- About seven years ago a considerable number of silver coins of various sizes, 
and one large gold one, a double Jacobus, were discovered by a person sowing 
grass-seeds in the cow-park of Good-hope. They consist chiefly of half-crowns, 
shillings, and sixpences, of the reign of Elizabeth, James, William, and Mary, 
and are now in possession of the proprietor at Raehills. A few other silver coins, 
chiefly half-crowns of James VI., and shniings of Elizabeth, were, much about the 
same period, discovered in an earthen pot by a man who was clearing out the foun- 
dations of an old wall or dike near the farm-house of Kerse of Kinnel.

The increase of the population seems chiefly to have arisen 
from the establishment, about fifty years ago, of new small farms 
on the hitherto uncultivated moorlands of Mr Johnstone's estate ; 
from more recent grants of building leases to respectable trades- 
men and others; and from the general prosperity of its agricul- 
ture.

Character and Habits of the People.— The prevailing popular 
games are curling in the winter, and quoits in summer ; for supe- 
rior skill in both of which manly and exhilarating exercises, this 
parish has for some years past been confessedly distinguished. 

The people are cleanly in their habits, and seem never to forget 
that a black and white home-made plaid be it in the month of June 
or January, and the weather what it may, is essential to complete 
their dress when they go abroad, to church or market. Oatmeal 
made into porridge or cakes, and potatoes used with milk, and occa- 
sionally a little mutton, or beef, or bacon, is the ordinary food of the 
peasantry, who are industrious in their callings, and in their circum- 
stances contented and happy. Though not much engrossed in hte- 
rary or intellectual pursuits, our inhabitants are yet an intelligent, mo- 
ral, and church-going population. Poaching of salmon in the river 
Annan, though not so common as it was thirty or forty years ago, 
is sometimes practised during the winter season, but chiefly by 
persons not resident in the parish ; and we fear that until the pro- 
prietors on the river in the upper district of Annandale, have a per- 
sonal interest in protecting the fisheries, by being allowed a chance 
of a share of the fish at the proper season, which at present is

denied them by the land-owners on the river's mouth, all the 
united vigilance of all the water bailies whom they or their tacks- 
men may appoint, will never be able to check this demoralizing 
practice.

Number of imperial acres in crops, or occasionally cultivated, between 5000 and 6000

Extent of land under plantation and natural wood, nearly - _ 1500 

In the plantations made by the late James Earl of Hopetoun 
forty years ago, Scotch firs were chiefly used, with a small portion 
of larch and spruce. It is found, that, on moderately good soils, 
the comparative value of the larch to the Scotch fir is as three or 
four to one ; and when the soil is mossy, and the bottom not very 
retentive, that the spruce is double the value of the Scotch fir. 
It is now quite understood, also, that very great injury is commit- 
ted, and actual loss sustained, by not thinning the plantations in 
due time, and by neglecting to drain them properly. In the lat- 
ter plantations less Scotch fir is used, and more attention paid to 
draining and thinning. From the older plantations, by means of 
two saw-mills, kept in almost constant operation, the neighbouring 
parishes and districts are supplied with wood for farm-buildings, 
palings, and other agricultural purposes, and quantities of the 
large larch have for these three years past, been sent to Lanca- 
shire and Cheshire for erecting railways. On the whole, these 
plantations, although they might have been perhaps more judi- 
ciously managed, may be reckoned a most profitable application 
of capital, whether we consider the great saving they occasion to 
the proprietor in the erecting of farm-steadings, &amp;c. or the direct 
proceeds of their annual sales, or the vast advantages which they 
aff"ord by way of shelter, to the neighbouring lands. 

Bent of Land. — The average rent of the arable land in the pa- 
rish may be from 10s. to 12s. per imperial acre. There are not 
above 2000 acres of land fit for regular rotation for green crop.

many obligations for his able assistance in framing this Report, but particularly for 
his extensive information and very accurate calculations on this head. 



JOHNSTONE.

There are only two regular sheep-farms, and of these the rent 
may be about 5s. per sheep. Black-cattle being kept on the mix-' 
ed arable farms, it is difficult to state the proportion of rent paid 
for them ; but for the last two years the annual return, to the farm- 
ers, taking the average of young and old, does not exceed L. 2, 10s. 
each. 

Rate of Wages.— general rate of a day-labourer's wages, 
without victuals, is Is. 6d. in summer, and Is. 4d. in winter; and 
of that of a mason or carpenter, from Is. lOd. to 2s. 6d. Full- 
grown farm-servants, besides board, receive from L. 4 to L. 6 ; 
and women from L. 2 to L. 3 per half-year. 

Breeds of Live Stock.— On the two sheep-farms, the stock con- 
sists partly of Cheviot, and partly of short, or black-faced sheep ; and 
on all the other farms, cows of the Galloway breed are kept, and their 
produce usually sold at one and two years old, excepting one farm, 
where a dairy stock of the pure Ayrshire breed is kept. The great- 
est attention has been bestowed for these last fifty years by the pro- 
prietor and his tenants in improving the breed of black-cattle. Bulls 
have been brought from the best districts of Galloway, and occasion- 
ally young queys of remarkable symmetry and beauty have been in- 
troduced, and it is generally allowed, and, in fact proved, from the 
numerous premiums annually awarded to our tenantry from the 
district or upper Annandale Agricultural Society, that this parish 
now produces the purest breed of Galloway cattle that is to be 
found in Dumfries-shire. It may be remarked, however, that the 
dairy farm above alluded to, on which thirty cows are kept, is 
considered to pay the tenant better than any of those on which the 
Galloway stock is reared, and the usual mode of management in 
the south practised. 

Husbandry. — The reclaiming of waste land has been here car- 
ried farther than it ought to have been with profit, either to the 
landlord or tenant, it being found very difficult and expensive to 
keep up the fertility of the poorer soils. Much, however, remains 
to be done in the way of draining and top-dressing. The rotation 
of crops is very regularly observed. The land being allowed to 
remain four years in grass, two white crops are taken, succeeded 
by a green crop sown out with grass seeds. Experience has 
taught us that this system of management is the most proper for 
the medium soils of the parish ; but in the extremes of good and 
bad land, this course ought in some cases to be deviated from.

century ago, is altogether banished from the parish, and barley sub- 
stituted in its room. Wheat is regularly cultivated in three or 
four farms only. 

Nearly the whole parish is under leases of twenty-one years, 
which commenced in 1814, and great prices being then calculated 
upon for agricultural produce of every description, the farms were 
anxiously taken at too high a rent, to afford an adequate remune- 
ration to the tenants. Mr Hope Johnstone was early aware of 
this circumstance, and has kindly made, during almost the whole 
currency of the leases, abatements of rent from 25 to 40 per cent, 
and thus at once given a powerful stimulus to the industry of his 
numerous tenantry, and afforded an instance of liberality equalled 
by few, and surpassed, we believe, by none of the landlords in the 
south of Scotland. Very few tenants have consequently quitted 
their farms during this period ; and it is a remarkable fact in our 
parocliial statistics, that two-thirds of the whole present tacksmen 
and their forefathers have been in the parish for fifty years and 
upwards. 

During the last fifteen years, the parish has been almost wholly 
inclosed and subdivided with fences of hedge and ditch, and on 
most of the farms, neat, commodious, and substantial steadings of 
stone and lime, with slate-roofs, have been built ; and it is sup- 
posed that the proprietor has laid out from three to four years' 
rent on these improvements. 

Mr Johnstone has been at unusual pains to stimulate the spirit 
of enterprise among the tenantry on this part of his estates,, and 
the increase of produce and general improvement have been re- 
markably rapid within these last twenty years. The inferiority of 
the soil of a portion of the farms, and the recurrence of defective 
crops in bad seasons, make, however, the progress of these im- 
provements less steady than it would otherwise be in a kindlier 
climate, and more propitious soil. 

Quarry. — There is only one freestone quarry in the parish, on 
a small scale, for the supply of stones for farm-buildings. 

Produce. — Average gross amount of raw produce yearly raised 
in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows : 

Produce of grain of all kinds cultivated for the food of man or domestic animals, in- 
cluding fodder, and deducting seed, . - - L. 4G00 0 0

ty, and by far the most important article of saleable farm produce 
in the parish. But, as the food of these pigs is included under the 
general heads of potatoes and grain, from the sum specified, we 
have deducted the value of those articles which they consume in 
feeding. 

The annual produce of gardens and orchards is extremely trifling, 
and the common vegetables in them are included in the head of 
green crop above stated. 

Manufactures. — There are a few of the various ordinary handi- 
craftsmen, such as 1 baker ; 7 blacksmiths ; 2 plasterers ; 1 slater ; 
37 masons; 17 carpenters; 2 sawyers; 3 carters; 2 grooms; 
1 cooper ; 1 corn-dealer ; 1 hosier ; 1 cow-keeper ; 1 miller ; 6 
shoemakers ; 3 shop-keepers ; 4 tailors ; 9 weavers ; in all 99. 

• Bacon is manufactured here to a very considerable extent. 
At St Ann's Bridge not less than 516 carcases of pigs, weigh- 
ing 6000 stones, and averaging nearly twelve stones each, of 
fourteen pounds to the stone, have been this season manufac- 
tured into hams and flitches by Mr James Thorburn and Co. 
which has proved to be a very \ profitable investment of ca- 
pital. When sufficiently dried and fit for use, it is usually car- 
ried to Longtown, where it commands a ready-money sale for 
the markets of Newcastle, Shields, and Sunderland, from whence 
part of it is shipped to London. It is said, indeed, that in the 
town of Newcastle alone, forty cart loads per week are, through 
the year, at an average, disposed of. The fluctuation in the price 
of this article is often rapid and unaccountable, even to the dealers 
themselves, and seems not to be so immediately affected by the 
rise or fall of other fat produce, as by the prosperous or declin- 
ing state of the manufactures, especially in the south. At Pan-

lands, too, carcases to the amount of 250, and weighing 2870 
stones, were cured by Messrs Halliday last season, and the same 
manufacture has been carried on by them sometimes to a less ex- 
tent, and sometimes to a greater, for upwards of thirty years past. 

The breed of pigs has of late been so much improved in Annan- 
dale, and the mode of feeding and curing them so thoroughly un- 
derstood and practised, that its hams vie in flavour with the York- 
shire or Westphalia themselves, and far excel those lank ill-fed 
Irish which are imported in such abundance into the west of the 
island. 

Societies. — The only public- association is a small farming society 
established in the year 1818, and to which the principal proprietor 
makes a handsome annual contribution, for giving premiums for 
improving the breed of Galloway cattle, draught horses, and pigs, 
and for other agricultural objects. To the spirit of emulation and 
of enterprise which this little society has evidently excited, is owing 
in a great measure that decided improvement both in the quality 
of the stock of various kinds annually exhibited, and in the general 
mode of parochial management. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Markets, c. — The nearest market-towns are Lockerbyand Mof- 
fat, the former being situated at six miles distance from the south- 
ern, and the latter about the same distance from the northern ex- 
tremity of the parish. 

Means of Communication. — The nearest post towns are Moffat 
for the upper district of the parish, and Lochmaben and JLockerby 
for the lower. The great road from London to Glasgow, by Car- 
lisle, runs for five miles through the parish, — that from Dumfries 
to Edinburgh, via Moffat, runs five miles; and a turnpike road 
from Moffat to Lochmaben and Annan also runs about six miles 
from north to south nearly through its centre. The London and 
Glasgow, and Edinburgh and Dumfries mail-coaches, and an Edin- 
burgh and Dumfries stage-coach, travel on these roads. The Lon- 
don and Glasgow road is one of the finest and best kept in the 
kingdom, and has vastly improved our internal communication. 
The first bridge over the Kinnel at St Anns, near Raehills, was 
built in the year 1782, rebuilt in 1795, and considerably widened 

• Both above and below St Anns, there are several verj' faTiciful wooden bridges 
connecting the various beautiful walks which wind on eacli side, along tlie roinanlic 
banks of the Kinnel.

and improved in 1817. That over the Annan at Johnstone Mdls, 
consisting- of one arch, m span above 80 feet, was bud m the year 
1818. Both of these bridges, with the others over the smaller 
streams, are kept in excellent repmr. . , , , 

Ecclesiastical State.-The church is situated on the west side ot 
the river Annan, and upon the eastmost verge o the parish, and 
is, like many other of our parish churches in Scotland, by no means 
centrical, or convenient for the greater part of the population. Its 
distance from the western extremity is seven miles, from the north- 
ern, four, and from the southern, two miles and a-half. It was built 
in the year 1733, and rebuilt and considerably enlarged in 1818, 
and is now very comfortable and commodious. The only bene ac- 
tion on record is that of L.172 bequeathed by John Aitken, late 
farmer in Kirkbank, for behoof of the parochial schoolmaster, and 
placed, in terms of his will, under the uncontrolled management ot 
the kirk-session. The money is, by a personal bond dated at Edin- 
burgh 13th March 1822, in the hands of the trustees upon the es- 
tate of Annandale, who have hitherto allowed for it five per cent, 
per annum. The church accommodates 500 persons, and there 
are at least fifty free sittings. The manse was built in the year 
1735, rebuilt about 1795, and enlarged and repaired at the expense 
of L.650 in 1809, when the present incumbent was inducted into 
the living. The extent of glebe land may be about ten imperial 
acres, including garden and house steading, and may be valued at 
20s. per acre. The amount of the stipend is L.165, 13s. ld. 
per annum. 

The number of families attending the Established church may 
be 191, and of persons of all ages at an average, 400. The number 
of persons attending the neighbouring dissenting meeting-houses 
may be 27. The average number of young communicants yearly 
at the parish church, from a private register kept by the minister 
for nearly twenty years past, has been 25, and of ordinary commu- 
nicants of all ages, of whom a few are from other congregations, 
400. 

An annual collection for religious purposes has been made for 
some years past upon the thanksgiving Sabbath, or that which im- 
mediately succeeds the dispensation of the Sacrament of the Lord's 
Supper, and has been usually divided between the Bible Society of 
Edinburgh and the Scottish Missionary Society. A moiety of it 
was this year transmitted to the North American Colonial Society 
of Glasgow. The probable avernge amount of church collections 



166 



DUMFRIES-SHIllE. 



yearly for charitable purposes, may be exclusive of our collections 
and funds for the regular poor from L. 6 to L. 8. 

Education, — There are three public schools in the parish, one 
the parochial school situated near the church, — another at Edge- 
moor, on the west side of the parish, and another on the northmost 
verge of the parish, at Cogrieburn bridge. In the parochial school, 
besides the usual branches, Latin, Greek, and French are taught : 
in the other two, reading, writing, and accounts only. The salary 
of the parochial teacher was the maximum under the old act, but 
he being for some years in a state of insanity, and enjoying the 
whole salary, with the addition of L. 3 out of the Aitken mortifica- 
tion, in lieu of a house, in virtue of an agreement between his le- 
gal guardians and the heritors, and sanctioned by the presbytery 
of Lochmaben, it has hitherto been considered inexpedient to make 
any further arrangement. An interim teacher, appointed by the 
heritors, conducts, in his absence, the business of the school, and 
is remunerated by the fees and Candlemas offerings, with L. 5, 
12s. from the Aitken fund, which may, in all, amount to about 
L.27 per annum. The teacher at Edgemoor has a salary of L.14 
a-year from Mr Hope Johnstone, which, with the school fees, may 
make his income about L. 24 yearly. The teacher at Cogrieburn 
bridge receives no salary, but is dependent upon the fees of teach- 
ing and the Candlemas offerings alone. His income may be esti- 
mated at from L. 14 to 16 a-year. The parochial teacher posses- 
ses the legal accommodations in houses and land. The general 
expense of education per annum, for children under twelve years 
of age, may be 10s., for those above that age, 12s., and for those 
who are taught Latin, Greek, &amp;c. 20s. There are no persons in 
the parish above six years of age who cannot bothjead and write. 
Since the facilities of education have been increased, an evident 
improvement has taken place in the morals and general good con- 
duct of the parishioners, as is testified by our sessional records of 
discipline, &amp;c. 

Literature. — A parochial library, consisting chiefly of books of 
divinity, biography, history, &amp;c. and from which all novels are 

 We have also two Sabbath evening-schools. The one at St Ann's Bridge, and 
the other at the church, which meet during the summer months, and are open indis- 
criminately, and gratuitously, to children of all classes, who choose to attend. Tlie 
average number of scholars at both has for some years past been ]2o, and there is 
reason to believe that these little religious seminaries have been eminently blessed 
to promote the spiritual interest of llic rising generation amongst us.

Inns, Sc.-Theve are neither inns, nor alehouses kept here, noi 
do they seem to be required as a public accommodation. The 
proprietor, Mr Hope Johnstone, following out the views of his 
Ldecessors, has carefully prevented the estabhshment of dram, 
shops on his estates generally, and particularly in the parish of 
Johnstone; and there is no doubt that, should this practice, so pa- 
triotic and enlightened, be generally adopted by mfluent.al persons 
throughout our land, much injury to the health and morals of the 
community would be prevented. 

Fuel— The greater proportion of this article is dug from the 
extensive peat-mosses in the parish ; the average labour and 
carriage of which may amount to about 30s. per annum or each 
householder. Coals ate but little used, in consequence, chiefly ol 
their great distance. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
There are, we believe, few, if any instances of a parish uncon- 
nected with manufactures, and whose inhabitants depend exclu- 
sively for support upon the cultivation of the soil, increasing so 
rapidly in population as this has done within these last forty years. 
During this period the external aspect of the parish has been en- 
tirely changed, by its roads, its enclosures, and its improved sys- 
tem of husbandry, but more especially by the number of comfort- 
able dwellings erected for the accommodation of the labouring- 
classes. These houses have been built partly at their own expense.

DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



With the assistance of timber, &amp;c. from the proprietor, and are ge- 
nerally slated or flagged.  Labourers of industrious habits having 
possessed themselves of these tenements, with an adjacent piece of 
ground for keeping a cow, and growing potatoes for their families, 
at a moderate rent, are enabled to live in a degree of comfort and 
independence very superior, indeed, to what is enjoyed by the same 
rank who reside in villages, or who rent houses from year to year un- 
der the tenantry. And it is to be regretted that this system, so condu- 
cive to the happiness and morals of our peasantry, has not, at least on 
estates similarly situated, been more extensively adopted. Nor 
has the want of employment, the frequent concomitant of increase 
of population, been hitherto materially felt among us. Great cau- 
tion, we allow, is at all times requisite so to limit the number of 
these possessions, as not to increase that population beyond the na- 
tural demand for labour, otherwise the evil which has been inflict- 
ed on our sister island, might soon pervade every parish of our land. 
Resident and enlightened proprietors, however, who have attended 
to this branch of poHtical economy, will soon discover to what ex- 
tent this practice may be carried in their respective districts, with 
advantage both to themselves and to the community. While the 
population has increased so extensively, it is an extraordinary fact 
in our parish statistics, that its pauperism has been diminished. 
For, forty years ago, with a population of 565, the regular paupers 
upon the roll were 18,f whereas, in the year 1831, when the popu- 
lation has risen to 1234, the number upon our hst at the half yearly 
distribution in November last, amounted only to 16. 

The nature of the soil and climate, and our distance from mar- 
kets and manure, have rendered it necessary for the proprietor to 
lay out the farms into moderate sizes. There is none, however, 
so small as not to afford ample employment for a couple of horses. 

Experiments are in progress by the proprietor, for ascertaining 
whether spade culture cannot be profitably introduced on particu- 

 Building leases are granted for 21 years at a nominal rent, the proprietor re- 
serving power to resume upon a year's notice, on payment of a part of the sum ex- 
pended in building, in proportion to the period of lease at the time of resumption 
unexpired. Thus, supposing a house to cost originally L. 63, it could be resumed at 
the end of the first year on payment of L. 60, at the end of the second on payment of 
L. 57, and so on. And at the expiration of the lease the house becomes the property 
of the landlord. This arrangement has been adopted, first, to save original outlay on 
the part of the proprietor, and secondly, to operate as a check which the system of 
feuing would not do, to the introduction of disreputable persons into the paiish ; and 
hiis been found satisfactory to both parties,

PRESBYTERY OF LOCHMABEN, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. WILLIAM DUNBAR, MINISTER. 



1. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name and Boundaries. — Applegarth is a compound of the 
words Ai2Jle and Garth, the last of which denotes, both in the 
Celtic and Gothic languages, an inclosure. In the Yorkshire dia- 
lect, as Mr Chalmers remarks in his Caledonia, Applegarth is the 
common appellation for an orchard. To the parish of Applegarth 
was annexed in 1609, that of Sibbaldbie or Sibbaldbye, which is 
supposed by Chalmers to have obtained its name during Saxon 
times, from its having been the Bye, or dwelling-place of some 
person called Sibbald. To Applegarth was attached also the 
chapelry of Dinwiddle, which, it is said, belonged of old to the 
Knights Templars, who had large possessions in Annandale. 

The parish extends 5 1 miles in a northerly direction, and its 
breadth eastward is of the same extent. The parish contains in 
whole 17 g square miles. It is of a triangular figure, and is bound- 
ed on the N. by Wamphray ; N. E. and E. by Hutton ; W. by 
Johnstone and Lochmaben ; and S. by Dryfesdale, and that part 
of Lochmaben parish which lies on the east side of the river 
Annan. 

Topographical Appearances. — The high grounds in the parish, — 
for they cannot be called mountains, and scarcely hills, — lie on either 
side of the river Dryfe ; the western range commencing nearly at 
the southernmost boundary, and extending in a northern direction 
till it joins the Wamphray range ; the eastern range is a continua- 
tion of that called Quhytwoollen in Dryfesdale, running north- 
wards, and joining the hilly ground of Hutton. The highest part 
of the former range is Dinwiddie hill, by barometrical measure- 
ment 736 feet above the level of the sea. Of the latter range, 
Adder-law is the highest ground, measuring 638 feet.

Climate, c.—\i may be remarked, that the temperature must be 
considerably influenced'by the nakedness of the country, which from 
the N. W. round to N. E. is generally destitute of growing wood ; a 
deficiency, however, which is now in' the way of being supplied. In 
the meantime, the cold winds from these quarters receive no check,

and consequently, the temperature no increase from well-grown 
woods. The southern part of the parish, provincially called " the 
How of Applegarth," is on a low level, compared with the northern 
and eastern divisions, and interspersed with meadow grounds; yet the 
greater part of the adjoining lands being drj, and of a gravelly or 
sandy loam, this southern division is regarded as equally healthful 
with those of a superior elevation. There are no distempers pe- 
culiar to the parish, which maybe justly regarded as very healthy. 

Hydrography. — The river Annan separates the parish from 
Lochmaben and Johnstone on the west ; and the water of Dryfe, 
in part of its course, from Dryfesdale, on the east. The Annan 
rises about 4 or 5 miles above Moffat, in that mountainous range 
which separates Dumfries-shire from Lanarkshire and Peebles- 
shire, and from the opposite side of whidh issue also the more 
famed waters of the Tweed and Clyde. The stream of the Annan 
runs a southerly course at a medium breadth of 90 or 100 feet, 
through 30 miles of fertile country, and falls into the Solway Firth 
about a mile below the town of Annan. The Dryfe rises in the 
northern extremity of the parish of Hutton, and runs in a south- 
erly and south-westerly direction, in a stream nowhere more than 
30 feet in breadth, and generally very shallow, till it joins the 
Annan 1 mile below Applegarth church, at the distance of 15 
miles from its source. 

Geology and Botany. — The parish is intersected by the two 
hilly ranges already noticed, running nearly parallel, north and 
south ; and between them flows the Dryfe, which, running within 
the boundaries of the parish, is of more importance than the An- 
nan, when taken in connection with its geology. The Annan, though 
larger, and the origin of some fine tracts of alluvial land in the lower 
part of the district, is here but a bordering river, the banks of 
which present no very marked features. Looking at the Dryfe, 
therefore, as the division between the two great ridges, we find the 
declivities of these ridges furrowed into deep channels, b-y which 
several streams descend rapidly to the river i and the correspond- 
ing slopes on the opposite or outer sides of the ridges are also in- 
tersected by other streams, which make their way, those on the 
west side, to the Annan, the others to the Corrie Water, the east- 

 The whole of the facts stated under the heads " Geology, Botany, and Zoology," 
were kindly communicated to the writer of this account, by Sir William Jardine, 
Bart, of Applegarth. They are given at so great length as being common in a great 
measure to the surrounding district.

above-mentioned, the banks rise often to the height of 20 oi 30 
feet and are composed of gravel and broken red -dstone in 
.h h are imbedded blocks of the latter of considerable size, and 
etny split into thin sections or.. Many of these banks are 
p'nted'with larch, spruce, Scots fir, silver fir, oak, ash, elm, 
£ and beech. Of the firs, the first three, after growmg thriv- 
ingly for twelve or fourteen years, make httle more progress, and 
n fact soon begin to decay; particularly the larch, which, though 
nlv from twenty to twenty-five years old, is almost dea  the wood 
ha;ing become of a cork-like consistence. The contact o the 
roots with the sandstone gravel appears to produce this effect in a 
shorter or longer period, according to its depth from the surface. 
The silver fir, oak, plane and beech, of the same age, thrive vi- 
gorously, the ash and elm, not so luxuriantly, unless their roots 
have reached the alluvial deposit. The alder may be considered 
almost a natural tree along these banks. 

The banks above described extend to a greater or lesser distance 
from the river, according to circumstances ; but the ground between 
them is always alluvial, interspersed with strata of river gravel, 
plainly indicating the various courses of the stream at former pe- 
riods. At the upper part of the parish these alluvial tracts are 
of considerable extent; and below the Milnhouse bridge, they form 
an extensive flat of rich soil, lying between the junction of the An - 
nan and Dryfe. They are partly cropped, and partly in pasture 

and meadow. n • i 

From the banks of the Annan, and the boundaries ol the alkivial 
lands, the country north-eastward rises with gentle undulations, un- 
til it reaches the highest part of the great western ridge. A con- 
siderable part of the land on this dechvity is sharp and good ; in 
many places, however, changing into a wet and tilly substratum, 
and on the higher portions of the ridge inclining to a black moory

earth. It is interspersed with nodules, — sometimes approaching to 
the size of boulders, — of white and greenish whin ; and, at a greater 
depth, with blocks of red sandstone. The sandstone appears again 
regularly in the beds of two streams which descend in a southerly 
direction from the ridge, and is there lost in the eastward division of 
the parish. The summits of the ridge consist of a kind of grey wacke 
slate and greenstone, traversed by narrow veins of quartz, and as- 
suming on the eastern side a slaty structure. The intervening hol- 
lows in this acclivity are either low swampy meadows or peat mos- 
ses. The plants in this tract are varied, and in the lower hol- 
lows will be found all the more common moss and meadow plants. 

From the summit of this range to the Dryfe, the descent is sud- 
den and steep, and the land better wooded. The banks of the 
river are fringed with ash, elm, and oak, of which last a consider- 
able part is coppice about ten or twelve years old, and planted 
up with larch and Scots fir. The plants most worthy of notice in 
this descent occur in the ravines upon its sides, which are clothed 
with jiatural brushwood, and in the oak coppice. 

The Dryfe, nearly from its source, runs through a country com- 
posed of greenstone and greywacke-slate in different modifications, 
assuming in some places a softer texture, and the spotted appear- 
ance more peculiarly belonging to the Water-of-Ayr stone, for 
which it is sometimes used as a substitute. The rock then leaves the 
bed of the river, and may be traced along a small stream the Mil- 
ton Burn, north-westward to Ravencleugh, where it is frequently 
found veined with quartz, and becomes of a reddish colour, as if 
tinged with iron. In the opposite and eastern side of the river, it 
appears in two other small streams, Hook and Rockhillflat burns, 
and in the rounded hills which form the second or eastern ridge, 
rising between the Dryfe and the Corrie, presenting no marked 
features, and assuming nearly the same modifications of colour and 
texture. 

This eastern ridge rises from the Dryfe with nearly equal steep- 
ness with the western ridge, and reaches nearly an equal height, 
The ground towards the Corrie Water consists almost entirely of 
undulating round-backed hills of moor and sheep pasture, partially 
cultivated, and composed geologically, as stated in the preceding- 
paragraph ; and as it approaches the river, it widens into a narrow 
plain of alluvial soil, and of rich productive meadows. . This ridge 
is nearly without wood, except on the descent towards the Dryfe, 
where, as at Balgray and Hook, there are woods of considerable

from the circumstance of its having, it is said, been used as a pil- 
lory in the days of yore. The iron staples which held the collar 
or gorget were visible not many years ago. 

Zoology— The wild animals of the class Mammalia m Ap- 
plegarth; and which are common to the country in general, are 
about twenty. Among these, there are one or two that may be con- 
sidered as rarer species. In addition to Vespertilio emarginatus, 
the great bat F. altivolans of White's Selbourne, has been een 
flying about the river with a rapid and powerful flight, and niust 
rank as a very rare animal. PZecows awHws is not uncommon. The 
water-shrew {Sorex fodiens which is often accounted rare from its 
retired habits and difficulty of capture, may always be found along 
the soft and sandy banks of the Annan. The ottei' is to be seen 
occasionally, and the fallow-deer sometimes stray from the woods 
of Raehills. The only animal certainly existing in this parish in 
former times, and which has now disappeared, is the badger. Thirty 
or forty years ago this animal was well known here; it was very fond 
of garden vegetables, particularly carrots; and the last of the race 
were killed in the old gardens of Jardine-Hall. To the badger 
may perhaps be added the roebuck, the remains of which have 
been found in some of the mosses. 

Fishes.— An enumeration of the different species of fishes fre-

quenting the river Annan will include nearly all those found in this 
parish. The tributary streams contain only trout, pike, minnow, 
and eels, and a small proportion during autumn and winter of les- 
ser migratory salmon.— The sea-lamprey {Petromyzon marinus, 
milg. Ramper-eel, ascends the river in the end of June and begin- 
nmg of July to spawn, and continues for a month and sometimes 
longer.— The small river-lamprey vulg. Nine-eye, is found early in 
spring on the edges of sandy banks, and most frequently at the 
mouth of some small rivulet or ditch. This species is marked doubt- 
fully, as one or two of the lesser lampreys are yet confounded. 

Two species of eels inhabit the river and ditches, and are gene- 
rally confounded as one. ,They are at once distinguished by the 
form of the head and snout, which in the one is broad and flatten- 
ed, and in the other narrow and sharp-pointed. Neither have yet 
been characterized properly. 

The Pike is tolerably abundant, and is supphed from the lochs of 
Lochmaben, which have communication with the Annan. They 
are seldom taken in the river of more than ten pounds weight, but 
become fine and in good condition after a short residence. 

The Roach is found in small numbers in the still parts and back- 
water of the river, but always of small size. They also are derived 
from the Lochmaben lochs. 

The Chub or skelly is very abundant, swimming in large shoals in 
the swashes or stiller parts of the river. They grow to a consider- 
able size, and spawn gregariously on the shallows in June and July. 

The Common minnow, three-spined stickle-back, and loach, are 
all abundant. 

Sahnonidhe. — This important family were formerly, it is well 
known, much more plentiful in the Annan than at present. About 
fifty years ago the fisheries in the parish were let, and the salmon were 
so abundant as to aff'ord considerable emolument to the tacksman, 
and sport to the angler. At present, no part of the river within the 
parish would pay the expense of nets. Even at the mouth, where 
it enters the Solway, the extensive fisheries long established there 
have fallen two-thirds in value. One cause of this diminution is 
to be found in the stake-nets erected at the river's mouth, which, 
by intercepting a great part of the fish, have almost annihilated 
the fishing in the upper parts of the river, and consequently de- 
stroyed the interest which the upper proprietors would otherwise 
have in preserving them from poachers during the breeding season. 
Another cause is the improper period fixed for clone-time, whicli

commences too early, and opens again before the spawned fish, or 
at least the greater part of them, have reached the sea. The va- 
rieties in the Annan belonging to this family are common salmon m 
Its various states; the Sea Trout—Two fish are confounded under 
this, name, Salmo Mitta and Salmo eriox, or gray Both are easily 
distinguished from the gilse or young salmon by the size and length 
of the head, and the form of the tail. They commence running 
from June to the middle of July, according to the season, and ge- 
nerally spawn in the lesser streams. 

The Herling {Salmo albus ascends the river during July and 
Auo-ust, though in wet seasons a few are got at the mouth in June, 
andcontinues to run till September. They spawn early, chiefly in 
the smaller streams, and the kelted or spawned fish return to the 
sea before March, though they are sometimes met with so late as the 
middle of April. Experienced anglers are of opinion that in the 
early run of this fish many young salmon mix, and are killed indis- 
criminately with them in the Solway nets. It might be of advan- 
tage, therefore, that the herling-nets or houses of small mesh should 
not be permitted before the beginning of July, at which period all 
the o-ilses would have attained a size which would render a mistake 
nearly impossible. The herling weighs generally from 8 oz. to 1 lb. 

The Parr. — This species, though often maintained to be the fry 
of salmon, is very distinct, and possesses characters much more de- 
cided than many of the others. It seldom exceeds six inches in 
length, and is oftener from three to five. It is gregarious. Some 
of them remain in the river during the whole year ; but the adult 
fish seem to remove to or near the salt water to spawn, thus per- 
forming a migration at variance with that of their congeners. At 
the end of February and in March, the males may be found on 
the confines of tide-way full of milt, and shedding it on the least 
handling. They are found in most Scottish rivers that have easy 
access to the sea ; a circumstance which seems essential to their 
health, and may perhaps account for their not being known above 
the Falls of Clyde, or any of its upper tributaries. The parr has 
not yet been accurately described by naturalists ; and though it is 
almost every where abundant, its history is but imperfectly known. 

The Common Trout is abundant in all its river varieties. When 
in season it is a remarkably fine fish, sometimes weighing as much 
as 5 or 6 lbs., ordinary weight from 1 to 1 lb. It spawns late. 
The only fish which now seems extinct in the parish is the perch.

It was foi-merly found in Perch-lmll Loch ; and the last got there 
was in 1814, when the loch was partially drained. 

Reptiles. — The reptiles found in the parish are, 1. Lacerta agilis, 
common about Dinwiddie Hill and eastern moors. 2. Vipera com- 
munis, adder, occasionally seen on the eastern side of the Annan, 
occurring in dark and light-coloured varieties.  3. Triton aquati- 
ons, water-eft, common in ditches. 4. Triton vulgaris, common eft, 
occasionally found in stone dikes. 5. Rana temporaria, common 
frog. And 6. Bufo vulgaris, common toad. 

Birds. — Besides the more common species, there are to be 
found in the parish the following 

Land Birds. — Peregrine falcon {Falco peregrinus, an occa- 
sional visitant, passing to and from its eyries in the higher and 
wilder parts of the county. 

Merlin jP. cesalon most frequently seen in winter. 

Moor-buzzard {Circus ceruginosus; one or two of these birds 
have occasionally frequented the Perch-Hall loch in the parish. 
They are rare in this county, and appear about the larger swamps 
and mosses at uncertain intervals. 

Hen-harrier, or ringtail, {C. cyanus, after the season of incu- 
bation leaves the hills, and, with its brood, visits the low country 
daily, roosting among whins and long heather. 

The four common owls are met with. The rarest is the short- 
eared  Otus brachyotos ; it continues during the whole year, and 
breeds in the high grounds on the eastern border of the parish. 

The water-ousel {Cinclus aquaticus is abundant on all the 
mountain streams, and migrates during winter in considerable num- 
bers to the banks of the Annan. 

Among the true thrushes, the missel thrush  Turdus viscivo- 
rous deserves notice, on account of its increase during the last 
few years. Fifteen years ago, they were rarely to be seen; but 
in consequence of the increased extent of plantations, they are 
now frequently met with in pairs, or in parties of five or six. A 

 Note hy Sir William Jardine — Anguis fiagilia I have never found in the pa- 
rish, though there are several stations where it probably may be met with. It has 
been got in Raehills woods, and is particularly abundant in the woods of Craigieburn. 
TIio Nairix Dumfrisien.iis of Fleming, I have never been able to trace in this coun- 
ty, or indeed elsewhere. Rana esmlcnta I think I have seen, but cannot at present 
speak with certainty, it is not uncommon in Scotland. Bufo riihcta or natter-jack 
is abundant at Southcrness, in Galloway. I am not aware of another Scotch li.ibitat 
of this species.

.....ilar increase has been observed in several other parts of the 
south of Scotland, and north of England. 

All the stone-chats [Saxicolce are to be found. The most un- 
common is S. ruhicola, of which a few pairs may be met with 
about waste brushwood, or whin-covers, during the whole year. 
The red-start {Phcenicura ruticilla, is an occasional summer vi- 
sitant, preferring those parts of the country which abound most m 

copsewood. P J rrii, A 

Of the warblers, the three willow-wrens are found. The wood- 
wren {Silvia sihilatrix is chiefly confined to the woods on Dryle. 
Lesser pettychaps [S. hippolais very rare. Greater pettychaps 
{S. hortensis abundant, and, though seldom observed, is often 
betrayed by its melody. The black-cap {S. atricapilla is oc- 
casionally seen ; and the sedge-warbler [Salicaria phragmites in 
marshes where there is a little cover. The golden-crested-wren 
{Regulm cristatus breeds here in small numbers; but during 
winter, when the migratory flocks have arrived, is very abundant. 

Of the Titmice, five species are abundant ; but the marsh- 
tit {Parus palustris, and cole-tit P. ater, and long-tailed-tit 
P. caudatus, are found chiefly in winter. A few pairs of the 
latter breed about Jardine-Hall ; but the greater part seek the 
more extensive woods about Raehills, and return during winter to 
the lower lands. 

The gray wagtail {Motacilla hoarula is found here for a few weeks 
in spring and autumn, when passing to and from their breeding-places 
among the hills. The yellow wagtail M.Jlava very common on 
the banks of the Annan, and is particularly noticed here as being 
a bird extremely local in its distribution. 

The common meadow and tree pipits are abundant. 

The common bunting {Embcriza miliaria is migratory, and is met 
with in autumn in small flocks, and breeds in the lower pasture-lands. 
It also is a bird of local distribution. The snow-bunting {Plectro- 
phanes nivalis appears in the higher grounds in immense flocks 
during winter, and in severe weather visits the edges of the Annan, 
feeding among the sand or gravel. 

The mountain finch [Fringilla montifringilla is a winter visitant 
in large flocks, delighting to feed on beech-mast. 

The siskin {Carchielis spinus appears at uncertain intervals in 
very large flocks. 

The common linnet {Linaria vulgaris abundant. Of the lesser 
red-pole {L. cannahina a few pairs breed, but large flocks arrive 



180 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



in spring- and autumn, and smaller parties sometimes remain dui-- 
ing winter. The mountain linnet {L. montium is seen but seldom. 
The northern linnet {L. horealis has been seen only once or twice. 
It is not commonly known in Scotland. 

Common starling {Sturnus vulr/aris is found in flocks during 
autumn and spring, but few in number, having diminished much 
of late years. In 1819 and 1820, flocks of many hundreds fre- 
quented the holms on the Annan, but of late not more than from 
.ten to twenty have been seen together. 

The raven {Corvus corax passes over occasionally, betrayed by 
his croak. The hooded-crow  C. comix is a rare visitant, and gene- 
rally found with the common corbie. The jack-daw C. monedu- 
la is sometimes seen varied with white. The jay {Garrulus glan- 
darius is very rare. 

Swallows abound. But the numbers of the window-martin {Hi- 
rundo urbica,x\&amp; swift {Cypselusmurarius, have diminished much 
since the old mansion-house of Jardine-Hall was pulled down ; 
previous to which numerous colonies of swifts built in the rents of 
the walls, and two or three pairs of martins tenanted every win- 
dow. Now 1832 a few pairs only of each are to be found; a 
striking instance of the change of locality, which is constantly tak- 
ing place. The martins are strictly gregarious, living in large co- 
lonies, like rooks and herons. 

The spotted fly-catcher {Muscicapa grisola common. 

The common night-jar {Caprimulgus Europmis is frequently 
seen, and is abundant in the opposite parishes of Lochmaben and 
Johnstone. 

The land-rail, corn-crake, {Crex vulgaris, very abundant. 
The king-fisher {Alcedo ispida occasionally seen on the Annan 
during winter. 

The common creeper {Certhia familiaris abundant in winter. 
In the breeding season it retires to the more extensive woods. 

The turtle-dove {Columha turtur was once shot in Jardine-Hall 
garden. 

The pheasant {Phasianus torquatus was introduced here about 
ten years ago, and is now tolerably abundant. 

The black-cock {Tetrao tetrix, and grouse {Lag opus Scoticus, 
abound in the higher parts of the parish ; the former has, within 
these few years, extended to the lower district. 

The quail {Coturnix vulgaris is occasionally met with in Sep-

teiuber and October at the tinfve of migration. In 1819 they 
bred here, and produced large bevies. . 

IVater Bird.-The common heron {Ardea frequents the ri- 
ver from the heronry at Halleaths, a mile or two distant. 

The bittern Botaurus stellaris once frequented this parish, but 
has not been observed of late years. It is still found, however, in 
Lochmaben and Johnstone. 

The water-rail {Rallus aquaticus is met with in ditches and 
about Perch-hall Loch. The spotted gallinule, or water-crake, 
ICrex vorzana, is found around the same loch. The common 
coot {Fidica chloropus breeds there also, but leaves it on the ap- 

proach of winter. j x • 

The common curlew {Numenius arquata is very abundant in 
the upland pastures, where it breeds, retiring on the approach of 
winter. - 

The green sandpiper {Totanus ochropus occasionally seen on 
its migratory passage. Common sandpiper T. hypoleucos, dur- 
ing summer abundant both in Annan and Dryfe. Greenshank 
{T. glottis is seen sometimes on the Annan. Common woodcock 
{Scolopax rusticola, and snipe {S. gallinago, and jack-snipe {S. 
gaUimda, all common,— the latter migratory. 

The lapwing {Vanellus cristatus abundant. Golden plover 
{Charadrius jjluvialis breeds in the foarish, and is found in large 
flocks during winter. The common dotterel C. morinellus was 
met with last spring in a flock of about twenty birds. A few pairs 
of the ring dotterel C. hiaticida breed annually on the Annan. 

Common cormorant {Phalacrocomx carho has been seen strag- 
ghng up the Annan as far as Jardine-Hall. 

Golden-eyed duck {Clangula vulgaris ascends the river during 
winter in small flocks, most of them in the plumage of the first 
year ; they swim up the shallow streams, and destroy considerable 
quantities of spawn. The scaup {Fuligula marila ; the tufted 
duck {F. cristata ; pochard {F.ferina ; pintail {Anas acuta; and 
wigeon {Mareca penelope, are all found here. The first four are 
met with but seldom ; the last more abundant. 

The common wild-duck {A. boschas, and teal {A. crecca, are 
abundant, but diminishing in numbers yearly. 

The wild swan {Cygnus ferus is sometimes seen in severe win- 
ters. Tlie bean goose {Anser ferus in flocks frequent the flat 
moors and holms in the same season. The white-fronted goose 
{A, erythropus is sometimes seen in small flocks. The goosander

{Mergus merganser male and female, ascend the Annan during 
winter in small flocks, in which, like the golden-eyes, those of im- 
mature plumage, and females are most abundant. 

The little grebe {Podiceps minor is common in the river dur- 
ing winter in pairs, or in small parties of five or six. The dusky 
grebe [P. cornutus has been met with once or twice. 

The red-throated diver {Colymhus septentrionalis has been once 
met with in immature plumage, or as the speckled diver of Bewick. 

The lesser black-backed gull {Larus marinus is to be seen on 
the river during spring and summer almost every day. 

The common gull {L. canus in autumn and winter frequent 
the pasture and plowed fields in considerable flocks ; the greater 
part, in the plumage which gives them the name of winter-gull. 

The black-headed gull {L. ridibundus breeds here, and comes 
occasionally during winter, frequenting the river, or following the 
plough. 

The common tern [Sterna hirundo is sometimes seen fishing in 
the Annan in spring and autumn.

Historical Events. — The only historical event worth noticing, 
connected with the parish, is stated in the following extract, from 
Chalmers' Caledonia, who gives as his authority, " the Royal Ward- 
robe Accounts :" " On the 7th of July 1300, Edward I. who was 
then at Applegarth, on his way to the siege of Caerlaverock, made 
an oblation of seven shilhngs at St Nicholas' altar in the parish 
church at Applegarth, and another oblation of a hke sum in the 
same church, at the altar of St Thomas a Becket, Archbishop of 
Canterbury, in honour of this martyr, whose translation was com- 
memorated on this day."

alv rough squared blocks of red sandstone were dug up; and pro- 
bab y it had undergone the operation of trenching at some ormer 
period, in order to'procure building stones A small portion of 
carved stone was found at the same time, and is now m the minis- 
ter's possession, in appearance part of one of those ornamental stone 
croses which in former times, were the usual appendages of Romish 
churches, and many of which are to be seen still standing inron 
of ancient monasteries in the Highlands and Hebrides With n

' eighteen or twenty years ago, about four or five feet under the sur- 
face, the remains of a large chest, or rather its iron work, the wood 
having long since decayed, consisting of corner-bands, hinges, por- 
tions of the lock, &amp;c. all of the Jleur-de-lys pattern, besides a piece 
of ornamental work of iron, the purpose of which it is not easy to 
discover. It has been conjectured, in the absence of every thing 
like evidence, that this chest may have formed part of the equipage 
belonging to Edward,— as it is stated in the Caledonia, that the 
king waited some days at Applegarth the arrival of his baggage. 
These articles are now in the possession of Sir William Jardine 
—A venerable thorn called " the Albie Thorn," stands in a field 
within 500 yards of the church, which it is said was planted on the 
spot where Bell of Albie fell, while in pursuit of the Maxwells 
after the battle of Dryfe sands.— A similar memorial marks the 
spot, about half a-mile distant in Dryfesdale parish, where it is 
said Lord Maxwell himself, at that time warden of the Western 
Marches, was killed.— Part of the ruins still remain of the parish 
church of Sibbaldbie, now annexed to Applegarth.— Roman sta- 
tions are visible in several places. On Dinwiddie hill and on

Cleiigh-Heads hill, which is now planted, there are two of these 
stations still very distinct, and on White- Castle knowe, in the same 
range, there is one which has more the appearance of a beacon 
hill of British, than of Roman origin. A Roman road also tra- 
verses the parish in a northerly direction ; it may be traced in some 
places for several hundred yards above the level of the adjoining 
ground. It appears to have led from a strong station, in the farm 
of Dryfeholm, in the neighbouring parish of Dryfesdale, in the 
direction towards Moffat. — Ten or twelve years ago, a gold coin of 
James VI. was found in the farm of Belcot Hill ; and a few months 
ago a French gold coin was dug up in the garden at Dinwiddle 
Mains, of Francis 1. in a good state of preservation ; they are both 
in the hands of Sir William Jardine. 

Modern Buildings. — The only modern buildings worthy of note 
are the mansion house of Jardine- Hall, built in 1814; that of Hook 
built in 1806, a property formerly belonging to Edward Armstrong-, 
Esq. now to John James Hope Johnston, Esq.; the parish church 
erected in 1761, and the manse in 1806. There are three corn-mills 
and one lint-mill. The materials employed in the erectioii of Jar- 
dine- Hall, and the manse and church, are red sandstone, taken from 
a quarry on Corncockle muir in Lochmaben parish. Hook house 
is built of greenstone, from the bed of the river Dryfe, with the ex- . 
eeption of the hewn work, which is of red sandstone. 

HI. — Population. 

From a minute statement in the handwriting of Mr Dugald 
Simpson, minister of Applegarth, in 1696, it appears that the exa- 
minable persons amounted at that period to 610. The whole po- 
pulation would therefore be somewhere about 830. 

In 1755 it amounted to 897 

In 1777 ta - - 943 

But in 1792 it fell to - 741 

In 1801 it rose again to - 795 

♦ In 1811 to . . 841 

In 1821 to . . 943 

and at last census in 1831, the population was 999. The de- 
crease between the years 1777 and 1792 is attributed in the for- 
mer Statistical Account, and perhaps correctly, to the system 
adopted about that period by land-owners, of joining a number of 
small farms into one. The increase since that period may be as- 
cribed, partly to the improved system of husbandry creating a de- 
mand for labourers, and partly to the natural progress of popula-

tion -the births in the parish nearly doubhng the deaths,-a pro- 
gress kept in check, however, in a slight degree by emigration to 
Canada. It may be as well, perhaps to remark here m order to 
account for the small number of deaths compared with ihe births, 
that there are no towns, villages, or manufactories m the parish, 
and that all that portion of the population consisting of farm- 
servants is a shifting population,-most of them being at the health- 
iest period of hfe, and hardly any of them remaining in the pa- 
rish during life,-that is to say, long enough to add to the bills ot 
mortality.

Character, c. of the People.— The habits of the people are 
sober and industrious ; and, in regard to cleanliness, they may 
justly claim their full share in the improvement in this respect, 
acknowledged to have taken place among the Scottish tenantry. 
From the high prices of ag-ricultural produce during the late war, 
and the consequently high rents, the landholders of Applegarth 
and Sibbaldbie considered their tenants as justly entitled to im- 
proved accommodation. The farm-houses, accordingly, are near- 
ly all new, and in general very commodious ; and the occupiers, in 
their improved circumstances, encouraged by the liberality of their 
landlords, and willing to second them in matters so materially con- 
nected with their own comfort, furnished their houses in a style of 
neatness strikingly contrasted with their condition twenty or twenty- 
five years ago. Habits of cleanhness were almost, of course, natu- 
rally formed, and now happily influence both their in-door and 
out-door arrangements, their dress, and in general their whole 
style of living. At the same time, they are altogether free from 
the error of living above their means. Indeed, it has been alleged 
by some of the high-spirited farmers in some neighbouring parishes, 
that they go to the opposite extreme. It would be well, perhaps, 
if we could say of Scotch husbandmen in general, what may be 



186 



DUMFRIES-SIIIKE. 



said with truth of the farmers of Applegarth, that they have not 
discarded the good old habits of simple and economical living. 
The ordinary fare of the tenantry is certainly changed so far, that 
none of them now breakfast but on tea and coffee, or dine without 
animal food on their tables. Yet it is in strict moderation, and 
suitable only to their means ; and their meals, under ordinary 
circumstances, are never followed by wine or ardent spirits. The 
common food of the tradesmen and day-labourers is, of course, a 
degree more economical. In truth, to the man whose davs' waes 
do not exceed 2s. the meal-chest and "the potatoe-bing must al- 
ways be the great resource. Yet many of this class, while deep- 
ly sensible of the value of such a resource, and thankful to Provi- 
dence for its general abundance, are not without additional com- 
forts of a substantial kind. Some of them are able to purchase a 
sheep, or a portion of a fat cow, to be salted for their winter 
store ; and in a parish where almost every cottar keeps a pig, 
and some a milch cow, anything hke severe destitution can hardly 
be supposed to exist. All classes of the people enjoy, there- 
fore, in a reasonable degree, the comforts and advantages of that 
kind of society to which they are inclined. The present depres- 
sed state of agriculture bears hard on the tenants of Applegarth 
as on others. They find, that, to make money by farming, is at 
present out of the question ; and the tenant who can pay his rent 
without encroaching on his capital, if he has any, considers him- 
self fortunate. In these circumstances, they can hardly be expect- 
ed to be contented; but they may be resigned to an evil which it is 
not in their power to remedy. The other classes, — tradesmen and 
labourers, — are too intimately connected with the tenantry, not to 
share with them in their feehngs and deprivations. 

Poaching in game cannot be laid to the charge of the inhabit- 
ants of this parish ; and though the same cannot be said, with re- 
gard to poaching in the salmon fisheries, it is certain that even that 
is on the decline.

there was formerly a considerable extent of old --d, clefly oa 
ash, which was cut down about twenty years ago and the ground 
replanted with larch, and other species of the fir tnbe. On Bal 
gray, the value of the timber annually cut and sold amounts to 
about L 50. The management of the young woods throughout 
t panh is of the most.pproved kind. The J-d, previous o 
its being planted, is thoroughly drained and well-fenced, and thin- 
ning and pruning carefully attended to. As a natural conse- 
quence, the plantations are all in a very thrivmg state. 

Bent of Land, Wages, Prices, c— The average rent of the 
arable land may be from 16s. to 18s. per imperial acre. There 
is in the parish almost every variety of soil, and while some ol it, 
consisting chiefly of alluvial tracts, is let as high as L. 2, there is 
much more at 12s., 10s., and even as low as 7s. and 6s. per acre._ 
The gross rental of the whole parish is L. 6680. As to the ave- 
rage rent of grazing it is difficult to speak with perfect accuracy. 
But, perhaps, for the summer, it may be at the rate of L. 3, or 
L. 3, 10s. for a cow or full-grown ox; from 5s. 6d to 5s. 9d. for 
hill-fed sheep; and from 10s. to 15s. for those grazed on richer 
pasture, during the whole year. 

The average rate of wages of good ploughmen, exclusive ol 
board and lodging, is about L. 12 per annum; of women-servants, 
L. 5 ; of day-labourers, without victuals, Is. 6d. per day during 
summer, and Is. 4d. in winter. In hay and corn harvest, the wages 
rise to 2s., and occasionally a little more. To masons, carpenters, 
and other trades requiring apprenticeship, from 2s. 6d. to 3s. is 
given. The wages of day-labourers generally, in this parish, are 
kept low by the competition they encounter from the inhabitants 
of the neighbouring villages, and especially from Irish labourers 

domiciled there.

Breeds of Live Stock. — Except on one dairy farm, where the 
stock is Ayrshire, the cattle kept here are of the Galloway breed. 
They are well suited for this country, being hardy, good feeders, 
capable of attaining to a large size, and much in request for the 
markets in Norfolk, Suffolk, &amp;c. where they are fattened for Smith- 
field. Much attention has of late years been paid to the improve- 
ment of these animals in this parish as in the rest of the district, 
and we now rival Galloway itself in the purity of our breed and 
the symmetry of our bullocks. This improvement has been effected 
by the introduction of the most approved stock from their indige- 
nous pastures by the allurement of high prices for their bulls and 
cows. Of sheep, the Cheviot breed constitutes the stock on the 
hill pasture in the parish, while on the lower and arable lands there 
are some small stocks of the Leicester breed. But the chief pur- 
pose for which any species of this kind of stock is kept here being 
to eat off the turnip crop, and for which Highland wedders are ge- 
nerally purchased, equal attention in breeding sheep to that be- 
stowed on black cattle is not paid. 

Husband-/. — The course of husbandry pursued is the system in 
more or less perfection, of alternate white and green crops, though 
in many instances with a considerable portion of the farm in pas- 
ture. This is rendered necessary by the pretty extensive rearing 
of cattle. Turnips have been, for the last few years, cultivated 
largely, and consumed on the ground by sheep, — a valuable inno- 
vation on the old system, and one which has increased materially 
the produce of corn crops. If any " specialty" distinguishes the agri- 
culture of the parish,|it is the quantity of pork produced. Through- 
out all Annandale this is an important article of commerce, and by

tatoes,-they are grazed during summer, and fattened on boiled 
potatoesandja be considered as the most prominent defects 
in the husbandry of this parish, as well as of the country m general. 
Sufficientattentionis not, generally speaking, bestowed on the drain- 
ing of the land, nor on cleaning it when under naked fallow or green 
crop, nor on rearing and preserving the fences, of which proprie- 
tors would do well to take the chief charge on themselves-; while, 
at the same time, the course of cropping is rather severe on many 
of the farms. Neither is sufficient care taken to increase the dung- 
hill that " mother of the meal chest." Too many cattle are kept 
during winter, and consequently they are on short allowance. 
Lime, also, is, owing perhaps to the great distance of the hmekilns, 
in general bestowed in too stinted measure; and though the dose 
is more freauently repeated than in districts where the mode of ap- 
phcation is better understood, the effect is by no means so benefa- 
cial as when a sufficient quantity is administered at once. It is not 
doubted, however, that most, if not all of these defects, would soon 
be remedied, if agriculture were once more in a prosperous state. 
Already, in fact, in some of our farms these defects are hardly dis- 
cernible. At an early period, and until the middle of the last century, 
several of the largest farms in the north-eastern quarter of the parish 
were occupied by a number of small tenants, who ploughed exclu- 
sively on the hill grounds, to the extent of some hundreds of acres 
more than is now even occasionally cultivated. A change of sys- 
tem about 1760 and 1770, threw these farms entirely into sheep- 
walks, occupied each by one tenant; and they continued in a state 
of pasturage, becoming gradually coarser and more unproductive, 
till within the last ten or twelve years, when the occupiers have 
found it advantageous to lime and break up extensively, generally 
laying out the land immediately in grass for sheep pasturage. And 
these tracts of land being in most cases possessed by able tenants, 
the cultivation will probably extend to all the dry ground in simi- 
lar circmnstances.

DUMFRIES'SHIRE. 



Emhanking. — In the way of embanking, much permanent bene- 
fit has been secured by the extensive operations of the late Sir 
Alexander Jardine, who protected from the floods in the river An- 
nan a very considerable breadth of the richest lands in the parish, 
thereby fitting them for the growth of wheat, their natural and most 
profitable produce. The embankments are carefully kept up, and 
nothing farther remains to be done in that way. 

The ordinary duration of leases is for fifteen years ; and for nine- 
teen or twenty-one years where the lands let are unproductive, or 
require great outlay by the tenant. 

The general management and productiveness of the land have in- 
creased much of late years. Soon after the commencement of this 
century, farmers, stimulated by high prices, began to give attention 
to the accounts of better and more liberal systems of agriculture, 
which were emanating from more improved districts ; Roxburgh- 
shire and the Lothians particularly. The example was followed, 
and, conjoined with favourable markets, created capital which was 
in many cases freely employed in farther ameliorations. Rents, as 
leases expired, kept pace, or nearly so, with the rise of prices and 
increased produce. But when these flourishing times began to 
change in 1815, and continued to decline in subsequent years, the 
rents did not by any means fall in equal proportion. Since that 
period, many of the seasons have proved unfavourable, as in 1816, 
1823, and 1830. Many of the tenants have been stripped of their 
former gains, and an effectual bar placed in the way of any thing 
like very extensive improvement. 

One great obstacle to improvement on the part of the tenants 
is the diminution of their capital in consequence of the fall of 
prices, unproductive seasons, and disproportioned high rents. These 
over-stretched rents are not attributable to the landlords, who them- 
selves, heavily burdened, naturally take what they can obtain in the 
market from good tenants. The fact seems to be, that there are 
too many engaged in agriculture, or, in other words, the competi- 
tion for farms is so eager, that land has not been allowed to fall to 
its fair value. Profits, therefore, are nothing, and, in too many 
instances, less than nothing; so that tenants find it difficult to car- 
ry into effect plans which appear and would prove beneficial. In 
these circumstances, the aid of the landlord seems indispensable, 
at least where extensive improvements are contemplated. But 
the fluctuating nature of the times during the last fifteen years, 
in respect to agriculture, and the fall of rents, — for fallen they

When he succeeded to this fine property m 1806, the farm-houses 
were comfortless, ill-thatched huts, and the mclosures few and of 
the most useless description. He instantly applied himself to re- 
medy these deficiences, and in a very few years produced in the 
property the most marked and beneficial change. About thirty 
farms, constituting nearly the whole of his estate m this parish re- 
ceived new steadings of the most convenient and substantial kind. 
And though the increase of produce may, in a few instances have 
rendered additional offices necessary, the commodious and liberal 
scale of the farm-buildingsin general, mark him the foremost man ot 
his day and district as an enlightened improver of landed property; 
and his character as the kindest of landlords is stamped on the 
hearts of the Applegarth tenantry by the memory of countless acts

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Markets and Means of Communication. — There Ls no market- 
town or other town in the parish ; but the towns of Lockerbie and 
Lochmaben are in the immediate neighbourhood. The great 
road from Glasgow to London by Carlisle runs through the parish 
to the extent of five miles ; and on this road the Glasgow and 
London mail-coach travels daily. An additional light-mail has 
been recently estabhshed, drawn by two horses, and travelling at the 
rate of eleven miles per hour. There is also almost every year an 
opposition coach on the same hne of road. Two bridges cross the 
Annan; one on the Glasgow hne, at the 63d mile-stone from 
that city and 31st from Carlisle, built in 1818; the other on the 
road leading from Dumfries, across Annandale into Eskdale, re- 
built in 1827, both in excellent condition. There are also two 
good stone bridges, and a wooden one for foot passengers, over the 
Dryfe, in the Sibbaldbie part of the parish. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is situated at the lower ex- 
tremity of the parish, almost within a stone's cast of Lochmaben 
parish on the west, and of Dryfesdale on the south ; — of course 
very inconveniently the greater part of the population ; many 
of the people having to travel four, five, and some even six miles, 
to attend the public duties of the Sabbath. The church was 
built in 1760 ; the seating was renewed in 1808, and a private gal- 
lery built, by Sir Alexander Jardine. The walls were stoothed, or 
done with lath and plaster, in 1822 ; and it is now in a very to- 
lerable state of repair, and can accommodate 380 sitters. There 
are no free sittings. The manse was built in 1805. The glebe 
consists of six and a-half acres of good land, and would let for a 
guinea and a-half per Scots acre. The stipend consists of seventeen 
chalders of victual, half in meal and half in barley, payable accord- 
ing to the fiars of the county. Converted into money, the stipend, 
at an average of the last seven years, is L. 280 per annum. There 
is no place of public worship besides the parish church. There 
are 129 families, comprehending 892 individuals of all ages, be- 
longing to the Established church ; and 23 families, comprehend- 
ing 107 individuals, belonging to the Secession. The average 
number of communicants is above 200.

Education,— There are three schools in the parish; two of 
them parochial, and the third a boarding-school for females. In 
the first school, the branches taught, besides the ordinary ones, 
are Greek, Latin, French, geometry, geography. In the second 
the learned languages are not taught. In the ladies' school, the 
branches taught are English, writing, arithmetic, French, geo- 
graphy, drawing, and needle-work. The parochial teachers have 
salaries, — the one the maximum of L.34, 5s., the other L, 17, 
2s. 6d. The fees of the larger school may amount to nearly 
L.30, of the smaller to L. 15. Both teachers have substantial 
dwelling-houses and gardens. The lowest amount of expense 
of educating a child in these schools, as respects the mere ele- 
ments, is 8s. per annum; and the highest, including all the ad- 
vanced branches, L. 1, 10s. All the children in the parish up- 
wards of six years of age can read, or are attending school for that 
purpose. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
- receiving parochial aid regularly is 10. Among these the sum ex- 
pended is L. 30, 10s., making the average annual allowance to each 
individual L. 3, Is. It may be proper to notice, that three of these 
paupers are in such circumstances of age, disease, and destitution, 
as to require among them L. 15, 9s. thus reducing the average al- 
lowance of the other seven to L. 2, 3s. each. There are also se- 
veral indigent persons who receive occasional aid, to the amount 
of L. 7, 6s. 2 Id. Total sum expended annually, L. 37, 16s. 2d. 
The average annual amount of church collections for the last se- 
ven years, is L. 26, 2s. 4|d. ; of interest of capital, L.3, 12s. Qd. ; 
of donations, L. 9, 7s. ; and from other sources not permanent, 
L. 1, 13s. 10 id. In addition to these funds, there is a sum mor- 
tified to the poor on the estate of Applegarth, by Sir John Jardine 
in 1745, of L. 3, 6s. 8d. per annum. Total funds, L.44, 2s. Sd. 
Generally speaking, there is an unwillingness to seek parochial re- 
lief. But it must be acknowledged that this independent feeling 
is not so strong as it was thirty or forty years ago ; nor is there so 
ready a disposition, as ought to prevail among the substantial classes, 
to prevent their poorer relatives from coming on the poors' roll. 
Fairs, Inns, -c— In 1685, Sir Alexander Jardine, then pro- 

DUMFRIES. N 



194 DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 

prietor of Applegartli, obtained a Parliamentary grant of the right 
to hold four annual fairs and a weekly market at the village of 
Applegavth. These fairs have long since ceased to be held ; but 
what is said to be the site of the market cross is still visible, and 
has witnessed within these thirty years the legal process of poinding 
cattle. There is but one inn, or public-house, in the parish; and 
it is frequented chiefly by travellers on the Glasgow road. The 
reprehensible practice of allowing toll-keepers to take out the 
spirit licence prevailed here for a year or two ; but now malt-li- 
quor only is allowed to be there sold. But even this privilege, af- 
fording as it does an opportunity of dealing clandestinely in ardent 
spirits, ought not, and it is hoped will not, be continued. 

jiiel — The ordinary fuel is peat. Every tenant having a right 
to fuel by his lease, the expense consists solely in working and 
leading it, — perhaps at the rate of 8d. or lOd. per cart-load. 
Coals, of which not a great deal is used, are brought from Annan, 
a distance of eleven miles from the south boundary of the parish. 
To that town they are sea-borne from the coUieries of Cumber- 
land. 

Miscellaneous Observations. . 

The difference between the present state of the parish and that 
which existed at the time of the last Statistical Account, is, as may 
naturally be expected, very great, though, from the want of mi- 
nuteness in that account, it is not easy to point out in many par- 
ticulars the precise degree of improvement. The mode of hving 
is more comfortable ; while the good old habits of domestic eco- 
nomy have not been impaired. The management of the land is 
more judicious, and of course it is greatly more productive. In 
one particular, the improvement is striking ; at that period there 
was little or no wheat raised in the parish, and but a small quan- 
tity of artificial hay. Now the yearly value of the former article 
grown in Applegarth will amount to between L. 5000 and L. 6000, 
and of the latter to L. 1000 at least. The rental at the same pe- 
riod was between L. 2000 and L. 3000 ; it is now nearly L. 7000, 
and was a few years ago L. 8000.

PRESBYTERY OF LOCHMABEN, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. THOMAS LITTLE, A. M. MINISTER. 

L— Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, -c— The name of this parish has been com- 
monly rendered " Castle of the Garden ;" but more probably it 
is nothing more than the British and Irish Ton-der-garth, which 
literally means « the inclosure at the oak-hill." The form of the 
parish is very inconvenient ; its extreme length being about 12 or 
13 miles, and its breadth varying from about 1| to 2 miles. It 
lies on the left bank of Milk- Water, the windings of which form 
two triangles, both obtuse. It is bounded on the west by the 
parishes of St Mungo and Dryfesdale, and the united parishes of 
Hutton and Corrie ; on the north-east by Westerkirk ; and on 
the south by Middlebie and Hoddam. 

Topographical Appearances. — Its surface is undulating, and pre- 
cipitous throughout. There are no hills of any altitude deserving 
particular notice, with the exception of Grange Fell and Grieve, 
which are about 900 feet above the level of the sea. The valleys 
are so deep by attrition and other causes, as to form very strikingly 
marked features in its varied landscape. In its whole length it is beau- 
tifully picturesque along the banks of the Milk, affording many very 
fine subjects for the pencil, especially in the neighbourhood of the 
manse, and some places farther down. The climate partakes gene- 
rally of the character of the district, which is proverbially moist. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — There are no indications of coal in 
this parish, nor is there any trace of sandstone. The formations 
are composed of transition rock, alternating with transition-slate 
and clay-slate, occasionally passing into greenstone ; subordinate 
to all which is greywacke in very thick beds. These are the ge- 
neral characters of the rocks where they appear, from the south- 
west end of the parish for about eight miles. There is no iron- 
stone, or limestone, or basalt. The amygdaloidal range passes to 
the south on the borders of the parish from Torbeckhill by Burns- 
wark, Newfield, &amp;c. overlying coarse-grained sandstone, colours 



195 DUMl'UlES-SHlttK. 

varying from bright-red to gray and streaked, and sometimes pear- 
ly white, as at Burnswark. In this last are nodules of a dark- 
brown colour, from the presence of oxide of iron. This range, 
however, though bordering on Tundergarth, is in the parishes of 
Middlebie and Hoddam. Peat abounds in the upper district of the 
parish ; but in the lower district it has of late years been very scarce. 

The soil is various ; but where cultivated is generally fertile, 
though in some places rather hard, thin, and rocky. There is 
very little holm or table-land. Towards the hills, the soil is cold, 
with a till or gravelly subsoil, and indurated clay. The greater 
part of the lands are much exposed to west-north-west and easter- 
ly winds; and, rising abruptly from the Milk, have very little shelter. 
More than one-half of the surface consists of fertile sheep-walks. 

A trial was made for lead some years ago on the farm of Hazzle- 
berry, and a level was driven some distance into the hill. There 
were indications of the ore in a vein of iron mica ; but the search 
was not successful, and was finally abandoned. A search was also 
made for lead many years ago in Grange Fell, with similar suc- 
cess. Another trial was made in the bottom of a very deep glen 
on the estate of Crawthwaite, the property of George Graham, 
Esq. by a level which remains still open, or was so lately. Anti- 
mony was actually found. Some fine specimens of the ore were 
for many years in the possession of the late Thomas Johnstone, 
Esq. of Grange. It is probable the ore was not found in sufficient 
quantity to warrant the expense of farther search. The strata of 
the whole glen and hills on each side are transition -slate and clay- 
slate, the latter greatly abounding : the debris of it covers the 
slopes of. the mountains. It is to be regretted that so few trials 
have been made in this part of the country, especially for coals, 
which are believed by all to exist in abundance. Were coals found 
in the neighbourhood of the many lime quarries, the price of lime 
would be much reduced. They are at present brought from the 
north of England by sea, and are very dear. The man who dis- 
covers coal in this part of the country will be entitled to be ranked 
among the benefactors of his countrymen. 

II. — Civil History. 
Accounts of the Parish.— There is a document in the possession 
of the family of Grange, containing an account very illustrative of 
border manners, at the period to which it refers. 

• From this document it appears, that at the funeral of Thomas Johnstone of 
PurbHieball, which was some time prior to 1029, a ih took place between the

The chief landed proprietors are Thomas Beattie, Esq. of Grieve,

fZfiial Registers.--The parochial registers have been very 
irregularly kept hitherto ; but measures have now been taken 
to have them regularly kept in future. ■ i r 

AitiqmUes.-h. regard to antiquities, the oldest seemingly of 
which this parish can boast is a Roman road, discovered a few 
years ago on the north side, and passing from the Roman camp 
on Burnswark Hill, in a direction north-west. Traces of it have 
been found from thence to Closeburn ; that being the tract by 
which the Romans under Agricola forced their way into Strath 
Cluid The road was covered with about nine inches of earth. 
It is formed of broad flat stones, well packed together with water- 
sand in the interstices. It is about eight feet wide. 

There are still to be seen in many places small entrenched 
camps or Birrens, as they are called. They are all on elevated 
situations ; generally of a round form, very prominent, and in good 
preservation ; and they consist of a strong vallum and fosse, with- 
out any outworks. The area seldom exceeds an acre, and is olten 
less. It is conjectured that they were constructed durmg the long 
feuds and border wars by the Septs or lairds, to protect them- 
selves and cattle from the Enghsh, and from one another. It is 
probable, however, that some of these may be of an earlier date, 

Johnstones of Tundergarth and those of Lockerbie, in which three of the latter family 
and two of the former were killed. A feud, it is said, existed at the time between the 
two families, and to prevent any quarrelling, the family of Tundergarth were not 
invited to the funeral. However, some of them came to the burying-ground, and a 
quai-rel, as had 1cen dreaded, taking place, the conseriucnccs were as we have stated-

DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



and may be what are called British Fortifications ; many of them 
still retain the name of Castle. In breaking up some of these in 
the lower part of the parish, especially at Castlehill and Cairn- 
hill, opposite the manse, urns have been found containing human 
bones and ashes. Some of these urns were in a good state of 
preservation. 

There appear to be some Druidical remains on the farm of 
Whiteholm, the property of Mr Swan. They consist of seven 
erect stones, forming a semicircle, and are by the common people 
called the Seven Brethren. Among these remains, bones have 
been found ; but whether human or not, has not been ascertained. 
About a mile distant from these remains, on the property be- 
longing to the same gentleman, there existed until lately two cairns 
of pretty large dimensions ; and there was one of similar form and 
size also on the estate of Grange. When the stones were car- 
ried away for building fences and other purposes, there were found 
in the heart of them human skeletons, contained in something re- 
sembling stone coffins. 

In the neighbourhood of that on the property of Mr Swan, there 
are several tumuli resembling graves. 

III. — Population. 

The population, as ascertained by Census of I80I, was 484

2. Number of unmarried men, bachelors or widowers, upwards of 50 years of age, 13 

of unman-ied women, including widows, upwards of 45, - 7 

There were lately 9 persons above eighty years of age, 3 of whom 
were in their eighty-fifth year, and 1, a female, in her eighty-sixth 
year, all in the upper district of the parish. Several individuals 
have been known, within the memory of the present generation, 
to have reached their ninetieth year and upwards. 

The number of proprietors of land of L. 50 a-year in value, 
and upwards, is 19 or 20. The total number of proprietors in 
the parish is, of whom 13 are resident. 

Character of the People. — The people in general are sober and 
industrious ; seem satisfied with their condition and circumstances ; 

 The diflerence betwixt the population as here stated, and the account of it as 
given in when the census was last taken, may be owing to the season of the year when 
the two accounts were taken.

for the season ; with a small exception, at 25s. for cattle fed on 
coarse ground ; at 5s. per ewe, or full-grown sheep pastured for   

the year, - - " 1 

No revenue from woods worth mentioning; no gardens ; no or-

been mentioned. 

L. 7804 1 8 

At an average, 167 sine may be fed annually, which, at L. 3 
each, will amount to L. 501. 

The rental of the parish is about L. 3000. 
Live Stock.— The sheep kept in this district are all Cheviot ; 
and the cattle are generally of the Galloway breed. A good deal 
of attention has been paid to the improvement of sheep for these 
last twenty years, by procuring the best Cheviot rams from the 
east border. It has been found of late to answer a good purpose, 
on some particular farms, to cross a part of the ewes with Leicester 
rams. Tliough their lambs do not answer to be kept here as store- 
sheep, they command very higli prices for the English market. 



. DUMFllIES-SIIIKE. 

Much attention haslso been paid to the breeding of black-cattle, 
by selectnig the best Galloway bulls that can be got in the district. 

Rate of Labour.— n\e rate of labour is for men during summer, 
Is. 8d. per day, and for women, Is.,— sometimes less; and during 
wmter for men, Is., and for women, 6d. Artisans are paid from 
Is. 8d. to 2s. 6d. per day. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Toion, 'c— Lockerby, in the adjoining parish of Dry- 
fesdale, is the nearest market-town, and is distant about a mile and 
a-half from the nearest part of the parish. 

Means of Communication.—The locality of the parish does not 
require many roads. The principal one runs about two-thirds of 
Its whole length. It is generally kept in very good repair, but the 
hne of It IS the worst that could have been chosen. Our fore- 
fathers seem always to have preferred carrying their roads over the 
tops of hills. Such is the road here. But a new one following 
the Ime of the Milk is projected, which, if made, will be the most 
picturesque and beautiful in the country. 

Ecclesiastical State.—Considermg the length of the parish, the 
situation of the church is perhaps as good and convenient as any 
that could be chosen. The church was built upwards of sixty years 
ago, and is at present in a very good state of repair. It was late- 
ly stoothed and seated of new, and is at present one of the neatest 
and most comfortable in the district. It is to be regretted that, 
when the heritors repaired the church, they did not at the, same 
time repair the wall round the burying ground, which is at present 
m a very ruinous state. The church affords accommodation for 
the legal number of sitters and no more. 

The manse was built, it is said, about a hundred years ago. 
Several additions were made to it during the life of the late incum- 
bent; but every thing seems to have been done in a very injudi- 
eious and insufficient manner. It is at present in great need of 
repairs. 

There are about eight acres of glebe land, including the garden 
and the ground on which the manse and offices stand. Of these nearly 
six acres are very good arable land; the remainder consists of pas- 
ture ground, and the precipices on the side of the Milk, which are 
covered with natural wood. The aiverage value of the arable and 
pasture land may be about L. 2 per acre. 

The stipend, according to the decreet of the court, is only 
six chalders of victual, half meal and half barley, and L.70 m.

money vith L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. But as the 
p.pe„a.;eo—  

double bolls of victual, barley, and meal. 

There are very few dissenters of any description in the pa 
rish, and these few do not originally belong to it, but have come 
from other parts of the country. The people in g™e-l see™ at- 
tached to the Establishment. They have perhaps kept as close to 
it since the revolution, and have had as few grounds for being dis- 
satisBed, as any other in the district. The church ,s m genera 
very well attended. The number of communicants may be about 

150 or upwards. , . , • i i 

Education.-Thev is one established school m the parish, where 
the usual branches are taught. The salary is the maximum 
There is also the interest of L. 100 for behoof of the free school 
of the parish. The interest of this sum is usually employed in 
paying for some of the poorer children. The parochial school- 
master is provided with the usual accommodations, as directed by 
law. The school fees are for reading and writing, 2s. ; for arith- 
metic, 3s. 6d. ; and for Latin, 5s ; and the amount actually received 
is about L. 20 per annum. The charges for other branches are 
regulated by those of the adjoining parishes. 

The people can all read and write; they are in general very 
sensible of the benefits of education, and desirous of having their 
children instructed in the ordinary branches. The two extremities 
of the parish lie at rather too great a distance from the school. 
This is an evil that cannot easily be remedied, as the funds of the 
parish and population are not adequate to the support of two re- 
spectable established schools. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The poor are supported by the col- 
lections in the church, which may average about L. 13, the interest 
of L. 100, and a voluntary contribution by the heritors of 10s. 
on every 100 merks valuation. How the L. 100 was acquired is 
not very certain. Whether it has accumulated, or part of it was 
originally mortified, cannot be ascertained. The number of poor 
at present on the roll is 4. They receive 6s. 8d., 3s. 6d., and 
3s. 4d. per month, according to circumstances. Besides these 
there is a fatuous person, for whom the parish pays L. 10 per annum. 
Occasional demands in addition to what is now stated are made 
upon the funds. There does not appear to be any growing dispo- 
sition to apply for parish relief.

DUMFIUES-SIIIRE. 



InnSi 'c. — There is no house Hcensed to retail ale, or any kind 
of ardent spirits in this parish. There was one licensed for this 
purpose some years ago. But so many complaints were made 
against it, that measures were taken by those concerned to prevent 
a renewal of the license. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Since the last Statistical Account was written a great improve- 
ment, though not to the extent that might be wished, has taken place 
in the parish. The mode of husbandry has been altered and im- 
proved much since that time, and many of the farms have been bet- 
ter inclosed and subdivided with hedges and other fences ; and 
where capital has been liberally apphed, some of the farms, con- 
sidering the nature of the soil, are in a high state of cultivation. 

It is to be regretted that this parish is so bare of wood, as it 
would be much benefited by additional shelter. A good deal has 
been done in Several places of late ; but of these we can only par- 
ticularize a few. There are, for example, some fine old trees on 
the estate of Whitstonehill, principally ash, which seems to be 
particularly well suited to the banks of the Milk. Some young 
plantations have lately been put down on the same estate, which 
are thriving well, but their extent is rather limited. Considerable 
plantations have also been made of late on the estate of Pierceby 
Hall, the property of G. Rogerson, Esq. There is also a consi- 
derable quantity of fine old timber and young wood on the estate 
of Gibsontown. The late proprietor, John Johnstone, Esq. ex- 
pended a considerable sum of money, and with great taste and 
judgment, in improving and beautifying his property. It is now 
one of the most pleasant and desirable places of residence in the 
neighbourhood. The improvements, however, on the estate of 
Grange, the property of Wilham Johnstone, Esq. are chiefly re- 
markable. About eighteen years ago, that gentleman planted ex- 
tensively; and the plantations, which consist of timber of all sorts, 
are thriving uncommonly well. If the same spirit and taste had 
been displayed by all the other proprietors as by those above men- 
tioned, Tundergarth, from the nature of its surface and localities, 
would have been one of the most beautiful parishes in the whole 
district.

PRESBYTERY OF LOCHMABEN, SYNOD OV DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. ANDREW JAMESON, M.W.S. MINISTER. 



L_T0P0GRAPHY AND NATURAL HiSTORY. 

Name and Borcndaries.-Tn ancient name of this parish was 
Abermilk; the British designation Aber, signifying the confluence 
of waters, agrees with the situation of the parish, which is a kind 
of peninsula formed by the junction of the rivers Milk and An- 
nan The inquisitio of Earl David found, in the year 1116, that 
the lands of Abermilk belonged of old to the episcopate of Glas- 
gow The Bruces having built a castle on the Water of Milk in 
the twelfth century, the name of the parish was changed to that 
of Castlemilk. The parish under this new name is mentioned in 
the year 1170 by Pope Alexander; and in 1290, William de Gos- 
ford, the parson of Castlemilk, swore fealty at Berwick to Kipg Ed- 
ward I. The church of the parish was dedicated to God under 
the invocation of St Mungo, the canonized founder of the see of 
Glasgow ; and most probably the people gave the name of then- 
favourite patron to the parish, as being more in unison with their 
relioious feelings than a designation which brought to their remem- 
brance only the haughty baron or his feudal requisitions. Smce 
the alteration of the religion of Scotland, the name of St Mungo 
has always designated the parish, except, perhaps, during that pe- 
riod of intolerance when the appellations Saint and Devil were es- 
teemed synonymous terms. 

The parish, situated in the upper ward of the ancient stewartry 
of Annandale, extends from north to south about 4 mile, and 
from east to west about 2 miles, containing 7| square miles; is 
bounded on the south by the parish of Dalton ; on the east by 
Hoddam ; on the north by Tundergarth ; and by Dryfesdale on 

the west. , . 

Topofjraphical Appearances.— The surface of thisparish isuneven, 
being elevated into two hill ridges, and depressed by their accompany- 
ing vales. On the south of the parish, the high wooded grounds of 



204 



DUMFRIES-SIIIRE. 



Kirkwood in Dalton, and Nutholmliill in this parish, form a beau- 
tiful vale a mile lon, through which the river Annan flows in a ser- 
pentine course. In the centre of this enchanting vale, and on the 
bank of the river Annan, the manse and church, embowered in wood, 
are situated. The manse stands 90 feet above the high water- 
mark at Annan by the barometer. Nutholmhill, elevated 200 feet 
above the sea, sinks gradually into a plain eastward at the junction 
of the Annan and Milk, and westward near the village of Lockerby. 
Directly east, and nearly parallel with the ridge of Nutholmhill, 
rise the eminences named Barrhill and Breckenhill. Barrhill 
sinks into the level of the holms of Hoddam on the east ; whilst 
Breckenhill, stretching westerly, sinks into the bed of the Milk 
on the confines of the parish of Tundergarth. This ridge extends 
about two miles, and is in its highest parts elevated 250 feet above 
the sea. Through the highly cultivated and richly wooded valley 
formed by these hills, the Water of Milk takes a serpentine course 
of three miles, on the bank of which is built the modern mansion of 
Castlemilk. In the north of the high land of Breckenhill, after a 
slight depression, the ground suddenly rising up again, forms the 
classical table-shaped hill of Burnswark in the parish of Hoddam. 

Meteorology. — The climate is rather moist, from the parish being 
only six miles from the Solway Firth, and the quantity of high 
ground contained in and surrounding the parish. The most pre- 
valent winds are from the south-west. Although the climate is mild 
from the sudden alternations of temperature to which the parish is 
exposed, inflammatory complaints are not uncommon ; the very 
flimsy manufacture, which has supplanted the coarse fabric of our 
forefathers, gives rise to many glandular diseases, consumptions, 
and complaints of the liver and stomach. The great improvement 
which has taken place within these thirty years in the construction 
of houses, their comparative cleanliness and capability of ventila- 
tion, have greatly tended to diminish disease among the aged ; 
whilst vaccination now very generally adopted has no less dimi- 
nished death in early life. A somewhat singular atmospherical 
phenomenon passed over this parish some years since. Avery smart 
shower of rain from the south-west, originating in the maritime 
parish of Caerlaverock, crossed this parish in the same direction, and 
spent itself on the confines of the parish of Tundergarth. The rain 
was salt water ; and from the heat of a clear sun immediately after 
the shower, in a short time evaporation left slight incrustations of 
salt on grass and tree. A whirlwind over the Solway, then at iiigh

In this as in Canoby jjarish, we have distinctly laid open the 
great connecting links of the various formations which compose 
the mineral history of this county. The transition rocks which 
compose the mountains of Moffat, and stretch southwards, inclose 
the vale of Annan; and, after being hid by the soil, are discovered 
again in the bed of the Annan at WiUiamwath ford, and near the 
Kettleholm bridge in the bed of the Milk. The transition rocks 
can be traced from WiUiamwath ford to the Almagil hills in Dal- 
ton parish ; whilst the same rocks on the Milk, after being covered 
for some miles by soil and the secondary rocks, are again discovered 
forming the base of Burnswark in the parish of Hoddam. The 
transition rocks in this parish are greywacke, which occurs mas- 
sive in the Annan ; whilst in the bed of the Milk the gi-ejwacke 
alternates with greywacke-slate. This rock in its slaty form has 
not yet been found so thin and solid as to be applied to economi- 
cal purposes. 

The independent coal formation makes its appearance in the 
bed of the Annan, at the head of the St Mungo glebe. Slate-clay 
and sandstone are traced lying over the transition rocks. This 
junction is beautifully laid open by a small quarry on the glebe. 
At Dalton Hook, a quarter of a mile up the river Annan from this 
ford, there occurs a large mass of conglomerate limestone, which 
idently belongs to this series of rocks. This limestone is com- 
posed of fragments of compact grayish-coloured hmestone, quartz, 
and greywacke, cemented by a clayey basis. The sandstone of 
this formation is here white; and the same coloured sandstone oc- 
curs at Cone, in the parish of Kirkpatrick, and at Cowdens, in this 
parish, though in the latter situation its colour is rather grayish- 
white. This formation again appears at Rotchell to the south- 
east of the manse, continues from that point to the shores of the 
Solway Firth, and extends through the lower part of Annandale 
and Eskdale. At Whitehill, on the north border of this parish, the 
independent coal formation may be traced in beds of clay ironstone, 
slate-clay containing impressions of shells, and ash gray-coloured 
limestone, containing petrifactions, principally mytulites. 

Secondary trap formation.— In this parish, and, indeed, through 
the whole county, only individual rocks which compose this forma- 
tion are found; but no where is the series complete. Nutholm 
hill is composed of porphyritic amygdaloid. This rock can be 
traced on both sides of the river Annan, to the little hill of Whiny- 
rigg, where it terminates, and is succeeded by the coal Ibrniation.

In the Year 1825, the plough turned up some pieces ot iich 
galena, on a farm bdongin'g to'the estate of William Carruthei. 
of Nutholm, Esq. and the tenant on making a search col ected 
about h cwt. of beautiful ore. The ground where this valuable dis- 
covery was made, lies on the north bank of the Annan, and about 
fifty feet above the bed of the river ; the soil in which it was depo- 
sited is loose gravel, over a till ferruginous clay subsoil and this 
is laid over the sandstone which has been mentioned as lying im- 
mediately under the amygdaloid and resting on the transition rocks. 
From the probabihty that a vein of lead ore might be found, a pro- 
fessional examination of this spot was made by J. Wyatt, Esq. ot 
Foolow, Derbyshire, and specimens of the ore submitted to the exa- 
mination of Professor Jameson of Edinburgh. The result of this in- 
vestigation was a resolution to form a joint-stock company, in small 
shares, in order to undertake a thorough examination of the land where 
the ore was found. Mr Wyatt procured a mining-tack for the pro- 
jected company. The greater number of shares were subscribed 
'for; and nothing was awanting but the acquiescence of the conti- 
Tuo'us proprietors, to justify the company commencing their mining 
operations. The ground being surrounded by the property of no

less than six different landholders,— untilall these gentlemen agreed 
to their terms, in the event of a vein being found, and that vein 
stretching under any of their lands, the company did not conceive 
It prudent to break ground. The greater number of these pro- 
prietors, however, refused to accede to the terms proposed ; in con- 
sequence of which the whole mining scheme was abandoned. Had 
this project in which the heritors were not required to advance one 
penny, unless they had chosen to become members of the mining 
concern, been carried into execution, the result, if successful, would 
have been the improvement of the country, the enhancing of the value 
of their estates, and the opening up of a new source of industry to their 
nearly idle cottagers. Specimens of the ore were sent to the Royal 
Museum in the University of Edinburgh, and some retained by the 
incumbent in his possession. Whether this galena has been brought 
here by the primeval waters of the globe, or knocked from off the 
mouth of some vein in the immediate vicinity, no farther attempts 
have been made to discover. No search for many years has been 
made for coal ; the shaft formerly sunk having been injudiciously 
executed, the proprietors were unwilhng again to risk their money 
even on so valuable a field of investigation.  Limestone was 
quarried for some time at Whitehill, on the north-east side of the 
parish, but has been abandoned for some years, — the rock sinking 
too deep under cover. But, just beyond the parish march on the 
west, conglomerate limestone is quarried and burnt for the private 
use of the tenants on the property of Daltonhook. 

The only simple minerals found in this parish are common jas- • 
per. Of this, some fine compact specimens, fit for the lapidary, are 
found in the bed of the Milk ; calcedony imbedded occurs in the 
amygdaloid of Barhill. Flint is found in the glebe, evidently 
brought there and manufactured into arrow-heads, or, as the coun- 
try people call them, elf-shots. Hundreds of such flints were found 
on ploughing up the holm of the glebe. Syenite in rolled masses is 
found in the parish. It is a singular fact, that the nearest mountain 
composed of this mineral isthatof Criffel, in Galloway; yet the rolled 
pieces of that primitive rock found in this parish and in the parishes 
nearer the base of Criffel, are small, but as you recede from that 
mountain the masses increase in size and quantity, and the bed of 

 One of the proprietors of this parisli actually granted a lease to some miners cf 
a lead mine on his estate, in a contiguous parish. The contractors spent some money, 
and then the miners, lead, and lease vanished iiltogether. They were drawn into this 
wikl-goose chase by having mistaken some bog iron-ore for lead.

Tanlition rocks, is a deep rich loam, constituting the most valuable 
land in the parish. The alluvial soils formed by both rivers mea- 
sure about one and a-half foot deep, and are f 
all kinds. Towards the junction of the Annan and Milk, the bed 
of the Milk is much raised by the quantity of debris carried down 
by the winter floods: hence the alluvial soil deposited there is near- 
ly a bed of gravel, of comparatively little value. 

II. — Civil History. 

The principal proprietor in this parish is Thomas Hart, Esq. of 
Castlemilk, a most active, liberal, and indefatigable improver. 

Parochial Registers.— The session-register consists of four vo- 
lumes The date of the session minute-book is 1699. The mo- 
ney accounts are regularly kept from 1699 to 1784. No regular 
accounts were kept from that time till 1803, and from that period 
up to the present term a regular register of marriages, births, bap- 
tisms, and burials has been kept. The session minutes except 
in as far as may tend to usefulness are not engrossed in the sede- 
runt-book. 

Antiquities. — From a much defaced inscription on the founda- 
tion coins, now in the incumbent's possession the parish church 
appears to have been built under one of our Alexanders ; but this 
cannot be clearly made out. A considerable part of the church 
seems to have been rebuilt from the remains of the original struc- 
ture, as the present walls contain the remains of broken pillars, 
and door and window ribats. The church was in the form of a 
passion cross, having very narrow lancet-shaped wmdows. In 
1754, the south wall not the whole church, as stated in the for- 
mer report, was rebuilt, as appears from an inscription over the

old chancel-door;  and, in 1805, to give room for celebrating the 
holy sacrament of the Lord's supper, the north transept was re- 
moved, and a new one built, and the whole structure repaired and 
modernized. The church, after these various mutilations, now 
presents a beautiful specimen of the Scots order of the ecclesias- 
tical barn architecture. The ancient baptismal font is still pre- 
served, and, on a late repair of the church, two grave-stones of 
great antiquity were discovered ; these are preserved carefully. 
The church was covered with heather till 1754. 

The funeral inscription of a family that rented the same farm 
for 300 years, is the only church-yard antiquity. The oldest head- 
stone is dated 1616. A tumulus measuring twenty-four feet dia- 
meter, and three feet deep, principally made up of animal charcoal 
and earth, was lately removed from off the lands of Sorrysikemuir. 
In the middle of the mound, was a cell three feet by two, contain- 
ing a handful of ashes ; an urn some years ago was found outside 
this cell, also containing ashes. A coin of Mary Stuart was 
found in a British camp near this Roman chancel-house, and in 
another part of the parish a lad discovered an earthen pot contain- 
ing about forty silver coins ; the oldest was of Mary and Darnley. 
They were sold for old silver. — On the farm of Cowdens, in the 
north of the parish, and near the present Glasgow road, is shown 
the spot where stood the tent from which Ralph Erskine sounded 
the trumpet of defiance against the Established church. The 
descendants of this original seceding congregation finally settled 
in the village of Lockerby, where they are distinguished for the 
piety of their sentiments, and the purity of their lives. 

 It was during this repair of the church that the celehrated gorgets were removed 
from their fastenings at the chancel-door of the churcli. Tliis word gorget, gentle 
reader, gnifies an iron collar which opened with a hinge. It was placed round the 
neck of the penitent, and padlocked by the sexton. The miserable sinner, clothed in 
sackcloth, chained up by the neck to the chancel-door, stood in " durance vile" dur- 
ing the long hours of worship. The reader may shudder, or the profligate may laugh ; 
but it was the severe discipline of the church, not more severe than a barbarous age 
required, coming in aid of our wholesome education of the yoimg, and faithful teach- 
ing of the old, which, under Providence, has exalted Scotland so high as a moral and 
religious nation. 

In the session records is an original bond, executed by a person, wherein he engages 
that there shall be no fighting or rioting at his daughter's weddrng, which he can pre- 
vent, under the penalty of L. 2 Scots. The bond was demanded by the session, and 
is dated so late as 1707. There are many entries of fines, reprimanding, &amp;c. for 
even allowing a shirt to remain drying on a hedge during the Sabbath. It was from 
such severity that the Scottisli Sablath solemnity, which is tlic admiration of the re- 
ligious world, arose. It was the holy discipline of our church which counteracted the 
tendency of the book of sports to heathenize that sncrcd day in Scotland.

There is only one heritor in the parish, who has a rental of L. 600

Character and Habits of the People.— The people are indus- 
trious, frugal, and generally temperate. The virtue of cleanliness 
in their persons and houses is daily gaining ground. They enjoy 
a fair share of the comforts of life, and, not meddhng with poli- 
tics, they are quite contented with their condition. Their ordi- 
nary food is oatmeal, potatoes, and the produce of a small garden, 

 Castlemilk, originally built by the Bruces, came into the family of Stewart by 
the marriage of Walter High Steward of Scotland with one of King Robert's 
daughters. It fell by marriage into the family of Maxwells of Nithsdale, and was sold 
by that family. Whilst a fortified place, it was besieged by the Duke of Somerset, pro- 
tector during the minority of Edward the Sixth. The Usurper during the common- 
wealth besieged this place ; against his arms it stood out a considerable time Hav- 
ing passed through so many proprietors since the original family took up their resi- 
dence on their property near Glasgow, now named after this ancient place, the very 
ghost which used to disturb the slumbers of the Stewarts and Maxwells now slum- 
bers in the burial aisle of the church.

with bacon, and occasionally a piece of beef salted for the winter. 
There are frequent instances of unlawful intercourse among the 
sexes, which, I regret to say, they too often attempt to justify on 
principle. Poaching, save by one or two worthless characters, is 
nearly unknown in the parish ; but poaching salmon in the river 
Annan is practised very generally, and by people of the most respect- 
able character, fish not being considered by the people as property.

The rotation generally followed by the tenant is green crop or 
plain fallow, barley with grass seed, two years pasturage, and oats. 
In some instances, grass is only depastured one year, and two suc- 
cessive crops of oats taken ; but this is now considered bad farm- 
ing, except where the grass is depastured for at least two years. 
Leases are of fifteen years' duration. Some proprietors require 
caution for the first three years of their leases, and others one 
year's rent per advance, to lie in the proprietor's hand at 5 per 
cent, until the last year of the lease. This last system is now 
viewed as oppressive and injudicious. The farm-buildings are in 
general good. Draining is carried on to a considerable extent ; 
and with it subdividing of farms and rearing of fences.

The great subdivision of land, and consequent want of capital, 
with deficiency of fuel, are the chief obstacles to the improvement 
of the parish. Should the search for coals in Hoddam parish prove 
successful, and as much of the land of this parish change hands, 
as has been the case within these few years, improvements will go 
on rapidly. It is by the rapid change of property, and the conse- 
quent introduction of capital, that the cultivation of the parish has 
gone on so progressively. 

The average gross amount of raw produce yearly raised in the 
parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows : 

Oats, 660 imperial acres, each at 30 Winchester bushels, at 2s. 6d. - L. 2475

The manse and . offices were built in the year 1785, for the sum 
of L. 374. These have been repaired four times at the ex- 
pense of L. 457. Half of this sum laid out at once would have 
built a better manse, and saved the heritors a great deal of money. 
The last repair of the manse, executed only three years since, has 
made it as comfortable a house as could be wished. The glebe, 
measuring thirty-five acres Scotch, is valued at L. 40 rent. The 
whole teind is surrendered, amounting to L. 174, 16s. Oj\d. . The 
church is tolerably well attended. Its great distance from two- 
thirds of the people affords an indifferent plea for non-attendance 
to the nominal Christian, and a good one to the old and infirm. 
The average number of communicants is 140. There is no dis- 
senting place of worship. The individuals dissenting are, of Roman 
Catholics 4 ; Episcopalians 4 ; Seceders 30. 

Education. — One parish school established in the year 1704, 
and an occasional private one during the winter months, are the 
only public seminaries of education. The school-house is situated 
in the very centre of the parish, as conveniently as the church is 
the very reverse. The branches of education taught, besides the 
ordinary, are Latin, Greek, and French languages. The salary 
is the maximum. The presant master is burdened with a retired 

 It may be proper to state, that tradition has preserved the reason -why the church 
of this parish is so inconveniently situated. The people having resolved many cen- 
turies since to build a church under the invocation of the far-famed St Kentigernus, 
commenced their labours on the acclivity of Nutholm hill. This spot, it seems, did 
not please the saint ; for what the people built of the church during the day, the saint 
pulled down during the night. After much consideration, it was resolved to untie 
the horse of a widow, celebrated for her sanctity and devotion to our celestial patron, 
and wherever this animal should finally settle, the spot was to be considered as fixed by 
the saint, on which his fane should be erected. The animal settled on the rich pas- 
tures of the Annan ; the people were satisfied that their heavenly friend having now 
fixed his sanctuary on this place, their work suffered no further interruption. Dur- 
ing the measuring off of tlie church-yard, the spirit of the river kelpie perceiving 
too penurious a disposition prevailing, ordered tlie boundaries to be enlarged, for in 
one day it would be filled by the bodies of the slain. He also was obeyed, and the last 
incumbent having got one rood inclosed for the burial groimd, very snugly added an 
acre and a-half of the best Uind in the parish to Ills glebe.

Every year tLe people are becoming more sensible of the blessing 
of a Jvish school, and there is the most decided evidence of im- 
provement arising from the liberal education now so generally im- 
parted to the poorest child in the parish. The school is opened

Poor and Parochial Jwnfs.— Occasional aid was by the session 
given to twelve persons annually; but, except in one or two cases 
of extreme age or hopeless disease, no individual has ever had 
adiudged to him a regular aliment, and when such is given, the 
pauper is allowed from Is. 6d. to 2s. 6d. per week. The fund for 
support of the poor has arisen wholly from church collections, 
church dues, and interest of money saved from these sources by the 
session ; during the incumbency of the present minister, the yearly 
amount of church collections and church dues is L. 22 ; this in- 
cludes the extra collections made at the celebration of the holy 
sacrament, which is administered twice a-year. The session have 
been in the habit of making up yearly a hst of such individuals or 
families as require aid, especially during the winter season: the mi- 
nister then intimates their situation pubhcly in the church, and in- 
forms the people, that certain individuals, at the expense of the 
session, will pass through the parish to receive contributions in 
money, meal, potatoes, &amp;c. for these their distressed brethren. 
The means of support collected under the direction of the session 
are applied to the support of the distressed. The session have also 
been in the habit of at times giving work to poor women in place 
of money, paying a house rent on condition their relatives shall in 
all other respects provide for them ; or maintaining a poor person's 
family at school, to prevent their becoming a burden on the parish. 
But, unless driven to it by necessity, direct payment of money from

the sessional funds, except to the diseased and aged, has always been 
avoided. The trustees on the parish roads, by an agreement with 
the session, have engaged to repair the parish roads only during the 
winter and early spring months ; and to employ only such indivi- 
duals to labour on the roads as, but for this work, would require 
aid from the session ; also, to apply the conversion money in the 
payment of horse and cart labour on the roads. The heritors and 
farmers also agree to furnish horse and cart labour for the public 
use under certain regulations, and free of all expense, to the trus- 
tees. The labourers employed on these roads are paid 2d. per 
day below the ordinary rate of wages, to make the scanty fund last 
longer, and to prevent all who can get work elsewhere and better 
wages, from burdening the fund. Poor women are also by the trus- 
tees employed in gathering stones and filling carts on the roads, 
at a fixed rate. In order to give efficacy to this parochial ma- 
chinery, the minister was empowered by the whole of the heritors 
many years since, to object to any individual or family acquiring 
a residence in the parish whom he might judge likely to become a 
burden upon it; and, in case any heritor should refuse to re- 
move the individual or families, against whose residence in the 
parish the minister objected, the heritor so refusing was bound by 
a solemn deed, jointly executed by the whole heritors, to free 
the session and other heritors of all expense, in the event of such 
a person ever at any future time requiring to be supported. Act- 
ing under these few and simple regulations, this session during the 
incumbency of the present minister has not only comfortably sup- 
ported the poor without any aid from the heritors, but laid up a 
sum, which, under judicious management, will render any assess- 
ment for the poor unnecessary. The poor, it is to be regretted, 
are not now so shy in asking sessional aid as they used to be. 

Alehouses. — There is but one public-house in the parish; and 
though kept with as great regularity as possible, still it is a source 
of much evil. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

The annual rent of this parish by a valuation made under the 
authority of the late Lord Minto in the year 1746, was L.373, 
Is. 5/gd. ; in the year 1794, when the last report was drawn up, it 
amounted to L. 1800; and now it is estimated at L. 4000. The 
population at last report was 640, and then there were 8 paupers 
and 22 dissenters; now the population is 791, and there are 12 



ST. MUNGO. 217 

naupers and 38 dissenters. The last report stated that rents were 
from L 20 to L. 80 per annum, now they are from L. 50 to L. 390. 
• At the time of last report the want of a bridge over the Milk to 
open a communication with the Solway Firth was complained of ; 
the parish roads were also said to be bad; and coal was 20 miles 
distant Now there is a bridge over the Milk, the parish roads 
are excellent, and English coal at Annan only 8 miles distant 
are abundant. At the time of the last report, there were only nine 
houses slated ; the greater number were built of mud and stones : 
only three houses had a parlour and carpet : and hardly an eight- 
dav clock or silver spoon was seen in the parish. Now there are 
onlv a few old cottages unslated : all the houses built of stone and 
hme • ten houses have carpets on the sitting-room : hardly even a 
cottage wants an eight-day clock : and every tenant and many cot- 
tagers have silver tea-spoons. At last report, the church was a 
rdn, without bell, pews. Bibles, or utensils for administering the 
sacraments, and the minister officiated occasionally in a shepherd's 
plaid ; there was no school-house, master, or provision for one ; 
now e'verything necessary is provided for the church ; there is an 
endowed school, and well-educated schoolmaster ; and the mmister 
is attired in that popish rag, a gown. Formerly the Seceders would 
not be present when any Estabhshed minister was celebratmg any 
divine ordinance, and the Episcopal clergy, in terror of the people, 
performed the rites of burial in private ; the present incumbent 
has been sent for, to attend on the sick and dying Seceders, and 
the funeral rites of the Episcopal church are performed openly in 
our churches and burial grounds.

PRESBYTEKY OF ANNAN, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. HENRY DUNCAN, D.D. MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, Sj-c. — " The parish of Ruthwell," says Chal- 
mers, "derived its name from the Anglo-Saxon Rith, a rivulet, and 
Weald, a woody place, as we learn from Somner. The Kirkton,f 
which was a baronial burgh, stands on a rivulet which falls into 
the Solway Frith about a mile below. The remains of the ancient 
woods, whence a part of the name is derived, still exist. In vul- 
gar speech, and even in the chartularies, the name of Rithwald, or 
Ruthwell, has been abbreviated into Ryval or Rival." 

Other derivations of the name have been conjectured ; but 
whatever may be thought of the etymology of the first syllable, 
that of the second seems to be confirmed by the nearly corre- 
sponding terminations of the adjoining parishes of Mousewald, 
Torthorwald, and Tinwald, all extending along the morass of 
Lochar, — a morass which runs into each of these parishes as well 
as into Ruthwell, and which the numerous remains of imbedded 
trees amply prove to have been at some distant period a continuous 
forest. 

The parish is bounded on the south by the Solway Frith, and 
by the river Lochar, which stream divides it from Caerlaverock 
both in this direction and on the west ; on the north-west by 
Mousewald ; on the north by Dalton ; and on the east by Cum- 
mertrees. It is about five miles and a-half long, by two miles and 
a-haif broad, containing somewhat less than fourteen square miles. 

Topographical Appearances, 8fc. — In its surface the parish is 

• Caledonia, Vol. iii. p. 191. 

f There is, properly speaking, no Kirkton. The village in question stands half a 
mile nearer the Solway than the church, but the rivulet passes them botli. Chal- 
mers speaks erroneously of the woods as " still existing along the bank of the rivu- 
let." They are, in fact, a mile distant from it ; but they may have been at one time 
contiguous.

ttnTttYe tide at low water recedes entirely out of sight, and 
leaves to the eye a barren and cheerless waste. 

The climate, on account of its vicinity to the sea and to the 
Locha' Moss, n ay be considered as somewhat moist; but certain- 
ly itt not u There are no prevailing distempers pecu- 
lia to the parish. Many of the inhabitants live to an advanced 
age : and not long ago an old soldier died at the age oU 
cLilated from the statement contamed m the certificate of h 
discharge, or of 110, if we rely on his own constant averment a 
to the date of his birth. Of the winds, the south-west is the most  
violent and the most pernicious to vegetation, as is distinctly indi- 
cated by the inclination of the trees. 

Springs.— There is a mineral spring at Brow, near the shore, 
where the Lochar falls into the Solway Frith. It is chalybeate, 
and of no great strength; but was formerly a well of some celebri- 
ty, and, notwithstanding the miserable accommodation for lodgers, 
of some resort. Here, is a stone table, at which it is said that 
Lord Stormont, the father of the celebrated Earl of Mansfield, sat 
with his son and drank to his health when he took leave of that 
future ornament of his country, on quitting his native land to push 
his fortune at the English Bar. On that occasion, the old noble- 
man is reported to have jocularly told his son, that he did not wish 
to see his face in Scotland again till it should be surrounded with 
the chief justice's wig,— a jest to which the event has given almost 
a prophetical character. Here also is the humble cottage in which 
the ill-fated poet Burns spent some of the latest days of his life, 
in the vain hope of restoring a broken constitution, by imbibing 
the salutary water, and breathing the pure sea air. 

Geology. The geological and mineral condition of the parish is 

marked by no peculiarity worthy of extended notice. The prin- 
cipal rock is a coarse limestone, which about forty or fifty years 
ago was worked to a considerable extent, but which has of late 
been entirely disused, having been justly superseded by the far 
purer lime of Kelhead, lying within four miles. 

About the period above-mentioned, some attempt was made to 
discover a workable vein of coal on the farm of Belridding, in the

parish, but without success, although strong indications appeared 
of the presence of that useful mineral, at least to a small extent. 
The existence of such large coal-fields on the opposite coast of 
Cumberland, where geological indications are in many respects si- 
milar, has induced a very sanguine belief that a spirited search 
would in all probability not be made in vain. 

Soil. — The soil is various, consisting, however, generally of a 
strong gravel, intermixed with vegetable mould. Towards the 
west, on the low ground near the sea, and on the banks of the 
Lochar, a sluggish strearn, there is a considerable tract of clayey 
soil, mingled with sand, which has in remote ages obviously been 
under the action of the sea, being originally of the same qualitv 
with the sleetch at present, washed by the tide. On soil of this na- 
ture, the extensive morass of the Lochar Moss, already-mentioned, 
is known generally to rest. In one place, shell marl is to be found, 
and attempts have been made to convert it to purposes of agricul- 
ture, but the expense of obtaining it has been thought to exceed 
its profit. 

Zoology. — Of the zoology of the parish little can be said that is 
not contained in the former Statistical Account. It is there stat- 
ed with truth, that the woodlark and bullfinch, as well as the other 
common birds of the district, are to be found in the woods of 
Comlongon. To this we shall only add, that various kinds of 
pheasants have within a very few years been introduced to these 
woods, where they were increasing rapidly so long as they were 
protected, but during the last year their numbers have been great- 
ly diminished by poachers. 

The fish on this coast are salmon, which are caught in small 
quantities at the confluence of the Lochar with the sea, by means 
of stake-nets ; flounders of a large size and good quality, of which 
there is an abundant supply ; and occasionally herrings, as well 
as a few cod and skate. 

The ordinary kinds of game, such as hares and partridges, are 
plentiful. Some grouse are to be met with on Lochar Moss ; and 
woodcock and black-cock are in their season by no means uncom- 
mon; nor is the fox a stranger to Comlongon woods. 

II. — Civil History. 

Land-owners. — The principal land-owner is the Earl of Mans- 
field, who derives his origin from the Murrays of Cockpool, an an- 
cient family, the chief of which was in the reign of James IV.

AMies-Bunic MonumenL-T\.e most remarkable antiquity 
in the parish is a Runic monument, which stands m the garden 
belonging to the manse of Ruthwell. This curious relic of former 
timesisaccuratelyrepresentedintheaccompanyingengraving,which 

is taken from a drawing made by the writer of this article It con- 
sists of a column inscribed partly with Runic, and partly with Roman 
characters, which is believed to be almost the only unequivocal 
vestige of Anglo-Saxon sculpture in Britain.  It has been no- 
ticed by various authors, such as Hickes, Gordon, Pennant, and 
Chalmers; but all of them have given inaccurate and deficient de- 
scriptions of it, and the plates which have been engraved to repre- 
sent it, are very defective. 

Chalmers, without assigning any reason for the conjecture, sup- 
poses the pillar to have been probably erected by some of the fol- 
lowers of Halfden, the Dane, a chief who made predatory incur- 
sions into Scotland in the years 875 and 876. It appears, however, 
from the form of the characters that the Runes on this monument 
are not Danish, but Anglo-Saxon,— a discovery which seems first 
to have been made by Wilhelm Carl Grimm, a learned German 
grammarian, and which necessarily overturns every theory of its 
Danish origin, and establishes that its date must be sought for 
during the period of the Heptarchy, or at least before the language 
or the learning of the Anglo-Saxons had, by foreign conquest and 
admixture, undergone any violent change. 

Of the early history of the column, however, little or nothing is 
known, but what may be gathered from internal evidence. On in- 
spection, the first thing that strikes an inquirer is the remarkable 
fact already mentioned, of the union on the same stone of two dif- 
ferent alphabets, the Runic and the Roman ; and this naturally 
suggests the question, whether or not any essential change may have

of anotlier such pillar in Scotland, but he does not say where it is situated; and Chal-

taken place in the form and character of the monument since its 
first erection ; but such an investigation can only he superficially 
made in a work of this kind. 

On referring to the plate, it will be seen that the pillar has four 
faces, two of which contain on the margins Runic ; and the other 
two, Roman characters; and that on the sides inscribed with the 
latter, there are Christian figures and emblems, of which the Runic 
sides are destitute. This singular combination must strike the an- 
tiquarian as affording a prima facie evidence that the sculpture has 
been executed at two different periods. But there are other cir- 
cumstances which, combined with this, will leave little doubt on the 
mind of an unprejudiced inquirer, as to the remodelling of the mo- 
nument at a period subsequent to its first erection. These circum- 
stances are, \st, That the monument consists of two separate blocks 
of sandstone, and that the upper stone containing the cross is of a 
redder hue than the lower stone, and has evidently been taken from 
another quarry, which could scarcely have happened, had both been 
formed at the same time. 2cf, That there is a bar or border at the 
top of the lower stone, running horizontally round all the four sides, 
and containing inscriptions, which divides the vine work on the 
Runic sides into two compartments, and awkwardly interrupts its 
elegant convolutions, — an intrusion which can only be satisfactorily 
accounted for on the supposition that, when first erected, the pillar 
was at this point to terminate. 3c, That the sculpture on the 
Runic sides, both in elegance of design and skill of execution, 
greatly exceeds that on the Roman sides, and indicates a high- 
er state of the art. From all these circumstances, there ap- 
pears to be satisfactory evidence that the pillar has, since its first 
erection, undergone a great change ; that it consisted at first only 
of one block, terminating with the bar already mentioned, the up- 
per stone containing the cross, having been added at a later period; 
and further, that, making allowance for the waste of time and vio- 
lence, the sculpture on the Runic sides is in its original form, but 
that the Christian figures, along with the Latin inscriptions on the 
Roman sides, were probably cut at the time of its change of shape, 
having perjps originally contained carved work of a different kind. 
The writer was at first inclined to think that the original design

The kter history of this remarkable column is not much more 
indebted to tradition than that of a more early date. In the tor- 
mer Statistical Account of this parish, mention is made of a report 
which still prevails, of its having been set up in remote times at a 
place called Priestwoodside, now Priestside, near the sea, trom 
whence it is said to have been drawn by a team of oxen. What- 
ever truth there may be in this, it is at least certain, that at a 
very early period it was erected in the church of Ruthwell, where 
it remained, and was held in the highest veneration, tdl the 
Reformation; and where, even after that period, it was preserved 
from demohtion till the middle of the seventeenth century, pro- 
bably by the influence of the Murrays of Cockpool, the ances- 
tors of the Earl of Mansfield, who had espoused the cause of the 
Stuarts and of the Episcopal party, in opposition to that of the 
Presbyterian. In 1642, however, when the latter were triumphant 
over the court and its satellites, by whom they had been at once 
cajoUed and oppressed ; and when the progress of the dispute be- 
tween Charles I. and the country party, which was rapidly coming 
to a crisis in both kingdoms, had greatly inflamed men's minds,— an 
order was passed by the General Assembly of the church f for the 
destruction of this ancient monument, as idolatrous. This order 
must have been but partially and reluctantly obeyed by the local 
authorities. The column was, indeed, thrown down and broken 
in several places, probably by its fall, and some of the emblems, 
which were peculiarly obnoxious, because objects of Popish idolatry, 
such as the crucifixion, were at the same time perhaps nearly ob- 
literated; but, after this act of obedience was performed, it was al-

was then sitting.

lowed to lie on the spot, where it fell, and probably served for more 
than a century as seats to part of the congregation, who weekly 
assembled to worship God under more simple forms, and with a 
purer faith, than those which had rendered it an object of adora- 
tion. In 1772, when inspected by Mr Pennant, it was still lying 
within the church; but soon after this, it was removed to the church- 
yard, — the increasing population, and the improved taste of the 
times, having rendered necessary better accommodation to the wor- 
shippers. In its new situation, it became more exposed to injury, 
and when the present incumbent acquired the living, he found it 
undergoing such rapid demolition, that he resolved to preserve it 
by transferring it to a place of greater security. This resolution 
was carried into effect in the summer of 1802, when it was erected 
in a garden which he had begun to form in the immediate neigh- 
bourhood of the church-yard. 

Previous to this, however, a discovery had been somewhat singu- 
larly made of a part of the column which was amissing, both when 
visited by Gordon and by Pennant. A poor man and his wife hav- 
ing died within' a day or two of each other, it was resolved that they 
should both be buried in the same grave, which, on that account, 
required to bfe made unusually deep. The grave-digger, in the 
course of his labour, came to a fragment of sandstone of consider- 
able bulk, which was found, on one of its sides, to contain the up- 
per part of the image of the Supreme Being, with , the Agnus 
Dei in his bosom; and on the reverse, a representation of the up- 
per part of two human figures in the act of embracing. On com- 
paring this fragment with the monument, it was discovered to coin- 
cide with that portion of it which Pennant mistook for the top of a 
cross, the limbs and flowing robes of the image of the Deity being 
that which he describes as " the lower part of a human figure in 
long vestments, with his feet on a pair of small globes." It had 
probably been surreptitiously buried along with the body of some 
Popish votary, from an idolatrous belief in its supernatural virtues. 

The only large fragment of the column which seems to be irre- 
trievably lost, is what contained the transverse arms of the cross, 
which may probably have been much shattered by the fall, when 
the whole was thrown down, or entirely destroyed by the zeal of 
the agents of the General Assembly. It was, however, quite evi- 
dent at what part these arms must have originally projected ; and 
the writer of this article flattered himself that he could restore them 
in nearly their former shape, which, in the year 1823, by the aid

of a country mason, he attempted to do. In this he was guided 
by the form of the capital, which is nearly entire, and which, be- 
sides, being in all probability a counterpart of the arms, contains 
on two opposite sides segments of a circle corresponding with simi- 
lar segments in the stone immediately below, — evidently indicating 
that the circle was originally completed, and formed the centre of 
the cross. 

The engraving precludes the necessity of a detailed account of 
the sculpture, but it may be proper to take some notice of its prin- 
cipal features, as well as to give an explanation of the inscriptions 
as far as they are intelligible. 

By referring to the plate it will be observed, that the two faces 
of the column which contain Runic characters are in many re- 
•spects very similar to each other. Not only do we find on either 
side a vine winding up the centre in graceful serpentine undula- 
tions, with branches enriched with fruit, starting from it at every 
turn, in regular and flowing curves, and animals of different kinds 
curiously and artfully sculptured, in the act of feeding ; but what 
is particularly worthy of remark, because evidently done with some 
design, the animals on the two sides, though in different attitudes, 
are of similar kinds, and succeed each other in the same order. 
First, there is an imaginary animal with the head, body, and wings 
of a bird, and a long flexible tail hke that of a quadruped ; then 
comes a four-footed animal, next a pair of birds, and above these

while all the rest are feeding on the grapes. 

With regard to the Runic inscriptions, a new light, as has already 
been noticed, has been thrown on the subject, by the learned and 
ingenious Mr Repp, who has published a Latin letter on the sub- 
ject in the Transactions of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, 
to which the reader is referred. A very brief outhne of that paper 
must at present suffice. 

It appears that only one specimen of Anglo-Saxon Runes has 
hitherto been generally admitted as authentic. This is the Exeter 
manuscript, noticed by the learned Hickes in his Thesaurus. Mr 
Repp has discovered that in the Runic inscription, on the Ruth- 
well monument, an alphabet is used, differing only in a few minute 
particulars from that of the Exeter manuscript,— but widely dif- 
ferent from the Norse or Islandic Runes employed by the Danes, 
He has been enabled, by employing this Anglo-Saxon alphabet,' 
to translate parts of sentences, and several detached words, such

13 cows. Ashlafardhcd, i. e. the vale of Ashlafr. Menboat, the 
expiation for an injury. 

In confirmation of the interpretation of that part of the inscription 
rendered by Mr Repp " the vessel of Christ, &amp;c." it may be pro- 
per to observe, that there is preserved along with the column an orna- 
mented circular stone, which, according to a probable tradition, 
was originally used as the pedestal of a baptismal font, or font for 
holy water. The writer's conjecture is, that this vessel stood before 
the pillar on the circular stone ; and this is the more probable, from 
the well known fact, that in Roman Catholic countries, a similar 
arrangement is in the present day exceedingly common. 

The .Roman side contains inscriptions in Latin, chiefly taken 
from the vulgate version of the New Testament, and all of them 
bearing reference to the figures on the compartments which they 
surround. Turning to the face of the column represented on the 
right hand of the plate, we find in the lowest compartment a very 
mutilated representation of the crucifixion, with the margin which 
contained the inscription, entirely destroyed. Immediately above 
this, are the figures of the Angel Gabriel and the Virgin Mary. 
Of the legend, nothing remains but two complete words, and a few 
imperfect letters ; yet these seem sufficient to enable us to ascer- 
tain the whole which appears to have been a quotation from the vul- 
gate translation of Luke, 1st Chapter, 28th verse. It runs thus, 
" Et INGRESSVS ANGELvis ad Cam dixit, ave, gratia plena  Domi- 
nus tecum: BEnedicta tu in mulieribus." 

In the next compartment, Christ is represented in the act of 
isuring a blind man. The legend appears to have been partly 
taken from the vulgate of John, 9th Chapter, 1st verse, and to have 
stood as follows : " et praeteriens viDithominem caecum a na- 
TiBiTATE natiuttate et Sanavit aB iNriRMiTate. The mistake of 
substituting a B for a v in " nativitate," may perhaps suggest some 
conjectures as to the language, or at least the dialect spoken when 
the sculpture was made. 

The next representation is that of the woman wiping the feet of 
Jesus with her hair. The inscription is from the vulgate of Luke, 
9th Chapter, 37 and 38 verses, attvlit AlabASTRVM vngventi et

The rest of the inscriptions on this side are altogether illegible, 
and the sculpture does not seem to require any particular explana- 
tion. The figure with the bow and arrow may, however, be ad- 
verted to as particularly remarkable. 

Commencing now at the bottom of the other Saxon face, we find 
both the sculpture and inscription of the first compartment entire- 
ly destroyed. The next contains a figure, supposed to be that of 
the Virgin riding on an ass, and carrying the infant Jesus in her 
armsj with a shapeless mass in the upper corner on the left, which 
may have been the representation of an angel or of Joseph. An 
inscription of which the commencement maria et io only re- 
mains, gives Qi-edibility to the conjecture that the figures were in- 
tended to represent the flight of the holy family into Egypt. 

Next come the figures breaking a loaf of bread with the inscrip- 
tion SES PAVLVS ETAf FREGERUUT PANEM IN DE- 

SERTO. It is not easy to conjecture to what scriptural or tradi- 
tionary event this refers. The allusion in the next compartment, 
however, is sufficiently evident. It contains a figure of our Saviour 
trampling on the heads of two swine, with the Greek letters IHZXPZ 
on the transverse border, while on the right hand margin we find 

IVDEX AEQYITATIS SERTO SALVATOREM MVNDI and On the left, BES- 

TiAE ET DRACONES coGNOVERVNT iNDE. If " serto" be a mis- 
spelling for certo, as is probable, the translation will be " Jesus 
Christ the Judge of Righteousness. Him assuredly to be the Sa- 
viour of the world, beasts and dragons knew from thence," allud- 
ing to the miracle of the devils dracones sent into the herd of 
swine {best ice. 

Immediately above this on the upper stone, is the image of the 
Father, with the Agnus Dei in his bosom, and his feet on two 
globes, indicating probably his power over the world which now is 
and that which is to come. The only letters of the legend which 
can be deciphered, are doramvs, doubtless adoramus. The in- 
scription round the eagle at the top of the cross i» altogether 
effaced. 

Besides the Runic monument, of which so lengthened a de- 
scription has now been given, there are in the same garden, two

sculptured stones about the size and shape of common grave-stones, 
but without any inscriptions, each containing the figure of an or- 
namented cross, rising in the centre on a pedestal, and on the rigiit 
side a sword of ancient form ; while on the left side, there appears 
on the one the coulter and sock of a plough, and on the other a 
bugle-horn attached to a baldrick or belt, by a ring. The figures 
are very rudely carved. 

These remains are said to have been originally placed in a 
church-yard of a small chapel or preceptory, belonging to the 
Knights of St John, which we are informed by ancient records was 
erected at a place still called from that circumstance the Kirkstile, 
about a mile distant from the parish church, though no traces of 
it are now to be found. These memorials of the dead were found 
by the present incumbent lying in the parish burying-ground, 
whence he removed them, and they now form part of the wall of 
a summer-house attached to the fruit-wall, which separates the 
garden from the church-yard. 

In the wall of the above-mentioned summer-house are also in- 
serted some very remarkable specimens of a phenomenon which 
has excited considerable interest and speculation among geologists, 
— that of distinct tracks of animals of various sizes in sandstone. 
These specimens are three in number ; and one of them, where 
the foot-marks are particularly distinct, has been pronounced by 
Dr Buckland to be the track of a large tortoise. They were 
taken from the quarry of Corncockle Muir, in the parish of Loch- 
maben, where many other appearances of a similar kind have been 
discovered in the act of quarrying ; some of them so deep below 
the surface of the quarry as forty-five feet. Most of these have un- 
fortunately been destroyed by the workmen, who were altogether 
ignorant of their geological importance.  

Before leaving the head of antiquities, it may be proper to men- 
tion the ancient residences of the predecessors of the Earl of 
Mansfield ; and this we shall do in the words of the late John Mur- 
ray, Esq. of Murraythwaite, himself a cadet of that old family, who 
drew up the report of this parish for Sir John Sinclair : " The 
only ancient building in the parish is the castle of Comlongon, 
the seat of the Viscount of Stormont, f which, although erected 
some centuries ago, is still entire. It was a considerable place of

Leased at one'period by the very impolitic tax which was imposed 
on the registration, and at another, by the irritation among the lower 
orders consequent on the extension of the mihtia service to Scot- 
land,-the register having become unpopular by bemg employed 
for L purpose of ascertaining the ages of the young men subject 
to the ballot. The yearly average of the births may be 23 or 24, 
though the parish register does not exhibit so high an average 
it beLg necessary to make some allowance for the negligence of 
parent in obtaining registration for their children. 26 births were 
registered in 1829, and 21 in 1830. No accurate account can be 
given of deaths and marriages, from the want of parish registers oi 
these events.

No cause of a local nature can be assigned for the increase up 
to 1821 ; and it must be attributed almost solely to the general 
improvement of agriculture, which has so materially added to the 
amount of the common necessaries of life, and at the same time im- 
proved their quality. It is true, indeed, that, since Dr Webster's

census, a small village has arisen, which took its origin in an at- 
tempt to work the lime quarry already alluded to, but, at the high- 
est calculation, this has not added more than 100 to the number 
of the inhabitants. 

The following returns are copied from a census of the parish 
taken by the present incumbent in the years 1824-5, since which 
period the population has been nearly stationary. It shows a po- 
pulation somewhat under that of the Government census; but as it 
was taken with great care, and each family was separately enrolled, 
the writer is inchned to rely on its correctness. A common source 
of error in the returns to Government arises from the circumstance, 
that the inhabitants frequently state to the schoolmaster the whole 
number of children belonging to their respective families, whether 
residing in the parish at the time or not,— a mistake which must 
swell the amount, by causing many individuals to be counted more 
than once. The difference in the present instance probably arises 
from that source. The minister's census only includes the num- 
ber actually residing in the parish at the time it was taken.

gious character of the people is sucli as generally prevails over the 
agricultural districts of Scotland, and honourably distinguishes the 
peasantry of this country from the same class of inhabitants in any 
other country of the world. The day-labourers, especially those 
who have families, suffer numerous privations with exemplary pa- 
tience. They are in general sober, active, and industrious; but 
the want of constant employment prevents them from acquiring 
many of the comforts and conveniences of life, and not unfrequently 
reduces them to severe distress. 

About half a century ago, when the Isle of Man was a separate 
prmcipality, many temptations were held out for smuggling, which 
some of the inhabitants of this parish, as well as of the neighbour- 
ing district, had not sufficient virtue to resist ; but this irregularity 
has long ceased. Poaching in game, however, still continues to be a 
source of animosity between the lower and higher ranks of society. 

There is no insane person in the parish, nor any who, in the 
strict sense of the word, can be called fatuous, though there are 
two or three individuals obviously deficient in their intellectual 
powers. One of these was till lately exceedingly remarkable for 

the extent of his memory, and his powers of mental calculation, 

faculties which have been much impaired by frequent epileptic at- 
tacks, to which he is subject. There is one poor woman blind, 
and another who was born deaf and dumb, besides whom there is 
one man who lost his hearing by disease.

 When the present incumbent was settled in the pai-ish upwards of tliirty years

pily succeeded,

The kinds of trees generally planted or indigenous in the parish 
are oak,  ash, larch, Scotch fir, birch, alder, &amp;c. The Earl of 
Mansfield keeps a forester, under whose judicious management he 
receives from his woods by periodical feUing, by thinning, and by 
preparing bark, an income of from L. 500 to L. 600 a-year. 

Husbandry, c. — With regard to the state of husbandry, the 
common breeds of sheep and cattle, rate of labour, and the price 
of different articles of raw produce, this parish differs httle from 
the parishes in the vicinity, and, to avoid inconvenient repetition, 
the reader is referred to the Accounts of these parishes for infor- 
mation on such subjects. The farm-buildings and inclosures are 
far from being in a satisfactory state, which circumstance certain- 
ly operates in various ways as an obstacle to improvement. The 
duration of the leases, however, which is usually fifteen years, is 
thought to be equitable at once to the landlord and to the tenant. 

The following is an account of the land in lease, the rental, the 
farm produce, and the live stock of the parish, as contained in the 
private census already-mentioned, taken by the writer in 1823-24.

• It may not be improper to record here, that some boys transplanted a young oak 
on the day of the first anniversary of the battle of Waterloo to a spot a few paces in 
front of tlie manse door, under the roots of which a bottle was afterwards deposited, 
containing an inscription, which some antiquary of a future age may delight to find 
and to deciplier. This tree bears the name of the Waterloo Oak. 

+ This is independent of the minister's glebe, which consists of thirty-six acres, 
nearly five of which are occupied with a garden, pleasure-ground, and plantation 
round the manse, the rest being all arable, and subjected to a rotation of five years.

DUMFRIES-SMIRE, 



Considerable improvements have been made by various farmers on 
portions of the moss lands within their respective farms; and it may 
be proper to mention one tenant in particular, who, by wedre-drain- 
ing and judicious cultivation, has reclaimed many acres from a 
state of waste and unproductive morass, and converted them into 
good arable ground. 

Some valuable land has also been reclaimed along the shore of 
the Solway Frith; but this has hitherto been done on a very small 
scale, though there can be no doubt that Lord Mansfield might, 
with much profit to himself, as well as advantage to the parish' 
gain from the tide by that operation a tract of fertile soil little 
short of a thousand acres. This extensive improvement was spoken 
of so far back as the time when Sir John Sinclair's Account was 
drawn up, and has of late been again under consideration, but with- 
out any prospect of being soon carried into effect; and yet it ap- 
pears to the writer that there could scarcely be a more beneficial 
investment of capital.  

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Villages.— This is entirely a country parish, lying between the 
towns of Dumfries and Annan, from the former of which the church 
is distant about ten miles ; and from the latter, seven. There are 
two small villages in the parish. The one, called the village of 
Ruthwell, containing nearly 180 inhabitants, and the other, called 
Clarencefield, containing about 100. The village of Ruthwell 
was made a burgh of barony by charter of James VI. to Sir John 
Murray of Cockpool in 1509, with the privilege of holding fairs 
and markets, which has long been disused. It is a place without 
trade or manufacture. 

 The practice of making salt by filtrating the sea sand or sketch, described with 
sufficient accuracy in Sir John Sinclair's Statistical Acbount, and detailed by the 
writer of this more at large in Dr Singer's Agricultural Survey of Dumfries-shire, 
has altogether ceased along this coast since the removal of the salt duty, as it has, by 
this means, become much cheaper to purchase salt than to manufacture it after the 
method pursued here. The act of the Scottish Parliament, on whicli the Annandale 
saltmakers founded this right to exemption from duty, is dated 12th July 1671, and 
proceeds on a supplication by Adam Newall, « in behalf of some people and tenants 
in Annandale, who, by their industry and wholesome labour, do, from sand, draw 
salt, and who, in regard to the painfulness and singularity of the work, have been 
free of public imposition or exaction; until the year 1656, or thereby that the late 
usurper, contrary to all reason, equity, or former practice, forced from them an exac- 
tion, to their overthrow and ruin, and thereby dispossessed them, so that they are in 
a starving condition." Several attempts were at different times made, to subject the 
Annandale salt to the payment of the usual duty, but without success.

Means of Communication. — The access to the parish is easy, 
as it is traversed by one of the great toll roads leading from Dura- 
fries to Annan and Carlisle, which is kept in excellent repair. A 
heavy coach passes and repasses daily along this road through the 
towns already-mentioned, which affords a ready means of convey- 
ance to all parts of the kingdom. There is also a runner who re- 
sides in the parish, and who goes regularly with letters and parcels 
to Dumfries and Annan on alternate days, Sabbath excepted, as 
well as a carrier, who drives his cart to the former town twice, and 
to the latter once, a-week. Besides these modes of communica- 
tion by land, there is a creek at the debouche of the Lochar, where 
small vessels find access, and by means of which the inhabitants 
are usually supplied with coal from the opposite coast of Cumber- 
land. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated within the 
precincts of the glebe, about a mile and a-half from the eastern 
extremity of the parish, and between five and six miles from its 
western extremity. As the two villages, however, lie towards the 
east, each about half a-mile distant from the church, its situation 
could not be considered as inconvenient, were it not that on the 
west the Locharwoods quarter stretches to a considerable distance 
in a long stripe, bounded on the one side by the stream of the 
Lochar, and on the other side by the morass of that name, and 
rendered difficult of intercourse by the badness of the roads. This 
place of worship was about a century ago a miserable building 
thatched with heath. When the present incumbent came into 
possession of the living in 1799 it was scarcely in a better con- 
dition ; for, though slated, it still remained without a ceiling, and 
was of most inconvenient dimensions, being within the walls 96 
feet long, and only 14 broad. Soon after this period, it under- 
went a thorough change, 30 feet having been taken off its length, 
and ten feet added to its breadth. It was even then, however, fi- 
nished in a very slovenly manner, and has since undergone, at dif- 
ferent times, considerable repairs, which have at last rendered it 
comparatively comfortable, though still, in point both of accommo- 
dation and of architecture, much inferior to some of the neighbour- 
ing churches, and to the average state of these public buildings 
throughout the country. It affords easy accommodation for 
about 420 sitters. There are only ten or twelve sittings unappro- 
priated ; but the accommodation of the villagers and cottaoers has

The manse was built a little more than a century ago, and soon 
atter the accession of the present incumbent, received considerable 
repan-s, with the addition of two rooms. 

 The glebe contains somewhat more than thirty-six acres but 
the land is only of moderate quality, though it has been much im- 
proved withm the last thirty years by enclosing, draining, and 
cultivation. It might let at present on lease for 30s. or 35s. an 
acre. 

The whole teinds of the parish were granted to the living by 
decreet of the Court of Session in 1821,— amounting to L 62 
18s. 10/od.  • ' 

Except five or six individuals, the whole inhabitants of the parish 
belong to the Estabhshed church, and their attendance is in gene- 
ral constant and exemplary. There are in the parish between 300 
and 400 regular communicants. 

Education.~T\ievQ are two parochial schools in the parish, be- 
sides one or two schools taught occasionally by private individuals, 
on a very small scale. The chief parochial school is in a very 
thriving condition, and, when most numerously attended, contains 
about 200 scholars. The average number may be about 150. Be- 
sides the ordinary branches, the classics and French, as well as 
geography, mensuration, &amp;c. are successfully taught in this aca- 
demy. The other parochial school, which is established in the 
more remote and almost detached district of Locharwoods, has for 
some time been in a languishing condition, owing to the precarious 
health of the teacher. He has, however, of late procured an as- 
sistant, whose instructions between 20 and 30 scholars at present 
attend. 

The salary of the principal schoolmaster was fixed by the heri- 
tors and minister when convened under the statute, after the strik- 
ing of the average at the value of two chalders, being L.34, 4s. 5d. 
and that of the other schoolmaster, at the value of half a chalder, 
being L. 8, lis. ld.; but, as the legality of this latter decision has 
been justly disputed, the question as to the power of altering it is 
at present under consideration. 

The school fees were, in the year 1803, settled by the presby- 
tery of Annan, for all the schools within its bounds, as follows, viz. 
For English reading, per quarter, 2s. ; for reading and writing, 2s. 
6d. ; for reading, writing, and arithmetic, 3s. 6d. ; for the classics, 



RUTHWELL. 



237 



5s. The amount of fees actually received by the parochial school- 
master may be L. 45 a-year. 

The writer believes that there is not a single native parishioner 
upwards of six or seven years of age who cannot read; nor does he 
know of any individuals who have settled in the parish from a dis- 
tance by whom this advantage is not enjoyed. There are several 
females of the lowest class who cannot write, but, so far as he 
knows, not a single male above the age of ten or twelve. 

Besides the weekly schools, there are three Sabbath schools re- 
gularly taught in the parish, one in the manse during winter, and 
in the church during summer; another in the village of Ruthwell; 
and a third in the school-house of Locharwoods ; at which, collec- 
tively, about 120 scholars are instructed in the first principles of 
religion. These schools have been attended with the happiest 
effects, forming, as they do, a more intimate and salutary connec- 
tion between the minister and his youthful parishioners, and serv- 
ing to impress upon the minds both of parents and children the 
paramount value of a Christian education. Such institutions have, 
indeed, been objected to, from a fear lest they should take reli- 
gious instruction out of the hands of parents, or at least render 
these natural guardians less alive to the duty of personally incul- 
cating on their offspring the truths and obligations of our holy 
faith. But the experience of the writer has led him to form a di- 
rectly contrary opinion ; and he can confidently affirm, that since 
the introduction of Sabbath schools into the parish, his people have 
been visibly more attentive than formerly to the pious instruction 
of their children at home, — a fact which he considers of unspeakable 
importance, and which he believes to be consistent with the expe- 
rience of all who have heartily adopted the system. 

Literature. — A parochial library was established in the parish 
about thirteen or fourteen years ago, when a number of appropriate 
books were procured by subscription ; but there were only a few 
individuals, beside the minister and principal schoolmaster, who 
took a warm interest in the scheme ; and the subscribers having 
gradually dropt off, it is at present entirely disused. An attempt, 
however, is now making to revive this useful institution, which pro- 
mises to be much more successful.  Meanwhile, a library connect- 
ed with the Sabbath schools is in active operation, which furnishes

success.

the means of improving; reading not only to the cliildren connected 
with them, but also to their parents, of which they eagerly avail 
themselves. 

Charitable and other Institutions. — There are two friendly socie- 

4;ies in the parish, the one for males, and the other for females, 

the former of which has been in existence about thirty-six years, 
and the latter upwards of thirty. They are both in a flourishing 
condition in point of numbers  notwithstanding the members have 
been so imprudent as to make a division of part of their funds on 
two several occasions during years of scarcity,— a measure which 
the minister, who has always taken a leading interest in both in- 
stitutions, did every thing in his power to prevent. Where the ne- 
cessity of relieving the pressure of immediate want was so strong, 
it was scarcely to be expected that his remonstrances should have 
been effectual, especially as the example was set by almost all the 
neighbouring societies. It is, however, to be hoped that the wise 
provisions of the Friendly Society Act passed in 1829, will operate 
as an effectual check on such improvident conduct for the future. 
How far such institutions serve to promote industry, it may be dif- 
ficult to say, — but that they are productive of other advantages of 
great importance, cannot be doubted. In this parish, they have 
been a powerful means of preserving in the minds of the people a 
spirit of independence, and of restraining the evils of pauperism, 
which in other places the circumstances of the times have contri- 
buted so largely to extend. 

Savings Bank. — A parish or savings hank, has been established 
in this parish since the year ISlO.f The funds of the institution 

• There are about 130 members in the male society, and about 90 in the female. 

t The cii-cumstances which led to the formation of this institution are thus detail- 
ed in an essay on parish banks, published by the author in 1815 : " About the be- 
ginning of the year 1810, the founder of that establishment had been anxiously em- 
ployed in examining the different plans which had from time to time been suggested 
for ameliorating the condition of the lower orders ; and in the course of liis inquiries, 
he happened to meet with a pamphlet giving an account of a scheme called by the 
inventor, John Bone, Esq. of London, " Tranquillity," of a nature perhaps too com- 
plicated for general adoption. One of the proposed provisions of this plan, however, 
was an economical bank for the reception of the small savings of the industrious. 
The benefit which might result from carrying a plan of this latter kind into effect imme- 
diately appeared to the writer in a very strong light, and he determined, as the best means 
of ultimately introducing it to general notice, to try, in the first place, the effect of 
its operation in the very contracted sphere of his own parish. In this attempt there 
were discouragements of a peculiar kind, which it will not be improper to state, tliat 
the success of the experiment may appear in its true light. In point of local circum- 
stances, indeed, there are perhaps few parislies in Scotland where the scheme might

have been oradually prog-rcssive, and at last settlement in May 
1833, amounted to the sum of L. 3143, 2s. 2d. giving an average 
yearly increase since the commencement of somewhat more than 
L. 146. The average amount invested yearly is L. 600 ; with- 
drawn yearly, L. 400. 

Banks for savings have now got so firm a footing in the united 
kingdom, and have extended themselves so rapidly to other coun- 
tries, that it seems superfluous in this place to detail their advan- 
tao-es. But it is to be feared that these institutions have in many 
instances operated to the injury of Friendly societies— kindred 
establishments which every person acquainted with the circum- 
stances and wants of the lower orders must regard as useful aux- 
iliaries, and not as rivals. The latter are in truth the only protection 
to individuals belonging to the labouring class of the community, 
in the event of their being overtaken by sudden illness, or disabiUty, 
before they could have made any consideraTsle accumulation in 
a savings bank. 

Associations, Sc. — Two societies for religious purposes, one male 
and the other female, have, for a number of years, subsisted in the pa- 
rish ; but the unhappy disputes which originated from the miscon- 
duct of the managers of the British and Foreign Bible Society have 
cooled the ardour of many, and reduced both societies to little more 
than a mere nominal existence. The annual average amount of 
their joint contributions may perhaps have been from L.8to L.IO. 

not have been tried to gi-eater advantage than in the parish of Ruthwell. One of these dis- 
couragements arose from want of resident heritors, who might countenance the xmder- 
taking with their approbation, and support it with their purse and influence. But there 
was a still more formidable difficulty to encounter. Notwithstanding by far the greater 
part of the inhabitants are poor villagers, or cottagers, without manufactures, or any 
other means of subsistence, than such as are usually to be found in a remote country 
parish, there were a great majority of the adults no fewer than 300 individuals, out 
of a population of 11 00 already connected with fi-iendly societies, within the bounds of 
the parish. It was well known that by far the greater part of these individuals were 
obliged to strain every nerve for a bai'e subsistence, and, so far from being able to lay 
up any adtlitional savings, found at times extreme difficulty in fulfilling their engage- 
ments to the established societies. As these institutions were under the immediate 
superintendence of the author, he was not ignorant of the facts stated ; but they did 
not seem to him to constitute an objection sufficiently strong to dfftcr him from mak- 
ing a trial of the projected scheme. He knew from experience that he had to deal 
with a sober, virtuous, and well-informed population, and, on this single favourable 
circumstance, he founded the conviction, that his attempt would not prove altogether 
abortive. He was not disappointed, the scheme was drawn up and put into execu- 
tion, with the advice and co-operation of some of the most respectable inhabitants of 
the parish ; and in the period of four years and a-balf, the funds of the institution 
have risen to upwards of L. ] 160."

DUMFRIES-SIIUIE. 



The Annandale Society for the Conversion of the Jews also holds 
Its meetings in this parish. Its annual contribution to that object 
IS about L. 10 or L. 12. 

To these societies may be added one instituted for the purpose 
of purchasing school-books for the use of poor scholars. These 
books are not given, but lent to the children, who are required to 
return them when no longer needed in the school. Much good has 
been effected by this association at a trifling expense. 

Besides the sums thus raised, about L. 6 or L. 7 may be an- 
nually obtained in church by extraordinary collections for religious 
and charitable objects. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The following tabular view of the 
state of the poor in this parish drawn up in 1827, for the infor- 
mation of the heritors, will aff'ord a more distinct account of the 
situation and circumstances of those who receive parochial aid than 
could easily be done by any other mode of representation. The 
only alteration made on it worth mentioning, is the substitution of 
numbers in place of the names of the individuals.

Besides the enrolled poor, it is frequently necessary to extend the 
assistance of the session to indigent individuals, who, from sickness 
or other causes, fall into temporary want; but the whole sum year- 
ly expended by the session exclusive of extraordinary demands in 
years of scarcity does not amount to more than L. 54 or L. 55 a- 
yeai. 

To meet this expenditure, the church collections amount to 
about L. 25 yearly, — a sum by no means small, when the nature of 
the population is considered, which is entirely agricultural. The 
heritors supply the remainder on the private application of the mi- 
nister, by an annual contribution, altogether voluntary, without any 
stated meetings, or any nice adjustment of their subscriptions, to 
the relative value of their property in the parish. Indeed, of the 
five heritors by whom the whole land of the parish is possessed, 
two contribute very little to the support of the poor ; the kirk- 
session choosing rather to throw themselves on the generosity 
and good sense of those who are wilHng to give, than, by calling 
legal meetings, to bring a permanent and necessarily increasing 
poor rate on the parish, with all its demoralizing consequences. 

A practice used formerly to prevail in this parish, and is still 
customary in the neighbourhood, of raising a smalLsum for the re- 
lief of a poor family, by means of what is called a drinking, a 

kind of rustic ball, for which whisky and other refreshments were

procured by those intended to be benefited. The custom was, for 
two individuals, furnished with a certificate by the minister, to go 
through all the respectable houses in the parish, inviting the inha- 
bitants to this festivity, and, through these agents, such as could not 
find it convenient to give their personal attendance, were expected 
to bestow on the family in question a charitable contribution. 
Meetings of this kind, however, being frequently attended with 
irregularities, were discouraged by the present incumbent; and the 
drinking having in consequence fallen into disuse, simple -contri- 
butions raised by persons offering their gratuitous services, or hired 
for the purpose of collecting them, have been happily substituted 
in their stead. 

Inns and Alehouses. — In this parish the writer took much pains, 
and incurred considerable obloquy, in endeavouring to suppress un- 
necessary pubhc-houses. Notwithstanding all his efforts, however, 
there are still three licensed houses of this description within the 
parish, where one would be quite sufficient. 

;Puel. — The fuel usually employed by the inhabitants is peat, 
procured from that branch of the Lochar moss which skirts the 
parish. It is of tolerable quahty, and may probably cost some- 
what more than a shilling a cart load, when carried home, and stack- 
ed up for use. Coal is also used by the better classes, of which 
sixty or seventy tons may be yearly consumed in the parish. It 
is procured, as already mentioned, from the opposite coast of Cum- 
berland, and costs from seven to eight shillings the ton of four- 
teen cwt. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

The funeral rites are now performed in this part of Scotland with 
a decent solemnity; but till lately, the demoralizing practice of pre- 
senting several services, as they are called, of spirituous hquors pre- 
vailed very extensively among the middle and lower classes in this 
district. The custom was the more inveterate, as on such occasions 
the minds of the relatives of the departed are apt to be unhing- 
ed, and less capable, perhaps, of acting with decision than at other 
times. The present incumbent fell on a simple expedient, by 
which this practice has been completely abolished. Having en- 
gaged the co-operation of some of the leading men in the parish, 
he drew up a subscription paper, binding the subscribers, among 
other less important regulations, to give only one service when they 
had the melancholy duty of presiding at a funeral themselves, and

to partake of only one service when they attended the funeral of 
a neighbour. This paper was readily subscribed by almost every 
head of a family in the parish, and whatever was injurious in the 
practice was abolished at once. It required, indeed, some little 
attention and perseverance to prevent the revival of so ancient a 
custom; but the propriety and usefulness of the change was so 
clearly seen, that it has not only been firmly established in the pa- 
rish, but has given rise to similar resolutions in all the neighbour- 
ing parishes, and, speaking generally, may be said to have effec- 
tually rooted out the former practice, throughout the whole sur- 
rounding district. If in any other quarter of the country a similar 
abuse exists, the philanthropist may learn from this example how 
to apply a remedy.

PRESBYTERY OF ANNAN, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. GEORGE GILLESPIE, MINISTER. 



1. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, Sfc. — In the charter-deeds of the 12th cen- 
tury, the name of the parish is Cumbertrees, which Chalmers in 
his Caledonia derives from the three British words, Cum-ber- 
tres, signifying " the hamlet at the end of the short valley" — and 
probably referring to a hamlet or village, not on the site of the pre- 
sent village of Cummertrees, but more to the south, and nearer 
to the sea than the present village, upon a small piece of level 
ground, at the end of a short valley, formed into an angle by two 
streams, meeting in front, and taking from thence a lateral direc- 
tion to the sea. Some of the old inhabitants still remember se- 
veral houses standing upon the site referred to ; and from the great 
number of hearth stones dug up, and the quantity of charred wood 
found by the farmer in ploughing the ground, there is reason to 
believe that at one time it had been a hamlet of considerable size. 
Many, however, are of the opinion that the parish got the name 
of Cummertrees, from its being formerly covered with timber ; 
large quantities of which are still found in the different mosses 
throughout the parish. 

Cummertrees, including the parish or chapelry of Trailtrow, an- 
nexed to it since the Reformation, is about 7 miles in its greatest 
length, and about 4 in its greatest breadth, containing upwards of 
8000 Scotch acres. 

It is bounded on the south by the Solway Frith ; on the east, 
by the parishes of Annan, Hoddam, and St Mungo ; by Dalton 
on the north ; and Ruthwell on the west. In its form it is exceed- 
ingly irregular, especially on the east ; whilst an arm of Cummer- 
trees extends to the bridge at the burgh of Annan, a broad belt of 
Annan parish penetrates nearly to its centre.

Topographical Appearances. — The greater part of the parish 
is an inclined plain, rising gently from the south towards the 
north. The highest point of land in Cummertrees is the ridge 
on which stands the tower of Repentance, being nearly 200 feet 
above the level of the sea. From Repentance, the ground de- 
scends rapidly for upwards of half a mile towards the N. E. as 
far as the river Annan, which forms the boundary between Cum- 
mertrees and the parishes of Hoddam and St Mungo. The whole 
of the coast is flat, sandy, and uninteresting. The only bay 
in the parish is Queensberry Bay, where vessels of a small burden 
can be sheltered from the N. and N. W. winds. A small stream 
named Cummertrees Pow winds into the Frith through the centre 
of the bay, and on each side stands Queensberry village, much fre- 
quented during the summer months by bathers from the interior. 

Meteorology Climate Sfc. — The climate is moist and variable, 
which, may be partly attributed to the large tracts of flat and uncul- 
tivated moss scattered over various parts of the country, as well as to 
the vast quantities of fresh water flowing daily into the Solway from 
the rivers Nith, Annan, Esk, and Eden. In showery weather, it is cu- 
rious to see how nature replenishes her watery store-houses, by draw- 
ing vapours from the Frith, which are collected in clouds along the 
steeps and summits of the hills on each side of the coast, and scat- 
tered by the first blast of the W. and S. W. winds in showers over 
the lower districts of Dumfries-shire. The thermometer in a 
room in Cummertrees manse, fronting the S. E. fell in the winter 
of 1830-31, as low as 22°, and in the months of June and July in 
the same years, rose as high as 84° ; but the medium temperature 
is about 55°. Fah. 

The prevailing winds throughout the year are the S. and S. W. 
A clear sky in the E. in the morning, with black clouds in the W. 
is considered an infallible sign of rain before night. If the sea- 
fowls are observed flying with loud cries, from the sea towards the 
land, making sharp curves in the air, lighting for an instant on the 
fields, then suddenly rising again,— this also is considered the prog- 
nostic of a coming storm. Few parishes in the south of Scotland 
are more healthy and subject to less frequent epidemics than Cum- 
mertrees. From the variableness of the weather, during the win- 
ter months, common colds are not unfrequent ; but of simple ty- 
phus, there is seldom a case south of Repentance-ridge. The 
land as has already been observed rises gradually from the sea 
towards the north ; and there is little stagnant or standino- water 



DUMFRIES-SHIllE. 



in the parish to generate infection ; nor is there a glen or ravine 
of any extent to prevent the wind from having a free and full sweep 
over nearly the whole parish, from the sea. 

Hydrography. — The Solway Frith that bounds Cummertrees 
on the south is, in width from shore to shore, opposite this parish, 
fully seven miles, when it is full tide ; but when it is ebb-tide, the 
only water in the Frith is that of the rivers Esk, Eden, and Annan ; 
the Esk and Eden unite several miles to the east of Cummertrees, 
and after their junction with the Annan, they run for upwards of 
a mile in one large and deep navigable channel. The stream then 
suddenly separates, one part running along the English coast, and 
another along the Scotch, forming what is commonly called the 
English and Scotch channels. From the vast plain of sand over 
which the Solway tide flows, the water near to the shore is gene- 
rally muddy ; for the same reason, the temperature is higher than 
common. In dry seasons, when there is but little fresh water flow- 
ing into the Solway, its saltness is nearly equal to that of the Frith 
of Forth a few miles to the N. E. of Newhaven. The tide in the 
Solway ebbs very far, and flows again sometimes at the rate of 
eight or ten miles an hour, when the wind blows hard from the S. 
and S. W. When the tide is coming in these angry moods, its 
loud roaring is heard by the people along the shore for upwards of 
twenty miles before it reaches them. In such seasons, before the 
first wave is discernible from the shore, there is seen a cloud of 
spray whirling and dashing forward ; then a long curved white and 
flowing surf, and on a sudden, the large wave itself appears throw- 
ing forward its speckled body three feet abreast with awful im- 
petuosity. 

The only mineral springs in Cummertrees are chalybeates. 
One near Cummertrees mill is sometimes recommended by the 
neighbouring physicians, and, were any care taken to keep it free 
of common water, its healing properties would no doubt much 
increase. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The only two kinds of rocks as yet 
found in Cummertrees are limestone and sandstone; the direc- 
tion is to the N. E. The sandstone along the south of the parish 
is of a very soft quality, and lies generally below a covering of sand, 
gravel, or moss; towards the middle of the parish it becomes 
harder, and lies either under, or parallel with the limestone. In 
the north of the parish, the sandstone rises to the surface, and is 
of so hard a quality that it is very difficult to be wrought. The

limestone bed is about. 30 feet in thickness, and inclines one foot

in seven, and sometunet. uip M 17 nf the Dresent

X hef Annan and Middlebie, where there are several hme- 
work The lime at Kelhead in Cummertrees is considered far 
TpeL to any in the country, being ninety-six parts pure in a 
rundred. No'veins or fissures are cut across, nor are there any 
separate beds of magnesian limestone o-d intermix h 
common limestone. Rolled blocks or boulders of "-etone are 
frequently found imbedded in the earth that covers the hme tone 
rock, but are always separated from the sohd rock by a thick layer 
of clay; and the organic remains formed in the limestone be- 
long both to the animal and vegetable kingdoms, and he near to the 
bottom of the quarry imbedded in large boulders of brown-colour- 
ed marble, which, when cut and polished, are exceedmgly beauti- 
ful, being curiously speckled with the various petrifactions. ihe 
vegetable remains bear a strong resemblance to reeds, ihe ani- 
mals are chiefly large and beautiful party-coloured shells, and cor- 
nua ammonis of various sizes. Some of the shells, orthoceratites, 
when cot out, are nearly two feet in length, and bear a strong re- 
semblance to the vertebra of sharks. Marl used formerly to be 
dug from two or three bogs in the parish ; but smce the openmg 
of the lime-works at Kelhead, the digging of marl has been dropt ; 
indeed it is generally supposed that there is but little marl re- 
maining to be dug in the parish. Several trials have been made 
to find coal, but they have hitherto proved unsuccessful. It is in- 
deed to be suspected, that none of the borings have been carried 
deep enough,— at least none of them have been wrought to nearly 
one-third of the depth of the Cumberland field that is now work- 
ing near Whitehaven, and has already advanced two miles in the 
direction of Scotland, below the sands of the Solway, without any 
appearance of the field diminishing. 

The soil of the parish is of various kinds ; some parts sandy, 
others gravelly, others of deep rich loam ; but the greater part is a 
thin wet clay over hard till, and requires both much labour and 
manure before it will grow crops of any kind. 

Zoolo/j.— The River of Annan, which skirts this parish to the 
east, abounds in salmon, common trout, and herling. It is much 
disputed among fishers, whether or not the herlings are a species 



248 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



of fish distinct from the salmon. Those who maintain that they 
are distinct, argue that there are two kinds of herhngs, the one 
red, the other white ; while the other party deny this, alleging that 
the same herling is red at one season of the year, and white at ano- 
ther, and that, when they have plenty of food, they become red 
earlier in the season than at other times : these further maintain, 
that, after remaining two seasons in the river, they go down to the 
sea in spring, and return salmon in the following autumn.  In 
the Solway Frith are taken large quantities of salmon, sea-trout, 
herling, flounders, and a small species of the cod, called codlings. 
Turbot and soles are also sometimes caught, but not in large 
quantities. The fishings on this part of the Solway close on the 
25th of September, and open again on the 10th of March; but it 
is generally thought that it would be a better regulation did it 
both open and close a month later. Considerable quantities of 
mussels and cockles are gathered by the poor people along the 
shores of the Solway, and sold weekly at the Dumfries and Car- 
lisle markets. 

II. — Civil History. 

Land-owners. — Thechief of theseisthe Marquis of Queensbeny, 
whose property in the parish is upwards of 5000 acres in extent. 
The only other land-owners in the parish are the Earl of Mans- 
field, General Sharpe, and Mr Murray of Murray thwaite. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers of Cummertrees 
are not yet seventy years old ; and indeed it is only within these 
three years that they have been kept in a regular form. 

Antiquities. — On the farm of Broom there is afield called Bruce's 
Acres, where it is said that Robert Bruce, through the treachery 
of a blacksmith, sustained a severe repulse from the English. 
A quantity of human bones, and several swords, were lately found 
in a moss near the field where the battle is said to have been foughtf 

• Mr Pennant first noticed the herling as a separate species, and it is described in 
Dr Fleming's History of British Animals under the name of Salmo albus. 

-}• There is a tradition still current among the people, that Bruce, in passing along 
the shore, came to a place where a farmer gave him rye-bread to eat, and that he 
named it Rye-hill, which name it still bears. It is also said, that when Bruce was 
on the shore, at a place called Priestside, being weary and exhausted by hunger and 
fatigue, a farmer's wife fed him with bread and eggs, but witliout salt. On learning 
that the people along the Priestside were not allowed to make salt, Bruce, with his 
usual generosity, immediately granted to the people in that quarter a charter to make 
salt, duty free. Several years before the salt duty was removed, the excise tried the 
validityof the Priestside, or rather Annandale salt charter, at Edinburgh, when, nf-

Vast quantities of arms were lately found in a field on the farm of 
Corrieknows, in this parish, near the burgh of Annan but at 
what period a battle was fought on this spot it is impossible to de- 
termine The farmer who found the arms, considering them ot 
no value to the public, had them all, but a brass battle-axe, con- 
verted into husbandry utensils. He says that the swords were 
about two feet in length, edged on the one side to the handle, and 
on the other for the half length of the blade : that the spears were 
loner, but were nearly all broken, and were more injured by rust than 
theswords : that in the same field he also found a number of horse 
shoes, some of which were an entire circle, and others curiously 
turned in at the heel, while none of them were exactly in the form 
of the present horse shoe. The arms were scattered over the field, 
and not more than eight inches from the surface. 

ter much litigation, it was found to be good and sufficient ; but, that it was granted 
according to the circumstances handed down by tradition, cannot be clearly proved. 
The exemption from salt duty along the coast of the Solway in Annandale depends 
at present on an act of the Scottish Parliament granted in the time of Charles II. but 
that act records that it was a privilege enjoyed from time immemorial, till invaded by 
the usurper, Oliver Cromwell. 

 It would seem from this that the arms had not been buried nor hid there, but that 
each lay on the place where it had fallen from the hands of its owner. But if this sup- 
position be correct, the battle must have been fought previous to the founding of the 
burgh of Annan, which is within a mile of the field, and when the surrounding country 
was an almost entire wilderness; for, upon any other supposition than that of almost to- 
tal destitution of inhabitants in the neighbourhood, it would be difficult to conceive 
how such a great quantity of arms was permitted to remain unmoved till the natural 
accumulation of debris on the earth's surface formed a covering over them. The 
subsoil of the field in which they were found is a hard till, almost as impenetrable as 
rock, otherwise they would no doubt have been sunk much deeper than they were. 

There was found in the month of August 1833, on the farm of Hurkledale, Cum- 
mertrees, on a piece of moss recently brought under cultivation, upwards of 100 an- 
cient English and Scotch coins. The Scotch coins have on the right side the follow- 
ing inscription : — Alexander dei gha + encircling the profile of a king's head crown- 
ed, with an inverted sword placed in front of the head. On the reverse side, there is 
in very distinct characters kex scotorvm encircling a cross and four stars, one in each 
angle of the cross. On the right side of the English coins there is a front viewof a king's 
head crowned, which is encircled with the following letters, Enw a angi. dns ivb + . And 
on the reverse a cross with twelve balls, three forming a triangle in each angle of the 
cross. The inscriptions round the cross on the English coins are various ; on some the 
words civiTAS LONDON are very distinct ; on others civitas cantoii ; on others civitas 
EBROCAE ; on others civitas dvblinie ; and on others civitas wateiifoiid, probably 
to specify the diffisrent places of their coinage. The English and Scotch coins arc 
nearly of the same weight and size, and two pieces are scarcely equal in weight to one 
sixpence. There is no date on any of the coins. And as there are no numerals af- 
ter either of the king's names, it is likely that the Scotch are of the reign of Alexan- 
der I. of Scotland ; and the English of Edward I. of England. The brow of Alex- 
ander, as marked on the coins, is lofty and the countenance fierce, agreeable to the

DUMFIIIES-SHIRE. 



The only ancient buildings in Cummertrees are the Tower of 
Repentance, 25 feet in height, and Hoddam Castle, both said to 
have been built by Lord Herries in the fifteenth century. The 
tradition concerning the tower is, that Lord Herries having used 
the stones of the old chapel in building Hoddam Castle, of which 
he afterwards repented, built the tower both to pacify his own 
conscience, and to make his peace with the Bishop of Glasgow, 
who was the diocesan of the chapel. Upon the top of the tower, 
there still remains a place which has evidently been used to hold 
the alarm-fire. Few situations could have been better chosen for 
a watch-tower than the eminence on which it stands. It is seen on 
all sides for upwards of thirty miles. Hoddam Castle, the only old 
border place of strength now inhabited in this quarter, stands at the 
bottom of the hill, directly below the Tower of R,epentance, on 
one of the most beautiful situations that is to be found on the An- 
nan. The castle, like other buildings of the fifteenth century, is 
chiefly remarkable for its strength, and the thickness of its wall. Se- 
veral additions have been made to the original building by the diff"er- 
ent persons who have been its possessors. Its present proprietor. 
General Sharpe, has lately built a large wing to the whole, from 
plans drawn by Mr Burn, architect, in good taste, and in keep- 
ing with the rest of the building. The only modern building of 
note is Kinmount House, built by the Marquis of Queensberry at 
the cost of L. 40,000. 

III. — Population. 

By the Census of 1821 the population amounted to - 1561 

1831, _ . - - 1407 

Males, - - - - 666 

Females, - - - - - - 741 

The decrease is partly owing to emigration, and partly to the 
enlargement of farms. The number of the population residing in 
villages is 351 ; of families of independent fortune, 3; of proprie- 
tors of land of the yearly value of L. 50 and upwards, 4 ; the num- 
ber of families in Cummertrees, 268 ; average number of children 
in each family, 4 ; number of inhabited houses, 238 ; number of 
insane persons, 4 ; of blind, 2 ; of deaf and dumb, 1. The num- 
ber of families employed in agriculture is 83 ; of families employ- 
epithet " iicer" given to that king in liisloi y ; while the countenance and bushy locks 
on the coins of Edward bear a strong resemblance to the portraits of that monarch.

Habits and Character of the People.- About fifty years ago cock- 
fiahting used to be a favourite amusement among the lower orders ; 
but that barbarous and brutalizing sport is now completely laid 
aside. The habits of the people in cleanhness have been miprov- 
ed much of late years; and the cottages, with the exception of 
those inhabited by Irish, are in general as neatly kept as the same 
style of houses are in England. 

The ordinary food of the peasantry for breakfast is oatmeal 
porridge, with milk, or with beer made from treacle ; but coffee 
and tea are daily becoming more general among all classes. At 
dinner, Scotch broth and potatoes are used, with butcher-meat, 
when it can be afforded, or, when this cannot be had, herrings or 
flounders. Oatmeal porridge is the standing dish for supper. In 
seasons of scarcity, the poorer classes have sometimes nothing but 
potatoes to keep them from starvation. The earnings of the la- 
bourers are usually very small, but, from their general sobriety and 
prudent and moral habits, they enjoy far more real comfort than 
those on the English side of the Frith with nearly double their 
wages. It is much to be regretted, however, that the demoraliz- 
ing habit of poaching in game has increased much of late years, 
nor can it be hoped that the habit will diminish so long as the law 
continues as it now is. It may be remarked, that many of the 
farmers, whose crops are injured by game, look on poaching not 
as a moral dehnquency, but as a mere disobedience to arbitrary 
statutes, which tends to the protection of their own crops. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy/. — About 6000 imperial acres 
are occasionally under tillage, and about 800 acres, chiefly moss, 
have never been cultivated, of which about 300 might be profitably 
brought into tillage. There is almost no ground in the parish 
that could be kept in permanent pasture ; and the same may be 
said of nearly two-thirds of all the land in the lower district of An- 
nandale, where the soil is so thin, sandy, and gravelly, that it 
would require top-dreesing every two years ; and where the soil is 
damp, it is a thin, mossy, and spongy substance, lying over a hard 
and dripping till, which, if not ploughed, in a few years becomes 
covered with rushes. About 1000 acres are under wood, chiefly 
planted, and the management of the plantations is in general good.

The Marquis of Queensberry sells annually about L. 600 worth 
of oak bark, and wood of different kinds. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of land in Cummertrees is 
under L. 1 Sterling per acre. The valued rental of the parish is 
3715 merks ; the real rental nearly L. 8000. The average rate 
of grazing a cow or full-grown ox is L.3, 10s. per head ; for full- 
grown sheep, 5s. per head. 

Rate of Wages. — Men as farm-labourers during the summer 
months have 2s. and Is. 6d. a-day ; for the winter months they 
have Is. 6d. and Is. per day. Females for out-door husbandry 
have Is. in summer, and lOd. per day in winter. Ploughmen en- 
gaged by the year have a free house, and in money and provisions 
to the amount of L. 20 Sterling per annum ; those who get their 
board and lodging in the farmer's houses receive about L. 12 per 
annum. Dairy maids about L. 6 per annum. Housekeepers about 
L. 8 per annum. Country artisans have 2s. 6d. or 3s. during sum- 
mer, and Is. 6d. or 2s. per day during winter. 

Breeds of Cattle. — The few sheep that are bred in the parish 
are generally a cross between the Cheviot and South-downs. The 
farmers in general consider it more advantageous to buy sheep for 
eating their turnip, than to rear them. Many of them let their 
turnips to graziers to be eaten by sheep upon the ground by the 
week at so much per head. When turnips are scarce, they let 
high, as 5d. or 6d. per sheep ; and when plentiful, as low as 2d. 
and 3d. per sheep. 

Husbandry. — The general duration of leases is nineteen years. 
Many of the farm-houses, and most of the inclosures in the parish, 
are in good condition. So great are the improvements in Cummer- 
trees within the last thirty years, that the appearance of the parish 
is entirely changed. Many hundred acres of land, which thirty years 
ago were lying open and waste, are now well enclosed with neat- 
ly kept hedge-rows, and either covered with thriving plantations, 
or regularly cultivated upon the most approved system of hus- 
bandry. 

Quarries and Fisheries. — There are two freestone quarries and 
one of limestone in the parish. The only fishery is stake-net fish- 
ery, rented at about L. 400 per annum. The poor people have li- 
berty to take white fish from 25th September to 10th March. 

Produce. — The gross amount of raw produce raised in Cum- 
mertrees, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows :

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Toion, c.— The nearest market and post-town is the 
borough of Annan, four miles distant from the parish church. 
There are three 'illages, viz, Cummertrees, Queensberry or Pow- 
foot, and Kelhead, near the Hme-works. The means of communi- 
cation enjoyed by the parish are excellent. The parish roads are 
kept in good repair, and it is intersected by upwards of twelve miles 
of turnpike roads. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The situation of the parish church since 
the chapelry of Trailtrow was annexed to Cummertrees is inconve- 
nient for the inhabitants in the northern boundaries of the parish, 
being upwards of five miles distant from some of the houses in that 
direction. The church was founded by Robert the Bruce. Be- 
fore the Reformation, it was in the diocese of the Bishop of Glas- 
gow. It has frequently been rebuilt and enlarged. At present it 
contains accommodation for about 450 sitters, and is in a good state 
of repair ; but it is much too small to hold the number entitled by 
act of Parliament to church accommodation. 

The manse was built about thirty years ago, but is very insuffi- 
ciently finished, and is smaller than the ordinary style of manses of 
the present day. The glebe is 24 Scotch acres in extent, and is 
worth about L. 28 Sterling per annum. The amount of stipend, 
including the Government allowance of L.37, 10s. 4gd., is L. 150, 
with the usual allowance for communion elements. The whole free 
teind of the parish at the time it was valued amounted only to six 
chalders, that is, four of meal, and two of barley ; but at that time a 
large portion of the parish was undivided common ; and some have 



254 



DUMFltlES-SHIRE. 



been so uncharitable as to say that the valuator took his report 
from a proprietor, without examining into the state of the parish. 

There are no dissenting or Episcopal chapels ; but there are in 
the parish 19 families of dissenters, and 2 of Episcopalians. 

The number of communicants in the Established church has 
increased 80 within these three years, yet in all, the average num- 
ber does not exceed 350. About 247 families attend church. 

Education. — The number of schools in the parish is three, one 
parochial, one endowed, and one unendowed. The branches taught 
in the parochial school, besides the ordinary ones, are navigation, 
geography, Latin, and Greek. And at the other two schools, read- 
ing, writing, and arithmetic. The parochial schoolmaster has L. 30 
of salary, with the usual allowance of house and garden and school- 
house, and about L. 30 of fees. The charge, per quarter, for Eng- 
hsh reading, is 2s. ; reading and writing, 2s. 6d. ; arithmetic, 3s. 6d. ; 
and Latin and Greek, 5s. All in the parish above eight years of 
age can read, and the number of those who cannot write does not 
exceed twenty- five. Education, within these thirty years, has pro- 
duced a very favourable change in the manners and habits of the 
people. It has enlarged their ideas, polished their address, and 
freed them from much prejudice and superstition. No ghosts, fai- 
ries, or brownies are to be heard of now. It is, however, much to 
be regretted that true Christian piety, from whatever causes, has 
rather retrograded than kept pace with the intellectual improve- 
ments of the community. 

There are three Sabbath-schools in the parish, one of which the 
minister superintends. The other two are in more remote parts of 
the parish. The number of children attending these amounts to 
about 220. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is 26, and the average sum allotted to each 
annually is about L. 3. Some individuals, who are incapable of 
doing any thing for themselves, receive as high as L. 8 per annum, 
payable quarterly. A part of the allowance is judiciously appro- 
priated by the heritors and kirk-session to the payment of house 
rent. The church collections amount to about L. 28 per annum, 
which is distributed quarterly by the heritors and kirk-session ; and 
when any farther, sum is required, the heritors voluntarily assess 
themselves to the amount, according to their rentals, — and it de- 
serves to be mentioned to their honour, that they have never been 
backward to grant additional relief to the poor of the parish when 



CUMMERTREES. 



255 



requested by the kirk-session. Among the native poor, that is, 
amono- those who have been born and brought up in the parish, 
therels still a very general and honourable pride, which renders 
them averse either to seek or accept of parochial rehef, and none 
of them complain of the smallness of the sums allotted. But among 
those who have come from distant parishes, and obtained settle- 
ments, the feehng against receiving parochial relief is neither so 
strong nor so general. The Irish, in general, use every method 
that cunning can devise to get a parish settlement. 

Inns and Alehoicses.— There are three inns and two alehouses 
within the parish, besides two on the very boundaries of the parish ; 
all licensed to sell ale and spirits, the effect of which is most per- 
nicious to the morals, the health, and comfort of the inhabitants. 

:PueI. — The fuel of the country people is mostly peats, and costs 
in cutting, winning, and leading home, about Is. 2d. per cart load; 
but excellent coals can be had from the opposite coast for about 
8s. per ton of 14 cwt. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

The improvements that have been made in Cummertrees since 
the publication of the last Statistical Account are extensive and 
varied. What was then peat-bog, the resort of the bittern and 
lapwing, is now laid out in beautiful green pastures, and surround- 
ed by thriving hedge-rows. There were then scarcely ten acres 
of wood in the parish, now there are upwards of a thousand. Then, 
most of the farm-houses were built with low mud walls, covered 
with straw, which had scarcely a frame of glass in their windows ; 
now, most of the farm-steadings are substantial stone and lime 
buildings, covered with flag or slate, and kept in a neat and com- 
fortable manner. The only great drawback upon future improve- 
ments, and a still greater return of yearly produce from the land, 
is the high rents of many of the farms, and a consequent yearly - 
diminution of capital among the farmers. Nothing could contri- 
bute more to the health and comfort of the labourinsf-classes in this 
parish, especially of those who reside in villages, than land where- 
on to keep a cow, and to grow a few potatoes. The digging of the 
field would occupy many hours that are spent in idleness, or in the 
public house, while their cows-milk, and their potatoes, would keep 
their family from want during the winter months, when little out- 
door work is to be had.

PRESBYTERY OF ANNAN, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. NICHOLAS SLOAN, MINISTER. 



L — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries 8fc, — The name of the parish is said, in the 
former Statistical Account, to be derived from the Celtic words Tor 
or Dor, signifying an oak or wood, and nock, a knowe or hill. But 
this derivation is questionable ; for of the venerable oak, there re- 
mains neither root nor branch, and of " hills" this parish cannot 
boast — the grounds being generally level. Dornock is situated in 
a neighbourhood proverbially beautiful in its scenery, and much fre- 
quented for its salubrious breezes, and for its sea-bathing. Its ex- 
tent from east to west is 2 miles, and from the Solway Frith to 
the river Kirtle, about 5 miles. It might have been nearly a square 
had not apiece of common ground, belonging to Kirkpatrick- Flem- 
ing, detached two properties in the north from the west of the 
parish. It is bounded by the parish of Annan on the west and 
north ; by Kirkpatrick- Fleming on the north-east; by Graitney on 
the east ; and by the Solway Frith on the south. When viewed 
from the north side of the village, the ground rises in a gentle accli- 
vity, forming a kind of semicircle, bounded by thriving plantations. 

Soil, Climate, Src. — The soil is generally fertile, and now, under 
the improved mode of culture, yields abundant crops. The climate 
is healthy, and the air of late years is said to be milder than for- 
merly. The most prevailing winds are from the south and south- 
west ; but often from the east, when they are generally chilly and 
piercing, not without rain. 

The parish is well supphed with perennial springs of water; one 
of which is in the glebe, as transparent and sparkling as crystal, 
pleasant to the taste, light, and much resorted to as giving relief in 
cases of colic ; its composition, however, has never been analyzed. 
No coal or lime have been found in the parish ; but it is not doubt- 
ed that, were a few enterprising individuals to make the trial, both 
might be had in abundnnce.

The extent of the parish along the coast is about three miles; and 
the shore is sandy and gravelly, mixed with cobbles or large stones. 
The flowing of the tide is extremely rapid, forcing its way with a 
rise of fouror five feet water a-breast, which renders it quite un- 
safe for strangers to cross the Frith at low water without a guide. 

11. — Civil History. 
Antiquities, Sx.—k battle is said to have been fought at 
Swordwell by the Scots and English, which ended in the defeat ot 
the latter. The date is unknown. There may be seen in the 
church-yard two stones of a singular shape, resting on blocks of 
the same materials, which are supposed to contain the ashes of the 
commanders of the Enghsh army. A variety of interestuig tomb- 
stones are to be found in the burial-ground ; in particular that of 
the last of the curates in this place, which has a Latin inscription 
in Sapphic verse, the first hne of which is taken, with a slight al- 
teration, from Hor. xxii. Ode of Lib. i.

The farmers in this parish are chiefly persons of considerable 
intelligence ; and on many subjects of general literature and 
science they converse with surprising readiness and accuracy. Per- 
severing and industrious, and adopting the most improved modes of 
agriculture, they cultivate their lands with taste, and in a regular 
rotation of crops ; and in nothing does the face of the country ap- 
pear more agreeably changed, than in the thriving hedge-rows and 
snug enclosures that in every direction meet the delighted eye.

Rent of Land. — The best arable land lets about L. 2 per acre, 
and inferior at 10s. Nearly one-third of the parish, for the last 
twenty years, has been let yearly on the ground, in lots for graz- 
ing, by public auction ; and some enclosures of superior grass, and 
well-watered, rise as high as L. 3 per acre for six months. The 
rental of the parish is L. 3300. 

Husbandry. — The number of ploughs kept in the parish, mostly 
iron, is 30 ; of horses kept for farmers' use, 70 ; of young horses 
reared, mostly all of the draught kind, 25 ; of carts employed by 
farmers and labourers, 70 ; of cows kept, about 200. The quantity 
of butter made from these cows may be 280 firkins at 43s. = L. 630. 
Cheese may be valued at L. 100. About 200 young cattle, chiefly 
of the Galloway kind, are raised yearly ; and 400 swine are fat- 
tened yearly at L. 3, 5s. each. 

Instead of the former clay cottages, the dwelling-houses and of- 
fices of the farmers are now almost all substantial buildings of stone 
and lime, covered with the best Lancashire slate. The greatest 
improvements are observable in making and keeping in repair the 
parish roads, and in the attention paid to draining the land, and 
fencing it in a husband-like manner, 

Produce. — Average amount and value of raw produce raised in 
the parish yearly, may be as follows : 

Grain of aU kinds, - L. 5250 0 0 

Potatoes and turnips, - - 1700 0 0 

Hay of all kinds, - - 2300 0 0 

Flax for the use of private families, - 30 0 0

Annual thinning of plantations, - 10 0 0 

Fisheries, sea, - - 150 0 0 

Total yearly value of raw produce, L. 11,450 0 0 

Navigation. — There are several merchant vessels employed in 
conveying goods to and from Liverpool, and a few ships of about 
300 tons burden per register, laden with timber from Miramichi 



DORNOCK.

or New Brunswick, which arrive here in the month of August, and 
which all lie off the mouth of the canal, on the opposite side of the 
•Frith, — an arm of the sea which separates this district from Cum- 
berland. 

Fishings. — In the Sol way, and in the rivers of the parish, there 
are fisheries in salmon, grilse, sea-trout, flounders, and herlings or 
whitings. The salmon is chiefly forwarded to the market at Carlisle, 
in Cumberland, a distance of fifteen miles. At the beginning of the 
season it is there sold as high as 2s. 3d. and at the end of it, from 
Is. to 6d. or 8d. per lib. The fishing is mostly carried on in the 
mode of trap or stake-nets, set from the shore in a line to the 
channel or lake, from a quarter of a mile to a mile in length, be- 
ginning at the shore with a net 4 feet high, and rising gradually 
till the net reaches 10 or 12 feet high, with an arm or rail at from 
60 to 100 yards separate. This rail or arm is about 40 yards in 
length, and is set sometimes for the flowing, at other times for 
the ebbing of the tide, so as to lead the fish into a corner where 
a trap or pocket is constructed with a little opening gradually de- 
clining, so that the salmon or other fish once entrapped seldom or 
never find the way out. The annual rent of the fishing in the pa- 
rish is about L. 150. There are from fifteen to twenty persons 
in the parish who make a living from pock-net or channel fishmg. 
The mode of heaving or hauling is now entirely laid aside. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication. — The turnpike road extends the whole 
length of the parish; it is part of the great thoroughfare from Port- 
patrick to Carlisle, Manchester, and London. The Carlisle mail to 
Portpatrick daily, and a heavy coach to Edinburgh and Glasgow 
thrice a week, pass and repass through the village. No improvements 
have been productive of more advantage in this vicinity than the esta- 
blishment of the steam packet called the Cumherland, and the open- 
mg of the Carhsle canal. There is a cut from the last mentioned city 
to Bowness, the ancient Blotumhulcjium of the Romans, a distance 
of eleven mdes. Lighters from the Carlisle basin are employed by 
the merchants to convey their goods from the steam-vessel to that 
city. The steamer which sails weekly to Liverpool is as regular 
m her arrivals and departures as any mail. This vessel carrfes to 
that port and other towns immense quantities of bacon hams 
sheep, and cattle, and goods of diff'erent descriptions, and lands 
them the day after her departure from the canal. On the 29th

DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



February 1832, there were put on board 500 sheep, 46 cows, and 
5 calves. Another steamer, called the Solway, has begun, more 
recently, to ply between Bowness and Liverpool. Both vessels 
■ are weekly in full employment, to the advantage of both Annan- 
dale and Galloway. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church was built in 1793; it has no 
gallery, but may accommodate nearly 300 sitters. The glebe, in- 
field and out-field for there are two contains 20 imperial acres, 
and may be worth L. 30 per annum. The stipend is 14 chalders, 
half barley, half oat-meal, with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion ele- 
ments. The manse was built in 1778, and has undergone during 
that time several repairs; the last of which was in 1828. It is 
still a good and convenient house, and has been well and judiciously 
planned. 

In this parish there are no dissenting chapels, but there are ten 
famiUes of dissenters who resort to the Secession church at Annan. 

The parish church, to the credit of the parishioners, is well and 
regularly attended by about 145 families ; and the number of com- 
municants is about 100. 

Sermons are occasionally preached, and collections made for Sab- 
bath schools and Bible societies, the average collection, after de- 
ducting the usual sum for the poor, being about L. 3, 10s. 

Education.— There is one parochial school with a salary of 
L. 34, 4s. 2d. The fees or school wages do not exceed L. 25 
yearly ; though they would doubtless amount to more were it not 
that there are two other schools without salary, where the quarter 
pence or wages are lower. The schoolmaster has other emolu- 
ments to the amount of L. 5 a-year. In the parish school, which 
is taught by a talented teacher, all the branches which are usually 
pursued in respectable seminaries are taught with persevering dili- 
gence and the strictest accuracy. The master has the legal ac- 
commodation, a good house, and a field of nearly an imperial acre, 
part of which is set apart for a garden. The average number of 
scholars in the parochial school is 50. There are two other 
schools, viz. the village school, attended by 40 scholars, and the 

■north school by 20. i • i • i 

Library.— K subscription library was established in the parish 

in the year 1830, and contains now about 100 volumes, some of 

which were presented by members of the committee of management.

brought hither by wherries or small vessels from Whitehaven and 
Workincton, and with excellent lime from Kelhead the property 
of the Marquis of Queensberry, a distance of six miles. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The intelligence and moral improvement of the population of 
the parish, their increasing thirst for knowledge, and their ardent 
desire for the proper education and instruction of their children, 
are particularly worthy of remark. In particular, the morals of the 
people have been greatly improved by the cessation of smuggling, 
which, about the beginning of the last century, was carried on to 
a great extent,— the Isle of Man affording an easy opportunity for 
the conveyance of contraband goods, chiefly brandy and tea. 

The general appearance of the parish, as it respects the improve- 
ments made in its enclosures and hedges, also merits special atten- 
tion. An old parishioner informed the present incumbent that, 
eighty or ninety years ago, not a hedge was to be seen in the whole 
district. Now the fields are duly enclosed, and hedges and hedge- 
rows are everywhere seen, which beautify and adorn the fields and 
pastures. Extraordinary advantages have also been derived from 
the opening of the canal, and from the great improvement of the 
parish roads.

PRESBYTERY OF ANNAN, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. JAMES RODDICK, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History.  
Name, Boundaries, -c.— Some suppose the name of the parish 
to be derived from the Anglo-Saxon words signifying the Great 
Hollow,— others from Great Knowe in the Scottish dialect, having 
reference to a hill within its bounds of considerable altitude. The 
parish extends six miles in length, and three in breadth, and con- 
tains eighteen square miles; the figure is rectangular, and almost 
rectilineous. It is bounded on the east by England, on the south 
by the Solway Frith, on the west by the parish of Dornock, and 
on the north by Kirkpatrick- Fleming and Half- Morton; towards 
the west and south its surface is generally level, but towards the 
east and north it rises into a variety of little hills of gentle accli- 
vity, of which Graitney, the highest, does not exceed 250 feet above 
the level of the sea. From this, however, the prospect is extremely 
pleasant and extensive, commanding the rich and beautiful vales of 
Esk and Eden, the Solway Frith, and the coast of Cumberland as 
far as the Isle of Man, and St Bees westward, and the mountains 
of Dumfries-shire and Northumberland. 

Topographical Appearances.— The whole length of this parish 
is washed by the Solway, the shore of which is but httle elevated, 
and consists of a mixture of sand and clay. Rockcliff sands, out- 
spread between the rivers on the Scotch and English shores, are 
extensive. There are no bays of any note on the coast, except, 
perhaps, that opposite Browhouses, formed by the principal head- 
lands, Redkirk and Tordoff points, which last is rather of a bold 
character, — and, together with Bowness on the opposite shore, con- 
fines the impetuous tide within the narrow space of two miles. 
Then the channel rapidly expands, is divided, and follows the cours- 
es of the two rivers Esk and Eden, — thus presenting the semblance 
of a fine lake of about 40 miles in circumference. At no great dis- 



GRAITNEY. 



263 



tance from the junction of the two rivers, and near the extremity 
of the Frith, a large tract of marsh land of a Hvely green has been 
formed, and is daily increasing, from the encroachment of the wa- 
ters on the opposite shores. The tide of the Solway flows directly 
east with amazing rapidity. Its colour is whitish, caused by its flow- 
ino- over an immense expanse of sand. Indeed, from the point of 
Criffel, where the Nith joins the main channel, a space not less 
than forty miles in length, and eight, at an average, in breadth, the 
tides completely recede, and leave their channels bare,— a circum- 
stance which obviously renders navigation difficult, nay, almost im- 
practicable, to strangers. 

Meteorology.— The atmosphere is dry, the chmate peculiarly 
warm and healthy; rain, though sometimes violent, falls not so fre- 
quently as in the more elevated parts of the country around. Like 
the winds, it proceeds chiefly from the south-west, except in the 
months of March and April, when cold eastern blasts prevail. 
When the clouds are driven heavily from the south, when the west 
appears dark and lowering, or when the western rivers and approach- 
ing tide are distinctly heard, rain may be confidently expected. A 
yellowish sky in the south-east also generally betokens a wet day ; 
and Carlisle being situated in that direction, there is a common 
proverb, which runs, " The Carle sky keeps not the head dry;" 
when, on the contrary, there is a small space cloudless in the north- 
ern horizon, or when the clouds are moving to the south, the hus- 
bandman confides in the expectation of fair weather. 

Hydrography. — There are several excellent perennial springs in 
this parish, which rise through sandstone rocks, or beds of sand of 
a reddish colour abounding in the greater part of the lower dis- 
trict of Annandale. Sark, a small stream, separates Graitney from 
the parish of TK.irkandrews in England; and the Kirtle, another 
small and romantic river, divides it into two nearly equal portions. 
They both rise from the hills in the neighbourhood of Langholm, 
and pursue a rapid southern course of about twenty miles, till they 
are united to the Esk and Eden. The Kirtle flows over a bed of sand- 
stone nearly horizontal. This rock is also found along the whole 
shore, sometimes in detached masses, and sometimes in layers, va- 
rying from 2 to 12 inches. 

Soil. — The soil on the sea-coast is of a rich loamy nature, spread 
upon a deep strong clay above sandstone, and appears in many 
places to have been deposited by the tides, which have evidently 
risen much higher at a former period. As the ground recedes 



214 



DUMFllIES-SHIllE. 



from the shore, and becomes more unequal in its surface, the soil 
also varies, and partakes more of a gravelly and clayey substance, 
resting upon hills of sand of great dimensions. 

Peat-moss is found in several detached portions, in which the 
remains of oak trees of considerable growth are deposited. In 
one or two of them were discovered also several coins of silver, on 
which can be deciphered Canterbury and London, but no date, 
though they apparently belonged to the reign of one of the Edwards. 

Fisheries, Sj-c. — There are excellent salmon fisheries on the 
coast, and sturgeon, cod, and herrings, are caught occasionally, 
though none of them, perhaps, in such abundance as formerly. 
Salmon ascend the rivers for spawning in the beginning of Octo- 
ber, and return again early in March. 

In this parish there are no woods of large extent, though its 
eastern division has the appearance of one continued forest, from 
the circumstance, that the hedge-rows, which are kept in good or- 
der, are thickly interspersed with ash, oak, and plane trees; among 
these the ash is predominant, and seems most congenial to the soil. 
Laburnum is also common, and thrives well. There are many trees 
of considerable age and size near the church and manse, and many 
small plantations in places very tastefully selected, which give the 
scene a sylvan appearance, and contribute much to the warmth of 
the climate and the fertility of the soil. 

II. — Civil History. 

Historical Notices. — Situated on the frontier of Scotland, this 
parish was undoubtedly the scene of many battles, and many a bor- 
der feud and foray. The debateable lands, lying between the rivers 
Sark and Esk, now forming the parish of Kirkandrews, were of 
course for many ages considered common to England and Scotland, 
and so long as these remained separate kingdoms, gave birth, as 
might be expected, to prodigious disorders. These lands extended 
eight miles in length and four in breadth, and were long possessed 
by a race who acknowledged the laws of neither country. With a 
view to remedy these evils, in the year 1552, a partition was agreed 
upon by the sovereigns of the respective domains, and the Scotch 
dike, a line of plantation drawn between the two rivers, was thence- 
forward to be the boundary ; the eastern division to belong to Scot- 
land, the western" to England, such being the inclinations of the 
inhabitants. The habits of the people, however, continued nearly 
the same till the union of the kingdoms under James VL, when 



GRAITNEY.

vigorous measures were resorted to, and many of them were dis-- 
persed over the country, or transported into Ireland. Since that 
happy consummation, the inhabitants of the whole surroundmg dis- 
trict, laying aside their mutual jealousies and hostility, have gra- 
dually advanced to a degree of civihzation,— and the lands once 
desolate, though naturally fertile, to a state of cultivation,— far 
superior to many of the more central parts of the island. It must 
be confessed, however, that the progress of the people towards 
this amelioration was gradual, and, in its early stages, exceed- 
ingly slow. About fifty years ago the occupations of rural life were 
but little attended to. The tales of the exploits of their forefa- 
thers, and the scenes of so much rapine and bloodshed, tended to 
keep alive, and to cherish a restless and wayward spirit, which 
reluctantly yielded to the restraints of law, and settled down into 
the condition of the farmer and the artisan. Game was abund- 
ant, and the Isle of Man, under a separate jurisdiction, held out 
strong temptations to illicit traffic. Their hands were devoted to 
the unprofitable amusements of the field, or to the pernicious prac- 
tice of smuggling. Their families and farms were matters of but 
secondary consideration, and, it must be admitted, that, with mul- 
titudes in the adjacent parishes, a hfe of predatory warfare was on- 
ly exchanged, for a considerable period, for that of vicious idleness, 
and a sort of lawless independence. Daring bands of smugglers 
continued to infest the border. Tea, tobacco, brandy, and gin, 
were the chief articles of their contraband trade, which they landed 
in every creek along the coast, whence their ready friends convey- 
ed them with horses to places of safety. These were found for 
the most part deep sunk beneath the kitchen floor, or some of the 
office-houses, or amid wastes of furze, or sometimes, when the 
men were hard pressed by officers of excise, even in ditches or 
morasses. These circumstances are still fresh in the memories of 
many, and some individuals are yet alive who took part in transac- 
tions resembling, in their extent at least, the systematic establish- 
ments of regular commerce. During the last forty years, however, 
the improvement has been great. The land-owners of the parish, 
Lord Mansfield, Sir Patrick Maxwell, Bart., Colonels Maxwell 
and Graham, have given great encouragement to the industry of 
the farmers ; and farm-houses have been erected, and the fields 
inclosed in a manner that reflects much credit upon proprietors 
and tenants. 

Antiquities. — The sites of several towers are still discernible in the

parish ; they were generally of a square form, and were intended for 
defence in feudal times. Their walls were of an immense thick- 
ness, their doors of massy iron. The interior consisted usually of 
often a ground floor, which contributed to the safety of their cattle, 
and of two or more upper apartments, with narrow apertures ex- 
ternally for windows, but rapidly enlarging towards the inside, that 
the inmates, perhaps, might be the better able to annoy the enemy. 
The most remarkable stood near Stonehouse, on the banks of the 
Kirtle, at Old Graitney, at Westhill, and at Hirst ; but the names 
and the deeds of the chieftains whom they sheltered are forgotten 
and unknown. 

From an inscription in the church-yard, it appears that a near 
relation of Sir William Wallace is buried there ; and the ashes of 
many of the Johnstones of Annandale are said to repose within 
the precincts of the ancient church. The form of some, and the 
sculpture on others, of the tombstones, appear to indicate their 
great antiquity ; while many epitaphs, and particularly one, of two 
brothers, who died at the advanced ages of 110 and 111, point out 
the longevity of the parishioners. 

At Redkirk Point, near the farm of that name, once stood the 
church of Redpatrick or Redkirk, which, like most others in this 
vicinity, anciently belonged to the see of Glasgow. Of that church 
or church-yard not a vestige now remains. The tide and river whirl- 
ing violently round that headland have swept them entirelyaway ; but 
some old people yet remember the unwelcome sight of bones and 
coffins protruding from the banks, or collected from the beach in- 
to a trough, which had been used as a font in the days of popery. 
A camp of a round shape is still distinctly visible near Barrasgate. 
A square camp of large dimensions may also be easily traced on 
the farm of Raeburnfoot. Camp-house, on the Glasgow road, which 
is supposed to pursue the track of the old Roman one leading to 
Middlebie and Birrenswark, in all likelihood indicates the site of 
one of a sti'ong chain of fortifications erected by that ambitious 
and enterprising people. 

On the farm of Old Graitney, and at no great distance from 

 The two parishes were united in 1609, and there is still a Bible in the old Eng- 
lish character in the jjossession of John Graham, Springfield, which bears on its mar- 
gin that it was presented to the church of Graitney in 1611, only two years subse- 
quent to the union, by Viscount Stormont, the ancestor of the Earl of Mansfield. 
The print is beautiful, but the leaves are much mutilated, and many books, both of the 
Old and New Testaments, have been lost.

the confluence of the Kirtle and the Solway, was seen not many 
years ago a number of white stones placed upright, and inclosing 
half an acre of ground, in an oval form. One of them, the larg- 
est, is all that now remains, as some suppose, of a Druidical tem- 
ple, the rest having been removed for the cultivation of the soil. 
This has obtained the name of the Lochmaben Stone ; it measures 
8 feet in height and 21 in circumference, and must have been 
brought from a considerable distance. Its appearance resembles 
granite, but, with the exception of a very hard incrustation where 
it is exposed to the external air, it is of a much softer and gravel- 
ly composition. Alliances between the two kingdoms are said to 
have been formed in ancient days within the limits of this temple. 

Eminent Men. — Mr Gait, who was minister of Graitney for 
sixty years, seems to have been a man of primitive piety and sim- 
plicity of manners, and his memory is still delightfully cherished 
by the aged inhabitants. He was also a man of superior classical 
attainments, as certain manuscripts, particularly the book of Job 
in Latin verse, and a diary, minutely kept, in prose, now in the hands 
of the Misses Gibson, Edinburgh, amply testify. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers of baptisms, mar- 
riages, and transactions of the kirk-session, among which last are 
interspersed many remarkable occurrences, such as the advance and 
retreat of a division of the rebels in 1745, stories, and tales of 
wonder, are extremely accurately written by Mr Gait, and are pretty 
voluminous. They commence in 1 730, and continue for sixty years, 
after which there is an almost entire deficiency in the minutes of 
session. 

III. — Population. 

Since the year 1755, when Dr Webster made a census, the popu- 
lation has been nearly doubled ; and since the period of last Statis- 
tical Account it has exactly 99 of an increase. It now amounts 
to 1909. The increase is chiefly to be attributedto the encourage- 
ment given to manufacturers during the late war, and the facility 
aff'orded to the building of cottages by landholders, particularly by 
Sir John Heron Maxwell in the village of Springfield, which, though 
commenced only in 1791, contains now about 500 inhabitants, al- 
most entirely cotton-weavers.

There are no resident nobility in the parish, but several very ex- 
tensive farmers. Of these one pays L. 1000 per annum, and many 
about L. 500. 

A curious mode of killing salmon once was practised by the in- 
habitants of this parish. Bands of horsemen, armed with long 
spears, assailed the finny race. One man in particular, called 
Graham, arrived at such an amazing degree of dexterity in the 
sport, as to be able at full gallop to transfix the prey, and call forth 
the wonder of his associates. Sir Walter Scott in his tale of Red- 
gauntlet has recorded such a scene.

parish is L. 9000. The usual rate of grazing is L. 3, 10s. per ox 
or cow, and 15s. per ewe for the year. 

Rate of Wages. — Men-servants' wages half-yearly, L.6, 6s.; maid 
do. L. 2, 15s.; day laboui-ers. Is. 6d. ; masons, 3s.; joiners, 2s. 6d. 

Prices. — Wheat sells at the average rate of 7s. 6d. per imperial 
bushel; barley, 4s.; oats, 3s.; meal, Is. lOd. per imperial stone; 
beef, 5d. per lb.; mutton, 5d.; pork,42d.; butter, lOd.; cheese, 5d. 

Husbandry and Produce. — A rotation of five years, viz. oats, green 
crop or fallow, wheat or barley, grass and pasture, is the com- 
monly adopted method of husbandry. The general duration of 
leases is fifteen years, — a term which seems very favourable both 
for tenants and proprietors. 

During the late war very considerable alterations took place in 
regard to the size of the farms and the state of enclosures. Where 
100 farmers occupied land, not more, now, than half the number 
fill their places ; by which means certainly, the general aspect and 
fertility of the district have been much improved ; but the system 
has had the necessary effects of forcing many families into cot- 
tages, to seek employment in manufactures, or to find their usual 
occupations in a foreign land. 

Produce. — The average gross amount and value of raw produce,, 
raised yearly in the parish, is nearly as follows :

Manufactures.— The manufacturers in this parish are chiefly 
cotton weavers employed by Messrs Dickson and Fergusson of Car- 
hsle. The yarn is brought regularly every fortnight, and distri- 
buted to about 120 famihes, or 600 persons, men, women, and child- 
ren, who all work at the looms, six days a-week and twelve or 
fourteen hours each day ; by which they usually are able to earn 
7s. or 8s. per week, instead of their former high wages of L. 1, 10s. 
By diligent labour and punctual payments, they are thus barely 
able to support their famihes by a mode of subsistence which ap- 
pears to have a tendency to weaken the body, to depress the mental 
powers, and engender a spirit of improvidence and disaffection. 

Navigation. — Vessels of 100 tons burden arrive at various places 
along the coast from the pits in Cumberland, and discharge coals 
to the yearly amount of 600 tons, together with an equal quantity 
of slate; and grain and potatoes are exported to a very large 
amount, chiefly to Liverpool and the other places on the coast of 
Lancashire. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

In the village of Gretna, which was a burgh of barony, there for- 
merly was a cattle-market, and it is not many years since the market- 
cross was thrown down. Annan is the nearest of the Scotch towns 
to this parish. Carlisle, nine miles distant, is an excellent market 
for grain, and for produce of all kinds, and much resorted to week- 
ly by the inhabitants, especially of the eastern part. There are 



270 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



four villages in the parish of considerable magnitude, Springfield, 
Gretna, Rigg and Browhouses. 

Means of Communication. — The highways between Glasgow 
and Carlisle, and between the latter place and Portpatrick, run 
through the parish, the latter intersecting its whole length. The 
oldroadtoCarhsle, which is still the nearest to Longtown, Brampton, 
and Newcastle, crosses the Glasgow road at the village of Gretna, 
where there is a post-office, which, however, is connected only with 
Carlisle. This renders correspondence from Scotland more ex- 
pensive and tedious than it ought to be. The roads, both public 
and parochial, are kept in the best order. There are three brid- 
ges, one over the Kirtle, and two over the Sark, which were recently 
and very substantially built. There are no regular harbours, though 
vessels of 120 tons arrive occasionally at Sarkfoot, Port-Stormont, 
Redkirk point, and Browhouses, for the purposes of exporting 
grain and potatoes to the coast of Lancashire, and of importing 
slate and coals from the coast of Cumberland. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church having been continued at 
Graitney when the parish of Red- Kirk was united to it, is thus 
rather inconveniently situated for the parishioners in the west, who 
are five miles distant. It was built in 1790, has excellent walls, 
roof, seats, and galleries, but still requires flooring of wood or stone 
and an enclosure. It affords accommodation for 1000 sitters, and, as in 
other country parishes, the accommodation is free. The manse was 
built 126 years ago, and underwent some repairs when the church 
was built. It has lately undergone a thorough repair, and been 
enlarged by an addition of two excellent rooms. The glebe con- 
sists of 13 Scotch acres; amounting in value to nearly L. 18 per 
annum. The stipend is 16 chalders, one-half barley, the other 
meal, payable at the rate of the county fiars, and varies from L. 200 
to L. 300 a-year. 

There is one meeting-house erected at Rigg by members of the 
Associate Synod. 

The people are not very remarkable for their regular attendance 
at church ; on an average there are 400 communicants. The 
church collections amount to L. 30 a-ycar, and L. 15 more may 
be received for other religious and charitable objects. 

Education. — There are two schools with equal salaries of L. 25 
attached to them, — both commodiously situated. A new school and 
dwelling-house for the schoolmaster has been lately erected at 
Gretna village, and may be regarded as a pledge of the future li- 



GRAITNEY. 



271 



berality of the heritors. There is much need of the extension of 
a similar favour to the western district of the parish. There are 
also three private seminaries, the teachers of which are solely de- 
pendent upon the number of their scholars ; altogether, 250 child- 
ren may be taught in these schools. There is also a Sabbath 
school, attended by about 140 scholars, which is maintained chief- 
ly by donations from the heritors. The Earl of Mansfield, the pa- 
tron of the parish, contributes L. 5 a-year, and the other heritors 
an equal sum to this institution, which is generally allowed to 
have been productive of the happiest effects, in the moral and re- 
ligious improvement of the rising generation. 

Charitable Institutions, §-c.— There is a friendly society in this 
parish, the object of which is to provide for the support of those 
who, by sickness or old age, are rendered incapable of earning a 
livelihood. It was instituted nearly fifty years ago, and is chiefly 
composed of labourers and mechanics, though others encourage 
it by their contributions. Each member contributes a small sum 
quarterly, which has gradually accumulated to a very large 
amount. 

Poor. — The poor are maintained by church collections and the 
voluntary contributions of the heritors, who meet with the minister 
every half year to inspect the roll. The average number of those 
who receive parochial relief is 30. They are of two classes, which 
contain nearly equal numbers; the occasional poor, who are sup- 
plied from the church funds quarterly ; and the regular paupers, main- 
tained chiefly by the contributions of the heritors, which are strictly 
regulated according to the respective valuations of their estates. 
The average sum of L. 80 per annum is thus conferred, but it varies 
according to the number and necessities of the applicants for re- 
lief. The generality of the people regard such means of support 
as no degradation, and feel much inclined to force the heritors to 
a legal assessment, which can only be prevented by the firmness 
of the kirk-session, the unity of the heritors, and by their regula- 
rity in meeting and contributing according to the real wants of the 
poor. These feelings on the part of the people are mainly to be at- 
tributed to the practice of our English neighbours, whose stand- 
ard of independence has been sadly lowered by the operation, or 
rather by the abuse, of poor rates. 

Inns. — Four of the inns in this parish may justly be regarded 
as useful for the refreshment of travellers passing through the pa- 
rish ; in particular, that of Gretna-hall, wliich is the largest and 
most commodious, and where jiost horses, chaises, and every other 



272 



DUMFRIES-SIIIRE. 



accommodation may be had. But there are twelve or thirteen 
other houses licensed to sell ale and spirits, which have a manifest 
tendency to demoralize the people. 

Fuel. — Peat from the Solway moss, or the borders of Kirkpatrick- 
Fleming, is commonly used as fuel ; though coal is also obtained in 
considerable abundance from the coast of Cumberland, and from 
the neighbourhood of Brampton and Canobie. Peat costs Is. 6d. 
per cart load ; coal, when brought from a distance by sea, costs 8s. 
per cart load, and when conveyed by land about 2s. less. A rail- 
road between Annan and Brampton, or between the former town 
and Carlisle, would be of great service to the whole neighbour- 
hood, and a more level tract for that purpose cannot perhaps be 
found in the kingdom. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

The most remarkable variations between the present state of this 
parish and that which existed at the date of the late Statistical Ac- 
count are, an increase of population to the number of 99 ; an im- 
mense enlargement of the farms, whose value has been more than 
doubled ; a great increase in manufactures ; a diminution of houses 
in country places, and a rapid extension of villages; a departure from 
a pretty general spirit of resistance to the revenue laws, and the 
signs of a growing amehoration in religion and morahty. Till 
within these last four years cock-fights were very common, with all 
their vile accompaniments, and more particularly at the village of 
Rigg. Thirty years ago, the contraband trade with the Isle of 
Man, with all its terrific results, prevailed. But if smuggling now 
exists at all, it is chiefly to be attributed to the wretched system 
which estabhshes an inequality of excise duties betwixt the differ- 
ent parts of the same kingdom. 

Instead of one school with a salary of L. 20, there are two hav- 
ing each a salary of L.25 a year, besides the usual wages, which 
may amount to an equal sum, payable by the scholars. Prices of 
labour and raw produce of every description have undergone a pro- 
portionable alteration. 

For the improvement of the parish in a commercial and agricul- 
tural point of view, the formation of a rail-road to join that between 
Carlisle and Newcastle, and the award of prizes to the best ma- 
nagers of farms, and to those who pay greatest attention to the 
breed of cattle, may be suggested. For the general welfare of its 
inhabitants in a moral and religious state, the diminution of licensed 
tiipling-liuses, and the abolition of irregular marriages, may be 



GRAITNEY. 273 



Strongly urged. The far-famed marriages of Gretna Green are 
celebratedAt is said, to the number of three or four hundred an- 
nually. The parties are chiefly from the sister kingdom, and from 
the lowest ranks of her population. The existence of the law by 
which the practice has been generated is certainly a reproach to 
our country, whether marriage be viewed as a civil or as a sacred 
contract. It dispenses with that solemnity which is required for the 
ordinance in Scripture; and it presents opportunities for bigamy and 
abduction. Parties have been known to betake themselves hither, 
from the north of Scotland itself, to celebrate a marriage which, 
a few lines written by a magistrate, a lawyer, a shoemaker, or a 
sexton, and signed by two witnesses at home, might have effected 
equally well, according to the present law of Scotland. Scarcely 
one instance in two years occurs of a couple belonging to the pa- 
rish being thus unlawfully united; and, when cases of the kind did 
occur a few years ago, the parties generally went to a neighbouring 
justice of the peace. Great numbers resort to these altars of Baal, 
whose priests are numerous in this district and others, more parti- 
cularly about Annan and Coldstream. Their number, indeed, has 
sadly injured the trade, for the fees are now only half-a-crown 
a-pair. One of these functionaries, who breaks stones daily on 
the verge of England, has the best chance of succeeding, for he 
accosts every party as they pass, and tries to strike the best bargain. 
Tippling-houses have each their rival priest, some of whom satisfy 
the parties by merely giving lines signed by witnesses, and others 
by jabbering over a portion of the service of the church of England. 

Wherever such irregularities are practised, they are calculated 
to bring all law and all religion into contempt and ridicule. The 
evil can only be remedied by an amendment of the law ; making 
proclamation of banns necessary to a valid marriage throughout 
the united kingdom; and surely, were the General Assembly of 
our church to send up a petition to Parliament on this subject, 
such pernicious practices would be prohibited by legislative enact- 
ment.

PRESBYTERY OF ANNAN, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER MONILAWS, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, 8fc. — The parish of Kirkpatrick- Fleming 
includes the old parishes of Kirkpatrick and Kirkconnel, which 
were united after the Reformation. It evidently derives its name 
from St Patrick, who was claimed by Scotchmen as their country- 
man, but honoured by Irishmen as their tutelary saint. The name 
of the lord of the manor, Fleming, during, the fourteenth and fif- 
teenth centuries, was added to the name of the present parish, to 
distinguish it from others of the same name. It extends from north 
to south about six miles, by a general breadth of three miles, and 
therefore contains eighteen square miles. Its figure, which is ex- 
tremely irregular, especially towards the west and south corners, 
may be said to resemble a parallelogram, or a rhomboid. The pa- 
rish is bounded on the east and north-east by Halfmorton, on the 
south-east and south by Graitney, on the west and south-west by 
Annan andDornock, and on the north and north-west by Middlebie. 

Topographical Appearances.— Its surface, which rises gradually 
from south to north to a moderate height above the level of the 
Solway, is diversified with a pleasing variety of waving elevations 
and fertile vales ; and adorned by many a well cultivated field, sur- 
rounded and sheltered either by fine hedge-rows or thriving plan- 
tations. Three divisions, running from the north-west and south- 
west in an easterly direction, are distinctly marked. The south 
division is separated from the middle one by the romantic vale of 
the Kirtle; and the middle division is separated from the northern 
one by a vale, which commences at Burnfoot, near Springkell, and 
runs along the banks of Logan-burn. In these divisions, there are 
some points of view looking west, south, and east, which afford most 
extensive and beautiful prospects. 

• This Account has been drawn up by the Rev. Tliomas Landells. 



KIRKPATRICK-FLEMING. 



Meteorology.— The temperature of the atmosphere in general, 
and in some particular seasons, is remarkably mild. The thermo- 
meter ranges from about 28° in winter to 76° in summer on Fahren- 
heit's scale. In different seasons, it has been found to stand above 
80°. The rains which prevail most, are towards the beginning of 
August and the end of September; they are well known by the 
names of the Lammas and equinoctial rains. Frequent and strong 
gusts of wind, accompanied with heavy rains from the west and 
south, are often experienced. In the winter months, too, continued 
and heavy rains frequently fall. But the rain which falls in this 
quarter is vastly different from the cold rains and hoar-fogs to which 
the eastern coasts are exposed. The winds that prevail in summer 
and harvest are from the west and south, and in winter and spring 
from the east and north. It has long been observed here, that 
when the heavy and extensive clouds, which sometimes rest upon 
the summit of Skiddaw, to the south of this parish, are borne on 
the wind, and carried northwards; and when the clouds, which often 
encircle the top of Criffel, which lies westward in East Galloway, 
are driven towards the land, rain soon follows. Hence the old 
rhyme. 

When the mist takes the sea 
Fair weather it will be ; 
But when the mist takes the land 
We expect rain off the sand. 

Snow, of which there are seldom heavy falls, does not lie long. 
Though the climate is variable and uncertain, yet it cannot justly 
be said to be unpropitious either to plants or animals. Many per- 
sons are grievously afflicted with rheumatism in the spring, and to- 
wards the end of autumn. But as the country around this is level 
and open, and rarely infested with fogs, the air, upon the whole, is 
pure ; and as it lies at a short distance from the Solway Frith, a 
considerable portion of it is low and warm. The farmers generally 
begin to sow about the middle of March, and to reap towards the 
middle of August. Epidemic diseases and malignant fevers seldom 
make their appearance. 

Hydrography. — This parish is abundantly supplied with peren- 
nial springs of the purest water, which is generally of a soft quality. 
These springs flow from sandstone, in some places of a dark red, 
in other places of a gray colour, and occasionally from limestone ; 
or they issue from gravel-beds or fissured rocks. About a quarter 
of a mile from the mansion-house of Springkell, there is a very re- 



270 



DUMFRIES-RHIUK. 



markable spring, which Mr Pennant, in 1772, said was the largest 
that he had ever seen, except the famous spring at Holywell, in 
Plintshire. Near the Gair farmstead, which is built on a ridge 
considerably elevated above the level of Springkell House, and near 
to limestone rock, several streams which issue from springs are ob- 
served to sink into the ground, and entirely disappear from the 
view. It is generally believed that these streams, during their pas- 
sage through subterraneous fissures, become united, and burst vio- 
lently out in one large stream in the present garden of Springkell. 
There are four mineral springs in this parish, of which three are 
nearly of the same nature and qualities. The first, distinguished 
by the name of the Branteth Well, is situated in the north-east 
part of the parish, in a moss of considerable extent. Its waters 
having at different times been subjected to a chemical analysis, were 
found to be strongly impregnated with sulphur. Its smell is most 
offensive, and its taste disagreeable. It is used with great success 
in scrofulous and scorbutic cases. The late Sir Humphry Davy 
stated some years ago that it was very similar to the Moffat Well. 
The other three mineral springs are all of the chalybeate kind, and 
do not differ materially from each other. 

The Highmoor Well, in all probability impregnated with a sub- 
stance not possessed by the others, has often been used with advan- 
tage in bilious and other stomachic complaints. The second of this 
kind, distinguished by the name of Charley's Well, upon the farm 
of Goukhall; and the third by that of Wyesbie-hill Well, — are ex- 
actly of the same nature and qualities, and are said to possess all 
the power and medicinal virtues of the famous Hartfell Spa near 
Moffat.  

Kirtle is the only river in this parish. It has its source in a val- 
ley, which is formed by Winterhope-hill on the one side, and the 
farm of Kirtlehead on the other, in the parish of Middlebie ; and 
running towards the north corner of Kirpatrick- Fleming, divides 
the two parishes for a space of more than four miles, and, then 
crossing the parish in a south-east direction, falls into the Solway 
to the east of Redkirk, in Graitney. Its length is about 18 miles ; 
its breadth at a medium, where it divides this parish from Middle- 
bie, above 23, and after that 30 feet. In it there are trouts, eels, 
and perch. 

In the south of Scotland it would be difficult to find another 
river of equal size to the Kirtle, which has its banks more richly

covered with natural wood, or more highly ornamented with plan- 
tations, gentlemen's family seats, and ancient towers. 

Geology and Miner alogy.-TU part of the country is of second- 
ary formation. « It consists of dark-red, brown, yellow, and, m 
some places, of gray or white sandstone, in some parts dippmg to 
the south, and in other parts to the west, disposed in thick strata, 
and frequently containing vegetable impressions. A great quan- 
tity of limestone, dipping to the west, ranges through this district 
from east to west. It is covered by, and alternates with, sand- 
stone, and contains a variety of shells." In the limestone quar- 
ries of Caldronlee, casts of bivalve shells and other organic re- 
mains of various forms are often found. Some of these strongly 
resemble the shape of a ram's horn. The cover of the rocks 
is almost always of the old alluvial kind, composed of clay, sand, 
and small water-worn stones, with angular pieces of the red sand- 
stone, upon which it generally rests. Its common colour is red, 
or inclining to red. In this parish there are some flow-mosses of 
considerable depth and extent. Out of these mosses many large 
trunks of trees, chiefly oaks, have repeatedly been dug. 

The soil in the under part of the parish being underlaid with rock, 
with gravel, or with sand, is generally light and kindly. In many 
parts it consists of a strong red earth, with a large mixture of sand, 
to a considerable depth. When this lies upon a gravelly bottom, 
as is generally the case along the side of the river, it is reckoned 
land of the first quality, A soil nearly the same, but more shal- 
low, is frequently to be met with upon a bottom inclining to clay 
and gravel. The same kind of earth, with a very small mixture 
of sand, frequently makes its appearance upon a strong brick-clay 
bottom, exceedingly cold, and almost impenetrable by water. 
Nearly two-thirds of the land of this parish consist of moss, varying 
in depth from six to eighteen inches, resting upon a bed of clay. 
As a subsoil, clay is found below the green sward of ridges, and 
under peat-mosses, and soft bogs, and is generally either white, 
blue, or red. 

There is also found a small portion of whitestone Innd, which 
is well-known in this district as a soil naturally barren, though ca- 
pable of improvement in various degrees. 

Many trials have been made near Springkell to discover coal, 
but they have hitherto proved unsuccessful. Mr Robert Bald, min- 
ing-engineer, Edinburgh, in a report which he gave in 1829, re- 
garding the minerals on the estate of Springkell, observes towards 



278 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



the end of it, " I cannot take uporKme to say that no workable coal 
will be found on the Springkell estate, next to Chapel-hill, but, 
from my experience, and comparing the strata at Springkell with 
those of the coal districts of Scotland, I have little or no hope of 
a workable coal being found there." 

Trees.— The soil, particularly along the banks of the river, is con- 
genial to oak, ash, plane, beech, elm, alder, birch, to Scots fir, larches, 
and various species of ornamental trees. Near the mansion-house 
of Springkell, there are different trees above 150 years of age, 
which measure from 9 to 11 feet in circumference, taken at 3 feet 
from the ground. At Wyesbie-house, there are three aged and 
wide-spreading oaks, which measure about 10 feet in circumfe- 
rence. In a holm, too, near Mossknow-house, there are two or- 
namental ashes, and an aged beech, which are 10 or 11 feet in 
circumference.

Land-owners. — Sir Patrick Maxwell, Bart., and Colonel Graham 
are the chief land-owners ; who, along with the other heritors, give, 
by their example and countenance, great encouragement to their 
tenants to persevere in improving their farms. 

Parochial Registers, — The parochial register of marriages com- 
mences in 1709; and that of baptisms in 1713. These registers, 
though not voluminous, appear to have been regularly kept. 

Historical Events and Antiquities. — In former times this parish, 
rich in feudal associations, was undoubtedly the scene of bloody 
contests and cruel rapine. In feudal times, various causes of jea- 
lousy and discord subsisted among the chiefs of clans, and gave 
rise to as many wars. During these endless contests, the country 
seems to have been' filled with castles and places of strength, erect- 
ed for the security of the inhabitants, not, in general, against fo- 
reign forces, but against internal hostilities. The square towers, 
which were built near the frontier of England, were chiefly used by 
their possessors, in all probability, as places of security against the 
formidable inroads, and fierce attacks of the English. In this 
neighbourhood the towers were generally of a square form, and 
three stories high. The roof was covered with square flags ; with 
a gentle tapering towards the top, and surrounded by battlements 
and parapets. The old tower of Woodhouse, having been unroof- 
ed and greatly rent for many a year, is now in a most ruinous con- 
dition. About three years ago, its south side fell down, during a

stormy niglit, with a dreadful crash.  Within a space of four miles _ 
round this tower, there are no fewer than seven of the same kmd. 
The family of Flemings, who appear to have been more distmguish- 
ed for their gallant defence of their native country, and nobly re- 
pelling a foreign foe, than for that predatory manner of life, which, 
in these times, was styled the " spirit and joy of the borders, in 
the thirteenth and beginning of the fourteenth centuries, posses- 
sed certain lands in this parish, by the tenure of defending them 
at all times against their southern neighbours. At a place called 
Redhall, on the left bank of the Kirtle, stood the baronial man- 
sion of the " bold Flemings." Towards the conclusion of Baliol's 
reign, in one of Edward's incursions into Scotland, the tower of 
Redhall was attacked by an English army. It was at that time 
occupied by no more than thirty Flemings, who, in spite of every at- 
tempt, held out against a close siege of three days. Having nobly 
defended it to the last extremity, they all chose, rather than sub- 
mit, to expire in the flames which had been kindled by their foes. 
Not the smallest trace of this tower, which was entirely demohshed 
in the beginning of the last century, now remains, f 

Within the burial ground of Kirkconnel a part of the old church, 
which is said to have derived its name from Connell, a Scotch saint, 
who flourished about the commencement of the seventh century, is 
still standing. The church-yard is situated in a rich holm of very 
considerable extent. Here is the scene of the impassioned and 
pathetic tale of " fair Helen of Kirkconnel- Lee," which has been 
so often told both in prose and verse. X 

About seventy years ago, a man who was casting peats near 
Cove, found a piece of gold, about eighteen inches under ground, 
worth about L. 12. On one end of it was plainly seen the word 
Helenas, in raised Roman capitals, evidently eff'ected by a stamp, 
and on the other end, in pricked or dotted characters, were ob- 
served the letters M. B. Some gave it as their opinion, that it

repaired, when he was flying from Longshanks. Bruce, at his departure thence, 
having taken along with him one of the sons of Irving, the gentleman by whom the 
house was then possessed, first made the youth his secretary, next created him a knight, 
and lastly, made him a present of the lands of the forest of Drum, as a reward for his 
fidelity and services.

that it had beed used as a fibula for fastening a garment. 

Modern Buildings. — In the north-west part of the parish stands 
the mansion-house of Springkell, which was erected in 1734, in 
the Grecian style of architecture, about 200 or 300 yards to the 
eastward of the place where the old family residence and village 
of Kirkconnel stood. The present mansion-house, the seat of Sir 
Patrick Maxwell, Bart, was greatly enlarged about sixteen years 
ago, by the addition of a handsome wing to the east, and a corre- 
sponding one to the west end. The building is remarkably elegant, 
and the surrounding grounds are tastefully laid out. — A mile dis- 
tant from Springkell, on the right bank of the Kirtle, is the tower 
of Blackethouse in Middlebie, formerly possessed by a family 
of the name of Bell. — About half a mile below this, on the left 
bank, is situated the house of Alderbeck, which now belongs to the 
proprietor of Springkell, and is occupied by a most respectable and 
enterprising tenant. Langshaw, the seat of John Barker, Esq. is 
situated about a mile from this, on the same side of the river, and 
is a neat and commodious house. — About half a mile from Lang- 
shaw, Wyesbie, the residence of Mrs Mair, is delightfully situated 
on the same side of the river. — At a short distance from Wyesbie 
stands the ancient family seat of the Irvings of Bonshaw, on the 
right side of the river in the parish of Annan. The old mansion- 
house is built near the edge of a steep rock, which rises to a con- 
siderable height above the bed of the Kirtle. — On the same side 
of the river, Robgill-tower, belonging to James Smail, Esq., and 
formerly possessed by the late Sir Emilius Irving', Bart., is situated 
about half a mile from Bonshaw, on the northern confine of the 
parish of Dornock. The scenery around Robgillhouse, of which 
the old tower forms a part, is most picturesque and beautiful. — 
Cove, the romantic seat of Francis Irving, Esq., built in 1724, 
Broatshouse, the residence of William Batty, Esq. lying about 
two miles south-west of Cove ; and Newtonhouse, the residence of 
Matthew Rea, Esq. standing about a quarter of a mile eastward of 
Qove, — are substantial and comfortable buildings. At a short 
distance from the church is Mossknow, the mansion-house of 
Colonel Graham. The situation of the house, which is a hand- 
some modern building, is enriched by fine plantations, and an ex- 
cellent garden. An extensive and fertile holm, intersected by the 
Kirtle, and beautified by straggling trees of considerable size, opens 
to the south.

For many years past, the houses here have regularly been built 
of stone and lime, and covered with slate ; and the clay-houses, 
once numerous, have almost all been pulled down, except towards 
the east and south ends of the parish ; and more modern and com- 
modious dwellings erected in their place.

From 1821 there has been a decrease of thirty. Since the cen- 
sus was taken in 1821, a number of famihes in the north part of 
the parish left their farms, which were afterwards let annually as 
pasture ; and emigrated to other parishes or to America. This, 
in a great measure, may be assigned as the cause of the decrease.

Habits and Character of the People. — The habits of the people 
are in general cleanly, and their dress is of late years greatly im- 
proved. Gray plaids are frequently worn instead of great-coats. 
The ordinary food of the farm-servants at their meals is oatmeal 
porridge for breakfast, butcher-meat, with potatoes and bread, for 
dinner, and porridge for supper. The food of mechanics is nearly 
the same. The cottagers commonly make use of tea or coffee for 
breakfast and supper, but seldom have it in their power to purchase 
butcher-meat for dinner. Though farmers and mechanics, manu- 
facturers, and agricultural labourers have various difficulties with 
which to struggle, yet they appear, upon the whole, to be tolerably 
contented with their situation and circumstances in hfe. The in- 
habitants of this parish are, with few exceptions, possessed of a 
good deal of penetration, and a great fund of common sense, and 
are well acquainted with the principles of that religion which they 
profess. The farmers are a respectable class of men,— industrious

in their caUing,— just in their deahngs,— and obhging in their 
manners. The people in general are sober, pious, and regular in 
their attendance upon public worship. They are kind and hospi- 
table to strangers, and ever ready to reheve the distressed.

The trees which are planted or indigenous are chiefly Scots 
firs, larches, beeches, birch, alder, oak, and ash. The general 
management of the wood is such as reflects very great credit on 
the judgment and taste of the several proprietors. 

Rent of Land.— The average rent of the arable land per acre 
is 18s. 3d.; of grazing, for cow or ox, at the rate of L.3; full- 
grown sheep, 10s. 

Rate of mye.— Labourers have commonly Is. a-day m sum- 
mer, and 9d. in winter, with victuals; or Is. 6d. and Is. 3d. with- 
out victuals. Masons receive 3s. and carpenters 2s. 6d. per day 

without victuals. . 

Husbandry/.— The common mode of rotation is six years. Hut 
it is neither rigidly enforced by the land-owner, nor strictly adher- 
ed to by the tenant. The manures which are principally used for 
meliorating the soil and raising crops are lime and dung collected 
upon the diff"erent farms. Lime can be conveniently carted from 
Donkins and Blacketrigg, in Middlebie, and from Caldronlee, 
near Springkell, in this parish, at Is. 2d. per Carlisle bushel, which 
contains a little less than three Winchester bushels. The crops 
to which most attention is paid in the greater part of this parish, 
and which, indeed, most liberally reward the labours of the hus- 
bandman, are barley, oats, and potatoes. Barley may be consider- 
ed, in a great measure, as an article for the market Wheat, of 
which there is not much sown, generally answers well, as it is ne- 
ver sown but when the land is in high cultivation. Turnips are 
here a precarious crop, except on the best land A crop of po- 
tatoes, even in common years, is the most valuale that is raised. 
An immense number of swine is annually fed m this quarter.

" By means of draining, many acres of unproductive morass 
and wet land have been brought into a state of luxuriant fertility. 
By its proper application, land, which before the art was intro- 
duced was considered valuable, has been rendered doubly so ; and 
by draining alone our climate has been greatly ameliorated." 
Though a great deal has been done in this neighbourhood by pro- 
prietors and tenants for the improvement of land, by removing 
surface and under water by means of open, covered, and tile drains, 
yet much still remains to be done. Leases of fifteen years are ge- 
nerally given on improved farms ; but when a farm has to be en- 
closed and drained, a lease of twenty-one years is considered suf- 
ficiently short. The rents of a small number of farms here are 
from L. 440 to L. 200 ; of a great number from L. 200 to L. 50 ; 
and of some from L. 50 downwards. The farmers are in general 
accommodated with comfortable houses and convenient offices. 

The improvement of moss by a covering of clay was introduced 
into this quarter, and tried with ex.cellent effect about twenty-eight 
years ago, by William Blacklock, who was then farmer of How- 
gillside, upon the estate of Springkell. " After the land has been 
ploughed into ridges of 14 or_18 feet wide, labourers with spades 
widen and deepen the furrows from 15 to 18 inches, and throw 
the substratum of clay upon the ridges'. The moss is thus press- 
ed down, and its depth diminished. This is repeated next season, 
and gives new soil for a second crop, equal to, if not better than 
the first. Lime is applied in different quantities, according to the 
nature of the soil. On clay lands, from 50 to .60 Carlisle bushels 
of shells nearly 3 Winchester each are Jloured and spread ; and 
for moss, from 20 to 30 are found to be sufficient as one dose, 
which must be repeated every rotation of seven or eight years. 
Where moss is from 18 inches to 2 feet deep, it is firstploughed 
very thin, and laid over quite flat. It is allowed to lie in that po- 
sition till the plants rot a good deal, and hmed upon the face. It 
is again ploughed a little deeper in the same furrows, and sown 
with oats. After the crop is removed, it is ploughed a third time, 
and clayed as above for the second crop, and the same operation 
is repeated for a third crop, amongst which grass seeds are sown. 
The expenses of each claying are found to be about L. 1, 5s. per 
acre, by which, and the ploughings, the moss loses fully one-third 
of Its depth, and the surface becomes firm for the feet of cattle." 

Quarries.~ln the immediate vicinity of Springkell there is a

great quantity of excellent lime-rock. Caldronlee-quarry is trough - 
shaped, and its Hne of bearing is westerly, i. e. the longitudinal 
line of trough, — and the strata rise very suddenly both to the 
north and south. It is in beds; and its thickness is about 30 
feet. It rests upon slate-clay of a grayish colour, and the upfil- 
ling of the trough is of the same kind of slate-clay, conforming 
with the dip and rise, or trough of the lime-rock. The terrace 
or cover is thick, particularly in the centre of the trough. Here 
are four good draw-kilns. The coals for burning the lime are 
brought either from Canobie, nine miles distant, or by sea from 
the collieries of Cumberland to Annan, whence they are carted 
eight miles to the kilns. The price of a Winchester bushel of 
shells is about 4gd. 

Near Blacketrigg, which is on the border of Middlebie parish, 
and about one mile distant from Springkell, is a marble quarry, 
from which large blocks have been raised for marble works. In 
Springkell House there are several mantel-pieces and tables of this 
marble. The colour is gray, tinged and clouded with red. As it 
is susceptible of a high polish, it is pleasing to the eye, and very 
suitable for mantel-pieces and pavement for saloons. This marble 
rock is overlaid by the common sandstone, as it appears at the 
farm-stead of Blacketrigg. 

In this parish there is a great abundance of freestone, very dif- 
ferent both in quality and colour. In the north part of the parish, 
near to the farm-building of Blackcleugh, the rock is quartzy sand- 
stone, with beds of soft red marly rock, both of a deep red colour. 
The dip is westerly, with a declination of at least one in two. The 
rock of Snabb-quarry, situated near the north boundary of the estate 
of Springkell, is a good quartzy sandstone of a whitish colour, and 
has very little cover of earth. The dip is to the eastward of north. 
The quarry of Craigshaws consists of sandstone of a white colour, 
' occasionally mixed with yellow. Its dip is moderate, about one in 
five westerly. There are only about four feet of peat-earth above 
it. The quarry of Branteth consists of rock of nearly the same 
colour, having a westerly dip. At Sarkshields there is a quarry of 
the hard chocolate-coloured sandstone, which is wrought for the 
roads in that neighbourhood. The dip is to the north. Along the 
banks of the Kirtle, there is in general nothing to be seen but the 
red coloured sandstone, dipping westerly, with subordinate beds of 
soft red-coloured marly rock, which gives a deep red colour to the 
alluvial cover. The best freestone quarries here are to be found 
upon the estate of Cove. In one of these quarries the rock is rod

sitndstone, with a subordinate bed of very white sandstone. In 
another the rock is of a fine gray colour, occasionally mixed with 
yellow. It dips to the S. S. W., and has a cover of considerable 
depth. It admits of a fine polish, and is very durable. Within the 
last twenty years, the principal stones which were used in building 
the splendid bridge of Carlisle, and also the magnificent mansion 
of Kinmont, in the parish of Cummertrees, were carted from these 
quarries. Many ship-loads, too, have at different times been sent 
to Ireland. 

Produce. — The average gross amount and value of produce year- 
ly raised in the parish, as far as can be ascertained, is as follows : 

2687 imperial acres of grain of all kinds, at L. 4 per acre, - L. 10748 0 0 

1152 acres of potatoes and turnips, &amp;e. at L. 4, - - 4608 0 0

Manufactures.— About 150 cotton-weavers, who are employed 
by Messrs Ferguson and Dickson, Carlisle, are here the only ma- 
nufacturers. They work six days a-week, and twelve hours per 
day. Each of them earns about 7s. per week. These individuals, 
not bemg crowded together in great numbers, suffer no very mate- 
rial mjury either in their health or morals from the line of hfe which 
they follow. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Towns, -c— Those to which the people of this parish 
resort are Ecclefechan, in the parish of Hoddam, and Annan, about 
five miles distant from the centre of this parish; also Carlisle, dis- 
tant thirteen miles, to which many of the inhabitants go weekly 
The post-towns are Ecclefechan and Annan. 



28G DUMFRIES-SIIIRE. 

Means of Communication. — The road from Carlisle to Glasgow, 
and to Edinburgh by Moffat, runs through the middle division of 
the parish, five miles in length ; and in the western corner, near 
Langshaw, crosses the road, which runs from Annan to Edinburgh 
by Langholm and Selkirk, in a northerly direction, four miles in 
length. A road which was opened up some years ago from Annan 
to Langholm, by Stapleton, Beltenmont, and Chapelknow, runs 
from the south-west in an easterly direction, nearly four miles in 
length. The Glasgow mail passes this every morning from Car- 
lisle to Glasgow, and every afternoon from Glasgow to Carlisle. 

Four bridges have been thrown across the Kirtle, and connect 
this parish with Middlebie on the north-west. There is one also 
over the Kirtle at Beltenmont, and another over a rivulet at Cleugh- 
sid'-titch joins this parish, to Dornock on the south-west, with 
two on the Glasgow road. All these bridges are in excellent con- 
dition. 

Ecclesiastieal State.— The situation of the church, though sur- 
rounded by the m9st densely peopled part of the parish, is not con- 
venient for the inhabitants of the northern division, which is distant 
from it about five miles. It was partly rebuilt fifty-six years ago, 
and then put into a state of complete repair. But at present its 
interior part is in such a miserable condition as again to require a 
thorough repair. By a decided majority of the heritors, it is thought 
that a new church should immediately be built. The sittings are 
all free, and can accommodate about 600 individuals. The manse 
and offices have been greatly improved within the last twenty years; 
and the glebe, which consists of 6| imperial acres of superior, and 
17 1 of inferior land, is worth L.20 a-year. As the teinds are ex- 
hausted, the present incumbent agreed some years iigo to receive 
from the heritors a fixed sum of L. 210 yearly. There is no chapel 
of any kind here. The number of families attending the Establish- 
ed church is 290, and of persons of all ages, 1595. Thirteen fami- 
lies, or 71 persons of all ages, attend dissenting chapels. Of that 
number, those who are of the Relief persuasion attend a chapel at 
Waterbeck, in Middlebie; and those who belong to the United Se- 
cession church attend either a chapel at Ecclefechan, in Hoddam, 
or one which was lately erected at Rigg, in Graitney. Divine ser- 
vice at the Established church is well attended by both the higher 
and lower orders. The average number of communicants is 300. 
The average amount of yearly contributions for religious and cha- 
ritable purposes is L. 14; of church collections yearly, L. 30.

Education. — There are two parochial schools and two Sabbath 
schools. Kirkpatrick school -house was built fifty-eight years ago, and 
is kept in good repair. The late Dr Graham, of Mossknow, grand- 
uncle of its present proprietor, mortified L. 5 a-year to the teacher 
of this school, for which sum he is bound to educate eight poor 
children. The branches of instruction generally taught in each of 
the schools are English, writing, book-keeping, arithmetic, geo- 
graphy, mathematics, Latin, Greek, and French. 

The salary of the teacher of Kirkpatrick shool is L. 25, 13s. 3 g d. ; 
amount of school fees L.36; amount of other emoluments, L. 12. 
The salary of the teacher of Gair school, which was built in the 
north part of the parish about thirty years ago, is L.25, 13s. 3gd. ; 
amount of school fees L. 23 ; amount of other emoluments L. 2, 
10s. Both the teachers have the legal accommodations. 

The expense of education per quarter is, for reading, 2s. ; for 
reading and writing, 2s. 6d.; for arithmetic, Enghsh grammar, geo- 
graphy, and writing, 3s. 6d. ; higher branches, 5s. 

The Sabbath school taught in Kirkpatrick church is attended 
by 170; and that which is taught in the school-house of Gair is 
attended by 80 scholars. These schools are supported chiefly by 
donations from the heritors. A greater number of professional 
men, and others holding respectable situations of life, has received 
the elements of a liberal education at Kirkpatrick school, than at 
almost any other grammar school throughout the whole of this dis- 
trict. 

Libraries. — A parochial hbrary, and two libraries for the use of 
those children who attend the Sabbath schools, were here insti- 
tuted at the commencement of this year. 

Savings Bank. — A savings bank was estabhshed in 1827. The 
average increase of this bank yearly is L.45. The amount yearly 
invested is L. 80 ;— yearly withdrawn L. 35 ; and the investments 
are generally made by farm-servants. 

Poor.— The poor are maintained by church collections and le- 
gal assessments. Of persons who receive parochial aid, the ave- 
rcige number is 30, and the average sum allotted to each per year is 
L. 4, 13s. 4d. 

Of contributions arising from church collections, the annual amount is L. 30 0 0 
From legal assessments, - - . _ llOOO 

L. 140 0 0 

The assessment, of which the proprietor pays one-half, and the 
tenant the other half, tends to increase. The poor being al- 
most always compelled by necessity to seek relief from the heri-

tors and kirk-session, are not apt, therefore, to consider it as de- 
grading to do so. 

Inns. — In this parish there are four small inns or public-houses, 
which evidently have a pernicious effect upon the morals of a small 
portion of the people. 

Fuel. — Peat is commonly used as fuel; but a considerable 
quantity of coal, which is carted either from Canobie or Annan, 
is also here consumed. The price of a cart-load of coals is 10s. 
6d. ; and of a cart-load of peats. Is. 4d. Twenty-seven cart-loads 
of peats are considered sufficient for a cottager's family, which has 
only one constant fire. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

That unprofitable mode of cultivation which prevailed in this 
parish forty years ago has, in a great measure, been abandoned, 
and a more extensive and liberal system of agriculture has been 
adopted in its stead. Many acres of moor-ground have been turn- 
ed over with the plough, and rendered tolerably productive, and 
a considerable portion of flow-moss has been converted into ver- 
dant meadow or pasture by drainage and surface-culture. The 
improvement, which has been made upon the south-west part of 
the parish, and also upon that which hes to the north of the Glas- 
gow road, and is bounded by the Langholm road on the north- 
west, is most striking. In 1792, the real rent of the parish was 
L. 2870, and now it is L. 7369. The houses of proprietors and 
farmers, of mechanics and cottagers, have been vastly improved 
within the last thirty years. A great change for the better has 
also taken place in the language, the dress, and the manner of 
living, of the inhabitants. As the soil still admits of extensive 
amelioration, much might be done in accomplishing that end by 
men possessed of capital, skill, and enterprise. A line of commu- 
nication from Sarkshields, near Springkell, to Kirkpatrick church, 
by Gilshaw's flow, is greatly wanted. In all probability that 
line of road will be formed ere long.. Farms here above L.150 
a-year are the bane of the comfort, happiness, and independence 
of the lower classes. Proprietors and farmers, by supplying la- 
bourers with constant employment at all seasons, by giving them 
a fair remuneration for their industry, and by discountenancing 
vice wherever it appears, and encouraging piety and virtue, will, 
unquestionably, promote both the welfare of the lower orders, and 
the general good.

PRESBYTERY OF ANNAN, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. JAMES YORSTOUN, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Natne, Boundaries, Sfc. — The present parish of Hoddam com- 
prehends the parishes of Hoddam, Luce, and Ecclefechan, which 
were thrown into one in the year 1609. In the charters of the 
twelfth century, we find the name spelt Hodholm and Hodolm, the 
Anglo-Saxon word for the head of the holm. This is very character- 
istic of the situation of the old parish of Hoddam, which lay along 
the east bank of the river Annan, at a point where the land is flat and 
rich, and in every respect a holm. Luce was situated below this, 
on the opposite side of the river Mein. It is supposed to have de- 
rived its name from the luxuriance oi its herbage, the British word 
Ilys, and the Scoto-Irish word lus signifying herbs, weeds, &amp;c. 
Ecclefechan is supposed to have derived its name from the Latin 
word ecdesia, and an Irish abbot called Fechan, who is said to have 
lived in this quarter somewhere about the seventh century. For- 
merly it used to be spelt Eglisfechan ; and in a manuscript account 
of Dumfries-shire in the Advocates' Library it is called Ecdesia 
Fechanis. Each of these parishes in former times was furnished 
with a church, but scarcely any thing but the respective cemeteries 
now remains. When the three parishes were united, an entirely 
new church was erected in a central situation. That, however, was 
taken down about sixteen years ago, and a more substantial struc- 
ture substituted in its place. 

The present parish is bounded on the north by Tundergarth and 
St. Mungo, on the east by Middlebie, on the south by Annan, and 
on the west by Cummertrees. Its form is somewhat quadrangular, 
and its extent is in length about fiv« miles, in breadth about three 
and a-half, and in square miles eleven and a quarter. 

" This Account has been drawn up by the Rev. W. Wallace Duncan, Assistant 
Minister. 

DUMFRIES. T

DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



Topographical Appearances. — In point of scenery, it far surpasses 
most of the neighbouring parishes. Surrounded by gently swel- 
Hng hills on all sides, it forms an extensive plain, for the most part 
in the highest state of cultivation, intersected by numerous thriving 
hedges, and interspersed with clumps of trees. 

In the parish itself, there are no hills worthy of mention but that 
which is called Burnswark, in the north of the plain. This remark- 
able eminence, 740 feet above the level of the sea, being consider- 
ably higher than any other within many miles, commands one of 
the most beautiful, and, at the same time, one of the most extensive, 
views in Britain. From its summit, on a clear day, may be seen 
the Isle of Man, the whole of the northern coast of Cumberland, 
with its noble range of mountains, part of Westmoreland, of North- 
umberland, and even sometimes the mountainous part of Yorkshire. 
The greater portion of this parish is exceedingly well sheltered by 
the hills of Woodcockair and Repentance, Brownmuir, Clinthill, 
Burnswark, and some others The parish may be regarded on the 
whole as remarkably healthy. 

Hydrography. — The rivers connected with this parish are the 
Annan, the Milk, and the Mein. The first of these, in its 
course along the western boundary of Hoddam, is in general about 
100 feet broad, and abounds in pools, some of which are 15 or 16 
feet deep. The Milk, which is one of the tributaries of the An- 
nan, washes only a small corner on the north-west of the parish. 
Its direction is from the north-east, and the extent of its course 
is about fourteen miles. The Mein, which is scarcely large enough 
to deserve the name of a river, runs directly from the east, and, 
after a course of five or six miles, joins the Annan nearly at right 
angles. This stream sometimes changes its channel, and frequent- 
ly overflows its banks, thus causing considerable annoyance to those 
through whose farms it directs its course. Embankments are found 
to be very precarious, owing to the gravelly nature of the soil. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The minerals in which this parish 
chiefly abounds are slate-clay, clay-ironstone, sandstone, limestone, 
amygdaloid. Of the first of these there occur in the neighbourhood 
of Ecclefechan several varieties, containing numerous impressions of 
shells, and sometimes also of ferns. Its general colour is grayish- 
black and ash-gray, and it is in some instances so compact that 
the slaty texture is with difficulty to be discerned. Some beds of 
clay-ironstone, which occur along a stream a little above Eccle- 
fechan, alternate with greenish-gray and reddish-brown coloured

sandstone, and are from three inches to a foot ni thickness. Im- 
mediately above this, we come to thin beds of clay-ironstone, pearl 
gray-coloured slate-clay, and grayish-white and reddish-brown sand- 
stone, lying on beds of slate-clay, which alternate with beds of 
limestone containing numerous petrifactions, but chiefly mytulites 
chamites, and corallites. Still higher up the stream, we come to 
beds of limestone from one to two feet thick, alternating with beds 
of grayish-black coloured slate-clay and of grayish-white coloured 
sandstone. It may be mentioned particularly that the coal for- 
mation is to be distinctly observed in various parts of the parish, 
but especially towards the north. Several attempts have already 
been made to obtain coal a great desideratum here, but hitherto 
without success, owing, doubtless, to the want of funds sufficient 
for carrying on the work. At present some of the speculators are 
employed in sinking a pit, on one of the banks of the stream al- 
ready alluded to, about three quarters of a mile above Ecclefechan. 
They had not gone far down, when they pierced one vein of coal 
about an eighth of an inch thick, and though they have since 
descended about -seventy or eighty feet, without meeting with any  
more, they are still in great hopes of ultimately arriving at an 
abundant store of an article, for the supply of which at present 
the inhabitants of this part of the country  are so dependent on 
their English neighbours. 

At Barhill north-west corner of the parish porphyritic amyg- 
daloid appears reposing on sandstone, which again reposes on 
greyAvacke. It continues along the whole of the ridge which runs 
between this hill and Burnswark, and is to be observed in several places 
lying on coarse conglomerate and sandstone, which reposes on very 
much inclined strata of very compact small-grained greywacke. 
On the west side of Burnswark, at a considerable height, a grayish- 
coloured sandstone appears, marked with reddish-brown spots, and 
covered by slate-clay, and on the due north side higher up the 
hill there are to be seen fragments of grayish- white coloured 
sandstone, but the highest part of this hill is composed entirely of 
amygdaloid, f 

The soil may be classed under three kinds. First, the holm 
land, which lies along the banks of the Annan and Mein, and 

• The great, almost the only, drawback which this parish sustains is the want of 
coals. The cheapest and best are generally to be procured at Annan, five miles dis- • 
tant, but a horse draught of them can rarely be obtained for less than 10s. or lis,

which consists of a deep rich loam collected by those rivers, and is 
exceedingly fertile ; Secondly, the large plain in the body of the 
parish, which is composed of a light and gravelly soil, and produces 
very rich crops both of corn and grass ; Thirdly, the northern di- 
vision of the parish, where the ground rises from the plain in a 
gradual and gentle ascent, finely exposed to the south and south- 
west. The soil here inclines to clay, lies on a cold till, and cop- 
per rock, and in quality is much inferior to the low lands. 

11. — Civil History. 

Land-oioners. — The principal of these are, General Sharpe. His 
Grace the Duke of Buccleuch, Mrs Dirom of Mount Annan, and 
Alexander Scott, Esq. of Knockhill. 

Parochial Registers. — There is no register kept of the deaths 
which take place in this parish, but the births, baptisms, and mar- 
riages are regularly recorded, and have been so, — the first two from 
the year 1814, the last from the year 1746, up to the present 
date. 

Antiquities. — Hallguards, a most romantic place on the east 
bank of the Annan, was the ancient site of the castle of Hod- 
dam, which is said to have been in former times the seat of one 
of the Bruces. It was demolished some centuries ago, in com- 
pliance with a border treaty. Burnswark and its vicinity abound 
in most distinct vestiges of Roman works.  

The only other curiosity connected with this parish worthy of 
notice, is a stone imbedded in the walls of one of the porches of 
the church, about four feet and a half in length, and a foot and a 
half in breadth. This stone appears from the inscription to have 
been originally used as an altar by the soldiers of the German co- 
hort, whose title it bears. Several medals and coins, and antique 
pieces of armour, have occasionally been found in different parts 
of the parish. One very curious gold coin, in particular, was 
found in the stream that runs through Ecclefechan. It is much 

 See Chalmers' Caledonia. These works, no doubt, have given tlie name to the hill 
on and around wliich they are to be traced. Burnswark was formerly spelt Birrcns- 
loark, but of the derivation of the name no satisfactory account has hitlicrto been 
given. May it not have comq from he Latin word hiherna, this being tlie name by 
which stations of the kind were distinguished by the Romans  Within a few miles 
from this spot in Middlebie there is a Roman camp called the Birrciis, and in various 
parts of the world remains of the same nature occur bearing names exceedingly Jike 
this in the sound, and, without doubt, derived from the same root, whatever that 
may be.

Habits and Character of the People. — The people, on the whole, 
are sober and well-disposed. They enjoy in a more than ordi- 
nary degree the comforts and advantages of society, fearing God 
and honouring the king. The immoral part of the community is 
wonderfully small, considering the populousness of the village, and 
the temptations to which they are consequently exposed. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Economy. — The soil of this parish as 
has been already remarked is generally very productive, even by 
nature. It has been well called the garden of Annandale but 
besides this it has more of the advantages which good farming 
bestows than most of the parishes in this county. The larger 
proprietors have lately adopted the system of throwing several 
small farms into one of great extent and high rental,, thus se- 
curing men of considerable capital for their tenants, and conse- 
quently conducing to the ultimate improyement and increased 
value of the land. The following table will give a pretty correct 
view of the agricultural concerns of this parish :

The yearly rental of the parish, in houses as well as land, is 
about L. 7000. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Markets, Sfc. — Once at least every month a market is held in 
the village of Ecclefechan. But these markets or fairs have not 
been nearly so well attended ever since the establishment of a weekly 
market in Annan, which took place about fifteen or twenty years 
ago. A pork market, which has just been commenced here, and 
which is to be held every week throughout the winter, promises to 
thrive exceedingly welL The village is advantageously situated for 
such a market, as almost every cottager in the neighbourhood keeps 
a hog or two, which he fattens sometimes to a great size. There 
is only one regular butcher in Ecclefechan, but he generally ma- 
nages to afford a sufficient supply to the place. There are 3 join- 
ers, 3 blacksmiths, 4 cobblers, 1 baker, 2 haberdashers, 2 grocers, 
and 4 innkeepers. But the manufactm-e of ginghams constitutes 
the principal means of subsistence to the inhabitants of this village. 

Means of Communication. — In this respect the parish enjoys 
many advantages. There are carriers from Ecclefechan to almost 
every place of any importance within a circuit of at least fifty or 
sixty miles. One goes to Edinburgh regularly once a-fortnight, 
besides whom thei'e are others who occasionally go. The con- 
stant passing and repassing of the Glasgow and London mail-coach 
affords great regularity and facility to communication. There is a 
reading-room in the village, to which every one may resort for the 
trifling sum of one penny per visit. There is one large beautiful 
stone bridge over the Annan, two of smaller dimensions over the 
Mein, besides a considerable number, though of very insignificant 
dimensions, which span the stream at Ecclefechan, and give a pe- 
culiar appearance to the village. Besides the highway, which, 
between the point where iit enters the parish, and that at which 
it leaves it, is about three miles long, there are five cross roads, 
all of which are almost equal to turnpike. The hedges and fences, 
too, are well kept in general. 



HODDAM.

Ecclesiastical Stofe.-The site of the parish church, though on- 
o-inally well chosen, is now considered inconvenient for the greater 
part of the population, being upwards of a mile from the village, 
with very few houses in its neighbourhood. It was bmlt in the year 
1817, is furnished with complete stoves, three galleries, and a ves- 
trv, above which General Sharpe has a small room for himself and 
family. It is seated for the comfortable accommodation of about 
500 individuals; the seats, however, having been apportioned ac- 
cording to the valuation of the respective properties, none who do 
not belong to the famihes of heritors or tenants, the minister and 
schoolmaster, with their families, excepted, have any rightful ac- 
commodation in the church, so that not a few are driven to the al- 
ternative either of betaking themselves to the dissenting chapel, 
or staying at home. 

The manse, which was repaired in 1795, has since received se- 
veral important additions made by the minister himself, and is at 
present, with the offices belonging to it, in excellent condition. The 
stipend is about L. 250, paid in, money, and the value of the three 
glebes amounts to about L. 30 per annum. The number of famihes 
attending the Estabhshed church is 272. The average number of 
communicants about 200. There is one dissenting chapel in the 
parish, whose congregation is connected with the Burgher associa- 
tion. The minister is paid by seat rents and collections. The sti- 
pend of the present incumbent is understood to be L. 110, exclu- 
sive of an excellent house, garden, and offices, to which is attached 
a field of nearly an acre in extent. This is one of the oldest dis- 
senting congregations in the south of Scotland, and some of its 
members are very respectable in their station, and easy in their 
circumstances; but most of them belong to the surrounding parishes, 
the number of families attending the chapel from this parish being 
only about 40. 

There are two Sabbath schools in Hoddam. One of them is 
conducted by the members of the Establishment ; the other by 
dissenters. Each of them contains nearly 100 scholars. 

The probable average amount of collections at the church for 
religious and charitable objects cannot, independent of ordinary 
church collections, hitherto have been much more than L. 8 per an- 
num. There are only two objects in behalf of which stated yearly 
collections are made in this way. The one is the Sabbath school 
just mentioned ; the other is a female Society for the relief of the 
aged and infirm. 



296 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



Education. — The parochial school, we regret to say, is not well 
attended. This, however, cannot be said of the unendowed semi- 
naries, which are three in number, and at which most of the usual 
branches of education are taught. The salary of the parochial 
schoolmaster is L. 35 ; and the yearly amount of fees which he 
actually i-eceives cannot, it is believed, exceed L. 12. The parish 
school-house is large and most commodious in every respect, and 
yet those parents who can afford it almost universally prefer sending 
their children to the other schools, where the fees are larger. 

Poor. — There are two separate mortifications belonging to the 
poor of this parish. The one, consisting of L. 1119, 19s. 4d. Scots 
money, given by the Rev. J. Alexander in the year 1701 ; the 
other, consisting of 1000 merks, given by John Sharpe, Esq. of 
Hoddam in the year 1715. Of tljpse two sums the accumulated 
interest has amounted to a capital of L. 468. This sum at pre- 
sent yields at 3 per cent. L. 16, 18s. 6d. Besides this, the in- 
terest of the two mortified sums already-mentioned which are 
lying on the estate of Hoddam amounts to L. 6, 2s. 6d. The 
weekly collections at the church produce about L. 35, and the oc- 
casional loan of the hearse brings upwards of L. 3 more per an- 
num. It will be seen that about L. 60 is obtained every year in 
these different ways. Yet this is not sufficient to meet the wants 
of the paupers regular and irregular with which this parish 
abounds. The fact is, pauperism is not here considered at all so 
degrading now as formerly; and this taken in- connection with 
the enlargement of the farms, and the extraordinary number of 
old people in the parish, may, in some measure, account for the 
alarming fact, that, within the last seven •years, the voluntary for 
as yet there is no legal  assessment has increased from L. 18 to 
L. 140 per annum, and this although the population has been all 
the time on the decrease. The annual average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is 24, and the annual average sum allotted 
to each individual is L.7, 10s.— L. 5 of which is taken from the as- 
sessed sum, and L. 2, 10s. from the session funds. 

 The above-mentioned sum of L. 468 has now fallen into the hands of the heri- 
tors, whose object is, by its immediate distribution, to obtain the power of exacting a 
legal assessment.

PRESBYTERY OF PENPONT, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

' THE REV. THOMAS MONTGOMERY, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name Sanquhar is compounded of Caei; signifying 
a fort, and Sean, old, — both terms having reference to a fort which 
existed here in the ancient British times. Thisetymology seems more 
probable than any other that has been assigned. The original 
Sean-caer or chaer, was in the thirteenth century spelt Sene-char 
or Sancher, as appears by the charters of Robert I. and David IT. 
Afterwards it was changed to Sanquhar. 

Extent, Boimdaries. — The parish is about 18 miles in length and 
5 in breadth. By exact measurement, it contains 61 square miles. 
It is bounded on the east by the parishes of Crawfurd and Craw- 
furdjohn ; on the north by Kirkconnel : on the west by Kirkcon- 
nel, New Cumnock and Dairy; on the south by Penpont and 
Durisdeer. 

Topographical Appearances. — Its figure is very irregular. At 
the east corner, is the Lowther or Lodder Hill, 3130 feet above the 
level of the sea, and connected by a chahi of high hills with Hart- 
fell, near Moffat. At the west corner, is Black-larg Hill, 2890 feet 
above the sea, and united to a range of high land at the junction 
of the counties of Galloway and Ayr. The parish is generally 
hilly. It is formed into two divisions, nearly eqtial, by the river 
Nith. Each side of this river is bounded by a range of hills, ris- 
ing generally with a gradual declivity. Some of them are covered 
with grass and others with heath. The hollow between these two 
ranges of hills forms a vale of very considerable beauty, extending 
in length about five miles. The prevailing winds are from the west 
and south ; and with these the greatest quantity of rain falls. The 
climate is cold but healthy. 

Rivers.— i:\iQ Nith is the principal river in the parish. The 
tributary streams which flow into it in this parish are the Crawick 
and Menock on the north and east; the Killoe and Seuclian on 
the west and south.

DUMFIIIES-SIIIUE. 



Mineralogy— Coal Mines.— In the valley of the Nith, in the pa- 
rishes of Sanquhar and Kirkconnel, coal is found in great abund- 
ance, extending about seven miles in length and two miles and a- 
half in breadth. Sandstone of a reddish shade, about six feet thick, 
generally overlaps the coal; but sandstone and blaes of different 
shades are found in many places. The coal appears to be a con- 
tinuation of that which is found in Ayrshire. It cannot be supposed 
to have any connection with the coal in Canobie or Cumberland ; 
for in proceeding down the Nith the valley contracts, and the tran- 
sition rocks commence about a mile and a-half below the town of San- 
quhar, near Eliock, and where the whole of the secondary strata of 
the valley of Sanquhar terminate. Three seams of workable coal 
have been discovered, averaging severally in thickness 3 feet 8 inches, 
4 feet, and 4 feet 6 inches, and varying from 4 to 32 fathoms in 
depth. The greater part of the coal field is the property of the 
Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry. In this part the workings 
are at present carried on in three pits, and about sixty men are em- 
ployed. The water is carried off by levels. No steam or other 
engines are found necessary. The range of the coal seams is in the 
direction of the river Nith, north- west by south-east, and is bounded 
on each side by transition rocks. It dips to the north-east by north 
about one foot in twelve. It is frequently found intersected by whin- 
stone dikes, one of which, from 12 to 36 feet thick, and ranging S. E. 
and N. W., may be traced on the surface about a mile in length. 
A small dike, a few falls above the old bridge over Crawick stream, 
maybe also mentioned. It runs nearly north and south, and changes 
the former bearing of the metals separating the strata, which dip 
nearly east on both sides of it. The breach of the strata which 
constitutes the dike depresses the metals on the east side so much 
that they are considerably separated from those on the west side. 
On the east side it is called a down-dike, and on the west side an 
up-dike. Such, indeed, is the general effect which all dikes and 
shps of a similar nature produce on the metals in coal fields, where 
they frequently occur. The third seam of coal mentioned above 
has been wrought to the greatest extent by the side of the Cra- 
wick stream, in the moor of Sanquhar, which till lately was a com- 
monty. It is remarkable that, in this seam under the bed of the 
river, and to some distance on each side, there were found thou- 
sands of bodies resembling fishes of different kinds, and varying in

When broken they were discovered to be, in substance, sandstone. 
They lay at the distance of about eleven or twelve fathoms below 
the bed of the river, which consists of regularly stratified sandstone. 
Impressions of shells and of several vegetable substances continue 
to be met with, both in the coal and in the metals lying above it. 
Coal continues to be wrought near this place, but has been found 
to be much intersected with whin dikes. It is the public proper- 
ty of the burgh of Sanquhar. A steam-engine has been found ne- 
cessary to clear the workings of water. About twenty men are em- 
ployed in them. Coal has been discovered also in several small 
properties near the town of Sanquhar, but at present is not wrought 
in any of them. In the whole of the basin of Sanquhar, the coal 
is generally of a good quality, but improves as it lies farther from 
the surface. At all the pits now mentioned it is sold at 5s. per ton. 
It may be stated also that C. G. Stuart Menteath, Esq. of Close- 
burn, has in the town of Sanquhar a depot for coal, which he brings 
in considerable quantity from his pits at Mansfield, in the parish of 
New Cumnock, a distance of about eleven miles. Including this, 
about 16000 tons may be considered the average of the quantity 
sold yearly at Sanquhar. 

Lead Mines of Wanlockliead. — At the east end of the parish, 
about nine miles from the town of Sanquhar, are situated the lead 
mines'of Wanlockhead, the property of the Duke of Buccleuch 
and Queensberry. They join the mines of Leadhills, belonging 
to the Earl of Hopetoun, in the parish of Crawfurd and county of 
Lanark. The workings of both include a circle of about two and 
a-half miles. The surface is bleak and mountainous, and about 
1500 feet above the level of the sea. The rocks which generally 
prevail are greywacke and greywacke slate, often of a yellowish 
colour at the surface, but black toward the centre. They are some- 
times so hard as to strike fire with steel, but easily exfohate when 
exposed to the weather. When exposure is continued for a few 
years they fall to powder. 

Wanlockhead has long been famous for its lead mines. They 
are said to have been discovered by Cornelius Hardskins, a Ger- 
man, in the minority of James VI., when the Germans were em- 
ployed in searching for gold in that place. Sir Bevis Bulmer, mas- 
ter of the mint under Queen Elizabeth, with concurrence of the 
Scottish monarch, is said to have employed 300 men in that work 
in the neighbourhood of Wanlockhead and Leadhills several years 



300 DUMFRIES- SlllUE. 

during summer, and to have collected of that metal to the amount 
of L. 100,000 Sterling. Many heaps of sand and gravel cast up 
then, are still to be seen on the banks of several streams, near the 
places now mentioned. The search, it is said, became unprofitable 
when the wages of a workman exceeded fourpence per day. A 
mine has been cut a considerable way into one of the mountains, 
close by the Wanlock stream; which is supposed to have been cut in 
search of gold. For such as wish to procure a little in a state of pu- 
rity, or for the purpose of being formed into a ring, &amp;c. it is still 
collected by the miners, though not in any great quantity. It is 
generally found at the bottom of the glens, of a granular form, dis- 
seminated among rocks, and mixed with sand and gravel. During 
the last four years, two specimens have been found which weighed 
respectively ninety and sixty grains. 

The lead-mines at Wanlockhead were opened up by Sir James 
Stampfield, about the year 1680, and were wrought by him with 
some success, but not to any great extent, till the Revolution. 
In 1691, he was succeeded by Matthew Wilson, who procured a 
lease for nineteen years, and wrought the vein called Margaret's 
in the Dodhill. He carried his workings quite through that hill, 
from Whitecleuch to Wanlock stream, and was very successful in 
his discoveries. He was again succeeded in 1710, by a Company 
for smelting lead ore with pit coal. They had a lease for thirty-one 
years, and wrought to a considerable extent in the veins of Old Glen- 
crieff and Belton-grain, but were not very successful in their ope- 
rations. At length, after much discouragement, they had the good 
fortune to find out the veins of New GlencriefF, where in a very 
short time they raised a great quantity of lead-ore. 

In 1721, a numerous Company was formed, of persons residing in 
different parts of the kingdom, under the name of the Friendly Min- 
ing Society. They entered into partnership with the smelting Com- 
pany, for working the mines upon a farther lease of fifteen years, in 
addition to the one already obtained by the latter company of thirty- 
one years. The two companies thus united, carried on their ope- 
rations in all the four principal veins then known, and to conside- 
rable extent, till 1727. They then separated from each other, | 
and prosecuted their works in different grounds. The smelting 
company entered on the east side of the Wanlock stream, and vi- 
gorously continued their operations till 1734, when, having sufler- 
ed great loss, though they had raised much lead, they resigned 
their lease. An individual partner in the company, however, ]\Ir 



SANQUIlAft.

Wightman, retained liberty to work in the southern part of then- 
bounclarv. He confined his operations to the south end of Mar- 
garet's vein. But they were very unprofitable, and terminated with 
his death in 1747. The mining liberty which had been possessed 
by him was unoccupied till 1755, when it was entered on by the 
firm which still continues, Messrs Ronald Crawford, Meason and 
Company, by whom it was wrought extensively, and with much 
success. They continued their operations in Margaret's vein forty- 
three years. For carrying off the water they erected three steam- 
engines. The first was in 1778, and supposed to be the second 
erected by Mr Watt in Scotland. The Friendly Mining Society, 
having resigned their lease in 1734, were succeeded in the boun- 
dary which they had possessed, by Alexander and William Telfer, 
who obtained a lease of the northern part of their grounds for 
twenty-one years. They succeeded in raising great quantities of 
ore, which sold at a high price. At the expiration of their lease 
in 1755, Messrs Ronald Crawford, Meason and Company, were 
also their successors, who now possessed the whole of the mining 
liberties at Wanlockhead. This enterprising and eminently suc- 
cessful company continued the works whicli had been left by Messrs 
Telfer till 1775. About this period they discovered good ore in 
Belton-grain vein above water level, and continued working there 
till 1800. Then finding the ore above water level to be mostly , 
wrought out, they were under the necessity of erecting one steam- 
engine, a second in 1812, and a third in 1817. The expense of 
erecting these engines, and supplying them with coal, which was 
brought from the parish of Kirkconnel or the west end of the parish of 
Sanquhar, a distance of about ten or twelve miles, must evidently have 
been very great. But still, the works were profitable till about five 
years ago, when the free trade system was introduced by legislative 
enactment, and foreign lead was allowed to be imported to Britain, 
without being subject to the payment of duty. From that period, 
the price of lead being much lower than formerly, the company 
must have suffered great loss. The veins have also presented great 
poverty. Cove vein, which is the present scene of labour, has never 
been rich. During the period which clasped from 1823 to 1827, 
the company sunk forty fathoms under level, and erected two 
steam-engines under ground, but the quantity of ore found did not 
answer their expectations, and was not commensurate with the ex- 
pense incurred in raising it. The five engines last mentioned 
possessed collectively 2G8 horses power. Previous to the erection 



302 



DUMFllIES-SHIUE. 



of these and of those on Margaret's vein, the water was raised from 
the mines by hand-pumps and water-wheels. The steam-engines 
have now all been removed, and a water pressure engine has been 
erected, which is succeeding remarkably well. It carries away 
all the water which was formerly removed by the two steam-engines 
under ground, — it works with little attention, requiring merely that 
the water be kept regularly upon it, and thus greatly lessens the 
expense which was formerly incurred. The Company at their com- 
mencement in 1755 had a lease only of nineteen years; but an Act of 
Parliament was obtained afterwards, authorizing the extension of it 
till 1812, which was subsequently extended thirty years farther. 
Accordingly, about seven years only of the present lease have now 
to run. The present lessees are, the Marquis of Bute, who 
has three shares, and Mr M'Leod, who has one share, — in all 
four shares. The great advantage of these works to the surround- 
ing country must be evident, when it is mentioned, that the com- 
pany during the last fifty years have expended at Wanlockhead, 
exclusive of their expenditure for materials in other places, the sum 
of L. 500,000. By the terms of their lease, they delivered a sixth 
part of the lead raised to the proprietor as rent or lordship. But 
by a new agreement, on account of the unfavourable circumstances 
which have been mentioned above, they deliver a much less quan- 
tity. . During the last fifty years, 47,420 tons of lead have been 
raised ; and to show how various the success of the Company has 
been, it may be mentioned, that in the year 1809 there were rais- 
ed nearly 1037 tons of lead, which sold at L. 32 per ton. In 18] 1 
its price was L. 24 per ton. In 1829 and 1830 respectively, there 
were raised 596 and 461 tons, when its price was only L. 13 per 
ton. The number of persons employed in the works at present is 
as follows: 4 overseers and clerks, 154 miners, 12 washers, 8 smel- 
ters, 10 smiths, carpenters, and engineers, 20 boys who assist in 
washing ; amounting in all to 208. The work is let by bargains, 
generally for three months ; that is, the workmen receive a cer- 
tain stipulated sum for the quantity of ore per ton, which they raise, 
or for the fathom of dead work which they perform in that time. 
They relieve each other by courses every six hours, and in twenty- 
four hours the same course does not go to work more than once. 
Each miner, on an average, may be supposed to earn at jiresent 
about L. 20 during the year. Agreeably to the contract of lease, 
some spare pickmen are always at work, for making new discove- 
ries of lead.

The veins or mineral depositories hitherto wrought, as has been 
mentioned, are five in number, viz. Old Glencrieflf, New Glen- 
criefF, Belton-grain, Margaret's and Cove. They lie parallel, and 
distant from each other about 120 fathoms. Belton-grain, which 
lies nearest the east, is about 300 fathoms from Cove. They have 
been wrought to the depth of 60, 75, 93, and 136 fathoms from 
the surface. The tops of the veins lie generally to the west, and 
they slope or hade eastward at an angle from thirty to forty-five de- 
grees from the horizon. According to the language of the miners 
they hade one fathom in three or sometimes in two ; by which is 
meant that they make one fathom in horizontal length, to three or 
two in height. They do not generally run straight forward, but 
in a winding direction. From this cause, none of the drifts are 
straight lines, but vary in working southward, from five to fifteen de- 
grees east to south of fifteen degrees west of south. In all the 
workings the medium point is found to be almost south and north, 
so that the veins cannot be said to vary much in their course. The 
rocks which they traverse lie in beds at the same angle with them- 
selves. These are the indurated argillaceous mountain rock, or what 
miners call the gray and blue whinstone. The veins are from a 
few inches to 4 feet in width. The bearing and the barren parts 
are very various in their length. The former are found from one 
or two to 70 or 80 fathoms, as in Belton-grain. The latter are 
sometimes more and sometimes less extensive, and when they do 
occur are called checks by the miners. The length and depth of 
the bearing parts always maintain a proportion to each other. The 
length, however, is generally something more considerable than 
the depth. None of the veins have been found to contain much 
ore beyond the depth of 100 or 120 fathoms. They generally 
contract in their extremities, and diminish in their course toward 
the bottom. Clay beds are found occasionally to interrupt them. 
The course of Belton-grain vein may be traced on the surface, 
by the ground being somewhat slackened or hollowed. Nothing 
similar or peculiar in any way is perceivable on the surface of the 
ground over any of the other veins. 

The structure of the veins is very various. The ore frequently 
lies in a regular form, but sometimes it is irregular, and mixed with 
what are called vein stones, as lamellar heavy spar, calcspar, rock- 
cork, &amp;c. The ores are, lead glance, blende, manganese ochre, cop- 
per pyrites, green lead-ore, white lead-ore, lead-vitriol and brown 
hematite, all in small quantities except the lead-ore. The con-

tents of a bearing- vein are often found as follows : On the under 
or lying side, is lead glance or common galena, then a layer of 
ochre of manganese several inches thick, above it a layer of quartz 
interspersed with iron pyrites, then another layer of manganese 
mixed with quartz, pieces of lead glance and carbonate of lime fol - 
lowed by greywacke, which constitutes the walls of the mine. Be- 
sides lead glance or common galena, the following minerals are 
also found, viz. sulphate, phosphate, carbonate, and arseniate of 
lead. The vanadiate of lead has been found in the refuse of the 
old workings, where it was for a time taken for arseniate of lead. 
These different specimens are now and then found occupying the 
same drusy cavity, and when seen before being injured or remov- 
ed from their relative position, exhibit a fine lustre and beautiful 
crystallization. The druses or laeugh holes, as they are termed 
by the miners, are also frequently studded with quartz, carbo- 
nate of zinc, &amp;c. Sulphuret of zinc or zinc-blende is found in con- 
siderable quantity in some of the veins, particularly in Margaret's. 
Specimens of iron also occur, as ochry red iron-ore, but iron is al- 
ways reckoned by the miners as unfavourable to their prospects in 
procuring lead. The lead glance at Wanlockhead was found by 
analysis to contain a small quantity of arsenic, antimony, and silver. 
The last mentioned was from eight to ten ounces in the ton of lead- 
ore. 

Lime, Sj-c. — Limestone rock has been discovered between the 
town of Sanquhar and Wanlockhead, on the farm of Castle Gd- 
mour. It is presented in a stratum about 4 feet thick; above it, is 
one of freestone 2 feet thick ; and under it, is one of blaes. It 
has been attempted to be wrought, but not with much advantage, 
nor to great extent. In that neighbourhood are also found ma- 
rine marl, a stratum of marine shell about 4 feet thick, containing 
nodules of hmestone, and a seam of coal about 40 inches thick, 
regularly stratified, but of inferior quality, being combined with a 
large proportion of pyrites. The extremities of the parish are oc- 
cupied by mountains of transition rocks. The valley of the Nith 
contains only secondary strata. The sandstone is generally white, 
but in some places is strongly tinged with red. It is rather coarse 
in the grain, but for the most part is well adapted for the pur- 
poses of building. 

Soil— The soil in the valley of the Nith is of good quality. It 
is generally dry and gravelly, and in some ]Dlaces is loamy. A 
great part of the land farther distant from the river mentioned, on

both sides, partakes much of clay and moss, and is in a great pro- 
portion wet and boggy. It is generally of a deep soil, and well 

adapted for grazing. . , . , . p  . 

Wood— A great part of the parish is destitute of plantations 
and uninclosed. Of the lands belonging to the Duke of Buccleuch 
and Queensberry, 282 acres are covered with natural wood, which 
are chiefly the banks of the streams. The trees are but small ; 
they are merely shoots from the roots of. large trees, cut down 
about forty years ago, and are chiefly oak, birch and hazel. Of 
the estate of Eliock, belonging to Henry Veitch, Esq. about 450 
acres are planted. A large proportion of the trees are full-grown, 
and many of them very old oak. This proprietor, by careful 
and judicious management, has greatly improved his plantations, 
and made many additions to them. They lie on the west side of 
the Nith below the town of Sanquhar, and extend to a distance 
of several miles. The trees of which they consist are very various, 
as Scotch larch, silver, spruce, and balm of Gilead fir, oak, elm, 
ash, mountain-ash, birch, beech, Swedish mapple, hazel, &amp;c. 

11. — Civil History. 

Burgh o/Saww/iar.— Sanquhar was a burgh of Barony, accord- 
ing to one account, from time immemorial, and according to others 
from 1484. In 1596, at the request of Robert Crichton, Lord of 
Sanquhar, it was erected into a royal burgh, and is governed by a 
provost, three bailies, a dean of guild, a treasurer and eleven coun- 
cillors. In its pohtical capacity it is joined to Dumfries, Annan, 
Lochmaben, and Kirkcudbright. 

Castle. — The old castle of Sanquhar claims particular notice. It 
is situated on a steep bank, in the immediate vicinity of the town of 
Sanquhar ; toward the south it is a very picturesque ruin, and ap- 
pears to have been a strong square building with towers at the corners. 
Close to it, was a large deer park ; on the north, was a deep fosse 
and drawbridge ; on the west, were the gardens, in which is still 
visible the fish pond with an island in the middle. At a short dis- 
tance south from the castle, is the moat or ancient court-hall where 
the barons met to distribute justice. Tradition bears, that the 
castle was for some time in the possession of the English in the 
reign of Edward I., and was recaptured by Sir William Douglas 
of Douglasdale by stratagem, who put the garrison to the sword. 

♦ An account of all tlic parishes in tlie Presbytery of Penpont was written about 
the beginning of the last century, by the Rev. Mr liac, author of the History of the 
Rebellion in Scotland in 1715. Mis account of this parish, however, is now unfor- 
tunately lost.

Historical notices.— T\\q first Lords of Sanquhar were of the 
Ross or Roose family, cadets of the Earls of Ross, Lords of the 
Isles of Scotland. Robert de Ross was the last of the line at San- 
quhar who bore that name ; William, second son of Thomas Lord 
of Creighton, who flourished in the reign of Robert Brus, mar- 
ried his daughter, Isobel, by whom he had a son. The father hav- 
ing come to the possession of the title of Lord of Creighton died 
in 1360, and his son by this lady became Lord of Sanquhar. Sir 
Robert Creighton, great grandson of Isobel de Ross, was appointed 
by James III. in 1464, heritable sheriff of Dumfries-shire. In 
1630, the barony of Sanquhar was purchased by Sir William Dou- 
glas of Drumlanrig, on which he had a mortgage. The Queens- 
berry family for some time resided in the castle of Sanquhar be- 
fore that of Drumlanrig was built. 

Eminent Men. — Mr Robert Crichton of Eliock, connected with 
this parish, was an eminent lawyer and advocate to Queen Mary 
and King James VI., and a Lord of Session. His eldest son, 
James, went abroad when young, and was intimately and exten- 
sively acquainted with literature and science, and so eminently ac- 
comphshed in all kinds of bodily exercises, that he was the wonder 
of the age, and generally known by the appellation of the Admi- 
rable Crichton. The apartment in Eliock House in which he was 
born has been carefully preserved in its original state by the suc- 
cessive proprietors.f 

Parochial Registers. — A register of births in the parish has been 
kept from 1757, but it is very defective, particularly near the pe- 
riod of its commencement. Many are not recorded. 

III. — Population. 

The population of the parish was in 1755, - 1998 

1786, - 2500 
1800, - 2350 
1811, - 2709 
1821, - 3026 
183J, - 3268 

Of the population in 1831, 1536 were males, and 1732 were 
females. Among the chief causes of the increase of population 
may be mentioned, the greater numbers which have been employed 

• Near Sanquhar Castle there was found ahout fifty years ago a stone with tlie 
following striking inscriptions ; " Here lies the good Sir John Ross of Ryehill ; Here 
lies the good good Sir John Ross ; Here lies the good good good Sir John Ross." 

f Mr Robert Crichton, immediately after the birth of this his illustrious son, hav- 
ing sold Eliock to the family of Dalzicll, afterwards Earls of Cai'nwatli, removed to 
Cluny, an estate which he had acquired in Perthshire. From tliis circumstance it 
has been erroneously supposed by some tliat the Admirable Crichton was born at 
Cluny.

in the lead and coal mines, in the more extended cultivation of the 
land, and in the operations of a carpet-manufactory,— the success 
attending the inoculation of children with the cow-pox,— and the 
improvements in cleanliness and the manner of living, among the 
people. 

In 1831 the number of the population residing in the burgh 
part of the parish was 1527, in the landward part, 1741. Of this 
last mentioned number, 675 resided in the village of Wanlockhead.

No nobility reside in the parish, and very few individuals or fa- 
mihes of independent fortune. 

The number of inhabited houses is 575. One only is build- 
ding. There are two persons insane or fatuous ; three blind. 

During the last three years there have been nine illegitimate 
births in the parish. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — 

Imp. acres. 

There are in the parish, either cultivated or occasionally in tillage, - 5583 

never cultivated, and constantly waste or in pasture, 31530 
capable of being cultivated with a profitable applica- 
tion of capital, ... . . 1500 
in a state of imdivided common, . . . 181 
under wood, either natural or planted, - - 735 

The general kinds of trees planted are Scotch and larch fir. 
Of those which are indigenous, oak, birch, and hazel are the most 
common. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of arable land per acre in the 
parish may be estimated at 13s. The average rent of grazing 
may be considered at the rate of L. 3 per ox or cow grazed, and 
at the rate of 4s. per ewe or full-grown sheep pastured for the 
year. The rate of labour, winter and summer, for different kinds 
of farm labourers is about 7s. 6d. per week. 

Stock. — The number of horses in the parish is computed to be 
190, and of cattle 960, including in both all ages. There are 
21,000 sheep. Of these 100 are of the Leicester; 2000 are of

the Cheviot ; and the remainder are of the black-laced, short woolled 
breed, which are commonly kept in this part of the country. 
They are all generally in good condition and well managed. Of 
late, several of the farmers, instead of smearing them with tar mixed 
with butter or palm oil, have poured on them the juice of broom 
and tobacco. By this new process, the wool is found to be greatly 
improved, nor has the health of the sheep suffered in so far as 
trial has yet been made. 

Draining, 8c. — The extensive draining of the high and low lands 
which has now been effected has been found most beneficial for 
improving the grass and other crops in quantity and quality. The 
sheep and cattle are found also to thrive much better in conse- 
quence of this method. 

Leases — Mode of Husbandry. — The leases in general extend 
to nineteen years, and include in their articles the most approved 
methods of husbandry. They require, among other things, a re- 
gular rotation of different kinds of crop, wherever the soil admits 
of them. 

Farm-Buildings and Fences. — Many of the farm-buildings are 
not in the most desirable state, in respect of extent and conve- 
nience. In three years, however, about five -sevenths of the leases 
expire, when there is the prospect of the houses being rebuilt on 
the most approved plans, and put into the best condition. The 
enclosures and fences are generally in good order. One great 
obstacle to the cultivation of the land is the louff distance which 

O 

lime has to be carried, — a distance of eight, nine, or sixteen miles. 
Notwithstanding of this, however, a considerable quantity of lime is 
brought, and great improvements have been made in the cultiva- 
tion of the land, both in the manner of conducting it and the extent 
to which it has been carried. The management of stock also is 
now much better understood than formerly. 

Quarries. — Freestone quarries are opened up in many parts of 
the parish, but none to any great extent. The coal pits present 
nothing peculiar, in respect to the manner in which they are wrought. 
It may be mentioned that in smelting the lead-ore at Wanlock- 
head, a small quantity of lime in powder is mixed with it. Peat, 
coal, and charcoal are used as fuel. The operation of smelting, 
on account of the great heat of the furnace, is not found to be very 
favourable to the health of the persons immediately employed in 
it. The smoke which arises from the furnace is most destructive 
of animal life, and is carried off by a long flue. 



SANQUHAR. 309 

Produce.— T\\e average gross amount of raw produce raised in 
the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is estimated as follows : 

Produce of olts and barley, whether cultivated for food of man or the domestk  

animals, • • ' " 1200 

Of potatoes and turnips, • • '  ' , 

Ofhav, whether cultivated or meadow, . • • 

Of land In pasture, rating it at L. 3 per cow or full-grown ox, and at 4s. per 

ewe, or full-grown sheep pastured for the year . . ObUU 

Produce of the annual thinning and periodical fe ling of woods, . 400 

Produceofmines, including coals, quarries, and lead, . . li,iJ 

Total yearly value of raw produce, . L 25,408 

Carpet Manufactory/.— A very extensive manufactory of carpets 
is carried on at the village of Crawick-mill. There are at work 
30 looms of the newest and most approved construction, with all 
the other machinery required for preparing the yarn, as dyeing, 
carding, spinning, warping, &amp;c. The number of persons employ- 
ed in the work is as follows,— 62 men, 39 women, 12 boys, and 1 0 
girls, in all 123. They work generally about ten hours per day, 
earn on an average 12s. per week, and appear to be in a comfort- 
able condition. They manufacture annually about 4000 stones 
Tron weight of wool, and 10,000 pounds of Enghsh worsted yarns. 
Upwards of L. 2000 are paid to them yearly as wages. About 
60,000 yards of carpeting are wrought by them during the same 
period, — which, sold at 2s. 3d. or 2s. lOd. per yard, according to 
quality, bring, at the medium between the two prices, L. 7625. 
Also, about 20,000 yards of tartan cloth are wrought annually in 
the town of Sanquhar by the Crawick-mill Carpet Company, which, 
sold, at an average, at Is. 4d. per yard, bring L. 1333. A few of 
the carpets are sold in the neighbourhood; some are sent for sale 
to London; but the greater part to North and South America, to 
Hamburgh and St Petersburgh. The Company who carry on this 
work are entitled to the gratitude of the community in general, but 
especially of the neighbourhood, for their enterprise and industry, 
the regularity with which all their business is managed, and the 
correctness of conduct which they require and encourage in their 
workmen. 

Cotton Weavers. — In the town of Sanquhar, there are about 100 
cotton-weavers. The yarn is forwarded to them by manufacturers 
in Glasgow. The sewing and embroidering of muslin with cotton, 
by females, is carried on in the parish to a considerable extent. 
About 300 are engaged in the employment. Their webs are sent 
also from Glasgow. 

The knitting of stockings and mittens was formerly a branch of 
manufacture of considerable extent in the parish, but is now al-

most entirely discontinued. The stockings were wrought in a pe- 
culiar manner on wires, — were mostly party-coloured, and of great 
variety in the pattern. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Town, Villages, Sfc. — The population of the town of Sanquhar 
amounts to 1400. The trade carried on in it is chiefly the weaving 
and sewing of muslin ; other articles made and sold are mostly for 
the use of the inhabitants there and in the neighbourhood, and 
consequently the trade in them is very limited. The public re- 
venue of the burgh amounts at present to about L. 40 yearly, and 
arises from imposts paid on different articles of merchandize and 
live stock brought within its boundaries, and from an uncultivat- 
ed commonty of 181 acres. The coal mines in this common ty, 
and in the part which has been allotted to proprietors, though let 
and wrought, have yielded little or no revenue to the burgh for 
several years. The village of Crawick-mill is situated in the 
burgh part of the parish, about half a mile north-west from the 
town of Sanquhar, on the banks of the Crawick stream. It con- 
tains 124 inhabitants, and is in a thriving and prosperous state. 
The only other village in the parish is Wanlockhead, and is in the 
landward part. The number of the population there is 675. These 
are all either engaged in the lead mines, or in some way dependent 
upon them. It can scarcely be supposed that any would volunta- 
rily choose to reside there at so high an elevation. 

Means of Communication, Sfc. — In the town of Sanquhar are 
kept two post-chaises arid one car for hire. There is also esta - 
blished in that place a post-office. Letters are dispatched and 
arrive to and from Thornhill on the south, and to and from old 
Cumnock on the west daily. The revenue annually is about 
L. 160. There are two turnpikes in the parish, and the length of 
the roads on which they are placed is 12 miles. About 9 miles 
of parish roads are also in a state of good repair. On the turn- 
pike road, there pass daily one coach from Glasgow to Carlisle, 
and another from Carlisle to Glasgow. There are eight bridges 
in the parish, or over streams at its boundaries, which are of consi- 
derable extent and in good repair. With the exception of two which 
are old, they have all been built within the last twelve years. One 
of them, which is over the Nith, is made of wood, and of a very 
ingenious construction, — on which horses with loaded carts pass 
with ease and safety. There are in the parish two carding, two 
corn and barley-mills. The sort of fence most common is the 



SANQUHAR. 



Galloway stone dike, which is built wholly of dry stones, and 
generally from 4 to 5 feet high. There are a few thorn hed- 
ges, but they are found not to suit well where sheep are graz- 
ed. Paling and wooden bars are also often used as fences. The 
bars are generally 6 feet long, 4 feet in height, when fastened in 
the ground, and being moveable are found highly useful where 
only a temporary fence is required.- The parish is particularly fa- 
voured with the means of building stone dikes, as either sand or 
whinstone of good quality is found in every part of it in great 
abundance. -The fences are generally in good repair. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated at the west 
end of the town of Sanquhar. It is not very centrically placed for the 
greater part of the population. It is of elegant architecture, and was 
built about eight years ago, on an elevated situation, which over- 
looks the valley between Sanquhar and Kirkconnel. The interior 
is highly convenient, and affords accommodation for 1000 sitters. 
The free sittings are about 60. The manse and offices were built 
nearly at the same time with the church, are very commodious, 
and in good repair. The glebe extends to 19 acres, which may 
be valued at L. 2 per acre. The stipend is 18 chalders, one-half 
meal, and the other half barley. At Wanlockhead there is a 
chapel which accommodates 250 sitters. An ordained clergyman 
in connection with the Established Church preaches and dispenses 
the ordinances of religion there. It has no constitution as a chapel 
of ease, — but is properly a preaching station for the accommoda- 
tion of the miners. The stipend of the clergyman amounts on an 
average to L. 65 a year. Of this sum about one-third is paid by 
the proprietor of the mines, — and the remainder by the men who 
are employed in them. Every one engaged in the mines, who earns 
at least Is. per day, is bound to pay 4s. yearly, to the minister sta- 
tioned there. He is also provided with a dwelling-house, and a 
small piece of land. In the town of Sanquhar, there are two chapels 
in connection with the United Associate Secession church; and also 
one in which a few Anabaptists meet for divine worship. These 
three places of worship are supposed to contain about 900 sittings. 
A great proportion of those who sit there, probably the one-half, 
reside in this parish, and the other half in the surrounding parishes. 
The average number of communicants at the Established Church, 
including those who reside at Wanlockhead, is nearly 750, and 
of those who attend there, 1700. Divine service is generally well 
attended at the parish church, and in all the chapels.

DUMFRIES-SHIRK. 



The number of families in the parish attending the Established 
Church is 551; attending the Secession chapels and the chapel of 
the Anabaptists, 164. 

Societies. — A society is established in Sanquhar for Bible, Mis- 
sionary, and other religious purposes. Its annual income is about 
L. 30, — one-half of which is collected at church on a day previous- 
ly intimated, and the other half is contributed by the members of 
the society. 

Education. — The total number of schools in the parish is eight : 
of these, one is parochial, one is endowed, and the other six are 
unendowed. They are attended by about 320 scholars. Gram- 
mar, geography, book-keeping, Latin, Greek, and French are 
taught in several of them. The wages per quarter for each scho- 
lar vary from 2s. to 4s., according to the number of branches 
which are taught. The parochial teacher, by the liberahty of the 
heritors, has much more than the legal accommodation, in regard 
to house-room, — having six apartments with cellars. He has also 
two spacious school-rooms, airy and well-lighted. His salary is the 
maximum, being fully L. 34 ; and the fees actually paid to him may 
amount to L. 15 per annum. He has, besides, the interest of 
L. 100, mortified by the late Rev David Martin, who was a native 
of this parish, and a clergyman in the church of England. The 
number of persons above fifteen who cannot read is 2. The num- 
ber under fifteen who cannot write is 396, and above fifteen 350. 
In some parts of the parish, the children are so distant from any of 
the public schools, that they are prevented from attending. In 
these circumstances, a teacher is generally engaged by one or a few 
families residing near each other, and not unfrequently one or other 
of the parents assumes this office, when unable to make any better 
provision for their children. 

Libraries. — In the town of Sanquhar, there is a subscription 
library, consisting of books, for the most part, of useful knowledge. 
It was commenced in 1800 and contains 1460 volumes. The 
number of members is 178. The annual payment of each is 4s. 
and the sum paid on admission 10s. 6d. So many have given in- 
timation of having demitted to read for the present, probably on 
account of the pressure of the times — that not more than L. 26 
may be considered as the amount of the whole sum paid during the 
year. At Wanlockhead there is also a subscription library. It 
was commenced in 1756. The number of members is 105, who 
can now number 1300 volinnes, which in general are well chosen. 



SANQUHAR.

It was begun, and is supported almost entirely by, the miners and 
other inhabitants in that village, and has contributed much to pro- 
mote the intelligence for which they have long been distmguished. 
Each member pays on admission, 5s. and annually 2s. The annual 
amount ofthe sums received is L.10, 13s. In both of these libraries, 
some of the most esteemed periodical publications are regularly re- 
ceived. The opportunities for reading thus so abundantly afforded 
in both divisions of the parish, have been of great service for the 
religious, moral, and intellectual improvement of the inhabitants. 

Savings Bank.— A savings bank was established in the town of 
Sanquhar in 1819. The amount invested yearly on an average of 
the last three years is L. 1175, 10s. 6d. The average amount 
yearly withdrawn for the same time is L. 1158, 9s. The total 
amount now lodged is nearly L. 5000. Investments are generally 
made by servants, labourers and tradesmen. 

Poor. — The number of persons receiving parochial aid is about 
50, and the average sum allotted to each is about L. 1, except when 
imder sickness. The annual amount of contributions for their 
relief, under the management of the kirk-session, is L. 70, of which 
sum about one-half arises from church collections, and the other 
half from voluntary contributions, interest of money, and dues col- 
lected by the kirk-session. The heritors have not yet been called 
upon to make any legal provision for the poor. Few solicit paro- 
chial relief, except from necessity. The more wealthy parishioners 
generally manifest a charitable disposition, which produces a reci- 
procal good feeling in the poor, and excites them to make exertions 
for supporting themselves by their own industry. 

Jail, Sj-c. — The jail in Sanquhar has three apartments for pri- 
soners, and is far from being in a secure state. Debtors are some- 
times confined in it for a few weeks, but such as are lodged for cri- 
minal offences are sent off as soon as convenient to the jail at Dum- 
fries. 

Four fairs are held annually at the town of Sanquhar, at regular 
intervals. These have been continued for a long period, but they 
are now merely nominal ; for few persons attend, and little business 
is done. There are also yearly a shew of sheep, and three cattle 
markets, which are tolerably well attended. They have been but 
recently established, and promise to be of considerable utility. 

Inns, Si-c. — There are in the parish twenty-one houses in which 
spirituous or malt liquors are sold by license, the effects of which 
on the morals of the people are far from being salutary. Coal

is almost the only sort of fuel which is used in the parish, except 
in the remote parts, where peat is easily procured, and the carriao-e 
of coal is long and difficult. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since the period when the last Statistical Account was written, 
very considerable and important changes have taken place. Stock 
of all kinds, but especially sheep and cattle, have been improved. 
A much greater extent of land is in cultivation, and that too cul- 
tivated in a more judicious manner. Such a quantity of grain 
and other kinds of produce is now raised in this district of coun- 
try, as to be sufficient for the supply of the inhalitants. The great 
distance from lime, it must however be acknowledged, is a great 
bar to the farther breaking up of waste land, or the successful cul- 
tivation of what has already been broken up. Manufactures have 
also been considerably increased during the last forty years; but 
are far from being yet carried to the extent to which they might 
be carried with advantage. The banks of the streams affird many 
eligible situations for impelling machinery by water. Coal and 
stone for building are cheap and abundant. It must be allowed, 
however, that the possession of the land by few proprietors is not fa- 
vourable to the calling forth of a spirit of enterprise, however great 
miay be the natural advantages. The distance from water carriage, 
and the thinly peopled state of the country, are also obstacles to 
the extensive establishment of manufactures in this parish, which 
do not exist in many other districts of the country.

PRESBYTERY OF PENPONT, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. JAMES RICHARDSON, MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — Chalmers, in his Caledonia, derives the name of this 
parish from the saint to whom the church was dedicated ; and the 
name Conel he considers as an abbreviation or corruption of Con- 
gel. 



KIRKCONNEL. 



315 



Extent, Boundaries.— The parish is bounded on the W. and 
N W by the parishes of New Cumnock and Auchinleck, in the 
county of Ayr; on the N. and N. E. by the parish of Crawford- 
john, in the county of Lanark ; on the S. S. E. and S. W. by the 
parish of Sanquhar. From east to west, the parish extends about 
8 miles, and from north to south, not less than 15 miles. 

Topographical Appearances.— On the right and left banks of the 
river Nith, there is a continued range of hills, irregularly formed, 
and of considerable height, distant from the river on each side about 
two or three miles, and affording excellent sheep pasture ; many of 
them capable of cultivation almost to the top. Upon crossing the 
ridge of these hills to the north and south, the soil becomes cold 
and swampy, or consists of a peat-moss covered with grass and 
heath, intersected by narrow valleys, deep ravines and winding rivu- 
lets. From the base of these hills towards the river, on both sides, 
there is a gentle slope. 

From the elevated situation of this parish, and the number and 
height of its hills, one might expect a moist and cold air, with late 
harvests and early frosts. The extensive draining, however, of the 
hill pasture, and the agricultural improvements which for a long 
time past have been going on, have completely prevented these ef- 
fects. The soil under cultivation is much diversified. It consists 
partly of a light gravelly mould, loam, clay, or mixture of moss and 
clay, and deep rich soil, especially on the holm lands upon the 
banks of the rivers. 

Minerals. — This parish abounds with coal of the very best de- 
scription, which some years ago was wrought to a considerable ex- 
tent ; but, with the exception of one coal pit for smith work, the 
present tacksman has removed his coal operations to the parish of 
Sanquhar, which is nearer the seat of general demand. Several 
beds of lime and ironstone have been found in the parish ; but 
no attempt of any consequence has been made to ascertain how far 
it would be profitable to proceed. 

Mineral Waters. — There are two mineral wells in this parish 
upon a farm called Rigg. The one is said to be of the same quality 
as the Kirkland spaw in Galloway ; and the other, called Riggburn, 
resembles Hartfield spaw near Moffat : but, in both instances, the 
water of this parish is the stronger. These wells are little re- 
sorted to, because they have been much neglected : but the water 
is often sent to very distant parts of the country.

II. — Civil Histouy. 

Eminent Men. — The late venerable and highly esteemed George 
Jardine, Esq. Professor of Logic in the University of Glasgow, was 
for a short time, in early life, parochial schoolmaster of Kirkcon- 
nel. The session minutes under his hand bear date 1759. A few 
years previous to his death, he visited this scene of his early la- 
bours, and such of his old friends as were then alive. He be- 
queathed for the behoof of the schoolmaster of Kirkconnel, in all 
time coming, the sum of L. 50, the interest of which was to be paid 
to him, and the capital laid out on the most advantageous terms. 

Antiquities, 8fc. — Of antiquities or natural curiosities, this parish 
cannot boast much, — except baptismal font stones, which are found 
in different parts. It is said that St Connel, who built the kirks 
of Kirkbride and Kirkconnel, was buried on the top of that range 
of hills called Glenwhurry ; but the writer never could discover the 
smallest vestige of the saint's grave. In the parish, there are se- 
veral cairns of stone, — some of which have been removedfor the 
purpose of building stone dikes, to save the expense of quarrying, 
and were found to contain a quantity of human bones f. 

III. — Population. 

In 1755, the population amounted to - - 899

1821, 1100 

1831, .... - nil 

The small increase of population during the periods above stated 
has in a great measure arisen from the recent division of the parish 
into more extensive farms, than formerly, — one farmer now occup}- 
ing the land which perhaps had been held by eight or ten farm- 
ers. The whole village holds of the Duke of Buccleuch ; but, no 
building feus having been granted, every householder is a tenant 
at will : he pays a small annual rent, and remains in undisturbed 
possession. 

" Archibald Macnab, Esq. merchant, laid out a considerable sum in improving 
and beautifying a small property in this parish which had belonged to his ancestors. 
During the greatest part of his life he was much engaged in mercantile transactions in 
Germany. While in the execution of his plans, he was overtaken by a storm, and perish- 
ed in the Elbe during the late war. In this part of the country, lie was much and 
deservedly respected, and tlie small property of KLolm. which belonged to him was sold 
and purchased by His Grace the Duke of Buccleuch. 

t A few years ago, when a road-maker was levelling down the sides of a gravel pit 
uoon a very small knoll, about 200 yards west from the bridge whicli is thrown 
over the river Nith at Kirkconnel village, he came upon an earthen urn of Roinnii 
fiibric, filled with human bones, which, upon being exposed to tlie air, were reduced 
to powder. The urn was broken to scvei al jiieces before he was aware.

Character of the People.— The eo\e of this parish, in general, 
are sober and industrious. Their character cannot be more ac- 
curately described than in the words of my late respected prede- 
cessor in his Statistical Account. " They are acute, deliberate, 
cool, steady, serious, and well acquainted with the principles of 
Christianity." In no case have they ever, even in turbulent timesj 
manifested a turbulent spirit; they have always shewn a loyal dis- 
position, and a readiness to submit to the laws of their country. 

IV. — Industry. 

By a late measurement, the number of acres belonging to His 
Grace the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry in this parish 
is as under, viz. 

A. R. P. 

Arable, . • • 0,091 1 10 

Low pasture, . • 542 0 14 

IliU pasture, . . 18,511 0 23

In roads, . • • 12 3 22 

Occupied by houses, . 48 0 37 

25,489 0 39 

The property of the other heritors in this parish does not ex- 
ceed 1000 acres in extent ; of which, from 300 to 400 are arable. 

Husbandry. — Aregular rotation of crop is observed by the tenants, 
in terms of their leases. An iron plough upon an improved plan 
is generally used. For seed, the red and early Angus oat is em- 
ployed ; and sometimes the potato oat is sown wliere the soil is 
considered suitable. Barley and wheat are seldom sown, on account 
of the great distance from a regular market. Sowing generally 
commences in the month of March, or as soon after as the weather 
permits. Harvest is generally finished by the middle of Septem- 
ber, and sometimes by the end of August. 

Upon each acre of green crop, the farmer generally lays down 
from thirty-five to sixty bolls of lime, with a proportional quantity of 
manure, such as the land requires ; and frequently, before breaking 
up pasture land, it is limed at the same rate ; and for every Scotch 
acre, eight bushels of seed oats are allowed. 

The expense of ploughing, sowing and harrowing an acre of 
land, amounts to about 15s. ; of weeding, reaping, carting home, 
thrashing, cleaning and carrying the produce to market, L.l, 14s. 6d.; 
and for tear and wear of farming utensils for do. annually, 6s. The 
average produce of an acre of land is about thirty-eight bushels. 

Cattle. — The cows which are kept for dairy purposes are all of 



318 



DUMFRIES«SHIRE. 



the Ayrshire or Cunninghambreed, and amount to about 560. Up- 
on good pasture, each cow is expected to produce from sixteen to 
eighteen stones of what is usually called Dunlop cheese ; but, as 
the pasture varies, the average may be fixed at twelve stones per 
cow. During the last eight years, cheese of the above description 
has varied in price from 7s. 6d. to 9s. 6d. per stone. The num- 
ber of followers or young cows is about 160, of which 113 are usu- 
ally reserved for keeping up the stock, and the remainder sold to 
dealers from the south, when rising three years old. About 113 
cows are either stall fed for the butcher, or sold as early caivers to 
cowfeeders ; or such as answer the purpose are kept through win- 
ter, and fed on grass the following summer for the butcher. 

Every milk cow, in many parts of this parish, requires from two 
to three acres of pasture, where the land has not been properly laid 
down, — also house feeding, which consists of clover and tares in the 
season, and turnips in autumn and at the end of the year. Dur- 
ing winter, each cow requires not less than 160 stones of hay, ge- 
nerally meadow. From the extensive agricultural improvements 
which have been made and are still going on in this parish, few 
or none of the west Highlanders or Galloway breed of cattle are 
grazed or fed in this parish for the English market as formerly. 

Sheep. — Most of the farms in this parish have a great quantity 
of hill pasture as well as arable land. The hills are stocked with 
sheep of the black-faced breed, — these being found more suitable 
for the climate than any other. Upon an average, the number 
of sheep kept in this parish, on the different farms, amounts to 
from 11,000 to 12,000. The number of lambs reared annually 
is about 7000, — of which 2000 are reserved for keeping up the stock, 
and the remainder carried to market, the average price of which, 
for seven years immediately preceding 1834, amounted to about 
L.5 per score; and the price of sheep for the above period, about 
L. 1 1 per score. Every score of sheep generally produces four stones 
of wool, which was sold, during the years stated, at 7s. per stone; 
but, in 1834, wool was greatly in demand, and prices exceedingly 
high and much beyond the real value. 

Every 600 sheep require a shepherd, who is generally allowed 
a certain number of sheep as part of his wages ; and such shepherds 
as are married, and do not live in the houses of their employers, are 
allowed, besides a number of sheep, pasture for one or two cows, 
a house, and a certain quantity of meal, — which in all may amount 



\ 



KIRKCONNEL. 



319 



to nearly L. 30 per annum. The expense of smearing a score of 
sheep may be about 5s. and pasturage L. 4 per annum. 

Rental-Heritors, c-c.-The rental of the property m this parish 
of the Duke of Buccleuch who is nearly the sole proprietor 
amounts to L. 4160, 7s. Gd; that of the other heritors, who are only 
four in number, does not exceed L. 450. The total valuation of 
the parish is 6964 merks Scots. 

Employmmts- Wages.-Wiih a very few exceptions, the working 
classes of the community are mostly employed in agricultural pur- 
suits or as day labourers. A few famiUes are employed in working 
coals in the adjoining parish, and may earn from Is. 8d. to 2s. per 
day. The latter are sober, industrious, well-behaved, and well-in- 
formed, and by no means of that description of character which is 
generally ascribed to their craft. As the time employed in their 
mining operations is not above six hours, they generally spend then- 
spare hours either in reading, or in working where they can find 
employment, in order to add a little more to their gains for the sup- 
port of their families. 

There are the following trades in the parish: masons, 2; tailors, 
6; shoemakers, 4; weavers, 15; stone-dikers, 8; blacksmiths, 
10; house-carpenters, 4; corn-miller, 1; innkeepers, 5; flesher, 
1 ; merchant, 1 ; cooper, 1. 

There are no pubhc works of any description within the parish, 
except an iron-plating forge, upon a very small scale, and employ- 
ing about eight or ten men in its various departments. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce yearly 
raised in the parish, as nearly as that can be ascertained, is as 
follows : 

Produce of grain of all kinds, including fodder, deducting seed, L. 7830 0 0 
Of potatoes, turnips, &amp;c. .... 1880 0 0 

Ofhay, \ . . . 1292 0 0

Gardens and orchards, . . • • 480 0 0 

Total yearly value of produce, L. 17,562 0 0 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication. — The roads are in a good state of 
repair ; but bridges are much wanted on the great public road in 
the upper district of this parish. A public coach runs daily through 
this parish from Glasgow to Carlisle, and from Carlisle to Glas- 

• A small portion of land, not amountingto more than three-fourths of an acre, was held 
under charter so far back as the year 1444; the reddendum of which " unus solidus 
monetiercgni Scotia;," is to be paid " ministro ministranti ad altare beat;c virginis;" 
and afterwards by dare, constat from Lord William Crichton of Sanquhar to the mi- 
nister of the parish and his successor in oiHcc.

gow, which both enhvensthe country, and alfords great accommoda- 
tion to the inhabitants of this district engaged in business, — as, 
by means of it, they can have daily access to any part of the 
kingdom. There is also a regular post daily from the south in 
the morning, and from the west in the afternoon. The letter-car- 
rier goes from Sanquhar, the post-town, to old Cumnock, every 
morning; and leaves the letter-bag at Kirkconnel in passing; 
and upon returning from Cumnock to Sanquhar he delivers his 
letter-bag here, and takes the post-bag for the departure of the 
post from Sanquhar to Dumfries. The present arrangement is 
good ; but, were a mail-coach to start from Dumfries via Thorn- 
hill, Sanquhar, Kirkconnel, New and Old Cumnocks, Ochiltree, 
Ayr, and Kilmarnock, there is every reason to believe the contrac- 
tors would be indemnified for their expense, and that district of 
country would receive much benefit. 

Ecclesiastical State.— this parish His Grace the Duke of Buc- 
cleuch and Queensberry is patron. The stipend amounts to 15 
chalders, at the county fiars' conversion, one-half meal and one-half 
barley, together with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. The 
glebe is of considerable extent, but of very inferior soil in many 
places ; and part of it is liable to be flooded in winter, by the melt- 
ing of snow from the overflowing of the Nith. There is abun- 
dance of free teinds. f 

The only Dissenters in the parish from our national church are 
Presbyterians under thediff'erentdemoninations of Cameronians and 
United Secession;— of the former, there are only two families, and 

» Chalmers, in his Caledonia, states, that the church of Kirkconnel at one time be- 
lono'ed to the abbot and monks of Holy wood, who held the rectorial revenues to then- 
own use, and a vicarage was established for the service of the church. In Bagimont s 
Roll, as it stood in the reign of James, the vicarage of Kirkconnel, m the deanery of 
Nith, was taxed with L. 3, 6s. 8d. At the epoch of the Refomation, the rectorial re- 
venues of the church of Kirkconnel were held by Lord Crichton of Sanquhar for 
the payment of the small sum L.20 Scots yearly, to the abbots and monks of Ho- 
lywood. Small, however, as this sum was, his Lordship withheld it for many years, 
and they were unable to enforce payment. After the Reformation the patronage and 
tithes of the church of Kirkconnel, with the other property of Holywood Abbey, were 
vested in the King, by the general annexation act, and granted to John Mui ray ot 
Lochmaben, Act Pari. iv. 373-665. In the reign of Charles IL the patronage of 
Kirkconnel was transferred to the Duke of Queensberry, and, upon the death of the 
last Duke William, came with a very princely property and title mto the Noble family 

of Buccleuch. , „ , . ,  • ■ u 

+ It appears that Mr John Carmichael was ejected from his charge of this pansh 
in 1 662, when Episcopacy was violently obtruded upon this kingdom. In the year 
1681, Mr Samuel Moat, the Episcopal incumbent, was also obliged to leave charge, 
because he could not take the oath required by the Test Act. Lrom tha pncKl, the 
vacancy was protracted until the year 1732. The present church was bu It in the year 
1729, and removed nearly two miles south from the site of the old 
centrical and convenient for the parish. Mr Peter Rac, then "'"f'' fj.  ' '"j. 
within the presbytery of Pont, was admitted minister of Kirkconnel, and iansl, ot 
Kirkbride suppressed, and divided betwixt the parishes of Sanquhar and Duiisdctr.

of the latter, six or seven. The inhabitants are much attached to 
tlie Estabhshecl Church, and are a church-going people. 

A few years after the induction of the present incumbent, which 
took place in 1803, the present church was considerably enlarged 
for the accommodation of the villagers. Since that time, the church, 
manse, and offices have undergone complete repair, and at present, 
perhaps, there is not a more comfortable place of worship within 
the county. The offices were rebuilt, and are in good condition. 

Education.— Besides the parochial, there are at present several 
private schools in the parish ; and the number of scholars who at- 
tend these different seminaries, and were present at the annual 
examination, amounted to 159 : but the average number during the 
year may amount to 170. The branches of education taught are 
only Enghsh, writing, and arithmetic. The Scriptures are regular- 
ly read, and the children daily repeat the Shorter and other Ca- 
techisms usually taught in schools ; and weekly, they recite portions 
of Scripture. The salary of the parochial schoolmaster is the 
minimum, with a good house and garden ; he has, besides, the in- 
terest of different small sums of money, for which he is to teach 
one or two orphan children when any are in the parish, or such 
whose parents are so indigent as not to be able to pay the school 
fees, which are extremely moderate. The fees which he actually 
receives may amount to L. 30 per annum. 

Poor. — The most necessitous of the poor receive some supply 
in aid of their own industry, from the weekly collections made in 
the church, which annually amount to from L. 16 to L. 20. This, 
too-ether with a small sum laid out at interest, is all that can be 
calculated upon for their relief. There is no assesment for paro- 
chial relief, nor is there any occasion for it. The farmers are ex- 
tremely attentive to the poor, by occasionally sending meal and 
potatoes to be distributed by the session among them ; and the 
heritors occasionally send donations for the same purpose. The 

" In the year 1817, when markets were very high and provisions scarce — and when 
many of the labouring class, from the rate of wages, were unable to procure support 
for themselves and families, a parochial subscription was voluntarily entered into, 
aided by the resident and non-resident heritors; by means of which, afundwas rais- 
ed to a considerable amount, with which provisions were purchased, at a considerable 
distance, by farmers in the parisli, and brought by them free of expense. Such of 
them as had any stock of meal or potatoes for sale, reserved the same for the behoof 
of the parish. By this means, a store of provisions was formed; and a committee of 
management was appointed, who met weekly to consider the cases of the applicants; 
and from the representations laid before them, instructed their store-keeper to give 
out a certain quantity of provisions gratis, to the most necessitous ; to others at re- 
duced prices, according to their circumstances ; and such as could afibrd to pay re- 
ceived the article at prime cost. The quantity of meal served out and sold, as above 
stated, amounted to 1950 stones, besides potatoes and pot-barley, within the space of

average number of persons receiving parochial aid is 10 ; and the 
average yearly allowance to each L. 1, 4s. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
In the former Statistical Account of this parish, it is stated, that 
there were then not 700 acres under the plough ; and now there 
are no less than 6391 acres, 1 rood, 10 poles, fit for every purpose 
of husbandry. Still, however, there is a great want of shelter and 
enclosures with belts of planting judiciously laid down. In the 
measurement of his Grace's property in this parish, it is stated 
that there are upwards of 178 acres under wood; but that wood 
consist chiefly of brush and sproutings of trees formerly cut down, 
and is confined to the sides of deep ravines and the banks of the 
diff'erent rivers. The valuable part of the wood, many years ago, 
was set up to public sale by order of the late William Duke of 
Queensberry; and the purchasers were not required, by the arti- 
cles of sale, to enclose the wood, so as to preserve the young shoots 
from being destroyed by the sheep or black cattle. No doubt, 
in some places, these young shoots have got the superiority over 
their enemies ; yet there is not a single tree of any considerable 
value within that portion of this parish which originally belonged to 
his Grace. The present Noble proprietor, however, has done much, 
and is still going on improving his princely property in Nithsdale, 
by planting, draining, and enclosing, and by erecting commodious 
farm-houses and offices to his numerous tenants. These improve- 
ments first commenced near his own residence at Drumlanrig Castle ; 
but, from the great progress which has been made, there is every 
reason to hope that his Grace will soon carry them into this upper 
district; and, when these are once completed, it may be safely 
asserted, that there will be few more pleasant country districts, 
or more delightful tours than from Dumfries by the bank of the 
Nith to New Cumnock in Ayrshire. More than twenty miles of 
that road, without intersection, passes through his Grace's property. 
When these improvements shall have been completed, many of the 
disadvantages arising from an unfriendly chmate will be removed. 
For the advancement of agriculture, every facility is afforded by good 
roads, and a constant supply of hme from Ayrshire, about six miles 
distant from the centre of this parish. In the north-east district, 
there is a regular supply of lime during summer from the farm of 

six months, the time required. In consequence of this plan, the needy were well 
supilied with wholesome food, and, upon closing the whole concern, the suiri neces- 
sary for reducing the price of provisions was found to be not much to every individual 
contributor.

Kirkconnel. The road to that hmework, at present, is not in good 
repair; but in the course of a few years, it is expected that that 
district of the parish will be completely opened up with excellent 
roads, sufficient to convey the mail-coach and carriages of every 
description from Portpatrick to Edinburgh and Glasgow, by con- 
necting it with a new line of road already made in Galloway. From 
the survey and measurement taken, it is said, that the above line 
will shorten the distance about thirty miles.

PRESBYTERY OF PENPONT, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES AND GALLOWAY. 

THE REV. GEORGE WALLACE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Sj-c. — Durisdeer probably derives its name from Duris, 
which signifies a door, and deer, a forest, — so that Durisdeer may 
mean the door of the forest, or the opening to and from the forest. 
It is well known that this district was in former times entirely co- 
vered with wood. 

Extent — Boundaries. — The parish is fully 8 miles in length; 
about 6 in breadth ; and contains 28 square miles. It is bound- 
ed on the N. W. by the parish of Sanquhar; on the S. W. and 
W. by the parish of Penpont ; on the N. N. E. and E. by the parish 
of Crawford ; and on the S. and S. E. by the parish of Morton. 

Topographical Appearances.— -Ow the east side of the parish, next 
the march of Clydesdale, there is one range of mountains which 
runs from the N. E. towards the S. by the S. W. The highest 
point of the range is the Lowthers, which is 3130 feet above the 
level of the sea. The temperature of the atmosphere is rather cold. 
The climate is generally dry, and consequently healthy. 

Besides the Nith, which runs through this parish, there are five 
considerable burns or waters in the parish, viz. the Enterkin, the 
Carron, the Hapland, the Maarburn, and the burn at Crarie Knoll. 

The rocks of which the hills are composed, are commonly called 
whin, the greywacke of geologists ; and the plain or low land is of 



324 DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 

sandstone of a red colour, and very soft. The soil in general is 
deep and fertile, in many places inclining to a reddish colour. 
There is some wet heavy land, but in general it is dry, and in some 
places gravelly and sandy ; the greatest part is of a loamy nature. 

II. — Civil History. 
Ancient Families. — Mr Crawford, in his History of the Family 
of Stuart, tells us, that James, High Steward of Scotland, was mar- 
ried to Dunbar, daughter to the Earl of March, then one of the 
most potent famihes in Scotland, by whom he had Walter, his son 
and heir, and James, who obtained from King Robert Bruce the 
barony of Durisdeer. It was afterwards possessed by one of that 
name, who is designed Sir Robert Stuart of Durisdeer ; but what 
relation he bore to the said James, whether he was lineally de- 
scended from him, or was only a singular successor, is uncertain. 
Indeed, Sir James Dalrymple, in his Collection, says, I think this 
" Sir Robert hath been the son of James Stuart, formerly men- 
tioned, for I find a charter by King Robert II. to Robert Stuart 
of Inermath of the barony of Durisdeer." The family of Rosyth 
was lineally descended from the said James Stuart. Their mansion- 
house was the Castlehill, which appears to have been a very strong 
place, especially before the use of fire-arms. It was situated at 
the bottom of a steep hill,- on the north-east, and had a deep fosse 
on the south-west side, and could easily have been surrounded with 
water ; and therefore most probably it was built by the government 
for public service, in defence of the country against its enemies, 
especially against the English . Immediately before the place 
went into the family of Queensberry, it belonged to Menzies of 
Castlehill. 

Family of Queensberry. — The first charter of the family of 
Queensberry was granted by James Earl of Douglas, Lord of Lid • 
desdale and Drumlanrig, to William Douglas, his son, in which he 
gives him the hail lands and barony of Drumlanrig, to be holden 
blench of his Lordship, for serving as a knight in his army. This 
charter is sealed but not dated ;— wherefore, after the said Earl's de- 
cease, John Swinton Lord of Mar, and Margaret Countess of Dou- 
glas and Mar, his spouse, by their letter on parchment, dated the 5th 
of December 1389, with one consent and assent, promise never to 

• Hector Boetius, in his History of Scotland, mentions, that when King David 
Bruce, who had been taken at the battle of Durham, and kept nearly eleven years 
prisoner in England, was ransomed and restored, this castle of Durisdeer, as also the 
castles of Dumfries, Dalswinton, and Morton were, upon a pacUon betwixt the l.ng- 
lisli and Scots, demolished, because they were found troublesome to the linglisli.

quarrel nor trouble the said William Douglas, son to the said um- 
quhill Earl, in his possession of the lands and barony of Drumlan- 
rio-. There is also a charter or letter of confirmation, dated Croy- 
don, the last day of November 1412, written by King James the 
First, under his seal or signet, confirming to Sir William Douglas 
of Druralanrig, Knight, all the lands he was possessed and charter- 
ed of. The privy-council of Scotland confirmed this charter in 
favour of William Earl of Queensberry and his heirs, by their 
act, dated at Edinburgh the 2d day of February 1639. The 
first of this family who arrived at the degree of nobihty orjpeer- 
age was William, the eldest son of Sir James Douglas of Drum- 
lanrig, Knight. Upon the 20th of July 1603, he married Lady 
Isobel, daughter of Mark Lord Newbattle, by whom he had three 
sons and a daughter. 

This William, upon a commission from the Chancery in the year 
1615, was served heir to three of his predecessors, who were knights, 
Sir James Douglas his father. Sir William his grandfather, and 
Sir James his great-grandfather. By a patent, dated 1st April 
1628, he was created Viscount of Drumlanrig, and Lord Douglas 
of Hawick and Tibbers. And by another patent, 13th June 1633, 
he was created Earl of Queensberry, Viscount of Drumlanrig, 
Lord Douglas of Hawick and Tibbers. And by a charter under 
the Great Seal of Scotland, dated 7th July 1636, in the twelfth year 
of King Charles the First, in favour of William Earl of Queens- 
berry in liferent, and James Lord Drumlanrig, his son and his heirs 
in fee, of the earldom and estates of Queensberry, the same are 
of new erected into one whole and free earldom, lordship, barony, 
regality, &amp;c. to be called then and in all time thereafter the Earl- 
dom of Queensberry and Lordship of Drumlanrig. 

James, the Second Earl of Queensberry, upon the 3d June 
1630, married Lady Mary Hamilton, who, shortly after, died with- 
out issue. He was married again on the 26th March 1635, to 
Lady Margaret Stuart, daughter of John the great Earl of Tra- 
quair, by whom he had two sons and five daughters. William, 
the third Earl of Queensberry, upon the 8th of October 1657, 
married Lady Isobel Douglas, daughter of William Marquis of 
Douglas, by whom he had three sons and a daughter. 

By a patent, dated the 11th of February 1682, he was created 
Marquis of Queensberry, Earl of Drumlanrig and Sanquhar, Vis- 
count of Nith, Torthorwald, and Ross, Lord Douglas of Kinmount, 
Middlebie, and Dornock; and by another patent, 3d November 



326 DUMFRIES-SHIRE. I 

1684, he was created Duke of Queensberry, Marquis of Dum- I 
fries-shire, Earl of Drumlanrig and Sanquhar, Viscount of Nith, 
Torthorwald, and Ross, Lord Douglas of Kinmount, Middlebie, 
and Dornock. Duke William died at Edinburgh 1695. 

James, the Second Duke of Queensberry, married lady Mary 
Boyle, daughter of the Earl of Burlington, by whom he had three ; 
sons. He was honoured by Queen Anne to be her Majesty's High 
Commissioner to the Parliament of Scotland, which agreed upon , 
the articles of Union with England, anno 1707; and by her he was  
afterwards created Duke of Dover, Marquis of Beverly, and Baron I 
of Rippon. He died at London the 6th of July 1711.  

Charles, the third Duke of Queensberry and second of Dover, 
born at Edinburgh 1700, married Lady Catherine Hyde, daughter 
of Henry Earl of Rochester, by whom he had two sons and a daugh- 
ter. Duke Charles died on the 22d October 1778, without any 
issue surviving him, and was succeeded by William Earl of March, 
who enjoyed his property and titles till his death in 1810, when 
the Duke of Buccleuch succeeded as heir of line and entail. 

Family ofMenzies of Enoch. — Among the ancient families in the 
parish of Durisdeer, that of Menzies of Enock is considerable. The 
barony of Enock lies on the east of Drumlanrig, betwixt Nith and , 
Carron ; and the mansion-house stood on a point of the ground i 
betwixt a deep ravine and Carron. On the lintel of the gateway was \ 
carved the year 1281. James Menzies of Enock was married to 
Catherine Douglas, daughter of Colonel William Douglas, second 
son of William Douglas, the first Earl of Queensberry. He dis- ' 
poned to his eldest son James, who had then got a captain's com- I 
mission, the barony of Enock, with the reservation of his own and  
his lady's liferent of some part of it; and his son Captain James 
sold it to James Duke of Queensberry anno 1703, and bought the 
estate of Stenhouse. 

Family of Hunter of Bala/an.— Another ancient family in this 
parish was that of Hunter of Balagan, who was also proprietor of 
Drumcroul, and some say of Auchensel. The house stood two 
miles north-west from Drumlanrig, on the west side of the Maar- j 
burn. As to the antiquity of this family, it is reported, with what | 
truth I know not, that, when King Robert Bruce was lying with ; 
the Scottish army near Glenwharne, and the English army at the i 
moat in Balagan Holm, a man named Hunter, carrying a trumpet, 
and another, named M'Gachen, bearing a pair of colours, came 
from the Scotch army to the head of the glen called Balagan ; 



1 



DURISDEER. 



327 



and that the one blew his trumpet, and the other flourished his co- 
lours in sio-ht of the English army, who, apprehending that the 
Scottish force were immediately upon them, were so much affright- 
ed, that they fled out of the country. For which achievement, 
Kino- Robert gave Hunter the lands of Balagan, and to M'Gachen 
the Tands of Dalwhat. If this tradition be true, the family of Bala- 
gan would appear to be a very old one. The last of them, it is 
said, usually contended with James Menzies of Enock for prece- 
dency. But the family is now extinct. It terminated with three 

daughters, one of whom was married to  Hunter, of Polmood, 

in Tweeddale ; another to James Graham, of Shaw, in the parish 
of Hutton, in Annandale; and the third to WiUiam Charteris, of 
Brigmoor, Commissary of Dumfries. 

Families of Douglas ofDalveen and Douglas of Cashogle.—Tvio 
other ancient families who had their estates and residences in the 
parish of Durisdeer, were Douglas of Dalveen and Douglas of Cash- 
ogle. They were both cadets of the house of Drumlanrig. All 
these lands are now in the possession of the noble family of Queens- 
berry. 

There are only three other land-owners in the parish ; and their 
properties are small. 

Parochial Register. — The date of the earliest entry in the parish 
register is 20th July 1758. It was formerly kept very irregularly. 

Antiquities. — About a mile above the church, in the wall path, 
there are the vestiges of a Roman camp, which appears to have 
been a summer station connected with the great one at Tibbers, to 
guard the pass from Lanarkshire. A Roman road passed along 
the wall path referred to into Crawford moor to Biggar. 

The castle of Drumlanrig, built about the end of the seventeenth 
century, is the only mansion-house, if so it may be called, in the 
parish.

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Economy. — 

Number of acres in the parish, cultivated or occasionally in tillage, - 7896 

never cultivated, being hill pasture, - 9554 

under wood, 500 of which are natural, - 2000 

' All kinds of trees are planted, but principally hard wood, and 
they are so arranged that in the thinning they shall finally consist 
of oak only. 

Rent of Land, c. — L. 1 is the average rent of arable land. 
The rent of grazing an ox or cow is L. 4 ; and a ewe or full-grown 
sheep 4s. for the year. 

Stock, 4-c. — The common breeds of sheep are the black-faced; 
and of cattle, the Galloway. The duration of leases is nineteen 
years. The farm-buildings are good, having been built within the 
last two years ; and the enclosures are now in the course of being 
rebuilt. 

There are no quarries but such as have been opened for the 
material to build farm-steadings : the stone is in general red sand- 
stone, very soft ; in one or two instances it is white and much harder. 

Produce. — The gross amount of raw produce raised in the parish 
is as follows : 

Grain, - . - - L. 6895 
Potatoes and tiu-nips, - 1921 

Hay, meadow and cultivated, - 3373 
In pasture, - - _ - 2865 

Annual thinning of plantations, 200 

Total yearly value of produce, - L. 1 5254 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Towns, — There are no market or other towns in the 
parish. The nearest is Dumfries, which is twenty miles distant. There 
is only one village. No post-office. The length of turnpike roads 
in the parish is six miles. One stage-coach travels, through the 
parish to Glasgow every lawful day, and one to Edinburgh three 
times a-week. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church is very inconveniently 
situated, being on the very east side of the parish. It was budt ni 
1720, and is not at present in a good state of repair. It affords 



DURISDEER. 



329 



accommodation for 350 persons, and all the sittings are free. The 
manse was built in 1763, and repaired partially in 1826. The 
extent of the glebe is 22 acres, and, with the manse and garden, 
may be L. 30 per annum in value. The stipend is 15 chalders 
of victual, one-half meal, the other barley, with L. 100 Scots for 
communion elements. The average amount of the stipend yearly 
is L. 240. The number of families attending the Established 
Church is 206, and divine service is in general well attended. The 
average number of communicants is 260. The number of fami- 
lies attending the chapel of Dissenters and Seceders is 85. 

Education.— Theve are two parochial schools and two private : 
branches taught are, Latin and Greek, Enghsh, writing, arith- 
metic, and book-keeping. The salaries of the parochial teachers 
are, L. 30, Is. 6d. and L. 24, 12s. and the yearly amount of fees 
paid to each may be L. 10. One of the parochial schoolmasters 
has the legal accommodations ; the other has neither a dwelling- 
house nor school-house. 

Pooi\ — There are, at present, 17 persons receiving parochial aid. 
The highest sum allowed per annum is L. 4, and the lowest L. 1. 
The annual amount for the support of the poor is L. 40 ; of which 
sum L. 24 arise from church collections, and the remainder from 
mortifications for the behoof of the poor. A disposition to refrain 
from seeking parochial relief certainly prevails. 

Inns, 8fc. — There are five houses licensed to sell spirits. 

Fuel. — Coal is principally used for fuel, though some occasion- 
ally use peat. The coal is procured at Sanquhar, at 7s. or 8s. 
per cart load — about ten hundred weight. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The improved mode of agriculture, the new farm-steadings, the 
enclosures, and the increased facilities of internal communication 
by roads and bridges, are the most striking differences betwixt 
the present state of the parish and that which existed at the time 
of the former Statistical Account.

PRESBYTERY OF PENPONT, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. JOHN BROWN, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Najne, Boundaries, Sc. — Glencairn, whose ancient orthogra- 
phy was Glencarne, seems to be compounded of Glen, which in the 
Erse signifies a valley, and Cairn, a collection of stones ; the name 
corresponds exactly with the appearance of the parish, and seems to 
refer to the great hollow along which the river flows. The parish 
is about 15 miles long, and about 3 miles broad, and consequently 
extends to 52 square miles. It is bounded on the south by the 
parish of Dunscore ; by Balmaclellan and Dairy on the west ; by 
Tynron on the north ; and Keir on the east ; and is of a rectan- 
gular figure. 

Topographical Appearances, 8fc. — There are many ranges of 
hills in the parish, most of which run nearly from west to east. 
The upper ranges are mostly covered with heath, but the greater 
proportion afford excellent green pasture. The valleys are in a 
high state of cultivation, and produce luxuriant crops of all the 
sorts of grain cultivated in this country. The height of the highest 
hills varies from 1000 to 1500 feet above the level of the sea. 
There are three valleys in the upper district of the parish, each ex- 
tending to about six miles in length, which meet at the village of 
Minnyhive ; and a fourth of greater breadth, which extends seven 
miles towards the lower end of the parish. The hills are chiefly 
of the transition class of rocks, and their appearance is charac- 
teristic of that series. 

The parish, from its proximity to high hills on the west, is fre- 
quently visited with such copious rains as sometimes to inundate 
the low grounds, and occasion considerable damage in the harvest 
months : and in general the atmosphere is moist. The climate, 
however, is mild and salubrious, and the people in general healtliy. 
Ili/drof/raphy. — On the farm of Lochurr, there is a lake which 



GLENCAIRN.

is the source of the river of that name. Its greatest depth is about 
4 or 5 fathoms, and its circumference about 3 miles ; it abounds 
with pike and a large species of trout. The water has a black 
appearance, as the neighbouring ground abounds with moss. The 
scenery has a bleak aspect, all the hills around being covered with 
heath. In this parish, there are the following waters, all taking their 
rise from the high hills on the west, viz. Castlefairn, Craigdarroch, 
and Dalwhat, which all meet a little below the village of Minnyhive. 
When united, they assume the name of Cairn. The Cairn flows 
in a south-east direction, till it unites with the Nith, about a mile 
above Dumfries, seven miles distant from the Solway Frith. The 
length of each of the three waters above-mentioned, till they form 
the Cairn, may be 6 or 7 miles ; and the Cairn runs about 16 
miles till it joins the Nith. 

II.— Civil History. 
Land-oivners.— Sir Robert Lawrie, Bart, of Maxwellton ; Ro- 
bert Cutlar Ferguson, Esq. of Craigdarroch, now M. P. for the 
stewartry of Kirkcudbright ; John Walker, Esq. of Crawfordton ; 
and Gilbert Collow, Esq. of Auchenchain, are the chief heritors ; 
and there are upwards of 30 smaller proprietors whose rentals may 
be stated at from L. 600 to L. 50. 

Parochial Registers. — The earliest register is one of births and 
marriages, and commences in 1693 ; with a variety of deficiences, 
it has been continued to the present time. 

Antiquities. — There is a tumulus commonly called the moat, about 
half a mile from the church, which, in Grose's Antiquities of Scot- 
land, is called the Bow Butts, and, as is generally supposed, was em- 
ployed as a place for the exercise of archery. There is a cross in the 
centre of the village of Minnyhive, made of freestone, about 14 feet 
high, consisting of a pillar about 9 feet high, rising from a circular 
pedestal about five feet high, — which, from its date, appears to have 
been erected in 1638. A charter was granted about the same time, 
constituting the village of Minnyhive a burgh of barony, with power 
to hold a weekly market. 

Modern Buildings. — A monument was erected in 1828 to the 
memory of the Rev. James Renwick, the last of the martyrs, who 
was executed at Edinburgh in 1688. This monument is situated 
within a quarter of a mile of the village of Minnyhive, upon rising 
ground, about 100 yards from the place where he is supposed to 
have been born. It is about 25 feet high, and built of hewn stone ; 
it cost nearly L. 100, which were raised by subscription.

The increase since 1801 may be ascribed to the improvements 

which have been made upon the land, and the influx of strangers into 

the villages of Minnyhive and Dunreggan, — who have become 

feuars.

Rent of Land.—Oi the 7000 acres of arable land, 2000 may 
be estimated at L. 1, 10s. per acre ; 2000 acres at L. 1 per acre; 
and 3000 acres at 15s. per acre : total amount L. 7250. Average 
rent of grazing per ox, L. 2 per annum ; per cow, L. 5 ; per ewe, 4s. 

Husbandry.— The mode of husbandry generally pursued is that 
of the sixth and seventh rotations. The first crop is always oats ; 
second, potatoes or other green crop ; third, generally barley; 
fourth, rye-grass, to be cut for hay, then pastured from one to three 
years. The improvement of which this appears susceptible, would 
be — to cultivate fewer potatoes and more turnips, the same to be 
eaten down with sheep, and also what rye-grass could be. spared 
from the horses,— the ground being generally of a light gravelly soil, 
and consequently well adapted for that system of management. 

The only land in the parish that can be reclaimed with advan- 
tage, is generally high and covered with heath, bent, or breckans; 

• The registering of births is sometimes neglected by the poorer classes.

and the general course of improvement pursued, is to lime it for 
one or two years before, at the rate of fifty measures or six carts 
per acre, or by laying the same quantity upon it when it is ploughed 
up. If the first plan be followed, a crop is generally taken the year 
in which it is ploughed; if the second, nottill the ensuing year; next, 
a green crop, when the ground is sufficiently broken to admit of its 
being taken,— otherwise, a second crop of oats ; after the green crop, 
another crop of oats, and sown out with two bushels of rye-grass seed 
and six pound of rib-grass per acre, or the same quantity of clover 
seed. 

Draining used formerly to be done in a very insufficient manner ; 
but of late years, there has been a very great improvement in this 
respect, as the drains both upon the sheep pasture and on the 
low lands, are now generally made in a more scientific manner. 

Irrigation has only been tried on a small scale, but with the us- 
ual beneficial results. Embanking the river Cairn has been car- 
ried to a very considerable extent, and most judiciously, both on 
the estates of Maxwellton and Crawfordton. Leases are generally 
for fifteen years. 

Many of the principal heritors have expended large sums, of late, 
in improving their estates, — particularly Sir Robert Lawrie, who 
has erected excellent new farm-steadings upon all the farms of his 
estate; and his whinstone dikes are surpassed by none. He has also 
been most successful in improving moss, which must have repaid 
him well by the immense crops of oats, carrots, and hay, which the 
improvement has yielded. 

Robert C. Ferguson, Esq. of Craigdarroch, has planted to a 
greater extent than any proprietorin the parish; and the plantations 
are laid out so as to ornament the estate. They are well managed, 
and are in a very thriving condition. 

We may safely state, that improvement has not been obstructed 
in this parish by the want of capital : during the last fifty years, 
the arable land has been more than quadrupled. 

A large proportion of the land is in the hands of resident pro- 
prietors ; and where let, the leases are generally on liberal terms. 
The farms are well enclosed and subdivided with stone dikes, and 
the steadings are, in general, sufficient. 

Quarries and Mines, — There is a slate-quarry atBenbuie, which 
the proprietor, Mr Barber, wrought for some years with considerable 
spirit, but which he afterwards abandoned, in consequence of the 
slates proving of an inferior quality. 



334 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



There are the remains of a mine at Caitloch, which is sirpposed 
to have been wrought for lead at a very distant period ; but at pre- 
sent, there is nothing which indicates that lead has ever been found, 
or that it ever existed there.

We have stated the net rental, as it was found extremely diffi- 
cult to give an accurate account of the gross amount of raw pro- 
duce raised in the parish. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-totvn, — The nearest market-town is Dumfries, dis- 
tant from the centre of the parish fifteen miles. There is one 
daily post to Minnyhive. The length of the turnpike road in this 
parish amounts to about eighteen miles : and a coach affords a 
communication three times a-week between Dumfries and Glas- 
gow, passing through the whole length of the parish. There are 
four bridges upon the turnpike line, all in good order, and six other 
bridges upon the parish roads. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is well situated for the 
convenience of the greater part of the population, being distant 
from the extremities of the parish seven miles and a-half. It is 
uncertain when it was built. It was repaired about twenty-one 
years ago, but it is still far from being comfortable. The church 
affords accommodation for between 500 and 600 sitters : and the 
heritors have agreed to erect a new church to contain accommo- 
dation for 1050 sitters. The manse was built about fifty-eight years 
ago, and since that time, it has undergone several partial repairs. 
The offices belonging to it are at present in a very bad state. The 
glebe extends to 12 acres of good arable ground, whose value may 
be stated at L. 2 per acre per annum. The stipend amounts to 
L. 280, 7s., including L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements : the 
teinds were exhausted at the last augmentation, dated 24th Janu- 
ary 1821. 

There is one Dissenting meeting-house, belonging to the United 
Secession church, — the minister of which is paid by his hearers, 
and his stipend may amount to L. 90 per annum. The number 



GLENCAIRN. 



335 



of families attending the Established Church amounts to 330, 
and the number of persons of all ages attached to the Established 
Church may amount to nearly 1500. The number of families con- 
nected with the Dissenting meeting-house in this parish, and two 
other Dissenting meeting-houses in a neighbouring parish, is about 
111 ; and the number of persons of all ages attached to them, 
nearly 600. The average number of communicants at the Esta- 
blished Church is about 600. 

Education.— There are five schools in this parish,— of which three 
are parochial and two unendowed. Latin and Greek are taught 
at the parochial schools. The joint salaries of the parochial school- 
masters amount to L. 51, 6s. 8d. The first and second may re- 
ceive each L. 20 a-year of fees; and the third L. 14. This sum 
is unequally divided amongst the teachers ; — the first having L. 25, 
13s. 4d. ; the second, L. 17, 2s. 2d., and the third, L. 8, lis. Id. 
As the heritors pay the maximum salary none of the teachers can 
claim a dwelling-house. 

Libraries. — There are two subscription libraries in the village 
of Minnyhive, and a congregational one belonging to the Dissenters. 

Poor. — The yearly amount of collections at the Established 
Church is L. 45; but besides this, the heritors have for a number 
of years past raised a voluntary contribution of L. 50 per annum. 
These sums, together with the interest of L. 300 of mortified money, 
are found requisite for the support of the poor, who are very nu- 
merous. There are upwards of 30 paupers, who receive from, 
Is. 6d. to 2s. per week. 

Fairs, Sfc. — There are three fairs held yearly at Minnyhive, in 
the months of March, July, and October, for the purpose of hir- 
ing servants for the half year, and for the hay and harvest seasons., 
A new market for lambs was established this year. From the 
quantity of stock exhibited, and the concourse of people who at- 
tended, it promises to succeed. 

Inns. — There are five inns in this parish, and several alehouses, 
but their effects upon the morals of the people have not been con- 
sidered hurtful. 

Fuel. — The fuel used in this parish consists mostly of peat and 
coal. The former is distant about four miles, and the latter six- 
teen miles; the expense of peat is about 5s. per cart load, and of 
coal about 10s. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The most striking alterations which have taken place, in this 



336 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



parish, since the former Statistical Account was written, consist 
principally in the improvement of the houses belonging to the pro- 
prietors, — the superior accommodation afforded to the tenants, — the 
improved mode of cultivation, — and the excellent state of the roads. 
The villages of Minnyhive and Dunreggan have also been greatly 
enlarged, and the houses which have been built are of a superior 
description. The distance from coal and water carriage will for 
ever prevent the possibility of this parish becoming a manufactur- 
ing district of any importance.

PRESBYTERY OF DUMFRIES, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. ROBERT BRYDEN, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish is 12 miles in length, but 
of a very irregular breadth, varying from 3 miles to less than 
half a mile. It is narrowest near the centre, being straitly con- 
fined betwixt the parishes of Glencairn on the north, and Holy- 
wood on the south ; and has been said, .with some propriety, to re- 
semble the shape of a sand-glass. It lies in a direction nearly east 
and west. The mean breadth is about 2 miles, and consequently 
the whole surface extends to about 24 square miles, or perhaps 
23. It is bounded, on the west, by the loch and water of Urr 
and parish of Kirkpatrick Durham; on the south, by the parish of 
Holywood ; on the east, by the river Nith, dividing it from Kirk- 
mahoe ; and on the north, by the parishes of Glencairn and Keir. 

Topographical Appearances. — The parish of Dunscore consists 
chiefly of three valleys or glens with their enclosing hills, all diverg- 
ing from the village of Cottack, in the various directions of west, 
east, and north. This village itself, which contains the parish church, 
stands upon elevated ground, and the church is seen at a consider- 
able distance in all directions. The country is more open on the 
east, being beautified by the river Nith and its fertile holms. The 
most extensive of the glens is that towards the west, called Glen- 



DUNSCORE. 



337 



slin, whicli is 4 miles long, and becomes very rocky and barren in 
the upper extremity. The hills enclosing this glen rise to a conside- 
rable height, and that called " Bogrie-hil 1," which is the most ele- 
vated in the whole neighbourhood, is at least 1200 feet above the 
level of the Solway Frith, from which it is about fifteen miles distant. 

Meteorologrj— Climate, -c— There is a considerable difference 
of temperature betwixt the eastern or lower, and the western or upper 
district of the parish. In the former, harvest is earher by a week or 
ten days, and the cold in winter is not nearly so intense, which may 
be accounted for by the land being not only less elevated, but bet- 
ter sheltered by intervening hills, from exposure to the prevailing 
westerly winds. The climate is very variable, from alternations 
both of heat and moisture ; but no register of the state of the at- 
mosphere has been kept in the district. The weather, however, is 
very seldom foggy. The most prevailing wind is from the west, 
which is frequently attended with rain. Sea fowl are often seen 
previous to a severe storm, and are regarded as a sure indication of it. 
In the winter of 1823, during a heavy fall of snow, a flock of Nor- 
wegian swans were seen in this parish, and one of them was caught 
in a drain on the estate of Allanton. 

The most common diseases of this district are affections of the 
lungs, stomach, and liver. Rheumatism is also a very general com- 
plaint among the poor and the aged, but fevers and agues, which 
prevailed forty years ago, are now very rare. Inflammations, how- 
ever, are frequent. 

Hydrography. — The river Nith passes along the eastern extre- 
mity of the parish for two miles. The Cairn, which is tributary 
to the Nith, crosses the parish near its centre, running in a direc- 
tion south by west. This is a faster flowing stream than the Nith, 
and after heavy rains, or the dissolving of upland snows, comes down 
with great rapidity, affecting its lowest fords in the course of a few 
hours. Dalgoner Bridge erected over the Cairn is 80 feet in span, 
which is about the greatest breadth of the river. The Cairn rises 
among the hills of Balmaclellan or Dairy,  in the stewartry of 
Kirkcudbright, and runs through the parishes of Glencairn, Dun- 
score, Holywood, and Irongray, in which last it is joined by another 
stream called the Clouden, which, although much smaller, communi- 
cates Its name to the united waters of the Cairn and itself, from 
the point of junction, till they fall into the Nith, a few miles below. 

» The name Cairn is only applieil, from the village of Minnyliive downwards, to 
the river wliicli is formed at that village, by the junction of the three separate streams 
of Dalrjuhat, Craigdarroch, and Castlefairn,— Dalquhat having its source in Glen 
cairn, Craigdarroch in Carscphairn, and Castlefairn in Balmaclellan or Dairy. 



338 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



There is a reason assigned, however, for the name of the larger 
stream having merged into that of the smaller. For according to 
tradition, the Cairn once pursued a different course, and did not mix 
its waters with the Clouden at all. Instead of passing through the pa- 
rishes of Holywood and Irongray, it is supposed to have passed 
through Dunscore in an easterly direction down the glen of the 
Lag, and to have fallen into the Nith several miles higher up than 
the Clouden. And it is a presumption in favour of this tradition, 
that the Clouden is still called the " Auld water" of Clouden. 

Mineralogy, — The upper district of this parish consists of tran- 
sition rocks, among which, in the higher grounds towards the 
western boundary, many large boulders, and occasionally blocks of 
granite, occur. The secondary strata, composed of red sand- 
stone, commence in the lower division of the parish, about two 
miles from the eastern boundary, and continue to traverse the county 
in the direction of Dumfries, passing into Cumberland. 

A considerable variety of soil exists. In the lower district, 
a light gravel or sand prevails ; but there is a small extent of what 
is called holm land, consisting of a rich alluvial soil, along the banks 
of the Nith, as well as in the centre of the parish, along the banks 
of the Cairn. In the higher district, the prevailing character is 
a species of loam on a till bottom, and abounding with small stones. 
Peat-moss also occurs in different places, and in considerable tracts. 
There are six or seven mosses in the parish, from which great 
quantities of fuel are obtained. Those in the upper district are the 
largest, and afford the hardest and best peat. But of late years a 
considerable portion of this kind of land has been drained and im- 
proved. Generally speaking, the soil is dry, although some parcels of 
wet spongy land occur, and some good meadows, besides the peat- 
mosses just mentioned. Except on the holms and more fertile valleys, 
the soil is by no means deep. On part of the higher grounds, it is ex- 
tremely thin and poor, and several of the hills are entirely covered 
with heath. 

Zoology.— 'Poxes are sometimes found in this parish, and otters 
have been recently hunted in the rivers.  Of domestic animals, 
all the common kinds are more or less reared. But the preyadmg 
breed of cattle has hitherto been the Galloway or polled kuid,— 

 About two years ago, a young otter was partially tamed and domesticated by an 

coS; and after being satisfied returned to its owner. It has now passed into other 
hands, and its subsequent history is unknown. 



DUNSCORE. 



339 



but on several farms the Ayrshire has been recently introduced, 
and the prevailing breed of sheep is the heath or black-faced variety. 
Swine are reared in great numbers, chiefly of the smaller breeds, 
being fed to the weight of about nine to fifteen stones. Many of 
the farmers also rear their own horses, or breed young horses for 
sale. Salmon occur in the Nith, and sometimes also, although 
rarely, in the Cairn. They come up for the purpose of spawning 
in the month of September, and return to the sea in March. The 
Cairn abounds in excellent trout. 

II. — Civil History. 
Antiquities.— On Springfield-hill, which is a very considerable 
eminence in the lower end of the parish, there are obvious traces 
of a military station, which seems hitherto to have escaped notice. 
It is of an oblong form, evidently adapted to the nature of the 
ground, and covers about two acres of land. It is now concealed 
by a plantation of larch, enclosed with a dry stone fence, but may 
be easily traced out. There is a double mound in front, forming 
two crescents, with a ditch between them. The outer crescent is 
smaller than the inner, which not only expands into a wider curve, 
but is considerably more elevated. The interior of the whole, form- 
ing the top of the hill, is flat; but the same regularity cannot be 
traced so distinctly in the rear as in front, although there is a steep 
descent all round. There is only one entrance apparent, which is 
on the east side, and just at the point of junction of the outer with 
the inner mound. This has evidently been a military station, and 
probably a Roman one ; — for it is situated very near the line of an 
old Roman road which passed through the parish of Kirkmahoe, 
on the opposite side of the Nith, and it commands a complete view 
of the country in the direction of Tinwald and of the hill of Burns- 
wark, which is distinctly seen in the distance. It is admirably cal- 
culated, therefore, by natural situation, to have answered the pur- 
pose of a military station, and to have maintained a communication, by 
signal, through the Barhillof Tinwald, with the famous Roman camp 
at Burnswark. It is also reported, that a battle -axe was once found 
in this hill, but of thiswehavenot been able to ascertain the certainty. 

Ancient Families. — The chief famiUes in this parish, in ancient 
times, were the Griersons of Lag, of Chapel, and of Dalgoner, the 
Kirks or Kirkhoes of Bogrieand Sunday well; and the Kirkpatricks 

• There is a very general tradition that some centuries ago, tliree brothers named 
Kirk, despatched one Culton, a notorious rohber, who infested Gleneslin, which was 
tJien surrounded by a forest, and tliat, as a reward for this action, tha reigning 
monarch granted to each of the brothers, respectively, the properties of Sundaywell, 
Bogrie, and Chapel. The spot where Culton was slain is still pointed out, and caN

of Ellisland and Friars' Carse. At the present day, there are no 
lineal representatives of any of these families in the parish, except 
James Grierson, Esq. of Dalgoner. Sir Robert Grierson of Rock- 
hall, indeed, still takes the title of Lag; but the lands which anciently 
formed the barony of Lag have passed out of the family, and now 
belong to George Whigham, Esq. of Hallidayhill. Several of the 
smaller properties, however, in the parish still continue in the de- 
scendants of the families who possessed them two or three centuries 
ago. And among these may be mentioned the M'Burnies of Lag- 
gan ; the Milligans of Dempsterton, whose ancestor was one Fer- 
gus Amulligan, who settled here in 1619 ; the Lachlisons of Burn- 
side; and the M'Kinnels of M'Murdoston, lineally descended by 
the female side from the family of M'Murdo, from whom the pro- 
perty was named. 

Family of Grierson of Lag. — The old tower of Lag, which is 
now a ruin, is said to have been built in the reign of James III. 
It stands upon an eminence, and was formerly surrounded by an 
outer wall and a ditch, having a moat or court hill a little to the 
east. It is a square building, of no great width, but of consider- 
able height, and of very massive construction. The family of Grier- 
son, who possessed this ancient mansion for many generations, is de- 
scended from Gilbert, second son of Malcolm, laird of M'Gregor, 
who died in 1374. For the name, it is said, was originally Gre- 
gorson, which is equivalent to the Gaelic appellation of M'Gregor. 
But this was a harsh term, and was therefore softened into Grier- 
son, and was often written, by abbreviation, merely Grier. The 
lands of Lag were originally disponed to this Gilbert M'Gregor or 
Gregorson by one John M' Wrath so far back as the year 1408, the 
period at which the family first settled in this part of the country, 
after having migrated from the Highlands. In the conveyance of 
the lands of Lag to this Gilbert, he is designed " Armour-bearer 
to Archibald Earl of Douglas." And he obtained a charter of 
confirmation from the Duchess of Turrenne, of date 9th April 1425. 
A descendant of the family joined the Maxwells of Nithsdale 
against the Johnstones of Annandale, and fought at the battle of 
DryfFe Sands, a famous and most bloody border feud, which hap- 
pened about the year 1598. And the last who inhabited the tower 
of Lag took an active part in the persecution against the Covenanters, 
and in 1685 was created a baronet under the title of Sir Robert Grier- 
sonof Lag. He died in Dumfries aboutthe year 1730, and was inter- 
led " Culton's nook." It is in the vicinity of the farm of Chapel, but williiii the 
borders of Glcncairn parisli.

of the family. 

Friars' Carse. Friars' Carse, which was anciently dependent 

on the rich Abbey of Melrose, also demands a brief notice. In 
Catholic times it was a cell or monkish residence, of which, although 
there are no remains, there are still a number of antique stone 
figures, such as adorned Catholic chapels and churches, placed in 
the avenue leading to the present dwelling-house. There is a 
small loch on the property, with an artificial island in it; and 
Grose says, that the loch was the fish-pond of the friary, and that 
the monks concealed their valuables in the island when the English 
invaded Stranith. After the Reformation, the estate of Friars' 
Carse was acquired by the laird of Allisland or Ellisland, an ad- 
joining farm. So far back as 1465, Cardinal Antonius confirmed 
a charter by the monastery of Melrose to John Kirkpatrick of 
AlHsland of the thirty-six pound land of Dalgoner, including Kil- 
lilago and Dempsterton. But whether Friars' Carse itself was 
included in this conveyance, or was so early alienated from the 
monks, we have not been able to learn. From the Kirkpatricks 
the whole property afterwards passed to the Maxwells of Tinwald, 
to whom it belonged in 1634. In the time of the poet Burns, who 
resided some years in this parish, and was tenant of Ellisland, the 
estate of Friars' Carse belonged to the Riddels of Glenriddel. 
Burns was a frequent visitor of the late James Riddel, Esq., and 
the original copy of his poem of the " Whistle," in the poet's own 
handwriting, is still at Friars' Carse, where it was composed, and 
is now in the possession of Mrs Crichton. The husband of this 
lady, the late Dr Crichton of Friars' Carse, left an immense sum, 
about L. 100,000 at the disposal of his widow and other trustees, 
to be appHed to charitable purposes. The trustees at first con- 
templated the endowment of a College at Dumfries, but various 
difficulties having presented themselves against the execution of 
this scheme, the erection of a Lunatic Asylum for the county, 
with several other minor objects, is now understood to be resolved 
upon. Such an institution will be of immense benefit to the south 
of Scotland, and be well worthy the benevolent intentions, while it 
will be eminently calculated to perpetuate the name, of the donor. 

Bogrie and Sundai/welL—There are two old square towers still 
standing in the upper part of Gleneslin, and on opposite sides of 
the glen, at a point where it contracts to a narrow pass. The 
names of these towers are Bogrie and Sundaywell, and both

of them anciently belonged to distinct families of the name of 
Kirk or Kirko, and sometimes also spelt Kirkhoe. That of 
Sundaywell is still inhabited as a farm-house. There is a stone 
over the door bearing the initials I. K., and opposite S. W., 
meaning John Kirk of Sundaywell. Under these initials, and 
at the bottom of the stone, which is in the shape of a heart, is 
the date 1651. In the troublous times of persecution, this house 
was a favourite resort of the Covenanters, to whom the proprietor 
at that period, the same John Kirk who erected the tower, seems 
to have been particularly friendly. Mr Blackadder, and others 
of the ejected ministers, were in the habit of visiting Kirk, and 
preaching at Sundaywell. And Kirk himself, in all likelihood, 
was present at the celebrated communion dispensed in the bosom 
of the hills of the neighbouring parish of Irongray, at which John 
Welch, who had been driven from the cure of that parish, presid- 
ed, — of which communion an interesting, though rude, memorial re- 
mains to this day, consisting of rows of stones placed in the form 
of sacramental tables. For Blackadder was residing at the time 
with Kirk at Sundaywell, and preached the preparation sermon on 
the preceding Saturday in " Meiklewood moor" — a district partly 
within this parish, and in which the ruins of an old house, bearing 
the name of the " Preaching Walls," still remain. 

Eminent Men. — It may here also be noticed, that the famous 
John Welch, grandfather of the minister of Irongray above-men- 
tioned, and son-in-law to John Knox, was a native of this parish. 
His father was laird of Collieston, a small property belonging to 
the family of Welch for several generations, and situated in Glenes- 
Im of Dunscore, and not in the parish of Irongray, as erroneously 
stated in the " Scots Worthies." It now belongs to William 
Copland, Esq. 

Church Lands. — A very considerable portion of this parish an- 
ciently belonged to the Catholic church. Mr Chalmers, in his 
Caledonia, Vol. iii. p. 51, note, has the following statement: 
" At Dunscore there was formerly a lake where none appears at 
present. In 1236, Alexander II. granted to the Monks of Melros 
' lacum de Dunscor in valle de Nyth, et quicquid continetur, infra 
eundem lacum.' " And he refers to the Chartulary of Melrose, 
1639, as his authority. 

This seems to define the extent of the church lands, and it may 
also help to determine the site of the quondam lake. For as it 
included beneath it the whole church lands in the parish, it seems 



DUNSCORE. 



343 



not improbable that it formed the upper boundary of the estate of 
Dalgoner, which actually hes in a sort of natural basin or low 
ground, in which there is a peat -moss. And a tradition also ob- 
tains, that there was a loch in this very neighbourhood in ancient 
times. In point of fact, Dalgoner and Killilago form the extreme 
upper boundary of the church lands of Dunscore — which, accord- 
ing to a decree of valuation of the parish, dated 21st March 1634, 
are designed " the thirty pound land of the Monkland of Melrose," 
and comprehend the following, " Dalgoner, Killilago, Bessiewalla, 
Laggan, Edgarton, M'Cheynston, M'Cubbington, Milliganton, 
Kilroy, Fardingwell, Dempsterton, Newton, Poundland, Sweir, 
Portrack, Friars' Carse, and Allisland." These lands, as Chalmers 
farther informs us, were gifted to the monks of Melrose by Affrica, 
daughter of Edgar, son of Dunevald, and grandson of Dunegal 
of Stranith the strath or valley of Nith. And, according to the 
same author, this Edgar possessed the lands of Dunscore under Wil- 
liam the Lion, and was succeeded in them by his said daughter, Af- 
frica, who gifted so large a portion of them to the church. It ap- 
pears, however, that the church itself, or benefice of Dunscore, be- 
longed to the monks of Holy wood, -betwixt whom and the monks 
of Melrose a dispute arose concerning the right to it. But this 
controversy was settled in 1257 at Kirkmahoe by William, Bishop 
of Glasgow, who decided that the Church belonged to the monks 
of Holy wood, but that the Abbot of Melrose had a right to the 
tithes of their own lands which they had acquired from AfFrica. 
In Catholic times, the cure was served by a vicar, and in Bagimont's 
roll the vicarage of Dunscore, in the deanery of Nith, was taxed 
at L. 4. The vicar enjoyed a manse and glebe. 

On 12th August 1566, the church lands of Dunscore were dis- 
poned by John Welch, the last vicar of Dunscore, with consent 
of the commendator of the monastery of Holywood, to Cuthbert 
Grierson of Layth, and this conveyance was confirmed by a char- 
ter of James VL, of date 12th' November 1574. 

Heritors.— Thexe are no fewer than 47 proprietors of land in 
this parish at present ; but many of the properties, of course, are 
small. 

III. — Population. 
It is stated in the former Statistical Account, that in 1791 the 
population of this parish was 1033; and that, by Dr Webster's re- 
port, about forty years prior to that date, it amounted to 651. But 
in 1730 it amounted to 750, so that if Dr Webster's report be cor-

rect, the population must have decreased 99 betwixt the years 1730 
and 1750. The present number of inhabitants, according to last 
census, is 1488. Of these the greater part reside in the country, 
and follow agricultural occupations, — for there is only one village 
deserving the name, situated at the church, and containing 211 in- 
habitants, so that the remaining 1277 dwell wholly in the country.

There are many substantial families in this parish, and the num- 
ber of proprietors whose estates yield a rental of upwards of L. 50 
a year amounts to no less than 40, of whom 18 are non-resident.

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — The number of acres in the parish, either cul- 
tivated or occasionally in tillage, exceeds 5300 ; the number which 
have never been cultivated may be about 5900, of which only a 
small proportion could be added to the cultivated land. But a 
considerable part might be improved by drainage and levelling, and 
rendered productive as meadow. The number of acres under wood 
is about 440, of which 60 are of natural wood, and the rest plant- 
ed chiefly with larch and Scotch fir. The plantations are well 
managed, and annually thinned. The greater part of the wood 
has been planted within the last thirty years. 

Bent of Land. — The average rent of arable land in this parish 
does not exceed L. 1, 4s. per acre. The average rent of grazing 
is at the rate of L. 3 per bullock or cow, and 4s. per ewe or full- 
grown sheep. 

Produce. — The average amount and value of raw produce year- 
ly raised in the parish may be as follows : — 



Grain of all kinds, - - . L. 7894 1 8 

Potatoes, turnips, and cabbages, - 3307 10 0

duration of leases is generally fifteen years, and sometimes nineteen. 
A gradual improvement has taken place in reference to farm-build- 
ings. The old thatched houses have in a great measure disap- 
peared. All the new houses are either slated or covered with thin 
flags or slabs of the red freestone peculiar to the county. The 
dwelling-houses are also enlarged in regard to accommodation, al- 
though for the most part confined to one story, and the farm of- 
fices are more extensive and commodious. The dry stone dike is 
the most prevaiUng enclosure, and the farms in general are well 
subdivided. 

Manufactures. — With the exception of country weaving, there is 
no manufacture carried on in this parish. About five years ago, a 
distillery was erected on a pretty extensive scale, and actively car- 
ried on for two years, when the proprietor died and the concern was 
given up, without any prospect of being renewed. It consumed for 
the time a large quantity of grain, and in so far as it afforded a 
ready and convenient market, would have proved a benefit to the 
farmer, had it been continued. But being far removed from fuel, 
and labouring under other disadvantages, it is doubtful whether it 
might ultimately have proved a profitable concern. 

There was once an agricultural society in the parish, but it broke 
up some years ago, and no attempt has been made to revive it. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-town, &amp;c. — The nearest market-town to this parish is 
Dumfries, which is about six miles from the lower end, and nine from 
the village of Cottack, in the centre of the parish before-mention- 
ed, in which is sitiiated the church. The post-town of Minnyhive 
indeed, is only seven miles distant from this village, but the usual 
communication is through Dumfries, as being most convenient. 

Means of Communication. — The turnpike betwixt Dumfries and 
Glasgow passes through the eastern part of Dunscore for three 
miles, and sends off a branch from the lodge of Friars' Carse, which 
goes right up through the whole extent of the parish, and nearly 
bisects it lengthways, passing the church, and leading out on the 
west through the parish of Balmaclellan to New Galloway. There 
is also another good road, which passes through four miles of this 
parish, leading from Dumfries to Ayr by Minnyhive, along which a 
stage-coach has lately commenced running, going to Ayr the one 
day, and returning the next to Dumfries. All the roads are kept 
in a good state of repair, and there are no tolls within the parish of 
Dunscore, except one side bar as a check to the toll of Newbridge,

in the parish of Holywood. Coaches travel daily along the turn- 
pike road both to Edinburgh and Glasgow. Dalgoner Bridge, with 
a span of 80 feet, as already mentioned, is the only bridge within 
the parish of any extent. 

Ecclesiastical State.- — The parish church is conveniently situated 
in the village of Cottack, at nearly equal distances from the two 
extremes of the parish. It was built in the year 1823, and is in 
good repair. It accommodates 850, but there are not above 10 
free sittings. The manse was built in 1814, and is also in good 
condition. The glebe consists of about fifty-one acres, and may be 
worth L. 60 per annum. The stipend is the minimum, with L. 12, 
12s. in addition, being a voluntary augmentation given by the heri- 
tors in 1793. 

The parish church formerly stood at the eastern or lower end 
of the parish, five miles from Dumfries. But in 1649 it was 
removed to its present situation, nearly in the centre of the pa- 
rish, and nine miles from Dumfries ; but the original edifice was 
taken down, and a new one erected in 1823, which is of a Gothic 
style, with an elegant square tower in the western end. In Popish 
times, there was a chapel in Gleneslin, at the distance of seven 
miles from the site which the church then occupied, and there was 
a church-yard attached to both church and chapel. That which 
attached to the chapel has now entirely disappeared, and has not 
been used in the memory of man, but there is a farm in the vici- 
nity which bears the name of Chapel to this day. The burying- 
ground, however, which surrounded the old church at the lower 
end of the parish, is still in use. In this burying-ground Grierson 
of Lag, as already mentioned, and the ancestors of other ancient 
families, lie interred ; so that there are two church-yards in the 
parish. 

There is one Dissenting chapel in the parish, in connection with 
the Relief synod, the minister of which is paid by the collections and 
seat rents.

about L. 15. 

Education. There are three parochial schools in this parish, 

in which all the ordinary branches of instruction, including Latin 
and Greek, are well taught. Prior to the year 1828, there was no 
assessed salary paid by the heritors, but the maximum is now given, 
and is divided into nearly three equal portions. But besides the 
assessed salary, L. 300 was mortified about a century ago by a Mr 
Grierson of Edinburgh, of which the interest is equally divided 
among the three parochial teachers. In 1807, a farther sum of 
L. 50 was bequeathed to the centre school at the church by Mrs 
Janet Dobie. And in 1829, Robert M'Kinnel, Esq. of M'Mur- 
doston, left L. 200 for behoof of the school in the lower district of 
the parish, and L. 50 for that at the church also. The interest of 
Mr Grierson's L. 300 was all the salary which the teachers enjoy- 
ed previous to 1828, except Janet Dobie's legacy after the year 
1807. The teachers have no dwelhng-houses ; but two good 
school-rooms were lately erected by subscription, and the third was 
at the same time thoroughly repaired. All the schools, therefore, 
are at present in good condition. There are few, if any, children 
above six years of age, who have not been entered at school ; and 
none above fifteen are known to be without the elements of com- 
mon education, to the value of which the people are fully alive. 
The school in the upper district is nearly four miles from the west- 
ern extremity of the parish, at which several families reside. These 
families, however, are nearer to one of the parish schools of Bal- 
maclellan, in the stewartry of Kirkcudbright. 

Literature. — There is no general library in the parish, but ju- 
venile libraries for the children attending the Sabbath schools have 
existed for some years, and have been productive of benefit among 
the youth, many of whom have acquired a taste for reading. Nor 
does the habit of reading prevail among this class only, for the pa- 
rishioners generally are substantially educated, and fond of books. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is about 25. The sums each receive vary 
from L. 1 to L. 3 a-year, or from 5s. to lOs. every second month. 
But, besides these allowances in money, there are always some 
distributions of meal, fuel, and clothing in the winter season, both 
from the ordinary funds, and from the benefactions of one or more 
leading heritors. 

The annual receipts for the relief of the poor are from L. 60 to 



348 



DUMFRIES-SIIIRE. 



L. 70 ; of which about L. 44 are raised by the ordinary church col- 
lections, and the remainder chiefly consists of the interest of lega- 
cies or mortified money, but partly also of the fees levied for pro- 
clamation of the banns of marriage, &amp;c. But out of this fund the 
salaries of the session-clerk and treasurer, the precentor and church 
officer are all paid, — besides support to the poor. Of late years, the 
number of poor has rather been on the increase — yet a disposition 
to refrain from seeking parochial relief still pervades many among 
the poorer classes. And the great majority of those who receive 
aid are the aged, infirm, and sick. Occasionally, however, hea- 
vier burdens than usual, such as the support of natural children, 
fall upon the funds ; but there has never been occasion for any 
kind of assessment. 

Inns. — At present there are two inns in this parish, both at the 
village of Cottack, one of which is necessary for the accommodation 
of travellers, but one of them might also be well dispensed with ; 
yet, with a few exceptions, sobriety and industry prevail among the 
peasantry. 

The fuel most generally used is peat, which is got within the pa- 
rish, as already observed. Sea-borne coal is procured at Dumfries, 
and Scotch coal is driven from Sanquhar, a distance of twenty miles, 
but it is always to be had at Mr Whigham's depot at Allanton, 
within the parish. This gentleman rents the Duke of Buccleuch's 
collieries at Sanquhar ; and, to the great convenience of the neigh- 
bourhood, keeps a constant supply on hand, by means of his coal 
waggons, which are constantly plying on the road ; and he always 
distributes a quantity to the poor in winter. The better sort of 
families use a great deal of coal in addition to peat. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since the last Statistical account was drawn up, the population 
has increased by 575, being more than one-third of the whole num- 
ber of souls. The inhabited houses have increased by thirty-six, 
while the greater part of the former houses have also been renewed 
and much enlarged and otherwise improved. There is also a new 
manse, a new church, and two new school-houses built. The teach- 
ers have received an addition of L. 17 of salary each, and are 
much superior to their predecessors in respect of qualifications, — at 
least generally speaking; for it must be allowed, that, under all the 
disadvantages of the old system, the schools were occasionally filled 
with able teachers. — The old Scottish plough has been almost uni- 
versally supplanted by the improved iron one, and the number of 



CAERLAVEROCK.

ploughs employed in agriculture has been increased by at least one- 
thirdt The annual funds for supporting the poor have advanced 
from L. 23 to L. 70, although still arising from the same voluntary 
sources. And the number of poor persons receiving parochial re- 
lief is doubled. Both the face of the country, and the intellectual 
state of the people, have been greatly improved.

PRESBYTERY OF DUMFRIES, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. ROBERT GILLIES, MINISTER. 



L — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Boundaries, Sfc. — Antiquaries differ as to the import 
of the name of this parish. Chalmers considers it to mean " the 
castle with the rotundity or buttress jutting out," while, according 
to Baxter, it signifies " the castle close upon the sea." It was an- 
ciently spelled Caerlaverock, and this appears the more correct or- 
thography, — although at present it is as frequently written Carlave- 
rock. The situation is entirely peninsular. Connected with Dum- 
fries on the north-west, it stretches toward the English coast. 
From this, it is separated by the Solway, which is here about twelve 
miles in breadth. The Nith on the west, and Lochar on the east, 
are the other boundaries. The Nith is generally fordable at low 
water, and, in very low tides, people may wade across to the adja- 
cent parish of New Abbey. But on the other side of the parish, 
the extensive moss through which the Lochar flows, forms an in- 
superable barrier to all communication, except during the driest 
months of summer, and even then only to pedestrians. The parish 
of Caerlaverock is about 6 miles in length, and nowhere more 
than 2 in breadth. It is in the form of an elongated hill, de- 
scending gradually to the Nith on the one side, and the Lochar 
on the other, and terminating in the Blackshaw flat towards the 
Solway. About six miles are washed by the tide, which flows up 
the Nith as far as Dumfries. The shore is a sandy mud, which 
used formerly to be laid on the land as a substitute for lime. The 



350 



DUMFRIES-SIilRE. 



climate is moist, — which may be partly occasioned by the extensive 
Lochar morass, and partly by the neighbourhood of the towering 
CrilFel. 

Geology. — Almost the whole parish lies upon a bed of red sand- 
stone. This stone is easily wrought, and at the same time durable. 
According to tradition, and, I may add, probability. New Abbey 
was built of Caerlaverock stones. A quarry on the glebe has long 
been famed for producing very superior grindstones ; it is only oc- 
casionally wrought, and that to a trifling extent. Neither coal nor 
limestone has hitherto been found in this parish. There are some 
faint indications of the latter mineral, and many believe that the 
former might also be found. This is, indeed, not improbable, when 
we survey the geological map of the kingdom. The same coal- 
field in all probability extends from the Enghsh side to Sanquhar. 
This, I am informed, was the opinion of an eminent engineer ; but 
it is right to add, that he also conceived, from the nature of the 
dip, that themineral was so deeply buried in the centre of the bed, 
that it would be in vain to hope that it could be worked to advan- 
tage. A good deal of land has been reclaimed from the Lochar 
moss, and the operations of the husbandman have disinterred many 
massy roots of oak, which for centuries had been buried under a 
stratum of peat twelve feet deep. Below the mossy stratum, sea 
sand mixed with clay and shells may, in many places, be recognized. 

Canoes, similar to those used by the North American savages, 
when first visited by Europeans, have been found in this vicinity. 
Coins of different dates, some as old as the time of Edward I., 
have been found in the neighbourhood of the church, and in other 
places. The soil is in general a light loam, and what is rather un- 
common, the worst soil is generally in the valleys. There is a con- 
siderable portion of peaty soil ; but where the situation admits of 
draining at a moderate expense, by a liberal application of lime, it 
is rendered tolerably productive. 

II. — Civil History. 
Eminent Men. — Dr John Hutton, first Physician to Queen Anne, 
was a native of this parish. He was originally " a herd-boy" to 
the Episcopalian minister of Caerlaverock. The clergyman, per- 
ceiving his superior talents, generously promoted his education, 
and fanned his youthful ambition. Hutton directed his attention 
to the science of medicine. He was fortunately the nearest sur- 
geon at hand when the Princess of Orange met with a fall from 
her horse in Holland. His services were put in requisition, and 



CAERLAVEUOCK. 



351 



exerted successfully both for himself and the royal princess. His 
fortune was now secured, but he did not forget the scene of his 
boyish days, and first humble avocation. At his own expense, he 
built a manse for the minister, bequeathed for charitable purposes 
L. 1000 Sterling to this parish, and also left a valuable library to 
the presbytery of Dumfries. This library originally contained the 
identical prayer-book which was used by the unfortunate King 
Charles when on the scaffold. It is much to be regretted that 
this interesting volume is now amissing. 

Land-oioners. — There are only four landed proprietors, viz. the 
Rev. Alexander Houston Douglas, Esq. of Bwds ; Robert Thor- 
burn, Esq. of Kelton ; James Connel, Esq. of Conheath ; and 
William Constable Maxwell, Esq. of Nithsdale, to whom the whole 
parish, with the exception of about 600 acres, belongs. Unfor- 
tunately for us, this gentleman has a much finer property in Eng- 
land, where he resides. He enjoys at present the honour of being 
High Sheriff of Yorkshire. Our only resident heritor is Mr Con- 
nel of Conheath. This gentleman does not disdain the ordinary 
duties of the eldership. Happy would it be for Scotland, as well 
as for themselves, did her gentry more generally show such at- 
tachment to the venerable institutions of our church. 

Parochial Begisters. — These seem to have been kept, sometimes 
with more, sometimes with less accuracy. 

Antiquities. — The castle of Caerlaverock forms to the antiquary 
the most prominent object of interest. This venerable pile, one 
of the most magnificent of its kind, was formerly, before the inven- 
tion of gunpowder, a place of immense strength, though destitute 
of natural bulwarks. It lies near the shores of the Solway. Its 
foundation is not many feet above high water-mark, and it has 
neither rapid river nor lofty rock to aid the resources of art. Its 
form is uncommon, being triangular. It is surrounded by a double 
moat, and when this difficulty had been vanquished by the prowess 
of the assailants, portcullis after portcullis, to the number at least 
of three, presented a barrier to their farther progress. Connected 
with this, we may notice the still visible remains of a plan for dis- 
charging a torrent of molten lead on the heads of the besiegers. 
From this, we may form some idea of the mode of warfare, and the 
consequent methods of defence adopted and practised among oui' 
fathers. Their object was to render their abodes inaccessible, ex- 
cept under peril of life, to all but the formally invited guest. In 
this respect, there is now a most important and salutary change.

Our object, now, is not to fortify our gates, but to render them ac- 
cessible to all. Caerlaverock Castle will be found amply and faith- 
fully described in many works. A pretty full account of it has 
been lately given in the Picture of Dumfries by Mr M'Diarmid, 
and formerly by Grose, Pennant, and others, to which the reader is 
referred. This castle has stood several sieges ; but to take notice 
of all these would be inconsistent with the object of this work. We 
find, according to Grose, that after the siege by Cromwell, the 
castle contained eighty-six beds, forty carpets, and a library worth 
L. 200, which enables us to form some idea of its ancient splendour. 
The Jleurs-de-lis, conspicuous on the windows of the banqueting 
hall, are a proof of the intimacy which formerly existed between 
France and Scotland. In the reign of Edward I., Caerlaverock 
sustained its most formidable siege. The whole army of that dis- 
tinguished warrior was drawn out for two days against it before it 
surrendered. The length of time was not remarkable ; but it is 
worthy of being recorded, that the defendants were only sixty in 
number. The discovery of this circumstance, it is said, occasion- 
ed no small surprise among the troops of Edward. 

III. — Population. 



In 1755 the population of the parish was - - 784 

1777 there were 449 males and 553 females, in all - 902 

1791 there were 454 males and 501 females, in aU - 955 

18J1, ' 1170 

1821, ...... 1206 

1831, ..... 1271 



The present population is about 1300. The increase is in a 
great measure owing to the establishment of Glencaple quay, for 
the accommodation of such vessels as cannot ascend higher up the 
Nith. From this quay also, for several years, a steamer has run 
to Liverpool : — the " Nithsdale," a splendid vessel, which com- 
menced plying this season, accomplishes her voyage in one tide. 
On sailing days, Glencaple is visited by upwards of thirty vehicles 
filled with intending passengers and friends. There is also another 
cause which probably has produced some increase in the popula- 
tion. The extensive provision which is made for the poor, renders 
it a desirable object for the labouring-classes from other parishes, 
to acquire a residence in this.

but they are only registered when the interment takes place in the 
parish churchyard. No distinction in the register having been 
made as to marriages, where the parties settled m the parish, and 
those where one of the parties left the place and took up a residence 
in another,-no satisfactory return as to marriages can be made. 

Character of the People.-The moral character of the people is 
decidedly good, partly owing to our abundant supply of schools, by 
which the benefits of education are extended to all, the children of 
the poor being taught gratis; and partly to the want of alehouses, 
of which there is not one in the parish except at the shore, 
where, on account of the shipping, it seems indispensable. Poach- 
ing was, at one time, extensively practised in the parish, though not 
much by the inhabitants. Now that game is all but absolutely 
extirpated, poaching of course has ceased. Smuggling also existed 
to a very great extent about fifty years ago,— now it is unknown. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — The following information has been kindly com- 
municated by the factor of the principal proprietor and three of 
the most intelhgent farmers. 

The total number of acres, Scotch measure, is 4640. Mr 
Maxwell's property consists of 3972 acres, which is let at L. 3930, 
10s. so that L. 41, 10s. are wanting to make the rent L. 1 per 
acre. Judging of the rest of the parish by this estimate, the rent 
may be stated at I.. 1 per acre to a fraction.

A considerable quantity of ground was some years ago planted 
on Conheath, by J. Connel, Esq. and the plantations are now 
thriving and remunerative ; but it does not appear that trees ge- 
nerally attain to a great size in this parish, unless in extensive 
plantations, or on spots peculiarly sheltered. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of land in the parish may be 
stated at L. 1 per acre. 

Live-stock. — The Galloway breed of cattle is the favourite one, 
and only a few Ayrshire cows are kept. The Leicester breed of 
sheep is the one chiefly attended to, the enclosures not being suffi- 
ciently strong for the wild black-faced or Highland variety. 



354 



DUMFRIES-SIIIRE. 



Husbandry. — The rotation of crops generally pursued is, \st, oats; 
2t, potatoes or turnip ; 3rf, oats, barley, or wheat, according to the 
nature of the soil ; Ath, hay ; bth pasture, then oats again. Fal- 
low is seldom resorted to except in the low flats, where the wetness 
of the soil renders this process necessary for the extirpation of weeds. 
All the leases on Mr Maxwell's estate are for fifteen years. A term 
of nineteen or twenty-one years would be more advantageous both 
for landlord and tenant. A great number of the farm-buildings has 
of late been substantially rebuilt ; if there be any defect in these, the 
out-houses perhaps are not sufficiently extensive. The greatest im- 
provement in agriculture in this parish is the introduction of bone 
manure, and the consequent extended and extending culture of tur- 
nips. Another stimulus is given by steam navigation, which enables 
the farmer to transport his sheep, fattened on the turnip crop, to 
Liverpool, at the rate of Is. a head. A great obstacle to the im- 
provement of the meadow land on the banks of the Lochar, not 
only in this but also in neighbouring parishes, consists in the keep- 
ing up of a paltry mill, which yields only a rent of about L. 20 per 
annum. The « weir" of this mill raises the water in the Lochar 
for miles in its serpentine course. Were this obstruction removed, 
and the course of the Lochar straightened and widened, many acres 
which at present he waste, would be submitted to the plough, whilst, 
with regard to such places as are occasionally under cultivation, the 
farmer would not run the risk of having the produce of the year 
washed away or rotted on the ground by the autumnal floods. 

Quarry. — There are no mines of any description in the parish, 
and only one freestone quarry, which is wrought. The rent of the 
quarry is L. 8 ; the value of the produce L. 100. 

Fisheries, Sfc. — Pike, eel, and roaches, abound in the Lochar. Ex- 
cellent flounders are caught in the Nith; but the only fishery of any 
importance is that of salmon. These continue to be taken in small 
quantities by the " Hester." Stake-nets were erected many years 
ago, but the right to do so was lately disputed, and an interdict pas- 
sed by the Court of Session. Upon an appeal, however, the in- 
terdict has been lately removed, and it is to be hoped, that, both 
for the interests of the parish and the public at large, the decision 
of the Court will be finally reversed. The rent of the salmon 
fishing is about L. 30; the produce above L. 100 in value when 

" This view is also adopted ly other writers in this work ; as will be seen by refer- 
ring to the accounts of Torthorwald and other neighbouring parishes.

sold. About L. 40 yearly may be received from the sale of white 
fish/of which flounders are the chief. 

Produce.-lt is not easy to give an accurate account of farm pro- 
duce. The produce of the land in corn and cattle may be esti- 
mated as being upon the whole equal at least to that of arable land 
in Scotland on an average. The rearing of pigs in this and the 
neighbouring parishes is carried to a greater extent than common; 
-almost every cottar keeps a pig, which enables him to pay his 
rent, and also furnishes him with manure for potatoes.

Manufactures. — There are no manufactures in this parish. 
Ship-building, however, is carried on to a small extent ; and two 
vessels of about sixty tons burden may be annually launched. 

Navigation. — For an account of the navigation the reader is re- 
ferred to the statistics of Dumfries, — as Glencaple quay can only 
be considered a subsidiary port to that of Dumfries. Vessels 
bound for Dumfries, but unable from their burden to reach the 
place of their destination, here unload, — which furnishes employ- 
ment for a number of carriers.

the plantations may be supposed to yield in the course of thirty years.

V. — Parochial Economy. 
The nearest market-town is Dumfries, to which the inhabitants 
repair every Wednesday, — perhaps in greater numbers than is ab- 
solutely requisite. There are in Caerlaverock seven villages, viz. 
Greenmill, Bankend, Glenhowan, Shearington, Blackshaw, Glen- 
caple, and Kelton. Most of these, however, are going to decay. 
Bankend, from its central situation in the parish, may probably 
continue ; and Glencaple, from steam navigation, will likely increase 
There are no turnpike, rail-roads, or canals in this parish. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The situation of the church, although 
nearly at one extremity of the parish, cannot be greatly complained 
of, — no person having to travel much above three miles to it. It 
is almost exactly five and a-half miles from Dumfries, and within 
three minutes walk of the manse. It was built in 1781. The 
walls are very substantial, and the form is in good proportion. It 
has one gallery in front, and it would admit of two additional side 
galleries, which, if erected, would amply accommodate all the po- 
pulation that will likely accumulate for years to come. The walls 
are liable to damp, the floor is not laid, and the passages are also 
very narrow ; and altogether the interior of the church would re- 
quire to be remodelled. It affords accommodation for about 470, 
and no rents are charged for any of the sittings. 

The manse was built a. d. 1708, not by the heritors, but by 
Dr Hutton. Since the date of its erection, it has been repaired 
more than once, partly at the expense of the Hutton Bequest, 
partly at that of the late incumbent, and partly at that of the he- 
ritors. When the last Statistical Account was compiled, my pre- 
decessor writes, " it is yet in decent condition and as houses do 
not improve by age, the writer regrets to state that he cannot say 
much in its praise. A little was done in repairs by the heritors three 
years ago ; but it continues excessively damp, and, though not very 
deficient as to the number of apartments, it is very inconvenient as 

 During spring-tides, and particularly when impelled by a strong, south-wester, 
the Solway rises with prodigious rapidity. A loud booming noise indicates its ap- 
proach, and is distinguishable at the distance of several miles. At Caerlaverock and 
Glencaple, where it enters the Nith, the scene is singularly grand and imposing; and 
it is beautiful to see a mighty volume of water advancing foam-crested, and with a 
degree of rapidity which, were the race a long one, would outmatch the speed of the 
swiftest horses. The tide-head, as it is called, is often fi'om four to six feet high, 
chafed into spray, with a mighty trough of bluer water behind, swelling in some 
places into little hills, and in others scooped into tiny valleys, which, when sun-lit, 
form a brilliant picture of themselves. From the tide head proceed two huge jets of 
water, which run, roaring along, searching the banks on either side, the antennae, 
as it were, which the ocean puts forth, and by which it feels its way when confined 
within narrow limits." — M'-Diannid's Picture of Dumfries, p. 15.

to their relative situation and size. The office-houses are in a still 
worse condition; some of them, indeed, give obvious indications 
that they will soon be numbered among " the thmgs that were." 
The o-lebe, including manse, office-houses, and garden, is 19 acres, 
1 rood 23 falls Scotch measure in extent. It is of excellent q-ua- 
lity, al'though part of it is liable to be flooded by the Lochar. 
The stipend is L. 177, 5s. Hd. in money, and a teind of fish. It is 
said, the teinds are not fully exhausted ; but the addition is so very 
trifling, that the present incumbent has never thought it worth 
while "to inquire into the matter. The stipend is all paid in money. 
The late incumbent compounded with the proprietor, and for the 
sum of L. 5 Sterling per annum gave up all right to the teind of 
fish. Should the decision of the Court of Session, to which allu- 
sion has been formerly made, be finally reversed, and the fishing 
by stake-nets let on a lease, the rights of the clergyman will be 
worth something considerable, perhaps L. 30 per annum. The 
possibility of a law-suit occurring has hitherto prevented any ope- 
rations requiring much outlay of capital; and, of course, the fish- 
ing has not yielded what it otherwise would have done, or may do. 
It is proper to state, that the point in dispute is, — where the river 
Nith terminates and the Solway Frith commences. 

We have no place of worship of any description, except the pa- 
rish church. About two years ago a Sabbath school was institut- 
ed by the present incumbent, in which he officiates as teacher. 
Another Sabbath school is also taught by Mr M' William at Black- 
shaw. Almost all the inhabitants attend the Established Church. Of 
late, however, a few individuals, who had taken umbrage at the con- 
duct of the session with regard to Dr Hutton's mortification, have 
employed the occasional services of a Dissenting preacher, who of- 
ficiates in the upper room of a tavern. There are three or four 
Roman Catholics, and as many regular hearers in Mr Clyde's Dis- 
senting chapel in Dumfries. Divine service is well attended in the 
parish church, and the respectful demeanour of the congregation 
during its performance has been the subject of gratifying remark 
to all who have been called to officiate in the pulpit. The num- 
ber of communicants is above 420. There have been two collec- 
tions in the parish church during the last eighteen months, — the first 
for the Scottish Missionary Society, when nearly L. 4 was rais- 
ed ; and the other for the India Mission, when the collection did 
not exceed L. 3 ; but unfortunately the weather was at the time 
very unfavourable. 



- DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 

Education. — There are three schools in the parish. The num- 
ber of scholars amounts nearly to 200. The parochial teacher has 
the maximum salary, and L. 40 per annum from the Hutton be- 
quest. A considerable number of young men from the neighbour- 
hood and also from England board with Mr Hill, the present pa- 
rochial teacher; and two assistants are kept in his school. Under 
his auspices, this establishment has acquired considerable celebrity 
as a commercial academy. The other two schools are situated at 
the extreme ends of the parish — the parochial one being centrical. 
They are supported out of the Hutton bequest and other mortifica- 
tions, of which some account will afterwards be given. The pre- 
sent teachers, Messrs M' William and Beattie, are both very re- 
spectable men, and deserving of much better situations. Each re- 
ceives L. 20 per annum, but the school fees are low, and not well 
paid in any of the three schools. The ordinary branches are 
taught, with the addition of French, Greek, Latin, and the higher 
branches of mathematics in the parish school. The people are 
fully alive to the advantages of education, and none are ignorant of 
the arts of reading, writing, and common arithmetic. No addi- 
tional schools seem to be required, although it has been found 
necessary to enlarge the dimensions of the parochial school. This 
operation is now in progress. 

Library. — There is a parochial library, which was instituted 
two years ago by the present incumbent. It has been supported 
hitherto by two grants of L. 10 each from the Hutton bequest ; 
one collection in the church; and the annual payment of Is. from 
each reader. The number of volumes exceeds 200 .. 

Poor. — The number of persons receiving parochial aid is about 
70. These receive from L. 1, 1 Os. to L. 7 yearly. The division 
is made twice a-year ; but some are of opinion, that a monthly 
division would be more beneficial to the poor themselves. A 
few pounds appear a great sum to a very poor person; hence, 

" Dr Hutton's deed of mortification provides that part of the surplus revenue 
shall be devoted to " the buying of Bibles, with other pious and religious books, 
for the use of such poor as are not able to purchase the same." It occurred to tlie 
writer that this might be faii-ly construed into authority for instituting and sup- 
porting a parish library. A query to this effect was therefore distinctly put to coun- 
sel, and the writer felt much pleasure in finding the following remark in the Opinion 
of the Solicitor- General, Mr Cockburn, with which Mr Cuninghame, the present So- 
licitor-General, agrees. " In the fii'st place, they," viz. the trustees "may make the 
best, and best managed parish library in Scotland." English counsel is not so clear 
as to the power of the trustees on this point without the authority of a court, — at 
least till the other objects of the charity have been fully attended to ; but, of course, 
the trustees would not think of doing so, until all the objects specified by Dr Hut- 
ton had been duly cared for.

petty debts are contracted without due calculation, and the as- 
sistance given is frequently more than mortgaged. The amount 
of collections in the church is about L. 18 per annum; but the 
o-reat source of parochial relief is derived from the Hutton bequest. 
In 1708, Dr Hutton mortified L. 900, for pious and educational 
purposes, and L. 100 was afterwards added to defray the expenses 
of management ; which by the deed of mortification is intrusted to 
the session of the parish, whose accounts are to be annually audited 
by the presbytery of the bounds. The whole sum of L. 1000, 
soon after it came into the hands of the session, was laid out in 
the purchase of the barony of Barcloy, in the parish of Colvend, 
which now yields an annual rent of nearly L. 400 per annum. 
The parish afterwards received L. 310 more in donations from- 
different persons, the whole of which was subsequently laid out in 
the improvement of Barcloy. The annual income of the parish is 
thus expended: to the grammar-school at Bankend, L. 40 ; to the 
English school at Blackshaw, L. 20 ; to ditto at Highmains, L. '20 ; 
to the maintenance of five poor boys as bursars at the school of 
Bankend, each of whom receive annually L. 3, 4s. 6d. for four 
years, L. 16, 2s. 6d. ; privately distributed in terms of a donation, 
L. 2 ; publicly at two diff'erent times, L. 160 ; to a superannuated 
teacher, L. 15. 

Formerly the whole of the surplus revenue was given to the 
poor. About two years ago, old complaints, to which all the pre- 
vious ministers of the parish had been much exposed, were reviv- 
ed as to the management of the session. Upon this, the present 
incumbent resolved to place himself under legal advice. The ses- 
sion accordingly procured the professional opinions of Mr Cockburn, 
then Solicitor- General, and Mr John Cuninghame. Their opinions 
not entirely coinciding, and such endowments being better under- 
stood in England, Mr Russell of the Chancery Bar was also con- 
sulted. These gentlemen all agree in commending the general 
management of the present trustees, as well as of their predeces- 
sors ; of the propriety of which, the simple statement, that L. 1310, 
the amount of the diff'erent mortifications, now yields an annual in- 
come of almost L. 400, is of itself a sufficient proof. They, how- 
ever, condemned the indiscriminate mode in which the poor had 
been provided for. Indeed, it is obvious, that, by relieving all the 
poor of the parish, the bequests have been not so much a boon to 
the poor as to the heritors. There being a special clause in Dr 
Button's deed of mortification, limiting the charity to those born

in the parish, the session have lately struck off all the " exstei'ns"  
from the list, in consequence of which the heritors have had to assess 
themselves rather heavily. It is certainly not a little singular that, 
in a country parish, with a population not exceeding 1300, and 
with an income of above L. 400 a-year including the collections 
at church for behoof of schools and the poor, an assessnent should 
be necessary ; yet it is not to be wondered at, since the Hutton be- 
quest, as formerly conducted, acted as a bounty upon pauperism. 
Our surplus revenue for the last half year, as well as for the year 
to come, will be nearly exhausted in defraying legal expenses — 
making an addition to the school at Bankend — and in executing 
necessary repairs on the farm-buildings on the estate of Barcloy. 
This estate is divided into eighteen farms. As several of the 
houses are old, and as the property, though not susceptible of much 
improvement by the plough, yet contains many acres well adapted 
for plantation, there is a channel provided for our surplus revenue 
for some time to come. As any delay in these improvements must 
be injurious to the trust, it is desirable that they should be speedily 
carried into effect. When completed, however, there will be a 
large and constantly increasing revenue, for the application of which 
the trustees will be under the necessity of having recourse to the 
Supreme Court for extended powers. Unfortunately, in some 
points, the power of the trustees is rather limited. The positive 
terms of the deed are inconsistent with its spirit, from the altered 
state of society, and from the circumstance of the founder never 
having, in all probability, contemplated such an increase of revenue. 
By the deed, it is provided, that there shall be two minor schools 
— but this would be impossible, were the terms of the deed strictly 
adhered to, which limits the salaries of the masters to L, 1, 10s. 
The trustees have gradually advanced these salaries to the amount 
already stated. It would be desirable to increase them still more ; 
but to do this, the authority of a court must be had. With regard 
to provisions for the poor, there is much truth in the remarks of Dr 
M'Morrine contained in a note, f subjoined to the former Statistical 

• This term is employed by Dr Hutton in his deed of mortification, to denote 
them, who, although resident, have not been born in the parish. 

f " If the situation, circumstances, and manners of the inhabitants of Caerlave- 
rock are considered, it should seem that a fourth part of the sum allotted to the support 
of the poor mightbe sufficient for all the purposes of real and useful charity. And, in- 
deed, an attentive obsei ver will reckon it a matter of doubt, whether the greatness of 
the parish funds be productive of most good or evil. The moralist has some cause to 
complain, that it dries up the sources of private charity, and renders the poorer people 
less willing to assist their old and needy relations. These they seem sometimes dis- 
posed to abandon to the care of the session, who cannot, by the small allowance they

Account. The management of the fund has not become easier — 
but, on the contrary, as may easily be supposed, is the source of 
much annoyance to the minister and session. Still it is pleasant to 
contemplate the good that may be done by adopting a system of 
judicious rigour. Those whose poverty has been the result of 
early profligacy must not be starved into crime ; but they must 
not be put on an equal footing with the temperate and industrious, 
whose poverty has been caused by old age, sickness, or misfortune. 
The trustees are furnished with ample and unquestionable powers 
to observe this distinction. They are left to the uncontrolled 
exercise of their conscience in selecting the objects of charity, and 
the increasing revenue will enable them to bestow a bounty upon 
virtue and industry, when overtaken by poverty. 

Fuel, c. — Peat is the fuel most commonly used, but such far- 
mers as live at a greater distance from the moss than a mile, would 
perhaps employ their men and horses more profitably in summer- 
fallowing their land than in leading peats. A cart-load of coals 
may be had at the shore for 7s. Lime is occasionally brought from 
Cumberland in sloops, but is more frequently carted from Kellhead, 
a distance of ten miles. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Having already adverted to the " Weir" at Bankend mill, it is 
right to state, that surveys have lately been made with the view of 

bestow, make up to them the want of that tender assiduity, which proves the cordial 
of age and poverty, and which natural affection alone can administer. The farmer 
with still greater reason complains, that the idea of a plentiful fund established for 
their support fills the parish in spite of every effort to prevent it, with the idle, in- 
firm, and indolent; and renders it difficult for him to obtain day labourers. lu fine, the 
poor themselves are far fi-ora being contented with the respective proportions of the funds • 
which are notwithstanding distributed with great impartiality. They are accustomed to 
lean too much to them, and to depend too little upon their own exertions. Nay, it 
is said, that a querulous habit is acquired, and even infirmity feigned, in order to ex- 
cite compassion, and to obtain a more liberal share of charity. In the opposite scale 
of good, these effects of the funds are to be thrown : first, the support of convenient 
schools; second, that no distress arising from poverty occurs, wliich obtains not a 
prompt relief, without any expense to the inhabitants of the parish. But, thou"'h 
none of the poor of Caerlaverock are under the necessity of begging from house "to 
house, the parish is as much as any other in this quarter, annoyed with vagrants, 
and as liberal to them. From these facts and observations, then, it may be inferred', 
" That distress and poverty multiply in proportion to those funds that arc created to' 
relieve them ; for ' where the carcase is, there the eagles will be gathered together ;' 
that the measures of charity ought to remain invisible, till the moment when it is nc'- 
cessary that they should be distributed ; that in the country parishes of Scotland, 
in general, small, occasional, voluntary collections are sufficient ; that the Lc-ris. 
lature has no occasion to interfere to augment that stream which is already copious 
enough, though not always derived from its proper source or confined to its ]roper 
channel ; in fine, that tlie establishment of a poors'-rate would be not only unne- 
cessary but Jmrtful, as it would tend to oppress the landholder without bi ingin"- relief 
to the poor."

having it removed to pave the way for the improvement of the 
Lochar moss. It is hoped, that these will lead to more solid ad- 
vantages than have accrued from former surveys. A very able 
one was made by Smeaton in the year 1754 ; but, from some cause 
or other, it evaporated in speculation. It is also in contemplation, 
to form a road through the moss between Glencaple quay and the 
Annan road, where it passes Mousewald kirk. Except about a 
mile near Caerlaverock manse, and a small rise on the Mousewald 
side of about half a mile, the rest of the road would be a dead level. 
The execution of this projected improvement would be of great 
advantage to Caerlaverock, and the country on the Mousewald side, 
more especially as a wooden jetty is projected, lower down the Nith, 
for the benefit of the steamers, and other vessels, which, from their 
burden, cannot, at all states of the tide, make Glencaple quay. 
The expense of this would be about L. 200, and it is likely to be 
soon effected. The mail between Dumfries and Annan used for- 
merly to pass through this parish by Bankend. The road, so far 
as it lies in this parish, is still tolerably good, and has lately re- 
ceived considerable repairs ; but after it enters Ruthwell, all traces 
of a road have been nearly obliterated by the invasions of the Sol- 
way. Were a new road made from Bankend bridge to Annan, 
and the other improvements alluded to also executed, we would 
have little to complain of, in respect of roads. The road to Dum- 
fries from Glencaple, which runs along the banks of the Nith, is 
nearly level, and in tolerable repair.

PRESBYTERY OF ANNAN, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. RICHARD NIVISON, MINISTER. 



1. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name of this parish appears to be derived from 
the Saxon word which signifies a station, and is supposed to 
have reference to one of the finest remains of a Roman camp 
in the vicinity of the church ; — the word middle being prefixed in 
order to distinguish it from two other Roman stations, each about 
ten miles distant, in opposite directions, — Netherbie in Cumber- 
land, and Upperbie in Eskdalemuir. 

Extent and Boundaries. — Consisting of three united parishes, 
Middlebie, Pennersaughs, and Carruthers, this parish is 9 miles long, 
and 4 broad, and contains about 40 square miles. It is bounded 
by the parishes of Hoddam, Annan, Kirkpatrick- Fleming, Half- 
Morton, Canobie, Langholm, and Tundergarth ; and occasion- 
ally intersecting and intersected by some of these, it exhibits an 
extremely irregular figure. 

Topograjhical Appearances, Sc. — While it is generally arable, 
possessing a surface variegated with hill and dale, it is chiefly wild 
and mountainous towards the east and north-east, and may, in- 
deed, be considered as forming an intermediate link betwixt the 
agricultural district of Annandale and the pastoral district of Esk- 
dale. The westerly winds chiefly prevail in this parish, and are 
often accompanied by long and severe rains ; hence the atmo- 
sphere is generally moist, and not unfrequently produces fevers, 
consumptions, and lasting rheumatic affections. 

Though we have amongst us nothing that can be dignified by 
the name of rivers or lakes, we have numerous springs of the 
purest water, unmixed with any mineral ingredient, and several rivu- 
lets or burns, which arise from our hills and discharge themselves 
into the Frith of Solway or the river Annan. 

Mineralogy. — The rocks which are most common in the parish 
are sandstone and hmestone. So much, indeed, does this last 
abound, that it may be called one of our staple commodities, and 



334 DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 

being carried to a great distance for the purpose of manure, has 
been mainly instrumental in promoting the agricultural improve- 
ments of this part of the country. Amidst the strata of limestone, 
are sometimes found, in a state of petrifaction, organic remains of 
the animal kingdom. It is generally supposed, that coal exists at 
a considerable depth below the surface, and attempts have been 
made in order to discover and work it, but as yet unsuccessfully, 
though not without such appearances as justify high expectations. 

Soils, Sfc. — There is a great variety of soils in the parish, and 
sometimes at a small distance from each other. A clayey soil, how- 
ever, mostly prevails, though gravel and loam are also not unfrequent- 
ly to be found. The vegetable produce corresponds to this variety. 
In every farm, oats, barley, and potatoes are to be found. Wheat has 
been introduced of late years into several farms, whose soil is more 
congenial to it, and turnip husbandry is making a gradual but 
steady progress. Besides rye -grass, which is universally cultivat- 
ed, and yields an exuberant produce, we have in almost all parts 
of the parish natural or bog-hay not only sufficient for our own 
consumption, but also for exportation into other parishes. In the 
more mountainous parts, the soil is best adapted for sheep pas- 
ture, and accordingly we have many excellent farms of this descrip- 
tion, which yield very handsome rents to the proprietors. 

The Ayrshire and Galloway breed of cows are generally preferred, 
the former of which are considered as the best milkers, and therefore 
exclusively graze our dairy farms. So common is the hog, that it 
is to be found in almost every cottage, and hence great quantities 
of bacon are annually exported to Newcastle. Many young oxen 
are reared in our pastures, and sold in the English markets. 

In addition to the more common culinary plants, which are the 
natural produce of the soil, we have in our ravines a very rare 
species vulgarly called Hart' s-tongue, which has been highly es- 
teemed for medicinal purposes. 

II. — Civil History. 
Eminent Men, c. — This parish has been long celebrated for 
its families of the name of Bell,— so much so that the Bells of 
Middlebie became a common expression in Dumfries-shire ; and 
many most celebrated individuals of this name, in various depart- 
ments of society, may be traced to an original connection with our 
parochial district. These femilies have mostly now become ex- 
tinct in the parish; but the prevalence of their name in a former 
age is testified by the figure of a bell found on a great proportion 
of our grave-stones.

The well known tragical story of fair Helen of Kivkconnel Lee is 
associated with one of the Bells of Blacket House in this parish. 
She was loved by Bell, but favoured the pretensions of another. 
The former having conceived the purpose of murdering his more 
fortunate rival, and knowing the accustomed resort of the two lov- 
ers on the banks of the Kirtle, concealed himself amidst the ad- 
joining wood, and watched his opportunity. Fair Helen discover- 
ed him in the act of levelHng his piece, and rushing betwixt the 
murderer and his victim, received the ball which was intended for 
her lover. The latter, after travelling to foreign lands, returned 
and died on the tomb of his beloved Helen, and their ashes are 
now mingled together in the romantic churchyard of Kirkconnel. 

The late Dr Currie of Liverpool, the author of the Life of Burns 
and of several medical works, was educated at our parochial school. 
He was the son of one of my predecessors, the Rev. James Currie, 
who was a man distinguished by strength of judgment, delicacy of 
sentiment, and eminent talents, natural and acquired. — John Ir- 
vine, Esq. of Newbie, M. P., the head of one of the first mercantile 
houses in London, was connected with this parish in early life, and 
still takes a lively interest in many of its concerns. 

Land-oioners. — Our principal land-owners are, His Grace the 
Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry ; Sir G. F. Johnstone, Bart, 
of Westerhall; Sir Patrick Maxwell, Bart, of Springkell; and Ge- 
neral Sharpe of Hoddam. 

Parochial Registers. — These of every description have been 
- kept very irregularly and carelessly, and most of them being writ- 
ten on small unbound papers, are now lost. The only register of 
baptisms which I can find, commences in 1744; but so imperfect 
is it, that a great proportion of them are omitted. I have now, 
however, taken this register under my own charge, and carefully 
attend to the insertion of the births as well as baptisms of every 
child whose parents belong to the Established Church. I am con- 
vinced, indeed, from observing the state of the parochial registers 
in this and other parishes, that, without a legislative appointment 
of a person with a suitable salary, all attempts to have them pro- 
perly managed will prove ineffectual ; nor can I help thinking that 
the ecclesiastical establishment of Scotland is deficient, in so far 
as there is no provision made for session-clerks, precentors, and 
beadles. 

Antiquities. — The most prominent is the celebrated camp at 
Birrens, which, as well as the neighbouring one at Burnswark in 



3G6 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE, 



the parish of Hoddam, is considered as almost the most perfect 
remain of Roman grandeur now existing in Britain ; the fossae, 
aggeres, and praetorium, being quite distinct. Situated on the 
lands of His Grace the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry, I 
trust that it will long continue uneffaced by the hand of Gothic 
barbarism ; and the more so, because there was originally another 
camp adjoining to it, which, being on the ground of a small pro- 
prietor, was dug up some years ago, and is now completely destroy- 
ed. In this last, there were found many splendid specimens of Ro- 
man antiquity, particularly large stones neatly cut and ornament- 
ed, with inscriptions perfectly legible ; but most of them have been 
sold or given away, and none, I believe, exist in their native parish, 
except one erected in the neighbouring garden of Mr Irving of 
Burnfoot. Nor, in considering the subject of antiquities, can I 
pass over in silence the tower of Blacket House, still standing, though 
fast sinking into ruins, which, like several others in the neighbour- 
ing parishes, is supposed to be one of those forts of defence which 
were used in the wars betwixt the English and Scottish borderers.

This increase of population is to be ascribed to the operation 
of national improvement in general, and a more scientific agricul- 
ture in particular. Within these last twenty years, three flourish- 
ing villages have arisen amongst us, which bid fair to enlarge their 
bounds, and promote the progress of civilization. The manufac- 
ture of cloth is carried on to a considerable extent, and a ready 
demand is made for it in the neighbouring emporium of Carhsle. 
Commerce even sheds its blessings around us. In one of our vil- 
lages an enterprising gentleman has attracted the employment of 
a great proportion of the surrounding population, and in particu- 
lar deals in wool more extensively than any individual in the coun- 
ty. The number of persons residing in our villages is 579, and in 
the country part of the parish 1528.

We cannot boast of resident nobility, but may confidently do so 
of the number of our proprietors, of whom there are about 30 pos- 
sessing land of the yearly value of L. 50 and upwards. 

There are 5 insane and fatuous persons; 2 Wind; and 1 deaf and 

dumb amongst us. 

During the three years from 1828 to 1831, there were in the 
parish 27 cases of illegitimate birth. 

By means of an enlightened education and other circumstances, 
our people are rapidly improving in their general habits, and, 
though not void of a laudable ambition, are contented with their 
situation and circumstances, and enjoy the comforts and advan- 
tages of society. The desire of obtaining a good education pre- 
vails almost universally, and in many cases, the greatest priva- 
tions are undergone by parents, in order to qualify one or two of 
their children for the learned professions. We may every day meet 
with persons occupying the lowest stations in society, who are ac- 
quainted with the events which are taking place in the political 
world, and can express their opinions upon them with correctness 
and propriety. Though vices of various descriptions prevail amongst 
us, I scarcely think that they are upon the increase, and while a 
decent outward profession of religion is everywhere displayed, an 
attentive observer may perceive religious sentiments secretly and 
gradually regulating their dispositions and conduct. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — 

The total number of acres in this parish may be stated to be . '24,900 

Of which there are cultivated or occasionally in tillage, . . 5,367 

uncultivated, waste, or in pasture, . . . 17,35fi 

capable of cultivation, ... . 1,895 

covered with wood, natural or planted, . . 282 

Our plantations consist chiefly of fir of various kinds, and the 
management may be considered upon the whole as good. 

Rent of Land. — The average annual rent of arable land is about 
17s. per acre ; of grazing L. 6 per ox or cow; and 6s. 6d. per sheep. 
The real rent of the parish is nearly L. 10,000. 

Rate of Wages. — The rate of farm-labourers wages is from Is. 
to Is. 6d. and of those of artisans from 2s. to 2s. 6d. per day. 

Husbandry. — The character of our husbandry may be term- 
ed good, and is still improving ; and of late much waste land 
has been reclaimed by draining and enclosing. The general 
duration of leases is, at an average, about fifteen years ; and the 
state of our farm-buildings and enclosures, though in many cases 
bad, has of late been much improved, and upon the farms of His 



368 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



Grace the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry is of a supe- 
rior order. In reference to this parish in general, it may be ob- 
served, that our improvements in agriculture, during the last twenty 
years, have been very extensive, and that our proprietors are anxious 
to give every encouragement to enterprising and substantial te- 
nants. The want of capital is perhaps one of the greatest obstacles 
to agricultural improvement ; and it is generally supposed that an 
abatement of rent would operate to the advantage of the landlord 
as well as of the tenant. I have already adverted to our quarries 
of lime, which exist in great abundance and excellent quality, 
and to these must in some degree be ascribed the advances made 
in husbandry, in spite of a soil, in many cases, very indifferent. 

Produce.— The gross amount of ' raw produce raised in the pa- 
rish is as follows : 

Of grain of all kinds, &amp;c. . . . L. 10,000 

potatoes, turnijis, &amp;c. - ... 3 000 

hay, whether meadow, &amp;c. ... 3 000 

crops cultivated for the arts, &amp;c. . . 'sOO 

land in pasture, &amp;c. .... 6,000 

gardens and orchards, &amp;c. . . . gOO 

the annual thinning, &amp;c. . ... 800 

mines, whether coals, &amp;c. . . . 1,500 

miscellaneous produce, &amp;c. . . .100 



L. 26,000 

Manufactures. — Our chief manufacture is that of cotton or 
linen, which affords employment to 42 heads of families. There is 
no peculiarity in the mode of conducting it, but in consequence of 
the low prices which have of late prevailed, it has occupied those 
who engage in it about ten or twelve hours per day, and this, too, 
without affording any thing like a fair remuneration. It is to be 
hoped, however, that these privations are only temporary, and that 
the sober and contented portion of our population who experience 
them will ere long meet with that encouragement to which they 
are entitled. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-town, 8c. — There are three villages in this parish, 
Waterbeck, Eaglesfield, and Kittlebridge. The nearest market 
town is Ecclefechan. Our means of communication are extremely 
good, and we have daily mails from the south and north. The turn- 
. pike road betwixt London and Glasgow passes through the parish 
for two miles, and is frequented by the mail-coach and other car- 
riages. Our parish roads, which were formerly almost impassable, 
have been improved to an incredible degree within the last twenty 
years, and, with our bridges, are now in excellent condition. 



MIDDLEBIE. , 3C9 

Ecclesiastical State.— T\\e church is by no means central in this 
parish, being only half-a mile from the westerly end of it, adjoining 
to Hoddam,and seven or eight miles from its opposite extremity; but 
notwithstanding this, it is not so inconvenient to the great mass of 
the inhabitants as might be imagined, though gradually becoming 
more so from an increase of population in these districts, which 
were formerly less frequented. It was built in 1821, and affords 
accommodation to 700 persons ; but, I regret to say, contains no 
free sittings. The manse was built about a century ago ; but it 
has frequently been repaired since, with the addition of several 
apartments. The glebe is about 15 acres in extent, and L.30 in 
value. The teinds are exhausted, and insufficient to cover the last 
augmentation given in 1806, though the parish is one of the most 
extensive and populous in the county, and the rental great and in- 
creasing. The amount of stipend, inclusive of communion elements, 
is L. 220, 9s. 7id. 

There is in this parish a Dissenting meeting-house of the Relief 
persuasion, the minister of which is paid by the seat rents, and re- 
ceives, I understand, somewhere about L. 70 per annum. The 
number of families and of persons of all ages belonging to the 
Established Church is of the former, 232, and of the latter, 1160. 
The number of the same belonging to the Relief meeting-house is 
of the former, 129, and of the latter, 645. Divine service is in ge- 
neral attended extremely well in the Established Church, and is so, 
I believe, also in the meeting-house, though many of the sitters 
in this last place are not Dissenters, but take seats in it, merely 
in consequence of their distance from the parish church, while 
they receive seahng ordinances in the Establishment. The average 
number of our communicants is somewhere about 300. We have 
no societies for religious purposes established in the parish, but 
have occasionally collections in the church in behoof of the As- 
sembly's funds for promoting Education in the Highlands, and pro- 
pagating the Gospel in India,— each of which may be stated as 
amounting at an average to L. 4. 

Education. — There are two parochial and four private schools 
in this parish, in the former of which are taught Greek, Latin, 
and French, with the more common branches of education. The 
maximum salary is divided betwixt the parochial teachers, and 
the fees of each amount to somewhere about L. 24 a year; but 
neither of them has a house. The average expense of education is 
about 9s. 6d. per annum. I cannot agree with some who think that 
the moral temperature of the community is lower than it was thir- 



370 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



ty or forty years ago. We have less religious formality, but not 
less true religion. 

Library. — There is a circulating library in this parish, but no 
other literary institutions of any kind. 

Friendly Society. — We have also a Friendly society, established, 
I believe, about forty years ago, for affording relief to its members 
when they fall into distress, and a small sum for their decent in- 
terment when they are removed by death. 

" Poor. — The average number of persons receiving parochial aid 
is about 45, and the average sum allotted to each is about Is. per 
week. Besides church collections, which amount to about L. 22 
per annum, and which are altogether inadequate to the support of 
our poor, we have a regular assessment made twice a-year, amount- 
ing, at an average, to the annual sum of nearly L. 100. I am sorry 
to add, that the disposition among the poor to seek parochial re- 
lief is rapidly increasing, and is seldom or never considered as in 
the smallest degree degrading. In this and the other border pa- 
rishes, the feelings of the English poor upon this subject are gra- 
dually gaining ground. 

Inns, c. — We have about ten small inns and alehouses in the pa- 
rish, which have the worst effects upon the morals of the people. — 
Our fuel is peat and coal, the former of which is obtained in mosses, 
now nearly exhausted by the work of years ; the latter is brought 
from the coal-pits of His Grace the Duke of Buccleuch, in the 
parish of Canobie, distant about twelve miles, and from the thriv- 
ing town of Annan, about seven miles distant, whither it is convey- 
ed over the Solway from Cumberland. The English coal is higher 
in price than that of Canobie, and costs about 8s. per ton, but is 

considered ultimately as economical as the other. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The more prominent variation betwixt the present state of this 
parish and that which existed at the time of the last Statistical 
Account, may be stated to be, a superior mode of husbandry, — an 
infinitely more improved state of the roads, — and more widely dif- 
fused and enlightened education ; in short, a greater advancement 
in refinement, — and a greater enjoyment of worldly comforts. With 
pleasure I anticipate now a gradually increasing accession of paro- 
chial prosperity. Population is making rapid progress, and con- 
tributing its share in laying the foundation of national strength.

<p>

PRESBYTERY OF LOCHMABEN, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. THOrilAS H. THOMSON, MINISTER. 



1. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name and Boundaries. — The parish of Dal ton, prior to the 
Reformation, was divided into two parishes, that of Meikle Dalton 
and Little Dalton ; but, since their union in 1633, the church of 
Meikle Dalton is used by the parishioners of the united parishes 
as their place of worship, — the ruins of the church of Little Dal- 
ton now enclosing the burial ground of the descendants of the Car- 
ruthers of Holmains. The name of the parish is evidently Anglo- 
Saxon ; Dal-ton or Dal-dnn, signifying the fort in the dale. There 
are the remains, accordingly, of a fort on a hill in the immediate 
neighbourhood of the village of Dalton, at which village, in ancient 
times, the baronial courts were held. The parish is 6 miles in 
length from north to south, and 3 miles in breadth ; its bounda- 
ries are, Lochmaben on the north, which intersects it ; Mousewald 
on the west ; Ruthwell on the south ; Cummertrees and the river 
Annan on the east. 

Geology. — Betwixt the Holmains and Almagill-hills, lies the 
vale of Little Dalton, in the north end of the parish. These hills 
are 500 feet above the level of the sea, and run from north to 
south. They are composed of transition rock of greywacke, which 
sometimes alternates with greywacke slate. The direction of 
the strata appears to be from east to west, and their dip to the 
north. The next class of rocks in the parish, in point of age and 
extent, is the independent coal formation, which lies in the hollow 
of the transition rocks, such as the reddish-brown-coloured sand- 
stone on the banks of the Annan. In the south end of the pa- 
rish, the grayish white sandstone, abounds with limestone of an in- 
ferior quality. The next formation is that of floetz trap, consi- 
dered as the newest of the universal formations, because it rests 
on all the others. Of this formation, there are only individual 
links, such as greenstone and porphyritic amygdaloid. The manse 
of Dalton is founded upon the amygdaloid rock at its western ex- 



372 



DUMFIIIES-SIIIUE. 



tremity; from this point, it runs east as far as Langholm. The 
alluvial formations are very extensive, and consist chiefly of great 
masses of gravel and sand, which spread over the low lands of the 
parish, and are formed into ranges and groups of little hills. There 
is evidently no immediate agent in the neighbourhood which could 
have collected such immense quantities of matter, apparently the 
diluvium of the deluge. The sand and gravel cover the solid 
rocks, principally those of sandstone, and appear upon examina- 
tion to be composed of the fragments of the various formations 
found in the vale of the Annan. In the high lands of the parish, 
the soil is chiefly composed of the waste and debris of the transi- 
tion rocks, which is fertile ; but many of these rocks are covered 
with common indurated clay and heath, and are barren. The tran- 
sported soil on the banks of the river, being of a loamy natin-e, is 
rich and fertile ; but that of an older date, composed of light gravel 
and sand, which in dry seasons is very unfavourable to vegetation, 
when moistened with frequent showers, is very fertile in the pro- 
duction of barley. 

It has been supposed that the river Annan, at some remote pe- 
riod, instead of its present course, where it discharges itself into 
the Solway at a short distance from the town of Annan, followed 
a diff'erent course through this parish, running in a southern di- 
rection from the mansion-house of Dormont, through a long track 
of level meadow and peat-moss, and fell into the frith at a short dis- 
tance from Cummertrees church, three miles west from Annan. 
It is along this line where the greatest quantity of the alluvial for- 
mations are deposited, which are strikingly illustrated in hills and 
ridges of gravel and sand. These evidently appear to have been 
carried out of the valley of the Annan by a mighty flood of waters, 
and deposited at the termination of the transition rocks, which en- 
close it to a great height. After the deluge, the valley of the An- 
nan must have been a lake ; but its waters bursting a passage 
through a transition rock at Dormont, the present course of the 
Annan, the valley has been drained of its waters, with the excep- 
tion of a number of lakes in the adjoining parish of Lochmaben. 
During a flood, the river at Dormont, and for several miles along 
its course in a northern direction, lays the whole country under 
water ; but were the landed proprietors interested to unite in deep- 
ening a very small portion of the bed of the river at Dormont, where 
it bursts through the transition rock, the beautiful holm lands along 
its course, with their luxuriant crops, would be preserved in safety.

At one period, it was proposed that a canal should be made through 
the level track of meadow and peat-moss in this parish, for the pur- 
pose of an inland navigation from the upper part of Annandale to 
the Solway Frith; but it is not likely that the measure will ever 
be executed. The height of the river at Dormont above the level 
of the sea is 160 feet. 

Fish, c— The fish caught in the Annan at diflferent periods 
of the season are the salmon, grilse, sea-trout, whiting, or herhng. 
Thirty years ago, they were caught in great abundance ; but since 
the stake-nets were placed at the mouth of the river in the Solway 
Frith, they have become very scarce, and unless some law is made 
for the farther removal of these nets, the fish will soon be extinct, — 
particularly as the landed proprietors along the course of the river 
reap no benefit, and therefore take no interest in preserving the 
breed during the winter, so that nearly all that get up in close time 
are speared. An act of Parliament was obtained in 1804 for pro- 
tecting the fish in the Solway Frith from the 25th September to 
the 10th March, which is the forbidden time. 

II. — Civil History. 

Parochial Register s.The kirk-session of Dalton have in their 
possession an old book of session records, from the 18th August 
172-3, to the 1st September 1766, which contains a correct state- 
ment of the poors' funds. The registration of baptisms is very in- - 
correct; but from the year 1769 a correct register of marriages, 
births, and baptisms has been kept. 

Antiquities. — The only ancient edifice is a tower at Holmains, 
formerly the seat of the Carruthers of Holmains, but now totally 
in ruins. It does not appear to have been a place of great strength. 
At a short distance towards the east, on the AlmagiU -hills, there is 
a beautiful old camp of a circular form, now named Range Castle. 
From the summit of the hill on which it is placed, there is a most 
commanding view, embracing the beautiful vale of the Annan, with 
the whole amphitheatre of the surrounding hills, the ancient castle 
of Robert Bruce, and the burgh of Lochmaben, with its nume- 
rous lakes. The camp is formed upon a transition rock of grey- 
wacke ; its diameter is 102 yards; the ditch or fosse which surround- 
ed the camp is 9 feet deep and 27 feet broad. It must have been 
a place of considerable strength, from the great inclination of the 
hill on its north and east sides. The lower part of the camp ap- 
pears to have been separated from the upper by a rampart or wall 
made of stones taken from the fosse, many of which are in a vitri- 
fied state. This wall has been removed to build fences in the

neighbourhood. The diameter of the upper part of the camp is 
54 yards, and the entrance to it is on the western side. 

Land-oroners, Sfc. — The chief land-owners in the parish are Mr 
Macrae of Holmains, and Mr Carruthers of Dormont. 

Modern Buildings. — Of modern buildings the mansion-house of 
Rammerscales, built by the late Dr Mounsey, is very respectable. 
It is romantically elevated upon a mountain range, which commands 
the whole vale of the Annan, and surrounded with hanging wood 
kept in great perfection and beauty by the present proprietor Mr 
Bell, The residence of Mr Carruthers of Dormont, built in 1823, is, 
for elegance, solidity, and convenience, among the best in the coun- 
ty. Its situation is on the banks of the Annan, where it is enriched 
by a fertile lawn in front, and plantations laid out with great judg- 
ment and taste.

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Economy. — The number of acres stand- 
ard imperial measure in the parish is about 6753. Of these 600 
never have been cultivated, and remain constantly waste or in pas- 
ture ; and it is only to a small extent that any of this waste land 
could be added to the cultivated land of the parish ,• — not more than 
200 acres, with a profitable application of capital, could be reclaim- 
ed. There is no land in the parish in the state of undivided com- 
mon. The number of acres under wood is 517, and of these acres 
190 are natural wood. The average rent of arable land per acre 
is about 12s. 

Rate of Wages. — The wages of a farm-servant with victuals and 
bed, about L. 9 a-year, and that of a female, L. 5. The average

was'es 



of a farm-labourer per day about Is. 4d. The small quantity 
of sheep reared in the parish is of the Cheviot and Leicester breed ; 
and of black-cattle, the Galloway. 

Hushandnj.—T\Q general character of husbandry pursued, with 
respect to the practice of the farmers, is so various as to be inca- 
pable of exact description, but the following may be stated as the 
most common : 1st year, oats ; 2d, potatoes or turmps ; 3d barley 
with crrass seed ; 4th, hay ; 5th and 6th, pasture. Nearly all the lands 
occupied by farmers are let on leases for fifteen or nmeteen years. 

Farm-Buildmgs and Fences.— T\ie state of farm-buddmgs has 
been very much improved during the last ten years ; but the fences 
and enclosures are of the worst description ; and though there have 
been many improvements in reclaiming and draining waste lands 
both by proprietor and tenant on some properties, there is still 
great scope for farther improvement. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 
the parish, as nearly as that can be ascertained, is as follows : 

Produce of grain of all kinds, whether cultivated for the food of man or 

the domestic animals, ... . . L- 4500 

Of potatoes, and turnips, &amp;c. cultivated in the fields for food, . loUU

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Markets, S,-c. — There being no market-town in the parish, the 
nearest is that of Annan, at the distance of six miles, and Dum- 
fries at nine miles. Annan is the port to which all the grain is tak- 
en, and where the barley in general is shipped to Liverpool. There 
is but one village in the parish, and its communications with the 
market-towns are very convenient, not only by the parish roads, 
but by the great turnpike road from Carlisle to Portpatrick, which 
runs through the south end of the parish. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The situation of the parish church is at 
the village of Dalton, and is very convenient, being placed in the 
centre of the parish. It was built in 1704, and at present it is not 
in the best state of repair. It accommodates about 800 persons. 
All the families in the parish, 127, three excepted who are Seced- 
ers, attend the Established Church ; and of these 270 are commu- 
nicants. The manse was built in 1806. The extent of the glebe is 
ten acres, and its value L. 10. The amount of the stipend is eight'

chalders, — four of oats and four of barley, with L. 58, 6s. of money 
scipend. 

Educatinn. — There is only one parochial school, and the 
branches taught are, Latin, Greek, English, arithmetic, geography, 
mensuration, and algebra. The salary of the schoolmaster is 
L. 34, 4s. .3d. and the amount of school wages about L. 20. He has 
the legal accommodation. 

Pooi\ — The number of persons receiving parochial aid is 12, 
and the average sum allotted to each per week is from Is. 6d. to 
2s. ; — besides that many have their house rents paid at L. 1, 10s. 
per annum. It is to be feared that a disposition among the poor 
to refrain from seeking parochial relief is fast wearing out. The 
annual amount of contributions for their relief, arising from church 
collections, is about L. 25 per year, and what more has been re- 
quired, the heritors have willingly given it. 

Inns, c. — There are two inns in the parish, but the effects of 
which upon the morals of the people are of the most degrading nature. 

Fuel. — The fuel chiefly consumed consists of peat, which will 
soon be exhausted ; but coals exported from England to the port of 
Annan are purchased at a moderate rate. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

The more striking variations in the parish since the former 
Statistical Account was written, consist not only in an increase 
of population, but in the extent of cultivation, which the late war 
prices produced. There is also a great increase of black-cattle, 
horses, and particularly swine, which are reared in great numbers, and 
are what the farmer chiefly depends upon for his winter's rent. Of 
late years, they have not been so profitable, and like all other stock, 
fluctuating in prices. The parish is susceptible of great improve- 
ments in respect of husbandry. The soil in general being light and 
dry, is particularly adapted to the use of turnips, which might be 
eaten ofl" with sheep to great advantage. Draining and proper at- 
tention to the fences, which are in a ruinous state, and the use of 
lime, which is to be obtained in the immediate neighbourhood, 
would make a mighty improvement on the face of the parish. The 
farms in general are over-rented, and for want of capital the far- 
mer is unable to make improvements. The constant change of te- 
nants since the peace in 1815, owing to the fluctuating state of the 
markets, has been the principal cause in general of the slowness 
of improvement, which can only be effected by a thriving and in- 
dustrious people and by a steady state of things.

PRESBYTERY OF LOCHMABEN, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. TPIOMAS MARJORIBANKS, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Sfc. — There can be little doubt that Lochmaben derives 
its name from the number of lochs which surround it, although 
there is a tradition, that, in olden times, a nunnery was built upon 
a small island in one of the largest of these lakes ; from which cir- 
cumstance, persons conversant with the Gaelic language say, — Loch- 
maben signifies " Loch of the Maidens" or " Loch of the Fair." 
The Scoto-Irish settlers called it Loch-ma' -ban, the lake in the 
white plain, because the Castle loch, near which Lochmaben is built, 
exhibits a white appearance, when contrasted with the black sur- 
face of the ridge which bounds it on the west. The town is most 
delightfully situated at a short distance from the banks of the 
Annan, verifying the old Scotch rhyme, — 

" Lochmaben stands most beautiful, 

Near unto Annan side. 
In old times kings and princes there, 
For safety did abide." 

In viewing this ancient seat of kings from some rising ground 
on the west, it appears so completely surrounded with water, that 
a stranger would suppose it impossible to be entered without the 
aid of a boat. 

Boundaries. — The parish is bounded on the north by Johnstone ; 
on the east by Applegarth and Dryfsdale ; on the south by Dalton ; 
and on the west by Torthorwald and Tinwald. In length it ex- 
tends 10 miles, and in breadth 3. Its contents are 10750 En- 
glish acres, or 8546 Scotch, or 16f square miles. The landward 
part of the parish is valued on the stent roll at 6000 merks, and 
the burgh roods at 500, thus making the landward part L. 7337, 
Is. Ild., and the burgh L. 1824, 7s. Id., or the whole L.9I61, 9s. 

Topor/raphical Appearances. — The surface is in general plain

tive of Lochmaben.

and level, with a considerable rise to the west, which scarcely can 
be called hilly, as the whole of it is under the plough. The soil 
accordingly varies ; that which lies along the banks of the rivers 
Annan, M, Kinnel, and Dryfe, is of rich alluvial loam, and ca- 
pable of bearing crops of every description. In some of these fine 
holm lands, from the frequent deposits left by the overflowing of 
the rivers, the soil in many places measures nine feet in depth. To 
the westward, it is light, gravelly, and cold. The greater part 
of it, which formerly was the commonty of the burgh, and was di- 
vided some years ago by a decreet of the Court of Session, is now 
made arable, enclosed, and subdivided by hedge-rows and strips 
of planting. These properties vary in extent from five to thirty 
acres, and have good substantial houses, with suitable steadings 
built upon each of them. The only uncultivated portions of the 
parish are three separate parcels of moss, which are of great bene- 
fit to the people in supplying them with peat, which is the princi- 
pal fuel, — 'no coal as yet having been found in the vale of Annandale. 

From the situation of the greater part of the parish lying so low, 
and being nearly as it were surrounded with water, the cUmate very 
naturally may be supposed moist and unhealthy. This, however, is 
not the case, as there is no parish in the county more health- 
ful, or where the inhabitants attain a greater age. The soil around 
the burgh is particularly dry, with a southern exposure. Snow 
lies only for a short time. The prevailing winds, which frequently 
blow with great violence, particularly in the spring, are from the 
north-east. The heaviest falls of rain come from the south and 
south-west. The average temperature during the year may be 
about 46 of Fahrenheit. 

Hydrography. — The town and parish are abundantly supplied with 
ater, — there being no less than nine lochs within its bounds, and 
four rivers passing through it in different directions. The parish 
is bounded from north to south by the Annan, and from west to 
east by the water of tE, which falls into the Kinnel, near to the 
lands of Templand — which runs about a mile south, then takes a 
south-eastern direction, and joins the Annan, a short way beneath 
Applegarth church. About three-quarters of a mile farther south, 
the Dryfe, which separates a small portion of the parish from 
Dryfsdale, falls into the Annan about two hundred yards below 
the boat-house of Halleaths. There is one chalybeate spring, a 
mile west from the burgh, called the Physic Well, which some 
years ago was much resorted to by the inhabitants, on account of 



LOCIIMABEN.

its purgative qualities. There is also an abundant supply of spring 
water of the purest kind. The water of the lochs is used with per- 
fect safety for culinary purposes during winter and spring. Fa- 
milies, however, prefer it at all seasons for washing, on account of 
its softness. There are five lochs in the parish of considerable 
size, viz. the Castle loch, which covers a surface of more than 200 
acres ; the Broomhill loch contains, 80 ; the Mill loch, 70 ; the 
Kirk-loch, 60 ; and the Hightae loch, 52. The depth taken dur- 
ing winter has been found in several of them to be 52 feet. Be- 
sides these five, there are four others of considerably less extent. 

Geology. — The rocks found in this parish are all of second- 
ary formation, and dip to the south. In the beds of the smal- 
ler rivers and burns, blocks of dark rolled whinstone are found, 
from which excellent curling-stones are made. The only quarry 
worked in the parish is of red sandstone. A very considerable 
portion of this rock is found in thin layers, which are easily sepa- 
rated, so that they are now much used in covering the roofs of 
houses, particularly of farm-steadings. The roof when properly 
put on looks very neat, though some objections are made against 
its weight, and tendency to draw damp in winter, which is inju- 
rious to the wood. 

Botany. — All the common plants are found in this parish. 
Among the rarer aquatic plants, we may mention the white water- 
lily {NymphcBa alba, cat's tail or reed mace {Typha anyustifolia, 
the reed {Arundo Phragmites, the great water horse-tail [Equise- 
tum Jluviatile, which grow abundantly in several of the lakes. 
The blaeberry [Vaccinium Myrtillus, and the cranberry V. Oxy-. 
coccus,  are common, particularly the latter. The small sloe tree 
[Primus spinosa, and the hagberry P. Padiis, are found in 
the brakes and hedges. The deadly nightshade {Atropa Belladon- 
na, among the ruins of the old castle. The oak, the ash, the 
plane, and the horse-chesnut, are of great size around the pleasure 
grounds of Halleaths, Elshieshields, and of the castle. 

Zoology. — No wild animals of the class Mammalia are found in 
this parish, except such as are common to the neighbouring coun- 
try. The fox is seen frequently, both in the woods of Halleaths 
and Elshieshields. The otter, though not common, has been 
found in the Annan near Halleaths, and in the Castle loch. The 
badger has entirely disappeared for many years. The pole-cat 
or foumart, the weasel, and the different species of rats are all com- 
mon. The Vespertilio altivolans has never been seen flying about

any of the lochs, though observed by Sir William Jardine, Bart, 
upon the Annan. 

Fishes.— It has been frequently stated that no fewer than fifteen 
distinct species of fish, fit for the table, have been found in the 
Castle loch. In enumerating the chief of these, we may men- 
tion the pike, the perch, the loch-trout, of which there are two 
species, — one weighing from twelve to fourteen pounds, the other 
from two to five pounds, — the bream, the roach, the skelly or chub, 
the green-back, the vendace, the eel, the loach or beardie, the 
minnow, and the banstickle. With the exception of the vendace, 
the bream, and green-back, the others are found in great abund- 
ance in the different lochs. Pike has been taken weighing from 
twenty-four to thirty-five pounds. It is most destructive to the 
other species, except the perch, which is protected by its powerful 
dorsal fin. 

The Vendace. — The vendace is found nowhere in Scotland, ex- 
cept in the Castle loch of Lochmaben, though it is said that Sir 
William Jardine caught a few in the Mill loch, but whether it was 
the case or not, we have not learned. The oldest fishers in the 
town have frequently told us that they never knew a single instance 
of one being caught, except in the Castle loch. The vendace, it is 
said, derived its name from Vendois in France, and was brought to 
this country by one of the James's. This, however, is mere conjec- 
ture, and, from what we know of its habits, highly improbable, — be- 
cause they die the moment they are either touched, or exposed to the 
air. This beautiful fish measures from four to six inches in length, 
and tapers gradually to the tail. When taken out of the water, it has 
a bright silvery-white appearance, with a slight tendency to a hght 
blue along the back and part of the sides. In size, it resembles a small 
herring or par, butparticularly the former, not only in the mouth and 
the external appearance, but also in the anatomical structure. Upon 
the top of the head, there is a very distinct shape of a heart, covered 
with a transparent substance of a brownish colour, resembling a 

» According to Mr Stewart, in his Elements of Natural History, the vendace be- 
longs to a species which he calls the " Sahno albula," or the « Juvangis." " This spe- 
cies " he adds, " is found in Lochmaben, in Scotland, and nowhere else ; and is said 
to have been carried thither from England in the time of Robert the Bruce. It is 
thickly covered with roundish, entire, black spotted imbricated scales of.a greenish- 
brown colour, and white on the sides." From this description, it is evident that Mr 
Stewart had never seen a vendace, else he would have described it in a different man- 
ner. Of all the distinct species which this lake is said to contain, not one of them, 
so far as ever fell under our observation, will answer Mr Stewart s description. 1 he 
perch has entire black spotted scales, but not imbricated; the perch, however, is as 
distinct from the vendace as the cod is from the salmon. 



LOCHMABEN. 381 

thin lamina of mica slate, through which the brain is visible. This 
particular mark proves it to be as yet a distinct and an undescrib- 
ed species. Nothing is ever found visible to the naked eye in 
the stomach of the vendace. They are extremely delicate, and 
are allowed to be the most pleasing to the taste of all fish. The 
general mode of taking them is with a net, as there is no instance 
known of their having been caught either with bait or the artifi- 
cial fly. The pike, with which this lake abounds, is their great- 
est enemy, as he is seldom taken in the neighbourhood of the 
particular places which they frequent without being found gorged 
with them. 

The salmon was found formerly in great abundance in the An - 
nan and its tributaries, but since the stake-nets were erected at 
the mouth of the river, they have greatly decreased. In addition, 
the salmon fry has many enemies, particularly the carrion crow, 
the water-ouzel, and the heron. The moment a bed of spawn 
is seen to spring up by any of these birds, not one of them is left. 
The sea-trout and the herling [Salmo albus are both found in 
considerable numbers. They ascend the river sometimes so early 
as June, if the season has been wet and the river swollen. The 
par, about which so many disputes have arisen, is plentiful in all 
the rivers which communicate with the Annan.f 

Reptiles. — The most dreaded is the adder  Vipera communis, 
which is very common, and generally seen in dry mosses and around 
the bottom of old turf dikes. The water newt, or eft, the com- 
mon eft, which is found in cellars and damp houses, the frog 
and the toad are also common. The Lacerta agilis is frequently 
seen running with all its speed among dry mosses and heathery 
moors. 

Birds. — The common species are all found in the parish. 
Among the more rare, I may mention the white owl  Strix fiam- 

• Dr Knox, Lecturer upon Anatomy in Edinburgh, states that he has not only 
discovered the food of the vendace, but actually exhibited it some months ago before the 
members of the Royal Society, and offers suggestions for the stocking of the various 
lakes in Britain with this exquisite fish, pointing out first the necessity of locating 
its natural food, without which it cannot live. Allowing, however, that the space of 
some neighbouring lake could be covered with some of these invisible and " incredibly 
minute entomostraceous animals, which," the learned lecturer says, " constitute their 
food," we should still find a difficulty to transfer the fish, as every attempt to do so 
hitherto, though conducted with the greatest possible care and nicety, has failed. 

f It has been stated as a fact, that the par is always found in rivers which salmon 
frequent. While in Morayshire last autumn, we made particular inquiry at the fish- 
ermen upon the Sjiey if they had ever seen the par ; to our astonishment, each of 
them declarecl he never had. This must be considered as a very sttong evidence that 
the par is a distinct species.

mea. J The water-ouzel f Cinclus aquaticus, most destructive to the 
salmon fry, is very common about the lochs and the rivers. The 
missel-thrush  Turdus viscivorus J is found both at Halleaths and 
Elshieshields. The stone-chats are in great abundance on the 
Lochmaben moors. The golden-crested wren f Regulus cristatus,J 
the willow or silver-wren breed around Halleaths. The titmice 
are all common, except the long-tailed one, which I have only 
seen once in the garden at Elshieshields. The white and yel- 
low wagtails are very common about the lakes. The different 
species of linnets are found in great abundance. The raven f Cor- 
vus corax is occasionally seen by the sides of the lakes picking 
up the small fish that happen to come within his reach. The 
hooded-crow is seldom seen. The jay  Garrulus glandarius, 
though not abundant, is found in the woods of Elshieshields. The 
goat-sucker  Caprirnulgus Europaeiis is frequently seen at night- 
fall, and its nest has been found at Halleaths. The pheasant is 
frequently shot in the parish ; — also the black-cock and grouse, 
which breed within a mile of the town. The quail  Perdix Cotur- 
nix,J and the butcher-bird f Lanius coUurio,J have both been seen. 

Aquatic Birds. — The heron breeds in great numbers at Hal- 
leaths, — the numerous lakes and streams in the neighbourhood sup- 
plying them with ample food. The heron, in this part of the coun- 
try, is very seldom destroyed, from a belief that it devours the 
adder. The water-rail f Rallus aquaticus J is very abundant about 
the outlets from the lakes. The curlew f Scolopax arquata, the 
lapwing Vanelliis cristatus,J the golden plover f Charadrius plu- 
vialis,J the snipe f Scolopax gallinago, and the woodcock  S. 
rusticola, are all common, particularly the S. gallinago. The 
cormorant  Pelecanus carho  is seen fishing in the Castle loch, 
or sitting upon some insulated spot. The wild-duck, the teal 
 Anas crecca, and the coot  Fulica atra, are all abundant in the 
Castle and Hightae lochs, around which the common wild duck 
breeds in great numbers. The kingfisher  Alcedo ispida,J a shy 
bird, is frequently seen upon the banks of the Annan and of the JE. 
The swan and wild goose resort to the lochs in severe winters. 

n. — Civil History. 

Robert Bruce, first King of Scotland, was born in the old castle 
situated between the Kirk and Castle lochs, which was the chief re- 
sidence of the Bruces till the end of the thirteenth century. 

The writer of this article is not aware that any person particularly 
distinguished in the arts and sciences, or in literature, claims this

parisli as his birth-place. It may, however, be remarked, that there 
are at present six ordained clergymen in the Church of Scotland, 
two Dissenters enjoying livings, six licentiates, four parish school- 
masters, and seven surgeons who were educated at Lochmaben by 
one master, who is still pursuing his vocation, but, unfortunately 
for himself, not in the parish where he taught for many years with 

so much success. 

Land-oic7iers.—Wiih[n the burgh roods there are no fewer 
than 141 small proprietors, and in the landward part of the parish 
106, making in whole 247, who pay stipend to the clergyman. 
The principal land-owners are Andrew Johnston, Esq. of Halleaths; 
John Dickson, Esq. of Elshieshields ; Sir William Jardine, Bart, 
of Applegarth ; William Murray, Esq. of Castlemains ; The Most 
Noble Charles Marquis of Queensberry; John Brown, Esq of 
Broad Chapel; John Maxwell, Esq. of Esbie; His Grace the Duke 
of Buccleuch ; David Parish Junior, Esq. of Todhillmoore ; and 
Sir James Broun, Bart, of Mayfield. Four only are resident, — 
Mr Dickson, Mr Brown, Sir James Broun, and Mr Parish. 

Parochial Registers.—The earliest date of baptisms and mar- 
riages is 1765. These registers have been most carefully and re- 
gularly kept from the above date to the present time. In this pa- 
rish, the Dissenters shew as much anxiety for the registration of 
their children as the members of the Established Church. 

Modern Buildings. — The principal mansion-houses are Hal- 
leaths, Elshieshields, and Newmains. 

Castles. — There is the site of an ancient castle close to the town, 
on a mound of considerable height, called the Castle-hill, which 
is surrounded by a deep moat and fosse. This castle was built in 
the twelfth century, and formed the chief residence of Robert 
Bruce, Lord of Annandale, previous to that family coming to the 
throne of Scotland. This noble family had two other seats in the 
Annandale district, one at Annan, the other at Hoddam, on the 
east bank of the river, with a large estate which continued in their 
possession long after they came to the Crown. 

The other Castle of Lochmaben, which stands upon a peninsula 
on the south-east side of the Castle -loch, was by far the largest and 
strongest of any, either upon the English or Scotch borders ; and 
before the invention of gunpowder was deemed impregnable. It 
was built by Robert Bruce, the first of that name, King of Scot- 
land, towards the end of the thirteenth century. Tradition says 
that the stones of the old one were taken to build this, and the

place is pointed out where these stones were laid down, and carried 
across a portion of the loch to the present castle. This castle, in- 
cluding the out-works, covers nearly sixteen acres. It contains 
three courts strongly built with hewn stone. The walls in the few 
places where they are entire, measure twelve feet in thickness. It 
was surrounded by three deep fosses running from east to west, 
within which there was a bason built of stone of superior workman- 
ship for holding the boats, and protecting them from the attacks 
of their enemies and the weather. In those days the principal en- 
trance was by water, and from the ground being marshy around the 
castle for more than a mile, with a narrow neck of land leading to 
the outer fosse, must have rendered it not only a place of great 
strength, but also very difficult of access. It was preserved as a 
border fence till the union of the crowns. Before that time a gar- 
rison of 200 men was constantly kept in this castle, and the gover- 
nor was maintained by very liberal provisions till the reign of James 
VI., when border hostilities ceased. Among the titles of the Mar- 
quis of Annandale, he assumed that of Constable or Hereditary 
Keeper of Lochmaben Castle. A salary of L. 300 Scots, with the 
exclusive fishings in the castle and mill lochs, with boats and nets, 
was given to the keeper. James VI., in 1612, granted to the cor- 
poration of Lochmaben the fishings of the six lakes near the town ; 
but the present proprietor of Castlemains tried the legality of this 
grant before the Court of Session, and obtained a decreet in ab- 
sence, and now claims the exclusive right of the whole fishings in 
the Castle loch around which his property lies. The governor of 
the castle had also for the maintenance of the garrison what was 
called " a Lairdna Mairt," or " Lairdner Mairt cow," which was 
one of the best fat cows out of every parish in Annandale, and 
thirty-nine meadow geese and fastin e'ens hens. These were claim- 
ed by the Marquis of Annandale about a hundred years ago. The 
conversion of this claim was L. 20 Scots, which was uplifted out of 
thirty-three parishes, now reduced, by annexations at the Refor- 
mation, to twenty-one. Since that period, no demand for payment 
has been made. The castle was allowed to fall into ruins during 
the seventeenth century, and the only remaining part is the heart 
of the walls, from which the ashler work has been almost stripped 
off, and there are few houses in the neighbourhood in which some 
of the stones are not seen. The hewn stones were of red sand- 
stone, and in all probability procured from the red stone quarry of 
Corncocklemoor, in the upper district of the parish. The lime

with which the heart of the walls was filled up, is as hard and firm 
as at the time when the castle was built,— the weather having no in- 
fluence upon it whatever. In former times, there were a deer park 
and an oak forest of considerable extent around the castle. 

Specllin's Toiuer. — This old tower stands on the north of the pa- 
rish, and was formerly the residence of the Jardines of Applegarth. 
It is strongly vaulted with walls of an immense thickness, flanked by 
round turrets at the angles. The entrance is on the north side, near 
the north-east angle, through a circular door, and has on each side a 
transverse loop-hole. Over the centre, at the top of the tower, is a 
square tablet containing the coat of arms of the Jardines, and the 
date 1605, probably the last time it was repaired. It is surround- 
ed by a number of fine trees, and on two of its sides it is closely 
mantled with ivy. 

Rockhall Mount or Moat. — This moat, in particular, is of very 
remote antiquity. It is a fine mound of earth perfectly round, and 
terminating in a sharp point. It is the largest and most entire of 
any in the parish or neighbourhood, and is situated upon the side 
of a ridge of hills which overhang the castle, and separate Annan- 
dale from Nithsdale, and overlook an extensive plain at the foot of 
the river Nith, part of Galloway, and all the Solway Frith. It 
is generally believed that the people met on these moats to enact 
laws and administer justice. We are rather of opinion that this 
moat, or, as it is more frequently called, the " Beacon-hill," was 
used as a place for keeping watch against the border marauders, 
and upon which fires were kindled to put the 'inhabitants of the 
lower grounds upon their guard against predatory incursions. 

 This tower is rendered famous over the country by a story of a ghost. Sir Alex- 
ander Jardine, in the reign of Charles II., had confined in the dungeon of his tower 
of Spedlin, a man named Porteous, by trade a miller, suspected of wilfully having 
set fire to his own premises. Being soon after suddenly called to Edinburgh, he ear- 
ried the key of the vault with him, and forgot the prisoner till he was passing through 
the West Port of Edinburgh. Sir Alexander immediately sent back a servant to 
liberate Porteous, but, in the meantime, he died of hunger, and in the extremity of 
his sufferings he had devoured one of his hands and feet. No sooner was the man 
dead, than his ghost began to torment the household, and no rest was to be had within 
the tower of Spedlins by night or by day. In this dilemma. Sir Alexander summon- 
ed a number of mmisters to his aid, and by their prayers, Porteous was confined to 
the scene of his mortal agonies, where he continued to scream occasionally at night, 
and to flutter like a bird against the door of his vault, and to remove the bark from 
any twig that was thrust through the key hole. The spell which forced the spirit to 
rcrnain in bondage was attached to a large black letter Bible used by the exorcists, 
and afterwards deposited in a stone niche in the wall of the staircase. This Bible 
requiring to be rebound was sent to Edinburgh, but immediately upon its removal, 
the ghost getting out and crossing the river, made such a noise in the new mansion- 
house, hauling the Baronet and his lady out of bed, that the Bible was recalled and 
placed in Us former situation. It was printed in London, by Robert Baker, in the 
year 1634.

There are remains of several Roman encampments in the parish, 
and the road which Agricola must have taken, on leaving his en- 
campment on Burnswark, to Glota and Bodotria, can readily be 
pointed out. 

Ancient Relics. — Many years ago, a person residing at Heck, 
in the close neighbourhood of the castle, found an immensely mas - 
sive key, supposed to be the one that opened the lock of the prin- 
cipal gate which led to the castle. This ancient rehc was offered to 
several persons for the sum of 2s. 6d., but no purchaser at that price 
could be found, and the person who got it had it converted by the 
blacksmith into two spades for cutting peat. In digging round the 
remains of the castle, several horse -shoes, spurs, old rusted keys, 
and large nails of very rude formation, have been found ; also some 
large cannon balls, supposed to have been fired against the castle 
in the time of Oliver Cromwell. There was a large plain gold 
ring, without any inscription, picked up some years ago, by the 
tenant's daughter, at the side of the loch in front of the castle. 
Many were the conjectures with regard to the history and former 
owner of this ring ; but we have little hesitation in stating that, in 
all probability, from its modern construction, it must have been 
dropt by some of the numerous parties who visit the remains of the 
castle. The ring is now in the possession of Lord Queensberry, who 
gave a handsome price for it to the finder. Two years ago, a party, 
while fishing with a net in a part of the loch on the east side of the 
castle, dragged up the head of a spear, in fine preservation, made of 
a composition of old mixed brass, or that species of copper which 
Pliny names " caldarium," or cast in a mould. The head was nine 
inches long, and the socket in which the handle was inserted about 
half an inch in diameter. It resembled the Roman pilum or hasta. 
This kind of weapon was not peculiar to the Romans alone, as all 
nations had spears. We know the Celtse had their lancea, spa- 
rum, and matara, to which the Roman liasta was similar. A small 
piece of the handle still adhered to it, but upon its drying crum- 
bled into dust. It is in the possession of John Dickson, Esq. of 
Elshieshields. 

Coins. — Coins have frequently been found in this parish. Six 
years ago, a workman cutting peat in the Whitehills moss, about 
three-quarters of a mile from the town, turned out a considerable 
quantity of small coins wrapt up in a piece of strong blue cloth. 
They were all silver groats of Alexander I. of Scotland and Ed- 



LOCHMABEN.

ward I. of England. Coins of Robert III., Henry VIII., Queen 
Elizabeth, and Queen Mary, have been found in the parish. 

Barony of Lochmahen or Fourtoim&amp;.—ln the immediate neigh- 
bourhood of the castle lies the barony of Lochmahen, or, as it is 
more frequently called, the Fourtowns, which consists of four vil- 
lages, named the Hightae the largest, which contains a popula- 
tion of 391 ; the Heck, 69; the Greenhill, 80; and the Small- 
holm, 65. The tract of holm ground around these villages is un- 
commonly rich and fertile. The proprietors hold these lands by 
a singular and peculiar tenure. From time immemorial, they were 
called the « King's kindly tenants," or the Crown's " rentallers." 
As the lands belonged to the Kings of Scotland, and formed part 
of the original royal domains, or proper patrimony of the Crown, 
it is generally believed that they were granted in small pendicles 
by King Robert Bruce Lord of Annanale to the domestic ser- 
vants of the castle, though at what particular period, it has not 
been ascertained. The principal obligation incumbent on the te- 
nants or rentallers was, to furnish provisions and other necessaries 
for the use of the royal fortress ; and it is more than probable that 
the tenants composed the garrison itself. They had no written 
title to these lands, that is, neither charter nor seisin, and in the 
case of transference by a tenant of his right to a single successor, 
it is effected simply by a deed of conveyance, followed by posses- 
sion or enrolment in the rental book of Lord Stormont, which is 
done without fee or reward by his Lordship's factor; and the suc- 
cession is taken up without service. The constable of the castle 
frequently treated them in a very arbitrary manner. They presented 
a petition and complaint to King James VI., stating that, notwith- 
standing their being kindly tenants and occupiers of His Majesty's 
farm lands and tenantry, assigned to His Majesty's House of Loch- 
mahen, they, among other grievances, were subjected to extortion by 
the constables of the castle. In consequence of this representation. 
His Majesty, by a warrant under his sign-manual, ordered the keep- 
ers of the Castle of Lochmahen to desist and cease from molesting, 
troubhng, or using any violence against those his tenants, and to suffer 
and permit them peaceably to occupy their possessions, as they, the 
keepers, should answer to his Majesty upon their disobedience. 

In the reign of Charles II., the tenants were again under the 
necessity of applying to the Crown for protection. His Majesty, 
in 1664, issued a warrant under his sign-manual, setting forth, "that 
he understood the poor kindly tenants of his proper Crown lands 



388 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



of Hightae, Smallholm, Heck, and Greenhill, have been exorbi- 
tantly raised in their rents and services, contrary to the express war- 
rants of his Majesty's grandfather, dated in 1592 and 1602, grant- 
ed to their predecessors on weighty and good considerations ; there- 
fore, his Majesty declares his royal intention, that the said tenants 
should be protected, and these warrants obeyed as constant leases, 
according to the true meaning thereof; and of new authorizes the 
said tenants and their successors to possess and enjoy their respec- 
tive lands, — they paying and performing yearly the rent and ser- 
vices paid by their ancestors in the year 1602; and prohibits and 
discharges the keepers of the Castle of Lochmaben, or any who 
shall pretend right to the said Crown lands, in all time coming, to 
exact more rent or services from the tenants thereof than they were 
in use to pay and perform at the dates of the said warrants, or to 
remove them from their aicient possessions, so long as they thank- 
fully pay and perform the same." 

Besides the lands lying around the villages, there was a large 
and extensive commonty, in which they all had an interest. By 
mutual agreement, this commonty was divided many years ago, and 
their several portions improved, and substantial houses built upon 
them, which, from their extent, are of more value than the origi- 
nal property. The greater proportion of these lands have been 
purchased by Mr Bell of Rammerscales, a neighbouring proprietor.

Character, Sc. of the People. — In this burgh and parish, no 
doubt, a considerable quantity of ardent spirits is consumed : but 
in general the inhabitants are sober, industrious, religious, and 
many of them of considerable intellectual attainments. Within 
these last forty years, great improvements have taken place, in re- 
gard to their comfort, both in houses and in clothing. 

The prevailing game in summer is quoits, which is played by 
many with great dexterity ; and in winter, curling. As players of

the latter interesting game, the parishioners of Lochmaben have

both in same and in the salmon fisheries. Smuggling is unknown 
in the parish.

Rent, Wages, Prices of Stock, Sc.—ln a parish of this kind, where 
the soil is so various, the rent per acre must vary accordingly. Some 
of the fine croft land in the immediate neighbourhood of the town 
lets at L. 3 and L. 2, 10s. per acre. The lighter soils and high 
grounds generally give from L. 1 to L. If 5s. The leases of the 
principal farms are for nineteen or twenty-one years. The smaller 
farms vary from nine to fifteen years. 

The grazing of a milk cow with a calf or stirk is from L. 4 to 
L. 4, 10s. Few sheep comparatively speaking are kept in the parish. 
Cows vary in price according to size, age, and condition, from L. 6 to 
L. 10. Two year old stots of the Galloway breed bring from L. 5 
to L. 7, 10s. Few farmers keep their young stock more than two 
years, which is generally of the Galloway kind. This stock is well 
adapted for the pastures on the banks of the different rivers, and 
owing to its richness, they rise to a great size, and bring high prices. 
The farmer finds it his advantage to pay great attention to the 
breeding and rearing of cattle, as his profits depend much more 
upon a good sale of his live-stock, than on the returns from his 
grain produce. It is well known in Annandale that if cattle give 
good prices, the landlord is sure to be paid his rent. The greater 
part of these cattle are purchased by English dealers, and sent to 
Norfolk, and fattened on the English pastures for the Smithfield 
market, where they find ready purchasers, on account of the fine 
quality of their beef. This breed in general does not yield much 
milk, but the cream is very rich. They have no horns, are hardy, 
docile and good feeders. Many of the poor people who keep a 
cow pay little attention to the breed, provided they be, what they 
call good milkers ; hence they prefer a kind of cross-breed which 
is common about Biggar and Carnwath. 

There is one enterprising farmer in the parish, Mr John Halli- 



390 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE 



day of Broatlholm, who keeps an extensive dairy. He prefers the 
Ayrshire breed, as affording a larger quantity of milk. In point of 
symmetry they are very inferior to the Galloway breed, their should- 
ers being thin, and the fore quarters light. There is also another 
dairy at Broad Chapel. 

Farm horses able for their work can be purchased from L. 18 
to L. 30 ; the best bring L. 35, and sometimes L. 45. The colour 
is generally black, brown, or gray. A few years ago, gray was 
the favourite colour. A considerable number is bred and reared 
in the parish. They are of a good size, and bring high prices ; 
hence many good judges prefer them to the finest of the Clydes- 
dale breed. 

Feeding of pigs is carried on to a great extent in this parish. 
Many of the farmers send to market every season from thirty to 
forty carcases, averaging fifteen stones each. The price varies from . 
4s. to 5s 6d. per stone. This is a great source of revenue to the 
neighbourhood, and as all the sales are effected for ready money, 
it enables many of the smaller tenants to pay their rents. Forty 
years ago, business in pork was done in Annandale to the amount 
of L. 10,000; and the quantity reared and fed in the parish last year 
brought the large sum of L. 3411 at 4s. per stone. Every cottager 
keeps a couple of pigs, the price of which enables him to obtain in 
moderation the common luxuries of hfe during the winter season. 

Improvements in Agriculture. — All the modern improvements 
have been introduced into this district, such as the improvements of 
waste lands by draining and fencing, the use of bone dust and rape 
cake for the raising of turnips, and eating them off" upon the fields 
by sheep ; also the cutting or pairing of peat-moss, and burning 
it upon the ground, after which good crops of oats are raised, or 
the land is converted into meadow by irrigation. No doubt, for 
some years past, the low price received for land produce has damp- 
ed the spirit of improvement — but the lowering of the rents by 
most of the great landed proprietors has tended much to induce 
the farmer to persevere in his improvements, in the hope of better 
times. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Markets, Roads. — By the activity of the present magistrates, and 
a few other respectable inhabitants, markets have again been regu- 
larly instituted. There are two principal fairs in the year for hir- 
ing farm-servants, which are numerously attended, the neighbouring 

farmers giving them their support. During the winter season there 

4 



LOCHMABEN. 



391 



is a reo-ular weekly market for pork, in which business is done to 
a Uirge amount. In order to give encouragement to these markets 
smaU premiums were given both to the person who brought the 
hirgest quantity to market, and also to the person who made the 

largest purchases. 

Boads.—ln this district, the roads of late have been much im- 
proved and kept in excellent order. A road from Glasgow to 
Carlisle runs for ten miles through the parish, but it is not much 
frequented, as travellers prefer the one by Beatock Inn, to Lock- 
erby. There is another excellent road which runs for six miles 
through the parish, giving great facility and safest, at all seasons, 
to travellers from the east to Dumfries. On this new line, a hand- 
some bridge is built across the Annan. This road runs for a mile 
along the north-west side of the Castle loch, and enters Lochma- 
ben at the new church. No mail-coach passes through the 
town, but a stage-coach runs from Dumfries by Lochmaben, 
Lockerbie, and Ecclefechan to Langholm. It was at one time 
contemplated to run the Dumfries mail by Lochmaben, but the 
road trustees objected on account of the expense of building a 
bridge across the JE, and of making a few miles of new road. 
There is a daily post from Edinburgh ; a runner from Lochmaben 
awaits the arrival of the mail at Dumfries, so that a letter put into 
the Edinburgh post-office the previous evening at nine o'clock is 
delivered next morning at Lochmaben about ten o'clock. 

Burgh of Lochmahen. — Lochmaben is a burgh of very ancient 
date, though at this distance of time the time of its erection cannot 
be correctly ascertained. The tradition is, that it was made a royal 
burgh soon after the accession of Bruce to the throne. When 
the Duke of Albany, the Lord of Annandale, was summoned in 
1479, to answer the charges of treason, the summons was execut- 
ed by the herald, at the market-cross of Dumfries, and also, 
"apud crucem fori burgi de Lochmaben," and, moreover, at the cas- 
tle of Lochmaben ; and one of the witnesses of the execution at the 
burgh and castle of Lochmaben, was Robert Henrison, Bailie of 
Lochmaben. This shews that, in 1479, Lochmaben was a burgh, 
and had its bailies, and a market-cross, at which the process of 
the law was usually executed. Like other border towns, it suffer- 
ed much from the inroads of the English, and was frequently burnt 
and plundered, so that its charter and records were destroyed. In 
1463, the Earl of Warwick led an army into Dumfries-shire, and 
burnt the town of Lochmaben. In 1484, the Earl of Douglas, 



392 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



and the traitor Duke of Albany attempted to plunder Loclimaben 
on St Magdalene's fair day; but they were disappointed. In a 
charter oi novodamus, granted the 16th July 1612, by James VI. 
he gives as a reason for its renewal, that the burgh records had 
been destroyed when it was burnt by the English. This charter 
confirms all former charters which had been burnt, and it grants 
of new to the said burgh all the lands belonging to the same. It 
also gave full power to the inhabitants to elect magistrates for the 
government of the people thereof. We may state here, that Wil- 
liam Maxwell sat in the Scots Parliament, as commissioner for the 
burgh of Lochmaben in October 1612. This is the first instance 
that can be traced of its representation in Parliament. 

This burgh is governed by a provost, three bailies, a dean of guild, 
a treasurer, and nine ordinary councillors. There are five incorporat- 
ed trades, which annually elect their deacons and oflice-bearers; and 
the deacons with the masters of craft, choose their convener ; but 
none of them ex officio are members of the town council. The 
revenues of this burgh are very small, arising from the feu-duties 
and customs which are collected within the burgh roods. These 
funds are at present under the judicial management of the Lords of 
Session. The town contains about 1000 inhabitants, 39 of whom 
have votes under the Reform Bill for a member of Parliament. This 
burgh was one of the few which did not come under the spirit of the 
Reform Act, farther than losing its power, which perhaps was its 
greatest, as one of the five burghs which returned a member to Par- 
liament. There is a very handsome town-hall with a spire and clock, 
built in 1745, — under which there is the jail and a lock-up-house, 
with an arched space in front for weighing the different commodities 
brought to market. When the cross, which was standing in 1479, was 
destroyed, there is a story told of the manner in which the magis- 
trates for the time being got the present one erected. At the time 
the castle of Elshieshields was built, some of the building materials 
were left remaining; and Lochmaben being without a cross, which 
was indispensable in all burghs, the town council, as the price of these 
materials for erecting the cross, made over to the laird of Elshie- 
shields, his heirs and successors, the mill and mill lands of Loch- 
maben, being a part of the burgh property, from which lands the 
present proprietor draws L. 100 Sterhng. 

There are no manufactories or trade of any kind carried on, 
so as to induce strangers to settle in the burgh. Some years 
ago, large quantities of flax were raised in this parish, — which 



LOCHMABEN.

was manufactured into cloth and sold unbleached in England to the 
amount of 60,000 yards annually. A great proportion of the inha- 
bitants farm small crofts, from the produce of which they bring up 
and educate their families, — the males generally seeking their for- 
tune in other lands. 

Ecclesiastical State. — Robert de Brus, who married the bastard 
daughter of William the Lion, in the year 1183, granted to the 
monks of Gisburn the church of Lochmaben. A discussion, soon 
after, arose between the monks and the diocesan, on the proper con- 
struction of this grant. The dispute was settled in 1223, — to the ef- 
fect that the monks were to retain the tithes of the corn, and to receive 
three merks yearly from the rector of Lochmaben. The Bishop of 
Glasgow was to exercise the power of ordination and collation. But 
there was reserved to William de Glencairn, the church of Loch- 
maben, with the chapel of Rokle for life, paying yearly to the monks 
three-and-thirty marks. In Bagimont's Roll, during the reign of 
James V., the rectory of Lochmaben was taxed L. 5, 6s. 8d., being 
a tenth of the estimated value. In 1612, the barony of Lochmaben, 
with the tithes and the advowson of the church, was granted by 
James VI. to John Murray, groom of his Majesty's bed-chamber, 
and ratified in Parliament. In 1625, he was created Earl of Annan- 
dale, and Lord Murray of Lochmaben. On the death of his son 
James, the second Earl of Annandale, without issue, in 1658, the 
lands of Lochmaben, with the patronage of the church, were inherit- 
ed by his heir-male, David Viscount Stormont ; and the patronage 
now belongs to the Earl of Mansfield. Besides the chapel of 
Rokle, there are vestiges of several others in the parish. In the 
fifteenth century, the bailies of Lochmaben endowed a chaplaincy 
at the altar of the Virgin Mary, in the church of Lochmaben ; and 
they granted an acre of land, with the marsh, which is commonly 
called the Struther, with the second turn of the multures of the mill. 
This endowment was confirmed by James III., 28th April I486. 

The old church, which was taken down in 1818, was a Gothic 
buddmg with a large choir attached, dedicated to Mary Magdalene. 
In one of the bloody feuds between the Maxwells of Nithsdale and 
the Johnstones of Annandale, which took place on Dryff-e sands in 
the year 1592, the Maxwells were defeated with great slaughter, 
and m their flight took refuge in the kirk of Lochmaben, which the 
Johnstones burned to the ground. It may be mentioned, that the 
original key was found by some of the workmen while taking down 
the church. It was given to the clergyman, the Rev. Mr Gib-

son, who caused it to be presented to the Antiquarian Society. 
The new church, a handsome substantial building, capable of con- 
taining 1700 sitters, was opened for pubUc worship in the year 
1819, and cost the heritors, including a new wall round the church- 
yard, the sum of L. 3000. The heritors agreed to remove the 
church from its original site in the churchyard, and placed it at the 
south end of the burgh. The situation is very centrical, being 
nearly equidistant from all the extreme points in the parish. 

The manse, which is still in tolerable repair, was built in the 
year 1761. The late worthy incumbent frequently proposed to the 
heritors to have a new manse, and had fixed upon the site, about 
600 yards east of the church in front of the Castle loch; but, though 
he offered to contribute L. 100 towards the expense of the build- 
ing, the plan was given up, as it was found no easy matter to gam 
the consent of 247 heritors. The glebe is very small, consisting 
of one acre lying very near to the manse, and another of meadow 
in the lower part of the parish. It was long supposed that a glebe 
belonged to this parish near to the chapel of Rokle, which is four 
miles distant from the manse. This opinion was confirmed by some 
documents that were found in the office of the chamberlain of the 
late Duke of Queensberry, in which it was discovered that an al- 
lowance was given for this glebe to a former incumbent. After the 
discovery of these documents, the late Mr Gibson took the neces- 
sary steps before the Presbytery, and then raised an action in the 
Court of Session against Lord Queensberry, the present proprie- 
tor. After a long and expensive litigation, Mr Gibson gained his 
case, though he did not live to see the excambion take place to 
which Lord Queensberry had agreed. 

Dissenting Meeting-Houses.— There are two Dissenting meet- 
ing-houses in this parish, one of which belongs to the Cameronians, 
and the other to the Burghers. The Cameronian meeting-house is 
situated in the village of Hightae, and was originally built for a Re- 
lief congregation in the year 1796, during the incumbency of the 
late Rev. Dr Andrew Brown, Professor of Rhetoric,' who was trans- 
lated from Lochmaben to the New Grayfriars, Edinburgh, in 1799. 
The managers of this chapel, some years ago, sold it to the 
Cameronians, who have now a minister settled among them. The 
congregation is a mere handful, as there are only thirty-seven Ca- 
meronians in the parish. The clergyman has no dwelling-house, 
and his stipend does not exceed L. 50. The Burgher chapel, 
which was built in 1818, is situated within the burgh roods, and 



3 



LOCHMABEN. 



395 



may contain from 800 to 900 sitters. The Burghers in the parish 
amount to nearly 100. They give a bond to their pastor for L. 80 
per annum, out of which sum he must provide himself with a 
dwelling-house. With the exception of these 136 Cameronians 
and Burghers, and 12 Roman Catholics, the remainder attend the 
parish church. The number of communicants at the last celebra- 
tion of the Lord's supper amounted to 750. 

Stipend. — In the year 1738, the stipend was fixed at 1200 Scots 
with 100 merks for communion elements. Since that period, three 
augmentations have been granted ; — the first in 1792, afterwards 
modified to a certain extent in 1796, when the stipend was aug- 
mented to four chalders of victual, half meal and half bear, and 
L. 83, 6s. lid. of money, with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion ele- 
ments. A second augmentation was granted in 1807, when the 
stipend was augmented to ten chalders of victual, half meal half 
barley, payable in money according to the highest fiar prices of 
the county, with L. 50 Sterling of money, and L. 8, 6s. 8d. for 
communion elements. Last of all, the stipend was augmented in 
1823, when it was modified to eighteen chalders of victual, half 
meal half barley, payable in money according to the highest fiar 
prices of the county, with L. 10 Sterhng for communion elements. 
There has been no final locality applicable to any of these aug- 
mentations, the payment of each of them having been all along re- 
gulated by interim decrees. A locality has now been made up, 
which embraces the whole of these augmentations. 

Education. — There are two endowed schools, — one in the burgh, 
which has the maximum salary and the interest of L. 200 Sterling 
at 5 per cent ; " mortified by the late James Richardson, Esq. 
merchant, Reading, in the year 1726, under an obligation to teach 
ten poor scholars, within the parish, nominated by the kirk-session, 
English, Latin, writing, and arithmetic." Mr Richardson also mor- 
tified another L. 100 for supporting a library, and keeping in re- 
pair a house of two storeys built by him for the accommodation of 
the schoolmaster. He likewise mortified another L. 100, and gave 
L. 20 to build a school at Hightae, and the interest of the L. 100 
in favour of the schoolmaster for the time being, who was to teach 
gratis the poor children of the Fourtowns. Mr Richardson was a 
native of Hightae. 

At an average, 50 scholars attend the public school in the 
burgh. The present master, an efficient teacher, has eleven pupils 
learnmg Greek and Latin at 5s. per quarter. 



396 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



There at-e three other schools in the town, besides one in the 
upper district of the parish, and another in the west division. The 
schools in the burgh are well attended, particularly one of them, 
which in the winter season is attended by more than 80 scho 
lars. There is also an excellent school for girls kept by a most 
respectable and well-educated person, assisted by her niece, in which 
sewing and other useful practical branches of female education are 
ably taught. 

The average number of scholars for the last seven years who 
have attended the Hightae school, amounts to 51. The fees are 
considerably lower than in the burgh school. The salary is one 
chalder of meal, collected from a great number of heritors, by 
the merks value, with the interest of L. 100 at five per cent. 
There are none of the present generation upwards of fifteen years 
of age who cannot read and write. There is a Sunday school under 
the management of the Burgher clergyman and his assistants, 
which is well attended. There is also another at Hightae. These 
schools are supported by pubhc collections in their own chapels. 

Literature. — A new hbrary was instituted in 1819. One of the 
original subscribers was the celebrated African traveller. Captain 
Hugh Clapperton, who was at that time residing in Lochmaben 
with his aunt, a descendant of Johnstone of Thornewhate, who 
was formerly an extensive proprietor in the parish. This library 
is very select, and the most approved works in the various depart- 
ments of literature and history are annually added. , 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — In this large and populous parish 
no regular assessments have as yet been made, the heritors prefer- 
ring to make up the deficiency, when necessary, by voluntary contri- 
butions. There are, at the present time, upon the poors' roll 34 per- 
sons, besides a considerable number who occasionally receive relief. 
The sum disbursed last year amounted to L. 81, 10s. 7d., of which 
one fatuous person received L. 10, and some old and feeble indi- 
viduals L. 4 each. The weekly collections average neariy 16s., — 
which sum, along with what arises from the proclamation of mar- 
riages, mortcloth dues, and fines inflicted for immoral conduct and 
irregular marriages, in ordinary seasons, nearly meets the expendi- 
ture. There was a considerable sum of money belonging to the 
poor of the parish ; but unfortunately it fell into the hands of a 
person who became bankrupt, and the greater part of it was lost. 
There are four blind persons, and four deaf and dumb in the pa- 
rish ; one of the blind only receives aid from the poors' funds. It

appears to be the general opinion over Scotland, that the inde- 
pendent feeling which was wont to make the sons and daughters of 
the poor labour hard to support their parents, and to alvoid the 
disgrace of being told that they were upon the poors' roll, is now 
fast dying away. We regret to say that it is so in this parish to a 
certain degree. 

Lins. — There are three very comfortable inns in the burgh, be- 
sides several dram-shops in the different villages and parts of the 
parish. There cannot be a doubt that one-half of these places 
of entertainment is quite sufficient for the wants of the inhabitants 
and of travellers ; but we deem it only justice to add, that, from 
the respectability of the landlords of the three inns, these houses 
are kept in a superior and orderly manner, and all excess in drink- 
ing is prevented. 

Fuel. — The fuel generally used is peat, which costs per cart load 
from lOd. to Is., exclusive of cartage, though a great number of 
families partly use coal, which is brought by sea from Maryport 
and Whitehaven in Cumberland to Dumfries, and costs Is. per 
measure, the measure being equal to twenty-eight and a quarter 
gallons, six of which make a good cart load. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Since 1792, when the last Statistical Account was written, a 
great and striking change has taken place in the state and ap- 
pearance of this parish. The commonty, which has been divided 
and improved, and which was formerly a bleak moor, has given a 
new aspect to the west division, as the proprietors appear emulous, 
to surpass one another in their improvements. 

Want of coal and lime in the immediate neighbourhood has been ' 
felt as a considerable drawback to improvements. Some years ago, 
a survey was made by Mr Jardine, civil-engineer, for a canal from 
the mouth of the Solway Frith, to terminate in the Castle loch. 
If this plan had been executed, it would have been attended with ' 
unspeakable advantages, not only to this, but to all the parishes in 
and around Annandale. If this canal, as was proposed, had been 
7 feet deep, and 28 wide at top, and from 18 to 20 at bottom. 
It would have been capable of receiving vessels which would carry 
60 or 70 tons, and draw six feet of water. The whole expense was 
thus calculated: A lock to raise a vessel 8 feet, L. 1000; two 
locks, L. 2000 ; cutting the canal per mile, L. 1000 ; the distance 
bemg 12 mdes, whole would cost L. 14,000

THE REV. WILLIAM BROWN, D.D. MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Boundaries, Topographical Appearance, 8fc. — The parish of 
Eskdalemuir, as its name imports, consists of the lands lying at 
the head of Eskdale. It is the largest parish in the county of 
Dumfries, and contains, according to Mr Crawford's map, 33,595 
Scots acres, 42,250 English acres, and 66 square miles. The 
range of mountains that crosses the head of the parish is part of 
that chain which extends from the source of the Clyde and Annan 
on the west, to the source of the Tyne in Northumberland on 
the east, and divides the course of the rivers in this part of Scot- 
land ; those to the north running towards Berwick, and those to 
the south emptying themselves in the Sohvay Frith. The high- 
est hills in the parish are Lochfell and Etterick, or rather, as it 
ought to be called, Eskdalemuir Pen ; for it is scarcely seen in 
Etterick, but makes a prominent feature in the scenery of Eskdale- 
muir. Its height, according to Stobie in his Map of Selkirkshire, 
is 2200 feet above the level of the sea. The White and Black 
Esks, so named from the sandy and mossy soils over which they 
run, take their rise in the parish, and, uniting at the foot of it, 
form that beautiful river which, after receiving many tributary 
streams, loses itself in the Solway at Longtown in Cumberland. 
Although styled a muir, heather is scarcely to be seen in the pa- 
rish. The hills in sight of the river are green, and the more re- 
tired parts are moss, covered with bent  Carices and other water 
plants. The soil, owing to the flatness of the grounds, is in many 
places wet ; but it has been much improved during the last forty 
years by draining. 

Hydrography. — There are two cascades worthy of notice ; — the 
one at the back of Fingland-hill, called Wellsburnspout, of about 
fifty-six feet, and which, during a heavy rain, covers the rock near 



ESKDALEMUIR.

the bottom to the width of forty-nine feet. The Garvald Linns 
is the other. These are seen by every person going to Garvald. 
On first leaving the public road that conducts to the head of the 
parish, the channel of the Garvald -water is rocky, and its banks 
steep ; but as these become less so, the attention is gradually with- 
drawn to other objects. It is when the mind is in this state that the 
Garvald Linns first present themselves. The effect is what might 
be expected. One is struck with the grandeur of the scene ; vast 
rocks, rugged precipices, steep banks, covered here and there with 
mountain-ashes and wild honeysuckle, — and the river now disappear- 
ing among the huge masses, and again, as if glad to be disentangled, 
hurrying on in its course. These form a group which please and 
astonish the beholder. But to see the Garvald Linns in perfec- 
tion, you must leave the road to Garvald, and go to the head of 
the bank, where the scenery is bolder. New rocks are seen, and 
a beautiful cascade of about eight feet appears. 

Meteorology. — Since writing my account of the parish to Sir 
John Sinclair in 1793, I have had time to make many observations 
on the weather and state of the atmosphere. The following table is 
formed from a series of observations made for eleven years, at Esk- 
dalemuir manse, every morning at nine o'clock, with a well regu- 
lated Fahrenheit's thermometer at a northern exposure. I consider 
them valuable from their proximity to the chain of mountains above- 
mentioned ; and because npne have been made that I know of 
nearer than Branxholm on the one hand, and Broomholm on the

In my report to Sir John Sinclair, I mentioned the letter stones 
on the farm of Twiglees. They are part of a stratum of amygda- 
loid, which can be traced from the Shawrigg in the parish of Wester- 
kirk, to Castlehill Craigs. These same letter stones occur at 
Twiglees Burnhead and Black Esk head Pikes in this parish, a dis- 
tance of six miles. They lie in a direction different from that of 
the regular strata, being from south-east to north-west. 

II. — Civil History. 
Historical Events, — I have never been able to learn to whom 
the lands in Eskdalemuir belonged, prior to the reign of James V. 
There might be, and were probably, parts granted to one or more 
proprietors before that time; but tradition says, that in general 
they were possessed by the clan of Beattieson, from whom the pre- 
sent name of Beattie is derived by no other title than that of oc- 
cupancy. It is farther stated, that Cardinal Beaton and Robert 
Lord Maxwell were sent by James as ambassadors to France in 
the year 1537, to conclude a marriage between the King and Mary 
of Guise ; that Lord Maxwell, by commission, as proxy for the 
King, married the Queen in France ; and that he and the cardinal 
conducted her to Scotland ; for which good service, the King gifted 
the lands comprehended under the name of the Five Kirks of Esk- 
dale to Lord Maxwell. It may be proper, however, to add, that 
the Five Kirks, then, were not the same as those comprehended 
under that name, now; but were Upper and Nether Ewis, Wauchope, 
Staplegordon, and Westerkirk, which last included Eskdalemuir, 
before it was erected into a separate parish. Tradition farther says, 
that, when Lord Maxwell came to take possession of the Eskdale- 
muir part of the estate having previously summoned them to meet 
him at Dumfedhng, which, and Staplegordon, were the two baro- 
nies of Eskdale, where justice was administered and business tran- 
sacted, he offered them rights to their several possessions on cer- 
tain specified conditions. These, however, they were unwilling to 
accept of, thinking themselves injured by the King's grant. Words 
rose high between Lord Maxwell and them, — consultations were 
held in his absence, and the result might have been fatal, — had not 
Holland Beattie of Watcarrick, a prudent man, warned him of his 
dano-er, and given him his white mare, which none of them could 
overtake, to carry him to Branxholm. It is further stated, that. 



I 



ESKDALEMUIR. 401 

when at Branxholm, being disgusted with the spirit of the Beatties, 
he proposed selhng the Eskdalemuir part of the estate to Scott of 
Branxholm, the ancestor of the fomily of Buccleuch, without, 
however, promising to put him in possession. This Scott of Branx- 
holm readily assented to; and being warden of the middle marches 
between Scotland and England, he raised his friends, went to Esk- 
dalemuir, and expelled all the clan Beattieson, except Roland Beat- 
tie of Watcarrick, to whom Lord Maxwell, out of gratitude for his 
preservation, had reserved a perpetual tenant-right to his posses- 
sion, on condition of his paying a certain sum annually. Scott of 
Branxholm having thus cleared the parish of the Beatties, gave, as 
was the custom of the times, feu-rights to his relations and depen- 
dents, to the greater part of it. I have been favoured with a copy of 
the division which is said to have been made at the time alluded to, 
and shall subjoin it, without, however, vouching for its accuracy. 
Scott of Harden got Over Cassock ; Scott of Davington, Upper 
and Nether Davington, Fingland, and Pentland, Upper and Nether 
Dumfedling, Nether Cassock, Wester Polclive, Wetwood Rigg, 
and Burncleugh ; Scott of Johnston got Johnston, and Johnston 
Dinnings, Raeburnfoot, Craighaugh, and Saughhill; Scott of 
Raeburn, Moodlaw, Raeburnhead, Harewoodhead, Yetbyre and 
Yards; Scott of Rennelburn, Rennelburn, Aberlosh, Midraeburn, 
Clerkhill, Greystonelee, Coatt, and Coatthope; Scott of Bailie- 
lee, Moodlawknow, Grassyards, Kimmingsyke, Langshawburn, 
and Crurie ; and Scott of Branxholm reserved to himself the up- 
per part of Thickside, Easter Polclive, Garwald Holm, Castle- 
hill, and all Black Esk. It would be a curious inquiry, how far the 
title-deeds of these several estates give confirmation of, or tend to 
overthrow, the above tradition. 

Land-oicners. — These at present are ten in number, the Duke 
of Buccleuch by far the largest, — his farms making two-thirds of 
the parish. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers reach back to 
1703, when Eskdalemuir, formerly a part of the parish of Wester- 
kirk, was erected into a separate parish. They are not volumi- 
nous; and have been regularly kept since that time. 

Antiquities. — In my former Account, I mentioned Castle O'er 
or Overbie, as a supposed Roman camp, communicating with 
Middlebie and Netherbie. I am now convinced it is of Saxon 
origin, and that the true Roman camp of Overbie is on the farm

ot Raeburnfoot, about a mile above the church. It is situated on 
the tongue of land between the houses of Raeburnfoot and the 
Esk, inchning- gently towards the east, and about forty feet above 
the level of the river. I stumbled upon it accidentally in sum- 
mer 1810, and am inclined to believe, that I have been fortunate 
enough to discover the true Roman station in the head of Esk- 
dale. The plan and description, as taken from actual measure- 
ment at the time, are as follows. 

The most natural approach to the camp is on the south after 
crossing the Esk at Raeburnfoot, where the length of the outer 
line, consisting of a ditch and rampart, is as follows : — From the 
south-west corner, to the entrance into the camp the extent is 
120 feet; the entrance is 20 feet; and from the entrance to the 
south-east corner, 230 feet, — making in all 370 feet. On one 
side, the ditch is 5 feet deep at an average, and about 20 feet 
wide ; and the rampart on the inside of the ditch is formed of the 
earth that was taken from the ditch. The ditch on the east side 
has now filled up ; but the rampart is perfectly distinct, and mea- 
sures thus : — From the south-east corner to the entrance into the 
camp on that side is 240 feet; the entrance itself is 20 feet; and 
from the entrance to the north-east corner is 330 feet ; making 590 
feet in all. On the north side, the ditch is both deeper and wider 
than we found it to be on the south side ; for, in place of being 5 feet 
deep, and 20 feet wide, it is 12 feet deep, and 30 feet wide, to de- 
fend the camp the more effectually from any attack from the hill, 
which on this side begins to rise above the camp. It is for the same 
reason that the line on this side is longer than the line on that side ; 
for, in place of being 370 feet, it is 440, and divided thus : — From 
the north-east corner to the entrance, is a space of 270 feet; the 
entrance itself is 20 feet ; and from the entrance to the north-west 
corner is 150 feet. The ditch and rampart on the west side are evi- 
dently worn away by the river ; for there is a steep bank on that side, 
and the form of the camp is evidently incomplete. Happily, however, 
for the antiquary, the spirit of the stream seems to have repented 
of his intrusion, and has now retired to a considerable distance. The 
length, therefore, and subdivisions on that side are as follows : — 
From the north-west corner to the outer ditch of the prsetorium 
is a space of 110 feet. The outer ditch is 10 feet wide, and about 
3 feet deep. There is a rampart between the outer and inner 
ditch of 10 feet wide at the base, and about 3 feet high. The

and outer ditch is 10 feet at the base, and about 3 feet higk The 
outer ditch on the south side of the prtorium is 10 fee wide, and 
3 feet deep; and the space between the outer ditch of the preeto- 
rium and the south-west corner of the camp is 140 feet; making 
the whole length on the west side to be 580 feet. 

Such, then, are the outward hmits of the Roman camp at Rae- 
burnfoot; but they include a considerable space, as the praetorium, 
which deserves next to be described. It is bounded, on the south 
side, by two ditches, and a rampart between them. From the 
south-west corner to the entrance, is a space of 120 feet; the en- 
trance itself is 20 feet, and parallel to the outer entrance on that 
side; and the space from the entrance to the south-east corner is 
100 feet, making the south side of the praetorium 240 feet in all. 
There is no appearance of ditches or ramparts on the east side. The 
north side of the prsetorium has the same number of ditches and 
ramparts as the south side, and is of the same dimensions,— only 
the division of the line is different. For from the north-east cor- 
ner to the entrance is not 100 feet, as on the south side but 110 
feet ; the entrance is 20 feet wide like the rest, and parallel with 
the outer entrance on that side; and the distance from the entrance 
to the north-west corner is not 120 feet, as on the south side, but 

150, to make it correspond with the outer ditch on that side. The 

whole length of the prsetorium, therefore, on the north side, is 
280 feet. From this account it is evident that the southern en- 
trances into the camp and prsetorium are parallel, and the north- 
ern entrances into the camp and prsetorium are parallel. But they 
are not all opposite to each other, for the southern entrances are 
120 feet distant from the west side of the camp, and the northern 
entrances are 150, — owing, as I formerly observed, to the greater 
length of line on that side, to cut off any chance of danger from 
the hill. 

The area of the whole encampment is supposed to be, in extent, 
5 English acres, 1 rood, and 30 poles. But this is only the extent 
of the area in its present imperfect state. Were the lines on the 
west side of the entrances extended as far as those on the east side, 
so as to make it a square, it would contain 6 English acres, 3 roods, 
and 24 poles.

The above camp remained from 1810, when it was first disco- 
vered, till a few years ago, just as I have described it, and was vi- 
sited by many ; but I regret to add that it is' now much injured by 
the proprietor's having allowed it to be ploughed up, in order to 
obtain a few crops previous to its being laid down in pasture. Had 
he planted it, it might have been equally productive, and the ve- 
nerable relict of Roman residence kept sacred. 

There are two circles of stones on the farm of Coatt, in the 
form of Druidical temples, the one entire, measuring about 90 feet 
in circumference, the other having a part worn away by the water, 
measuring about 340 feet.-f- 

In my former Account of the parish, having mentioned the tra- 
dition of a fair said to have been held at the meeting of the White 
and Black Esks at the foot of the parish, where the singular 
custom of hand-fasting was observed,| and having then endea- 
voured to account for the origin of that custom, I shall here trans- 
cribe another extract from Mr Maxwell's letter to me, before re- 
ferred to, as illustrative of the subject. " No account can be 
given of the period at which the custom of hand-fasting com- 

♦ The following extract of a letter from the late John MaxweD, Esq. of Broom- 
holm, dated 15th April 1796, merits preservation. It was written when Castle O'er 
was supposed to be the true Overbie of the Romans, but is equally applicable to the 
camp at Raeburnfoot. " It is a fact suflBciently established, that Netherbie was a 
Roman town, and a principal station, and likewise that the work at Burrance in the 
parish of Middlebie was a considerable Roman station, and it has always been believed 
that Overbie or Castle O'er was a third j these three standing at the points of a great 
triangle. Roads of communication made after the Roman manner have been com- 
pletely traced between Netherbie and Middlebie, and between Netherbie and Overbie. 
And not only the vestiges of the last mentioned line of road, but, in many places, parts 
of the road may stiU be seen entire, and several Roman coins have been found scat- 
tered along tlie line, particularly a gold coin which I have seen in the possession of the 
deceased Matthew Little, merchant in Langholm, which was found in the small holm, 
on the south-east of Wauchope bridge, through which the road passed. It was a de- 
narius aurius and an Otho, a very scarce coin. I myself found six of these denarii aurii 
upon the farm of Broomholm, through which the road passes and shews itself in a very 
perfect state. Three of them were Neros, two Vespasians, and one Domitian, all in 
perfect reservation. They are now in possession of Lady Douglas of Douglas. As 
the road where these were found goes up the Esk to Overbie, I am still strongly in- 
clined to think Overbie a Roman station, notwithstanding its oval form." The au- 
thor of this report, long after receiving the above letter, saw another denarius aurius in 
the possession of the late Mr John Russell, minister of Canobie, which had been turn- 
ed up by the plough on tlie glebe. It was in perfect preservation, and is, he believes, 
in the possession of Mr Russell's daugliter, Mrs Wigham.

X The custom is thus described in the former Statistical Account : " At that fair, 
it was the custom for unmarried persons of both sexes to choose a companion accord- 
ing to their liking, with whom Ihey were to live till that time next year. This was 
called hand-fasting, or hand in fist. If they were pleased with each other at that 
time, then they continued together for life ; if not, they separated, and were free to 
make another choice, as at the first."

menced, but I was told by an old man, John Murray, who died 
at the farm of Irving, as you go from Langholm to Canobie, and 
had formerly been a proprietor in Eskdalemuir, that he was acquamt- 
ed with or at least had seen an old man, I think his name was Beat- 
tie, who was grandson to a couple of people who had been hand- 
fasted. You perhaps know that the children born under the hand- 
fasting eno-agement were reckoned lawful children, and not bas- 
tards, though the parents did afterwards resile. This custom of 
hand-fasting does not seem to have been peculiar to your parish, 
for there are instances of its having prevailed elsewhere. Men- 
tion is made in some histories of Scotland that Robert 11. was 
hand-fasted to Elizabeth More before he married Euphemia Ross, 
daughter of Hugh, Earl of that name, by both of whom he had 
children ; and his eldest son, John, by Elizabeth More, viz. King 
Robert III., commonly called Jock Ferngyear, succeeded to the 
throne in preference to the sons of Euphemia, his married wife. 
Indeed, after Euphemia's death, he married his former hand-fast- 
ed wife Elizabeth."

There is no village in the parish,— no nobility nor families of in- 
dependent fortune residing in it. The whole ten proprietoi for- 
merly mentioned have, each, land to the yearly value of L. 50 and 

upwards. • i i i v 

Poaching in game, for these last two years particularly, has been 
unusually common. Strangers come in groups of two and three, 
and sometimes in triple that number; go every where openly, but 
chiefly upon the Duke of Buccleuch's grounds, where the grouse and 
black game are most plentiful, and send them off in large quanti- 
ties. Having regular licenses, they know they can only be prose- 
cuted for trespass, and the penalty for that offence they can easily 
pay. The demoralizing influence of such conduct need not be 
dwelt upon. To do them justice, they are careful not to disturb 
the sheep. But were proprietors, in place of preserving the game 
on their estates to the exclusion almost of every one, to grant li- 
berty to several of the farmers in the parishes where their estates 
happen to he, these would become guardians of the game, and 
would feel more interested than at present in its preservation. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Economy/.— The number of English acres 
either cultivated occasionally or in tillage is 482, and the number 
remaining constantly in pasture 41,768. Very little wood is to 
be seen. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of land per Enghsh acre may 
be 1 5s. The sum for grazing a cow in summer, L. 3. Hay for 
a cow in winter is commonly obtained by making it either in the 
bogs of the farmer under whom the cottar lives, or some neigh- 
bouring farmer for the third part, — so that to obtain ten summer 
ricks for himself, he must make twenty for the farmer. 

Breeds of Live-Stock, Sc. — All the sheep in the parish, except 
two hirsels, are of the Cheviot breed ; the two hirsels alluded to 
are the black-faced or Linton breed. On several of the farms there 
is a proportion of west Highland cattle, bought either at Falkirk 
or Dumfries in the autumn. These are wintered either at large on 
grass with hay, during a storm, or in an inclosure on hay, and sold 
next summer. Some farmers allow them to continue at large on 
the farm, even in summer, considering that they can do no harm 
to the sheep provided they be disposed of before Lammas ; this 
parish, from its soil and situation, having generally abundance of 
pasture till that time. But to keep them later is considered inju- 
rious to the sheep.

DUMFRIES-SIIIIIE. 



The common length of leases on sheep farms containing a 
portion of arable land, which is the description of farms in this 
parish, is nine years : but this is too short ; for there is not suffi- 
cient time for making any great improvement, and these, if made, 
are scarcely finished, and the farmer has hardly begun, to en- 
joy the fruits of them, when, by their being brought again in- 
to the market, they become a temptation to a new bidder. On 
the Duke's farms, this is indeed corrected; for there, there is no 
exposure to public roup, nor private offers made. A certain per 
centage, in proportion to the sales of the former lease, is either 
added to or taken from it, as the rent of the lease ensuing : this is 
oflFered for the acceptance of the tenant, and if he has a son to 
succeed him, behaves well, and can pay his rent, he is never re- 
moved. In this way, let the leases be of what length they may, im- 
provements are constantly carrying on: farms become a kind of 
liferent property to the possessors, who improve them for their 
children's children, and yet it is understood that the Duke's farms 
are not, on the whole, cheaper than others. But the security of 
the system is all the charm. In the building of houses, the Duke 
gives wood, slate, and lime ; but the carriage of these from the 
places where they are usually sold, and all the other expenses of 
building and finishing, are the work of the tenant. On farms 
differently constituted, every permanent improvement ought to be 
made by the landlord. In general, the farm buildings on the 
Duke's estates in Eskdale are commodious and in good repair ; 
and I add with pleasure, that the paternal interest which the fami- 
ly of Buccleuch has ever taken in the welfare of its tenantry, is 
gratefully felt by the latter, and has a powerful effect on their ge- 
neral character. Few are more honourable in their dealinofs or 
better informed. 

Draining. — The most general improvement on sheep farms here 
is surface draining. The drains are generally made from 16 inches 
to 2 feet wide, and 1 foot deep at an average. The pense of mak- 
ing them is from 6s. to 7s. 6d. per 100 roods of 18 feet each ; and 
when the soil, after some years, has become compressed, and the 
sides of the drains have begun to meet, they are commonly widened 
and cleaned out for from 4s. to 5s. per 100 roods. A considerable 
degree of skill is requisite in laying them on. If they run too slow, 
they cannot clear themselves of flying bent and other impurities; 
and if too rapid, they run into gullies. The best rate of motion 
is a medium between these two. Experience has taught that they

should be of considerable leng'th, to collect a sufficient quantity 
of water for keeping them clear ; and, where the ground will allow 
it, they are commonly made to run up the water rather than down ; 
that is to say, when draining the wet side of a hill, facing the east, 
for instance, with a burn running south at the bottom, — in place of 
beginning the drains at the north end, in a parallel direction from 
north to south, as the burn runs, — it is better to begin them at the 
south end of the hill, and make them run north into some ravine 
or syke on that side, communicating with the burn. You can thus 
make the draining more level, by having gained the difference of 
level on the north end, above that on the south. The advantages 
of these drains, on sheep farms containing much bog, are incalcu- 
lable. The grounds which retained the wet after rain, or were 
locked up by every frost, by having their surface moisture quickly 
carried off, afford a dry bed for the sheep, and better grasses for their 
support, and have banished that most destructive of all diseases, 
the rot. In this parish, there are on some of the farms between 
30,000 and 40,000 roods of these drains ; and in the whole parish, 
there are nearly 400,000 roods of drains. 

Embanking. — But, besides surface drains on hill lands, the 
straighting and embanking of the Black and White Esks, with se- 
veral of their tributary streams, have been of material advantage. 
There is a long embankment of the Black Esk on the farm of Kil- 
burn, and one of shorter dimensions, of the Garwald water, below 
Thickside ; but the principal one is that of the White Esk on the 
farms of Nether Cassock, Davington, and Burncleugh, extending 
to nearly two miles, and done at great expense. By it, an exten- 
sive holm or haugh, of more than 100 acres, which, in many places, 

was a sour swamp and much overflowed every flood by the river, 

has been dried and rendered productive both for crops and hay. 

Mole-catching. — Mole-catching, which, in my former Account, 
was merely mentioned as a thing proposed, was in the summer of 
1797 carried into effect, on the whole of the Duke of Buc- 
cleuch's farms in the south country. Messrs Fleming and Thom- 
son from Lancashire undertook to catch, for fourteen years from 
that date, on the following conditions: P'or every 100 acres of 
arable land, 10s. annually for each of the first three years ; and 
5s. annually for each of the remaining eleven ; and for every 100 
acres of sheep pasture, 8s. 4d. annually for each of the first three 
years, and 4s. 2d. for each of the remaining eleven. The. plan is 
continued still, but at a lower rate ; for, the first fourteen years re-

quired four times the number of hands that are needed now. As 
everything on the Duke's estate is done systematically, the pro- 
portion due by each farmer is paid at the rent day to the cham- 
berlain, after deducting the board of the mole-catcher, and handed 
over to Mr Fleming, who regularly attends. Several other pro- 
prietors and tenants have agreed with Mr Fleming, at the Duke's 
rates. One advantage is obvious to the most superficial observer. 
Before the moles were caught, their usual run was along the back 
of the drains, where the ground was driest, and often into the drains, 
— the consequence of which was, that every flood sending out water 
through these holes spread the mole hills over the ground beneath, 
causing that rich soft grass to arise, which, in spring, might do no 
injury, but was dangerous in autumn for the introduction of rot. 

In 1798, His Grace Henry of Buccleuch knowing the advan- 
tages of flat flooding on meadows, and catch-work, as it is techni- 
cally called, on sloping grounds in several of the counties in Eng- 
land, — engaged Mr Stephens to assist any of his farmers who were 
so inclined, in laying down land regularly for water meadow. A 
considerable number profited by his Grace's off"er ; and the whole 
of the meadows so operated on have been accurately reported by 
Dr Singer, at the request of the Highland Society, and the re- 
port published by them in the third volume of their Transactions. 
There was no water meadow in this parish, except two acres of 
catch-work on the glebe ; which, although supplied by a mountain 
rivulet of very inferior quahty, were visibly enriched, — the poor 
barren soil being converted into rich black mould. In general, 
the objections against the system were,— the small quantity of 
ground that could be spared from the sheep or the plough,— the 
abundance of hay either from meadow or bog,— and the poverty of 
the water when compared with that which passes through the rich 
manufacturing districts of England. The hay, too, was thought 
good for cattle but not for horses ; and of fodder for the latter they 
stood most in need. 

Till the beginning of the present century, it was the practice of 
farmers, during snow storms of any great continuance, to fly with 
their sheep to Annandale. To those living under diff'erent cir- 
cumstances, it is scarcely possible to conceive the extent to which 
this was carried. I select one instance of many from a memoran- 
dum taken at the time. " On the 15th January 1802, the thaw 
came which relieved so many thousands of sheep. For a great 
number of years, such a general flying for pasture had not been ex- 



ESKDALEMUIR. 



411 



perienced, although lesser ones have been far from unfrequent. 
Every part of Nithsdale, Annandale, and the lower part of Esk- 
dale, that could take in sheep was filled with them from Crawfurd- 
muir, Tweedsmuir, Ettrick, and Yarrow, the head of Tiviotdale, 
Ewes, and Eskdalemuir ; and had the frost continued eight days 
longer, there is no saying what the farmers would have done. Nor 
was all this owing to the great depth of snow, for it was by no 
means considerable. The whole of the evil was occasioned by 
the snow falling wet, or becoming so, and then freezing, which lock- 
ed up the pastures from the sheep. The common rate per score, 
for twenty-four hours, even for this imperfect kind of support, was 
from lOd. to Is. 6d." No such thing as jiying in this parish is 
now ever thought of, — the pastures in Annandale, to which they 
usually fled, having in many places been subdivided and enclosed. 
Hay parks were begun at home. The dung which lay useless 
formerly, was employed to enrich them. This gave a considerable 
quantity of led hay for the sheep ; and in addition to this, it was 
found that the better kind of bog hay when well got, could subsist 
sheep very well, till the thaw came. In place, therefore, of their 
being hungered before they went to Annandale, half starved while 
there, and half-drowned in the burns on their way home when the 
thaw came, they continue at home, thrive better, and much money 
is saved to the farmer. 

An additional fund of support for young cattle and sheep has 
lately been introduced into this parish from Liddesdale by Mr 
James ElHot, tenant of Yetbyre,— in mowing the flying bent and 
converting it into hay. Before he began the practice, it was al- 
lowed to wither, to be carried about by the winds, and stop the cur- 
rent of the drains. But since that time, several have followed his 
example, and found their account in it. It is not so nutritive as 
bog hay, but if cut early when full of sap, it is far from being des- 
picable ;— and what adds to its value is, that it is found on farms 
where bog hay is not abundant.

Means of Communication.— Onv roads are not turnpike, but 
made and kept in repair by an yearly assessment, laid on by those 
heritors of the parish who are Commissioners of Supply, always be- 
fore the 30th April; on which day the Commissioners of Supply for 
the county meet at Dumfries, to receive and sanction the assess- 
ment of the county. The rate is paid one-half by the heritors, and 
one-half by the tenants. There are about twenty-one miles of this

description of road in the pcarish. We have a bridge of two arches 
over the White Esk, near the kirk, and a bridge of one arch over 
the Black Esk. On the road to Lockerbie, Lochmaben, Dumfries, 
and Moffat, a third is to be erected over the Black Esk, immedi- 
ately above its jimction with the White Esk. This will open a 
communication with the lime-works in the parish of Middlebie, and 
be of great use to this parish. Should the hne surveyed lately by 
Mr Welsh, under the superintendance of Mr Telford, of a coach- 
road from Carlisle by Gariston Bridge, Middlebie, Eskdalemuir, 
Ettrick, Yarrow, Innerleithen, and Middleton to Edinburgh, be 
carried into eflfect, it will be shorter than the present road by Lang- 
holm, Hawick, Selkirk, &amp;c. by about twelve miles. It is in ge- 
neral level, and has throughout a southern exposure, which is of 
consequence, in times of snow. 

The ring fences around the enclosed lands of farms are com- 
monly of stone; the subdivisions, of thorn; and the march dikes be- 
tween farms, always of stone. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church is nearly in the centre 
of the parish, on the banks of the White Esk. It was built in 
1826, and is not only commodious but elegant. It is seated for 
the accommodation of 393 persons, allowing 18 inches to each 
sitter. The manse was built in 1783, and has not only been se- 
veral times repaired, but considerably enlarged. The extent of 
the glebe is 24 English acres, including manse, offices, and gar- 
den ; the latter of which, when the present incumbent entered, was 
quite open to the sheep and cattle of the neighbouring farmer. 
It is now surrounded and subdivided, partly with stone and partly 
with hedge-rows ; and a number of trees have been planted round 
the manse. The stipend is 15 chalders, half meal half barley, 
with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. 

There is in the parish no Dissenting place of worship, properly so 
called. The only Dissenters are Cameronians, 17 in number, who 
are occasionally visited by preachers ; and annually, or every two 
years, have the sacrament dispensed to them at Upper Dumfedling, 
when all those of the same denomination from neighbouring parishes 
usually attend. They are a moral and religious people, with whom 
I have always lived on the most friendly habits. Although staunch 
to their principles, their children generally attend the Established 
church. 

The distance from the parish church is great to many ; but 
it is in general well attended. In good weather, they come to 



ESKDALEMUIR. 



413 



church from a distance of four, five, or six miles. The average 
number of communicants for the last ten years is 159. 

Societies.— The only society for religious purposes in the parish, 
is the Eskdalemuir Bible and Missionary Association. It has exist- 
ed sixteen years, and in that time subscriptions and collections at 
the annual sermon have been made to the amount of L. 294, 7s. lOd., 
or L. 18, 7s. lOd. yearly. The contributions were sent to the Bri- 
tish and Foreign Bible Society, till 1823, when the contributors, 
being dissatisfied with their conduct respecting the Apocrypha, and 
in employing infidel agents, resolved to send them to the Edin- 
burgh Bible and Scottish Missionary Societies. 

Education.— There are two schools in the parish,— the parochial 
and a private one. The parochial schoolmaster's salary is the 
maximum, L. 34, 4s. 5d., and the school fees and Candlemas pre- 
sent about L. 10. Besides the ordinary branches, Latin, Greek, 
and French are taught. It is but justice to say, that the merits 
of a teacher far exceed his emoluments. He has even more than 
the legal accommodation, as to house and garden. The private 
school is entirely supported by school wages ; and the teacher goes 
from house to house with his scholars. In general, the parents 
are anxious to have their children educated; but the distance 
from the school not unfrequently induces several families to unite 
in hiring a teacher for the winter half year, — dividing the salary 
according to the number of scholars ; and it is pleasing for me to 
remark, that, at the usual diets for parochial examination, which 
are uncommonly well attended, there appears no deficiency as to 
reading, and an acquaintance with the principles of religion, — the 
parents making up by private tuition what they cannot procure by 
public instruction. I state this from accurate knowledge ; for, at 
each diet, the children bring their Bibles to read a portion, on 
which they are examined after Gall's method, repeat their cate- 
chisms, psalms, and paraphrases, commonly with great accuracy ; 
and at two diets held where the schools are situated, after the 
older people have been examined, the teachers go through the dif- 
ferent English branches taught in their schools in the hearing of 
the parents. 

Libraries. — Till lately, those fond of reading were subscribers to 
the Westerkirk parish library. But we have now one of our own 
which is increasing fast, and the terms of admission are very mo- 
derate. 

Poor. — The number of persons at present on the poors' list is 



414 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



15. They are supported by quarterly assessments, increased or 
diminished according to the state of the rase; and these assessments 
are paid, one-half by the heritors, and one-half by the tenants. The 
assessment at present is L. 25 per quarter ; but this is unusually 
large, in order to meet some extraordinary cases. The average sum 
collected for poor's rates annually, during the last ten years, is L. 64, 
3s. OJ-d. and the average number of paupers on the list during that 
time has been 12. The evil effects of assessments are apparent in 
this parish as elsewhere. The collections at the church for the last ten 
years amounted to L. 204, 2s. 7|d. or L. 20, 8s. 3d. yearly. They 
are commonly appropriated to the following uses : to pay the sala- 
ries of the ordinary office-bearers, to educate the poor scholars, to 
aid the Dumfries and Galloway Infirmary, and thereby give us the 
power of sending patients to that useful institution ; and to give tem- 
porary aid to poor people, either to keep them from the poors 
rates, or support them till the first quarterly meeting. The ses- 
sion, besides these collections, has L. 80 of mortified money and 
accumulated collections, the interest of which goes, by agreement, 
in aid of the poor rates, and is accepted by the committee in lieu 
of the half of the session funds to which by law they are entitled. 
Mrs Wilham Curll, formerly a residenter in this parish, but latter- 
ly in Kelso, left to the care of the Eskdalemuir session L. 25, — 
the interest of which is to go to aged persons not on the poors' 
lists; and Mrs Moffat, late at Garwald, left L.20 to the session, the 
interest to be employed in buying school Bibles for poor scholars. 
This last is a most useful legacy. 

Fuel. — The usual fuel is peat, of which there is fortunately great 
abundance ; so that, in dry years, a sufficient store can be laid up ; 
but in wet seasons, our situation is uncomfortable. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The great storm in 1794 should not pass unnoticed, in a work of 
this kind. It happened the year after I wrote my former Account, and 
from a memorandum taken at the time, I am enabled to describe it 
with accuracy. " During the harvest of 1793 the weather was good, 
and never was there a milder and more favourable winter for stocks 
than this was, till the fatal 25th January 1794. That storm was the 
most dreadful ever known in this place. The snow began to fall 
in the evening of Thursday the 23d, and covered the ground to 
the depth of about four inches. Friday the 24th, the forenoon 
was pretty good, and in the evening it began to rain ; and there 
was every appearance of thaw, the wind being south-west. The 



ESKDALEMUIll. 



415 



shepherds, therefore, stelled their sheep, in that expectation, — 
shelterino- them from the south-west wind. The rain became al- 
ways heavier, till betwixt one and two o'clock in the morning of Sa- 
tm-day the 25th. This filled the sykes with melted snow. At four 
o'clock, the air was perfectly calm, and the sky starry. But in half 
an hour, the wind changed to the north-north-east, and then the 
snow and drift began ; it freezing at the same time very hard, when 
the drift became very great, which it did about five o'clock ; it drove 
the sheep into the sykes, and the intensity of the frost confined them 
there till they were drowned. Those which escaped the sykes 
were driven into hollow places and covered with snow. Many were 
struck dead on the dry ground, and found afterwards lying on their 
backs. The drift was excessive till about eight o'clock, when it slack- 
ed a little, and continued so till three in the afternoon, when it be- 
came as dreadful as ever, and continued till past midnight. Next 
morning, Sabbath the 26th, was perfectly calm and clear, and the 
whole day pleasant, but very frosty. It was painful to see cart loads 
of half-dead sheep carrying to the farm-houses to be taken care of. 
This kind of frosty weather continued till Wednesday 29th, when 
a heavy fall of snow began about one o'clock, and continued till late. 
Thursday 30th, was clear. On Friday 31st at mid-day a thaw came, 
and in twenty-four hours almost all the snow disappeared. Every 
shepherd in the parish was in jeopardy on the 25th, but fortunate- 
ly no lives were lost. The total number of sheep destroyed in 
Eskdalemuir on the 25th January was 4006, and 7 black cattle. 
This was the loss as taken immediately after the storm ; but there 
is every reason to think that it was considerably greater, as many 
went down the burns when the thaw came."

of the story of Gilpin Horner, which occupies a prominent part in Sir Walter Scott's 
Lay of the Last Minstrel.

PRESBYTERY OF LANGHOLM, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. WILLIAM B. SHAW  MINISTER.  



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — Langholm no doubt derives its name from the holm 
or flat land which stretches along the banks of the river Esk upon 
which it is situated. It may be observed that, generally, the farms 
on both sides of the river take the name of holm, — such as Broom- 
holm, Murtholm, Stubholm, Meikleholm, Millholm, and Potholm. 

Extent and Boundaries. — This parish extends 1 1 miles in length, 
and 6 in breadth, and contains 41 square miles. It is bounded on the 
north by Westerkirk and Ewes ; on the east by Ewes and Canobie ; 
on the south by Canobie ; and on the west by Middlebie and Tun- 
dergarth. Exclusive of Half- Morton, the parish contains near- 
ly 14,320 acres, 12,800 of which belong to his Grace the Duke of 
Buccleuch ; 1500 to George Maxwell, of Brbomholm, Esq.; and 
the remainder to Mr Matthew Little of Arkinholm, proprietor of 
half of one of the ten merk lands of Langholm. 

Soil. — The soil varies very much, as the greater part of the pa- 
rish is hilly and pastoral. The hills are smooth and verdant to the 
very summits, — affording a bountiful supply of food to the nume- 
rous flocks of sheep which graze upon them. The ground along 
the banks of the rivers Esk and Ewes is flat, and consists of light 
loam, and in some places rather inclines to be gravelly. These 
grounds are highly cultivated, and well sheltered by woods, belts of 
planting and thriving hedge-rows, and are capable of producing ex- 
cellent crops of every description. On the south and west side of 
the town, there are a few orchards which, in favourable seasons, are 
very productive. 

Meteorology. — The annual mean temperature of the atmosphere, 
according to Fahrenheit's thermometer, may be stated about 44j2. 
In the whole range of Eskdale, it has been accurately ascertained, 
that more rain falls by a third than either at Hawick or Selkirk.

This has been attributed to the communication with the Atlantic 
by the Solway Frith, from which, as being a much larger body of 
water than the German sea, there naturally arises a much greater 
deo-ree of exhalation,— which the attraction of the surrounding hills 
more readily condenses and discharges in rain. The most prevail- 
ing winds and heaviest falls of rain are from the south-west, which 
is exposed to the Solway Frith. Snow lies only for a short period 

in the low lands. 

Hydrography— In the western division, called Wauchopedale, 
there are three medicinal springs, one sulphureous, and two chaly- 
beate. Unfortunately, no analysis has been made of any of these 
springs. Persons afflicted with scrofula and eruptions of the skin 
are said to derive great benefit from drinking the waters of the sul- 
phureous spring. 

The river Esk, which gives name to this pastoral district, rises 
in the high country of Esk water, and has its course among moun- 
tains to Broomholm, and passes through the parish of Langholm 
in a south direction. It is joined by the streams of Black Esk, 
Megget, Ewes, and Wauchope. Its length is 30 miles in the coun- 
ty of Dumfries, and 38 to the Solway Frith, into which it flows. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — Greenstone occurs in beds of grey- 
wacke and greywacke slate, according to Professor Jameson, in the 
whole extensive range from Langholm to Wamphray, in the upper 
district of Annandale. Floetz-trap extends from the bridge of Lang- 
holm to Denbie, in the parish of Dalton. In the upper part of 
the county, between Wamphray and Langholm, it is found on the 
summit of transition mountains, and generally in the shape of moun- 
tain caps. Greywacke slate is worked in the vicinity of Langholm, 
and in the high parts of the valley of the Esk. 

Lead ore has been found on the farm of Westwater, the pro- 
perty of the Duke of Buccleuch, and also on the estate of Broom- 
holm, belonging to George Maxwell, Esq. This vein consists of a 
considerable quantity of heavy spar, which often attends metallic- 
veins. It stretches across the Esk into the Duke's lands from 
north-west, in a south-east direction. At Langholm low bridge 
are several small spar veins running in the transition rock. Some- 
time ago, a trial was made for lead there, and some of that ore 
was found blended in the spar; and a quarter of a mile below 
this, the primitive and secondary strata join. At Langholm 
bridge, the coal formation begins, and continues through the whole 
of the lower part of the district to the Solway Frith. Between 



418 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



Langholm bridge and Byreburn, the sandstone is of a grayish white 
and yellowish gray colour, and contains many vegetable moulds. 
The limestone, which lies upon the transition rocks and below the 
coal formation, is bluish gray, and contains petrifactions. The 
slate-clay is grayish black, and contains beds of globular clay iron- 
stone. Below Byreburn, the brownish red-coloured sandstone 
continues without any alternation to the Solway Frith. Amygda- 
loid is also found. 

Zoology. — Among the more rare birds, it may be noticed that 
the bittern {Ardea stellaris, the butcher-bird {Lanius collurio, 
and the king-fisher {Alcedo ispida, have been seen in this parish. 
All the species of our singing birds are to be met with. 

Of Destructive Insects. — The most common are the Aphis hras- 
sicce, or cabbage plant-louse, which commences its ravages about 
the end of May, and the Aphis pomi, the apple-leaf plant-louse, 
which is found on the young leaves and shoots of apple trees, from 
the lime they bud till the middle of June. The bean plant-louse, 
the Aphis fahcB, is in some seasons very hurtful to the bean crop. 
It is found on the tops of all the varieties of beans. The glow- 
worm [Lampyris splendidula is common in this parish, and is ge- 
nerally seen at the roots of hedges and on road sides. 

Botany. — There are no rare plants in this parish; but all the 
common kinds are found. There is a species of willow known by 
the name of the gray saugh, which grows to a great size, and is 
much sought after by cabinetmakers, on account of its beautiful 
red colour, and the pohsh it takes when applied for making house- 
hold furniture. Much valuable wood is in this parish, — such as 
large oaks, ash, beech, plane tree, and forest trees of every kind. 

II. — Civil History. 
Historical Notices. — Langholm was erected into a burgh of ba- 
rony in the year 1610, and designed in the charter Arkinholm. 
The grant was given by the head of the Nithsdale family Douglas, 
who at the time was Lord of the Regality of Eskdale. The same 
lord, in 1622, granted a new charter of erection to ten cadets of 
the family, upon condition that each of them should build a house 
in the town, — in which charter, for the first time, it is designed 
Langholm ; and along with the houses, four of which were only 
built, he granted to each of them a merk land. Five and a half 
of these merk lands are still in the possession of Mr Maxwell of 
Broomholm. 

The town of Langholm is built in the bosom of a beautiful wood- 



LANGHOLM. 



419 



land scene on the banks of the Esk, along the Edinburgh and Car- 
lisle road, and consists of one principal street, which contains some 
excellent houses, roofed with blue slate got in the neighbourhood. 
At the market-place stand the Town-Hall and Jail, ornament- 
ed with a spire and clock. These buildings were erected on an 
elegant plan in 1811. The village of New Langholm, half a-mile 
from the town, is dehghtfully situated on the opposite side of the 
river, at the confluence of the Esk and Wauchope, and connected 
with the former by a stone bridge of three arches. This village 
consists of about 140 houses built upon a regular plan, of a trian- 
gular form, on feus held from the Duke of Buccleuch, and was 
begun in the year 1778. If the house consists of one story, the 
feuar gets two acres of land ; if of two stories, four acres, at a rent 
varying according to the quality of the soil and situation, from 3s. 
to 14s. per acre on leases of fourteen years. They have also a 
cow pastured on a common at 18s. per annum, solely appropriated 
for this purpose. The Duke of Buccleuch is superior, and no- 
minates the Baron Bailie. 

Eminent Men. — Among the eminent men born in this parish, 
we may mention the following : Mr Maxwell, the ingenious author 
of an Essay upon Tune; John Pasley, Esq. an enterprising and suc- 
cessful London merchant; Admiral Sir Thomas Pasley, his brother, 
who distinguished himself under Earl Howe, in the defeat of the 
French fleet, on the 1st of June 1794; William Julius Meikle, the 
translator of Camoens' Lusiad; Colonels Matthew Murray and 
John Little, who distinguished themselves under the Marquis 
Cornwallis, in the wars against Tippoo Saib ; Captain George 
Maxwell, R. N. who signalized himself in an engagement with the 
Dutch, off" the Dogger- Bank in 1781 ; Ralph Irvine, M. D. who 
died in India, 1795, a young man of great promise in his profes- 
sion ; Colonel C. Pasley of the Royal Engineers, well known for 
his attainments in literature and science, who has now withdrawn 
from the active duties of life, and is enjoying his well-earned fame 
among the scenes of his infancy ; and David Irvine, LL. D. au- 
thor of the Life of George Buchanan, &amp;c. and librarian to the Fa- 
culty of Advocates. 

Chief Land-owners. — The principal proprietors are. His Grace 
the Duke of Buccleuch ; George Maxwell, Esq. of Broomholm ; 
and Mr Matthew Little of Arkinholm. Sir Patrick Maxwell, 
Bart, of Springkell, is the sole proprietor of Half Morton, with 
exception of two farms. 



420 



DUMFRIES-SHIHE. 



Parochial Registei's. — The earliest register of baptisms commen- 
ces in 1706; of marriages, in 1719; and of deaths, in 1704. From 
which period till the present, the register of baptisms and mar- 
riages has been kept with tolerable accuracy ; but the register of 
deaths is wholly awanting for one year. 

Antiquities. — The Castle of Langholm is merely a square tower 
or border-house, which was formerly the property of the Armstrongs, 
a powerful body of freebooters in this district ; and is now in ruins. 
The Castle of Barntalloch, near Staplegorton, built of stone and 
lime, stood on a rocky precipice above the Esk. Under this fortifica- 
tion, rose a burgh of barony, where an annual fair of great resort was 
held, which, many years ago, was transferred to Langholm. There 
is a tract of ground which contains somewhat more than twenty-six 
Scotch acres that still bear the name of the " Borough roods of 
Staplegorton." At the junction of the Esk and Ewes, a small frag- 
ment of a castle is visible, formerly the property of the Nithsdale 
family. Wauchope Castle, where the old manse stood, was the 
first residence of the Lindsays in Scotland. This family came into 
this country from the manor of Lindsai, in Essex, along with Mal- 
colm Canmore in the beginning of the twelfth century, who con- 
ferred upon them the lands of Wauchopedale. This castle is built 
upon a steep precipice near the river Wauchope, which renders it 
very romantic, — the opposite banks being covered with a variety of 
beautiful trees. In former times, it must have been a place of great 
strength. The fosse and other out-works can readily be traced, 
even at this distance of time. Mr Pennant, in examining the site 
of the old Castle of Broomholm, which was taken down about ninety 
years ago, was of opinion, that the mansion-house of Broomholm 
stands in a situation which was the heart of an old British town, 
answering to Caesar's description, " Oppidum sylvis paludi- 
busque.munitum." — The Roman road of communication between 
the encampments of Netherbie and Castle O'er, or Overbie, 
in Eskdalemuir, can still be traced. This road enters Langholm 
parish at the south-east corner, crosses the Esk a short way above 
Broomholm, and runs north-west till it enters the parish of Wester- 
kirk. 

Coins. — On the farm of Broomholm, about fifty years ago, some 
of Mr Maxwell's servants found six denarii aurei, three of which 
were of Nero, two of Vespasian, and one of Domitian, — all in high 
preservation. A few years later, on the same line of road, one Otho, 
and two denarii aurei, were found near Wauchope bridge. They 



LANGHOLM. 



.421 



are in the possession of the family of the late Mr Little, Baron Bailie 

of Langholm. , . , , 

Witches.— eav the old Castle of Langholm, a place is pointed 
out where several reputed witches were burnt in the last century. 
It is told of the Eskdale witches, some of whom acted as mid- 
wives, that they had the power of transferring the labour of child- 
birth from the mother to the father. 

Branks.— This was an instrument of punishment kept by the 
chief magistrate, for restraining the tongue. The branks was 
in the form of a head-piece, that opens and incloses the head of 
the culprit,— while an iron, sharp as a chisel, enters the mouth and 
subdues the more dreadful weapon within. Dr Plot, the learned 
historian of Staffordshire, has given a minute description and figure 
of this instrument ; and adds, that he looks upon it " as much to 
be preferred to the ducking-stool, which not only endangers the 
health of the party, but also gives the tongue liberty 'twixt every 
dip, to neither of which this is at all hable." When husbands un- 
fortunately happened to have scolding wives, they subjected the 
heads of the offenders to this instrument, and led them through the 
town exposed to the ridicule of the people. 

It may be mentioned, that it was on Langholm Holm, " that 
Johnnie Armstrong of Gilnockie, and his gallant companie of 
thirty-six men, when going to meet King James V., ran their horse 
and brak their spears, when the ladies lookit frae their lofty win- 
dows, — saying, God send our men well back again." At Carlenrig, 
near Moss Paul, on the road betwixt Langholm and Hawick, where 
John and his gallant followers were executed, their graves are point- 
ed out in the sohtary churchyard of that place. 

Modern Buildings. — The principal mansion-houses are, Lang- 
holm Lodge, belonging to His Grace the Duke of Buccleuch, and 
Broomholm House, the residence of George Maxwell, Esq. Both 
of these residences are delightfully situated on the banks of the 
Esk, in the immediate neighbourhood of Langholm. Near to Lang- 
holm Lodge, there is a handsome bridge of 100 feet span, which 
highly improves the prospect, and is an object of great attraction 
to travellers as they enter the town by the north.

Re7it of Land.— In this large parish, where there is so much low 
and high ground, the rent per acre must vary accordingly. The 
land in the immediate neighbourhood of the town lets so high as 
L. 2, 10s. and L. 1, 5s. per acre. No sheep-farmer is much in- 
clined to inform strangers either of the extent of their farms, the 
numbers of their flocks, or the rent they pay. The grazing 'of a 
milk cow for the season costs L. 1, 10s., and the half of that for a 
calf or stirk. A full-grown sheep, 5s. 

Rate of Wages.— The rate of labour for country artisans is as 
follows: In summer, joiner, without victuals, per day. Is. 9d. to 
2s. ; masons, ditto, 2s. to 2s. 6d. ; tailors, with victuals, as it is 
common for them to go to the houses of their employers. Is. 6d.; 
day-labourers, viz. dikers, ditchers, &amp;c. Is. 6d. ; ploughmen, with 
board for the half year, and other full-grown male farm-servants, 
from L.7 toL.8; female servants for agricultural purposes, with 
board, from L. 3, 3s. to L. 4. In harvest, for the space of five weeks, 
a man receives L.2, 5s.; a woman, for the same period, from L.2 



LANGHOLM.

to L. 1, 10s.; females, for hoeing turnips, potatoes, or making hay, 
9d. per day. Shepherds are generally allowed the grazing of fifty 
head of stock, a free house, and a certain quantity of meal, with the 

pasture of a cow. 

Jiental. The valued rent of this parish, exclusive of Half Mor- 
ton, as stated in the county cess-book, is 9321 merks Scots, equal 
to L. 2000 Sterling: Half Morton is valued at 1650 merks, or 
L. 972 Sterling,— making in whole nearly L. 3000 Sterling. 

Live stock. — The common breed of sheep is the Cheviot. This 
breed is found to be well adapted both to the soil and chmate, 
and is very profitable, for the fine quality of the wool. The greatest 
possible attention has been paid to the improvement of this breed, 
and the general mode is by purchasing tups from the Cheviots, and 
from improvers of the stock, at the tup fair of Hawick. It cannot 
be very accurately ascertained how many thousands of sheep are 
pastured in this parish ; but the number may be about 9000. The 
stock of the whole of this district is generally sold at the following 
places, viz. lambs, at St Bothwells, Langholm, and Lockerbie ; 
hogs, at Applebie and Stagshaw ; wedders, at Stagshaw and Ask- 
rigg; and draught ewes, at Brough Hill, Kettlewell, and York. 
The average prices obtained this year for Cheviot stock per head 
were, for wedders, L. 1, Is. 6d., ewes, 17s. 6d. and lambs, 9s. 6d. 

The common ingredients for smearing are tar and butter, with 
sometimes a mixture of palm oil. When tar and butter are used, 
the proportions are one stone of butter 16 English pounds, to a 
gallon of tar 8 Scots pints. By the common rule of smearing, 
a stone of butter to a gallon of tar should smear 30 hogs, and from 
40 to 45 older sheep. The wool of young sheep takes five fleeces 
to the stone of 24 lb. English, and older sheep from six to seven. 
Thus the average of a whole clip may be 6. The wool-dealers 
from Halifax, Huddersfield, and Leeds, are the chief buyers. The 
wool-market is so changeable, that the average of the price per 
stone is not easily fixed. 

The common breed of cattle in Eskdale is the Galloway kind, 
to the rearing of which great attention is paid. In a letter of 
the late Rev. Dr Brown of Eskdalemuir, he says, " the stirks, 
which are a very considerable source of emolument, are generally 
sought after by dealers between Michaelmas and Martinmas, car- 
ried to the Dumfries market, and sold to the Galloway farmers, 
who are fond of them, as being large and fat from our grassy pas- 
tures; so that after they are kept in Galloway for a year, they can 



424 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



be sorted with tliose bred in Galloway that are a year and some- 
times two years older than themselves, and passed off as such in 
Carlisle and other market towns on the English borders. Hence 
the reason, that our stirks are higher priced than many others, and 
the reason why very good ones fetch so high a price." The num- 
bers reared in the parish have not been correctly ascertained. The 
average prices for stock of this kind may be stated as nearly as pos- 
sible as follows : Two year old stots from L. 3 to L. 5 ; three year 
old do. from L. 3 to L. 7, 10s. and L. 8, 10s.; four year old do. 
from L. 6, 6s. to L. 10 and L. 12. Cows vary in price according 
to size, age, and condition, from L. 6 to L. 10. Farm-horses able 
for their work, and from three to six years of age, or even eight, 
can be purchased at present from L. 18 to L. 30; some fine ani- 
mals of the Clydesdale breed brought, at the last Dumfries Rood 
fair, the high prices of L. 35 and L. 40. A very considerable num- 
ber of swine is fed in this parish, which, when cured, find a ready 
market at Newcastle, Longtown, and Carlisle. 

Husbandry. — In the lowlands all the modern improvements in 
agriculture, so far as the soil will admit, have been introduced most 
successfully by the enterprising tenants of the district. On the 
high pastoral grounds, every thing has been done that draining and 
enclosing can effect. 

Leases on the Duke of Buccleuch's farms are generally for the 
space of nine years. Leases of this length are supposed to be 
equally favourable to the landlord and tenant, as affording both the 
same opportunities either of a rise or deduction of rent. The 
number of acres in some of these farms is 4464 ; and the rent 
about L. 670. The state of farm-buildings and enclosures in this 
parish cannot be surpassed, as the Duke affords every facility for 
improvements and for the comfort of his tenantry. 

Manufactures. — About forty-seven years ago, a cotton manufac- 
tory was established in New Langholm, the machinery of which 
contains 3552 mule spindles, with other suitable apparatus. The 
original cost was L. 2600; and it employs at present from 90 to 100 
persons. Woollen yarns, stockings, stuffs, serges, black and white 
plaids, which are worn by both rich and fpoor, are also manufac- 
tured here, but to no great extent. There is a distillery for whis- 
ky on a small scale ; and a brewery. Langholm enjoys great local 
advantages for manufactories, having abundance of coal and peat 
in the neighbourhood, besides a copious supply of water fit to turn 
very powerful machinery.

v.— Parochial Economy. 
Fairs.— A weekly market is held at Langholm for purchasing 
the ordinary necessaries of life; and there are four annual fairs, 
one of which is the greatest in the south of Scotland, for lambs, 
and is held generally on the 26th of July, the other three for hiring 
farm-servants, and the sale of stock which is not required to be 

kept over winter. 

Memis of Communication— In this district, the roads and bridges 
are all kept in the best order. The great road from Edinburgh to 
Carlisle passes through the town of Langholm, affording a ready 
communication from the capitals of both kingdoms, as the mail runs 
by this road daily. There is also an excellent road which leads west 
to Annan. There are two country roads, one of which crosses the 
Esk at Langholm, and leads up into Eskdale north-west, and the 
other south-east by a good bridge over the Tarras into Canobie. 
These roads are kept in repair from the assessment which is le- 
vied in lieu of Statute Labour. Another road is made up Wauch- 
opedale, which opens a ready communication from Langholm to 
Lockerbie, Lochmaben, and Dumfries. A coach now runs upon 
this road, alternately, from Dumfries to Langholm. There was a 
bridge built across the Esk, in 1780, by subscription, consisting of 
three arches ; it connects the old and new towns of Langholm. A 
little farther to the north, there is another bridge of two arches, 
upon the post road, over the Ewes. These bridges stand nearly 
parallel, and are situated within sixty yards of each other. About 
half a-mile south of Langholm, there is another of three arches, — 
besides three others, which claim no particular notice. 

Ecclesiastical State. — Langholm parish comprehends the ancient 
parishes of Staplegorton, Wauchope, and the half of Morton. Wil- 
liam de Cunigburc, who possessed the manor of Staplegorton in 
the twelfth century, granted to the monks of Kelso, the church of 
Staplegorton with all the lands belonging to it. This grant was 
confirmed by William the Lion, and also by Walter, the Bishop of 
Glasgow, in 1232. In the fourteenth century, when the monks of 
Kelso made an estimate of their property, they held the rectory of 
this church, which was valued at L. 13, 6s. 8d. They had also, with- 
in this manor, a carrucate of land at Duglyn, which brought them 
yearly five merks. The monks held this rectory till the Reforma- 
tion, when not only Staplegorton, but several other of the churches 
of the monks of Kelso, were transferred to the Earl of Roxburghe. 
Some time after this, the King bought the advowson and the tithes 

DUMFRIES. E e 



13UMFRIES-SHIRE. 

of this parish from the Earl, and transferred them in 1637 to the 
Bishop of Glasgow. 

Langholm was erected into a parish in the year 1703, and be- 
came the seat of a presbytery in 1743, by disjoining the five pa- 
rishes of Eskdale from Middlebie, and adding to them the parish 
of Castleton, which was formerly in the presbytery of Jedburgh. 
The church was originally built in 1703, and since that time has 
been rebuilt twice, viz. in 1747 and 1779. The present church 
is convenient enough for the greater part of the parish, with the 
exception of Half Morton. It is not, however, in good repair, 
being both damp and uncomfortable. It is situated upon a rising 
ground on the north of the town, which renders it extremely cold 
in winter ; and when frost sets in, it is by no means easy of access 
to the infirm. It may contain about 800 sitters. 

The manse was rebuilt in 1793, and at present is in good re- 
pair. The glebe consists of fifty acres, twenty of which are 
arable. The amount of stipend is 16 chalders, half meal, half 
barley, payable in money, according to the highest fiar prices of 
the county, with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. Two 
augmentations have been gi-anted, since 1792. 

There are two Dissenting meeting-houses in the parish, — one 
belonging to the United Associate Synod, and the other to the 
Relief. The chapel of the United Associate congregation was 
originally built in 1788, and rebuilt in 1822, and may contain about 
500 sitters. The preacher has an allowance of L. 120, and finds 
a house for himself. The Relief meeting-house, a small building, 
was founded in 1807. The congregation allows the preacher L. 80, 
out of which he provides himself with a dwelling-house. The 
number of Dissenters in the parish who attend these meeting-houses 
may amount to 400, but their congregations are considerably en- 
larged from the neighbouring parishes. There are only one Roman 
Catholic, and two Episcopalians in the parish. 

The number of communicants at the last celebration of the 
Lord's Supper in the Established Church amounted to 400. 
There are two Sabbath schools, one of which, taught by the Burgher 
clergyman, with assistants, is attended by more than 300 children ; 
the other is conducted by the Relief clergyman. They are sup- 
ported by collections made in the chapels. 

Education. — There are two endowed schools in this parish, — one 
situated in New Langholm, having the maximum salary, and the 
legal accommodations ; the other at Broomholm, endowed by a 



LANGHOLM 



427 



mortification of L. 600 left by the late Captain Maxwell, for teach- 
ino- twenty poor scholars. There are seven other schools,— four of 
which are taught by females, where children of both sexes are m- 
structed in the elements of reading. In the parochial school, con • 
ducted by Mr Hannah, a most efficient teacher, six of his scholars 
are learning Latin at 6s. per quarter; one Greek at 7s. 6d. do.; 
three, French at 10s. 6d.; Enghsh reading at 2s. 6d. do., with 
writing, 3s. 6d., and with arithmetic, 4s. 6d. ; pure and mixed ma- 
thematics, 7s. 6d. ; book-keeping complete system one guinea. 
The average number of scholars attending the parochial school for 
the last two years is 75 ; the average numbers that attend the whole 
of the others, 200. It is supposed that there are some few who can 
neither read nor write above six years of age, but the number can- 
not be correctly ascertained. The people in general are strongly 
alive to the benefits of education; and if there should chance to be 
a melancholy example of one or two individuals who cannot read 
or write, they must have come into the parish in that state of ig- 
norance from another country. There is no part of the parish so 
distant from some of the schools as to prevent attendance. There 
are no additional schools required. The facilities of education 
have made a wonderful and visible change upon the conduct and 
morals of the people. 

Literature. — There are two proprietary or subscription libraries, 
— one instituted in 1800, commonly called the Langholm Library, 
and the other, first established in 1815, known by the name of the 
Tradesmen's Library, or New Langholm Library. The first of 
these libraries has 36 members, who contribute 10s. annually. 
The late Mr Telford, civil-engineer, a native of the district, left 
the handsone donation of L. 1000 Sterling to the Langholm Li- 
brary. Most of the standard works in English literature, and the 
popular periodicals of the present day, are found in this library. 

Friendly Society. — A friendly society was instituted in Langholm 
in the year 1782. The entry money is 10s., with a quarterly pay- 
ment of Is. Sick members, upon the certificate of a surgeon that 
they are unable to work and confined to bed, receive 4s. 6d. per 
week; if able to walk about, though not able to work, 3s. 6d., per 
week. If their illness continue one year and a-half, they are then 
put upon the superannuated list at 2s. per week for life. When a 
member dies, L.2 are allowed to defray funeral expenses ; and Is. 
from each member is given to the widow or children of the deceas- 
ed. This Society has been of great advantage to the labouring- 
classes. 



428 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



There is also a Farming Society, which meets at Langholm once 
a-month. Each member pays an annual subscription of L. 1, 5s. 
from which a fund is raised for premiums, — which are given at the 
annual competition to the best breeders of stock within the dis- 
trict. — There is a Savings bank in this parish. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of poor, including 
children, who are upon the poors' roll, is 62, — besides a very consi- 
derable number between 30 and 40 who receive occasional relief. 
The sum distributed last year, including all kinds of charity, was 
nearly L. 400 Sterling. Of this sum, L. 8 per annum are allowed 
to some ; to others not more than L. 2. Two fatuous persons re- 
ceive each annually L. 6, 14s. The average, as nearly as possible, 
may be L.4 per annum to each poor person. Poor rates were in- 
stituted in this parish in the year 1773, and the assessment for 
last year was L. 320. The rate is 8d. per pound, or nearly 3 per 
cent. The average weekly collection at the church door amounts to 
15s. The dues of proclamation of marriage are, for three times in 
one day, L. 1, Is.; two days, 8s. 8d. ; and for three days, 5s. 6d. 
Fines for immoral conduct, irregular marriages, &amp;c. all go to the 
poor funds, — except the session clerk's fees for proclamation. About 
L. 90 have at different times been bequeathed to the poor of this 
parish for the education of poor children, and other religious pur- 
poses, which sum the session has placed out at interest upon good 
siecurity. No public begging is allowed in this parish, or even 
within the bounds of the presbytery. It is the general belief, that 
over Scotland the independent spirit of abstaining from seeking 
parochial relief is fast dying away ; but whether it is so in the pa- 
rish of Langholm it would be hazardous to risk an opinion. 

Inns. — In this parish, which contains a population of 2676 souls, 
there are no less than eight respectable inns and twelve inferior 
alehouses, — a number much more than sufficient to supply the 
wants both of travellers and of the inhabitants. No doubt, these 
houses must tend to the deterioration of the morals of the people ; 
still the general character of the people is decidedly sober and re- 
ligious. 

Puel. — Peat is abundantly supplied, from inexhaustible mosses, 
within two miles of the town, at Is. 6d. and 2s. per cart load; and 
coal, from Canobie, is purchased at the pit from 2s. 6d. to 3s. per 
cart load of 24 Carlisle pecks, and is laid down at Langholm from 
4s. 6d. to 5s. the load.

PRESBYTERY OF LANGHOLM, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. JAMES GREEN, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — This parish has been supposed to take its name from 
the manor of Westerker, which, by modern appellation, is now called 
Westerkirk. This name is derived from the British Caer, or fort- 
let, which stood near the hamlet of Westerker, upon the Megget 
water, a little above its confluence with the Esk. In Scoto- Saxon 
times, " this strength" was named Wester Caer or Ker, to distin- 
guish it from the eastern Caer which is still visible on the farm of 
Elfgill. There is another supposition that Westerkirk derived its 
name from being the most westerly of the five kirks of Eskdale. 
The present parish of Eskdalemuir formed part of Westerkirk, till 
1703, when it was erected into a separate parish. 

Boundaries. — The parish is bounded, on the west, by Eskdale- 
muir ; on the east, by Ewes ; and on the south by Langholm and 
Tundergarth. In length, it extends nearly 10 miles, and in breadth 
from 5 to 6. It contains 27,307 Scotch acres, or 38 square 
miles. The valuation of the parish is 10,808 merks Scotch, or 
L.2570, 17s. 

Topographical Appearances. — The appearance is hilly, with the 
exception of the narrow vale along the Esk, which runs through the 
parish. Some of the hills are covered with heath ; but in gene- 
ral they are green and dry, and afford excellent pasture for sheep. 

Soil.—T\ie soil is various ; the low grounds along the banks of 
the Esk consist of a light loam, and produce abundant crops both 
of wheat, barley, and oats. The soil on the rising ground is a deep 
strong loam, with an intermixture of stones. A considerable quan- 
tity of moss is found upon the top of many of the hills. 

The climate, though somewhat keen and moist, is by no means 
unhealthy, and the people live to a good old age. The prevalent 
complaints are consumption and rheumatism, the latter brought on 
by the sudden alternations from heat to cold. 



430 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



Hydrography. — The Black Esk, which divides this parish on the 
south from that of Eskdalemuir on the north, for nearly one mile, 
falls into the White Esk, at a place called the King Pool, not far 
from the farm-house of Bailiehill. The junction of these two 
rivers forms the Esk, that runs through the parish, by many pic- 
turesque meanderings tovards the south-east, for the space of 
seven miles till it reaches Dowglen-Cleugh ; then it runs along 
the north-side of the parish almost in the same direction till Craig- 
Cleugh, a small stream, which divides this parish from Langholm 
on the south, as Dowglen does on the north side of the Esk. 
Within the bounds of this parish, thirteen burns or rivulets, from 
the hills on the south side of the river, and nine from those on the 
north side, besides the Megget and Stennis water, fall into the Esk. 
The Megget and Stennis have their sources on the south side of a 
ridge of mountains which divide the county of Dumfries from Rox- 
burgh and Teviotdale. These rivers are separated by a ridge of 
hills, and after running southward for six miles, they join at a place 
called Crooks, and about half a-mile from this place fall into the 
Esk, in the neighbourhood of Waukmill. 

Mineralogy. — The prevailing rocks in this parish are, greywacke 
and grey wacke slate. Secondary trap is found on the summit of the 
transition mountains, and generally in, the shape of mountain caps. 
Shell marl is abundant in the farm of Megdale, the property of his 
Grace the Duke of Buccleuch. The pit is not of easy access, being 
situated on the declivity of a hill. On that account, the marl is not 
much used as a manure. 

An antimony mine, the only one in Britain, though not at present 
in operation, was discovered in greywacke, at Glendinning, the pro- 
perty of Sir Frederick Johnston, Bart, of Westerhall, in the year 
1760, but was not regularly worked till 1793, from which time to 
1798, it produced 100 tons of regulus of antimony, valued at L. 84 
per ton, or L. 8400 Sterling. The ore, which was in a state of sul- 
phuret, yielded about fifty per cent. The vein, which seldom ex- 
ceeded twenty inches in thickness, contained blende, calcareous 
spar, and quartz. While in operation, forty people were employ- 
ed, who received from L. 23 to L. 26 annually, besides the grazing 
of a cow at L. 1, and hay for fodder during the winter at 10s. 

Botany. — There are no particular plants found in this parish, of 
an interesting kind. Around the pleasure-grounds of Westerhall, 

" It is said that in former limes a Pictish King was drowned in this pool, — hence 
the name. 



WESTERKIRK. 



431 



there are a great many trees of a large size. Some of the ashes 
are from 11 feet to 12 in circumference. The oak, the elm, the 
plane, the horse chestnut, and every other kind of forest trees 
seem to grow with great vigour. There is a considerable quantity 
of natural wood along the banks of the Esk ; besides the thriving 
plantations of Craigs and Westerhall. W cannot omit to men- 
tion a row of thirteen beautiful trees along the west side of the 
churchyard, which are highly ornamental. 

Fishes. — Salmon, sea-trout, herling, and the common burn-trout, 
are very plentiful in the different streams. Salmon, in former times, 
were very abundant in the Esk ; but are now considerably dimi- 
nished by means of acciZZ made across the river at Netherbie, to sup- 
ply water for the mills which Sir James Graham has erected at 
Longtown. Unless there is a great flood, the salmon cannot get 
over this barrier. The Esk, the Megget, and the Stennis water 
afford excellent sport to the angler. 

Game of all kinds is most abundant. The black-cock, grouse, 
partridge, and pheasant are found in great numbers. The wood- 
cock and other migratory birds are seen in their seasons. Indeed, 
all the species of common birds are found in the woods around 
Westerhall ; and the curlew, lapwing, plover, and snipe on the hills. 
The bittern, though rarely, is sometimes seen. 

II. — Civil History. 

Parochial Registers. — The earliest date of baptisms and mar- 
riages is 169.3; and of deaths, 1804. From the above dates to 
the present time, these registers have been regularly kept. 

Land-owners. — The valuations of the principal land-owners, as 
stated in the stent roll, are. in merks Scotch, as follows : — His Grace 
the Duke of Buccleuch, 5863; Sir Frederick G.Johnston, Bart, of 
Westerhall, 2425 ; Mrs Dirom, of Craigs, 700 ; Sir Fulteney Mal- 
colm, of Dowglen, 225. The only resident heritor is Sir Fulteney 
Malcolm. Sir Frederick Johnston occasionally resides during the 
shooting season. 

Modern Buildings. — Westerhall, the ancient seat of the John- 
stones, is delightfully situated, being enclosed with wood, and sur- 
rounded with precipitous hills. The other buildings are Burnfoot 
and Hopesrigg, the residence of Mr Borthwick, one of the most 
enterprising tenants of the Duke of Buccleuch. We cannot omit 
mentioning, also, the mausoleum or family vault of the Johnstones, 
in the churchyard, which is a piece of excellent architecture. It 
is built in a circular form, and finished with a handsome dome, sup-

ported by fluted columns of the Doric order, and highly ornament- 
ed with a richly carved frieze. 

Eminent Men. — This parish is very remarkable as being the birth- 
place of men who have signalized themselves in every department 
of literature and science. — Mr Pulteney, who married the Coun- 
tess of Bath, and the 'keen opposer of the administration of Sir Ro- 
bert Walpole; Governor Johnston, who was celebrated as an offi- 
cer and a senator; Sir James Johnstone, who represented in many 
Parliaments, the Dumfries-shire burghs ; Sir John Malcolm, well 
known as an officer, a statesman, and an author, to whose memory 
a monument is now erecting on Langholm hill, the foundation-stone 
of which was laid with masonic honours in September last by Sir 
James Graham, Bart, of Netherbie ; and Thomas Telford, Esq. an 
eminent civil-engineer, and the constructor of many public works, 
the unperishable monuments of his genius, who was born of hum- 
ble parentage in this parish, in the year 1755. The last named 
individual began life as a common mason in his native parish, 
and for years had no professional fame except the neatness with 
which he lettered tombstones. In the churchyard, there is a sim- 
pie stone, erected to his father's memory, the inscription upon 
which was amongst the first of his attempts in this line. It would 
occupy too much space in a work of this kind, to give a lengthened 
sketch of his rising merit. We may state, however, that in Lon- 
don, his first employer was Sir William Chambers, while building 
Somerset House, — who soon discovered his talents, and brought 
him into notice. The Menai and Conway bridges, the Caledonian 
Canal, the St Katharine Docks, will ever remain monuments of his 
architectural genius. He died at his house in Abingdon Street, 
Westminster, in the seventy-ninth year of his age. He was buried 
in Westminster Abbey. 

Antiquities. — On a neck of land between the Esk and the Meg- 
get, and part of the farm of Westerker, there are several whin- 
stones placed erect in the ground, which have every appearance 
of the remains of a Druidical temple. There are many vestiges 
of Roman encampments on the tops of the hills in the north-west 
end of the parish, which seem to have been out-stations of the Ro- 
man camp of Castle O'er in the south end of Eskdalemuir. Seve- 
ral others can be traced along the banks of the Esk, which in all 
probability formed the chain of communication between the camp 
of Castle O'er and the one at Netherbie, near Longtown. — A great 
number of burians are in this parish, of a circular form, and mea-

SLirino- from 36 to 50 yards in diameter. These are supposed 
by some antiquaries to be remains of Pictish encampments ; while ' 
others are of opinion that they were merely places of strength mto 
which the people collected their cattle at night for security from 
the Enalish borderers. There is also a third conjecture, that they 
were for the purpose of protecting the cattle during the night from 
the ravages of the wild beasts, when the country was covered with 
wood. This last supposition is perhaps the most correct. On the 
farm of Enzieholm, there are vestiges of an old fortification ot a 
triangular form. It has the appearance of a place of great anti- 
quity, and of considerable strength. No conjecture at this dis- 
tance of time can be formed, either as to the time when it was 
built, or by whom it was possessed. There are remams of an old 
castle at Glendinning, and of another at Westerhall.

There is one bhnd person in the parish, and five fatuous ; but 
none of them receive aid from the parochial funds. 

Character of the People.— The tenantry of this parish bear an ex- 
cellent character for integrity and honour. As farmers, they are skil- 
ful and industrious, and spare no expense either in the improvement 
of their stock or of their farms. The lower classes are sober and in- 
telligent. The generality of them are fond of reading ; and, as they 
have an ample supply of books, the shepherds in particular have ac- 
quired a degree of knowledge and information beyond what might 
have been expected from their situation in life. In their dress they have 
nothing peculiar ; the black and white plaid worn round the shoul- 
ders is universally used. No class of people are more contented with 
their situation. Indeed, the superior comfort of the lower classes 
in this parish, and in all the extensive pastoral and agricultural dis- 
tricts of the numerous parishes of which the Duke of Buccleuch 
is the sole or principal proprietor, obviously arises from the wise 



44 

DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



and liberal policy which has characterized the management of 
Buccleuch property for ages. That family have Invariably 
et their extensive possessions to tenants on such terms as secure 
tiieir comfort and independence. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy. 

The number of acres arable and of rneaJow land, may be computed at . 1560 

Rent of Land.-K. the arable land in this parish is uniformly 
let with the hill pasture the rent per acre cannot be accurately 
ascertained There are fifteen stock-farmers in the parish whose 
farms would average nearly 1800 acres each, and who employ, as 
shepherds and labourers in agriculture, 59 individuals. The iraz 
ing of an ox or cow costs from L. 3, lOs. to L. 4 ; and that of a 
lull-grown sheep, 5s. 

Live Stock.-The only breed of cattle in this parish is the Gal- 
loway. It IS found well adapted for the pasturage, rises to a 
good size, finds a ready market, and brings high prices. The num- 
ber o/heep grazed may be estimated at nearly 18,000, which are 
all of the Cheviot breed,— to the improvement of which every at- 
tention is paid. 

Raio Produce.-The whole of the grain, &amp;c. raised in this pa- 
rish is consumed by the growers in maintaining their families and 
servants. Wool and sheep are the staple commodities. The re 
claiming of waste land by draining and building stone dikes is 
carried to its utmost extent. Farm buildings are all good No 
obstacle to improvements arises, in this parish, either from want 
of capital or of encouragement by the proprietors. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Langholm is the nearest market-town, distant about five miles. 
It is also the post-town. 

The public roads are all good, and kept in excellent repair, and 
afford ready communication in every direction. No mail or stage- 
coach passes through the parish. 

Ecclesiastical State.~T\\e manor of Westerker, with the ad- 
vowson of the church, belonged to the family of Soulis, during the 
twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Upon the forfeiture of John de 
Soulis, Robert I. granted, in 1321, to the monks of Melrose the 
half of the barony of Westerker, to be held in free forest, and also 
the patronage. The monks retained the possession, till the Re- 
formation. Before the Reformation, there was an established 
chapel, dedicated to St Martin, at Bogkin, in this parish, under 



WESTEIIKIRK.

the mother church. Adam de Glendonyng mortified, in 1391, 
some lands in the barony of Hawick for the support of this chap- 
lainry for the safety of the souls of James, late Earl of Douglas, 
and Sir James Simon of Glendonyng, his brother-in-law; also, for 
his own soul, Margaret his wife, and their children. Bartholomew 
de Glendonyng, grandson of the granter, took orders in the church, 
and was presented to the chapel; but Andrew, the Bishop of 
Glasgow, deprived him of his charge, in 1459, on account of non- 
rGSiclcncG 

The church was built in 1788; it is in excellent repair, and 
may contain nearly 700 sitters. It is very centrically placed,— the 
farthest distance being five miles. The number of communicants 
is 170. The manse was built in 1783, and substantially repaired, 
along with the office houses, in 1821. The glebe contains twenty 
acres of good arable ground, and is well enclosed. The stipend, 
as augmented in 1820, is 14 chalders, half meal, half barley, at the 
highest fiar prices of the county, — with the pasturage of 44 sheep 
on the neighbouring farm of Hertonhill. 

There is not a Dissenting meeting-house in this parish ; and the 
number of Dissenters is, 14 Burghers, who attend a chapel at 
Langholm, and 2 Cameronians, who occasionally hear sermon at 
Ettrick. 

Education. — There is only one parochial school, — with the maxi- 
mum salary, and the legal accommodations. The branches of in- 
struction taught are, English, writing, arithmetic, geography, Latin, 
and Greek. The average number attending the school in summer 
is from 40 to 45, and in winter 70. The school is centrically pla- 
ced, and there is no need of an additional one. The probable 
amount of school fees received may vary from L. 21 to L. 22. 
There is also, a small school kept by a woman, who teaches En- 
glish and sewing. At the village of Jamestown, where the miners 
and their families formerly resided, sometimes a school is opened 
for the winter months. The people are alive to the benefits of 
education ; and there is a visible change in their conduct and 
morals since the facilities of education were increased. There is 
not an individual betwixt six and fiifteen years of age who cannot 
read and write. 

Literature. — In the year 1795, a library was instituted in this 
parish, which contains many valuable works, several of which were 
presented by the late Mr Telford, civil-engineer. So much Was 
he impressed with the advantages arising from select libraries, that 
he bequeathed to this library the handsome sum of L. 1000, he 



" DUMFRIES-SIIIRE. 

interest of which is annually to be laid out in f ho purchase of books 
1 he sole management of this bequest is vested in the minister 
and kn-k-session. 

Charitable Institutions.— A friendly society was instituted in the 
year 1789, which has all along been in a flourishing condition, and 
IS of great benefit to sick members. At this time, it has a capital of 
L. 300. The terms of admission are regulated according to the 
age of the applicants. The quarterly contribution from each mem- 
ber IS Is. 7d. The sick receive weekly for three months 4s., and 
after that period 2s. 6d. The allowance for funeral expenses is 
L. 1, 10s., and each member gives the widow, or nearest relation. 
Is. There is no saving bank ; and the nearest is at Langholm. ' 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— Foor rates were instituted in this 
parish in 1773. The assessment for the last year amounted to 
L. 80, or about 4s. 6d. per cent, upon the valued rental. The weekly 
collections average 5s.;— from which sum L. 1, 10s. is paid quarterly 
to the assessment. There is also a sum of L. 230 at interest in the 
bank, with another of L. 100, the interest of which is given to the 
schoolmaster for registering all the children baptized in the church. 
The dues of proclamation, fines exacted for irregular conduct, and 
fees for the use of the mortcloth, go all to the session funds,— except 
one shilling, which is given to the session-clerk for every marriage. 
The number of poor on the roll is 18, besides a few who occasionally 
receive relief. Perhaps there is no parish in Scotland where the 
wants of the poor are so well supplied, or their comfort better looked 
after. No public begging is allowed. None, except real objects 
of charity, or those upon whom misfortune has suddenly fallen, 
seek relief from the poors' funds. 

Inns. — There is only one inn in the parish. 
Fuel— Feat is very much used, and costs per cart load 2s. 
Many families use coal, which is brought from the pits at Cano- 
bie, a distance of twelve miles, by a very good road. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Great improvements have taken place, in this parish, since 
1793. Every new improvement in agriculture has been introduced 
that promised to be advantageous. In the improvement of pas- 
ture ground by draining and building of dikes, great advantages 
have resulted both in drying the sheep walks and in affording shel- 
ter,— so that the diseases, poke and rot, formerly common, are now 
almost unknown. The facilities to markets, by good roads in all 
directions, have been greatly increased.

PRESBYTERY OF LANGHOLM, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. ROBERT SHAW, MINISTER. 



L — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — This parish was anciently called Ewesdale, which has 
now been contracted into Ewes, the name of the river, from the 
Celtic Uisge, signifying water. 

Extent, Boundaries. — This pastoral and mountainous parish is 
situated in the north-east corner of the county, and is bounded on the 
south by Langholm. It extends 8 miles in length, and about 5 
in breadth, and contains 24469 Scotch acres, or 34 square miles. 

Soil, Sfc. — The appearance of the country on both sides of the 
Ewes is hilly ; and the hills are nearly green, with the exception 
of some small pieces covered with heath, which afford both pro- 
tection and food for the various species of game. 

In the low land along the banks of the river, the soil is light and 
gravelly ; and on the high grounds, it has a tendency to a deep 
loam. In favourable seasons, good crops of oats, barley, potatoes, 
and turnips are raised on the low grounds. 

The climate upon the whole is salubrious, and no epidemic was 
ever known to prevail in the parish. The common diseases are, 
rheumatism, consumption, and catarrhs, arising from the dampness 
of the climate, or the sudden changes from heat to cold. 

Mivers. — The water of Ewes runs through the parish for eight 
miles, has its source near Moss Taul, in the northern extremi- 
ty of the country, and falls into the Esk at Langholm, two miles 
below its southern boundary, dividing it nearly into two parts. In 
the east part of the parish, the water of Tarras takes Its rise, and, 
running almost south-west, falls also into the Esk, about three 
miles below the town of Langholm. 

Mineralogy. — The prevailing rocks in this parish belong to the 
transition class, and of these the most abundant are greywacke and 
grey wacke slate. Greenstone also occurs, and on the summits of some 

• Drawn up by a Probationer of the Church of Scotland.

of the transition mountains, secondary or floetz trap rocks occur 
It IS supposed coal may be found in the parish, but hitherto no trial 
has been made. 

2ooy._Salmon in the spawning season are found in the rivers. 
The sea trout, the herling, and particularly the burn trout, are 
caught in great numbers. Black-cock, grouse, partridge, pheasant, 
hare, and rabbits are most abundant. The woodcock, curlew, plover, 
lapwing, and snipe are also plentiful. The fox, the polecat, weasel,' 
and hedgehog are common. 

n. — Civil History. 

Parochial Registers. — Session records were begun to be kept 
in this parish so early as 1646. In the same year, the registration 
of baptisms and marriages commenced ; and that of deaths in 1717. 
From 1646 to 1680 the records of baptisms and marriages have' 
been correctly kept. In 1694, they were resumed by the prelates, 
and since that time to the present they have been kept with much 
accuracy, and preserved with great care. They are voluminous, 
and contain much curious and interesting information regarding 
the early discipline of the church. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners are, His Grace the Duke 
of Buccleuch, Mr Elliot of Arkleton, Mr Beattie of Muckledale, 
and Mr Lamb of Cooms and Middlemass. 

There are no resident heritors in the parish, neither are there 
any modern buildings, mansion-houses, or manufactories. 

Antiquities.— The only antiquity to be found in the parish is 
the remains of a small station, which evidently appears from its 
formation to be either Saxon or Pictish. No medals, coins, arms, 
or other antiquities have been discovered. 

III. — Population. 

The population in 1 755 amounted to 392

tented with their lot, and enjoy in a reasonable degree both the 
comforts and necessaries of life. The tenants are all industrious.

exemplary, and regular in their attendance on public worship. 
An air of satisfaction and contentment pervades their dwellings, 
and the heart of every philanthropist must rejoice to know that 
they enjoy a competent share of the blessings of life. No poach- 
ing of game prevails in this parish.

Rent of Land— the low and high lands are let together, the 
rent per acre cannot be accurately known. The grazing of an ox 
or cow may be estimated at from L. 3 to L. 3, 10s., and a full-grown 
sheep at 5s. 

Live Stock. — In all this district, the Galloway breed of cattle is 
preferred. They are hardy, thrive well on the pastures, find a 
ready market, and bring good prices. The number of sheep pas- 
tured may be about 18,000. They are all of the Cheviot breed, 
and every attention is paid to their improvement. All modern 
improvements in husbandry have been introduced, and draining and 
building dikes on the high grounds have been carried on to a great 
extent. 

The state of farm-buildmgs in point of accommodation and 
convenience cannot be surpassed. The Noble Duke and the 
other proprietors withhold nothing from their tenantry that can 
promote their comfort and happiness. The whole grain raised 
in the parish is consumed in the maintenance of the families of 
the growers. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

There is no market-town in this parish, and the nearest is Lang- 
holm, which is distant five miles. Langholm is also the post-town. 
There is no village. 

Means of Communication. — The means of communication in all 
•directions are good. The great road from Edinburgh by Hawick, 
Langholm, and Carlisle to London, runs along the banks of the 
Ewes, for the space of eight miles within the parish. The Car- 
lisle mail, besides several other coaches to London, run on this road. 
This line of road was planned by Mr Pulteney of Westerhall, who 
obtained an act of Parliament for carrying it into execution in 1763. 
There are two other public roads, the one leading to the east, 
which affords a ready communication to Liddesdale, and the other 
to Dumfries and Moffat. Both of these roads were made, by an

DUMFUIES-SIIIRK. 



act of Parliament laying an yearly assessment upon the lands of the 
different heritors according to their valued rent, and which the 
tenants pay in lieu of the ordinary statute labour. 

Ecclesiastical State.Before the Reformation, there were two 
churches and two chapels in this parish. The principal church 
of Ewesdale was dedicated to St Cuthbert, and stood on the west 
side of the Ewes, near a hamlet called Kirktown of Nether Ewes. 
Robert, the son of Radulph, the parson of St Cuthbert of Ewis- 
dale, having sworn fealty to Edward L, obtained from him a pre- 
cept to the sheriff of Dumfries for restoring him to his rights. 
The other church was situated at Ewesduris, in the upper part 
of the vale, where a pass leads into Teviotdale. From this pass 
the termination of the name was derived; drws in the British 
and duras in the Irish signifying a pass. One of these chapels 
in Ewisdale stood at Unthank, and the other at Moss Paul, on 
the south side of the valley where their ruins may still be seen. 

The advowson of the Overkirk of Ewes belonged in the reign 
of James IV. to John Lindsay of Wauchope, who held the ten 
pound lands of old extent in Ewesdale. By his forfeiture in the 
year 1505, the lands and patronage fell to the Crown, and were 
granted to Alexander Lord Home ; after whose forfeiture, in 1516, 
they were granted to Robert Lord Maxwell, in the same year and 
month. 

The Overkirk of Ewes was deserted after the Reformation, and 
the kirk of Nether Ewes served the whole valley. The advowson 
of the parish of Nether Ewes, with the tithes and church lands, 
belonged to the Earls of Nithsdale, during the reigns of Charles II. 
and of William. The patronage afterwards passed to the family 
of Buccleuch, and the Duke is now patron. The church was 
repaired in 1831 ; it may contain 200 sitters, and is very centri- 
cal. The number of communicants is 87. The manse and office- 
houses were put into excellent order, the same year. The glebe 
contains 30 acres arable, and is well enclosed. The stipend is 
15 chalders, half meal half barley, payable at the highest fiar 
prices of the county, with L. 6, 8s. 8d. for communion elements. 
No Dissenting meeting-house is in this parish, and the number 
of Dissenters is only 14. 

Education. — There is only one parochial school, and the teach- 
er has the maximum salary with the legal accommodation. The 
branches of instruction taught are, English, writing, arithmetic, 
geography, Latin and Greek, French and mathematics. The 



EWES. 



441 



average number of scholars may be about 30. The school is cen- 
trical, and there is no need of an additional one. The amount of 
fees may average L. 11, exclusive of L. 3 given for collecting the 
poor's rates, and L. 2 for acting as precentor and session-clerk. 
There is not a single individual in this parish betwixt six and fif- 
teen years of age who cannot read or write, nor is there one up- 
wards of fifteen. Indeed there is not a single father of a family 
who is not alive to the benefits of education, or who would think 
that he had performed a father's duty, if he did not give his 
family, at least the common branches of education. 

Poor-houses. — These houses were founded in 1761, by the Rev. 
Mr Malcolm, minister of the parish, and grandfather of the late 
Sir John Malcolm, for the support of four families supposed to 
be the most needful in the parish. The Duke of Buccleuch gives 
to each a quarter of an acre of ground for a garden. The mi- 
nister and elders have the appointment. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — Poor-rates were instituted in this 
parish in 1773. The assessment forlastyearamountedto L. 41, 10s. 
upon the valued rental- The number on the poor's roll is only 6, but 
occasional relief is given to a few others, and to poor and distres- 
sed travellers. The weekly collections average Is. lld. or 
nearly L. 5 per annum. The poor receive quarterly L. 1, 10s., 
and their comforts are in every respect carefully looked after. 
No legacies or other funds have been left to the poor of this pa- 
rish. There is no disposition among the poor to seek relief unless 
compelled by absolute necessity. 

Inns. — One. 

Fuel. — Peat is the principal fuel, which costs per cart load 
2s. 6d. The nearest coal pits are at Canobie, where the cart load 
can be purchased for 2s. 6d. The distance is only eleven miles, 
and the road is good.

<p>

PRESBYTERY OF LOCHMABEN, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. ANDREW B. MURRAY, MINISTER. 



1. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, Sfc. — The name of this parish was formerly 
spelt Muswald and Mosswald, and is evidently derived from the 
Saxon word toalda or ivealt, which signifies the woody district, or 
forest near the moss; in former times, the whole of the lower 
grounds, not only of this parish, but of the extended range from 
Tinwald to the Solway Frith, were covered with wood. The pa- 
rish is bounded on the west by Torthorwald; on the north by 
Lochmaben ; on the east by Dalton ; and on the south by Ruth- 
well. It extends from 4 to 5 miles in length, and in breadth from 
2 to 3, and contains 4725 Scotch acres, or 85 square miles. In- 
cluding the part of Lochar Moss which lies in the parish, its figure 
may be said to resemble that of a heart, contracting on the north 
and south quarters as it falls to the moss, and still becoming nar- 
rower till it terminates on the river Lochar, which separates it from 
the parish of Caerlaveruck. 

Topographical Appearances. — The appearance of this parish is 
plain and level, with some rising grounds, which, however, have so 
gentle an acclivity that they are cultivated to the very summit. 
The elevation of the highest of these hills above the level of the 
sea may be computed at about 686 feet. 

Soil, c. — The soil is very diversified, from the extent of moss 
ground which is within its bounds. The farms which are contiguous 
to the moss have a considerable portion of pasture ground both wet 
and marshy ; and a part of the arable ground is in the same state. 
Where the ground rises above the level of Lochar Moss, the soil 
is light and sandy. A considerable part of the parish adjoining to 
these farms, though rising considerably above them, and which is 
about one mile in breadth and nearly level, is also light and sandy, 
or a thin soil with a gravelly bottom interspersed with stones,

MOUSWALD.

which runs into broom in the course of three or four years, even 
when laid down in good heart with grass seeds. Towards the 
eastern part of the parish, where the grounds rise considerably 
hio-her, the soil is tolerably deep and rich, and produces good crops 
of every description. 

Within the bounds of this parish, there are 882 acres of moss. 
Nevertheless, the air is pure and healthy,— which is attributed to 
the vicinity of the sea, distant four miles from the centre of the pa- 
rish. The medium temperature is about 46° and the prevaihng 
winds are from the south-west; and from the same quarter we 
have the heaviest falls of rain. 

Hydrography. — The only river in the parish is the Lochar, which 
runs through it, for- a very few yards. There are several rivulets 
that have their source in the higher grounds, and abundantly wa- 
ter the parish, falling into the Lochar. There is also a copious 
supply of spring wells. The well of St Peter's, which is nearly 
100 yards west from the church, is one continued spring for 30 or 
40 yards. This spring, even in the severest frosts, never freezes, 
nor does the rivulet into which it runs freeze for a considerable 
distance after their junction. 

Geology. — The chief rocks in this parish are greywacke and 
greywacke slate. Indeed, the soil of the best land in the parish is 
formed from the decomposition of these rocks. On the farm of 
Bucklerhole a blue limestone rock is found, the same as that at 
Rookan, in the neighbouring parish of Torthorwald, which ef- 
fervesces freely with acids. The substratum of Lochar Moss is 
chiefly fine white sand, — affording a strong and incontrovertible 
proof that at one time the tide must have overflown the whole of 
this extensive moss. 

Zoology. — All the common birds are found in great numbers in 
this parish. Among the more rare that are met with, we may 
mention, without observing any particular ornithological classifica- 
tion, the golden-crested wren  Regulus cristatus,  found in the 
woods of Rockhall, and the long-tailed titmouse f Parus caudatus, 
found also in the same place. The woodlark  Alauda arhorea, 
the gray wagtail  Motacilla boarula, the yellow wagtail  M.Jia- 
va,J are also common. The moor buzzard f Circus ceruginosiis  
is occasionally seen in the Lochar Moss. The bullfinch  Loxia 
pyrrliula the goldfinch Fringilla carduelis, the common linnet 
 Linaria vulgaris, are abundant. The jay  Corvus glanda- 
rim, the missel-thrush Turdus viscivorus, and the common

night-jar  Caprimulgus Europceus, are seen in the woods of Rock- 
hall. The black-cock  Tetrao tetrix, and grouse  Lagopus Sco- 
ticus, are frequently found in the moss. — Water Birds. The bit- 
tern  Botaurus stellaris, the common curlew  Numenius arqua- 
ta,J the lapwing Vanellus cristatus, the golden plover  CJiara- 
drius pluvialis, and the snipe  Scolopax gallinago, are abundant. 
The common wild duck  Anas boschas J hatches here in great 
numbers. The wild swan f Cygnus ferus, and the wild goose 
 Anser ferus, are frequently shot in the Lochar Moss. The 
woodcock, the cuckoo, the fieldfare  Turdus pilaris, J and the 
swallow are found in their season. 

Botany. — Among the rare plants met with in this parish we may 
notice the following, viz. the common mare's ta.il {Hippuris vulga- 
ris, the water speedwell [Veronica anagallis, and the greater 
bladder- wort [Utricularia vulgaris, which are found in the ditches 
and stagnant waters in the Lochar Moss. In the meadows we find 
also the small marsh valerian [Valeriana dioica, and the yellow 
goat's-beard [Tragopogon pratensis. In the peat bogs, the cran- 
berry [Vaccinium oxycoccos is gathered in large quantities, and 
sold in the Dumfries market. All kinds of forest trees grow to a 
large size, but particularly oak and ash, — beautiful specimens of 
which are seen around the mansion-house of Rockhall. 

11. — Civil History. 

Landoioners. — The chief land-owners, with their valuations in 
merks Scots, are as follows: Sir Robert Grierson, Bart. 1200; 
Earl of Mansfield, 125; Robert Paterson, Esq. 413, Is. 8d.; Co- 
lonel Harvey of Castlesemple, 389 ; Robert Threshie, Esq. 298, 
6s. 8d. ; John Morison, Esq. 188, besides his farm of Langdykes, 
the valued rent of which is included in the valued rent of Robie- 
what and Raffles; George Cruickshanks, Esq. of Robiewhat, 100; 
Philip Forsyth, Esq. of Raffles, 75. 

Parochial Registers. — The register of births has been regularly 
kept since about 1771 ; but that of marriages and deaths cannot be 
depended upon till of late years. Yearly average of births, 22; 
of marriages, 6 ; and of deaths, 16. 

Antiquities. — The vestiges of five old square buildings are still 
visible, which, in former times, were places both of residence and 
defence against the depredations of the borderers. One of these 
towers, situated at a place called Bucklerhole, or Bucklerhold, had, 
till very lately, two stories, and what was called a watchhouse, re- 
maining ; but the walls are now little more than traceable. The 



MOUSWALD. 



445 



one at Raffles is the most entire. The largest and strongest built 
of these remains of ancient times is that at Mouswald Mains, or, 
as it is there generally called. Place. This stronghold was the' 
mansion of Sir Simon Carruthers, the laird of Mouswald. His only 
dauo- liter was married to one of the Queensberry family, by which 
connection they came into the possession of the estate. In the 
aisle of the old church, there were formerly two statues as large as 
life ; the one a representation of Sir Simon, and the other of his 
lady. That of the lady was cut out of beautiful white freestone, 
which has now been completely carried away piece -meal. The 
one of Sir Simon, which is still preserved, represents him with his 
head lying on a pillow, his feet on a lion, and his hands raised in a 
praying posture. Unfortunately there is neither date nor inscrip- 
tion. — There are also several camps in the parish, in all probability 
British. The one at Burronhill has a strong double fosse or ditch. 
In digging the foundation for a new school-house some time ago 
near to this place, a considerable quantity of human bones were 
found. There is another near the summit of a small hill called 
Panteth hill, which, from its extensive and commanding view, must 
evidently have been a watch tower. 

There are also several burrows or cairns, in which human bones 
have been found, and urns containing small pieces of bones. One 
of these cairns, distant about a mile and a quarter, in an eastern di- 
rection, from the church, is called Stryal, or as some say, the Tryal- 
cairn. Its circumference is 288 feet ; and it is very near to another 
cairn which still retains the name of Deadmangill. Tradition has 
handed down, that at the one place malefactors were tried, and of 
course executed at the other. Urns have been found in different 
parts of the parish, where there were no visible remains of tu- 
muli. 

Resident Heritor. — The only resident heritor is Sir Robert 
Grierson of Lag, Bart. 

Modern Buildings. — The only mansion-house in the parish is 
Rockhall, the seat of Sir Robert Grierson.

Character of the People. — The people in this parish are, ahnost 
without exception, sober, cleanly, and industrious ; and appear in 
every respect contented with their condition, and the circumstances 
in which Divine Providence has been pleased to place them. They 
are regular in their attendance at church, and in partaking of the 
holy ordinances of our religion.

Rent of Land. — The rent of arable land in this parish varies, ac- 
cording to soil and situation, from L. 2 to 6s. per acre. 

Breeds of Live-Stock. — The common breed of catde kept by the 
farmers in general is the Galloway ; to the improvement of which 
great attention has been paid by selecting stock and bulls of the 
purest kind. In this district, farmers find it their advantage to be 
careful in rearing good stock, as their profits depend more upon a 
good sale of their black-cattle, than on their grain produce. Be- 
sides, no breed of cattle is more sought after or so readily bought 
up by the English dealers. Cows of the pure Galloway breed 
bring from L. 8 to L. 10 ; two year old stots of the same kind, 
from L. 5 to L. 7, 10s. Farmers in general sell their young stock 
at this age. 

Farm horses able for their work, of which a considerable num- 
ber is reared in the parish, bring from L. 20 to L. 30 ; and some of 
great power and fine symmetry, L. 45. Great numbers of pigs are 
both reared and fed in this parish. Farmers now think it more pro- 
fitable to consume their oats and potato crop in feeding swine than 
by carting them to the Dumfries market, particularly as a ready 
market is found for the pork to be carried into England.

Husbandry —All the modern improvements in agriculture have 
been successfully introduced into this parish, such as the use of 
bone manure for raising turnips, and eating them off the ground 
with sheep, which has been found to improve the soil very much. 
Drainino- where it can be effected, is carefully attended to; and very 
considerable portions of the moss ground, particularly of late years, 
have been redeemed from a state of waste, and converted into good 
arable o-round. The general duration of leases is nineteen years, 
which, According to the mode of cropping adopted in this quarter, 
has been found to be the most favourable for both parties. The 
state of farm-buildings would admit of great improvement ; but the 
subdividing and enclosing with proper fences the different arable 
fields, has been by no means neglected. 

v.— Parochial Economy. 

Market-Toion, 4c.— Dumfries, distant six miles from the centre 
of the parish, is the post town, and the nearest place where regu- 
lar weekly markets are held. There are four small villages, viz. 
Mouswald, which may consist of about thirty inhabited houses, with 
a population of 125 ; Woodside, 70 ; Cleughbrae and Banks, 74. 

Means of Communication— The means of communication, in 
every direction, enjoyed by this parish, are excellent. The turn- 
pike and parish roads are kept in the very best state of repair. The 
great post-road from Carlisle to Dumfries and Portpatrick, which 
was finished in 1776, runs through the parish from south-east to 
north-west, by the church and manse. Another road runs almost 
in the same direction, and nearly parallel along the rising ground 
of the eastern division of the parish. Between these two roads, 
there is also another parish road, which runs from the church to 
Torthorwald, and gives easy access to the markets held at Loch- 
maben and Lockerbie. This road leads also to the lime-works 
at Kelhead, to Annan, and to Ruthwell. It was made by the 
road-money, which is paid instead of the statute labour. Suf- 
ficient bridges, wherever they were required, are thrown over all 
these roads. The Carlisle and Portpatrick mail-coach, besides 
several heavy coaches to different parts of England, travel on the 
principal turnpike road, affording an easy and ready communica- 
tion to all parts of the world. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church of Mouswald was dedicated 
to St Peter; and there is near it, as we have mentioned, the remark- 
able spring consecrated to the same saint. At what time, the old 
church was built, which was taken down a few years ago, is not known. 



448 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



In the reign of James VI., the lands of Mouswald, with the ad- 
vowson of the church, belonged to Sir James Douglas of Drum- 
lanrig, who conferred them upon his second son, James Douglas 
of Mouswald, whose descendants enjoyed them in the reign of 
Charles II. They were held of the chiefs of the Douglas family 
when they returned to the Duke of Queensberry's property. On 
the death of Duke William, in 1810, the property of Mouswald, 
with the patronage of the church, fell to Sir Charles Douglas of 
Kelhead, Bart, who, at the same time, succeeded to the title of 
Marquis of Queensberry. 

The present church is a very handsome modern building, erect- 
ed within these few years. It is very centrical, and stands on a 
fine eminence, and is visible from every farm in the parish except 
three. It may contain about 386 sitters. The manse and office- 
houses are also newly built. They are finished in a substantial 
manner, affording every comfort and convenience. The glebe 
contains 16 acres, 11 of which are arable, 3 of bog hay, and 2 of 
woodland and pasture. 

The stipend is 15 chalders, half meal, half barley, payable ac- 
cording to the highest fiars of the county, with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for com- 
munion elements. The last augmentation was granted upon the 
4th December 1822. The stipend, converted into money, may 
average, for the last five years, L. 213; glebe, manse, garden, &amp;c 
L. 45 ; total, L. 258. The number of families which attend the 
Established Church is 140 ; of those attending chapels of Dissen- 
ters in Dumfries, 10. There are no Episcopalians in the parish. 
Roman Catholics, 3. The average number of communicants is 
about 170. The only fixed yearly collection for charitable objects 
is for the Dumfries and Galloway Infirmary. 

Education. — There are two schools in the parish, and one for 
young girls. The parish schoolmaster's salary is L. 25, 13s. 5d., 
with the legal accommodation. The branches of instruction taught 
are, English reading, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, geography, 
Latin, and Greek. Emoluments arising from school fees, L. 10. 
The other school has a small endowment of L. 2 per annum, left 
by a late schoolmaster, a native of the parish. From its situation 
it is tolerably well attended. The fees are the same as in the pa- 
rish school, but none of the higher branches of education are taught. 

There is not a single native of this parish betwixt six and fif- 
teen years of age who cannot read and write a little. The people 
in general are alive to the benefits of education, and there is a 



MOUSWALD. 



449 



marked chano-e in their conduct and morals since the facihties of 
education were increased. There is no part of the parish so dis- 
tant from some one of the schools as to prevent attendance ; on 
that account, no additional school is required. 

Savings Banks, -c— There is no circulating library, nor friendly 
society, nor savings bank, in this parish. The nearest savings 
banks are at Dumfries and the neighbouring parish of Ruthwell. 
The one at Dumfries was established in 1815, and the other in 
1810. Several individuals of this parish have deposited small 
sums in the Ruthwell bank,— the first of the kind, which was in- 
stituted by the clergyman of that parish, Dr H. Duncan. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of poor at present upon 
the roll is 16 ; besides that occasional relief is given to a few others. 
There are no funds for the poor in this parish, except what arise 
from the weekly collections, fines, &amp;c. and the sum of L. 5, which 
was left in the year 1791 by a man who died in Dumfries, whose 
forefathers had been natives of Mouswald. The heritors gene- 
rally assess themselves to raise any additional sum that may be re- 
quired. Last year the assessment was L. 35 ; church collections, 
&amp;c. L. 13 ; making the sum of L. 48, which was distributed. At 
an average, the poor receive 12s. 6d. per quarter. There is nei- 
ther a blind nor a fatuous person in the parish. 

There is no manifest disposition, but rather an aversion at first, 
on the part of the poor, to seek parochial relief ; but it has been 
remarked, and we believe with much truth, that, as soon as they 
do get upon the roll, this feehng immediately dies away, and they 
look upon what the session gives them as their right, which the 
one is as much bound to bestow as the other is entitled to receive. 
At the same time, we are quite aware, that there are others in the 
parish, objects of charity, who would accept of private relief, but 
in no other way. 

Inns. — The parish contains two good inns, which, from the 
great intercourse betwixt England, the south of Scotland, and Ire- 
land, may be considered necessary. The landlords of both are re- 
spectable men, and keep their houses in an orderly manner. 

Fuel. — The common fuel used is peat, procured in great abun- 
dance within the parish. A cart load costs, within the parish, 
from Is. to Is. 6d ; and if carted to any great distance, 2s. From 
the time that is spent in cutting, drying, and carting the peats 
home, farmers, of late, have begun to use more coal than former- 



450 



DUMFllIES-SHlllE, 



ly, — an abundant supply of which is brought by sea from the Eng- 
hsh coast to Dumfries, and sold about 8s. the cart load, or from 
13s. to 14sl per ton. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Great changes in dress, mode of living, comfort in dwelling- 
houses, and improvements in farming have taken place in this pa- 
rish within these last forty years. In 1791, the real rent of the pa- 
rish was L. 1500 ; now it is L. 3690. 

The greatest improvement wanted in this and in some of the 
neighbouring parishes, is the draining of Lochar Moss. 

It is little more than eight years since the cultivation of turnips 
was general in this parish. We may notice, that the higher 
grounds in this parish afford the most extensive prospect in the 
south of Scotland. From one point you have a full view of the 
Solway Frith, several ports both on the English and Scotch sides, 
the Isle of Man, and many of the neighbouring counties; the 
greatest part of Dumfries-shire, Galloway, part of Lanarkshire, 
Peebles-shire ; Northumberland, and Cumberland, in England. At 
the western extremity of the parish, a person standing on one par- 
ticular spot, can throw a stone into each of the four neighbouring 
parishes, Torthorwald, Dumfries, Caerlaverock, and Ruthwell, all 
terminating on the side of the river Lochar, near to this point.

THE REV. DAVID B. DOUIE, MINISTER  



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, Sc. — It is obvious that this parish derives 
its name from Dryfe, a small rivulet that runs through the north- 
west side of it ; Drysdale being a contraction or abbreviation of 
Dryfesdale. It lies in the middle of that beautiful and extensive 
valley commonly called the How of Annandale, and is in 55° 08" 
north latitude, and 3° west longitude. It is 7 miles in length, north 
to south ; at the southern extremity only about a mile broad, but at 
the centre 5, at the north end 3 miles ; and contains in whole up- 
wards of 1 1,000 acres. It is bounded on the south and west, which is 
flat and well cultivated for the space of 6 miles, by the river An- 
nan, which divides it from the parish of Lochmaben ; on the north- 
west by that of Applegarth ; on the north by that of Hutton ; on 
the east and south by the parishes of Tundergarth, and St Mungo. 

Topographical Appearances. — No mountains, but some of the 
most beautiful hills add much to the beauty and diversity of the sce- 
nery, of the parish. The highest and most beautiful is White Wool- 
len or Quhyte Woollen, but generally named White Wynd. The 
pasturage upon it being at one time very good, it used to be covered 
with very white sheep ; from which it is supposed to have taken its 
name. But the lapse of a few years has created a wonderful revolution 
on its appearance. Instead of the once beautiful and white fleeces, 
we have to admire the rich luxuriance of the waving corn, — it being 
now almost all cultivated to the very summit. It is of considerable 
steepness and height, being about 1500 feet above the level of the sea. 
On its summit is a small verdant plain of about 2 acres, of a cir- 
cular form. It has now no traces of antiquity ; but beacons are sup- 
posed to have been lighted on it, to warn the more northerly in- 
habitants of the country of the approach of the English borderers. 

" Drawn up by the lati.' incumbent, the Rev. John Henderson.

DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



On a clear day we have one of the most enchanting and extensive 
views of the whole of the surrounding countries of Annandale, Esk- 
dale, the English border, Solway Frith, part of the Irish sea, even 
of the Isle of Man, and part of Nithsdale and Galloway. On the 
north and south sides of this hill, is a range of lesser ones ; these 
have an imposing and beautiful appearance, being now almost all 
cultivated. They divide the east or high part of the parish from 
the south or low part. At the southern extremity of this range is a 
rising eminence called Mount Holly. Upon the banks of the Cor- 
rie, is a small but beautiful hill named Corrie Law, commanding 
a pleasing and deep prospect beneath. These hills, though some of 
them very steep, are mostly all cultivated and covered with grain, 
potatoes, &amp;c. 

Hydrography. — On the west side of the parish there are two 
spring wells, — one called the chapel well, from its vicinity to the old 
chapel of Beckton : its spring is of great size, being at the great- 
est nearly 15 inches in circumference. The water is found to be 
very light and uncommonly wholesome ; it is supposed to be use- 
ful in stomach complaints. The other, about three quarters of 
a mile farther to the south-west, near the lake called the Old Caul- 
dron from its depth, is called the Woodkin well. It was for- 
merly esteemed very powerful in curing and preventing the effects 
of witchcraft. 

The only stream in the parish is the Dryfe, though the Annan, 
Corrie, and Milk, all touch it on their passage to the Solway Frith. 
The Dryfe rises in the north end of the parish of Hutton, through 
part of which it runs; and enters Dryfesdale, after passing a part of 
Applegarth. It runs a course from north to south for about 2 miles, 
emptying itself into the Annan, in a direct line between the mar- 
ket-town of Lockerbie and the royal burgh of Lochmaben. It 
is a small rivulet, and in moderate weather its water is pure and 
clear. The bed is of a deep gravel, and therefore in dry seasons it 
disappears at some parts for about a mile. But, in rainy weather, it 
comes down in sudden and rapid swells, breakingdown and overflow- 
ing all its banks, so that nothingin the way can resist the impetuosity 
of the torrent. Sheep, pigs, even cattle, and trees torn from their 
roots, have been seen floating on its surface. 

The Annan washes the parish on the west and south for the length 
of miles. It formerly afforded a plentiful supply of salmon, 
herlings, and sea trout; but these are now very scarce, owing to 
causes at present unknown. It abounds much in other small fish. 



DRYFESDALE. 453 

The Milk and Corrie diversify and enrich the east and south-east, 
sides. They have nothing peculiar, but like other streams contain 
plenty of small fish. 

Geology.— 1:0 minerals or ores of any kind are found here. There 
are some beds of a very soft kind of freestone found at Oldwells, 
but not wrought. At the old cauldron near Dryfesdale gate, there 
is some good'shell marl, which is now only wrought by the tenants 
on whose grounds it is found. There is also at Quaas, a quarter 
of a mile west of Lockerbie, at the southern end of the parish, a 
rock of very dark-coloured hmestone, not made use of. The very 
great quantities of rag and whinstone supply the deficiency of sand- 
stone. These make good, durable, and at the same time beautiful 
walls, when skilfully wrought. 

There is Httle peat-moss in the parish, except some small spots 
on the west side. 

11. — Civil History. 
Antiquities. — On the holm of Dryfe, as stated in the former Ac- 
count, about half a mile below the old church-yard, are two very aged 
thorn trees, with a tumulus at their base, called Maxwell's Thorns, 
because they point out the place of the remarkable fight on Dryfe- 
sands, between the Maxwells of Nithsdale, and the Johnstons of An- 
nandale. There are vestiges of strong towers at Old Walls, Kirk- 
town-mains, Nether-place, Myrehead, and Daltonhook. There are 
evident remains of eight camps or forts, some square or Roman, others 
circular or British, and mostly built on eminences, because about 
2000 years since their age the sides of the eminences or hills had 
been covered with growing wood, and the present flat or low lying and 
holm lands in Annandale had partly been a morass, or under water ; 
hence we find, that the Roman roads were generally made on ris- 
ing ground, when it could be got. The most remarkable are two, 
the one British, and the other Roman, facing each other, and se- 
parated by a narrow morass. They are built on two hills east of 
the village Bengali, the name alluding to the forts on the hills, 
signifying the hill of the Gauls. Old pieces of armour and war- 
like weapons have frequently been found in them, and the skeleton 
of a man was found in a cairn on the intervening morass, thought 
to have lain there for some ages ; and some fragments of his dress 
or accoutrements were carried off as a curiosity, particularly the 
sandals, curiously wrought and bound around the mouths with 
leathern thongs, which were conveyed into England, for the Oxford 
Museum. There is also a Roman fort, beautifully situated upon 



454 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



a large eminence, in the centre of the united and extensive holm 
of Dryfe and Annan, called the Gallaberry, or the burgh and sta- 
tion of the Gauls, for the term Berry is of Saxon origin, signify- 
ing " burgh, mansion, or strength." The most entire is a British 
one at Dryfesdale gate, occupying about two acres of ground, and 
commanding a most extensive prospect. Its counterpart is a large 
Roman one about half a mile due east, interrupted by a moor, 
standing on the place celebrated for the bloody battle between 
the army of Julius Agricola and the forces of Corbredus Galdus, 
the twenty-first King of the Scots, about the end of the first cen- 
tury. There are plain traces of the great Roman road from the 
borders of England, up to the vast encampments on the neigh- 
bouring hill of Burnswark, and thence crossing the parish at Lock- 
erbie to Dryfesdale gate, and up to the Gallaberry above-mention- 
ed, where it divided, one branch leading up through Annandale, by 
Moffat to Tweeddale and Clydesdale ; the other branch crossing 
the Annan, touched an entire and beautiful double fort, on the 
northern margin of one of the Lochmaben lakes, called the Woody 
Castle, and thence passed up the west side of the water of M, 
through Nithsdale to the west country.

600 are not in cultivation, and seem never to have been cultivated, 
consisting chiefly of moss, wood, and moor. It is supposed that 240 
acres might yet be cultivated ; and that about 250 are at present 
under wood. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of land, taking one acre with 
another, in the parish is about L. 1 ; of good arable land, L. 2. 
The average rent of grazing is per cow or ox, L. 1, 10s. 6d. ; but 
sometimes L. 3, 10s. is paid on some pastures ; and for a ewe or 
full-grown sheep, about 7s. per annum. 

Produce. — The average gross amount and value of raw produce 
yearly raised in the parish may be as follows : — 

Grain of all kinds, - - L. 7500 

Potatoes and turnips, - - 3700 

Hay, - - - - 1900

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Lockerbie.— The market-town of Lockerbie, the only one in the 
parish, merits a particular description. Lockerbie is supposed to 
have derived its name from Lock, and hie, the Celtic name for a 
station or place of strength. Accordingly, there is an old square 
tower still standing called the Mains, which was the mansion 
place of the ancient family of the Johnstones of Lockerbie, a 
branch of the old family of Johnstone of Lochwood, the ancestor 
of the late Marquis of Annandale, and of the present Marquis 
of Queensberry, and Mr Douglas of Lockerbie. This tower 
had been placed on a ridge, between and almost surrounded 
by two large lochs or lakes, — one on the east and the other 
on the west, which are now drained, and are all either cultivated or 
in rich meadow ; and it may be worthy of notice, that the great 
Roman road already described passed through one of these lochs, 
about half a mile below the tower, at a place called Blackford. 
From this mansion and its dependencies, it gradually increas- 
ed to the size of a village ; and from that, by the liberality of some 
of the lairds of Lockerbie in granting feus and long tacks, it 
has yearly increased to its present dimensions. It is now a neat 
cleanly town, situated in a fertile and inviting part of the country, 
midway between the rivers Annan and Milk : it lies 1 2 miles east 

ft/ 

from Dumfries, and 4 from Lochmaben, 16 south from Moffat, 
17 west of Langholm, 10 north of Annan, and 6 from Ecclefechan. 
The number of inhabitants is of males, 646; of females, 768; 
total, 1414. There are as yet no public manufactures establish- 
ed in the town. Many of the common people here and in the country 
are very expert in making many parts of their own wearing apparel. 

Means of Communication. — The town and parish in general en- 
joy excellent communication, — the great post and turnpike road 
from London to Edinburgh and Glasgow, running through the 
town of Lockerbie and parish, for the length of three miles. On 
the London road, at the north-west side of the parish, is an old 
but strong, firm, and well built bridge, over the Dryfe ; another at 
Scroggs, on a parish road, and over the Milk. But the one most 
worthy of notice is at StuUahill, on the new road from Dum-

fries by Lockerbie to Langholm, built in 1830 by the county road 
proprietors, at a great expense. It is indeed a great ornament 
to this part of the country. It is built all of good Memel tim- 
ber, and consists of seven large arches, supported each by four very 
large perpendicular logs of wood forced into the earth, with strong 
beams, extending from one to another of these, with appropriate ob- 
lique supports ; the whole strongly jointed together with strong 
cast metal, covered above with a double flooring of thick strong 
planks ledged with a beautiful wooden palisade, covered with a coat 
of white oil paint. , The whole is a strong, substantial, and at the 
same time elegant piece of workmanship, and does great credit to 
the undertaker, Mr John Park of Ecclefechan. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is a neat building, 
situated on a small eminence on the west side of the main street 
of Lockerbie, a little north from the centre of the town. It is well 
fitted up in the inside, and handsomely painted. Its situation be- 
ing near the centre of the parish and in the town of Lockerbie, it 
is very conveniently placed for almost all the population. Its dis- 
tance from the farthest extremity of the parish is only about three 
miles and a-half. It was put into good repair in the year 1751, 
and has since been kept so. It may contain about 750 people. 

There are two important benefactions on record, — the first of 
L. 80, given about the year 1751 by the father of the late Earl of 
Hopetoun, the interest of which was to be annually paid to the pa- 
rochial schoolmaster ; the other a legacy of L. 65, left by John Ait- 
cheson, Esq. of Oulney, with a gift of two massive silver communion- 
cups, in 1761. 

On the summit of the old Kirkhill, contiguous to the former 
churchyard, stands the present manse, a neat building ; its situation 
is one of the most beautiful in the whole of Annandale. It was built 
in the year 1782, and is kept in yearly repair by the heritors. It 
is surrounded by a glebe of 24 acres standard measure, at present 

• Previous to the year 1757, the church stood on the middle of the hobn of Drj'fe, 
now called Sandbed, one mile and a-half north of Lockerbie. Tradition says, that 
in the year 1670, from its closeness to that stream, it was gradually undermined and 
carried away by it, and that after this the church and burial-ground was rebuilt at 
a small distance to the south-east in 1761, on a height upon the skirts of the present 
glebe, or as it was then called Kirkhill, and thought to be perfectly secure from the 
swells of the rivulet ; but in the course of time it changed its course, and ran along 
the foot of a scar, above which the church and burial ground stood, parts of which 
gradually fell into the wafer, in spite both of "spades and shovels," and would soon have 
been carried off. In 1757, it was removed to the town of Lockerbie, both as an or- 
nament to, and for the convenience of, the town and parish.

let for L. 24 per annum. The amount of stipend, not including- 
the glebe, is just L. 198, 18s. fid. 

There is an Antiburgher meeting-house at the south end of 
Lockerbie, established about ninety years ago. The minister 
is paid by the congregation, in general from the surrounding pa- 
rishes. The stipend is about L. 95 per annum. There are two 
Sabbath school institutions in winter ; the number of children at- 
tending that connected with the Established Church is about 120, 
in summer about 70. The Established Church is very well attend- 
ed ; the average number of communicants is 600. 

Education. — There is one parochial school in this parish, be- 
sides six private unendowed ones, — three of which are taught bv 
females. The branches of education commonly taught in the paro- 
chial schools are, Greek, Latin, French, with English, writing, 
arithmetic, book-keeping, and practical geometry, &amp;c. &amp;c. In 
one of the unendowed schools, these are also generally taught. 
The salary of the parish schoolmaster is L. 34, 4s. 4d. He has 
every legal accommodation. Every person in the parish above fif- 
teen years of age can both read and write. About eight young men 
go annually to attend the different classes at the University of 
Glasgow and Edinburgh. 

Libraries.— There are two libraries,— one a parochial subscrip- 
tion, and the other a circulating one, in Lockerbie ; besides a pub- 
lic reading-room, having many of the Scotch and English newspa- 
pers of the day. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The average number of poor per- 
sons receiving parochial relief is 18,-each receiving about the ave- 
rage sum of from Is. to Is. 6d. per week. The average amount of 
contributions and free donations to assist the poor is about L. 25 per 
annum,— which, with church collections, may amount to the's"iim of 
L. 65, with the interest of L. 100,-which is, each winter, expend- 
ed by the kirk-session for coals to the poor. These are barely suf- 
ficient to supply the necessitous poor. The people are very liberal 
and benevolent to their own poor, but they are continually annoyed 
by an immense influx of vagrants and beggars from distant places. 
There is still a great desire on the part of some more of the poor 
to get their names enrolled with those that are already receiving 
weekly relief ; and therefore they do not consider it degrading 
Jaz/.- There are no jails nearer than those of Lochmaben and

Dumfries. The old tower at Lockerbie was last year converted 
into a kind of temporary lock-up house; but such is the peaceable 
disposition of the people of this part of the country, that not one 
single person has yet been lodged in it. 

Fairs. — In Lockerbie, there are two fairs and ten markets. 
The two fairs are, the one at Lammas, and te other at Michael- 
mas, when moderate tolls are levied by the proprietor. At the two 
markets, all are free; but besides these, there are in winter weekly 
markets, principally for pork, which is brought from all quarters 
of the surrounding country to be disposed of here. I have known 
the sum of L. 1000 and upwards expended by bacon-curers in one 

day, which they buy in at the average price of 5s. per stone, which, 

when cured and dried, are sold at 6d. or 7d, per lb. 

Such is the importance of the Lammas fair, that I consider a 
short history of it here will not be unsuitable : Lockerbie has been 
celebrated for its lamb and wool market for several centuries back. 
When the border raids had so far ceased as to allow a slight inter- 
course between the Scot and the southern, our sheep farmers as- 
sembled here every year, to meet with Enghsh dealers. This they 
called a tryst ; but, as Lockerbie increased in population, and the 
friendly intercourse between Scotland and England extended it- 
self, the fair became a greater object of importance, and was 
held on the top of that range of hills south of Quhytewoollen, and 
north-east of Lockerbie, which was granted in perpetuity as a 
kind of " common" to that town,— but at what time or by whom I 
have never met with a person who was yet able to inform me. It 
is a curious fact, however, that the common was once dependent 
on the city of Glasgow, until Lady Douglas of Lockerbie House 
bought the right of superiority, who charges so much per head 
upon all the lambs that are shewn on it; and as the charges 
amount in the aggregate to a considerable sum, it is let out by 
roup to the highest bidder a day or two before the custom is 
collected, and he depends for remuneration on the number of lambs 

 The Lammas fair is on 2cl August, old style, excepting Saturday, Sunday, or 
Monday, and in that case on the Tuesday following. The Michaelmas fair is on the 
2d of October, old style, excepting Saturday, Sunday, or Monday, and in that case 
on the Tuesday following. The two markets are on the second 1 hnrsday, old style, m Ja- 
nuary, February, March, April, May. The third Thursday m June. s called the Mid- 
ummer market. The next is fourteen days after the Michaelmas fair, if on Thur - 
day, if not, on the Thursday thereafter. The next is three weeks after the last, cal- 
led the Martinmas one. The other is fourteen days after that, and the last on the 
Thursday before Yule or Christmas, old style. The hiring market for servants for 
the summer half-year is in April. For the winter half year, U.e one fourteen days 
after Michaelmas. To these two markets an immense concourse of people assemble 
from all parts of Annandale.

exposed. In some good years, he pays L. 30 to the proprietor for 
one day's collection. The person that takes it was never known 
to be a loser by it. The common is a round hill of about 100 acres 
in extent. The soil is barren ; in some places overgrown with 
whins; a large portion of it is of a spongy nature, but from its al- 
titude it presents on the fair day a very imposing spectacle. Be- 
sides the lamb-market on the hill, there is an annual fair in the 
town, at which the whole county for twelve miles round is gene- 
rally assembled. 

Inns. — In Lockerbie there are two inns ; at one of which, chaises 
and horses are to be hired ; besides some small ale-houses. These 
houses are, on public occasions, frequented by many for the trans- 
action of business, for receiving payments, &amp;c. and on any of these 
days the people seem to be more regular and sober. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The appearance of the people, as respects their manners, dress, 
inclination to be employed, and aversion to idleness, — shews at 
once that, since the time of the former Statistical Account, there 
has been a progressive advance in these particulars. The improve- 
ment in agriculture is also proved satisfactorily by the great ad- 
vancement in the rent of land since that time, viz. from 13s. 4d. 
the acre per annum to L. 2. The enclosed parks about Lockerbie, 
then set at 17s 6d., are now let at L. 3, 10s. 6d. It may also be 
observed, that at that time there were sixty farms in the parish 
let at from L. 25 to L. 100 yearly rent ; there are now only about 
fifty, each let at from Jv. 60 to L, 500. The population in the 
town of Lockerbie has increased 714; but in the country part of 
the parish there has "been a decrease of 31, — which decrease may 
be owing, perhaps, to many of the small farms having been joined 
into one, and to the dilapidation of many cot houses and villages 
already mentioned. There is one great obstruction to every kind 
of trade in this part of the country, — the great scarcity of fuel. 
This is occasioned by a want of proper internal communication. 

There are in Lockerbie— 20 grocers, 1 hardware, and 4 cloth- 
shops, 5 surgeons with 2 apothecaries shops, 2 midwives, 5 writers, 
4 messengers, 8 weavers, 13 tailors, 7 joiners, 2 wheel-wrights, 9 
blacksmiths, 4 nailers, 3 watchmakers, 4 bakers, 3 fleshers, 1 bar-- 
ber, 3 doggers, 2 saddlers, 2 tanners, 4 stocking-framers, 1 cabi- 
net-maker, 8 shoemakers, 12 stone-masons ; in the country part 
there are, 4 millers, about 100 ploughs, 400 horses, tind 50 farmers.

PRESBYTERY OF PENPONT, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES AND GALLOWAY. 

THE REV. WILLIAM MENZIES, MINISTER. 



• I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Boundaries, 5fc. — This parish forms the south-west side 
of the central basin of the Nith, which comprehends great part of 
the parishes of Closeburn, Morton, Durisdeer, Penpont, and Tyn- 
ron. It derives its name either from some fortress, of the exist- 
ence and history of which all traces have now disappeared, Caer, 
an old British word, signifying a fort; or, according to the somewhat 
fanciful conjecture of Mr Rae in his History of the parish, from 
the colour of its grounds, — the word Keir signifying black or brown. 
This colour, however, which seems formerly to have been in a cer- 
tain degree distinctive of the parish, is gradually yielding to planta- 
tion and extended culture. The extreme length of the parish, from 
north-west to south-east, is about 7 miles, and its extreme breadth 
2 ; but in much of its length it is so narrow that the surface does 
not exceed 1 1 square miles. 

The ridge of Keir hill separates the parish from Glencairn on 
the south-west ; and everywhere else streams form its boundaries. 
Indeed, it may be said to consist of the slopes from that hill down 
to some stream. From Tynron, on the west, it is separated by the 
waters of a small burn and the Shinnel ; from Penpont on the north, 
by the Scar after its junction with the Shinnel ; from 'loseburn 
on the north-east by the Scar and Nith ; and from Dunscore on 
the south by the Allanton burn. 

The high land of the parish consists of the long ridge called the 
Keir hill, and some small branches at both ends of it. This ridge 
is about four miles long. Its highest point bears the name of the 
Waugh hill. Connected with it at its northern extremity is Ca- 
penoch hill ; and to the east of its southern extremity lie the short 
parallel ridges of Kilbride and Blackwood. From all these 
heights there are most beautiful and extensive views, — so many as 

• Close by a farm house, now called Nether Keir, a tower once stood.

eio-ht or ten parish churches being seen from some pomts. Black- 
wood hill, in particular, is noted for commanding all the wmdmgs 
of the Nith, through the rich holms of its central and lower ba- 
sins, from Drumlanrig to the Solway, the view bemg termmated to 
the north by the central chain of the lowlands, and to the south 
by the mountains of Cumberland. 

Adjacent to the Shinnel, Scar, and Nith, are about 300 acres of 
rich holm land. This is separated by a steep wooded bank from the 
table-land of the parish, which stretches to the foot of the hills, and 
becomes gradually narrower and more elevated towards the south- 
east, till it merges into the slope of the hill of Kilbride. Black- 
wood hill dips at once into the Nith. The height of the hills has 
not been ascertained by actual measurement. Aldgirth Bridge is 
about 50 feet above the level of high water at Dumfries; and the 
table-land may be from 100 to 150 more. 

Prognostics of Weather, c. — Springs are observed after long- 
continued drought to rise before rains. Sea gulls appear in un- 
usual numbers before a storm. In clear weather, when the Low- 
thers to the north, and Queensberry to the north-east, assume a 
very indistinct outline, resembling a piece of printing on which the 
types have been shifted, rain may be expected, and in frOst thaw. 
In cloudy weather, a reddish or brassy glare in the morning in that 
part of the horizon which appears in the south-east, between Black- 
wood and the heights of Closeburn, when it decreases, portends 
rain ; when it increases, fair weather. 

The temperature of the atmosphere is extremely mild. But the 
air is generally loaded with moisture, as is proved by the rapidity 
with which the surface of the earth, or fine gravel, becomes covered 
over with mosses. The noxious eflfects of this dampness are in a con- 
siderable degree counteracted by the porousness of the soil, and by 
very extensive draining for the improvement of the numerous bogs or 
small patches of meadow land, with which the whole surface of the 
parish is studded. It is probably owing to the latter circumstance 
that the slow nervous fevers, rheumatisms, and asthmatic disorders, 
which are stated by Mr Wallace in the former Statistical Account 
to have been very prevalent, are by no means so at present. Con - 
sumption is the most frequent and deadly disease ; and stomach 
complaints, originating in poor diet, are common. 

Hydrography. — The whole parish abounds in springs : but none 
of them are known to possess any remarkable property, though in 
some the presence of mineral substances is indicated both by taste

and smell. The only loch of any consequence lies on the border 
of the parish, between Blfickwood and Halliday hills. It is last 
filling up. A part of it now yields an abundant crop of meadow 
hay, and it mirht all be drained, and the land highly improved, 
were it not for a servitude held over it by Allanton mill for sup- 
plying it with water : the burn which drives the mill flowing through 
It. Another to the north-west, now nearly filled up, seems to be the 
loch alluded to in the Macfarlane MSS. " Here is a deep loch, 
called the Loch of Kilbread, in a place pertaining to the Laird of 
Lag, but the water is not reputed medicinal." Keir hill gives 
birth to a great number of burns which intersect the table land of 
the parish. None of them have formed any deep ravine, except the 
Barndennoch burn below Barjarg. This ravine is covered with fine 
trees : pleasure walks have been cut through it; and it possesses a 
great attraction in a singularly beautiful waterfall. The hill of 
Blackwood is the great barrier which seems at some remote period 
to have pent up the waters of the Nith, so as to form a lake of 
great dimensions in the basin above. A considerable extent of 
alluvial land, nearly at the same level, about thirty feet above the 
present holms in the parishes of Keir, Penpont, and Closeburn, 
bear testimony to its existence. 

Geologij, c— The parish of Keir, as is the case with most of the 
upper part of Dumfries-shire, is chiefly composed of greywacke, 
which exhibits considerable variety in its characters, the component 
parts being in many cases very large, while in others they are so 
minute that the mass has a very homogeneous aspect, and bears a 
considerable resemblance to a trap rock. 

In some parts, however, newer rocks occur, and those are prin- 
cipally Hmestone and sandstone. 

The limestone is generally of a reddish colour, owing to a con- 
siderable admixture of iron, and contains numerous small cavities 
filled with crystals of calcareous spar. A few petrifactions are oc- 
casionally met with. 

The principal localities of the limestone are at Barjarg and 
Porterstown, and in both of these places it is regularly quarried. 
The Barjarg limestone has been found by analysis to contain about 
fifty-four per cent, of carbonate of lime, and thirty-six per cent, of 
carbonate of magnesia. The limestone of Porterstown has not as 
yet been regularly analyzed, but appears to be much the same as 
the other, though it probably contains a larger portion of foreign 
matters. 



KEIR.

According to Mr Mentcatli Edin, New Phil. Journal, Vol. v. 
p. 45, the Barjarg limestone appears to be a continuation of the 
great 'bed of limestone at Closeburn on the opposite side of the 
Nith, although their connection cannot be distinctly traced, owing 
to a dislocation of the strata. Their chemical composition is, 
however, almost precisely the same ; but at Closeburn there is a 
lower stratum of hmestone which contains no magnesia, and is 
nearly pure carbonate of lime. This stratum has not as yet been 
found at Barjarg, which is probably owing to the quarry not hav- 
ing been v/orked to a sufficient depth. 

The strata at Barjarg dip towards the north-east under a small 
angle, while at Porterstown the dip is more towards the east. 

Sandstone occurs, lying above the limestone, and conformably 
with it, in both these quarries. At Barjarg there is a bed of hard 
red sandstone, 12 feet thick, under the limestone. At Porterstown 
the sandstone at the upper part is of a fine texture and whitish co- 
lour. This, as it approaches the hmestone, becomes much mixed 
with mica, and acquires a slaty structure. At Waterside, sand- 
stone occurs, accompanied with a variety of slate clay ; and the 
appearances were such as to induce the proprietor to bore for coal 
some years since, but the attempt proved unsuccessful. 

From the imperfect developement of the limestone and sand- 
stone, it is difficult to determine precisely the formation to which 
they belong. But it appears probable that they may be referred 
to the older part of the secondary series, and possibly to the lower 
part of the coal formation. Judging, however, from the general 
geological phenomena exhibited in this parish, we should be in- 
clined to give it as our opinion that there is but httle probability 
of coal being discovered, or at least, of its being found in such 
quantity as to repay the expense of working it. 

The sandstone formation is entirely covered with alluvial mat- 
ter to the depth of from 10 to 50 feet, consisting of gravel, sand, 
clay, &amp;c. with masses, large and small, of all the different rocks, 
but principally greywacke. Occasionally pieces of coal and granite 
are found. Peat occupies some hollows containing oak and fir of 
large dimensions. The soil of the hills which rests on the grey- 
wacke is generally a rich loam, but full of stones. Much of the 
rock is entirely uncovered. In other places large loose masses of 
it impede the cultivation of a deep soil. In some cases these have 
been broken up and removed at very great expense ; and so rich 
is the virgin soil, that above 100 Winchester bushels of oats have 



464 



DUMFRIES-SIllRR. 



been reaped on a single acre. The soil of the table-land is gra- 
velly or sandy ; in some rare instances, appi-oaching to clayey, and 
very stony. From the nature and depth of the alluvium on which 
It rests, it is much drier than the soil of the hills, and more to be 
depended on for a crop. It is so well adapted for barley, that that 
grain often attains the weight of 55 and sometimes of 58 lbs. per 
imperial bushel. 

Two hme-works are in active operation — one on the estate of 
Barjarg, the other on Porterstown. The lime is of a scorching 
quality, but for building and for manuring some kinds of land, it 
is frequently preferred to the milder lime of Closeburn. 

Zoology.— In a small loch, a quarter of a mile north-west of 
the church, leeches are found. They are used in the neighbour- 
hood, and sometimes sold. The kingfisher is often seen on the 
banks of the Scar. Foumarts are extremely abundant. Salmon 
begin to run up the rivers to spawn in the middle of November. 

5otoy.— According to Mr Rae, in the manse garden there 
was " a fine stock of Bryonia alba. But I know not if it be there 
now ; for the late Homer Grierson, chirurgeon-apothecary in Dum- 
fries, told me that he got of the roots of it several times for making 
that drug called FcBcula brijonice." The juice of Veronica becca- 
bunga, called wallink, is much used for the diseases of infants. 

Much natural wood, consisting of oak, ash, birch, and alder, in- 
tersects and adorns the lower grounds; and very extensive planta- 
tions have been formed of larch, fir, oak, and ash, all of which 
thrive well and promise to become very valuable. The sycamore 
grows with great rapidity. The most remarkable tree is the oak 
at Barjarg, in old title-deeds called the royal, the stag, or the 
blind oak. Mr Rae says it was called the deaf oak, " because 
if a person near it called to one on the other side he could not 
hear him." By a joiner's measurement it contains 520 feet of 
useful wood in the stem, and about 150 more in the branches. 
Others have calculated it, after a very careful measurement, when 
all the wood was taken into account, at above 800. Its stem is 
68 feet high, and since some decayed branches were lopped off, it 
is growing with great luxuriance. 

A silver fir, at the back of Barjarg House, brought upon car- 
riages from Tinwald when of considerable size, is now 91 feet

to the ground form a large tent. Of the six beautiful larches plant- 
ed by Lord Tinwald, the largest now measures, at 4§ feet high, 
8 feet 10 inches. In 1796, when sixty-five years old, it contained 
74 feet of timber — it now contains 190. 

II. — Civil History. 

An account of the parish will be found in Macfarlane's MS., 
preserved in the Advocates' Library. There are also in the li- 
brary of Barjarg, Notes for the History of the county of Dumfries, 
collected by the late F. H. Arundell, Esq. containing some no- 
tices of its history. 

" This paroch was anciently a pendicle of the Abbacy of Holy- 
wood, or as some say a viccaradge belonging to the paroch of 
Carlavrock, which was a parsonage belonging to the said abbacy, 
and so had at least a mediate dependence upon it. After the 
Reformation from Popery, the fews which us'd to be paid to the 
church, were gifted to the Earl of Morton ; but he having dis- 
oblig'd the Soveraign, they were afterwards disponed to the Earl 
of Nithsdale."— iae's Uistorij, MS. 

" Kire of old, a pendicle of the abbacy and part of the parish 
of Holywood, and since the Reformation served by a substitute 
who supplied both places in the absence of the minister, but late- 
ly divided from it and erected into a parish by itself, and after- 
wards annexed to the presbytery of Penpont." — Macfarlane MS. 

" It is not taxed in Bagimont's Roll, and therefore must have 
belonged to some monastery." 

" The estate and baillery of Porterstoun was a separate juris- 
diction till their final abolition, which the Douglases of Drum- 
lanrig had acquired in this parish." 

" Barndennoch is conjectured by Hornby to have been the 
Carbantorizum of Ptolemy." — Pennant's Tour. 

Land-oioners. — The heritors of the parish are the patron, 
the Duke of Buccleuch ; Sir Thomas Kirkpatrick, Bart, of Close- 
burn; James Hoggan, Esq. of Waterside; Godolphin Hunter 
Arundell, Esq. of Barjarg, now a minor ; and William Copland, 
Esq. of Blackwood. 

" The chief heritor of the parish was the Earl of Nithsdale till 
1702, when James Duke of Queensberry purchased the barony of 
Keir from William Earl of Nithsdale."

since that time increased the property which the Duke of Buc- 
cleuch now holds in three large divisions, separating the posses-- 
sions of the four other heritors, and forming nearly half the sur- 
face of the parish. Sir Thomas Kirkpatrick, Bart, of Close- 
burn, possesses the estate of Capenoch. It came into his family 
by the marriage of his grandfather with Susanna, daughter and 
heiress of James Grierson. This most ancient and distinguished 
family once possessed not only the estate of Closeburn, but a most 
extensive property in other parts of Nithsdale and in Annandale. 
Robert- Muir, now containing the Wanlockhead mines, belonged to 
them, and also the barony of Ross. Their earliest charter was 
granted by Alexander, King of Scots, in the eighteenth year of 
his reign, to Ivon Kirkpatrick, at which time they were a family 
of note. The part which Roger Kirkpatrick took in the death of 
the Red Comyn at Dumfries, February 10, 1306, is well known. 
" I'll mak sicker," the expression he used on that occasion, is still 
the family legend. From this time they held many of the high- 
est offices of trust and honour, and added greatly to their posses- 
sions. In 1438, Thomas Kirkpatrick of Closeburn was one of the 
conservators of the truce with England. Sir James, the father of 
the present representative of the family, before he sold the estate ■ 
of Closeburn, had opened the lime-works both on Closeburn and 
Keir, and was thus the originator of those improvements in agri- 
culture which have since advanced so rapidly in this neighbour- 
hood. 

The grandfather of the present proprietor of Waterside pur- 
chased the property from a family of the name of Orr, one of 
whom, Alexander Orr, minister of Hoddam, had in 1725 married 
Ag-nes Dalrymple of Waterside, one of the family who had long 
possessed it. 

Barjarg was in 1587 given by the Earl of Morton to Thomas 
Grierson, along with Penfillan and Penmurtie, which now belong 
to the Duke of Buccleuch. Mr C. Areskine, advocate, afterwards 
Lord Advocate and Lord Tinwald, married the heiress of this 
family and acquired the estate. Dr Hunter, Professor of Divini- 
ty in the University of Edinburgh, purchased it and left it to his 
son, W. F. Hunter, who assumed the name of Arundell. This 
gentleman, when he died in 1827, had made great progress in his 
preparations for a work on the history of the county. 

Blackwood was purchased from the Lady Indergellie by Wil- 
liam Copland, Esq. of Colliston, an ancestor of the present pro- 



KEIR.

prietor. The Griersons, to whom a great part of the parish at one 
time belonged, were of the family of Lag. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial register of baptisms, com- 
mences in April 1722, and has been kept to the present time with 
considerable regularity; that of marriages and deaths from 1721 
till 1791, and since 1826 ; session records, collections, and dis- 
bursements of poors' money, since 1692. 

Antiquities.— k chapel is reported to have stood on Kilbride 
hill ; and a cottage still remains, with walls about three feet thick, 
which is said to have been the manse. The position of the chapel 
is assigned to a spot on which the present farmer declares that he 
has often laid bare with the plough a piece of pavement composed 
of small stones, all of a size. A neighbouring patch of ground, on 
which the crops are always too luxuriant, is pointed out as the 
churchyard. A person lately dead used to tell that he had as- 
sisted in removing some of the grave-stones, and in collecting and 
burying scattered human bones. 

Close to where the parish church now is, on the south-east side, 
stood an upright stone, six feet high, surrounded by three or four 
flat ones. It had no inscription, and bore the name of " The 
Grey stane." At the head of the ravine, formed by the Glen Lacht, 
Cleugh House, or Barndennoch burn, lies a large stone, called 
" The Siller stane," near which were found several stone axes. 
Some persons once attempted to split it with gunpowder, but at 
the first blast so dreadful a storm came on that they fled in terror  
It is a boulder stone, of a highly crystalline texture, and principally 
composed of quartz and felspar. The piece which was blown off" 
emits a strong ringing sound when struck or trod on. At a mill 
which once existed near it, the laird of Glen Lacht paid no mul- 
ture, because the water came from his property. A stone, with 
the initials of James Renwick, on the ridge of Keir hill, above 
Staigholes, commemorates the place where he used to preach dur- 
ing the times of persecution. A small mound on the glebe is 
pointed out as the spot where the plague was buried. On the 
" Court Know" the neighbouring magistrates held a court. 

Modern Buildings. — These are Capenoch, Barjarg, and Black- 
wood Houses. There is a mill for grain. The common materials 
for building are the whinstone of the hills, and the red sandstone 
from Gateloch Bridge, four to six miles ofl; This latter stone is so 
extremely pervious to water, that it requires to be painted or tarred. 
Many of the cottages are roofed with it. The rest are thatched.

The sandstone of the parish having generally a deep cover is little 
used, except what is quarried along with the lime. The church 
was built from a quarry on Capenoch. 

III. — Population. 

According to the Macfarlane MSS. there were in 1728, 500 
examinable persons in the parish, which by the usual rules would 
give a population of JOG. Dr Webster's report gives 495. In 
1778, Mr Wallace found it to be only about 300. At the date of 
the last Statistical Account, it had risen to 520. In 1811, it was 
993; in 1821, it was 987; in 1831, 1804. The lime-works and 
the great improvements in agriculture, especially in fencing, drain- 
ing, and bringing waste land under tillage, have been the principal 
causes of the increase of population. 206 persons reside in vil- 
lages ; 878 in the country. 

For the last seven years the average of births lias been . . .28 

marriages, . . . . 7 

funerals, . . , J 7 

Of individuals or families of independent fortune there reside in 
the parish in summer 5, in winter 3. The proprietors of land 
of the yearly value of L. 50 and upwards are the five heritors. 

Of unmarried men, bachelors, and widowers, upwards of 50 years of age, there are 23 
women upwards of 45, . .... 43 

The number of families is 212. The average number of children to a marriage is 4 

There are of fatuous persons, 2 ; insane, 1 : deaf and dumb, 2. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — The arable land of the pa- 
rish amounts to 2700 acres Scotch statute measure ; meadow land 
about 600 ; pasture, 2096. Very little more is capable of being 
cultivated with profit. There are 538 acres of wood. The indi- 
genous trees are oak, ash, birch, and alder, and more sparingly 
elm, gean, holly, v/illow, and crab. The planted trees are larch, 
Scotch, spruce, and silver firs, ash, sycamore, oak, beech, elm, 
and more sparingly horse-chestnut, poplars of various kinds, labur- 
num, [Cytisus laburnum, and Cytisus alpinus, and birch. The 
greater part of the woods are well managed, but many of the plan- 
tations have not yet reached the productive state. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of arable land per Scotch 
statute acre is L. 1, 5s.; rent of grazing on hill-pasture, ox, L. 1 : 
sheep, 4s; low ground, milch cow, L.4 ; bullock, L.2, 10s.; sheep, 
10s. 

Rate of Labour, Sfc. — Ploughman, with bed and board, L. 12 per 
annum; woman servant, with ditto, L. 5. Day labourers. Is. 6d. 
per day; women, lOd; joiner and mason, 2s. 6d. ; tailor with food.

butter per stone imperial, 9s. 4d.; skim milk cheese, ditto, 3s. 6d. 

Live-Stock, Sj-c. There is nothing remarkable in the stock reared. 

The sheep on'the hills are the black-faced, on the low ground mugs. 
The cattle are generally the Galloway breed. A few Ayrshire cows 
have been introduced. The mode of husbandry is a six years' rota- 
tion; year, white crop, oats; 2d, potatoes, or turnip fed by sheep 
or raised for home feeding ; 3d, barley or rarely heat ; Ath, hay ; 
5th and 6th, pasture. The practice of leaving some of the fallow 
naked is fast falling into disuse since the introduction of bone 
manure. It was common very lately to have two white crops, wheat 
and barley, after fallow. Landlords are now restricting their tenants 
to one. Improvements might be made in a more thorough clean- 
ing of the land, a more careful selection of seed, in sheltering some 
farms by plantations, and in buying up the remaining multures. 

A great extent of waste land has been reclaimed, so that double 
the quantity is now under cultivation since Mr Wallace's Account 
in 1778, and the sheep walks are now confined to the wild and 
rocky summits of the hills. The great difficulties which lay in the 
way of these iniprovements, were the draining of boggy land, and 
the removal of great quantities of large stones. No irrigation of 
importance has been attempted. The embankments along the rivers 
are kept in the best state, and the bed of the Scar has lately been 
altered so as to confine its waters to one channel, instead of allow- 
ing them to wind through the adjacent holms of Closeburn, and 
injure much valuable land. 

The ordinary duration of leases is fifteen or nineteen years. From 
the circumstance of the year's crop belonging to the tenant who 
leaves a farm, and the new tenant having frequently to pay a whole 
year's rent before he reaps a crop, a large capital is required. But 
the leases are favourable to the tenant. Farm-buildings and en- 
closures are generally in a good state. On the Duke's farms they 
are almost all new, handsome, and commodious. 

Quarries. — In the two lime quarries, the cover is very great, and 
the superincumbent strata so little tenacious, that it requires all to 
be removed. The rock is consequently worked at very great ex- 
pense. The burning of it also is very costly, as all the fuel is 
brought from Sanquhar, a distance of fifteen miles. One bushel 
of coal is required for two and a-half of lime. The latter is 
sold at 6d. per Winchester bushel. 

Fisheries. — In former periods salmon were so abundant in those 



470 



DUMFRIES-SIllRE. 



parts of the Nith and of the Scar which bound the parish, that it was 
no unusual circumstance with a net to fill a common cart twice in a 
few hours after a flood. But so destructive have been the effects of 
poaching- in close time, that a tenant of the fishery where this used to 
happen, found himself a loser, while paying a rent of L. 1, 10s., 
and lately gave up his tack. 

Produce. — The average amount of raw produce yearly raised in 
the parish may be as follows : 

Grain with straw, - - L. 5450 

Green crop, - - _ 1827 

Hay, .... 17C0

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Towns, — The nearest is Dumfries, eight miles dis- 
tant from the foot and fifteen from the head of the parish. The 
villages in the parish are Keir Mill, and Barjarg. There is no 
post-office ; letters being brought by a runner from Thornhill, two 
miles from the head of the parish. There are eight and a-half 
miles of turnpike road ; seven on the road from Dumfries to Pen- 
pont ; one on that from Penpont to Glencairn ; and a-half on that 
from Dumfries to Thornhill, from the foot of the parish to Aid- 
girth bridge, on which the Edinburgh and Glasgow coaches travel. 

Five bridges connect the parish with the adjoining ones. They 
are all in good repair. A suspension bridge of a new construction 
has lately been erected by the Duke of Buccleuch over the Scar, 
at the manse, on the parish road to Thornhill. Its span is 1 10 feet. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is situated too near the up- 
per end of the parish, being only a mile and a quarter from 
Penpont, and six miles from the lower extremity. It was built 
in 1814, and is in good repair. It accommodates 440 per- 
sons. There are no free sittings ; the heritors assigning to their 
tenantry the space falling to their share over and above their own 
family seats. The manse was built in 1777, but received great ad- 
ditions and repairs in 1828. It contains three sitting-rooms and 
six bed-rooms, besides a large sunk story; — offering a singular con- 
trast to that described by Mr Rae in 1721. " It is a very handsome 
house, consisting of four fire-rooms, with cellar and closets, and 
offices conform." The glebe consists of ten acres, worth about 
L. 1 8 per annum. The stipend is fifteen chalders, half meal and half

barley. Converted into money on an average of the last eight 
years, the grain stipend paid by the Duke of Buccleuch, of about 
twelve chalders, amounts to L. 166, 14s. The money stipend by the 
four other heritors, who have surrendered their teinds, including 
the usual sum for communion elements, is L. 6 14s. 4d. ; total, 
L. 2-29, 8s. 4d. In 1728 the stipend was 650 merks, and three chal- 
ders of victual, two-thirds meal, one-third bear, besides thirty 
merks for communion elements. 

The heads of 6 families are attached to the Relief ; of 8 to the 
Secession; of 8 to the Reformed Presbytery; of 3 to the Romish 
church. All the remaining families, amounting to about 187, be- 
long to the Established church, and as many members of the other 
families have joined it, that part of the population connected with it 
may be stated at 1000. Divine worship is remarkably well attended. 
The average number of communicants is about 600. Those belong- 
ing to the parish are about 445. The sacrament, as in many of the 
neighbouring parishes, takes place in the open air. In consequence 
of its being the latest in the district, and celebrated in a spot of sin- 
gular beauty and adaptation for the purpose, it is attended by a 
very great number of people. The most perfect decorum, how- 
ever, is observed, and, were the weather more generally favourable, 
few would desire to exchange this " temple built by God" for one 
" made with hands." The average amount of contributions for 
religious purposes by subscriptions and collections in church, be- 
sides the usual collections for the poor, has for the last six years 
been L. 16. For the last nine years the average of church collec- 
tions for the poor has been L. 29, 2s. 

Education. — There are two parochial schools, in which are taught 
Greek and Latin, mensuration and mathematics. The school- 
masters' salaries are L. 25, 13s. 4d. each, and the school fees 
amount to about L. 30 more. Both school-houses and the house 
of one of the masters, were built by subscription, the other master's 
house by the master himself. The heritors have, however, granted 
a considerable additional and repairs for the upper school-house 
and school. The expense of education is, for English, 2s. per quar- 
ter ; do. and writing, 2s. 6d. ; do. do. and arithmetic, 3s. ; these 
and all other branches, 5s. The Kildare Street Society's Juvenile 
Library was lately gifted to the upper school by Mr John M'Mil- 
lan, now Rector of the Dumfries Academy, and a Sabbath school 
library has been procured by a collection in church and donations. 

Poor. — The average number of persons receiving aid from the 



472 



DUMFRlES-SIIIRr';. 



poors' fund is 10, at an average of 10s. per quarter. Occasional 
distress is also relieved. At present there are four orphan children 
belonging to the parish, boarded at L. 3, 10s. per annum. In addi- 
tion to the quarterly distributions, coals and clothes are given in 
cases of urgent necessity. The church collections for these pur- 
poses amount to L. 29, 2s. on an average of the last nine years ; 
during which time also a legacy of L. 25, left in 1827, by Mr 
Hunter Arundell of Barjarg, has been expended, and the he- 
ritors have twice of late given a voluntary contribution. At an 
annual spiel on the ice, as much is frequently collected from the 
players and spectators, as to purchase six or eight carts of coals, 
and twice that quantity when they are driven gratuitously. The 
good old Scottish love of independence and aversion to come on 
the poors' roll still exist in considerable force. Great efforts are 
often made by individuals to prevent themselves and relatives from 
becoming a burden on the parish. The kirk-session are extremely 
careful also to discourage all but the most necessitous applicants. 

Inns. — There are a small inn, an alehouse, and a dram-shop in 
the parish. 

Fuel. — Coal is brought from Sanquhar, fifteen miles, at 8s. per 
ten measures, or thirteen cwt. There is not much peat, and the 
wood is too expensive to burn. The decayed branches of the 
trees, however, and the loppings form a considerable item, are 
the fuel of some of the cottagers. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since the date of the last Statistical Account, vast improvements 
have taken place. The roads have been made, and are now kept 
in excellent order. All the small lochs and marshes have been 
drained, — the meadows and arable land doubled, — the rivers em- 
banked, — the sheep are now only half as numerous; but all other 
farm stock have greatly increased. The people in general, both 
farmers and cottagers, are much better lodged, their diet is improv- 
ed, and greater attention is paid to cleanliness and comfort.

<p>

PRESBYTERY OF PENPONT, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. ROBERT WILSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name of this parish, according to Chalmers in his 
Caledonia, was anciently written Tyndron; Tin-troyn, oxTin-droyn 
in the ancient British tongue, and Dun-ron in the Irish signify 
" the fortified hill with a nose." The name was applied to a round 
hill, which is still called the Dun or Doon of Tynron. 

Extent, Boundaries. — The length of this parish, according to Mr 
Crawford's measurement and the county plan, is 10 miles, and its 
breadth 3, which gives an area of 22 square miles, or 1 1, 332 Scots 
acres; but I am inclined to think that it cannot be less than 12 
miles in length, and about 2 in breadth. Upon consulting the 
plans of the different estates, to all of which I have had access, 
the real measurement is found to be 1 1,796 acres, 3 roods, 17 falls. 
Tynron is bounded on the north by Penpont; on the east by 
Keir ; on the south by Glencairn ; and on the west by Glencairn 
and Dairy. 

Topographical Appearances. — There are two ranges of hills in 
this parish, running from south-east to north-west. The one range 
terminates in the Doon of Tynron, and the other in the Doon of 
Maxwellton, in the parish of Glencairn. Lamgarroch and Cormil- 
ligan Bale are the highest of these hills, — which maybe about 1800 
feet above the level of the sea. The character of the hills is in 
accordance with the greywacke formation to which they belong, with 
the exception of Craigturrah and Croglin Craig, which are more 
precipitous. The climate upon the whole may be considered 
healthy. 

Hydrography. — The only rivers are the Shinnel and the Scar. 
The former divides the parish into nearly two equal parts. The 
other forms the boundary with Penpont for about three miles on 
the north. Both rivers run in a south-easterly direction ; but the 
Shinnel at the farm-house of Ford takes an easterly course until it 

DUMFRIES. H h

joins the Scar near the village of Penpont. There is a consider- 
able waterfall in the Shinnel, known by the name of Aird-linn, a 
short distance below the manse, — which is very picturesque in con- 
sequence of the banks of the river being richly wooded. 

Mineralogy. — The direction of the strata is generally from east 
to west, the dip inclining more or less to the south-east. The 
greywacke, which is the prevailing iock in this parish, contains 
a bed of clay-slate at Corfardine, which was at one time wrought 
by the Wanlockhead Mining Company, but has been abandon- 
ed from the inferior quahty of the slate. There is also a bed of 
flinty slate or Lydian stone at Shinnelhead. An attempt was 
made at one time upon the farm of Stenhouse, near the march 
of Dalmakerran, to find lead ; but it was soon abandoned, al- 
though some gentlemen from Wanlockhead thought it not un- 
hkely that lead might yet be found there. Granite or any of the 
primitive rocks have never been found in this parish, with the ex- 
ception of a small bed of disintegrated granite, which appears both 
on the estate of Landhall and on the Queensberry estate on the 
farm of Ford. The mica being of a very yellow colour, has been 
mistaken by inexperienced persons for gold. 

Botany. — No rare plants worthy of notice. The natural woods 
are, oak, ash, birch, plane, mountain-ash, alder, and willow. 
Those planted are generally Scotch fir, spruce, silver, larch, balm 
of Gilead ; and of late years, principally oak, and other hard woods 
mixed with the above varieties of fir. 

II. — Civil History. 
Land'Oioners. — The principal proprietor in the parish is His 
Grace the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry, who possesses 
nearly two-thirds of the whole parish. 

Parochial Registers. — The first entry in the parish register is 
dated 17th January 1742 ; but the register was not regularly kept 
until 1828. 

Historical Notices. — There was formerly a place of religious 
worship on the lands of Chapel, which are now united to the farm 
of Craigturrah; and another at Kirkconnel, which, like other places 
of the name, was dedicated to St Connel. The Doon of Tynron 
was formerly a place of strength, as the ditches on the side most 
difficult of access indicate. The foundations of an extensive build- 
ing might lately have been traced on the top of this hill ; and it 
is stated in Black's manuscript history of the Presbytery of Pen- 
pont, deposited in the Advocates' Library, that King Robert 
the Bruce, after the death of Cummin, was conducted to this as a 



TYNRON.

place of safety. " The steep hill says the author of the manu- 
script called the Dune, is of a considerable height, upon the top of 
which there has been some habitation or fort. There have been 
in ancient times, on all hands of it, very thick woods and great about 
that place, — which made it the more inaccessible, into which King 
Robert Bruce is said to have been conducted by Roger Kirkpatrick 
of Closeburn, after they had killed the Comyn at Dumfries, which 
is nine miles from this place, whereabout it is probable that he did 
abide some time hereafter; and it is reported, that, during his abode 
there, he did often divert to a poor man's cottage named Brownrig, 
situate in a small parcel of stoney ground encompassed with thick 
woods, where he was content sometimes with such mean accom- 
modation as the place could afford. The poor man's wife being 
advised to petition the King for somewhat, was so modest in her 
desires, that she sought no more than security for the croft in her 
husband's possession, and a liberty of pasturage for a very few 
cattle of different kinds on the hill and the rest of the bounds, of 
which privilege that ancient family by the injury of time hath a 
long time been, and is deprived, but the croft continues in the pos- 
session of the heirs and successors lineally descended from this 
Brownrig and his wife ; so that his family, being more ancient than 
rich, doth yet continue in the name, and, as they say, retain the 
old charter." 

Antiquities. — There are the remains of a Roman road leading 
from the Doon to Drumloff, and crossing the Shinnel above Sten- 
house, — along the line of which Roman urns have been found 
filled with calcined bones. A few silver coins were discovered con- 
cealed beneath some stones at Pingarie Craig, — principally of the 
reign of the Roberts, and coined at Edinburgh. Formerly, there 
were three Roman cairns in the parish, all of which were opened ; in 
the one at M' Question, which was the largest of the three, were found 
a stone coffin with fragments of bone, and a hammer made of stone ; 
in the one at Land, there were also found a stone coffin, with frag- 
ments of bone and a stone hammer; in the one at Pingarie, nine 
stone coffins were found, and fragments of bone, the whole of which, 
with the surrounding stones to the distance of some feet, were fused 
into one mass. The Rev. Peter Rae, in his manuscript history of 
the Presbytery of Penpont, mentions a fourth cairn. " I am in- 
formed, says he, that, in the Appin Hill, there is a high mount 
called Lamgarroch, upon the top of which there is a great cairn of

stones, under which it is reported one of the Kings of the Picts is 
buried." 

Ecclesiastical History. — The parish church is at present in a 
ruinous state ; but is to be rebuilt next spring. It was erected about 
the beginning of the eighteenth century. Nearly one-half of it 
was rebuilt in the year 1750, when a considerable portion of the 
freestone was taken from the ancient castle on the top of the Doon. 
Accordinsr to Chalmers and the Rev. Peter Rae, the church of 
Tynron belonged of old to the abbot and monks of Holywood, who 
enjoyed the rectorial tithes and revenues and the cure was served 
by a vicar. At the Reformation, the rectorial tithes of the church 
were let for the payment of only L.30 a-year. To the parish church 
of Tynron, there belonged lands of considerable extent, which, at 
the Reformation, passed into lay hands ; after the Reformation, the 
church, with its tithes, was vested in the King by the general an- 
nexation act. They were afterwards granted in 1618to John Mur- 
ray of Lochmaben, who was created Earl of Annandale in 1625, and 
died in 1 640. They were inherited by his son James, the second 
Earl of Annandale. The advowson of this church was afterwards 
acquired by William Duke of Queensberry, who died 1695. On 
the death of William the last Duke, in the year 1810, the pati'onage 
went to the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry, to whom it now 
belongs. In Mr Rae's manuscript account of the Presbytery of Pen- 
pont, I observeaRobertus Welsh, Canonicus et Vicarius de Tynron. 
" He was succeeded, observes Mr Rae, in that vicarage by Mr 
Taylor ; and the Reformation, or establishment of the Reformed 
Protestant religion in the Church of Scotland having taken place 
anno 1560, Mr Taylor renounced the Popish religion, and complied 
with the Reformation, wherefore he continued in the ministry of 
Tynron, and conformed to the act of Parliament made in the like 
cases. He enjoyed the kirk-lands during his hfe. Upon his conform - 
ing to the Protestant religion, he married and had children, and 
some of his posterity, as I am informed, are still livingin thatparish."

From 1811 to 1821, the decrease may be accounted for from a 
considerable portion of the land having been thrown out of cultiva- 
tion in consequence of the reduced price of produce. From 1821 
to the last census in 1831, it may be accounted for from the dif-

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — This parish contains 2455 acres, 2 I'oods, 35 falls 
of land, which have been cultivated ; and 8935 acres, 1 rood, 3 falls 
which have never been cultivated. To the ground already under 
tillage little more could be added with any prospect of remunera- 
tion to the farmer. The number of acres under wood is 405 acres, 
3 roods, 19 falls, the greater part of which is thriving natural wood. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of arable land in the parish 
may be stated as follows : — 250 acres at L. 1, 10s. per acre; 750 
at L,l per acre; 1455 at 12s. 6d. per acre; pasture land, 8935 at 
5s. per acre. The average rent of grazing bullocks during sum- 
mer may be estimated at L. 1, 5s. per head ; winter fodder for ditto, 
L. 1, 5s. ; expense during twelve months, L. 2, 10s. The average 
rent of grazing cows during the season may be stated at L.3, 10s. 
per head ; winter fodder for do. L. 2, 10s. ; expense during the 
season, L.6. The average rent of grazing ewes during the sea- 
son may be taken at 5s. per head. 

Rate of Wages. — The rate of wages during the year for men-ser- 
vants fit for all farm-work is from L. 10 to L. 13, besides victuals ; 
women, for the same period, from L. 4 to L. 6. For mowing, a 
man generally earns from Is. 6d. to Is. 8d. per day, besides food. 



478 



DUMKIllliS-SIUUK 



During the harvest, which generally lasts five weeks, men receive 
from L.2 to L. 2, 2s.j and women from L. 1, 8s. to L. I, 10s., and 
3s. 6d. a-week during hay harvest. For all other kinds of work 
during summer, such as hoeing turnips, 9d. a-day without food. 

Live Stock. — The common breeds of sheep in the parish are the 
Cheviot and Black-faced. The practice of crossing the Cheviot 
with the Leicester ram is now prevalent, and upon rich pastures 
may be considered as more remunerating to the farmer than the 
pure breed. However, this can never be advantageously carried 
to any great extent, as it would tend soon to diminish the pure 
breeds. The breeds of cattle are the Ayrshire and Galloway; 
but Highland cattle are grazed to a much greater extent than 
either. The usual mode of reclaiming waste land is by draining 
where necessary ; and on dry soils, ploughing during summer, lim- 
ing, and in the course of another year, ploughing, — taking one white 
crop, a crop of turnips planted with dung or bone manure, and 
feeding it off with sheep, — another white crop, and the ground sow- 
ed down for permanent pasture, with a sufficient quantity of rye- 
grass and clover seeds. But a shorter, more simple, and less ex- 
pensive process is, — two ploughings at those seasons of the year 
when they can be accomplished with the least possible interference 
with the other arrangements of the farmer, — lime during the spring 
or summer, — and without a single white crop, at once to sow down 
with rape, ryegrass, and clover, when in the course of two months 
the land becomes ready for pasturage. — Leases are generally for 
nineteen years. The farm-steadings in the parish were generally 
erected within the last ten years, and are good and substantial. The 
improvements in fences, planting, and breaking up of waste land 
were carried on to a great extent from the year 1800 to 1812. 
About that period, the greatest improvers in this parish were the 
late Alexander Smith, Esq. of Landhall; the late James M'Turk, 
Esq. of Stenhouse ; and the late William Smith, Esq. of M' Ques- 
tion. Now, the most liberal encouragement to improvement is 
given by His Grace the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry, as 
also by John Walker, Esq. of Crawfordton, the principal non-re- 
sident proprietors. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication. — Dumfries is the principal market- 
town, and sixteen miles distant. There is only one village in 
the parish. A daily post passes through it from Thornhill to 
Moniaive. The roads in the parish, fifteen miles in length, are

maintained by the statute labour funds, with the exception of one 
mile of turnpike. The bridges at Ford, Tynron Kirk, and Pin- 
garie, afford sufficient accommodation over the Shinnel ; and the 
one over the Scar near the junction of the Shinnel affords suffi- 
cient accommodation over that river ; they are all in good repair. 

Ecclesiastical State.— TXie situation of the church could not be 
better chosen for the accommodation of the people. It is distant 
from the north-west end of the parish about ten miles; but the pa- 
rish at that extremity is very thinly peopled. From the other ex- 
tremity it is distant about two and a-half miles. The present 
church has been found insufficient ; and a very handsome plan, fur- 
nished by Mr Burn of Edinburgh, to contain 314 sitters, has been 
contracted for, and is to be built next season at the expense of 
L. 975, — a sum, the liberality of whichj taking into consideration 
the small population, reflects the highest credit upon the heri- 
tors. 

My highly esteemed and much revered relative and friend, 
the late Rev. James Wilson, who preceded me in the pastoral of- 
fice here, in his Account of the parish in the former work, makes 
the following observations under the head of donations to the pa- 
rish and the poor : " The most remarkable donation that has 
been in the memory of the oldest man living, or indeed that ap- 
pears from any written documents, was made in the year 1754 
by Mr John Gibson, originally a native of the parish, and who 
in his younger years was rather in straitened circumstances. Some 
of his more wealthy friends, finding him possessed of a consider- 
able share of genius, and fond of cultivating and improving it, 
administered to him the means necessary for this end. After a 
short time successfully spent in attention to his studies, he issued 
forth into active life ; by the most perfect integrity of manners, and 
the most unwearied application to business, he increased both in 
reputation and wealth. In the latter part of his life he was mar- 
ried to a lady in London, by whom he had no children. He be- 
queathed to her all his property during her personal life, and after 
her death, which happened in the year 1762, L. 1500 was appoint- 
ed by will to descend to the Society for Propagating Christian 
Knowledge in Scotland. This Society, by their acceptance of 
this donation, bound themselves to pay annually to the parish of 
Tynron L. 35 Sterling, — L. 22 of this sum being paid by the trea- 
surer of said Society to a schoolmaster appointed by Mr Gibson's 
latter will to teach a school at or near Tynron Kirk ; the school-

master found qualified by the Presbytery of Pcnpont, and certified 
to be so, to instruct in the principles of the Christian religion, to 
teach to read and write well, to cast accounts, to sing psalms at 
church and in private families, and also to teach any other parts 
of learning as shall be thought proper, and to be elected to his of- 
fice by the minister and elders for the time being, and the heritors 
residing in the parish. The Presbytery examines the school an- 
nually, and upon their certificate of the schoolmaster's due elec- 
tion, diligence, and faithfulness in the discharge of his duty, he 
draws the salary above specified- The remaining L. 13, by the 
will of the donor, is appointed to be distributed annually by the 
kirk-session among twelve poor, sober, and industrious per- 
sons residing in the parish ; the value of L. 6 to be given them in 
flax, adjudging the value of 10s. to each, accompanied with 10s. in 
cash, — the last 20s. being still kept in the hands of the treasurer for 
the poor till the yarn spun from the flax is inspected by proper 
judges, at which time it is adjudged in different proportions to four 
or five of the best spinners among the twelve. This donation has 
an excellent effect in encouraging industry among the poorer class, 
at the same time that it greatly tends to relieve their wants. A 
strict attention has been paid hitherto in acting up to the will of 
the donor both in the letter and spirit. And every thing at pre- 
sent, both in respect of the school and the gift to the poor, is upon 
the best and most agreeable footing. A very commodious house 
of two stories in height, in pursuance of the suggestions of the do- 
nor, was raised in the year 1765, in the near neighbourhood of the 
parish church, by the late Duke of Queensberry, and another pub- 
lic-spirited heritor. One large apartment is used for the school- 
room, and the rest of the house appointed for the accommodation 
of the teacher." The school-room of the donation school here 
alluded to has been added to the dwelling-house of the teacher; 
and a large and excellent school-room has been built partly by the 
heritors, and partly by public subscription. It was evidently the 
intention of the benevolent founder of this school, that the salary 
should not only be equal but superior to that of any of the paro- 
chial schools, — which it certainly was at the time of its foundation ; 
but as the salaries of the parochial schools have been several times 
augmented since that period, they now exceed that of the schools 
in question. It is therefore to be hoped that the Society for Pro- 
pagating Christian Knowledge will, at no very distant period, see 
the propriety of granting a suitable augmentation. The manse

was built in tlie year 1785; and two additions have been built at 
different times,— which render it a comfortable and very connnodi- 
ous house. The extent of glebe, including houses and garden, is 
fourteen acres, three roods, which may be valued at L. 30 a-year. 
The stipend is 16 chalders, with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion ele- 
ments. Number of families attending the Established church, 73 ; 
number of persons, 246 ; number of families attending Dissentmg 
chapels, 28 ; number of persons attending the same, 67. Divme 
service at the Established church is tolerably well attended, more 
especially in summer. The average number of communicants in 
the Established church, 170. Average amount of church collec- 
tions about L. 15 a-year. 

Education.— There are two schools in the parish, the one paro- 
chial, the other endowed. The branches of education taught in 
both schools, are Latin, Greek, English, writing and arithmetic. 
Fees for Latin and Greek per quarter, 4s. ; English, 2s. ; writing 
and arithmetic, 2s. 6d. The parochial schoolmaster has L. 25, 
13s. 4d. of salary. He has a school-house, a comfortable dwelling- 
house, and one rood of good land. He does not receive more than 
L. 4 a-year of fees. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of persons receiving 
parochial aid varies according to circumstances ; but may be about 
20. The late Mr Wilson, in the former Statistical Account, says, 
" beside the weekly collections made for the poor, amounting to 
L. 11 or L. 12 annually, there is a small piece of landed property 
belonging to them yielding L. 7 of yearly rent. The number of 
poors' names on the roll is 12 or 14. They have a pretty com- 
fortable subsistence, and not one is known to go beyond the bounds 
of the parish as an itinerant beggar." Only one beggar is yet 
known to go beyond the bounds of the parish, and the farm of 
Cairney Croft, the landed property above alluded to, is now let for 
L. 20 of yearly rent. With regard to Cairney Croft, the Rev. Mr 
Rae makes the following remarks : " Brownrig of Cairney Croft, 
though this is but small, yet I thought fit to mention it because of 
its antiquity. It is reported that King Robert Bruce, being in the 
beginning of his reign in bad circumstances, in regard the most of 
.the gentry in the country having sworn fealty to King Edward 
Longshanks, had not yet joined him, — he came incognito in a 
morning to Cairney Croft, and asked Brownrig's wife if she could 
give iiim any meat, for he was very hungry ; to which she returned 
that she had nothing hut c/reddan meal and goat's milk, and he 



482 



DUMFIIIES-SIIIRE. 



replied that tliat was very good, whereupon she made him a grcd- 
dan, which he supped very pleasantly, and then told her that he 
was the King; and asked her what he should give her, to which she 
answered that they desired nothing but their own ground they pos- 
sessed, a sign she was not covetous, it being at this day but worth 
fifty merks per annum, and was no doubt of small value then, 
whereupon King Robert Bruce took parchment out of his pocket, 
and wrote a charter for the said land of Cairney Croft to the said 

Brownrig, his heirs and assignees. John Brownrig of Cairney 

Croft, lately deceased, told me that William Duke of Queensberry 
was once pursuing him for his land, upon which he went to Edin- 
burgh and consulted an advocate, who advised him to go home and 
search all his house, and bring him all papers he found in it; and 
that accordingly he returned, and noticing a bowell in the wall at 
the back of a bed which had not been opened for some ages, he 
opened the same, and found the said charter and some other papers, 
all which he carried into the advocate, who told him he needed not 
fear the pursuer, for he had as good a right to his land as the pur- 
suer had to his. The said John Brownrig told me further, that 
William Philip, factor to Sir Robert Grierson of Lag, then pro- 
prietor of the barony of Aird, within which bounds Cairney Croft 
lies, persuaded him to give up that old charter, and take a new 
one holding of Lag, which in his simplicity he did. This family 
were weavers from one generation to another, from King Robert 
Bruce his days till the death of the said John Brownrig, but his 

sons Simon and choosing rather to serve other men than to 

follow the occupation of their forefathers, have sold Cairney Croft 
to the kirk-session of Tynron." 

The annual amount of contributions for the poor, including Mr 
Gibson's mortification, may be stated at L. 50 a-year, and the an- 
nual distributions about the same sum.

PRESBYTERY OF LANGHOLM, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. JAMES DONALDSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Boundaries, Sfc. — There are two opinions with regard to 
the derivation of the name of this parish. The one traces it to 
the Saxon word Bie or By, signifying a habitation or station, — 
making the term thus denote " the residence of the Canons the 
other, to the Latin coenohium, which signifies a priory or monas- 
tery, and is a compound of the Greek adjective omc, common, and 
|S/og, life, because the monks lived in common. The latter opi- 
nion is supported by the circumstance, that a piece of land, grant- 
ed in donation to this priory, and specially designed in a charter 
confirmed by King WiUiam the Lion, in 1165,f is to the present 
day called Canonbie-holm, viz. the Priory-holm, as distinguishing it 
from Bee-holm, and Knotty-holm, which are in the immediate neigh- 
bourhood. 

This parish is bounded on the south-east by the Liddle, which 
divides it from Cumberland ; and on the north by Langholm. It 
extends 9 miles in length, in breadth 6, and contains 22,500 Scotch 
acres, or 36 1 square miles. 

Topographical Appearances. — The appearance of this parish is 
uneven, and diversified by a variety of ridges and flat ground, ex- 
cept the land which lies along the banks of the different rivers, 
which is generally level. Canonbie, therefore, may be regarded as 
the low grounds of Eskdale; for the highest grounds, which rise by 
degrees towards the east and north-east, cannot be called moun- 
tainous, when contrasted with the general appearance of the sur- 
rounding parishes of Langholm, Ewes, and Castleton. The cen- 
tral part of the parish is intersected by the river Esk; and the 
great post-road to the south by Carlisle passes in the same direc- 
tion, through a part of the country rich and variegated with woody

hills of aged oaks, pastoral scenes, and verdant fields, which never 
cease to attract and arrest the attention of travellers; indeed, it 
is upon the whole one of the most picturesque and lovely districts 
in Scotland. 

Soil. — The soil in this parish is various. Along the river Esk, is 
fine holm land of a light loam, exceedingly fertile, and well shelter- 
ed to the east and west by a considerable quantity of wood on the 
sloping grounds on each side of the river, the whole length of the 
parish from north to south. Upon this ground, crops of all kinds 
are highly productive, and early. On the banks of the Liddle, 
the soil is nearly of the same kind and quality as that along the 
Esk. On the higher grounds, the soil is cold, and of a wet clay 
mixed with moss, which, however, when properly limed, produces, 
in dry seasons, good crops of oats. From the recent improve- 
ments arising from draining and fencing, the greater part of this 
ground is now capable of carrying crops of all descriptions. 

Cliviate. — The climate of the parish is rather moist, and though 
we have very heavy falls of rain during the season, the atmosphere 
appears to be by no means injurious either to health or vegetation ; 
as there are a very considerable number of aged persons in the pa- 
rish, and vegetation is earlier than in any parish of Eskdale. The 
climate, however, varies very much in different situations. Along 
the whole extent of the Esk, in this parish, which, as we have men- 
tioned, is well sheltered on both sides, the air is found mild and tem- 
perate, even in severe seasons, — while, within the distance of two 
miles from that situation, it is keen and piercing. 

The diseases common in this parish are rheumatism, consump- 
tion, and those of a nervous kind, brought on by the moistness of 
the atmosphere. Scrofula, about forty years ago, was rather pre- 
valent, but, from care and attention with regard to matrimonial al- 
liances, is now nearly extinct. The prevailing winds and the heavi- 
est falls of rain are from the south-west. 

Hijdrography. — There are no lakes in the parish. The two 
principal rivers are the Esk and Liddle, the former having its 
source in the highest grounds of the parish of Eskdalemuir, and 
the latter in the extremity of the parish of Castleton. These 
rivers, after receiving in their different channels, which have nearly 
the same extent of twenty-four miles, a considerable number of 
tributary streams, fall into one another at the southmost part of 
this parish, when the Liddle loses its name and waters in the Esk, — 

" According to Colonel Mein's notes of the state of tlie weather for last year, rain 
fell more or less during 212 days. 



CANONBIE. 



485 



which, after running from the point of junction about seven miles 
in a south-west direction, falls into the Solway Frith. The banks 
of the Liddle, which, for the space of four or five miles, forms the 
boundary with England, are beautifully diversified with natural 
woods and thriving" plantations. Among the various interesting 
objects presented to our view on this river, Penton Linns is un- 
doubtedly the first. At this particular spot, the river is very much 
contracted by stupendous rocks, which rise abruptly on each side, 
and force the water into a broken narrow channel. There is a ter- 
race-walk along the ledge of this frightful and dangerous precipice 
on the Scottish side of the river, from which you see the waters dash- 
ing and boiling among the huge rocks that are scattered indiscri- 
minately below. The perpendicular precipices which narrow the 
bed of the river are overgrown with copsewood in every tint of fo- 
liage. In the centre of these scenes of sublimity, an isolated rock, 
which has braved the fury of the waters for ages, adds not a little 
to the prospect, particularly in a high flood, when its summit is 
only visible in the midst of the raging waters, surrounded by a few 
shrubs and bushes. Tarras, a small river which rises in the parish 
of Ewes, and divides on the north-east quarter this parish from 
Langholm, falls into the Esk three miles below the town of Lang- 
holm. This stream is remarkable for its rugged channel, roman- 
tic and picturesque scenery. It flows with so much rapidity through 
a narrow channel among immense masses of rock, and is so much 
broken by falls, that any person whom it may chance to sweep 
away, would be dashed to pieces before he could be drowned by 
its waters, which occasioned the following popular saying : 

Was ne'er ane drowned in Tarras, nor yet in doubt, 

For e'er tlie head can win down, the harns brains are out. 

Its banks are beautifully covered with trees ; and we may mention, 
that this small stream gave the title- of Earl to Walter Scott of 
Highchester, who married Lady Mary, eldest daughter of Francis 
Earl of Buccleuch. The patent bears date the 4th September 
1660. Besides these rivers which we have mentioned, there are 
a great many burns or rivulets, such as Archerbeck and Rowan- 
burn, both of which fall into the Liddle; the others scarcely de- 
mand our notice. Many of these burns afford excellent sport to 
the angler. 

Mineral Springs. — There are appearances of several chalybeate 
springs in various parts of this parish ; but the principal mineral 
well resorted to by invalids is that at Heathet, which is situated on 



DUMFRIES-SIIIRI':. 

the English side of the Liddle. This water lias been found of 
great advantage to persons labouring under scorbutic disorders and 
complaints of the stomach. 

There is also a celebrated petrifying spring near the river Tarras, 
the only one known in the whole range of the country. Mr Keir 
of Langholm, late factor to his Grace the Duke of Buccleuch, col- 
lected the petrifactions of moss, or fog, along the course of its stream, 
to the amount of several cart loads, which he caused to be burnt in 
the same way as hmestone, and found it to be excellent manure, 
and to produce nearly the same effects as lime does. 

Geoloffi/.— This parish abounds in coal, limestone, and freestone. 
The coal formation is found in hollows of the transition rocks. 
The sandstone rocks are very friable ; and those found in the coal 
depositions consist of spherical concretions, which are again com- 
posed of curved lamellar concretions. Slate-clay of a greyish- 
black and ash-grey colour, which contains numerous impressions 
of shells, and sometimes also of ferns, is found ; and clay-iron, in 
the form of spherical-shaped masses imbedded in slate clay, in the 
coal fields. Some of these spheres are from a few inches to three 
feet in diameter, and are exactly similar to those found in the coal 
fields of Mid-Lothian. 

The coal, which is worked at the two collieries of Archerbeck 
and Byreburn, appears generally to be intermediate between slate 
and pitch-coal, sometimes inclining more to the one, sometimes 
more to the other. The principal coal seam at Archerbeck, let 
to an English gentleman of the name of Lomax, is 5 feet 10 
inches thick ; and three yards below this, it is 3 feet 4 inches thick, 
and the coal is wrought by an open level. At Byreburn, it is 
wrought by a water engine upon a new construction, the invention 
of the late Mr Keir of Millholm. It is moved by means of a large 
bucket of a square form, suspended from the end of a lever, hav- 
ing a valve at bottom in the centre, which, by machinery, is made 
to shut and open in the instant of time the bucket should fill and 
empty itself. The other end of the lever is fixed to the pump, 
spear, or rod, and, by the continued action of the bucket descend- 
ing and ascending, filHng and emptying the water it contains, which 
is of such a weight as to make the beam preponderate, the pump- 
ing is carried on, and the coal pit cleared of the water collected 
below. Limestone is found in great abundance in different parts 
of this parish, but more particularly on the east side of the Esk. 
The lime burnt at Harelaw is in greatest request, both as yielding

the purest and whitest and the largest quantity of powder from the 
bushel of shells. The lime quarries at Harelawhill and Holhouse are 
easily wrought, and seem inexhaustible; and the country for thirty 
miles round is abundantly supplied at lOd. per imperial bushel, 
four of which will fill a single horse cart. The race of the fine 
mills lately erected at Hollows is cut through strata of blue lime- 
stone"; below which is a stratum of sandstone, schistus, and clay three 
feet thick, succeeded by a seam of coal four inches thick, which is 
presented at the mill sluice. On the west side of the Esk, near 
Hollows House Tower, a considerable body of shell limestone is 
found dipping south-east, and stretching towards Annandale, re- 
sembling the Kelhead and Arbigland rock. About forty yards 
above Blakebeck bridge are some thin strata of limestone dipping 
west one in four ; beyond this, a body of grey sandstone appears. 
About a mile from the foot of the burn, are strata of limestone; and 
a little higher up are strata of blaes, succeeded by a seam of coal 
about four inches thick. The bed of the Esk below Langholm 
low bridge is founded on the primitive rock ; from thence to a Httle 
below Canonbie it is occupied with the coal metals. From this 
point to the mouth of the river, the secondary strata of a reddish 
colour prevail. Freestone of various kinds is everywhere found in 
this parish, — which is well adapted for building, as being durable 
and easily wrought. It may be here mentioned, as a somewhat 
singular circumstance, that within the space of 200 yards in one 
particular place, coal and peat, limestone and freestone, may be 
digged. 

Zoology. — All the common birds are found in the extensive woods 
of this parish. 

Salmon, grilse, and sea-trout, previous to the building of a call 
by the late Dr Graham of Netherby, for the purpose of supplying 
his mills with water, were most abundant in the Esk and Liddle, 
and taken in vast numbers. On account of their run being inter- 
cepted, they are not now so plentiful, as it requires a considerable 
flood to enable them to get over this barricade. The whiten or 
herling {Salmo albus and the common trout are also abundant in 
these streams. Indeed the Esk trout and whitens are held in high 
estimation, on account of their delicate flavour. Tarras is also 
famous for its good bull-trout, according to the old rhyme, 

" And Tarras for a gude bull-trout, 

If it bu ta'cn in time." 

Botany. — In this parish, there are no very rare plants to be met

with ; though there is no parish in the district which abounds so 
much in woods. In the various plantations, oaks in particular are 
of large size, and seem well adapted for the soil. Planes, beeches, 
elms, firs of all kinds, ash and poplars grow rapidly, being pro- 
perly fenced and pruned. Around Hollows Tower, there are some 
large oaks and plane trees. A limited quantity of oak is annually 
cut down, which furnishes bark to the tanner, and wood for the va- 
rious purposes of the tenant. 

A variety of orchards were planted about forty-eight years ago, 
at the expense of the Duke of Buccleuch, upon such farms as were 
thought most favourably situated for the purpose. They have all 
turned out well, yielding a fair proportion of fruit of good quality, 
— particularly those at Woodhouselees, Forge, Rowanburn, Prior- 
liden, and the one at the manse. 

II. — Civil History. 

Land-oioners. — The Duke of Buccleuch is the sole proprietor 
of this parish ; and its valuation in merks Scotch, with half of Mor- 
ton annexed in 1703, is L. 7462, 6s. 8d. 

Eminent Men. — Among the men of former times, noted for 
their border exploits, we may mention, as a native of this parish, 
the celebrated Johnnie Armstrong of Gilnockie, a brother of the 
laird of Mangerton, chief of the name, whose place of residence 
was at the Hollows. Johnnie and all his retinue were con- 
demned and hanged upon growing trees at a place called Carlen- 
rig Chapel, about ten miles above Hawick, on the high road to 
Langholm, by James V. ; also William Armstrong, called Will of 
Kinmont, a descendant of Gilnockie; and Hector Armstrong, Hare- 
law, — whose exploits on the borders are well known. 

In more modern times, we cannot overlook, as natives of this pa- 
rish, the sons of the Rev. Mr Petrie, who died minister of Canon- 
bie, — four of whom, by their talents and industry, acquired splen- 
did fortunes. The eldest, Dr Robert Petrie, was an eminent phy- 
sician in Lincoln, and a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians 
at Edinburgh; the youngest, William Petrie, Esq. died second 
in Council at Madras, a man highly distinguished for his benevo- 
lence, and agreeable manners in private life, and for the great abili- 
ties with which he discharged the important duties of the public 
station which he filled. Dr Russell, author of the History of Mo- 
dern Europe, and the celebrated Benjamin Bell, Esq. surgeon, were 
also natives of this parish. 

Antiquities. — In this parish, which, from its locality, was more 



CANONBIE. 



489 



exposed than any other in the district to the plundering incursions 
of the English borderers, the inhabitants were by no- means in- 
attentive in erecting strongholds as places of defence and pro- 
tection against the visits of these ruthless marauders. In this pa- 
rish, therefore, many vestiges of these strongholds can be distinct- 
ly traced. As the most entire of the kind, we may take notice of 
the tower of Hollows, the residence of John Armstrong. It was 
situated near the eastward of Hollows Bridge, upon a situation, 
which, in natural beauty, cannot be equalled in Scotland. It is 
in the form of an oblong square, extending in front about 60 feet 
in length, and at each end of the squares about 46 ; the height 
may be estimated at nearly 72 feet. It has two round turrets with 
loop-holes at eadi of the east and west angles, and is built of red 
sandstone ; though now roofless, it must have been in former times 
a building of considerable strength. — At no great distance from 
Pen ton Linns, on the banks of the Liddle, was situated the strong 
tower of Harelaw, formerly the residence of Hector Armstrong, a 
famous freebooter. This was the Arm.strong, who, from bribes held 
out to him by Regent Murray, betrayed the Earl of Northumber- 
land into his hands, after he had fled to him for protection. In the 
year 1569, the Earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland, Rat- 
clifFe, brother of the Earl of Sussex, &amp;c. raised an army, and ten- 
dered their services to set at liberty from the power of her enemies, 
the unfortunate Queen Mary of Scotland, who was at the time a 
prisoner in England. They were unsuccessful in their attempt, 
and being forced to abandon their forces, fled to the Scottish bor- 
derers for protection. The Countess of Northumberland, the Earl 
of Westmoreland, and Ratcliff'e, remained with Scott of Branx- 
holm, and Kerr of Fairnihirst, till they were safely conveyed to 
the continent. The Earl of Northumberland, as already stated, 
took refuge with Hector of Harelaw, who treated him, for a con- 
siderable time, with every mark of confidence and regard; but 
these feelings gave way, and in the hopes of the large reward of- 
fered him by the Regent, he betrayed him into his hands, who car- 
ried him from Harelaw to Lochleven Castle, and who shortly after 
gave him up to Elizabeth, by whose orders he was executed. Arm- 
strong profited little by this base act of treachery, as he soon after 
fell mto poverty and disgrace, and his conduct became a proverb on 
the border, when a person betrayed his friend,—" that he had put 
on Hector of Harelaw's coat."— Besides the towers of Hollows and 
Harelaw, it appears from the remains that there had been one at

each of the Ibllowing places, viz. Mumbyhirst, A.uchoiireveck, Hall- 
green, Woodhouselees, and Sark, where Kiiimont Willie was buried. 

Priory. — The date of the charter confirmed by William the 
Lion in 1165, as mentioned in page 483, proves that this priory 
must have existed previous to that time ; but for how long a period, 
after much investigation, the writer has not been able to make out 
with any degree of certainty. Some vestiges of the convent are 
still to be seen at Halgreen, about half a-mile to the east of the 
church. From Halgreen, a private road is still kept open through 
enclosed fields to the church, confirmed by use and wont. In the 
year 1533, Henry VHI. claimed this monastery, as having belong- 
ed at one time, as well as the whole parish, to England ; and on this 
false pretence, ordered hostilities to be committed upon the Scot- 
tish borders. By some means, its destruction was not effected at 
this time by the English monarch, who would soon have expelled 
its pious inmates, and secured their I'evenues. In 1542, after the 
unfortunate surrender of the Scottish army at Solway Moss, the 
English soldiers pillaged and laid in ruins both the monastery and 
church. Some years ago, the chrismatory, a piece of singular and 
grotesque sculpture, was dug up in the church-yard, and is in the 
possession of the present incumbent. 

Roman Stations. — The remains of a Roman station are very vi- 
sible somewhat less than a mile to the east of Gilnockie, on the 
rising ground : it is evidently the first of the line of connection that 
was situated in Eskdale from the famous station at Netherby to 
Catle-over, or o'er, the upper camp, in the parish of Eskdalemuir, 
which is of the oval form. 

Coins. — A variety of Roman and English coins has been found 
in this parish at different times. The late clergyman, the Rev. John 
Russell, found an aureus denarius of the Emperor Nero, on a field 
in the glebe to the east of the church. A number of silver coins, 
which are in the possession of William Oliver, Esq. of Dinlabyre, 
were found on the 29th of October 1811, by a person who was em- 
ployed in draining some marshy ground near the place where the 
rivulet Rowanburn falls into the Liddle. They were coniained in an 
old purse, and some of them were remarkably entire. On one side 
is Civias London, the city of London, and on the reverse is Edwr. 
Anyl Dns. Hyh. a contraction for Eduardus, Anglise Dominus 
Hybernise, Edward Lord of England and Ireland. We can have 
no doubt that these coins are all of Edward I. of England,— because, 
if they had been coins of any of the other Edwards, some figure 



CANON BIE. 



491 



would have followed the name, as a part of the title of distinction 
of every king who comes after the first of the name. We may re- 
mark, that, during the reign of Edward L, there was a constant com- 
munication with Scotland, " the affairs of which," says Hume the 
historian, " form the most interesting period of his reign." From 
greal numbers of coins of the same kind being found in various parts 
of Annandale, particularly around the burgh of Lochmaben, we 
are of opinion that these coins were secreted in Canonbie and An- 
nandale, at the time when Warrenne, in 1298, marched an army of 
40,000 men into the latter district to re-establish the authority of 
Edward, which Wallace had for some time so nobly opposed. 

Modern Buildings. — Among these worthy of note, as held in 
feus from his Grace the Duke of Buccleuch, are, Woodhouselees, 
the occasional residence of George Bell, Esq. merchant, Leith ; 
Forge, that of Pultney Mein, Esq. ; Marsh House, of Colonel W. 
Mein; Crookholm, of Colonel N. Mein; and Woodslee, of George 
Scott Elliott, Esq. of Larriston. 

The corn-mills erected some years ago at Hollows are exten- 
sive buildings, and the machinery of the most approved kind. 
These mills are driven by a subterranean dam cut through the 
solid rock, and, by this means, have at all seasons of the year an 
abundant supply of water from the Esk, near the banks of which 
they are situated.

Character, Sfc. of the People.~The dispositions and habits of 
the people of this parish have undergone, within these last fifty years, 
a wonderful change for the better. At that period, much of the 
spirit of the borderers pervaded the inhabitants ; and gambling was 
carried on to such a degree that all industry was laid aside, so that 
many depended for their subsistence upon the precarious results 



492 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



arising from their success in horse-racing and cock-fighting, which 
tend more, perhaps, than any other hazardous games, to demorahze 
the people. Great praise is due to the then Duke of Buccleuch 
in bringing about this happy change. The great improvements 
carried on by his Grace in the parish gave constant employment 
both to artisans and labourers ; and as the Duke resided in the 
neighbourhood for some months during the busiest part of the 
year, and almost daily overlooked these improvements, he had an 
opportunity of knowing the character of each of the workmen, 
whom he encouraged and rewarded according to their industry ; 
and offenders not only lost employment, but were obliged to leave 
the parish. The tenants are a highly respectable, intelligent, and 
independent class of men, who spare no expense or trouble in the 
improvement either of their farms or of their stock. As masters, 
they are kind and indulgent to their servants, and set them an ex- 
ample, in their walk and conduct, of all that is religious and moral. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — 

This parish contains, in Scotch acres, 22,500 

Of which there arc cultivated, or occasionally in tillage, . 16,000 

In pasture, part of which may be cultivated, . . 5,500 

Under valuable wood and plantations, . . 1,000 

Rent of Land. — In a parish like this, where the soil is various, 
the rent per acre is regulated according to the quality. Some of 
the fine holm-land along the banks of the different rivers lets so 
high as L. 1, 10s. per acre ; and on the high grounds from 2s. 6d. 
to 10s. The grazing of a milk cow or full-grown ox for the year, 
L. 2, 10s. to L. 4, 10s., and of a sheep 5s. 

Live-Stock. — The common breed of sheep is the Cheviot, to 
the improvement of which the strictest attention is paid, — in select- 
ing stock of the largest bone and finest symmetry to breed from. 
Farmers on the lower and enclosed grounds rear a considerable 
number of what they call half-bred, by crossing the largest Che- 
viot ewes with a Leicestershire ram ; by which the size of the stock 
and quality of the wool are greatly improved. This stock is ge- 
nerally sold when lambs to English dealers. Betwixt 3000 and 
4000 sheep are pastured in this parish. The Galloway breed of 
cattle is preferred over the whole district, as the best adapted for 
the pasture grounds. They thrive well, rise to a good size, find 
a ready market, and bring a fair remunerating price. Some far- 
mers, however, in this parish rear considerable numbers of the 
Teeswater breed. Cows vary in price, according to age and con-

dition, from L. 6 to L. 12. Two year old stots the age at which 
they are generally sold bring from L. 5 to L. 8. Farm-horses, 
in good condition, may be purchased at from L. 18 to L. 30. 

A great number of swine are fed for the English market in this 
parish. Every cottager has his pig. 

Husbandry. — With regard to the state of husbandry in this pa- 
rish, when contrasted with that adopted fifty years ago, perhaps 
no parish in Scotland has been so much improved in appearance. 
Under the superintendence of the late Mr Keir, new roads were 
made, — farms laid out and enclosed where the plough had never 
before entered, — suitable dwelling-houses and offices were built, 
and slated at the Duke's expense, — and leases granted to the te- 
nants upon such terms as enabled them to carry on their improve- 
ments. All the modern improvements, therefore, in agriculture 
are introduced here, and carried forward with great spirit, as far 
as reclaiming waste land, draining, and enclosing can possibly go. 
The late James Bell, Esq. who possessed Woodhouselee, one of 
the largest farms in the parish, was amongst the first who set the 
example of improvement, and who, by his superior skill in farming- 
operations, brought his farm from a state of nature to the highest 
condition of cultivation. The late George Bell, Esq. sixty-five 
years ago, was the first who introduced the culture of turnips in 
this district, and the laying down of his grass fields with clover. 
Mr Church, Tower of Sark, a very enterprising farmer, has of late 
years improved a considerable extent of mossy ground by broad 
ploughing and liming, which now yields him good crops. Leases 
taken within these few years are commonly for nine or thirteen 
years. There are no obstacles to improvement in this parish aris- 
ing from the want of capital, or the want of encouragement by the 
noble proprietor. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Toivns. — Langholm, distant six miles from the church 
of Canonbie, is the post-town, and the nearest place where mar- 
kets are held. Markets are held also at Longtown and Carlisle, the 
former distant six miles, and the latter fifteen. Ready sales for cattle, 
pork, and land produce of every kind, are found at both places. 

Means of Communication.— In no parish in Scotland has so much 
been done to improve the means of communication as in Canonbie. 
About sixty years ago, every place out of the course of the river 
Esk was almost inaccessible, except during a very dry summer. 
Since that time, good roads have been made on the east and west 



494 



DUMFIllES-SllIIlE. 



Side of the parish, and branches carried from these to the princi- 
pal farm steadings in the parish. For making and keeping these 
roads in a state of repair, the Duke of Buccleuch, at the time, ap- 
propriated five per cent, out of the whole land rent of the parish, 
with L. 50 additional from his private purse. A half-penny was 
also levied at the different coal pits upon every horse load, equal 
to 2d. the cart load, — besides the conversion of the statute labour, 
which was altogether inadequate at the time to carry on these great 
improvements. The whole annual amount may have been at the 
time about L. 400. The funds arising from the toll-bar, placed ex- 
actly upon the side of the Scotch dike, went entirely towards the 
repair of the post-road. 

Bridges. — In this parish, there are ten bridges of one arch over 
the different rivulets, and a great number of smaller ones. Over 
the Esk there are two bridges, — one having three arches, and the 
other two ; the former, distant a mile and a-half from the latter, 
was built about ninety years ago at the expense of the county. 
The parishioners who lived to the west of the river had no ac- 
cess to the church or to the east side, before this bridge was 
built, except by wading or crossing on horseback, or in a boat, 
when the water was not fordable. The boat having been overset 
at one time, and several persons drowned returning from church, 
and many individuals having lost their lives after this catastrophe, 
the building of this bridge was at last executed. 

The other bridge was finished about forty-two years ago. It is 
built upon an extensive scale, and has a very striking appearance, 
which attracts even the attention of the most incurious traveller, 
who, if circumstances permit, halts to admire the beautiful scenery 
around him, — which, as far as wood and water, bank and brae go, 
is almost the finest landscape the imagination can paint. The 
span of the largest arch of this bridge is 70 feet, of the smaller 
one, 45 ; the height to the pass way 46 feet ; and the extreme 
length 244. This bridge has been of the utmost utility to the 
country, by opening up a ready and safe communication, as well 
as shortening the distance several miles in going and returning 
from his Grace's colliery at Byreburnfoot. The turnpike road 
takes also a new direction for a mile and a-half, by which means 
a pretty long and heavy pull, from north to south, on the old road, 
and also, the most exposed situation on the road between Lang- 
holm and Longtown, — are avoided. The road which leads 

4 



CANONUIE. 



4f5 



from the east end of the new towards the old bridge, is cut along 
the side of a steep bank, covered with wood, forming something in 
the shape of an amphitheatre ; at the sonth end of which, another 
bridge with two arches is built. These operations, for boldness 
of design, and from the labour and difficulty of execution, astonish 
every passenger. These works were finished at the Duke's pri- 
vate expense, and must have cost him many thousands of pounds. 
There is also a bridge erected lately over the Liddle above the 
Penton Linn, which opens a ready communication to England for 
the people of Liddesdale and the western part of Canonbie, which 
lies in that direction. 

The Edinburgh and Carlisle mail, besides stage-coaches to Lon- 
don and various parts of England, travel through this parish. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church of Canonbie was dedicated to 
St Martin, and, as it stood upon the banks of the Liddle, it was 
often called the church of Liddle. In the twelfth and thirteenth 
centuries, it was called both the church of Liddle and the church 
of St Martins. When the canonry was established in the twelfth 
century, it was called, " Domus de religiosis de Liddal," before it 
obtained the name of Canonbie, the canons' residence. In the 
reign of David I., one Turgot de Rossedale, who then occupied 
the district on the lower Esk, founded a canonry in connection with 
this church. He placed this canonry on the peninsula which is 
formed by the junction of the rivers Esk and Liddle, and granted 
to it the adjoining lands, with the church of Kirk- Andrews, and 
its pertinents. The words in the original grant are, " Ex dono 
Turg. de Rossedale domum religiosam de Lidle cum tota terra ei 
adjacente, ecclesiamque de Kirk- Andrews, cum omnibus ad illam 
pertinentibus." In the twelfth century, he gave it to the monks 
of Jedburgh. The church of Canonbie continued with the ca- 
nonry, which was a cell of Jedburgh, till the Reformation disunited 
and destroyed the whole. After the Reformation, the patronage 
and the tithes, with the whole property of the priory of Canonbie, 
were vested in the King by the general annexation act ; afterwards 
they were granted to the Earl of Home in 1606, which grant was ra- 
tified in Parliament in 1621,— when a stipend of 500 merks yearly 
was settled on the minister serving the cures of Canonbie and 
Wauchope, which had been united by the King's Commissioners. 
They afterwards passed to the Earl of Buccleuch in the reign of 
Charles I. Tlie Duke of Buccleuch is patron of the parish. 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



The present church, a handsome and elegant building, was 
erected in 1822, at an expense of L. 3000, and may contain 1000 
sitters. It is very centrical, and stands on the east side of the Esk, 
near the village, which is on the west side. The manse was re- 
built in 1800, and since that time has undergone some substantial 
repairs, along with the office-houses. The glebe consists of 20 
acres English of good arable land, including garden and office- 
houses. The stipend, according to last augmentation, dated 20th 
November 1822, is 16 chalders, half meal, half barley, payable 
according to the highest fiars of the county,— with L. 10 for com- 
munion elements. There are 516 families attending the Esta- 
blished church, and 68 famihes belonging to the Secession. There 
IS neither an Episcopalian family nor a Catholic one in the parish. 
The average number of communicants is 805. Collections are 
occasionally made for the General Assembly's Highland Schools 
and Indian Mission ; and there is a yearly subscription of one 
guinea to the Dumfries Royal Infirmary. 

Education.— ThQ number of schools in this parish, exclusive 
of Sabbath schools, is 5. The parish schoolmaster's salary is 
L. 31, 6s. 7d., with the legal accommodations. The teachers of 
the auxiliary, or, as they are called, side schools, are allowed as 
salary the sum of L. 5 each. These schools are placed at Glen- 
zier, Harelaw Hill, Hag, and Tail. The probable amount of fees 
actually paid to the principal schoolmaster may amount to L. 30, 
allowing 25 per cent, for irrecoverable debts,— with the additional 
emoluments arising from the offices of session-clerk and collector 
of the poors' rates. The branches taught in the public school 
are English, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, French, Greek, 
and Iatin. The charges per quarter for these branches are, 
English, reading, 2s. ; English and writing, 2s. 6d. ; arithme- 
tic, English grammar, and writing, 3s. 6d ; Greek and Latin, 5s. 
mathematics, 10s. 6d. j French, 7s. 6d.; and book-keeping a 
complete system, L. 1, Is. There is not a single individual be- 
twixt six and fifteen years of age unable to read. All the people 
appear very much alive to the benefits of education ; hence they 
would sooner deprive themselves of many of the necessaries of life 
than that their children should be unable to read and write. From 
the number of schools in this parish, and no part of it being so far 
distant from some of them as to prevent attendance, no additional 
schools are required. There is not a coal-miner's child above six

years of age who cannot read a little, and repeat many of the ques- 
tions in the Shorter and Mother's Catechisms. 

Library. — A Library was instituted in this parish in 1813. 
The annual contribution for the purchasing of books is the sum 
of 4s. 6d. exclusive of entry money. Though not numerous, the 
books are very select ; and the collection is under the best manage- 
ment. 

Charitable Institutions.— There are two Friendly Societies in 
the parish, which have considerable funds for the relief of sick 
members. They have been in existence for many years, and 
have afforded relief to many distressed members and poor widows. 

Savings Bank. — A Savings Bank was begun here sometime 
ago. As long as four per cent, was allowed upon the deposits, very 
considerable sums were lodged. Since the per centage was lowered, 
no money has been paid in for years, and the whole amount is 
withdrawn, except L 20 or L. 30. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid at the present time is 75 ; but occasional 
assistance is given to 25 others. The average sum allotted to 
each of those who are upon the poors' roll is about L. 1 per quar- 
ter. Poor rates were established in this parish in the year 1773, 
when the annual amount was only L. 54, 2s. ; which left a consi- 
derable surplus in the collector's hand, after affording the necessary 
relief to 24 persons, the whole poor then in the parish. At mar- 
tinmas 1793, the number of poor on the roll was 68, and the as- 
sessment for their support was L. 176 a year. Last year, the sum 
of L. 457, 15s. 8d. was distributed among the poor. Of this sum 
L. 408, 9s. 8d. was raised by assessment, at the rate of Is. 2d. per 
pound, the landlord paying one-half, and the tenant the other; 
from church collections, L. 27, 5s. ; from the use of a hearse, the 
property of the poor, and from fines for irregular marriages and 
immoral conduct, L. 21, 16s. We believe there is, with a few ex- 
ceptions, a disposition among the poor to refrain from seeking pa- 
rochial relief, which they consider as degrading. But, at the same 
time, it must be allowed, that this independent spirit is by no 
means so strong as it was forty years ago. 

Inns. — There is one principal inn in the parish, kept in the most 
orderly manner, where travellers meet with every accommodation 
and comfort ; also four alehouses in different places. These low 
tippling-houses produce the worst effects upon the morals of the 
people. It is much to be regretted that the Justices of Peace do 



" DnMPRIKS-SHIIlK. 

not refuse to grant licenses to toll-bar-keepers, two of whom in 
this parish sell ardent spirits. 

JW/.-This parish is most abundantly supplied with coal and 
peat, vvhich are procured at a very small expense; a single horse 
load of coal costs from 4s. to 4s. 6d., and one of peat from 8d to 
Is. accordmg to the distance. 

Miscellaneous Observations 
The crops in this parish are generally cut down with the sickle 
except on the farm of Woodhouselees. Mr Bell for many years 
has used the scythe ; and, from experience, has found that there is 
a great saving of expense, grain, and fodder. Mr Bell states, that 
two mowers, with one person to collect the sheaves to each, and a 
man to bind and stook, will do more work than twice the number 
with the sickle. This practice is gaining ground. 

In 1793, the rental of this parish did not much exceed L. 3000 
now it is L. 7462, 10s. ' 

The Duke has erected at his own expense kilns for making 
draining tiles, which he supphes to the tenants on their paying a 
per centage on the outlay. The Eskdale and Liddesdale Pasto- 
ral Society, which has its shows of stock for premiums, alternately 
at Langholm and Castletown, has been productive of the best ef- 
fects in improving the breed of every description of farm stock.

PRESBYTERY OF PENPONT, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. GEORGE SMITH, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — This parish is generally believed to have derived its 
name from a hanging bridge  Pendens pons J across the river Scarr, 
which separates one part of it from the adjoining parish of Tyn- 
ron. If this etymology should be thought to ascribe little ingenui- 
ty to the aboriginal inhabitants of the soil, it is not thus chargeable 
in respect of their posterity. If any one can believe that the pa - 
rish had no name until it was visited by the Romans, or that the 
name had then been changed, — or that it was ingeniously applied 
by the " masters of the world" from the peculiar structure of the 
bridge, — then to him the etymology will appear quite satisfactory. 
More probably, however, it is derived from the Celtic words Ben 
or Pen, signifying high, and Po7it, a sharp crag or pointed cliff. 
Any one acquainted with the parish, and the striking outhnes of 
the whole neighbourhood, will readily consider this to be the more 
rational etymology. 

Exte7it, Topographical Appearances, c— This parish is conti- 
guous to seven parishes, Tynron, Keir, Closeburn, Morton, Dur- 
risdeer, Sanquhar, and Dairy. It is probably, from one extreme 
point to another, somewhere about 18 miles in length; but the in- 
habited part is from 15 to 16. There are not above nine houses 
farther off than 7 or 8 miles from the parish church; and- the few, 
perhaps four, situated beyond 9 miles, are nearly in a line, indi- 
cated by the course of the Scarr. The parish is of an irregular 
form. The upper part of it is altogether pastoral, and diversified 
With numerous hills, varying perhaps from 500 to 1000 feet in 
height. Some of them around their bases are adorned with natu- 

Vj\2u latter idea has been suggested by tlmt accomplished scholar the Rev. John 
Wightman minister of Kirkmahoe. It has antiquity at least ou its side ; for wl e- 
ther we look to Glenqidiargan Craig as its name-fUthcr, or to any rugged clifVin he 
neighbourhood, the cliff was at least older than the bridge

ral copsewood, whilst their green summits are " clothed with 
flocks." Others are so rugged and precipitous, as in some degree 
to resemble the scenery of the Highlands. Glenquhargan Craig, 
situated about nine miles from the church, is frequently resorted to 
in summer by those who admire the wilder beauties of nature. 

It presents an irregular and precipitous front to the south and 
south-west. It is said to be 1000 feet in height, which, if un- 
derstood in reference to the level of the sea, may be not far from 
the truth. But if the height be taken from the adjoining valley, 
or the Scarr, which washes its base, it certainly does not appear to 
be underrated. The parish at this point may probably be from 3 
to 4 miles broad. These distances are not given with perfect pre- 
cision. But on the authority of an eminent surveyor, the parish is 
said to contain 3-2; square miles, and 20,640 English acres. 

The lower part of the parish is bounded very distinctly upon the 
west and south by the Scarr, which separates Penpont from Tyn- 
ron, for about five miles ; upon the south still by the Scarr, which 
separates it from Keir; and on the north or north-east for about three 
miles by the Nith, which separates it from Morton and Closeburn. 
Indeed, in consequence of a change in the channel both of the Nith 
and the Scarr, a small angle of the parish of Closeburn has been 
somewhat unceremoniously cut off from it, and in defiance of eccle- 
siastical statistics attached to Penpont. The Scarr rises near the 
extremity of the parish. Its course is marked by a hilly range on 
either side, extending from the north-west to the south-east, the one 
terminating in Glenquhargan Craig, the other on the south at 
Chanlock foot, in a beautiful round green hill, formerly covered 
with wood to the summit. When this hill is again planted, which, 
in the judicious and tasteful management of the estate to which it 
belongs, is about to take place, the landscape will bear to be com- 
pared to some of the most beautiful scenes in the Highlands. 

About the middle of the parish, a hilly ridge extends towards the 
north, which terminates in Cairnkinnow, a hill of gradual ascent, 
2080 feet above the level of the sea. On the north-east, for seve- 
ral miles, the parish is separated from the parish of Durrisdeer by 
the Mar or Park Burn, a small stream, which after adorning the 
policy and flower-gardens at Drumlanrig, falls into the Nith about a 
mile below the castle. 

The parish is generally of a hilly character, and, comparatively 
speaking, there is little flat or low-lying land in it. The land of 



\4 



PENPONT. 



501 



the latter description is chiefly to be found upon the sides of the 
rivers, or not far removed from their banks. The surface of the 
more hilly parts is not considered to present very interesting fea- 
tures to the geologist. There are two sandstone quarries in it, — 
one upon His Grace the Duke of Buccleuch's lands at Hillhead, 
the other on the estate of Lauderdale Maitland, Esq. of Eccles. 
In both, abundance of excellent materials might be found for build- 
ing; but they are not worked. The strata in both are nearly hori- 
zontal, or dip very slightly to the south-east. Detached pieces of 
lead ore have frequently been found in the parish. This may be 
of less consequence, however, — as, many years ago, it was brought 
thither in large quantities for the purpose of being smelted. At- 
tempts were at one time made to discover lead upon the Eccles 
estate, and, as is said, with reasonable hopes of success. These at- 
tempts, however, were interrupted by some legal proceedings re- 
specting the property, and they have never again been resumed. Of 
late, several pieces have been found in cutting a ditch along the 
public road leading from Penpont towards Sanquhar, about a mile 
from the village. One vein in particular has been discovered of a 
very promising character. It is said to resemble the veins that in- 
dicate lead at Wanlockhead and Lead-Hills, and to run precisely 
in the same direction, or nearly from south to north. Similar in- 
dications, it is thought, would be followed out with avidity by the 
miners in that quarter. And there is little doubt that here they 
will be thoroughly investigated. 

It is said that coal was at one time found accidentally upon the 
Eccles estate when the then proprietor was raising materials for 
building a wall round his garden. Yet no scientific attempts have 
ever been made with a view to ascertain to what these hopeful 
symptoms might lead. 

Hydrography, Sfc. — The river Scarr is one of the largest tributa- 
ries to the Nith, which it joins about three miles below the church 
of Penpont. It is a considerable stream, and at one time abounded 
greatly in trout. Its banks for probably seven miles are beautifully 
fringed with wood, — now rugged and precipitous, and again open- 
ing back into fertile valleys, presenting scenes of considerable va- 
riety and beauty. About half a mile from the village, toward the 
west, is the site of the bridge from which the parish is alleged to have 
derived its name. From its antiquity, its height, and the width of its 
span, it must have been an object of considerable curiosity. It was 



502 



DUMFRIRS-SIIIRE 



originally designed for people upon foof or on horseback. After- 
M'ards in 1724, it was widened to admit of carriages. But beintr 
still inconvenient, and probably insecure, it was taken down in ISOl" 
— andaconvenientand substantial bridge erected in itsplace. About 
half a-mile above this bridge, is Glenmarlin Pool, a rocky and nar- 
row pass in the river, where the stream descends with such rapidity, 
and its waters are so broken as at all times to present a scone of 
great interest. It is indeed not unworthy to be compared with the 
Rumbling Bridge, near Dunkeld, to which it bears some resem- 
blance. There are few more interesting rides in this part of the 
country than the road presents along the banks of the Scarr, as 
far as Glenquhargan Craig. From the rising ground in the vicinity 
of Arkland, the view of the valley, bounded by its wild or wooded 
hills, is remarkably sweet. And when the vista opens up with 
Chanlock foot in the distance, and apparently terminated by the 
round high hill behind, there are few scenes to be met with any 
where more picturesque. In summer, sea-trout are brought up by 
the heavy rains; and later in the season, salmon in considerable num- 
bers. The latter are unfortunately destroyed in close time, it may 
be said, almost without let or hinderance. The present state of the 
law, as it refers to the Nith and its tributary streams, is consider- 
ed by many to be injudicious. It closes the rivers as early as the 
25th of September, when the fish are in excellent order. The 
angler is then deprived of his recreation, which might with safety 
be extended for several weeks, and the fish are in fact preserved 
for those who are less scrupulous about legal prohibitions. On 
the other hand, the 1 0th of March is too early a period for 
opening the rivers, as many spawned fish are then taken when 
they are nearly useless, and of course before they had returned to 
the sea. 

II. — Civil History. 

Antiquities. — There is one obelisk in the parish, upon the pro- 
perty of Mr Maxwell of Bailford; but no account can be got of it, 
worthy of being recorded. It is a narrow pillar about ten feet in 
height, with two steps of a stair around its base, or forming the 
socket in which it stands. It is covered with a sort of character, 
now almost defaced. 

A somewhat curious tradition has come down to us regarding 
the stream that separates the parish from Durrisdeer, immediately 
opposite Drumlanrig Castle. It is expressed in a couplet, which 



PENPONT. 



503 



is ascribed to Thomas the Rhymer so far back as the thirteenth 
century. The words are, — 

" When the Park burn rins wliere never man saw, 
The Red-house of Hassock is near hand a fa'." 

In explanation of this prophetic couplet, it may be necessary to 
state, that the castle, which is built upon a piece of high table or 
flat land, in the gorge between two hills, must occupy the place of 
an older building of similar colour, to which the oracular prediction 
referred; for it is well known that the castle itself dates about four 
centuries later. It has various dates engraved on it, from 1675 to 
1688, and is the workmanship of Inigo Jones. The word Has- 
sock is said to be a corruption for " haus o't," signifying the throat 
or passage between the hills. It is said, likewise, that, in order to 
beautify the gardens with a cascade from the high ground behind, 
the course of this stream had been changed by Duke Charles of 
Queensberry ; whereupon, the prophecy was fulfilled by the pro- 
perty coming in the year 1810 into the possession of the family of 
Buccleuch. Another poet, however, and better known than Tho- 
mas, has attached some celebrity to this beautiful streamlet. For 
it was beside it where Burns wrote the fine song, beginning 

" Their groves o' sweet myrtles let foreign lands reckon." 

In the neighbourhood of Drumlanrig, there are still shewn the 
ruins of an ancient castle, called Tibbers Castle, and so called, it is 
thought, by one of the Roman generals, in honour of Tiberius Cajsar. 
The traces of this monument of antiquity are now nearly oblite- 
rated, — etiam periere ruince. In 1812, the lintels of a doorway were 
standing, and several steps of a winding staircase; but they have since 
been removed. From the niches then seen in the wall, it is con- 
jectured that the outer doorway had been hung, and drew up and was 
letdown, like a window, — while the inner apparently had been hing- 
ed. A labourer, who had been inadvertently allowed to pull down 
apart of the ruins, for the sake of the lime, found, about the door- 
way, various masses of lead, which might have been thrown upon 
assailants in a state of fusion, or may be supposed to have indicat- 
ed the fate of the building itself. He also found a number of ar- 
row heads, generally square and tapering to the point; a few were 
grooved out like the sides of a bayonet ; and all of them were of a 
dark blue colour. There were found, likewise, broken pieces of 
earthenware, lined with metal resembling copper, of the thickness 
of tea-chest lead ; and a spear head about two feet long, includ- 
mg socket, sharp-pointed and two-edged.

DUMFIUES-SHIRE. 



This castle is said to have been in the possession of the Eng- 
lish at the time of Sir William Wallace. It is said, likewise, that, 
having heard of the depredations which the garrison committed 
in the neighbourhood, Wallace was desirous to avenge the wrongs 
of his countrymen, and that, to accomplish his purpose, he prac- 
tised the following stratagem. Having observed a kiln smoking 
at Mallyford, a place in the immediate neighbourhood, and seen 
from the garrison, he hied thither in the morning, in the tattered 
garb of a mendicant, bent down with infirmities, and leaning upon a 
trusty staff. With the curiosity characteristic of his vocation, and 
on that account the more readily excused, he soon ascertained from 
the unsuspecting kilnman the strength of the garrison, and that he 
was engaged in drying grain for their use. Thereupon, he asks 
and obtains leave to prepare his breakfast, or to " roast a herring" 
at the kiln fire. And in return for this accommodation, he ao-reed 
to take charge of the kiln while the keeper was away for a similar 
purpose. As soon as he had gone, Wallace seized the moment, set 
the kiln on fire, and returned unperceived to a party of his men who 
lay in ambush in the Keely Cleugh, a woody dell near the castle. 
The flames in the meantime soon burst through the roof, and the 
garrison flew to save their grain. While they were engaged in ex- 
tinguishing the flames, Wallace and his party rushed to the gate, 
secured the drawbridge, and set the castle on fire. Whether this 
story be true or not, it is generally believed; but, unfortunately, 
the means of verifying, or of refuting it, are not at present with- 
in reach. 

Legend of the Dowloch. — There was a small loch in the parish, 
from about 70 yards in breadth to about 120 in length, near the 
summit of the hilly ridge about a mile to the south of Drumlanrig; 
but which, by draining, has been somewhat shorn of its fair pro- 
portions. It was called the Dow-Dhu or Black Loch, as the word 
signifies in Gaelic, and was reputed to possess extraordinary virtue 

 Though the parish may not be distinguished by any extraordinary individuals 
now living within its bounds, yet the inhabitants still cherish the remembrance of 
one remarkable for strength, and who died near the beginning of last century. This 
was the celebrated John M'Caul, or Strong Glenmannow, who occupied a farm of 
this name aboutamile from Glenquhargan, upon the banks of the Scarr. This indi- 
vidual is stated to have been tall and stoutly built, as, indeed, was evinced by the size 
of the bones brought to light on the opening of his grave. The late schooln.aster, 
who has deemed the feats of Glenmannow worthy of a place in the parochial register, 
remembered the opening of the grave, and his being struck with the sizeof the strong 
man's remains, particularly the skull. Whether all the anecdotes current are to be 
implicitly believed may perhaps admit of some doubt. lie died in 1705, at the age 
of eighty-four,

in the healing of diseases. It seems to have been looked upon as 
a perpetual Bethesda, for its waters were reputed to be efficacious 
in the cure of every disease, but especially of cattle subjected to the 
spells of witchcraft. It was not necessary that the person ailing 
should himself visit the loch. This might often have involved consi- 
derable hazard; and if the prudent alternative had not been adopted 
of employing a deputy, the number of cures consequent upon their 
use would probably have been considerably diminished. To accom- 
plish the end desired, however, the deputy was required to observe 
certain rules. He had to carry a part of the dress of the person 
ailing, or of the furniture of the animal bewitched, as an offering 
to the spirit of the loch. Whether any of the contingent virtue 
might not first accrue to the raiment from lustration in the loch, is 
not declared. But when the person had reached it, he had to 
draw water in a vessel, which was on no account to touch the ground, 
— to turn himself round with the sun, — and to throw his offering 
to the spirit over his left shoulder, — formalities all indicative of a 
Druidical origin, — and to carry the water, without having once look- 
ed back, to the sick person or animal, to be drank. All this, more- 
over, was to be done in absolute silence. Like the prophet's ser- 
vant, the messenger was to salute no one by the way. If, after an 
observance of this ritual to the very letter, expectations were some- 
times baulked, is it uncharitable to suppose that the temptation to 
violate the injunction of silence sometimes proved too strong for 
the virtue of the messenger  Whether the inefficacy of the water 
may be ascribed to any defect in the prescribed form or to another 
cause, it certainly is now of no longer avail even to cattle, unless, 
perhaps, to the fleecy flocks that pasture beside it. Yet it is not 
long since the virtue of Dowloch was put to the test, as indivi- 
duals are now alive of undoubted veracity and intelligence, who 
have seen the votive offerings floating on the lake, or scattere4 
around its banks. And to such a degree liad the habit prevailed in 
earlier times, that Mr Murray, the minister who lived till 1736, 
was regularly in the habit of debarring from the sacrament those 
who had engaged in the heathenish practice. 

The particulars of this somewhat curious history are partially 
confirmed and illustrated by an expression still to be met with in 
the neighbourhood, but at one time said to be proverbial. When- 
ever an mdividual did not return the usual civilities, on being met 
.upon the road, or who, when addressed, whether in the day time 
or under cloud of night, found it convenient to keep silence

the shrewd guess, that he " had been at the Dowloch," both sug- 
gested an excuse for taciturnity, and n reason for not farther at- 
tempting to break it. The medical faculty will learn no doubt 
with dismay, that the Noble proprietor is about to restore Dowloch 
to all its former glory ; some have hinted, for the less poetic pur- 
pose of accommodating wild -fowl. But if any one of that truly 
Noble house should ever stand in need of the charmed water, this 
much may be safely affirmed, that it were deeply to be deplored, 
if there were not at command greatly less questionable aid. 

Will it be thought to be beneath the dignity of Statistical lite- 
rature, to record matters of such questionable veracity, beside de- 
tails which are only valuable, if admitting of the most rigid scru- 
tiny  Perhaps the moralist will find an excuse, in the illustration 
they afford of the state of society, at a period not very remote from 
our own. 

Land-owners. — There are nine heritors in the parish who pay 
stipend. Of the whole valued rent, L. 6799, 8s., L. 5644, 8s. 4d. 
is attached to the property of his Grace the Duke of Buccleuch. 

Gardens at Drumlanrig Castle. — Drumlanrig Castle, his Grace's 
Dumfries-shire residence, stands at the extremity of the parish of 
Durrisdeer, and within a few hundred yards of the parish of Penpont. 
A part of the pleasure grounds attached, and the extensive new gar- 
dens, which were begun about six years ago, and are scarcely yet 
finished, are situated within the parish of Penpont. These, with the 
elegant cottage for the accommodation of the gardener, designed by 
Mr Burn, the architect, have been made at an expense of nearly 
L. 1 1,000. And the soilbeing excellent, and the whole establishment 
under the most judicious management, in a few years they will be as 
productive as any in Scotland. The position of the gardens, in point 
of taste, may perhaps be questioned; but no other locality held 
out the same advantages in point of soil, extent, aspect and shel- 
ter. The vegetable garden is four acres within the walls; and 
the quality of its productions not excelled by Covent Garden mar- 
ket itself. There are 600 feet of glass divided as follows : 100 
allotted to vinery ; 100 to peach-house ; 100 to Dutch peach-pit ; 
100 to pine stove ; 50 to succession pine-house ; 100 to forcing- 
frames, for melons, cucumbers, &amp;c. ; and 50 to an exotic stove. In 
these, excepting the forcing-frames, water is employed to produce 
the necessary degree of heat, and all the departments are kept in 
the most beautiful order. The exotic stove contains many of the 



PENPONT. 



507 



choicest varieties of the vegetable kingdom, particularly of the 
class OrchidecB, or tropical parasitic plants, which are found upon 
the bark of trees, rocks, &amp;c. in these warm regions ; such as, the 
Stanhopea insignis, Oncidium divaricatum, Cypripedium insigne, 
Catleya crispa, Rinanthera coccinea, or Chinese air plant, Epiden- 
dron cochleotum, Oncidium papilio, or butterfly plant, &amp;c. There 
are here likewise the Musa coccinea, Musa sapientum, Dendrobium 
Piei'ardi, Astrapcea WalUchii, or lightning plant, so called from the 
splendour of its flower.. On the back wall of the stove the Passi- 
fiora edulis fruits freely, as also in the pine-stove. There is, here, 
also, the Passijlora quadrangular is, and the Quisqualis Indica, which 
flowered beautifully in 1835. The Nepenthes distillatoria or pitch- 
er plant may likewise be mentioned, as also Dioncea muscipida, or 
Venus's fly-trap, Hybiscuss plendens, and the Cattleianum, which ' 
bears that luscious fruit of which Guava jelly is made. It fruits 
here readily. But it is impossible to specify all the attractions that 
are here presented to the botanist or the lover of the beauties of 
nature. It is only justice to the Noble proprietor to add, that every 
facility is afforded to strangers to gratify their curiosity here, or in 
the lovely flower gardens in the immediate vicinity of the castle. 

Parochial Registers. — Little authentic information can now be 
gathered regarding the ancient statistics of the parish. Unhappily a 
fire, which happened in the manse during the ministry of Mr Mur- 
ray, consumed the parochial records ; and those which exist com- 
mence only at 1728, and have been very irregularly kept. The first 
entry in the record of births and baptisms is of date 15th Novem- 
ber ] 728. With a view to the preservation and classification of 
the ancient parochial records of Scotland, the Presbytery of the 
bounds lately instituted an inquiry regarding the state of such do- 
cuments in every parish under their ecclesiastical superintendence ; 
and the following is extracted from the report of the committee 
relative to those of Penpont. " The register of births and baptisms 
is irregularly kept down to 1833. Since that period it has been 
kept regularly, as far as the children of parents who belong to the 
Establishment are concerned. Those parents who belong to other 
religious denominations seldom apply for registration. There is 
no record of marriages or of deaths." The extract abundantly shows 
the defective and utterly inadequate manner in which these records 
have been and still are kept. Similar defects and irregularities 
are very general; and it would be not unworthy of the Legislature 
to attempt a remedy.

III. — Population. 

Ill 1801, the population amounted to 90G, there being 453 males and 511 females 
1811, - - - 1016, - 478 - 538 

1821, - - - 1085, - 519 - 506 

1831, - - - 1232, . 573 - 659 

Of these there were, by the schoolmaster's memoranda, under 
fifteen years of age, 441 ; between fifteen and thirty, 347 ; between 
thirty and fifty, 268 ; between fifty and seventy, 145 ; and above 
seventy, 31. The yearly average of marriages may be stated on 
the same authority at 10. Neither the births nor the deaths can 
be given with perfect accuracy, for the reason assigned in the re- 
port formerly quoted. 

The population is scattered over the parish very irregularly. 
About 570 belong to the villages of Penpont, Burnhead, Townhead 
of Penpont, and Brierbush. Indeed, with the exception of Burn- 
head, which is within half a mile of the Nith, the other three may 
almost be considered as one village with its suburbs. There is a 
tendency in the village population somewhat to increase its rela- 
tive proportion to the country part of it. His Grace the Duke of 
Buccleuch is understood to be inclined rather to the system of hav- 
ing large farms, and of erecting substantial buildings with all ne- 
cessary and suitable accommodations, than of subdividing them, 
and having numerous cottars attached. Some cottages upon his 
estates, that had become ruinous, have not been rebuilt ; and of 
course, their former occupants have found their way into the vil- 
lages. 

The number of illegitimate children born within the last three 
years may be stated at 4. And it may likewise be of importance 
to state, that there are probably not more than three fatuous per- 
sons in a population of 1261. 

Language, Customs. — There can be no doubt that society here 
has made considerable progress in intelligence within the last forty 
years ; and that the language of the inhabitants has participated in 
the general improvement. Yet to one not a native of Nithsdale it 
perhaps would seem that modes of expression are employed indi- 
cative of greater antiquity than in the adjoining districts, — than in 
Ayrshire for example. One often hears, even from men of intel- 
ligence and education, of the Parochin of Penpont. And no mode 
of expression is more common than to use but for without. It 
would be injudicious, however, to record other peculiarities of idiom, 
which, in the rapid course of intellectual improvement in the pa- 
rish, may soon themselves become obsolete.

Customs still prevail here, which in a great measure are discon- 
tinued elsewhere. But, let it not be rashly spoken whether they 
are more honoured in the breach or the observance. Upon occa- 
sion of marriages, guests are frequently invited, greatly more nu- 
merous than the happy couple could afford to entertain. To ob- 
viate this inconvenience, a sum of money, varying according to cir- 
cumstances, is levied from the gentlemen. A sum equal to 1 s. 6d. 
from each will furnish music for the dance, and refreshments to 
exhilarate; and thus the wedding is celebrated by a numerous 
party, and tlte festivities go off with eclat. 

The funerals in the parish are often accompanied with greatly 
more expense than the relatives can aflFord, though considerable 
improvement in this respect has of late been effected. The good 
sense of the inhabitants is, of its own accord, gradually working 
out a cure. Would it be believed, that individuals in circumstances 
the reverse of affluent would incur expense, not only for things that 
are necessary or suitable for such solemnities, but even for show, 
to an extent which perhaps they may never be able to defray. Yet 
such things have been known. If such inability were occasioned 
by the unavoidable dispensations of Providence, and if such extra- 
vagance were incurred from a sacred regard to the dead, or a mis- 
taken desire to do honour to their remains, one would endeavour 
to probe this wound with all tenderness and delicacy. But if it 
proceed from a silly vanity, — from a desire to rival or excel others 
in expense, — regardless alike of the claims of justice and the calls 
of affection, — it can hardly be reprobated too severely. 

It would be altogether inexcusable to omit, under this head, the 
prowess of the parish in the national game of curling. It might, 
indeed, adopt the motto of the 2d Dragoons, better known by 
the name of the Scots Greys ; for every player must maintain that 
the parish is " second to none." And that the immortal Cairnie, 
in his elaborate treatise upon curling, should have omitted to do 
her justice, is one of those capital errors which perhaps cannot be 
satisfactorily explained. 

Character of the People. — The parish may be considered as en- 
tirely of an agricultural character. There are no manufactories with- 
in it, nor machinery, — except such as is employed for agricultural 
purposes. It is true there is the ordinary variety of crafts in the 
village ; but such trades are called into being by the exigencies of 
the farmer, and are dependent upon him for their existence. There 
arc likewise retail shops in abundance, — no fewer than eight. 



510 



DUMFRIES-SIllllE. 



There are also five inns,— enough, and more tlian enough, for 
the morals of the people. It is at same time true, that in gene- 
ral the people merit the character of sobriety. The farmers are 
intelligent, some of them remarkably so, while their servants, the 
shepherds, in the more pastoral parts of the parish, perhaps from 
the leisure they enjoy, and their distance from society, exhibit more 
information, particularly on matters connected with religion, than 
others who occupy a corresponding grade in society. The situa- 
tion of the lower classes ought to be unusually comfortable at pre- 
sent from the abundance of work, and the cheapness of provisions. 
If the calculation be a fair one, that the labourer is well provided 
when he can earn a peck or half a stone of meal in the day, he must 
be much better provided when he can earn double,— as is here often 
the case. The labourer's wages in winter are Is. 4d. ; in summer 
Is. 6d. sometimes Is. 8d. per day ; while the wright and mason con-, 
sider themselves entitled to 2s. The rate of labour varies less 
throughout the year than may seem altogether reasonable. But the 
wants of the labourer are even greater in winter than in summer, 
though his labour at this period cannot be so productive to his em- 
ployer. The wages of a man-servant may be stated at about L. 6 in 
the half year, while those of female servants vary from L. 2 to L. 3, 
or even L. 4. The food of this class of the inhabitants is plain, but 
substantial and nutritive. Oatmeal in the morning constitutes the 
regular food of the agricultural labourer; the same, or potatoes, in 
the evening; and generally they have broth with butcher meat of 
some kind, or cheese, to dinner. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — It is by no means an easy matter to give correct de- 
tails regarding the agriculture of the parish. The utmost, therefore, 
that can be offered, is only an approximation to the truth. It contains 
from thirty-five to forty farms of very varying extent ; and perhaps 
about an eighth of the whole surface might admit of being brought 
under tillage. This, however, could not be effected without great 
expense, and the land not already reclaimed is much more profit- 
ably occupied in the feeding of sheep. There are probably not 
more than two proprietors of land of the yearly value of L. 50 and 
upwards, resident upon their own lands in the parish. Extensive plan- 
tations have lately been made in it, of all the more common kinds of 
timber, which in a few years will greatly increase its beauty. Up- 
on the estate of the Duke of Buccleuch, the extensive plantations 
are rapidly increasing. Preparations are already made for plant- 



PENPONT. 



511 



ing about 150 acres, this season. In the higher and wilder dis- 
tricts of the parish, there is natural copsewood, chiefly of hazel, 
to a considerable extent, which, though unprofitable, adds much 
to the beauties of the landscape. The wood in the glens, and 
upon the rugged braes, is chiefly oak,— a species of wood, which, 
whether natural or planted, is admirably adapted to the soil. From 
the extent of wood in the parish,— the variety of hill and dale,— 
and the numerous streams with which it is intersected, there can 
be no doubt that, in a few years, it will be one of the most beauti- 
ful and romantic parishes, not only in Dumfries-shire, but in the 
lowlands of Scotland. 

Bent of Land.— there is no parish which presents a greater 
variety of prospect and of surface, so there is none where the land is 
of more varying value. In the holms upon the banks of the Nith, 
which for several years have been under the most judicious manage- 
ment, the value may not be considered too high, if estimated at 
L. -2, 10s. or L. 3 per acre ; and from this may be found land at 
every intermediate rate, to the lowest denomination of Sterling 
money. A cow's grass yearly may be said to run from L. 4 to L. 5, 
while that of an ox may be rated at L. 3. The wood that is em- 
ployed for agricultural implements may be purchased readily at 2s. 
per foot. 

Rate of Wages.~T\\e rates of wages are specified under the 
head Population. 

Husbandry. — The agriculture of the parish may be considered as 
steadily advancing. The farms upon the estate of the Duke of Buc- 
cleuch have been let last summer for nineteen years, upon terms fa- 
vourable to landlord and tenant. And the spirit of true liberality 
and encouragement with which the tenants are met in regard to 
enclosures, and reclaiming land by freeing it of stones, by liming, 
draining, or otherwise, — holds out the hope, that before the expiry 
of these leases, the estate will be most materially improved, and 
the tenants substantially benefited. Upon the part of the Queens- 
berry estate situated in the parish of Penpont, there are now erect- 
ing farm-houses and offices of the most substantial kind. When 
they are completed, no farmers in the kingdom will be more com- 
fortably, and few so elegantly accommodated. There can be little 
doubt of the wisdom of those extensive landed proprietors, who 
promote the substantial comfort, and thereby indirectly raise the 
character, of their tenantry. It would probably seem paradoxical 
to affirm that the house will aff"ect the character of its occupant. 



'' DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



But when agriculturists are raised from the status of serfs, or la- 
bourers, or middlemen, and enabled and accustomed to partici- 
pate in the substantial comforts, not to say the luxuries of civilized 
Ide,— independently of the feelings of respectful attachment which 
they cherish towards those through whom these are enjoyed,— there 
IS an interest created in the permanency of all those social arrange- 
ments, and of the very constitution of society by which, under Pro- 
vidence, they are guaranteed. If Sterne's theory be a sound 
one, that, in order to write hke a gentleman, it is necessary for the 
writer to put on clean linen and dress genteelly,_to give the agri- 
culturists all the accommodations, not of country squires, but of 
substantial, well-educated yeomen, leads not indirectly to create 
and to foster in them the same principles and feelings which cha- 
racterize the landlords themselves. 

The progress of improvement within a limited period has, per- 
haps, in no case been more strikingly exhibited than in the parish 
of Penpont. Districts of land, perhaps it would not be wide of 
the truth to say whole farms, may now be pointed out, that are 
three times more productive at present than they were thirty years 
ago. Turnip husbandry is gradually extending, and where the 
crop has been eaten off with sheep, the effects are abundantly visible 
in the following crop. Districts formerly unenclosed are now ju- 
diciously fenced, and a spirit of improvement everywhere manifest- 
ed by an enterprising tenantry. 

Perhaps in no respect would the parish as a whole be more be- 
nefited than by an extension of the roads in it. It may excite 
surprise to state, that, until this season, there cannot be said to 
have been a made or passable road for more than seven miles up 
the parish. It is hoped that, ere long, one may explore on horse - 
back the beauties of the most remote pastoral districts, with safe- 
ty and comfort. The turnpike roads, however, are excellent ; they 
extend to about eleven miles. The bridges, too, are in good order, 
except where the ledges have suffered through that wantonness said 
to be peculiar to Scotland. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Penpont is situated about fifteen miles from Dumfries, the county 
town. The post-office nearest it is in the village of Thornhill, 
distant about two miles. It enjoys, however, the benefit of a daily 
runner in his progress to and from Minnyhive. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is situated at the lower extre- 
mity of the parish, about 150 yards from the village. It was built 



PENPONT. 



513 



in 1782, and thorouohly repaired in 1834, at an expense of L. 240. 
A session-house was likewise added to it, with a new entrance to 
the church underneath, at a further expense of L. 100. The 
church is in the form common to the period in which it was huilt. 
It stands on three parts of a cross, one of which had at one time 
been built up, but is again opened and comfortably seated. It 
has a neat small gallery attached, which the Duke of Buccleuch 
erected at his own expense. The church is seated for 408, in- 
cluding the gallery, and has communion tables capable of contain- 
ing about 80 communicants. The communion cups bear the dates 
1363 and 1366 ; and it is worthy of being mentioned, that not till 
the year 1834 had the Lord's supper ever been dispensed in the 
church, the service previously having been conducted in the open 
air. The seats in the church are about to be legally divided. 
The consfreffation have hitherto been well accommodated, with- 
out being asked for a. farthing of rent by the heritors. Perhaps 
in no spot could the church have been placed more conveniently for 
the parishioners generally, — though one family attached to the Es- 
tablishment are fully fourteen miles away from it. The present 
incumbent, Mr Smith, was inducted in 1833, after having been 
several years minister of the second charge in Kilmarnock. 

There are other two places of worship in the parish besides the 
Established Church, — the one belonging to the Reformed Presby- 
tery, which was built in 1791, and is capable of containing about 
300 sitters; the other to the Relief, erected in the year 1800, and 
seated for 700. These congregations are supplied with ministers 
of great respectability. Mr Carmichael, of the Reformed Pres- 
bytery, has not yet been a twelvemonth ordained. Mr Dobbie, 
of the Relief, being somewhat advanced in life, is about to avail 
himself of the aid of an assistant and successor, a Mr John Smith, 
in whose favour a call has been very harmoniously moderated. It 
is no more than justice to these congregations to say, that indivi- 
duals belong to them as intelligent and as respectable as are any- 
where to be found in their sphere of life. And whatever asperity 
may have resulted elsewhere from discussions upon Establishments, 
now so rife, such discussions here have neither interrupted nor em- 
bittered the intercourse of social life. Mr Carmichael is allowed 
L. 100 a-year, and has a house and garden. Mr Dobbie, with si- 
milar advantages, has L. 125. Both congregations are in the ha- 
bit of giving from their funds to relievo the necessities of the poor 
who belong to them. Since Mr Smith's induction, he has been 



514 



DUMFRIES-SIIIIIE, 



in the habit of taking an ecclesiastical census annually when en- 
gaged in parochial visitation, with the view of ascertaining accu- 
rately the different denominations of professing Christians to which 
the inhabitants belong. In 1834, the number of famiHes where 
the heads belonged to the Relief was 79, and contained 347 souls ; 
the number of those belonging to the Reformed Presbytery, 48, 
containing 235 souls; of the Secession, 21, containing 109; and 
all the rest, including those who can scarcely be considered as at- 
tached to any religious denomination whatever, 110, attached, no- 
minally at least, to the establishment, and containing 570 souls. 
From a statement inserted in the parochial register about thirty- 
four years ago by Mr Hewetson, then schoolmaster of the parish, 
it appears that, so early as 1766, there were 16 famiHes that had 
separated from the EstabHshed Church, and in 1796 upwards of 
60. About the eid of the century, it is said that this number 
considerably increased. The same authority, of date 1802, states, 
that " the people in general have been of a religious cast of mind, 
being addicted to Puritan principles. But of late, from the great 
influence of itinerant preachers, they are more and more divided in 
their religious principles ; and being spht into four considerable 
factions, there is a foundation laid for religious squabbles and po- 
lemical controversy, which do not tend to the progress of true and 
genuine religion." 

The parochial stipend amounts to 16 chalders, half meal half 
barley, which in 1834 yielded L. 209 ; in 1835, L. 210. The 
manse underwent a thorough repair, and had a large addition made 
to it in 1833, at an expense, including a new steading of offices, of 
nearly L. 1100 ; and whatever may be thought of its appearance, 
there are few more convenient or more comfortable manses in Scot- 
land. It is situated about 100 yards from the church, the garden 
intervening. Both church and manse are about a similar distance 
from the Scarr, and stand on a level ground near a sloping bank, 
about forty-five feet above its level. From the situation of the manse, 
it was found impossible to supply water from within the glebe, and 
there seemed to be no other mode of obviating this great incon- 
venience, but by leading it in pipes from the high land behind. To 
this plan, however, the proprietor of the land was averse ; and in 
consequence, water had to be brought from another spring, at a dis- 
tance of about 1000 yards from the manse. The expense of this 
work, amounting to about L. 130, the Duke of Buccleuch defrayed 
individually; and it is not saying too much to add, that, in the pe- 



PENPONT. 



515 



culiar circumstances of the case, perhaps no other heritor in Scot- 
land would have acted with the like generosity. The glebe ex- 
tends to 13 acres— and in improving it and making a new garden, 
the minister has expended nearly L. 300. The heritors have 
erected a garden wall at an expense of about L. 100. Perhaps 
it may be added, that in a few years Penpont manse will be as de- 
lightfully situated as any in Scotland. 

Education. — There are four schools in the parish, two of them 
parochial and of course endowed ; the third, private, as such 
schools are termed, and unendowed ; and the fourth exclusively ap- 
propriated to females. They are all respectably taught. In one 
of the parochial schools, Greek and French are superadded to the 
ordinary branches. The salary of the one parochial schoolmaster 
is L. 29, 6s. 6|d., the other has L. 22. The one draws about 
L. 16, the other about L. 9 in school fees. One of them has a 
house and a small garden ; the other has only a house, and that 
of as comfortless a description as can well be imagined. The ex- 
pense of education per month may be considered as ranging from 
8d. to lOd. and Is. It is not believed that there are any persons in 
the parish between six and fifteen years of age who cannot read ; 
and if there be any, they are not more than one or two above fif- 
teen years of age, in this unhappy predicament. One of the pa- 
rochial schools is about five miles from the church, and on the whole 
is judiciously set down, for the district. Of course, there may be 
eight or ten farms with their cot-houses adjoining, that cannot be 
said to have the benefit of parochial school economy. But the evil 
is partly remedied, as in the Highlands, by itinerating teachers ; 
partly by intelligent parents themselves. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — There are 18 individuals, who 
singly, or as representing others, receive parochial aid. The ex- 
penditure for the year ending August 1835 was L. 59, 8s., so that 
the average sum may be stated as 5s. 6d. per month. This, how- 
ever, is not an exact average, as the number of children, and other 
modifying circumstances, cannot be minutely detailed. There are 
two sums, the one of L. 200, the other of L. 150, mortified for 
the benefit of the poor, the capital of which, it is understood, can- 
not be encroached upon. The yearly collections average L. 16 
per annum. The sums allowed to paupers here will seem large 
in comparison with those in other parts of the country,— a circum- 
stance which may be partially explained by the fact, that coal can- 
not be procured for less than from 7d. to 8d. per cwt. The aver- 



516 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



sion to receive parochial aid, at one time so beautifully characte- 
ristic of the independent and honourable character of the Scottish 
people, is, unhappily for the morals of the community, gradually 
diminishing. Individuals may yet be found who cannot brook the 
disgrace, as they consider it, of receiving parochial aid in regard to 
themselves. But this fine spirit is nearly extinct amongst those 
even from whom better things might have been expected, in re- 
gard to their collateral descendants. 

Within the last two or three years, three hiring markets have 
been held annually, on the third Tuesday of JVfarch for the summer 
half year; on the third Tuesday of June, for hay-making and har- 
vest work ; and on the third Tuesday of October, for hiring for the 
winter half year.

PRESBYTERY OF ANNAN, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. JAMES MONILAWS, MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Nam.e, Boundaries, Extent, 8j-c. — The parish and town of An- 
nan derive their name from that of the river by which the former 
is intersected, and on the east bank of which the latter is commo- 
diously situated, about a mile and a-half above its influx into the 
Sol way Frith. The etymology is dubious. Annan Amhann, 
however, in the Gaelic signifies loeak or slow-running water, — 
an appellation even now descriptive of a considerable part of its 
course, which has a fall of little more than a foot in the mile; but, 
at a distant period, when, as is generally supposed, it had flowed 
past Dalton and Denbie, emptying itself into the Frith at Pow- 
foot, before making its way through the rock at Dormont, the ap- 
pellation must have been still more appropriate, in as much as this 
tract, in which it is supposed to have formerly flowed, is nearly a 
dead level. 

 Professor Jameson, in his Mineralogical Description of Dunifries-sliirc, says 
" The valley of the Annan was probably at a former period a hollow in the transi- 
tion rocks, in which a river vastly greater than tlie irescnt flowed, but wliich, by llic 
deposition of floetz-trap rocks across its communication with the ocean, was convert- 
ed into an inland sea or lake," There are certain facts which render the latter part 



ANNAN. 



517 



Tlie parish is extremely irregular in shape. It extends upwards 
of 3 miles along the north shore of the Solway Frith ; whence, to 
its most northern boundary, being the extreme length, it is 8 miles. 
In breadth it varies from about 4 to 2 miles. It is bounded on 
the north by the parishes of Hoddam and Middlebie ; on the 
north-east, by Kirkpatrick-Fleming ; on the east, by Dornock ; on 
the south, by the Solway Frith ; and on the west, by Cummer- 
trees. Within the boundaries thus described, there is contained 
an area of 17 square miles, or 1 1,100 imperial acres. 

Topographical Appearances. — The surface of the parish is 
comparatively flat, having a gentle inchnation towards the south. 
Three parallel ridges of moderate height run through it in a north- 
east and south-west direction. Between the middle and western 
ridges, the Annan wends its way through scenery highly beautiful 
and picturesque. At the north termination of the western ridge, 
is situated the obtuse conical hill of Woodcock-air, rising to an 
elevation of about 320 feet above the level of the sea. Above the 
same level, Annan hill, close upon the shore of the Frith, is 256 
feet. Barnkirk hill, apparently about 120 feet above the level of 
the tide which washes its base, seems to have been the south-east 
termination of a range of little eminences, from thence extending 
into the parish of Tinwald; but which, along the coast, has, with 
the exception of the one mentioned, probably through the opera- 
tion of the waters of the frith, which at one time rose to a much 
greater height than they do at present, so far disappeared, that 
now its lineaments can little more than be traced. 

With the exception of the two last-mentioned hills, neither of 
which would be entitled to be so named, did they not possess a 
somewhat prominent appearance from the levelness of the adjacent 
country, the coast is flat and uninteresting. To the west of the An- 
nan, the shore is gravelly, to the east, one part is wholly sandy, 
while the other consists of a mixture of sand and gravel. The 

of this supposition highly probable. In the parish of Kirkmichael, there are at a 
short distance from the Annan, a Ross, signifying in the Gaelic a prommtonj ; and a 
C'amrue or Cumrue, signifying in the same tongue, tlie crooked proinoutory, — terms 
never applied to places except when bordering on a sea or lake. There is, moreover, 
laid down in Ptolemy's map of this country, a lake answering to the course of the 
Annan, and adjoining the position of the jilaces alluded to ; from which facts it would 
appear, that tlie situations of Ross and Cumuie must at one time have been appro- 
priately designated by the names which they continue to bear. 

• This hill, the property of Licut.-General Sharpe of Iloddam, is completely co- 
vered with wood, and was formerly a part of a forest of the same name, of which 
Edward III., in 1.334, appointed John de la Forest the bailiff. This office was 
heritably enjoyed by the Maxwell family in the reign of James VI. — Jnquisit.

subsoil is clayey. The only frequented harbour is Annan Water- 
foot, which is completely sheltered from the winds of the west and 
south-west by Barnkirk hill. 

Meteor ologij.— The temperature of the atmosphere is in gene- 
ral remarkably mild. In winter, the mercury on Fahrenheit's scale 
seldom falls below 35°, while commonly it is not observed so low 
by some degrees. In summer the mean heat ranges between 55° 
and 65°. Last summer the mercury, in the shade, rose so high 
as 80°

Although the rain which falls here is considerable, the climate 
is remarkable for its salubrity. 

Hydrography. — Rolling over a vast tract of sand and sand-banks, 
which, during the absence of the tide are exposed, the water of the 
Solway Frith possesses naturally in summer a higher, and in winter 
a lower degree of temperature than the water of the ocean ; and 
from the amazing rapidity with which it flows, it loses much of the

ANNAN. 



519 



clearness and purity which it possesses when issuing from the Irish 
sea. The colour to which, perhaps, it most nearly approaches, 
is Roman ochre. In ordinary tides, the depths of water in the chan- 
nel is about thirty feet, which gradually shallows to the shore. 

Spring water, purer or in greater abundance, is nowhere to be 
found thin in the town and througlvut the greater part of the 
parish. To this circumstance may in some degree be attributed 
the absence of prevalent diseases among the inhabitants. Chaly- 
beates abound, one of which, near the port, being a combination of 
alum and iron, somewhat similar to Hartfell Spa, at Moffat, has, 
with much beneBt, been made use of by those labouring under 
chronic complaints of the stomach. A very strong mineral spring 
was, in July last, discovered near Battlehill. It has not yet been 
analyzed. Hundreds of individuals daily resorted to it during the 
autumn ; and from the wonderful cures said to have been effected 
by means of its water, its fame has already spread considerably be- 
yond the bounds of Annandale. Should it continue to retain its 
present reputation, it would be of great importance to the place, 
because, being only a few hundred yards from the shore, there 
would be combined the advantages of a sea-bathing and a water- 
ing-place. 

Geology. — The rocks in this parish, and indeed those through- 
out the whole of the lower part of Annandale, belong to the inde- 
pendent coal formation. The secondary sandstone which pervades 
the parish, lies immediately under the soil, which in depth varies 
from a few to a considerable number of feet. The general stretch of 
the strata is from east to west, the depth of which varies from a few 
inches to several feet. The general inclination is towards the south ; 
and the dip eight inches and a-half in the foot. In texture, the 
rock is considerably fine, — weighing eleven imperial stones per cu- 
bic foot, — and well adapted for architectural purposes. Sometimes 
it contains mica in such quantity, that without difficulty it can be 
raised in thin sections, or flags, which are occasionally used in- 
stead of slate for the covering of houses. In the upper part of 
the parish, it occurs loosely aggregated, and easily friable. It 
assumes a variety of colours, such as reddish-brown, brick red, 
white, steel-gray, and yellow. Sometimes it is interspersed with 
spots of a mountain-green colour. Considerable fragments of

border forays, between the Scots and the English, in which the latter were wholly 
discomfited; their forces to a man, being either put to the sword, or in attempting 
to escape, drowned in the frith.

quartz occasionally occur in it ; and not unfrequently the surface 
of 'the uppermost stratum is found so completely imbedded with 
small fragments of flint, as effectually to resist the impression of 
the best tempered tool. In the north part of the parish, a large 
body of limestone is exposed. " It is covered by and alternates 
with sandstone. Beds of ironstone sometimes accompany the 
outer strata, and bituminous shale, with small seams of coal, some- 
times make their appearance either in the limestone quarries, or 
near to where the secondary strata terminate on the prinaary rock." 
Between the strata, which are from six inches to three feet thick, 
range from east to west and dip to the south, there are thin seams 
of clay of various colours. In the rock, there is found a variety of 
petrifactions, of which the species most frequently occurring are 
the milleporites and the ammonites. 

All geologists who have surve'yed the district are of opinion 
that abundance of coal may here be obtained, though at a very 
considerable depth, — the bed of sandstone rock lying above it be- 
ing extremely thick. Workable coal abounds on the opposite 
side of the frith, on both sides of which the superincumbent sand- 
stone belongs to the same formation. Several attempts have here 
been made to obtain this important material, but without success ; 
the obvious reason of which, however, seems to be, that the depth 
of bore, considering the thickness of the superincumbent rock, has 
been greatly short of that which would render success at all pro- 
bable. On the other side of the frith, the depth of descent be- 
fore workable coal is obtained, is in some places 108 fathoms, 
while here the greatest depth reached has not exceeded 150 
feet. 

Almost every variety of soil is to be met with in the parish, 
and that sometimes within a small compass. The lower ground 
along the banks of the river consists of alluvial depositions, and 
is very rich. To the west of the river, for a short way above 
its influx into the frith, the soil is clayey, having a substratum 
of strongly adhesive bluish clay, and loamy with a gravelly sub- 
soil. Northwards, on the same side of the river, it is mostly light 
and moorish. On the east side of the river, and to the south 
of the town, it is mostly loamy, with a sandy or gravelly bottom ; 
to the north of the town, it is generally light, the subsoil being a 
hard till ; to the north-east, east, and south-east of the town, it is 
almost wholly moorish and mossy, over the greater part of which a 
rough white stone prevails, a well-known indication of a naturally 



ANNAN. 521 

poor and barren soil, though not incapable of improvement and 
culture. 

A few boulders of sienite, of considerable size, occur in different 
parts of the parish. The nearest rocks of the same kind are those 
of Skiddaw in Cumberland, and Criflfel in Galloway, from either 
or both of which localities, they may have been conveyed to their 
present positions, by the irresistible force of the diluvial waters. 

Zoology. — The salmon,  the grilse, and the trout, f frequent 
the frith and river. In the frith, the sparling, the cod, the had- 
dock, and the sturgeon, the turbot, the sole, and the skate, occa- 
sionally make their appearance. The herling at one time fre- 
quented the frith in great numbers, but of late years has almost 
wholely deserted it. The salmon fry \ migrate to the sea, from 
the middle of April to the middle of May. The herling ascends 
the river from the beginning of July, till toward the end of Au- 
gust, and returns to the sea the following spring. The sea-trout 
commences running so early as April, becomes most plentiful in 
June, and descends the river in spring. The migrations of the 
grilse correspond exactly with those of the herling. The salmon 
continues to run from September till on towards Christmas, and 
returns to the sea in spring, — having completely deserted the river 
by the end of April. 

Botany. — There are but few, if any, very rare plants in the pa- 
rish, which, however, is no bad field for the young botanist. The 
earliest harbingers of spring along the banks of the river are 
the coltsfoot Tussilago farfara, and the common butter-bur 
Tussilago petasites, the former of which abounds also in the fields. 
Next to these in succession, come the wood -sorrel / Oxalis aceto- 
seUa,J the primrose f Primula veris, the dog's-violet  Viola ca- 
nina,J the wild hyacinth or harebell f Hyacinthus non scriptus, 

" A species of the salmon, here named the spring salmon, weighing from five to eio-ht 
pounds, and in which there is found neither milt nor roe, enters the river in the be- 
ginning of January, and there remains only a very short time. It is remarkably 
rich, and is sold at from 2s. to 3s. per lb. 

f A species of the trout, called the bull-trout, has here been taken at the weio-ht 
of 30 lbs., and has sometimes been palmed upon the market for salmon, from whi1:h, 
however, it is easily distinguished by the rounded shape and larger size of the head, 
besides cutting white. ' 

X The yellow-fin, here so named from the colour of its fins, weighing about a-third 
of a pound, and supposed to belong to tliesalt water, but respecting which extremely 
httlc IS here known, visits the lower part of the river from the middle of April till 
towards the end of May, for tlic purpose, as is conjectured, of conducting the red fry 
to the sea. When the fry in a body are leaving the river, the yellow-fin is observed 
recedmg them at a very siiort distance, or mingled with tiic foremost. It is never 
seen more than tiu ee or four nn'les up the river, in which it is not taken or observed 
except during the \m \od alluded to. " '

the wood anemone  Anemone nemorosaj which adorns the wood- 
lands on the banks of the Annan, in considerable profusion. Then, 
also, the rather uncommon Adoxa moschatellina is met with. 

In summer, besides the common plants, such as the purple fox- 
glove  Dif/italis purpurea, J the meadow-sweet f Spircea ulmaria, 
and the great wild valerian Valeriana officinalis, which, in pro- 
fusion, ornament the sides of the river, the rivulets, and the moist 
ditches, — there are to be seen among some of the hedges, in the im- 
mediate vicinity of the town, the elegant blossoms of the woody 
nightshade or bitter-sweet  Solanum dulcamara,  and the beauti- 
ful white blossoms of the great bind-weed  Convolvulus sepium. 
In the ditches, the ivy-leaved crowfoot Ranunculus hederaceus, 
and the great spear-wort  Ranunculus lingua, frequently occur. 
Along the banks of the river and the lesser streams, the water fig- 
wort  Scrophularia aquaiica is often met with. In the wood of 
Galabank, the showy-spreading bell-flower  Campanula latifolia J 
abounds, a few plants of which are also to be found in the wood of 
Craigdale. The Flora of the parish abounds with species of the 
St John's-wort Hypericum. The mountain-speedwell is plen- 
tiful in the woods of Dalebank. 

II. — Civil History. 
Historical Events. — From the absence of historical documents, 
it is impossible to ascertain at what period the town of Annan was 
founded. In the Old Statistical Account, it is stated that " An- 
nan was probably a Roman station, — that it appears to have been 
occupied by the Britons of the west, till they were subdued by the 
Anglo-Saxons of Northumberland, — and that, upon the overtlirow 
of that kingdom, it fell into the possession of the Scots, and was, 
from the reign of Malcolm Canmore down to that of William the 
Lion, reckoned one of the principal border ports." The statement 
which has been so often published, and the opinion which generally 
prevails, that Annan was constituted a royal burgh shortly after 
the accession of Bruce to the throne, appear to be founded merely 
on conjecture. During the many transfers of the lordship of An- 
nandale which took place after that event, it cannot be inferred, in 
any case, that Annan was regarded as a royal burgh. Besides, in 
a new charter the former one having been destroyed in the time 
of war, which was obtained from James VI. renewing and confirm- 
ing to the town its former privileges and immunities, it is distinct- 
ly mentioned, that, induced by the great privations to which the 
inhabitants had been subjected in protecting and defending the li- 



ANNAN. 



523 



berties of the Scottish border, James V. did, in 1538, erect the 
town of Annan into a free and royal burgh. 

From its vicinity to the Enghsh border, Annan was frequently 
pUmdered, burnt, and its inhabitants put to the sword, during the 
succession wars and the vexatious border forays. In the troublous 
year of 1298, when waste seems to have been the great object of 
war, the town and church were burnt by the English invaders. 
Two years after this, a castle was either built or repaired by Ro- 
bert Bruce, for the defence of the town, which he occasionally made 
his place of residence. To this castle it was, that Edward Baliol, 
in 1332, shortly after being crowned at Scone, had summoned the 
Scottish nobility of the west, to do him homage ; when Archibald 
Douglas collected at Moffat a body of 1000 horse, marched 
to Annan during the night, defeated and slew his guards, his 
brother Henry, and many more of those opposed to the in- 
tei-est of Bruce. Baliol, in the utmost alarm, and while half- 
naked, mounted a horse without saddle or bridle, and fled to 
Carlisle. There, he was kindly received by Lord Dacre, whose 
estates suffered severely for the reception given to the fugi- 
tive ; for Douglas immediately collecting an army of 3000 men, 
entered Cumberland, and ravaged and plundered a considerable 
part of the county, but particularly that belonging" to Lord Dacre. 
In 1547, Wharton, accompanied by the forfeited Lennox, during 
the protectorship of Somerset, made an inroad into Dumfries-shire, 
and in his way through the county, plundered and burned the town, 
after having met with an obstinate resistance from the inhabitants, 
who having fortified the church, the castle having been previous- 
ly demolished, baffled for a while the attempts of the assailants to 
overpower them. " The church of Annan," says Patten, the 
journalist of the incursion, " was a strong place, and very noisome 
to our men as they passed that way." 

In 1548 and 1549, the town and district continued to be 
harassed by the predatory incursions of the English border- 
ers. The Governor Maxwell, therefore, ordered a tax of 
L. 4000 to be levied on the prelates and clergy, for repairing 
the castle for the defence of the place against the oppressive ag- 
gressions of their " auld enemies of England." A treaty of peace 
was, soon after, concluded between the two kingdoms, yet the 
cessation of the barbarous system of predatory aggression was of 
' short continuance ; and on the arrival of 6000 French soldiers from 
Gascony in the Clyde, the Queen-Regent found it necessary to dis-

patch the greater part of them to Annan, to aid in the defence of 
the town, and the neighbouring district. In 1570 the castle was 
again demoHshed by an Enghsh army under the Earl of Sussex- 
It was afterwards rebuilt, and continued to be a border fortification, 
till the union of the crowns. At that time, the inhabitants were 
reduced to a state of very great destitution, and in a grant obtain- 
ed from Jaines VI. in 1609, it is stated, that owing to their being 
" so miserably impoverished" as to be unable to build a church, 
the castle was granted them for a place of worship. 

During the civil wars in the reign of Charles I., Annan suffered 
still more, and, as some compensation for the privations to which 
it had been subjected, the Restoration Parliament granted it the 
privilege of collecting customs and other aids. 

Nothing worthy of note seems to have occurred at Annan, from 
this period down to that of 1745, when the rebel forces, retreating 
before the Duke of Cumberland's army, lay encamped there dur- 
ing the night of the 20th December, after several hundreds of 
their number had been swept away by the current, when attempting 
to cross the rivers Eden and Esk. 

Eminent Men. — Dr Thomas Blacklock, a poet and a divine, 
was born at Annan in 1721. Though totally deprived of sight 
by the small-pox when a child, he was not deterred from prose- 
cuting his studies for the church, which he commenced at the 
age of twenty, and continued to pursue for ten years at the Uni- 
versity of Edinburgh. His acquirements in the Latin, Greek, and 
French languages were very considerable, — his knowledge of the 
sciences intimate, — and his attainments in poetry remarkable, con- 
sidering the disadvantages under which he laboured. A volume of 
poetry, and several theological productions composed by him, are 
printed. As a particular instance of his discernment, may be 
mentioned the circumstance of his having been the first to appre- 
ciate the poetical merits of Robert Burns. 

Here was brought up and educated the celebrated African tra- 
veller, Hugh Clapperton, whose dust now lies in the land which 
was the scene of his researches. 

Here too was born and brought up the Rev. Edward Irving, 
whose fate is still more a subject of melancholy regret. Posses- 
sed of a heart wedded to his sacred profession, and once of a mmd 
to whose vigour and capacity we presume not to assign a limit, he 
bade fair for becoming one of the brightest ornaments of our na- 
tional church. But, alas, " in the midst of his fame, delusion like 

4 



anman. 



525 



a summer cloud, overcame him." He now sleeps with his lathers : 
and sure we are there must be few, who will hesitate to say,— peace 
to the manes of Edward Irving. 

Land-oicners.— The principal land-owners in the parish are, Mr 
Irving- of Newbie; Mrs Dirom of Mount- Annan ; Mr Irving of 
Bonshaw; Mr Carruthers of Warmanbie ; the Earl of Mansfield; 
the Marquis of Queensberry; and General Sharpe of Hoddam. Mr 
Irving of Newbie possesses the largest rental, which is upwards of 
L. 2000 per annum. The others are ranged as above, according 
to the valued rent of their respective properties in the parish. The • 
number of small proprietors is very considerable. 

Parochial Registers. — The register of baptisms commenced in 
1703, that of marriages in 1764, neither of which were regularly 
kept till about thirty years ago. So imperfectly, indeed, had the 
register of marriages been kept for upwards of thirty years after its 
commencement, that the kirk-session, in 1797, found it necessary to 
resolve and enact, that in time coming it should be duly kept. 
An obituary has been punctually kept, for upwards of thirty years, 
by the parish sexton. 

Antiquities. — On an angled elevation on the east bank of the river, 
and west side of the town, was situated Annan Castle, the ruins of 
which, with the exception of a small part of the wall built intp the 
town-house, finally disappeared nearly forty years ago. A stone taken 
from the ruins, and built into the wall of a small vintage-house in a 
garden in the town, bears this inscription, " Robert De Brus Counte 
De Carricket Seniour De Val De Annand, 1300." Separated from 
the ancient site of the castle, now forming the old church-yard, by 
a sort of ravine, there is an artificial mound of considerable extent, 
designated the moat, supposed, like other places of the same 
name, to have been raised by the Saxons as a spot on which 
to assemble for the administration of justice. About half a-mile 
farther up the river, and on the same side, is an elevated bank, 
on which criminals or captives were executed, called Galabank 
or Gallow-bank, an evident contraction for Gallows-bank. A 
deep fosse or ditch, part of which remained open not many years 
ago, and which can still be easily traced, extended from this spot 
to Annan moss, skirting the town on the side nearest to the Eng- 
lish border. It was undoubtedly cast by the inhabitants of the 
town, for a means of defence. About two miles from Annan, and 
a few hundred yards to the north of the Carlisle road, there stood, 
not ma«y years ago, a rude sort of monument, erected in memory 



521 



DUMFRiES-SIIIRE. 



of the brave Scots who fell in a keenly contested and bloody en- 
gagement which there took place, and in which the English were 
routed with dreadful slaughter. There is a wall adjoining the spot 
in which the Scotch soldiers washed their swords after the battle, 
which, with the adjoining grounds, has ever since been designated 
" Szvord well." Among the English of note that then fell, were 
Sir Marmaduke Longdale, Sir Philip Musgrave, and Lord Howard, 
who were interred in the neighbouring church-yard of Dornock. A 
grave-stone, with an inscription which time has rendered incapable 
of being deciphered, covers the spot where they were laid. 

Modern Buildings.— On the eastern bank of the river, and near- 
ly two miles from the town, is situated the mansion-house of Mount- 
Annan, the residence of Mrs Dirom, widow of the late Lieut.- 
General Dirom, who, from the Christian benevolence of his cha- 
racter, the able and varied productions of his pen, and the im- 
portant improvements connected with agriculture he effected, was 
extensively known and deservedly esteemed. Placed on an ele- 
vated situation, Mount- Annan commands a prospect of the Solway 
Frith and northern counties of England so extensive and varied as 
comparatively few residences can boast of. The grounds around 
the house are tastefully wooded, and the scenery on the. banks of 
the Annan, which it overlooks, highly beautiful and picturesque. 

On the same side of the river, and about a quarter of a mile south 
of Mount Annan, is situated the handsome residence of Warman- 
bie, the property of A. Carruthers, Esq. This elegant edifice was 
erected by the present proprietor a few years ago. The grounds 
have been greatly improved, and are most tastefully laid out. — The 
situation of Northfield House, the seat of Miss Carruthers, about 
half a mile nearer the town than Warmanbie, and close upon the 
east bank of the river, though confined hi its prospect, is surpass- 
ingly beautiful. The house, whicii was lately enlarged, is very 
elegant. — The vicinity of the town is studded here and there 
with handsome houses and neat cottages, many of which, have been 
erected of late years. 

The town itself is well built, and the streets are capacious and 
generally well paved. The church and town-house are each adorn- 
ed with a handsome spire.  

» Since the above was written, Mrs Dirom of Mount-Annan has, with her usual 
benevolence, built a neat church at Bridekirk village for the benefit of the inhabitants 
and those of the adjoining district, who, especially in winter, are placed at an incon- 
venient distance from the parish church, — not to speak of the decided want of church 
accommodation there.

Character of the People. — The inhabitants of this burgh, and pa- 
rish are an active, enterprising, and intelligent class of people. 
The great increase of the population, which has more than doub- 
led within the present century, is a striking proof of their exertions 
in promoting the trade, manufactures, and rural economy of this 
portion of the south of Scotland, and the spirit of improvement 
is now as active, or more so than ever, since the introduction of 
steam navigation betwixt this port and Liverpool. Building is still 
going forward with great animation, and is aided by the abun- 
dant supply of materials in the immediate vicinity, or by wa- 
ter communication. The modern mansion-houses of the resident 
gentry, as well as the farm-houses, are now built in a more ele- 
gant and commodious form ; and the policies or pleasure grounds 
are equally tasteful and ornamental. Many charming villas or cot- 
tages are scattered around the burgh, which are much admired for 
their elegance and neatness, and the fine prospects which they 
command. Speculation here, as in many other places, may in a 
few instances have been pushed too far, or in advance of even the 
present rapid rate of improvements ; but where this has occasionally 
appeared, the consequences may prove a warning against the like 
imprudence. From the keenness of competition displayed in this 
burgh, there are certainly at present too many candidates for pub- 
lic favour in the market, and, as it is observed in other markets 
where the supply exceeds the demand, the profits must be redu- 
ced to the minimum value, or the stockholder sell with a loss. 
These things will no doubt rectify themselves in the end. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The number of acres in the parish, as it stood 
before the separation of Brydekirk, was 11,000 or thereby. 
Of these nearly 10,000 acres were under cultivation or laid 
down in permanent pasture, the remainder being occupied with 



528 



DUMFUlES-SHlllE. 



woods and plantations, moors, and waste ground, &amp;c. A large 
tract of ground in the vicinity of the burgh to the north-east, and 
extending at one time to nearly 2000 acres, was formerly a com- 
mon bleak moor, but was divided about thirty-five years ago among 
the burghers and adjoining heritors. Before this took place, it 
afforded only a scanty pasturage for cattle and horses belonging 
to the burghers, and was greatly impoverished by the practice of 
cutting feal or divot for the common behoof. It is now divided 
and subdivided by hedge and ditch, and a considerable portion of 
the most elevated parts are covered with thriving plantations. 
The fields are well cultivated and improved, with neat cottages 
interspersed, built with stone and lime, and roofed or covered with 
slate. To accommodate these cottages, or small farms, cross 
roads are formed from the public roads leading from the burgh to 
Langholm and Cannobie, by Kirtlebridge and Kilpatrick Church. 
It is calculated that there are now in the parish about 10,087 
acres under cultivation, or laid down in permanent pasture. The 
average of which being taken at from 10s. to L. 4 per acre, may 
be calculated at L. 1, 14s. 4d., giving nearly L. 17,232, 13s. 8d. in 
whole. The arable land where not laid down in pasture is kept 
under a regular course of cropping, according to the most approv- 
ed practice of the neighbouring parishes. 

The kind of stock generally reared here is the common Gal- 
loway or polled breed, with occasionally a few of the short-horned 
and Ayrshire breeds. The number of sheep kept within the pa- 
rish is small, as there are no ranges of any extent for sheep pas- 
tures. The rates charged for grazing of cattle vary from the 
quality of the pasture, and their proximity to the burgh. The 
rearing and feeding of hogs is apart of rural economy now univer- 
sally pursued throughout Annandale by the farmers and cottagers, 
and has become a source of no small profit to the country, and of 
ample remuneration to those by whom it has been adopted. 

Manufactures. — A cotton manuftictory for spinning of yarn was 
established here in the year 1785, and the building and machi- 
nery have been considerably enlarged since. The number of per- 
sons at present engaged in the work may vary from 120 to 140 
hands, and the quantity of manufactured goods produced weekly 
is 4000 pounds on an average, or upwards of 92 tons weight of 
mule jenny yarn. The work is carried on by Mr Douglas, from 
Manchester. 

Fisheries. — There are two fisheries carried on here, one of tiiem 



ANNAN. 



529 



on the coast on the west side of the Annan, belonging to Mr Ir- 
vhig of Newbie, which is let to a tacksman at present for L. 350 
peiannum. The other belongs to the burgh, on the coast to the 
east of the town at Seafield, on lease at L. 200 a-year. Both 
these fisheries were very productive, last season affording a good 
return to the tacksman. 

Trade and Skipping.— The trade and shipping of the port of 
Annan, which is formed by a creek of the Solway Frith at the 
mouth of the river, is mostly engaged in the importation from Ame- 
rica and the Baltic, of timber, deals, lathwood, and tar. Four 
cargoes from America and two from Memel have been imported 
this year. From the regular communication by steam packets 
from Liverpool to Annan Waterfoot, the greatest part of the 
merchant goods are conveyed to this place, and grain, wool, live- 
stock, bacon, and hams, and other produce of the country, besides 
passengers, are shipped on board these vessels in return, for the 
Liverpool market, and the adjacent manufacturing towns in Lan- 
cashire. There are, at present, thirty- four vessels belonging to 
Annan in employment. Two of these are engaged in the foreign 
trade ; thirty are employed in the coasting trade of Great Britain 
and Ireland ; and two are pleasure yachts. The whole are regis- 
tered at 1639 tons burthen. 

The imports coastwise here, exclusive of what is carried on by 
the steam packets, are, coals, slates, salt, iron, herrings, and grain, 
and sundry other merchant goods from Glasgow, and other ports 
on the coasts of England and Ireland. The exports coastwise, 
exclusive of the steamers, are very trifling,, with the exception of 
a few cargoes of grain, shipped for the Liverpool and Glasgow 
markets, or a few loads of timber and freestone for other ports in 
England. The navigation of the Solway Frith is attended with 
considerable danger and difficulty, occasioned by the frequent 
changes in the course of the channel, from the shifting of the sand- 
banks, &amp;c. The port oF Annan, as stated above, is formed by the 
creek or inlet to the river, which has been rendered more con- 
venient for the shipping trading in the Solway Frith, by the em- 
bankment of a piece of carse ground of considerable extent, called 
Hallmcadow, a part of the Newbie estate, the property of John 
Irving, Esq. lying on the north-east side of the river, — whereby the 
channel is rendered deeper, for bringing up the shipping to good 
and safe anchorage-ground, and also better protected from the 
prevailing south-west winds, by a narrow promontory or point of 



DUMFIUES-SIIIUE. 

land, on that side of the river, called Barnkirk hill, which is ele- 
vated about 45 feet above the tide at high water mark. The em- 
bankment of this field was begun in the year 1819, and finished 
tlie following year, at an expense of L. 3000, by the proprietor. 
It is formed by the soil taken from the inside of the embankment, 
consisting of sandy loam, and is on an average about 12 feet high, 
with a slope toward the tideway, of from 5 to 2 feet, to 1 foot in 
perpendicular height, according to the nature of the exposure to 
wind and currents. The slope in the inside is more erect. The 
front, or outward side of the embankment, is covered with green 
swarded turf, as well as the top, and the land side is sown with na- 
tural grass seeds, which have grown most luxuriantly from the 
richness of the soil. At the lower end or angle of this embank- 
ment, which runs across from the port or place where the ship- 
ping anchor, to the bottom of a hill or rising ground to the east- 
ward, there have been erected two jetties, measuring 140 yards 
in length, for conveying passengers, goods, and live-stock to the 
steamers, plying between Liverpool, Annan, Waterfoot, and Port 
Carhsle. The jetties were erected a few years ago by the 
owners of the steam-vessels whose register of tonnage are, the 
Solway, 192, City of Carlisle, 300, Newcastle, 396, and Vic- 
toria, 450, in all 1338 tons burthen. Here, they call regularly on 
their passage to and from Liverpool, to take in cattle, sheep, horses, 
grain, merchant goods and passengers, once a week during winter, 
and oftener in summer, and make the passage, a distance of 120 
miles, in twelve hours, or one tide. From the burgh to the jetties, 
about four years ago, an excellent road was formed, being forty 
feet in breadth, through the centre of the field, for the convenience 
of the public. It was made by a pubUc subscription, and cost 
L. 640. A commodious inn, with stabling attached, has been 
erected near the jetties, within the embankment, several feet be- 
low high water-mark. The intercourse along this road is kept up 
by a public coach from Dumfries to Annan, on every day the 
steamers arrive, and by private carriages of all descriptions, con- 
veying passengers, merchant goods, and the stock of all kinds to 
and from the burgh, as they arrive for the purpose of transporta- 
tion. The embankment and road were planned by, and executed 
under the superintendence of, Mr G. D. Roume, land-surveyor and 
civil engineer in this parish.

fare, by the public road conveying the mail coach from Portpatrick 
and Dumfries to the south by Carlisle, as well as the great trans- 
fer of live-stock from the west of Scotland and Ireland, whereby 
the public tolls levied there have become of considerable impor- 
tance to the burghers,— it was judged expedient to rebuild the 
bridge over the river, which was first rebuilt in the year 1720. This 
bridge, for a long time past, had been considered dangerous to 
pass and incommodious from the narrowness of its roadway. Ac- 
cordingly, in the year 1824, a new bridge was erected on the site 
of the" old one, a wooden temporary one having been thrown 
across the river about a hundred yards above the old one. This 
new bridge is 27 feet 6 inches in breadth betwixt the parapet walls, 
and has a neat flagged foot-path of hewn stone, 3 feet 9 inches 
broad on each side, and the middle roadway is 20 feet broad. 
It has three arches of 65 feet in span, each forming the segment of 
a large circle, with a rise of 13 feet 6 inches, from the level of the 
spring of the arches, — the roadway of the middle arch being 27 
feet above summer water level, having a fall from the main street, 
at the eastern end of the bridge, and across Lord Queensberry's 
Holm, on the west side of the river, of one foot in thirty. The ma- 
terials for building the bridge, consisting of red sandstone of excel- 
lent quality, were dug from Gallowbank quarry, nearly a mile farther 
up the river, and floated down on the stream on a barge or punt, con- 
structed for the purpose. The expense of lowering the street at 
the west end next the bridge, of erecting the bridge and forming 
the embankment across the valley on the west side, &amp;c. amounted 
to about L. 8000. It was built from a plan of the work furnish- 
ed by Robert Stevenson, Esq. civil-engineer, and executed by 
John Laurie, bridge contractor, Dalkeith, to both of which gentle- 
men the work does great credit, as there is not a more handsome 
and substantial piece of work of the kind in the kingdom. The 
temporary wooden bridge was taken down when the new stone one 
was finished. The cost of this last structure was L. 500. 

lioads. — The parish is intersected by the public mail-coach road, 
from Dumfries to Carlisle, which is kept in excellent repair, be- 
sides two public roads to the north and eastward, towards Edin- 
burgh by Langholm, one of these passing by Kirtlebridge, which 
is very near the outskirt of the parish to the northward, and the 
other by Stapleton, by Kilpatrick church, and Chapelknow, till 
it joins with the Edinburgh and Carlisle mail coach road along 
the Esk in Cannobie. Another public road leaves the first men- 



DUMFlllESSHlUE. 



tioncd road to Langliolni near Mount Annan, and from thence to 
Ecclefechan, where it joins the Carlisle and Glasgow mail-coach 
voad ; there is a fourth pubHc road from Annan by the bridge, and 
along the west side of the river to Brydekirk village, where it crosses 
the Annan by a substantial stone bridge oflhree arches. Upon 
all these roads, toll-bars have been erected, from the rents of which, 
and public assessments, they are kept in proper repair. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church of Annan was built in 
1790. It is a handsome structure, and surmounted with an ele- 
gant steeple and clock. It is commodious, neatly seated, with 
galleries on three sides, and well lighted, having four spacious 
windows in front, and smaller ones on each end. It does not, at 
present, afford sufficient accommodation for the whole congrega- 
tion, containing only 1190 sittings, the population of the parish 
when it was built consisting of only 2300, whereas the popula- 
tion of the burgh alone contains more inhabitants than the whole 
of the parish, at the period when the church was erected ; and in 
consequence of the allotment of seats to the landed proprietors, 
and their tenants and retainers, as well as the ancient burgh pro- 
prietors, a want of accommodation has been felt by the more recent 
settlers in the burgh. There are two Dissenting meeting-houses 
in the town, both of which have been recently built. One of them, 
belongs to the Associate Synod, and the other to the Relief Church. 
They are both very handsome buildings, commodious, and well 
attended by their respective hearers. The former of these has 
been long established in the burgh, but the congregation of the 
latter has only been formed within a few years past. There is 
also a preacher of the Independent persuasion, but it is understood 
he has not yet got any suitable chapel fitted up. 

The manse of the present incumbent of the Established Church 
is commodious, and in good repair. The glebe land belonging to 
the cure, properly speaking, consists of 10 acres of good land 
around the manse. Besides this, the minister had formerly a right 
of foggage, feal, and divot, on Annan common; but, when the 
division took place, in lieu of his right, 6 acres of moor ground 
were allotted to him, which at present let at the yearly rent of 
L. 2, 10s. From this, however, falls to be deducted an annual 
feu-duty to the burgh as superior, of L. 1, \'Ss. Gd., leaving to him 
from this source 16s. 6d. yearly. The present stipend is 19 
chalders of victual, half tpeal and half barley. It is variable in 
yearly value, being regulated by the county fiars prices of meal 



ANNAN.

and barley. There is, besides, L. 10 allowed lor communion ele- 
ments, the whole derived from the teinds of the parish. The ave- 
rage number of communicants belonging to the Established Church 
is 530. It is understood that there is not an individual, a native 
of the parish, and of sound mind, above fifteen years of age, who 
cannot read. Education is, indeed, so much prized by all, that there 
are few of the children of the place who have not been taught 
besides reading writing and the elementary rules of arithmetic. 
It may be remarked, however, that of late a number of Irish 
families have become settlers here. The parents generally Roman 
Catholics are found to be grossly ignorant, and pay no attention 
to the education of their children. At present, there are about 
150 persons, old and young, of this description in the parish, the 
greater proportion of whom are unable to read. 

Education. — There is one parish schoolmaster in the burgh, 
whose yearly salary is L. 31, 16s. 6d., with an additional allowance 
for a house and garden. The average number of scholars attending 
the parish school is from 80 to 90. There is another branch 
school belonging to the parish at Breconbeds, near Kirtlebridge. 
The schoolmaster's salary is L. 10 yearly, and the average num- 
ber of scholars from 60 to 70. 

 Poor and Parochial Funds. — The fund from which the poor of 
the burgh and parish of Annan are supplied, is raised by an assess- 
ment on the real rental of property in the burgh and parish, the 
proprietors contributing one-half, and the tenants the other, the 
rates and allowances being settled twice a year, at Lammas and 
Candlemas. The collectors and treasurers of the poor cess mo- 
ney, are appointed by the heritors, magistrates, and kirk-session of 
Annan. The number of paupers at present on the roll is 121, 
who are paid weekly every Saturday forenoon, receiving from Is. 
to 2s. 6d., or higher, according to circumstances. There is a small 
bequest yearly from the estate of Gullielands of L. 5. The poor 
are paid more liberally here than in any other of the neighbour- 
ing parishes ; but, the more they get, the more they would have. 
The amount of the money paid for the last half-year was L. 295, 
8s. 6d. 

Burgh,. Civil Constitution, and Education continued. — The sub- 
sisting charter of this burgh was" granted by King James VI. on 
10th July 1612. It recites, that this town had been erected into 
a burgh by King James V. in 1538. The population of Annan 
has been more than doubled during the present century. From a 



•-5 



534 



DUMFIUES-SHIRE 



statement furnished by the town-clerk, the revenue of the burgh 
may be stated at L. 650, arising from customs, feus, rents, &amp;c. 
and is expended in

The town is governed by twenty-one councillors, who select 
from among themselves a Provost, and three Bailies, and other 
office-bearers, by whom the police of the burgh is administered at 
the expense of the covimon gude or burgh revenue, there being no 
assessment for any purpose imposed by the magistrates or coun- 
cil. The parliamentary and municipal constituency, as adjusted 
by the sheriff of Dumfries-shire on the 17th of August 1837, was 
179, and the constituency of the landward part of the parish at 
70 or 80. From time immemorial, the heritors of Annan, both 
burghal and landward, and their tenants, had possessed the right 
of pasturage and cutting turf on 1650 acrqs Scotch measure of 
indifferent commonty lying to the north of the town. As this land 
was, under such management, very unproductive, it was in the 
year 1802 divided among those interested ; burdened, however, 
with an annual payment of L. 200 to the magistrates for behoof of 
the community,— which sum was, at the suggestion of Mrs Gra- 
ham, the amiable and accomplished wife of the author of the Sab- 
bath, appropriated to secure L. 1000 to be expended in building, 
and L. 65 annually in endowing, an academy for the public bene- 
fit. The annual income of the institution is now L. 113, exclu- 
sive of wages. The average number of scholars for the last ten 
years has been 141. This is an excellent institution, and has 
proved highly beneficial to the burgh, the parish, and the sur- 
rounding district. An Infant School has also been lately esta- 
blished in the burgh. The school house was built in 1834 by sub- 
scription. The teacher. Miss Williamson, receives a salary of 
L. 30 per annum, which sum is paid partly from small weekly 
charges on the children, and partly by subscription. The number 
of pupils in regular attendance, from three to six years of age, is 
averaged at 85. Its beneficial effects are now fully acknowledo- . 
ed and duly appreciated by the pubHc. 

In the former management of the burgh concerns, it appears 



ANNAN. 



535 



that alienations of the burgh property had taken place to the 
amount of more than L. 6000 ; but as the proceeds of these aliena- 
tions have been laid out in works most beneficial to the public 
interest, it is obvious that the community have reaped the full 
advantage of such alienation. But the debts still remaining a pub- 
lic burden on the community, amounting to upwards of L. 4000, 
are of a nature more detrimental to the public benefit. From the 
Report of the Commissioners on Municipal Corporations of Scot- 
land, it appears, that the taxations in this burgh are peculiarly 
light, with the exception of the assessment for the poor. In fact, 
no taxes of any description are levied by the magistrates except 
poor money. There are no incorporated trades with exclusive 
privileges in Annan, and no qualification has been enforced to 
entitle any one to manufacture or trade within the bounds of the 
burgh. The magistrates issue burgess tickets both to ordinary 
and honorary burgesses, but they exact no fees of entry except the 
stamp of the tickets. 

Addenda.  

Brydekirk. — The church at Brydekirkwas at first designed as a 
missionary station, comprehending a detached part of the parish of 
Annan, situated about three miles from the burgh on the west 
side of the river. It was built entirely at the expense of Mrs Dirom 
of Mount Annan and her friends, in the year 1835, and appoint- 
ed an established district parish church by the General Assem- 
bly in the year 1836; and on the 17th of August following, the 
Rev. H. Macbryde Brown was ordained first minister. The church 
is a neat and commodious structure, situated at the west or upper 
end of the village of the same name. It is seated to contain 370 ' 
sitters, including benches for children in the area. The extent of 
the parish may amount to nearly two square miles on both sides of the 
river, comprehending a part of the adjoining parish of Hoddam, 
which is annexed to it. The principal heritors are, Mrs Dirom of 
Mount Annan, the Earl of Mansfield, General Sharpe of Hoddam, 
and Mr Irving of Bonshaw. The population of the village of 
Brydekirk, with the adjacent houses, may amount to about 400. 
This number, which forms a part of the 770 deducted from the 
congregation of Annan, with the additional number supplied from 
the parish of Hoddam, with recent settlers in the village, will now 



530 



DUMFUIES-SHIRE. 



make the whole popiiUition of the parish about 1000. Last sum- 
mer, a neat. and commodious dvveUing-house was erected in the 
village for the minister, but is scarcely yet finished. 

The stipend or income of the present minister is derived from the 
seat rents, or voluntary pecuniary aid of the benevolent proprietor 
of Mount Annan or Brydekirk estates, within which the greatest 
part of the parish is placed ; but it is to be hoped, that, ere long, 
his station and labours in. the church will be rewarded according 
to his merits. The church is well attended by a devout and se- 
rious congregation, much attached to their minister. The pooi-- 
rates and other parochial affairs are conducted on much the same 
principles as those adopted in the landward parts of the parish of 
Annan. 

The schoolmaster, very recently appointed to the situation, has 
not yet been accommodated with any school-house properly fitted 
up, nor dwelling-house. His salary consists of L. 10 yearly, be- 
ing a commutation of a victual stipend, assigned, while the school 
formed a branch school of the parish of Annan in 1 828. The 
number of scholars attending the school here may vary from 60 to 
80 in summer and winter. . There is likewise an infant" school es- 
tablished here, and a school for teaching girls reading and sewing, 
both taught by females. A Sabbath evening school has also 
been established by the minister of the parish, which is now at- 
tended by 100 young people. 

There is a corn mill in the village, constructed on the best prin- 
ciples, for grinding corn and dressing flour. A substantial stone 
bridge, consisting of three arches, was thrown over the Annan, 
here, upwards of twenty years ago, at a very considerable expense 
' to the public. At the east end of the bridge a large building was 
erected for the manufacturing of wool, much about the same pe- 
riod when the bridge was built, and to which, machinery for saw- 
ing timber has been attached. The intersecting roads here are 
kept in good repair.

PRESBYTERY OF LOCHMABEN, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES.

THE REV. JACOB WRIGHT, MINISTER. 

1. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — It is observed in Hutchinson's History of the County of 
Cumberland, that the name Hutton, which is the name of a parish 
also in that county, is probably derived from the principal village 
being originally a town of huts. It appears not improbable that 
this parish derived its name from the same circumstance ; and it 
strengthens this supposition, that there is a farm near the church 
of the name of Newton, where the principal inn of the parish has 
been long kept. It is natural to suppose that Newton was so cal- 
led on its erection, in contradistinction to the old fragile tenements 
formerly on the spot. The rivulet Corrie gives name to the other 
part of the parish. The word is Gaelic, signifying a narrow glen. 
The rivulet accordingly issues from a glen, where this parish joins 
Eskdalemuir, Dryfe, another rivulet, which rises in the upper 
part of the Hutton division of the parish, and flows through it for 
six or seven miles, derives its name from its fury during floods, and 
driving all before it. In rainy seasons it is frequently shifting its 
bed, disfiguring fields, and destroying ferries and mill-dams. 

Extent Boundaries. — The united parishes extend from N. W. 
to S. E. about twelve miles in length. The breadth is unequal, 
but may average three miles. They are bounded on the N. E. 
by the ridge of hills and waterfall which divides Annandale from 
Eskdale ; on the S. E. by the water of Milk, which separates the 
parish of Corrie from Tundergarth ; and on the N. and W. by 
the parishes of Wamphray, Applegarth, and Dryfesdale. 

Topographical Appearances, Sfc. — The view is very different 
from different positions. Within sight of the rivulet Dryfe, till near 
its source, the hills are of a fine verdure, and the banks much co- 
vered with wood. In sight of the Milk, the view is less hilly, less 

DUMFRIES, M ni

DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



woody, and less rocky. In sight of Corrie, there is a large extent 
of rich pasture and meadow. On the heights between these waters 
the scene is mossy and bleak ; but not barren. 

11. — Civil History. 

Antiquities. — Besides the remains of British forts specified in 
the former Account, there is nothing in the parish, under this 
head, that claims notice. 

Parochial Rec/isters. — The parish register was very imperfectly 
kept previously to 1799, when the present incumbent succeeded. 
It contains a list of baptisms from 1745 to 1772 ; a list of marriages 
from 1746 to 1771 ; and a list of testimonials from 1746 to 1769. 

Land-owners. — These, in the order of their valuations, are as fol- 
lows : J. J. Hope Johnstone of Annandale ; Samuel Rogerson, of 
Boreland ; Miss Graham of Heithet ; William Rogerson of Gil- 
lesbie ; George Graham of Shaw ; Thomas Beattie of Creeve ; 
Andrew Kyle of Paddockhole ; John Bell of Whiteknow ; The 
Duke of Buccleuch. The only resident land-owners are, Messrs 



Rogerson, Graham, and Bell.

As the Dissenters occasionally neglect to get their children's 
ages registered, the average of births is probably stated too low. 

The increase of the population appears to have been principally 
occasioned by the improvements that were made in the parish, dur- 
ing the last thirty or forty years, in consequence of which additional 
labourers and servants have been required. Within the last twenty 
years, a number of cottages have been erected on Corrie commo.n, 
several with parks containing a few acres attached. 

Character, Sj-c. of the People. — During the last thirty or forty 
years, the inhabitants have generally improved in manners, intel- 
ligence, and good conduct. Various causes have contribut- 
ed to this. The incfeased profits of farmers during the late war, 
and the advance in the wages of labourers and servants, have 
enabled these classes to obtain a greater number of the comforts 
of life. Greater attention has been paid to dress,and to cleanli- 
ness in their persons and habitations. The increased attention 
paid to the state of the public schools, has also, had a considerable

influence. The mode of pronunciation is greatly improved, a more 
efficient and extensive course of education is attended to, and the 
attendance on the schools is more regular. For a considerable 
period, there has been a Sabbath school in each of the united pa- 
rishes, from which the rising generation have derived great benefit. 
The old mode of burial has been long abandoned. The precise 
hour of meeting is observed, the time during which the company 
remain is short, and the service slight. The use of spirits, on 
other occasions also, has become more limited. As a proof of the 
general good conduct of the inhabitants, there have been no con- 
victions of any of them, so far as is recollected, before a criminal 
court, except in a few instances for poaching. At the same time, 
worthless characters occasionally appear in the parish; but the worst 
of them come to us from other countries. Some have come from 
the north of England. The Irish also occasionally visit us, and 
offer their services at a rate ruinous to native labourers ; and threa- 
ten to reduce these last to their own low condition. The profits 
from farms and the wages of labour having greatly decreased since 
the re-establishment of peace, there appears now a good deal of 
pecuniary distress. The consequence has been, emigration to -the 
British North American possessions and the United States. Dr 
Smith observes in his Wealth of Nations, that man is, of all lug- 
gage, the most difficult to be transported ; and that such is his at- 
tachment to the place of his birth, and where he has spent his 
early years, that he will cling to naked rocks, and pestilential 
swamps, to a land of storms and tempests. This attachment, 
however, appears to be losing strength with many. And indeed, 
such numbers of their friends and acquaintances have preceded 
them, more especially to the British North American possessions, 
that they no longer consider these to be the land of strangers. 
The population of the parish, it will be seen, has been steadily 
advancing, notwithstanding of emigration, and since employment 
has become more difficult to be procured, it is fortunate there is 
such a vent for the superfluous population. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture.  — The whole extent of the parish is nearly 23,000 
imperial acres. Of this there are only 3000 occasionally cultivat- 
ed, the remaining 20,000 not having been ploughed within the last 
forty years. But at an earlier period, and before the middle of last 
century, cultivation had been extended considerably farther than

it has been latterly. The number of farms was much greater, — two, 
three, and four, having afterwards in many cases been united into 
one : and the marks of the plough are visible on many places which 
have been long under sheep pasture. Within the last ten or twelve 
years, the proprietors and tenants of these pasture farms have found 
it profitable again to break up their dry uplands, which had been 
formerly ploughed, and were covered with heath and coarse grasses. 
They are generally of a fine dry soil ; and although the elevation is 
in most cases great, being from 400 to 800 feet above sea level, 
yet, when hmed, they produce excellent crops of oats and potatoes, 
which, although attended with some risk in bad seasons, more 
amply remunerate the farmer than his land kept long in rotation. 

The pasture is, by liming and breaking, in part tripled in value. 
This improvement is going rapidly on ; and it is not perhaps too 
much to say, that there are yet 1500 acres more of dry soil to be 
improved, having an elevation that admits of its being profitably 
brought under occasional cultivation. 

There may be said to be no natural timber remaining in the pa- 
rish, excepting a few scattered trees of ash along the banks of the 
Drj-fe. The plantations are of very small extent, and chiefly made 
witliin the last five years. The whole do not exceed 100 acres, 
and are chiefly larch and spruce fir. Within the last two years a 
number of clumps have been planted on the sheep-farms for shel- 
ter, — a system which will no doubt be carried to a considerable ex- 
tent. But although the soil is good, the elevation and exposure 
will make the growth tardy. About a century ago, ash trees seem 
to have been regularly planted around the farm-yards, and great 
care to have been taken in the rearing of them. From the plan- 
tations being so young, little management is yet required. 

Rent of Land.— It is difficult to state a rent per acre of arable 
land, there being almost no farm without a considerable proportion 
•of pasture. Were they separated, the best land on the lowest si- 
tuation although there is none less than 350 feet above sea level, 
and most of it 500, would probably give L. 1 per acre. But, taking 
the average of the whole, it would not exceed 10s. There being 
no farms devoted entirely to the rearing or grazing black-cattle, the 
rate of rent per head cannot be distinctly ascertained. Where 
cattle happen to be taken in for grazing on ordinary unimproved 
land, the rate paid for the summer grass may be L. 1 for a year 
old, and L. 1, 10s. for a two year old. The rent per head for 
sheep is well known. Of the whole extent of the parish two- 
thirds are occupied by regular breeding stocks of Cheviot sheep, 



HUTTON AND GORllIK. 



541 



and nearly all the stock-farms have been let just now from 5s. to 

5s. 6d. per sheep. 

Live-StocL— About 15,000 acres, or two-thirds of the parish, 
are occupied as sheep-pasture in nine or ten regular breeding farms, 
keeping about 10,000 silieep, wholly Cheviot, with the exception 
of eoo'or 700 of black-faced on the highest ground at the head of 
Dryfe. The farms are all what is termed ffrassi/ or stronc/ land, 
and great attention having been paid to the improvement of the 
breed, perhaps there is no parish in Scotland which, on the whole, 
possesses a more valuable or productive stock of mountain sheep. 
The stocks belonging to Mr Graham of Shaw, and Mr Bell, te- 
nant of Whitcastles, have in particular been considered as among 
the first of their kind in the border counties. Within the last four 
years, cross lambs from Leicester rams are bred on the lower situat- 
ed sheep-farms, the ewe stock being kept up pure Cheviot. These 
cross lambs selling from twenty to thirty per cent, above the Che- 
viot, has greatly increased the annual returns from these farms ; 
but it requires a longer experience to prove that this system will 
continue se profitable, there being considerable doubt whether the 
ewe stocks can be kept up of proper quality, and whether the pre- 
sent difference in the selling price of the lambs will continue. 

The other third of the parish, in point of extent, is divided into 
farms from 150 to 600 acres, chiefly occupied in the rearing and 
grazing of black-cattle. Each of these has a portion of land in 
cultivation ; but from its elevation, and the coldness of the climate, 
the farmers sell little corn, excepting in very favourable seasons. 
The cattle are all of the Galloway breed. They are mostly kept 
till two and three years old, and sold for the Norfolk market. Great 
attention has of late years been paid to their improvement, by ob- 
taining superior bulls from Galloway, and by giving premiums at 
shows ; but there is yet much room for better management, espe- 
cially in the winter feeding. Ayrshire dairy cows have been in- 
troduced, apparently with much success, upon some farms in the 
neighbouring parishes ; and the farms of this parish, which have ge- 
nerally tracts of strong rough pasturage, and abundance of meadow 
hay, have been considered well adapted to them ; while, on the 
other hand, the small extent of green crop, and want of early and 
kindly grass, have been stated as great objections to their profitable 
management. It is probable, however, that before , long the ex- 
periment will be made.

the sheep land, cand also the common cattle pastures ; but tTie lat- 
ter particularly admit of much improvement by this means. There 
have been few attempts at irrigation or embankments ; indeed, the 
latter are little required. About twenty years ago, an injurious 
system prevailed of breaking up the natur coarse pastures on cold 
soils. The crops of corn were at first great ; but the land is much 
depreciated in value. For some time past, this error has been seen, 
and none of this sort of soil is now cultivated ; while, as before 
stated, the attention of farmers has been directed to the dry upland 
ridges, which have been of old under the plough. 

The general length of leases on the property of Mr Hope John- 
stone, being three-fourths of the parish in point of extent, is twenty- 
one years on the cattle and mixed farms, and thirteen years on the 
sheep farms. 

On a number of the farms of the parish,'the steadings have been 
rebuilt and slated within the last thirty years. But a portion yet 
remains to be done. When new leases are now let in this district, 
the houses are generally put in good order and slated. In point 
of enclosure, there has been a great extent of fencing executed 
within the last twenty years. Still much requires to be done, in 
order to bring the land to its full value. The elevation and cold- 
ness of soil in most situations, and want of wood for paling, are 
bars to the success of thorn hedges, now extensively planted ; while 
stone dikes, which are the immediately useful and permanent fences, 
are, in most parts of the parish, difficult and expensive in the erec- 
tion, from the scarcity of material of good quality. 

The sheep district of the parish is, and has been, rapidly im- 
proving in production. There has been almost no change in the 
occupiers, for a long course of time. They are men of sufficient 
capital, and much intelligence in their business. The extent and 
progress of their enclosures, and good cultivation, their draining, 
and the high and improving character of their stock, shew that there 
has been nothing deficient on .the part of the tenant, and no want 
of encouragement from the proprietor. 

With regard to the more numerous, but smaller black cattle and 
mixed farms, the tenantry have not been so prosperous. High rents 
fixed at the end of the war, although largely abated, loss of ca- 
pital by low and fluctuating prices, and by unremunerating cultiva- 
tion in bad seasons, have retarded the improvements of this class 
of farms. Now that it is discovered that there should be little 
corn I'aised in the district, and that the colder soils should never 



IIUTTON AND CORRIE. 



543 



be ploughed, a more permanent and steady system of improvement 
may be'expected to proceed. A good deal of attention has been 
directed to improvement by top-dressing with lime, and draining 
the extensive meadow lands for hay. The same system should ex- 
tend to the low-situated rough pastures. No fences should be 
erected, excepting to be well kept. These improvements, parti- 
cularly the liming, require great outlay on the part of both pro- 
prietor and tenant; and they can only be attended to on the part 
of the latter, where the farms are moderately and under-rented. 
Should there be no great depression in the price of farm produce, 
there is every reason to expect, that, from the encouragement by 
the landlords, and increasing intelligence of the tenants on this 
class of farms, a steady system of improvement will proceed ; — al- 
though it may be noticed, that, hitherto in this district, in general 
these mixed cattle farms in cold districts have made much less ad- 
vance in value by improvement and management, than either the 
dry arable farms of the lower country, or the more elevated and 
extensive sheep farms. 

A circumstance may be mentioned, which will explain why the 
above species of farms has not, in many instances, thriven in this 
parish. The buying and seUing of their black-cattle, a necessary 
part of the business of the farmers, has led to the habit of frequent- 
ing markets on all occasions, and ultimately to cattle- dealing, upon 
which, consequently, has followed inattention to their farms, and 
in too many cases, from the precarious nature of the business, loss 
and ruin. The changes, however, in the tenantry have already 
not been numerous from this or any other cause ; — there being, 
since the peace in 1815, only two or three farms out of nearly 
forty in the parish, which have changed occupants. 

Produce. — The average amount of raw produce raised in the 
parish may be stated as follows : 

Imp. acres. 

950 of oats, including straw, at L. 3, 10s. . . L. 3325 0 0 

300 green crop of all sorts, at L. 4, . . 1200 0 0 

250 rye-grass hay, at L. 1, 15s. . . . 437 10 0

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market- Tovm. — There are three different quarters in the pa- 
rish, where a number of cottages are collected, to the amount of 
eight, ten, and twelve. There is nothing in it, deserving the 
name of a village. The nearest market-town, where there is 
also a post-office, is Lockerbie, distant from the church about 
seven miles. Dumfries, however, distant seventeen miles, supplies 
the principal market, to which there are regular weekly carriers, 

Means of Communication. — The public roads have been greatly 
improved, or rather almost entirely formed, within the last thirty 
years. The country being considerably hilly, the roads were ori- 
ginally ill planned ; but improvements are made from time to time, 
as the funds allow. There are two principal lines of road in the pa- 
rish ; the one from Dumfries, Lochmaben, and Lockerbie, towards 
Eskdalemuir, Ettrick, and Hawick, extending four miles ; the other 
from Moffat, towards Langholm and Carlisle, extending eight miles. 
There are three bridges over the rivulets, Dryfe, Corrie, and Milk, 
the last of which divides this parish on the south-enst from Tun- 
dergarth, for seven or eight miles. The roads and bridges are 
kept in good repair. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church stands near the Dryfe, on the 
west side of the parish, and is far from being in a central situa- 
tion; the parish not extending more than a mile from it on the 
west; whereas, towards the north-east and south, it extends six. 
At the same time, the densest part of the population is round the 
church, and were a new one to be erected, it could not be perhaps 
placed more conveniently than the present. The church was built 
towards the beginning of the last century. An addition, in the lan- 
guage of the country, a jam, was built to it in 1764. It is kept 
in good repair, and forms a decent place of worship. It can ac- 
commodate 312 sitters. The manse was built in 1803, some ad- 
ditions and 'improvements having been since made. The glebe 
contains nearly 28 Scots acres, and may be worth L. 16 or L. 18 
a year. The Court modified the stipend in 1823 to sixteen chal- 
ders, half barley, half oatmeal, with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion 
elements. 

The following distribution of the families of the parish among 
the different religious denominations approaches pretty nearly the 
truth. It is not professed to be perfectly accurate. In a number 
of instances, the members of a family belong to more denominations 
than one. Families belonging to the Established Church, 95 ; 



HUTTON AND CORRIE. 



545 



Relief, 22; Secession, 12; Reformed Presbytery, 1. The average 
number of communicants at the EstabHshed Church is 140. The 
yearly average amount of collection in the church for religious and 
charitable objects, may be stated at L. 15 or L. 16. 

Education. — There is a school in each of the divisions of the 
parish. That in the Hutton division is parochial. The salary, 
as lately fixed, is L. 27. The school fees may amount to L. 15. 
Mr James Graham, a native of this parish, bequeathed, in 1802, 
the sum of L. 260, two-thirds of the interest of which to be paid 
to the schoolmaster of Hutton, for teaching poor children reading, 
writing, and arithmetic, gratis. The school of Corrie is now be- 
come endowed. Mr Edward Moffat of Exeter originally left L. 280, 
the interest of which to be paid to the schoolmaster of Corrie, on 
condition of his teaching the whole children of this division of the 
parish reading and writing gratis. In 1820, Mr James Wilson, 
a native of MolFat, and grand-nephew of the original founder, added 
L. 20 per annum to the salary, on condition of the schoolmaster 
teaching the whole children, reading, writing, and arithmetic, gra- 
tis ; and also that the school be considered as endowed ; he and 
his heirs and successors appointing the schoolmasters; it being at 
same time understood, and expressly stated, that the trial of the 
qualifications of the schoolmasters, and the power of taking cog- 
nizance of their conduct, should be regulated by the act 1803. 
The heritors of Corrie have for a considerable time paid the school- 
master a small salary of L. 8, 6s. 8d. At the same time, they 
have reserved to themselves the power of withholding it, should 
they be so disposed. The schoolmasters' houses and school-rooms 
have been lately rebuilt, and are in a good state. Besides a gar- 
den, the schoolmaster of Corrie has four Scots acres of good pasture. 
The branches taught in the schools are reading, writing, arithmetic, 
grammar, geography, mensuration, navigation, Latin, Greek, and 
French. The expense of education for nine months, during which 
proportion of the year the schools are taught, the vacations being 
seldom short of three months, is as follows : reading, 6s. ; do with 
writing, 7s. 6d. ; arithmetic, 9s. ; any higher branches, 15s. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — Owing to unfortunate dispensations 
of Providence, the expense of the support of the poor has, within 
these few years, been greatly increased. The average yearly ex- 
pense for the last seven years was L. 35, 17s. Assuming the 
number of families relieved to be 20, this gives nearly L. 1, 16s. 
for each. At the same time, a number of these cannot be con- 



J'" DUMFIIIES-SHIRE. 

sidered on the poor's list, and receive merely a temporary relief. 
A few families, for the last four years, have received as high as L. 5 
each. The funds to meet this expense are, collections in the 
church, L. 12 ; one-third of the interest of money, mortified by Mr 
James Graham, formerly mentioned, L. 4, 6s. 8d. The rest is 
supplied by donations from the heritors and others. I believe it 
is real necessity that induces any to apply for rehef. An idly- 
disposed character may occasionally be found. 

Inns, Sfc. — There is an inn in each part of the parish, m\h ac- 
commodation for travellers. Spirits and ale are also sold at a 
toll-bar. There is no drunkenness in the parish ; and none can 
be said to frequent places, for the sake of strong drink. At the 
same time, spirits are drunk on occasions to a considerable extent. 

Fuel— Peat is used as fuel in this parish, except in a few fami- 
lies, which employ coal in their parlours. There are large fields 
of moss in the parish, sufficient for the supply of many future gene- 
rations. The providing peat occupies a great number of hands 
during a considerable part of the summer. It has frequently 
to be carried a distance of two and three miles. But as coals are 
very expensive, — Annan, fromwJiich they are chiefly brought, being 
sixteen and eighteen miles from the greater part of the parish, — it 
is considered a most fortunate circumstance that the other fuel is 
so abundant.

Miscellaneous Observations. 
It is hoped that the following observations, pointing out various 
evils which depress the tenantry and other classes, though of a 
general nature, will not be deemed foreign to the objects of this 
work. 

1. The state of the tenantry would be greatly improved by a dif- 
ferent mode of disposing of their surplus stock. The great pro- 
portion of their black-cattle and sheep, it is well known, goes to 
England. There is, however, no sound policy in the tenants them- 
selves proceeding with them to the south fairs, and in so far be- 
coming drovers : for not only are their farms thereby in danger 
of being neglected, and they themselves exposed to the risk of 
contracting unsteady and irregular habits, but there is, moreover, 
reason to apprehend, that they could not dispose of their stock to 
as good advantage as it would be disposed of by persons experien- 
ced in the trade. There appears, therefore, a propriety in dispos- 
ing of their surplus stock to merchants who present themselves. 



HUTTON AND CORRIE. 



547 



Now, It is the unfortunate character of many of these merchants 
which constitutes a principal drawback to the prosperity of the far- 
mer. The writer must not be understood as insinuating anything 
to the disadvantage of men, who, having begun business on a small 
capital, and encountered bad fairs in the south, have not been 
able to implement their engagements. When they have made a 
fiiir surrender of their effects, nothing moKe can be required at 
their hands. But considering the great and repeated losses which 
farmers have experienced from the prevailing practice of giving 
credit, it surely deserves the consideration of the Highland So- 
ciety, and of the other associations for promoting the interests of 
husbandry, whether another system might not be devised, and such 
losses prevented. Wool-staplers appear at certain seasons, and it 
is not understood that there is much risk or loss in transacting with 
them. It is believed, that were due pains employed, a safe class 
of merchants might present themselves for other objects as well as 
wool. It may be thought that the evil will cure itself, and that 
such repeated losses witnessed will render the country more cauti- 
ous. But the evil does not appear to cure itself ; and hence the 
interference of public-spirited individuals, or associations, is most 
desirable. 

It is not meant, by what is here stated, to discountenance native 
dealers, even though in commencing trade their means should be 
humble. But it is suggested, that they should look, for support, to 
relatives or friends, who can attend to their proceedings, and ob- 
serve that they are of a prudent and safe description, and check 
that adventurous and reckless spirit, which is a common charac- 
teristic of the profession, when credit can be obtained. 

2. The burden of vagrant beggars contributes in no ordinary degree 
to depress a parish. It is difficult to compute the numbers of these 
over Scotland. Dunlop, in his Parochial Law, computes them, 
towards the end of the seventeenth century, at 200,000. And 
it appears that Government established manufactories, in order to 
compel them to work ; and also ordered the burghs to build correc- 
tion houses for confining and punishing them. The numbers are 
probably at present much less ; but they are still very great. It is well 
known, that vagrant begging has, for ages past, been a regular trade. 
There are what may be called breeding places of pauperism over 
the kingdom, which send forth fresh swarms of paupers every sea- 
son. Many marry and rear families without the smallest consi- 
deration how they are to be supported, except by the trade of beg- ' 



548 



DUMFRIES-SHIRE. 



ging. These wanderers have been allowed to multiply over Scot- 
land without any hindrance. In England, checks have been em- 
ployed to prevent the multipHcation of the poor. They have been 
encouraged and assisted to emigrate ; or they have been employed 
at home on roads, railways, canals, and the plantation and enclo- 
sure of waste lands. But in Scotland, their increase has scarcely 
met with a single check. The expense of supporting them over 
the kingdom must be very great. Some years ago, it was comput- 
ed, on good data, that the expense of vagrants in this parish was 
ten times that of our own poor : and as our poor are half-support- 
ed by non-residing heritors, the expense of vagrants was probably 
twenty times the amount of what was contributed, within the pa- 
rish, for our own poor. 

From this, it appears to what a dreadful oppression the tenantry 
of the country are subjected. The loss is very great in a pecu- 
niary point of view. But it is not merely in this light, the subject 
should be considered. We may readily conceive the disgusting 
circumstances attending the communications of the tenants with 
these paupers, and the contamination to which their families are 
exposed from such intercourse ; and if the tenants are exposed to 
such oppression, the landed proprietors would do well to consider 
that their own interests must ultimately suffer. Indeed, the whole 
expense of vagrants must be considered as deductions from their 
rentals. Their tenants cannot thrive under such oppression. And, 
moreover, should they be exposed to it, they will do less for the 
resident poor ; and consequently, a greater burden will be thrown 
upon the heritors. In this county, there are parishes where as- 
sessments are established, while it has been customary to demand 
no part from the tenantry, on account of their being subject to 
the heavy burden of vagrants. 

It is to be regretted, that the very persons who chiefly suffer, 
are many of them hostile to any change. Having had vagrant 
begging always before their eyes, they look on it as a natural and 
necessary order of things. They look on vagrants as God's poor, 
for whose sustenance and support they are bound to provide ; not 
considering that the proper objects of charity, that may be found 
among them, form a very small proportion of the whole, — probably 
not one-twentieth part, — and that even these proper objects have a 
right to be supported by their own parishes. At the same time, 
the suppression of this evil will occasion inconvenience and suffer- 
ing to some. But no reformation can be set about without a por- 



HUTTON AND COIIUIE. 549 

tion of this. Not to mention the powerful reasons for suppression 
formerly mentioned, it appears even an act of humanity to stop the 
multiplication of this idle and profligate race ; and compel them, if 
possible, to betake themselves to a Ufe of industry, honesty, and 
decency. The oppression they occasion, moreover, prevents a due 
attention to our own poor, and it is not unfrequently alleged by 
many, that the expense of strangers is so heavy, that they have 
little to spare for the other. The same argument is employed to 
excuse their very indifferent contributions to public charities, or 
the funds of religious societies. 

Several of the counties of Scotland are now bestirring them- 
selves, and taking measures to root out this great national evil. 
And there appears little doubt, that the evil has only to be grap- 
pled with in order to be subdued. Should these counties perse- 
vere, and similar measures become general over the kingdom, the 
suppression of vagrant begging can still only be expected to be gra- 
dual. It appears to be a mistaken idea that it can be rendered im- 
mediately complete. Humanity points to a gradual abolition. It 
would be most distressing, should the wanderers find every door 
shut against them at once. By taking steady measures for a gra- 
dual suppression, they will obtain a fair warning, that the trade of 
begging is an unlawful one, and there is every reason to hope that 
they will gradually disappear. The great means to be employed, 
in accomplishing this measure, is to get the law of settlement en- 
forced. The limits prescribed to the writer prevent his attending 
to this and some other matters. Let it merely be observed in con- 
clusion, that when vagrants are sent to their place of settlement, 
they will accumulate in some quarters to very great numbers ; and 
the parishes may find it difficult to provide for them. It is to be 
hoped that collections and contributions will not be refused in be- 
half of cases attended with distressing circumstances. 

 Since the above was written, the county of Dumfries has adopted measures for 
the suppression of vagrant mendicity. A few years ago, the sy.iod of Dumfries ap- 
pointed a committee of their number to attend the meetings of the Commissioners of 
Supply, with a view to this object. After some delay, the commissioners directed 
the various parishes within the bounds of the synod to send reports, in order to 
enable them to judge whether the country was disposed and prepared to co-operate 
in putting a stop to the evil. These reports having been judged satisfactory, the 
commissioners voted L. 300 per annum for the payment of constables to be employed 
over the county ; it being understood that such parishes only would be entitled' to 
the gratuitous services of constables, which should adopt the necessary regulations for 
putting a stop to vagrant begging. These regulations require station-houses to be 
provided in necessary places, where vagrants may get relief, and occasionally lodging, 
in passing, the parishioners steadily refusing alms. It is usual for a number of con- 
tiguous parishes to form themselves into a union. Notwithstanding that the measures

3. The use of ardent spirits debases and depresses all classes of 
the community. Two or three years ago, it was stated on autho- 
rity, that the consumption of spirits in Great Britain, was 30,000,000 
of gallons, of which 5,000,000 were consumed in Scotland. The 
population of Great Britain and Ireland was lately upwards of 
23,000,000. And it has been calculated, that the expense of 
bread, the stalf of life, is greatly less than the expense of spirits. 
The whole produce arising from the industry of all classes and pro- 
fessions, throughout the United Kingdom, has been calculated at 
L. 36,000,000, or L. 37,000,000. And a third of this has been 
employed in purchasing spirits. 

But while it appears that the loss occasioned by expending 
money on strong drink is of no ordinary description, this, as every 
one knows, is by far the least evil attending the unfortunate pro- 
pensity ; the injury to health, and to every habit of activity, and 
every moral and religious feeling being incalculable.  

4. The habit of using tobacco and snuff wastes to a lamentable 
extent the resources of the inhabitants of a parish. The follow- 
ing statement will show what these articles cost immense numbers 
of deluded people, throughout the nation. The duties paid on to- 
bacco in Great Britain and Ireland for 1829 were stated to be 
L. 2,859,000. Add to this the cost of production, the expenses 
of freight, the profits of the manufacturer, wholesale merchant and 
retailer, and the whole will amount to an annual sum, which, in 
the course of fourscore years, would almost pay off the national 
debt. And all this is of course paid by the consumer. The pro- 
portion of duty for Scotland in 1829 was L. 273,000. Suppose 
L. 400,000 paid for the article by the consumers, which is pro- 
have been adopted foi- a short period only, and have, moreover, met with opposition 
in some few quarters, vagi'ants have in a great measure vanislied from the county. The 
office of constables, where they have been employed, has been found nearly a sine- 
cure. And it does not appear that their services will be long required Nov. 1837. 

 In 1 834, the House of Commons appointed a Select Committee of their number 
to take evidence on the vice of drunkenness. The witnesses ascribe a large proportion, 
much more than the half of the poverty, disease, and inisery of the kingdom, to this 
vice. Nine-tenths of the crimes committed are considered by them as originating in 
drunkenness. The pecuniary loss to the nation from this vice, on viewing the sub- 
ject in all its bearings, is estimated by the committee, in their report to the House 
of Commons, as little short of fifty millions per annum. A great many of the wit- 
nesses recommended the prohibition of distillation, as well as of Uie importation of 
spirits into the kingdom. In a religious view, the consequences of this vice, as ap- 
pears from the evidence, are no less afflicting. In London, Manchester, Liverpool, 
Dublin, Glasgow, and all the large towns through the kingdom, the Sabbath, in- 
stead of being set apart to the service of God, is made by hundreds of thousands 
a high festival of dissipation, rioting, and profligacy. It is sincerely to be wished that 
the excellent institutions for rooting out drunkenness, now appearing in every pait 
of the kingdom, mny grapple successfully wilh this great destroyer.

bably too low a calculation, and that there are 1000 parishes, be- 
ing a few more than the actual number, this gives L. 400 as the 
average for each parish. Such is the annual sum paid for an ar- 
ticle of luxury, the using which arises from a mere idle habit, and 
which cannot be proved to be beneficial in any shape whatever. 
And since by ftir the greater part is consumed by the lower ranks, 
what inconsiderate folly on the part of this class, to expend upon 
an useless nuisance what might be usefully employed in purchas- 
ing food and clothing for themselves and their poor famiUes  

I shall here state a circumstance, showing in a strong point of 
view, the foolish and unfortunate habits of the country. A con- 
siderable number of years ago, the kirk- session of this parish distri- 
buted somewhat less than L. 20 annually amongst its paupers, of 
whom the whole, or nearly the whole, made use of tobacco. And . 
it was computed by those who had access to know, that a sum 
equal to the whole given by the session, was spent by these pau- 
pers in purchasing this article of luxury. This places in a strong 
light the absurdity and folly of wretched habits among the lower 
orders. Almost the whole of the collections in the church, toge- 
ther with sums derived from other sources, were expended by these 
poor people upon a nuisance  To this poor result, and to the gra- 
tification of artificial, unnatural, and degrading appetites, the col- 
lected benevolence of the charitable of a whole parish was made to 
contribute  This is a subject well deserving the consideration of 
those who have to support the poor. "J'he use of these articles 
unquestionably adds very seriously to the burden of supporting 
them. L. 200 or L, 300 might be stated as a probable annual 
outlay for the nuisance in a parish. But I know parishes in the 
county of Dumfries, by no means distinguished for affluence, where 
the annual expense is above L. 800 ; and the greater part, perhaps 
nine-tenths of the nuisance, is consumed by poor people. 

Before concluding, I have shortly to advert to two other griev- 
ances, which, it is believed, are found generally over the country, 
and which deserve the consideration of those who have the dispo- 
sition and abihty to promote the interests of society. 

1. The general condition of cottagers is far from comfortable. 
The old clay or stone and turf houses are disappearing ; and sub- 
stantial cottages, built with stone and lime and slated, are rising in 
their stead. But these last do not rise in sufficient numbers, and 
the accommodation of great numbers of poor families is very 
wretched. It is not uncommon to see two families, each pretty 



552 



DUMFRIES-SimiE. 



numerous, living in one of these old cottages. One small apart- 
ment must serve for all purposes. It is most distressing to wit- 
ness one of these families when fevers and other contagious dis- 
eases visit them. And not only is the accommodation wretched, 
but an exorbitant rent is frequently demanded, more especially 
when a fiimily has a cow grazed, — an object about which families 
with young children are solicitous. The tenants allege, that the 
landlords rack them, and that they are under the necessity of act- 
ing the same part to their dependents. There are many liberal 
minded landlords in the country, who wish not to see either tenants 
or cottagers oppressed. And it would be well for the latter, were 
they to take them entirely under their own management and pro- 
tection, as is practised in some parts of the country. 

2. Much loss and mischief are occasioned by dishonest emi- 
grants to America. It is well known, that the United States and 
the North American British Colonies are the quarters to which 
the eyes of thousands, who find they cannot thrive in their own 
country, are anxiously directed. And of these a considerable pro- 
portion are guilty of dishonest practices. During the ministry of 
the present incumbent, not much short of a score have left this 
parish under charges of various kinds ; some to avoid supporting il- 
legitimate children, — some, after swindling practices and commit- 
ting forgery, — and some after committing frauds of all sorts, with a 
view to emigrate with their ill gotten gains. The state of our 
North American Colonies is such, that it may be said to hold out 
a premium to the practice of villany in the mother country. This 
is a subject well deserving the attention of our landed proprietors 
and legislators.

PRESBYTERY OF DUMFRIES, SVNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. ROBERT KIRKVVOOD, A. M. MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The lower partof this parish was, unquestionably, at an 
early period, a Qiiercetiim, or oak forest, extending most probably 
to Snaid, in the parish of Glencairn, a distance of eight miles. 
In the eastern part of the parish, a quarter of a mile south-west 
from the parish church, there are Druidical remains. Now the 
Druids, it is known, held special assemblies once a year, and their 
assemblies convened in a consecrated place.  The grove or forest 
of this parish being designed or esteemed by them sacred, might 
transmit that character to the Culdees, their successors; and when a 
Catholic settlement was formed here, in the beginning of the twelfth 
century, itmightbe found advantageous to its object, still to continue 
itssacred character. That it was sodesigned by them is mostevident. 
The charter seal of the Abbot, dated 1264, is in my possession.-f- 
It bears the following inscription : Scj. Abhat. SacriNemoris — the seal 
of the Abbot of the Sacred Grove. Besides, there is a bull of Pope 
Innocent III., addressed, Ahbate de sacro nemore, to the Abbot of 
the Sacred Grove, in the diocess of Glasgow,:}: — that is Holywood, 
originally written Halywood and Halievvood. 

Extent and Boundaries. — This parish is situated in the most 
beautiful portion of the vale of Nithsdale. It is bounded on the 
east by the parish of Dumfries ; on the south, by Terregles, Iron- 
gray, and Kirkpatrick-Durham; on the west and north, by Glen- 
cairn and Dunscore ; and on the north-east, by Kirkmahoe. It 
extends about 10 miles in length, and is about 1 mile in breadth. 
It lies in the middle of an extensive valley, and the land is nearly 
without elevation. There is but one range of hills of short ex-

tent, and neither abrupt nor of great height. The parish contains 
14 square miles. 

Hydrography. — The river Nith ghdes along the eastern boundary 
of the parish, which it intersects at two places; and the intersections 
are obviously occasioned by a change in the line of the river during 
high floods, which happen frequently every season. To guard 
against the effect of these, several proprietors have secured their 
lands by embankments. The Nith, during summer, is fordable at 
three places. 

The Cluden, a very considerable stream, runs along the south 
side of the parish for more than eight miles. It intersects it at 
three places; and in one of these, the lands of Speddoch and Milli- 
ganton, 1 '200 acres, are separated fron; the continuity of the pa- 
rish. There is a ford often impassable during winter. There 
is now in building, two miles lower, a wooden bridge for carriages. 
The expense, L. 120, has been raised by subscription ; a matter 
creditable to those who have taken an interest in it, and of certain 
public utility. 

Fishing. — The Cluden is an excellent trouting stream, superior 
in this respect to the Nith. Salmon, sea-trout, herlings, and oc- 
casionally pike are found in it. It is much poached. The best 
fishing range, both for numbers and size of trout, is near and be- 
yond the upper extremity of this parish. In the former account 
of the parish, it is stated, " that though the two rivers, ihe Nith 
and the Cluden, unite at the south-east corner of the parish, each 
has its own distinct species of salmon. The Cluden salmon are 
considerably thicker and shorter in the " body, and greatly short- 
er in the head than those of the Nith." These peculiarities still 
exist, and if the fish has been more than two days run, its colour 
is much darker in the shade than one similarly situated in the 
Nith. This colour is obviously occasioned by some peculiarity in 
the water of the Cluden ; and very probably this, that it contains 
a greater proportion of moss in solution. 

The number of salmon taken in the Cluden is not great. From 
a verdict by jury lately obtained, stake-nets will be removed from 
the boundaries of the Nith upon the Solway, and therefore it is 
anticipated that more salmon will find their way to our linns 
and pools. It is, besides, the opinion of the most experienced 
fishermen, that the fishing season closes too early ; and that, too, 
at the time, when the best fish are advancing, few of which, how- 
ever, though not permitted to be legally taken, escape the torch

and the spear of those who respect neither the law nor the right 
applicable to this species of property. The close season, instead 
of commencing on the 25th of September, should extend to the 
5th of October. 

The lands of Cowhill and Portract have a right to fishings in 
the Nith, and Fourmerkland in the Cluden. 

The salmon cauofht are nearly all sold in Dumfries, at from 2s. 
to 6d. per pound, according to the time of the season. Springs 
are abundant, and the water is of the purest quality. 

Meteorology. — The climate is dry, and eminently healthy. The 
correct habits of the people, and the fact, that they are all almost 
employed in agriculture or rural pursuits, may be assigned as 
the causes of the general good health which prevails. During 
the last fifteen years, there have been only four cases of typhous 
fever; and in this period, thirty-six persons have died of pulmonary 
consumption. This season, when scarlet fever has been peculiarly 
fatal in parishes around, out of sixty cases, in this parish, there 
were only three deaths. 

Geology.— ThQ upper part of the parish, in the hill portion of 
it, contains greywacke. Near the centre, at Rue and Newhouse, 
of Baltersan, there is hard red freestone, and also limestone. The 
dip is to the south. These are not worked. On the lands here men- 
tioned, within twenty-five years, portions of lead ore have been turned 
up by the plough in considerable pieces ; and, within twenty years, 
on the west boundary of Cowhill estate, a fragment was dug up, 
which weighed three pounds. At Cluden Bank, there is red free- 
stone, but so coarse and soft as to be unfit for building. 

Boulders are numerous in some parts of the parish. They con 
sist chiefly of diff'erent varieties of large and small grained grey- 
wacke, conglomerate, and trap,— together with several varieties of 
granite and sienite, which, in general, are different from those of 
Criffel. They are found from a stone weight to three tons. 

The soil of this parish is varied. The lands along the Nith, 
and also for a considerable tract on the Cluden, are of a deep al- 
luvial soil, and entirely free of stones. Advancing beyond these 
tracts, the soil becomes lighter. It is dry, and lies for the most part 
on coarse sand, though, in some places, the sand'is so fine as to be 
used for the purposes of building. There is another portion 
receding from the former, which consists of a deep strong loam. 
The subsoil istilly, and abounds with small stones; yet, in suitable 



556 



DUMFRIES-SniRE. 



seasons, it yields excellent crops. In the higher parts, the soil is 
of the same character, though less deep. This part has never been 
ploughed ; nor probably would it pay, if it were. The grass, though 
not fine, is suitable for young cattle. 

Botany. — This parish being alnnost entirely agricultural, the 
range of its botanical products is neither extensive nor interesting. 
The following is a selection of its most common plants : — 

Artemisia vulfjaris Cochlearia ofliciiialis Polypotlium vulgare 

AchilltBa millefolium Geum urbannm Oxalis acetosellu 

Agrimonia eupatoria rivale comiciilat:i 

Betonica ofliciiialis Ilolostcum umbellata Piantago major 

Carum carui Mentha pulegiuin Sambucus elulus 

Convallavia majalis Orchis mascula Marrubium vulgare. 

There are no extensive woods in the parish. The trees are 
those common in the surrounding district, namely, oak, plane, ash, 
beech, birch, horse-chestnut, and larch, with an intermixture of 
spruce and Scotch fir in belts of planting. 

Zoology. — The mole and the weasel are numerous. There is 
also a sufficient stock of polecats. Foxes frequent the hilly dis- 
trict, but they are not abundant. At times, they visit the lower 
district, at a distance from the scene of their fixed resort, and kill 
the barn fowl. Complaints, however, are not frequent against 
them; and this may be held as good evidence that they do not 
too severely annoy the farmers' wives, by depriving them of their 
feathered stock. The otter is to be found on the banks of the 
Nith. The severe amusement of otter-hunting has of late been re- 
vived. Hares and partridges are not so numerous as report affirms 
them to have been, when servants made it a stipulation not to have 
hare soup and salmon to dinner, in the respective seasons, more than 
three day in the week  The blackbird, the thrush, the bullfinch, 
and the linnet are abundant. The swallow and all the birds of 
the district are to be found over the parish. The owl has a do- 
micile in the church steeple ; and generally finds a home near every 
gentleman's mansion. Flocks of seagulls, before a storm, advance 
from the Solway, a distance of eleven miles, and visit the lower 
and middle'parts of the parish. They are never seen here, but be- 
fore a storm. On one occasion, last year, they came in such num- 
bers as to cover more than an acre of the glebe lands. They re- 
mained for some time, and before night a severe storm was expe- 
rienced. 

IT. — Civil History. 
Land-oioners. — The principal land proprietors arc, S. Denholm 



IIOLYVVOOD. 



Youno-, Esq. of Giiilyhill ; Captain Charles James Johnston, R. 
N. of Cowhill ; Francis Maxwell, Esq. of Gribton ; Miss Gilchrist 
of Newtonairds ; the heirs of the late Dr John Gilchrist of Sped- 
doch ; Thomas Corrie, Esq. of Stielston ; and Alexander Harley 
Maxwell, Esq. of Portract. 

The number of proprietors of land having L. 50 and upwards of 
yearly rent, resident and non-resident, is 23. In all, there are 37 
heritors, 17 of whom are non-resident, — a circumstance decidedly 
disadvantageous to land improvement, and to the interests of the 
parochial poor. 

Parochial Registers. — The earliest register of baptisms, mar- 
riages, collections, and disbursements, is of date 30th December 
1687. The register appears entire till 8th May 1697. It com- 
mences again 9th February 1725, and continues, except a few years 
after 1 806, entire to the present time. It is evident, from the register 
of 1688, when many of the principal parishioners made confession, 
and were publicly rebuked for their sin of having taken the test, 
that the people of this parish were decidedly attached to the churcb, 
as their posterity have continued to this d,ay ; and therefore there 
has existed no feeling hostile to the registration of baptisms and 
marriasfes. 

- Patronage. — The Earls of Nithsdale held the right of patronage 
of Irongray, Terregles, Kirkgunzeon, Holynwod, and Ruthwell. 
William, Earl of Nithsdale, sold the patronage of Holywood to 
Alexander Ferguson of Isle in Kirkmahoe, advocate, in 1714. Ro- 
bert, his son, was served and retoured heir to his father, and was 
the next patron. It was sold by him to Robert Fergusson of Four- 
inerkland in this parish. In 1724, Mrs Beveridge, spouse of the 
Rev. Andrew Beveridge, minister of Caerlaverock, was patroness 
in 1771. Her son, Robert, succeeded. His sister married the 
Rev. James M'Millan, minister of Torthorwald, and proprietor of 
the foresaid lands of Fourmerkland ; and their daughter, Ann, re- 
lict of Dr James Crichton, minister of Holywood, succeeded to 
the patronage, — by whom the present incumbent was presented. 
John Crichton, Esq. of Skeoch, purchased it in 1823, for L. 750, 
and his relict is now patroness. 

Eminent Men. — Joannes de Sacro Bosco, it has often been sup- 
posed, was a native of Holywood. This, however, is not the fact. 

Tliat is, tlic Sacrament, in tlic Episcopal form, as a token or test of submission 
to the then tyrannical powers. Such slate tricks are revolting to the siiritunl genius 
of Christianity.'

He may, for a time, have been a monk of the abbey ; but he was 
a native of Halifax, in Yorkshire. He was educated at Oxford, 
and taught philosophy and mathematics at Paris. The Amalgest 
of Ptolemy and the Commentaries of the Arabs were abridged 
by him. His work was long famous as an elementary book, un- 
der the title o.f De Sphaera Mundi.  He died at Paris 1235. f 

The only person eminent in learning or science, a native of this 
parish, was Mr Charles Irvine, surgeon, mentioned in the former 
Account, by Dr Johnston. He was son of the late William Ir- 
vine, Esq. of Gribton, and the person who, some years before 
1790, discovered the method of rendering salt water fresh, for 
which he was rewarded by Government with a grant of L. 5000. 

Antiquities — The Abbey. — There are now no remains of the 
Abbey of Holywood. It stood in the south-east corner of the pre- 
sent burying-ground. It was founded by Dervorgilla, or Donagil- 
la, daughter of Alan Lord of Galloway. She was the wife of 
John Baliol, Lord of Castle Bernard, and mother of John Ba- 
liol, declared King of the Scots by the decision of Edward 1. 17th 
Nov. 1292. Spotiswood states that Souls Seat, near Stranraer, 
founded by Fergus Lord of Galloway, early in the twelfth cen- 
tury, was the mother of Holywood and Whitehorn. 

The abbey belonged to the order of the Premonstratenses, found- 
ed by Norbert, Archbishop of Magdebourg, in 1121. This or- 
der was instituted in the diocese of Laon, in France ; and the 
monks pretend that the place was called Praemonstratum, because 
it was divinely pointed out, divina revelatione prcemonstratum. Six 
monasteries in Scotland belonged to the monks of this order, viz. 
Souls Seat, near Stranraer, Holywood, Whitehorn, Dryburgh, 
Kingland in Galloway, and Feme in Ross.'J; An inspection of the 
chartulary of the Bishoprick of Glasgow, which extends from the 
year 1115 to the Reformation, and which is preserved in the Uni- 
versity library, would, it is probable, afford much information re- 
garding the chartulary of Holywood. 

The abbey, which bad across the middle of the building a fine 
Gothic arch, by which the oak roof was supported, and whose en- 
trance was through a handsome semicircular arch, was taken down 
in 1778, and the materials used for building the present parish 
church. The two bells which belonged to the abbey are still the

parish bells. They are of excellent tone, and one of them, by the 
inscription it bears, was consecrated by John Wrich, probably the 
abbot, in the year 1154. 

Tower. There is at Fourmerkland a tower of small extent. It 

was built by R. Maxwell, in the year 1590, and is still in part in- 
habited. 

Druidical Temple,— oi more than a quarter of a mile south- 
west of the church, eleven large stones are placed in an oval form. 
There were twelve originally ; but one, many years since, was re- 
moved. Their origin has always been traced to the times of the 
Druids. They are situated near the lower termination of the Sa- 
cred Grove, to which reference has been made. And there are 
lands about half a mile to the east, which of old extent are design- 
ed JVoodneuk, so named because they were situated at one of the 
corners of the grove. 

Six of these stones are small-grained greywacke ; two, coarse- 
grained greywacke; and other two are greywacke, but the colour 
is of a green tint ; and the last is a small-grained granite rock. 

The greywacke seems to be of the same general description as 
the varieties of this rock which occur in Dumfries-shir. The ori- 
ginal locality of the granite rock is more doubtful, as it differs ■ 
from that of Criffel. 

It is not easy to conceive how these masses could have been 
transferred to their present locality. The difficulty may be conceiv- 
ed, when it is stated, that the largest stone, by cubic measurement, 
weighs nearly twelve tons; and the second largest, nine tons. 

On the lands of Holm, within a mile due east of these stones, 
there was, within the last fifty years, another Druidical temple. It 
consisted of nine large stones, and was situated on a small emi- 
nence within 200 yards of the Nith. Unfortunately, and without 
the knowledge of the proprietor, Peter Johnston, Esq. of Carnsal- 
loch, they were broken and applied to the purposes of building. 

Cup. — Among the res sacrce of the parish, there is a commu- 
nion cup, made of silver. It is saucer-formed, and contains three 
gills and a half imperial, and weighs nine ounces. There is around 
it, an inscription in rudely formed capital letters — For the Pa-  
Risii or Haliewood, 1619. The initials of the stamp, C. R. F. E. 

Hospital. — In the list of religious houses, Spotiswood states, 
that Robert II. comfirmed the foundation of an hospital made 
within the monastery of Holywood, by Archibald the Grim, Earl 
of Douglas.

Modem nuildimjs.—Bvooimlg House, on the banks of the 
Nith, the residence of S. Denholm Young, Esq. Two miles far- 
ther up the Nith is CowhiU House, the residence of Captain 
Charles James Johnston, R. N. It commands a most interesting 
view of the Vale of Nith, from Friars Carse, in Dunscore, to Dum-- 
fries. One mile still higher, is Portract House, the property of 
Alexander Harloy Maxwell, Esq. Gribton House is situated on 
the Cluden, and is the residence of Francis Maxwell, Esq. It is 
built in the baronial style. Newton Airds, the property of Miss 
Gilchrist, a delightful residence, is also on the Cluden.

Mills.— At Cluden, there are floui-, corn, and barley mills, dis- 
tant from Dumfries three miles. The proprietor is James Gil- 
lespie Gordon, Esq. London. The mills are let on a lease to the 
Company of Bakers Dumfries, at L. 200 per annum. Six persons 
are employed at from L. 20 to L. 36 yearly. The quantity of 
grain ground is, of wheat 4000 imperial bushels every three months ; 
of oats 3000 do. do. ; of barley shelled, 250 do. do. ; of barley 
into flour, 107 do. do. 

A quarter of a mile higher up the Cluden, there is a mill, in 
which barley is ground, flax is prepared, and wool carded. The 
water power here is equal to from 400 to 500 horses power, and 
it remains unaffected by the changes of the season. Wool is also 
spun by machinery on a small scale at Speddoch. 

Character of the People. — In their habits they are very cleanly 
and steady, and in general irreproachable. They are affVible and be- 
nevolent, and, with very few exceptions, they are punctual in their 
attendance on divine ordinances. In matters of religion, they have 
no feeling in common with those that are given to change. They 
are sound and firm Presbyterians; and, therefore, from wcU-de-

fined principle, they are steadily attached to the institutions of 
our country. 

There is not an individual belonging to the parish who is either 
insane, or fatuous, or blind, deaf, or a cripple. 

In the course of the last three years there were 6 illegitimate 
births in the parish.

Rent of Land. — The best land is let at from L. 2 to L. 2, 6s. 
per acre, and the average rent is about L. 1, 5s. per acre. Graz- 
ing for a milk cow is L. 4. The leases of the principal farms are 
from fifteen to nineteen years. The real rental of the parish, as 
nearly as can be ascertained, is L. 7436. The rental in 1790, as 
stated in the former Account, was L. 3000. 

Produce. —The produce of the parish has been doubled within 
the last thirty years. It is extremely difficult to obtain the exact 
produce ; but, instead of this, there are presented the ascertained 
returns of the land per acre. At one period, the best wheat lands 
yielded from 50 to 60 bushels per acre. The average at present may 
be stated at from 25 to 30 do. There were individuals who persist- 
ed, till lately, to sow wheat, until the return was under 15 bushels 
per acre. The deficiency in this species of crop has been occasioned 
by improper management ; and there can be little doubt, that if the 
wheat lands were put under summer fallow, and repeatedly plough- 
ed, especially in the heaviest soils, during the season, and well 
cleaned, and then fully manured, there would, as formerly, be 
available returns of crop. 

The average of oats per acre is from 46 to 55 bushels imperial. 
There are lands that produce from 60 to 65 bushels ; and one por- 
tion of late, newly broken up and improved, produced above 100 
bushels per acre. 

Barley yields an average of from 30 to 40 bushels per acre ; 
best lands 55 to 60 do. 

Ten tons may be given as the average per acre, of the potato 
crop; best lands, 15 tons, worth, on an average of seven years, 
L. 1, 2s. per ton. The ton at present sells at L. 2, 8s. 4d. This 
price is occasioned by the failure of the potato crop in this dis- 



562 



DUMFRIES-SIIIllE. 



trict, — a failure in the seed, soon after planting, which has oc- 
curred every season for these four years past, and for the preven- 
tion of which no remedy has yet been discovered. The potato 
raised from the plum has shared the same fate. On the glebe this 
year, not one cut in forty of potatoes, in the fourth year from seed, 
vegetated. A simple process might be tried, and will, in this pa- 
rish, be adopted next season. Let the dungsteads be turned over, 
at least twice in the season; and, if the weather permit, let the 
potatoes be planted not later than the first week in April. 

Turnip. — This species of crop is in extensive operation. Bone 
manure is used at from 20 to 25 imperial bushels to the acre. The 
turnips are eat off by sheep, and pay at from L. 3 to L. 3, 10s. 
per acre. 

The parish is all subdivided, and now nearly all drained. The 
farm-houses are good, and, for the most part, all slated. The ro- 
tation of cropping is what is termed a fifth shift, though there are 
not wanting instances of a fourth shift, a system of rotation that is 
ill adapted to the capabilities of the soil, and, on a fifteen years' 
lease, unprofitable to the tenant. If farmers only knew, and were 
willing to follow. Lord Bacon's remark, That nature is not 
conquered but by obeying," it would essentially advance their in- 
terests and those of the landlords. 

Improvements. — In 1827, Francis Maxwell, Esq. purchased the 
estate of Gribton, containing 550 Scotch acres. On surveying 
the lands, he found that in many fields it was difficult for the 
plough to enter sufficiently deep into the soil, because obstructed 
by stones imbedded, especially on the top of the subsoil. To de- 
vise means effectually to remove this obstruction, he devoted his 
energetic attention. Nor did he long deliberate. 

In 1828, he commenced operations. The plan adopted was to 
draw a fur by the plough, on each side of the ridges. From the 
bottom of the fur so drawn, a man with a crow-bar raised the stones. 
He was followed by another, who removed them, even to 2lbs. lay- 
ing them on the unploughed part of the ridge. By so laying them, 
they were more easily carted ofll" than they would have been, from 
the' part which had been ploughed. The opened up furs thus 
cleared of stones, the plough took its course with another set of 
furs ; and thus, in succession, proceeded till the furs met at the 
crown of the ridges. By this process, all stones, from a pound 
weight to three tons, have been removed. The soil, now free, is 
in depth from twelve to fifteen inches. At present, 235 Scotch

acres are thus improved; and there are yet 143 acres, which Mr 
Maxwell, with his wonted determination, intends to complete. 
From 8oWto 10,000 roods of drains have been cut, from three 
to nine feet deep, according to the levels ; in width, at the top, 
three feet; and at the bottom, two feet; all of which have been 
built and penned. The subsoil is clay- till, which, where the drains 
have been formed, has been removed by barrows, and then spread 
over the land at from two to six inches deep. 

On an average, forty men, mostly from the Emerald Isle, have 
been employed, with little interruption, during eight years past. 
Some hundred thousand carts of stones have been cleared off, be- 
sides those used for filling up drains. 

The average expense of trenching, clearing off stones, and drain- 
ing, has been fully L. 20 per acre ; and the whole expense incur- 
red since 1828 amounts to nearly L. 5000. 

The improved lands have been cropped thus : \st, Two white 
crops, worth from L. 6 to L. 10 per acre. 2d. Turnips, bone ma- 
nure, L. 4 ; eat off by sheep, from L. 3 to L. 4. 3t/, Oats and bar- 
ley, and sown out, yield from L. 8 to L. 10 per acre. Ath, Rye- 
grass, worth from L. 3 to L. 5 per acre. 

These lands, previous to their present state of improvement, 
were not worth on an average in grass more than 16s. an acre. 

Mr Maxwell has highly enriched the general aspect of his estate, 
by a style of improvement and expense of which the south of Scot- 
land affords few examples. It is to be hoped that the advanced 
value of the property will reimburse him for his unequalled per- 
severance as a land improver. 

Live-Stock. — The Galloway and the Ayrshire breed of cattle 
are kept by the farmers in this parish. Few of the Galloway breed 
are fed off. They are all sold at one or two years old. The Ayr- 
shire are esteemed as preferable for the purposes of the dairy. There 
is neither a drover nor a cattle-jobber in the parish. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Toion. — There is no market-town in the parish. Dum- 
fries is the chief market place, three miles distant from the lower, 
and ten miles from the highest, part of the parish. It is the post- 
town. 

Villages. — There are two small villages, viz. Holywood and 
Cluden village. The former contains thirty-five families. There 
are two grocers in it, who are licensed to retail ale and spirits. 
These and the toll-house at Cluden Bridge, are the only licensed

houses. It would be better if there were none, and there is no 
necessity for them. The practice, secured by the last turnpike 
act, of granting licenses to tollhouses indiscriminately, can neither 
be justified by any principle of utility, nor an enlightened regard 
to the economy and happiness of the people. 

Means of Communicatioji. — These means, in this parish, are of 
the first order. The roads, extending to nearly thirty miles, so 
intersect the parish, as to render every part of it of easv access. 
They are kept in repair by the statute labour conversion money, 
and they are in the very best travelling condition. The assessment 
on the lands is L. 60 per annum. 

The great trust road from Carlisle to Glasgow by Dumfries 
passes through the parish near the manse. A daily coach from 
Carlisle to Glasgow passes in the morning ; and one from Glas- 
gow to Carlisle in the afternoon. There is a coach from Dum- 
fries to Edinburgh, and another from Dumfries to Glasgow by 
Ayr, which passes three times a-week. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church of Holywood was built in 
1779. It is a most comfortable building for the purpose. It has 
a square tower, of simple architecture. The situation of the church 
is incommodious, being not more than a mile from the lower part 
of the parish, and more than eight miles from the remotest house 
at the upper part of it. It is seated to contain, by legal measin-e- 
ment, 530 sitters, but 600 can be suitably accommodated. The 
number of communicants is 300. 

The manse was built in 1773, and it and the church were com- 
pletely repaired at an expense above L. 400, in 1821. The glebe 
contains eight acres of good arable land. The manse, offices, 
gai'den, &amp;c. contain one acre of this quantity. The stipend was 
augmented in 1805, and is L. 174, 64 pecks of bear, Nithsdale 
measure, 66j imperial bushels and 2 bolls of oat-meal, Nithsdale 
measure. In these is included L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion ele- 
ments. The net stipend is about L. 181. 

The following is the number of Dissenters in the parish : — Unit- 
ed Secession, 20 ; Reformed Presbytery, 4 ; Relief, 6 ; Episco- 
palians, 6; Catholics, not natives, 10,- total, 46. 

Ministers of Holywood. — In the parish records the following list 
is preserved of those who were ministers in this parish : 

1. Mr Robert French was the first Presbyterian minister. 

2. Mr Adam Rae, who preached two Sabbaths at Holywood, 
and one at Keir by turns.

3. In 1633, John Nimmo, who was also factor and chamberlain 
to the Earl of Nithsdale. He was suspended for some years, repo7i- 
ed in 1647, and deposed in 1652. 

4. Mr William Hay was settled in April 1653, vAS-thrust out 
by act of the Scots privy-council at Glasgow in 1662, after Epis- 
copacy had been established in Scotland. 

5. Mr Alexander Arbuthnot, first Episcopal minister after the 
Restoration, settled in 1633. 

6. Mr John Malcom, turned out at the Revolution in 1688: 

7. Mr William M'Millan, first Presbyterian minister after the 
Revolution. He died 25th February 1697. 

8. Mr Robert Blair, ordained 27th September 1698, died 3d 
June 1724. 

9. Mr John Scott, ordained 4 th February 1725, translated to 
the new church Dumfries, 30th November 1732. 

10. Mr Thomas Hamilton, ordained 21st February 1734, died 
at Glasgow 24th June 1772. 

1 1. Bryce Johnston, ordained 22d August 1771. He had the de- 
gree of D.D. conferred on him. He published an Exposition on the 
Book of Revelation, and an Essay on the way to Restore and Per- 
petuate Peace, Good Order, and Prosperity. A volume of sermons 
was published after his death. He died 27th April 1805, aged 58. 

12. James Crichton, D.Dc was translated from Wamphray; in- 
ducted here 10th October 1805; died 26th July 1820. 

13. The present incumbent was ordained 1st May 1821. 
Education. — There are three parochial schools. The salary of 

the first is L. 26, Os. Id., but the teacher has neither dwelling- 
house nor garden. The school-house is capable of containing 100 
children, and was built in 1823, at the expense of L. 130. It is situ- 
ated near the church, and the branches taught are, English, writing, 
arithmetic, practical mathematics, book-keeping, geography, Latin, 
Greek, and French. Bible history and the first principles of re- 
ligion are also taught. The school is conducted on the intellectual 
system. The salary of the second schoolmaster is L. 15, Os. Id., 
and that of the third is L. 10, 6s. 4d. The teachers of these two 
schools were not elected to teach Greek and French. The first 
master's whole income may be stated at L. 60 : that of the second 
and third, at from L. 25 to L. 30 each. 

The schools are examined once a year by a committee of pres- 
bytery. There is no person at fifteen years of age who cannot 
read ; and parents Very generally exhibit a becoming anxiety to 



566 



DUMi'RlES-SHIRR 



have their children educated, and there is no family at such a dis- 
tance from the schools as to preclude the children from attending. 

There is a private school at HolywOod village, in which English 
reading and sewing are taught. It is conducted by two females. 

Poor. — In 1790, when the population was 736, the poor on the 
roll were 15. At this date, the population is 106G, and the poor 
are only 16. Six of this number are above eighty years of age, 
and three are above seventy. They are supported by the collec- 
tions, and from a fund created at a former period by the surplus 
of the collections. This surplus fund is L. 270, but is on the de- 
crease. Two of the poor receive L. 4, 4s. per annum ; one L. 4 ; 
and the rest from 8s. to 14s. a quarter, according to their circum- 
stances. Except three, they are all able to aid in supporting them- 
selves. In addition, each person on the roll living in the parish is 
allowed 12 cwt. of coals every winter ; and a number of poor 
householders, but not on the roll, have the same allowance of coals. 
This plan has been pursued for the last fifteen years. 

The nobility of Scottish independence exists strongly among the 
poor of this parish ; but it never fails to wane, soon after a person 
is recognized among the class of parish paupers. 

The collections amount to about L. 40 per annum. 

There is no person a beggar belonging to the parish, nor would 
any be allowed, while there are funds to relieve the poor. 

Fuel. — The fuel used is partly coal and partly peat. English 
coal is sold at Dumfries, from 14s. to 15s. per ton. Sanquhar 
coal, five miles distant, is sold at the same rate. Many of the 
farmers lead their coals from Sanquhar, a distance of twenty-three 
miles, sold at 5s. per ton. 

Library. — Forty years ago, a library was formed in this parish. 
It contains many standard works, chiefly in doctrinal and practical 
Christianity, the evidences of religion and church history. It is 
supported by subscription.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 

ON THE COUNTY OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1247384">DUMFRIES</name>.</head>
<p>
BY THE REV. DR SINGER, 

MINISTER OF KIRKPATRICK-JUXTA. 



1. In point of situation and exterd, this County, according to 
Crawford's map, and to the Agricultural Survey of 1812, extends 
from 55 2' to 55°. 31' of North Latitude, and from 2°. 39' to 3 53' 
of West Longitude ; being about 50 miles long, and 30 broad. The 
circumference extends about 21 miles along the Solway Frith, 33 
miles of low-lying inland boundaries, and 120 miles across hills 
and mountains ; in all 174 miles. Within this irregular circuit are 
1006 square miles of land, and 10 square miles of water, in all 
644,385 English acres ; of which about one-fourth is in fields un- 
der tillage, and the rest in water, moss, or other waste lands, woods 
and plantations, roads, or sites of buildings, or hill and mountain 
pasture. 

2. Dumfries-shire contains forty-two parishes nearly ; for small 
portions of some of these extend beyond this county. It compre- 
hends the three dales of Nith on the west, Annan in the middle, 
and Esk on the east; and the population of the whole was 
returned, in 1755, at 39,788 souls ; in 1801, at 54,597 ; in 1811, 
at 62,783; in 1821, at 70,878; and in 1831, at 73,770; 
appearing to have nearly doubled in less than eighty years. 
The synod of Dumfries extends beyond the county, and con- 
tains five presbyteries, and fifty- five parishes, including Maxwell- 
town. The county has a general slope and aspect towards the 
Solway Frith on the south, mountain ranges on the north and east 
sheltering it from cold, and its inland situation protecting it from 
excessive Atlantic rains. A great proportion of the soil is dry

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 



and the wet sheep walks are mostly drained. Locliar Moss con- 
tinues an unsightly waste of a vast extent of worthless flow between 
the towns of Dumfries and Annan, partly owing to the obstacle 
of entads ; for a plan of draining it and rendering arts of it navi- 
gable for boats was given in by Smeaton in 1754, to Charles 
Duke of Queensberry, and his estimate at that time was not quite 
L. 3000, being only about 4s. per acre ; this plan and estimate of 
a most important improvement having with difficulty been found, 
was therefore printed, in order to its preservation, in the Ap- 
pendix of the Agricultural Survey. Dumfries-shire is a salu- 
brious county in general, the Lochar Moss being the only thing 
of importance that is considered as hurtful, by its dense exhalations ; 
but it is believed that peat moss does not cause marsh fever— a 
complaint very little heard of in this county. 

3. The mountainous parts are of the transitionformation, and the 
secondary strata reach upward from the Solway to the bases of the 
mountains. Coal is worked at Canonbie on the south-east, and at 
Sanquhar on the north-west of the county ; in other parts, the 
trials not having been carried down so far as to give ground for 
success. Lead is worked at Wanlockhead on the north, and lime 
m various parts of the county. Several quarries of red, and one 
of gray, sandstone are regularly worked. Slate exists in several 
places, but not of hard and good quality. There is neither granite 
nor gneiss in Dumfries-shire, but plenty of trap and whinstone for 
building, — the greywache of the hills to the north of MofFat being 
rich in quaiiz, and consequently hard, beautiful, and durable. There 
is clay rich in alum and iron in some places, and in others marl 
of the stone or clay or the shell variety. Copper bs been search- 
ed for without success. The direction and dip of the lower strata 
vary considerably ; and in some of them, thin veins of gypsum, in 
others calcareous spar, have been observed, specks of which also 
appear, though rarely, in some stones quarried out of the sides.and 
bottoms of rivulets for building. It is well known, that the neigh- . 
bouring county on the west, called the stewartry of Kirkcudbright, 
is of primary formation, containing abundance of granite or gneiss, 
and the fields are less clear and plain, being often pierced at small 
distances by rocky eminences, between which, however, the soil, 
if well cultivated, is fertile and productive. 

4. In comparing Dumfries-shire with the adjoining counties, 
the Stewartry appears of less extent, containing only 882 square 
miles, and about half the popufetion of this county, and even La-

narkshiro, with nearly twice the population, containing only 945 
square niile.«. Ayrshire far exceeds Dumfries-shire, havino- 1600 
square miles, and about twice the population ; but this county pos- 
sesses nearly seven times as much cultivated land as the county of 
Peebles, and eighteen times as much as that of Selkirk. It has 
more sheep walks than these two counties put together, and near- 
ly four times their united population. Yet some individual 'pa- 
rishes in the Highlands are nearly as large as the whole of Dum- 
fries-shire  This most inconvenient arrangement of parishes and 
counties, may have been less grossly unsuitable, when the land 
rents and population were very different from what they now are ; 
but such a comparison leads to the conclusion, that a nexo division 
of counties and of parishes would be a most important national 
measure, with a view to future improvements. 

5. Manufactures have never been very extensive in this county, 
and for some time they have dwindled away very much. Com- 
merce has improved by the use of steam-boats, which now convey 
live-stock to England, along with goods and passengers. The roads 
have been wholly made within the memory of old persons, and in 
the lines of the mail-coaches they are now excellent ; they are also 
much improved in the common parish lines, with a few exceptions. 
No canal has yet been made, nor any railway though a survey has 
been commenced in O-tder to connect Glasgow and Edinburgh with 
Carlisle. Dumfries-shire, being a harder county, could never be 
improved before the union with England ; but that great object 
was promoted very much by the Scottish act 1633, allowing teinds 
or tithes to be valued once for all, and thus removing an obstruc- 
tion to improvement, which in barren soils would otherwise have been 
insuperable. The suppression of the civil wars, and the repeal of 
the jurisdiction act made way for improvement; and the church and 
school establishment carried the principles of religion and mora- 
lity with useful knowledge over the land. The good effects of pa- 
triotic Associations had also considerable influence; and since the 
former series of statistical reports, between forty and fifty years 
ago, down to the late stagnation of demand and prices for 
land produce, the course of improvement in Dumfries-shire has 
been remarkably great and beneficial. The produce of the soil 
has far more than equalled the advances in population ; and in 
the towns and villages, but still more in the roads and bridges, the 
farm-houses and offices, the fences and culture of the lands, the 
improvement of the live-stock, the cottages, the cliurches and

schools ; and in the dress and appearance of the people, and all 
the markets for produce and necessaries, — this may be almost con- 
sidered as a neiD county ; so greatly has it been improved in less 
than fifty years ; and now England and Scotland enjoy the bene- 
fits of their union, to their mutual advantage, and to a great ex- 
tent. 

6. One obvious cause of this advance in prosperity has been 
the constant and growing encouragement in the markets for land 
produce, which has gone on for a long period, notwithstanding 
some years or times of stagnation ; and if the present state of the 
markets would improve, the tide of advance would soon recom- 
mence, and the cultivated lands of this county might be farther 
meliorated and rendered more productive, perhaps to an extent 
equal to all that has yet been done for them. In 1656, a return 
of the valued rents of the land was made up for all Scotland, and 
those of Dumfries-shire came in Sterling money to rather above 
L. 13,000 ; hut in 1808, the returns of the same lands had risen 
to above L. 200,000, about sixteen times the land rents of 1656. 
It appears, indeed, from the statistical reports made up from forty to 
fifty years ago, that even then the real rents of land were advan- 
ced to eight times the old valued rents on the average of Scotland; 
and that in some counties they were twelve times as great. These 
are unquestionable facts, long before the public, and never se- 
riously contradicted, being incapable of refutation. It may be 
stated, that, according to a statement of the numbers, duties, and 
livings of the clergy of Scotland in 1807, the average prices of 
the necessaries of life had risen to five times the prices only fifty 
years before. It is certain that land rents rose in Dumfries-shire 
much above those of 1808; but that events occurred thereafter 
to reduce them by abatements and otherwise, so that now, after 
twenty-seven years, the amount is not more, perhaps, than in 1808. 

7. The agriculture of Dumfries-shire may be considered as a 
national object. The lands which are devoted to farming, and 
whose rental is about L. 200,000, at twenty-five years purchase 
are worth five millions Sterling ; and the buildings have cost the 
land proprietors, at two and a half years rents, another half million. 
The farmers do not find it safe to enter on leases with less than 
about L. 5 of capital and credit per arable acre in course of culti- 
vation, which, for ] 60,000 acres in the rotation fields, added to 
10s. per acre for nearly three times as great an extent not in cul- 
tivation, would indicate in all a farming capital of about one mil-

a '1 he returns in rent are very moderate, surely, as above ; but 
the gross returns ought to be very considerable,— three times the 
rent of lands in cultivation being thought by no means excessive 
to cover the whole outlay, risk, and interest with moderate profits ; 
and twice the rent of lands in pasturage, all as the gross returns of 
the land. Now, as the prices of these times can hardly be calcu- 
lated above L. 4 for the returns per English acre, or L. 5 per Scot- 
tish acre under crops, and the lands in crop are not above two- 
tifths of the whole fields, or cultivated lands, the other three-fifths 
being in grass ;

naturally asks, why should not the fundholder do the same  The 
navy 5 per cents, were fairly reduced to 4, with the reasonable op- 
tion to accept or be paid off ; and when banks give only 2 per

ther in the same way to reduce part of the twenty-eight millions of 
interest on the public debt  

10. Sir Henry Parnell and the Agricultural Committee of the 
House of Commons may, in this way, find something to compen- 
sate for part of the malt taxes ; and they may also be assured that 
if alt these were repealed, and the growth of barley left unburden- 
ed, it would extend very far indeed, and render importation of bar- 
ley both imnecessary and improper. The duties on spirits might 
then be raised, and perhaps on porter for public sale ; and this

committee would confer on the nation a most important benefit, by 
a total repeal of the malt duties for private consumption of ale and 
beer. For the most perfect system of improvement of land con- 
sists in barley following turnips eaten off by sheep, and introducing 
clovers and other sown grasses with the most advantage ; besides 
that, in late bad seasons, barley is the only crop that ripens fully, 
so as to lessen want and prevent famine : and by allowing the ma- 
nufacture of grain in every possible way, spirits excepted, there will 
be a liberal use of it for the comforts, the health, and the morals of 
the people ; and then, when a bad season occurs, the surplus thus 
applied in favourable seasons will supply the wants of the year in 
the home market, and prevent the necessity of exporting gold in 
the purchase of foreign grain; and, by extending the culture 
of barley to soils now overdone with wheat, the farmers will 
have encouragement for the culture of wheat on proper soils, by 
relieving it of the superabundant portion of wheat produce, and 
thus will the safety, the comforts, and morals of this country be 
all promoted. 

11. It IS of importance to consider that the culture of barley is 
not only discouraged and oppressed by a malt tax equal to the 
value of the grain, but by the apathy or ignorance of the owners of 
mills. It is liable when ground into pot-barley or meal to the heavy 
dues of about fourpence the bushel, being 10 per cent, of the value 
of the grain ; and as the offal is commonly kept by the millers for 
their own use,— if the barley be made into the finest description 
called pearly barley, a very large proportion goes off in working, 
which is also retained as part of the dust, though also rich in 
meal ; and betwixt the heavy malt taxes and mill dues, it is really 
surprising that the culture of this best grain of the United King- 
dom is continued at all. It would not be continued, if it were not 
for the genuine value and importance of a grain so trustworthy 
and so favourable to the improvement of the soil ; but though it is 
continued on a reduced scale, it would extend very much indeed, 
if these unnatural and most injudicious restrictions were all taken 
off; and landholders, in particular, and all classes would bless the 
liberal and wise promoters of this relief, perhaps the most impor- 
tant measure that can be adopted for the general good of the 
United Kingdom, and for the special benefit of the county of Dum- 
fries among others. It would provide for the health, comfort, and 
morals of the people, and in a bad season it would secure at home 
the grain that must be imported under the present system, and

paid for in gold to the ruin of our exchanges ; it would relieve 
wheat farmers and soils of competition against barley, reducmg 
the excess of Ybeat, and rendering it worth cultivatmg ; it would 
improve the soil on the best plan, and enrich the pastures, all 
which is obstructed by the present most improper system. 

1-2. The high multures at corn-m,ills have become oppressive ; 
and the owners of mills have seen this, and commonly relieved 
their own tenants, leaving them at liberty to carry their grain to 
any mill, and trusting to free trade for a due regulation of the rates 
of mill services. This would be all very well if mills were so thick 
set, and so good, as, without inconvenience, to give a free choice ; 
but the distance of some of them and other circumstances prevent 
this intended benefit, and when any rate may be demanded at the 
mills, there is no certain rule, and there can be no transgression. 
The old compensation for both multures and services often comes 
to a ninth of the grain ; and frequently about an eighteenth is ac- 
tually demanded and taken for oats ground into meal. The fair 
proportion is now practically settled at some of the best mills, be- 
ing half a stone of meal for kiln-drying sixty bushels of grain, and 
the forty- one stone of meal for the mill dues. It should never ex- 
ceed this, as the most intelligent millers themselves now confess ; 
and if all the offal of barley be returned to the farmers, fourpence 
the bushel for grinding is fair enough. The. dues for wheat are 
generally more uniform and fair ; but landholders, whose farms are 
thirled to mills belonging to others, can now insist on a commuta- 
tion of the multures, by a Sheriff-court process, on the average of 
seven years, and then their lands will be free to cultivation to any 
extent, and at any mills they will only have to pay for the ordinary 
dues as above-mentioned. These are matters of importance in 
this county. 

13. The union of Great Britain loith Ireland has not yet been 
attended with any benefit to the county of Dumfries. Increasing 
numbers of half-bred cattle, and quantities of inferior produce of 
land, have interfered in the markets, prematurely drawn away 
from the Irish population. Great numbers of poor people also 
come over as half or common beggars ; and if labourers from Ire- 
land happen to be employed, they commonly leave improper bur- 
dens, or an immoral taint behind them. Exceptions there are, in- 
deed, but these are very few in number. 

14. The poor of Dumfries-shire are commonly well attended 
to ; and, except out of two or three parishes, few of hem wander

abroad as common begoars. The system of assessments is neither 
very general nor very burdensome ; and in some parishes one-half 
per cent, or 10s. for every L. 100 of land- rent, put in voluntarily in 
aid of the collections, &amp;c. have been found sufficient as a help to 
support the poor in their own houses,— the most needful getting 
about L. 1 per quarter, and others less. On this plan they may 
be supported with this aid and their own efforts, and so as not to 
be idle, discontented, or profligate. Dissenters do not generally 
apply their collections for the support of the poor. 

15. Many vagrants from all quarters, and especially from the 
large towns, but most of all from Ireland, and latterly a few even 
from England, wander over and infest this county, almost always 
under false pretences, and raising contributions from the farmers 
and others, many times above all that these contribute to the poor 
of the parish; and it is vain to send them back to their own coun- 
tries or towns, or to inflict on them any statutory punishments. 
The only simple and effective plan is, to appoint a few houses in 
which to give them bread for their subsistence merely in passing 
through, and to refuse them supplies at every other. One class of 
vagrants, carried about in barrows or carts, it is cruel and disgraceful 
in their own parishes to send out, and illegal and unjust to burden 
the public so heavily with their conveyance alone, exclusive of their 
support; and the rule of a late respectable Sheriff ought to be 
adopted, in, sending every such person back to the place from which 
he found entrance into this county. 

16. The parish schools, though placed by the act, 1803, on a bet- 
ter foundation, and gradually improving, are not sufficient to edu- 
cate the augmented population. A greater nunjber of schools are 
wanted, and the act above quoted should be amended, so far, at 
least, as to give sufficient accommodation in houses. It would be 
very useful also, if landholders would act along with the ministers 
of parishes at examinations. The improved modes of teaching are 
introducing slowly ; but assistants for this purpose would be neces- 
sary in aid of the principal teachers. Model schools would prepare 
these assistants, and render them more useful. The schools in 
Dumfries have been duly patronized, and also those at Annan, 
Moffat, and other places. The school of Closeburn was eminent 
at one time, and that of Caerlaverock is still well attended. A 
great error occurred in fixing the qualification of electors of parish 
teachers at L. 100 Scots valued rent; for in the Highlands, there 
are estates below that valuation, yet returning in land rents far

above L 100 sterling. This ought to have been the amount of 
qualification; and the act 1803 should now be extended to 
schools in burghs. Presbyteries ought not both to be libellers 
and judges, because there is no appeal from their sentences and 
therefoie they ought never to prosecute; or, if they do, there should 
be a privilege of appeal, as formerly, to the higher church courts, 
in whom the jurisdiction has been adjudged finally to rest 

1 7. Dissenters are not very numerous in Dumfries-shire. 1 he Ua- 
'tholic population reside mostly near Dumfries, and also the fami- 
lies of the Protestant Episcopal persuasion. Secession and Keliet 
chapels are dispersed in various quarters, and some belonging to 
the Consistent Old Seceders, now denominated Cameromans, or 
the Reformed Presbytery. In the county town of Dumfries, Dis- 
senters are more numerous than in other places, and in a higher 
proportion to the Established Church. It is not thought that in 
the whole county their number is above ten in the hundred; and 
in the parish where this is written, there are not so many as ten 
out of a thousand of population ; and of these, most part, or the 
whole, have been seen occasionally in the parish church. One 
congregation in Dumfries, with their minister, have joined them- 
selves to the Established Church ; and above forty other congre- 
gations of the Old Burghers have made a movement of this de- 
scription elsewhere. 

18. The church lands of Scotland were at one time considered 
equal to one-half of the whole in value ; and all this enormous pro- 
perty, excepting the insignificant portions of glebe lands, went to 
the Crown, and was mostly disposed in grants to the barons. The 
Teinds were solemnly declared by Parliament to be " the pat ri- 
momj of the church and being valued once for all by the act 
1633, the amount of the teinds could not be very great, if decrees 
were early taken out and preserved. Besides all this, many of the 
parishes were annexed to others and suppressed ; and the ministers 
being declared to be stipendiary, the Court of Teinds only award- 
ed reasonable stipends out of the teinds; the surplus or free teinds 
being left gratuitously with titulars having Crown rights, or with 
patrons, yet always liable by law, and also in practice, to be ex- 
hausted for stipends and augmentations. Pleritors might purchase 
the free teinds of their lands, at nine years' purchase to the titu- 
lars, and six years to the patrons ; and yet the free teinds over all 
Scotland would endow all the churches, though many new ones 
were built, and new parishes erected. This power the Court of 



576 



GENERAL OB.sER VATIONS 



Teinds formerly possessed, and it is more necessary than ever tliat 
it be now restored. 

19. It would then be a simple matter to consider all the surplus 
temds in Scotland as one general fand out of which to grant ne- 
cessary endowments ; only respecting vested rights, in the minis- 
ters to be preferred to augmentations, and in heritors who had pur- 
chased lately, to be allowed for the remaining years not compen- 
sated; giving to all persons due compensation, in so far as they 
could show it to be due to them bona fide for payments legally 
made. In this way, endowments could be settled out of the gene- 
ral fund of surplus teinds, by decree of the proper court, without 
calling on government, or burdening the public with yearly grants. 
On this plan, also, heritors would be no parties against ministers, 
and augmentations might be sued for, simply by petition, without 
litigation : and in this case, the whole of the annoying, expensive, 
and unsatisfactory striking of the fiars, in order to ascertain the sti- 
pends yearly, would be superseded as unnecessary ; provided that, by 
legislative act, the amount of stipends already fixed by decree were 
ascertained in money, once for all, by the average fiars of Linlith- 
gowshire, for a proper number of years preceding : And it would 
then, of course, fall to the Court to award stipends to all parish mi- 
nisters, including those of the smaller livings, that justice might 
also be done to them, as to all others, without litigation, and con- 
sequently without bad feeling or expense. 

20. About thirty years ago, a movement was made among the land 
proprietors in several counties of Scotland against the jurisdiction of 
this church; but it was not encouraged by men in power, and it soon 
passed away. Astatement, simply and shortly drawn up, of the num- 
bers, duties, and stipends of the ministers was published in 1807, 
and, being mostly founded on undoubted facts, no answer to it was 
ever made. On the contrary, various important suggestions contained 
in it were carried into effect by the Legislature, and yet it still re- 
mains, to be declared, \st, that when the teinds are exhausted, the 
expense of communion elements may be awarded out of the stock; 
and 2d, that when a grass glebe has not been obtained, the fair 
compensation may be granted, instead of the trifling equivalent of 
former times, now quite illusory. As to processes for augmenta- 
tions of stipend, and the proper fund out of which to grant them, 
it will be seen to be more and more just and reasonable, to pro- 
vide for all these out of the general fund of free or surplus teinds 
.to be modified by the Court of Teinds on simple petitions. Exten-

is now absolutely necessary, in order to take in the vast masses 
of i'onorant poor ; and what mean of providing for this, more just 
or proper, is it possible to conceive, than the general application 
of all the teinds, being the declared patrimony of the church 

21. The Police of Dumfries-shire has been very weak since the 
red'uction of all the armed force of the county. In the year 1812, 
this force amounted to two battalions of local mihtia of 719 men 
in each ; a separate battalion of 400 men ; and three troops of yeo- 
manry cavalry, consisting of 120 men ; a force in all, of 1958 men. 
The reduction of the yeomanry force was injudicious, and also that 
of the miUtia staff; because the known and total want of an arm- 
ed force actually encourages crime ; and then it also prevents ef- 
fective means of apprehension and punishment. It is, indeed, most 
honourable to the character of the people of this county, that, in such 
circumstances, atrocious crimes are so seldom committed ; and no 
one doubts the blessed influence of religious principle and education, 
both founded in the word of God, in preventing gross crimes ; but 
still there ought to be a company of yeomanry in each of the dis- 
tricts, and this force would cost little to Government, and would 
give support to the magistracy in case of need. There ought also 
to be a new and more efficient constabulary force, and a legal pri- 
son in each of the larger towns of the county, with a reasonable 
and less reluctant compensation for expenses in maintaining the 
peace of the community out of proper funds. 

22. The Domestic Animals, or live-stocks, have been greatly im- 
proved, consisting chiefly of Galloway cattle and of Cheviot sheep; 
Ayrshire cows for the dairy, and short-horned cattle for early feed- 
ing, with half-bred sheep, a cross of the Leicester, have been getting 
into favour, in suitable places ; and the quantity of milk, early feed- 
ing, and length and weight of wool, are now important considera- 
tions with farmers. The breeds of horses, pigs, and poultry are 
too little attended to by many farmers. 

23. The Sea Jlshings of the Solway Frith are of little use to this 
county, white fish not being duly sought for ; and the salmon fish- 
ings of the rivers having been ruined by stake-nets at their mouths, 
which, though allov/ed by some old Scottish acts, ought to have been 
repealed at the Union of the Kingdoms, or to be considered as no 
longer in force under the altered modes of using them. 

24. A want of employment, especially for aged females, and chiefly 
in winter, has been much complained of ; but why not attempt some 
jwirts of the manufactures of the blind in Glasgow and Edinburgh

25. All the most useful wJiite and great crops that suit Dum- 
fries-shire are now well known. Wheat has been overdone, be- 
cause barley was discouraged by unwise and unjust exactions; and 
when these are removed, the culture of wheat thus relieved will 
become remunerative, if the rashness of legislation allow it to be 
so. The most suitable varieties of wheat, barley, and oats, are 
now known, and to discourage the culture of them would be a na- 
tional misfortune, as they cannot be too much encouraged for all 
sorts of useful manufacture, and for the purposes of feeding live- 
stock ; and in the surplus thus applied in good years, we have a 
resource against bad seasons far better than in any imported grain, 
while the benefit of a rise in price goes to the home grower. 

26. The separation of weeds from seed-corn, and the de- 
struction of weeds in the land, are now better understood ; and we 
seldom see a field destroyed by corn marigold or by spurry, as 
was too common in former times. The system of rotations of 
crops is more perfect, as two white crops are seldom allowed in 
immediate succession, and the fallows are better worked. But still 
the ox-eye f viz. Chrysanthemum Leucanthemiim,  though a con- 
gener of the gule, is not to be destroyed in the same way ; being a 
strongperennial, which requires to be pulled by hand, when its flowers 
first appear — an operation that a few children can soon perform — 
and the couch grass, Triticum rejjens, is best extirpated when, after 
a fallow, there is a continued pasturage of three years. No decent 
farmer now allows ragweed and thistles to form and scatter their 
seeds by the wind, but they cut them down when in early flower. 
The seeds of many weeds are separated from grain by floating 
them off in water before sowing ; and many farmers prefer to pas- 
ture the first crop of grass instead of cutting it for hay.' Even the 
smoothing of the land by stoning and rolling allows the scythe to 
follow in cutting the corn, which enlarges the bulk of straw by at 
least a fourth part, and this tells materially in the litter, and the 
manure and crops of another year ; all which leads to a better and 
more perfect system of agriculture. 

27. But though agriculture is the great field of employment 
and subsistence by means of our home resources, and provides 
most of the materials of subsistence for the population at large, 
rash and selfish plans are constantly agitated, which would lead to 
discourage agriculture, and to destroy the immense capital em-

barked in it ; and though the warehousing of foreign corn on bond 
pre-occupies the capital and granaries of merchants, this is not 
deemed sufficient, unless the grain now on bond be allowed to be 
taken out without payment of duty, and contrary to law, under 
pretence of exporting the meal ; a proposal fraught with farther 
depreciation to the grain of this country, by throwing into the 
markets fraudulently a great deal of ill-preserved corn ground into 
meal, and unfit and unsafe for use ; and certainly if the law be at 
all in force, this project ought at once and decidedly to be repro- 
bated. Nothing can more speedily and certainly hurt the interests 
of the manufacturers, and even those of commerce, all which are 
confessedly and mutually connected, than the selfish and ignorant 
policy of those who, by crude theories and rash projects, would bring 
into peril the greatest of all British interests, and with them the 
comforts and morals, and even the support of a great proportion 
of our population. The most pressing claims of the British farmers 
ought to be urgently brought forward; and as a board of trade has 
been eminently useful, the present seems the time also to renew 
what did much good before, and was without necessity suppressed, 
— a Board of Agriculture. It is to be feared, indeed, that before 
anything can be done, farmers may sink into apathy and ruin. 

28. The Dumfries-shire Flora varies in different places, accord- 
ing to the nature of the soil, subsoil, and elevation, with the modes 
of culture. Artificial cultivation has altered and improved barren 
heaths, and made them rich in white clover, now become indige- 
nous there by the use of lime and marl. Peat mosses, utterly 
barren, or yielding only tufts of heath or of bog cotton, have 
been turned into meadows, rich in productive crops of hay. Lands 
that were unfit to produce white oats or barley, are now, in due 
order, productive in both. Stiff lands covered by whins now pro- 
duce crops of wheat, and gravelly soils covered with broom, now 
yield crops of oats or barley, followed by sown grasses. Lime 
has been extensively effectual as a manure in this county ; and on 
coarse lands, where it was not formerly applied, there is great 
need of lime, if the farmers could afford the outlay. Marl has 
been found expensive in taking out and carting it on lands, and 
composts are liable to the same objection. Burnt clay has gone 
out of use, and bone manure has come into favour, being so 
easily carried ; but the question now is, not so much what ma- 
nure would suit best, as what the farmer can afford to apply. The 
old grey oat, full of long awns, has given way to good white oats, of 



580 GENfiRAL OBSERVATIONS, &amp;C. 

which early varieties are in use, dividing the labours of seed-time 
and harvest, and ripening on late and cold soils. The gardener's 
flora has also, but on a smaller scale, been cultivated and improved. 
Our wild-flowers are sometimes attractive, especially when the bees 
enjoy the full tide of richness and beauty in the clover fields, or 
on the purpled heaths ; and every watered and rocky cleugh has 
its indigenous and beautiful flowers, and the natural meadows are 
also beautiful and attractive in season. 

29. The Apiary is too little considered ; but no farmer or cot- 
tager should want bees, especially as a mode of obtaining the purest 
honey without killing the bees, is known and simple ; that is, when 
the hive is about to cast the first or second time, opening a hole 
of from four to six inches diameter in the top, and setting on an 
empty skep above, which will soon be filled, and may be removed, 
and the place closed up in due time. A bee-master should have 
bushes in his garden, and flowering herbs. Bees may be over- 
stocked, but in conveying the pollen of plants, they may be useful 
in promoting the economy of nature.

PUESBYTEnY OF KIRKCUDBRIGHT, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY. 

THE REV. JOHN M'MHXAN, MINISTER. 



L_ToPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HiSTORY. 

Name. It seems nearly certain that the name of this parish, 

which, at different times, has been variously spelled, was derived 
from the famous Saint Cuthbert. The ancient parish church 
stood in a burying-ground about a quarter of a-mile to the east of 
the town, and was dedicated to the Northumbrian Saint, as were 
several other places of worship, both in England and Scotland. 
The burying-ground still retains the name of Saint Cuthbert's 
church-yard. The name of the parish is but a slight change from 
Kirk-Cuthbert, the Church of Saint Cuthbert. 

Extent Boundaries Sfc. — The parish consists of three ancient 
parishes, namely, Kirkcudbright, Galtway, and Dunrod ; Kirk- 
cudbright lies on the north, Galtway in the centre, and Dun- 
rod on the south. The two latter parishes were annexed to Kirk- 
cudbright about the year 1683, but their church -yards, which are 
still used, retain the ancient appellations of Galtway and Dunrod 
church-yards. 

The modern parish of Kirkcudbright approaches the form of 
an oblong square, the west side protruding at the burgh and St 
Mary's Isle. It is bounded on the north by the parishes of Kel- 
ton and Rerwick ; on the east, by Rerwick ; on the south, by the 
Solway Frith ; • and on the west, by Borgue, Twynholm, and 
Tongland, the centre of the river Dee forming this boundary line 
till it passes St Mary's Isle, south of which it expands into an es- 
tuary. The extreme length of the parish, from the march of Kirk- 
bride on the north to Balmae head on the south, is upwards of 
8 miles, and its extreme breadth, from the east side of the estate 
of Gribdae to a bend in the Dee at the town of Kirkcudbright, is 
about 3 miles. Its superficial area contains about '23 square 
miles or upwards of 15,000 imperial acres.

the History of Galloway.

Topogruphical Appearances, Soil, 8fc. — That part of the parish 
which consists of the tract of Uvnd skirting the Deo, from the low- 
er bridge of Tongland to a little below Torrs' Luke, is for the 
most part level, and imtil it reaches a point south of the town of 
Kirkcudbright, opposite St Mary's Isle, is generally of a good 
clay, loamy, or mossy soil ; but a long ridge of gravel and sand ac- 
cumulated upon a clay bottom is found upon that part of this 
tract called the Stirling Acres, which is situated within the terri- 
tories of the burgh of Kirkcudbright, close to the bank of the river. 
Beyond that point, the soil is of a dry gravelly nature, and the 
whole is capable of producing excellent crops of grain ; but the 
Earl of Selkirk's park and the fields belonging to the burgh on 
the river side, are in permanent grass. lu the ancient parish of 
Dunrod, there is a tract of land of surpassing fertility, measuring 
about 180 acres, called " the Milton Parks of Dunrod." These 
the plough has not disturbed for nearly a century, during which 
time they have been kept constantly in pasture for black cattle. 
From these parks 120 head of three and four years' old cattle are 
annually sent to St Faith's market. As a proof of the nutritive 
qualities of the grass of these lands, it may not be out of place to 
state that, for a period of five years previous to Martinmas 1840, 
during which time they were in the hands of the proprietor, who 
stocked them with cattle of the pure Galloway breed, the public 
annual sales attracted dealers from remote parts of the country, 
who were glad to purchase the cattle at almost any price, in order, 
as the phrase is, to top their droves in the English markets. The 
rest, and by far the most extensive portion of the parish, is, with 
the exception of a considerable breadth of arable land arid some 
meadow ground, of an undulating or broken surface, in some pla- 
ces hilly. This part of the parish rises gradually northward to an 
elevation apparently of 400 feet above the level of the sea. In 
what may be called the hilly part there are some moors of small 
extent covered partially by heather and a species of furze called 
catwhins. These moors are not arable, but they afford tolerable 
pasture for cattle and sheep. The undulating or broken surface, 
which is chiefly near the centre of the parish, consists partly of a 
succession of hillocks termed knolls, of no great height, sometimes 
sloping gently, sometimes rather precipitously, and forming obtuse 
angles with the narrow spaces of level ground which intervene. 
These knolls are of a dry kindly soil resting upon rotten rock, and 

afford excellent pasture. They are curiously belted from base to

summit by paths at distances of less than a yard, formed by cat- 
tle or sheep feeding around their sides. They yield abundant 
shelter as well as food, and might be subjected to the operations 
of the plough, were it not that their inconvenient forms would 
greatly increase the labour of tillage. There are other eminences 
of greater magnitude than these productive hillocks. They are 
called Drums in the language of the country, but their soil is of 
inferior quality. It consists of a poor shallow surface resting up- 
on a bed of tilly clay. This forms what agriculturists call a re- 
tentive bottom; and is cold, wet, and uncongenial, and difficult of 
improvement. Among these varieties of surface, there exist large 
tracts of excellent arable land, consisting of a light friable mould 
upon a sharp gravelly subsoil. These are regularly ploughed and 
make good returns to the farmer. There are also some, although 
not extensive, meadows yielding annually abundant natural crops 
of what is called " bog hay," which is carefully stored for winter 
fodder. Upon the whole, though by far the larger portion of the 
parish may be considered arable, and in reality is subjected to a 
rotation of crops, yet it seems to be acknowledged that the nature 
of the soil is more suitable for grazing, and that the chief cause of 
the present large extent of tillage is the necessity for providing 
winter provender to the cattle, the meadow grounds being inade- 
quate to supply a sufficiency of food for their sustenance. 

Climate, c. — The climate of this parish is mild. The pre- 
vailing winds are from the south and south-west. There are often 
heavy, and sometimes long-continued falls of rain, and, except 
during some rare summers, frequent showers. Indeed, the soil in 
general cannot bear a continuance of drought without exhibiting 
its injurious effects upon vegetation. Although the atmosphere, 
especially in the winter and spring months, is not unfrequently 
charged with moisture, and the town which stands but a very lit- 
tle above the level of the sea, on the brink of the river, is subject 
to fogs, yet the parish is generally healthy. Colds, rheumatism, 
and consumption are probably the most prevalent disorders, but 
typhus occasionally breaks out, though seldom with much violence. 

Rivers, Streams, Sc. — The only river connected with the parish 
of Kirkcudbright is the river Dee, — Deva of the Romans. This 
river consists of three united streams, namely, the Deugh, the 
Ken, and the Dee, with their several tributaries ; and it is curi- 
ous to remark, that the two former have been deprived of their

names ii their progress to the sea, and assumed that of t]eir con- 
fluent the Dec. 

The Deugh, which rises in the mountains of Carsphairn, upon 
the borders of Ayrshire, after a long course receives into its chan- 
nel, at the lowest point of the parish, the lesser stream of the Ken, 
which rises in the mountains, on the confines of the three counties 
of Dumfries, Ayr, and Kirkcudbright. But, in return for this 
kindly reception, the Deugh is ungratefully robbed of its name, and 
the united streams take the appellation of the Water of Ken, the 
smaller of the two. This name is preserved until the river passes 
Kenmure Castle in the parish of Kells, after which, expanding 
into a beautiful and romantic lake, it is called the Loch of Ken, 
till at the point of Airds, in that parish, it receives the Dee, which, 
issuing from Loch Dee, in the parish of Minnigafif, near the march 
of Kells, debouches at that parish, and nearly at right angles into 
the Loch of Ken. Here the Ken pays for its previous usurpa- 
tion, for in its turn its title becomes extinct, and the Dee, a much 
smaller river, carries its name into the confluent streams, which 
are thenceforward denominated the Water of Dee, until lost in the 
waves of the Sol way. 

The Dee runs along the western boundary of the parish of 
Kirkcudbright from its north end at March-cleuch, about a mile 
above the old bridge of Tongland. Its course, down to the 
new bridoe, is beautifully romantic. It rushes over a rockv 
bed of considerable width, and its banks are rocky, rugged, 
and precipitous, but on both sides mantled with natural wood. 
In summer, its margins are sweetly bedecked with wild flowers. 
To saunter here and listen to the mournful sound of the passing 
stream, is to visit nature in her loveliest and most interesting form. 
But it is in its swollen state that the Dee appears to the greatest 
advantage. Few objects can surpass in terrific grandeur this ma- 
jestic river, when its torrent flood rushes along with appalling fury, 
like rolling masses of snow, forming a series of foaming cataracts, 
above which the sunbeams are reflected and refracted into mimic 
rainbows in the hovering spray, f

From the lower bridge of Tongland, taking the course of the 
river, its run is about eight miles to the Solway. The highest 
spring tides reach to the Lin mentioned in the preceding hues. 
When the tide is full, the river becomes a picturesque object from 
the top of Tongland hill, also from the higher grounds of Cul- 
doch, the Borelands, and other places in the parish of Knkcud- 
bright. Its links and windings, from its confluence with the Tarff, 
at Cumpston, gave it the appearance of a fine chain of lakes sweep- 
ing round the town of Kirkcudbright and St Mary's Isle. The 
Dee is navigable for ships of any size as far as the town of Kirk- 
cudbright, and for vessels of 200 tons burden to the lower bridge 
of Tongland. A brook, the sources of which are marshy ground, 
runs betwixt this parish and Rerwick from Bombie, until it talis 
into the Solway at the west side of Mullock- bay, where sometimes 
vessels of small burden lie in fine weather. This brook crosses 
the road to Dundrennan at Ringligget, and is there called Ring- 
burn, probably from its occupying the line of march : it falls into 
the sea under the name of MuUockburn. 

Another brook, dividing the parish into two not very unequal 
parts, rises in the north end of it, at or near the march of Kelton. 
It is first called Hartburn, passing southward through a farm of 
that name, then, after receiving a rivulet of the same size, called 
Gribdae-burn, it obtains the name of Bucklandburn, and is aug- 
mented on one side by a rill called Clownstanegill, and on the 
other by one issuing from a ravine named Glenlay Heugh. Pro- 
ceeding onwards in its course, the brook at last gets the name of 
Grangeburn, under which it falls into the Dee to the south of St 
Mary's Isle. 

These brooks abound with yellow trout, and in the end of 
autumn numbers of sea trout and herling ascend the streams in 
order to deposit their spawn. In the upper end of the farm of 
Jordieland, where it joins the contiguous farms of Culdoch and 
Blackstockarton, there is a loch of considerable size, stocked with 
a species of yellow trout equal to that of Loch Leven. They

• 1 he Dee at different times assumes very dissimilar appearances ; at one time it 
swells into a fearful size, and at another dwindles into a scarcely perceptible rill. In 
I822, it rose to a height of nearly twenty feet of solid water, and could hardly find a 
passage through the arches of the old bridge of Tongland, which appeared to vibrate, 
and in 1826 it sunk so low that its wliolo waters were confined within a channel ol 
six inches in depth, and ten inches in breadth.

weigh from 1 to 3 pounds, their fish is red and of dehcious flavour. 
They, however, try the skill and patience of the professor of the 
gentle art, as they are very shy and difficult to take. The parish is 
plentifully watered, there being many other rills and an abundant 
supply of springs of pure water within its bounds. In the burgh 
roods, chalybeate springs have been discovered, which, however, 
are little valued, and have not been minutely analyzed, although 
their taste would indicate metallic impregnation fully as strong as 
is possessed by some distant and celebrated fountains. The line 
of coast from Mullock bay on the east to Torrs' point, opposite the 
island of Little Ross on the west, extends about 3 miles. It is 
bold and rocky, except for a short space immediately below the 
farm house of Howell, and at a point east of that called " the 
Haen," i. e. Haven, in Balmae. Raeberry, near the east end of 
the line, rears a lofty head facing the sea, forming a frightful pre- 
cipice, the haunt of ravens, goshawks, and other birds of prey; it 
is also frequented by the red-legged jackdaw 

In a precipice on the Balmae shore, to the west, and not far 
from the mouth of the Dee, is a remarkable natural cavern called 
Torrs' Cove, which extends 60 feet into the rock. The entrance 
is narrow, being little more than sufficient to admit a man on his 
hands and knees to pass into the cave, then gradually widening, 
it rises to a height of more than 12 feet, after which it again con- 
tracts to the farthest end. The roof is pendant with icicles of 
stalactite, the constant dropping from which forms on the floor 
stalagmite crustations. The door is said to have been originally 
built with stone and to have had a lintel at the top which is now 
buried in the ruins. The cave is thought to have been sometimes 
used as a hiding-place in former times. 

Upon the rocks towards the sea, is found abundance of samphire. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The geological formation of the pa- 
rish is greywacke, with occasional masses and dikes of porphyry. 
The latter substance is of a red colour and very compact, and ex- 
ists in masses above Culdoch and upon Jordieland moor ; and 
upon the south side of Jordieland loch there is a small round- 
ed eminence, where its junction with the greywacke may be 
seen. The two rocks in this place are much co-mingled, and 
the appearance of both greatly changed, the greywacke being 
indurated and blackened, and the crystals of the porphyry much 
larger than usual. Red porphyry protrudes in the Barhill also, 
and on the farms of Boreland, Little Kirkland, and Sypland. 
The most of the heights in the north of the parish arc capped

with it, and several dikes of it cross the Dee above Tongland 
bridge. Along the shore of Kirkcudbright and the Solway Frith, 
there are at least sixteen trap dikes. Of these, two are amygda- 
loid ; several are compact felspar; and the remainder claystone 
porphyry, and felspar porphyry. These dikes are all more or less 
tortuous, and in two cases they send veins into the greywacke. 
In front of a recess in the precipitous part of the shore, a little to 
the north of Torrs' point, a dike of felspar porphyry shoots up into 
a column of about 20 feet in height, with changed greywacke 
clinging to its sides. Another dike of felspar porphyry contains 
kernel-looking masses, some of them an inch in diameter, filled 
with a soft white mineral resembling gypsum, surrounded by a 
shell of a harder mineral. In one of the dikes of amygdaloid, the 
kernels are uniformily largest in the centre, and gradually di- 
minish towards the sides, till the dike becomes a greenstone, 
showing the effect of the more rapid cooling of the parts nearest 
the greywacke in lessening the size of the gas bubbles in the 
volcanic matter, at the time of its protruding. There are like- 
wise seen on the shore several wide fissures, filled with angular 
pieces of greywacke, imbedded in a cement of felspar, or calca- 
reous spar, forming a breccia ; and adjoining a dike of felspar por- 
phyry on the shore west of Raeberryhill, is a tortuous dike of 
quartz from two to five feet thick. Of these dikes the claystone 
porphyry are highest above the greywacke, then the felspar por- 
phyry ; and the compact felspar, is on a level with the greywacke 
or sinks below it. There are numerous veins of calcareous spar 
visible along the shore, and a few of barytes and quartz ; and 
sometimes these are coloured red with oxide of iron. 

Several trap dikes exist in the interior of the parish ; one 
is seen in Gribdae, one crosses the road near the Brockloch, very 
much desintegrated, and another is visible north of Lochfergus 
House. On the shore of Little Balmae the grains composing the 
greywacke increase in size, consisting principally of angular frag- 
ments of quartz ; and here, but for its argillaceous cement, it would 
be a gritstone. Here are also large nodules of fine grained com- 
pact greywacke imbedded in slaty strata of the same rock. The 
coarse greywacke is seen also protruding in front of Howell House. 
On Howell shore, several fossils have been found belonging to the 
genus Orthoceras. In various places along the shore, the ripple 
mark may be distinctly seen on the face of the strata. The 
whole of the greywacke on the shore is very much broken and

contorted, and varies much in dip and direction, though the for- 
mer generally approaches to vertical. On Balmae shore the grey- 
wacke forms a good building stone ; and numbers of the large 
boulders of granite and greenstone, scattered plentifully along 
the shores of the Manxman's lake, have been broken up and re- 
moved for this purpose. There are several caverns on the shore 
hollowed out by the waves of the Solway, but the Torrs' Cove, 
often called Dirk Hatterick cove, is considerably above high- 
water mark. 

Zoology. — No very rare animals exist in the parish. The fox 
and the otter are occasionally met with, though the damage now 
done by them is by no means considerable. The badger, for some 
years past, has not been observed, but there are still a few of them 
in the district. The number of both polecats and weasles has 
been of late years much diminished ; whilst hares and rabbits have 
amazingly increased. The bittern is perhaps the rarest bird to 
be found in the parish. Only one has been seen in it during 
the last thirteen years. It is solitary in its habits, and frequents 
marshy grounds, living upon the small animals which exist in such 
situations. The chough, or red-legged crow, is also seldom seen, 
except sometimes upon the shore. Berries and insects are its 
food. The only hawks that breed here are the sparrow-hawk, 
merlin, and kestrel. The goshawk is sometimes a visitor, and he 
has been known to build on the Large Ross. The buzzard annu- 
ally appears, chiefly in autumn, and so does the harrier. Only 
one peregrine falcon has been lately seen, which was killed and 
stuff'ed. There is abundance of pheasants and partridges, with a 
little black game and grouse. Woodcocks are much scarcer now 
than formerly, owing, it is thought, to the destruction of their 
nests, the eggs of this bird being held in high estimation. Lap- 
wings are still numerous, and breed in the district. The snipe is 
also an inhabitant of the parish, as well as the heron, but neither 
is common. The starling exists here, with all the. variety of birds, 
both indigenous and migratory, that are common in the country. 
There are various kinds of ducks and other water-fowl, such as 
the gannet, cormorant, puffin, sea-magpie, and four or five spe- 
cies of gulls. In severe winters, wild geese sometimes alight, and 
feed on Howell meadow, or the neighbouring shores. The Dee 
is celebrated for its salmon. It likewise contains grilse, sea and

river trout, herlings, cod, flounder, plaice, dab eels, lythe, sole, 
mullet, skate, lamprey, whiting, par, spirling. Pike and perch 
have been occasionally caught in the fresh water portion of the 
river and in the lower part are sometimes taken small herrings, 
haddocks, ling, mackerel, turbot, and shrimps, &amp;c. Lesser spot- 
ted sharks called here dog-hsh, angel-sharks, and porpoises have 
at intervals appeared, and been killed. Salmon and grilse pro- 
ceed up the Dee for the purpose of spawnmg, at all seasons of the 
year, but perhaps the principal run is during the month of July. 
They leave the fresh water again in the greatest numbers from the 
middle of February to the middle or end of March. The river 
exhibits the largest quantity of salmon-fry about the 12th of May. 
The shell- fish of the parish are, lobsters, crabs, rock-oysters, 
cockles, muscles, wilks, buckies, limpets, pipes. Mussels are much 
sought after by the poor, and may be collected on some rocks in 
pretty large quantities. On the Torrs' shore are seen, during spring 
tides,' considerable numbers of oysters. Buckies are here exten- 
sively used as baits for white fish ; they are therefore of much va- 
lue. Limpets and a kind of sand-worms are likewise used. 

There are few reptiles in the parish, and insects are not parti- 
cularly destructive. 

The following animals formerly existed, but have now disap- 
peared, viz. the urus, — an animal resembling a bull, — the wolf, the 
deer, the wild cat, and the eagle.

Forests or Plantations, — The plantations are composed princi- 
pally of oak, ash, elm, beech, plane, Spanish-chestnut, larch, 
Scotch-fir, spruce, and silver fir ; and partially of alder, birch, 
hornbeam, horse-chestnut, walnut, gean, maple, lime, laburnum, 
Huntingdon willow, poplar, balm of Gilead fir, and pinaster. 

There is little wood indigenous to the soil, with the exception 
of a few ash and mountain-ash trees in the glens of Glenlay and 
Bombie; and along the bank of the Dee, a little below and above 
the old bridge of Tongland. There are some oaks, in addition f o 
the ash and rowan ; and farther up the river, within Culdoch, in the 
march of Netherthird, there are a few birch. 

The other plants and shrubs natural to such localities are, the 
hazel, hawthorn, sloe, wild dog-wood, crab, black-saugh, whin, 
broom, buckie and bramble briars, rasp, honeysuckle, and ivy. 

There are a considerable number of beech-trees and some elms 
in St Mary's Isle, the circumference of the trunks of which reach 
8 and 9 feet, and several of them 1 1 feet. One oak is 10 feet, 
and a Spanish-chestnut 14 feet in circumference.  

On the farm of Kirkland, in the south Gotland field, is a plane 
tree, the circumference of which is 11 feet, and the spread of the 
top covers a circuit of 60 yards.

Historical Events. — The parish of Kirkcudbright is rich in his- 
torical events. The town is thought to have existed before the in- 
vasion of the Romans, and to have been known to them by the 
name of Benutium. Agricola, with his victorious army, pene- 
trated into the parish a. d. 8'i. He entered it on the north- 
east boundary, and having taken a British strength belong- 
ing to the Selgovae on the farm of Little Sypland, he encamped 
near Whinnyligget, about a mile from the captured fort. After re- 
ducing another strength on the farm of Meikle Sypland, the Ro- 
man army proceeded to Bombie, where they formed an encamp- 
ment. After wresting from their defenders several intervening fort- 
lets, they again encamped near the site of the old church of Dun- 
rod. Another short march placed them before the important fort- 



KIRKCUDBRIGHT.

ress of Caerbantorigum, which they also seized. This fortress, 
which may be considered the principal border garrison ol the Sel- 
oovae, stood on an eminence of about 250 feet high at Drummore. 
The Romans retained possession of it during the reigns of the An- 
tonines, or, as some think, for nearly 300 years. The inhabitants 
of the locality must have derived many advantages from the pre- 
sence of these more civilized andjndustrious foreigners ; for Agri- 
cola was particularly zealous in promoting improvement among the 
conquered tribes of Scotland. 

Whilst Malcolm IV., son of David I., was a minor, Fergus, the 
Lord of Galloway, whose palace stood on an island in Lochfergus, 
near the town of Kirkcudbright, abjured his connection with the 
Scottish crown, and asserted his independence as a sovereign 
prince. The King took up arms to chastise him, and twice invaded 
his rugged territories, but without success. Malcolm marched 
against the Galwegian chief a third time, with additional forces 
and redoubled ardour, and completely prevailed. In 1 160, Fer- 
gus resigned the Lordship of Galloway, and retiring into the abbey 
of Holyrood, next year died of grief. He bestowed upon this in- 
stitution the church and village of Dunrod, with the lands and 
church of Galtway. Fergus was a prince of great piety and some 
notoriety. He married Elizabeth, illegitimate daughter of Henry I., 
King of England, and was much at David's Court. He was 
ancestor of Bruce and Baliol, and from him the royal families of 
both France and England are descended, 

Fergus was succeeded by his two sons, Uchtred and Gilbert, 
between whom, according to the Celtic law, his dominions were 
divided. The brothers became mutually jealous of each other, 
and on the 22d of September 117'4, whilst Uchtred resided in his 
castle at Lochfergus, he was attacked by his elder brother, de- 
prived of his tongue and eyes, and murdered in a most barbarous 
manner. Uchtred, like his father, was distinguished for his piety ; 
he bestowed the church of Kirkcudbright upon the monks of Ho- 
lyrood, who enjoyed the tithes and revenues, whilst the cure was 
served by a vicar. 

The last in the male line of the ancient princes of Galloway was 
Allan, who died, in all probability, in the castle of Lochfergus, or 
Kirkcudbright Castle, and was buried in Dundrennan Abbey, 
founded by Fergus, his great-grandfather. 

During the competition for the crown of Scotland, Edward I., 
who was appointed umpire, committed the keeping of the castle

of Kirkcudbright, erected by one of the Lords of Galloway, ia 
Walter De Courry, and afterwards to Richard Seward, who, on 
the mandate of the English King, delivered it up to John Ba- 
liol, to whom the kingdom of Scotland was nominally awarded. 

After his defeat at Falkirk, the patriot Wallace took shipping 
at Kirkcudbright, and sailed to France with Maclellan of Bombie, 
ancestor of the noble family of Kirkcudbright, and about fifty 
faithful adherents. Edward I., in his career of conquest, reach- 
ed the town of Kirkcudbright, and took up his abode in the 
castle, where he remained with his queen and court for ten 
days, and made his usual oblations in the priory church. From 
the port of Kirkcudbright he sent into both England and Ire- 
land large quantities of wheat, to be made into flour for the use 
of his army. The Archbishop of Canterbury, attended by his 
learned dignitaries, clerks, and servants, followed Edward to Kirk- 
cudbright with a Papal bull ; but before his arrival the king had 
departed from the town. Bakers from Carlisle, and experienced 
fishermen with suitable nets, attended the royal army. 

Edward Bruce having subdued Galloway, received from his 
royal brother, as a reward of his important services, the Lordship 
of Galloway, with the castle of Kirkcudbright, and all Baliol's 
forfeited estates. This ruler granted to the priory of Whithorn 
the half of the salmon fishery of the Dee, near Kirkcudbright. 

In the reign of James II. Sir John Herries of Terregles applied 
to Douglas of Threave Castle for compensation for some robberies 
committed by the dependents of that powerful chief. The appli- 
cation was unsuccessful ; and he, aided by Maclellan of Bombie, 
made an inroad into the territories of the Earl, but his party was 
routed, and he himself taken prisoner, and executed in defiance of 
the king's command. The encounter is thought to have taken 
place about a mile and a-half from the town of Kirkcudbright, 
on the old road to Dumfries, at a place still called " Herries'. 
slaughter." 

The tutor of Bombie soon shared the same fate. Admittance 
having been obtained, either by force or treachery, into his castle 
of Raeberry, the principal residence of the family, he was seized, 
carried to Threave Castle, and beheaded, although Sir Patrick 
Gray, the King's messenger, had arrived to demand the custody 
of the prisoner. Douglas was stabbed by the king's own hand in 
the castle of Stirling on the 20th day of February 1452. 

In about three years after this event, James visited the town of 



KIRKCUDBRIOHT.  

Kirkcudbright to make arrangements for laying siege to the strong 
castle of Threave, the last place that held out for the Douglasses. 
The citizens afforded him assistance, having supplied, it is behev- 
ed, the iron from which Mons Meg was manufactured. Betore 
the fall of the Douglasses, the capital of Galloway remauied a 
buro-h of regality under their oppressive sway, but it was now cre- 
ated a royal burgh by a charter dated at Perth the 26th of October 
1455, the chief magistrate being styled alderman. The Maclel- 
lans of Bombie often held this office. After the battle of Teuton, 
in 1461, Kirkcudbright afforded shelter to the unfortunate Henry 
VI. of England and his high-minded queen. The King resided 
here until his indomitable consort visited Edinburgh to concert 
measures with the Scottish Government for regaining to her hus- 
band the English crown. On the 16th of April 1462, Margaret, 
with a convoy of four Scottish ships, sailed from Kirkcudbright to. 
Bretagne, in' France, and in 1403, the feeble Henry returned to 
England in disguise. It appears he had only four attendants with 
him in Scotland. 

In the spring of 1501, the town of Kirkcudbright had again the 
honour of a royal visit. James IV., in one of his numerous pil- 
grimages to the shrine of St Ninian at Whithorn, diverged thither, 
and, with his usual liberality to the clergy, bestowed L. 1 upon 
the priests, and L. 5, 5s. upon the friars, to buy a Eucharist. 

Thomas, Earl of Derby, a young, fiery, and warlike chief, hav- 
ino- succeeded to the sovereignty of Mar, to extend his fame and 
gratifv the hostile feelings of his subjects to the Scots, made a de- 
scent upon the shores of Galloway in 1507, at the head of a formi- 
dable body of furious Manxmen, and nearly destroyed the town of 
Kirkcudbright. For some years afterwards many of the houses 
remained in ruins. 

James IV. again visited the burgh in 1508, and was hospi- 
tably entertained by the inhabitants. On this occasion, he grant- 
ed them the castle of Kirkcudbright and its lands, which had 
reverted to the crown on the forfeiture of the Douglasses, on 
whom it had been bestowed in 1369 bv David II. This 
grant was confirmed by a charter in the following year, dated the 
26th of February ; and it is said to have been made on account of 
certain aids afforded to his grandfather, James II., when engaged 
in the reduction of Threave Castle, and for services to James him- 
self. 

On the 9th of September 1513, Sir William Maclellan of Bom- 
bie, the principal proprietor of the parish, was slain with a num- 



14 



KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE. 



ber of his dependents in the disasti 'ous battle of Flodden. His son 
fell in a feud by the hand of Gordon of Lochinvar, at the door of 
St Giles' Church, in Edinburgh. 

The Duke of Albany, regent of Scotland, and next heir to the 
crown, in 1523, enibarked at Brest in a fleet of eighty-seven ves- 
sels, and having escaped the English squadron, landed at Kirk- 
cudbright on the 7th of October, where he was joyfully received. 

During the minority of Mary Queen of Scots, the English hav- 
ing gained possession of Dumfries, summoned the town of Kirk- 
cudbright to submit to the authority of Edward VI. This demand 
being refused, a detachment of the invaders on horseback pro- 
ceeded to the town, under the command of Sir Thomas Carleton, 
to compel obedience or burn it. They reached their place of des- 
tination, a little before sunrise ; but the inhabitants had got no- 
tice of their approach, and, according to Sir Thomas's account, 
" barred their gates and kept their dikes ; for the town," he adds, 
" is diked on both sides, with a gate to the waterward, and agate 
at the overend to the fellward." The English alighted from 
their horses, and vigorously assailed the place ; but they could 
fnake no impression upon it. One man was killed within the walls 
by an arrow, and immediately some of the women began to be 
alarmed for the safety of their husbands. The tutor of Bombie, 
at the head of a party of his friends, now made his appearance, 
and fiercely attacked the besiegers ; but, after three of his men 
were killed and a number of them wounded or made prisoners, he 
thought it advisable to retire. Though only one of the English 
fell in the conflict, they did not venture to attack the town a se- 
cond time, but retired to Dumfries. 

After the destruction of the ill-fated Mary''s army at Langside, 
she fled into Galloway, accompanied by Lord Herries and his fol- 
lowers. Having travelled along the west side of the Ken, she 
crossed the Dee by a wooden bridge, thought to have been erect- 
ed by the Romans, near Tongland church, and entered the pa- 
rish of Kirkcudbright. Whilst her attendants were engaged in 
breaking down the bridge to prevent pursuit, she remained in a 
neighbouring cottage. The ruins which long existed in the farm 
of Culdoch were called " Dun's Wa's." The fugitive Queen re- 
mained three days in the district before proceeding to England. 

To avenge the death of Mary and his own wrongs, Philip, King 
of Spain, &amp;c. fitted out a stupendous fleet and collected a vast army 
for the invasion of Britain. The place fixed for the landing of 



KlUKCUDBHiGHT.

the Spanish troops was the harbour of Kirkcudbright. Lord 
Maxwell hurried home from Spain to arm his followers, and landed 
at the same place. The fate of the Spanish Armada is well known : 
it was defeated by the English fleet before it reached the destined 
port, and the elements completed its destruciion. 

James VI. appears to have been in Kirkcudbright when in pur- 
suit of Lord Maxwell ; for the burgh is in possession of a small 
silver gun, which, according to tradition, was presented to the in- 
corporated trades during his visit, that they might occasionally 
shoot for it, and by this means improve in the use of fire-arms, — 
then rapidly superseding the bow and arrow as implements of war. 
The year 1587 and the letters T. M. C, supposed to be the ini- 
tials of Thomas Maclellan of Bombie, are engraven on the barrel 
of this miniature fusee. The trinket, seven inches in length, has 
been shot for, only three times in the memory of the oldest person 
now living, \st, in 1781 ; 2d, on the 2'2d of AprilT830 ; and, t3d, 
on the 28th of June 1838, the day of the Queen's coronation. 
The capacious wassail bowl belonging to the burgh was filled and 
refilled on the joyful occasion. 

When Charles L visited Scotland to conciliate the fiivour of his 
northern subjects, he bestowed upon Sir Robert Maplellan of Bom- 
bie the title of Lord Kirkcudbright, and granted a new charter to 
the burgh dated the 20th of July 1633, which created the pre- 
sent corporation, consisting of a provost, two bailies, a treasurer, 
and thirteen councillors. In the Battle of Philiphaugh, John, 
tliird Lord Kirkcudbright commanded a regiment which he had 
raised at his own expense, chiefly among his tenants. It behaved 
with great bravery, and was awarded 15,000 merks out of Lord 
Herries's forfeited estates. 

In 1663, a serious riot took place in the parish at the introduc- 
tion of a curate. Commissioners were appointed to repair to the 
burgh, and make the most searching inquiry into the particulars 
of this contempt of authority. After examining a number of wit- 
nesses, they ordered Lord Kirkcudbright, John Carson, late pro- 
vost, John Ewart, who had been chosen provost, but had re- 
fused to accept of the office, and several women, to be carried 
prisoners to Edinburgh. Some of the rioters were imprisoned and 
afterwards fined ; and several of them were exposed at the market- 
cross of Kirkcudbright, with papers upon their ftices stating the 
nature of their crime. 

After the defeat of the insurgent Covenanters at Rullion Green 



KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE. 



in the Pentland Hills, Major M'CuUoch of Barholm, John Gor- 
don of Knockbrex, and Robert Gordon, his brother, were sen- 
tenced to be executed at Edinburgh, and their heads sent to Kirk- 
cudbright, to be exposed on the principal gate of the town. This 
sentence was put into execution. In 1684, two Covenanters, 
William Hunter and Robert Smith, who had been apprehended at 
Auchencloy, on the Dee, were brought to the town, where a jury 
being called, and the empty forms of a trial gone through, they 
were sentenced to be first hanged and then beheaded : this sen- 
tence was literally carried into effect. They were buried in Kirk- 
cudbright churchyard, and a stone still points out the place of in- 
terment. John Hallam, another Covenanter, was also tried and ex- 
ecuted in Kirkcudbright: his remains rest in the same churchyard. 

In 1685, Sir Robert Grierson of Lag surprised Johh Bell of 
Whiteside and some others on the hill of Kirkconnel, in the pa- 
rish of Tongland, and barbarously ordered them to be instantly 
put to death : he would not allow their bodies to be buried. Mr 
Bell was the only son of the heiress of Whiteside, who, after the 
death of his father, had married Viscount Kenmure. This no- 
bleman met Lag in company with Graham of Claverhouse on the 
street of Kirkcudbright. Kenmure accused Lag of cruelty, when 
he retorted in highly offensive language, which so provoked the 
Viscount, that he drew his sword and would have run it through 
the body of the persecutor, had not Claverhouse interfered and 
saved his life. The encounter happened near the door of an inn 
at the north end of the town. 

William's fleet, on its passage to Ireland, continued for some 
time wind-bound in the Bay of Kirkcudbright. He erected a 
battery on the eastern shore, some traces of which still remain. 

In 1698, a woman named Elspeth M'Ewen was brought to trial 
for witchcraft, condemned and burned to death near the town. 

On the 12th November 1706, the magistrates, councillors, and 
other inhabitants of the burgh petitioned Parliament against the 
Union. A riot afterwards took place. 

Previous to the Rebellion of 1715, Kirkcudbright seems ts 
have been fixed upon as the place where the Pretender was to 
land. So enthusiastic did the inhabitants become in the royal 
cause, that they sent a company of foot under the command of 
their late provost, to assist in the defence of Dumfries against the 
rebels, who intended vigorously to attack it. 

On the 1st of June 1750, Thomas Miller of Glenlee, Esq.,

advocate, first Steward-Depute of the stewartry of Kirkcudbright, 
passed sentence of death upon Henry Greig, accused of theft, 
house-breaking, and robbery. The execution took place in the 
vicinity of the ancient Gallow-hill, on an eminence at the side of 
the pubHc road. This was the last melancholy exhibition of a 
capital punishment that the burgh of Kirkcudbright has been 
called upon to witness. 

In the spring of 1778, the celebrated Paul Jones paid a visit 
to St Mary's Isle for the purpose of carrying off its noble owner, 
the Earl of Selkirk. Soon after he had effected a landing, he 
was informed by some labourers that his Lordship was in England. 
He then ordered his men to return to their boat ; but, observing 
on their countenances symptoms of dissatisfaction, he allowed the 
party, commanded by two lieutenants, to proceed to the mansion- 
house, and demand the Earl's silver-plate. The various articles 
were delivered to them by the Countess of Selkirk, and the party 
setting off without delay, reached their ship. The plate was 
bought at a considerable price by Paul Jones himself in France, 
and returned to her Ladyship in perfect safety. 

Maps, Sj-c. — The land-owners have maps, plans, or surveys of 
their properties, which tend to illustrate the antiquities of the pa- 
rish. 

Eminent Characters. — Exclusive of the eminent characters al- 
ready taken notice of, we may mention a few men who have done 
honour to Kirkcudbright by their talents and labours. 

In the reign of David II., John Carpenter, a Franciscan or 
Grey-friar belonging to the convent established at Kirkcudbright, 
was employed to fortify Dumbarton Castle. For this service he 
received from the King an annual pension of L.20 Sterling. He 
is said to have been an excellent engineer, and " dextrous at con- 
triving all instruments of war." 

John Barton, brother of the well known Andrew Barton, and 
son of the renowned sea captain of that name, who was slain by 
the Portuguese in the reign of James III., died and was buried 
in Kirkcudbright church-yard. 

John Welsh, son-in-law of John Knox, was minister of the 
parish. He was banished from Britain for his opposition to Epis- 
copal encroachment. By powerful intercession, the King at 
length allowed him to reside in London, where he died in 1622. 

KIRKCUDBRIGHT, B

KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE. 



John Maclellan, who wrote, in 1665, a description of Galloway 
in Latin for Blaeii's Atlas, which gained him some celebrity, was 
minister of Kirkcudbright. 

Dr Thomas Blacklock, who had been blind almost from in- 
fancy, was ordained to the pastoral charge of the parish of Kirk- 
cudbright in 1762. He was both an elegant writer and an amiable 
man. His settlement being strenuously opposed, he at length 
felt himself compelled to resign his living and retire to Edin- 
burgh. 

Basil William Lord Daer was the eldest surviving son of Dun- 
bar, Earl of Selkirk. About the year 1786, his father's advanced 
age prevented him from engaging personally in the improvement 
of his estates ; and, by a generous and merited act of confidence, 
he devolved the management of his property on his talented son. 
Lord Daer turned his attention to the study of rural economy in 
its various branches, and displayed much ability in the formation, 
and diligence in the execution, of his admirable plans. His ex- 
ertions, however, were not confined to the improvement of his fa- 
ther's estates ; they extended to the promotion of every measure 
of public utility. By his liberality, judgment, influence, and ex- 
ample, he induced the proprietors of the district to form proper 
roads, to erect suitable bridges, to lay out ornamental plantations, 
to build better farm-houses, and construct convenient offices. 
This celebrated nobleman died on the 5th of November 1794, at 
the early age of thirty-two years. Of Lord Daer, the History of 
Galloway thus speaks : — ' We cannot name this amiable and 
youthful nobleman without remarking, that his genuine distinction 
did not arise from the accidents of rank, influence, and fortune. 
He belonged to the aristocracy of nature — to the peerage of in- 
tellect ; for, if his useful and valuable life had been spared, the 
magnitude and buoyancy of his talents would have raised him to 
•eminence, and the south of Scotland to unexampled prosperity. 
We do not remember this truly great and good man, who, during 
his short and philanthropic career, gained the esteem, commanded 
the admiration, and riveted to himself the hearts of all by whom 
he was surrounded ; but well we remember, that in our boyhood, 
his name was never mentioned in the town of Kirkcudbright, with- 
out emotions of the liveliest enthusiasm and veneration. He set 
an example that has been widely followed, and the district in 
which he resided will long reap the fruits of his disinterested la- 
bours."

Thomas, Earl of Selkirk, was distinguished as a scholar, an 
author, and a politician. In the management of his estates, he 
followed the judicious plans devised by his brother. He died at 
Pau, in France, on the 8th of April 1820, having scarcely com- 
pleted the forty-ninth year of his age. 

James Wedderburn, Esq., Solicitor- General of Scotland, died 
in 1822, at St Mary's Isle, and was interred in Galtway church- 
yard.

Antiquities, British Forts, c. — In the parish of Kirkcudbright, 
there are many vestiges of British forts ; indeed, the whole eastern 
banks of the Dee, the line of demarcation between two hostile 
tribes, the Selgovae and Novantes, seem to have been studded with 
ancient fortifications. The most important in size and strength was 
Caerbantorigum, on the farm of Drummore. The hill on the top 
of which it stood commands a most extensive view both of land and 
water. The fort was surrounded by two ramparts, composed of earth 
and stone, and a double fosse, which remain almost entire, the ram- 
parts being still covered with heather. In the middle of the enclosure 
is a pit partially filled with stones. To what uses it may have 
been devoted, it is now impossible to conjecture. It has the appear- 
ance of a well. In a piece of marshy ground at some little dis- 
tance below the fort, is a large well, the sides built of stone, which 
some think supplied the garrison with water. At short dis- 
tances from the eminence are still observable traces of the hostile 
Roman camps. About a mile and a half from Drummore hill, there 
are the remains of another British fort, likewise of a circular form, 
on the farm of Milton. There are two hill fortlets near the old 
church of Galtway; and a hill on the farm of Meikle Syp- 

• The distinguished physician, Dr Maxwell Gartshore of London, was his son.

land exhibits the site of a pretty entire fort, of about forty paces in 
diameter. This eminence overlooks a vast extent of country, and 
no enemy could have approached the fortress without being seen 
at a considerable distance. Between this and Galtway, traces of 
a Roman camp are still visible on Borabie Mains; and the re- 
mains of two British posts appear at no great distance. The farm 
of Little Sypland contains a large British fort: between the 
strongholds on the two Syplands, is the site of a Roman camp near 
Whinnyligget. 

In the farm of Carse was a British fort, of about fifty paces in dia- 
meter, placed there, in all probability, to protect a ford nearly op- 
posite in the Dee, and to overlook a portion of the river. 

Castles. — On an island in Lochfergus, now drained, stood the 
strong mansion of the ancient Lords of Galloway. There were 
two fortified islands in the lake, the larger, about 90 paces in dia- 
meter, was called Palace Isle, and the smaller. Stable Isle. 

The Lords of Galloway, as formerly noticed, had another castle 
in the immediate vicinity of the burgh, named Kirkcudbright- 
Castle. In old deeds, the lands are called Castle- Mains; but now 
the place bears the name of Castledykes. The castle was sur- 
rounded by a deep ditch, or fosse, into which the tide at high 
water probably flowed. Traces of the building are still apparent, 
though it has been long since demolished. 

The Maclellans had a castle at Bombie, from which they took 
their title; but it is now a heap of ruins. They had another and 
a stronger castle at Raeberry, also in the parish of Kirkcudbright. 
It stood upon a rock which overhung a terrific precipice above the 
Solway Frith, and was disjoined from the main land by a deep 
fosse, with a strong wall. Across it, was a huge drawbridge, said to 
have been made of hard freestone. The wall and drawbridge are 
supposed to have been destroyed about ninety years ago, and the 
interior buildings about two hundred years prior to that time. At 
present, nothing remains but the site and fosse. 

Antiquities — Burgh. — The town of Kirkcudbright was ancient- 
ly encompassed by a wall and fosse. None of the wall is now vi- 
sible, though the fosse, or ditch, is still open in several places. 
The space within the wall was almost a square, each side being 
about 350 yards long. The town had one gate at the river, and 
another on ttie side next the Barhill, called the Meikle Yett. 

• The three globular stones which stood above it are placed on the gate of tlie 
churchyard.

The tide seems to liave flowed into the fosse, and consequently at 
hioh water to have completely surrounded the town. Houses 
stood with their gables to the street, and closes radiated from each 
side of it. At the cross are the old jail and steeple : the steeple 
contains the bells which are used on ordinary occasions, and a clock 
of no modern workmanship. 

Churches.— Within the modern parish of Kirkcudbright, were at 
one time eight places of worship, with their respective church- 
yards. The town contained two churches, namely, that belong- 
ing to the convent of the Greyfriars, near the site of the present 
castle, and St Andrew's Church, which stood on the ground oc- 
cupied by the new jail. The General Assembly which sat in 
Edinburgh during the summer of 15C4, petitioned Queen Mary 
to grant'the Friars' Church of Kirkcudbright to the magistrates, 
to be used as a parish church. The Queen was pleased to com- 
ply with this request, and the building then contained for the first 
time a Protestant congregation. The convent itself, having suf- 
fered from the fury of the populace, was bestowed upon Sir Tho- 
mas Maclellan of Bombie, to afford him a site for a new residence. 
This castle was erected in 1582 : it is now in ruins, but the walls 
remain almost entire. The building retained its roof until 1752. 
In the year 1570, Sir Thomas Maclellan sold the Friar's Church 
and the church of St Andrews, with their churchyards, to the ma- 
gistrates, council, and community of Kirkcudbright, for the sum 
" of twa hundredth merks, usual money, and ane hundredth bolls 
of lym." The late church of Kirkcudbright, built in 1730, stood 
upon the spot previously occupied by the Friars' Church. Below 
the portion of it called the Old Aisle, still remaining, is the tomb 
in which the mortal remains of the Maclellans were deposited. 

The landward portion of the parish contained five churches. St 
Cuthbert's parish church stood about a quarter of a mile to the 
east of the town, surrounded by a church-yard, which is still used 
as a burying-ground by nearly all the inhabitants of the parish. 
It is well suited for the purpose, being a place of great beauty and 
solemnity. It was lately enlarged by a contract entered into be- 
tween the magistrates and presbytery. A portion of the glebe, 
containing 1724 square yards, was given in exchange for 3247 
square yards of the town's land : the addition to become the pro- 
perty of the burgh. This church appears to have been about 60 
feet long and 30 broad. Its site is still visible, though the walls 
have been long ago removed. It probably ceased to be used as a

place of worship after the magistrates of Kirkcudbright had ob- 
tained possession of the Friars' church. 

Galtway church stood on high ground, about two miles from 
the burgh. Traces of the walls are apparent. The church seems 
to have been but small, about 30 feet in length by 15 in breadth. 
The church-yard is still used by u few families. It is completely 
surrounded by a thriving plantation, and has a very sequestered ap- 
pearance ; the ancient wall, much dilapidated, exhibits its for- 
mer boundaries. The enclosure is but small, namely, 67 paces 
long and 45 broad. The oldest monument is Thomas Ledder- 
dale's of St Mary's Isle, who died on the 10th of February 1687. 
In the neighbourhood are some traces of a village which the 
plough has not entirely effaced. 

The church and lands of Galtway were appropriated to the 
prior and canons of St Mary's Isle, a dependent cell of Holyrood, 
and continued to belong to that establishment until the Reforma- 
tion. The priory stood in the parish of Galtway. 

Dunrodf Church was situated at the distance of nearly three 
and a-half miles from the town of Kirkcudbright. The church 
seems to have been about 30 feet long and 15 broad. It also be- 
longed to Holyrood.J The church-yard is of a circular form and 
continues to be used. 

The population here was once considerable, though now few 
houses remain in the neighbourhood. In the end of the seven- 
teenth century, the heritors of Dunrod and Galtway opposed 
the minister's application for an augmentation of stipend, because 
the parishes were a mere waste. 

At what time the three parishes were united, is not exactly 
known ; but it is thought that both Galtway and Dunrod were an- 
nexed to Kirkcudbright in 1663. 

The priory of St Mary's Isle with its church, stood upon a 
piece of ground which must have been completely insulated at 
every influx of the tide. It is now a beautiful peninsula, and 
contains the seat of the Earl of Selkirk. This change has been 
affected partly by the retreat of the sea along the whole coast, but 
particularly at St Mary's Isle, and by embankments formed on 
each side of t e isthmus between the island and the mainland.

The ancient name of the island was Trahil or Trayll, but after 
the foundation of the priory dedicated to St Mary, .t received the 
popular appellation of St Mary's Isle. There are now no vestiges 
of the priory to be seen. AH the buildings were removed above, 
a century and a-half ago, and the whole site of the priory is occu- 
pied by his Lordship's mansion and pleasure grounds.  he edi- 
fice was surrounded by high walls, and the outer gate, called the 
Great- Cross, stood at the distance of half a-mile from the priory, 
and about as far from the town. The inner gate led immediately 
to the cells inhabited by the monks, and was distinguished by the 
name of the Little- Cross. The gates were long ago demolished, 
but crosses must have been conspicuous at both entrances. The 
prior of St Mary's Isle, like other priors, had a right to a seat m 
Parliament. Robert Strivelin was the last prior, and after his 
death, Robert Richardson, who also held the offices of Lord 
Treasurer and Master of the Moat, was presented to the priory 
on the .30th March 1538; he sat as commendator in the Parlia- 
ment of 1560. In 1572, Mr Robert Richardson, usufructuary, 
and William Rutherford, commendator, granted to James Led- 
derdale, and Thomas, his son, the lands which belonged to the 
priory of St Mary's Isle. This grant was confirmed by a charter 
from the king, dated the 4th November 1573.t 

Druid Tewple.—Dr Muter, minister of Kirkcudbright, men- 
tions in the Old Statistical Account, that there was formerly a 
Druid temple in the parish, near the Roman camp in Bombie. It 
was destroyed, he says, a short time before he wrote by an " ignorant 
Goth," who carried off and split the stones for building a small 
bridge over the Buckland-burn. 

Moats. — Moats or motes were fortified eminences, used for 
courts of justice. There seem to have been two places of this 
kind in the parish, namely, one in the town, still bearing the name 
of the Moatbrae, and another in the country, called the Moothill. 
Some of the ancient hill forts seem to have been subsequently used 
as places for dispensing justice. 

Relics. — A few years ago, some flint hatchets, lying several feet

+ The property granted consisted of St Mary's Isle, Grange, Torrs and Little 
Galtway, reserving eight acres of land contiguous to the church of Galtway, for the 
use of the minister, l.edderdale also obtained a lease of nineteen years' duration of 
the spiritual property of the priory. In 1570, the following individuals oflSciated in 
three of the churches, Kirkcudbright, James Dodds, minister ; allowance, L.24 ; Dun- 
rod, William Maclellan, reader, 20 merles ; St Mary's Isle, Thomas Anderson, exhort 
er,' L.20.

below the surface of the ground were found in the farm of Milton; 
the skeleton of a man lay near them. 

A kind of stone coffin was lately discovered near Galtway old 
church : it contained some black mould, and small fragments of 
bones, which at one time must have formed a portion of the body 
of one of the primitive inhabitants. 

Not long since, a cup of Roman metal was found in the trench 
at Castledykes, near the town • it is in the possession of Mr Train, 
Castledouwlas. 

About the beginning of last century, as some men were engag- 
ed in making ditches, they turned up a plate of pure gold near 
Drummore Castle, for which they obtained L.20. 

Quantities of silver coin have been found, within the last twenty 
years, on the farm of Lochfergus. The pieces were of the reign 
of Edward I. Small coins called " Charles' placks" have been 
often found in and near the town of Kirkcudbright. 

Modern Buildings. — There are two churches in the parish, 
namely, the parish church and the United Secession church. The 
first, a large and elegant building, capable of containing a congre- 
gation of upwards of 1500, was completed in 1838, at an expense 
of about L. 7000. The burgh possesses one portion of it, the 
landward heritors another, and the incorporated trades a third. 
The funds of the burgh were saved to a considerable amount by 
private donations ; and the trades received the sum of L.l 50, which 
was left them by Miss Gordon of Threavemains, to enable them 
to erect a gallery in the new church, for the accommodation of 
themselves and their families. To the burgh belong 608 sittings, 
200 of which are let at 2s. 6d. each, L.25 ; 278 at 2s. each, 
L.27, 16s.; 130 at Is. 6d. each, L.9, 15s.; total rent, L.62, lis. 
There are 24 free sittings belonging to the burgh. No rent is ex- 
acted for seats belonging to the landward heritors. The church 
has a spire of considerable height attached to it, containing an 
excellent clock, and a very fine bell, both presents from the late 
James Lennox, Esq. of Dalskairth : the site of the building was 
given by Lord Selkirk. 

The chapel belonging to the United Secession church is a neat 
and comfortable edifice. It was completed in 1822, and cost 
about L.950. 

The foundation stones of the jail and academy were laid with 
masonic honours on the 8th day of May 1815. The Jail, which 
is of a castellated form, rises in some parts of the structure to the

Height of 75 feet; several of the apartments are large, but not 
welt suited to the present system of prison discipline. Some al- 
terations are contemplated in the interior arrangement of the cells. 
The prison was erected at the joint expense of the county and 
burgh, and cost between L.4000 and L.5000. The court-room, 
a spacious and elegant hall, is contiguous to the prison. The 
buildings, from a distance, have an imposing appearance. 

The Academy consists of three large class rooms and a library. 
Its site, with about an acre of ground adjoining, was presented to 
the magistrates by the late Lord Selkirk. It has a kind of piazza, 
or portico, in front for the use of the scholars in bad weather. The 
academy originally cost L.l 129, but the expense of its erection was 
partly defrayed by subscriptions from the friends of the institution. 

Mansion- Houses. — The mansion-houses in the parish are 
St Mary's Isle, Balmae, Janefield, St Cuthbert's Cottage, and 
Fludha. 

III. — Population. 
Ancient State. — The ancient state of the inhabitants of the pa- 
rish was by no means favourable to their health and happiness. 
About the beginning of the last century, their houses in general 
were miserable' hovels, built of stone and turf, or stone and clay, 
and covered with turf and indifferent straw. Holes in the walls 
or roof served to admit light, and allow the smoke to escape. 
Domestic animals, such as cows and horses, were often kept in 
the dwelling houses of the inhabitants. In a report made by the 
magistrates of Kirkcudbright to the commissioners of the conven- 
tion of royal burghs in 1692, they say, " that the most pairt of 
their houses are inhabited by their respective heritors, and all the 
rest are either waist or ruinous, and that more than the half." 

Their furniture was of the rudest and poorest kind, and 
their food consisted of the meanest and coarsest materials. In 
the same report, it is stated that the town had no foreign trade, 
and that their inland trade was very inconsiderable ; that all the 
articles they required, they brought from other towns on horseback ; 
that all the vessels they had, was one small boat of eight tons, 
newly bought for carrying their coal. 

The dress of this period was uncouth and homely, and in ge- 
neral neither men nor women wore shoes in summer ; shirts they 
scarcely knew. 

Their agricultural operations continued extremely awkward and 
inefficient, and the instruments then in use were clumsy, ponder-

ous, and imperfectly constructed. Almost all the ordinary drudg- 
ery of life was performed by females. Little employment could 
be obtained, and the price of labour remained miserably low. 
Education at this period was in a deplorable state. Few of the 
common people could read even the Bible, and superstition pre 



vailed to a lamentab 


e degree.

The country portion of the parish is thought to have been at 
one time much more populous than at present. 

During the last year, there were 60 births, 50 deaths, and 10 
marriages in the town and country. There are some individuals 
above ninety years of age. One noble family, and several persons 
of independent fortune reside in the parish. 

There are five proprietors of land of the yearly value of L. 50 
and upwards. The burgh also has a rental from ,land, of about 
L. 600. 

795 families reside in the parish, namely, 635 in the burgh, 
and 160 in the country. 

The parish contains 5 insane and 2 fatuous persons. There 
are in it one blind person and one deaf and dumb. 

Character. — The people of Kirkcudbright are as intellectual, 
moral, and religious as those of any other parish ; but their intel- 
ligence is fiee from pedantry, their morality from cant, and their 
religion from fanaticism. They have been long distinguished for 
their attachment to their pastors, and respect towards their supe- 
riors in station. The higher ranks are attentive and hospitable to 
strangers, and the lower ranks are peaceable, modest, obliging, 
and industrious. Formerly, they were said to be addicted to the 
use of spirituous liquors ; but such a charge cannot now be brought 
against them, at least with any foundation in truth. There are 
few crimes committed in the parish, and these by no means of an

aggravated nature. Poaching in game still prevails, though to a 
trlflino- extent, considering the temptation the great abundance of 
game°presents, the facility of turning into money, and the poverty 
of some of the inhabitants. Smuggling is now almost unknown, 
and no regular pawnbroking has ever been carried on in the pa- 
rish. 

IV. — Industry. 

Affricultur e.There are about 3000 acres in tillage, and 500 
which remain constantly in waste or pasture. About 500 acres 
have been planted. The management of the plantations is good. 

Rent. The average rent of arable land is about L. 1 per acre. A 

cow or ox can be grazed for L. 4 for the year, and a sheep for 5s. 

Wages. — The rate of wages for farm labourers and country ar- 
tisans may be stated at Is. 4d. per day. Men servants, on an ave- 
rage, receive aboiit L.4, and women servants L.2 half-yearly, with 
victuals. Masons' wages average 2s. 6d. per day, and house car- 
penters, 2s. 

Cattle are of the Galloway breed, and sheep of the Leicester. 
The general duration of leases extend to fifteen years ; but 
leases are not numerous. 

The state of farm buildings and enclosures is good. 
Draining is now much attended to. 

Fisheries. — The river Dee contains three valuable salmon-fish- 
eries. The rent of the Tongland fishing, which belongs to Alex- 
ander Murray, Esq. of Broughton, was once as high as L. 705. 
Its present amount is not correctly known. It is extremely pro- 
ductive. Three hundred fish have been taken out of a pool called 
the Sandbed,on the Kirkcudbright side of the river, at one draught ; 
and even during last season, one draught yielded no fewer than 100 
salmon and grilses with three trouts. Out of another pool called 
the Sheep-Dubb, on the same side of the river, were taken at one 
time last summer, 589 fish, some of them of a large size. The 
burgh has a fishery, which lets at present at L.80 per annum ; and 
Lord Selkirk possesses a third, the rent of which is generally sup- 
posed to be about L.150. This is also a productive fishery, and 
the quality of the salmon cannot be surpassed ; they are princi 
pally taken in yairs. A considerable quantity of excellent cod is 
caught off the mouth of the river by hooks fastened to lines. 

Produce. — The average amount of raw produce raised in the 
parish cannot be exactly ascertained. The following may ap- 
roach the truth.

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is conveniently situated 
for the greater part of the population : no houses are above three 
and a-half miles distant from it. It is in a state of complete repair. 

Benefactions. — In 1639, Robert Johnston, Esq. physician, Lon- 
don, left to the poor of Kirkcudbright the sum of L.500 Sterling. 
In 1730, David Currie, E&amp;q. of Newlaw, left L.16, interest to be 
applied in purchasing Bibles for the poor at New Year's day ; and 
in 1803 James R. Smyth, Esq. of New York, left L.31 for the 
same purpose. Mr Currie of Newlaw left L.20, the interest to 
be paid to the poor in sixpences at New Year's Day. In 1791, 
William Lawrie, Esq. of Barnsoul, bequeathed to the poor L.IO, 
interest to be applied in purchasing meal and coals. William 
Johnston, Esq. of Madeira, left in 1795, L.lOO interest to be ap- 
plied for the same purpose. In 1779, David Sproat, Esq. of 
Portmary, mortified L.200 for clothing and educating poor boys, 
the sons of respectable burgesses. William Johnston, Esq. of Mar- 
whirn, in 1802, invested in the hands of the magistrates L.lOO, in- 
terest to be divided among " five householders who had seen bet- 
ter days." In 1831, Alexander Gordon, Esq. of London, left 
L.270, the interest to be paid annually to the poor by the minis- 
ter and kirk-session ; and in the same year Miss Jean Gordon of 
Threavemains invested L.BO for the same purpose. In 1833, John 
Commelin, Esq. Dumfries, left L.400, one-half of the interest to 
be applied in aid of the poor, and one-half for purchasing prizes 
for the grammar school. Thomas Macmillan, Esq. of the gram- 
mar school, bequeathed, at his death in 1827, L.200 for educa- 
tional and charitable purposes, and L.6 yearly from the lands of 
Bellerigg, one-half for a prize to the best scholar in the grammar 
school, and the other half for purchasing entertaining books, to be 
divided among the poor of the town of Kirkcudbright. 

Stipend. — The minister has no manse, but he receives L.50 per 
annum as manse rent. He has one glebe, for which he draws an 
yearly rent of L.18. His stipend last year amounted to L.2.40, 
but the average amount may be about L.280. 



KIRKCUDBllIGHT.

Established Church.— Thvee thousand one hundred persons pro- 
fess to belong to the Established Church, which is generally well 
attended. There are 850 communicants. 

Secession Church.— TWxs place of worship is attended by 40 
families, some of whom are from the neighbouring parishes. About 
150 individuals belong to the United Secession Church in the pa- 
rish of Kirkcudbright. The number of communicants is at pre- 
sent from 90 to 100. Though in general Divine service is not nu- 
merously attended, yet the chapel is sometimes respectably filled. 
The stipend of the minister, which is somewhat variable, is raised 
by the voluntary contributions of the people, assisted occasionally 
by donations from the Synod fund. Collections are sometimes 
made for missionary and charitable purposes. 

Catholics. — The Catholics have an apartment which they oc- 
cupy as a chapel. The Right Rev. Andrew Carruthers, who re- 
sides generally in Edinburgh, is the Bishop. 

The families that attend this chapel are 51 in number : and the 
number of persons who belong to the Catholic congregation of Kirk- 
cudbright, according to a census just taken, is 314. Divine wor- 
ship is said to be well attended; but the clergyman can only ofili- 
ciate on the first Sunday of every month. About 200 individuals 
of this persuasion permanently reside in the parish. 

Society. — One Society has been established in aid of the India 
Mission. It annually contributes about L.20 to the general fund. 

Collections. — The poor are supported principally by collections 
made in the church, the funds of the town and country poor being 
kept separate. The church collections for the poor amount an- 
nually to about L.140, to -which may be added L.30 collected for 
educational purposes. 

Manufactures. — Formerly, Kirkcudbright was celebrated for its 
manufacture of gloves, and more recently, of boots and shoes. 
One firm in the town, a few years ago, generally employed no 
fewer than 24 men, and shoes were sent to a great distance. 
There were, at one time, though on a small scale, manufactories 
of soap, candles, and leather ; and kelp was also frequently made 
upon the shores. On the ground occupied by the academy, once 
stood a brewery ; and a house yet remains that was built for a 
snufF-mill. 

Navigation. — Twenty-six vessels belong to the port — tonnage, 
922. In 1692, Kirkcudbright had only one boat of 8 tons bur- 
den. In 1840, the Custom House port of Kirkcudbright, with its

creeks, possessed 54 vessels — tonnage, 2069, No foreign vessels 
trade to the port. A little above the harbour is a ferry, where 
passengers are carried across the river in a flat-bottomed boat of 
an oblong form, with both comfort and expedition. To each end 
of the boat is attached by hinges, and suspended by chains, a broad 
platform or pathway, by which all kinds of vehicles can enter, and 
depart without loss of time, and almost with as much ease as if 
travelling along a common road. The boat is commodious, and 
can hold at once four carts with their horses attached, or two car- 
riages and one gig. It is moved along a chain by a crank wench. 
The rent of the boat and boat-house is L.128. 

Incorporated Trades. — There are no public or private associa- 
tions in the parish for the encouragement or improvement of any 
branch of industry ; but there are six incorporated trades, namely, 
the Squaremen, 36 members ; Tailors, 13; Weavers, 22; Ham- 
mermen; 13; Clothiers, 20 ; Shoemakers, 17; total number of 
members, 121. 

Market-Town. — The only town in the parish is Kirkcudbright; 
and there are no collections of houses in it to which the term 
tillages could be applied. In Kirkcudbright, a weekly market is 
held every Friday, but it is not well attended. At one time, more 
foreign trade was carried on by the burgh than at present. Sel- 
dom more than one cargo of wood, containing about 15,000 feet, 
has been annually imported. Much coal and lime is received from 
Cumberland ; and a great many articles of general traffic, such as 
flour, herrings, groceries, haberdasheries, hardware, iron, lead, 
slates, freestone, &amp;c. are conveyed from Liverpool and other 
places, both by land and sea. Bone-dust and guano are also fre- 
quently imported. From the parish of Kirkcudbright are regu- 
larly exported, corn, potatoes, meal, wool, turnips, beans, black- 
cattle, sheep, salmon, grass-seed, timber, staves. From the 5th of 
April 1842 to the 5th of April 1843, there were sent from the 
port of Kirkcudbright 50 quarters of wheat, 338 quarters of bar- 
ley, 5268 quarters of oats, 6 quarters of beans, 8 tons of meal, 
688 tons of potatoes, 7840 stones of wool, 60 tons of turnips, and 
80 cwt of rye-grass-seed. 721 black-cattle, and 12,005 sheep, 
were also exported from Whitsunday 1842 to Whitsunday 1843. 

Meansof Communication.— The means of communication which 
the parish enjoys are excellent. Two commodious steam-boats 
sail regularly from Kirkcudbright to Liverpool, once in the week 
in summer, and once in the fortnight in winter. Two coaches

visit Kirkcudbright daily from Dumfries ; and, exclusive of the 
carriers from the adjoining parishes, there are carriers weekly from 
Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dumfries, Stranraer, Newton Stewart, New 
Galloway, and Gatehouse of Fleet. The London mail arrives at 
the post-office twice in the day. 

The roads in the parish are kept in good repair. The turnpike 
road, about a mile and three-quarters in length, is perfectly smooth 
and level. 

There are only two bridges in the locality worthy of notice, and 
both are over the Dee between the parishes of Kirkcudbright and 
Tongland. The old bridge, which is still in good repair, was 
built upwards of 110 years ago, and cost only between L.400 and 
L.500 : it has two arches. The new bridge, completed in 1808, 
cost L,7350. It consists of one large arch of 110 feet span, and 
three small arches on each side. 

Harbours. — The parish of Kirkcudbright contains two good 
harbours. In the harbour at the town, vessels often disload at the 
beach and load in the dock. One side of the dock is of wood, 
and the other two sides are of stone. 

The river opposite the harbour is 30 feet deep at spring-tides, 
and 500 feet in breadth. At neap-tides, its depth is from 20 to 
25 feet, and its breadth about 400 feet. Below the harbour is a 
ford, by which the river may be sometimes crossed, the depth of 
water upon it on some singular occasions being not more than 1 
foot. 

There is another harbour about two miles and a-half from the 
mouth of the river, called Torrs' Lake, or Manxman's Lake. 
Here almost any number of vessels might lie in safety on a clay 
bottom. At four hours of flood, there is generally a depth of from 
14 to 16 feet of water. Before reaching it, a bar, which cannot 
be crossed by ordinary vessels at low water, extends across the 
channel, but at half- flood there are from 10 to 12 feet of water 
upon it. Two towers and a lighthouse lately erected on the 
island of Little Ross, kept in one line bearing south-west, lead 
over the bar in the deepest water. For this harbour vessels fre- 
quently run in bad weather, but before they can gain admittance 
to it, they have often to anchor at the Ross-road in from two to 
three fathoms water. Many fatal accidents have occurred from 

• In the severe winter of 1813-14, the river opposite the town became completely 
frozen over, and passengers regularly crossed it upon the ice ; even some individuals 
went across on horseback. Such an event had never before been heard of.

mariners mistaking other inlets for the entrance to the Dee. The 
lighthouse on Little Ross will now be seen from a great distance, 
and serve as a beacon to direct shipping, but particularly stranger 
vessels, to a haven of safety. The lantern is about 50 feet above 
the level of the sea at high-water. The light is a revolving one, 
producing a bright flash every five seconds. 

Police. — The Rural Police of thestewartry consists of a super- 
intendent and eleven officers. The superintendent and one of the 
officers reside in the town. This officer's district comprehends the 
parishes of Kirkcudbright, Rerwick, Tongland, and Trognholm. 
The burgh has one police officer in its constant employment, and 
two additional officers receive salaries for assisting to keep the 
peace of the town and other public services. There are besides 
a harbour-master and some steward-officers in the parish. 

Steward Court. — A Steward Court is held within the town for 
ordinary cases every Friday during session, and a Commissary 
Court when business requires, the Steward-substitute being gene- 
rally the presiding judge. A Small Debt Court for the disposal 
of cases where the claim is under L.8, 6s. 8d., is held once in the 
fortnight. From the legal knowledge, acuteness, and patience of 
the Judge- Ordinary, this Court has become very popular. The 
number of cases disposed of in it during the last year was 272, 
exclusive of those decided in the Small Debt Circuit Court, In 
the Steward Court, during the last year, were tried, with or with- 
out a jury, no fewer than 59 criminal actions. Both the ma- 
gistrates of the burgh and the justices of the peace also sometimes 
hold courts for disposing of civil and criminal business. 

Banks. — There are two branches of banks in the town of Kirk- 
cudbright, namely, one of the Bank of Scotland andanother of 
the Western Bank. 

Water. — The town is excellently supplied with water, brought 
in leaden pipes from springs at the distance of nearly half a 
mile from the main cistern. This useful work was completed 
in 1763, and cost L. 440 Sterling. The burgh defrayed about 
one-half of the expense, and the inhabitants the other. Even in 
the dry summers of 1826 and 1842, there was no great scarcity of 
water. 

Markets. — The markets in general are supplied with abundance 
of provisions, and prices are moderate. 

Assessments. — The inhabitants of the town enjoy a complete ex-

emption from all local assessments, such being paid from the 

burgh revenue. 

-Ec/ucaizow.— Kirkcudbright is well provided with the means of 
education. There are no fewer than eleven schools, six of them 
endowed, and five unendowed. Three of the endowed, namely, 
the Grammar, the Commercial, and the English schools, are united, 
and form the Academy of Kirkcudbright. This institution is under 
the patronage of the magistrates and town-council, and the sala- 
ries of the masters are paid by the burgh. There are nearly '200 pu- 
pils constantly attending the academy, and the fees for one branch 
of education vary from 2s. to 7s. 6d. per quarter. In the classical 
departments are taught Latin, Greek, and French, with ancient 
geography, &amp;c. Attached to the grammar school is a library con- 
sisting of between ;300 and 400 volumes of useful literature. It 
was instituted by the present master in 1837. The teacher of the 
grammar school is allowed a yearly salary of L.50 ; and he realizes 
by fees about L.60. In the commercial department are taught 
mathematics, navigation, geography, book-keeping, arithmetic, 
writing, &amp;c. The teacher receives a salary of L.50 ; and his an- 
nual fees amount to about L.90. The master of the English 
school has a yearly salary of L.40 ; and his fees on an average 
amount to L.60. In this class are taught history, geography, com- 
position, and the principles of the English language. The Aca- 
demy of Kirkcudbright has long maintained a high reputation. It 
can boast among its teachers of Dr Cririe, afterwards one of the 
masters of the High School of Edinburgh ; Mr Thomas M' Mil- 
Ian of Bellerigg, long a zealous, efficient, and celebrated instruc- 
tor ; and Mr Robert Mitchell, subsequently one of the masters of 
the New Academy, Edinburgh. 

There is one other endowed school in the town, namely, a fe- 
males' school, where needle-work and some other branches are 
taught. The mistress of the Ladies' school receives from the 
funds of the burgh a salary of L.20. The master of another 
school is allowed an annua gratuity of L.IO, one-half of which is 
paid by the burgh, and the other by the Countess of Selkirk. 
Seventy scholars attend this school, and the fees, which vary from 
•2s. to 2s. 6d. per quarter, amount annually to L.30 : no school- 
room is provided. There are three other unendowed schools in the 
town, namely, one containing 109, another 50, and the third 40 

• Revenue of the burgh during the last year L.1131 ; the debts amounted to 
L.5o87, namely, L.1803 mortified money, and L.3784 borrowed money

jiupils; fees varying from Is. 8i. to 3s. per quarter. About. 100 
children are educated gratuitously from a collection made yearly 
in the parish church, and the interest of money mortified for the 
purpose. In the town, classes almost constantly exist for the or- 
namental branches of education. There are two endowed schools 
in the country, each of the teachers of which has a house and gar- 
den, and L.25, 13s. od. of salary: These schools are generally 
attended, by nearly 100 scholars. None of the fees exceed 3s. 
per quarter. There is likewise an unendowed school, attended by 
about 40 scholars ; the fees in it are very moderate. 

For about thirty years, a Sabbath school has been open in the 
town, and has been attended generally by 300 scholars. It is un- 
der the superintendence of the minister, assisted by the gratui;ous 
labours of a few benevolent individuals. 

From the opportunities of obtaining education which prevail, 
and of which the people seem disposed to take advantage, there 
are few or none above the age of seven years who cannot read. 

Literature. — A few years ago, the town contained two circulat- 
ing libraries. At present, neither of them is in active operation, 
cheap periodical publications having tended to supersede them. 
In 1777, the principal inhabitants of the district established a sub- 
scription library, for which they selected books of interest and me- 
rit. Of late years, the number of subscribers has rapidly decreas- 
ed, and few new works have been obtained. Last winter, how- 
ever, a new library was formed on the basis of the old, and the to- 
tal number of subscribers now amounts to about 50. It is still 
impossible to predict what success may attend this institution. 

The town contains one reading-room, supported by subscription. 
It receives no periodical works, but several Scotch and English 
newspapers. There are two printers' presses in Kirkcudbright, 
but no periodical works issue from them. 

Charitable and other Institutions. — No alms-houses, poor-houses, 
or hospitals exist within the parish. A soup-kitchen, however, 
confers an incalculable benefit upon the poor during the dreary 
months of winter, by dispensing clean and wholesome nourishment 
at least three times a-week, either gratuitously or at a very small 
price. 

Savings' Bank.— At Whitsunday 1842, a branch of the National 
Security Savings' Bank was established in Kirkcudbright. From 
its commencement until the 10th of May 1843, the deposits 
amounted to L. 423, 9s. lOd., and the sums withdrawn were very 



KIRKCUDBRIGHT, 



35 



trifling. The depositors are principally servants, both male and 
female, mechanics, and children of the middle class. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— T\.\vmg the last year the roll con- 
tained the names of 130 permanent paupers, with 00 who received 
occasional assistance. The poor are relieved principally by church 
collections, interest of money mortified for their use, and alms dis- 
tributed in private. The church collections amounted last year to 
L.140, 8s. 6d. ; contributions from heritors and burgh, L.80 ; mor- 
tifications, &amp;c. L.38, 17s.; total, L. '259, 5s. 6d. It is impossible 
to estimate the sum bestowed in private charity. The allowance 
of each pauper fi om the sessional fund varies from 12s. to L. 6 
annually. There are several charities, foundations, and mortifica- 
tions, where the magistrates and members of the town- council are 
sole trustees. 

The poor in general evince little delicacy in applying for paro- 
chial relief : they do not consider it degrading to solicit charity. 

Prison. — The number of persons committed to the prison of 
Kirkcudbright from Jst April 1842 to 1st April 1843, was 85 
criminals and 15 debtors. The offences or crimes for which the 
criminals were committed are the followinor : 

o 

For child murder, . . 1 Breach of the peace, . . 9 

Theft, . . . 29 Uttering base coin, . . 2

The prison is pretty well secured, though it is only partially sur- 
rounded by a wall. 

Proper means are used for preserving the health of the prison- 
ers. Each is comfortably clothed, and receives three meals a-day 
of plain, but wholesome food. Their hands and faces are washed 

 The poor receive the rent of a house of about L.200 value, bestowed upon them 
by the late Robert Lennek, Esq. of New York.

night and morning, and their feet once in the week. They are 
bathed once in the month, and the male prisoners are shaved twice 
in the week. Clean linens, clean stockings, and clean handker- 
chiefs are furnished to them every week, clean sheets every fort- 
night, and clean blankets every month. They are allowed to take 
daily exercise in the open air, and are supplied with various kinds 
of employment in their apartments. 

The jail is under the particular superintendence of the County 
Prison Board, consisting of nine members, the steward, or his sub- 
stitute ex officio being one. 

The new system of prison discipline is in operation. The keep- 
er, matron, and male warden riside within the precincts of the pri- 
son, and the prisoners are regularly visited by the chaplain and 
surgeon. The keeper acts as schoolmaster. Thirteen individuals 
were committed during the last year who could not read. 

Fairs. — Hiring fairs for farm and domestic servants are held 
annually on the last Friday of March, and the last Friday of Sep- 
tember. A day for hiring hay and harvest workers is likewise 
held yearly on the Friday, immediately preceding Keltonhill fair 
at midsummer, but not much business is transacted on any of the 
days. The ancient fairs of the burgh have fallen into desuetude. 

Inns. — The parish contains twenty-seven inns, or houses licensed 
to sell spirituous liquors. It is probable, however, that the num- 
ber will soon be materially diminished. 

Fuel. — Coal is the principal article of fuel used both in the 
town and country. The average price is about 1 Is. per ton of 20 
cwt. Wood and peat, which are procured in the neighbourhood, 
are also used, though in small quantities. The coal is generally 
brought from Cumberland. 

Constituency. — The town contains 102, and the country 26 elec- 
tors. Kirkcudbright, with Dumfries, Annan, Lochmaben, and 
Sanquhar sends a member to Parliament. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

The size of the town of Kirkcudbright has considerably in- 
creased since the last Statistical Accoimt was written. One 
building Society was formed in 1808, and another in 1810. 
These Societies erected in whole 112 houses, which have not only 
enlarged the town, but, from lowering the rents of houses, tended 
to augment the population of the parish. In 1838, a Gas Light 
Company was formed, and a great improvement has taken place 
in the liorhtinff of the streets. 

The people are now better fed, better clothed, and better

hiUed than they were at the date of the last Statistical Account. 
Their food is of a superior quality. Formerly nearly all the but- 
chers' meat they consumed was in a salted state ; now, the market is 
well supplied during the whole year. At one time, nothing; but 
oaten bread was used, except by the wealthiest class ; now, the 
great body of the people occasionally partake of wheaten bread. 
The use of tea and coffee, those wholesome and enlivening beve- 
rages, is more common, and the consumption of spirituous liquors 
is considerably on the decline. The temperance Societies of the 
district have powerfully contributed to produce this beneficial 
effect. 

Cloth of all kinds, but particularly the cloth worn by females, 
is much cheaper than it was fifty years ago, and the people, in 
general, are more comfortably clad. 

They are, at the same time, more comfortably lodged, for from 
the great addition of houses, so many families are not at present crowd- 
ed into one house, as was customary at one time ; and the houses, 
themselves, which are generally of two storeys in height, are cleaner 
and better aired, and consequently less apt to engender or diffuse 
infectious and malignant distempers. The pernicious effect of the 
window duty is here often experienced by the lower ranks of so- 
ciety, for proprietors not unfrequently build up windows, which 
practice both disfigures their houses, and prevents the apartments 
of their tenants from being properly ventilated.

PRESBYTERY OF KIRKCUDBRIGHT, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY. 

THE REV. JOHN GORDON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, 8fc. — The present parish of Twynholm was formed by 
the union of the two parishes of Twynholm and Kirkchrist. The 
origin of the name of the latter of these parishes is obvious. The 
meaning of the former name is not so certain. According to 
Chalmers, the name Twynholm, as now spelled, is a corrup- 
tion of Twynham, or Twynhame, and this name is derived from 
the British word Twyn, a bank or hillock, to wliich the Saxon 



K I a K C U D B R I G I-l T S H I U li . 



ham, a dioelling has been added. If this etymology can be relied 
on, the name is sufficiently descriptive of the situation of the church 
of Twynholm. 

The time when the parishes of Kirkchrist and Twynholm were 
united, is uncertain. It is known, however, that the union took 
place in the course of the seventeenth century. Kirkchrist was a 
separate parish in 1605. In Blaeu's Atlas, published in 1654, 
Kirkchrist has the symbol of a church put to it, as if it had 
still been the church of a separate parish. But, in 1684, wlien 
Symson wrote his account of Galloway, the church of Kirkchrist 
had been long in ruins. From these circumstances, it is probable 
that the union of the parishes took place soon after 1654, — the 
time when Blaeu's Atlas was published. 

Extent. — The parish of Twynholm, as now constituted, is about 
ten miles long, by nearly three broad, where the length and 
breadth are the greatest. Its figure is a sort of oblong, widest at 
the centre, and tapering towards the northern and southern ex- 
tremities, till it ends almost in a point. It is understood to contain 
about 16.7 square miles. 

Boundaries. — It is bounded on the north by the parishes of 
Girthon and Balmaghie ; on the east, by Tongland and the river 
Dee, which separates it from the parish of Kirkcudbright; and 
on the south and west, by Eorgue. 

Topographical Appearances. — In the northern part of Twyn- 
holm the hills rise to a considerable height, and consequently some 
of the lands in that part of the parish are incapable of cultivation, 
and used solely for the pasture of sheep and black-cattle ; but in 
the southern part, where it approaches the Dee, there is to be 
found excellent land, both for cropping and pasturage. Like most 
of the land in this part of the kingdom, the surface is very irregular, 
and even in the richest cropping districts, knolls rise up in the 
middle of the corn fields, and the rocks protrude to the very sur- 
face of the ground. The whole parish appears to rest upon a bed 
of whinstone. We have no sandstone, and granite occurs only in 
the shape of large boulders ; which, however, are to be found in 
great abundance in many places. 

Rivers. — The only rivers worth mentioning are the Dee, and 
its tributary, the Tarff, forming part of the eastern boundary of the 
parish; but the account of these rivers will more naturally belong 
to some of the. neighbouring parishes. There is, however, 
abundance of water throughout the whole of Twynholm, supplied 
by a number of small streams that fall into these two rivers. 



TWVNHO.LM. 



39 



We have also several sheets of water of considerable exlent. 
The largest of these, Loch Whinyeon, lies at the head of Twyn- 
holm, on the borders of Girthon. The waters of this loch for- 
merly found a vent by Glengap burn,-wliich carried them into the 
Tarflf ; but a tunnel has lately been driven for a considerable way 
through a hill, which has diverted them into another course, for 
the purpose of driving the cotton-mills at Gatehouse. 

In the former Statistical Account it is said, that, with the ex- 
ception of some old trees about Compston, there were very few in , 
the parish. It is mentioned, at the same place, that plantations 
of considerable extent had been made by Lord Daer on the lands 
belontrincT to the Earl of Selkirk. These plantations have thriven 
well, and add greatly to the beauty of that part of the parish ui 
which they are found. Mr M'Millan has also done much to 
beautify the lands of Barwhinnock, by small plantations tastefully 
laid down, so as to give both ornament and shelter to a portion of 
the parish which was formerly bare and exposed. 

II. — Civil History. 

Eminent Men. — The only man of eminence in literature known 
to have been connected with Twynholm is Alexander Montgome- 
ry, the Homerus Scoticus of Dempster, who lived at Compston 
Castle ; and Symson mentions the tradition, that the poem of the 
" Cherry and the Slae" was written by him at this place, dur- 
ing the reign of James VI. 

Historical Events, — The only well authenticated historical 
event connected with the parish which is worthy of note, is the re- 
sidence of Edward I. of England for some time within its bounds. 
On the i7th July 1300, Edward entered Galloway. On the 19th 
he came to Kirkcudbright, and remained there for about ten days. 
He then crossed the Dee, and continued for about ten days more 
at Twynholm, waiting for provisions, which were brought to him 
by sea. On the 9th of August, he advanced to the Flete. Dur- 
ing the time he remained at Twynholm, he made three several 
otFerings at the altar of the chapel there, of 7s. each. 

Antiquities. — There are a number of British forts in the parish 
of Twynholm. A tumulus was opened near one of these, and 
there was found a stone-coffin, containing human bones. There 
was also discovered in it an instrument resembling a hammer, with 
some coins. 



 In preparing a field in tlie glebe for green crop in the summer of 1842, the hi- 
bourers found a number of small silver coins of the reign of Edward 1., of about the 
.size of a sixpence. Three of these are in the possession of the writer of this account.

KIRKCUDBKlGHTSIIIHE. 



It is stated that there was at one time a nunnery in the parish 
of Kirkciirist ; and it is probable that the site must have been in 
the southern part of that parish, though the exact spot cannot be 
ascertained. There are still two farms there, bearing the n-ime 
of High and Low Nunton, and the Nunmill adjoins to them In 
the last Statistical Account it is mentioned, that there were the 
ruhis of a castle upon the Nunton. Nothing now remains of these 
ruins, except some mounds covered with grass; but there are per- 
sons still living who remember the old tower, and the stairs bv 
which, when children, they were in the practice of ascending it.' 

The only ancient building now remaining in the parish is the 
Castle of Compston, which is in a very ruinous condition, only 
three sides of the tower being left, and even these threatening- to 
fall.  

Land-owiers. — There are sixteen proprietors in the parish. 
The chief of these are, the Earl of Selkirk, patron of the parish, 
who possesses nearly one-half of the land in value, though not in 
extent ; Mr Maitland of Dundrennan, who resides at Compston, 
in this parish; and Mr M'Millan of Barwhinnock, who also re- 
sides upon his property here. 

Mansion Houses. — The houses of Compston and Barwhinnock 
have been built by the present proprietors. They are substantial 
and- convenient. 

Modern Buildings. — The church was built in 1818. It is a 
neat and plain building, well suited to the parish, and furnishing 
accommodation for rather more than 400 sitters. The old church 
was built in 1730, at which time the situation of the church and 
churchyard were changed, — the former church having stood near- 
ly a quarter of a mile south from the present site. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial records and registers have 
been by no means regularly kept, and part of them were consumed 
by fire. The oldest volume in existence contains the records of 
the kirk-session mixed up with a register of births and marriages 
from 1693 till 27th October 1703. 

In this volume of records there are many entries that are inte- 
resting and valuable, as showing the state of the people at that 
time. From -27th October 1703 till 14th June 1730, there is a 
blank in the records. From this last date, there are occasional 
entries till May '21st 1741. There is then another blank, with 
the exception of a few loose leaves that appear to have been the 
scrolls of the session-clerk till 4th April 1762, and the entries 
ure continued at intervals till 29th April 1804. The register of

Of whom there were males, 378, and females, 419. 

The partial decrease that has taken place since the census of 
1831, is to be principally attributed to the circumstance, that, in 
1831, extensive improvements were carried on, on the estate ot 
Barwhinnock, and as these are now completed the labourers who 
were engaged in them have removed with their families.

There are five fatuous persons, of these, four are paupers, and

Poaching in game, it is to be feared, prevails to a considerable 
extent, more particularly since steam navigation has been introdu- 
ced into this quarter, and a ready market is thus found for any 
game that may be taken. 

IV. — Industry. 

Of the families in the parish there are about ninety-seven di- 
rectly dependent on agriculture for their support ; fifteen are the 
families of tradesmen employed chiefly by the agriculturists ; and 



42 



KIRKCUDBUIGHTSHIRK. 



the remainder, with a few exceptions, are engaged in occupations, 
HI which they owe their employment either to the two families of 
independent fortune that live in the parish, or to the farmers. 

Agriculture — The parish contains about 8502 acres Scots ; of 
these there are in pasture, about 2600 ; under wood, about 260 ; 
arable, about 5500. The remainder may be supposed to be oc- 
cupied with roads, water, &amp;c. 

 Rentiil. — The total rental of the parish is about L,6250, allow- 
ing a fair value for the land in the possession of the respective 
proprietors. 

The parish is chiefly agricultural, or rather, like most of the 
land in the district, agricultural and pastoral combined. There 
is one farm in the northern part of the parish principally stocked 
with black-faced sheep. The rest of the farms are stocked with 
black-cattle and white-faced sheep, and in most of them the dif- 
ferent fields are brought under tillage in rotation. Besides the 
land incapable of cultivation, there are two farms containing above 
500 acres of rich old pasture kept in perpetual grass, and in many ■ 
of the farms a field or two is never ploughed for the sake of the 
old grass. 

In the tillage farms, the most usual rotation of crops at present 
followed is, \st, oats; 2/, oats; Sd, green crop; 4/, barley or 
oats ; and in some cases, but rarely, wheat with grass seeds ; Mh, 
rye-grass hay mown, and then the land is allowed to lie in pasture 
for four, five, or six years, according to the number of divisions on 
the farms. It is now becoming more common than it once was, 
to omit the second crop of oats after breaking up the field, and 
to follow the ley crop immediately by a green crop. Turnips are 
now the favourite green crop, and in a great proportion are eaten 
of by sheep. On one farm in which this system is pursued, and 
where the land is mostly sown out with wheat, the rye-grass crop 
is chiefly eaten by sheep instead of being mown. Lime is much 
used for improving land, and is generally applied to the green crop 
land in spring, before the turnips are sown. It is also laid upon 
old pasture lands to improve the grass. 

Lwe-Stock. — The most common breed of cattle is the Gallowav. 
which is much esteemed for the ease with which it is fattened, and 
for the quality of the beef. On one extensive farm the short- 
horned breed has been introduced. It grows to a greater weight 
than the native breed, and is fit for the shambles at an earlier age. 

'Ihe sheep are chiefly a cross between the Cheviot and the Lei- 

3 



TVVYNHOLM. 



43 



cester. It is a common practice for the farmers to buy a large 
stock of sheep in autumn to eat olf their turnip crop, and then to 
send them to Liverpool by steam, when fat. But besides this, 
more lambs are bred on the farms, than there were some years 



ago. 



A areat deal has been done of late years, both by proprietors 
and tenants, in draining wet lands; and in many of the farms, 
much still remains to be done in that way. It is scarcely to be 
expected, however, that this work will be extensively engaged in, 
or substantially executed, unless the proprietors come forward to 
bear a considerable proportion of the expense; and though some 
of them are ready to render every assistance, others leave the 
whole work to the tenant, to be executed or not as he may choose. 

The duration of leases is very different, varying from three to 
nineteen years, but whether the leases be long or short, both the 
proprietors and tenants find it to be for their own interest that the 
occupants of the farms should be changed as seldom as possible, 
and hence the removal of an old tenant, if steady and industrious, 
is of rare occurrence. 

The state of the farm buildings is generally good. The inclo- 
sures might in many cases be improved. It is only within these 
few years, that thorn hedges have been introduced, and kept in a 
proper state of repair by annual dressing. Proprietors are now 
beginning to see the superiority of such fences to the old stone 
dikes, are introducing them upon their estates, and, in many in- 
stances, undertaking the care of keeping them in repair. 

The woods are generally well managed. They are mostly 
planted with about one-fourth of the plants oak; while larches, 
spruces, Scotch firs, &amp;c. are put in for nurses. As the planta- 
tions grow, the soft woods are carefully thinned out, and the oaks 
at last remain alone. The woods on the property of Compston 
show the advantage to be derived from careful management, both 
in regard to beauty and profit. 

Manufacture. — The only manufacture in the parish which is worth 
mentioning, is a mill for carding and spinning wool in the village of 
Twynholm. There is also, under the same roof, and belonging 
to the same owner, a mill for dressing flax; but both these mills 
are used solely for country purposes. The farmers and others in 
the neighbourhood bring the wool they have retained for family 
use, or the flax they may have grown for the same purpose, and 
have it prepared here for working up at their own houses.

 V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town — There is no market-town within the parish. 
The nearest market is Kirkcudbright, which is about three miles 
distant from the church; and Gatehouse, distant about six miles 
in an opposite direction. The principal cattle-market is Castle- 
douglas, distant nine miles. 

The village of Twynholm has increased considerably within 
these few years. The population is now about 250. As there is 
no manufacture to give employment to any considerable portion of 
the inhabitants, it is rather to be regretted that the population 
should increase. In country villages, where the people depend 
almost solely on agricultural labour, they are often at a loss for 
employment whenever their numbers exceed the demand of the 
immediate neighbourhood. 

Means of Communication — The great road from Carlisle to 
Portpatrick lies through the centre of the parish, and consequent- 
ly the mail passes daily to and from Dumfries, The post-town is 
Kirkcudbright, but it would be a great convenience for the parish 
if a post-office were established in the village. The turnpike roads 
are kept in excellent order, and the state of the parish roads is now 
very respectable. They have been much improved within these 
few years, principally by the exertions and contributions of the 
gentlemen connected with the parish. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is placed in the very cen- 
tre of the population, and almost in the centre of the parish, 
with easy access from all parts. The original site of the church 
was nearly a quarter of a mile distant from the place where the 
church now stands. The site was changed in 1730. The pre- 
sent church was built in 1818, and is in a good state of repair. 
The size is sufficient for the accommodation of all the parishioners. 
The only drawback is, that in the division of the church, portions 
of the area are assigned in proportion to the valuations of the dif- 
ferent heritors, not in proportion to the accommodation they require. 
Hence, while more room than is needed is allotted to one pro- 
perty, there are other properties left with very insufficient accom- 
modation, and there is almost no provision made for the village 
population. The church affords accommodation for about 410 
sitters. All the sittings are allocated. 

The manse was built in 1835-6, and is a large and convenient 
house. The glebe is large, containing about 28 acres Scots. It 
was obtained by an excambion with Lord Selkirk, the patron and 



TWYNHOliM. 



45 



principal heritor for the two glebes of Twynholm and Kirkchrist, 
about seventy years ago. 

The stipend consists of 97 bolls, 2 firlots, 2 pecks, 3f lippies of 
oatmeal, and the same quantity of barley, with L. 55, 8s. 4d. in 
money, derived from lands where the teinds are exhausted, and 
including L.8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. The average 
amount of the stipend for the last five years has been about L.226, 
Os, Ud. besides the above L.8, 6s. 8d. 

There is no other place of worship of any description within 
the parish besides the parish church. 

Number of families attending the Established Church, 145 ; 
Roman Catholics, 7; other denominations, 5; total, 157. In- 
dividuals belonging to the Established Church, 734; Roman Ca- 
tholics, 34; other denominations, 29; total, 797. The Roman 
Catholics are mostly of Irish descent. They and the Seceders 
attend their respective places of worship in Kirkcudbright. 

Divine service is well attended by the greater number of the 
parishioners. There are, however, some who are careless of di- 
vine ordinances, and who neglect to train their children in church- 
going habits. This is partly to be ascribed to the unfortunate 
circumstance, that they have no sittings in church which they can 
call their own ; but there is also a disinclination to attend. The 
average number of communicants for some years past has been 300. 

Education. — There are at present three schools in the parish. 
The parochial school is situated close by the church, and in it all 
the ordinary branches are taught, besides mathematics, Latin, and 
French to those who choose. The higher branches of learning 
are, however, seldom in demand. There is a female school at the 
Doon, in the south end of the parish. The school-house at the 
Doon was built, and a salary is allowed to the teacher by the Noble 
family of St Mary's Isle, who also take a deep interest in the pro- 
sperity of the school, and pay it frequent visits. The parochial 
schoolmaster has the maximum salary, and his fees may amount 
to from L.12 to L.15 a-year. A Sabbath school has been in ope- 
ration for four years, and much benefit has been derived from it. 
The average attendance at present is about 50. Several of the 
children of Roman Catholic families attend, and seem to take as 
much interest in the religious instruction, as the children of Pro- 
testants. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid for some years back has been about 20, 



4G 



KIUKCUDBRIGHTSIIIRE. 



besides 3 fatuous individuals who receive aid from a voluntary as- 
sessment of L.24 made by the heritors. To meet the demands 
thus occasioned, there are collections in church averaginr L.35 ; 
regular donations from nonresident heritors, L.6, Is.; interest of 
L.60 in bank, about L.l, 10s. ; Do. of L.40 in private hands 
L.l, 8s. ; total, L.43, 19s. There are, besides these, occasional 
donations from heritors and others connected with the parish, and 
donations made to the kirk-session on the occasion of proclama- 
tions. It is much to be feared, that, unless the burden be dimi- 
nished by some means, the funds in the hands of the kirk-session 
will be exhausted, and then recourse must be had to a legal as- 
sessment. A voluntary assessment of L.20 was made by the he- 
ritors in the spring of 1839, to make up a deficiency which had 
accumulated in the course of the four preceding years, and thus 
to prevent the funds in the hands of the kirk-session being touched 
in the meantime. 

Inns. — There are only two inns in the parish ; one in the village, 
on the great road between Carlisle and Portpatrick, and the other 
at the ferry opposite to Kirkcudbright. Both are necessary; but 
the number should not be increased. -f- 

Fuel — The fuel used is almost solely coal from Cumberland, 
which is brought to Tongland harbour, within two miles of the 
centre of the parish. For some time back, individuals have sent 
or gone to Dalmellington for Scotch coal. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The system of agriculture has been much improved since the 
time when the last Statistical Account was written, and improve- 
ments are still in progress. The rental has consequently been 
greatly increased. In 1794, the rental was L.2960. It now 
amounts to about L.6250, being more than double the former 
amount. 

At that time there were only a few old trees about Compston, 
and the plantations along the Dee had been newly made. These 
plantations have now grown to be both profitable and ornamental, 
and a good deal has been planted in other parts of the parish. It 
would be of advantage, and would add greatly to the beauty of the 
scenery, were the plantations to be extended still farther. In many 

 For some years back, the heritors have found it necessary to raise a voluntary 
assessment annually to meet the deficiencies occasioned by increased demands. 

+ Since the above was written another public-house has been established in tiie 
village, and though the person who keeps it is of a respectable character, still the 
evils anticipated have arisen from its establishment.

parts of the parish, still farther improvements might be made by 
drainino-, &amp;c., which would increase the value of the land, and 
give occupation to the poor for a time. The introduction of steam 
navio-ation into the Dee has been of advantage to Twynholm, by 
openino- up the Liverpool market for sheep and fat cattle. In 
consequence of this, the turnip husbandry has been greatly ex- 
tended, and it might be extended still farther with advantage to 
the tenant and to the land. 

It is desirable in a parish situated like Twynholm, that pro- 
prietors should not grant feus, as when houses are built they will 
be occupied, and thus there is introduced a population for which 
there is no employment. The evils arising from the introduction 
of such a population are obvious.

PRESBYTERY OF KIRCUDBRIGHT, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name and Date of Erection. — Borgue, Senwick, and Kirkan- 
drews, as stated in the former Statistical Report, were united 
about the year 1670. Borgue, or Borg, the general name of the 
united parishes, is derived from the Gaelic word burg, which sig- 
nifies a little hill, and is certainly very descriptive either of the 
situation of the church, which is situated on a beautiful eminence 
in the middle of the parish, or of the general appearance of the 
district of land, which is remarkably unequal in its surface. Sen- 
wick, originally Sandwick, is compounded of sand, and wick, 
signifying a narrow neck of land. This is also very descriptive 
both of the situation and the soil. Kirkandrews evidently takes 
its name from the tutelary saint of Scotland, to whom it was dedi- 
cated. 

Figure and Extent, — The parish of Borgue presents in our 
county map, the figure of a triangle, of which the Solway forms the 

• Drawn up by the Rev. Samuel Smith, late Minister of the parish. 



48 



KIRKOUDBRIGHTSIIIUE. 



base ; the parish of Girthon, with a small portion of the river 
Fleet, one of the bounding sides ; and the parish of Twynholm, 
with three miles of the estuary of the Dee, the other boundary 
line, — the vertex of the triangle being inserted like a wedge be- 
tween these parishes. The greatest length is 10 miles, the greatest 
breadth 7. Its area may be computed at 25 square miles. 

Topographical Appearance. — Along the southern coast, this pa- 
rish offers a frontier of hard, and in some places precipitous rocks, 
to the waves of the Solway ; which during the prevalence of the 
south-west winds, beat against it with great violence. At the 
Ross Hill and the Heads, called Borness and Muncraig, the cliffs 
rise to so great a height, and are disposed in forms so irregular 
and fantastic, as to be objects of much interest to the admirers of 
bold and picturesque scenery. The giddy heights over which you 
look downwards to the surging tide ; remoter cliffs peaked and 
insulated, severed from the mainland ; the restless flight and wild 
outcry of sea-fowl, scared from their perch; accompanied with 
the impression that for countless generations these same battle- 
ments on which you stand, have thus frowned defiance on the 
angry waters of the Atlantic, and repelled their fierce assaults ; 
are fitted to awaken sentiments which at least border upon the 
sublime. 

From the top of the Ross Hill, or from the island called Little 
Ross, a prospect meets the view, combining a wide expanse of 
sea, with a great variety of vale and mountain scenery. In parti- 
cular, St Mary's Isle, clothed with wood of the finest foliage, and 
partially screening the course of the Dee, and the picturesque 
town of Kirkcudbright; the lofty mountain ranges of Cumberland, 
on the east ; the Isle of Man ; and the coast of Wigtonshire, are 
striking features in this lively prospect. 

The most level tracts in the parish, are those which have for- 
merly served as the beds of fresh water lakes. Enclosed by hills 
of every shape and form, these lakes were at one time very nume- 
rous. The greater part have now been carried away by deep 
drains, though enough still remain to furnish supplies of water to 
all the farms, not only for the purposes of agriculture, but also to 
give varieties of battlefield to the curlers, when the season comes 
round for enjoying their exhilarating sport. 

Hydrography. — It may be mentioned, as the only circumstance 
worthy of notice under this head, that the whole sea-coast bears 
distinctraarks of the sea havin g retreated in a gradual manner 



liORGUR. 



49 



from our shores. So far as can be judged from the rounded form 
of the stones, that form the now dry sea-beach, the regular hues 
of embankment raised at former periods by the waves, and the 
sand and shells cast up in other places where the coast is less 
rocky; we would infer it as a point clearly demonstrated, that 
the tide formerly rose at least twelve feet higher than it now does; 
in which case, it is evident that much of the low land of which 
our carses consist, was once under water. 

There are appearances from which it might be suspected that, 
at a time still more remote, the tide had risen a great deal higher 
on our shores, but these are of a much less decisive character. 

Geology, Soil, 8fc. — The rocks of this, as of the adjoining pa- 
rishes belong to the transition class; forming a ramification of the 
great series, which is said to extend from St Abb's Head to Port- 
patrick. The rocks which predominate are greywacke, greyvvacke 
slate, and clay slate. The former of these, named provincially 
whinstone, is of blue or greyish colour, breaking irregularly; 
yet, as being of a very compact texture, and impervious to moisture, 
it answers as well as granite or the best sandstone, for the purposes 
of house or dike building. The rocks of this description, may be 
examined to advantage, any where along the shores of Borgue. 
They are in some places very distin.ctly stratified. At the Ross 
and Muncraigs Heughs, this is particularly noticeable, the beds 
being arranged in a variety of positions, often covered, and form- 
ing in many instances an angle of seventy or eighty degrees with 
the horizon, the dip being from the north-east to the south-west. 
In some instances strata of different inclinations are seen to meet, 
presenting in that case the form of a series of Gothic arches, risino- 
one above another. Underneath the lowest of these, it occasion- 
ally happens, as may be supposed, that an empty space is left, 
whence originate the caves that are so frequent, and so attractive 
to lovers of the marvellous, on our Galloway shores. Whilst the 
rock above-mentioned forms the principal component part in the 
hills of this parish, there is connected with it, and usually incum- 
bent upon it, another, which might appear to belong to a later 
formation. This latter is a soft, shivering, argillaceous stone, but 
partially stratified, mixed with earth of a reddish colour, and which, 
on exposure to the atmosphere, soon crumbles down to a soft or 
earthy slate. It is of the same nature probably as the shiver 
German schiefer of English miners. 
These rocks alternate with each other over the surface in nn

regular order, and are often observed in different portions of the 
sattie field. We are inclined to attribute the singular irregula- 
rity of the surface of Borgue to the circumstance now mentioned : 
wherever the grey wacke has penetrated the bed of slate band, there 
a knoll makes its appearance ; but where the stratum or covering 
of slate band is deeper, there is a body of arable soil of more uni- 
form thickness. 

Soil. — The soil which prevails most is what agriculturists term 
a free loam. This soil being derived, for the most part, from the 
rock last mentioned, contains the same component elements, but 
varies in its powers of nutrition according to the basis on which it 
rests, or other elements, such as sand and clay, with which it is oc- 
casionally mixed. Liable to be parched in dry weather, it pro- 
duces in favourable seasons the most nutritious grasses, and is also 
well adapted for oats and barley. It wants depth and tenacity for 
wheat cropping, which was never successfully practised, and has 
long been entirely abandoned by the Borgue farmers. In those 
parts of the parish where the harder rocks reach the surface, a 
thinner and colder soil may be observed. 

Under this general head, notice may be taken of an alluvial 
deposit, which is not, indeed, peculiar to Borgue, but which here 
bears an unusually large proportion to the other soils, and is at 
the same time most obviously of a perfectly distinct character. 
We refer to that remarkable formation of hills which, from their 
shape or some other circumstance, are in Galloway called Drums. 
Of these there are not fewer than thirty in Borgue, which may 
average one-fourth of a mile in length, and from 200 to 300 yards 
across. The following are the most remarkable circumstances that 
have been noticed, as to their structure and composition. 1. They 
have no conformity, either in shape or in the materials of which 
they consist, with the lands adjoining. 2. Their form is that of 
a segment of a cylinder, having an elevation that varies from 50 
10 150 feet, and falling away at each extremity by a gradual slope 
to the ground contiguous. 3. Those which have been examined 
in this and the adjoining parishes, with one or two partial excep- 
tions, extend lengthways from north to south, with a slight incli- 
nation to the south-east. 4. In most instances, the ground ad- 
joining, at least on one side, is low and marshy. 5. In no instan- 
ces that we are aware of, do they contain any solid rocks, nor any 
alluvial materials but what have the appearance of having been 
transported from a considerable distance; whilst some of the com- 



BOUGUE.

ponent substances, the granite stones or boulders more particu- 
larly, must of necessity have been borne to their present position 
from a distance of several miles, as the nearest granite moun- 
tains are those in Girthon and Twynholm, eight miles distant. 
G. The stones, both of a larger and smaller size, have that round- 
ed form which commonly results from the action of water. 

It would be presumptuous in one, but slightly acquainted with 
the elements of geology, to theorize as to the origin of this de- 
scription of hills, or the causes by which their singular formation 
has been determined. It does, however, appear to the writer, 
that the subject is well worthy the careful consideration of those 
who are more conversant with this interesting science. Nor does 
it seem rash to conjecture, that a rigid scrutiny of the phenomena 
which they present in various parts of the country, would reflect 
light on the action to which the earth's surface has in former times 
been subjected, and the agents by which that action was caused. 

The soil now mentioned might seem well suited for tillage, be- 
ing smooth and unbroken. In reality, it is found the most worth- 
less of our Galloway lands. So tenacious is the subsoil, consist- 
ing of a hard gravelly clay, without any alluvial matter, that the 
superfluous moisture in wet weather cannot sink through it ; nor 
again in dry seasons does the moisture make its way upwards to the 
roots of the plants. Draining, after the manner of tile-draining, 
has lately been tried by a spirited proprietor, and appears likely 
to be attended with favourable results. 

Mines.— An unsuccessful attempt was recently made to discover 
copper ore on the estate of Earlston. Iron was found, but not 
of a rich description. 

Botany.— As already stated, there is here a very considerable 
variety of soil and exposure. The sea coast presents an excellent 
fleld for investigation, and the broken nature of the land aff"ords 
facilities to the botanist, which a more closely cultivated district 
would deny. The following may serve as a specimen of the Flora 
of Borgue, all the plants mentioned, being met with in greater or 
less abundance in diff'erent parts of the parish.

Zoology — Fishes. — From the limited opportunity of collecting 
information, the report on this and the following heads is neces- 
sarily very imperfect. 

Salmon, it is well known, frequent the Dee in great numbers. 
But all the nets which as yet have been productive, are erected 
above that part of the river which is bounded by the Borgue 
shores. Were the tacksman at liberty to extend stake-nets far 
enough across the extensive sands which form the eastern boundary 
of the parish, a considerable quantity of fish might probably be 
taken there. The interests of other proprietors, it would appear, 
does not admit of this. Last year, a fishery was established below 
the bar, at the mouth of the river. The nets here employed are 
of that kind so well known on the east coast of Scotland by the 
name of bag-net. This kind of net, so common elsewhere, is em- 
ployed in no other part of the river. At the Ross, it has been found 
to answer very well. As the present is only the second year of this 
fishery, no proper return can be given. Hitherto, we believe the 
fishing has proved remunerating. The salmon caught are of the 
finest quality, being accounted the best of any taken in the Dee. 
A salmon fishery, which was also attempted for the first time 
this season off" the South Park shore, at the entrance into Brig 
house Bay, has proved, for the present, a losing concern. At 
times, a good many salmon were taken ; but, as we are informed, 
the supply was so unsteady, that the returns would not cover the 
outlay. This remark will also apply to the fisheries formerly at- 
tempted at Kirkandrews and Knockbrex, and which are now 
abandoned. Bag-nets were used at South Park; at the other 
two places, the common stake-net was employed. 

Off" the Ross, there is excellent white fishing ground, and du- 
ring winter, the fishing at this station proves very remunerating 
to the few fishermen belonging to our coast, who engage in it to 

a limited extent. 

As there is no regular demand in the neighbourhood, and only 
one opportunity per week by steam to Liverpool, there is no in- 
ducement to the expenditure of capital in smacks or trawl-nets. 
The Whitehaven boats very often travel over this ground. It is 



150RGUE.

also visited at times by boats from Liverpool. These boats fish 
principally for soles. 

Amonofst the fishes caught in the Dee or off the coast, are, 
salmon, grilse, sea-trout and herling, plaice, soles, and several of 
the common kinds of flounders ; gurnard, two kinds ; mullet, ray  
or skate, ling, cod, whiting, bream, fishing-frog, and dog-fish. 
Eels of a considerable size are very abundant. Porpoises are 
common off the coast. Among those which visit the Dee occa- 
sionally are mackerel and herrings. Last year, several fine had- 
docks were caught off the Ross, said to be the first time they were 
seen on the Borgue coast. Blochan, as they are here named, are at 
times met with in considerable numbers. They seldom remain 
above two or three tides. Simpson, who wrote an account of the 
state of Galloway towards the close of the seventeenth century, 
bears testimony to the excellence of the white fishings of Borgue 
in these words : " Upon the coast are many sorts of white fish, 
one kind whereof is called by the inhabitants grey heads, which 
are a very fine white fish, big like haddocks, some greater, some 
lesser." 

Birds. — Under this head may be mentioned, pheasant, par- 
tridge, black grouse, snipe, and landrail, wild duck, widgeon, se- 
veral kinds of teal, the golden plover, the coot, woodcock, lapwing, 
heron, night-hawk, and several of the more common kinds of 
hawks : — on the sea coast, five or six kinds of gulls, cormorant, 
puffin, sea-pyet, curlew, red-shank, sheldrake, goshawks, which 
build on the cliffs at Ross and Muncraig. Ravens also are always 
to be found about the Ross. 

11. — Civil History. 
Antiquities, 8fc. — Borgue possesses its share of those rude mo- 
numents, by which the deeds and character of our ancestors, ante- 
cedent to the period of written history, are saved from utter ob- 
livion. 

The British forts, or, as are they vulgarly called, moats, are 
probably the most ancient of these. Five of them are to be seen 
in Borgue,— two in low sheltered situations, having a considerable 
stream of water flowing past on the one side. Two others are on 
the summits of high hills, and command an extensive view of the 
surrounding country in all directions. The following are the di- 
mensions of that near High Borgue, called the moat or Dun of 
Boreland : height from the bottom of the foss, 30 feet ; width of 
foss at bottom, 12 feet; do. at top, 40 feet; circumference of 



54 KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE. 

moat at top, 300 feet. There adjoins this another in a lower si- 
tuation, and of somewhat larger extent, which, at one period, was 
evidently surrounded with water. In the lake whose waters had 
once surrounded this fort, fragments of spears and an old silver 
coin, as mentioned in the former report, have been found. 

There are no traces of Roman occupancy in this or the adjoin- 
ing parishes to the west of the Dee, lower down than Balmaghie 
and Kells. It seems probable, from this circumstance, that the 
Roman legions crossed over from the territory of the Selgovae, 
where their remains are numerous, at some ford higher up the ri- 
ver ; and directed their course to Wigtonshire, through the moun- 
tainous range extending from New Galloway to Newton- Stewart. 

There are two other strengths similar to those already describ- 
ed, which are considered to have been Danish forts, having a re- 
markable situation on the range of the high cliffs at Borness and 
Muncraig. That on the Borness shore has been protected on the 
landward side by a double trench of considerable depth, whilst a 
precipice of 200 feet perpendicular height rendered it sufficiently 
secure from any assault by water, with which, indeed, it is nearly 
surrounded. 

Next to the moats, the works of art in Borgue which bear the 
stamp of greatest antiquity, are the ruins of what appears to have 
been a castle of considerable strength, on the side of a small bay 
half a mile westward from Kirkandrews. The foundations only of 
this building, which bears the name of Castle Hayne, can now be 
traced, indicating, however, that the walls have been of great 
thickness and some extent. No mortar has been used to cement 
the stones,— the interstices having been filled with earth and rub- 
bish. 

At the entrance of Ross Bay, on a promontory called Mano 
Point, may still be traced the foundations of a strong wall, which 
had enclosed a triangular piece of ground, somewhat less than an 
acre in extent. The character of this ruin is not unlike that near 
Kirkandrews. It is described by Simpson as the ruins of a castle, 
of which no traditions were then extant. The links of a gold or 
silver chain and some other antique remains have been found here; 
but not of such a defined character as to show whether they be- 
loncred to the British, Roman, Irish, or Saxon period of our his-

their picturesque situation ; belong, it is probable, to the fifteenth 
or sixteenth centuries, and have not, for about 150 years, been 
applied to the uses for which they were respectively designed. 

Kirkandrews village itself is represented as a place of some note 
in earlier times. Here, according to Simpson, and before his day, 
horse and foot races were periodically exhibited, and fairs were 
held within the precincts of the burying-ground, where multi- 
tudes from all quarters assembled. Not far distant, at the farm 
called Rottraw, was a tower, of which the traces have now entirely 
disappeared. 

It may be mentioned, that many of the names of places in Bor- 
gue, such as Auchenhay, Knocbrex, Kildrarroch, Risk, Barma- 
gahan, give evidence that a Celtic or Celto- Irish people once in- 
habited the country. 

Eminent Characters. — The following may be mentioned as hav- 
ing some claim at least to local celebrity. James Menteith was 
minister of Borgue for upwards of forty years at the close, of the 
seventeenth, and beginning of the eighteenth century. He was 
called from Kilmarnock, whither he had come from Ireland a few 
years before, by the heritors of Borgue, and the presbytery of 
Kirkcudbright. Menteith is described by the older inhabitants, 
on the report of a preceding generation, as a man of remarkable 
piety and zeal ; but as having his mind tinctured, in a considerable 
degree, with the superstition of these times. 

A manuscript account of his ministerial life and experience, ac- 
companied with his last advices to his children, is about to be pub- 
lished, and will be found well worthy of perusal. 

Thomas Rainy, a native of Carleton, in the parish of Borgue, 
left his native country about the middle of the last century, and, 
having realized a considerable fortune in the Island of Dominica, 
he entered into a correspondence with the minister and heritors 
of Borgue, with a view to ameliorate the circumstances of the 
poor, and the moral and spiritual condition of the parish. The 
result of this correspondence was a compact with the heritors, by 
which, whilst they agree to make a handsome addition to the mi- 
nister's stipend, Mr Rainy engages to mortify L.3000 for building 
and helping to endow an academy, and a considerable additional 
sum for behoof of the poor's funds, to be at the disposal of the 
kirk-session. 

These conditions have been handsomely fulfilled by both par- 
ties, and Borgue, since the year 1803, has possessed one of the 



56 



KIUKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE. 



most flourishing and best conducted academies in the south of 
ScotUind. The correspondence above-mentioned reflects much 
credit on the talents, and the warm and enlightened patriotism of 
Mr Rainy. 

An Agricultural Survey of Galloway, which embodies much 
useful information on the subject of which it treats ; was drawn up, 
in the year 1808, by the late Rev. S. Smith, then minister of 
Borgue. 

Land-owners. — The principal land-owners are, the Earl of Sel- 
kirk ; Sir John Gordon of Earlston, Bart. ; Alexander Murray, 
Esq. of Broughton, M. P. for the county ; James Murray M'Cul- 
loch, Esq. of Ardwal ; Andrew Pringle, Esq. of Borgue ; Adam 
Currie, Esq. of Dunrod, &amp;c. Of these, Sir John Gordon alone 
is resident. 

Fifty years ago, there were a great many residing proprietors, 
whose estates have now fallen into other hands. 

Mansion- House. — At Earlston, a very handsome and spacious 
mansion-house has lately been erected, which, with its thriving 
and extensive woods, is now regarded as forming the principal or- 
nament of the parish.

speak in favourable terms. They may be characterized in general

still a minor.

as charitable, yet frugal, cheerful, industrious, and well informed, 
according to the stations which they occupy. 

Smuo-alincr, which at one time prevailed to a great extent, is 
now extinct. It will be well for us when the same can be 
said of poaching, a practice which is at present the source ot 
grievous injury to the morals of this and several adjoinmg parishes. 
The facilities possessed for transporting game by the steam-packet 
which now plies betwixt Liverpool and Kirkcudbright, has tended 
to augment this mischief. 

The provincial, if not national, games of quoits and curling are 
practised in Borgue with unabated ardour. From an early pe- 
riod, the youth of the parish discoyer something like an innate 
relish for the latter of these sports ; and it is not until his sinews 
have been unstrung by the feebleness of declining life, that the 
veteran curler reluctantly forbears to wield his broom. The 
friendly parties who visit our rink from neighbouring parishes, we 
have reason to believe, uniformly carry home a good report of the 
reception they meet with here. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — 

The number of acres occasionally in tillage is 8300 imperial measure 
uncultivated, . 4364 

Total, . . 12,864 

It is not considered that any part of what is now uncultivated 
could, with advantage, be brought under tillage. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of land may be stated at 
17s. per acre. That of arable land, at L.l. 

The average rent for grazing is at the rate of L.4 for an ox, 
and L.6 for a cow, if straw or coarse hay be given on the field. 
Without any fodder, for an ox, L.3; for a cow, L.4, 4s.; for a 
sheep, I83. 

Wages. — To a common labourer in summer, 2s. ; in winter. 
Is. 6d. An artisan in summer, 3s. ; in winter, 2s. 

Live-Stoch — Cattle are almost exclusively of the Galloway 
breed, and the greatest attention is paid by the farmers to have 
their stock pure, and of the most correct symmetry. The remark 
of the former reporter is as applicable as ever, that " the farmers 
here are as attentive to the shapes of cattle as a jockey to the 
proportions of a horse. Even an eye or an ear is not to be over- 
looked." Some of their observations may appear whimsical, but 
in general they are certainly well founded, for one of good pro-

KIRKCUDnUIGHTSUIRE. 



portions is always easily kept, soon fattened, and, as Mr Ramsay 
has observed, " commonly tells well at the end of the balance." 
The sheep pastured here, for some time, chiefly consisted of the 
Leicester breed ; and, more recently, a breed from the Cheviot ewe, 
crossed with the Leicester ram, has been preferred, as more hardy, 
and the mutton superior. 

Husbandry. — The recent introduction of bone manure, and the 
opportunity afforded of communication by steam with the English 
markets, have materially aff'ected the system of husbandry of this 
district. 

Turnip husbandry has very much increased ; the soil of Borgue 
is particularly well adapted for it ; and, from its kindly dry nature, 
is likely to derive from it permanent benefit. At the same time, 
from the unarable character of the surface in many fields, and 
from the lightness of the soil, it is not desirable to push tillage 
beyond the necessities of the winter fodder required for cattle, on 
most of the farms. 

The rotation of cropping considered to be the best adapted for 
the parish in general is the following : lst year, a crop of oats; 27, 
turnips ; 3cf, barley or oats ; Ath, hay or pasture ; bth, pasture ; 
Gth, do. ; 1th, do ; and so on for two or three years more if the 
contingencies of the farm will admit ; care being taken to lime and 
dung the fellow sufficiently, and to feed off" with sheep. Land 
thus partially grazed, on account of the nutritive qualities of its 
pasture, pays better than under a close system of tillage. 

Improvements, §-c.— For some time after the close of the war, 
agriculture was in a state of stagnation. During the last fifteen 
years, improvements have again advanced rapidly. By Sir John 
Gordon, extensive plantations have been outspread along the steep 
slopes of his demesne and the adjoining farms ; much has also been 
done by the same spirited proprietor in draining and cultivating 
moss ; a considerable extent of which, in the neighbourhood of his 
policy, is now converted into good meadow. Mr Ireland of Rat- 
traw has also planted and enclosed, in a very judicious manner, a 
considerable extent of his property in Borgue. 

Many of the farms on the Earl of Selkirk's estate have, in the 
course of a few years, completely changed their appearance. This 
is partly due to the intelligence and enterprise of his tenantry, — 
but still more to the liberal encouragement given by his Lordship 
for liming and draining wherever required. 

The good effects of judicious liming are also apparent on the 



BORGUE. 59 

lands of Borgue, and Low Carleton, which yield not less than 
a third we believe it might be stated at a half, more produce 
than before the application of this powerful stimulant. 

The farm-steadings and enclosures which, forty years ago, were 
of the most miserable description, are now in general good and 
sufficient. 

Fe7ices.—Stone walls from five to six feet in height, are the 
fences in common use. For constructing these, Borgue enjoys 
the advantage of numerous quarries, which yield an abundant sup- 
ply of stones of the best description. 

The soil is considered too hard and rocky for planting hedges, 
— at the same time, with right management, this useful fence 
might be more frequently employed, and would be found service- 
able in giving the shelter so much wanted in exposed situations 
against the severe gales which are here prevalent. 

Leases. — The land-owners of Borgue, to the hurt of their te- 
nants and the injury of their estates, were for some time very 
backward in giving leases, and much of the land was let from year 
to year. The views of proprietors on this point appear now to be 
changed, and the lands of Borgue are let for the most part on 
leases varying from fifteen to nineteen years. 

Produce. — The following table furnishes as accurate an ac- 
count as can well be given of the amount and value of the gross 
produce. We have not the means of coming at the exact truth 
on each head. 

Grain of all kinds from 1500 English acres, 25 bushels per acre, equal 
to 37,500 bushels, most part potato, Hopetoun, and common oats.

Manufactures. — Besides the produce of two handloom weavers, 
.there are no manufactures. As there is a sufficiency of water 
power, it is not improbable that mills may hereafter be erected. 

Navigation. — The proximity of a safe and commodious harbour, 
has induced one of our enterprising farmers to build two vessels of 
considerable size, for the exportation of grain and other produce ; 
and for importing coals, lime, and such other articles as are want- 
ed for home consumption. Our ports are visited also by other 
coasting vessels, as occasion requires. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market- Totvns. — Gatehouse and Kirkcudbright are nearly at 
equal distances from Borgue. The market day of the former is 
Saturday, of the latter, Friday, — and about an equal number from 
Borgue attend each. Cattle are bought and sold, either at home 
or at the Castle Douglas market, held on Monday, to which, 
though more distant, many of our farmers repair. 

Roads. — The great turnpike road from London to Portpatrick 
passes through Borgue at the distance of three miles from the pa- 
rish church. This, as well as the other roads in the parish, is 
kept in excellent repair, though unfortunately the funds raised 
for keeping up the roads have been burdened with a considerable 
debt, which renders the present assessment somewhat oppressive 
to the tenantry on whom it has been laid. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is conveniently situated, 
as nearly as possible in the centre of the parish. It is seated to 
accommodate about 500 persons, and is remarkably well attended, 
whenever the weather permits the more distant part of the popu- 
lation to come out. 

The church is a modern Gothic structure, elegant in its de- 
sign, and conspicuous on all hands, even at a great distance, in 
consequence of its elevated situation. 

The manse, built in 1802, is commodious and in good repair. 
As the population has increased above 100 since the church 
was built in 1814, additional accommodation is now urgently called 
for. This, indeed, maybe furnished without much trouble or ex-

pense, as the aisle admits of a gallery being erected at a conveni- 
ent distance from the pulpit, and in such a way as to obtain suffi- 
cient lioht and elevation, without incommoding the area beneath. 

The'three glebes, Kirkandrews, Senwick, and Borgue, which 
are still disjoined, contain above 20 acres of good arable land, 
which was greatly improved by the two former incumbents. 

The teinds are exhausted, and yield, exclusive of the grant from 
heritors of L.50 per annum, L.220. 

At the last dispensation of the Sacrament 1840 of .the Lord's 
Supper, the number of communicants, including a very few strangers, 
was 307, — considerably more than a third of the whole population. 
From this it may be seen that the number of persons belonging 
to other denominations is inconsiderable. Their relative numbers 
may be stated as follows : Established Church, 965 ; Baptists, 8 ; 
United Secession, 10; Roman Catholics, 12. 

An association for prayer, and for promoting the Schemes of 
the General Assembly, was formed some time ago. Its meetings 
are held on the first Monday of every month. 

Education. — The Borgue Academy, conducted by a rector and 
assistant, enjoys a deserved celebrity as a classical, but especially 
as a commercial seminary. In addition to the emoluments deriv- 
ed from Mr Rainy's mortification, which, from circumstances con- 
nected with the manner of investment, as well as the present low 
rate of interest, now fall greatly short of the founder's design and 
expectation ; the head master receives the maximum salary, and 
is paid, except by 20 free scholars, a rate of wages varying, ac- 
cording to the branches taught, from Is. 6d. to 5s. Out of these 
funds, which may amount from L.llO to L.120, the usher's salary 
is paid. The number of children who attend the academy ave- 
rages 120, — nearly the whole of these belong to the parish. 

A school for sewing and reading is kept in the village by a fe- 
male teacher on her own adventure. Forty children, for the most 
part under eight years of age, attend this school, and, besides 
the branches mentioned, are carefully instructed in spelling, writ- 
ing, and grammar. The average number of children attending 
the public schools may therefore be stated at 160 scholars. 

For several years, classes for religious instruction, under the 
direction of the minister and rector of the academy, have been 
taught according to the methods now commonly pursued, on the 
afternoon of the Sabbath. From 60 to 70 children attend. 
There are two other Sabbath schools, conducted by ladies in re- 



kirkcudbhightshire. 

mote quarters of the parish, at which from 20 to 30 children re- 
ceive sound instruction in the elements of saving knowledge. 

Library. — A library has lately been formed in connection with 
the Sabbath schools. The funds, which have not yet risen to 

any considerable amount, were derived from private donations, 

a few of the heritors having kindly contributed. The volumes 
are partly religious, partly suited for general instruction and en- 
tertainment. 

A private subscription library, for religious reading, was also 
set on foot some years ago. There are sixteen sharers, who 
subscribe 2s. 6d. per annum, with 2s. 6d. additional at entry. A 
new volume is purchased monthly, which is put in circulation, 
and makes its round, remaining for a month in the hands of each 
subscriber. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of poor on 
our roll may be stated at 26 ; the average allowance at L.3 per 
annum. The entire funds at the disposal of the session amount 
to above L.70 ; but these funds are burdened with the salary of 
the precentor and the beadle, and other contingencies. L.40 
or thereby are derived from the ordinary collections, the re- 
mainder from the interest of Mr Rainy's, and another small mor- 
tification. 

Though our poor are by no means discontented, nor disposed 
to burden the parish with their aliment, so long as they are able 
by any honest means to earn a meagre subsistence, yet we can- 
not say, that, from the funds above-mentioned, adequate provision 
is made for their wants. Cases of much hardship and privation 
often come under our notice ; and though we can always appeal 
with confidence to many of our kind and charitably disposed pa- 
rishioners, we could wish at the same time to have an ampler 
treasury at our disposal. 

Inns. — There are five licensed inns or ale-houses, three at 
least of which are uncalled for by the necessities of the place. 

Fuel. — Peats were formerly abundant. The fuel now univer- 
sally used is coal, which is imported, of excellent quality, from 
the coal-pits of Cumberland, at the price varying from L.l to 
L.I, 6s. per 24 bushels.

PRESBYTERY OF KIRKCUDBRIGHT, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY. 

THE REV. DUGALD STEWART WILLIAMSON, MINISTER. 



L — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Extent, Boundaries, — The derivation of the name, 
which is spelt Tungland, Tongueland, but more commonly Tong- 

 The last Statistical Account of Tongland, written in 1793, bears the name of 
the Rev. William Robb ; but it is generally understood to have been supplied by his 
brother Alexander, at that time his assistant and afterwards his successor, who sur- 
vived him nine years, and died in the prime of life in 1806, after a short and sud- 
den illness. He enjoyed a considerable local reputation as a man of science, a man 
of letters, and a man of wit. His wit was principally discharged in satirical effu- 
sions, sometimes in prose and sometimes in verse, on incidents and personages of 
such dignity as the parish or county could afford. Those which I have seen are 
coarse and vigorous productions, executed in a style of broad humour, and well fitted 
to excite both the merriment and the fear of the humble class of readers for whom 
they were intended. I am informed by those who remember him that, in conversa- 
tion, he was Huent and original, ranging over a variety of subjects, but always wil- 
ling to escape from the grave and instructive to the grotesque and comical, without 
much regard either to the disposition of the company or the suitableness of the oc- 
casion. His fame for science seems to have arisen chiefly from his knowledge of 
scientific men, with some of the most eminent of whom, in the last age, he was in 
habits of intercourse. He had a turn for practical mechanics, and I have heard it 
stated, but I do not know on what authority, that he was the inventor of some inge- 
nious contrivances about the loom. That he was a man of literary ambition is evi- 
dent, from his having spent a portion of his best days in composing two works, one 
entitled " The History of the Reformation in Italy," and the other, " The Philo- 
sophy of Religion." These compositions were shown in manuscript to some of the 
principal literary men of the day, but, whether from their wanting literary merit, 
or exhibiting too much freedom of opinion, the publication was discouraged, and the 
author abandoned the idea. If I may judge from such slight specimens as I have 
seen of his composition, I should pronounce him to have been totally unfit to con- 
duct a grave or elaborate work, having been not only destitute of grace and even co- 
herence in his writing, but, as appears from his frequent blunders in orthography 
without the advantagesof a finished or regular education. Whatever may have been the 
execution of these works, however, the selection of topics was felicitous, both havinr 
been since handled by two popular writers, The Philosophy of Religion," by Mr Diik 
of Perth, and » The History of the Reformation in Italy," by the well-known Dr 
M'Crie. But, humble as the rank to which publication would, in all likelihood, have 
consigned him, he was undoubtedly a man of liberal curiosity and of active intellec- 
tual habits. Having gathered, by extreme and protracted frugality, a considerable 
sum of money, he determined, a few years before his death, to indulge his appetite for 
information by making a tour upon the continent, and after obtaining leave of ab 
sence fiom his presbytery, for that purpose, he spent nearly two years in travelling 
through France and Italy, principally, 1 believe, on foot. The accounts of hi 
adventures which he gave on his return to his friends were thought liiohlv amus

land, is unknown. The general supposition is, that the name is 
descriptive of the shape, which is broadest at the northern extre- 
mity, but tapers towards the south till it terminates in a point with- 
in high water mark, formed by the confluence of the Dee and the 
Tarff. This derivation is countenanced by Chalmers in his Cale- 
donia, — a work of great learning and industry, but, as might have 
been expected in an undertaking which promises minute local infor- 
mation, very frequently erroneous. The etymology is conjectural, 
and so are several others which I have heard, connecting the 
name with adventures of remote antiquity, but, although of some 
interest, resting on authority too trivial to warrant their insertion 
here. 

The parish is about eight miles in length from north to south, 
and varies in breadth from three miles to half-a mile. It is se- 
parated from the parishes of Kirkcudbright and Kelton on the 
east, by the Dee ; from the parish of Twynholm on the west, for 
two miles, by the Tarff; and on the upper part by two beautiful 
mountain lochs called Trostree and Culcagrie. The northern 
boundary is the parish of Balmaghie, from which it is not distin- 
guished by any natural limit, except for half-a mile by a loch cal- 
led Bargatton. The Tarff and Dee, at the southern extremity, 
separate it from the parishes of Twynholm and Kirkcudbright. 

Topography, 8c. — It presents considerable variety of topogra- 
phical aspect. The southern and central parts consist of a narrow 
and uneven ridge, which rises gradually from the junction of the 
two rivers. The northern part expands into broken moorlands, 
interspersed with wooded valleys and farms partially cultivated, 
but in general exhibiting a very wild and rugged appearance. The 
whole parish is arable, except an extensive farm or two at the up- 
per extremity. The slopes to the south-west and east are ex- 
tremely beautiful, and in a high state of cultivation. The soil is 
Excellent, and, owing to the elevation and aspect of the ground, the 
harvest is earlier in the lower farms than in those of the surround- 
ing parishes. No wood has been planted for many years, — nume- 
rous fine clumps of old trees are scattered up and down, but there 

even been preserved. I give this slight sketch of Mr Robb, because, although un- 
known to the world, he enjoyed some distinction in his neighbourhood, and is the 
only person recently connected with the parisli whose mental powers, had they been 
sufficiently cultivated or happily directed, might have conducted the possessor to 
eminence. The only specimen of his authorship that remains, is the Statistical Ac- 
count which bears the name of his brother. 'J'he touches of satirical humour mark 
it as the production of a man who was at least eccentric ; and some curious informa- 
tion, which it contains about the habits and character of the jjeople, is worthy of being 
preserved, and shall be referred to in the course of this article.

are no extensive plantations. In the middle of the parish, as much 
wood is grown as is necessary either for use or ornament, but in the 
lower part it is sadly wanting, a want the more to be regretted, as the 
surface is of that undulating and rocky nature which would admit 
of its being grown with much advantage both to the emolument of 
the proprietor, and the appearance of the scenery. Near the sum- 
mit of Meiklewood hill is a small loch, 15 or 20 feet in depth, 
which affords a supply of water sufficiently abundant to serve a 
thrashing-mill in the driest seasons. Being almost at the top of a 
ridge, with no hills in the vicinity from whence so much water can 
come, the springs that feed it must be brought by a subterranean 
passage from a distance of several miles, and unless they come 
from the north, which is not probable, they must flow beneath the 
channel either of the Tarff or of the Dee. If one may judge from 
the general health of the inhabitants, none of whom, however, have 
ever presented remarkable instances of longevity, the climate is sa- 
lubrious, although not in the same degree throughout every part of 
the parish. In the valley of the Tarff, typhus fever occurs more 
frequently, and to a more fatal extent than in most other districts. 
This is supposed to be partly caused by the overflowing of the 
stream, which is there deep and sluggish, and, when swollen by the 
rains of spring and autumn, inundates the meadows to a consider- 
able extent. Unfortunately too, that part of the parish is the most 
densely peopled, and principally by the poorer classes. Of the 
two rivers which form the western and eastern boundary, the Tarff 
is by much the smaller ; it has its rise in Loch Whynnion, about 
fourteen miles from the sea, and after pursuing a very winding 
course, and presenting a great variety of channel, it joins the Dee 
at Cumpston Castle. It is a beautiful, limpid stream, abounding 
with yellow trout, salmon trout, herling, and occasionally with sal- 
mon. In the middle of its course there is a waterfall, or rather a 
succession of waterfalls, called the Linn of Lairdmannoch, between 
fifty and sixty feet in height, which can be seen from a single point 
of view, and, when the stream is swollen, forms as picturesque an 
object as any thing of the kind can be imagined. The lower 
fall ,s received by a dark and deep pool, where salmon may be 
often seen disporting in the latter end of autumn. The Dee is a 
noble river, having, as well as its tributary, the Ken, a course of 
forty or fifty miles, and exhibiting in its descent many features 
both of beauty and grandeur. Perhaps the finest part of its course 
are the four miles along which it forms the eastern boundary of

this parish. Its channel is extremely rugged. Its banks are richly 
wooded with oak, birch, ash, e\m, alder, elder the bourtree, thorn, 
and hazel, and the current is, in some places, forced between per- 
pendicular rocks seventy or eighty feet in height. It is boldest 
and most striking just before it joins the sea, and is seen to 
most advantage when swollen by the rains of autumn, or by 
I the melted snows in spring. The best view of its impetuosity 
is commanded from an old two-arched bridge a little above 
high-water mark. It appears there in a straight line for near- 
ly a quarter of a mile, and, the series of rocky shelves causing 
it to rise in successive undulations, it resembles the convolutions 
of an enormous serpent, while the large streaks and patches 
of foam that diverge from their crests give an animation and a 
savage beauty to the torrent which it would be hard to match 
in many Scottish rivers. Its characteristic beauties are celebrated 
in very sweet verse by Montgomery, in his poem of the Cherry 
and the Slae," the principal scene of which is laid on the most 
picturesque part of its banks, immediately below the old bridge I 
have already alluded to. As I shall have occasion to refer again 
to this admirable production, I shall reserve such quotations as I 
mean to give in illustration of the very accurate and poetical de- 
scriptions with which it abounds. 

Geology. — Porphyry and clay slate are the prevailing rocks in 
this parish, in common with those of the neighbourhood. There 
is one remarkable geological appearance. The rocky channel of 
the Dee is composed entirely of slate, but in one place called the 
linn pool, the strata are suddenly intercepted by a vein of por- 
phyry mixed with jasper, about a foot and a half in thickness, 
which, running straight across the stream, appears on both banks, 
and is gradually lost in the vegetation and mould that cover the 
rocks. How far it may extend on either side, it is impossible, of 
course, to say. 

Botany. — The profusion and variety of plants are greater than 
their rarity. Of the water plants, the white and yellow water lily, 
the water plantain, the buckbean, the white ranunculus, the car- 
dinal flower, and the snake-weed, occur in the lochs and in the 
sluggish parts of the Tarff. Several species of the catch-fly, the 
spatling-poppy, the cotton-grass, the needle furze {Genista An- 
glica, the moon flower, the butterwort, the milkwort, the Trol- 
lius EuropcEus, the twayblade {Ophrys ovata, the snapdragon,

many species of Orchis, amongst others the white and the sweet 
smelling, are all to be found in their respective habitats, — such of 
them as are peculiar to moors and meadows being most abund- 
ant. But to a lover of botany the banks of the Dee, where they 
are most wooded and rocky, that is, for nearly a mile before it 
joins the sea, present a field both for variety and beauty which 
many days may be spent in exploring. The unusual number of 
plants is easily accounted for, by the sharp and rugged nature of 
the channel, which is well adapted to receive deposits of soil and 
seed brought down by the river. Great part of it is dry for many 
months during the year, and thus the new plants have time to 
take a firm hold, and to propagate either by the seed, the joints, 
or the root. Being both exposed to the sun, and sheltered from 
the wind, they have every advantage of locality, and spring up with 
a rapidity and profusion, of which, within so limited a spot, there 
are very few examples. Besides most of those which I have already 
mentioned, I may note the following : Jdoxa moscliatellina, agri-

It would be unpardonable to dismiss this very imperfect enu- 
meration, without adverting more particularly to the Geranium 
sanguineum, or bloody cranesbill, which grows along the banks of 
the Dee in such profusion and beauty, during the months of June 
and July, as to excite the admiration of every one who sees it. 
Many of the rocks are covered with this lovely flower. Scarcely 
inferior to it in beauty, and, in the opinion of some, even surpass- 
ing it, is the Geranium pratense, which is likewise uncommonly 
abundant ; but, being a taller and more straggling plant than the 
other, the blossoms, from the want of compactness, do not pro- 
duce the same gorgeous efl"ect. The quantity of wild honey- 
suckle, too, is immense, especially of late years ; and to one who 
has a taste for such pleasures, I can imagine nothing more en- 
chanting than a solitary walk by the side of this river on a serene 
summer evening, when the wild flowers are in full blossom, to 
gaze on the deep crimson of the cranesbill, or the graceful fes- 
toons and exquisite tint of the convolvulus, to inhale the fragrance 
of the honeysuckle and the sweetbriar, and to hear the notes of 
innumerable birds mixing with the murmur of the stream. 

In the above slight account of the botany of this parish, I have not 
noticed either the grasses or the cryptogamic plants. To attempt a 
complete enumeration of them would far exceed the limits proper to 
a work of this nature ; and it is the less necessary, as I rather 
think that there is nothing in them peculiar either to the parish 
or to the neighbourhood. However, as I have not had the oppor- 
tunity of comparing them with those in other parts of the country, 
1 may very possibly be mistaken. Many of the Jgarics are ex- 
tremely beautiful, and some of them are very large. The same

is true of the Boleti and llie Lichens. In some seasons, the com- 
mon mushroom {Agaricus cawpeatris, grows abundantly on the 
southern slopes ; but the crop is exceedingly precarious, there be- 
ing many years in which not one is to be seen. Notwithstanding 
its delicious flavour and wholesome qualities, it is neglected by the 
common people, who entertain an ungovernable prejudice against 
eating it or any of the Agaric family, for all of which they mark 
their detestation, by stigmatizing them as " paddock-stools." The 
Agaricus Xerampetinus, held in such high esteem by the ancient 
Romans, and celebrated in history as having been employed by 
Agrippina to convey poison to her husband, the Emperor Clau- 
dius, is not uncommon in our plantations. It grows to a magni- 
ficent size, I have found it sometimes with the pileus as broad as 
the crown of a common hat, and although not of a particularly 
agreeable taste, may be eaten with perfect safety. Its indifferent qua- 
lity as food has led some to wonder at the coarse taste of the Roman 
epicures, and others to doubt the accuracy of their historians, ima- 
gining that they have confounded this fungus with the Agaricus 
deliciosuSf which is still held in high repute by the modern Italians. 
The latter idea may possibly be correct; but taste of every kind 
is capable of incredible modifications. I am assured by a gentle- 
man, a native of Russia, that, at particular seasons, the Agaricus 
Xerampelinus and many other kinds, which our peasants and our 
paupers would sooner starve than taste, continue to form, as they 
have done for ages, the principal food of his healthy, long-lived, 
and athletic countrymen. It has been supposed, too, that certain 
sorts which are deleterious with us, the Jg. piperatus ior example, 
are eaten without inconvenience or danger by natives of the con- 
tinent; but that is a total mistake. What kills a Scotchman 
would prove equally fatal to a Russian or a Frenchman ; — the 
shades of discrimination, however, between the poisonous and the 
wholesome, are so nice that, although detected at once by the dis- 
ciplined mushroom-hunter, an unpractised or a careless eye is un- 
able to discern them. Accustomed from infancy to follow their pa- 
rents through the fields and forests, children soon learn to distin- 
guish the different kinds. Hence the astonishment often felt by 
strangers on seeingexposed for sale in many of the continental mar- 
kets. Fungi, which in their own country, they had been taught to re- 
gard as loathsome, injurious, and even fatal. Fairy rings are found 
in some places. That this singular and often beautiful appearance 
is caused neither by lightning nor by insects, nor slill less bv fairies,

althougli one regrets to consider these " delicate creations," as 
ii mere coinage of the brain, but sintiply by the manner in which 
certain species of agarics cast their seed, is now, I beheve, univer- 
sally agreed on by naturalists ; but I am not aware of a satisfac- 
tory reason having been assigned for the circular figure which the 
clusters uniformly assume. To what species or variety the aga- 
rics composing the rings are to be referred, is also a matter of dis- 
pute. Lightfoot, without hesitation, pronounces it to be the Ag. 
coriaceiis, or fairy agaric, called by the French Mousseron, and 
describes the pileus as being of the size of a half-crown, a little 
convex or elevated in the centre ; while Withering, after quoting 
a number of authors, and giving his reasons for differing from 
Lightfoot, decides that it is the Ag. pracaltus, which is a large 
species, and strengthens his conclusion by the respectable autho- 
rity of Ray, who subjoins to an imperfect character of the plant 
the English name of Scotch bonnets. This confusion and contra- 
riety of opinion has arisen, as it appears to me, from its being sup- 
posed that the phenomenon of the fairy ring is exhibited by one 
species of agaric only. The season in which 1 write prevents me 
from verifying my observation by a reference to specimens, or 
distinctly stating what the different kinds are ; but I can confi- 
dently affirm that two kinds, at least, propagate in a ring — the 
one corresponding exactly with Lightfoot's description of the Ag. 
eoriaceusy the other, so far as I remember, with Ray's account, as 
quoted by Withering, of the Ag, praealtiis. Great variation ex- 
ists in the diameters of these rings, some of them being only a few 
inches, while others extend to nearly twenty feet. The circles, 
especially the smaller ones, are often completely formed. 

Woods, and Plantations. — The following trees, indigenous and 
cultivated, occur within the bounds of the parish : alder, ash, 
birch, bird's cherry, beech, crab tree, elder, elm, hawthorn, hazel 
horse chestnut, laburnum, larch, lime, mountain-ash, oak, plane, 
poplar, Scotch fir, silver fir, service tree, spruce, wild cherry, and 
willow. The plantations consist principally of ash, larch, lime, and 
oak. The oldest and finest trees are those which surround the church 
and manse. They are planes and beeches, the former upwards 
of one hundred years old, the latter about eighty-five, as nearly as 
I could ascertain from the testimony of some aged people, now 
dead, who recollected them when newly planted.

ger is occasionally met with. Otters .sometimes appear in the 
Tarff, and are numerous in the Dee. They are very destructive 
to salmon ; but, as they iiunt in the night, they are seldom visible 
by day, and, being extremely wary, they are enabled, by their ex- 
quisite sense of smell, to avoid the traps set for them, and are 
therefore not easily destroyed. Young otters are taken now and 
then ; but I believe there is no instances of a full-grown one ever 
having been secured. They are so fierce, that, rather than be ta- 
ken, they will bite off a foot and leave it in the trap, — an incident 
which has happened more than once in the experience of some of 
our fishermen. A very slight blow on the head kills them. They 
generally burrow at a distance from the scene of their depredations. 
A dark, lonely loch, with deep, abrupt, hollow, and overhanging 
edges, is a favourite haunt, especially if it communicates with a 
salmon river by a direct and unobstructed streamlet. To this re- 
treat they ascend towards morning, and, entering their warm and 
commodious den by a passage, the mouth of which is beneath the 
surface of the water, they doze during the day, and do not come 
abroad again till the evening is far advanced. When in pursuit 
of their prey, they have a sharp shrill whistle, which can easily be 
distinguished above the roar of the Dee, even where its waters are 
at the largest. I have often found salmon of ten or twelve lbs. ly- 
ing upon the rocks half-devoured by them. It is said that they 
always select the finest fish. The head and shoulders are invari- 
ably the parts eaten, and near the tail on both sides of the under 
part of the body the marks of teeth are generally visible. This 
shows that the otter runs his prey down, and does not, as some 
have supposed, seize it by surprise. Some idea may hence be 
formed of the great agility and muscular power of this animal. A 
few years ago, a neighbour of mine caught a pup, which, in a very 
short while, became quite domesticated. His familiarity and gam- 
bols were highly entertaining ; but, from the time that he was 
taken to his favourite element, after being full grown, he became 
so fierce and ungovernable as to be a dangerous inmate, and had 
to be sent off, much against his master's inclination, to the Zoolo- 
gical Gardens of Liverpool, where, I understand, he still remains, 

I have heard lately that a " cunning man" in this neighbourhood, has fallen on' 
a plan to take old otters, which has proved successful. Olserving by the tracks of the 
animal in the snow, the iwecise spots at which it enters and leaves the water, he pla- 
ces a trap hclow the surface, so as to destroy the human effluvium, which is supposed 
to be the main circumstance that hinders the otter from seizing the bait when placed 
on the dry land.

— an object of considerable curiosity to the visitors. The polecat 
is sometimes seen, but very rarely. I have seen only one in eight 
years. The weasel is common. The stoat, a beautiful little crea- 
ture, with dark prominent eyes, a white body, and a black tail, is 
met with occasionally. I have observed three, one in winter, and 
two in summer. I mention this for two reasons,Vs, because it 
is a common idea, that the stoat is the weasel grown white from 
the effects of winter ; and, secondly, because it has been affirmed 
by some naturalists, that the stoat changes its colour from white 
to brown, according to the seasons. I can vouch, from personal 
observation, that both these opinions are erroneous. Hares and 
rabbits are plentiful, although not to the same extent as some 
years ago. Montgomery, whose descriptions, to their other me- 
rits, add that of correctness, mentions, among his enumeration of 
the different animals, the " con" or squirrel as common in this 
district. But whatever mav have been the case in his day, it has 
long since disappeared not only from this neighbourhood, but from 
the southern part of Scotland. This change is remarkable, and 
cannot be the effect of climate, as the squirrel is abundant in the 
northern counties of England, and not uncommon in the Lothians. 

Birds. — Several years ago a bittern was shot by a sportsman, 
who had it stuff'ed in commemoration of his adventure. So far as 
I am aware no other specimen of that bird has ever been observed. 
In the course of the last two years, king-fishers have been repeat- 
edly seen along the Dee. The missel-thrush, the largest and one 
of the most beautiful of our singing birds, was quite unknown to 
us about twenty years ago. They long continued to be rare; but 
now, although not numerous, they are not uncommon. Except 
when breeding, they are the shyest of birds ; but then they become 
very bold, building their nest in the cleft of a tree, close to a 
house, and attacking, with loud and angry screams, such animals 
as threaten to approach them. For several years, a pair have 
built on some old trees that surround the manse. At first they 
selected the more distant trees and the highest branches, but, 
from not being disturbed, they acquired additional confidence each 
successive season. At length they ventured within a few yards 
of one of the doors, and, while I now write, the female is hatching 
' in my orchard on a branch not six feet from the ground, and al- 
most within arm's length of a walk, along which people are per- 
petually passing. Tlie yellow wagtail is a pretty little bird, re- 
sembling, ill elegance of shape and beauly of plumage, some spe-

cies of canaries. They do not increase in numbers, one reason 
for which may be, that, building when the streams and rivers are 
low, they select crevices of rocks, which the first flood covers, 
sweeping away their eggs or their tiny offspring. 1 saw this hap- 
pen twosuccessive seasons to the nest of a yellow wagtail, which, 
undeterred by the catastrophy of the preceding year, the poor 
bird had built in the. following one in the same cleft. In winter 
and spring, we are sometimes visited by swans and wild-geese, but 
they never continue long, and merely make resting-places of our 
rivers and lochs as they pass from one haunt to another. The 
shieldrake, which is the most beautiful of the duck tribe, fre- 
quently builds in the higher grounds, near the centre of the parish. 
Although the principal element of these birds is the sea, to which 
they immediately conduct their young, they often hatch at a 
great distance from it. They commonly descend by a tributary 
rivulet to the main stream, and soon reach the tide ; but, if in 
terrupted, or accidentally prevented from taking that course, they 
will boldly go by the shortest and smoothest path they can find. 
Last year, a flock of no fewer than twenty-two came down from 
the moors to the sea by the high road. They had to pass some 
houses, and were met by several individuals in rapid march, the 
parent birds fluttering in front, close above the young ones, di- 
recting them in their course, and animating them by their cries. 
They are delicious food, but although easily tamed, they are stuplfied 
by domestication, having so little idea of self-preservation, as not 
to fly even when attacked, so that, being common objects of assault 
to the domestic fowls, they are soon exterminated. Several at- 
tempts have beeji made in this parish to rear them with poultry, 
but, owing to this circumstance, these attempts have uniformly 
failed. The cuckoo is very common among the hills. I have 
seen eight in a flock. On arriving, it is almost always solitary, 
but before its departure, is frequently attended or followed by a 
little bird. Hence the phrase of the " gowk" and the " titling." 
Many to whom the fact and the phrase are familiar know nothing 
of their origin, which it may be worth while therefore to explain. 
The cuckoo, building no nest, deposits a single egg in that of 
some little bird, generally the bessy black- cap, or the moss- 
cheeper, by whom it is hatched along with her own. After ar- 
riving at a certain age, the young cuckoo, a giant compared with 
his foster-brothers, takes them on his back, flings them out of the 
nest, and thus gets the whole attention of the old bird devoted to

himself. She continues to feed him, and to treat him as her 
banthng after he is ten times her own size, and, although so much 
his inferior in strength and speed, does what she can to keep up 
with him in his rapid and extensive flights, nor quits him till he 
is just about to set off on his foreign travels. The " gowk," there- 
fore, is the young cuckoo, and the " titling" is the bird that 
hatched him. Many people imagine they, have never seen the 
cuckoo, from their confounding it with a species of hawk which 
it much resembles, — an imagination countenanced by the cele- 
brated line of the poet, 

" O cuckoo, shall I call thee bird, or but a wandering voice ;" 

and by the note appended to it, in which he affirms that, although 
" the cuckoo is almost perpetually heard throughout the season 
of spring, it seldom becomes an object of sight." The raven, the 
hooded-croWj the carrion crow, and the rook, are all found in the 
parish. 

To such gentlemen as wish to form rookeries around their man- 
sion-houses, I may suggest a plan which I have recently tried 
myself, and found to be attended with complete success. A rook- 
ery having been long established in the neighbourhood, I had ex- 
pected, as there are some fine tall old trees about the manse, that 
the rooks would extend their settlement to my premises; but year 
after year passed, and still they declined doing so. I therefore 
caused two nests, having each four strong young crows, to be 
brought from the rookery and fixed on one of the highest of my 
own trees. The old birds immediately found them out, and con- 
tinued to feed them till they were full-fledged. I observed the 
rooks return to the transported nests at certain periods during the 
winter, and linger about them for a few days, to ascertain, appa- 
rently, whether they continued fit for future use, and to repair the 
injuries done by the weather. In March, I had the satisfaction 
to see eighteen nests clustered round the tree on which the decoys 
had been fastened. A rookery may be formed at any distance in 
this way, provided the nests are nottoo far removed at a time. 
They should be shifted by successive stages, and permitted to re- 
main a day or two at each place. The old ones will feed the 
young, even although the nest be put upon the ground; but 
by fixing it at each resting-place upon a tree, the success of the 
experiment will be more certain. In the first stanza of " The 
Cherry and the Slae," the nightingale is mentioned, along with 
the "goklspink" goldfinch, as saluting May from the "balmy

boughs/' on the banks of the river which the poet describes ; but 
Goldsmith says the nightingale is only found in some of the south- 
ern counties of England, and is totally unknown in Scotland, Ire- 
land and Wales ; while Burns, in some strictures addressed to Mr 
Thomson on old Scottish songs, censures the writer of " Jamie 
the flower of the Dee," as guilty both of false description and of a 
blunder in natural history in the line " sweetly the nightingale 
sang frae the tree,"— alleging, first, that the nightingale is never 
hea'rd so far north ; and, secondly, that he sings, not from a tree 
but from a bush. In both particulars, the popular opinion coin- 
cides with that of those distinguished authors. The authority of 
such a writer as Montgomery, however, whose works, indepen- 
dently of the great poetical powers which they display, are remark- 
able for a close observation of nature, are enriched with numerous 
classical allusions, and indicate a mind informed with genera 
knowledge, stands high upon the other side. The manliness of 
his understanding places him beyond the affectation of introducing 
the name of a celebrated bird, without any attention to the local 
propriety of the allusion, and merely for the sake of tickling the 
ear of the ignorant or indolent reader by a sound which calls up 
so many associations of romance and melody. It is nearly certain 
either that he must have heard the bird sing where he has placed it, 
or that he believed it to be a periodical, although, perhaps, a rare visi- 
tant. I am assured, too, by my friend, Mr M' Culloch of Ardwall, that, 
in the year 1826, he is convinced he heard the song of the nightin- 
gale, with which he had been familiar in other countries, at his 
beautiful residence near Gatehouse of Fleet, about ten miles to the 
westward of the Dee. The inference, therefore, is, either that the 
melodious stranger has ceased to visit this country, or that his visits 
are extremely rare. Of birds either frequently or occasionally 
seen, we may note the heron, the cormorant, the curlew, the lap- 
wing, the dorhawk, the corncrake, the tern, the white owl, the 
golden plover, the water hen, the stock dove, the fieldfare, the star- 
ling, the golden-crested wren, the corn-bunting, the snow-bunting', 
the speckled diver, the long-tailed titmouse, the little grebej 
and the bullfinch. We have all the varieties of game birds except 
the ptarmigan, — red and black grouse, pheasant, snipe, partridge, 
and woodcock. 

• Now called the " rose-mufBin" by naturalists, who have discovered that its habits 
are totally different from those of the titmouse. It is an exquisitely beautiful little 
creature, so quick and restless, that it is very diflicult to get a sight of it, and, next to 
the gold-crested wren, the smallest of our native birds, I have generally seen it among 
birches, by the sides of streams.

Fish and Fisheries. — Perch, pike, trout, and eels are round in 
the lochs. In one loch it is said there are char, hut that is un- 
certain. Smelts or sparlings are taken sometimes in the Dee, 
but very seldom. The pearl mussel is so frequent as to be used 
for ornamental purposes. The salmon of the Dee arc highly es- 
teemed for their richness and flavour, being considered superior 
in these respects to those of the neighbouring rivers. Of late they 
have increased prodigiously in numbers, for which various reasons 
may be assigned, — the removal of stake-nets, which intercepted 
multitudes in the estuary of the Dee, and, in certain- states of the 
weather, prevented a single fish from passing upwards, and the 
much greater attention now paid in winter to the protection of the 
breeders, of which great numbers used to be destroyed with spears 
by torch-light when in the act of depositing their spawn in the 
shallow fords. Although in a state at that time totally unfit to 
be eaten, the disgusting practice of destroying them for food pre- 
vailed to an incredible extent. In the remoter tributaries of the 
Dee, it prevails still ; and the instincts of the fish leading it to the 
highest and the shallowest streamlets it can reach, render the de- 
"tection and punishment of the poachers a work of much trouble 
and expense. The protection of the salmon fry, too, in the spring, 
deserves to be mentioned as another probable cause of the increase. 
Every school boy knows they are the boldest of fish in seizing the 
fly ; and it is generally by the capture of a few dozens of them 
that he is initiated into the mysteries of angling, and fired with the 
passion for it. The eff"ect of taking fry with the rod, however, has 
been much exaggerated. No doubt for every fry that is killed, a 
salmon is lost; but the influence on the annual produce of a river 
from the loss of all the fry which it is possible to take in a season, 
is too insignificant to be reckoned, compared with the loss occa- 
sioned by the destruction of a single breeding salmon. The dis- 
covery lately made by Mr Shaw of the identity between the sal- 
mon fry and the par, and the curious investigations respecting the 
habits of the salmon in which the prosecution of his experiments 
encaged him, are the most interesting and remarkable circumstances 
that ever have occurred in connection with the natural history of 
this valuable fish. 1 have termed it a discovery, having not the 
slio-htest doubt, from what has fallen under my personal observa- 
tion, that although the identity had been long suspected, Mr Shaw

is entitled to claim the merit of having established it. On hear- 
ing of his investigations, the present tacksman of the Tongland fish- 
ery, Mr Gillone, a person of some intelligence and much curiosity, 
commenced a series of experiments with salmon roe upon the same 
principles. These experiments are not yet completed, but 1 wit- 
nessed them from the time that the embryo was taken from the 
salmon bed, fourteen months ago, up to the present moment, and, 
so far as they have gone, they exactly coincide with the process 
detailed by Mr Shaw. Another year is required to finish the ex- 
periment, but the result seems certain. What Mr Shaw has suc- 
ceeded so well in showing is, that the par remains for upwards of 
two years in the fresh water before seeking the sea or acquiring 
the scaly appearance of the fry, and that, in the course of the se- 
cond year, it makes very little additional growth. A clear expla- 
nation is thus supplied of a circumstance which naturally caused 
a good deal of scepticism about the new theory— par and fry, which 
differ very little in size but much in appearance, being found to- 
gether in rivers at the same time. The effect which this discovery, 
if turned to practical purposes, is likely to have on the multiplica- 
tion of salmon, is too obvious to be pointed out. In confirmation 
of its soundness, I may mention a remark often made by old fish- 
ermen, that the effects of an unfavourable breeding time, either 
from severity of frost or a scanty supply of rain, appeared in dimi- 
nishing the number of salmon, not in the two seasons immediately 
following, but in the third. On the supposition that Mr Shaw's ex'- 
periments are conclusive, that is exactly what was to be expected ; 
and the unintentional correspondence between his theory and the 
opinion of men who had no guide but long experience, may be re- 
garded as a somewhat interesting evidence of its truth. Immediately 
on entering the river, the salmon begin to lose their beautiful and 
clear appearance, becoming gradually darker till they deposit their 
spawn, when they are often quite black ; but after that event, the 
bright colour reappears, and on finally quitting the fresh water, 
they differ little in outward aspect from those ascending from the 
sea, except in the lankness of their shape and the discoloration 
of their gills. After getting to the sea, the salmon increases very 
rapidly. The fry which descends in May a few ounces in weight 
returns in July or August a grilse of six or eight pounds, a rapid 
growth certainly,. but not much more so than that of some land 
animals. 

The right of fishing belongs exclusively to Mr Murray of 
J3rnughton, and must have been acquired by prescription, as a very

small portion of his estate touches that portion of the river, along 
which the fishery extends. The Earl of Selkirk's land is on the 
one bank, and the glebe of Tongland on the most valuable part of 
the other. Formerly, it was let by public roup in short leases of 
two, three, and four years, and rose in value at each successive 
auction. When last let in this manner, the lease was for four years 
at a rental of L,705 per annum, — a large sum, considering that 
the fishery is not more than half a mile in extent. At present it 
is let for fifteen years by private bargain ; but at what rent, I can- 
not pretend to state accurately. 

The salmon are taken in seven different modes, — by doachs or 
cruives, by hang-nets, by draught-nets, by shoulder-nets, by drag- 
nets, by gaffs, and by the rod. 

Two doachs have been erected, one on each side of the Dee, 
with a stone battery or gangway communicating between them, 
'tvhich stretches completely across the channel. The consequence 
is, that, except when the river is much swollen, not a single sal- 
mon can pass. These erections, especially the stone battery, are 
believed to be quite illegal, — a judgment having been pronounced 
by the present Lord Chancellor Cottenham, a few years ago, in 
the case of the Earl of Airly against the proprietors on the Spey, 
from which it appears that every obstruction in the bed of a river, 
to prevent the ascent of salmon, is contrary to law. By way of 
permitting some fish to get up, there is what is called a Saturday's 
slap, that is, a part of the doachs is removed once a week for 
thirty-six hours, reckoning from six o'clock on Saturday evening ; 
but, except in particular states of the river, this slap is of little 
avail towards its ostensible purpose. When it is low, the salmon 
do not run, but remain inactive for weeks, I have observed them, 
for many days, lying in the same identical spot, apparently with- 
out having stirred from it, and, when high, the pressure of the 
current against the doachs is so great, that even should the fish- 
ermen attempt to remove them, which they cannot always venture 
to do, the effort would be beyond their strength. The proportion 
of salmon, therefore, that falls to the upland proprietors, compared 
with the- numbers taken below the doachs, is a mere trifle, and it 
is astonishing, that, in a matter which so nearly affects them, they 
do not act with vigour in vindication of their rights. 

By the removal of these obstructions, the value of the fisheries 
near the mouth of the Dee, far from being diminished, would pro- 
bably be very much increased, and that in the course of a few 
years. The proprietors along the whole course of the river and

its tributaries would have a direct and obvious interest in the pro- 
tection of the fry and preservation of the breeding fish ; and be- 
ing constantly on the spot, could effect these most desirable ob- 
jects with much more certainty than can ever be done either by 
proprietors or by tacksmen under the existing monopoly. One or 
two more hands would be required to work the nets in the lower 
part of the river ; but the expense thus incurred would be greatly 
overbalanced by the profits arising from the increase in the num- 
bers of the fish which would almost certainly ensue. At present 
the higher proprietors have no interest whatever in the multi- 
plication of salmon ; they, therefore, see the fry and the breeders 
destroyed with indifference, and many of them connive at their de- 
struction. 

 The following observations on this subject lately appeared in a Worcester news- 
paper. They deserve to be quoted, both for the confirmation they afford of the fore- 
' going statements, and the suggestion respecting the best mode of stopping the illegal 
practice which they so justly reprobate : " A Gloucester correspondent again calls 
our attention to the subject of the preservation of this delicious fish the salmon. 
We cannot withhold the expression of our regret, after the many reasonable appeals 
which have been made by the press respecting this question, that contrabandists .and 
purchasers of unseasonable fish are yet to be found, in open violation of the Act of 
58th Geo. III. Our regret is further increased by the fact, with which our corre- 
spondent has furnished us,- that a gentleman, who is a magistrate  of this county 
and of Gloucestershire, and whose duty in that capacity should have been to enforce 
the law, rather than to encourage its violation, openly purchased an'unseasonable fish 
at about lOd. per lb., in order to effect a paltry saving of some 2d. per lb. ; this bar- 
gain was made on the I8th of October last. We are asked, ' ■who is to be the prose- 
cutor in such instances T Our answer, is, the conservator, who is, or should he the 
recognized informer, to be authorized and supported by the county at large ; and 
where such public oflScer is not appointed, no time should he lost in selecting one} In 
Scotland, no such fnnctionary as the one mentioned by this writer is known • and I 
am doubtful whether, in the case of a large river like the Dee, having many tribu- 
taries, and taking a winding course through a rugged mountainous country, the ap- 
pointment of one such functionary, or even of many, would produce a sensible effect 
in preventing the destruction of unseasonable salmon. How little the independent 
exertions of detached counties avail, is obvious from the result of the attempts 
lately made in this disttict to put down vagrants. Considerable success attended them 
at first ; but of late the nuisance has become as rank as ever. And if a number of 
constables, with broad day-light and public roads to guide them, are unable to exter- 

we may judge what a " conservator" would ef- 
fect against gangs of nimble and powerful young poachers, conducting their opera- 
tions under the cloud of night, amidst remote and unfrequented glens, on streams often 
flowing underneath high rocks and through extensive copsewood. The practice must 
be stopped, if it is to be stopt at all, not by the exertions of local liodies, but by the 
mterposition of the Government; and I would suggest, though with much diffidence 
the following plan for the purpose : ' 

1. The first thing to be done is to have a minute and accurate survey taken of 
the salmon rivers, in which survey the following points are to be attended to • first 
the various properties through which the river and its tributaries flow are to be noted' 
and the length of their courses through each of them ; second, the principal haunts 
of the salmon, during the period, when they ascend the river ; and third and princi 
pally, the places where they deposit their spawn. To ascertain these points but es' 
pecially the last, let individuals be selected, having not only practical experience and 
local knowledge, but a general acquaintance with the natural history of the salmon nnH 
considerable powers of reflection on the facts that may fall under their observation' In 
the reports accomiianying the charts construe ed from these survevs, the writJc 
should not be liinitc.l to mere statistical details, but should be invited o sfite tl eir

The liano- or baw-net consists of two nets, of which one has 
meshes of the common size ; the other, meshes five or six times 
larger. This being drawn across the lower end of a pool, and a 
.stop-net across the top, several men beat the surface of the water 
with long poles, and pounce the rocks and stones so as to scare 
the salmon from their haunts. Thus attacked, many of them make 
a desperate effort to escape down the stream, and, striking with 
violence against the small-meshed net, carry it through a large 
mesh of the other, and thus get so completely entangled by their 
fins and gills, that their farther attempts to escape are fruitless. 
It might be supposed, indeed, that very few fish could get away ; 
but this is by no means the case, for it- is a singular circumstance, 
that, after a good many have been entangled, multitudes continue 
in the pool, that no exertions of the fisherman's can drive into the 
net. They will come close up to it, and may be seen swimming 
within the bag made by the current ; but, on being approached,  
instead of dashing downwards, they move to the centre of the pool 

opinions unreservedly, and to suggest such plans as may have occurred to them in 
furtherance of the general object for which they have been appointed. 

2. The next thing to be clone is to cause every obstruction in the channel of the 
river to be swept away, and no mode of taking salmon allowed, except what requires 
the application of the hand. 

3. The third thing to be done is, to require from every individual having property 
on the river, a return of the number of salmon taken by him or by his leave in the 
course of the season. 

4. And the fourth thing to be done is, to provide for the protection of the breed- 
ing'fish. This can only be effected by a numerous, active, fiiithful, and well paid po- 
lice. This police should be brought from a distance, and periodically shifted from one 
station to another, like excise officers. Nor should any person in the district have a 
word to say, either in their nomination or removal. Reckoning the average weight of 
each salmon at 6 lbs. which is under the fact, I should say that a tax of one half-penny 
per lb. would be quite enough to defray the expense of this establishment. Unless these 
or similar measures of practical energy be adopted to put an end to river poachmg, we 
shall never have a permanently abundant supply of salmon ; and still less a progres- 
sive increase. It is grievous to see, as I have done often, large and beautiful fish 
offered for sale, in a state totally unfit for use, and if habitually used, certam to pro- 
duce bad effects on the health. Unlimited reliance must not be placed on the fecun- 
dity of the salmon, which is far from being so great as many people think. Looking 
at the quantity of roe in a single fish, it would no doubt be incalculable, did each roe 
produce a salmon ; but not to speak of the casualties it is exposed to, both while be- 
in« deposited, and even after being covered up, a very large proportion of it is bar- 
ren having either accidentally lost, or been incapable of receiving, impregnation. I 
cannot pretend to state the proportion, although, I think, it might be ascertained, 
and it is worth ascertaining, between the number of roe in any one salmon, and the 
number offish produced by that salmon, which arrive at maturity ; but I have heard 
it roughly guessed at one in one hundred  The cause of the continued decrease m the 
numbers of these valuable fish are to be found at our doors; and we need seek for 
no other, such as the multiplication of steam-boats, saw-miUs, &amp;c. 

Their disappearance from some rivers in Norway may be accounted for by the 
nuantity of saw-dust thrown into them from the mills ; and from the Mersey, by the 
number of the ships, or still more, by the evacuation through the Irwell ot the pud- 
die of iManchester ; but causes similar to these will not apply here, nor are they re- 
quired,— those which I have specified, being quite sufficient to account for the past, 
ivnd to insure a future diminution.

or the upper part of the stream. It is said the number that thus 
escape is, in general, equal to those which are captured. This 
also is an illegal mode of fishing ; but, until last year, it was prac- 
tised in the Dee with great success, — three hundred salmon hav- 
ing been often taken from a single pool in a few hours. 

The shoulder-net and the manner of using it cannot be describ- 
ed more correctly than in the words of Mr Robb : " A net is fixed 
to a semicircular bow of wood, and this is attached to a pole 
twenty feet in length. The fisherman ties a piece of bended wood 
with a groove in it on his right shoulder, for the pole of the net to 
slide in. Taking his station, in the night, upon a rock by the side of 
a pool frequented by the salmon, he throws his net before him into 
the water, and draws it towards him along the bottom, the pole 
sliding in the wooden groove. When near him, he gives the net a 
sudden turn, and brings out the salmon. Another man is by to 
kill the fish, and bring them to a place of safety." By far the 
greatest number of salmon are taken by this method. It requires 
a man of great bodily strength, and of long experience as to the 
haunts of the fish. Two years ago, 35 salmon were brought out 
at a single throw. Several people were fortunately'present to as- 
sist the fisherman, otherwise he could not have secured his prey. 
In July 1836, the same man took 315 grilses with the shoulder- 
net in the course of an afternoon. 

The drag-net is constructed in the same manner as the preced- 
ing, but upon a much larger scale, and is worked at night by two 
men in a boat. It is used only in the Linn-pool, — the largest and 
deepest in the Dee. The greatest weight of fish I have known 
taken in this manner, in one night, was 800 lbs. 

The draught-net is too well known to need description. The 
only pool in which it admits of being used is happily situated and 
formed for that purpose,— being the highest into which the tide 
flows, and the only one, as its name, the sand bed, imports, which 
has a sandy bottom. It can always be drawn four times a day,— 
twice at flood and twice at ebb-tide, and seldom fails to yield a 
return of fish, which, although less abundant perhaps, is much 
more regular than that arising from some of the other modes. 

The gaff is seldom employed, except in spring, and even then 
only when the river is low and salmon are scarce. A large hook is 
fastened to a slender piece of wood or wire, four or five feet in 
length, which is attached to a salmon line. One man takes a fish- 
mg-rod, and another approaching cautiously the place where a sal- 
mon has been observed, slips the gaff" slowly underneath, and, bv

a sudden jerk, strikes the hook into him. Ho immediately flies 
off, and, after being played awhile, is brought gradually ashore. 

A method, somewhat similar to this, called grappling, is often 
successfully practised by poachers. Three or four large hooks are 
fastened together, pointing in different directions. The line to 
which they are attached being loaded with lead, they are dropt into 
the narrowest part of a pool where salmon are supposed to be most 
abundant, and, after being allowed to sink nearly to the bottom, 
are moved up and down in a see-saw manner. Although this ap- 
pears to be random work, I am assured that poachers who know 
the river, will take salmon by it in considerable numbers. 

In spring a good many 6sh are captured with the rod, to which 
all the men employed in the fishery devote most of their spare 
time. No river can possibly afford better amusement to the an- 
gler, and great liberality Jias always been shown in giving permis- 
sion to fish, both by the proprietor and by the different tacksmen. 

Of the artificial flies used there is considerable variety in point 
of size and colour, both being determined by the state of the riven 
When it is swollen, the fly most commonly adopted is a large one, 
with red or spreckled wings, taken from the feathers either of the 
common turkey, or of the fish-tailed or Huntington kite. The 
latter bird is not a native of Scotland. It is found in the central 
and southern counties of England, and used to be so highly es- 
teemed by our anglers, that I have known half-a-crown given for 
a single feather. Of late it has fallen rather out of repute, and 
o-iven place to the more flexible but less brilliant feathers of the 
red turkey. When the river is low, small trout flies are used with 
the finest tackle. To my taste this is by far the best amusement. 
Large yellow trout rise freely, and the sportsman is certain of an 
occasional struggle with a salmon. As an illustration of the ex- 
cellent diversion sometimes had on the Dee, I may mention, that, 
some years ago, I took, with a small trout fly, a finely-grown newly- 
run salmon, which weighed 14f pounds. My line consisted of 
three horse hairs, and a single gut. The fly was composed of the 
red part of the partridge-tail feather, a red hackle, and a black 
worsted body, without tinsel of any kind. On the same day, the 
same fly was taken by another salmon, which escaped. This, 
I am inclined to think, is the greatest piscatory exploit ever per- 
formed on the Dee. The enthusiastic angler will applaud the 
feat, and the good-natured reader will excuse my vanity. 

On first appearing on the river, salmon are invariably more or 
less infested— sometimes their backs are nearly covered— with m-

sects, to which fishermei give the name of sea-lice. They occasion 
the fish agreat deal of uneasiness, and perhaps pain, beingsometimes 
so firmly attached, as on removal to bring away the scales. Fresh 
water is fatal to them ; but how long they survive in it, is uncer- 
tain, — some say only for a few days : but this is a mistake, as I 
have observed new fish among a number of old ones, for upwards 
of a week, in the same pool, where they were easily distinguish- 
able, both by the superior vivacity of their motions, and by the 
long tails of the insects attached to them, and appearing like frag- 
ments of numerous white threads between the tail and the dorsal 
fin. In descending the river after spawning, the gills of the sal- 
mon are filled with small maggots, called fresh-water lice, which 
disappear after the fish reach the sea, and, except in one case, to 
be noticed immediately, are never found on the same animal at the 
same time as the sea-Hce. The existence of these insects, under the 
particular circumstances, will not account for the migratory instincts 
of the salmon ; but supposing them to annoy or irritate the fish, it 
affords a curious illustration of the physical means employed by 
nature to quicken the operation of instincts which she has implant- 
ed. The salmon seeks the river to deposit its spawn, and the sea to 
recover its strength and bulk ; — its migrations in either direction 
being hastened by the presence of insects, fostered by the element 
which it leaves, and destroyed by the one into which it passes. If 
this fact be admitted as one of the inciting causes of the migra- 
tion of salmon, it may be considered as somewhat analogous to one 
in the history of migratory birds, with respect to which, John 
Hunter suggested, and Dr Jenner has established, that the incit- 
ing causes of their migrations are certain periodical changes in 
the testes of the male, and the ovaria of the female. It also af- 
fords an interesting, though partial confirmation of a conjecture 
thrown out by Mr Stewart, who, in treating of the distinction be- 
tween Reason and Instinct, in the third volume of the Philosophy 
of the Human Mind, observes, that, " of the attempts to account 
for the instincts of migratory birds and fishes, I have met with 
none which seem to me at all satisfactory ; at the same time, 
I have no doubt that it is by some physical means that the effect 
is accomplished, and I think it highly probable, that new lights 
will be thrown on the subject by the researches of future natura-

In consequence of the facility of communication opened with 
Liverpool, Manchester, London, and other large towns by steam- 
boats and railways, the price of salmon, like that of almost everj

other article of food, has risen of late years. In the earlier part 
of the season, that is, from February till June, the prices are 2s. 
6d., 2s., and Is. lOd. per lb. In June, July, and August, the 
prices generally are, for salmon, 6d. ; grilse, 4d. ; trout and her- 
ling, 3d. per lb. In September, there is a slight advance on 
each. Fifty years ago, salmon was so abundant and so cheap, 
that servants in this neighbourhood, on being hired, made it a 
part of their bargain, that they were not to be fed upon it more 
than twice a-week. Although salmon have lately so much in- 
creased in numbers, large ones are not so common as formerly. 
Within the last eight years, one only has weighed thirty pounds, 
and no other has come near it. Fish of that weight used not to 
be scarce, and sometimes they far exceeded it. The fishing sea- 
son commences upon the 1st of February, and closes on the 25th 
of September. The bull-trout is often caught. He varies 
from five to twenty lbs. An unskilful person is very apt to select 
him, as lhave often witnessed, from a group of salmon, as the finest 
and richest of the lot ; but, although a handsome fish, his quality as 
food is utterly detestable. On being cut up, he appears white 
instead of red, and has nothing of the flavour, firmness, or delicacy 
of the salmon. He is distinguished by greater roundness of body 
and bluntness of nose, and also by two or three large spots upon 
his cheeks, which are wanting in the other ; but the surest exter- 
nal mark is the state of the gills, which in the salmon are clear, 
and of a beautiful deep red, while those of the bull-trout are of a 
pale dirty colour, and foul with fresh water maggots of the bigness 
of a small pea. At the same time that these maggots are found on 
the gills of the bull-trout, sea lice appear on its body,— a fact which 
might, at first sight, seem to be fatal to the theory I have ventured 
to hint at, respecting one of the inciting causes of the periodical mi- 
grations of salmon. But there are two circumstances which may 
perhaps account for the singularity in this case. One is the soft- 
ness and the white colour of the fish, as compared with the rest 
of the salmon tribe, all of which are firm and red when in season. 
By long continuance in the fresh water, migratory fish become 
pale and flaccid. The probability, therefore, is, that the periodical 
migrations of the bull-trout are short and frequent, or, in other 
words, that it is the habit of this fish to hover betwixt the salt and

eight during which the river is open. The greatest number I ever knew taken m 
that month was in the year 1840, namely, 1426.

the fresh water, and tlius to acquire certain properties, and to 
present certain appearances, in common with those fish which re- 
main longer in either element. This supposition is strengthened 
by another consideration, that the bull -trout, in so far as I have 
heard or observed, is taken most frequently near the mouths of 
rivers; in the Dee, almost invariably within high water mark. 
To anglers, it will be no slight confirmation of the truth of these 
remarks, that, notwithstanding its size and beauty, it is a sluggish 
fish, seldom taking the fly, and when hooked, affording very little 
amusement. 

On the sea-trout and the herling, both of which are very nu- 
merous, especially the latter, in the summer and autumn months, 
it is needless to make any observations. 

I will take this opportunity of correcting a prevalent mistake 
respecting the manner in which salmon overcome waterfalls, — a 
mistake to which Goldsmith has given currency, and Captain 
Brown countenance in a late edition of that author's Animated 
Nature. Goldsmith observes and his annotator has almost ver- 
bally copied the observation in a different part of the work, that 

salmon spring up cataracts as high as a house. As soon as they 
come to the bottom of the torrent, they seem disappointed to meet 
the obstruction, and swim some paces back ; they then take a 
view of the danger that lies before them, survey it motionless for 
some minutes, advance, and again retreat; till at last, summoning 
up all their force, they take a leap from the bottom, their body 
straight and strongly in motion, and thus most frequently clear 
every obstruction." Captain Brown adds, " On the river Liffy, 
in Ireland, there is a cataract above nineteen feet high. Here, in 
the salmon season, many of the inhabitants amuse themselves by 
observing the fish leap up the torrent. They frequently fall back 
many times before they surmount it." It is evident that some of 
these statements are entirely fabulous. In both passages an er- 
roneous account is given of a very interesting fact in the habits 
of the salmon, whose power in ascending cataracts, although very 
great, has nothing of that miraculous character which such ex- 
tracts as the foregoing would lead us to ascribe to it. The truth 
is, that they overcome waterfalls, not by leaping but by swimming. 
The great musculai- power of their fins and tail enables them to 
repeat the blows on the water more rapidly than it descends, the 
effect of which is, of course, to raise the body of the fish. But 
this power can be exerted only for a short time, and through an.

inconsiderable space. Understanding by a cataract a per|endi- 
cular fall of water, without any obstruction whatever, I would say 
that no salmon can by swimming overcome one exceeding ten 
feet, or by leaping, one exceeding six. Perhaps even these num- 
bers are too high. I have sat for hours, by a fall on the Dee, 
observing their motions ; and for one that masters the current 
by a leap, hundreds effect their purpose by swimming, as can 
easily be seen, while the sun shines on the column about noon, 
during a very bright day. The fall is not more than four feet in 
height. The most extraordinary leaps are made not by salmon, 
but by herlings, some of which I have seen spinning to a height 
of ten feet perpendicular, as near as I could judge. 

We have loach and stickle-back, but no minnows. 

The natural history of the eel is, in some respects, very curious, 
and may be regarded as the converse of that of the salmon. 
Both are migratory ; but, while the salmon is -oviparous, and 
breeds in rivers, the eel is viviparous, and produces in the sea. 
Eels begin to evacuate the fresh water in October, and, by the 
middle of winter, not one is to be found, even in the minutest 
lochs or dams at the greatest distance from the sea. Near the 
southern summit of the ridge of our hills, there is a small pond 
for supplying a thrashing-mill. Eels abound in it during summer, 
but, at the commencement of winter, they descend in such num- 
bers, that, as the country people observe, one might fill a basket 
with them in a few minutes, by holding it under one of the wa- 
terfalls. The pond is within half a mile of the Dee, and the 
height above the channel of the river, 400 feet. The descent of 
the water, consequently, is very abrupt, and the singular thing is, 
how the supply of eels is kept up, since they have annually to 
overcome so many formidable obstacles, as the communication 
between the river and the pond presents. In the beginning of 
May, the young eels begin to appear, and, by the end of that 
month, thousands, myriads, millions, are terms not more than 
adequate to describe the appearance of these fish. Their heads 
are all directed up the stream. The instinct which prompts them 
to ascend appears in a striking manner at the narrow gorge of a 
pool, where the current is too powerful to admit of their passing 
upwards. There they are to be seen struggling for days, and' 
even for weeks, forcing their way over the damp moss that adheres 
to the edges of the rocks, and perishing in such vast numbers 
among the crevices from whence the water disappears in dry sea-

sons, that the stench arising from their dead bodies resembles that 
of a h\rye animal cast away on the shore. I had often perceived 
this disagreeable smell before I ascertained the cause. But the 
most singular thing connected with the appearance of the eel fry 
in the river is the simultaneous arrival of the old eels, who regu- 
larly prey upon their own offspring, which they take in a variety 
of ways ; sometimes lying nearly covered with the young brood, 
and devouring them at their leisure ; sometimes singling them out 
and pursuing them as a hawk does a small bird, and sucking them 
in at the surface of the water with a loud smack. It was long 
before I knew whence this very peculiar sound proceeded, which 
may be heard incessantly repeated in one large deep pool, when 
the river is low and the weather calm. 

Adders are very numerous in the moors. The " refulgent 
lamp" of the glow-worm is often visible. On hot moist eyen- 
ings I have seen multitudes of these beautiful insects scatter- 
ed like " sparkling gems" over our meadows. From a bog, 
about a mile from the manse, I have frequently brought a plen- 
tiful crop to my garden, which, for many nights after their 
transportation, they would continue to illuminate. I had thrown 
seven one night into a grass plot in front of my house, and was 
much amused, next evening, at the alarm of one of my servants, 
who rushed suddenly into my room, exclaiming, that the grass 
before the door was " in a bleeze." The poor woman, who never 
in her life had seen so many glow-worms, had some reason for her 
apprehensions, as many a " bleeze" is less brilliant than the lustre 
of these earth-born pleiades. 

II. — Civil History. 
Antiquities, Sfc. — On one of the wildest and least frequented 
moors is a Druidical circle and cairn. The stones which compose 
the circle are eleven in number, with a twelfth one in the centre, 
the summits of them all just appearing at the surface of the ground. 
The large pile of stones which constitutes the cairn, is a few paces 
to the westward of the circle. Not far from these, on Kirkconnel 
moor, is the grave of a martyr called M'Clement, who was slain 
along with four others, and buried on that spot during " the perse- 
cution" in 1685. One of his fellow-sufferers is interred in the 
church-yard of Anwoth, where there is a long rhymed epitaph on 
his gravestone, which is printed in the " Cloud of Witnesses." Ten 
years ago, a sermon was preached on the spot where he was killed, 
and a collection made to defray the expense of a monument to his

memory. An immense multitude, amounting to many thousands, 
assembled. The collection came to L. 27, consisting almost en- 
tirely of halfpence, of which L.5 were presented to the preacher, 
and the rest was employed in putting up a stone pillar, with a great 
number of inscriptions. It was unskilfully built, and is at present 
threatening to fall in pieces. The name of the gentleman who 
conducted the services of that day is Osborne. His discourse, 
which he printed, is an elaborate and strong performance, without 
the slightest reference either to times of religious persecution, op 
to the history of the martyr, M'Clement. Of the Abbey of Tong- 
land, built in the twelfth century by Fergus, Lord of Galloway, of 
whom the present family of M'Dowall in Wigtonshire is de- 
scended, only a single small and low arch remains. It forms part 
of the northern wall of the old church, one of the meanest of 
buildings, having evidently been permitted to remain for the sake 
of convenience and economy. It is almost entirely built up, the 
only open space left being a little square hole in which a pane or two 
of glass had been stuck by way of window to the congregation. In 
trenching a piece of ground for a garden, some years since, near 
the farm-house of Kirkconnel, the workmen came on what seem- 
ed to have been a burying-ground of some antiquity. Patches of 
earth appeared much darker in colour than the surrounding soil, 
and exactly resembling graves in dimensions and shape. In the 
centre of one of these patches, a gold ring was turned up, without 
name or date, bearing on the part next the finger an inscription in 
the old engrossing hand, " The gift and the giver are thine for 
ever." This, no doubt, had been the marriage ring of one, loving, 
beloved, and, perhaps beautiful in her day. It suggests the his- 
tory of our race, and insinuates the hopes of our nature — youth, 
love, courtship, wedlock, happiness, separation, old age, death, 
oblivion on earth, and eternal union in Heaven  

Modern Buildings. — The present church is a handsome, com- 
modious and substantial building, with Gothic windows and a 
square tower. It was built in the year 1813. Although so re- 
cently erected, it is the oldest church in a presbytery, consisting of 
] 6 parishes, and nearly the oldest in a county consisting of 28 — 
all the others having been either rebuilt, or enlarged and altered 
so as to suit the increasing population since the date of its erec- 
tion. It is seated to accommodate 420 people, which is rather 
more than the half of the inhabitants. On the 22d of March

1804, the foundation stone of a new bridge across the Dee was 
laid by Sir Alexander Gordon, Provincial Grand Master, and at 
that time sheriff of the county. The plan of the bridge was given 
by Mr Telford. The contractors were country masons, and the 
contract price was L.2420, of which part was raised by private 
subscriptions, amounting to L.l 150, and the remainder by a county 
grant. On the 15th of August, the centres and the whole of the 
building, so far as it had proceeded, were swept away by a high 
tide, combining with a prodigious rise of the river. On the 28th 
of March following, the work was recommenced, but in July the 
county finding that they had expended upwards of L.3000, and 
that the contractors were utterly incompetent to carry on a work 
of such difficulty and magnitude, determined to release them from 
their contract, to obtain the services of an experienced engineer, 
and to finish the bridge themselves. It was finished, accordingly, 
in May 1808, upwards of four years after its commencement, and 
including embankments, cost the county and the subscribers 
L.7710  It is a strong and elegant building. The arch is circu- 
lar, and the span is 110 feet. The distance from Kirkcudbright 
is less than two miles. The old bridge is a quarter of a mile 
higher. It consists of two arches, and is still in good repair. It 
would not have been so convenient for the public, but the ground 

of its condemnation was its insecure and tottering condition, an 

allegation which its present appearance, after a reprieve of forty 
years, sufficiently refutes. It was built in 1737, in which year it 
is remarkable that three bridges were thrown across the Dee at 
different points. The contracts were all granted on the same day, 
and amounted to L.IOOO. In 1832, a bridge with an elliptical 
arch was thrown across the Tarff, about twenty yards from an old 
one, which is still passable and strong  The foundation is upon 
wooden piles 18 feet in depth. Notwithstanding this it has sunk 
considerably in the centre, as appears from the depression of the 
ledges. There are, in all, five bridges in the parish, three across 
the Tarff, and two across the Dee,— one of two arches, and the 
rest of one. Argrennan House, formerly called from its situation, 
Deebank, the residence of Robert Ker, Esq. is a spacious build- 
ing, very pleasantly placed en the Dee. The public rooms are the 
largest in the county, and handsomely proportioned. The greater 
part of the house was built twenty-five years ago. 

Historical Events.— Au estate and a knoll called Queenshill 
derive their name from Mary Queen of Scots, who, on her flight 
from the battle of Langside, is said to have rested in the neigh-

bourliood and taken some refreshment. Continuing her flight, 
she crossed the Dee by a wooden bridge, hastily thrown over it 
for her accommodation, about a mile from the present church. 
The river is very narrow at this spot, which is still pointed out 
and known as " Mary's Brig." There is a well, also, at a short 
distance, called by her name, from whence tradition says that she 
drank. 

Land-owners. — The principal land-owners are, Alexander 
Murray of Broughton, at present M. P. for the stewartry ; Ro- 
bert Ker of Argrennan; David Maitland of Barcaple; William 
Campbell of Queenshill; Thomas Maitland of Dundrennan ; 
Mrs Hall of Valleyfield ; Allan Bell of Hillowtown ; and James 
Carrick Moore of Corsewall, eldest brother of the late Sir John 
Moore, and author of his life. Of these, Mr Ker is the only one 
who resides permanently in the parish. 

Eminent Men. — The name of Alexander Montgomery is so 
closely connected with this parish, by the passages of the " Cher- 
ry and the Slae," which describe its scenery, that, although he never 
lived within its bounds, it cannot be out of place to mention him. 
His residence, now a ruin, was in a neighbouring parish, at Cumpston 
Castle, close by the junction of the Tarff and the Dee. Fart of 
the ruin is still standing, surrounded with fine old trees. A sweeter 
abode for a man of letters could not be desired ; but much of its 
original beauty has disappeared amidst recent pleasure grounds, 
and the residence of the bard is rendered a secondary object in the 
landscape, by a large mansion-house which was erected some years 
ago between it and the river by the late Mr Maitland of Dun- 
drennan. How Montgomery happened to come thither is un- 
certain. Diflferent stories are told, but none of them are 
sufficiently authenticated to justify belief. One is, that he 
obtained the castle and the property connected with it by mar- 
riage, and that his poem is meant to allegorize that portion of 
his personal history which relates to what seemed at first to be a 
desperate, but ultimately turned out a successful and even easy 
courtship. He was a native of Ayrshire, and related to the fa- 
mily of Eglinton. The date of his birth is not known ; but it 
was probably a little before the middle of the sixteenth century. 

• The present owner of " this lovely spot of earth" is Thomas Maitland, Esq. Her 
Majesty's Solicitor- General for Scotland under the administration of Lord Mel- 
bourne, a gentleman who, as is well-known, combines fine forensic talents with the 
love and cultivation of literary pursuits.

He died in 1611. He was thus, not only contemporary, but 
very nearly coeval with Shakespeare. The " Cherry and the 
Slae" is an allegory, consisting of 114 lyrical stanzas, of 14 lines 
each. The measure is the same as that which Burns has adopted 
in some of his happiest effusions : and, although censured by fas- 
tidious critics as trivial and jingling, the example of these poets is 
sufficient to show, that, in the hands of masterly writers, it is ca- 
pable of expressing every variety of poetical excellence, the descrip- 
tive, the tender, the humorous, the familiar, and the sublime. 
The great number of cheap editions of different dates proves that 
the poem has always been very popular. No other, perhaps, of 
the same length in the Scottish language has continued to be so 
generally read. The poems of Burns are all very short ; the 
" Gentle Shepherd" is descriptive of pastoral scenes and local 
manners, owing its success to the fidelity with which it displays 
them ; but it is no mean evidence of the vigour and vivacity of 
Montgomery's genius, that, by connecting the scenery of an ob- 
scure river with the broad aspects of nature, and the history of 
individual passion with the universal feelings and interests of hu- 
manity, he has constructed an elaborate poem, which has been 
read for nearly three hundred years, not by the inhabitants of 
Galloway alone, but by every description of persons who under- 
stand the Scottish language. The two principal foundations of 
its popularity seem to be, the exquisite beauty and literal truth of 
the descriptions, and the shrewd acquaintance with human charac- 
ter and life, which is displayed in many single lines and stanzas, 
under the most condensed forms of expression. These two qua- 
lities, which assuredly have no necessary affinity, often appear 
mingled together in this work in a singularly interesting manner 
and contribute very much to its variety and animation. The sen- 
tentious sayings and practical maxims acquire grace and impres- 
siveness by being set, as it were, in beautiful description ; and the 
descriptive passages are relieved from tediousness and ideality by 
the traits of character and rules of life which interruptand che- 
quer them. While Montgomery worships nature as a poet, he 
knows and sympathizes with the world as a man who is living in 
it ; and the metrical results to which this combination, or rather 
fusion of sensibility and sagacity conducts him, frequently remind 
us even of Shakespeare himself. It is much to be regretted, that, 
in all the editions of this work, the old spelling is retained,— a 
piece of paltry antiquarian affectation, by which many have been

repelled at a first glance from the perusal of it, as from the inves- 
tigation of a cypher. Why should not a poem printed for general 
use be made universally accessible There can be no doubt, 
that, were an edition published with civilized orthography, the po- 
pularity of the work would be extended beyond its present sphere. 
Of all the mechanical parts of his art Montgomery is a complete 
master. One of his most common artifices is alliteration, the inju- 
dicious use of which was the besetting sin of many of his contempo. 
raries. In general, he introduces it with great felicity, although, per- 
haps, somewhat too profusely. It seldom forces him into strained or 
pedantic words or allusions, and thus, while taking nothing from 
his ease, it gives, both to his imagery and language, a great ap- 
pearance of vigour and compactness. He has few inversions ; 
his rhymes are very exact ; his language is elegant, vigorous, and 
easy ; while in facility and sweetness of versification, he surpasses 
not only all his contemporaries, but every Scottish poet, I think, 
except Burns. A living authoress, Mrs Gordon of Carapbelton, 
resided for several years after her marriage at Deebank, of which 
her husband was at that time proprietor. 

Parochial Registers. — Those of baptisms extend as far back as 
1693. For fifty years afterwards, they appear to have been kept 
with great care, and are in tolerable preservation ; but of mar- 
riages no entry is made till 1712, between which year and 1753 
there appears to be a considerable regularity in the record. There 
is then a blank till 1807, the year in which the present Dr Tho- 
mas Brown of Glasgow commenced his ministry. During the 
nineteen years of his incumbency, both marriages and baptisms 

 The abuse of alliteration did not escape the notice of Shakespeare, who in the 
play of " Love's Labour Lost," act. iv. sc. 2, has ridiculed the excessive use of this 
figure with irresistible comic effect, when he makes Holofernes, an old, conceited 
schoolmaster, something affect the letter, for it argues facility, in inditing his extern- 
poral epitaph on the death of the deer ; 

"The praiseful princess pierced and pricked a pretty, pleasing pricket, &amp;c., &amp;c." 
This affectation of the letter did not die with Holofernes, but was used lavishly in 
the following ages, both by speakers and by writers, and even now, though fallen 
into comparative disrepute, is occasionally met with in productions of every grade, 
from the poems of our best bards to the sermons of our worst preachers. Words 
beginning with the same letters sometimes add force to the logic of Dr Chalmers; 
as when he says, " Multiply apples as men may they will never transmogrify them 
into flfricots." They often give the finest edge to the sarcastic wisdom of Mr 
Sidney Smith, and are scarcely ever used improperly by that great reasoner and wit. 
Of great living poets, Mr Rogers, I rather think, is the only one with whom they 
are favourites, and, like every figure of speech employed by him, are always introduced 
with sweet and graceful effect. Whether the same can be said of the following speci- 
men of pulpit eloquence, let the reader judge. The speaker was one of no small pre- 
tension, in his day, and 1 have no doubt thought, with his brother Sir Nathaniel, that 
his was "a rare talent," for which he ought to have been accounted " a good member 
of the Commonwealth," " Be pious, but not peevish ; devout, but not demure ; cheer- 
ful, but not childish; so shall ye convert every precept into a privilege and every 
duty into a delight"

are regularly recorded. For the six years that follow his trans- 
portation to Glasgow, there is again a blank in the marriage re- 
gister; but from 1832 both that and the baptismal one continue 
to be duly kept. We have no register of deaths. The number 
of yearly births varies considerably. For the last thirty years the 
maximum is 35, and the minimum 18. The number of female 
births in general exceeds that of male. Of marriages, the maxi- 
mum is 15, and the minimum 2. Sometimes a year and more has 
elapsed without a death. The greatest number I recollect within 
a year is 1 1.

The number of famiUes at present is 147. 

There are no manufactories. Many years ago, a paper-mill was 
erected on the Dee, which continued for some time in operation. 
Contact with the population which it introduced had begun to tell 
unfavourably on the manners of the original inhabitants, when, in 
consequence of the failure of the proprietors, the establishment 
was broken up, and has never since been reorganized. The ma- 
chinery and all other materials belonging to it were sold, and the 
building itself is falling rapidly to ruin. 

A better sample of Scottish yeomen will not easily be found 
than what is supplied by the farmers of this parish. Their farms 
are held on reasonable terms, and in pretty long leases. Two or 
three only fall under L.150 of yearly rent, and none exceed L.500. 
These are the limits within the range of which the greatest com- 
fort and happiness may be expected for the farmer. Larger con- 
cerns are unwieldy ; by engaging in them he is harassed by 
endless anxieties, and is apt to be led into dissipated habits and 
ruinous speculations ; while farms of a lower rent are insufficent 
to yield a profit adequate to his comfort, or commensurate with his 
labour, besides being always let too high by coming within the 
reach of a greater number of competitors. From the character 
and condition of the yeomen, there is at present no prospect of 
any material or speedy change in the general habits of the popu- 
lation, which are entirely those of agricultural labourers. They

are regular in their attendance at churchj firm in their religious 
principles, decent and exemplary in their moral habits. Illiterate 
fanatics have sometimes attempted to unsettle the opinions, and 
to efface the early religious impressions of the poorer classes; but 
their efforts have uniformly ended in ridiculous failure. The cha- 
rity of the better ranks to the poor, and of the poor to one ano- 
ther, is as great as could be wished. The numerous calls made 
upon their liberality, both for general purposes, and for the relief 
of indigent neighbours, are always answered in a manner worthy of 
their Christian profession. The wealthy are social, liberal, and hos- 
pitable; the;poor are sober, industrious, and very civil in their man- 
ners. Here, indeed, as in every conventional community where it 
is the privilege of one class to ask, and the duty of others to 
bestow, the usual charges are reciprocated of want of charity on 
the part of the rich, and want of gratitude on the part of the poor. 
It is natural that they who have little should wish to have more ; 
nor is it likely that persons who are in want of every thing, and 
owe whatever they enjoy to the munificence of others, will ever 
think that their wants are suflficiently supplied, or that the mea- 
sure of charity is in any case perfect. On the other hand, I would 
agree with those who pronounce that he who wants gratitude can 
possess no virtue, did I not know that the tenderest and most un- 
wearied offices of neighbourhood and friendship are often rendered 
to their fellow poor by the individuals who are most marked for 
thanklessness to their superiors. Well entitled as every Christian 
philanthropist is to the veneration of those whom he clothes or 
feeds, it should never be forgotten, that the loftiest philanthropy 
is that which looks for no gratitude at all ; but, intent only on the 
relief of wretchedness, under whatever form it may be found, con- 
tinues to " disperse" its offerings over a neighbourhood, in despite 
of the thankless and even maledictory spirit with which they may 
be oftentimes received. Two descriptions of the character and 
manners of the inhabitants have been drawn,— one by Mr Robb, 
in 1793, the other, referring to a much earlier period, inserted by 
him in his Statistical Account, although he does not mention the 
authority on which it proceeds. 

IV. — Industry.  
In consequence of the late rainy seasons, the barley crops and 
theo-rass crops that follow themhave suffered so severely, that seve- 
ral l-armers have ceased to raise barley to the same extent as m 
former years. In some instances the oats of last year yielded a

higher price than the barley per bushel. The weight of the lat- 
ter used to run from 49 lbs. to 53 lbs. per bushel ; but of late it 
has sunk so low as 42 lbs, A regular rotation system of husbandry 
is now introduced. Some farmers, I believe, still crop too severely, 
but, as old leases drop, that abuse is guarded against by the land- 
lords in granting new ones. The rotation extends to four, or in 
very good soils to five years, but never goes beyond that. For- 
merly a rotation of seven, and even eight years was not uncom- 
mon. Turnips are every where cultivated, and in general to great 
advantage. The kinds commonly raised are the Swedish, the globe, 
the purple top, and the yellow bullock.

Live-Stock. — The large cattle are all of the Galloway breed, 
with the exception of those on three or four farms, where the Ayr- 
shire kind have been introduced, with a view to the dairy system. 
The sheep are mostly of the Leicester breed on the arable farms. 
On such as contain moorland, the Cheviot and the black-faced are 
kept. 

Rent and Wages. — The average rent of arable land is L. 1, 2s. 
per acre. Wages of male firm servants from L.5 to L. 6 per half 
year, with food and lodging, but without washing ; or L.2 with 
house and garden, and henejit, the last comprehending a certain 
allowance of meal, potatoes, coal, and sometimes barley. The 
expense of a first-rate farm servant is about L. 12 half yearly. 
The wages of female servants from L.2, 5s. to L. 3 for the same 
period. Male labourers per day from Is. 3d. to Is. 6d.; females 
from 8d. to lOd. without victuals. 

There is a port at Tongland bridge to which sloops of 30 or 
40 tons 20 cwt. per ton come regularly, and occasionally a small

brig imports lime, coal, and bone manure. Exports grain, pota- 
toes, and timber. The lime and coals are brought from Cumber- 
land, the bone manure from Liverpool and Ireland. Lime from 
Is. Id. to Is, 3d. her bushel. Coals from 10s. 6d. to 14s. 6d. per 
imperial ton. Bone manure, at an average, 2s. 9d. per bushel. 
From the extravagant price of coal, repeated attempts have been 
made to find it in the neighbourhood, but hitherto in vain. The 
fuel used by people at a distance from the port consists principally 
of turf, peats, and the weedings of plantations. A great deal of 
furze used to be consumed by the poor, but the severe frost of 
1837-1838 almost totally destroyed it. Cotton mills might be 
erected with great advantage on the Dee. Falls of thirty feet 
could easily be commanded within 500 yards of the harbour, and 
were a spirited and well-ordered establishment of this kind set 
agoing, it would confer immense benefits on the whole country, 
but on no part more than the neighbouring town of Kirkcudbright, 
which has long been stagnant for want of trade, and where all the 
necessaries of life, and manufactured goods of every description, 
are of inferior quality and at the highest prices. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Ecclesiastical State. — The church and manse are situated upon 
the Dee at the southern extremity of the parish. The manse was 
built in 1798, and is still in good repair. The site is very pleasant, 
and the views from some of the neighbouring heights are beautiful 
in the extreme. The glebe consists of about ten acres of land, va- 
lued at L. 3 per acre. It runs along the river to the east, and is sup- 
posed to include a right to the salmon-fishing in that part, but as 
yet the question has not been tried. The sum of L. 15, 17.s. lOd. 
is given by Government to augment the stipend. 

Education. — The public school is placed in the middle of the pa- 
rish, and is in good repair. The schoolmaster has a house and gar- 
den. His salary is the maximum. The average attendance through 
the year is 75. The branches taught are, writing, arithmetic, 
Eno-lish reading and book-keeping. A private school kept by a 
female has an average attendance of 20. She has a salary of 
L. 10 raised by subscription. A Sunday school is taught by the 
same individual. Famihes residing at the outskirts of the parish 
find it more convenient to send their children to schools in the 
Tieio-hbouring parishes, than to those within the bounds of their 
own. By a return which I made two years ago to Mr Colqu- 
houn of Kellermont, it appeared that, of the whole population 1 



TON GLAND.

in 5 attended school,— a larger proportion, I believe, than is 
generally to be found in Scotland, celebrated as its people are for 
attending to the education of the young. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— We have three classes of poor, re- 
gular, occasional, and insane; and they are supplied with aid in three 
different ways, — by church collections, by subscriptions, and by vo- 
luntary assessment. The regular poor are those upon the roll. They 
are at present 15 in number, and nearly all of them old and infirm 
widows. The church collections, amounting to an average of L.12 
per quarter, are distributed among them exclusively, with the excep- 
tion of a guinea to the precentor, and 15s. to the beadle ; each pau- 
per receiving not less than 7s. and not more than 15s. per quarter. 
The occasional poor are such labourers as are either disabled 
by disease or accident, or cannot find employment in severe 
winters. The methods resorted to for their relief are petitions to 
the inhabitants of the parish, and applications to the non-resident 
heritors ; methods which hitherto have never failed to bring the 
necessary supply, although individuals sometimes prove illiberal 
and testy. In the winter of 1837-38, L. 36 was collected in 
this manner, which was expended in coals and oatmeal. A vo- 
luntary assessment, amounting to L. 24 per annum, is applied to 
the maintenance of two insane females, who are boarded with 
relations. Perhaps I ought to mention a fourth class of persons, 
for whom a voluntary assessment has sometimes been resorted to, 
consisting of individuals, who, after seeing better days, have sunk 
to poverty, and reached the extremity of age. Such instances 
lately occurred in two families, each composed of three indivi- 
duals, — husband, wife, and daughter. One of them was upwards 
of 90, and three of them were near it. As they required con- 
stant attendance, the heritors unanimously agreed to assess them- 
selves in L. 16 per annum, which had to be paid only twice ; all 
the old people having expired within two years from the time of 
the assessment. There is every reason to believe, that, had this 
assessment been a legal one, and as such applied to the general 
purposes of parochial pauperism, instead of being limited to special 
cases, it would have become a permanent burden on the land- 
holders. Voluntary assessments cease, as the objects for which 
they are imposed disappear; but legal assessments create a host 
of applicants, whose clamours inevitably lead to their periodical and 
indefinite extension. The only other source of income to the poor is 
L. 100, verbally bequeathed to them by Mr Alexander Robb, on his

deathbed, of wliich the interest is applied to their relief. The great- 
est annual amount I have known arising from these different sources 
was L. 132, collected three years ago. The average per annum, 
I should think, about L. 75. The management of the funds is in 
the hands of the kirk-session, and attended with no expense what- 
ever. Vagrant mendicants, accompanied sometimes by troops of 
ragged and filthy children, had become an intolerable nuisance, and 
by their insolent importunities and frequent impositions, had pro- 
duced an impression unfavourable to the interests even of the native 
poor. The baseness of some of these miscreants is almost beyond 
belief. It has repeatedly happened that when the farmers, of whom 
thev asked lodgings for the night, were prompted by a supererogation 
of benevolence, to furnish them with bed-clothes, the vagabonds 
would abscond in the morning, before the family were astir, 
carrying ofiF with them every article of their benefactor's property 
within their reach. The attention of the gentlemen of the county, 
however, has been at length energetically directed to the preva- 
lence of mendicity, and the consequent appointment of a rural po- 
lice, although of short duration, has already had a sensible effect 
in suppressing the abuse.

I._ToPOGRAPHY AND NaTURAL HiSTORY. 

Name. — Balmaclellan is one of the four parishes in the 
northern district of thestewartry of Kirkcudbright, commonly known 
by the name of Glenkens. The compound word Bal-Maclel- 
lan is understood to signify the township or manor of the Maclel- 
lans, once extensive proprietors in Galloway. The power of this 
ancient family, however, is now gone ; the title of Baron Kirkcud- 
bright, by which a branch of it was ennobled in 1633, is now dor-

mant, and no individual of tlie name has possessed land in tlie pa- 
rish for more than a hundred years. 

Extent, Figure, cc— The parish is oi' an oblong figure, and 
bounded almost entirely by streams and rivers. From the Ken, 
on the west, it stretches to the river Urr, which, flowing from a 
loch of the same name, forms its eastern boundary for several 
miles. The Craig and Crogo rivulets, rising from the same range 
of hills, run in opposite directions, and separate it from the parish 
of Parton, on the south ; while on the north, the Garple and an- 
other smaller stream separate it from Dairy and Glencairn. The 
whole superficies is estimated in the county map at 37 square 
miles. It is the smallest parish in the district. 

Topographical Appearances, Sc. — Along the banks of the Ken 
a series of drums stretches towards the interior for two or three 
miles. The country then assumes a wilder and more rugged as- 
pect. Moors, morasses, and hills of considerable height appear, 
interspersed with a few cultivated fields. Eastward, the land has 
been rapidly emerging from its originally barren and uninteresting 
condition. There still, however, remain extensive plains of moss, 
possessing all the sterility of the desert, and apparently incapable 
of the least improvement. 

Meteorology. — The climate is upon the whole damp and the 
heights swampy. As drainage is scarcely known or imperfectly 
practised, water continues long on the hills. No epidemic pre- 
vails : rheumatism is common ; and perhaps more people die of pul- 
monary complaints than of any other. 

Hydrography. — The lakes or lochs in Balmaclellan are nume- 
rous. They are principally situated among the upland heights, 
but are far inferior in beauty to Loch Ken. This noble sheet of 
water sweeps the western boundary of the parish, and presents to 
the eye an agreeable variety of bay, promontory, and wooded isle. 
The river that suppHes this splendid loch frequently overflows 
its banks till the whole valley assumes the appearance of an inland 
sea. The most destructive of these periodical inundations occurs 
in the beginning of August or end of July, and is known in 
the country by the name of the Lammas Speat. Of the innume- 
rable tributaries that tend to this immense increase of waters, the 
Garple is deserving of notice. In some parts, it flows through a 
narrow and rugged channel, while on either side rise lofty preci- 
pices wooded to their summit. Its progress is marked by a few 
waterfalls. The most picluresque of these is the Holy Linn, a

cascade worthy of its present celebrity, both on account of its na- 
tural beauty, and from having been the spot where the ejected mini- 
ster of the parish, in persecuting times, occasionally baptized the 
children of his flock. In alluding to the scenery of Balmaclellan, 
tlie extensive and varied prospect in the neighbourhood of the vil- 
lage is well entitled to notice. Tourists, painters, and poets have 
all endeavoured to do it justice, but we have seen no effort either 
of the pencil or pen at all worthy of it. It will stand a compari- 
son with the fairest scenes in the Highlands, and presents a fine 
combination of all the features mentioned by Scott in his descrip- 
tion of national landscape : 

" Land of brown heath and shaggy wood, 
Land of the mountain and the flood." 

Geology. — The principal rocks are whinstone and slate. There 
are two quarries of the latter within the parish. The metal is 
excellent, but they have not been wrought to any extent for several 
years. 

Zoology.— The lakes of Balmaclellan are frequented by a great 
variety of water-fowl. Here wild geese and swans are occasional 
visitants. The coot is rarely found, yet we have seen its rude and 
singular nest among the reeds on the rushy margin of Loch Ken. 
It is so constructed as to float on the surface, and to rise or fall 
with the water. A still rarer bird is the kingfisher. It has been 
seen hovering over the Garple, and watching its prey as it rose to 
the surface of the stream. The small grebe is seldom noticed. 
Herons are by no means uncommon. Allured by an abundant 
supply of fish, these birds wander at certain seasons by the loneliest 
streams and most secluded lakes. The rapacious birds are not 
numerous. The eagle confines his range to the wilder scenery 
west of the Ken, and rarely crosses the parish. Hawks, however, 
reared in other quarters, take long flights, and sweep the culti- 
vated fields for partridge and smaller birds. A pair of ravens 
still maintain their residence. Rooks, on the other hand, are 
abundant. Swarms of them, proceeding from two colonies in the 
parish, and reinforced by those of Kenmure, annoy the farmer in 
seed-time and harvest. On the whole, however, from their de- 
struction of noxious insects, they may be looked upon not so much 
as a nuisance as a benefit. A few years ago, a sort of grub settled 
on the summit of the hills, and, spreading its ravages downwards, 
reduced the green heights to absolute sterility. Thither the rooks 
ere gathered together, and, after waging war with the destroyer,

have roosted ever since, in considerable numbers, on some tall trees 
near the foot of Cairnsmoor. Of the smaller birds that enliven 
the grove, a great variety abounds. At the approach of winter 
large flocks of " lintwhites sing in chorus" on some tall poplars 
near the manse. They all pause together, and then after a 
short interval resume their warbling. A few years ago, the mis- 
sel-thrush and starling were exceedingly rare. They are now 
abundant. The cross-bill forms another recent addition to the 
feathered race of the district. Plantations have increased in the 
neighbourhood, and there this interesting stranger may be seen, 
from time to time, extracting seeds, with his singular bill, from the 
cones of the Scotch fir. 

There are no quadrupeds worthy of notice. The little, spirit- 
ed, and serviceable species of horse once so famous in Gallo- 
way, is scarcely ever met with. Of the wilder animals the species 
are few. Foxes have no particular haunt or yird in the parish, 
and badgers are unknown. Otters abound, but remain the unmo- 
lested tenants of the stream. They are never harassed by the 
sportsman with spear or hound, and only one individual, with a 
trap of his own construction, has disturbed their peaceful posses- 
sion of the deep. This invention, if skilfully applied, and with a 
due regard to the habits of these animals, might be successfully 
employed for their destruction. 

The streams and lochs are well stored with fish, and afford 
ample opportunity to the angler to display his skill. In Loch 
Houie and Loch Urr pike are very plentiful ; and the largest ever 
caught in Britain was taken from the waters of the Ken. Here 
also perch abound, though introduced scarce a century ago. In 
the time of harvest, a very large species of trout ascends the Shirmers 
and Garple to deposit its spawn. In spite, however, of prohibi- 
tory statutes, poachers and others manage with impunity to sweep 
the streams with nets, or, in the dark night, spear the fish upon 
the fords, by means of torch light. The trout of Loch Brack rival 
those of Lochinvar in quality, and are far superior in point of size. 
Two were caught this year, weighing five and seven pounds re- 
spectively. Barscobe, Loch Skae, and the Lows deserve also to 
be mentioned. On the whole, there is no parish in the south 
where the angler may more successfully pursue his solitary but 
pleasant pastime. The following is a well-known " saw" among 
the brothers of the rod and line in this district: —

KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE, 



" When the mist creeps up the hill. 
Fisher out and try your skill : — 
When the mist begins to nod, 
Fisher then put past your rod." 

Botany. — Few plants, in an econonnical point of view, are 
worthy of notice. Chair-bottoms and mats were once formed of 
the bull- rushes that fringe Loch Ken. Quantities of the Vacci- 
nium oxycoccos, or cranberry, are still gathered from the bogs, and 
the fruit of the wild buUace tree {Prunus insititia forms an ex- 
cellent preserve. The brake or bracken, though not abundant, 
is occasionally employed as litter for cattle. Though the bota- 
nist traverse the whole parish, he will find no great variety of 
plants to reward his labour. A few of the more interesting flowers, 
however, may here be mentioned. The pale butterwort {Pinguicula 
lusitanica, never found on the east coast of Scotland, is plentifully 
scattered over the moors. Pyrola minor Qesser wintergreenis found 
on one spot alone on the Garple. The densely matted foliage of 
the water lobelia {Lobelia Dortmanna often forms a green carpet 
at the bottom of the upland lakes. This singular aquatic, with 
its pale blue flowers, must yield in beauty to the white lily and 
water crowfoot, which, in the summer months, here expand their 
blossoms in great profusion. In addition to these, we may simply 
name the following: Solanum Dulcamara, woody nightshade or 
bitter-sweet; Utricularia ww//am', greater bladder-wort; Circa-a 
Lutetiana, common enchanter's nightshade ; Viburnum Opulus, 
common guelder-rose ; Lythrum Salicaria, spiked purple loose- 
strife ; Alisma i-anunculoides, lesser water plantain ; Meum atha- 
mantkum, meu or bald-money ; Briza mediae common quaking 
grass; Rumex alpinus, s\\x\e dock or monk's rhubarb. Roses, 
geraniums, and saxifrages also abound. 

The plantations seldom exceed ten or twelve acres in any one 
place, being mostly confined to small isolated spots. The soil is 
well calculated for the growth of trees, especially of oak and ash. 
A few noble specimens of the silver fir were overturned at Bav- 
scobe by the hurricane of January 1839. They were of great 
age, and had attained an uncommon size. A solitary ash tree of 
a peculiar shape has long flourished at Killochy. It is seen from 
every point of the compass at a distance of many miles, and is 
known by the name of the " Daffin-trce." Probably it was so 
called from the natives in former days assembling there for amuse- 
ment, and, like the inhabitants in Goldsmith's Deserted Village, 
"leading out their sports beneath the spreading tree."

II. — Civil Histouy. 

Remarkable Characters, -c. -There is no event of importance 
connected with the civil history of this parish. In 1545, Ar. 
Scott, parson of Balmaclellan, along with the prior of Inchma- 
home, was appointed tutor to the infant Mary of Scots, and sent 
to France with her in 1548 when betrothed to the Dauphin. 

The Rev. Thomas Verner, a man eminent for piety, was or- 
dained minister of the parish, previous to the Restoration, outlived 
the persecution, and died so late as 1716, being the last of the 
old Presbyterian ministers that survived the Revolution, and father 
of the Church at the time of his death. 

The Rev. Samuel Smith of Borgue, the talented and accom- 
plished author of an Agricultural Survey of Galloway, was a native 
of Balmaclellan. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners are Viscount Kenmure 
and John Eden Spalding, Esq. of Holm. 

Parochial Registers.— The parochial registers have not been 
regularly kept, and are not voluminous. The earliest entry was 
made in 1747. 

Antiquities. — On Dalarran Holm there is a standing stone of 
great size, but without any inscription, which is said to mark the 
spot where a Danish warrior fell in a bloody battle. Broken 
spears have been discovered at different periods in its vicinity. 

There is a moot-hill near the village ; and, not long ago, a ball 
and seven pins of large dimensions were found buried in a moss 
where peat had been cut from time immemorial. Mr Train, the 
antiquarian, and well-known friend of Sir Walter Scott, gives the 
following account of this interesting relic, now in his possession, 

" A few years ago, as the servants of Mr Bell of Baryown were 
casting peats on Ironmacaunnie Moor, when cutting near the bot- 
tom of the moss, they laid open with their spades what appeared 
to be the instruments of an ancient game, consisting of an oaken 
ball, eighteen inches in circumference, and seven wooden pins, 
each thirteen inches in length, of a conical shape, with a circular 
top. These ancient " Reel-pins," as they are termed by Strutt 
in his " Sports and Pastimes of the People," were all standing 
erect on the hard till, equidistant from each other, with the ex- 
ception of two, which pointed towards the ball, that lay about a 
yard in front, from which it may be inferred they were overthrown 
in the course of the game. The ball has been formed of solid 
oak, and, from its decayed state, must have remained undisturbed

for centuries, till discovered at a depth of not less llian twelve feet 
from the original surface. 

" In the excavations making at Pompeii, utensils are often found 
seemingly in the very position in which they were last used. This 
may be accounted for by the suddenness of the calamity that befel 
that devoted city ; but what induced or impelled the ancient games- 
ters, in this remote corner of the Glenkens, to leave the instru- 
ments of their amusements in what might be considered the middle 
of the game, is more difficult to solve. These relics, which are 
in my possession, can now only be prized for their curiosity, the 
singular position in which they were found, and the relation they 
bear to ancient times." 

Buildings. — Two bridges, in the memory of man, had been 
successively swept away by the rapid inundations of the Ken ; and 
it was only in 182'2 that a structure of sufficient strength was 
reared. Three of the piers were built on dry land. A partly new 
channel was then made to give way to the water ; and now the 
violence of the current is principally spent on that portion of the 
bridge which is founded on a rock. This elegant yet substantial 
edifice consists of five arches, is built of granite from Lowran, mea- 
sures 400 feet, and can boast of an arch whose chord or span is 
nearly 100 feet.

aiaracter of the People.— The inhabitants generally live in a 
comfortable manner. They are sober, industrious, intelligent, 
and enterprizing. They live on good terms with one another, 
and are given to hospitality. The benefits of education are duly 
appreciated, and they are regular in their attendance on the or- 
dinances of religion. The only game to which they are devoted, 
is that of curling. All ranks join in this amusement with un- 
bounded enthusiasm and spirit. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture, 4"c.— The parish contains 23,737 imperial acres. 
The land cultivated, or occasionally under tillage, amounts to 
about 4000 acres. After making a large allowance for land un- 
der water, roads, extensive plains of moss, and about 300 acres 
of plantation, the remainder is chiefly pasture. 

Breeds of Live-Stock. — Till lately, sheep of the black-faced 
breed formed the only stock of this description. In one of the 
largest farms, they are now crossed with the white-faced breed. 
The Cheviot and finer kinds are also sometimes met with ; but 
the cross, on the whole, is preferred, as better adapted to the 
soil and climate. Here, Galloway cattle are much esteemed. 
The cows are almost all of this sort, with the exception of a few 
of the Ayrshire breed. It is also worthy of notice, that whereas 
fifty years ago, scarce a dozen pigs were found in the parish, 850 
on an average are now annually fattened for the Dumfries market. 
Estimating these at L.2, 5s. each, the sum of L.787, 10s., or 
about one-sixth of the rental of the parish, must be realized from 
this source alone. 

Husbandry.- — Of the general system of farming, there is little 
worthy of remark. Six of the best arable farms in the parish are 
entirely in pasture, and the tenants themselves are non-resident. 
Of those under tillage, it may be said in general, that they are 
over-cropped. This evil, however, is rather on the decline. A 
few of the farmers still hold the plough. Indeed the ploughmen 
of Balmaclellan hold a prominent place in the district competi- 
tions, and have uniformly carried off a fair proportion of the 
prizes annually awarded. On some estates the houses and fences 
are far from good. There, a system of subsetting has been car- 
ried on for years, and produced the most miserable results. In 
general, however, there is a progressive improvement. Landlords 
grant leases of fifteen and nineteen years' duration, and, on the 
whole, are indulgent, liberal, and enlightened.

Roads — The roads are excellent. Two more are projected, 
or in progress. When the one from Troquhain to Minnibuie is 
opened, the parish, in this respect, will be complete, the means 
of communication greatly improved, and lime introduced at a 
much cheaper rate. 

Wages. — Wages for men, including victuals, range from L.IO 
to L.13 per annum. Women servants receive from L.2 to L.3 
for the half-year. Day labourers may be hired at Is., Is. 6d., 2s., 
according to the nature of their employment, and the season of 
the year.

Associations. — Notice might here be taken of the Glenkens' 
Society, as having given a beneficial impulse to the learning, in- 
dustry, and morality of the district. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Roads. — There is no market-town in the parish. The roads, 
however, to Castle Douglas and Dumfries are excellent, and both 
these places are frequented by the farmers of Balmaclellan. 

Post-Office. — The nearest post-office is in the neighbouring 
burgh of New Galloway. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is conveniently situ- 
ated for the greater part of the population. It was enlarged and 
substantially repaired a few years ago, and is calculated to afford 
accommodation for 370 persons. Though much too small for 
sacramental occasions, when worship is performed in the open air, 
it is still sufficiently comfortable and commodious for the ordinary 
service of the Sabbath. The attendance is excellent. Perhaps, 
however, about 200 of the population might be advantageously 
thrown into a new parish, comprehending destitute and remote

parts of Balmaclellan, Parton, and Kirkpatrick-Durham. A neat 
church has already been erected with this view in the last-men- 
tioned parish. There is little prospect, however, of its being any- 
thing beyond a preaching station. The people are poor, and the 
probationer employed is most inadequately supported. 

Manse, Glebe, Sfc. — The manse was built about the beginning 
of this century. It is pleasantly situated, commands a fine view 
of the valley of the Ken, and is, on the whole, comfortable and 
commodious. The glebe extends to nearly fifty acres, and has 
been well fenced, subdivided, and improved, by the present in- 
cumbent. Its value, together with a few houses in the village, 
may be about L.80. The stipend is exactly L.226, 19s. 9d. Five 
or six families of Catholics are in the parish. The number of 
Dissenting families of all denominations is 22. 

Education. — The parish is remarkably well supplied with 
schools. Three are parochial, and a fourth is undertaken at the 
teacher's own adventure. In the principal school, no fees are ex- 
acted. This arrangement was made in consequence of a bequest 
to that effect of L.500. This sum was laid out in the purchase 
of a small landed property, which now yields about L.70 per an- 
num. The teacher has also the yearly allowance of one chalder, 
or L. 17, 2s. 2d., as well as a house and garden. The whole 
number of scholars in the parish at the last Presbyterial examina- 
tion amounted to 218. 

Poor. — At present there are twenty-four individuals on the roll 
receiving parochial relief. Seven of these are widows. The rest 
are orphans, or fatuous and infirm persons. A legal assessment 
has just been introduced, but its influence on the habits and feel- 
ings of the people cannot yet be determined. 

Inns, c. — There are four licensed retailers of ardent spirits in 
the parish. The sale, however, must be very limited. The inns 
are poor and little frequented. 

Fuel. — Peat is the common fuel, and is both cheap and abun- 
dant. Coal is chiefly procured from Ayrshire, and very rarely 
from the ports on the Solway. The original cost at Dalmelling- 
ton is only 2s. Id. per cart.

PRESBYTERY OF KIRKCUDBRIGHT, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY. 

THE REV. JAMES MAITLAND, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Boundaries, 4'c. — The name of this parish, according to 
the former Statistical Account, is Gaelic, and descriptive of its ele- 
vated situation ; but Chalmers, in his Caledonia, derives it from the 
British " Cell," a grove or wood, — which seems the more probable 
derivation, as formerly a great portion of the parish was covered 
with wood, many remains of which are still visible in the bogs and 
mosses. 

Kells is one of the most extensive parishes in the stewartry of 
Kirkcudbright. The extreme length is fully 16 miles, and breadth 
about 8 miles. It is of a triangular shape, calculated 4y Ainslie, in 
his survey of the Stewartry, to contain 37,978 Scotch acres, and 
about 74 square miles. It is bounded on the north, by Carsfairn; 
on the west, by Monigaif ; on the south, by Girthon and Balma- 
ghie, from which three last-mentioned parishes it is separated by 
the river Dee ; and on the east, by the river Ken, which divides 
it from Dairy, Balmaclellan, and Parton. Previous to 1640, the 
parish was still more extensive ; but what now constitutes the 
western division of Carsfairn was then disjoined from it, and with 
the northern part of Dairy formed into a separate parish. The 
royal burgh of New Galloway, situated in Kells, is 24 miles dis- 
tant from Dumfries, 18 from Newtonstewart, 20 from Kirkcud- 
bright, 14 from Castle Douglas, and 12 from Carsfairn village, 
through which- a coach passes from Ayr to Dumfries and Castle 
Douglas, opening up an easy and speedy communication between 
New Galloway and Glasgow and Edinburgh. 

Topographical Appearances, §-c. — The scenery along the banks 
of the river and loch of Ken is eminently beautiful. Kenmure 
Castle, with its avenue of ancient limes and verdant meadows ; the 
little rural burgh of New Galloway, interspersed with trees; the 
winding river and the splendid loch of Ken, having for its back 
ground the rocky Lowran, and the lofty and wooded Bennan, form 



KELLS. 



109 



a landscape rarely surpassed. The scenery around Glenlee Park 
is also most striking and romantic, every where fringed with natu- 
ral copsewood, and studded with oak trees, amongst the finest in 
the south-west of Scotland. There is in the immediate vicinity 
of the mansion-house a rocky and beautifully wooded glen, con • 
taining two waterfalls of considerable extent. 

The face of the parish is hilly and unequal. Along the banks 
of the Ken, there is a considerable extent of arable and meadow land, 
interspersed with copsewood; but on leaving the river, the surface 
gradually rises into a range of magnificent mountains, of the height 
of about 2700 feet. 

Climate, c. — The climate is exceedingly moist, but mild and 
healthy. From a rain-gauge kept at Kenmure Castle, the annual 
quantity of rain appears much to exceed the average of the east- 
ern parts of Scotland. 

There fell in 1832, - 36 inches, 6 16ths. 

1833, - 39 - 2 

1834, - 54 - 12 

1835, - 59 - 12 

1836, - 72 - 12 

1837, - 32 - 4 

1838, - 58 - 0 
Average of seven years, 59 inches. 

The extreme humidity, however, does not appear to be injuri- 
ous to health or longevity. Epidemic diseases are of rare occur- 
rence, and the inhabitants robust. The prevailing winds are the 
west and south-west; but, especially in the months of March, 
April, and May, there are frequently long tracts of east wind. 
Here, however, as in other parts of Galloway, its severity is much 
tempered. Considering the inland situation of the parish, the 
seasons are generally early. Harvest, on an average, may com- 
mence the latter end of August. When attention is paid, the com- 
mon garden vegetables, such as peas, potatoes, &amp;c. are generally fit 
for use in the second week of June, and in favourable springs even 
sooner. The gooseberry, strawberry, raspberry, plum and cherry 
thrive and bear luxuriantly. The pear and apple do not succeed 
so well : except the coarser kinds, they are apt, unless in favour- 
able situations, to canker. The fuschia and myrtle, with a little 
protection, stand the winter tolerably well ; and the Noisette rose, 
without any covering, was uninjured by the severe frost of January 
and February 1838. 

Hydrography. — The principal stream connected with the parish 
is the river Ken, which forms its eastern boundary. It has its rise 
in the east of Carsfairn, or confines of Dumfries-shire. Upon 



110 



KiRKCUDBIUGHTSllIRE. 



entering Kells, on the north-east, it is joined by the Deuch, and 
at the southern extremity of the parish by the Dee, which name 
It then assumes, and, after a course of about forty miles, empties 
itself into the sea at Kirkcudbright. The Dee, which separates 
Kells from Monigaff, Girthon, and Balmaghie, is also a consider- 
able stream. The parish is everywhere intersected by rivulets. The 
lochs are numerous : the largest is Loch Ken, in the vicinity of 
New Galloway. Its length from Kenmure Castle to the Boat of 
Roan cannot be less than five miles, by about one-half or three- 
quarters of a mile in breadth. Lochs Dungeon and Harrow in 
the north of the parish are also of considerable extent. 

Mineralogy, — There are no mines of any description wrought 
in the parish. The hills to the south along the river Dee are 
masses of granite. 

Zoology. — Ptarmigan are extinct. Grouse are considered to be 
on the decrease, partly from poaching, and probably also from the 
great increase of black game, which is abundant. Hares and 
partridges, were they properly preserved, would be plentiful ; as it 
is, they are comparatively scarce. Snipe and woodcock are nu- 
merous. Deer were occasionally seen, in the remembrance of 
some old people. The bittern has disappeared. Foxes and 
otters are numerous, but the badger has of late years become 
extinct. Eagles are often seen, and occasionally have their nests 
in the parish. Salmon, especially towards autumn, are abundant, 
both in the Ken and Dee ; but there is no regular fishery. Trout 
are plentiful in Lochs Dungeon and Harrow, and in the smaller 
streams. In Loch Ken there are pike and perch. Perhaps the 
largest pike known to have been killed in Scotland, was caught 
with the rod and fly in this loch by John Murray, game-keeper to 
the grandfather of the present Viscount Kenmure. It weighed 
72 lbs. The head is still preserved in Kenmure Castle, and 
bears witness to its enormous size. In Loch Dungeon there are 
char, which are occasionally killed with the fly ; and in the river 
Dee the pearl muscle abounds. 

Botany. The parish aflords an ample and interesting field for 

the investigations of the botanist. Amongst the rarer plants are 
the following : — 

Uva ursi Anagallis tenella Melampyrum pratense 

Pinguicula lusitanica Cardamine amara Botrychium Lunana 

Meum athamanticum Solanum Dulcamara Ptens crispa 

Geum rivale Orobus sylvatica Polypodium Dryopteiis 

Nymphffla alla Oniithopus perpusiUus Asplenium Ruta-muraiia, 

and many other rare and beautiful ferns.

There is a considerable extent of natural copse, chiefly oak and 
birch, both of which are evidently indigenous. The avenue of 
limes at Kenmure Castle has been long celebrated, and the oaks 
around Glenlee Park are splendid trees. The only plantation of 
any extent is on the estate of Airds, the property of Thomas 
Hughan, Esq. It may consist of about 250 acres. It is chiefly 
composed of Scotch fir, larch, and oak, and is thriving vigorously. 
It was planted, we believe, in 1810. 

II. — Civil History. 

Chalmers in his Caledonia gives an account of the parish. 
There is also a description of it in Symson's Galloway, written in 
1684, and published in 1823, from a manuscript in the Advocates' 
Library. It is likewise mentioned by a Dr Archibald in a short 
account of Galloway, printed along with Symson's work. " There 
is a well," says the Doctor, " in the parish of Callis called Kerna- 
dort. The water is very sweet, to which many people resort who 
are distempered with sore heads and stomachs, and it proves ef- 
fectual." This well, which is a strong chalybeate, is still well 
known to the inhabitants ; but not resorted to, as in Archibald's 
time, by strangers, most probably from its being difficult of access 
to invalids. 

Land-owners, Sc. — The land-owners are. Viscount Kenmure; 
Sir William Miller, Bart., one of the Lords of Session as Lord 
Glenlee ; William Forbes, Esq. of Callendar ; Thomas Hughan, 
Esq. of Airds ; John Kennedy, Esq. of Knocknalling ; John 
Hoggan, Esq. of Stranfasket ; William Grierson Yorstoun, Esq. 
of Garroch ; and the Honourable F. M'Adam Cathcart of Craio-- 
engillan. The valued rent is L.4548, 13s. 4d. Scots. The present 
rental is about L.4800 or L.5000 per annum. 

Eminent Characters, cc. — Lowe, the author of Mary's Dream ; 
Heron, author of a history of Scotland, a most voluminous writer, 
of whom there is an interesting account in D'Israeli's Curiosities 
of Literature ; Gordon, translator of Tacitus, and author of the 
Independent Whig; and the Rev. William Gillespie, author of 
the Progress of Refinement, Consolation, &amp;c., were natives of 
this parish. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers are imperfect. 
The first entry is in 1693. The register of baptisms does not 
appear to have been kept with any regularity previous to 1750. 

Antiquities.— Kenmnve Castle is an edifice of great antiquity. 
At what period, however, it was originally built is unknown.

The charter-chest of the Kenmure family is understood to con- 
tain many ancient and curious documents. In the former Statis- 
tical Account, there is mention of the remains of a wall or stone 
dike running through the parish from south to north, vestiges of 
which still remain. The rocking stone is no longer an object of 
attraction. About twenty years ago, it was displaced from its pi- 
vot ; whether from the effects of lightning, or by some mischievous 
persons, is not known. In the church-yard there is a stone erected 
to the memory of one Adam M'Qwhan, who was shot during the 
persecutions in the reign of James II., on Knockdavie, a small 
eminence in the vicinity of New Galloway, upon which there is 
the following inscription : 

" Here lyes Adam M'Qwhan, who, being sick of a fever, was 
taken out of his bed and carried to Newtoun of Galloway, and the 
next day most cruelly and unjustly shot to death by the command 
of Lieutenant- General James Douglas, brother to the Duke of 
Queensberry, for his adherence to Scotland's reformation, cove- 
nants, national and solemn league, 1685." 

This stone was, in 1832, placed in a handsome granite monu- 
ment, the expense of which was defrayed by a collection made by 
the present incumbent. 

Modern Buildings. — The church, which is handsome and com-- 
modious, was built in 1822. Glenlee Park, the property of Sir 
William Miller, was about the same time much enlarged. Mr 
Kennedy of Knocknalling, and Mr Grierson Yorstoun of Gar- 
roch, have both, within these few years, built handsome and com- 
fortable residences. 

III. — Population. 

The population in 1755, was 784 
1791, 869 
1801, 778 
1811, 941 
1821, II 04 
1831, 1128 

By the census of 1841, the population is 1121, of whom 436 
are in the burgh of New Galloway. 

Parochial Registers. — The yearly average of baptisms for the 
last seven years is 3, and of marriages, in which one or both 
parties belonged to the parish, 8. No register of deaths has been 

• Since the above was written, we have been informed that there is another rock- 
ing stone, on the same range of hills with the one adverted to as destroyed, equally 
large and interesting.

kept, but they bear a very small proportion to the number of 
births. 

There are eight proprietors in the parish, but only two perma- 
nently resident, namely, Viscount Kenmure and W. Grierson 
Yorstoun, Esq. 

Character of the People, §'c. — The inhabitants are sober, 
moral, and religious, and of sound and healthy constitutions. 
There is only one fatuous person in the parish. There has, un- 
doubtedly, since the commencement of this century, been a great 
improvement in the dwellings and comforts of the people. Of 
late years, a considerable stimulus has been given to neatness and 
cleanliness in the cottages and gardens attached to them, by the 
prizes given by the Glenkens Society.  The food of the pea- 
santry is the same as in other parts of the south-west of Scotland, 
chiefly oatmeal and potatoes. There is a considerable consumpt 
of bacon and mutton ham. Wheaten bread is coming into much 
more general use, and the retail of butcher-meat has, within these 
last ten years, greatly increased. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — Kells must be regarded, almost exclusively, as a 
pastoral parish. The grain produced chiefly oats certainly does 
not exceed the annual consumpt. 

Rent of Land.— In the neighbourhood of New Galloway, the 
rent of land is L.2 per acre ; but, as in other parts of the parish, 
the arable land is attached to extensive stock farms, no fixed sum 
can be specified as its value per acre. The fences are in most 
cases exceedingly tfad, and there is ample scope for improvement 
in drainage, collecting manure, and in general fkrm management. 
Turnip husbandry might be most advantageously and more ex- 
tensively adopted. That agricultural improvements have not kept 
pace here with those in the lower district of the stewartry, must 
not be attributed to any deficiency in intelligence, activity, and 
nidustry on the part of the occupiers of land, but partly to the 
great expense of lime, and chiefly to their attention being directed 
almost exclusively to stock. There can be no doubt, however, 
that an improved system of tillage, by which the land might be 

ahm.fs'li'"''' 1°"' - "•''" was commenced 

of G the ausp.ces of William Grierson, now VV. Grierson Yorstoin  
J.sq. ot Garroch. It has for its object the general improvement of the neonle

laid down in a richer state for pasture, would eventually be found 
much more profitable than the one now generally pursued. 

The number of sheep in the parish is calculated at 17,040, and 
they are considered worth 2s. 9d. per head annually. There are 
565 Highland cattle grassed nine months, which may pay on an 
average L.l, 5s. per head ; 315 Galloways, kept a year at an ave- 
rage of L.2 per head, and 421 cows with their followers. There 
are a great number of pigs kept which uniformly turn out a profit- 
able stock. Almost every cottager is enabled to fatten one either 
for his own use or the market. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

The royal burgh of New Galloway is situated in the parish. 
Its population by the recent census is 436. In it the Sheriff and 
Justice of the Peace courts for the Glenkens are held. There is 
a daily post. Post-horses and carriages are kept, and a branch of 
the Edinburgh and Glasgow Bank has been established. The roads 
are excellent in every direction. The bridges are generally in good 
repair. The one across the Ken in the vicinity of New Galloway 
is built of granite. It is a beautiful bridge, highly ornamental to 
the district, consisting of five arches, the span of the centre ona 
being 90 feet. 

Ecclesiastical State— The parish church with regard to the po- 
pulation is centrically situated. It is seated for 560, but can ac- 
commodate more. It was built in 1822, and is in excellent re- 
pair. None of the pews are let. The attendance is good and 
regular. The number of communicants may vary from 350 to 
400. There is no Dissenting place of worship in the parish. 
The number of Dissenters in the parish may amount perhaps to 
50 ; of these about 9 are Episcopalians, 10 Irish Roman Catho- 
lics, and the remaining belong to the United Associate Synod of 
the Secession church. There is a Sabbath school in New Gal- 
loway, which is well attended. The annual collections for religi- 
ous purposes may amount to L. 10 or L.12. 

The manse was built in 1806, and an addition to it in 1836. 
Though the rooms are smaller than in tho manses more recently 
built, it is now a convenient and comfortable dwelling, quite suit- 
able 'to the benefice. The glebe, including the garden and site of 
the manse, consists of about 8 acres, and may be worth L.15 per 
annum. The teinds are exhausted. The money stipend is 
L.299, 9s. 8id., of which sum L.9, 19s. 6d. is payable from the

teinds of Carsfairn. In 1755, the stipend was L. 67, 18s. 4d. ; 
when the last Statistical Account was written, L.80, lis. 3d. ; and 
previous to the late augmentation in 1834, 12 chalders, half meal, 
half barley. The rectory of Kells was united by Robert I. to the 
archdeaconry of Galloway. But in the beginning of the sixteenth 
century, when James IV. enlarged the establishment of the chapel 
royal at Stirling, the church of Kells was transferred to it, and 
constituted one of the prebends of that establishment. 

Education. — The only school in the parish is the parochial one, 
situated in New Galloway, In addition to the elementary branches, 
Latin, Greek, French, and geography are taught. The salary is 
the maximum of two chalders, and the whole emoluments of the 
teacher, including wages and Candlemas offerings, may amount 
yearly to L.65 or L.70. The fees for English are 2s.; with writ- 
ing, 2s. 6d.; with arithmetic, 3s. ; with Latin, French, and Geogra- 
phy, 5s. per quarter. The school is excellently taught, and a 
great stimulus has been given to the pupils by the prizes awarded 
by the Glenkens Society. A school is much required in the north- 
ern part of the parish.  The people are intelligent and fully 
alive to the advantages of education. They can all read and 
almost universally write. There is a good village library attached 
to the Sabbath school. 

Poo'.-— The number of paupers on the roll has of late years 
been 18 or 20. Their allowances, except when they require 
a person to attend to them, vary from 7s. 6d. to 15s. per quar- 
ter ; but extraordinary cases are constantly occurring, when 
more must be given. The six years previous to 1842, from the 
failure in the potato' crop, the advance in the price of meal, and 
the scarcity of peat, owing to the wet summers, pressed very 
heavily on the poor. 

The annual church collections now average from L.35 to L.40, 
— occasional donations, proclamations, and mortcloth fees, L.16. 
These sums, with the interest of L.522, 16s. at present in the hands 
of the kirk-session, have hitherto met all the ordinary expense of 
the poor. The feeling of shame at being put upon the poor roll, 
both on the part of individuals themselves, and their relatives, has 
rather decreased. There is a growing impression, that the heri-

tors can be compelled by the sheriff to grant relief. There is, 
however, a great repugnancy on the part of the paupers to be re- 
moved to anything like a workhouse ; that is, to being collected 
into one dwelling, with a person to attend to them. 

Fairs, §-c. — Formerly there were four fairs in New Galloway, 
The April, midsummer, and Hallow fairs are still pretty numerously 
attended. Little business, except hiring, is transacted at them. 
Cattle-markets have recently been commenced, with every pro- 
spect of success. There are three inns in New Galloway, and one 
public house in a remote part of the parish. Fuel is expensive. 
Peats are most generally used by the peasantry and in the farm 
kitchens. They are becoming scarce, and cannot cost less than 
3s. per cart load. Coal are brought from Dalmellington in Ayr- 
shire ; they cost at the pit 3s. or 3s. 6d. per ton of twenty cwt. ; 
but there is a land carriage of twenty-four miles to New Gal- 
loway, which necessarily renders them very expensive. 

MlSCKLLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. 

The comforts of the people have been undoubtedly much in- 
creased since the last Statistical Account was written. At that pe- 
riod, and down even to the last fifteen or twenty years, salted pro- 
visions were alone used from Martinmas to July. The houses have 
undergone a great improvement. Roads, which in 1792 were mere 
mountain tracks, have been opened up in every direction. The 
church collections, which then averaged only L.12, 10s. per an- 
num, now average L.35 or L.40, and this without any additional 
resident heritors to swell the amount, — a circumstance showing both 
a more general attendance upon ordinances, and greater ability on 
the part of the people to contribute to the poor, while the number 
of paupers, when the population is considered, has not proportion- 
ally increased. There appears to have been no increase in the num- 
ber of sheep and cattle kept in the parish, but in the quality of 
the stock there has been a vast improvement. In agriculture, 
though a more liberal system of husbandry is certainly gaining 
ground, much remains to be done. The fences and drainage are 
both bad, nor in many cases is the value of manure at all appre- 
ciated as it ought to be, either as a mean for top-dressing mea- 
dow land, or to enable the farmer permanently to improve his pas- 
turage by sowing out his fields in a luxuriant state. The two 
great impediments in the way of farther improvements are the ex- 
pense of lime,' and several farms susceptible of profitable tillage,

having been thrown together as sheep walks. Upon the whole, 
however, the social condition of the people is on the advance, and 
though some may yet talk of the good old times, as if want and misery 
had then been almost unknown, were their fathers, who kept a 
few potatoes as a treat for Halloween, bled their cattle in spring 
to make blood puddings, sent their children to school with " a 
cauld kail blade" in their pockets for a piece, and luxuriated on 
black oats and braxy, to revisit the parish, they would be astonish- 
ed to behold comforts and refinements in the dwellings of the far- 
mers, and even in many of the peasantry, which in their day were 
unknown even in the houses of men of moderate landed property.

PRESBYTERY OF WIGTON, SYNOD OF GA.LLOWAY. 

THE REV. MICHAEL STEWART JOHNSTONE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Etymology. — Prior to the year 1664, the name of the parish 
appears to have been written Monnygaffe and MinnegofFe. In 
the records of the kirk-session, which commence in 1694, it is in- 
discriminately MonnygofF, Monogof, MinnigofF, and Monigaf. It 
first appears as MinnigafF in the records of 1737, in which way it 
is now generally written. The name is evidently derived from the 
Gaelic monna dhubh, signifying a dark mountainous region, — a 
description peculiarly characteristic of the aspect of the parish. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish is upwards of 20 miles in 
length from north to south, and varies from 8 to 12 in breadth 
from east to west, and contains 127 square miles. Its figure 
is an irregular oblong. It is bounded on the west by the 
river Cree, which separates it from Penninghame ; on the south 
and south-east, by the parishes of Kirkmabreck and Girthon; 
on the east, by the parishes of Kells and Carsphairn, the river

KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE. 



Dee being the natural boundary ; and on the north and north- 
west, by the parishes of Straiten, Barr, and Colmonell. 

Topographical Appearances. — The general aspect of the parish 
is mountainous, being a portion of the range of hills stretching 
from St Abb's Head on the eastern coast. In the south-western 
extremity, a stripe of carse land extends for several miles along 
the Cree, but it is of no great breadth. The highest hill is the 
Meyrick, which is 2500 feet above the level of the sea. Cairns- 
muir hill, though lower, appears nearly as high as the Meyrick, 
from its base rising almost from the level of the sea. From 
the summit of Cairnsmuir, a most extensive and varied pro- 
spect is enjoyed. At its base, the Palnure flows through a beauti- 
ful valley, ornamented by the finely wooded grounds around the 
mansions of Cairnsmuir and Bargaly. Westwards, the House of 
Kirouchtree, the seat of Lady Heron Maxwell, is visible amid the 
old trees by which it is embosomed. On the Penkill Water is si- 
tuated the romantic cottage of Cumloden, the summer residence 
of the Earl of Galloway. The " crystal Cree," in its serpentine 
course, appears like a stream of molten silver, till it disappears 
among the upland hills. On its banks, the most prominent object 
is the town of Newton- Stewart, with its beautiful new church and 
elegant spire, beyond comparison the most splendid church in 
Galloway. Beyond the Cree, Wigtonshire lies extended, diversi- 
fied by hill and dale, verdant pastures and fruitful fields, orna- 
mented by the seats of the nobiUty and gentry, with which it is 
studded. To seaward, the Isle of Man is distinctly seen, and the 
Irish mountains are visible in the distance. Southwards is seen 
the vale of Fleet, with the pleasant town of Gatehouse, embel- 
lished by the richly-wooded pleasure-grounds around the splendid 
mansion of Cally. Onwards appears the ancient burgh of Kirk- 
cudbright, with its beautiful environs, and the horizon is bounded 
by the blue mountains of Cumberland. 

Climate. — In the lower part of the parish, the barometer 
ranges from 28 to 31 inches, rarely falling below the former 
or exceeding the latter point. The climate is mild, though 
rather humid. The parish is healthy, and instances of longevity are 
not unfrequent. The person mentioned in the last Account as 
being 118 years of age, died aged 121. In 1831, a man died up- 
wards of 100 years old. This spring two females died, the one 
aged 91 and the other 92. An old man still survives who is 95 
years of age. 



MINNIGAFF.

Hijdrographj.—T\\Q parish contains abundance of springs, 
though none of any magnitude. It abounds in lochs, there being 
ten within its boundaries, but none of great extent. The largest 
are Loch Trool and Loch Dee, neither of which exceed two miles 
in length. Loch Trool is situated in a singularly picturesque spot, 
almost environed by lofty hills, down whose sides rush numerous 
rills, which at a distance appear like streaks of snow. On the 
south and north, the hills rise from the very edge of the loch— that 
on the northern side rising precipitously. Eastwards the hills recede 
from the head of the loch, the intervening space being covered 
with waving woods and rich meadow land. The lower end is 
beautifully wooded on the southern shore. The hills on the op- 
posite side were formerly covered with wood, chiefly oak ; but hav- 
ing been cut a number of years ago, the young shoots were de- 
stroyed by goats ; and so effectually did they complete their de- 
vastations, that only a few solitary trees remain. The river Cree, 
which has its source in Loch Moan, on the boundaries of this pa- 
rish and Colmonell, is the most considerable stream. On issuing 
from the loch, its course for several miles is through a bleak moor- 
land district. About a mile below the high bridge of Cree, it is 
joined by the water of Minnoch, a stream which rises in the parish 
of Barr. On its junction with the latter stream, the Cree flows 
for several miles with an almost imperceptible current through 
rich meadows, and its breadth being considerably increased, it 
forms a beautiful sheet of water called the Loch of Cree. Below 
the wood of Cree, the river loses its sluggishness, and flows for 
some miles through a fertile valley. About a mile above the 
church, the valley becomes contracted, and the river enters a nar- 
row gorge, the banks being richly fringed with wood. This por- 
tion of the river is termed the " Gill," and the water, for a consi- 
derable distance, being level, it forms one of the finest views of 
river scenery in the south of Scotland. At the village of Minni- 
gaff", its waters are augmented by the Penkill, a stream which has 
its source on the eastern confines of the parish, and, passing 
through a mountainous district, is liable to sudden and impetuous 
floods. Beneath Minnigafi", the valley again expands, through 
which the river flows in a serpentine course, and, after being in- 
creased by the water of Palnure, another mountain stream, it pours 
its tribute into the Atlantic at the bay of Wigton. It is na- 
vigable for vessels of eighty tons to Carty, within two miles of

KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE. 



Newton- Stewart. The Palnure is navigable, for a short distance, 
for vessels of fifty or sixty tons. 

Geology. — The rocks belong to the transition formation, and 
consist of greywacke and clay slate. In the valley of Palnure they 
appear partially stratified, with an inclination to the west. Gra- 
nite is found chiefly as boulders, except at Craigdhews, where 
great masses are scattered. These have been extensively cut for 
building purposes, the stone being of a very superior quality. The 
granite columns, upwards of twenty feet in height, of the splendid 
portico at Cally House, were procured from Craigdhews. Lead 
occurs in veins in the soulh-western portion of the parish, on the 
estates of Kirouchtree and Machermore. The veins vary from 
two to five feet in thickness, and dip to the west. For many 
years, the mines were wrought extensively, producing several hun- 
dred tons of lead annually ; but having latterly become unproduc- 
tive, the working is now almost abandoned, there being only three 
or four individuals occasionally employed. 

Soil. — The soil is various. In general it is of a dry gravelly 
nature, abounding with stones. In the valley of Palnure, and 
along the Cree, above its junction with the former stream, the 
soil is generally a tenacious clay, interspersed with portions of 
moss. Boulder stones abound, though immense quantities have 
been removed from the soil within these few years : they are most- 
ly of granite, and being in demand for building, are cut up, the 
proceeds assisting to defray the expense of raising. 

Zoology. — Foxes abound in the parish. The otter is occasion- 
ally seen in the Cree, above the manse of Minnigaff. The wea- 
sel and the polecat are found. The common gray rabbit was in- 
troduced a number of years ago by one of the proprietors, and 
latterly increased to such an extent as to prove a serious detriment 
to agriculture ; though, these two seasons past, their numbers have 
been greatly reduced. The red deer and the ptarmigan at one 
period were common, but both have disappeared. 

Among the birds which are natives, or are occasionally seen, 
may be mentioned the following : The common eagle, peregrine 
falcon [Falco peregrinus, the sparrow hawk [F. 7iisus, the mer- 
ling {F. Bsalon the glead {F. milviis, the barn owl {Strixjlam"

The streams and lochs abound with trout. Pike are numerous 
in the loch of Cree. Salmon ascend the Cree to spawn in the 
months of October and November, and return in December and 
January. Sea trout are caught in profusion in the months of 
June and July. The sparling is caught in the Cree during March, 
April, and May. The pearl mussel is found in the river, some- 
times containing pearls of considerable size and beauty. 

Deer Parks. — There are two of these within the parish, one 
on the estate of Lady Heron Maxwell, which contains about 100 
head of fallow deer, and the other at Garlies, belonging to the 
Earl of Galloway, the wall of which is nine miles in circumference, 
and contains 1500 acres. There are about 350 head of fallow 
deer, and about 60 head of red deer, at present within the park. 
About two years ago, a number of the red deer were sold, and ex- 
ported to England, and a portion of the park has been more pro- 
fitably devoted to the rearing of bullocks. 

Botany. — This parish affords a wide field for botanical research. 
Among the more rare or less common plants, may be enumerated 
the Pyrus domestica, which is found on the bank'of the Palnure, 
above Bargaly; Pyrola media, on the bank of the Minnock, near 
Borgan; Rubus suberecius, on the road to Machermore ; the Trol- 
lius EuropcBus and Solidago virgaurea grow in profusion on a 
small island below the confluence of the Cree and Penkill, where 
also occurs the Thalictrum flavnm ; on the banks of the latter 
stream the Galium bcreale and the Polygonum bistorta are found ;

In the garden at Bargaly there is a most beautiful specimen of 
the evergreen oak, Quercus sessilijiora, which is believed to be 
unrivalled in Scotland. Its circumference, two feet from the 
ground, is 9 feet 6 inches ; it is 13 feet 9 inches to the first branch, 
below which it is 7 feet 10 inches in girth ; the height of the tree 
is about 60 feet. There is also a very tine variegated sycamore, 
which measures 9 feet 5 inches in circumference, at 5 feet 6 inches 

from the ground. 

Woods and Plantations.— The most extensive, as well as the 
most ancient forest in the parish, is the wood of Cree, on the es- 
tate of Garlies, the property of the Earl of Galloway. It extends 
along the Cree for nearly three miles, and contains several hun- 
dred acres. The wood is chiefly oak, intermixed with ash, hazel, 
and birch. It has existed for several hundred years, but contains 
no trees of any size, having been converted into copse, and is now 
cut periodically, the last cutting being sold for L.6000. Around 
the old Castle of Garlies, there are about 500 acres of wood, a 
considerable portion of which was planted within the present cen- 
tury. On the estate of Kirouchtree, a considerable extent of 
land has been planted. Larch and the various species of fir are 
the principal kinds planted ; on the more recent plantations, 
oak and other valuable kinds are not neglected. Around 
Kirouchtree House, there are many large and fine old trees. A 
beautiful beech grows near Bargaly House, which measures 15 
feet in circumference three feet from the surface, and attains 
nearly 30 feet before it branches off. Within the church-yard 
there is growing an old yew, which exceeds 8 feet in girth within 
two feet of the ground. The greater part of the woods are on 
dry steep banks, and rocky grounds unfit for cultivation, and in 
general thrive well. On the bank of the Penkill, near the church- 
yard, there is growing a number of remarkably straight Scots firs ; 
they are from 5 to 6 feet in girth, and attain from 50 to 60'feet 
in height without a branch.

Accounts of the Parish. — In the Description of Galloway by 
Andrew Symson, written in 1664, and published in 1823, there 
is an account of this parish ; and, in the appendix to that work, 
there is another account, published from the Macfarlan ma- 
nuscripts, which appears to have been written in the earlier part 
of last century, by Andrew Heron of Bargaly, an heritor of the 
parish.

KIRKCUDBRIGHTSH IRE. 



The. Marfi/rs.— The Glen of Trool was, in 1685, the scene 
of one of those atrocities which have affixed so indelible a 
stain on the reign of the profligate Charles II. On a Sabbath 
morning in the month of January, a few of that persecuted 
remnant, who, for their adherence to the cause of the Covenant, 
were compelled to worship the God of their fathers in the lonely 
glen and solitary moor, had assembled for this purpose, undeterred 
by the rigour of the season, when they were suddenly surprised 
by Colonel Douglas and a party of dragoons. After a brief re- 
sistance, six persons, James and Robert Dun, Alexander M'Aulay, 
John MLude, Thomas and John Stevenson, were murdered, one 
dragoon being killed, besides Captain Urquhart, who was shot 
by a countryman. He had that morning, on account of the diffi- 
culties of the road, sworn a dreadful oath, that he would be re- 
venged upon the unoffending Covenanters. Tradition asserfs 
that he had dreamed that he would be killed at a place called 
The Caldons, and, while approaching the cottage of a shepherd 
in search of fugitives, he inquired the name of the place; on being 
informed, he gave utterance to a fearful oath, and, with the su- 
perstitious feeling of the age, drew up his horse, but, ere he could 
determine whether to advance or retreat, a shot, fired from the 
window, brought him to the ground. The window is still 
shown from which the shot is said to have been aimed. A low 
stone wall encompasses the resting-place of the sufferers, who 
were interred near the scene of conflict. 

Battle of Craig encallie. — King Robert Bruce having been de- 
feated by the English in Carrick, retired to the wilds at the head 
of Loch Dee, in this parish, accompanied by the remnant of his 
broken forces. Lodging during the night in the cottage of a poor 
woman at Craigencallie, he was suspected in the morning of being 
a person of superior rank, on account of certain ornaments which 
he wore. She inquired if he was her liege lord, to which he re- 
plied in the affirmative. He asked if she had any sons who could 
serve him in his distress. Her answer was, that she had three 
sons by three several husbands, all of whom would be at his ser- 
vice, if she were confirmed in the truth of his being their sove- 
reign. He then asked if she could give him any thing to eat. 
She answered that there was little in the house but a grist of meal 
and goats' milk, which, however, she would speedily prepare for 
him. While the woman was engaged in preparing the humble 



MINNIGAFF. 



125 



repast, her three sons appeared, all " lusty men." The King 
being much pleased with their appearance, asked if they would 
cheerfully engage in his service, to which they willingly assented. 
When he had finished his meal, he inquired what weapons they 
had. They informed him that bows and arrows were the only 
weapons they used. The King, accompanied by the young men, 
went out to see his followers, who had spent the night in an ad- 
jacent glen, when he asked them if they could make use of their 
bows. M'Kie, the eldest son, observing two ravens perching on 
a pinnacle of a rock, let fly an arrow, and transfixed both birds 
through the head. At this feat, Bruce smiled, and exclaimed, 
" I would not wish you aimed at me." The second son, Mur- 
doch, aimed an arrow at a raven on the wing, and shot it through 
the body. M'Lurg, the third brother, made a similar attempt, 
but was unsuccessful. In the meantime, the English, in quest 
of their illustrious enemy, were encamped in Moss Raploch, a 
great flow on the other side of the Dee. The King observing 
them, informed the young men that his forces were much inferior, 
they amounting only to 300 men. Upon which, they advised the 
King to a stratagem ; to collect all the horses, wild and tame, in the 
neighbourhood, with all the goats that could be found, and to order 
that they should be kept by the soldiers during the ensuing afternoon 
and night. This was accordingly done ; when the English, hear- 
ing so much neighing and prancing, and the horns of the goats 
appearing in the distance like warlike weapons, conceived that 
they were surrounded by a great force, and durst not venture be- 
yond the limits of their camp. After a night of apprehension 
and dismay, the English, though in reality much more than a 
match for Bruce's small party, were attacked with such fury, that 
they fled precipitantly ; and a great number were killed. There still 
stands, in the centre of the moss, a large boulder stone, called 
the King's Stone, against which he leaned his back while his 
men were gathering up the spoil ; and fragments of swords and 
other weapons have been dug up at the spot, in recent years, by 
the adjoining inhabitants. The three brave young men followed 
Bruce in all his subsequent wars, and had the gratification of see- 
ing their stratagem repeated with as signal success at Bannock- 
burn. After the English were completely expelled, and their 
royal master had firmly established himself upon the Throne which 
he had so well earned, he remembered them in the division which 
then took place of the property left by the invaders. On beino-

asked what reward they expected for all their services, they re- 
plied, that " they never had a prospect of great things; but, if 
his Majesty would bestow upon them the thirty pund land of the 
Hassock and Cumloden, they would be very thankful." To this 
he cheerfully assented, and their descendants possessed the lands 
for many centuries. The eldest, M'Kie of Larg, assumed for 
arms, two ravens proper, upon a field argent, with an arrow through 
their heads. The armorial bearings of Murdoch of Cumloden 
were argent, on a chief gules ; a raven volant, pierced by an arrow. 
The ruins of the Castle of Larg are visible, a short distance from 
the New Galloway road. The family of M'Kie failed in the 
male line, and the property descended to the family of Heron of 
Heron, who had married Margaret M'Kie, daughter of the last 
Laird of Larg, and is now possessed by their descendant, Lady 
Heron Maxwell. The family of M'Lurg of Machermore had 
become extinct in the sixteenth century, and, in the course of last 
century, Murdoch of Cumloden, the lineal descendant of the se- 
cond son, sold that portion of the lands gifted to his ancestor. 

Eminent Characters. — The late celebrated Dr Alexander Mur- 
ray, Professor of Oriental Languages in the University of Edin- 
burgh, was a native of this parish. He was descended of respect- 
able parents, though of an humble rank in life, — his father, Ro- 
bert Murray, being a shepherd on the farms of Tennotrie and 
Kitterick. At the latter place, his son, Alexander, was born on 
the 22d October 1775. Young Murray early displayed an eager 
desire for acquiring knowledge, and, though too distant to attend 
school, ere he had attained his eighth year, his " fame for won- 
drous reading and a great memory was the discourse of the whole 
glen." His father's circumstances not enabling him to pay the 
expense of lodging and wages if he sent his son to school, it was 
not till 1784 that he spent a few months at a school in New Gal- 
loway, which he was obliged to quit by illness. In 1789, his fa- 
ther's family removed nearer to MinnigalF, which change enabled 
him to attend the parish school. Here he was distinguished for 
his assiduity and diligence in his studies, and extraordinary facility 
in the acquirement of languages. His attendance at school, how- 
ever, was very irregular, as he occasionally engaged with various 
farmers to teach their children. In 1794, by the aid of some 
friends, among whom the late Rev. J. G. Maitland, minister of 
the parish, and the late venerable Principal Baird are conspicuous,

he was enabled to enter on his studies at the University of Edin- 
burgh, with a view to the ministry. While ardently devoting his 
talents to the preparation requisite for entering upon the ministe- 
rial office, he, at the same time, extended his investigations to 
every language to which he had access, and not only made him- 
self acquainted with all the dialects of Europe, but his researches 
penetrated into the languages of the East. Subsequently he made 
himself master of the Sanscritta, the ancient dialect of India, and 
arrived at no slight proficiency in the study of the Chinese. 
He made himself completely master of the Guz or Tygre, and 
the Amharu,— the two dialects of which the Abyssinian consists. 
In 1802, he was engaged by the late Mr Constable to edit a new 
edition of Bruce's Travels, which was published in 1 805 in seven 
volumes, to which was prefixed a life of Bruce. Having, in the 
meantime, been licensed as a preacher, he, in 1806, was appointed 
assistant and successor in the parish of Urr. His predecessor dy- 
ing in 1808, he succeeded to the benefice, and, in December of 
the same year, married Henrietta, daughter of Mr James Affleck 
in Grancre. In 1812, he was elected Professor of Oriental Lan- 
guages in the University of Edinburgh ; but, alas  was not des- 
tined long to adorn it by the splendour of his talents. Dr Murray 
was naturally of a delicate constitution, and, being attacked with 
consumption, died at Edinburgh on the ]5tb April 1813, in the 
thirty-seventh year of his age. His remains were interred in the 
Greyfriars churchyard. He left behind him, in manuscript, a 
History of the European Languages, which was published in two 
volumes in 1823. A monument, consisting of a granite column, 
has been erected near the spot of his birth. 

The late Lieutenant- General the Honourable Sir William 
Stewart, K. C. B., K. T. S., resided in this parish for several years. 
He was second son of John Earl of Galloway, and entered the 
army at an early period of life. He served in seventeen campaigns 
in the West Indies, Egypt, and various part of Europe. He com- 
manded the troops embarked with Lord Nelson in the expedition 
to Copenhagen. In Spain and Portugal he commanded the se- 
cond division of the army under the Duke of Wellington. At 
Ferrol he was severely wounded, from the effects of which he ne- 
ver recovered. He received the thanks of the House of Commons

for his able and gallant services. His health having become 
greatly impaired by arduous duty and numerous wounds, he pur- 
chased the property of Cumlodcn, in the vicinity of the ruins of 
the ancient residence of his ancestors, upon which he built a ro- 
mantic cottage, to which he retreated to spend the latter years of 
his life in retirement. He died at Cumloden on the 7th January 
1827, and was buried in the churchyard of MinnigafF, where a 
monument of granite has been erected over his remains.

Antiquities. — The ruins of the Castle of Garlies, the ancient 
seat of the Earls of Galloway, and from which is derived the title 
of Lord Garlies, are situated about a mile and a half from the vil- 
lage of Minnigaff. At what period it ceased to be inhabited is 
unknown. It appears to have been a ruin for several hundred 
years. The remains of the walls have acquired nearly the solidity 
of rock, the mortar is so hard. The lime appears to have been 
produced from burnt shells, portions of these being still discerni- 
ble in the mortar. 

On the Summit of a steep bank, at the junction of the Cree and 
Penkill, within a few yards of the old church, and overlooking 
the village, there is an ancient moat-hill, which appears to have 
been used in former times as a place of justice. Another of 
these mounds is situated in the valley of Palnure, near Bar- 
galy, and is now planted. About a mile eastwards from the lat- 
ter moat- hill, there is one in an isolated spot on Bardrochurd 
Moor. Various tumuli have been opened, and found to contain 
human bones and remnants of warlike weapons. In the course of 
some planting operations, many years ago, on the estate of Ki- 
rouchtree, there was opened a large mound, the top of which was 
covered with clay a foot and a half in depth, under which there 
was the same depth of gray ashes ; beneath this, a vitrified sub-

stance, about an inch thick, was found, which required to be bro- 
ken with the pickaxe. On removing this, a circular wall was ex- 
posed, enclosing a space several feet in diameter, and three deep, 
filled with red ashes. Under these a large flagstone was disco- 
vered, about six feet long by three in breadth, covering a pit about 
a yard deep, in which were the remains of a human body, which 
crumbled into dust upon exposure to the air. About a quarter of 
a mile from Creebridge, on the road to Dumfries, there is a large 
tumulus of stones, which is supposed, along with those that have 
been opened, to have been erected over the remains of those who 
fell in the battle fought by the Scots against the Romans and the 
Picts, which is related in Buchanan's History in the followino- 
terms : —  

" During the reign of King Eugenius, the Roman Lieutenant 
Maximus, expecting to possess the whole island if he could only 
destroy the two northern nations, commenced his operations by 
pretending friendship to the Picts. As their circumstances were 
the more depressed, and they were therefore the more ready to 
listen to terms of pacification, he buoyed them up by magnificent 
promises if they would prove sincere in their attachment to the 
Romans, and, besides innumerable other advantages, he offered 
to concede to them the whole territory of the Scots. The Picts 
blinded with rage, and eager for vengeance, allured by his pro- 
mises, and regardless of the future, willingly listened to the Ge- 
neral's proposals, and, in conjunction with the Romans, ravared 
the possessions of the Scots. The first engagement took pface 
on the bank of the Cree, a river in Galloway, where the Scots 
being inferior in strength, were overcome bv numbers. While 
they fled on all sides, the Romans, certain 'of victory, pursued 
without regularity; but, in the midst of the pursuit, the troops of 
Argyle, and other remote districts, who had not yet joined the 
army, arriving in good order, fell upon the dispersed Romans, and 
occasioned a great slaughter. Eugenius, profiting by this circum- 
stance rallied as many as he could of the fugitives, and held a 
council of war on the present state of his affairs, when finding that 
with the forces he possessed, it would be hopeless to renew the 
engagement, he retreated into Carrick." 

A small urn, containing ashes and burnt bones, was discovered 
on the farm of Boreland in 1839, but was broken by the workm n

in their anxiety to ascertain its contents, which they imagined 
might be treasure. 

The following communication has been kindly furnished by 
Joseph Train, Esq. of Castle Douglas :— 

" This was the field of many of my antiquarian gleanings. I 
obtained from the farmer of Buchan one of the instruments of tor- 
ture called thumbikins. It had been kept there since the Cove- 
nanters were shot at the Caldons. It is now in the museum of 
Abbotsford. 

" The Kist Vaen described in Caledonia Vol. iii. p. 233, 
was discovered in this parish ; and many of the Pict kilns de- 
scribed in the same work, may yet be seen in the parish. On the 
upland farm of Craigencallie, they were, about twenty years ago, 
very numerous ; and on the farm of Risk, .there were seven within 
the compass of an acre. On the corse of Slaiks, in the parish 
of Kirkmabreck, they are still more numerous. They are ge- 
rally about fifteen or sixteen feet in length, and about half that in 
breadth, forming an elliptic figure resembling a pear. The ridge 
or side wall is from two to three feet high at the broad end, and 
at the narrow end, it is nearly level with the surrounding earth at 
the entrance. The ridge seems to have been formed of earth ; 
but, on removing the surface, it is found to be composed of very 
small stones, evidently the fragments of blocks broken by ignition. 

" The kilns are invariably placed on the south side of the hill, on 
the margin of a brook, or where one has been, with the door or 
entrance facing the water. The only tradition in the country re- 
specting them is, that they were erected by the Picts for the pur- 
pose of brewing ale from heather, which is perhaps not unfeasible, 
as these ancient inhabitants of the country are said to have been 
thoroughly acquainted with the chemical process of that ope- 
ration. 

« The learned author of Caledonia says, the practice of brewmg 
ale from heather is of a more recent age than the Pictish period 
of the Scottish history; but he thinks the Irish cruithne may have 
used these kilns for that purpose. Cal. Vol. iii. p. 234. Sir 
Walter Scott takes another view of this subject. In a letter dated 
Abbotsford, 20th December 1816, he says, ' The Picts' kiln 
seems to be a very curious relic of antiquity. Is it not possible it 
may have been employed for burning lime  We know that these 
ancient people were traditionally renowned for their skill in archi- 
tecture. They certainly seem to have been farther advanced in

the arts of hfe than their rival neighbours the Scots, which may 
have arisen from their inhabiting the lower and more fertile land. 
The murder-hole is also a curious tradition. It confirms me in 
opinion, that our lawyers misinterpret the right meaning of the 
old grants of baronial jurisdiction which usually bear the right 

pit and galloics. Our legal antiquaries hold that the pit means 
the dungeon of the castle, and that the grant applies to a right 
of punishment and execution ; but I am pretty much convinced 
that the grant refers to execution by hanging or drowning. There 
seems no good reason for granting a right of mere imprisonment, 
which was in fact common to almost all the king's vassals, whether 
possessing the higher power of capital execution or not.' 

" The dry summer of 1819 exposed to view many oaken trunks, 
o\ immense magnitude, lying in the bed of the water of Cree, near» 
Machermore. Mr Newall, the farmer there, collected all the 
empty casks he could find in the neighbourhood, bunged them ilp, 
and fastened them by ropes to the wood in the bed of the river, 
and as they rose, the casks raised the timber to which they were 
affixed. In the clay which adhered to the end of one piece that 
was buried in the adjoining bank at least twelve feet below the 
surface, was a horn 34 inches in length, 12 inches round the top, 
immediately below which it spread into three antlers, each five 
inches long. 

« Although aware that to collect specimens of natural history was 
somewhat out of the direct line of Sir Walter's pursuits, I sent 
him the horn, with some human bones of extraordinary dimen- 
sions found at the same place. The great size of the fossil, and 
the particulars.of its discovery, however, make it appear valuable 
to him. In a letter dated Edinburgh, 27th January 1820, he 
says, ' I showed the curious fossil horn to our Professor of Na- 
tural History. He pronounces it a deer horn, but a very fine 
specimen of the largest possible size.' 

« There are several very remarkable cairns in the parish of 
Minnigafi. That of Drumlawhinnie, on the moor of Barely, is 
891 feet in circumference. The Boss Cairns, on the moor of 
Dranandow, appears to have been equally large; but a consider- 
able part of it has been carried away to make enclosures in the 
neighbourhood, by which a singular cavity has been laid open 
It IS eighty feet long, four feet wide, and three feet high, runninc 
from east to west, and is intersected by another of equal diment 
sions, runnmg south and north. The stones in the middle of this

cairn are very large, and are laid in regular courses from the bot- 
tom to a considerable height, and become gradually smaller as 
they are laid from the centre. 

" The cavity of the Grey Cairn, on the Drum of Knockman, 
is exactly similar and of equal extent to that just described. 
There is another large accumulation of stones, called the White 
Cairn, on the mark of Glencaird. Part of it having been carried 
away, a cave was thereby laid open, 18 feet in length, 5 feet in 
breadth, and 4 feet deep. Several of the stones by which this 
cave is formed, are upwards of a ton weight each. Nathaniel 
M'Kie, the Laird of Glencaird, and his two sons, are said to have 
concealed themselves in this cave during the latter part of the per- 
secution, and thereby escaped the fury of Claverhouse, whose 
.wrath they had incurred by harbouring some people who were 
surprised at a conventicle in the neighbourhood. 

" The Shrine of St Ninian, at Whithorn, was visited by pilgrims 
from the most remote parts of England, Ireland, and Scotland. 
Even down to the time of the Reformation, the relics of the saint 
were believed to work miracles. A direct hne of cairns, from the 
Nith, from the Doon, and from the Irish sea, can yet be traced to 
Whithorn. These cairns, it is said, were commenced at a remote 
period at the different stations where pilgrims were allowed to rest, 
each of whom was obliged to add a stone to each cairn ; which, 
in course of time, accumulated to the vast heaps on which stran- 
gers now look with astonishment. 

Parochial Registers— The earliest existing register of births 
commences in 1694,— there occurs a blank from July 1696 to 
December 1699,— and again from October 1709 -to June 17ly; 
from which period it has been kept to the present time, though a 
great portion of its contents have been very meagerly recorded. 
The register of marriages also commences in 1694, — a blank oc- 
curs from 1696 to 1699— and from 1709 to 1736 ; from the lat- 
ter date to 1771 it has been kept with more or less regularity ; 
from 1771 there is a blank of thirty-eight years; from 1809 to 
1821 it has been very irregularly kept. After an interval of 
seventeen years, the registration of marriages was resumed in 1839, 
and there is every probability of the register being now faithfully 
kept. There is no record of deaths. The record of the transac- 
tions of the kirk-session commences in 1694; the previous records 
appear to have been destroyed during the incumbency of Mr Wil- 
liam Maxwell, the Episcopal curate. A blank similar to those in 

1 



MINNIGAFF.

the other registers occurs after 1696. From 1699 to 1710 they 
have been faithfully kept. There is a blank from 1710 to 1718, 
from which date to 1740 the transactions have been regularly re- 
corded. From 1740 to 1795 there does not exist any record ; from 
the latter period, with the exception of six years after 1803, they 
have been regularly kept to the present time. 

• The earlier records are interspersed with various curious notices. At the com 
mencement of last century the session appears to have met regularly twice a month, 4 
on week days, — while at the beginning of the present one, they sometimes only met 
twice a year  and that on Sabbaths. At the former period, there was public worship 
regularly on a week day, — and the session contained upwards of twenty members, 
including deacons. The records bear no evidence of having been examined by the 
presbytery for upwards of one hundred years, which in some degree accounts for the 
irregular manner in which they were kept. For the suppression of Sabbath break- 
ing and drunkenness, there appears to have been vigorous efforts made, though the 
following enactment will appear rather odd : — 

Nov. 13, 169o. — " It is enacted yt persons driving goods on ye Sabbath shall be 
caused pay two pounds Scots, toties quoties, and shall be censured as fornicators 
besides. " 

Dec. , 1700 " A collection is ordered to be made for the slaves in Algiers." 

Aug. 9, 1701 " The session considering that some persons, as they are informed, 

drink so long betwixt sermons on ye Sabbath day, so yt they either come too late, or 
else stay wholly from the afternoon's sermon ; to prevent this abuse, they appoint ye 
elders and deacons by turns to search ye toun at ye said tyme, as also to take notice 
that none stay unnecessarily from ye forenoon's sermon, or withdraw themselves in 
time of divine worship." 

1702,'Jan. 28. — " The session understanding yt some persons repair to MinigofF after 
sermon on ye Sabbath, and are too ready to tarry too long in alehouses, they enact yt 
about an hour after ye close of ye sermon on Sabbath days, ye officer toull ye bell to 
give warning to all to repair to yr severall dwellings, wt certification yt any who 
shall be found in alehouses after ye touting of ye bell shall be liable to censure ; as 
also ye heads of ye family yt entertain ym ; — and yt ye said act may be ye more ef- 
fectual], ye members of ye session that live in ye toun of MinigofF are hereby ap- 
pointed, each Sabbath evening after ye touling of ye bell, two and two persons, to go 
throu ye town of Minigoff and search ye several alehouses yrof, and if they find any 
persons drinking beyond ye said tyme, to delate ym and the head of ye families qr they 
are entertained. The minister is to intimate this from ye pulpit ye next Lord's day. 
The officer, for his pains for touling of ye bell each Sabbath evening, is allowed 
twelve pounds Scots quarterly," 

1702, June 3. — " There being a flagrant report yt some persons in this parish in 
and about the house of Barely, should have practised that piece of devilrie commonly 
called turning the riddle, as also it being reported yt ye principal person is one Mal- 
ley Redmond, an Irish woman, for present nurse in the house of Barely, to ye young 
Lady Tonderghee, as also yt Alexander Kelly, Gilbert Kelly, his son, and Marion 
Murray, formerly servant in Barely, now in Holme, were witnesses yrto, the ses- 
.sion appoints ye said Malley, and ye above said witnesses to be cited to ye nixt meet- 
ing." Malley after some delay at length appeared, but positively denied having 
" practised that piece of devilrie, of turning ye riddle," but acknowledged that she 
had seen it done in her Rither's house in Ireland, by two girls, on occasion of some- 
thing being stolen, " to fear ye guilty person yt it might restore yt was stolen." Mal- 
ley was exhorted to be ingenuous, but she persisted in asserting her innocence. The ses- 
sion, therefore, resolved to proceed to proof. The proceedings occupy a number of 
pages, and are too long for insertion, but the particulars are comprehended in the de- 
position of Marion Murray. " Marion Murray, aged 18 years, having been sworn 
purged of malice and partial consel, deponeth, yt she not having seen any other 
person doing it before her, together with ye nurse, held ye riddle betwixt ym, hav- 
ing a pair of little schissors fastened into ye rim of the riddle, whereof ye nurse' iVIai-

and that the deponent had said to ye nurse Malley, before ever she meddled with it' 
that if she knew yr was any evil in doing of it she would not meddle with it, and ye 
nurse replied yr was no evil in it, and further, that to shift the meddling with it, she

that some dayes after, the chamber door being close upon the young lady and her 
nurse Malley, ye deponent, looking through a hole in ye door, saw ye nurse and ye 
lady standing, and ye riddle betwixt ym as before, but heard nothing. And further, 
yt ye lady and her nurse bad her deny these things, but did not bid her swear to it." 

For her participation in this affair, the young Lady Tonderghee, Mrs Janet Blair, 
was cited before the session ; and having expressed her penitence for being ensnared 
into such sinful practices, she and Marion Murray subscribed a declaration to be read 
before the congregation, " abhorring and renouncing all spelles and charmes usual to 
wizards ; and having been rebuked and exhorted to greater watchfulness for the fu- 
ture, they were dismissed." The originator of the affair, Malley Redmond, after mak- 
ing her appearance to be rebuked before the congregation, was banished the parish. 

On occasion of the luiion betwixt the two kingdoms, we find the following :— .23d 
October 1706, " The synod having appointed each minister and session within their 
bounds to observe a day of fasting and humiliation, with prayer and supplication to 
God, for conduct and direction to those concerned in the treaty of union betwixt the two 
kingdoms, and other weighty reasons, therefore thisscssion appoint Tuesday come ciglit

professional persons and other educated men, 8 
male servants, . . .10

The number of acres of land which are either cultivated or are occasionally in tillage, 
is about . . . 6,000 Imp. 

The number of acres which remain constantly waste or in pasture, is 80,767 

There is no common in the parish. 

The mosses along the Cree might be added to the cultivated 
land in the parish with a profitable application of capital, though 
it is not probable that any attempts will be made to convert them 
into arable land, until they be exhausted for fuel. 

As near as can be ascertained, the number of acres under wood 
is about 1600, chiefly planted. In the older woods, the oak is the 
principal tree, interspersed with ash, hazel, and birch. The larch 
predominates in the more recent plantations, with Scots spruce, 
and silver firs, oak, beech, ash, and plane tree. Where the woods 
are periodically cut, they are generally felled every twenty-five 
years. Pruning is rarely resorted to. 

Bent. — The average rent of arable land is 16s. per acre; and 
the average of the whole parish is 2s. 7d. 

The rate of grazing for a cow is from LA, lOs. to L.5 ; but in 
most cases, a calf is allowed to accompany the cow. The average 
of grazing for an ox or cow is L.3, 10s.; for a ewe or full-grown 
sheep, 4s. 6d. 

Waffes. — Farm-servants, when boarded in the house, receive 
from L.4, 10s. to L.6 the half-year. Married servants receive a 
certain quantity of meal, potatoes, and money, in general from 
L.18 to L.20 a-year. The herds are allowed grazing and fodder 
for a cow and calf, meal, potatoes, wool, &amp;c.; and their income 
ranges from L.16 to L.24 yearly. The ordinary rate of wages

for labourers is Is. to Is. Cd. per day in summer, and lOd. to Is, 
4d. in winter. For cutting peats, 2s. 6d. a-day is charged ; and 
the same sum for mowing hay. When mowers of meadow hay are 
engaged for the season, they receive L.'2, 5s. to L.2, lOs. and board. 
The season is generally about five weeks. Hay-workers, women 
or young lads, for the same period, receive 18s. to L.l, and vic- 
tuals. Female servants receive from L.l, 10s. to L.4 the half year. 

Masons, who also work as slaters, charge 3s. in summer and 
2s. 6d. in winter. Wrights charge 2s. 8d. in summer and 2s. 6d. 
winter. Dike-builders, 2s. 6d. in summer, 2s. in winter; in all 
without victuals. Dikes of dry stone cost from Is. 4d. to Is. 8d. 
per rood of 20 feet long and 4 high, exclusive of carting of ma- 
terials. For shoeing a pair of horses and keeping a plough in 
repair, L.3 to L.3, 10s. per annum. Shoeing a horse, 2s. 8d. to 
3s. 4d. An iron plough costs L.4, 10s. to L.5 ; a pair of harrows, 
L.l, 5s.; a close-bodied cart, L.8. The wood for a five-barred 
sheep-hurdle costs from 9d. to Is. at the saw-mill; and when com- 
pleted. Is. 3d. to Isi 6d., each hurdle being 7 feet long. 

Stock. — The black-faced is the common breed of sheep kept 
though a few of the Leicester breed are reared in the lower parts 
of the parish. Much attention has been bestowed upon the im- 
provement of the native stock by a careful selection of the best 
animals for breeding, and by the introduction of superior rams 
from other districts. Mr Robert M'Millan in Palgown has been 
the most persevering and successful improver of this hardy race, 
and his stock, for superior excellence, is not surpassed, if equal- 
led, in the south of Scotland. A more judicious system of ma- 
nagement is now generally adopted in regard to sheep stock. 
Formerly, the pastures were often overstocked ; while at present, 
the stocks are kept rather under what the vpalks could maintain ; 
and the hogs are commonly wintered on pastures taken for the 
purpose in some lower district. The present breed of sheep are 
distinguished by a greater aptitude to fatten, and attain maturity 
at an earlier period than the old race, while the wool has consi' 
derably increased in quantity, though rather coarser in texture. 
The number of sheep at present kept is 33,500. 

The black polled native cattle, usually denominated Galloways, 
are the common breed kept. More attention is bestowed on the 
rearing of stock than on the produce of the dairy. The number 
of cattle is about 2000 of all ages. 

Husbandrij, — The greater part of the parish being of a moun- 



iVilNNlGAlF. 



137 



tainous and rugged description, is only adapted for pasturage, 
there being hardly a twelfth part of it arable. Many of the farms 
are of great extent. The largest contains 4700 acres. It requires 
four and a-half acres to graze a sheep, and the rent does not ex- 
ceed 6d. an acre. There are several others little inferior in size. 
On the arable lands, the rotation of crops now generally prescribed 
in leases is, lat, oats; 2rf, green crop; Sd, oats or barley; 4th, 
hay ; and two years pasture. The turnips are generally consumed 
On the lands by sheep. When the turnips are let, the charge is 
from 3d. to 4d. per sheep weekly, an allowance of hay being in- 
cluded. In some cases of old leases, the tenants being under no 
restrictions, practise what course they choose, very often selling 
ofiF the fodder, to the serious deterioration of the soil. Draining has 
been carried on to a considerable extent within these few years ; and 
much has been done in draining muir pastures. 

Irrigation is not practised, though there is ample scope for im- 
provement in the management of meadows. A great portion of 
the meadow hay is composed of short, hard, benty grasses. Were 
irrigation resorted to, the produce would be greatly increased, be- 
sides being greatly improved in its nutritious qualities. 

Leases. — The general duration of leases is nineteen years. A 
few farms are held on life leases, and several for three nineteen 
years, and ninety- nine years, chiefly on Machermore estate. These 
long leases have all been sublet, in some cases four or five tacks- 
men intervening betwixt the proprietor and the occupier; and be- 
ing let at a great advance of rent, and the tenants being under no 
restrictions as to cropping or consuming the fodder on the lands, 
many of them regularly sell the growing crops, to the great impo- 
verishment of the soil. 

Farm- Buildings. — Within these twenty years, the greater part 
of the farm-buildings have been rebuilt or repaired, and are in ge- 
neral commodious and suited to the respective farms. In the 
higher parts of the parish, a few of the steadings are very inferior ; 
and on the estate of Machermore, the liferent of which is sold, 
the farm-buildings, with hardly an exception, are in a very dilapi- 
dated condition. 

Improvements. — No improvements have recently been made 
calling for particular notice, though in general much improvement 
has been effected by draining, and a more improved mode of hus- 
bandry. Since the last Account was written, many hundred acres 
of waste land have been enclosed and planted on the Galloway 



138 



KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE. 



property, and several hundred acres on that of Lady Heron Max- 
well. New roads have been formed and old ones improved; 
though it is to be regretted that portions of the parish roads 
have not been more judiciously designed. 

Quarries and Mines. — There are no quarries, properly speak- 
ing, within the parish. Boulder stones are so numerous, as to 
supply whatever materials may be required for building purposes; 
and granite of the finest quality, and of any size, can be procured 
in abundance from the masses of this rock at Craigdhew.s. The 
lead mines are distant about two miles from the village of Minni- 
gaff, on the boundary of the Kirouchtree and Machermore es- 
tates. The lead was first discovered in 1763, and was shortly 
afterwards wrought. For many years the mines were very pro- 
ductive, producing many hundred tons of lead annually. For 
a considerable period they were wrought by an English company ; 
but latterly, having become unproductive, they abandoned the 
works in 1839, and the buildings erected for smelting the ore are 
now in ruins. Since that period the mines have been partially 
wrought to a trifling extent, only three persons being occasionally 
employed, and the produce not exceeding twelve tons annually. 
Eighty fathoms is the utmost depth that any of the mines have 
been sunk : whether there be any quantity of lead to be found 
beyond this depth, has not been ascertained. 

Fisheries. — The proprietors of the lands along the Cree have a 
right to fish for salmon, &amp;c. in that river. In spring great quan- 
tities of sparlings are caught. The rents of the several fisheries 
amount to L.140. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce, as nearly 
as it can be ascertained, is as follows : — 

Grain of all kinds, . . , L.3,000 0 0 

Potatoes, turnips, &amp;c. . . 2,500 0 0 

Hay, meadow, and cultivated, . . 2,750 0 0 

Land in pasture, . . 1 4.500 0 0 

Gardens and orchards, . , . ]00 0 0 

Annual thinning and periodical felling of woods, . ],000 0 0 

Fisheries, . . . 400 0 0 

Mines, . . . . 132 0 0 

L.24,.382 0 0 

Manufactures. — There is a small manufactory at Cumloden of 
coarse plaidings and blankets. It gives employment to five men, 
and a few women and children ; in all about twelve hands are em- 
ployed. Those engaged receive a fair remuneration for their la- 
bour. About sixteen hands are employed in cotton weaving. The 



MINNIGAFF. 



139 



wages are very low, and those employed are in very depressed cir- 
cumstances. 

There is a tan-work at Creebridge, at which three individuals 
are eno-ao-ed. There are two mills in the parish, one on the Cree 
at Minnigaff, for flour, meal, and barley, a very extensive build- 
ing; and the other, on a small burn on the boundary of the pa- 
rish with Kirkmabreck, at Greddock, for meal and barley. 

Navigation. — The Palnure is navigable for a short distance ; 
and there is a small quay at Palnure bridge, at which vessels of 
60 tons may load and discharge. The exports are, grain, pota- 
toes, bark, timber, hoops, staves ; and the imports, coal, lime, 
bone-manure, and slate. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Toion, — There is no market-town in the parish, and 
the nearest is Newton- Stewart, on the opposite bank of the Cree. 

Village. — The village of Minnigaff is situated on a low piece of 
ground, at the confluence of the Penkill and Cree. It appears 
to be a place of some antiquity, and, long before Newton- Stewart 
existed, was of considerable importance, — weekly markets hav- 
ing been held, and where the Synod of Galloway occasionally 
met. It is now reduced to little more than a dozen houses, and 
nearly one-half of its inhabitants are paupers. It possesses little 
external attraction, though, through the exertions of Lady Heron 
Maxwell, it has assumed a more cleanly appearance. About a 
quarter of a mile below the village, a street has been formed, and 
a number of excellent houses erected, — which bears the name of 
Creebridge. 

Means of Communication. — The post town is Newton- Stewart, 
and letters are delivered in Minnigaff twice a-day. The great road 
from Portpatrick to Dumfries passes for four miles through the 
parish. An excellent turnpike road has been formed to New Gal- 
loway. The road from Ayrshire by Straiten passes for a number 
of miles through the upper part of the parish, and has proved of 
incalculable benefit. The length of the turnpike roads in the 
parish is 23 miles, and of parish roads 30 miles. The mail from 
Dumfries to Portpatrick passes and repasses daily. A mail-coach 
to Ayr by Girvan arrives and departs every day ; and another to 
Stranraer, by Wigton, Garlieston, and Whithorn, leaves Newton- 
Stewart every morning. 

An elegant bridge of five arches, built of granite, with freestone 
parapets, has been erected over the Cree. A bridge was built a 



140 



KIRKCUDBUIGHTSUIRE. 



few years ago across the Penkill water, at the village of Minni- 
gaff, instead of one which was carried away by a flood ; and one 
was erected over the Minnoch last year, about half a mile above 
its junction with the Cree. All the bridges in the parish are in 
good condition. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church occupies a beautiful site on a 
high tongue of land, formed by the confluence of the Cree and 
Penkill, and overlooks the village, from which it is separated by 
the latter stream. It is four miles from the southern and sixteen 
from the northern boundary of the parish. It is conveniently si- 
tuated for the majority of the parishioners ; but to those inhabit- 
ing the higher parts of the parish, it is at a most inconvenient dis- 
tance. This evil was distinctly felt upwards of 150 years ago ; 
but, with the exception of a preacher officiating for a short time 
in the northern district, in the earlier part of last century, no at- 
tempt was made to remedy the evil until 1837, when, shortly after 
the induction of the present minister, vigorous efforts were made, 
and subscriptions commenced, for the erection of a church at Bar- 
grennan, about nine miles distant from the parish church. A 
small but neat edifice was commenced in 1838, and opened for 
public worship in 1839. A manse has since been erected, a neat 
little building in the cottage style. The parish church was erect- 
ed in 1836, and is a beautiful building in the Gothic style, with a 
window of stained glass in the eastern gable, and an elegant tower. 
It is built of red freestone, and the common whinstone greywacke 
of the district, and cost L.1800. It aff'ords accommodation for 
850 persons. There are six pews set apart for the poor, which 
may accommodate 36 persons. All the sittings not appropriated to 
the tenantry may be said to be free. The church at Bargren- 
nan is seated for 207. The seats have lately been let at Is. 
6d. each, 14 sittings being free. No constitution has yet been 
procured, though a district, comprehending portions of this pa- 
rish, Penninghame, and Colmonell, has been assigned to it. A 
licentiate of the church has officiated regularly since 1837. His 
salary is L. 50 yearly, towards which the Earl of Galloway 
contributes L.20, James Blair, Esq. of Penninghame, L.IO, and 
the Rev. Mr Johnstone, L.IO. The remainder is supplied from 
the collections, &amp;c. There is no other place of worship within the 
parish. 

The manse received considerable repair and additions in 1837, 
two wings being added, and it is now a commodious house. For

beauty of situation, it is surpassed by none in the south of Scot- 
land. The glebe extends to twenty acres, and is worth L. 25 
yearly The stipend is 17 chalders, half meal and half barley, 
and has averaged L.268, Os. lOd. for the last five years, besides 
L.8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. 

The number of persons belonging to the Established Church is 
1597; United Secession, 49, whose places of worship are in VVig- 
ton and Creetown ; Reformed Presbyterian, 43, do. in Newton- 
Stewart ; ReUef, 26, do. do. ; Episcopalians, 8; Baptists, 2; Ro- 
man Cathohcs, 81, whose place of worship is in Newton- Stewart ; 
not known to belong to any denomination about 20. 

Divine service is well attended in the parish church, and has 
considerably increased within these five years. The average num- 
ber of communicants is about 400. 

In 1702, Anthony Stewart, in Larg, bequeathed the sum of 
L.50 Scots for behoof of the poor; and some years subsequently, 
Archibald Stewart, in Larg, mortified 500 merks to provide an 
assistant to the minister. The records furnish no information how 
the money was expended. In 1811, Lady Elizabeth Heron left 
L.21 Sterling to the poor. The other benefactions are L.lOO in the 
3 per cent, consols, bequeathed by Dunbar, Esq. the inte- 

rest of which is to be expended on the poor ; and L.lOO, less legacy 

duty, left by M'Taggart, Esq. As the minutes of session 

contain no notice of either of these two donations, the writer is 
unable to furnish any particulars beyond the surname of the do- 
nors. Previous to 1827, Nicholas Simpson bequeathed to the 
session, for behoof of the poor, a house in Millcroft, worth L.5 
yearly. 

The only Society for religious purposes connected with the pa- 
rish is the Newton- Stewart and Minnigaflf Missionary Association, 
instituted in 1839, the income of which has averaged L.14 annu- 
ally. A Bible Society was formed by the kirk-session in June 
1839; 28 copies of the Bible have been distributed gratis, and 
50 sold at a low price ; 21 Testaments have been given gratis, and 
28-sold; making 127 copies of the Scriptures circulated. 

Education. — Besides the parochial school, there are other two 
in the parish ; one at Bargrennan, in the upper part of the 
parish, which was built by subscription ; and another at Stra- 
nord, in the mines district, built chiefly at the expense of Lady 
Heron Maxwell and Mrs Stewart of Cairnsmuir. The parochial 
teacher's salary is L.34, 4s. The school fees average L.28, 4s. ; 



142 



KinKCUDBRIGHTSIIIRE. 



and his emoluments, as session-clerk and treasurer, amount to L.6; 
in all, L.68, 8s. yearly. The teacher at Bargrennan has, in addi- 
tion to the school fees, the sum of L.5 allowed by the Earl of 
Galloway. The fees do not exceed L.IO. He generally resides 
two or three weeks alternately with those farmers who have chil- 
dren at school, otherwise it would be impossible to exist on the 
scanty remuneration he receives for his labours. The teacher at 
Stranord has no salary : his emoluments do not exceed L.20 
yearly, a sum inferior to the earnings of a labourer in constant 
employment. In addition to these schools, the Countess of Gal- 
loway has a charity school near Cumloden Cottage, where 25 
girls are instructed in reading, writing, arithmetic, and needle 
work, by a female teacher. Besides those children whom the pa- 
rochial teacher is bound to teach gratuitously, the Earl of Gallo- 
way pays for the instruction of 20 children in the common branches 
of education at the parish school ; and Lady Heron Maxwell and 
Mrs Stewart pay L.2 yearly to the teacher at Stranord, for the 
instruction of poor children. There are none of the young, be- 
twixt six and fifteen, who cannot read, though there are a few 
who cannot write. There are very few persons above fifteen who 
cannot read, but many of the females above that age cannot write. 
The people in general are fully alive to the advantages of educa- 
tion for their children ; though it is to be regretted, that many of 
those whose children are taught gratuitously are not sufficiently 
attentive to enforce their attendance regularly, but allow them 
to be absent from school on the most trivial occasions. Many 
parts of the parish are so distant from any school, being from six 
to ten miles distant over moors and bogs, as to prove a serious ob- 
stacle to attendance. The population is thinly scattered, and the 
families are mostly those of shepherds. They, however, display a 
laudable solicitude for the instruction of their children, and several 
of the families unite to procure a person, generally a young lad, 
to teach them, as it is impossible to assemble the children toge- 
ther daily for this purpose. The teacher usually goes the round 
of each family, remaining a week or fortnight in each, and the 
children bring their victuals with them, and remain for the same 
period, and thus an itinerating school is formed alternately in 
each other's houses. As the most of the families are poor, and 
consequently cannot afford to give much to the teachei beyond 
his food, the services of one willing to encounter this expatriation 
among the hills, are sometimes difficult to be procured.

Library. There is a library attached to the Sabbath school, 

which contains about 400 volumes. There is also a public sub- 
scription library in Newton-Stewart, immediately adjoining. 

Charitable Institutions.— T\\eve is no friendly society or saving 
bank in the parish. A clothing club was instituted a few years 
ago by Lady Galloway. The contributors deposit Id. or 2d. 
weekly, as they choose ; at the end of the year, her Ladyship 
adds to the sum deposited one-half of the amount, and, for this 
sum, the depositor receives an order on a draper in Newton- Stew- 
art for what articles of clothing he may wish. This scheme has 
been of much advantage to many of the poorer class. A clothing 
depository was formed last year, under the patronage of Lady 
Heron Maxwell, which is supported by subscriptions. The clothes 
are made and sold at the cost of the materials, to those who are 
unable to pay the full price. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of persons perma- 
nently receiving parochial aid is 46, and of persons receiving oc- 
casional relief, 27. In all, 73 persons are on the poor funds, or one 
pauper to every 25 of the population. The highest sum allowed 
to those on the roll is 4s. weekly, or L.IO, 8s. annually. The 
lowest is 5s. quarterly, or 4|d. per week; the average to each 
pauper being L.l, 14s. 2d., and the total expenditure, L.138, 8s. 
8|d. The income arises from collections at church doors, L.80, 
7s. lOfd. ; mortcloth dues, proclamations, and interest of morti- 
fied money, L.40, 10s. The deficiency is supplied by a contri- 
bution on the heritors, according to their valued rents. Many of 
the poor are Irish, or of Irish extraction, and, among these, there 
is little disposition to refrain from seeking parochial relief. Among 
those originally belonging to the parish, there is more reluctance 
manifested to apply for aid ; but this feeling is disappearing, and 
individuals, by no means in distressed circumstances, do not he- 
sitate to apply for relief. 

Police. — A constable was appointed by the county for this pci- 
rish in 1839, whose services have been of much benefit, especially 
in the suppression of vagrancy. 

Fairs. — None are now held in the parish, but every facility for 
the disposal of cattle and farm produce is afforded by the markets 
of Newton-Stewart. 

Alehouses. — There are eight public houses in the parish ; two in 
the village of Minnigaflf, three at Creebridge, and three in the 
country. 

 Tli:.' person receiving this allowance is a man upwards of ninety-four years of age.

Fuel.— -Pe&amp;t is the kind of fuel chiefly used : wood is also ex- 
tensively used. Coals are principally consumed by the better class 
of inhabitants ; and are mostly procured from Whitehaven and ad- 
jacent ports. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

The more striking variations betwixt the present state of the 
parish and that which existed at the time of the former account 
are,— the population has increased from 14-20 to 1826. The ren- 
tal of the parish has nearly doubled in amount, it having been, in 
1793, L.5925, while at present it is L.10,418, exclusive of sub- 
rents, which may augment the sum to L.l 1,000,— one farm, which 
is let at L.42, being subset at L.200. Not the least striking cir- 
cumstance, is the increase of pauperism. While the population 
has only increased 28 per cent., the expenditure of the poor's fund 
has increased 450 per cent., or from L.30 in 1793 to L.138, 8s. 
8|d. in 1841, and it is not lavishly expended.

PRESBYTERY OF KIRKCUDBRIGHT, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY. 

THE REV. SAMUEL COWAN, MINISTER. 



I- — Topography and Natural History. 
'Name. — Kelton derives its name from the British word celU 
signifying a wood or grove, and the common Saxon affix, tun, a 
dwelling. 

Extent and Boundaries.~ln length, this parish extends about 6 
miles ; its medium breadth is nearly 3 miles ; and its superficial 
contents may be stated at 16 square miles. It is bounded on 
the north, by Crossmichael ; on the east, by Buittle; on the south, 
by Rerwick and Kirkcudbright ; and on the west, by the river 
Dee, which separates it from Balmaghie and Tongland. 

Topographical Appearances. — The general outline of the parish 
is that of a ridge between the channel of the Dee and the basin of 
the Carlinwark loch. Its surface, though very uneven, abounding 
with small hills of a conical figure, called drums, is almost all fit 
for the plough. Towards the south these hills gradually increase

ill height, until they attain an altitude of 1200 feet. The high- 
est points are Bengairn, the Skreel, and Dungyle. From Ben- 
gairn or the Skreel, when the state of the atmosphere is favour- 
able, the view is remarkably beautiful and extensive. Throughout, 
its whole extent, the vale of the Dee, rich in natural and artificial 
beauties, is visible. Running along the silvery line of the river, 
the eye naturally rests upon the lofty Cairnsmuir of Carsphairn, 
overlooking the Kells range of mountains, which separates the 
stewartry from Ayrshire. On the east and north-east are seen 
Criffel, Queensberry, and the mountains in the north of Dumfries- 
shire. Towards the west appear Cairnharra, and Cairnsmuir of 
Fleet, and on the south, the sea — in the midst of which appears the 

Isle of Man — lies immediately below. From St Bee's Head 

like a giant guarding theentrance into the Solway Frith — stretches, 
in an easterly direction, the bold outline of the Cumberland moun- 
tains, with the line of cultivation, the rich fields, towns, and vil- 
lages that adorn the coast of England, distinctly visible. Immedi- 
ately on the east of Bengairn, and separated from it by a deep 
and narrow ravine, rises the wild and rugged Skreel, beneath which, 
on the north-east, is the green hill of Dungyle, whose summit 
was once crowned with a strong fort, in which the British sought 
shelter from the Roman invader. 

Climate. — The climate is very variable, generally moist, yet 
mild, pleasant, and salubrious. The springs are cold, the sum- 
mers rainy, the autumns mild, and the winters not severe. 

The following is a correct register of the rain that has fallen in 
the parish of Kelton during each month within the time specified,

Although it thus appears that a great deal of rain falls in the 
course of the year, yet the porous nature of the soil secures its 
speedy absorption. Frosts are seldom of long continuance, and 
, snows are felt only in their beneficial influences. The strongest 
winds and the heaviest rains come in the direction of the sea, from 
the west and south-west ; although in early spring, the east wind 
sometimes blows without intermission for many days, with the 
most piercing keenness. No diseases however, are peculiarly pre- 
valent in the parish, the general softness of the climate being no 
less friendly to the human constitution than favourable to pastur- 
age, and the operations of husbandry. An occasional case of 
small-pox, scarlatina, and typhus fever may occur, but these dis- 
eases never spread their ravages far, nor are they ever of long 
continuance. The blessing of health is enjoyed in an eminent de- 
gree ; it is no uncommon thing to meet with inhabitants who, in a 
lifetime of fourscore years, have never been confined to bed by 
sickness for a single week, and there are at present living in the 
parish a man and a woman, both of whom have attained the ex- 
traordinary age of ninety-seven years. 

Hydrography. — Springs and streams of the most excellent water 
abound in the parish. The river Dee, which has here attained to 
nearly its greatest volume, being only a few miles from the Tongland 
rapids, below which it is met by the tide, runs along the whole west- 
ern boundary of the parish. Immediately above the bridge of 
Dee, and again at a small distance below it, the river separates, 
and by the confluence of its divided stream, forms two large and 
beautifully wooded islands. Several streamlets descend from the 
mountains and intersect the parish in different directions. The 
Slackburn and the Auchlane burn, from Bengairn, after run- 
ning parallel for a fev/ miles in a northerly direction, turn their 
courses westward, and fall into the Dee, the former above, and 
the latter below the ancient village of- Rhonehouse. Three 
other burns descend from the Skreel, one of which flows in a 
northerly direction, past the village of Gelston, and falls into the 
Carlinwark Loch ; the other two run in a south-easterly direction, 
one on each side of the hill of Gelston, and having at length 
united, fall into the Solway Frith near Orchardton. One of these 
— the Yerroch — runs through a beautiful and romantic pass, 
and, for several miles, forms the boundary between the parishes of 
Kelton and Buittle. 

Loch. — Near the north corner of this parish there is a small 



KrSLTON. 



147 



Lake called the Carlinwark Loch. It covers a surface of about 
100 acres. In the year 1765, this lake was partially drained 
by a canal of about a mile and a-half in length, cut from it to the 
river Dee. Six feet of water were thus withdrawn, and the loch 
was reduced from 180 acres to its present extent. This drainage 
was made for the purpose of procuring marl, an inexhaustible 
store of the very best sort of that useful manure — the shelly kind 
— being contained in the loch, and the mosses that were then ex- 
posed. The canal served the double purpose of draining the lake, 
and of conveying the marl in boats to the Dee, from which it was 
carried to all the inland parishes which lie upon that river and the 
Ken. Being thus reduced to the level of the Dee, the Carlin- 
wark Loch is commonly a tributary to the river; but after a heavy 
fall of rain it acts as a reservoir, being raised many feet, and all 
the adjoining marshes being overflowed by the influx of the 
river. 

The great road from London to Portpatrick runs along the 
north-western margin of this lake, whose beauty never fails to 
command the attention and admiration of the traveller. It is con- 
fessedly the most lovely sheet of water in the south of Scotland; 
nor are there many of the Highland lochs with which it would 
suff'er by being brought into comparison. It is fringed with wood 
down to the water's edge, and studded with finely wooded islands, 
which afford harbour to all kinds of waterfowl. Overlooking the 
lake, the passenger has a remarkably fine view of the castle and 
woods of Gelston, with the magnificent background of Dungyle, 
the Skreel, and Bengairn. Even after it had enriched its pro- 
prietor, Mr Gordon of Greenlaw, and fertilized the whole sur- 
rounding country by the marl which it yielded, this beautiful loch 
was sold to the late Sir William Douglas for L.2000. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — No coal, lime, or freestone is found 
in this parish. In the mountains there is abundance of ironstone 
of superior quality ; but the absence of coal, difficulty of access, 
and distance from the sea coast, must ever prevent its being ex- 
tensively used. The prevailing rock is of the transition formation 
—viz. slate and greywacke. The strata of greywacke exhibit 
many varieties ; some, which are called in the country whinstone, 
are of a blue, or greyish-brown colour; of a hard and compact 
grain ; generally break irregularly, but sometimes split into pa- 
rallel slices, of which large coarse slates are made. The beds 
of this stone are of various thickness, from half an inch to many

KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE. 



feet, and generally lie in a direction from north-east to south-west, 
with a slight inclination from the perpendicular. There are in- 
terposed between them frequent strata of the soft, shivering, ar- 
gillaceous stone, which easily yields to the weather, called slate 
band ; and they are also sometimes interspersed with veins or 
dikes of porphyry. Of this there is a striking instance immedi- 
ately in front of the manse, where a dike or vein of the hard- 
est porphyry, about three feet in thickness, has been forced up 
through a bed of slate band. Granite is found in the moun- 
tains. There are also several mosses, of considerable extent, in 
the parish, which exhibit remains of the ancient forest that once 
covered nearly the whole of Galloway. 

iSoil. — The soil is various, but in general it consists of a thin 
light hazel mould, or a brown loam, mixed with sand, or the 
debris of slate band. In some places it is incumbent upon a stiff 
clay, and occasionally on gravel, but generally upon the rocks 
which prevail in the parish. It is very fertile, and yields a grate- 
ful return for any agricultural improvement. 

Zoology. — Kelton Hill was formerly the great mart for the sale 
of horses in the south of Scotland. Many of these animals were, 
in consequence, bred in the parish. But the multiplication 
of fairs throughout the country, and the free importation of 
horses from Ireland, have divested this villasfe of much of its an- 
cient importance. A considerable number of horses, however, are 
still reared for the market, though the true Galloway, the once- 
celebrated native of the district, is now almost unknown. That 
small but beautiful, hardy, docile, and useful animal has given 
place to various larger, stronger, and more showy races. 

Much attention is paid to the breed of cows. The native Gal- 
loway cow, perhaps the most finely proportioned of the species 
known in Scotland, is generally of a glossy black colour, without 
horns, of a round and compact body, and capable of being fed to 
the weight of 45 stones. This fine animal, however, has now to 
contend for superiority with the Cunningham or Ayrshire cow. 
Each species has its admirers and advocates ready to assign sub- 
stantial reasons for the preference of their favourite. The pro- 
duce of the native, though not so abundant as that of the stranger, 
is maintained to be superior in quality. Practically, the dispute 
is settled in this way ; — those who can afford to indulge in luxuries 
retain the Galloway ; while those to whom quantity is an object 
of importance, as the keepers of dairies, — a. mode of husbandry 



KELTON. 



149 



that is becoming common in this part of the country,— adopt the 

Ayrshire breed of cows. 

The greatest share of the agriculturist's attention, however, is 
directed'to the rearing of black-cattle, which may still be consi- 
dered as the staple commodity of Galloway. In this respect, 
there seems to be a strong inclination to keep up the character 
which the county had acquired in the days of Symson, who re- 
marks, tffiit it was « more plentiful in bestiall than cornes." Many 
more cattle are reared than bred in this parish. Some are brought 
from the Highlands of Scotland ; others from Ireland, or the 
northern counties of England ; and, after being grazed a year, are 
again sold to the dealers who supply the English markets. They 
are generally bought at the age of one or two years, at prices va- 
rying from L.5 to L.IO, and are resold at prices ranging from L.9 
to L.14. Some of the best lots bring as high as L.15. What- 
ever disputes may exist with regard to the comparative merits of 
the Galloway and Ayrshire cows, there is none with regard to 
their respective capabilities of being fed for the butcher,— the 
Galloway being readily and universally allowed to take on fat 
much faster, and to afford finer beef than its rival. 

None of the farms in Kelton are held exclusively as sheep-walks. 
A considerable number of these useful animals, however, are kept 
in the parish. They are almost all of the cross breed between the 
Cheviot and Leicester. A few of the small black-faced sheep, 
the ancient breed of the country, are still to be seen wandering 
among the rocks of the Skreel. These produce finer mutton than 
the cross-breeds. All the farmers, and many of the common peo- 
ple, keep a few pigs, part of which are used in their own houser 
holds, and part brought to market. On several of the farms, 
large flocks of geese are seen feeding, which, towards the end of 
the year, are sent to the Edinburgh, Glasgow, or Liverpool 
market. 

Grouse, blackcocks, partridges, pheasants, and wood pigeons, 
hares and rabbits abound. The woodcock, cuckoo, landrail, swal- 
low, and marten are annual visitants. The curlew, quail, and bit- 
tern are sometimes met with. The Carlinwark Loch is stocked 
with almost all the fresh-water fowls common in the country, as 
the swan, heron, wild duck, and various species of the jay- teal. 
Cliinese geese breed in the islands ; and the solitary cormorant 
may often be seen swimming among the waves, or sitting motion- 
less for many hours together upon a pile of stones in the middle of

the lake. Various kinds of vermin are also to be met with, as the 
owl, several species of hawk, raven, polecat, fox, weasel, hedge- 
hog, mole, and rat. The otter has also been seen and snared in 
the parish. One was lately taken in the Carlinwark Loch that 
measured 35 inches from the snout to the point of the tail. 

The river Dee abounds with salmon and trout ; and the Car- 
linwark Loch with the finest pike, perch, and eels. The Unio, 
or Alasmodon Margaritiferus, a kind of pearl mussel, is found in 
the Dee ; and another, but rarer, species of the same genus, the 
Anodon cygneus, is met with in the Carlinwark Loch.

IL — Civil History. 
The ancient history of this parish is enveloped in considerable 
obscurity. It formed part of the extensive territories of the power- 
ful and warlike British tribe the Selgovse, several of whose places 
of strength can still be traced. When Agricola invaded "that 
part of Britain which is opposite to Ireland," along with the rest 
of Galloway, Kelton was comprehended in the Roman province 
Valentia. The progress and power of that warlike people are still 
indicated by existing vestiges of their roads, causeways, and camps, 
placed among the hill-forts to keep the natives in check, as well 
as by Roman weapons, ornaments, and culinary iitensils, found in 
this parish. After the Roman abdication, the Britons assumed 
their ancient independence, until the Northumbrian Saxons, in 
the seventh century, reduced this country under their power. Few 
of that people, however, who enjoyed a better country and climate 
on the eastern shore, and who had already conquered a greater 
extent of territory than their limited population could occupy,. 



KELTON.

settled permanently in Galloway ; and they have left but few me- 
morials, even in bestowing Saxon names upon places, of their 
ever having gained a footing here at all. Not so with the Irish 
emigrants, who, after many attacks on the Romanized Britons, 
before the end of the ninth century, succeeded in gaining posses- 
sion of Galloway, and at length of the whole peninsula formed by 
the river Nith and the Solway Frith on the one hand, and the 
river and Frith of the Clyde on the other. In the topography of 
the stewartry, these colonists have left innumerable proofs of the 
number of their settlements. Many of the names of places alluded 
to, indeed, are common to the British and the Irish, as Torrs, 
from tor, a small hill; Dungyle, from the British din or the Irish 
dun, a fort ; and Bengairn, from hen, a mountain, and cairn, a 
hillock of stones; yet the complete colonization of Galloway by 
the Irish is strikingly proved by the fact, that in this whole parish 
only two places retain names which are purely British, viz. Slag- 
naw, a compound of slack, the name of a burn, and cnol, commonly 
pronounced knowe, a hillock; and Carlinwark, from the British 
caer-lin, the fort-lake, and the tautological Scoto- Saxon wark, a 
castle or large structure of any kind. The name of Kirk-cormic, 
or rather Kil-cormic, as it was formerly written, one of the three 
parishes of which Kelton is composed, is purely Irish, kil signify- 
ing a church, and Cormic being the successor of Saint Patrick, 
and called in the Ulster Annals Saint Patrick's heir. For many 
ages, this people predominated in Galloway, speaking their own 
language, having their own officers, called reuli or kings, being 
governed by their own laws, and retaining their national manners 
and customs, even to the point of rebellion whenever they were 
attempted to be interfered with, as was the case in the times of 
Malcolm IV. and Alexander II. The manners of the Galwe- 
gians, as described by Symson in 1684, shew a great resemblance 
to the peculiarities of the Irish peasantry at the present day ; but 
recent improvements, and increased facilities of intercourse, have 
changed the habits and customs of the people, and assimilated their 
modes of life to the Scottish national standard. 

It would be foreign to the object of a work like the present to 
pursue the civil history of this parish, mixed up as it is with that 
of the district through all the desolating feuds of its native lords ; 
the wars that originated in the disputed succession to the throne 
of Scotland, in which the Galwegians naturally took part with 
their countrymen the Comyns and Baliols, and consequently shared

in all then- disasters ; the oppressions of the Earls of Douglas • its 
dehverance by James 11. ; its distracted state, arising out o 'tl I 
jealous.es and quarrels of its petty chiefs; the incursions of the' 
lnohsh, until the union of the Scottish and English crown, ave 
repose to the harassed and almost depopulated country. Suffice 
U to say that the parish of Kelton, from its central position, and 
especially rom its proximity to the Castles of Buittle and Thrieve, 
the strongholds of the ambitious and turbulent families of the Ba- 
hols and Douglasses, was necessarily the theatre of many interest- 
ing and important transactions, altogether lost sight of by history, 
and concerning which even tradition is now almost silent. 

In Blaeu's "Atlas Scotia," there is a description of the parish 
of Kelton, furnished by John Maclellan about the year 1650. It 
IS particularly described in Symson's MS. Account of Galloway, 
1684; and it is also noticed in Chalmers' Caledonia, Vol. iii. 
p. 314.

Parochial Hegisters.—h is to be hoped that there are few pa- 
rishes in Scotland, the registers of which have been so carelessly 
kept as those of Kelton. The session records extend no farther 
back than the year 1715. For the next eleven years from that 
date the proceedings of the session are regularly minuted, and the 
register of births is also complete. But from 1726 down to 1762, 
neither record nor register can be found. For the next twentv-two

Vears tliey have been regularly kept; but from 1794 down to

ter of births has been quite neglected. The transactions of the 
session are now regularly minuted ; but so inveterate has become 
the habit of neglecting the register that not one parent in ten can 
be persuaded to record the births of his children. 

Antiquities. — This parish exhibits traces of all the nations who 
have .successively occupied Galloway. 1. On the farm of Torrs 
there is an imperfect circle of upright stones, the remains of a 
Druidical temple, in the neighbourhood of which there is a copious 
spring of excellent water. In such places, the pagan aborigines and 
their descendants, the Selgovfe, performed their superstitious wor- 
ship and impious rites of divination. 2. Of the numerous remains 
of the hill forts of that ancient people which are found in this 
district, the most remarkable is situated upon the hill of Dun- 
gyle, near the ruins of Gelston kirk. It is of the usual circu- 
lar form, and surrounded with three ramparts of stones mixed 
with earth. At a little distance there is a smaller one, fortified 
in the same way. The former is 117, and the latter 68 paces in 
diameter. 3. On opening a sepulchral tumulus near Gelston, 
which is not far from the route of Agricola's army through Gal- 
loway, there was found a stone coffin, seven feet long, and three 
feet wide, which contained human bones of unusual leno-th and 

O 

thickness. These appear to have been the relics of some ancient 
warrior, as there was also discovered in the same coffin, a brass or 
copper helmet, with several implements of war, that were greatly 
corroded. There was also found in the neighbourhood "a nicely 
carved urn," full of reddish coloured ashes. The figure of the 
urn, however, is all that would lead us to refer this relic to the 
Romans, as cremation was not peculiar to that people, but prac- 
tised also by the British ; and it was the custom of both to inhume 
the urns of the dead, without any pious cairn to mark the place of 
their repose. 4. A few years ago, a Roman tripod, in a good 
state of preservation, was turned up by the plougli in the farm of 
Mid Kelton : it is now in the possession of Mr Train, Castle 
Douglas. 5. A Mummer's head mask, made of fine copper, rich- 
ly ornamented, and having two long horns turning backwards like 
those of a goat, was found in a morass in the farm of Torrs, about 
the year 1820. Masquerades were a favourite amusement of the 
nobility in the middle ages, and this mask had probably belonged 
to a Mummer of the neighbouring castle of Thrievo. It was pre- 



154 



KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE. 



sented to Sir Walter Scott by Mr Traiiij and is now a conspicu- 
ous object in the museum at Abbotsfurd. 6. Mr Train has also 
in his possession two interesting pieces of furniture; the one an 
antique bedstead or buistie of the black Earl of Douglas, who was 
assassinated by his sovereign in the castle of Stirling; the other, 
a beautiful cabinet of elaborately carved oak, formed out of the 
different pieces of an ornamented chimney-piece, the cutting of 
which was the amusement of twenty tedious years spent by Mr J. 
Gordon, a member of the Earlston family, in the dungeon of 
Blackness, where he was conjfined on account of his religion. 7. 
The Carhnwark loch has yielded up many antiquities. This beau- 
tiful sheet of water appears to have been an object of wonderful 
interest in ancient times. It once contained two large islands ; 
one near the north end, and the other near the south end of it. 
But great pains have evidently been taken to adorn it with artifi- 
cial islands, as there are two small ones that the writer of the Old 
Statistical Account says, " have evidently been formed by strong 
piles of wood driven into the moss or marl, on which were placed 
large frames of black oak." These were discovered in the year 
1765, when the loch was drained for the purpose of procuring 
marl. They had been immersed " fully six feet under water," — a 
fact which seems to prove that the original extent of the loch was 
not much greater than its present, these six feet of water being 
fully accounted for by two dams which were then also discovered. 
These must have been erected for the purpose of deepening the 
lake by shutting its two outlets towards the Dee. This idea seems 
to be confirmed by a tradition which has always prevailed in the 
parish, that there was a town which sunk, or was drowned, in the 
loch — probably a few houses partially submerged, and rendered 
uninhabitable by the confinement of the waters. Tradition says 
also, that there were two churches or chapels, one upon each of the 
large islands. On an islet near the north end of the loch, there 
was found a large iron mallet, or hammer, stained on one end with 
blood-rust. It is now in the possession of the Antiquarian Society 
of Edinburgh, and is supposed to have been an instrument used 
by the ancient Druids in killing their sacrifices. The dams refer- 
red to above had been strong works ; the one was discovered at 
the present outlet of the loch to the Dee, and was built of stone, 
moss, and clay ; the other was found near the town of Castle Dou- 
glas, at a point where, in very high floods, the loch and the river 

still meet. This work consisted of oak wood and earth. At this

place, which is now covered by the great miUtary road, the Roman 
army constructed a causeway through the marsh, which gave to 
Castle Douglas, in its infant days, the name of " Causeway-end," 
which towards the close of last century, was changed for " Carlin- 
wark." About this place many horse shoes were found sunk deep 
in the mud, of a form altogether different from those now in use. 
One of them is in the possession of Mr Train. It consists of one 
solid piece of iron, not made to go round the edge of the hoof, 
but to cover the whole foot. On the inside, especially towards 
the heel, it is hollowed so as not to press upon the soft part of the 
foot. No perforations for the nails are discoverable — they appear 
to be filled with rust. It somewhat resembles the balls or lumps 
of ice formed by horses feet in winter. Four such amorphous 
pieces of iron must have formed no small encumbrance to a horse ; 
for although a good deal worn in front, this shoe still weighs about 
six pounds. In several parts of the loch canoes were found, ex- 
actly similar to those discovered in Merton-mere, Lochar moss, 
and the Carron. They appear to have been hollowed out of one 
tree, by the action of fire, after the manner of the American In- 
dians. These are obviously Celtic remains of a very early date. 
Several very large stag heads, and a capacious brass pan were also 
found in the loch ; and near its south-west corner a Roman dag- 
ger 22 inches long, and plated with gold, was fished up in a bag of 
marl. It is in the possession of Mrs Colonel Gordon of Greenlaw. 

By the withdrawing of the water, one of the two large islands 

that to the north — was made a peninsula, but it still retains the 
name of " the Isle. " On the south, or Fir Isle, the remains of 
an iron forge may still be seen ; and it is said that Edward I. when 
he penetrated into Galloway in the year 1300, made use of this 
island as a place for shoeing his cavalry horses. Around this isle 
there has been a stone rampart, and a road led from it to the land 
on the north-east, which was formed of stones secured by strong 
piles of oak. Close to the side of the island, this road had a deep 
opening, in which large beams of wood, the remains of a draw- 
bridge, are still visible under the water. The road is now a marsh, 
having been destroyed by the action of the water ; and here we 
have an additional confirmation of what is stated above respecting 
the original depth and extent of the loch ; for with the six feet of 
water that were drained off in 1765, added to what the loch at 
present contains, the construction of these works would have been 
impracticable.

KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE. 



On the west side of the loch, between it and the pubhc road, 
there is still pointed out a small piece of rising ground, as the 
Gallows Slote, or pit into which the victims of the cruelty or re- 
venge of the Earls of Douglas were cast after being hanged on 
the gallows knob, a large block of granite projecting from the front 
wall of Thrieve Castle, immediately over the main gateway. 
There is a difficulty, however, in accounting for this charnel be- 
ing situated at the distance of more than a mile from the castle, 
while the carcasses could have been so much more readily dispos- 
ed of in the neighbouring marshes, or in the river that flowed un- 
der the very walls. Some, therefore, regard this piece of ground 
as the gallows slote, on the top of which, it is said, stood a gibbet, 
upon which those unhappy persons who incurred the displeasure 
of the Douglasses were executed. Be this as it may, the fact 
is indisputable, that this piece of ground was used, if not as 
a place of execution, at least as a receptacle for the bodies of 
criminals; for the popular tradition to this effect was strikingly 
corroborated in the year 1800, when, in making the present high- 
way, abundance of human bones were turned up in this spot. On 
this gallows, it is stated in the old Statistical Account, that Maclel- 
lan, tutor of Bombie, was executed by the command of Douglas, not- 
withstanding the King's letters demanding his release. This ac- 
count, however, differs from that which is given by the best authors, 
as Pinkerton, Hume of Godscroft, Balfour, Buchanan, Hume, 
Scott, and Tytler, who all agree that Maclellan was beheaded in 
the court of Thrieve Castle, — a grim and frowning stronghold 
that stands on an island surrounded by the Dee, about a mile from 
the high road, from which it is visible. The same writer states, 
that " The remains of Raeberry Maclellan lie buried in the 
church of Kirkcormock, as appears from the inscription upon a 
gravestone there." But Crawford, in his Peerage, says, that " Sir 
Patrick Maclellan was interred in the abbey church of Dundren- 
nan, under a monument of freestone." This account is the more 
probable, as Dundrennan was the family burying-place of the 
Maclellans, and not far from their castle of Raeberry. The in- 
scription upon the stone in the church of Kirkcormock is in old 
Runic characters, now hardly legible. Enough, however, has been 
made out to show, that it was erected to perpetuate the memory of 
a young man of the same name, who died upwards of eighty years 
after the murder of the tutor of Bombie. It is, " Honorabilis Pa- 
tricius Maclellan qui obit anno m.dxxxiv. annq xviii abatis." 



KELTON. 



157 



Raebevry was beheaded in 1451. The stone in question is easily 
accounted for, when it is stated that the clan of the Maclellans 
became so numerous and respectable, that fourteen knights of the 
name are said to have existed in Galloway at one time, and that 
the ruins of a castle which belonged to a branch of the family are 
still to be seen within three miles of Kirkcormock. The family 
are considered to have been of Irish origin, and were probably in- 
strumental in erecting this church. Their castle appears to have 
been a place of considerable importance. The ruins are exten- 
sive, and some of the vaults are yet entire, and are used as sheds 
for cattle. It was situated on the farm of Auchlane, to which it 
has transmitted its own name. It was surrounded with a wide and 
deep ditch, which was supplied with water from the burn that now 
flows past the north side of the ruins. 

There are several beautiful moats in the parish. 

Mons Meg. — Although this parish is forced to relinquish the 
honour of having furnished Raeberry with a grave, it seems to have 
a good claim to the honour of having contributed the means of de- 
molishing the castle of his murderer. When the act of forfeiture 
against the Douglasses was passed by the Scottish Parliament in 
the year 1455, the Castle of Thrieve was the last stronghold that 
held out for that powerful and rebellious family. King James II. 
resolved to conduct the siege of this place in person. He there- 
fore marched into Galloway at the head of a numerous army, and 
took up a position at " the Three Thorns of the Carlinwark," 
near the place where the town of Castle Douglas now stands. 
Among the multifarious assemblage who came from all parts of 
the country to witness the warlike operations, there was a black- 
smith of the name of M'Kim, or M'Min, and his sons. Observ- 
ing that the royal artillery produced little effect upon the thick 
and strong walls of Thrieve, old M'Kim remarked to one of the 
officers, that a larger cannon should be procured ; and, after ex- 
amining the way in which the guns had been manufactured, he 
offered, if furnished with the proper materials, to construct a 
more efficient piece of ordnance. The king gladly accepted 
his proposal ; and the principal inhabitants of Kirkcudbright, 
to avenge the death of their superior, the tutor of Bombie, 
liberate the country from the tyranny of the Douglasses, and 



' One of these thorns still remains — a knotty, gnarlod, fluted, hoary, and interest- 
ing relic of antiquity, which it is desirable that soinc means were enn loyed to pre- 
serve f I Oin the decay that has long since preyed upon the other two.

evince their loyalty to their sovereign, having contributed each a 
ijaud, or bar, of iron, brawny M'Kim and his sons were set to 
work, and soon produced the famous cannon, known by the name 
of Mons Meg. The manufacture of this extraordinary piece of 
ordnance was carried on at Buchan's Croff, in the immediate vi- 
cinity of the three Thorns of the Carlinwark, where the king had 
encamped. It is composed of a number of separate bars held 
firmly together by strong hoops of iron, in the form of a cask. 
Its calibre is inches. With immense difficulty, this prodi- 
gious cannon, which weighs six tons and a-half, was dragged to 
a "commanding position, since called Knockcannon, right in front 
of Thrieve Castle, The charge, it is said, consisted of a peck of 
powder, and a granite ball, the weight of a Carsphairn cow. It 
was discharged with such effect that the first shot produced the 
greatest consternation among the inmates of the castle, and the 
second went through the thick walls and carried away the right 
hand of the countess, the celebrated Fair Maid of Galloway, — as 
she sat at table within the banqueting-hall, and was about to 
raise the wine-cup to her lips, — a circumstance regarded by the 
people in the country as a direct manifestation of the vengeance 
of Heaven, because that hand had been given in wedlock to two 
brothers, and that whilst the lawful spouse of one of them was still 
alive. The garrison immediately surrendered ; and the grateful 
monarch presented to M'Kim the forfeited lands of Mollance, 
as a reward for the service he had rendered his country by con- 
structing so noble an engine of war. According to the custom of 
Galloway, where persons are generally called by the names of the 
lands they possess, M'Kim soon came to be known by the soubri- 
quet Mollance. The cannon was named after him, with the ad- 
dition of Meg, in compliment to his wife, whose voice, it is said, 
rivalled that of her namesake. Thus the original name of the 
gun was Mollance Meg, which, in course of time, was contracted 
into Mons Meg. Drummond of Hawthornden is the first author 
who uses this contraction, " sicuti Mons Megga crackasset," — 
which has led people unacquainted with the history of Galloway 
erroneously to suppose that this famous cannon was forged at Mons 
in Flanders. But no proof whatever has yet been adduced to 
that effect, whereas there is very conclusive evidence of its having 
been constructed in Galloway. The ball which made the can- 
non hole in the wall of Thrieve Castle as well as those which 
are shewn in the Castle of Edinburgh, as pertaining to Mons 



KELTON. 



159 



Meo-, are of Galloway granite, to which there is none exactly si- 
milar in Scotland ; and tradition says they were made on the sum- 
mit of Bennan hill, while M'Kim and his sons were employed in 
constructing- the cannon at the Buchan croft. Two of these balls 
only are said to have been discharged at the siege, and of both a 
satisfactory account can be given. The first,— that which shook 
the castle and spread dismay among the garrison, was, towards 
the end of last century, picked out of the wall and delivered to 
Mr Gordon of Greenlaw. And in the year 1841, when the ten- 
ant of the Isle of Thrieve was removing, for the purpose of tur- 
nip-husbandry, a large accumulation of rubbish from the lower part 
of the castle, he came upon the draw-well, which was found to be 
lined with strong planks of black oak in a state of perfect preser- 
Tation. Prosecuting the search which this discovery provoked, 
the labourers at length came to an immense round ball, which, on 
examination, was found to be a bullet in all respects the same as 
those belonging to Mons Meg, and still retaining evident marks 
of having been discharged from a cannon. It lay in the direct 
line from Knock-cannon to the breach in the wall ; so that there 
is every reason to believe that this was the identical missile that 
shattered the stronghold and mutilated the lady of the tremendous 
Lord of Galloway. A massive gold ring, inscribed, " Mar- 
garet de Douglas," supposed to have been on the Fair Maid 
of Galloway's hand when it was blown away at the siege, was 
discovered by one of the workmen employed to clear out 
some rubbish, when Thrieve Castle was partially repaired, in 
the beginning of the present century, as a barrack for French 
prisoners. The ring was handed to Sir Alexander Gordon, 
sheriff of the county. Symson says, that " the common re- 
port also goes in that country, that in the isle of the Thrieve, the 
great iron gun in the Castle of Edinburgh, commonly called 
Mount Megg, was wrought and made," — which statement, writ- 
ten nearly a hundred and sixty years ago, though obviously incor- 
rect in assigning the Isle of Thrieve as Meg's birth-place, goes far 
to prove her a native of Galloway. Finally, the uninterrupted 
tradition which has prevailed on this subject in the country, receiv- 
ed a strong confirmation, when the labourers who were engaged 
in making the great military road at Carlinwark, at the very spot 
where Mons Meg is said to have been manufactured, came to a 
large mound, which turned out to be a mass of ashes or cinders, 
such as are generally left from a forge.

The unexampled popularity of Mons Meg may perhaps justify 
the following brief outline of her subsequent history and travels. 
From the following entry in the Treasurer's books, she appears 
to have been carried by James IV., July 10, 1489, to the siege 
of Dumbarton, — " Item, to the gunners to drink-silver when they 
carit Mons, by the King's command, I8s." Mons, however, 
from her enormous size and weight, proved exceedingly unmanage- 
able ; and after having been brought back from Dumbarton to 
Edinburgh, she enjoyed an interval of eight years' inglorious re- 
pose. When James, however, in 1497, sat down before Nor- 
ham, the great gun was, with infinite labour and expense, convey- 
ed to the siege, and some of the items regarding her transport are 
amusing. The construction of a new cradle or carriage for her 
seems to have been a work of great labour. Thus on July 24, 
1497, we have " Item, to pyanaris to here ye trees to be Men's new 
cradill to her at St Leonards, quhare scho lay, iiish. vid. and 
again, July 28, " Item, for xiii stane of irne to mak graith to 
Monsis new cradill, and geolokkis to ga with her, xxxsh. iiiid." 
" Item, to vii wrightis for twa dayis and a half ya maid Monsis 
cradill, xxiiish. iiid." " Item, for xyiiii li of talloun tallow to 
Mons." " Item, for viii elne of canvas to be Monsis claiths to 
cover her." " Item, for mare talloun to Mons." " Item, to Sir 
Thomas Galbraith for paynting Monsis claiths, xiiiish." " Item, 
to the minstralis that playit before Mons doune the gait, xiiiish." 

The next occasion of Meg's making a noise in the world, was 
in 1548, at the nuptials of Queen Mary and the Dauphin of 
France, when the following entry occurs, — " certain pyanaris for 
their labouris in raising Monss out of her lair, and for finding and 
carrying her bullet after she was shot frae Waldie Muir back to 
the castle of Edinburgh, a distance of two miles, 10s." On the 
19Lh December 1650, when the Castle of Edinburgh capitulated 
to the parliamentary troops, in the list of ordnance delivered by 
the governor to Colonel Moncke is specially mentioned " The 
great iron murderer, called Muckle Megg." 

In 1682, in firing a salute in honour of James, Duke of York, 
Meg unfortunately sustained some damage, in having part of the 
iron hoop next the touch-hole blown away. The disaster is thus 
referred to by Robert Fergusson : 

" Oh Willciwins  Mons Meg for you, 
'Twas fil ing cracked thy imickle mou." 

To the great grief of the inhabitants of Edinburgh, this gigan- 



KELTON. 



161 



tic piece of ordnance was, on the 19th April 1754, removed from 
Edinburgh Castle to Leith, on its way to the Tower of London. 
Her loss is thus again recorded by the same poet, — 

" Right seldom am I gi'en to bannin, 
But by my soul she was a cannon, _ 
Could hit a man had he been stannin 

In shire of Fife ; 
SaK lang Scots miles ayont Clackmannin, 

An' tack his life." 

When King George IV. visited Edinburgh Castle, on 22d 
August 1822, Sir Walter Scott pointed out to him the spot on the 
chief bastion of the old fortress, formerly occupied by Mons Meg, 
and earnestly requested that she might again be placed there, to 
which his Majesty readily assented. But through petty obstacles, 
stated by the official guardians of Meg, that object was not effect- 
ed for nearly seven years afterwards. 

" On 9th March 1829, she was, however, brought in so- 
lemn procession, to re-occupy her ancient site on the Argyle bat- 
tery, escorted by the 73d Regiment, a detachment of artillery-men, 
and two troops of dragoons, with thirty gentlemen, in full Highland 
costume, at the head of whom was Sir Walter Scott, accompanied 
by the greater part of the inhabitants of Edinburgh. 

Modern Buildings. — The principal modern buildings in this pa- 
rish are, Gelston Castle, built by the late Sir William Douglas, 
Bart., now the residence of his niece, Mrs Maitland ; the Carlin- 
wark, built by the late Mr M'Culloch, and belonging at present 
to Mr David Hannay ; and Daldawn, built by the late proprie- 
tor. Captain M'Dougall. The St John's Lodge of Free Masons 
have a large hall in Castle Douglas. 

There are three mills in this parish for grinding corn, and one 
bone-mill. 

ni. — Population. 
Few parishes in Scotland exhibit so rapid an increase of popu- 
lation as Kelton. In the year 1755, it was only 81 1, and in 1791, 
it amounted to 1600.

There are in the whole parish 636 families, being an average 
of about. 4J to each family. ° 

Of the present population, there reside in the town of Castle Douglas, - 1848

Total, - 2875 

The population consists generally of bankers, writers, medical 
men, shop- keepers, cabinet-makers, masons, joiners, blacksmiths, 
painters, upholsterers, inn-keepers, tailors, shoemakers, weavers, 
and labourers. As nearly as can be ascertained, the yearly ave- 
rage of marriages is 20 ; of births, 65 ; and of deaths, 35. 

The number of resident proprietors of the yearly value of 
L.50 and upwards, is 4. The number of blind persons is 2 ; of 
insane, 1 ; and of fatuous, 1. 

Language.— Yev good English is spoken by the people in ge- 
neral. The peculiarities noticed by Symson, of their omitting 
the letter h after t, as in pronouncing ting for thing; of their con- 
verting V into w, as, serwant for servant, §"0., no longer exist. 
The epithet bask is very generally applied to the dry withering 
easterly winds that sometimes prevail in spring. Although a few 
provincialisms, and a slight patois may occasionally be recognized, 
yet the language is decidedly improving, both in purity and cor- 
rectness of pronunciation. 

Character and Habits of the People.-— The people are characte- 
rized by caution, shrewdness, and an inquisitive turn of mind. 
Though a good many lead an irreligious life, yet the inhabitants 
are generally distinguished for their industry, sobriety, and regard 
to the outward ordinances of religion. The peasantry are frugal, 
and cleanly in their habits; enjoy, in a reasonable degree, the 
comforts and advantages of society, and seem cheerful and con- 
tented with their condition and circumstances. Their ordinary 
food consists of oatmeal made into cakes and porridge, with milk 
for breakfast and supper, and a dinner of barley broth with beef 
or mutton and potatoes. They are simple in their tastes, civil to 
their superiors, and proverbial for their hospitality. Their fa- 
vourite games are quoits and curling, in both of which they excel, 
standing at present in the proud position of conquerors in both 
games, of all the neighbouring parishes with which they are in 
the habit of playing an annual match. In winter, the Carlinwark 
Loch presents an ample field for the lovers of the latter national

and healthful amusement. These games, however, are not un- 
attended with danger. In some places the lake is very deep, and 
the surface being constantly agitated in particular parts by cur- 
rents of wind, and the hundreds of water-fowl that frequent its 
shores, there are generally some small spots left open after the 
rest is frozen over. These being covered by a single night's in- 
tense frost, as is sometimes the case, are apt to deceive the un- 
warv. In this way a boy was drowned in the winter of 1839-40. 
Cards, backgammon, draughts, and chess are known, but not ex- 
tensively practised in the parish. Poaching is not common, though 
one or two lawless young men have been several times incarce- 
rated for violating the game laws. Smuggling is unknown. 

IV. — Industry. 

There are in the parish about 40 farmers, 43 cottars, and 45 
farm-servants, living in their masters' houses. A considerable 
number of labourers, probably to the amount of 80, reside in 
Castle-Douglas, and the villages of Rhonehouse and Gelston, 
who, along with their families, and a part of the female population 
also, are generally employed in agriculture. Farm-servants re- 
ceive as wages from L.IO to L.12 per annum; female servants, 
from L.5 to L.6 ; masons, 3s., and carpenters 2s. 6d. per day. 

There are about 40 males employed in retail trade, and, in- 
cluding masters and workmen, 180 in handicraft. There are 3 
bankers and 7 assistants, 10 writers, and 4 physiciansandsurgeons. 

AgricuUure. — This parish contains 2721 imperial acres annu- 
ally under cultivation. About 1327 acres have never been sub- 
jected to the plough, and could not, by any profitable application 
of capital, be reclaimed. Cultivation, indeed, has nearly reached 
its limit. There are about 570 acres in plantation. The woods 
generally consist of the Scotch fir, larch, spruce, elm, ash, and 
oak. Most of the plantations are young, but take kindly to the 
soil, and grow rapidly. Great care is taken, by yearly thinning 
and pruning, to promote the growth of the trees. 

This parish owes much to Sir William Douglas, for the pains 
he took to adorn with plantations the estate of Gelston ; to the 
late .proprietor, Mr Maitland, for improving upon the plans of 
his predecessor ; to Colonel Maxwell, for his extensive plantations 
upon the farms of Potterland and Glen Yerroch, which entitle 
this part of the parish to the designation of the Irosachs of Gal- 
loway ; and to James Barbour, Esq. of Dunmuir, for the tasteful 
manner in which he has beautified the estate of Keltonhill.

The vnlued rent of the parish is L.3598 ; its real rent is 
L.7972 ; but, as assessed for the poor, where house property is 
included, it is about L. 11,000. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of arable land per acre is 
L. 1, 3s. The average rent of grazing is at the rate of L.6 per 
cow; L. 2, 10s. per head for black-cattle; and L. 1 per ewe or 
full-grown sheep pastured for the year. 

The lands are let on leases of fifteen and nineteen years dura- 
tion. The farm-houses are all slated, comfortable, and commo- 
dious, generally containing, besides a kitchen and accommodation 
for servants, a dining-room, parlour, and two or more bed-rooms. 
The lands are all enclosed, either by substantial stone-dikes, or 
by thorn hedges, planted in a manner peculiar to Galloway. It is 
this : — A wall is built against a bank of earth, and when it has at- 
tained the height of the soil, a row of thorns is inserted, bent for- 
wards, and covered with a little mould, when the building proceeds 
to the proper height. The thorns soon take root, creep up the 
face of the wall, and, by proper attention, combine with the dike 
to form a fence impervious to all kinds of cattle. Sometimes two 
rows of thorns are inserted, one at the base of the wall, and an- 
other at a small distance above. This hides altogether the de- 
formity of the naked dike ; and, whilst the thorns keep the stones 
in their proper places, the wall gives a stability to the hedge 
which bids defiance to the most violent storms. This mode of 
fencing is said to have been introduced by the late Lord Daer, 
with the view of turning the Galloway cattle, which are sure to 
trespass upon every field into which they are able to poke their 
heads,— and it fully answered the purpose. The hedges are care- 
fully scutched, and give a great appearance of neatness to the 
country. It is Httle more than a century since lands begun to be 
enclosed in Galloway. In a letter to W. M. Herries, Esq. of 
Spottes, dated February 1811, and published in the Appendix to 
the Report of the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright Agricultural So- 
ciety for the year 1810, the late John Maxwell, Esq. of 
Munshes, gives the following somewhat ludicrous account of 
the famous rising of the Levellers, occasioned by the pro- 
prietors enclosing their grounds. " That same year 1723, 
for this fine old old gentleman was born in 1720, many of 
the proprietors inclosed their grounds to stock them with black- 
cattle, and by that means turned out a vast number of the 
tenants, at the term of Whitsunday 1723, whereby numbers of

them became destitute ; and, in consequence, rose m a mob ; when, 
with pitchforks, gavellocks, and spades, they levelled the park dikes 
of Barncailzie and Munches, which I saw with my own eyes. The 
mob passed by Dalbeaty and Buittle, and did the same on the 
estates of Netherlaw, Dunrod, &amp;c. and the lands of the Laird ot 
Murdoch, then proprietor of Kilwhanedy, who turned out sixteen 
families at that time. The proprietors rose, with their servants 
and dependants, to quell this mob ; but were not of sufficient force 
to do it, and were obliged to send for two troops of dragoons from 
Edinburgh, who, upon their appearing, the mob dispersed." Before 
the arrival of the military, however, the Levellers had Very effec- 
tually done their work, the only dike that was left standing in the 
Stewartry being one on the right hand side of the old road from 
Castle- Douglas to Kirkcudbright, upon the estate of Kelton. 
The' proprietor used more effectual weapons to preserve his fence 
than the swords of the dragoons. Having awaited the arrival of 
the Levellers, he accosted them courteously, and invited them, be- 
fore commencing their labours, to refresh themselves from a good 
cask of spirits, and another of ale, which he had prepared for 
them. They drank his ale, and spared his dike. 

The present race of farmers are an intelligent and enterprising 
clas&amp; of men. Their farms are skilfully managed, all the most 
approved modes of agriculture and improving stock being in gene- 
ral use ; but a great obstacle to their improvements is the difficulty 
of procuring lime, which must be shipped from the opposite coast 
of England. Bone manure is much used in turnip husbandry ; 
and draining, both with tiles and stones, is practised to a conside- 
rable extent, and with the greatest success. 

A great impulse was given to agriculture by the discovery of 
the beds of marl in the Carlinwark Loch, about the year 1765. 
Crops of the greatest luxuriance were produced by the use of this 
calcareous manure, and it soon came to be eagerly sought after, 
and extensively applied. Ignorant, however, of its tendency to 
exhaust as well as stimulate the soil, the farmers injured their lands 
by cropping them for many seasons in succession ; and this natural 
effect of an injudicious and excessive use of the marl was referred 
to the manure itself, and for many years it has ceased to be ap- 
plied. The common rotation is now a white and a green crop al- 
ternately, till the fifth year, when the lands are laid doMi in grass. 

Nothing can be more striking than the contrast between the 
present system of agriculture, and that described by Symson, who 



166 



KIUKCUDBRIGHTSHIUE. 



tells US, that, " in several parts of the Stewartrie, they till with 
four horses, all abreast, and bound together to a small tree before, 
which a boy or sometimes a woman leads, going backward. In the 
meantime another stronger man hath a strong stick, about four 
feet loner, with an iron hook at the lowest end thereof, with which, 
being put into another iron fastened to the end of the plough- 
beam, and leaning upon the upper end of the stick, and guiding it 
■with his hands, he holds the plough-beame up or down, according 
as he finds the ground deep or shallow." From this miserable and 
expensive mode of tillage the usual return was four or five for 
one ; and the grain was of the most execrable description, as we 
learn from the same source, for, he continues, " before they carry 
the corneto the mill, after it is dry'd in the kiln, they lay it upon the 
kiln-flour, in a circular bed, about a foot thick ; then, being bare- 
foot, they go among it, rubbing it with their feet, this they call lome- 
ing of the corne, and by this meanes the long beards, or awnds, 
are separated from the corne, and the corn made, as they term it, 
more snod, and easy to pass through the mill, when they are shell- 
ing of the corne there." And, after all their lomeing, he adds, 
" Although their measure be heaped, and the weakest and worst 
of their oates, which they reserve for their horses and seed, be 
winnowed and drawn out, yet three bolls of corne will not yield 
much more than one boll of good and sufficient meal, straked 
measure." But now the ploughman of Galloway, with his im- 
proved implements, and single team of strong and handsome 
horses, will stand a comparison, in point of appearance and dex- 
terity, with any of his class in the country. The crops, too, are re- 
markably good ; ten for one is not looked upon as an extraordinary 
return ; and for every bushel of oats sent to the mill, the farmer 
expects at least a stone and a half of meal. It is pleasant to add, 
that their personal comfort has improved in the same ratio. No 
peasant would now be proud of what satisfied the proprietor a cen- 
tury ago, when, as Mr Maxwell, in the letter already referred to, 
tells us, " The tenants, in general, lived very meanly on kail, 
groats, milk, graddon ground in querns, turned by the hand, and 
the grain dried in a pot, together with a crock ewe now and then 
about Martinmas. They were clothed very plainly, and their habi- 
tations were most uncomfortable. Their general wear was of cloth, 
made of waulked plaiding, black and white wool, mixed very coarse, 
and the cloth rarely dyed. Their hose were made of white plaid- 
ing cloth, sewed together, with single-soled shoes, and a black or

blue bonnet, none having hats but the lairds,-who thought them 
selves very well dressed for going to church on Sunday with a 
black kelt-coat of their wife's making." 

Produce.— The gross amount of raw produce annually raised in 
the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows, viz. 

1343 acres of corn, yielding 36 bushels per acre, at 2s 6d. per bushel, L.6943 10 0 

268 acres of potatoes, yielding 18 bolls per acre, at 12s. per boll, /»y o "

This table, which has been prepared with very great care, fur- 
nishes as nearly as possible an exact account of the stock and crops 
for the year 1841, — and may be regarded as a fair average of 
the amount of raw produce annually raised in the parish of Kelton. 
There are 270 horses in the parish. 

Agricultural Society. — There is a district society, comprehend- 
ing Kelton and the five surrounding parishes, whose object is to 
promote the improvement of agriculture and stock of all kinds. 
Each member pays an annual subscription of half a guinea. Out 
of the funds thus realized handsome premiums are awarded to the 
best ploughmen, and to the owners of the best stock in the dis- 
trict. The ploughing-matches are held in each of the six parishes 
alternately ; the show of stock takes place in Castle Douglas on 
the first Tuesday in October. The influence of this society, 
aided by the countenance and support of the Highland Society of 
Scotland, is very considerable in promoting the object of its in- 
stitution. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market- Town. — The market- town is Castle Douglas. This 
town, being situated near the centre of the county, is the great 
mart for the produce of the stewartry. A weekly market, at 
which an astonishing amount of business is transacted, is held 
every Monday for the sale of black cattle, sheep, pork, and all 
kinds of agricultural produce. The extraordinary rapidity with 
which Castle Douglas has sprung into commercial importance is 
sufficient to account for the great increase of the population of this 
parish during the last half century ; whilst the circumstance of its

not having gone on in the same ratio, but having actually decreased 
since 1831, is accounted for by the failure of a cotton manufac- 
tory formerly carried on in Castle Douglas. This work was esta- 
blished by Sir William Douglas, as a means of increasing the 
town, of which he was the superior, and may almost be said to 
have been the founder. The introduction of the power-loom, 
however, rendered it impossible to carry on with advantage such 
a trade in places like Castle Douglas, where there is neither 
coal nor a sufficient power of water, and it has consequently been 
abandoned. The town has nevertheless thriven beyond the ex- 
pectation of its patron. Men are yet living who remember the 
time when Causeioay-end was only a small cluster of cottages, the 
population of which did not amount to more than twenty. Now, 
Castle Douglas is a handsome modern town, built upon a re- 
gular plan, containing a population of 1848. It is situate upon 
a gentle declivity, at the bottom of which is the Carlinwark Loch. 
The streets are wide and spacious, crossing one another at right 
angles. The town is thus divided into rectangles, the internal 
space in each division being laid out in gardens, one of which is 
attached to every feu. This town, the suddenness of whose rise 
rivals the rapid growth of towns in America, has already attained 
an importance that, in most cases, is the growth of ages. In an 
agricultural point of view, it far surpasses any other town in Gal- 
loway ; and, with the exception of Dumfries, it is second to 
none in the south of Scotland. It possesses many natural ad- 
vantages. It is situated in the centre of the county, and the 
great road from Dumfries to Kirkcudbright and Portpatrick passes 
through the heart of it. At the instance of Sir William Dou- 
glas, it was erected into a burgh of barony under its present title, 
by royal charter in 1792. Till then it had been called Carlin- 
wark, and in remoter times, Causeway-end. By the charter of 
erection, the burgh was governed by a bailie and six councillors, 
who were chosen from among the resident burgesses, and continu- 
ed in office three years. A new and extended charter was obtain- 
ed in 1829, by which the burgesses were invested with the privi- 
lege of electing triennially, on the first Wednesday of September, 
a provost, two bailies, and seven councillors — the qualification be- 
ing residence within the burgh, and a right by feu to a piece of 
ground within the same. The property of the burgh amounts to 
L.550 ; the debts to L.150. The average annual revenue is L.20 ; 
the expenditure L.15. Justice of peace small debt courts are held 



KELTON. 



169 



on the first Monday of every month.. The steward cn-cuit courts, 
under the late Small Debt Act, are held on the second Wednes- 
days of January and April, and the first Wednesdays of July and 
October. There is a modern town-house, with a tower and 
clock, which were presented to the burgh by Sir W. Douglas. 
The shops are remarkably elegant and well furnished, so as to 
awaken the surprise of strangers, who are not aware of the fact 
that Cxistle Douglas is the great mart, not only of the parish of 
Kelton, but of the whole stewartry. 

Banks.— Three of the most respectable banks in Scotland have 
branches in Castle Douglas ; the British Linen Company, esta- 
blished in 1821; the National Bank, established in 18'26 ; and 
the Bank of Scotland, established in 1840. All the three insti- 
tutions do business to a considerable extent, and afford great en- 
couragement to industry and commerce. 

Post-Office.— The post-office of Castle Douglas is perhaps one 
of the most important in the south of Scotland, whether we con- 
sider the consequence of the town itself, or the extent of country, 
and number of villages around it, and subject to its delivery. 
There are no less than fourteen post-offices under Castle Douglas, 
viz. sub-office. New Galloway ; penny post-offices, Auchencairn, 
Kirkpatrick, Dairy, Laurieston, Crocketford, Dalbeattie, Palnac- 
kie, Parton, Rhonehouse ; receiving-houses, Gelston, Crossmi- 
chael, Haugh of Urr, and Glenlochar,— to all of which places 
there are daily runners. Castle Douglas, in regard to the num- 
ber of its sub-offices, &amp;c. is second to Glasgow alone throughout 
Scotland. The revenue, prior to the establishment of the penny 
postage, exceeded L.llOO; but what it yields now cannot be ex- 
actly ascertained from the stamps being sold both at the post and 
stamp- offices. 

Means of Communication. — 1. The mail from Dumfries bring- 
ing dispatches from all England and Scotland, arrives at Castle 
Douglas daily at 10 o'clock p. m. Another mail from Portpa- 
trick with the Irish letters, arrives at 3 o'clock a. m. 2. There 
are also two coaches every lawful day to and from Dumfries and 
Kirkcudbright, one of which brings a second mail from England and 
the whole of Scotland except Edinburgh and its neighbourhood, at 
one o'clock p. m, 3. Carriers go twice a week to Dumfries, once 
to Edinburgh, once to Glasgow, and thrice to Kirkcudbright and 
Gatehouse. 

Roads. — The great military road from London to Portpatrick 



170 



KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE. 



passes through the north part of the parish for nearly four miles. 
The road from Castle Douglas to Palnackie, a sea-port on the 
mouth of the river Urr, from which coal, wood, slate, lime, bone 
manure, &amp;c. are brought, passes along the east border of the pa- 
rish for five miles. The old road from Dumfries to Kirkcud- 
bright by Castle Douglas and Rhonehouse, and another by Dal- 
beattie, pass through Kelton, the former from north to south about 
five miles, the latter from north-east to south-west about three 
and a half miles. There are also two other roads which in- 
tersect the parish ; one from Castle Douglas through Rhonehouse, 
and the very centre of the parish to Greenlane, on the line from 
Dumfries to Kirkcudbright by Dalbeattie, and another from Castle 
Douglas by Kelton Kirk to the village of Auchencairn in the pa- 
rish of Rerwick. All these roads are kept in excellent repair, the 
metal of the parish, whether the hard primary schistus, or the por- 
phyry, being admirably adapted for road making. The roads are 
Macadamized, and a little elevated in the centre ; and the water- 
tables being kept clean, the rain speedily runs off, or is absorbed 
by the porous soil. 

Bridges. — A very handsome bridge, consisting of three arches, 
was built across the river Dee in the year 1825. It is composed 
of granite, and unites the parishes of Kelton and Balmaghie. Be- 
low it about 200 yards, stands the old bridge consisting of four 
arches, from its venerable appearance, and still more from its 
narrow path-way, presenting a striking contrast to its modern 
neighbour. 

Ecclesiastical State. — Kelton is composed of the three united 
parishes of Kelton, Gelston, and Kirkcormack. At each of the 
two last mentioned places, there exist the remains of a church, 
with its adjoining cemetery, which is still occasionally used by the 
families in the neighbourhood, and the descendants of those whose 
ashes are there deposited. There is also on the south-east 
boundary of the parish the vestige of an ancient chapel and 
church-yard, called Kirkmirren, now entirely neglected, and of 
which nothing is known but the locality and the name. In ancient 
times, it probably formed a distinct parish, though it is said to have 
been designed for a chapel of ease. The local situation of Gel- 
ston countenances the opinion of those who refer the name to gill 
or gell a ravine through which runs a brook, and the common af- 
fix tun, but its ancient name appears to have been Galston, Gauls- 
ton, or, as in the grant of land to James Boyd by David II. 



KELTON.

« Gaulistown " which lands John Gauliston had forfeited. Kirk- 
cormack, anciently called Kilcormac, derived its name from the 
Irish saint, Cormac, to whom it was dedicated. This dedication 
was, no doubt, made during the ninth century, after the Irish 
emio-rants began to find repose in Galloway. Symson says, that 
" Kirkcormack is only a chapel, and not, as it would seem, a com- 
plete parish, though ordinarily so called." He probably means 
Kirkmirren, for Kirkcormack appears from ancient records, to have 
had all the attributes of a complete parish. It is beautifully situat- 
ed in a retired spot, on the bank of the river Dee, and seems to 
have been the burying-place of the Maclellans of Auchlane, a 
branch of the noble family of Kirkcudbright. In ancient times 
all these churches belonged to the monks of Icolmkill. When 
their establishment became ruined by the successive devastations 
of the northmen, Kelton, and, indeed, all the churches in Gallo- 
way, which belonged to these monks, were granted between the 
years 1172 and 1180, by William the Lion, to the monastery of 
Holyrood. This establishment also being dissolved by the Reforma- 
tion, Charles I. in 1633, granted to the newly erected bishoprick 
of Edinburgh, along with many others which had belonged to the 
monastery of Holyrood, the churches of Kelton and Kirkcormack. 
On the abolition of Episcopacy in 1689, the patronages of these 
churches reverted to the Crown. Gelston belonged of old to the 
prior and canons of Whithern. After the Reformation, it was, by 
the general annexation act of 1587, vested in the King, who 
granted the whole property of Whithern priory, including the 
church of Gelston, to the Bishop of Galloway in 1606. When 
Episcopacy was finally abolished in 1689, the patronage of this 
church also reverted to the crown, which is still sole patron of the 
united parishes of Kelton, Gelston, and Kirkcormack. The pre- 
cise date of the union of these parishes cannot now be ascertained. 
It probably took place soon after the Reformation ; at least the 
churches of Gelston and Kirkcormack were both in ruins when 
Symson wrote his description of Galloway in 1684. 

Castle Douglas, alternately with the county town, is the seat 
of the Presbytery of Kircudbright. The parish church is situated 
on the east side of Kelton hill, at nearly equal distances from Cas- 
tle Douglas, Rhonehouse, and Gelston. Its distance from the 
extremities of the parish is about five miles. But although the 
situation of the church, considering the state of the parish when 
it was built, was well chosen ; yet its distance of a mile and a

quarter from Castle Douglas, where so largo a proportion as two- 
thirds of the whole population reside, is a source of great incon- 
venience. The present church was built in the year 1805-6, 
when it was, removed from a low situation in the middle of the 
church-yard, to its present elevated, dry, and convenient site. It 
is a plain, substantial building, of a rectangular form, 68 feet long 
and 42 feet broad within the walls, and has a belfry on the west 
gable. Any small repairs that had become necessary were adhibited 
in the year 1840, and it is at present in very good order. It was 
originally seated for about 740. No distinct provision, however, 
was made for the accommodation of the feuars of Castle Douglas, 
Rhonehouse, and Gelston ; and as the sittings which they were able 
to procure in the parts allocated to the heritors, and not occupied 
by themselves or their tenants, were found to be quite inadequate, 
in the year 1821, a gallery capable of accommodating 130 sitters 
was erected by subscription, in the east end of the church. The 
sittings were exposed to auction, and were taken with such avidity 
as led to the erection of a corresponding gallery in the west end 
of the church in the year 1822. The sittings in this gallery also 
were immediately taken, and at such prices as in a few years paid 
off the whole expenses incurred in these erections, with interest upon 
the money subscribed, when the shareholders agreed to devote the 
annual sum arising from this source to the promotion of the interests 
of education in the parish. It has been accordingly since divided 
among the three parochial teachers in the following proportions, 
one-half to the teacher in Castle Douglas, and one-fourth to each 
of the schoolmasters in Rhonehouse and Gelston. The church 
is thus capable of accommodating easily 1000 sitters. The two 
areas, however, having no fixed seats but moveable forms, are used 
only at the dispensation of the Lord's supper. They accommodate 
from 60 to 70 communicants. None of the sittings are absolute- 
ly free, except the forms in the area, which, being very uncom- 
fortable, are seldom used. But several pews belong to the kirk- 
session, in which the sittings are let at very low prices, as Is. and 
Is. 6d. each. Any person who is unable to pay this small rent, is, 
on applying to the session, accommodated with a free sitting. 
About ten sittings are occupied in this way. It would obviously 
be very desirable that a new church should be built in Castle 
Douglas, and that burgh erected into a separate parish. This 
new parish would contain upwards of 1800, and leave in the old 
parish about 1000 souls.

The manse and offices were built in the year 1813-14. No 
extensive repairs have yet been required; but such as had become 
necessary were executed in the end of the year 1840. It is a sub- 
stantial and comfortable house, containing the usual accommodation. 
The glebe consists of 17 imperial acres, exclusive of the garden 
and site of the manse and offices. The land is of good quality, 
and might be let for nearly L.2 per acre. The present stipend is 
17 chalders, half meal and half barley, with L.IO for communion 
elements. 

The Reformed Presbyterians have a meeting-house in Castle 
Douglas. The minister's stipend is L.90, and is raised from the 
seat rents and collections. The Relief body of Dissenters have 
also a meeting-house in the immediate neighbourhood of Castle 
Douglas, but within the parish of Grossmichael. The minister's 
stipend is nominally L.60, and is raised from the same sources. 
Neither of the clergymen has any manse. 

The parish church is generally well attended, although- an un- 
favourable day, owing to the distance of the church from Castle 
Douglas, where the great bulk of the people reside, very seriously 
affects the attendance. All the seats in the area which are not 
required by the heritors and tenants are let, as are also the whole 
of the seats in the galleries. 

The following is a correct abstract of the population and reli- 
gious denominations, with the number of individuals belonging to 
each in the parish of Kelton, as taken from a survey in the year 
1840: — Belonging to the Established Church, 2117; other de- 
nominations, 455 ; not connected with any denomination, i. e. not 
in communion, nor in the habit of attending any place of worship, 
318; — total, 2890. Of the 455 Dissenters, there belong to the 
Reformed Presbyterians, 160; Relief, 112; United Associate 
Synod, 35; Roman Catholics, 148; — total, 455. 

Neither the United Secession Dissenters, nor the Roman Ca- 
tholics have any place of worship in the parish. The former at- 
tend Divine service at the Haugh of Urr, about four miles, and the 
latter at Dalbeattie, about five miles from Castle Douglas. 

Of the 318 who are not in the habit of attending any place of 
worship, almost all profess to belong to the Established Church, 
and some of them do occasionally attend. The Dissenting places 

• Since the above was written " the Free Church" has sprung into existence. 
From the recent date of its origin, the number of its adherents cannot be exactly as- 
certained. In this parish they are inconsiderable, but combining with those in Par- 
ton, Grossmichael, and Luittle, they have called a minister, and built a chapel in 
Castle Douglas.

of worship are but thinly attended, though some adherents of the 
Established Church attend in the Sabbath evenings, and also in 
the forenoons, when the weather is inclement. 

Besides the ordinary collections for the poor, the average 
amount of church collections yearly for religious and charitable 
purposes is about L.12. 

Education. — There are six schools at present in the parish, 
three of which are parochial,— one in Castle Douglas, one in 
Rhonehouse, which is the original parish school, and one in Gel- 
ston. The other three are unendowed, and on the teachers' own 
adventure. All the unendowed schools are conducted by females. 
Two of them may almost be reckoned infant schools. In the third, 
besides all the ordinary branches of education, sewing, drawing, 
music, and French are taught. 

The parochial schoolmaster of Rhonehouse alone has a dwell- 
ing-house ; but all the three school-houses are large, well-aired, 
and convenient. 

The branches of education generally taught in the parish schools 
are, reading, writing, arithmethic, geography, mathematics, Latin, 
Greek, French, and Italian. The fixed salary paid by the heri- 
tors is L.51, 6s., which is equally divided among the three school- 
masters. The teacher in Castle Douglas receives also about 
L.7, 10s. from a sum of money mortified by Sir William Douglas, 
and' about L.15 as his share of the seat-rents in the church gal- 
leries. The other two teachers receive from the same sources 
about L.3 and L.7, 10s. each. The average amount of school- 
fees in Castle Douglas is L.120, and in each of the other schools 

about L.32 per annum. , , c r 

The people are, in general, very much alive to the benefits ot 
education. No part of the parish is so distant from one or other 
of the schools as to prevent attendance. The magistrates of Cas- 
tle Douglas have the privilege of sending sixteen poor children to 
school, on the Douglas mortification ; and the trustees and share- 
holder's in the church galleries exercise the same privilege in re- 
gard to the other schools. Education is thus brought within 
reach of the poorest inhabitant ; and there is hardly an individual, 
a native of the parish, of suitable age, who cannot read and write. 
The proportion of scholars to the whole population is a little less 
than one to five. Perhaps it might be of advantage to have a se- 
cond school endowed in Castle Douglas to act as a nursery to the 
present one, which is rather overcrowded. 

Literature— T'aQxe is an excellent subscription library in Castle 



KELTON. 



175 



Douglas, consisting of nearly 1200 well selected and valuable 
volumes. Subscribers have alone the privilege of reading. The 
terms of admission are L.3, 3s., and an annual subscription of half- 
a-guinea. There are also a circulating library, and a juvenile li- 
brary for the use of the children attending the Sabbath school. 

Charitable and other Institutions. — There are two poor houses 
in the parish, the one erected and the other rented by the heri- 
tors and kirk-session. In these, about thirty poor persons, some 
of whom have families, are lodged, and receive the usual allowance 
of out-door paupers to spend as they please. A matron is ap- 
pointed to take charge of the helpless, and orphan, or deserted 
children. She has free apartments assigned her, and receives, per 
month, for taking charge of an orphan child, from 5s. to 7s. 6d. ; 
and for a paralytic or disabled person, from lOs. to 18s. per month, 
according to the nature of the case. This plan is attended with 
less expense, and a greater amount of comfort to the poor, than 
the system of paying for a separate lodging for each. 

Savings Bank. — The Savings Bank of Castle Douglas was 
opened for public business on •24th December 1840, and on 20th

As the institution is yet in its infancy, little can be said regard- 
ing its ultimate success. Hitherto that has been as great as could 
reasonably be expected ; and from the subjoined statement of ac- 
counts and classification of depositors, it appears that a consider- 
able number of individuals in those classes whose benefit it chiefly 
contemplates, take advantage of the institution.

Poor and Parochial Funds.— 1\ie average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is 55. The sums allowed to them vary 
from 9d. to 5s. per week, the average allowance being Is. 8d. 
The annual amount of contributions for the relief of the poor is 
about L.330. This sum is raised by a legal assessment, amount- 
\xw to L.300, and the half of the ordinary collections at the pa- 
risli church, amounting to L.30, the other half being retained by 
the session to meet the current expenses, and; relieve the occa- 
sional poor. There is also the interest of L.lOO, given by Miss 
Harriet Douglas, now Mrs Congar, of New York, one of the 
heirs of Sir William Douglas, which is expended in the purchase 
of coals, and distributed, in equal proportions, among the poor in 
Castle Douglas, Rhonehouse, and Oelston. The legal assess- 
ment was imposed in 1837-38. It began at the rate of 5d. per 
pound upon the real value of property in the parish. It stea- 
dily increased at the rate of Id. per pound each year, until it 
reached 8d. per pound. The rate is imposed upon all tangible 
property above the value of L.3 per annum. The landlords pay 
the one-half, and the tenants the other half. The system is ma- 
naged at an expense of L.25 yearly, including L.15 as the clerk's 
salary, the remainder being expended in paying the persons ap- 
pointed to value the different properties, and in providing the ne- 
cessary accommodation for the permanent committee of manage- 
ment, which meets once a-month. 

Besides the regular poor, a good many persons reqmre occa- 
sional aid. These are relieved by the kirk-session, out ot the 
half of the ordinary collections, which the law allows them to re- 
tain There is no disposition among the poor to refrain from 
seeking parochial relief, but, on the contrary, there is the most 
mortifying eagerness to get upon the roll. They look upon i as 
their natural and legal right, and receive without grat "de the 
pittance that is given without charity. This deplorable effect, 
destruction of the proper feelings that ought to exist between 
e eivers and receivers of charity, seems to be inseparable from 
the system, and is one of the strongest objections to its adoption. 
In some few cases, it is to be feared that the poor refrn from 
lakh" the exertions to maintain themselves, of which they are 
. or havincr an opportunity of earnmg a livelihood, as 
S Ih m h.::: at cert season's of the year they still apy

rent reluctance in children to allow their aged parents and rela- 
tions to come upon the parish. 

There is not much private charity now exercised in the parish, 
as it is thought inconsistent with a main object of so large an an- 
nual expenditure upon the poor, the suppression of vagrancy and 
public begging. Many families, however, are still favoured with 
a weekly visit from the poor persons whom they were in the habit 
of serving before the introduction of the poor rate ; and the col- 
lections at the church have not been sensibly diminished. 

Fairs. — There are seven fairs held in the parish in the course 
of the year, viz. at Castle Douglas, for the sale of horses, on the 
11th February if it happen to be a Monday, if not, on the Mon- 
day following ; at Castle Douglas, for horses and hiring, on the 
23d March, or Monday after ; at Castle Douglas, for the sale 
of hoggets, on the first Monday of April ; at Keltonhill, for 
horses and hiring, on the 17th June, O, S. ; at Castle Douglas, 
for lambs, on the Monday before the fair of Minniehive, which 
is held on the second Friday of August ; at Castle Douglas, for 
horses and hiring, on the 23d September or Monday after ; and 
at Castle Douglas for horses, on the Monday after the 13th No- 
vember, O. S. 

Formerly all these fairs were held at Kelton hill; but, with the 
exception of that in June, they have been transferred to Castle 
Douglas, the multiplication of places of entertainment, and, espe- 
cially, the convenience of the banks, having rendered the change 
advisable, and even necessary. 

Inns, Alehouses, Sfc. — There are twenty-three inns and alehouses 
in the parish, besides two grocers' shops, hcensed to retail ardent 
spirits,— a number greatly exceeding the wants of the population. 
Several such houses have been closed within the last three years, 
and it is greatly to be desired that their number were still farther 
reduced. Of this, however, there appears a great probability, as 
the use of ardent spirits has been considerably diminished, since 
public attention began to be directed to the cause of temperance, 
and several of these houses are understood to be doing very little 
business, and very little harm. Upon the whole, they do less in- 
jury to the morals of the people than, at first sight, is apt to be 
supposed ; for a considerable number of them are places of enter- 
tainment for farmers and dealers attending the fairs and markets, 
and are very little frequented except on these occasions. 

Fuel.— Coa\ is the fuel commonly used in the parish. It is

brought from Cumberland to the ports of Pahiackie and Tongland 
Bridge. At certahi seasons, when their servants and horses are 
not necessarily engaged in agricultural operations, the farmers send 
for coal to Dalmellington, in Ayrshire, a distance of thirty-six 
miles from Castle Douglas. Here it costs less than the same 
weight of English coal; but it is also much less durable; and, 
taking into account the long land carriage, in reality no cheaper- 
The common cart-load of shipped coal, containing 8 bushels, or 
12 cwt., costs about 9s., besides cartage, which is 2s. 6d. more. 
Peat is found in the parish, but it is not very extensively used as 
fuel.

PRESBYTERY OF KIRKCUDBRIGHT, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY. 

THE REV. ALEX. GIBSON, MINISTER. 



I._ Topography and Natural History. 

The name of this parish has been adopted from that of the prin- 
cipal estate which it contains. An Irish chief named M'Ghie 
settled here in early times, and the property he acquired was long 
retained by his descendants. Hence the name of the family estate 
and also of the parish. The Gaelic prefix Bal signifies a dwelling. 

Boundaries, -c— The parish lies about the middle of the stew- 
artry of Kirkcudbright, and is of irregular figure. To the eastward 
it is separated from the parishes of Kelton, Crossmichael, and 
Parton, by the river Dee ; to the northward, from Kells, by the 
Black water of Dee ; on the west, it is bounded by the parish of 
Girthon ; and on the south, by those of Twynholm and Tongland. 
The greatest length, from south-east to north-west, is about nine 
miles, and the greatest breadth from east to west, about seven. 

Topographical Appearances.— To the south-east the surface of 
the parish is in general level, but in all other directions it is hilly, 
though not mountainous. The higher parts of the parish command 
a very extensive view, including, among other objects, the Cars- 



BALMAGHIE. 



179 



phairn and MinnigafF hills to the north and west, those of Cumber- 
land to the south-east, and also, in clear weather, the Isle of Man. 

In the valley of the Dee the soil is kindly and fertile, and in a 
few places deep. Immediately adjoining the river, there are some 
extensive meadows, the advantage of which is felt by the farmer 
in the supply of much excellent keep for his dairy stock during 
the winter months. These meadows, in connection with the re- 
markable stillness of the river, which expands in many places to a 
great width, impart a peculiarly peaceful air to the landscape in 
this part of the parish. 

Hydrography. — At Lochinbreck, on the estate of Woodhall, 
the property of William Kennedy Laurie, Esq., there is a mineral 
spring possessing considerable medicinal virtue, and which has in 
consequence been resorted to from time immemorial. The mine- 
ral ingredients which enter into its composition are sulphate of 
iron and carbonic acid. The water is transparent; a powerful 
tonic and diuretic, and not unpleasant to the taste. In com- 
plaints of the stomach, and disorders arising from obstruction or 
debility, it has often proved a very efficacious restorative. Pa- 
tients afflicted with aguish complaints have generally derived much 
benefit from it; and even in obstinate intermittents, when bark 
and other medicines have failed, it has frequently been instrumen- 
tal in effecting perfect cures. For the accommodation of visitors 
and invalids, an inn has been provided in the vicinity of the well; 
but there is reason to believe, that, were the accommodation more 
extensive, the resort to it would be still greater than it is. 

There are five considerable lochs in the parish. Gran- 
noch or Woodhall Loch is the largest, and is about two and a- 
half miles long, and at some places half a mile broad. In all 
of them, with the exception of Lochinbreck, pike and perch are 
to be found in considerable numbers, and on this account the trout 
are few. Lochinbreck, however, contains neither pike nor perch, 
but abounds in trout; and hence its name, which signifies the lake 
of trouts. 

In general these lakes are situated in the upland districts of the 
parish, and their shores are for the most part unclothed with wood. 
Even in these circumstances, however, they please the eye by the 
variety and freshness they impart to the landscape ; but Wood- 
hall Loch, which is situated at the bottom of a steep bank, cover- 
ed in various places by trees, possesses much beauty.

gaff, runs along the northern side of the parish. Flowing to the 
eastward, it meets the Ken at right angles, and the united stream 
thereafter takes the name of the Dee. This river flows to the 
south, forming the eastern boundary of Balmaghie, and, passing 
between the parish of Kelton on the east, and that of Tongland 
on the west, it expands into an estuary below Kirkcudbright. It 
is proper to remark, that, in its progress along the parish, the Dee 
has for the most part the aspect of a lake. In some places it is 
very deep, and its greatest breadth may be nearly a quarter of a mile. 
From the nature of the soil through which it flows, its waters are 
of a particularly dark colour. 

The fish which frequent the Dee are, trout, sea trout, salmon, 
parr, pike, and perch. Trout do not abound, but of the few which 
are to be met with, most are of the red or better sort. During 
the season, the means employed by the tacksman of the fishery at 
Tongland for taking the salmon are so eff'ectual, that few or none 
find their way to this portion of the river, with the exception of 
such as pass during high floods, and in the .interval between Sa- 
turday and Monday, when the law requires the obstructions to be 
removed. The fishery opens at the beginning of February, and 
closes in September; after- this the salmon ascend the river to 
spawn, and, in the spring months, retreat towards the sea. Here, 
as elsewhere, numbers are annually destroyed in close time by the 
illegal means usually resorted to for such a purpose. 

In the upper district granite abounds, but in the other parts of 
the parish the prevailing rock is greywacke or whinstone. No 
limestone is to be found ; and all that is used for building and 
agricultural purposes is brought from the shores of Cumberland. 
°2ooZoy.— Considerable numbers of waterfowl frequent the 
streams and lakes. In winter, wild ducks of various kinds, geese, 
and, in hard seasons, flocks of swans are to be seen on the wing 
and in the waters. 

In the part of the Dee bounding this parish, a shell-fish is found 
which often contains a pearl. This fresh-water mussel has lately 
been pronounced by a scientific gentleman to be a very scarce va- 
riety of the Unio Eoissyi of Michaud. The pearls have various 
hues and considerable beauty. 

/oot.— Plantations thrive remarkably well, and were they of 
more frequent occurrence, they would tend to increase the beauty 
and promote the improvement of the district. In those of younger 
growth, larch forms the staple ; but in various parts of the parish.

11. — Civil History. 

The most remarkable antiquity which the parish contains is that 
of the Castle of Threave, which is still standing. It is situated 
upon an island, several acres in extent, formed by the river Dee. 
The walls are very thick and strong, and bear the marks of great 
antiquity. It was formerly the residence of the Douglases, and is 
said to have been built by one of that family upon the site of a 
more ancient castle, which belonged to the ancient lords or petty 
kings of Galloway. The remains consist of a great square tower, 
which has been surrounded at a small distance by a wall with three 
round tovrers. Part of the wall, with one of the towers, is still 
standing, and the ruins of the other two may be seen lying upon 
the ground. Upon the fall of the house of Douglas, and the an- 
nexation of Galloway to the Crown of Scotland in 1455, this cas- 
tle came into the hands of the King ; but it was afterwards trans- 
ferred to the family of Maxwell. The Lords Maxwell, afterwards 
Earls of Nithsdale, possessed the heritable office of Stewards of 
the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright and keepers of the Castle of 
Threave until the year 1747, when all the heritable jurisdictions 
in Scotland were annexed to the Crown. 

The keeper of the Castle of Threave received from each of the 
parishes of the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright what was called "a 
lardner mart cow," that is, a cow in such condition as to be fit for 
killing and salting at Martinmas for winter provisions. These 
cows were regularly paid to the Earls of Nithsdale till the forfeiture 
of the last Earl in 1715, when the practice went into disuse ; but 
formerly, so attentive were the family to that right, that when, in 
the year 1704, they sold the estate on which the Castle of Threave 
stood, they reserved the island and castle, that it might afford them 
a title to the cattle ; and they regularly, by a written commission, 
appointed a captain of the Castle of Threave. 

During the troubles under Charles I., the Earl of Nithsdale 
held this castle for the King, and armed, paid, and victualled a 
garrison of eighty men, besides officers, all at his own expense ; 
till at length His Majesty, unable to send him any assistance, di- 
rected him to make the best conditions he could for himself and 
his garrison. 

The same Castle of Threave was, a. d. 1451-2, the scene of 
an outrageous and cruel insult upon the royal authority. The 



182 



KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE. 



fortress was then held by WiHiam, eighth Earl of Douglas, who, 
in fact, possessed a more unlimited authority over the southern, 
districts of Scotland than the reigning monarch. The Earl had, 
on some pretence, seized and imprisoned a baron, called Maclel- 
lan, tutor of Bombie, whom he threatened to bring to trial by his 
power of hereditary jurisdiction. The uncle of this gentleman, 
Sir Patrick Grey of Foulis, who commanded the body-guard of 
James IL, obtained from that prince a warrant requiring from 
Earl Douglas the body of the prisoner. When Grey appeared, 
the Earl instantly suspected his errand. " You have not dined," 
said he, without suffering him to open his commission ; " it is ill 
talking between a full man and a fasting."" While Grey was din- 
ing, the unfortunate prisoner was, by Douglas's command, led 
forth to the court yard and beheaded. When the repast was fi- 
nished, the King's letter was presented and opened. " Sir Pa- 
trick," said Douglas, leading Grey to the court, " right glad had 
I been to honour the King's messenger, but you have come too 
late ; yonder lies your sister's son without the head ; you are wel- 
come to his dead body." Grey having mounted his horse, turned 
to the Earl, and expressed his wrath in a deadly oath, that he 
would requite the injury with Douglas's heart's blood. " To 
horse " cried the haughty baron ; and the messenger of his prince 
was pursued till within a few miles of Edinburgh. Grey, however, 
had an opportunity of keeping his vow ; for, being upon guard in 
the King's antechamber at Stirling when James, incensed at the 
insolence of the Earl, struck him with his dagger, Sir Patrick 
rushed in, and dispatched him with a poleaxe. 

The Castle of Threave was the last of the fortresses which held 
out for the house of Douglas after their grand rebellion in 1453. 
James II. writes an account of ttte exile of this potent family to 
Charles VII. of France, dated 8th July 1455, and adds, that all 
their castles had been yielded to him except Threave, which, at 
the time of his writing, was besieged by the royal troops. 

Mr Joseph Train of Castle Douglas has in his possession eight 
small stone balls, four of them 3| lbs. each, four about 1 lb. each, 
and a gold ring, which were found in the Castle of Threave in 
the summer of 1843 by some labourers whilst clearing away mould 
to be used as manure in the adjoining farm of Kelton Mains.

There was also found, the preceding summer, a stone ball, about 
nineteen inches in diameter, vhich was presented to the Dumfries 
Museum, and may be seen in the Observatory at Maxweltown. 

Upon the estate of Duchrae, in the northern part of the pansh, 
there are the marks of a small military station, which was probably 
occupied by a detachment of the Roman army. 

Land-owners.-T\.e landed property in the pansh is divided 
among sixteen proprietors. Of these, several possess only a single 
Farm, but in every instance the yearly rental is considerably above 

Balmaghie House, the residence of Captain James Murray 
Gordon, R. N., patron of the parish, is situated on the southern 
part of the parish, and not far from the Dee. Part of a more an- 
cient building is incorporated with the present mansion, but no 
part of it is of modern erection. The grounds possess in a re- 
markable degree the undulating character so peculiar to Gallo- 
way, and, advantage having been taken of this in laying out the 
plantations, the effect is very pleasing. 

Upon the estate of Duchrae, and near the junction of the Dee 

• The following interesting communication has been received from Mr Joseph 

'''''ThlStTeUc'lff theTamily of Douglas in Galloway that has reached our times, 
so far as my information extends, is part of an oaken bedstead, well authenticated to 
have been the principal one in the Castle of Threave, and said  have been that ot 
Black Douglas himself. " It is one of the old closet kind of beds to be seen yet in 
some remote farm-houses in Galloway. The back and ends are of wood, and it seems 
to have had sliding doors in front, but they are gone. The parts that remain are en- 
tirelv covered with carved figures of men and beasts, so rudely executed as to bespeak 
its hicrh antiquity. Busts of the various Earls of the family in their robes and coro- 
nets are placed in the foreground, and surmounted by troopers caparisoned agreeable 
to the Act of James I., Parliament 9, Cap. 122. ' Ilk laik landed man havand ten 
poundies in gudes and geare, shall have for his bodie and for y defence of y realme and 
ane sufficient action, a leathern jacket strongly stuflfed, anciently worn under a cot of 
mail, ane barnet and ane glove of plate, with anespeareand sworde, ane harbeirhon 
habergeon and gude iron jack for his bodie, with ane knapishag, ahead piece and 
twa gude Hawkerties. armour for the legs.' The infantry are evidently equipped 
in strict accordance with the Act James IV., Parliament 6, Cap. 87. ' Mairover 
the kinT commands that ilk man havend the value of ane kow, in gudes and gear, 
shall have ane bow with ane schaife of arrows and ane speare.' The dragoons are 
mounted on weasel like chargers, each man in full panoply, and all performing differ- 
ent evolutions,— one is in the act of shouldering his spear, an other drawing his clay- 
more, and a third cutting down the enemy. The first foot soldier bears the handsengte 
standard, to which is attached a forked streamer with a lattier, or St Andrew's 
cross. The national banner is supported by a sturdy bilman,— next comes an archer 
with his bow bent, and carrying in his belt his schuife of arrows, and their various 
Rantmen and Gillies. The piper is a conspicuous person in this motley group, by the 
size of his cheeks, which appear extended to an extraordinary size by pressing wind 
into his instrument. He is accompanied by a Paganini-like personage playing on 
a one-stringed fiddle. The drummer, too, is a person of distinction— he is repre- 
sented as on a march, his drum being unbraced and slung over his shoulder by a 
belt ; but a variety of sword and Morris dancers seem more actively employed, being 
represented in all the zany buffoon attitudes of such performers. Although this an-

and Ken, the proprietor, John Cuninghame, Esq., built, about 
twenty years ago, a very handsome house, In the old English style. 
The stone used is granite, and was obtained partly in this parish 
and partly in Kells. The situation has considerable natural advan- 
tages, of which the proprietor has judiciously availed himself, and 
the place possesses much beauty. 

These two gentlemen usually reside upon their estates in the 
parish. There are three other resident heritors, who farm their 
own lands. 

The ecclesiastical history of this parish is interesting in one par- 
ticular, from its connection with the origin of the Reformed Sy- 
nod. Mr John M'Millan, the founder of that body, was minister 
of Balmaghie for more than two years. This gentleman ap- 
pears not to have been satisfied with the Revolution settlement ; 
and, accordingly, in May 1703, as the presbytery record bears, he 
protested verbally against all the courts of the Established Church, 
and declared, that " he would withdraw from the presbytery for 
three or four presbytery days, and perhaps longer j" but refused, 
in the first instance, to assign his reasons for adopting such a course. 
On being dealt with, however, he declared, that " the oath of al- 
legiance, as cumulative to other defections, was the ground of his 
withdrawing, and that he knew not whether this church was Pres- 
cient hustie bed cannot be, with any degree of certainty, traced back for a longer pe- 
riod than 386 years, its rude workmanship is indicative of higher antiquity. The 
figures are as rudely executed as the effigies on the coin of Alexander III., but the 
framework carving by which they are surrounded, and the ornamental panels below, 
are done in better taste and with more regularity. 

" Since this relic came into my possession the greater part of the figures have been 
Iransplaced and strengthened, with a view to make them resist for a few centuries more 
the work or ravages of time." 

During the persecution in the seventeenth century, many persons, it is well 
known, suffered in Galloway in the cause of religion. In the churchyard of Balma- 
ghie there are two grave-stones commemorative of the death of martyrs, one of which 
bears the following inscription : 

" Here lyes David Haliiday, portioner of Meifield, who was shot upon the 2Ist of 
Feb. 1685; and David Haliiday, once in Glengape, who was likewise shot upon the 
11th July 1685, for their adherence to the principles of Scotland's Covenanted Re- 
formation. 

Beneath this stone two David Hallidays

Nor could they join with lordly prelacy. 

Indulging favours from Christ's enemies 

Quenched not their zeal. This monument then cries,

byterian or Episcopal, in regard the General Assembly had not 
declared the same by their explicit act." At a later stage, he gave 
in a written statement of grievances, as affecting, in his judgment, 
the purity and Scriptural character of the Church. In taking this 
step, he had the avowed concurrence of two other members of the 
presbytery, but who afterwards withdrew their support, so that he 
was left alone. After a variety of proceedings in the case, the 
narrative of which occupies a large portion of the presbytery re- 
cords of the time, and Mr M'Millan still preserving, upon the 
whole, the attitude he had assumed, the presbytery at length pro- 
ceeded to his deposition, in December 1703. This sentence they 
pronounced mainly upon the ground that the course pursued by 
Mr M'Millan, in withdrawing himself from the presbytery, and in 
other respects, was, in their judgment, essentially divisive and 
schismatic. Such, however, was the regard in which he was held 
by the parishioners, that they resisted every attempt to eject him 
from the manse and church. Mr William M'Kie, though legally 
inducted to the charge, was obliged to hire a house for himself, 
and to officiate in a barn to those who were willing to acknowledge 
and attend his ministry. At length, after the struggle had con- 
tinued in the parish for twelve years, Mr M'Millan retired volun- 
tarily, and connected himself with the United Societies which ex- 
isted in various parts of the country, and adhered to Mr Came- 
ron's views of ecclesiastical polity. In 1743, he was joined by Mr 
Thomas Nairne, a minister of the Associate Presbytery, but who 
had separated from that body. These two ministers, together with 
some ruling elders, concurred in constituting a presbytery at Brae- 
head, in the parish of Carnwath, on the 1st of August 1743, un- 
der the appellation of the Reformed Presbytery. 

On the first December 1753, Mr M'Millan died at Broomhill, 
in Lanarkshire, and was buried in the churchyard of Dalserf, where 
a monument has lately been erected to his memory. He attained 
the venerable age of eighty-four years. 

Parochial Registers. — In regard to parochial registers, it may 
be mentioned, that, prior to 180, but little attention appears to 

• When some of iMr M'Kie's adherents went to plough the glebe for his behoof, 
those of his competitor rose up against them, cut the reins in pieces, turned the horses 
loose, and threw the ploughshare into the adjoining lake. Some threatened violence 
to the minister's person. An infuriated female actually attempted the execution of 
it, and would probably have effected her purpose, had he not interposed his hand 
between his tliroat and a reaping sickle, with which she was armed. His fingers were 
cut to the bone. The glove which he wore was carefully preserved, as a memorial of 
the providential escape he had made — Note to the Old Statistical Account.

have been bestowed on this particular. Since that date a regis- 
ter of marriages, births, and baptisms has been regularly kept. 

III. — Population. 

Population in 1755, according to Dr Webster's return, 697 
1794, - - 862 

Population in 1831, - - males, 721 ; females, 695; total, 1416. 

1841, - males, 592; females, 600; total, 1252. 

Of these 275 reside in the village of Laurieston, and 243 in that 
of Bridge of Dee. The number of families is 268, giving an 
average of something more than 4g persons to each family. The 
average number of children residing in each family is about 2. 



Number of population under 15 years is - 459 

between 15 and 30, - 302 

30 and 50, - 270 

50 and 70, - 170 

70 and upwards, - 51 



1252 

Bachelors above fifty years of age are 10 in number; the unmar- 
ried women above forty- five are 13. There are 3 fatuous and 2 
blind persons. There is one deaf and dumb boy, who is at present 
receiving his education in Edinburgh. The average number of births 
for the last seven years is 24 ; the average number of marriages 
for the same period is 6. The inhabited houses are 226, and the 
uninhabited, 9. 

The decrease of 164 in the population since 1831 is accounted 
for by the circumstance, that, at that period, operations were car- 
rying on to deepen the bed of the Dee, at the lower end of the 
parish, with the view of facilitating the passage of the waters dur- 
ing floods. This of course led to the employment and temporary 
residence of a considerable number of workmen, who have since 
passed away. The same circumstance accounts for the fact, that, 
in the return for that period, the number of males was considerably 
above that of females 

Character and Habits of the People.— The people are in gene- 
ral comfortably clothed and lodged, and they appear to be con- 
tented. Most of the cottagers keep a pig or two, and, as the far- 
mers are accustomed to allow potato land for the manure thus 
produced, they are in this way supplied with an important article 
of food. 

IV. — Industry, 
Agriculture. — The staple employment is agriculture, and by 
far the greater number of families is engaged in its pursuits 
Upon these, of course, the artisans and shop-keepers are depend- 
ent for their support. 



BALMAGIIIE.

The total number of acres in the parish may be estimated at 
17,518 Scots. Of these, about 5472 are arable, and 12,046 remain 
constantly waste or in pasture. Cultivation, it is believed, -has 
been extended over all the lands from which a profitable return 
could reasonably be expected. 

Rent af Land,The average rent of arable land is 15s. per 
Scots acre. The real rental of the parish is L.6200. When the 
Old Statistical Account was drawn up, the real rental was L.2640. 

Live-Stock.—GaWodiy cattle are reared over the whole parish, 
and for them the farmers in general have a decided preference 
over all other breeds. There are, however, on some of the farms, 
a number of Ayrshire cows. In the higher districts, a number 
of Highlanders are grazed. In regard to sheep, the black-faced 
sort are of course the staple on the upland farms ; but, on the 
richer soils, crosses between the Leicester and Mug, or between 
the Leicester and Cheviot, are also reared. 

The general duration of leases is nineteen years. The farm- 
steadings are in general good ; those on the estate of Balmag- 
hie were all rebuilt near the beginning of this century, and 
are excellent specimens of that class of buildings. Stone dikes 
constitute the usual enclosure, and are, upon the whole, in a good 
state of repair. In tillage husbandry, the seven shift rotation is 
usually followed. Bone-dust is used to a considerable extent in 
the raising of turnips, which are eaten off by sheep, and thus the 
farmer is enabled to have an additional quantity of land under the 
plough. A good deal of draining is every year done, but, as stones 
are plentiful, tiles are not much used. 

Raw Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce an- 
nually raised in the parish may be estimated as follows : 

36,650 bushels ofoats, at 2s. 5d., . . L.4428 10 10 

1,000 Do, barley, at 3s, 5d., . 170 16 8 

190 acres of potatoes, at L.8 per acre, , . 1520 0 0 

123 Do, turnips, at L,4 per do, . 492 0 0 

56,500 stones of meadow hay, at 4d, per stone, . 941 13 4 

18,780 Do, rye-grass hay, at 6d, per do. , 469 10 0 

253 cows, producing L.6 per head annually, , 1518 0 0 
959 black-cattle, yielding an average return for keep by the year, of 

L,2, 10s, . . 2397 10 0

V. — Parochial Economy. 
There are two considerable villages in the parish, Laurieston

KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE. 



and Bridge of Dee, the population of which has already been 
given. 

Market-Town. — Castle Douglas, in the parish of Kelton, is the 
nearest market-town, and is situated at the distance of about six 
miles from the centre of Balmaghie. There are two branch post- 
officesinthe parish. The length of turnpike road may be estimated 
at about sixteen miles. The fences along the way sides are in 
very good repair ; and the same remark applies to the bridges. 
That across the Dee at Glenlochar was built by subscription about 
the beginning of this century, and is substantial and commodious. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church, which was built in 1794, 
and is in a good state of repair, is situated near the Dee, and 
consequently at one side of the parish. It is seated for nearly 
four hundred persons. No payment is exacted for sittings, but 
the whole of the church is allocated to the respective estates, 
with the exception of the communion seats, which are capable of 
accommodating thirty-six persons, and are free to all. 

The manse was built near the beginning of the present century, 
and is in an excellent state of repair. The extent of the glebe is 
fourteen Scots acres, and may be worth about thirty shillings per 
acre. The stipend is sixteen chalders, half barley and half meal. 

There are about 1 12 individuals professing to adhere to the 
Church of Rome, and 22 Episcopalians. There are 1 1 persons 
connected with the Reformed Synod, and three famiHes with the 
United Associate Synod. 

Education. — There are two parochial schools, one of which is 
situated in the village of Laurieston, and the other at Glenlochar. 
The salary connected with the former is L.30 Sterling, and the 
school fees may yield an equal sum. That of the teacher at Glen- 
lochar is L.21, 63. 6|d. Sterling, and the school fees may amount 
to L.14. A dwelling-house has lately been erected by the heritors 
for the teacher at Laurieston. There is a third school at Bridge 
of Dee, endowed by the Society for Propagating Christian Know- 
ledge, to whom the lands in that neighbourhood belong. The 
salary paid to the teacher, including certain items allowed him, 
is nearly L.30, and the school fees may be estimated at L.25. He 
is accommodated with a house and offices. 

Sunday schools have been established in three different locali- 
ties, and are at present attended by upwards of 100 young people. 

Library. — A subscription library was commenced many years 
ago, and is still in existence ; but the members are not numerous.

Poor and Parochial F««i.-There are at present 30 paupers 
receiving stated aid from the poor's funds The highest sum pa,d 
to a pauper, inordinary circumstances, is L" -"-1; 
lowest LI There are two insane paupers supported from 
hi funds at an annual charge of L.26. The sum annual y 
expended upon the poor amounts to about L.BO, and is raised 
partly by the collections in the church, and partly by donation 
from the heritors individually. Amongst many there is an eviden 
reluctance to apply, in the first instance, for stated relief ; but it 
is equally observable, that the feeling disappears when they have 
been in receipt of such aid for a time. 

Inns and Alehouses.— There are five small inns and two ale- 
houses in the parish. All of these, with one exception, are con- 
ducted with much propriety, and, it is believed, without ill conse- 
quences to the morals of the people. 

Fuel— In various parts of the parish peat is found in great 
abundance, and constitutes the fuel principally used by the inha- 
bitants. Coal is imported from the shores of Cumberland, and 
landed at Kirkcudbright, Tongland, and Palnackie in the parish ot 
Buittle; but as the nearest of these places is nine miles distant, 
the charge for overland carriage constitutes a heavy per centage 
upon the cost of the article. At the less busy seasons, many of 
the farmers are in the practice of sending for coals to Dalmelling- 
ton in Ayrshire. The distance is not less than thirty-five miles ; 
but, considering the small charge at the pit-mouth, the trifling ex- 
penses incurred on the road, and that the journeys are so timed 
as not materially to interfere with the work of the farm, this is 
found to be a rather economical method of procuring a supply of 
fuel.

PRESBYTERY OF KIRKCUDBRIGHT, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY. 

THE REV. JOHN WHITSON, M. D., MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, 8fc. — The parish of Crossmichael is situated about the 
middle of the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright. In old writings, it is 
called Corsemichael. The ancient and modern appellation is 
obviously derived from St Michael, the patron saint, to whom the 
church was dedicated. No vestige, however, of any cross is to be 
seen, and there is no allusion to it in any traditions that have been 
handed down to us. St Michael seems, however, to have been 
regarded as an individual of more than ordinary sanctity, as those 
churches called Kirkmichael were obviously dedicated to him ; and 
one in the parish of Tongland, on the west side of the Dee, at a 
small village called Balnacross, or the town of the cross, derived 
its name from the same source. 

The church of Crossmichael was transferred to the Abbey of 
Sweetheart in 1275 by Dervorgille, the wife of Allan and mother 
of John Baliol, who succeeded to the Scottish throne as the de- 
scendant of David of Huntingdon. Dervorgille survived her hus- 
band, and founded Baliol College at Oxford, and monasteries at 
New Abbey or Sweetheart, Wigton, Dumfries, and Dundee. Until 
1587, this church remained with the monks of Sweetheart, after 
which it was annexed to the Crown. In 1624, the estate belong- 
ing to this abbey became the property of Sir Robert Spottiswoode, 
who transferred his right to Charles I. in 1633, when the see of 
Edinburgh was about to be erected. When Prelacy was abolished 
in 1689, the patronage of the church and parish fell to the Crown, 
but was given to the Viscount of Kenmore, whose family had long 
considered itself as having a legal right to it. The minister 
of Crossmichael was made a member of the Chapter of Galloway 
at the re-establishment of Episcopacy by James VI., and lands, 
rated by the old extent at forty shillings, originally belonged to 
him, of which he was deprived at the Reformation. 



CROSSMICHAEL.

Extent and Boundaries.— The length of the parish from north 
to south, is about four miles and a-half, and its breadth about a 
mile les;. On the west, it is bounded by the Dee, which sepa- 
rates it from the parish of Balmaghie; on the north, by Parton ; 
on the east, by the river Urr, which separates it from Kirkpatrick- 
Durham, and Urr; and on the south, by the parishes of Buittle 
and Kelton. Its figure is rectangular. When, under David L, 
the Episcopate of Galloway was re-established, its eastern boun- 
dary was the Urr and its western the Cree. The eastern division 
of the Stewartry formed a portion of the Bishoprick of Glasgow, 
and was included in the Deanery of Nith. At the Reformation, 
the parishes in the eastern division of the Stewartry were made to 
form part of the Presbytery of Dumfries, while the others formed 
the Presbytery of Kirkcudbright, with the exception of Kirkma- 
breck and MinnigafF, which, on account of their locality, were 
annexed to the Presbytery of Wigton. The river Urr, therefore, 
which Was formerly the boundary between the Bishopricks of Gal- 
loway and Glasgow, is now the boundary between the Synods of 
Dumfries and Galloway, and between the Presbyteries of Dum- 
fries and Kirkcudbright. Along the banks of the Urr and the 
Dee, the land is very fertile ; and in other parts of the parish 
there are small, rich, and beautiful valleys. The general appear- 
ance of the parish, however, is hilly, and, up to a not very remote 
date, it may have been regarded as a district in a middle state 
between pastoral and agricultural. In the north-east district 
of the parish, there are a number of hills fit only for pasture, 
and which yield but little grass. They are rocky, and some 
of them have lately been planted with larch. In the immediate 
vicinity of the shore, there are hills rising to the height of 100 or 
200 feet, and the interior of the country for several miles is nearly 
at the same elevation, and of a very unequal surface. The coun- 
try is thus divided into a succession of hills more or less abrupt. 
The surface of the hills is very frequently broken by abrupt pro- 
tuberances, steep banks, and rocky knolls of every shape. In 
many instances, however, these hills are cultivated to their sum- 
mits, and yield excellent crops. The soil is extremely various, 
consisting chiefly of sand, till, loam, or holm, and the crops in 
general are good where justice has been done to the land. 

Hydrography. — There are three lakes in this parish. The first 
is Erncrags loch, on two small islands of which sea-gulls formerly 
built their nests. Were the water it contains not necessary for 



192 



KlUKCUDBUIGHTSHIRE. 



driving a meal-mill, to which nearly all the parish is thirled, it 
might be almost, if not altogether dried. It contains trouts, pikes, 
perches, and eels. The second is Luchroan, which is larger than 
the former, containing about fifty acres of ground, and is supplied 
with water from no visible source but the clouds. It is situated in 
the highest district of the parish, and its depth varies from 60 to 130 
feet. It is seldom frozen in winter, and its water is remarkably clear. 
The third is Lochsmaddy, which is not nearly the size of either 
of the two former ones, but is said to be deep, and, like them, to 
contain the kinds of fish which have already been mentioned. 

On the estate of Auchendolly there is a chalybeate spring, 
which has not been analyzed, but which is probably too weak to 
be beneficially employed. 

The river Dee, which forms the western boundary of the pa- 
rish, rises at the head of the parish of Minnigaff from Loch Dee 
and other sources in the north-western district of the stewartry, 
and runs in a south-east course of twenty-two miles, when it meets 
at Livingstone with the Ken, which, although supplying the great- 
est quantity of water, loses its name in the Dee, which then be- 
comes the largest river in Galloway, and formed of old the boun- 
dary between the powerful tribes of the Selgovae and Novantes. 
It is noticed by Ptolemy and Richard under the name of Deva. 

The Ken, which rises in the northern part of the stewartry, 
runs twenty-five miles in a southerly course, forms a lake of four 
miles and a-half long and half a mile broad, called Loch Ken. 
These rivers, after their junction, form another lake of similar 
length and smaller breadth, having the parishes of Balmaghie on 
the west, and Parton and Crossmichael on the east. These col- 
lections of water, extending to about ten miles in length, frequently 
overflow the adjoining land, and are navigable. Formerly, great 
quantities of marl were brought from Carlinwark loch by a canal 
to the Dee, and which passed up to New Galloway, fifteen miles 
distant from the loch. The canal was of very moderate dimen- 
sions, and is now partially filled up. The late Sir Alexander 
Gordon obtained an act of Parliament for making a canal from 
the sea to near Glenlochar bridge, which, according to the calcu- 
lations of engineers about the end of last century, could have been 
executed for about L.9000. That sum, however, it appears could 
not be procured, and the undertaking was most reluctantly aban- 
doned by its public-spirited and benevolent author. The Dee, 
after leaving this parish, runs southward, dividing the parishes of 

6 



CROSSMICKAEL. 



193 



Balmaghie, Tongland, and Twynholm on the west, from the pa- 
rishes of Kelton and Kirkcudbright on the east. Formerly, there 
was no bridge in this neighbourhood over the Dee, ferry-boats 
supplying their places, occasioning frequently great annoyance and 
danger. The erection, therefore, of the one at Glenlochar, up- 
wards of thirty years ago, has been a most important acquisition 
to the country. The floods of the river, which are sometimes very 
frequent, injure the grass on the meadows, rendering it for some- 
time unwholesome food for cattle. The breadth of the river is 
very variable. Opposite the manse, where there is a ferry-boat, 
it is 220 yards broad, and its depth from 40 to 60 feet. The bed 
of the river, between Glenlochar bridge and Tongland, is rocky, 
and, in many places, shallow. 

The river Urr rises from Loch Urr. It divides the parishes of 
Glencairn, Dunscore, Kirkpatrick-Durham, Urr, and Colvend, 
on the east side, from the parishes of Balmaclellan, Parton, Cross- 
michael, and Buittle, on the west side. The rivers in this neigh- 
bourhood do not now discharge the same quantity of water into the 
sea as formerly ; which is accounted for by supposing that land culti- 
vated absorbs much more moisture than it did in its wild state, from 
its being more pervious to water, and from more of that fluid being 
required for the nourishment and growth of plants. The rivers 
Dee and Urr have abundance of trouts, and salmon coming up to 
spawn in them are caught in great numbers. The salmon caught 
in the Dee are considered superior in quality to those caught in 
any other river in the neighbourhood. Few of them pass Tong- 
land from the doughs erected there. The pike, perch, and eel 
are also to be found in the Dee. The perch is said to have 
been first introduced. into it in 1750, by Mr Copland of Collies- 
ton, and are now taken sometimes in great numbers. From a 
statement made by Boethius, and reiterated by Buchanan, — 
that eels were formerly caught herein great quantities, and trans- 
mitted to Italy, it would appear that they then existed in much 
greater abundance than at present. Mussels are found in the 
Dee, from which pearls have been taken of some value. 

Geology. — The rock most common here consists of strata of 
the transition class, including not only the slateband, but also the 
hard compost strata, called greywacke, which is similar to the blue 
whinstone of Galloway. The schistus is formed of strata contain- 
ing substances very unlike each other. This stone exists in beds, 
varying from half an inch to many feet in thickness, and is mixed in 

KIRKCUDBRIGHT. • N 



194 



KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE, 



endless proportions with the slate-band. Their strata lie in every di- 
rection, from being perfectly vertical to nearly horizontal. They are 
sometimes found united to veins of porphyry, and run in a direction 
from east- north-east to west-south-west. The highest parts of the 
Stewartry consist entirely of granite, to the extent of miles, which 
sometimes runs in veins among the strata of schistus. 

The soil lying on graiu'te is generally barren. The degree of 
fertility of the schistus district seems very much to follow the 
proportion of slate-band in the rock below it. The hills of gravel 
and tile are covered with a soil similar to the mosses of which they 
are composed. 

From the rocky nature of the country it is every where abundant- 
ly supplied with stones for building and draining ; but, unless at 
Kirkbean, I am not aware of any place where limestone has been 
wrought. All the freestone employed is brought from beyond 
Dumfries, a distance of twenty miles. It is only, therefore, sought 
for expensive houses, to furnish door and window ribbets and lintels. 
Many of the houses in Galloway are damp and liable to smoke. 
There is a slate quarry at Parton, which is most convenient for the 
neighbourhood. There are no circumstances indicating that coals 
exist in the district. 

Zoology. — A small breed of horses, from twelve to fourteen hands 
high, was formerly common, and held in high estimation in Gal- 
loway. There being little occasion to employ them in the draught, 
they travelled quickly and safely, in a rugged and mountainous 
country. The ancient breed is now almost lost. Horses of greater 
weight became necessary, as those every way fitted for predatory 
excursions ceased to be of peculiar value for the operose processes 
of agriculture. Their colour is generally a light bay or brown, 
with black legs ; their heads were unusually small, and their whole 
form indicated a capability of enduring great fatigue. The horses 
now to be found in Galloway, with the exception of being rather 
smaller in size, differ little from those found throughout Scotland. 
In the cart, they are all yoked single. 

Galloway has long been distinguished for a peculiar breed of 
cattle, and, from the soil and climate being peculiarly adapted for 
rearing them, they have received great attention. They are uni- 
versally almost without horns, less than the horned breed of Lan- 
cashire, but larger than those in the West Highlands, and beanng 
a very considerable resemblance to the cattle peculiar to Angus- 
shire. Their general colour is black. In the dairies in the neigh- 



CROSSMICHAEL. 195 

bourhood, cows of the Ayrshire breed only are kept, each of which 
is expected to yield about seven pounds a year from milk, butter, 
and cheese. 

The farmers in Galloway now raise a large number of swine, 
which they kill in the winter and spring, and sell at Dumfries, where 
there is generally a quick demand, and always ready money. A 
considerable part of the rent of small farms is made in this way. 

Sheep are every year increasing in numbers, from the great use 
now made of bone-dust as a manure. They in general pay well. 

Plantations. — Plantations of larch are becoming common, and 
they thrive well; giving to some parts a great degree of richness 
and beauty, which otherwise would have been uninteresting and 
useless. 

II. — Civil History. 

In Symson's description of Galloway, there are some important 
particulars regarding this parish stated ; and a few things con- 
nected with it may be found in Hay's MS., in Keith, in the In- 
quisit. Speciales ; but by far the fullest and best history of Gallo- 
way is to be found in Chalmers' Caledonia. The former Statisti- 
cal Account was written by the late Mr Johnstone, formerly minis- 
ter of the parish ; and is marked by those clear and correct state- 
ments which characterized the speeches and writings of that able 
and eloquent individual. The only map ever drawn of this parish, 
as far as I know, is that of Mr William M'Artenay, of which only 
two copies existed : it is dated in the year 1771. 

Land-owners. — There are 28 heritors in the parish, of whom 16 
hold land above L.50 in value yearly. Of these two are resident, 
and some of the others visit their estates for a short period. 

Antiquities. — There formerly existed ten tumuli in this neigh- 
bourhood, in some of which human bones of a large size were found, 
and there are some remains of ancient and later fortifications. ' 
The foundation of a large convent was long ago discovered, of 
which nothing is known. Roman urns and warlike instruments 
have been found in ploughing and digging the land. 

The following has been communicated by Joseph Train, Esq., 
Castle- Douglas : — 

" There are in no other part of the stewartry of Kirkcudbright 
so many vestiges of remote antiquity to be seen in the same space, 
as in the parish of Crossmichael. Between the rivers Dee and 
Urr, within a circuit of two miles, are six moats, some of which 
are very large, conspicuous, and entire. That on the farm of Ger- 



196 



KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIllE. 



ranton differs a little in form from the rest, having one side curved 
inwards, whereas the others are all of a circular or oval form, and, 
what is very singular, each of three moats has a road-way to the 
summit hy a sloping passage towards the east. 
- " Within a distance of two miles may also be seen thirteen large 
sepulchral cairns, in some of which stone-coffins, containing hu- 
man bones, have been found; and on a steepy crag, overhanging 
the margin of Loch Roan, are the remains of an ancient hill-fort, 
yet called by the country people the Auld Kirk of Loch Roan. 

« In an adjacent field, there were ploughed up, a few years ago, 
two ancient spear-heads, and lately, in the farm of Kilnotrie, was 
turned up, by the plough, a Roman battle-axe of bronze, of fine 
workmanship. It is now in the possession of Mr James Na. 
pier of Greenlaw. 

" Near Glenlochar Bridge was also turned up, by the plough, 
several years ago, the head of a caparisoned war-horse in bronze, 
evidently of Roman manufacture. This unique remnant of anti- 
quity is now in the possession of Colonel James Gordon of Cul- 
vennan. 

" In the farm of Hallferne was found lately, near the large moat, 
a beautiful Druidical amulet, such as the country people call an ad- 
der bead. It is of a circular form, nearly an inch in diameter, and 
is composed of a pale-coloured glassy substance, having on the sur- 
face all around a waving stripe of yellow. Popular credulity hav- 
ino-, in olden times, derived the origin of the ' quht stane of cris- 
ta' from a mysterious combination of serpents, its virtues were 
considered universal, whether as an antidote, palliative, or cure. 
By the kindness of Mr Clark, the present occupant of the farm of 
Hallferne, this relic has fallen into my possession. 

« There have been found, at different times, near the same place, 
several round flat stones, each five or six inches diameter, perfo - 
rated artificially in the centre. Even within the memory of some 
persons yet alive, these perforated stones were used in Galloway 
to counteract the supposed effects of witchcraft, particularly ui 
horses and black-cattle. ' The canie wife o' Glengappock put a 
boirt stane into ane tub filled withe water, and causit syne the haill 
cattell to pass by, and, when passing, springled ilk ane o them 
with a besome dipped in it.' One of these perforated stones, as 
black and glossy as polished ebony, is also in my possession. It 
Jas recentfy found in the ruins of an old byre, where it had evi- 
dently been placed for the protection of the cattle. It appears to

be exactly similar to that found between the Dee and the Urr, 
and presented to the Antiquarian Society of Scotland in the year 
1782 by Alexander Copland, Esq. of Coliston." See Caledonia, 

Vol. iii. p. 233. 

The present church was built in 1751, and has been repeatedly 
enlarged and repaired since. The manse was built in 1744, and 
has received two large additions and frequent repairs since that 
period. There are three mansion-houses in the parish of consi- 
derable size and elegance, on the estate of Greenlaw, Mollance 
and Danevale. 

III. — Population. 
Upwards of eighty years ago, the population amounted to 613. 
In January 1791, it amounted to 772. In 1831, it had increased 
to 1325; and when the last census was taken in 1841, it amount- 
ed to 1320. 

Smuggling long ago existed in Galloway, but has now disap- 
peared ; but poaching in game is still persevered in by a few idle 
and otherwise ill-disposed persons, in spite of the punishment 
which is occasionally inflicted upon them. Many young men have 
hitherto been in the habit of going from Galloway to England, 
and becoming travelling dealers in tea or cloth, some of whom, 
by their persevering and regular habits, have succeeded in accu- 
mulating a few thousand pounds. These fortunate adventurers 
generally return to spend the latter part of their days in their na- 
tive land, and are very respectable members of society. 

The little distance between this place and Ireland has induced 
many of the needy and forward adventurers of that country to mi- 
grate thither in a state of great poverty and ignorance, which, in 
many instances, has a most injurious effect on those with whom 
they are led to associate. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — Many parts of the parish are susceptible of great 
improvement, which, from the amount of the necessary outlay, 
would require to be executed by the proprietors. These im- 
provements would consist chiefly of draining ; and, from the re- 
tentive nature of the subsoil in many places, the drains would 
require to be very numerous. The practice, too, of taking in 
succession a number of corn crops, ought to be abandoned, and 
the land more carefully cleared of weeds and stones. The prac- 
tice of feeding sheep with turnip on the ground, is becoming 
very common. Large quantities of bone-dust are yearly or- 



198 



KIIlKCUD13RlGHTSHIRF,c 



dered, and easily deposited in places to which common manure 
could be driven with difficulty. The appearance of many parts 
of the country has, in consequence, been entirely changed, and, 
from this cause, the agriculture of Galloway has received a 
greater impulse than from any other that could be assigned. The 
quantity of bone-dust usually given to an acre is from 18 to 30 
bushels, while, in other parts of Scotland, where that manure has 
been longer in use, not more than 12 or 15 bushels are frequently 
allowed. In Galloway, the whole of the turnips are generally 
consumed on the ground, while, in Perthshire and Forfarshire, a- 
half or two-thirds are given to cattle in the feeding byre. The 
new manure called guano has now been repeatedly tried and found 
to answer in almost every instance beyond expectation. Many 
of the farm -buildings are insufficient. The fences are often in- 
securely built, which must often be the source of great annoyance. 
Thorns are often planted in the dikes, which, in many instances, 
protect and perpetuate the fence. 

Rent of Land.— The average rent of arable land in this parish 
is about 1 6s., and bog and hill land 5s. per acre. 

The duration of leases is generally for fifteen years. In many 
instances, the farms are let at too high rents, and which seldom 
fail to injure both landlords and tenants. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Filiates. — There are two villages in the parish, Crossmichael 
and Clarebrand,— the former containing about 240, and the lat- 
ter about 50 inhabitants. 

Pos-Oce.— There is a penny post in the village of Cross- 
michael. 

dieans of Communication.— The greatest length of turnpike 
roads is about five miles. 

Ecclesiastical State.— Our church is at the west side of the pa- 
rish, about a mile from where it joins with Parton on the north, 
and about three miles and a-half from where it meets with Kelton 
on the south. It is seated for about 650, and there are 18 free 
sittings in it. Originally, the glebe consisted of five acres and a- 
half, to which other 10 have been added. In 1755, the living, 
on an average, was L.67, 4s. 4d. In 1798, it amounted to L.174, 
16s. Id., being the most valuable in the stewartry. In 1814, the 
stipend was fixed, the teinds being exhausted, at L.269, 15s. lOjd. 
payable in money in equal proportions, at Whitsunday and Mar- 
tinmas. The glebe is worth about L.28 annually. At the south-

ern extremity of the parish, and adjoining the town of Castle 
Douolas, a chapel in connection with the Relief Synod has exist- 
ed for a few years. It is not understood to be in a flounshuig 
condition, its members being few, and those not in affluent cir- 
cumstances. Two families belong to the Secession, five or six to 
the Cameronians, and three or four to the Catholic churches. A 
number have joined or are in the habit of frequently attending the 
Free Church in Castle Douglas. The collections in the church 
for the poor of the parish amount to about L.40 annually. A col- 
lection is annually made in the church for the support of the 
schemes of the General Assembly. 

Education.— There are two parochial schools in the parish, and 
in one of them no fees are exacted. There are two other schools. 
In our first parochial school, nearly the maximum salary is given 
by the heritors, along with a house and garden, and all the usual 
branches of education are taught in it successfully, along with 
French, Greek, Latin, and geography, with the use of the globes. 
The other was built and endowed by William Gordon, Esq., 
merchant in Bristol, in 1735. The endowment, which is only 
L.U, being unable to support a teacher and his family, he was 
induced, in 1775, to petition the Commissioners of Supply, when 
he obtained a legal salary of 200 merks Scots. Of late, the 
school-house has been enlarged, and the dwelling-house is com- 
fortable, to which a good garden is attached. No fees are ex- 
acted from children belonging to the parish ; but small gratuities 
are given at Candlemas. English, writing, and arithmetic, are 
the only branches taught in it. 

There is a parochial library in the parish. In 1792 a Brotherly 
Society was instituted for the benefit of those connected with it, 
when visited with sickness. It also gave assistance to the widows 
of those who had been members. Like many other institu- 
tions of the same kind, it failed in securing for its members the 
ends they had in view, and the whole of its funds were divided 
among them a few years ago. 

Savings' Bank. — A national security savings' bank has now for 
a few years been established in Castle Douglas, and is at present 
in a most flourishing condition. 

Poor. — The average number of persons receiving parochial aid 
amounts to about twenty-three, and the average sum per quarter 
allotted to-each amounts to about 13s. In a few instances only, 



KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIOE. 



I have been able to see any decided reluctance, in persons in re- 
duced circumstances, to receive aid from the poor's funds. 

Inns, — There are four houses in the parish where spirits are re- 
tailed. 

Fuel. — The fuel used by the lower classes is mostly peats, which 
are carted three or four miles, with an occasional supply of wood 
and coals.

PRESBYTERY OF KIRKCUDBRIfillT, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER CROSBIE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — " Various opinions," says Mr Maxwell, in the former 
Statistical Account of Scotland, ' are entertained as to the deri- 
vation of the name. Some have thought that Boot-hill or Butt- 
hill was the original name of that territory which now composes 
the parish of Buittle, on account of the frequent musters of cavalry 
or archers that must have taken place in the vicinity of the castle 
after-mentioned. With as much probability, however, it may be 
suggested, that the word Buittle is but a contraction of Bowet-hill 
or Bowet-hall, an appellation occasioned by the beacons in the 
neighbourhood of the castle alluded to, or from the great light 
which it displayed on festive or solemn occasions." In Chalmers's 
Caledonia, Vol. iii. p. 316, it is stated, that " the word Buittle is 
obviously the Anglo-Saxon Botle, domicilium valla. This Anglo- 
Saxon word appears very often in the topography both of England 
and Scotland, as Bootle near Liverpool, Bootle in Cumberland, 
Wall-bootle on Severus' wall, New-bootle in Mid-Lothian, El-bootle 
in East- Lothian, and Mer-botle, which is now Morbattle, in Rox- 
burghshire." 

Boundaries. — The parish is bounded on the north, by the parishes 
of Crossmichael and Kelton ; on the south, by the bay of Orchard- 
ton ; on the east, by the parishes of Urr and Colvend, from which 
it is separated by the river Urr; and on the west, by a small 
stream which separates it from Kelton and Rerwick. The river 
Dee, which runs past Kirkcudbright, may, at some remote period, 



BUITTLE. 



201 



by flowincT -through Carllnwark loch and Glengagrie, and falling 
into the s"ea at Orchardton bay, have fornied the boundary on the 
west side. This supposition is strengthened, and in some mea- 
sure confirmed, by there being a place on this hne denommated the 
Doagh, which would then have been a station for catchmg salmon. 
Besides, when the river Dee is swollen, it flows into Carhnwark 
loch, and nothing prevents the water issuing from that loch m this 
direction, but a narrow ridge of accumulated gravel at Burntstick, 
elevated a few feet above its present level. The length of the pa- 
rish from north to south is 10 miles, and its breadth, which is ir- 
regular, may average about 3 miles. 

Topographical Appearance. — The surface is finely diversi- 
fied with hill and dale, and though it does not abound with 
grand and sublime prospects, affords much beautiful and pictur- 
esque scenery. In the lower and middle districts, the ground is 
broken and uneven, and frequently juts out into steep banks and 
rocky knolls covered with furze and broom. In the upper dis- 
trict, it presents a more level and arable appearance. 

It is evident that the sea has receded from this coast, and that 
at a former period it must have flowed up the Urr, as far as 
Furth-head, or Frith-head, two miles from its present boundary, 
and considerably above its present elevation at high water, cover- 
ing a great extent of ground on each of its banks. 

Climate. — The climate is mild and salubrious, as the longevity 
of many of the parishioners testifies. There are at present eight 
individuals about 90 years of age ; and sixteen individuals, either 
upwards of 80 or approaching nearly to that age. Twelve years 
ago, one individual died at the age of 103. There are no diseases 
peculiar to the parish. 

Woods. — The cultivation of wood has been greatly extended 
during the last forty years, and might be profitably extended still 
farther. Much ground, at present waste and uncultivated, and 
many places naked and exposed to every blast, might be protected 
and sheltered, and rendered capable of producing both grain and 
pasture of a better quality. The soil, climate, and situation are 
in general well adapted for planting and raising wood, as the ra- 
pid growth of various kinds of trees testifies. In some of the 
woods at Munshes, there are larches of thirty years' growth, girth- 
ing four feet and a-half at three feet from the ground ; some of 
the poplar and willow tribes, not yet twenty years planted, girth- 
ing four feet. The Spanish chestnut thrives well, and increases 



202 



KIRKCUDHHIGIITSHIHE. 



rapidly, — trees of tliis species, not above tliitty years planted, 
gfirthing four feet. The Scotch firs are of large size, and highly 
ornamental. There are also oaks containing upwards of 100 feet 
of timber, and beeches 160 feet. 

Although the larch grows vigorously for a time, it has not any 
where in the parish attained to a large size. There are larches 
at Mnnshes, from seventy to eighty years of age, which would not 
yield more than 40 or 50 feet of timber. Most of them are evi- 
dently not in a healthy state. 

Upwards of 100 acres of natural wood, on the estate of Klrk- 
ennan, are now in the course of being cut down. This wood con- 
sists of oak, ash, birch, &amp;c. It is thirty years old. 

The woods on the estates of Kirkennan, Barlochan, Almer- 
ness, and Castlegower, are from one to thirty-five years planted. 
There is wood on the estate of Munshes much older. All the 
woods in the parish consist chiefly of oak. Yearly thinning and 
pruning, though in some places neglected, have in general been 
well attended to.

At Hopehead, on the line of the old military road from Castle 
Douglas to Dumfries, there is a common plane tree, known by the 
name of the Forge-tree, equalled by few if any, in this neighbour- 
hood. It girths 10 feet at three feet and a-half from the ground. 
Its branches extend horizontally, and form an exact circle of 76 
feet in diameter, the extremities of which are not more than five feet 
from the ground. The top is of a conical shape, and, when covered 
with foliage, affords an agreeable shade, and presents a magnificent 
appearance. There are no records from which its precise age can 
be ascertained ; but, according to tradition, it was a full-grown tree 
in the reign of King William III. ; and it may have derived its name 
from His Majesty having passed that road with his army on his way 
to Ireland, and his cavalry having erected a forge there for the pur- 
pose of shoeing their horses. The trunk contains 100 feet, and the 
branches upwards of 200 feet of measurable timber. There is a 



BUITTLE. 



203 



considerable cavity above the first row of branches, the depth of 
which has not been ascertained, owing to its being filled with 
stones. This is the only mark which it exhibits of decay. 

At Little Knox, in the immediate vicinity of the church, there 
is a variegated plane tree, which girths 11 feet at three feet and 
a-half from the ground, and contains upwards of 200 feet of solid 
wood. Whether the variegation in the foliage of this tree has 
been accidentally produced, or has been effected by budding or 
engrafting, is not known ; perhaps the former supposition is the 
correct one. This description of plane does not propagate its 
own variety. It sheds seed around it, which produces abundance 
of plants. Some of these were found, having the first tree leaves 
variegated like the parent tree. They were selected and trans- 
planted, with the view of raising variegated planes ; but, beyond 
the two first tree leaves, the variegation did not extend. 

II. — Civil History. 
" The castle of Buittle, says Mr Maxwell in the former Sta- 
tistical Account of Scotland, is assuredly the most considerable re- 
mains of antiquity in the parish. Some have affirmed that it was for- 
merly called the Castle of Knare, Nare, or Bar-nare, and was the 
chief residence of the Reguli of Galloway. An adjoining hill, 
named Craig-nair, gives some weight to this supposition. Certain it 
is, however, that the ruins of Buittle Castle denote it to have been 
a place of strength and even magnificence. The vaults and 
ditches are all that remain of this proud structure. Besides the 
Castle of Buittle, the only other remembrance of ages equally 
rude and remote, is one of those ruins commonly called vitrified 
forts, standing on the north-west border of Buittle parish, within 
a farm called Castlegower, which lies along the march of Kelton." 

IVtlls. — There are two wells in this parish, mentioned in Sym- 
son's description of Galloway, as having been, at a former pe- 
riod, much resorted to by valetudinarians on the first Sunday of 
May. One of these wells, called the Rumbling Well, is situat- 
ed within the farm of Buittle Mains, on the march of Little 
Knox and Guffocgland, and its water was considered to be a pa- 
nacea for the cure of all diseases which afflict the human body. 
The other well is supposed to be situated on the march between 
Buittle Mains and Buittle Place, and was held in estimation for 
the cure of a disease called the Connach, which affects cattle. 
These wells issue out of rocks, and discharge copious streams of 
pure water. Like many of the wells in this parish, they partake 



201 



KIRKCUDBRIGHTSriinE. 



more or less of a chalybeate nature ; but tliey do not appear to 
be so much impregnated, by any mineral substance, which could 
in the least degree prove more efficacious in the cure of disease 
than any other well in the neighbourhood ; and the belief in those 
supernatural qualities, with which superstition had invested them, 
being dispelled, they have long ceased to be resorted to by invalids.  
Parochial Registers. — These consist of minutes of the kirk ses- 
sion, and of the records of marriages and baptisms. They com- 
menced in 1736, and were regularly kept till 1780. From 1780 
to 1807, the record of baptisms is somewhat defective. From 
1736 to 1807, the date of the baptism is always entered ; that of 
the birth only occasionally. Since 1807, the date of both the 
birth and baptism is recorded. The average number of marriages 
for the last three years is 6 ; of baptisms for the same period, 
22 ; of deaths, 7. The register of baptisms is not so complete 
as it ought to have been, owing to Dissenters not choosing to en- 
ter the births of their children in the parish register. The entries 
are chiefly made by parents belonging to the Established Church.

 « In this parish of Bootle, about a mile from the kirk, towards the north, is a 
well, called the Rumbling Well, frequented by a multitude of sick people for all 
sorts of diseases, on the first Sunday of May, lying there the Saturday night, and 
then drinking of it early in the morning. There is also another well, about a quar- 
ter of a mile distant, towards the east. This well is made use of by the country 
people when their cattell are troubled with a disease called by them the eonnach 
This water they carry in vessells to many parts, and wash their beasts with it, and 
cive it them to drink. It is, too, rememb'red, that, at both the wells, they leave be- 
hind them something by way of a thank-offering. At the first, they leave either mo- 
ncy or clothes ; at the second, they leave the bands and shades wherewith beasts aic 
usually bound." — Symson'i Description of Galloway, page I'e.

Proprietors.— There are 15 proprietors of land belonging to 
the parish whose properties are of the yearly value of L.50 and 
upwards, of which 7 reside in it, and 8 are non-resident. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture.-T\ioug\i farm produce has not for several years 
past yielded a remunerating price, yet both landlords and tenants 
have adopted and prosecuted every plan of modern improvement 
with a degree of eagerness, perseverance, and success, not sur- 
passed in any other part of the country. The turnip husbandry 
is greatly extended beyond what it was a few years ago. Feeding 
of sheep, for the last five or six years, has, with the exception of 
1834, been profitable to the farmer; and the facility with which 
they are conveyed to the Liverpool market, by means of steam 
vessels, has contributed to produce this result. The kinds of 
grain raised in this parish consist of oats, barley, and wheat. 
The cultivation of wheat is chiefly confined to the clay soil, on 
the banks of the Urr and Bay of Orchardton. On the dry and 
lighter soils, adapted to turnip husbandry, barley is extensively 
cultivated. The chevalier barley was introduced about three 
years ago, and bids fair to exclude the common sort, which was 
formerly, and still is cultivated. It is considered to be a finer 
grain, more productive, and of greater weight per bushel. The 
rotation of crops most approved of on land under tillage is a white 
and green crop alternately, though in some instances the practice 
of taking two white crops in succession is followed. Besides the 
manure which the farm affords, hme and bone-dust are employed 
to stimulate and fertilize the soil. 

The breeding and rearing of cattle is an object of great import- 
ance to the farmers, as they generally calculate on realizing a con- 
siderable part of their profits from this source. Our well-known 
breed of Galloway cattle bears a higher character, in almost every 
point, than any other. It yields beef, which, when well fed, is of 
the first-rate quality, and is said to bring, in the Smithfield mar- 
ket, a higher price, by at least Is. per stone, than the best beef 
of England. The carcase weighs, on an average, from 50 to 60 
stones, and, in some instances, 100 stones and upwards. Few 
Galloway bullocks are fed in this parish. They are generally sold 
to the cattle-dealers at two or three years old, and driven to Eng- 
land, where they are fed for the English markets. On three farms 
in this parish, the Ayrshire dairy system has been partially adopt- 
ed with success. 



KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE. 



The farmers hold their lands by leases varying in duration from 
fifteen to nineteen years, and pay rents from L.50 to L.700 per 
annum. There are several small patches of less value. The 
farms are enclosed by stone dikes, sunk fences, or hedge-rows. 
The real rent of the parish, independent of the value of woods and 
plantations, as taken in 1830, was upwards of L.8000 per annum. 
The valued rent in Scotch money is L..'3461 per annum. 

Rate of Wages. — Male servants, who reside in their master's 
house, are paid from L.IO to L.12 per annum. Female servants 
are paid from L.6 to L.7 per annum. The rate of a labourer's 
wages during summer is Is. 6d. per day, and during winter Is. 3d. 
per day, without victuals. Women, during summer, earn 9d. per 
day ; during winter, they are seldom employed at outSeld work. 
Masons, '2s. 6d. per day ; carpenters, 2s. 

The subjoined letter, written by the late John Maxwell, Esq. 
of Munshes, to the late W. M. Herries, Esq. of Spottes, and pub- 
lished in the appendix to the first and only report of the Stewartry 
Agricultural Society in the year 1810, shows the state of society, 
the value of land, and the condition of agriculture, in this parish 
and neighbourhood, upwards of a century ago. As the report al- 
luded to had only a local circulation, and is now entirely unknown, 
it is thought proper, for the preservation of so valuable a letter, to 
insert it in the Statistical Account. Mr Maxwell was a native of 
this parish, and died at Munshes in 1814, at the age of ninety- 
four.  

 Munshes, February B, 1811. 

Dear Sir, The last time that Mr Young of Youngfield was here, he signified to 

me, as you had previously done, that John Christian Curwen of Workington Hall, 
Esq. had mentioned, that he was very desirous of knowing the state of agriculture in 
the stewartry of Kirkcudbright, and in Nithsdale, as far back as my remembrance 
goes. 

I was born at Buittle, in this parish, which, in old times, was the fortress and re- 
sidence of John Baliol, on the 7th day of February, old style, 1720, and. do distinctly 
remember several circumstances that happened in the year 1723 and 1724. Of these 
particulars, the falling of the bridge of Buittle, which was built by John Frew in 
1722, and fell in the succeeding summer while I was in Buittle garden seeing my fa- 
ther's servants gathering nettles. That same year many of the proprietors enclosed 
their grounds to stock them with black cattle, and, by that means, turned out a vast 
number of tenants at the term of W hitsunday 1723, whereby numbers of them be- 
came destitute, and, in consequence, rose in a mob; when, with pitchforks, gavcllocks, 
and spades, they levelled the park-dikes of Barncailzie and Munshes, at Dalbeattie, 
which 1 saw with my own eyes. I'he mob passed by Dalbeattie and Buittle, and did 
the same on the estates of Netherlaw, Dunrod, &amp;c., and the Laird of Murdoch, then 
proprietor of Kilwhaneday, who turned out sixteen families at that term. The pro- 
prietors rose, with the servants and dependents, to quell this mob, but were not ot 
sufficient force to do it, and were obliged to send for two troops of dragoons from 
Kdinburgh, who, upon their appearing, the mob dispersed. After that, warrants 
were granted for apprehending many of the tenants and persons concerned in the 
said mob. Several of them were tried, those who had any funds were fined, some

Rent of Land, — The average rent of land varies from 15s. to L.l, 
10s. per acre, according to soil and situation ; hill pasture from 3s. to 

were banished to the plantations, whilst others were imprisoned, and it brought great 
distress upon this part of the country. At that period, justice was not -very properly 
administered ; for a respectable man of the name of M'Clacherty, who lived in Ual- 
maghie parish, was concerned in the mob, and, on his being brought to trial, one of 
the justices admired a handsome Galloway which he rode, and the justice told him. if 
he would give him the Galloway, he would effect his acquittal, which he accordingly did. 
This misfortune, with what happened to the Mississippi Company in the year 1720, 
did most generally distress this quarter of the kingdom. It is not pleasant to repre- 
sent the wretched state of individuals as times then went in Scotland. The tenants, 
in general, lived very meanly on kail, groats, milk, graddon ground in querns turn- 
ed by the hand, and the grain dried in a pot, together with a crook ewe now and 
then about Martinmas. They were clothed very plainly, and their habitations were 
most uncomfortable. Their general wear was of cloth, made of waulked plaiding, 
black and white wool mixed, very coarse, and the cloth rarely dyed. Their hose were 
made of white plaiding cloth sewed together, with single-soled shoes, and a black or 
blue bonnet, — none having hats but the lairds, who thought themselves very well 
dressed for going to church on Sunday with a black kelt-coat of their wife's making. 
It is not proper for me here to narrate the distress and poverty that were felt in the 
country during these times, which continued till about the year 1735. In 1725, po- 
tatoes were first introduced into this stewartry by William Hyland, from Ireland, 
who carried them on horses' hacks to Edinburgh, where he sold thenn by pounds and 
ounces. During these times, when potatoes were not generally raised in the coun- 
try, there was, for the most part, a great scarcity of food, bordering on famine ; for, 
in the stewartry of Kirkcudbright and county of Dumfries, there was not as much 
victual produced as was necessary for supplying the inhabitants, and the chief part of 
what was required for that purpose, was brought from the sand beds of Esk in tum- 
bling cars, on the Wednesdays, to Dumfries ; and when the waters were high, by 
reason of spates, and there being no bridges, so that these cars could not come with 
the meal, 1 have seen the tradesmen's wives in the streets of Dumfries crying, be- 
cause there was none to be got. At that period, there was only one baker in Dum- 
fries, and he made bawbee baps of coarse flour, chiefly bran, which he occasionally 
carried in creels to the fairs of Urr and Kirkpatrick. The produce of the country, in 
general, was gray corn, and you might have travelled from Dumfries to Kirkcud- 
bright, which s twenty-seven miles, without seeing any other grain, except in a gen- 
tleman's croft, which, in general, produced bear or big for one-third part, another 
third in white oats, and the remaining third in gray oats. At that period, there was 
no wheat raised in the country ; what was used was brought from Teviot, and it was 
believed that the soil would not produce wheat. In the year 1735, there was no mill 
in the country for grinding that sort of grain, and the first flour mill that was con- 
structed in these bounds, was built by old Heron at Clouden, in the parish of Iron- 
gray, some years after that date. 

In these times, cattle were also very low. I remember of being present at the 
Bridge-end of Dumfries in 1736, when Anthony M'Kie of Netherlaw sold five score 
of five year old Galloway cattle, in good condition, to an Englishman, at L.2, 12s. 6d. 
each ; and old Robert Halliday, who was tenant of a great part of the Preston es- 
tate, told me, that he reckoned he could graze his cattle on his farms for 2s. 6d. a 
head, that is to say, that his rent corresponded to that sum. 

At this period, few of the proprietors gave themselves any concern anent the ar- 
ticles of husbandry, — their chief one being about black-cattle. William Craik, Esq. 
of Arbigland's father died in 1735, and his son was a man of uncommon accomplish- 
ments, who, in his younger days, employed his time in grazing of cattle, and studying 
the shapes of the best kinds, — his father having given him the farm of Maxwelltown 
to live upon. The estate of Arbigland was then in its natural state, very much co- 
vered with whins and broom, and yielding little rent, being only about 3000 merks 
a year. That young gentleman was among the first that undertook lo improve the 
soil ; and the practice of husbandry which he pursued, together with the care and 
trouble which he took in ameliorating his farm, was very great. Some of it he 
brought to such perfection, by clearing off all weeds and stones, and pulverized it so 

 18 merks make L.l Sterling, or L.12 Scots.

lOs. per acre. A cow may be grazed during summer for L.3, and 
a sheep pastured at the rate of 6s. The average charge for feed- 
ing a full-grown sheep, on clover after harvest, and turnips during 
winter, is 3d. per week ; young sheep, 2d. per week. 

The gross amount of raw produce raised in the parish cannot 
be ascertained with any degree of accuracy. 

Mosses. — The greatest part of the tract of flat land lying along 
the river Urr, from Craignair-hill to the march of Kirkennan, ex- 
tending to nearly 400 acres, was, about seventy years ago, an un- 
improved moss, of little or no value. The late Mr George Max- 
well of Munshes commenced its improvement, by cutting large 
open drains, and putting in a number of covered drains filled with 
heath. For many years, he kept a boat constantly employed in 
bringing up sea-shells, from extensive shell banks at the mouth of 
the river. The boat carried nine cart-loads, for which he paid 6s. 
These shells were discharged along the sides of the river ; and he 
took his tenants bound to cart and apply to their respective farms 
a certain quantity annually. Their effects upon the moss were 
most astonishing. They destroyed the heath, and when ploughed, 
the ground from the outset brought good crops. The use of 
shells has been completely given up for that of lime. But many 
are of opinion, that, on wet land in particular, shells are a better, 
a more gradual, and a more lasting stimulant than lime. 

The moss in question lay to the depth of many feet, on a blue 
clay. In some parts, the moss was removed by burning'; but with- 
out this, the drainage and tillage have had the effect of consoli- 
dating and exhausting it ;"so that moss, formerly three or four feet 
deep, has nearly disappeared, and now the plough generally reaches 
the clay. Thus the moss and clay are incorporated into a fertile 

completely, that I, on walking over the surface, sunk as if I had trodden on new fallen 



snow. 



The estate of Arbigland was bought by his grandfather, in 1722, from the Earl of 
Southesk, for 22,000 merks. .. . , c c ■ a i 

In 1733, there were only two carts for hire in the town of Dumfries, and one be- 
longing to a private gentleman. r t -u- 

About the years 1737 and 1738, there was almost no hme used for building m 
Dumfries, except a little shell-lime, made of cockle-shells, burned at Colvend, and 
brought to Dumfries in bags, a distance of twenty miles ; and, in 1 740, when 1 . o- 
vost Bell built his house, the under storey was built with clay, and the upper storeys 
with lime, brought from Whitehaven in dry-ware casks. There was then no hme 
used for improvilig the land. In 1749, I had day-labourers at 6d. per day, and the 
best masons at Is. This was at the building of Mollance House,— the walls of which

black mould. John H. Maxwell of Munshes, the present pro-' 
prietor, has, by a judicious system of tile-draining, and other ex- 
tensive improvements, greatly ameliorated this soil, and added 
much to the beauty of the landscape. 

About thirty- five years ago, the proprietors of the adjoining 
estates expended L. 500 in widening and deepening the drain 
which forms the outlet of Kenmore loch, on the confines of Kel- 
ton. This drain is upwards of a mile in length, and in some places 
consisted chiefly of rock. About sixty acres of moss, liable to be 
covered with water, were thereby converted into productive mea- 

• The following information was most obligingly communicated by Mr Train of 
Castle Douglas, well known to the world as a zealous antiquary : 

" A short time ago, some labourers, while draining a moss near Munshes, turned 
up, at the distance of several feet from the surface, the horns of a urus. Only one of 
these has been preserved. From its very large dimensions, however, some idea may 
be formed of the corresponding size of the animal. It measures fifteen inches in 
circumference round the but-end, and its present length is twenty-six inches, although 
it might have been originally thirty inches. It weighs seven pounds ten ounces. It 
is well known that the urus, which has now been ascertained by naturalists to be of 
the same species with the bison, was, at an early period, an inhabitant of this coun- 
try. A horn of the urus was found near Dunkeld, and is now in the possession of 
the Duke of Athole. Two horns and a part of the head of the same animal were, 
some years ago, discovered in the parish of Borgue, and are now at St Mary's Isle, 
tlie seat of the Earl of Selkirk. But the only entire head and horns that seem to 
have yet been discovered, were dug out of a marl-pit on the estate of Castlewig, in 
Wigtonshire. This very interesting relic was presented by Mr Hawthorn, the pro- 
prietor, to Mr Train of Castle Douglas, who again presented it to Sir Walter Scotti 
and it may still be seen at Abbotsford. The interesting horn first alluded to is in the 
possession of Mr Train. 

" In August 1843, there was discovered at the estuary of the river Urr, within 
high water-naark, and adjoining the farm of Nethertown, the fossil head of a bison, 
of the following dimensions : — 

Length of the head, - - 33 inches. 

Distance between the points of the horns, - 32 
Circumference of horn at the but, - 1 3 

Breadth of the head between the eyes, - I J 
pockets of the eyes, - - 3 

" In 1841, there was found at Barlochan a Roman coin of Constantine the Great 
in a high state of preservation, which Mr Train has in his possession. ' 

« In the summer of 1838, an urn or kirtvean was turned up by the plou-h on the 
farm of Breoch. This ancient repository of the ashes of the dead is made'of baked 
clay, coarsely ornamented. It is nine inches in diameter, six inches deep, and nearly 
an mch thick. It contained a quantity of black ashes, and fragments of bones, which 
are carefully preserved by Mr Maxwell, the proprietor of Breoch. I have in my 
possession the only remaining 'part of the urn; but, since its exposure to the air, 
It has lost much of its calcined adhesiveness, as it crumbles on being removed, how- 
ever slightly. 

" In the spring of the year 1839, a labourer employed in clearing away a bank of 
earth on the margin of the water of Urr, near the site of the old castle of Buittle 
once the residence of Kdward Baliol, laid bare with his spade a large block of red 
sandstone, on which the figure of a regularly formed female countenance, surrounded 
by ornamental wreathes in bas-relief, is exquisitely carved. The peculiar quality of 
this stone shows that it must have been brought from a distance of nearly twenty 
miles to Buittle Castle, of which it evidently formed a part. It may now be seen in 
the garden of Mr Marchbank at New Buittle.

dow. This expensive work was also undertaken with the view of 
gaining access to a bed of marl which the loch contains. But, 
though the water was nearly all carried off the surface of the loch, 
yet the moss was not laid sufficiently dry to admit of cartage, 
and this treasure has not hitherto been obtained. 

At Barwhinnie loch, near Palnackie, six acres of moss, covered 
with water, were lately, by draining and cultivation, converted into 
meadow of the richest quality. 

Embankments. — Twenty acres of carse land, on the banks of the 
Urr, and bay of Orchardton, subject to be flooded at high spring- 
tides, have been embanked, and rendered fit for cultivation. Land 
to a greater extent, on the estates of Orchardton and Almerness, 
was enclosed by embankments; but these having been ill con- 
structed, or insufficiently executed, were soon broken down, and 
rendered useless. 

Quarries— K granite quarry was opened, about ten years ago, 
on Craignair-hill, by the Liverpool Dock Trustees, under favour- 
able auspices, and this quarry for several years afforded occupa- 
tion to nearly 200 individuals. A large quantity of well-dressed 
blocks, some of them weighing from seven to eight tons, were ship- 
ped to Liverpool. The difficulty, however, of finding blocks of 
sufficient size, and the great expense attending the operations, led 
to the abandonment of the undertaking. Were granite to come 
into more general use, it is very probable that this quarry would 
again be opened. Independent of the stone being of the first 
quality, its locality so near a sea-port enables it to be easily re- 
moved. The improvements in quarrying, splitting, and dressing 
are likely also to reduce the expense. 

Craignair quarry still gives employment to a few hands for lo- 
cal purposes, such as gate-posts, monuments, tombstones, &amp;c. 
The ornamental work and lettering of these, and also the polish- 
ing of slabs for lobby- tables, watch-seals, &amp;c. show great improve- 
ment, and do credit to the workmen in the district. 

Minerals. — Neither coal nor lime have been found in this pa- 
rish : these are imported from the opposite coast of Cumberland. 
From partial workings that have been made on the estate of Kirk- 
ennan, there is every appearance that this property abounds with 
valuable iron ore. 

Fisheries.— The salmon fisheries in the river Urr were, at a 
former period, of considerable value. The report of old inhabi- 
tants still alive is, that the fishing belonging to the estate of 



BUITTLE. 211 

Munshes, in favourable seasons, yielded, during the latter part of 
the season, from 15 to 20 salmon daily. On one occasion 50 were 
taken at one draught. And now, for years past, not one-half of 
50 has been legally taken during the whole season. It is believed 
that all the fishings in the Urr would not, if now let, bring L.IO 
of annual rent. 

It is difficult to say to what cause this failure is to be attributed. 
The stake-nets at the mouth of the river, on Balcary sands, 
in the parish of Rerwick, erected within the last twenty years, in 
which a great number of salmon are now taken, may in some 
measure account for it. The proprietors having little interest 
in the river fisheries, use no vigilance in protecting the breeding 
fish, so that poaching during the close season is carried on to a 
great extent. The application of lime to the land, the great ex- 
tent of drainage, whereby marshes and swamps throw off their 
superfluous waters at once, and thus prevent the salmon in dry 
seasons from getting up the river, have all, it has been imagined, 
tended to injure the river fisheries. 

No attempt has hitherto been made by any of the inhabitants 
to establish the white fishing, along our shores. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Castle Douglas is the nearest market-town. Palnackie is the 
only village in the parish. It is situated on the river Urr, and has 
a considerable trade with Liverpool, Whitehaven, Workington, 
Maryport, and other towns in the north of England ; with Glas- 
gow and Irvine, in the west of Scotland, and also with North Ame- 
rica. Coals, lime, wood, slates, and merchant goods are import- 
ed. Farm produce, wood, fat cattle, and sheep, are exported. 
Trade has greatly increased at the port of Palnackie, since the for- 
mer Statistical Account was written. The additional quantity of • 
lime used for building and agriculture, the increased consumption of 
coals, the increasing prosperity of the town of Castle Douglas, of 
which Palnackie may be considered the port, and the general 
prosperity of the country, have led to this result. 

The river Urr is navigable at the lowest neap-tides, from its 
confluence with the Solway to Palnackie, being a distance of four 
miles, by vessels drawing from 11 to 12 feet of water ; and at high 
spring "tides, by vessels drawing 16 or 17 feet of water. From 
Palnackie to Dalbeattie, a distance of four miles, it is navigable 
by vessels drawing 8 feet of water, at a tide rising 15 feet. 

Fifty years ago only two, or at most three, cargoes of coals were imported. Tha 
average number of cargoes for the last three years is 124.

There is no regularly built harbour at Palnackie. On one side 
of the Creek where vessels used to lie, a breast-work, or tempo- 
rary wooden quay, has been erected, where six vessels can bo 
loaded or discharged at the same time. As the present ac- 
commodation is too small for the shipping, were the quay ex- 
tended along the side of the river, and on the opposite side 
of the creek, it would give an additional impulse to the trade 
of this port. No harbour dues are exacted. One farthing per 
ton register is levied for river dues, viz. keeping up ring-bolts, moor- 
ing posts, and the river road. A custom-house officer is stationed 
here, and all vessels, except those engaged in foreign trade, are 
cleared, both inwards and outwards. 

The following table shows the principal articles of import and 
export, to and from the port of Palnackie, for the three years from 

1833 to 1836, distinguishing each year.

There are twenty vessels belonging to the river Urr, amount- 
ing in all to 1303 tons burthen; and navigated by 75 seamen. 

A foot-runner, carrying the mail, passes every afternoon from 
Castle Douglas, through Palnackie to Dalbeattie, and returns in 
the evening. 

Ecclesiastical Stae.— The church stands in the centre of the 
parish, and is accessible to all the inhabitants. It was built in 
1819, at an expense of L.IOOO Sterling, on an elevated situation 
adjoining to the burying ground, and of a construction more com- 
modious for the people than the old church, as well as more or- 
namental to the neighbourhood. It is calculated to hold 400 sit- 
ters on the ground area ; and the walls are of sufficient height to 
admit of galleries being erected at any future period, should the 
population increase. There is no other place of worship m the 
parish. The patronage of the church belongs to the crown. 



BUITTLE.

The old church stood in the centre of the burying-ground, and 
bore evident marks of remote architecture ; there are no records 
respecting the period of its erection. The east end of it, which 
comprehended the choir, was wider than the rest of the building, 
and was divided from it by a Gothic arch. The walls still re- 
main entire, and are covered with ivy, forming a beautiful ruin. 

In Symson's description of Galloway, it is said that " the kirk 
was of old called Kirkennen, and was situated upon the river of 
Urr, near the mouth of it ; but for the more conveniency, was trans- 
lated to the very centre of the parish, and called Bootle, because 
built in the baronie so called." 

No vestige of the old church of Kirkennan now remains, though 
the place where it stood, is still pointed out. About seventy years 
ago, when digging the ground around it, handles of coffins and frag- 
ments of human bones were discovered. This burying-ground has 
long been subjected to the plough ; it probably ceased to be used 
as a place of interment when the church was removed to Buittle, 
and a burying-ground was established there. No monuments or 
grave stones were erected at Kirkennan, at least, no fragments of 
any such memorials now remain ; perhaps, at a remote period, 
these were not erected in country parishes. The oldest grave- 
stone in Buittle church-yard, was erected to the memory of a 
person who died in 1701. 

The manse and offices were built in 1793, and have undergone 
frequent repairs. 

The stipend, as modified in 1831 by the Court of Teinds, is 
16 chalders, half barley and half meal ; and since that period, the 
average amount of stipend, converted into money according to the 
fiar prices of the stewartry,_is L.211, 2s. 3jd. per annum. 

Education. — There are two parochial schools in the parish. 
One of the teachers has a salary of L.28, 6s. 5d. The other has 
a salary of L.23, Os. 2d. The teachers have commodious dwell- 
ing houses and school-rooms, built by the heritors in 18J7. One 
of the teachers has a small garden free of rent ; the other pays 
L.l per annum for less than a rood of ground. The number of 
scholars attending the parochial schools, on an average, is about 
130. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of indus- 
trious poor on the roll of the kirk-session for the last three years 
is 18. There is no parochial assessment. The weekly collec- 
tions in the church, with the interest of a small sum of money, 



214 



KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE, 



and the annual donations of a few charitable individuals among 
the non-resident heritors, have hitherto been sufficient for the 
support of the poor. The fimds are divided quarterly, and the 
industrious poor receive on an average 8s. 6d. each. Besides the 
industrious poor, there are at present one pauper entirely supported 
out of the poor's funds, at the rate of L.7 per annum, and another 
supported by the heritors, at the rate of L. 10 per annum. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Since the former Statistical Account was written, the parish has 
undergone considerable changes. Zeal for agricultural improve- 
ments has greatly increased, new implements of husbandry have 
been introduced, and better kinds of grain cultivated. Drainage 
has likewise been extensively practised, the system of turnip hus- 
bandry generally adopted, and greatly extended by the application 
of bone manure, and the land improved by the turnips beihg fed 
off with sheep. Plantations, by which the country is sheltered 
and adorned, have been greatly extended, the farm-houses have 
been rebuilt or enlarged, and are now neat and commodious, and 
the office-houses substantial and extensive. The comforts which 
the farmers enjoy, and their modes of living, have changed greatly 
for the better. The cottages and their inhabitants have also 
shared in the general improvement. 

The increase of population, though not rapid, has been pro- 
gressive. This increase is chiefly confined to the village of Pal- 
nackie, which, in 1808, contained only 7 houses and 29 inhabi- 
tants. It now contains 29 houses and 190 inhabitants. 

Roads have been greatly improved within the last thirty years. 
New lines have been opened, and the old lines in many places 
altered, so as to avoid acclivities, and conduct them in a more 
level and convenient direction. Besides the. turnpike roads pass- 
ing through the parish, there are eighteen miles of parish roads 
kept in repair, from the Conversion money in lieu of Statute La- 
bour. This amounts, at the maximum assessment, to L.51, IBs. 
3d. Many of the most important of these roads were made at a 
great expense by heritors, through whose lands they passed, ad- 
vancing money without interest, to be repaid when the road funds 
of the parish would admit. Twenty years ago, the debt thus 
created amounted to L.549. It has now been reduced to L.136, 
principally by the heritors having for many years assessed them- 
selves with an extra sum of L.17j 6s. Id. annually.

I.— Topography and Natural History. 
Extent —This parish extends in length, from east to west, 
along the coast of the Solway Frith, about 8 miles, and is, from 
north to south, 4 miles broad. 

Topographical Appearances.— The surface is extremely rough 
and irregular. Broom, furze, and bramble spread with amazing ra- 
pidity. "Many of the higher grounds are poor and shallow, owing 
to the soil being carried down to the valleys. These, however, are 
fertile and kindly, and produce grain of good quality and excellent 
pasture. Towards the east or Southwick side, many of the farms 
are in a high state of cultivation. 

Besides a ridge of hills that run through the middle of the pa- 
rish, there is a mountainous range covered with heath, and run- 
ning to the large and conspicuous mountain of CrifFel. 

Coves or C'aues.— There are a number of these along the « wild 
shores of caverned Colvend." The principal of these is called 
the Piper's cove, from a legend that a piper undertook to explore 
it. He carried his pipes with him, and continued to play under 
ground till he reached Barnbarrach, about four miles distant from 
its mouth. The sound then ceased, and nothing was ever heard 
again of the unfortunate minstrel. It is found, however, to be only 
1'20 yards in length. There is a well in the middle, 22 feet deep. 
There are a number of fissures in the rocks along the shore. 
Close by the Piper's cove, already mentioned, there is a rude na- 
tural arch, about 40 feet in height, called the Needle's Eye. An- 
other arch, bearing the same name, and lying more to the east- 
ward, is more regularly formed though not so high. 

Hydrography. — There are a number of small lakes in the pa- 
rish. A strong chalybeate flows from one of the clefts. It was 
formerly used as a tonic in intermittent fever.

KIIIKCUDBIIIGHTSHIUE. 



Mine. — A copper mine was at one time wrought. The ore 
was said to be rich, and the seam of a tolerable thickness. 

Woods. — There is a considerable extent of natural wood in the 
parish upon the estates of Fairgirch and Barnhourie ; and, of late 
years, great quantities of wood have been planted, principally oak 
and fir. 

II. — Civil History. 

Parochial Registers. — The earliest date of the parochial regis- 
ters is 1716. They have not been regularly kept. 

Ijand- owners. — The chief land-owners are, Mr Oswald of Au- 
chencruive ; Mr Crichton of Auchenskeoch ; the Rev. Mr Mait- 
land of Fairgirch ; and Mr Stewart of Southwick. 

Antiquities. — Coins have sometimes been dug up, principally 
of Edward I. of England, and Alexander III. of Scotland. 

On the castle hill of Barcloy, there are the remains of a circu- 
lar encampment. There is also a hill called the vitrified fort, 
and another encampment, of a circular form, not far from the 
manse. 

There is a well called the Murderers' Well, near the Southwick 
Needle's Eye. According to tradition, it was named from the fol- 
lowing circumstance : A set of border reivers came to levy black- 
mail on the peaceable inhabitants of Colvend. The parishioners 
rallied, and seizing the leaders of the foray, threw them down 
this rock to the well below. 

At Achenskeoch, in Southwick, there are the ruins of a large 
building of the castellated form. 

III. — Population. 

The population in 1755, was 898 
1794, 964 
1801, 1106 
1811, 1298 
1821, 1322 
1831, 1358 
1841, 1495 

Smuggling is now unknown. This coast, at one time, was no- 
torious for this iliicit traffic. There were a number of cellars be- 
low ground, where smuggled brandy was concealed, till the people 
were informed of its arrival. It was conveyed away in barrels 
slung over horses' backs, even as far as Teviotdale, by bands of 
men, prepared to defend themselves against the revenue officers. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — Arable land lets about 10s. per acre. Of late 
years, a considerable quantity of waste land has been reclaimed, 



COLVEND AND SOUTIIWICK. 



217 



The state of farm-buildings and enclosures has undergone a great 
change in the last forty years. Number of farms, 71 ; rent from 

L.IO to L.560.' 

Live-Stock.T\Qxe are fed in the parish between 40 and 50 
score of black-faced sheep, and a few score of other kinds. The 
cattle are almost all of Galloway breed. 

Quarries. — There are two mill-stone quarries in the parish ; but 
they have not been wrought of late. 

Navigation. — Coasting vessels are employed in shipping grain 
to Liverpool, Dublin, Glasgow, &amp;c. ; in the herring fishery ; and 
in bringing coal and lime from the English side. There are an- 
nually exported from the parish, about 4000 bushels of barley, and 
5000 stones of meal. 

The Barnhourie sand-bank, so fatal to vessels, especially to those 
which are strangers to the coast, runs from the mouth of the Urr 
to the Nith. Nearer to the English side is another bank called 
the Robin Rig. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is extremely ill situated 
for the united parishes. The nearest part of Southwick is four 
miles, and some farms are distant seven miles. It was built in 
1771, and is too small for the present population. 

The manse was built in 1804. There are about twelve acres 
of glebe, partly at Colvend, and partly at Southwick : value of 
both glebes about L.20 per annum. The teind was exhausted by 
last augmentation in 1824, and amounts to L.232. 

There is a meeting-house belonging to the Secession, about 
seven miles from the parish church. It is ill attended, and would 
be still more so, if the parish church were centrically placed. 

Poor. — There are on the poor's roll, at this time, 44 persons. 
The fund for distribution arises chiefly from the collections in 
church.

<p>



PKESBYTERY OF DUMFRIES, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. JOHN CROCKET, MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name of the parish has heen spelled differently 
at different times. On the kirk bell, which was cast in 1674, it 
is named Kirkwinong. It is probable that the church was dedi- 
cated to St Winning. There is a spring near to the church which 
still bears the name of Winning's well. 

Boundaries Sc. — The parish is bounded on the east by New- 
abbey ; on the south, by Colvend ; on the west, by Urr ; and on 
the north, by Lochrutton. It is about 5 miles in length, and 3 in 
breadth. 

Topographical Appearances. — The general aspect of the pa- 
rish is hilly and uneven ; but along the banks of the stream which 
flows through the middle of the parish, there is a very considera- 
ble portion of excellent holm and meadow land. The hills do 
not rise to any considerable height, and abound with grouse and 
black game. The river which intersects the parish, takes its rise 
from two lochs in the upper end of the parish of Newabbey. The 
length of its course is about nine miles. It joins the Urr 
about a mile below the village of Dalbeattie. The water abounds 
with trout of excellent quality ; and salmon find their way up from 
the sea in considerable quantities, in the end of the season. I am 
afraid that few of them return, as there are some poachers on 
the banks who make a trade of killing them by night with leis- 
ters. The salmon were much more plentiful at one time than 
they are now. 

idineralogy. — The southern division of the parish abounds with 
granite, and some of the rocks are of stupendous size. The pa- 
rish supplies the surrounding district with pillars for gates and 
steps for stairs, which, when finely polished, have a beautiful ap- 
pearance, and are remarkably durable. The stones on the west

side of the parish are of blue whinstone, and are used for building 
dikes, which are the principal fences in the parish. 

Zoology.— T\ie cattle reared are of the Galloway kind. Ihe 
farmers pay a good deal/of attention to this stock, as they find 
from experience that it makes a better return than any other. On 
the coarse and high-lying lands, a number of Highland bullocks 
are wintered, as they are considered to be more hardy and more 
easily fed. They are generally bought at Falkirk in the end of 
harvest, and yield a pretty fair profit for a season's keep. There 
are few sheep now kept in the parish. There are only two farms 
where a shepherd is kept to look after the flock. The hills on the 
south and east of the parish abound with grouse and black game. 
When the present incumbent came to the parish in 1809, there was 
scarcely a blackcock to be seen. Now the black game outnumber 
the grouse, and if they continue to increase in the same proportion, 
they will banish the grouse from the ground. From occupying the 
low ground where they first hatched their young, they ascended to 
the higher hills, and have taken possession of the breeding grounds 
of the grouse. Hares and partridges are also plenty, as the most 
part of the parish has been strictly preserved for a number of years. 
There are also some pheasants, which have made their appearance, 
of late from two of the neighbouring parishes, where they were 
reared with some care. 

The river is an excellent trouting stream, and in the deep water 
at the lower end of the parish there is a quantity of large pike and 
perch. Some very large trout about spawning time have been 
cauo-ht at the outlets of the lochs from which the water takes its 
rise. They are from four to six pounds weight, and are of excel- 
lent quality when they are in season. 

II. — Civil HrSTOiiY. 
Land-owners. — There are only five proprietors in the parish. 
The principal heritor is Mr Maxwell of Terregles, whose rental 
amounts to nearly L. 3000 per annum. The rental of the other 
four proprietors is about L.lOOOper annum. There is no heritor 
residing in the parish. 

Parochial Register. — The parochial register was begun in 
1705, and has been very irregularly kept. Meetings of session, 
births, marriages, and collections are all jumbled together. There 
are some very curious insertions in the record, which strongly mark 
the inquisitorial spirit of our ancestors. The first volume of the 
record comes down to 1770; and from that period to 1800 the 



220 



KlUKCUDHRlGIITSIllRE. 



record has been lost or mislaid. It has been regularly kept since 
that time, and the present incumbent, who was inducted in 1809, 
has acted as session-clerk, and saved to the poor the small sum 
which was formerly allowed as a salary. 

Antiquities. — There are no antiquities in the parish that de- 
serve to be particularly mentioned. Two ancient houses, now in 
ruins, were formerly the seats of Lord Herries, who made a con- 
spicuous figure in the reign of Queen Mary. The one is in the 
middle of the parish, and the other at the southern extremity. 
They have both been places of strength, and it is easy to trace 
the moat which surrounded the castle of Corah. There is also 
a square tower at Drumcoltran, which had also been a place of 
strength. About thirty years ago, a matchlock was dug up in the 
neighbourhood of the tower. On the farm of Glaisters, belong- 
ing to Mr Maxwell, there was a very large cairn of stones, which 
was carried away some years ago, for building dikes. The dike 
built out of the stones which composed the cairn, extended to 
a mile in length ; and in the bottom of the cairn, a number of 
urns were found filled with ashes. They immediately crumbled 
into dust when exposed to the air. This cairn was situated in a 
low-lying and level moor. Adjacent to this mound there is still 
a circle of large granite stones. 

Coins. — Some years ago, a beautiful gold bonnet piece of James 
V. was found on the lands of Lochend. It was in a state of good 
preservation, and is now in the possession of the proprietor. Two 
years ago, a silver coin was found in the glebe, which appears to 
have been struck on the dispersion of the Armada. 

Modern Buildings. — When the present incumbent came to the 
parish, there were only three slated farm-houses in it. Now 
there is an excellent onstead on almost everv farm, and the tenants 
are most comfortably lodged. Mr Maxwell of Terregles has 
spared no expense in erecting most commodious houses of every 
description. The buildings are most substantial, built of granite, 
and well finished in every respect. 

III. — Population. 

According to the former Statistical Account the population was 520 
In 1811, - - - 656 

1821, - - - 776 

1831, - - - 652 

1841, - - 637 

It is easy to state the causes of the decrease of the population. 

As formerly stated, new farm onsteads were erected throughout 



KlUKGUNZEON. 



221 



all the parish. Formerly, there were cottages attached to each 
farm, where labourers resided. These have nearly all been swept 
away ; and in some places where five or six families formerly resid- 
ed, there is not a stone left to mark where the cottages stood. 
There is only one small village, which stands in the neighbour- 
hood of the church. It contains the school-house, a smithy, a 
joiner's shop, two small shops for groceries and other merchan- 
dize. An excellent mill adjoins the village, which is constantly 
employed throughout the year in grinding meal and makmg pot 
barley. 

The people, in general, are industrious, moral, and religious. 
Poaching, however, is carried on to a greater extent than it was 
formerly, owing to the facility of transporting the game to Liver- 
pool by steam vessels. The quantity of game caught at night is 
incredible ; and the gentlemen who are most strict in preserving 
it, generally suffer most, as the poachers invariably select their 
grounds for depredation. 

TV. — Industry. 
Agriculture.— Lime is brought to the port of Dalbeattie, and is in 
great request at some distance from the harbour. As the lands 
in the vicinity of the port have been regularly limed for thirty 
years past, the farmers have in a great measure declined to use 
this manure to any great extent. The introduction of bone ma- 
nure has created a great revolution in the mode of farming. The 
ordinary rotation is a crop of oats from ley land ; 2d, green crop 
of potatoes or turnips ; 3d, barley or oats ; and, Ath, hay. The 
ground is then pastured and broken up according to the rotation. 
Wheat is seldom sown, as the farmers think that barley is fully as 
profitable a crop, and that it does not scourge the land so severely. 
Upon the whole, the system of agriculture has been greatly 
changed to the better, and the produce of the land doubled 
within these twenty years. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication. — The nearest post-office is the village 
of Dalbeattie, which is only four miles distant. There is a daily 
post to that place; but the most of the inhabitants receive their 
letters from Dumfries, which is nine miles distant. Two carriers to 
Dumfries pass through the parish twice in the week. The turn- 
pike road is excellent, and there are three bridges on it, which are 
kept in good repair. Two coaches travel daily to Kirkcudbright, 
and return the same dav to Dumfries. 



222 



KiRKCUDBRIGHTSHIttE. 



Ecclesiastical State. ~T\\Q church is situated in the centre of 
the parish, and is most conveniently placed. There are only four 
farms, which are distant four miles from the church. The church 
was built in 1790, and is in good repair. The sittings in the 
church are 224 in number. About 20 of these sittings are given 
free of expense to the villagers by Mr Maxwell. All the other sit- 
tings are also free. The manse was built in 1804, and is a most 
commodious and excellent house. It is kept in good repair ; but 
as it was built and finished in the best manner at first, it has 
required very little outlay since its erection. The offices are 
good and commodious. The glebe consists of ten acres of good 
land. The stipend is the minimum, as the lands were valued very 
low, about the middle of the last century. 

There are only four families of Dissenters in the parish : they 
attend the Secession meeting-house in the neighbouring parish 
of Urr. All the other families are regular attendants on the pa- 
rish church. The average number of communicants is 180. 
There is an annual collection for that excellent institution, the 
Dumfries and Galloway Infirmary. 

Education. — There is one school in the parish, situated near 
the church. The salary is the maximum, and L.4 are allowed 
out of the salary to a small school at the lower end of the parish, 
when a school is kept there, which has been the case for some 
years past. The farmers built a small house at their own ex- 
pense, and the teacher generally lodges alternately with his em- 
ployers. The average number of pupils at the two schools is 90. 
The parochial teacher has the legal accommodation and an ex 
cellent house. 

All the children upwards of six years of age can read and write, 
and are well grounded in arithmetic. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number on the poor's 
roll is 8. The collections in the church are about L.12 per an- 
num. The session have L.181 in the bank, the amount of dona- 
tions from ditferent individuals at different periods. In order that 
the poor might be more liberally provided for, the heritors have 
lately voluntarily assessed themselves in different sums, according 
to their respective valuations. Mr Maxwell, who has always paid 
particular attention to the poor, has been in the habit of granting 
L.IO annually for the relief of the labouring poor. Each pau- 
per receives on an average L.l per quarter; and their houses are 
rent-free.

Fuel.— The fuel commonly used is peats, but the mosses are 

nearly exhauste'd. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since the former Statistical Account was written, the parish 
has been greatly improved. The arable land was then 3000 acres: 
in extent, but now it amounts to 5000 or 6000 acres. A great 
many acres have been planted since that period, and the plan ta-. 
tions will soon add much to the beauty of the country. The lands 
are all subdivided, and the fences kept in good order. The farm- 
houses, which were formerly in a miserable state, are now com- 
fortable and commodious, and good offices are attached to them. 
They were built and finished at a great expense, and the expense 
was wholly defrayed by the proprietor. The people are now com- 
fortably lodged and clothed, and their provisions are more plen- 
tiful and of a better kind than formerly. "The tenants pay their 
rents half-yearly ; and there is scarcely an instance of a farmer not 
paying every farthing of his rent on the day of collection. Formerly 
the farmers had great difficulty in paying the trifling rent which 
was then demanded; and it is well known that at the conclu- 
sion of the American war, many were in arrears for the by- 
gone rents of several years. The landlord and the factor were 
indulgent; and it is worthy of remark, that every shiUing of 
these arrears was paid up, when the state of the country began to 
improve.

<p>

PRESBYTERY OF DUMFRIES, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. WILLIAM THORBURN, MINISTER. 



L — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The name of this parish was written Troquire in the 
records of the kirk-session of the parish about the year J 745, and 
Troqueir in the records of the Presbytery of Dumfries, in the year 
1647. Perhaps it was so called from the two French words sig- ~ 



224 



KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE. 



nifying the third quire, it being one of the three Cathohc quires 
in the district, betwixt that of Lincluden on the one hand, and 
that of Sweetheart Abbey on the other. 

Extent, 6fc. — It comprises a space of nearly 8 miles in length, 
and 5 miles in breadth ; and has for its boundaries, Terregles 
on the north ; Newabbey on the south ; Lochrutton on the west ; 
and the river Nith on the east. This river is wonderfully pure 
and transparent, considering that it has tides twice a day the 
whole length of its connection with Troqueer. 

Topographical Appearances. — This parish may be said to be di- 
vided into three distinct parts by three ranges of elevations, which 
run almost at equal distances from each other, like waves of the 
sea. The first range, which rises with a gradual acclivity from the 
river, has been long in cultivation, and is remarkable for its beauty 
and fertility. As it lies within the burgh-roods of Maxwelltown, 
and contains a large portion of Maxwelltown, with some public nur- 
series and gardens of considerable extent, and several houses and 
villas of modern architecture, its enclosures bring a high rent, 
varying from L.3 to L.6 per acre. The intervening space between 
the first and second elevation is also highly cultivated and produc- 
tive. The Cargen, which falls into the Nith towards the south- 
east, runs along the whole of this valley, much to its utility, 
but little to its beauty, as it is a dull, heavy stream. On the banks 
of this small river, otters are sometimes seen, which find shelter 
among the bulrushes and alder bushes which cover several parts 
of its margin. 

The second elevation, which rises to a greater height than the 
first, and extends considerably farther to the south, is likewise un- 
der the plough, and yields crops of turnips and potatoes, hay and 
oats, wheat and barley of the best quality. It may be mentioned 
here, that some of the farmers on the higher grounds of this range 
have lately tried bone-manure with great success, and much to the 
ease of the horses which they employ in husbandry. A large por- 
tion of the space between the second and third ranges of hills is 
moss and meadow, both of which might be brought into a much 
more productive state by skilful cultivation. Indeed, were the 
whole of this moss, which at present yields only peats of an 
inferior quality, and whose surface is mostly covered with coarse 
heath, and frequently disfigured with bogs and quagmires, pro- 
perly drained and levelled with the spade, it would, at no great 
distance of time, repay the expense, and, in the meanwhile, con-

tribute highly to the beauty of that part of the parish, and to the 
value of the conterminous parishes. On this moss the botanist 
will find no plants of the rarer kinds to gratify his curiosity. It is 
evident that the whole range of this moss, stretching several miles 
in length, was, at a remote period, a part of the firth, and covered 
twice a-day with the tides that flow up the Nith. 

The third range of elevation, which is much higher than the 
second, and extends along the whole space of the parish, is under 
tillage on the sides and along parts of the summit ; and the crops 
which it produces, though neither so early nor so rich as those that 
grow on the other two, are sufficient to repay the skill and indus- 
try of the cultivator. On several parts of this range are extensive 
and thriving plantations of fir, larch, ash, elm, oak, and other 
forest trees. None of these hills contain freestone, limestone, 
coal, or any other fossil entitled to the notice of the mineralogist. 
The rock of the whole of them is composed chiefly of mica slate, 
running into syenite, with occasional masses of granite shooting 
up through the strata beds. 

II. — Civil History. 
Mansion- Houses. — The properties in the parish entitled to no- 
tice, are those of Kirkconnel, Cargen, Mabie, Dalscairth, Gol- 
dielea, Terraughty, Carruchan, Cargenholm, and Mavis Grove. 
The mansion-house of Kirkconnel, the most extensive and valuable 
of these properties, stands remote from the public road and in sight 
of the river, is surrounded with a considerable extent of cropping 
and pasture land, and several thriving plantations, and has many ac- 
companiments that invest it with an imposing aspect and an air of an- 
tiquity. A Catholic chapel is attached to it, appropriately seated 
and furnished. The mansion-house of Cargen is a large building ; 
and though placed too near the corner of the field and the parish 
road, yet, as it commands a view of some of the beautiful windings 
of the river, it might, by a skilful extension of the lawn, and a 
tasteful grouping of the trees around it, be made a charming re- 
sidence. On this estate is St Querdon's Well, which is the sub- 
ject of a poem of considerable length, written by Mr White, late 
teacher of mathematics in the Academy of Dumfries. The man- 
sion-house of Mabie is a modern, substantial, and well-arranged 
building, stands on an elevated situation, and commands an ex- 
tensive and sublime land and water prospect. A saw-mill, lately 
erected on this estate, proves of great advantage, by bringing to 
market the surplus of fir trees, with which some of its woods 

KIRKCUDBRIGHT. „ 



226 



KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE. 



abound. The present proprietor, by draining a considerable por- 
tion of moss which lay directly in view of the mansion-house, and 
levelling it with the spade, and top-dressing it with compost, has 
greatly improved the spot by giving a green sward to what was 
formerly a disfiguring swamp. The mansion-house of Dalscairth 
is an elegant, spacious residence, standing on an extensive field, 
skirted with plantations of trees, with a waterfall in view of it, de- 
scending from a considerable height through a range of hanging 
wood, which renders it truly picturesque and romantic. The pre- 
sent proprietor has added greatly to the beauty of the place by con- 
verting, at a considerable expense, an extensive marsh in front of 
the house into a lake, the margin of which is laid out and varied 
in a very tasteful manner. The mansion-house of Goldielea is 
a delightful residence, embosomed in wood, has a lawn in front 
studded with clumps of venerable oaks, and is refreshed and en- 
livened with a perennial stream of water running over a transpa- 
rent and pebbly bed. The mansion-house of Terraughty stands 
on a very delightful eminence, has a great extent of land-prospect, 
and a field in front that might, at a trifling expense, be converted 
into a lawn of singular beauty. The late proprietor made a gar- 
den, hot-house, green-house, and vinery, at a considerable expense, 
all of which are tastefully arranged, and highly productive. The 
mansion-house of Carruchan is surrounded with fields of rich soil 
highly cultivated ; and is particularly interesting from the seclu- 
sion of its situation. The mansion-house of Cargenholm stands 
close to the river Cargen ; has a warm southern exposure, with a 
full view of Criffell ; and is a sheltered comfortable residence. 
On this property, there is a brick-kiln, the bricks of which are 
in great request, owing to their superior quality. The mansion- 
house of Mavis Grove is situated on a delightful rising ground 
near the river Nith, has a variety of large trees of different sorts 
ranged tastefully around it in a kind of amphitheatre, and is much 
admired for the amenity of its situation and the softness of its 
scenery. The villas of Summerville, Arundel, Bromland, Tro- 
queerholm, Ryedale, Rosefield, Nithside, may be mentioned as 
all of them commodious, and some of them spacious and elegant. 

Eminent Mew.— This parish cannot boast of having been the 
birth-place or residence of any person entitled to notice, except, 
perhaps, the Rev. Mr Blackadder, who, about the period of the 
Reformation, was officiating minister ; the particulars of whose life 
and banishment to the Black Rocks, where he died, are rescued

from oblivion by the published narrative of the Kev. Mr Crichton. 
It is said that Lagg, who was the terror of the Covenanters of his 
time over the whole south of Scotland, resided occasionally in this 
parish at a place which is called Hag-hall to this day. 

Antiquities.— Close by the manse, and directly opposite to the 
spot, on the other side of the river, where Cummin's castle for- 
merly stood, is a moat of a circular form and considerable height, 
where, according to oral tradition, the kings of Scotland, or their 
vassal chiefs who were entrusted with the keeping of it, used to 
hang offenders, and the most daring of their captives taken in 
battle, or in acts of pillage and robbery. The more probable con- 
jecture is, that it was one of the circular mounds where the baron 
or judge of the district held courts of Justice in the open air. 

Parochial Registers. — The register of proclamations begins 
April 1713; that of baptisms, 14th June 1734. The parish re- 
cords begin about the same time. All of them are, for a long pe- 
riod, extremely meager and scanty. It may be mentioned here, 
that the records of the Presbytery of Dumfries commence 5th 
August 1647.

IV. — Industry. 

Rental of the Parish. — In the year 1752, the rental was ascer- 
tained before the Court of Session to be L.950; in the year 1791, 
it was nearly L. 5000; and in the year 1819, L. 12,000. And 
though landed property has fallen considerably in value of late, 
yet the rental of theparish may still be regarded as L. 11,000. 

Fishery. — There is a fishery in the Nith, drawn on the Troqueer 
side of the river opposite to Dumfries, which furnishes salmon, 
grilse, and herlings, more than sufficient for the supply of the two 
burghs and the adjoining country. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Maxwelltown. — Maxwelltown, formerly Bridgend, has a claim to 
a particular account. About twenty-one years ago, it was erected 
mto a burgh of barony, with a provost, two bailies, and four coun- 
cillors elected annually ; and it was named in honour of Mr Max- 
well of Nithsdale, its superior. It stands opposite to the burgh 
of Dumfries, with which it is connected by two bridges. It stands 



228 



KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE. 



on a bank or ridge circling along the edge of the river ; and with 
Its burrow-roods comprises a space of nearly a mile in length, 
and half a mile in breadth. 

The houses in the old part of Maxwelltown are built without any 
regard whatever to elegance, and run in streets awkwardly crook- 
ed and narrow. A more correct style of building has been adopted 
in the new part of the town. Many of the houses are neat and 
convenient, and the streets run in straight lines, and are of a suf- 
ficient breadth. The public road from London to Portpatrick, and 
from London to Glasgow and Edinburgh, by Thornhill and El- 
vanfoot, runs through Maxwelltown. By the former, the mail- 
coach to Portpatrick passes daily ; by the latter, a private coach 
runs every day to Glasgow, and a private coach runs to Edinburgh 
three times a-week. 

Maxwelltown has a court-house of sufficient dimensions for ac- 
commodating the meetings of the Magistrates and Justices of the 
Peace of the district, and the courts of the Sheriff when he officiates 
in this quarter. Below the court-house is a jail, wherein delin- 
quents apprehended within the burgh can be lodged till arrange- 
ments are made for removing them to Kirkcudbright, a distance of 
twenty- seven miles, whence they are to be sent back to stand their 
trial at Dumfries ; — an inconvenience that might easily be remedied, 
by incorporating Maxwelltown with Dumfries in all matters of po- 
lice. As Maxwelltown has no police act, its streets are ill lighted 
at night, there being asyet only a few lamps in it, which have been 
erected and are still supported solely by the voluntary contributions 
of some of its wealthier inhabitants. 

Two founderies have lately been established at Maxwelltown, 
both of which have a great run of employment. It has long had 
a waulk-mill ; a die-house ; two roperies ; a brew-house ; two tan- 
neries; four nurseries, two of which have hot-houses, in which 
grapes and some of the other rarer fruits are reared in great per- 
fection ; and a damask manufactory, celebrated for the beauty and 
elegance gi the fabrics. The water-mills belonging to Dumfries 
stand on the Maxwelltown side of the river ; which, by the supe- 
rior style in which they are fitted up and worked, gave great satis- 
faction to the community. An observatory, which was formerly 
a windmill, stands on the top of the Corbelly hill, forming a strik- 
ing object over an extensive range of district. The butcher-mar- 
ket of Maxwelltown has, for some time past, taken the lead of 
that of Dumfries, and affords a daily supply of excellent beef and 



TUOQUEER. 



229 



veal, mutton and lamb, in their respective seasons. A Dispen- 
sary has lately been opened in Maxwelltown, for the benefit of 
the poorer classes of its inhabitants, under the superintendance of 
a young medical practitioner. 

Ecclesiastical State,— The church and the manse are situated 
within the burrow-roods of Maxwelltown, at a distance of a mile 
from the most crowded part of the population. The church is 
capable of accommodating 840 sitters. A chapel of ease wa 
lately built in the centre of the burgh, through the influence of 
the principal landed proprietor, and others. The Crown is the 
patron of the parish. 

The manse was built thirty years ago. Its situation is on the 
banks of the Nith, and it commands not only an extensive view of 
the Nith, but of Criffell in the adjoining parish, and of Skiddaw 
and some of the other lofty hills in the north of Cumberland. 
The stipend is L.322, 12s. money, the teinds having been sur- 
rendered by the whole of the heritors, the titular excepted, whose 
estate pays nearly two chalders of victual, the one-half meal and the 
other barley. The glebe contains nearly eleven acres, all of good 
quality. 

A chapel of ease was some years ago erected in Maxwell- 
town, capable of accommodating 1600 sitters ; the stipend of the 
minister is L.150 without a manse. 

Education. — There are three schools in the landward part of 
the parish, the principal of which is the parish school, which has 
L.30, 16s. of salary attached to it, with L.2, 10s. of interest, 
arising from a mortified sum for teaching the children of the cot- 
tagers who reside on the estate of Dalscairth, and a comfortable 
dwelling-house and an excellent garden. The second school has a 
salary of L. 15 from the Society for Propagating Christian Know- 
ledge, with L.9, 12s. from the heritors in compensation for the 
keep of a cow summer and winter ; and a large garden, a suitable 
dwelling-house, and a sufficient quantity of peats for fuel, are fur- 
nished by the surrounding tenants gratis. The third school is 
supported by the tenants on the estate of Cargen, who pay the 
teacher wages, and give him bed and board in their houses alter- 
nately. In these three schools, about 180 scholars are taught an- 
nually. 

There is only one endowed school in Maxwelltown, with a 
salary of L.9, 12s. paid by the landward heritors, and L.4, the 
interest of L.lOO of mortified funds. It has also the benefit of the 



230 



KlUKCUDUIUGHTSHIRE. 



interest of some smaller sums bequeathed by a few individuals. 
The teacher has the usual wages, but no dwelling-house. Two 
otherschools are taught in Maxwelltown, the masters in which have 
no emoluments but the wages. The number of scholars in these 
three schools may be 250. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The poor on the roll may be 
100. The funds for their support, arising from proclamations, 
interest of mortified funds, mortcloth fees, collections at the 
parish church, donations, and one-third of the chapel collections, 
amount to about L.140 annually, which affords but a miserable 
pittance for the support of so many, and is one proof among a 
thousand others, that a provision for the aged and infirm should, 
in no country, be left to the unsteady and capricious impulse of 
compassion, but be enforced by positive statute. Indeed, in a 
parish such as Troqueer, where many of the heritors do not re- 
side, and several of those who are resident attend other places of 
worship, and contribute nothing to the poor on the roll, a poor's 
rate, with all its predicted evils, would, if properly managed, be 
the cheapest, the fairest, and the most effectual mode of main- 
taining the native poor. 

Fuel. — Coal is the fuel chiefly used by the inhabitants, which 
is partly conveyed by land from Sanquhar, a distance of twenty- 
seven miles; but chiefly by sea from the coal-pits on the opposite 
coast of England. The first is sold by weight, the last by mea- 
sure, and almost always at a moderate price.

THE REV. GEORGE HERON, MINISTER. 
THE REV. DAVID DICKIE, Assistant Minister. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The name of this parish is generally understood to 
be derived from Terra ecclesice, or the French, Terre dEglise. 
This derivation accords with the circumstance which is fully as- 
certained, that the lands in the parish originally belonged to the 



TfiRREGLES. 



231 



abbey at Lincluden, an ecclesiastical establishment, which is 
within its bounds, and situated on the banks of the river Cairn. 

Extent, Boundaries, cc-Terregles is situated within the stew- 
artry of Kirkcudbright, and is within two miles of the town of 
Dumfries. It extends from east to west about 5 miles, and at an 
average is about 3 in breadth. Its boundaries are, Holywood on 
the north ; Troqueer on the south and east ; Lochrutton on the 
west ; and Irongray on the north-west. 

The church is situated as nearly as possible in the centre of 
the parish, and the manse about a mile to the south-east. To 
the west, there is a beautiful range of hills, part of which is co- 
vered with wood, and part affords excellent pasturage for sheep 
and cattle. From the top of these hills is seen, in great beauty 
and splendour, the town of Dumfries, which, to the eye of the 
beholder, lies immediately below, and the vale along the Nith, 
which, from the windings of the river, and the variety of the sce- 
nery around, is an object of great attraction and interest, together 
with a portion of the Solway and the Cumberland hills in the dis- 
tance. 

Hydrography. — The only river or rather stream besides the 
Cairn, which separates the parish from that of Holywood for about 
two miles, is the Cargen. Although this stream be of small ex- 
tent, yet, in proportion to its size, it affords excellent fishing both 
of salmon and trout. The Cargen joins the Nith, about two miles 
below the town of Dumfries. 

II. — Civil History. 
Land-owners, Sc. — The principal proprietor in the parish is 
Marmaduke C. Maxwell, Esq. of Terregles. The Hon. Mrs Young 
of Lincluden; John Walker, Esq. of Woodlands; and James 
Biggar, Esq. of Maryholm, also hold properties in the parish. 
The estates belonging to the two last mentioned are situated prin- 
cipally in other parts of the county. All the heritors are resident 
with the exception of three. There are twenty-one farms which 
yield each the yearly rental of L. 50 and upwards. It may be 
mentioned, that Marmaduke C. Maxwell, Esq. the principal he- 
ritor in the parish, is of the ancient family of Nithsdale, the title 
of which was forfeited in the year 1715. This family is Roman 
Catholic. In consequence of the great and judicious improve- 
ments which are going on, and the regular employment afforded 
to the labouring class, the residence of this family in the parish 
is of the utmost benefit. Their attention to the tenants on the 



232 



KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE. 



estate, and their condescension and liberality to the poor and the 
working population, have endeared them to' all in the neighbour- 
hood. This branch of the family of Nithsdale claims the dormant 
title of Lord Harris. 

Parochial Registers.-The registers of the parish go no farther 
back than the year 1714, and, generally speaking, have been very 
imperfectly kept. 

Antiquities.~T\iQ ruins of the Abbey of Lincluden are situated 
on the banks of the river Cairn, a little above its junction with the 
Nitb. This church or abbey originally belonged to the Benedic- 
tme nuns. It was built during the reign of Malcolm IV. about 
the year 1 150, by Uthred, the father of Roland, the Lord of Gal- 
loway. In the year 1400, this ancient piece of architecture was 
changed from the character it orginally possessed, in consequence 
of the irregular habits of the nuns, into a temporal barony M'Diar- 
mid's Picture of Dumfries-shire. About the beginning of the 
sixteenth century, it became the property of the Nithsdale family, 
and at present is in the possession of Marmaduke C. Maxwell, 
Esq. Towards the east end of the chapel, is the tomb of Marga- 
ret, daughter of Robert III. and wife of Archibald Earl of Dou- 
glas, on which is an inscription, but so much defaced that it can- 
not now be deciphered. The ruins are in a very dilapidated state; 
and although the whole must have been once a building of much 
grandeur and magnificence, its beauty is completely obscured. 
There are many farms in the neighbourhood which have obviously 
derived their names from this ancient establishment, for example. 
Nunnery, College, &amp;c. 

Adjoining to the church there is an old building which now con- 
stitutes the burying-place of the Maxwell family. It was built in 
the year 1568, and formed part of the church at that period used 
as a Roman Catholic place of worship. There are many curiosi- 
ties connected with this remnant of the olden times. Amongst 
others, is a massy and curiously carved chair made of oak, whfch 
originally belonged to the provost of Lincluden Abbey, after that 
institution was changed into a temporal barony. In the absence, 
however, of a distinct knowledge of the character of these ancient 
relics, and the particular purposes to which they were once applied, 
little can with any certainty be said of them. This remnant of 
the Catholic times retains to this day the name of the choir, and 
is understood to have formed the orchestra or place set apart for 



TERREGLES. 



333 



the singers in the service of the Romish church. It is now very 
much decayed. 

Upon the farm of Terregles-town, about a mile to the east 
from the church, there was at one time a village of considerable 
extent. Its population is said to have amounted to about 300. 
The pavement of the street is still seen, and extends a considerable 
length. In the immediate neighbourhood there is a place called the 
Gallows-hill, where, according to tradition, criminals were exe- 
cuted at an early period. 

III. — Population. 

The population in 1790, was 510 

1821, - 651 

1831, - 606 

1841, - 564 

IV. — Industry. 

The estate of Marmaduke C. Maxwell, Esq. can boast of some 
of the most scientific and enterprising farmers to be found in the 
south of Scotland. 

Wages. — The average amount of wages for labourers is Is. 6d. 
per diem during summer, and Is. 4d. during winter. Farm-ser- 
vants unmarried receive from L. 10 to L. 12 per annum, and 
females from L. 5 to L. 6. Married men receive from L. 20 to 
L.22 per annum, together with a free house and other perquisites. 
Others again receive from L. 10 to L. 12 and 52 stones of meal, 
and 3 or 4 stones of barley. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Ecclesiastical State. — The manse is a substantial and commo- 
dious building, and is in a state of good repair. The present 
church was built about thirty years ago. It is badly constructed, 
cold, damp, and in every respect uncomfortable. The bury- 
ing-ground around the church is enclosed by a substantial stone 
wall, and within are several neat and handsome tombstones or mo- 
numents. 

The stipend derived from the teinds amounts to L. 110, 12s. 
4d., besides L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. The re- 
maining L.39, 7s. 8d. is obtained from the Exchequer. 

The patronage of the parish originally belonged to the Niths- 
dale family, and, subsequently, was exercised by the late Duke of 
Queensberry. At present, it is in the possession of the Duke of 
Buccleuch. 

Education. — The parochial is the only school in the parish. 
A new and commodious school-house has lately been erected. 



234 



KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE. 



Poor, — At present there are nine upon the poor's roll. The 
sum of L. 446 is vested in the session for behoof of the poor, and 
is lying at interest in the hands of the principal proprietor. The 
collections at the church amount annually to about L. 14. Be- 
sides this, there is. a sum distributed amongst the poor not upon 
the roll, and which affords a most seasonable relief to many during 
the winter months.

<p>

PRESBYTERY OF DUMFRIES, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES, 

THE REV. THOMAS GRIERSON, A.M., MINISTER. 

I- — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — There are various opinions as to the etymology of 
Kirkbean, some so constrained and far-fetched as to be unworthy 
of notice. That which appears most natural and satisfactory is, 
that, like many other names of places, this word unites the com- 
paratively modern term kirk to the Gaelic term Ben or Bien, sig-. 
nifying mountain, thus denoting the situation of the former at the 
base of the celebrated mountain Criffell. 

Extenty Src. — The length of this parish is about 6 miles, and 
the breadth may be said to average 3. The number of square 
miles, according to Ainslie's map of the county, is 14.89 parts. 

Boundaries. — It is bounded on the north-east, east, south, and 
south-west, by the Solway Frith, comprising about ten miles of 
sea coast, and in other directions by a rugged mountainous district, 
terminated on the northern extremity by Criffell, and gradually 
decreasing in height towards the vale of Southwick, on the south- 
west. The parishes that come in contact with Kirkbean are New 
Abbey to the north and north-west, and the united parish of Cul- 
vend and Southwick to the south-west and west. The em- 
bouchure of the Nith separates it from Caerlaverock on the north- 
east and east. 

Topographical Appearances. — The height of Criffell above the 
sea level is about 1900 feet. It is generally stated in tables of 



KIRKBEAN. 



235 



heights to be the highest mountain south of the Lowther and 
Queensberry range, though there is good reason to suspect some 
of the mountains towards the source of Loch Doon, in the pa- 
rishes of Kells and Minnigaff, io be considerably more elevated, 
as also the Cairnsmuir mountains. 

In various directions, the view from the summit of Criffell is 
very extensive. Annan, Carlisle, Dumfries, and Castle-Douglas 
are distinctly visible, and also the Isle of Man. In very clear 
weather, Goatfell in Arran may be discerned, rearing its conical 
head over Carsphairn church, and it is affirmed that the moun- 
tains in North Wales and the north of Ireland are also visible in 
very favourable circumstances. 

From the Criffell ridge of hills, the parish inchnes gradually to- 
wards the shore, presenting a rich, beautiful, and extensive pro- 
spect, fields well enclosed, and in a high state of cultivation, with 
several clumps and belts of planting. Beyond the Frith, which is 
here about ten miles broad, are seen the mountains of Northum- 
berland, with the rugged peaks of Cumberland and Westmore- 
land, terminating the scene in that direction, and exhibiting an 
outline of bold and fantastic magnificence which cannot fail to 
be highly interesting to all who have a taste for sublime scenery. 

The coast in this parish is generally low and sandy, though it 
is varied by precipices of a considerable height at Arbigland, 
where some singular rocks are to be seen, among which the natu- 
ral Gothic arch, called the Thirl Stane, is the most conspicuous. 
The bay of Carse is the only one of importance. The sands un- 
covered at ebb-tide are very extensive, and render the navigation 
particularly dangerous. The principal headlands are Borrow Point 
and Saturness. 

Climate, Sj C. — The climate is considered very salubrious. Ow- 
ing to the Nith, the water is by no means very salt above the 
mansion-house of Arbigland ; but, below that, the saltness is 
greatly increased, and at Saturness it is considered admirably 
adapted for sea-bathing. The depth of the channel along the 
coast varies from three to five fathoms in ordinary tides. The 
tides flow very rapidly, insomuch that vessels getting aground upon 
the banks are frequently upset and wrecked. The flood -tide has 
been known to tumble a ship's anchor over and over. The chan- 
nel of the Nith is liable to very frequent changes, by some of 
which, enormously large trunks of oak trees are occasionally ex- 
posed, which, though they must have lain prostrate for many cen- 



236 



KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE. 



turies, are converted by some into field rollers, and even into tables 
and ornamental furniture of various descriptions. 

Minerahgxj — The rocks consist of granite, limestone, and a 
species of very coarse sandstone. The whole of the Criffell range 
IS composed of white granite and syenite, with veins of porphyry 
and strata of slate. The limestone occurs on the shore, and in 
the more level portion of the parish, where it is a member of the 
coal formation as it reposes on the rocks of the CrifTell. A lime 
kiln was lately erected at Saturness. The lime is not of the best 
quality, though masons allow it to be very well adapted for build- 
ing—being of a coarse, sandy nature, it requires very little sand 
to render it fit for their use. Coal has been dug for, and indica- 
tions of it have been observed, but not so promising as to encou- 
rage farther outlay. On the coast at Arbigland such fossil re- 
mains occur as are frequently met with in the carboniferous lime- 
stone formation. 

The rocks there all dip towards the sea, and at various angles, 
from nearly horizontal to vertical. Upon these are to be found 
vast rolled masses of granite, for whose appearance, lying as they 
do upon lime and sandstone, and totally detached from granite 
fields, it is very difficult satisfactorily to account. 

Soil. — The soil is various, and is, generally, very productive. 
The steep cultivated fields lying upon granite, require more ma- 
nure, and are not reckoned so rich and fertile as those that are 
more level, and rest upon limestone. After a long process of ma- 
nuring, however, they may be reckoned equal, if not superior. 
Much has been done, and much is still doing in the way of drain- 
ing the low-lying farms, which is greatly improving their appear- 
ance, and adding to their value; and a considerable tract of land, 
called merse, has been protected from the inroads of the sea by a 
very strong and costly embankment, raised by the late Mr R. A. 
Oswald for that purpose, whose spirit and skill as an agriculturist 
are not to be surpassed. The same- process might be most ad- 
vantageously resorted to in the Bay of Drum, at the northern ex- 
tremity of the parish. 

Sooy.— The principal fishes are, cod, flounder, salmon, and 
skate. Herrings are very rarely got, and haddocks never; though, 
in the deep sea off this coast, not only these fishes, but soles, tur- 
bot, &amp;c., might no doubt be caught, were the demand such as to 
call forth enterprise. The salmon go up the river to spawn in the 
month of October, and return in April and March. 



KIRKBEAN. 



237 



The mussels on this coast are large and fine. Oysters have 
never yet been got in abundance. Mussels and shrimps are the 
only fish of this description which can be regarded as useful, in an 
economical point of view. They are sometimes carried to Dum- 
fries for sale, but generally consumed at home. 

Woods.— There is little, if any, natural wood here ; but all com- 
mon kinds seem to thrive well in the plantations. These, however, 
are neither so large nor numerous as either to shelter or beautify 
the parish to the extent which could be desired. At Arbigland 
there are a good many very large and fine silver firs, some of 
them perhaps as much so as any in Scotland, though the largest 
were destroyed in the great storm, 7th January 1839. 

11. — Civil History. 
Eminent Men. — Admiral John Campbell was son of the Rev. 
John Campbell, minister of this parish. He was born 1719, 
and, while very young, sent to sea in a small coasting vessel, 
where his services were so little appreciated, that he was only em- 
ployed in the meanest offices. Afterwards, by distinguished bra- 
very and skill, he rose to the highest honours of the navy, attended 
the celebrated circumnavigator, Anson, in his voyage, commanded 
several of the largest and finest ships in the British navy, and 
died 1790. An inscription upon the bell in the parish church 
shows it to have been the gift of his father. — John Paul, after- 
wards notorious as Paul Jones, was also a native of Kirkbean. 
His father was gardener at Arbigland. The cottage in which they 
lived was repaired, at the expense of Lieutenant Pinkham of the 
American navy, an enthusiastic admirer of our celebrated coun- 
tryman, whom he appeared to rival in professional energy, and 
far surpasses in many of those points which add true dignity and 
worth to the human character. — The late Dr Edward Milligan, 
distinguished as a lecturer on medical science in Edinburgh, like- 
wise owes his birth to this parish. Of this man's energy and 
success as a teacher it would be difficult to speak too highly. His 
father, who died lately, was a stone mason. He himself was for 
a considerable time a shoemaker. As a linguist and mathemati- 
cian, he was in a great measure self-taught, though he had for a 
short time the advantage of being instructed by the Rev. Mr 
Murray, parish schoolmaster. Having made some money in his 
humble profession, he went to college, and, after much patient 
toil in teaching himself and others, acquired not only great 
eminence among the learned, but a considerable fortune in money, 



238 



KIRKCrDDUIGHTSHIRE. 



by means of which, at. his death, his relations have been comfort- 
ably provided. For several years previous to his death, he was 
stone blind; but such was his strength of mind, that his cheerful- 
ness continued unimpaired, and he continued his course of lec- 
tures with great success till his last illness. He died in 1833, 
aged forty-seven. Dr Milligan is a striking instance, among 
many, of what can be achieved by a decided determination to 
literary and ''cientific pursuits, in the face of much discouragement 
and difficulty. 

f Land-owners — The only land-owners are, James Oswald, Esq. 
M. P., of Auchencruive ; D. H. Craik, Esq. of Arbigland ; and 
Mark Stewart, Esq. of Southwick. Of these, Mr Craik is the 
only resident heritor. 

Parochial Registers. — The parish registers do not extend far- 
ther back than 1714; and, till 1824, have been very irregularly 
kept. 

Antiquities. — As to antiquities, Kirkbean has little fo boast. 
There are the remains of a castle, or rather a castellated house, 
at Wreaths; and till of late, there was a similar edifice at Cavens, 
which was once the property of the Regent Morton, and inha- 
bited occasionally by him. At Borrow Point, there are the re- 
mains of a moat and ditch, called M'Culloch's Castle, overlook- 
ing the Solway, the former use of which does not appear to be 
understood ; and at Preston, formerly the property of Lady Glen- 
orchy, distinguished for her piety, there is a stone cross, showing 
where a considerable village once stood. Some time ago, this vil- 
lage is said to have been inhabited by twenty-four tenants ; now 
it is occupied by only one. 

Modern Buildings. — The church was built according to a plan 
of William Craik, Esq., then of Arbigland, in 1776, and is ele- 
gant, convenient, and sufficient. The area has lately been fitted 
up neatly with pews, at the expense of the minister, for the ac- 
commodation of such villagers as had no claim otherwise. A 
very handsome tower, crowned by a dome, has been recently 
erected by subscription of those interested in the parish, and a 
clock presented by Mr Craik of Arbigland. The entire building, 
inside and outside, may be regarded as a model for a country 
parish. Arbigland is one of the handsomest mansion-houses in 
the count}', and kept in the best possible repair, as well as the 
grounds, by its present amiable and much respected owner. Ca- 
vens, a seat of Mr Oswald, though much less imposing in ap-

pearance, is also very tastefully kept, and highly ornamental to the 
neighbourhood. 

III. — Population. 
The population of Kirkbean is about 890. The number of in- 
habitants residing in villages, of which there are four, is about 400. 
The remainder are occupiers of the farms and cottages through- 
out the parish. 

The yearly average of births for the last seven years is 20 ; of 
deaths, 'l3; of marriages, 6. There may be about 30 people 
above seventy years of age. 

The farmers, as a body, are as sober, steady, and skilful a set 
of men, as are anywhere to be found. In point of professional 
intelligence, they would do credit to any district in Scotland. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — The number of acres at present under tillage 
m.ay be about 3680 Scotch, or 4623 imperial acres. There may 
be about as many more, comprehending the mountainous district, 
that never have been cultivated. About 600 Scotch or 753 im- 
perial acres might, with a profitable application of capital, be much 
improved by cultivation, — part of which is at present undergoing 
a course of cropping, with a view to its being laid down in perma- 
nent pasture; but the greater part is a sandy merse, covered 
to a great extent with whins, and would require frequent crop- 
ping, in order to keep it in a profitable state. There are, how- 
ever, about 60 Scotch acres of rich merse land that might be 
brought into constant tillage by embanking, and would pay well 
for the capital expended, if judiciously done. There are about 
673 Scotch, or 845 imperial acres, not in subdivisions, mostly ly- 
ing along the shore. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of the land under tillage is 
about L. 1, 3s. 6d. per Scotch, or 18s. 8|d. per imperial acre. 
Some of the land being very light and sandy, and a portion of it 
high, the rent of such land is low, but the good land gives a fair 
rent; some of it as high as L.2, 10s. per Scotch acre, and a good 
deal about L.l, 10s. per do., while a great part of the bad land 
does not give more than 12s. 6d. There is almost no grazing 
land let for cows, but what is let gives L.4 or L.5 ; and good land 
let in grass for the season, brings about L.2 per Scotch acre. 
No sheep are grazed by the year. When pastured on clover 
after hay, the charge is 3d. per week for each sheep, and 2d. for 
each lamb of six months old. Such land, if there has been a fair 



240 



KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE. 



crop of clover or seeds, may pay about 15s. per Scotch acre. 
The average rent of the grazuig land which never comes under 
the plough, is about 9s. 6d. per Scotch, or 7s. 7d. per imperial 
acre. A considerable portion of it being bad, is not worth more 
than 4s. per Scotch acre, although some of the best grazing land, 
which is reserved for permanent pasture, is let at L.2, 2s. ; the 
very best is let at L. 3. The meadow land averages about L. 1 
per Scotch, or 16s. per imperial acre, a great part of it not being 
good. 

The hill pasture upon CrifFell carries a good stock of Cheviot 
ewes, and rents upon a lease at about 4s. 9d. per ewe, and 2s. Sd. 
per Scotch, or 2s. 2d. per imperial acre. 

Wages. — The rate of wages paid to good ploughmen, without 
washing, is about L.ll, 10s. per annum ; and to benefit our mar- 
ried men, about L.8 in cash, a house, 65 imperial stones of oat- 
meal, 3 bushels of barley, 2 tons of potatoes, and 14 measures of 
coals, amounting in all to about L.19. The day-labourers are 
paid Is. 4d. per day in summer, and Is. 2d. for three months in 
winter; women, 9d. per day throughout the year, harvest except- 
ed. There are very few day-workers in harvest, the harvesters be- 
ing generally hired for the whole harvest. Men get L. 2, 2s., 
women, L.l, 12s., with board and lodging. 

Husbandry/. — There are two dairy farms in this parish, which 
keep about 40 Ayrshire cows each. No more of their calves are 
kept than are required for keeping up the stock. 

Upon the whole, great attention has of late been paid to the 
improvement of all kinds of cattle, which are generally in a state 
highly creditable to their owners. 

The mode of husbandry followed is a five years' rotation upon 
good arable land, and a six or seven years' rotation upon what is 
inferior. The turnip system has recently been introduced, and 
is practised very successfully, and to a great extent. Bone and 
other artificial manure has enabled the farmers to raise a third 
more grain and pasture than could have been raised fourteen 
years ago. 

The general duration of leases is eighteen years. The farm- 
houses and steadings are very commodious, and in good repair. 
The fences are generally good and well kept. The obsta- 
cles to improvement are not great, as the farmers generally are 
fit for their farms, which are always taken at a money rent, with 
the understanding that the landlord is not to expend any money

farther than the necessary imjDrovement upon houses required at 
entry. The rents of the farms in this parish may vary from 
60 to 600 guineas per annum, but many of them will require a 
considerable reduction, unless there is an increase in the price of 
farm produce. 

Produce.— The average amount of raw produce may be esti- 
mated nearly as follows :— 42 bushels per Scotch acre of oats, 
40 bushels per acre of barley, 30 bushels per acre of wheat, 
which, at the average price of late years in this part of the coun- 
try, may be stated at 23. 6d. per imperial bushel of oats, 3s. per 
do. of barley, and 5s. 6d. per do. of wheat ; L.6 per acre, oats ; 
L.6 per do. barley ; and L.8, 5s. per do. wheat, all Scotch mea- 
sure, which gives a gross amount for all grain raised in the parish.

Average gross amount of potatoes at Is. per cwt. 8 tons per acre, 800 0 0

The turnips would give double if pulled, and not eat off upon the land.

The meadow hay will average in its present state about 120 stones per 

acre, at 4d. per stone, or L.2 per acre, . 360 0 0 

The land pastured by cattle and sheep is so very unequal, that it is al- 
most impossible to arrive at any thing like accuracy, but may be 
stated at . . . . 2-300 0 0 



Total yearly value of raw produce, L.13,765 0 0 

The navigation connected with Kirkbean is very limited. Only 
two or three small vessels, of about fifty tons burthen, belong to 
parishioners. These are engaged in the coal and grain trade with 
the opposite coast of Cumberland, Liverpool, and Glasgow. A. 
wooden pier has lately been erected at Carsethorn for the accom- 
modation of the Liverpool steam-packet, which makes two voyages 
weekly in summer, and one in winter, and has been of great ad- 
vantage to the farmers for conveying their fat stock, &amp;c. to a bet- 
ter market than is to be found nearer home. All vessels from 
Dumfries, when meeting with contrary winds, anchor in the bay 

For the above agricultural observations and calculations, which are necessarily 
much abridged, the public is indebted to Mr Paterson in Preston, and Mr Smith in 
Ladyland, two of the most active and intelligent farmers in the south of Scotland. 
It would also be unpardonable, were it not here stated, that this parish, which, in an 
agricultural point of view, ranks among the first in the district, was early imbued with- 
a taste for itnprovement, by the talents and philanthropic energy of the late William 
Craik, Esq. of Arbigland, who devoted a very long life to the unwearied endeavour 
to promote the mterests of the parish and of his country at large.

of Carsethorn; while vessels bound for Dumfries lie here, until 
they are enabled to proceed by the spring-tides. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town. — The market-town for Kirkbean is Dumfries, 
twelve miles distant from the church, and fourteen from the cen- 
tre of the parish. There are four small villages. That of Kirk- 
bean is one of the most beautiful and interesting anywhere to be 
seen. Its situation in a simple rural valley, surrounded by small, 
well-wooded knolls, is altogether delightful, — an apt representa- 
tion of Goldsmith's 

" Sweet Auburn, loveliest village of the plain." 

The beauty of this village is much owing to the liberality of the 
late occupier of Cavens, Lady Mary Oswald, who gave prizes an- 
nually to those villagers who kept their cottages in good order ; 
and also to the present proprietors, who continue this system. 

Means of Communication. — There is a daily post excepting 
Sunday, and a turnpike road to Dumfries. 

Ecclesiastical State.— church is five miles distant from the 
remotest farm-house, and four from the village of Saturness. Still 
it is well placed for the accommodation of the principal part of the 
population. There is abundance of room in the church for all 
church-going, people. The manse was built in 1798. The 
glebe, comprehending garden and the site of manse and offices, 
does not exceed ten acres. They are all in good order. The 
stipend is, as nearly as possible, L.180 per annum. The teinds 
are exhausted. About L.160 are paid in money, the remainder in 
bear or oatmeal at the fiars prices. There are not above four fa- 
milies of old Dissenters in the parish, besides two Catholic fami- 
lies. To this number may now be added about fifteen families 
who have lately joined the Free Kirk, though some of their mem- 
bers still adhere to the Establishment. The church is very well 
attended. The average number of communicants, 240. Average 
amount of church collections per annum, L.30. Probable ave- 
rage of collections annually for religious and charitable purposes, 

L.'io. 

Education. — There are two regularly kept schools. One pa- 
rochial, with two chalders of salary, and the interest of L.608, 4s., 
mortified for a free school or schools, with a good dwelling-house 
and garden. At this school thirty children of the poorer order are 
taught gratis. The other school is distant from the parochial school 
three miles. The teacher in it has the interest of L.400, morti- 



KIRK BE AN. 



243 



Red money, besides wages from those who can affoi-d to pay. 
Another sum of L. 100 has been allotted for this school by the 

writer of this article. _ 

No additional schools are required. There is one public sub- 
scription library, kept by the parish schoolmaster. There is a 
sum of L.350 mortified by certain charitable individuals for the 

support of the poor. 

Poor.— The number of poor on the roll averages twenty. They 
receive their proportion of the funds quarterly, and may, one with 
another, receive L.2, 1 Os. per annum. Besides the above means 
of providing for the poor, there has, for many years, in winter 
been a subscription managed by the minister and the tenants ; and 
thus about L.18 are divided among the poorer description of in- 
habitants, many of whom are not on the parish poor roll. There 
is still generally an aversion among the poorer orders to apply 
for parish aid, but it is gradually wearing off, and several are 
eager enough to be enrolled who might do better. None are per- 
mitted to seek for alms out of the parish, and very few in it. 

Xnns. — There are four inns or alehouses in the parish, all of 
which seem to be required. They do not appear to have a de- 
moralizing effect upon the people. 

Fuel. — The fuel chiefly used is coal from the coast of Cumber- 
land, at 8d. per cwt. Some also make use of wood and peat; but 
peat is not got in the parish, excepting near the top of Criffell. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The system of turnip husbandry, and conveyance of fat stock, 
&amp;c. to the Liverpool market by steam, may be said to constitute 
the most striking variations betwixt the present state of the parish 
and that which existed at the time the last Statistical Account 
was written. It may also be here mentioned that there are now 
two tile-kilns, one on the estate of Mr Craik, another on that of 
Mr Oswald. 

Owing to the great demand for bathing quarters, and the eager- 
ness with which rich and genteel families occupy very indifferent 
cottages at Saturness during the summer months, it cannot be doubt- 
ed that building a number of neat comfortable cottages there, would 
be an excellent speculation. This would even be of great use to 
the poor of the parish, as the church collections would thereby be 
much improved, and thus the heritors would be secured against 
extra demands for their support. 

The farmers and others have, within the last few years, formed 



244 



KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE. 



a society for the relief of vagrant beggars, and, at the same time, 
protecting themselves from their importunities. This system has 
succeeded admirably, the whole fund annually required for this 
purpose not exceeding L.8, and two sleeping apartments being gra- 
tuitously supplied by R. A. Oswald, Esq. 

March 1844.

PRESBYTERY OF DUMFIUES, SYNOD OF DUMFIUES. 

THE REV. JAMES HAMILTON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — There seems plausible ground for assuming that the 
ancient name of this parish was Lochindoloch. This assumption 
rests upon the following quotation from the deed of Charles I. 
erecting the bishoprick of Edinburgh : — " Dedimus personae ad 
dictum Episcopatum de Edinburgh, per nos providendae specia- 
tim totas et integras terras et baronias de Lochindoloch, alias New 
Ahbay, cum omnibus et singulis ecclesiis decimis magnis et mi- 
nutis omnium et singularum ecclesiarum de New Abbay alias 
Lochindoloch, Kirkpatrick-Durham, Buthil, et Crossmichael per- 
tinentibus." To this designation, Lochindoloch, there is an evi- 
dent similarity in the name of the principal lake in the parish. 
Loch Kindar, on an island in which stood the ancient parish church. 
The present name, New Abbey, is given in consequence of the 
parish containing the monastery, which sometimes received that 
name, to distinguish it from the old, or Dundrennan, Abbey, situ- 
ated in the parish of Rerwick, and founded considerably more 
than a century before it. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The length of the parish from north 
to south is fully 10 miles, and its breadth from east to west about 
2 miles. It is bounded on the north, by the parish of Lochrut- 
ton ; on the south, by Kirkbean ; on the east, by Troqueer and 
the river Nith ; and, on the west, by Kirkgunzeon and Col- 
vend. 

Topographical Appearances. — The surface is of irregular ele- 
vation, and, in many places, rough and rocky. Along the whole 



NEW ABBEY. 



245 



western boundary, there is a range of hills, commencing with Low- 
tis on the north, and terminating with Criffell on the south. 
Douglas Cairn, on the top of Criffell, is about 1900 feet above 
the level of the sea. On the north-east side of the parish, there 
is also a ridge of elevated ground about five miles in extent. Be- 
tween the two ridges, there is a strath, varying from a mile to a 
quarter of a mile in breadth, and watered by different streams, 
which, after their junction near the beautiful villa of Kinharvey, 
alias Kilhelvie, are called New Abbey Pow. Near the north end 
of the parish, the surface is level, and towards the south-east there 
is a portion of flat carse land ; but the greatest part of that dis- 
trict slopes from the western hills gently towards the east, till it 
reaches the shore of the Nith, which separates it from Caerlave- 
rock. 

The shore is clayey. The merse is valuable pasture, but the 
extent of it is gradually diminishing by the encroachments of the 
tide. By embankments, many acres of valuable land might be 
recovered. But there is no prospect of this being done by the pre- 
sent generation. 

The prevailing winds are from the south and west, and they 
often blow with tremendous violence. In the tempest of January 
1839, about 30 acres of plantation on the estate of Shambel- 
lie, and worth nearly L.lOO per acre, were uprooted or injured. 

Climate. — Owing to the vicinity of the hills and of the Solway 
Frith, the climate is mild and moist ; but, as the soil in three- 
fourths of the inhabited part of the parish is of an absorbent qua- 
lity, the rain soon sinks, and the moisture does not induce any lo- 
cal distempers. 

Lakes. — There are three lakes in the parish. Lochkindar, at 
the foot of Criffell, on the south, is about a mile long, three-quar- 
ters of a mile wide, and thirty feet deep ; it abounds with excellent 
trout of different kinds. Where the bottom is gravelly, the trout, 
in the colour of its flesh, resembles salmon, and has a delightful 
flavour. Where the bottom is mossy, the flesh is whitish, and 
tastes of the soil. The size varies from a finger-length to eighteen 
inches. In this loch, there are two islands, — on one of which, 
as before noticed, stood, in Popish times, the parish church. A 
few years ago, the late ..proprietor, uninfluenced by any zeal for 
Romish superstitions or relics, slightly repaired the ruined walls, 
added a thatch roof, and fitted up an apartment as a refectory 
during the angling season. This , island may measure half an 



246 



KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE. 



acre in extent, is but a short distance from the land, and accessi- 
ble by a causeway, on which, at times, the water is not above a 
foot deep. It is a sweet spot, studded with trees and bushes ; 
and the cattle having once tasted its delicious herbage, even when 
the water is several feet deep, fearlessly encounter the washing of 
their ribs by wading to gratify their palate. About 70 or 80 
yards farther in, towards the centre of the loch, is a small cir- 
cular island, composed almost entirely of stones, and obviously 
artificial. At one period it was much frequented by sea-gulls as 
a breeding place ; but, for many years past, they have deserted it ; 
and now, in a very slight covering of soil, some trees are growing. 
It rises about six feet above the level of the water. 

Lochend Loch lies at the foot of Lowtis, on the north, is 
smaller than Lochkindar, perhaps fully as deep, and abounds with 
perch, pike, and furnishes a few large trouts, weighing from three 
to five pounds, and having a very thick leathery skin. In it there 
is also a small island, apparently artificial, within a few yards of 
the land, and well wooded. 

Craigend Loch is about a mile distant, towards the north-east 
from Lochend, separated from it by a high ridge of rough rocky 
land, is not nearly so deep, and furnishes some very large pike. 
The bottom of both these lochs is mossy. All the lakes are beau- 
tifully fringed, in mary places, with wood, and, in other places, 
the arable land reaches to the water's edge. Lochkindar sends its 
waters, collected from CrifFell, to New Abbey Pow, which joins 
the Nith. The other two lakes help to form Kirkgunzeon Lane, 
which discharges itself into the water of Urr, near Dalbeattie. 

Rocks. — The predominant rock is syenite. The entire western 
boundary from north to south is composed of this rock. It pre- 
vails throughout the greater portion of the division towards the 
north-east. Nothing else is seen externally, if we except a coarse 
unavailable limestone, which appears in the south-eastern division, 
and a patch of fine greenstone, all on the estates of Drum and 
Corbelly. The peculiarities of the syenite are as follows : — 

\stj It is said to contain hyacinth; but this mineral has been 
rarely found. 2c, It approaches stratification and the columnar 
shapes. A resemblance to the stratified form presents itself on 
the hill of Glensone, at or near the north-western boundary. An 
approach to the columnar shape is found in detached spots. For 
example, there are two or three blocks at the Roan on the Crif- 
fcll side of Lochkindar, having a four- sided aspect, considered co- 



NEW ABBEY. 



247 



lumnar But a better example is observable in a small united 
group near the top of Drumburn, on Criffell. 3., Around the edge 
of Lochkindar a siliceous sand is driven ashore from the lake and 
is supposed to be a detritus from Criffell. The sand, when pulver- 
ized, is valuable for the purpose of sharpening scythes. 

On the farm of Craigend, there is a rocking-stone, estimated to 
weigh about fifteen tons, and yet a child may put it m motion. It 
was first discovered, about fifteen years ago, by two little girls, 
sisters, who, while playing about it, noticed its vibrations, and with 
astonishment reported them to their parents. It is a block of sy- 
enite : its position is on a piece of hard land surrounded by mossy 
or swampy ground : it is quite insulated. 

Soil.— The arable land of the greatest and best part of the pa- 
rish is a mixture of loam and gravel. There is, however, in this 
or south-east district a portion of alluvial clay.; and the north end 
of the parish is composed of clay, or moss upon a till bottom. 
This is wet, and not easily drained, as the tenacious subsoil does 
not allow the springs to discharge their water by filtration into the 
drains at even a few yards distance, but forces it to the surface 
in their immediate neighbourhood, so that, unless the drain cut 
the spring, it is inefiicient. In various parts of the parish, symp- 
toms of coal have been reported ; but either no efforts have been 
made to trace them, or they have proved abortive, as is said to have 
been the case on the estate of Kinharvey:and Corbelly. 

Fish.— A few salmon wandering from the Nith have, about 
spawning time, in October, November, and December, been 
found in the Pow ; and vast quantities of flounders have been 
caught on the sand-banks of the Nith, the eastern boundary of the 
parish for about two miles. 

Woods— The plantation and natural timber in the parish ex- 
tends to about 600 acres, of which 350 belong to Mr Stewart of 
Shambelly, who commenced planting at a very early period of life, 
nearly seventy years ago, and has lived to reap the fruits of his 
improvements, by drawing nearly L.lOO per acre from land, which, 
in its natural state, afforded nothing but a scanty coarse herbage, 
browsed by goats, and not worth 2s. 6d. per acre. The planta- 
tions consist of Scotch fir, larch, beech, oak, and ash, which all 
thrive well.

bourhood of the abbey, and received, by the hands of Robert 
Winchelsey, Archbishop of Canterbury, a Bull from Pope Boni- 
face YlU.,redaiym7ig the King's claioi to the superiority of Scot- 
land, and setting forth the title of his Holiness to that kingdom, 
as a part of Peter's patrimony. The Archbishop's narrative', 
dated October 1300, may be seen in Prynne's History of Edward, 
and contains an account of his Grace's detention at Carlisle till 
he could find out where the King was, and a minute detail of his 
perils by land, by water, and by men. 

The Bull was duly delivered ; the King held a council upon it ; 
but, as it concerned the welfare of England, he declined giving 
any reply till he should consult the States. Soon after, he dis- 
banded his army, and proceeded to Lincoln, where a parliament 
was assembled to prepare an answer. The Bull is endorsed, 
Memorandum quod Dominus Rex tradidit Domino J. de Lange- 
ton, Cancellario suo apud Northampton 24 die Decembris, anno 
regis 20, Bullam quam Archiepiscopus Cantuariensis tulit eidem 
Domino Regi apud Cartanoks in Scotia. 

Soon after the battle of Waterloo, the inhabitants of New Ab- 
bey, aided by the contributions of a few other individuals, animated 
by those sentiments of gratitude and admiration which at that 
time pervaded all classes of British subjects towards the illustri- 
ous Duke of Wellington and his brave army, erected a monument 
to commemorate that great and important victory. It is a gra- 
nite column 50 feet high by 16 feet diameter, with a winding stair 
inside, and stands on an eminence called Glen hill rising about 
400 feet above the level of the sea. It is seen all over the southern 
part of Nithsdale, as well as the Solway Frith, and along the coast 
of Cumberland. f 

 The following extract contains all that relates to New Abbey : — " Denique cum

Antianities -Um within one of the church windows are two 
stones, which throw light t.pon thehistory of the abbey of Sweetheart. 
Ononeof them are cutin large Roman capitals thetwo last syllables 
of the name of its foundress, gvlla fvdatrix. On the other 
stone, which has evidently been a continuation of the same hne 
of building, are cut in the same kind of letters m.e.lxxxiiii, ex- 
pressincr clearly 1284. But whether this date is to be understood 
as markino- the time when the abbey was completed, or ot the 
death of tlie foundress, does not certainly appear, as there is no 
information whether these stones formed a part of the Abbey walls, 
or of a monument erected in or near it. 

The inscription is quite conclusive as to the foundress of the 
Abbev, who was DevorguUa, daughter of Allan, Lord of Gallo- 
way niece to David, Earl of Huntingdon, wife of John Baliol, 
and' mother of John Baliol, King of Scotland. Her husband 
died in 1279, and was buried here. His heart having been 
embalmed, and put into an ivory box bound with silver, was 
solemnly deposited within the walls of the church, near the high 
altar, from which the Abbey took the name of Sweetheart. In 
the arch of that part of the choir, which is to the south of 
the cross, are two key-stones, on which are cut a heart and two 
roses, with two crosiers, and this inscription, Christus waritus 
mens; alluding to the dedication of the church to the Virgin 
Mary, as well as to the piety of the widow, who here deposited 
the heart of her husband. The refectory of the abbey stood op- 
posite the church, and was used for Divine service till 1731, when, 
falling to decay, it was, in part, taken down, and a new church erect- 
ed. Under the refectory was the kitchen, with several vaults. 
The chapter-house adjoined the old church. Above it was the 
abbot's house. The dormitories stood to the east beyond the 
abbot's house. All these are now completely demolished ; and, 
but for the interposition of the late minister, the abbey itself would, 
in all probability, have been in the same state ; for it having fal- 
len into the hands of persons who had no antiquarian enthusiasm, 
and who estimated their purchase only by its worth as a quarry, 
they commencedpulling down the consecrated fabric to get ma- 
terials for building houses in the village. The minister, however, 
with very different sentiments, succeeded in obtaining subscrip- 
tions to purchase it ; and, for forty guineas, saved it from destruc-

tion. It is now secured from farther dilapidation except what 
comes inevitably from the hand of time. 

Length of the abbey from east to west, 194 feet ; breadth, in- 
cluding transept, 63 feet ; the cross, from north to south, 102 feet • 
height of the tower about 90 feet. The particular year of its erec- 
tion is uncertain. 

The monks belonging to the abbey were of the Cistertian or- 
der, instituted in 1098. 

In the 24th of Edward I. John, Abbe de Douzquer, swore fealty 
at Berwick, and renounced connection with the King of France, 
and was in consequence restored to his lands, which had been 
seized. Gilbert Brown, descended of the family of Garsleuth, 
was the last abbot. He sat in Parliament 17th August J 560, whilst 
the Confession of Faith was approved, and, in 1 605, he was appre- 
hended by the Lord Cranstoun, Captain of the Guards, appoint- 
ed for the Borders, and was sent to Blackness, and, after some 
days, was transported to the Castle of Edinburgh, where he was 
confined till he left the kingdom. He died at Paris, 14th May 
1612. 

The Lord Maxwells, ancestors of the Earl of Nithsdale, were 
heritable bailies of this monastery ; and Sir Robert Spotiswoode, 
President of the Court of Session, and secretary to Charles I., 
being possessed of this abbey in temporal lordship, was, from it, 
called Lord New Abbey. 

Distant about half a mile from the abbey, on the farm of Lan- 
dis, stand the ruins of a square building called the Abbot's tower, 
which, as well as the Abbey, is partly mantled over with ivy, and 
the residence of owls, jackdaws, and swifts during their short vi- 
sits to these northern regions. 

Coins. — A few copper coins, very thin, and of the breadth of a 
sixpence, have been dug up in the vicinity of the abbey, and two 
of them are now in the hands of the minister. 

Some years ago, in a very dry summer, there were taken out of 
Lochend loch, two metal pots, capable of containing three or four 
gallons, evidently of very ancient manufacture. They are now in 
the possession of D. Hamilton Craik, Esq. of Arbigland, on whose 
property they were found. Another pot, of similar materials, but 
of smaller dimensions, was, some years ago, dug up near the abbot's 
tower, and remains with the tenant of the farm. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners are, R. A. Oswald, Esq.

of Auchencruive ; William Stewart, Esq. of Shambelly ; James 
Carrick Moore, Esq. of Carsewell; Constable Maxwell, Esq. of 
Terreo-les ; and D. H. Craik, Esq. of Arbigland. 

Parochial Registers.— The parochial registers of baptisms, mar- 
riao-es, and church discipline commence in May 1691, when Mr 
Harvey was minister, and have been kept with considerable regu- 
larity. The register of burials has been less attended to, but not 
altogether neglected by the succeeding incumbents.  The early 
part of the disciphne Register evinces a vigilance of inquiry into 
the private conduct of individuals, and a severity of punishment 
which are unknown in the present day. 

Mansion-Houses, §-c.— Mr Stewart of Shambelly has two nnan- 
sion-houses ; one, of great antiquity, in the village, where he resides, 
and another at a short distance, built by himself. The situation 
of the latter is very delightful, being so elevated as to command a 
view of Caerlaverock Castle, Solway Frith, CriflFell, Waterloo mo- 
nument, the abbey, the proprietor's extensive plantations, and the 
public road to Carsethorn, by which public carriages regularly go 
to and from the Nithsdale steamer. The fanciful villa of Kin- 
harvey, lately purchased for shooting quarters by Mr Maxwell 
of Terregles, and about to be enlarged and embellished, arrests 
the eye of every traveller, as he passes through the strath where 
it is situated. 

The parish church was repaired about thirty-four years ago ; 
and, since that time, two galleries have been fitted up in it ; one, 
containing ninety seats, was erected by the heritors, and allotted 
to themselves and their tenants; the other was erected by subscrip- 
tions of the parishioners and some heritors. The whole church is 
commodious and comfortably seated. 

A Romish chapel was erected about seventeen years ago. Its 
appearance is neat ; and there is attached to it a house for the 
priest. For the last seven years, there has been no officiating 
priest. 

About thirty years ago, the Society of Free Masons and a 
Friendly Society erected a hall for their meetings ; but it has since 
been sold, and is now used as a ball-room, and for other public 
purposes. 

There are a grain-mill, a mill for carding and spinning wool, and 
a saw-mill, which employs about ten persons. The timber pre- 
pared at the saw-mill is generally shipped to Liverpool.

There are eleven proprietors of land of the yearly value of L.50 
and upwards, only two of whom are resident. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — There are occasionally tilled 3215 Scotch acres- 
uncultivated, 5371, of which, even at present prices, not above 
100 acres could be profitably added to the cultivated land; 600 
acres are under wood. 

Rent. — The average rent of arable land, per acre, may be 
about L.l, 5s. On the fine pasture near the village, a cow's grass 
for the year is L.5 ; a sheep's grass may be estimated at 5s. The 
gross rental of the parish for arable and pasture land is nearly 
L. 5000 : the rent of houses, with small gardens attached, is 
about L.250. 

Wages. — In summer, labourers' wages are 8s. or 9s., and in 
winter, 7s. 6d, weekly; joiners, 14s. ;. masons, 15s., without vic- 
tuals ; tailors, 7s. 6d. with victuals. . 

Sheep. — In the low lands there are a few of the Leicester breed 
of sheep, not, however, of the purest kind. On the hills, the black- 
faced species prevails. On one farm, which keeps about fifteen 
scores, an attempt is making to introduce the Cheviot. 

Leases. — The leases are generally for fifteen or eighteen years. 

Fences. — The fences in the arable lands consist principally of 
granite dikes, from four to five feet high, partly double to the 
height of two feet, the rest single. The enclosures are propor- 
tioned to the size of the farms, quality of the soil, and other local 
circumstances. 

Farm- Buildings. — The farm-buildings are all good. There are 
eighteen thrashing-mills in the parish, the one-half of them driven 
by water. 

Improvements. — The principal improvements lately made have 
been in draining : also, about 100 acres have been planted on Kin- 
harvey. 

Fishing. — There is no rented fishery in the parish ; but the in- 
habitants have a right to fish in the Nith, opposite the parish, with 
halve and leister, upon paying a third to the proprietor, Mr Os-

The revenue arising from young pigs and young horses sold out 
of the parish cannot be ascertained, but must be inconsiderable. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 

Harbours. — New Abbey Pow is navigable at spring-tides for 
vessels of 60 or 70 tons, to within a mile from the village. The 
lime and coals required by the parish are generally discharged 
in it. The harbour is in a very bad state. Were it improved, it 
would be more resorted to, and the inhabitants benefited. 

Market-Town. — Dumfries, distant seven miles, is the nearest 
market-town, and supplies a ready demand for all sorts of agricul- 
tural produce. 

Villages. — About ten families reside at Drumburn, which, ex- 
cept New Abbey, is the only place in the parish that can be called 
a village. 

Means of Communication. — New Abbey has a daily post from 
Dumfries, carriers twice a-week, and coaches to and from Dum- 
fries and Carsethorn every alternate week. There are about two 
miles of turnpike road passing through the north-west end of the 
parish, and on it two coaches travel six days a-week to Kirk- 
cudbright. There are four miles of turnpike road in the south- 
east side of the parish. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is conveniently situate for 
the population, which is by far most numerous in the low end of 
the parish. It is distant from the south-east extremity fully three 
miles, and about seven miles from the north-west boundary. In- 
cluding the galleries, it affords accommodation for about 470 sit- 
ters, exclusive of the area, where the communion table is placed. 
The manse was built in 1802. A kitchen was added about nine- 
teen years ago. The repairs since have been very trifling. The 
glebe consists of 10 acres, including garden and houses, and is 
worth L.20. The stipend is 16 chalders, half meal and half bar-

ley, witli L.8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. From time im- 
memorial, the minister has possessed ten dargues of peats in a de . 
fined part of the Craig Moss, as a part of his benefice. But 
the present incumbent has been dragged into a litigation in de- 
fence of this privilege. 

The people are well affected to the Established Church, and 
have resisted various attempts to detach them from it. 

The late minister's settlement, in 1769, was literally a violent 
one. In point of character and talent he was unobjectionable ; 
but, by sinister arts, the people were roused to resist his induc- 
tion, and it was not without danger to their lives that the presby- 
tery succeeded in ordaining him. By conciliating manners, and 
friendly services to all his neighbours, without reference to the 
part which any might have acted in regard to his settlement, he 
soon molhfied his infuriated parishioners, became acceptable to all, 
and lived in harmony with them for fifty-one years. As in the 
case of the celebrated Dr Reid, the people fought against him 
when he came, and would have fought with equal keenness to keep 
him, had any attempted to take him away. The lesson has not 
been lost upon the present generation. 

The Roman Catholic chapel is within the diocese of Edin- 
burgh. 

There are 235 families in the parish, consisting of 935 indivi- 
duals professedly belonging to the Established Church, and 35 
families of 115 individuals belonging to various sects of Dissenters, 
including 67 Roman Catholics, or persons commonly reputed 
such. The parish church is well attended. The average num- 
ber of communicants is nearly 300. Collections for religious pur- 
poses are always liberal, but not frequent. 

Education. — There are five schools in the parish, three paro- 
chial and two unendowed, besides a Sabbath school taught and 
supported by the minister and assistants. 

In the principal school, Greek, Latin, geography, navigation, 
arithmetic, mensuration, book-keeping, writing, and English are 
taught. In two of the other schools, the same branches, except- 
ing navigation and Greek, are usually taught. In the remaining 
two, classical literature is not required. The salary of the 
principal schoolmaster is L.29, 18s. 9|d., and the teacher has a 
right to the interest of L.150. One school has L.IO, 13s. lOd. 
of salary and the interest of L.54, and the other has the same. 
A good dwelling-house is attached to the principal school.

Librari/.—¥ov upwards of thirty years, there has been a pa- 
rochial Ubrary. The books are generally standard works of his- 
tory, travels, and divinity ; novels being expressly excluded. 

Savings ianA.— About twenty years ago, a Savings bank was 
established, but after ten or twelve years' trial, it was abandoned. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The average number of persons 
upon the poor's roll is 30, who each receive on an average, in meal, 
money, and coals, about L.3 yearly. Others occasionally receive 
aid ; and when the necessities of the regular poor are increased 
by disease or other temporary causes, an addition is made to their 
usual allowance, and L.l is always granted to the person who de- 
frays the funeral expenses of any one upon the roll. The means 
at the command of the session for meeting this expenditure are, 
the rent of a farm yielding L.l 10, the interest of mortifications, 
and church collections, amounting on an average to L.20 yearly. 
Nearly L. 200 have been expended in rebuilding farm-houses, 
about L.70 for a charter and feu-duties, and upwards of L.30 for 
valuing teinds. These outlays were made from the mortifica- 
tions, and are to be repaid by instalments, which has been partially 
done. But till the whole be paid up, the poor will not receive the 
full benefit of their apparently ample inheritance. The high and 
independent spirit of Scotland's poor still hovers over the parish, 
but rests only on one in a hundred. The farm was purchased in 
1756, at L.220, consisting of a mortification of L.156 for behoof 
of the poor, by Bailie Paterson of Dumfries, L.14 of accumulated 
interest, and L.50 of collections that had been saved. Mr Pa- 
terson was a native of the parish. He also erected the bridge at 
the entrance to the village from Dumfries, as is commemorated 
by the following inscription : " Erected by Bailie John Paterson, 
late of Dumfries, 1715." 

jnns. — There are four inns in the parish, and of these three 
are in the village.

PRESBYTERY OF DUMFRIES, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. GEORGE GREIG, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — In Wodrow's History of the Sufferings of the Church 
of Scotland, we find this parish to have been formerly distinguished 
as Kirkpatrick on the Muir, but this name has long been laid aside. 
Kirkpatrick is an appellation which it bears in common with seve- 
ral parishes in the south of Scotland. " Durham is most probably 
derived," says Dr Lament, the author of the former Account of 
this parish, " from the Saxon words durr, which signifies dry or 
barren, and ham, which denotes a village or division of a manor. 
If this derivation be just, Durham becomes descriptive of a coun- 
try that is dry and barren, an appellation that is peculiarly appli- 
cable to the situation, and soil, and surface of this particular dis- 
trict." 

Extent, Sc. — The parish stretches from north to south in a pretty 
regular form to the extent of about 10 miles : its breadth seldom 
exceeding 4, and nearly averaging 3. If we take nine miles as 
the length, exclusive of extreme points, we shall have about 31 
square miles as its extent of surface. It is bounded by the pa- 
rishes of Urr and Crossmichael, on the south ; by Parton and Bal- 
maclellan, on the west ; by Glencairn and Dunscore, on the north ; 
and by Holywood and Kirkpatrick- Irongray, on the east. 

Topographical Appearances. — Though the general elevation of 
the parish is considerable, it contains no lofty mountains, and the 
heights which diversify its surface consist chiefly of craggy hills, 
which partake of the geological character of the surrounding dis- 
trict. In many places these ranges have not as yet been cultivat- 
ed to their summits, and are now crowned with thriving planta- 
tions. Towards the north lies the Muir of Kirkpatrick, a high 
bleak district, consisting chiefly of pasture for black-cattle and

KIRKPATRICK'DURIIAM. 



257 



sheep, and in many places producing nothing more profitable than 
benty grass or heather. 

Hydrography. — The Urr, which is the only river connected 
with the parish, rises in its north-west corner from a lake of the 
same name, and flows rapidly through a romantic valley, forming 
the western boundary of Kirkpatrick-Durham from one end to the 
other, and reaching the sea about ten miles beyond the southern 
extremity of the parish. There are a few inconsiderable lakes, 
which afford amusement to those who delight in angling, but con- 
tribute little either to the general beauty or advantage of the 
country. 

Geology and Mineralogy, — There have been as yet no disco- 
veries of useful minerals. Nodules of lead were at one time met 
with in a field on the estate of Chipperkyle ; but it has been con- 
jectured, with some probability, that these were not the production 
of the spot. 

Soil. — In the lower district of the parish, the soil is in general 
tolerably fertile ; and, though in many places thin and sandy, 
where judiciously managed, yields rich and luxuriant crops of 
grain. A large proportion of the surface consists of fine old pas- 
ture, which furnishes a kindly and often highly profitable nourish- 
ment to the herds of black-cattle for which the district is famous. 

The salmon-fishing of the Urr, it is to be regretted, has of 
late years become extremely unproductive. It is not many years 
since the proprietors on its banks used to procure very conside- 
rable quantities of this valuable fish at trifling expense or trouble ; 
but now it is comparatively very seldom to be had. The cause of 
this has been variously stated. There can be no doubt that 
poaching is carried on during the whole winter by torch-light, de- 
stroying the mother-fish, and thus almost annihilating the breed ; 
and, what is infinitely more to be regretted, promoting, it is to be 
feared, a spirit of lawlessness and dishonesty quite inconsistent 
with the good order of society. Part of the evil probably arises 
from the extensive stake-net fisheries at the river's mouth, which 
intercept the fish in their way from the sea ; and from the erec- 
tion of the wiers and dams which the different mills on its banks 
require. The period when the salmon ascend this river for 
spawning cannot be very accurately stated. The shallowness 
of the stream frequently prevents their appearance till after the 
ordinary time, and, in dry seasons, they do not reach its higher 
parts till so late as November. The other fishes most freque°ntlv

met with in the Urr are trout and pike, and the lakes furnish 
perch and eels. 

Woods.— Theve are no woods of any extent within the parish. 
Along the banks of the river are the remains of a natural forest, 
which the successive encroachments of modern agriculture have 
reduced to very scanty dimensions, but which still add greatly 
to the picturesque beauties of this romantic stream. 

II. — Civil History. 

The secluded character of this parish has prevented it from 
ever becoming the scene of important historical events. During 
that dark period of Scottish history, however, which elapsed while 
the second Charles and his successor were endeavouring to bind 
the yoke of despotism around the necks of their northern subjects, 
we find its inhabitants inspired by the same ardent zeal which dis- 
tinguished their countrymen in the noble cause of religious and 
civil liberty, and more than one martyr's tomb in the neighbour- 
hood still recalls to the patriot the time, when, upon these fields, 
the cause of Scotland's freedom was contested. Mr Gabriel 
Semple, of the family of Cathcart in Renfrewshire, the outed mi- 
nister of this parish, was one of the distinguished witnesses for the 
truth which that remarkable age produced. Some interesting 
particulars of his life are detailed in Wodrow's Church History, 
and Murray's Literary History of Galloway. He lived to see the 
completion of his most ardent wishes at the glorious Revolution 
of 1688, when he was recalled to Scotland, and chosen to the pas- 
toral care of the parish of Jedburgh, where he continued in the 
zealous discharge of the duties of his office till the year 1706, when 
he died at a very venerable age. 

Anliquities.— This parish presents but a barren field for anti- 
quarian research. In various quarters there are the remains of 
circular walls and mounds, which in this district, and throughout 
the Stewartry where they abound, have received the name oi moats. 
What these have been, or for what purposes erected, cannot at 
this remote period be distinctly ascertained. Certain it is, that, 
as places of strength, none of them, even when in their most per- 
fect state, could have long resisted the effects of a cannonade, 
whence it may be argued that their origin ought to be referred 
to a period prior to the general use of fire-arms. That they are 
to be traced to the Roman invaders seems highly improbable, 
both from their number and peculiar form, while the idea that 
they are Druidical remains, is, for similar reasons, equally unte- 



KIRKPATRICK-DURHAM.

nable. It seems most likely that these curious structures have 
been meant as places of security for cattle during those lawless 
periods when the Border olans extended their ravages far and 
wide, making open plunder their sole profession. This idea 
seems to be supported by the fact that, in many retired corners 
of the Muir of Kirkpatrick, there are to be met with the remains 
of stone dikes which have once formed circular enclosures, uni- 
versally understood to have been used as places of safety and con- 
cealment for cattle during the predatory incursions of " the thieves 
of Annandale." On one of the moats just alluded to, which is 
ttituate on the estate of Doonpark, there were found a few years 
since some remains of ancient armour. Owing to the ignorance 
of the discoverer, however, these were speedily converted into im- 
plements more useful, if not more curious than the " auld nick- 
nackets" which adorn the shelves of the antiquary, and any in- 
formation they were calculated to afford was thus lost. The only 
remnant of early architecture to be met with in the parish, is the 
foundation of an old church on the estate of Areeming, which, 
though no records remain to tell its history, in all probability 
gave its name to the neighbouring farm of Kirklebride. 

III. — Population. 
The amount of population, by the returns made to Dr Webster, 
was 699. Towards the close of last century, it was reckoned at 
1000. The Government census since that period affords the fol- 
lowing numbers : 

In 1801, - 1007 
1811, . 1156 
1821, . 1473 
1831, - 1486 
1841, - 1487 

The rapid increase which took place about the end of last cen- 
tury, has been traced by Dr Lament to the formation of a new 
and most beneficial road which leads to a harbour at the mouth 
of the Urr, the introduction of manufactures, and the change of 
plan adopted by proprietors in letting their estates, by which, 
what had been formerly occupied by one tenant was divided intp 
several farms, each let to a separate individual. 

There can be no doubt that these were the true causes, and 
they are quite sufficient to account for the effect. The gradual 
increase which has since taken place, in common with that which 
is observable in the country at large, may be traced to its general 
improvement and extended resources.

Mansion- Houses. — There are no fewer than six mansion-houses 
in the parish, occupied by their respective proprietors, or te- 
nants in an equally respectable station, who in most cases re- 
side here during the whole year; while the adjoining parishes 
are every where dotted with the comfortable homes of families 
of independent fortune. The neighbourhood is thus render- 
ed in the highest degree agreeable; and the well-known hos- 
pitality of the gentry has given it the not inappropriate title of the 
Court of Galloway. Within the bounds of this parish there are 
twenty-one proprietors of land of the yearly value of L.50 and 
upwards, of whom ten are resident. 

The number of unmarried men above fifty may be stated with 
tolerable accuracy at 49 ; that of unmarried women above forty- 
five, at 66. 

There are resident in the parish, one individual who has not 
the use of his reasoning faculties, and three who are blind or nearly 
so. 

Character of the People. — The people, in general, are orderly, 
quiet, industrious, and contented. In the principal village the un- 
necessary multiplication of public-houses at one time contributed 
to demoralize a certain class of the inhabitants, and to introduce 
wretchedness, disease, and beggary ; but at present the abuse of 
ardent spirits is comparatively but little witnessed, while the regu- 
larity of attendance upon public ordinances, and the anxiety evinced 
by parents to afford their children the blessings of education, give 
us reason to believe, that the character of the inhabitants comes 
fully up to the average of their countrymen, in respect to intelli- 
gence, morality, and religion. It is, however, much to be regret- 
ted, that offences against the game-laws are frequent, and tend 



KIEKFATRICK-DURIIAM. 



261 



here, as elsewhere, to introduce among the young men habits of 
idleness, and a disregard of the laws, which not only destroy their 
own respectability, but threaten to entail distressing effects upon 
the succeeding Generation. 

IV. — Industry. 

The number of acres may be stated in round numbers at 
20,000, of which about 8000 are either cultivated or occa- 
sionally in tillage. A great portion of the remainder is used 
as pasture for black-cattle or sheep, while a considerable tract 
is included under the names of bogs, mosses, and muirs. The 
wood covers perhaps 400 or 500 acres. Of the uncultivated 
land a large proportion lies in the northern district of the parish ; 
and there are many hundred acres in that quarter capable of 
yielding a very profitable return to an enterprising capitalist. 
With the exception of the natural wood, which is to be found 
chiefly on the estates of Kilquhanity and Kirklebride, the trees in 
this parish are for the most part but recently planted, and consist 
of the common hard-wooded kinds, which are largely intermixed 
with larch in order to aff'ord them the necessary protection from 
severe winds. The average rent of land over the whole parish 
may be stated at 7s. per imperial acre ; but in the southern and 
western districts it may fairly be estimated at L.l or L.l, 5s. 

The rate of labour varies in winter from Is. to Is. 4d. a day, and 
in summer from Is. 4d. to Is. 8d. The mode of husbandry will be 
found to differ very little, if at all, from that pursued in the neigh- 
bouring district. The attention of the farmers is chiefly directed 
to the breeding and rearing of black-cattle for the southern mar- 
kets. Their leases generally last for fifteen years, and their houses 
and onsteads are convenient and comfortable. 

It would be impossible to give any accurate account of the 
value of the annual produce of different sorts yielded by the soil. 
The annual rental of the parish is about L.G600. A great pro- 
portion of the farmers engage in the cattle trade, either speculat- 
ing on their own account, or acting as commission agents for the 
great dealers. The trade is proverbially insecure, its success or 
failure in each enterprise depending on a rise or fall of prices, 
which very generally can neither be foreseen nor controlled. 

Manufactures. — There is no branch of manufactures carried on 
to any extent in the parish. The different societies for the en- 
couragement of trade, manufactures, and commerce, mentioned in 
Dr Lament's account, have long since died a natural death, and 



262 



KlRKCUDBUlGHTSHiufi. 



now there are neither artisans nor manufacturers within our boun- 
daries, whose services are required beyond the immediate neigh- 
bourhood, 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market- 7 mvn, c— The nearest market is afforded by the 
thriving Httle town of Castle Douglas, which lies about six miles 
south-west of the village of Kirkpatrick. There is a post-office af 
the village, and a daily delivery and dispatch. A post-cart, which, 
along with the mail, carries light goods, travels between Kirkpa- 
trick and Castle Douglas, by which the household wants of the 
community are chiefly supplied. The great road from Portpatrick 
to Dumfries skirts the southern boundary of the parish for five 
miles, offering a means of ready communication with every quar- 
ter of the kingdom. Besides the mail, a heavy coach passes from 
Dumfries to Kirkcudbright and back on six days of the week. 
At Crocketford, a road branches off towards New Galloway and 
the Glenkens; but there is at present no public conveyance in that 
direction. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is situate in the southern ex- 
tremity of the parish. It was built a. d. 1748, and bears all the 
marks of its early date. About thirty-tive years ago, in conse- 
quence of the increased demand for church accommodation, a num- 
ber of the inhabitants were at the expense of erecting an aisle, 
which increased the sittings to three hundred and seventy-five, a 
number greatly below the proportion legally requisite for the 
amount of population. The manse was built in the year 1838. 
The glebe contains upwards of six acres, and consists of tolerably 
good land. The teinds are exhausted, and the stipend amounts 
to L.271. 

Before the late secession from the Establishment, the numbers 
connected with the different religious societies might have been 
stated as follows: Established Church, 1284; Dissenters and Se- 
eeders, 158 ; Episcopalians, 12 ; Roman Catholics, 32. Among 
the Dissenters and Seceders in the preceding table, are included 
two aged individuals, a man and a woman, resident at Crocket- 
ford, the last venerable remnant of a fonatical sect, the followers 
of a woman named Buchan, who arose in Ayrshire about forty 
years ago, — and who, to the amount of forty men and women, 
including a minister of the Relief Church and a member of the legal 
profession, after having been persecuted from one district to another 
for several years, at length took up their abode in this parish, where 



KIRKFATllICK-DURHAM. 263 

tbey have resided with little intermission ever since.- This inno- 
cent but enthusiastic society have always possessed - —y 
of goods, and now that their numbers are so small, " 
circumstances are more than comfortable. Among other sm- 
gularities, they refuse to acknowledge the band of marnage 
but the most striking peculiarity by which then- opmions were 
at first distinguished, consisted in the belief that the members 
of their sect should never die, and that, under the guidance 
of their female seer, they were to be translated in a body to 
the New Jerusalem. This expectation having been disappomted, 
notwithstanding the severe and lengthened fasts which they un- 
derwent in order to facilitate their flight,-and death having inter- 
posed his unquestionable negative to their doctnne by summon- 
ing their leader to her last account, they found it necessary to re 
linquish the most fanatical of their opinions, and, though with se- 
veral exceptions, among whom is to be reckoned the clerical 
member already noticed, they continued to preserve their seclu- 
sion from the world,— their manners, which had always been in-, 
offensive and peaceable, became gradually assimilated to those 
of their neighbourhood,— and they are now to be distinguished 
only by the simplicity of their demeanour, and a few religious pe- 
culiarities of the most unobtrusive description. The old man, 
who still survives, possesses a large fund of intelligence, and 
amuses himself by writing many a dissertation on points connected 
with his peculiar creed, which, though not theologically orthodox, 
evince a mind much above the ordinary standard. 

A " Free Church" has been lately erected in the village, which 
is attended by a large proportion of the people. 

Education.— the three public schools in the parish, two are 
on the Establishment. The expense of education is the same here 
as in the neighbouring parishes. Theprincipal schoolmaster, whose 
place of instruction is situated at the village, is entitled to the largest 
rate of salary, subject to a small deduction for the support of a 
school at Crocketford, besides a considerable annual sum derived 
from money mortified many years ago for his benefit. The inha- 
bitants seem, in general, fully alive to the blessings of education, 
and the whole population, with hardly a single exception, are 
taught to read and write. There are a few poor families resident 
in the upper end of the parish, whose places of abode are situate 
at so great a distance from any of the schools as to preclude their 
deriving from them any benefit, A teacher is therefore generally

KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRK. 



Iiired for the winter, who resides alternately in each house in tlie 
district, instructing such children as are sent to him by the neigh- 
bouring families. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— -The number of persons at present 
on the poor roll, several of whom have families chiefly dependent 
on what they receive from the parochial fund, is much increased 
of late, and the average sum afforded to each is miserably small. 
The session funds arise from collections in church and a voluntary 
assessment annually imposed by the heritors. The sum of L. 5 
besides, arising from money mortified for this charitable purpose, 
is yearly distributed to five such poor persons as the kirk-session 
judge to be the fittest objects. 

Pairs.— There is still an annual fair held in the village of Kirk- 
patrick in March, but the assemblage of attendants has vastly 
diminished, and the horse races and balls have dwindled into a very 
paltry representation of what they seem formerly to have been. 

Inns. — There are four public-houses in the parish, which, in 
general, are conducted in a respectable manner. 

Fuel.— The parish was long amply supplied with fuel from the 
mosses with which it abounds, but of late years this valuable arti- 
cle has become scarce. Peats are still obtained in small quanti- 
ties both in this and the neighbouring district; but the chief arti- 
cle of consumption under this head is coal, which is procured from 
the English skippers, who import it from the opposite coast, and 
sell it to their customers at the harbour of Dalbeattie, at the ave- 
rage rate of 7s. 6d. a cart load. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Since the last Statistical Account was written, the general aspect 
of the parish has been most materially changed. Then, there were 
but one or two houses that could claim any superiority over those 
of the farmers, and these last again were but a very small step re- 
moved above the humble thatched cottages of their servants and 
labourers. Now, almost every considerable estate has its mansion, 
and its neat garden and tasteful shrubbery. Heath and furze then 
occupied large tracts of ground, which are now covered by thriv- 
ing wood, or cleared for the pasture of cattle and the growing of 
corn. Then, only a few tracks existed to point out the direction 
which the traveller should pursue, without aiding him materially in 
his journey. Now, smooth and well engineered roads intersect 
the parish in all directions. 

Other , changes too have taken' [lacc. The manufactures which 



KIRKPATRICK-IRONGUAY. 



265 



at that time were prosperously commencing, and promised to bring 
wealth and comfort to the abodes of many of the inhabitants, have 
taken their flight to other regions, and the people again possess 
all the characteristics of a rural race, though in many cases suffer- 
ing from the dire effects of extreme poverty. To this fact may, 
peT-haps, in some measure be traced the difference which is ob- 
served in the attendance at the fair of Kirkpatrick now, when 
compared with what it once was.

PRESBYTERY OF DUMFRIES, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. J. WILSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural Hlstory. 

Name. — Irongray, the name by which this parish is now ge- 
nerally known, seems to have been added to Kirkpatrick by way 
of distinction, and signifies, as has been supposed. Gray's land ; 
the spot where the old church stood, which was dedicated to St 
Patrick, being probably so called. It lies on the right bank of 
the Cluden or Cairn, a few miles to the west of Dumfries, and, 
in form, is nearly triangular. 

Extent, Sfc. — It extends 9 miles in length, by from 1 to 4 in 
breadth, and contains a surface of 14,464 imperial acres, or 22.60 
square miles. It is bounded on the east by Terregles ; on the 
north, by the Cluden, which separates it from Holywood ; on the 
west and south-west, by Kirkpatrick- Durham and Urr; and on 
the south, by Lochrutton and Terregles. 

Topographical Appearances. — The appearance of the parish i&amp; 
varied and singularly beautiful. The lowest or eastern extremity 
is nearly level, and in a state of the highest cultivation. The 
centre consists of two or more undulations of hills, being part of 
a range which stretches across the stewartry from north to south. 
Their knolls and heights are finely wooded; their sloping accli- 
vities well and somewhat tastefully enclosed, here in pasture, and 
there in crop; and their outline, as seen from different parts of 

' Communicated by the late Incu.iibeiit of the parish, the Rev. Robert Crawford.

the vale, highly picturesque. From several points, particularly 
along the upper parts of the farm of luglestone, on the estate of 
Mr Oswald of Auchencruive, there are delightful views of the 
richest portion of Nithsdale, part of Annandale, the Solway, and 
the hills of Cumberland. The highest or western extremity con- 
sists of two bare elevated ridges, which rise to the height of about 
1500 feet above the level of the sea. The one to the north, 
called " Bishop's Forest," is separated from the other, « Glen- 
bennan," by the Auld water, a rivulet that falls into the Cairn, 
and gives the name of Cluden to that beautiful stream. With 
their gray rocks and dark-brown heath, they form, a splendid 
back-ground to the lesser eminences, and 'the fertile well-culti- 
vated plains beneath. 

Meteorology. — The climate varies in different parts of the pa- 
rish. In the upper district, the atmosphere is colder and more 
damp than in the lower, owing perhaps to the badness of the soil 
and the want of shelter from the westerly winds, which are here 
the most prevalent. 

Hydrography. —The only stream which, strictly speaking, be- 
longs to the parish, is the Auld water, which rises on the borders 
of Kirkpatrick- Durham, sweeps round the base of the Bishop's 
Forest, and falls into the Cairn about three miles above the junc- 
ture of that stream with the Nith. The course being short, and 
the channel narrow and rocky, it is easily swollen, and then comes 
down with great rapidity, doing often considerable Injury to the 
crops upon its banks. That, however, which gives any thing like 
interest to the stream, is a beautiful little waterfall, which marks 
its course, just where it crosses the road leading from Dumfries to 
Dunscore and Minnyhive, and very near its junction with the 
Cairn. The fall may be about 20 feet, and is succeeded by one 
considerably less, which deposits the waters in a deep smooth 
basin. Across the lower fall, and in front of the higher, nearly 
on a level with what may be called its rapids, a bridge, consisting 
of a single arch, is thrown. The whole scene, as seen from the 
bridge, — the ivy mantling its sides, the fine old oaks overhanging 
the stream, the noisy and agitated waters on the one side, their 
quiet and gentle current on the other, heightened as these are by 
coming unexpectedly upon them,— have a very pleasing effect, 
and arrest the attention of the passing traveller. The Routing 
Bridge, as the spot is called, is on the north-western extremity 
of the property of Mr Oswald of Auchencruive.

The Cairn skirts this parish on the north, for upwards of six 
miles, forming, as already stated, the boundary between it and 
Holy wood in that direction, and adding greatly to th e beauty of 
the landscape by its wooded banks, its numerous wmdings, and 
" its waves that sweetly ghde." When joined by the Auld water, 
it takes the name of Cluden, and, after leaving Irongray, sweeps 
aloncr the northern border of Terregles for about a mile, and then 
fallslnto the Nith, where the silent and venerable towers of the 
Abbey of Lincluden stand. It is easily forded, except after heavy 
rains, when it overHows its banks, and lays many of the adjacent 
fields under water. It abounds with trout and par, and, in their 
season, with fry, grilse, &amp;c., and is considered an admirable fishing 
stream. 

Miner aloffy.-The rocks are whinstone, slate, freestone, and 
pudding-stone. Whinstone and slate of the greywacke spe- 
cies, compose the hills in the upper and middle district. The 
dip of the rock is from north to south, facing the south, with an 
angle of slight inclination. Freestone is to be found in various 
parts of the farms of Inglestone, Gateside, and Cluden, and forms 
the bed of the river a little below Cluden Mills. Above the 
mills, pudding-stone prevails, forming also the bed of the stream 
for upwards of a mile. 

Soils.— The soil where freestone is found is of a light sandy 
nature, well adapted to the growing of turnip and barley, which 
are cultivated to a considerable extent on the large and best ma- 
naged farms. That on the slaty part is of a gravelly description, 
also well adapted to the culture of turnip and barley. Tlie soil 
where whinstone prevails, is of a wet quahty, having a subsoil of 
hard impenetrable till, a mixture of clay, sand, and gravel. The 
alluvial soils are of small extent, being confined to the immediate 
vicinity of the river. Underneath them at various depths, from 
five to ten feet, as also in many boggy parts of the parish, trees 
of different kinds are found, principally the oak, alder, birch, and 
fir, {Pinus sijlvestris, facts which prove that the latter tree, 
though not now, once was a native of the south of Scotland, and 
that several ages must have passed away, since they were depo- 
sited there. Marl, which was formerly used in considerable 
quantities as manure, and forms perhaps part of the strata of the 
parish, is to be met with in some of the bogs. It is now disused, 
having been superseded by lime and bones, which are nearly as 
cheap, and far less exhausting to the land.

very hne specimens of both are to be found on the glebe. 
rjy,. II- — Civil History. 

Ihis parish occupies rather a distinguished place in the history 
ot the memorable struggle for religious freedom which the Pres- 
byterians or Covenanters maintained from 1662 to 1685. Here 
many of these oppressed and devoted men found a breathing-pkce 
and a sanctuary. On the southern side of the « Forest," there 
IS an extensive hollow, enclosed on the west by Cornlee,'and on 
the east by Skeoch Hill, with a natural opening from the south 
About midway up Skeoch Hill, on the inner side, where there 
is a platform of considerable extent, several of the ejected minis- 
ters met their scattered flocks, and dispensed the sacrament to 
them. This lonely and otherwise unattractive spot is invested 
with a deep interest, from being the scene, and still retaining the 
memorials, of these events,—" the Communion Stones." They 
consist of what may be called two tables, with a passage between 
them. Each table has two rows of seats in distinct preservation. 
At the head, there is a small cairn, which was obviously used as 
the table for the elements. A few yards to the south, a stone of 
an oval form is to be seen, with two separate circular cavities that 
admit the arm to the elbow, which held, according to tradition, 
the water for baptism. In front of the stones, towards the forest, 
the ground rises gradually, forming a kind of natural gallery, 
where the congregation could hear the sermons and addresses 
that were delivered, and witness the whole solemnity. The na- 
ture of the ground, and the precautions that were taken by plant- 
ing watchmen on the heights, rendered the spot peculiarly secure. 
Any attempt to surprise them, was almost sure to be defeated. 
When this struggle commenced, John Welsh, the great grandson 
of Knox, was minister of the parish. He was ejected with seven- 
teen of his brethren in 1662, and acted a conspicuous part in 
these troublous times. After his ejection, we find him in the city 
teaching from house to house ; on the mountains, preaching to 
« the suffering wanderers" after sleepless nights ; in the camp, 
healing divisions, and taming the impetuosity of the more fiery 
leaders; on the field of battle, lamenting the dire necessity that 
forced him to arms, yet periling his life in the cause.- Strange 
to say, he escaped a violent death, having died in London on the 
9th of January 1681. 

In connection with this period we may state, that two martyrs, 



KIllKPATRICK-IRONGRAY. 



269 



Edward Gordon and Alexander M'Cubbin, lie buried on a small 
risino- ground, within a clump of trees, close to the Cluden, and 
in view of the kirk. They were seized in Lochmket moor, by 
Bruce and the Laird of Lagg, and executed on the spot where 
they were buried, to strike terror, perhaps, into the hearts of some 
families in the neighbourhood, either known or suspected to be 
attached to the Presbyterian cause. 

In later times, this parish gave birth to an individual in humble 
life, whose name would probably ere now have been forgotten, 
had not her singular and affecting story attracted the attention of 
the Author of Waverley, and given rise to one of the most en- 
chanting and instructive of his tales — " The Heart of Mid- 
lothian." The individual to whom we allude is Helen Walker, the 
prototype of " Jeanie Deans." How he came to hear of her story, 
the simple materials on which this splendid creation of his ge- 
nius was reared,— and what led to the erection of a stone to her 
memory, are all given in the preface to the tale. 

Land-owners.— Ja.mes Oswald of Newark, M. P. for Glasgow, 
is patron of the parish. His estate lies along the right bank 
of the Cluden, and embraces part of the middle and almost the 
whole of the lower district of the parish. There is no mansion- 
house on the property. Mr Oswald's usual residence is Auchen- 
cruive, a magnificent seat in the parish of St Quivox, and neigh-

bourhood of Ayr. Mr Lennox, of Linncluden, in this parish, re- 
sides in New York. Wellwood Maxwell, Esq. of Barncleugh, is 
also a proprietor in this parish. Wellwood Maxwell, Esq. of the 
Grove, an extensive merchant in Liverpool, has an estate on the 
South-eastern extremity of the parish, which is principally under 
his own management. He has lately built an elegant and com- 
modious mansion, after a design by Rickman, a self-taught archi- 
tect of very considerable celebrity. The entrance faces the south, 
and is surmounted by a square tower. The front is towards the 
east, and commands from the upper part a view of Dumfries and 
the surrounding country. The other chief land-owners are Fran- 
cis Maxwell, Esq. of Drumpark, and Alexander Hamilton Welsh 
of Skan, the representative of a very old familv. 

Parochial Registers.— The parochial registers are pretty volu- 
minous. The date of the earliest entry is 169 L From 1694 to 
1756, a period of sixty-two years, during which Mr James Guthrie 
was minister of the parish, they were very accurately kept.

The average rent of arable land per acre is 18s. The average

ter keep, L.7 ; per sheep, on hill pasture, 4s. ; do. on cow pas- 
ture, and turnips part of the year, IDs. 

Live-Stock. — The cattle are chiefly of the Galloway breed, which 
are considered to be best suited to the soil and climate, and are ge- 
nerally sold at from two to three years old, and sent south to be 
fattened for the English markets. Many of the farmers, however, 
are beginning to adopt a different system, viz. to fatten their cattle 
at home, and then send them south by steam to the market. This 
system, if fully acted upon, will put an end to droving, which has 
proved of late years so ruinous to all concerned. The sheep on the 
hill lands are black-faced, rather small in the bone, and partake 
much of the general character of the Galloway breed. Horses are 
reared here in considerable numbers. The best are of the Clydes- 
dale kind; and, as a good deal of attention has been paid of late 



KIRKPATRICK-IRONGRAY.

to this sort of stock, the breed is rapidly improving. Pigs are 
a staple commodity in this quarter. They are generally killed 
when a year old, and sent for sale to the Dumfries market, where 
there is a very extensive trade in pork during winter and spring. 

The average quantity of grain per acre may be, oats, 36 bushels ; 
barley, 35 do.; wheat, 26 do.; potatoes, 10 tons; turnips, from 
15 to" 25 do., according as they are manured. Mangel wurzel 
and beet root are not cultivated, the soil being too hght for them. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Toion, c§-c.— There is no market-town in the parish ; 
the nearest is Dumfries, which is within three miles of the lower 
end. The roads are good. The only stone bridges are those 
across the Auld water, consisting of single arches and in good re- 
pair. The fences are in tolerable condition. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is situated on the northern 
side of the parish, close to the Cluden, within two miles of the 
lower or eastern extremity, and consequently is distant from the 
upper or western about. seven miles; a distance which is very 
inconvenient, and cannot, it is to be feared, be easily remedied. 
It is in the form of a parallelogram, with the pulpit in the west 
end, and a small vestry behind. It was built in 1803, is in good 
repair, and affords accommodation for nearly 400. The middle 
area is free, and contains about 50 sittings. 

The most interesting benefaction on record, is that by Jean 
Biggar of Barbuie, in 1750, of 500 merks Scots for behoof of the 
poor, which was laid out in purchasing from Mr James Guthrie, 
then minister of the parish, a small property adjoining the glebe, 
called the Kirk-holm,- which yields an annual rent of L, 8, 5s. 
The manse was built in 1801, and is a substantial and commodi- 
ous house. The glebe consists of nine acres, the yearly value of 
which may be estimated at L. 25. The stipend is sixteen chal- 
ders, half meal, half barley, with L.8, 6s. 8d. for communion ele- 
ments. 

Divine service is in general well attended, and the Sabbath well 
kept. There is an annual collection for one of the four religi- 
ous institutions, sanctioned by the General Assembly, which varies 
in amount, and bears a fair proportion to the circumstances of the 
people, who are almost exclusively farmers and cottars. 

Education. — Total number of schools, 2, both parochial. The 
schoolmasters have the maximum salary divided between them, or 
L.25, 13s. 7d. each, are provided with dwelling-houses, and re- 



272 



KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE. 



ceive in school fees, together, about L.30. There are none be- 
tween six and fifteen years of age, or upwards, who can neither 
read nor write. 

Literature. — A parish library was instituted about two years 
ago, is managed by a committee annually chosen, the minister 
being ex-ofBcio president, and contains upwards of 200 volumes, 
— novels, romances and plays being excluded, and every precau- 
tion taken to ensure a proper selection of books. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — There are eighteen persons re- 
ceiving parochial aid. The average yearly allowance to each per- 
son, is L. 5, 10s.— in all, L.99. The funds are produced as fol- 
lows: collections, L.15; proclamations, L.l, Is.; interest of 
money, L.15, 4s. ; poor's holm, L.7, 15s.; and voluntary assess- 
ment of the heritors, L.60 ; total, L 99. 

The only alehouse in the parish is a very small one in the vil- 
lage of Shawhead. 

Fuel — The parish furnishes no fuel except peats, which may 
cost, independently of carriage, about 2s. 6d. per cart-load. Of 
course, they are cheaper when the purchaser can spare hands to 
cast them at the proper season. Search was lately made for coal 
on the farm of Midtown ; but, as might have been expected from 
the mineral structure of the ground, without success. After bor- 
ing a considerable depth, they came upon what they considered a 
stratum of this mineral. It proved, however, to be a hard slaty 
substance, of a dark gray colour, something like manganese, which 
emitted, when ignited, a strong sulphureous smell. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since the last Account was written, various and important 
changes have taken place. A considerable proportion of the waste 
land has been reclaimed ; small farms have merged into larger 
ones ; old, half-ruinous, and supernumerary cothouses, which 
often prove haunts for vagrants, and nurseries of vice, are being 
removed. Farm-buildings, enclosures, roads, and bridges are in a 
very superior state to what they then were. The character and 
condition, too, of the people have been greatly ameliorated.

PRESBYTERY OF KIRKCUDBRIGHT, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY. 

THE REV. DAVID WELSH, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Situation, and Extent. — The name of this parish, which 
is frequently written Carsefern, is probably derived from earse and 
Jem, — as the plain on which the church is situate, was, at the time 
of the first erection of the church, no doubt covered with fern. 
The parish is situate on the sloping side of that mountainous ridge 
which separates Kirkcudbright from Ayr, and has a southern ex- 
posure. On the north, it is bounded by the parishes of Dalmel- 
lington and New Cumnock ; on the east, by the parish of St 
John's, Dairy ; on the south, by Kells ; and on the west and south- 
west, by the parishes of Straiten and Minnigaff. 

The figure of the parish is nearly circular. It extends from 
north-west to south-east about ten miles, and from north-east to 
south-west about nine miles, and contains about 88 square miles. 

The church is situate nearly in the centre of the parish, and 
the hills and mountains rise around forming a kind of amphithea- 
tre. The parish, with very trifling exceptions, may be said to be 
altogether mountainous or hilly. 

Surface and General Appearance. — The higher mountains are 
verdant to their summits ; but the lower hills are generally cover- 
ed with heath, and are interspersed with bogs of peat of consider- 
able extent. The lower hills have growing among the heath or 
on the boggy ground, a sharp kind of grass, which in the early 
part of the season looks green ; but as the season advances, and 
in autumn, it assumes a very brown appearance, and in the winter, 
it is carried like chaff by the wind. 

Rivers and Lakes. — This parish is thickly indented with moun- 
tain streams. The largest stream, while it continues in the parish, is 
the Deugh. It loses its name, however, on joining the Keq, 

KIUKCUDBUIGHT. S 



274 



KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE. 



which last stream is the separating boundary between Carsphairn 
and Dah-y for about ten miles. This last, after leaving Cars- 
phairn, passes through a beautiful and richly wooded country, 
forms that splendid sheet of water Loch Ken, and afterwards gives 
up its name to the Dee. The only loch in the parish is that of 
Loch Doon, which forms a considerable part of its western boun- 
dary. 

Mountains. — The highest mountain in the parish is Cairnsmuir, 
which rises to an elevation of about 2696 feet above the level of 
the sea. It was chosen by Captain Colby as one of his stations 
for the trigonometrical survey in this part of Scotland, about 1814. 
From the summit of this mountain, when the atmosphere is clear, 
a most extensive view is obtained in every direction, except where 
it is intercepted by a mountain called Carline's Cairn, on the 
south-west side of the parish, which is nearly of an equal height. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The carse or plain on which the 
-church of Carsphairn is situate, has been entirely formed by water. 
The churchyard may be said to be a sand-bank formed by the water. 
From the rapidity and force with which the Deugh rushes from the 
mountains, it is not wonderful that it should have frequently 
changed its course, and traversed, as it evidently has done, the 
whole of the plain. But, though this small portion of the parish 
be continually undergoing changes, the greater part is of a very 
unchangeable nature, and, from the number and elevation of its 
mountains, may be supposed to afford much scope for the investi- 
gations of the mineralogist. 

As there are no indications of either lime or coal through- 
out the whole of the parish, and as there are plenty of stones 
upon the surface for the purpose of fences or of houses, there 
has not, till lately, been any attempt made to penetrate into 
the bowels of the earth. 

Much, indeed, is reported of the rich freight, with which some 
of the small streams in the neighbourhood of Cairnsmoor were 
loaded in former times, — when a Mr Dodds, celebrated for his 
chemical skill, collected the golden grains, converting them into 
some foreign coin; but, after his lucrative retirement was dis- 
turbed by some of the officers of the Crown sent to apprehend 
him, he threw his dies for coining, into what is commonly called 
by the inhabitants the green well of Scotland, or well of Lagwine. 

A discovery has been made on the .estate of the Honourable 
Colonel M. Cathcart, of a vein of lead, which promises to be 



CARSPHAIRN. 



275 



productive. The proprietor has now a number of miners em- 
ployed, and there are more labourers employed than ever were in 
this parish, at any former period. In a season when provisions 
are high, it is satisfactory to see labour provided for the industrious 
poor ; and it is earnestly to be wished, that the hopes of the pro- 
prietor may be realized in their fullest extent. Iron has likewise 
been discovered on the same estate, and in the same neighbour- 
hood. They are both found in that range of hills which forms the 
western or south-western boundary of the parish. 

The rock which seems most generally diffused throughout the 
parish, is greywacke. Granite abounds, however, on the south- 
west part of the parish, near to and at Loch Doon, both in large 
masses and detached rocks. The Castle of Loch Doon, an an- 
cient ruin, is situate on an island of granite in the loch, at nearly an 
equal distance from the parishes of Straiton and Carsphairn. 

On the summits of the highest mountains, there is but little ve- 
getation. In some places, small stones cover a considerable 
portion of the surface ; in others, a long white moss, which yields 
to a considerable depth under the pressure of the foot. Where 
there is any vegetation, it is very stunted, and not calculated to 
afford nourishment to the flocks. 

Zoology. — The eagle is frequently seen soaring between Cairns- 
muir and Carline's Cairn; but his place of greatest security is 
about the rocky mountains of Star, in the parish of Straiton. It is 
commonly said, that the last place in the south of Scotland which the 
ptarmigan frequented, was Cairnsmuir.l They have, for some time, 
however, been completely destroyed or banished. Other species 
of grouse are plentiful. Black game abound in every part of the 
parish ; and the common grouse are very numerous. The migra- 
tory birds which visit us, are those which are common to high and 
muirland districts. The curlew, the green plover or pea-wit, are 
very common during the breeding season, but retire towards the 
shore as the season advances. Wild duck are numerous at all 
seasons. Owing to an almost entire want of woods or plantations, 
song birds are rare. The lark, however, abounds, and gives ani- 
mation to the most remote and retired parts of the parish. 

In the two principal streams in the parish, the Deugh and the 
Ken, the progress of the salmon is interrupted by falls, which they 
cannot surmount, and which shut them out from much good 
spawning ground. Towards the junction of these two, there is 
some good salmon fishing. All the streams abound with trout. 



276 



KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE. 



not of a large size, but such as afford good sport to the anglej- 
who delights in numbers. There are few places in the south, 
where the sportsman can find better amusement. 

Botany. — It is not easy to conceive a parish of equal extent 
more entirely destitute of wood than Carsphairn. There are few 
old trees, and the plantations, with the exception of those on the 
farm of Dundeuofh, are neither numerous nor extensive. Some- 
thing has, however, been done, of late, to remedy this defect, by 
some of the residing heritors ; and small clumps are rising upon 
several farms, which, besides being useful, will in some degree 
break the monotony of the scene. Carsphairn is, however, en- 
tirely a pastoral parish. The sheep are what the farmers depend 
upon for necessaries, for comfort, and for riches. To their flocks, 
therefore, their attention is chiefly, if not solely, directed ; and 
they would not be very willing to see much of the land taken up 
with plantations, to the exclusion of the flocks, even though their 
landlords should be at the expense of enclosing and planting. 
Some, however, are beginning to see that the shelter which plan- 
tations afford during a storm, may be a full equivalent for the want 
of herbage, and that some benefit may arise from the thinnings 
of such plantations. There are some plants on the higher moun- 
tains, which are considered not very common. 

II. — Civil History. 

The parish of Carsphairn is said to have been separated from 
the parishes of Kells and Dairy, and constituted a parish, about 
the year 1627. Both these parishes receive stipend from Cars- 
phairn, about L.9 Sterling each, — Kells levying on that part of 
the parish which lies on the west side of the Deugh, — and Dairy 
on the east. The first minister is said to have been a Mr Sem- 
ple, who is reported to have been very zealous in the discharge of 
his ministerial duties. 

Eminent Men. — Carsphairn was the birth-place of the late Dr 
Jackson, Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University of 
St Andrews, — a man with whose mathematical works the learned 
are acquainted, and who was not more distinguished as a scholar, 
than loved and admired as a man by all who knew him. 

Sir Loudon M'Adam, celebrated for his improvements on turn- 
pike roads, was likewise a native of this parish. He was said 
to have narrowly in infancy escaped, when the family mansion of 
Lagwine was consumed by fire. The body of Sir Loudon is in- 



CARSPHAIRN. 



277 



terred at Moffat, but the family tomb is in tlie churchyard of Cars- 
phairn. 

Mr M' Adam, late of .Castle Dykes, Dumfries, was a native of 
Carsphairn. Born in low circumstances, and but little favoured 
with the blessings of an early education, he, nevertheless, by his na- 
tural talents and application to business, realized a princely for- 
tune, which he bequeathed among many relatives, in a manner 
which did honour both to his head and heart. To the place of 
his nativity, he left L.500 for the benefit of the poor, and L.500, 
the interest of which was to increase the schoolmaster's salary ; 
— both sums under the management of the minister and session. 

Land-oicners. — The heritors connected with this parish are 
eleven in number, of whom the principal are, the Honourable 
Colonel M. Cathcart of Craigengillan ; Robert M'Millan, Esq. 
of Holm ; Colonel Clarke of Knockgray, &amp;c. 

Antiquities. — There are scarcely any traces of antiquities in this 
parish, except some very large cairns. It is said, that, in remov- 
ing some of these, stones in the form of coffins have been found, 
containing human bones. One of the largest is not far from the 
church, near the road leading to Dalmelhngton, on the farm of 
Holm of Dultallochan. Oii the same farm, and at no great dis- 
tance, are found large stones forming a circle. 

Near the Holm of Dalquhairn, on the estate of Mr M'Millan 
of Holm, there are a number of knolls, remarkable for their si- 
tuation and the regularity of their forms. They are situate in the 
bottom of a deep valley, high mountains rising on two sides. They 
have the appearance of having been artificially formed ; but closer 
observation will perhaps shew that they have been formed by de- 
bris from the surrounding hills. The name which they have always 
borne, is the AUwhannie Nowes. 

ni. — Population. 

By census taken in 1755 the population was 609 
1801, - 496 

1811, - 439 

1821, - 474 

1831, - 542 

1841, - 790 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — Surface draining has been carried on for several 
years to a considerable extent, and has in many cases considerably 
improved the sheep-walks, but the general appearance of the coun- 
try is but little changed. It would be unjust, however, to say that 



278 



KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE. 



no improvement has been made in agriculture. Several farmers 
have laid a considerable quantity of lime upon those parts of their 
farms most suitable for ploughing, and have, in return, frequently 
had excellent crops. In April 1838, the ploughing match of the 
Glenkens Agricultural Society, took place on the farm of Holm, 
lying near the base of Cairnsmoor, — when about thirty iron ploughs 
of the most improved construction started, affording an exhibition 
such as Carsphairn never before witnessed on any of its fields. 
Silver medals were given, — one by the Highland Society, an- 
other by the Glenkens Society. 

There is much land which might be made to produce good 
crops. The farmers have generally succeeded their fathers, and 
have been accustomed to follow the same mode of management. 
Their being continued in their farms by landlords, inferior to none 
in the country for intelligence, is a proof that the latter could 
not be much benefited by any change in the mode of farming. 
Much attention has been given to surface draining, and some at- 
tempts have been made to reclaim bog lands, not v/ithout success. 

Neither attention nor expense has been spared in improving the 
breed of black-faced sheep. Attempts to introduce the white- 
faced breed, and some have been made, have not hitherto suc- 
ceeded. 

The flocks may be considered to have been improved in qua- 
lity rather than increased in number, since the time when Mr 
Smith wrote the former account of the parish. He states the 
number of sheep to be at that time about 30,000, which may be 
nearly the average number at present. 

The number of black-cattle is constantly changing. There are 
always a large number of Highland cattle kept during winter, 
which are generally forwarded to the English markets during the 
following summer. 

Stone dikes are the only fences in the parish, and in no 
part of the country is the building of such fences better under- 
stood than in this neighbourhood. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

There is one small village, near by the church. Two small 
inns afford better accommodation than their external appearance 
would indicate. There is in the village one other licensed dealer 
in spirits, — and license has been given to a toll-keeper about 
two miles distant from the village. 

P5-0ce.— A post-office connecting this parish with Ayr was 



CARSPHAIRN. 



279 



established in the village, in August 1838. A two-horse coach 
from Dumfries to Ayr and from Ayr to Dumfries, on alternate 
days, passes through the village during the summer season. 1 he 
roads throughout the parish are kept in tolerable repair, princi- 
pally at the expense of the parish. The nearest market-towns 
are Ayr and Castle-Douglas, each about twenty-six miles distant. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church is situate nearly in the cen- 
tre of the parish, and in the most convenient place for by far 
the greater portion of the inhabitants. There are many fami- 
lies about five miles distant, however,— some seven, and some 
even ten miles. The church is a very neat building, comfort- 
able, and amply sufficient to contain the present population, be- 
ing able to accommodate about 400 people. It was built about 
1815, and was repaired at considerable expense in 1837. The 
manse consists of an old house, with a recent addition of two rooms. 
The rooms are but small, and the ceilings low ; but, altogether, the 
manse is comfortable, and in tolerable repair. The glebe con- 
sists of about 13 acres, which may be valued at about L.2 per acre. 
The stipend is 15 chalders, half barley, half oatmeal, with L. 8, 
6s. 8d. for communion elements. 

There are three families in the parish connected with the Re- 
formed Presbytery, and one or two individuals who do not attend 
church, of whom it would be difficult to say to what sect they be- 
long. Considering the distance at which many of the inhabitants 
are from the church, and the utter impossibility of either the 
young or very old of such families coming out during winter, the 
church may be said to be well attended. 

Education. — There is only one endowed school in the parish. 
The schoolmaster has the maximum salary, and the legal al- 
lowance for house and garden. He likewise receives the interest 
of L.500, left by Mr M'Adam, late of Castle Dykes. Families 
at a distance from the parochial school sometimes unite to- 
gether, to employ a young man, during winter, to teach their 
children. This is an expense which some of the poor people 
cannot well afford ; but they manage in such a manner, that there 
are none in the parish who have attained to ten years of age without 
being able to read. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of poor on the ses- 
sion roll is 13; and there are some others who occasionally re- 
ceive assistance. The highest allowance is about L.IO, and the 
lowest about L.l, 10s. The funds from which the poor are sup- 



280 



KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE. 



plied are, 1st, the interest of about L.800 - L.20; 2d, annUal 
collection in church, about L.18; 3d, annual donation from the 
Honourable Colonel Macadam Cathcart, L.15. The L. 800 is 
the amount of legacies left at different times, including the L.500 
left by Mr M'Adam. 

Fuel. — There are no coals in the parish ; but they are obtained 
from coal-pits at Dalmellington, about eleven miles distant. Peats 
are more or less used by all the families in the parish.

Miscellaneous Observations. 

There can be no doubt that cultivation might be considerably 
extended, and if the mining operations succeed, as they now pro- 
mise to do, it is probable that a great change, and much improve- 
ment will be made upon the parish in a short time. Nothing has 
yet been done in the way of purifying the lead. The ore which 
has been extracted, lies in the state in which it was dug out; but 
preparations are beginning to be made for washing and purifying 
it, and it is presumed that no expense will be spared in carrying 
on the operations on the most approved plans. There is abun- 
dance of coal and lime upon the estates of the proprietor on the 
Ayrshire side, and it is hoped that an exchange favourable to Cars- 
pliairn may be made. 

Since the preceding pages were written in 1839, Carsphairn has 
undergone a wonderful change, chiefly on account of the mining 
operations carried on within the parish. Since the operations 
commenced, the population has been nearly doubled. In that part 
of the parish in which lead was discovered, and in the bosom of a 
remote mountain, where the silence of nature was seldom broken, 
unless by the barking of the shepherd's dog, or the call of the 
shepherd, there is now a scene of industry and activity, which re- 
quires to be witnessed in order to be understood ; and which can- 
not be contemplated without astonishment. 

The proprietor of the mine, the Honourable Colonel M'Adam 
Cathcart, has spared no expense in obtaining all the necessary ap- 
paratus for crushing, washing, and smelting, on the most approved 
principles. The wheel used for moving the crushing apparatus is 
about 30 feet in diameter, driven by water obtained from the 
neighbouring mountains. The smelting furnaces are constructed 
on the most approved plan ; and large houses have been built, and 



CAR8PHAIRN. 



281 



preparations are making in them for separating the silver from the 
lead. The proprietor has been acting hitherto as if it were his 
object to exhibit the whole operations in the most perfect manner, 
rather than to enrich himself. It is to be hoped, however, that 
the liberal manner in which hitherto he has conducted the whole 
business, may meet with an ample reward. The Honourable Co- 
lonel M. Cathcart retains the mine entirely in his own hands. He 
has appointed skilful and steady men as overseers ; and he takes 
pleasure in personally superintending the whole. 

Everything is done by the proprietor to promote the comfort of 
the workmen. A large village has already been built upon the 
side of the hill, additions to which are still making ; and from the 
situation which it occupies, and the cleanliness of its appearance, 
it presents a picturesque object to the traveller in passing among 
the wild mountains. The proprietor has likewise evidenced his 
liberality in his attention to the mental cultivation and moral im- 
provement of the workmen. 

Though there are workmen from different quarters, yet the 
greater part are from Leadhills and Wanlockhead, — men who had 
enjoyed the privilege of excellent libraries, and who regretted their 
separation from these means of entertainment and improvement. 
So soon as the Colonel and the Honourable Mrs Macadam Cath- 
cart were made acquainted with their desire of forming a library, 
they sent a number of books, which laid an excellent foundation 
for a library, and which, by various means, is rapidly increasing. 
In addition to this, they have built an excellent school and school- 
master's house ; the school-house is more ample and commodious 
than any in the district, and they give a liberal salary both to the 
schoolmaster and female teacher. 

The mining operations have changed Carsphairn from being one 
of the most rural and pastoral parishes in this country, into one of 
comparative bustle and activity. More money now circulates in 
one week than was circulated, a few years ago,' in the course of the 
year. There are now two coaches passing daily, one from Ayr to 
Dumfries, and another from Dumfries to Ayr. There is like- 
wise a coach from Carsphairn to Kirkcudbright on alternate days.

PRESBYTERY OF KIRKCUDBRIGHT, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY. 

THE REV. W. G. CROSBIE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name Extent -c, — The name " Parton," which this parish is 
said to have received before the end of the thirteenth century, is 
supposed to signify, in the Gaelic language, " the hill top," which 
is perfectly descriptive of the situation. Its greatest length from 
north to south is about 5 miles ; its greatest breadth from east to 
west, about 7 ; and its whole area is about 28 square miles. It 
is bounded on the north by Balmaclellan ; on the east by Kirk- 
patrick-Durham, from which it is separated by the small river Urr ; 
on the south by Crossmichael ; on the south-west by Balmaghie, 
from which it is separated by the Dee ; on the north-west by 
Kells, from which it is separated by the Ken, a river that is in 
some places about half a mile broad. The general character of 
the parish, in point of surface, is very uneven, though there is no 
hill of considerable height, with the exception of Mochrum Fell, 
towards the northern part of the parish. There is a hill farther 
west, called " Cruckie Height," which affords an extensive and 
interesting view of the vale of Ken and Dee. The rich and va- 
ried scenery commanded from this point has been done great 
justice to, in a descriptive poem by the late Mr Gillespie of 
Kells. 

Hydrography. — On the farm of North Dullarg, a chalybeate 
spring was discovered many years ago, and considerable attention 
was then directed to it ; but, the property soon falling into other 
hands, it was neglected, and no effort has since been made to res- 
cue it from oblivion. It is supposed to possess, in some degree, 
the qualities of the old well at Moffat. The Dee joins the Ken 
about half a mile above the church, and, though much smaller, it 
gives the name to the united river, which it retains till it enters 
the Solway Frith at Kirkcudbright. There is a variety of lochs 
in the parish, the principal being Corsock, Lurky Patiesthorn, and 



PARTON. " 

Falbey. They extend to a considerable depth, and are well stored 
with trout. 

Botani/.— There is an oak of remarkable size on the farm of 
 Boreland. Its circumference round its trunk is 8 feet, and round 
the top of its branches is 300 feet. There is in Parton Wood, 
along the high road, a number of weeping birches, which are not 
surpassed by any thing of the kind in this part of the country. 

11. — Civil History. 

Parochial Registers. — A register of births and baptisms, com- 
mencing in the year 1714, has been kept in this parish, but not 
with much regularity, until the year 1744, when a complete re- 
gister of marriages, births, and deaths commences, and extends 
to the year 1783; and from that to the present time, a register 
of births and baptisms only appears to have been regularly kept. 

Land-oioners. — These, with the valuations of their respective 
properties, are, —

The total valuation of the parish amounts to L.2545 Scots- 
Antiquities. — Near the church there is an artificial mount 120 
yards in circumference at its base, and surrounded with a ditch 
from six to nine feet deep. About half a mile north there is ano- 
ther nearly twice the circumference of the former, and enclosed 
with two ditches. At a short distance from this, are the remains 
of a small Druidical circle. There are also two cairns in the pa- 
rish. 

On the estate of Corsock, in the eastern part of the parish, are 
the remains of an old castle, the residence of Robert Nelson of 
Corsock, who is made honourable mention of in the " Scots Wor- 
thies," as one who suffered severely in the cause of the covenant. 
It is now in a very dilapidated state, little indeed remaining but 
an old tower. 

The old church, which was superseded by the erection of a new 
one in 1834, was built in 1592. It was 72 feet long, by 14 wide. 
The half of it still remains, and the interior of it has been con- 
verted into a burial-place by two of the heritors of the parish. 

On the farm of Arvie, there is a flat stone about three feet in 
diameter, on which are the marks of what might be supposed a 
cow's foot, a horse shoe, the four nails on each side being very

distinct, and the impression which might be made by a man's foot 
and knee while he was in the act of kneeling, the knot of the gar- 
ter being quite evident. The tradition connected with this re- 
markable stone, commonly called the " Cow Clout," is, that the ' 
proprietor, in order to get up arrears of rent, " drave the pun," or, 
in other words, carried off the hypothecated stock, while a fierce re- 
sistance was made by the people, and that over this stone, on which 
a man had just been praying for relief against his enemies, the 
cattle passed followed by an officer on horseback, and that it re- 
mains as a memorial to posterity of the cruel deed. 

Across the river Dee, just below its junction with the Ken, there 
is a causey, which is evidently a work of art. 
. Land- owners. — There are twelve land-owners in all, five of whom 
are resident. The total valuation of the parish amounts to L.2545. 
The patroness of the parish is Miss Glendonwyn of Parton. Her 
ancestor, Sir Simon Glendonwyn, in 1438, obtained a confirma- 
tion of the barony, baronial rights, and patronage of Parton.

The great increase of the population from 181 J to 1821, ap- 
pears chiefly to have arisen from the subdivision of the farms and 
the increased cultivation of the lands on the estate of Corsock. 
The people are almost all engaged in agriculture, and are in ge- 
neral of sober and industrious habits. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture, — About 9290 acres, including meadow and inter- 
spersed with waste land, are under cultivation. 5800 acres con- 
sist principally of heath and morasses. Perhaps from 500 to 600 
acres are capable of cultivation, the greater part of which lies in 
the interior of the parish, and the great obstacle to the improve- 
ment of which is the want of roads. 

The average rent of land per acre does not exceed 7s. 

The real rental of-the parish in the year 1821 was L.6000, but 
it is now reduced, perhaps, to little more than L.5000. 

Quarry. — There is a slate-quarry in the neighbourhood of the 
church, which has been in operation upwards of thirty years, and 
has given employment to eight or ten workmen. The slates are 
of good quality, and extensively used. The rent of the quarry at 



PARTON. 



285 



one time exceeded L.lOO; but it has been reduced, on account of 
the reduction of the duty on the English slates. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Toivn.—CsLSile-'Dottgids is the nearest market-town, 
and is six or seven miles distant. It affords an excellent market, 
both for grain and cattle. The high road from Castle-Douglas 
to New Galloway passes through the western part of the parish ; 
and the high road from Dumfries to New Galloway passes through 
the eastern part. There is a daily post along the western line. 
There is a coach on this road communicating with one from Dum- 
fries to Ayr. 

Dalbeattie and Palnackie are the nearest ports, and are at a 
distance of about twelve miles. Almost the whole of the lime, 
and a portion of the coals used in the parish, are brought from 
these ports. 

Puel. — The fuel principally used is peat, which the parish sup- 
plies in great abundance. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The stipend is eight chalders of barley 
and eight chalders of meal. 

The glebe is sixteen acres in extent, and valued at L.25 Ster- 
lino-. The manse was built in 1777, and has had two additions 
made to it since. It is now commodious and fn good repair. 

The church is situated, like most in the neighbourhood, on 
the banks of the Dee, and is therefore put at the extremity 
of the parish. A considerable effort was made by a portion 
of the heritors to have it removed to the interior, at the pe- 
riod of its being rebuilt in 1834, but, as heritors holding more 
than one-fourth of the valuation opposed it, the proposal was 
abandoned. A chapel on the banks of the Urr was subse- 
quently built, and a preacher has been supplying regular service, 
supported partly by seat rents, and partly by the liberality of 
Major Fletcher, Esq. of Corsock. There are localities connect- 
ed with it in Balmaclellan and Kirkpatrick-Durham, as well as in 
Parton, upwards of four miles from the parish churches ; so that, 
if a new parish quoad sacra is disjoined, it will embrace a part of 
all these parishes, and be of considerable extent. 

Education. — There are two parochial schools in the parish. 
One of the masters has L. 31, 6s. 8d., and the other L. 20 of sa- 
lary, both subject, however, to a deduction of L. 4, 3s. 4d. each 
as an annuity payable to a retired teacher. The fees actually 
paid to the schoolmasters do not exceed L. 25, and they have no 
other emoluments.

<p>
PRESBYTERY OF DUMFRIES, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. THOMAS INGLIS, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History, 
Name. — Lochrutton derives its name from a lake or loch in 
the centre of the parish. The word Rutton is supposed to sig- 
nify, in the Gaelic language, the straight road. The great road 
to Ireland through the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright formerly passed 
close by this loch. This road is now little frequented, a new 
and better line having been formed many years ago. The new 
road passes also through the parish, and at a short distance from 
the loch. 

Boundaries, Figure, and Extent. — The parish is of an elliptical 
form, and is computed to contain 13h square miles ; being 4 long, 
from east to west ; and 3 broad, from north to south. It is bound- 
ed by the parishes of New Abbey and Troquire, on the south 
and east; Terregles and Irongray, on the north; Urr and Kirk- 
gunzeon, on the west. Towards its boundaries on the south, east, 
and west, the land rises, forming a sort of undulating ring round 
the parish in these parts, but falling towards the north. These 
high grounds are mostly arable. The rest of the parish lies in 
a valley consisting of arable land, interspersed with knolls, mos- 
ses and meadows. 

Hydrography. — The lake or loch from which the parish has its 
name, extends to 123 acres, 2 roods, and 4 falls Scots statute 
measure. It is a mile in length, and at an average about a mile 
in breadth, and twelve feet in depth. In the middle of it, there 
is a small island about half a rood in extent, and of a circular form. 




LOCHRUTTON. 287 

This seems to have been, in part at least, artificial. Over its 
whole surface there is a collection of large stones which have 
been gathered from the neighbouring fields, resting on a frame of 
oak planks. The scenery of the lake is bleak, from want of wood 
in the surrounding lands and the more distant heights. From the 
lake there issues a small stream, which, after being joined by 
others, and having pursued its course for a mile or two, receives 
the name of Cargen water, and falls into the Nith below Drum- 
fries. 

There is a small chalybeate spring in the parish, called the 
Markland well. It is effectual in removing agues, stomach com- 
plaints and nervous disorders. ■ It is exceedingly light, very diu- 
retic, and an excellent restorer of appetite. During summer and 
in the beginning of autumn, it is resorted to by persons in the 
ordinary and humble walks of life. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The rock is mostly schist and whin- 
stone. It is frequently soft and clayey, particularly near the sur- 
face. It is used for building houses and dikes. The soil on it 
in general is shallow loam. It may be considered neither very 
barren nor very fertile. 

Zoology. — The fishes in the lake are eels, pike, and perches, 
Trouts have been caught in it, but rarely. The eels are caught in 
quantities, particularly in autumn, by a large wooded chest placed 
in the sluice at the foot of the lake, with openings at the bottom. 

The migratory birds in the parish are the woodcock, cuckoo, 
swallow, and sea-gull or mew. The sea-gulls frequent the island 
in the lake, in spring and summer, and cover it all over with their 
nests. They make their appearance in spring, and disappear in 
the beginning of autumn. 

II. — Civil Historv. 
Land-owners. — The heritors are thirteen in number; the chief 
of whom are Marmaduke Constable Maxwell of Terregles, and 
James Murray M'Culloch of Ardwall, neither of whom reside in 
the parish. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers date one hundred 
and thirty-six years back. They are not voluminous, but have 
been pretty regularly kept. 

Antiquities. — The vestige of a Druidical temple is to be seen 
upon a hill at the eastern extremity of the parish. This spot is 
called the Seven gray stones; though, in fact, there are nine

stones suiTounding a rising ground, and forming a circle of se- 
venty feet diameter. 

One ancient tower remains entire, and is mentioned in a Scots 
chronicle published in the reign of James VI., by the name of the 
Castle of Hills. The area before the entrance is enclosed, and 
over the gate a porter's lodge was erected. When this tower was 
built, is uncertain ; but on a corner stone of the lodge, which 
seems to be of more modern construction, the year 1598 is in- 
scribed. 

III. — Population. 



The population in 1728 was . . 480 

1755, according to Dr Webster, . 564 

1790, . . 528 

1801, . ., . 514 

1811, . . 562 

1821, . . 594 

1831, . . 650 

1841, . . .659 



The chief cause of the increase of the population has been 
the increase of feus or inhabited houses, chiefly in the village of 
Lochfoot, the only village in the parish. The population of the 
village amounts to 96. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The parish contains upwards of 6000 acres Scots 

statute measure. 

The number of acres, arable and meadow, is supposed to be 5165 

in mosses, . . 278 

in woods, . . 209 

not arable, . . 400 

6052 

Rent of Land. — The land rent of the parish is L. 4000 The 
average rent per acre of most of the farms is from 10s. to L.l. The 
highest rent of any farm in the parish is L. 230, and the lowest 
L.40. 

Leases, Sc. — There are few or none of the farms let for a 
shorter period than fifteen years, and none for a longer. They 
are all divided from one another by march-dikes, and many of 
them well subdivided, and also suitably accommodated with houses. 

There are two mills in the parish ; one for grinding oats and 
barley, and the other for dressing flax. They are both driven by 
the stream that runs from the lake. To the flax mill are attach- 
ed a small circular saw for sawing timber, and machinery for card- 
ing wool. Both are driven by the wheel of the mill. 

Oat seed, if the season answer, is begun to be sown on the se-

cond or third week of March, and potatoes to be planted about 
the middle of April, and barley to be sown towards the end of it 
or beginning of May, and turnips towards the middle of June. 

Raio Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce rais- 
ed in the parish may be as follows : 

Oats, 30,353 Winchester bushels, at 2s. per bushel, L.3035 6 0 

Barley, 956 do. do. at 3s. per do. 143 8 0 

Potatoes, 2380 bolls, 8 cwt. to the boll, at Is. per cwt. 952 0 0

Turnips, 27 acres, at L.3 per acre, . . 81 0 0 

Land in pasture, rating it at L.4 per cow, . 2148 0 0 

Sheep, 140, at L.l, 10s. per sheep, . . 210 0 0 

Total yearly value of raw produce, . L.8146 2 10 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market- Town. — Dumfries is the nearest market and post town. 
It lies about four miles eastward. There the farmers sell their 
grain, cattle, and horses. A great proportion of the cattle are 
bought to be sent to England. The parish not only supplies it&amp;elf 
with provisions, but a considerable quantity of oats and barley is 
disposed of in the Dumfries market, and generally bor.ght to be 
exported to England, chiefly Liverpool. The pork fed in the 
parish, which is considerable, is sold also in Dumfries, and sent 
to Newcastle chiefly. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church was built in 1819, and is in 
a very good state of repair. It aff"ords accommodation for upwards 
of .300 sitters. It is sufficient for the present population of the 
parish. There are no free sittings in it. It is distant only a little 
more than a mile from the eastern and northern extremities of 
the parish ; but more than three from the southern and wostern. 
The number of families belonging to the Established Church is 109. 
The average yearly amount of the collections for the last five years 
for charitable and religious purposes, L.2, 9s. 

There are 14 Cameronians, 17 Seceders, 9 Roman Catholics, 
and 3 Independents in the parish. 

The manse is partly old and partly new. The old part was 
built in 1777, the new in 1809. Both parts were repaired lately. 
The glebe is about ten acres in extent, very much broken with 
knolls, and may be worth L.IO yearly. The teind is exhausted, 
and the stipend, valued in money, amounts to L.l 82, 6s. 4d. 

Mr Thomas Inglis, the present incumbent, was admitted from 
the parish of Dunscore to Lochrutton in 1807. His predecessors 
in Lochrutton, as far as they can be traced, were, Alexander 
Train, member of the General Assembly at Glasgow in 1638 •

Mr Johnstone, who held the pastoral office in Lochriitton about 
1662; Mr John Gillespie, curate, who died in 1682 ; Mr John 
Willox, ejected at the Revolution ; Mr John Reid, the first Pres- 
byterian minister after the Revolution, who was ordained in 1691, 
and died in 1727, having held the ministerial office thirty-six years; 
and Mr George Duncan, who was ordained in 1728, and died 
in 1765, having held that office thirty-seven years. He was suc- 
ceeded by his son, Mr George Duncan, the late minister, who was 
ordained in 1766, and died in 1807. 

Education. — The parochial teacher has a salary of L. 30, with 
a dwelling-house of the legal dimensions, and the interest of L.62, 
14s. 2d. of mortified money. The school fees may amount to 
L. 15 per annum. Though the parochial school be not incon- 
veniently situated for the greater part of the population, there 
is generally a small school kept in the most distant corner of the 
parish for such children as cannot attend the parochial school, es- 
pecially in the winter season. A very small sum was mortified for 
this school by the Rev. Mr George Duncan, minister of this pa- 
rish, and the late minister's father. There are none in the parish 
who cannot read, and few who cannot write. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The annual amount of the funds for 
the relief of the poor may be about L.20, — out of which sum seven 
persons receive a regular allowance, at an average of more than L.2 
to each per annum. Six others receive aid occasionally from these 
funds. The proportion of the poor to the whole population is as 
1 to 50. None of the poor beg from door to door; but scarcely 
a day passes, that the parish is not visited by vagrant poor from 
neighbouring parishes, but chiefly from Ireland. The parochial 
poor are unwilling to apply for aid, and refrain from doing so until 
it becomes a matter of necessity. But it is thought that this dis- 
inclination is not increasing among them. 

Alehouses. — There are four in the parish. 

Fuel. — The fuel commonly used is peat. There are several 
mosses in the parish, from which the farmers are allowed the pri- 
vilege of cutting what fuel they need, but not to sell any. There 
is, however, one moss which is let to a tenant for fuel, who not only 
cuts a great many peats himself for sale, but also lets a part of 
it yearly to persons in the parish and neighbourhood for cutting 
them. They are sold at from 2s, 6d. to 3s. a cart load.

PRESBYTERY OF KIRKCUDBRIGHT, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY. 

THE REV. GEORGE MURRAY, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The word Girthon anciently written Girton is of 
Celtic origin, being an abbreviation of Girth-avon, the enclosure 
or sanctuary for the term Gir or Girth may bear either of these 
two significations on the. river. It is supposed that a village, 
with a sanctuary attached to it, existed in early times at the pas- 
sage of the Fleet. The correctness of this derivation is rendered 
the more probable from the circumstance, that the neighbouring 
parish of Anwoth, which is divided from Girthon by the Fleet, 
was originally Avonwaitlu the course or channel of the river. 
{Chalmers's Caledonia Vol. iii. p. 339. The term Avon, the 
original name of the river, was afterwards changed by the 
Anglo-Saxons who had possession of Galloway for nearly 400 
years previous to 820 to Fleet or Fleet, — a word of synony- 
mous import. 

Boundaries, 8fc. — Girthon is bounded on the east by Borgue, 
Twynholm, and Balmaghie ; on the north, by Kells and Minni- 
gafF ; on the west, by Kirkmabreck and Anwoth ; and on the 
south, by the Irish Sea. Its length is 16 miles : its breadth va- 
ries from 2 miles on the south, to 5 miles towards the north. The 
number of imperial acres in the parish is 15,480. 

Topographical Appearances. — The physical appearance of the 
parish is varied. About three-fourths of it is mountainous, bleak, 
and heathy, with but few spots devoted to tillage, or capable of 
producing corn. The remainder, chiefly on the south, though 
undulating, is rich, fertile, and susceptible of raising the best 
crops ; but is chiefly occupied in grazing cattle. 

Hydrography. — There are several fresh water lochs in the pa- 
rish, namely, Loch Greanoch, nearly three miles long, by an ave- 

Drawri up by Thomas Murray, LL.D, Author of " The Literary Historti of 
Gallowaij." " •' J

KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE. 



rage of about half a mile in breadth ; Loch Skero, about half a 
mile square ; the two Lochs Fleet. These lakes are all situated 
on the high mountain range on the north of the parish. Loch 
Whinnyan is on the east, on the borders of Twynholm. From 
each of the Lochs Fleet a streamlet flows ; and these uniting form 
what is called the Little Water of Fleet. After a course of a few 
miles, this stream is joined by a similar small river, termed the 
Great Water of Fleet. From these the Fleet is formed, which, 
dividing Girthon from Anwoth, discharges itself, after many wind- 
ings, into the Fleet Bay, an estuary of the Irish Sea. This river 
is navigable for vessels of 160 tons burden, to the town of Gate- 
house of Fleet, a distance of about three miles. In order to faci- 
litate the navigation to Gatehouse, and to reclaim a considerable 
portion of land, which, at high water, was covered by the sea, Mr 
Murray of Broughton has constructed a canal, which, besides 
gaining the two objects in question, has greatly shortened the dis- 
tance between the Fleet Bay and the town. Of this canal, which 
was begun on the 17th of June 1824, and opened on the 3d of 
October following, the length is 1400 yards. The cost was cal- 
culated by an eminent engineer at about L.5000. and the time 
required for constructing it, to be two summers. But Alexander 
Craig, Esq., then Mr Murray's factor, and whose ingenuity is well 
known, setting his local knowledge in opposition to the science of 
the engineer, cut a narrow trough along the centre of the pro- 
jected line of the canal, and of nearly the depth to which it was 
to be excavated, into which he forced the water of the Fleet. 
The result corresponded with Mr Craig's anticipations; for, in 
the course of only two days, the river formed a channel for itself 
of the exact width and depth required ; and the total expense, in- 
stead of being L.5000, was greatly under the half of that sum, — 
being only ■L.2204, 3s. 5d.  Nor is this all : no repairs have 
since been necessary to maintain or secure the banks of the canal 
so rapidly and singularly formed. There is another remarkable 
circumstance in connexion with the construction of this work. A 
rock on each side of its banks, directly opposite to each other, and 
nearly level with the bottom, jutted out ; and on these rocks the 
pins of a swing bridge have been erected, which affords great con- 
venience to the neighbourhood, and has enabled Mr Murray to 
remove the parish road from his domain. Thirty-six acres inter- 
vened between the line of the canal and the bed of the river, of 
which 15 belonged to Anwoth ; and the quantity of land reclaimed

is no less than 170 acres, now forming one of the most fertile and 
productive farms in Girthon. At the mouth of Fleet Bay are two 
small islands, uninhabited, but pastured by sheep, commonly call- 
ed Murray's Isles in honour of the proprietor, but more pro- 
perly the Isles of Fleet. The shores of Fleet Bay and Irish Sea 
are generally sandy or alluvial, though, in some places, they are 
rocky ; but there are, properly speaking, no headlands. 

Climate.— The air and climate vary with the soil and surface. 
In the high lands, they are cold and severe ; in the low lands, 
mild and agreeable. Rain is frequent. But, on the whole, the 
climate is regarded as salubrious ; and instances of longevity are 
common. There are no diseases peculiar to the locality. Cho 
lera made its appearance in 1832; but there were only three 
deaths. 

Geology and Mineralogy, — Girthon resembles, in these particu- 
lars, the adjoining districts, — the upper part of the parish being 
composed of granite, — the lower part of slaty schistous rock, 
easily decomposed, having many granite boulders lying on the sur- 
face, or slightly imbedded in the soil. The junction of the gra- 
nite and schistous rocks runs across the parish. A slate quarry 
was opened about twenty-seven years ago on the farm of Culreoch 
by the proprietor, and the parish church, built in 1817, is covered 
with slate from that quarry ; but it has not been worked, because 
slate from Westmoreland, Lancashire, and Wales can be had as 
cheap, if not cheaper, than from this source. About twenty-five 
years ago, a vein of copper ore was accidentally opened on the 
lands of Enrig, of a rich quality. A lease of it was taken by a 
company from Wales, who expended a considerable sum of mo- 
ney on works there. No vein of any magnitude has yet been hit 
upon, but numerous crests of rich ore discovered, several cargoes 
of which have been sent to Swansea, where it is used as a flux in 
smelting purer copper ores. 

Zoology. — Char, a very rare species of fish, abounds in Loch 
Greanoch. It is not caught either with bait or fly, but with the 
net. Loch Skero is remarkable for pike. Salmon is caught in 
the Fleet, but only to a trifling extent. Flounders abound in the 
river, and at its mouth. The isles of Fleet are productive of

and polecats. Pheasants have been introduced at Cally, the seat 
of Mr Murray of Broughton, and seem to thrive well. There is 
a deer park, extending to nearly 500 acres. The water eagle, or 
osprey, or bald buzzard the Falco Haliaetus of Linnaeus, fre- 
quents Lochs Skero and Greanoch, and builds on the islets which 
these lochs contain. The crested heron, a species of piscivo- 
rous water-fowl, haunts the different lochs in the northern dis- 
trict of the parish. 

Botany. — Under this head, there is nothing peculiar to Girthon, 
the botany of the hilly district to which this parish belongs being 
similar throughout. The quantity of wood in the parish extends 
to nearly 1000 acres ; and of this, about a third namelv, that on 
the south side of Barhill, on Disdow hill, and at Kindown, has 
been planted since the beginning of the present century. There 
is also a considerable quantity of natural wood in Boreland, Syl- 
lodoch, Carstammon, and a few other places.

Historical Notices. — In 1300, Edward I. resided for several days 
at the town of Fleet, probably on or near the site of the present 
Gatehouse. At this place the inhabitants endeavoured to stop 
his progress; but, being repulsed by a superior force, and by 
greater military skill, they fled to the woods and mountains.  Wal- 
siiffham, Hist. Reg. Anglice, p. 78. From Henry, the miller, 
who rented the mill of Gerthon Girthon, the king exacted 
13s. 4d. for some " malversations'' that had been detected in his 
mill. He exacted also, from the town of Flete Fleet, 40s. for 
their bad measures and other transgressions. This mill of Gir- 
thon is thought to be the same with the ancient "mill of the lake," 
within the farm of Rainton, about three miles south of Gatehouse. 
But, as if in compensation for these severities, Edward offered, on 
the 9th August, an oblation of 7s. at the altar of Girthon, and 
repeated the offering next day. Murray's Literary History of 
Galloioay, 1st ed. 1822, p. 348. 

The inhabitants of Girthon seemed to have been exposed to 
severe exactions and persecution during the reigns of Charles II. 
and his successor, James VII. On the Restoration, not only were 
the people deprived by the Government of their minister, Mr 
William Erskine, of whom we shall soon speak more at length ; 
but they were exposed to severe pecuniary exactions and other 
sufferings on account of their attachment to Presbytery. In 1666, 
for example, " nine poor families" were fined in L. 525, 10s. 4d.

Lennoxes of Cally, and now of the family of Broughton, was bu-

at the mouth of the vault, testifies : —

Eminent Characters— Mr William Erskine was minister of Gir- 
thon at the period of the Restoration. Having refused to conform 
to Prelacy, he was ejected from the parish in 1663, in which year 
nearly 400 Presbyterian clergymen, whose names are recorded in 
Wodrow i. p. 324, were ousted from their several charges, from 
the same cause. He was sentenced to confine himself within the 
parish of Carsphairn. Having ventured to leave his place of con- 
finement, and taken refuge in Teviotdale, he was declared a fugi- 
tive, in 1671; and in the following year, letters of intercomun- 
ing having been issued against him, he was apprehended, and

question, and public subscriptions. 

t This Robert Lennox, in the year previous to his martyrdom, granted a disposi- 
tion of Drumruck, which he had inherited from his father, in favour of David Len- 
nox, merchant in Kirkcudbright, and retired to Irelandton, in tlie neighbouring pa- 
rish of Twynholm. Robert Lennox was great grandson of John Lennox, the fourth 
of Cally, who died in 1647. Ca.ie of Margaret Lennox of Woodhcad. Edin. 1813.

lodged in Stirling Castle, from which, at the end of four years, he 
was transported to Dumbarton Castle. In 1679, he was liberated. 
He was again apprehended, and confined a close prisoner in Black- 
ness Castle; from which place he sent a petition to the Privy- 
Cowncil, stating, among other things, « that he was now turned 
valetudinary ; therefore craving the Council's compassion." The 
only redress he obtained was the liberty of " walking about 
the castle, and taking the air with a keeper." He was "alive at 
the Revolution ; but whether he afterwards was inducted into a 
parish charge, is not known. It is certain, at least, that he did not 
return to Girthon. {lb. 286, iii. 406, iv. 38.

Barlay. 

Land-owners.— Famili/ of Brouffhfon.—Ahxander Murray of 
Broughton, M. P. for the stewartry of Kirkcudbright, is proprie- 
tor of the entire parish. Cally, about a mile south of Gatehouse, 
is the residence of the family. The earliest proprietor of Cally 
that can be correctly ascertained was named Stewart: he de- 
scended, in the thirteenth century, from the illustrious family of 
the High Steward of Scotland. The title, which this Gallovi- 
dian branch of the Stewarts bore, was that of Stewart of Kalechfe- 
Girton, or sometimes of Kalecht, now Cally, and Girton. 
This family, after a lapse of nearly two centuries, terminated in 
a female, Elizabeth, only daughter and heiress of Sir John Stew- 
art of Cally, and this lady having married Donald de Levenax, 
or Lennox, son to the Earl of Levenax,  the property passed in- 
to a new family, and the name of Lennox, which was eminent for 
upwards of 300 years afterwards, was then first introduced into the 
province.f Donald Lennox, who died in 1454, is termed Bo- 
minus de Girthon et nohilis vir. John, the seventh of Callv, had 

 The houses of Lennox and of Stewart were previously connected by marriage, 
as tlie wife of Sir John Stewart of Girthon, mentioned in the text, and who fell at 
the siege of Orleans in 1429, was a daughter of the former family,— Douglas's Peer- 
age., i. 614. 

■f- In addition to the family of Cally, there were Lennoxes of Plunton, Drumwall, 
Driimruck, Tanniefad, Disdow, and all of them descended of the Cally branch ; but, 
there has not been, with a single exception, since the year 1708, when William 
Lennox of Drumwall sold that property to Alexander Murray of Broughton, a 
landed proprietor of the name o'f Lennox in Galloway. The son of William Lennos 
of Drumwall became tenant of that farm, and died in 1713, aged forty-eight. — {Case

a family of one son and daughter, the latter, Anna, being mar- 
ried to Richard Murray of Broughton. John Lennox renounced 
all ricrht and title to his various estates, and conveyed them to his 
soii-in-law, the laird of Broughton, and his son Robert afterwards 
concurred in the destination. The residence of Richard Murray, 
which had previously been at Broughton, in Wigtonshire, was 
transferred to Cally, which has ever since continued the seat of 
the Murray family. 

The founder of the family of Murray of Broughton came from 
Morayshire and settled at Broughton, Wigtonshire, in the twelfth 
century, since which time they have ranked among the magnates 
of Galloway. The first lands which they acquired in the stew- 
artry of Kirkcudbright, were obtained by a marriage with a daughter 
of Murray of Cockpool, Dumfries- shire. The lands thus ob- 
tained, and which still belong to the . family, were Kirkarsel and 
others in the parish of Rerrick ; and one of the monks of Dun- 
drennan having been suspected of improper intimacy with " Lady 
Broughton," her husband slew him at a place called Allan's 
Cross till this day. Murray was obliged to pay a fine, as a com- 
pensation for the murder, to the abbey, which fine L.IO, has 
continued to be, and is still paid to the Crown since the demoli- 
tion of the monastery. George Murray of Broughton was one 
of the Lords of the Bed-chamber to James VI., and, for his fur- 
ther services, had various grants of land given him in Ireland, 
which still belong to the family, as also several superiorities in 
Scotland, Nisbet's Heraldry, i. 256. Richard Murray, who 
married the heiress of Cally, died in 1690 ; and Alexander Mur- 
ray, M. P., the present representative of the family, is his great 
grandson. There are no collateral descendants of the Lennoxes 
of Cally or Murrays of Broughton known to exist. 

Cally. — This mansion, one of the most splendid seats in Scot- 
land belonging to a private gentleman, is built 1763 wholly of 
granite, being the first attempt of working that kind of stone in 
the south of Scotland. It was constructed after a design by 
Milne the architect, but has been modernised and signally im- 
proved by its present .proprietor. It contains a good collection 
of pictures, and in its unrivalled marble vestibule, are some fine 
pieces of sculpture, including a noble head of Bonaparte by Thor-

waldsen. The ruins of the ancient mansion are still pretty entire, 
about half a mile distant to the north from the present building. 
The garden occupies about three acres within the walls. The 
pleasure grounds extend to twenty acres; but the family have a 
private road extending for several miles within the adjoining parks, 
which are retained either in the hands of the proprietor, or are 
let as grass parks. The orchard grounds, particularly at the old 
mansion-house, are extensive. There is a deer park, nearly a 
mile square, within less than a mile of Cally, on the south. In 
addition to herds of deer, it contains a few of the ancient Cale- 
donian breed of cattle, procured from the stock of the Duke of 
Hamilton. 

Antiquities. — There are no antique buildings extant in the pa- 
rish, with the exception of the old mansion-house of Cally, al- 
ready mentioned. At Eurig, there was a house dependent on 
the abbacy of Tongland, and which, it is supposed, formed the 
occasionaVresidence of its abbots; and, after the Reformation, of 
the Bishop of Galloway. Its site is still known yet as the " Pa- 
lace Yard." Some old plane trees are growing, having a foliage 
different from those now propagated. The palace had apparently 
been surrounded by a ditch and wall, one of the arched gates 
having been standing, within the memory of a person intimately 
known to the present writer. There are several small moats in 
the parish, locally called " doons ;" one in Bush Park, another 
in En rig, and a third in Castrammon. 

III. — Population. 
The population of Girthon has greatly increased within the 
last eighty-five years. In 1755, it was 367; in 1841, it was 
1872, having been more than quintupled in the interval between 
these two periods. No village or town existed in the parish at 
the former date ; and the then proprietor of Cally, Alexander 
Murray, Esq., had not long previously ejected a great number of 
small tenants occupying a great part of the lower end of the pa- 
rish, and converted their farms into grazing' ground, in which state 
they still continue. The existing rural population, as is stated in 
the following table, is 495, so that the increase under this head 
is only 128.

rae proportion of individuals to a family is 4i. The number of 
inhabited houses is 263; in other words, the average of individuals 
to a house is 7.,. This great proportion is owing to the cir- 
cumstance that several of the houses in Gatehouse having com- 
mon stairs, or at least a common entrance, are tenanted by more 
than one family ; in some few instances by three or four. The 
following table shows the relative proportion of births, marriages, 
and deaths, for the three years ending in 1839 :

By taking the average of these three years, we find that the 
births are about 1 to every 36 of the population ; the marriages, 
I to every 170; and the deaths, 1 to every 48; the proportion 
of births being greater than the average of England and Wales ; 
of marriages, less ; and of deaths, less ; a good proof of the sa- 
lubrity of the chmate, and the prudence of the people in their 
formation of marriage connections, as also of the physical com- 
forts which they enjoy. Second Annual Report of the Regi.strar- 
General. London, 1840. But no perfectly sound conclusion, 
we confess, can be drawn from so limited a population as that of 
Girthon, particularly when embracing so short a space as three 
years.

The excess of females as compared to males, is 150. The 
number of tradesmen in the parish is 105, exclusive of appren- 
tices ; of labourers in Gatehouse, 56 ; while the whole rural po- 
pulation, with the exception of the farmers, may be considered as 
labourers. The number of illegitimate births within the last three 
years is 15, or, on an average, 5 annually; but some of the cases, 
though registered in the session book, do not actually belong to 
the parish. 

Character of the People. — There are no customs, games, or 
amusements peculiar to this parish. The belief in witches, fiiiries, 
brownies, dreams, and other superstitions, once universal in Gal- 
loway, has not been entirely laid aside ; particularly on the part 
of the older and more remote inhabitants. The houses of the 
people, particularly those of the farmers, are, in general, good 
and substantial. All classes enjoy, in a reasonable degree, the 



300 



KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE, 



comforts and advantages of civilized life, and are contented with 
their situation and circumstances. The duties of morality and 
religion are, on the whole, scrupulously practised ; and instances of 
crime or gross immorality are very rare. The people are, in general, 
intelligent, given to reading, and exert themselves to give the 
best education to their children. A very considerable number of 
young men, many of them of humble origin, have, during the 
last fifty years, after having received a good education, left the 
parish in order to push their fortunes in England, or abroad, and 
have, by their excellent conduct and success in life, done honour 
to the early advantages which they enjoyed. Perhaps no teacher, 
in a comparatively remote parish, has educated a greater number 
of such enterprising and respectable persons than Mr John Arm- 
strong, who, a few years before his death, which took place in 
1841, retired from his situation as parochial schoolmaster, which 
he had filled with honour to himself and advantage to the commu- 
nity upwards of forty years, and whom his old scholars have ever 
regarded with gratitude and aflfection, both for his eminent talents 
and the blandness of his manners. But while so many Girtho- 
nians have distinguished themselves in the way to which we have 
referred, the parish has not, till comparatively recent times, pro- 
duced any who have prosecuted any of the learned professions. 
The writer of this account knows of only one instance in the last 
century, of a native of Girthon having attended a Scotch uni- 
versity ; but within the last thirty years, no fewer than eight per- 
sons, natives of the parish, all educated by Mr Armstrong, ex- 
cept one, have studied at the University of Edinburgh. Of these, 
two are dead, one is in the United States of America, and another 
is still undergoing his studies : the remaining four are settled in 
life in Scotland. 

Poaching is very strictly prohibited by the proprietor of the pa- 
rish ; but when game so much abounds, it is hardly possible to 
eradicate so demoralizing a practice. Smuggling of lea, ardent 
spirits, wine, and other articles, from the Ise of Man, systemati- 
cally prevailed here, as it did along the whole Galloway coast, 
to a very great extent, about fifty years ago ; but such a charac- 
ter as a smuggler does not now exist ; though many traditions as 
to exploits in this way are still current. Pawnbroking has never 
obtained in the parish. 

IV. — Industry. 
The total number of imperial acres in the parish is 15,480 ; of 



GIKTIION. 



301 



which the quantity cultivated nnay be about 4000; leavmg the 
remainder, or 9480 acres, either as waste or in permanent sheep 
pasture. There neither is, nor ever has been, any land in the pa- 
rish in a state of undivided common. The total rental of Girthon, 
putting a reasonable value on the house and garden of Cally, 
may be estimated at L.5000, making an average of about 6s. 6d. 
per imperial acre. The total old valuation of the parish m the 
cess book is L.3281, 3s. Gd. Scots, or L.273, 8s. Td. Sterling. 
The average rate of grazing is, for a cow, L.3; for a ewe or full- 
grown sheep, 3s.

The duration of leases extends to nineteen years ; and the old 
tenants on Mr Murray's estates generally are seldom removed, 
the progenitors of several of the existing farmers having held lands 
on the estate for successive generations. The farm-buildings and 
inclosures in the parish are generally in a respectable and efficient 
state; and the most liberal encouragement is afforded by the 
proprietor to his tenants. 

Fisheries. — The Fleet produces salmon and grilse ; but the 
fishery is seldom let; and, when let, only for a nominal sum.

KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE. 



Manufactures. — The late James Murray, Esq. of Broughtoii, 
who, as shall soon be more particularly stated, exerted himself to 
make Gatehouse a flourishing town, was the means of introducing 
the cotton manufacture into this place in 1790 ; in which year, he 
held out encouragement to Messrs Birtwhistle and Sons, from 
Yorkshire, who erected two cotton mills, which, with an interval 
of nearly twenty years subsequently to 1810, have ever since been 
in active operation. They have, for upwards of twelve years, been 
held in lease from the representatives of the original firm by Messrs 
James Davidson and Co., who are prosecuting the business with 
great spirit and enterprise. The mills are driven by water drawn 
from Loch Whinnyan, which ran into the Dee; but a tunnel from 
the lake having been cut through a hill at an expense of L.1400, 
the waters of the lake were thereby conveyed in an opposite direc- 
tion to Gatehouse. The number of wheels is two ; the total 
power is equivalent to fifty- five horse-power. The number of 
hands employed is above 200, of whom about a half are eighteen 
years of age and upwards. The rate of wages averages 9s. a-week 
to each individual. The quantity of cotton cloth manufactured 
per annum is about 60,000 pieces, or, as each piece consists of 
24 yards, 1,440,000 yards. We regard these statements as ho- 
nourable to the Messrs Davidson and Co., particularly when we 
reflect on the comparative difficulties under which, from their iso- 
lated and remote situation, they labour, both as to the purchase 
and carriage of the raw material, and to the disposal and sale of 
the manufactured article. But, by dint of energy and ingenuity, 
they seem to be in a condition to cope In the market with compe- 
titors who enjoy facilities unknown to them. 

The upper mill was destroyed by fire on the morning of the 
14th October 1840. The fire originated in the scutching-room, 
in the lowest flat, in consequence of the fanner of one of the 
spreading machines giving way, which, coming against its iron 
encasement, struck fire and ignited the loose cotton around ; and, 
notwithstanding every effort that could be made to arrest the pro- 
gress of the flames, the whole factory, with its valuable machines, 
including seventy-four power-looms, was, in the short space of an 
hour and a-half, a heap of ruins. The damage done to the build- 
ing is estimated at from L.900 to L.I 000, which was only partly 
covered by insurance. The destruction of machinery, which was 
fully covered by insurance, is calculated at from L.6000 to L.7000. 
The mill has now been rebuilt, with various improvements. The 

4

new machinery, with which it is now fitted, is of the most modern 
and improved description ; and, altogether, the factory, which is 
again in operation, is in a more efficient state than it was before 
the conflagration took place. 

There is a brick manufactory about a quarter of a mile to the north 
of Gatehouse, belonging to Mrs Hornsby. The quantity of brick 
made averages about 60,000 per annum. The wages paid to the men, 
who vary in number at different seasons of the year, are 9s. per week. 
There is also a brewery carried on by Mr Andrew Kirk, in which 
927 bushels of barley are manufactured into ale and beer annually. 
The number of men employed is three. Their wages are 10s. per 
week. There is also an extensive nursery belonging to Mr Credie, 
which has existed for nearly half a century. A tannery exists in 
a flourishing state on the west of the Fleet ; but as this is in the 
parish of Anwoth, it does noi fall within our sphere. Green hides 
are manufactured in Gatehouse by Mr Samuel Blyth, to the ex- 
tent of about L.400 annually. 

Navigation. — Boat-Green, the port of Gatehouse, is on the 
Anwoth side of the Fleet ; but as it is not 300 yards from the 
bridge which here unites the two parishes, and as by far the prin- 
cipal portion of the trade is connected with this town and parish, 
we have thought it proper to give here the following table, con- 
taining an abstract of the shipping, both inward and outward, at

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town. — The only village and market-town in the parish 
is Gatehou.se of Fleet, which contains, as previously mentioned, 
a population of 1377. The town of Fleet, formerly alluded to, 
and which is supposed to have stood on the site which Gatehouse 
now occupies, has long disappeared, nor do any traditions respect- 
ing it exist in the parish. The only traces of its existence con- 
sists in the eight weekly markets held in successive Fridays, be- 
ginning on the first Friday of November, annually. Symson, who 
wrote in the time of Charles IL, and before a stone of the present 
town was laid, says, " At a place called Gatehouse of Fleet, there 
is a market for good fat kine kept on the Friday after the first

Thursday, wliich is after the first Monday of November, and so 
every Friday thereafter till Christinas." Large Description of 
Galloway, p. 2G. It is well known that, at that date, not a house 
existed in Gatehouse except an inn ; and it may, therefore, not 
improperly be inferred, that the privilege which the place enjoyed 
©f holding markets had been conferred on the town of Fleet, and 
that it survived though the town ceased to exist. Caledonia, iii. 
329. An inn, it is likely, always obtained at this spot, as it lay 
on the great line of road between Dumfries and Portpatrick. The 
first house in the modern village of Gatehouse, in addition to the 
inn, was erected in 1760, under the auspices of the late James 
Murray of Broughton ; and, in order to insure the stability and 
prosperity of the town, the same gentleman held out the most li- 
beral encouragement for the introduction of manufactures and 
other branches of industry. It was in this way that Messrs Birt- 
wbistle were induced to settle in the place as manufacturers. 
Messrs Thomas Scott and Co. also erected two cotton mills, on 
the north-east extremity of the tovrn, which did not long exist, 
and, unlike the establishment of Messrs Birtwhistle, have not been 
revived. Mr Murray established a wine company, a brewery, and 
a tannery, being all joint-stock concerns, of which he held a num- 
ber of shares himself, along with many gentlemen of the county, 
and some from England, particularly Messrs Atkinson of Temple 
Sowerby, and Messrs Freeland, merchants in Liverpool. These 
companies were all placed under the management of persons from 
England ; but they did not turn out lucrative speculations, — none 
of the partners taking an active interest in them, — and they were 
eventually dissolved.f Hence it was that numerous families from 
England were encouraged to settle in Gatehouse in connection 
with these various works. A branch of the Union Bank of Pais- 
ley was introduced, and for several years carried on an extensive 
business, but was afterwards withdrawn. About a dozen years 
ago, a branch of the Commercial Bank of Scotland was established 
at Gatehouse ; and, on its discontinuance two years ago, a branch 
of the Western Bank of Scotland was introduced. In 1795, Mr 
Murray erected the town into a burgh of barony, to be governed 
by a provost, two bailies, and four councillors, with the privilege 

• Mr Murray, however, held no shares in either of the cotton manufactories, 
 The tannery was the most successful of these speculations ; Mr Davitts, the ori- 
ginal manager, and sifterwards the sole proprietor, having realized a handsome fortune 
by the business.

of holding a weekly market on Saturdays, and an annual fair on 
the first Monday of June. 

Mr Murray, who thus induced many English families to take 
up their residence at Gatehouse, by a deed executed in 1797, and 
registered in Kirkcudbright in 1799, founded an Episcopal church 
in the vicinity of the burgh, in order that these persons might en- 
joy religious worship and ordinances according to the ritual of that 
Church to which they belonged. With this chapel he connected 
an academy for the education of their children ; the erection of 
which buildings cost about L.3000. These two institutions, how- 
ever, were not meant for the exclusive advantage of the English 
settlers, but were open to all who might choose to take advantage 
of them. Nor is this all. In executing an entail of his whole 
estate, Mr Murray bound his son, the present proprietor, and all 
the successors in the entail, to maintain these establishments for 
all time coming. He appointed the Rev. Matthew Vicars both 
minister of the chapel and rector of the academy, and provided 
that the person holding the living should be a member of the 
Church of England, and should act both as a clergyman and as 
teacher of the school connected with the chapel. He allocated 
twenty-five and a-half acres of land, specially mentioned in the 
deed of entail, to Mr Vicars and his successors, as a glebe, and 
fixed a permanent stipend of L. 40 yearly. The clergyman had 
also a spacious dwelling-house built for his use, possessing ample 
accommodation for boarders ; and the school, which was attended 
by many young men from a distance, soon attained to eminence. 
But Mr Vicars, who is now rector of All-Hallows, in the city of 
Exeter, left Gatehouse twenty-four years ago; since which time 
the establishment has remained in 'abeyance, and the dwelling- 
house and chapel have been . taken down, the latter being nomi- 
nally attached to the mansion-house of Cally. No assistant has 
meanwhile been appointed ; but upon the death of Mr Vicars, 
and if no successor be appointed within six months thereafter, then 
the Lord President of the Court of Session, the Lord Chief-Ba- 
ron of Exchequer, and the Lord Justice- Clerk, for the time being, 
shall have power to appoint a person, duly qualified, to be joint 
clergyman and rector, with all the privileges and emoluments be- 
longing to the office. 

The town of Gatehouse consists mainly of three streets running 
nearly at right angles with the river, and parallel to each other. 
The bridge over the Fleet is on a line with the main or front

Street. This bridge, or rather a bridge on the sanme site, seems to 
have existed at a remote period ; perhaps at the time when the 
place was visited, in 1300, by Edward I. In 1661, Richard Mur- 
ray of Broughton obtained an Act of the Scottish Parliament for 
' rebuilding the bridge over the Fleet at Gatehouse of Fleet, and 
authorizing him to levy certain tolls on all horses, cattle, and sheep 
passing this bridge, to reimburse him for the expense of building and 
upholding the same. " Act. Parl.vii. 241. The present bridge, 
which consists of two ample arches, has been twice widened consider- 
ably ; the last time was about twenty-five years ago. A portion 
about a fifth part of the town of Gatehouse lies on the west side of 
the river, in the parish of Anwoth, principally on the line of the turn- 
pike road; but this, as it is situated in another parish, has not 
been taken into account in this article, and the population thereof 
not included in this report. 

Means of Communication. — There is a post-office in Gatehouse. 
The only turnpike road in Girthon that which connects Dum- 
fries and Portpatrick runs through the parish from Gatehouse to 
Barharrow, a distance of only two miles. In order to remove this 
road a little farther from the mansion-house of Cally, a line was 
cut, in 1820, through the Gallow-Hill, at the private expense of 
Mr Murray, which cost upwards of L. 3000. Two mail coaches 
pass through the town daily, one going to Portpatrick, the other 
returning from it. There are various parish roads, all of them in 
pretty good order ; the principal of which is the road leading from 
Gatehouse northward to the mineral well of Lochenbreck and 
Laurieston, both in the parish of Balmaghie. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church was situated, from the 
remotest date, about two miles south of Gatehouse, till 1818, 
when a new and substantial church, capable of containing about 
800 sitters, was built at Gatehouse, on a suitable and convenient 
site. The former edifice was unroofed, and now exists as a ruin. 
It stands in the centre of the only burial-ground in the parish. 
The family of Broughton bury in a vault underneath the church. 

The manse was formerly situated in the immediate vicinity of 
the old church, but a new one was erected about fifty years ago, 
within less than half a-mile of Gatehouse. It has undergone various 
successive alterations and repairs, and is, on the whole, a comfort- 
able building. The glebe extends to 22 acres ; its annual value may 
be between L.25 and L.30. The stipend, which is paid from Crown 
teinds, was L. 66, 15s. 5d. in 1755; it is now L. 141, 13s. '2d.;

and a sum is paid by the Exchequer to bring it up to the legal 
minimum of L.150. 

The patronage of the church and parish belonged, of old, to the 
Bishop of Galloway, who is supposed to have had a residence at En- 
rig in the parish ; and some venerable trees there are still called the 
" Palace trees." Soon after the Reformation, namely, in 1587, 
the patronage was transferred to the King, but was, next year, be- 
stowed on William Melville, commendator of Tongland, after- 
wards a Lord of Session, under the title of Lord Tongland, and 
who died in I6ia Murray's Lit. Hist, of Galloway, 2d edit., 
1832, p. 23. On the re-establishment of Episcopacy in 1606, 
the patronage of Girthon was anew vested in the Bishop of Gal- 
loway, but this was not to take effect till Melville's death ; and at 
the Revolution it was restored to the Crown, to which it has ever 
since belonged. Caledonia, iii. 330. 

At the Reformation, the revenues of the parsonage and vicarage 
of Girthon were let to John Gordon of Kenmure, for L.113, 6s. 
8d. Scots ; but owing " to the non-payment of the pasch fines, 
cors present, and umest [uppermost] claithes," the lease was re- 
duced, lb. 

There is at present a small " Free Church" congregation in 
Gatehouse, who assemble in the Mason Lodge, having no sepa- 
rate place of worship of their own. The Independents had, for 
thirty years, an ordained minister here ; but at his death, a few 
years ago, no successor was appointed. Of the fate of the Epis- 
copal chapel we have already spoken.

tholics are visited periodically by the priest who is settled at Dal-

stewartry of Kirkcudbright belongs to the diocese of the Bishop, 
whose residence is in Edinburgh. 

The following is a list of the ministers of the parish of Gir- 
thon from the Reformation to the present time, so far as their 
names can now be ascertained : John Bonar, 1595-1596 ; Alex- 
ander Frizel ; John M'Lellan, 1638-1655 ; Simeon Knox; 
William Erskine, 1659-1662; Robert Moir, 1690-1693; Wil- 
liam Gammell, 1693-1697 ; Patrick Johnston,f 1699-1736; 
Robert Thomson, 1737-1758; Robert Cooper, 1759-1776; 
John M'Naught, deposed, 1778-1793; William Thorburn, 
translated to Troqueer, 1792-1801; Robert Gordon, 1801- 
1817; Robert Jeffrey, resigned, 1818-1843; George Murray, 
1843. 

Education. — The means of education are ample. The parish 
school was improved subsequently to the retirement of Mr Arm- 
strong, and is a large and commodious building. The schoolmas- 
ter's house, which is not worthy of the parish, is immediately at- 
tached to it, with a valuable garden immediately behind. The 
salary is considerably higher than the maximum, owing to the li- 
berality of Mr Murray. There are four schools in addition to the 
parochial one, of which three are unendowed ; the fourth is a 
charity school, supported by Lady Anne Murray of Broughton, 
and in which not only education but clothes are given gratuitously. 
Acco''ding to an official return made to Government, Educat. 
Enquiry, Scotland, Pari. Paper, 1837, Vol. xlvii. the number of 
pupils at the parish school was 120 ; in the non-parochial schools, 
144 ; total, 264, or about the seventh of the entire population, — 
a proportion very unusual, and highly honourable to the character 
of the parish. The proportions at the different seminaries have 
since considerably changed, and the aggregate number of scholars 
has rather increased than diminished. There is no need of addi- 
tional schools. The inhabitants of the northern district of the 
parish, indeed, labour under great disadvantages as to education, 
owing to their distance from any school. Nor is it likely that they 
will ever enjoy greater facilities in this respect, owing to the ex- 
treme thinness of population. It is not an unusual thing, how-

ever, for children resident in that quarter to travel three or four 
miles to school. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The average number of persons re- 
ceiving parochial aid averages rather under 50 ; average sum allot- 
ted to each weekly, 1 s. 4d. The fund from which the disbursement 
is made arises from church collections, which, in 1836, was L.55, 
lis.; in 1837, L.55, 17s.; in 1838, L.56, 4s. 3d.; in 1839, 
L.53, 9s.; in 1840, L.4G, 10s.; in 1841, L.46, 16s.; and from 
a voluntary assessment of L.168, in 1841, paid by Mr Murray of 
Broughton ; but these assessments necessarily vary from year to 
year. Poor's rates, in the direct sense of the term, are unknown 
here. 

Savings Bank. — There is a savings bank in the parish, under the 
auspices of Mr Kirkpatrick. The amount invested is about sta- 
tionary at L.1200. There are various friendly societies. 

Prison. — There has, for some years, been a lock-up-house at 
Gatehouse, meant to be used in .cases of petty crimes or offences ; 
but it is seldom necessary to have recourse to it. 

Fuel. — At one time, peat was the chief fuel used ; but, except 
in the middle and higher portions of the parish, coals, got from 
Whitehaven and Workington, have been all but universally pre- 
ferred within the last thirty or forty years. The price of coals 
may be about 15s. per ton of 20 cwt. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The state of the parish has varied, and, in most instances, has 
been signally improved, since the former Statistical Account was 
written in 1 792. There have been a new church and manse built, 
— the former at Gatehouse, the latter in the vicinity, both in the 
best situations, in the very centre of the great bulk of the popula- 
tion of the parish. The income of the minister, including stipend, 
manse, and glebe, was then estimated at L. 1 20 ; it is now about 
L.200. The weekly church collections were then L.25 per an- 
num ; they are now upwards of twice that amount. There was 
then only one school in the parish ; there are now five. The po- 
pulation has increased 509, or from 1363 to 1872. The only 
turnpike road in the parish was rude and almost impracticable, 
running nearly in a straight line over successive hills, some of them 
fully 300 feet above the level of the sea. A new turnpike road 
was constructed about forty years ago, which is one of the best in 
the kingdom, approaching nearly to a level. A similar improve- 
ment has been eflTected along the whole line of road from Dum- 



KIRKCUDBUIGHTSHIRE. 

fries to Portpatrick. The parish roads have also been greatly im- 
proved. The people are more intelligent, refined, and cleanly in 
their habits; their dress and food are of a higher description; and 
their superstitious belief and observances have been greatly weak- 
ened, if not entirely eradicated, particularly in the case of the 
younger portion of the population. Almost every farm-house has 
been rebuilt; and instead of rude hovels of one storey, the new 
tenements are of two stories, and distinguished as much for com- 
fort and convenience, if not elegance, as the old ones were for 
meanness, and want of the most obvious accommodations. Houses 
of all kinds were, with few exceptions, thatched with straw; now 
they are almost all covered with slate. The most modern and 
improved systems of husbandry, both as respects rotation of crops 
and agricultural implements, have been introduced ; and the rent 
of land has risen at least a third ; while the farmers are of a higher 
grade, and far more comfortable in their circumstances. The far- 
mer, instead of sitting in the same apartment with his servants, 
and eating at the same table, has now a snug parlour or dining- 
toom appropriated to himself and family ; takes his meals off a co- 
vered table ; and the horn or pewter spoon has, in most cases, given 
way to silver. The hodden-gray and other home-made clothes 
have disappeared, even in the case of servants, both male and fe- 
male, and their place has been supplied by broad cloths, cotton, and 
silks, such as would do credit to the metropolitan county of Scot- 
land. The only drawback to be placed in opposition to this re- 
presentation is the failure and disappearance of the wine company, 
tannery, and brewery, forced businesses which could not succeed, 
and to which we have referred under a former head. The 
June annual fair, and the various markets at Gatehouse, have also 
greatly fallen off. The Irish horses and cattle, which formed the 
staple articles at these marts, instead of being sent through Gal- 
loway, are almost all transported direct in steam-boats from Bel- 
fast and the other Irish towns to the leading markets in England. 
In 1812, for example, 20,000 horses and black-cattle were im- 
ported at Portpatrick from Ireland. The number in 1837 was 
only 1080. It is owing to this cause alone that the markets of 
Gatehouse, as also those of other towns in Galloway, have de- 
clined.

PRESBYTERY OF WIGTON, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY. 

THE REV. JOHN MUIR, MINISTER. 



I —Topography and Natural History. 
2a,me —The parish of Kirkmabreck is formed of the old pa- 
rish of this name, and the largest portion of the old parish of 
Kirkdale. The name of Kirkmabreck was composed, says Chal- 
mers, in his Caledonia, by prefixing the Saxon Cyrc to Mabreck, 
the previous name of the place where the kirk was built. Ma- 
breck, or Magh-breck, is a local name, and signifies, in the Irish 
speech, the variegated plain. In fact, the plain whereon the church 
stood, abounds with many rocks and stones of granite, which give 
it a speckled appearance. For the same reason, a large plain in 
the vicinity of Tarah, in Ireland, is supposed to take the name of 
Maghbreck.i 

Symson, however, assures us that Kirkmabreck was so called 
from some saint whose name was Macbreck, a part of whose statue 
in wood was, about thirty years before the time he wrote his His- 
tory of Galloway, in an old chapel at the Ferrytown. Of this 
statue, however, there is now no trace, and no tradition ; and we 
search the Martyrologies in vain for such a saint as Macbreck or 
Mabreck.: 

The late Mr M'Lean of Mark, in the old Statistical Ac- 
count of this parish, gives a diff'erent etymology from either of 
the preceding. Kirkmabreck, says he, or more properly the 
church in the brake, is exceedingly descriptive of the place in 
which the church formerly stood. For, as brake signifies furze, 
brambles, thorns, heath, ferns, &amp;c., so not only the particular 
place in which the church stood, but also many other places in the 
parish, are encumbered with those substances. 

» Kirkmabreck was at one time in Kirkcudbright Presbytery, but was transferred 
to "Wigton in the year 1699. , o „. i

KIRKCUDBllIGHTSHIRE. 



The name of Kirkdale parish is derived from the Anglo-Saxon 
Cyrc-dale— signifying the church in the vale. 

The names, therefore, of Kirkmabreck and Kirkdale have evi- 
dently a reference to the situat ion or dedication of their respec- 
tive churches, an account of vk-hich may not here be out of place. 

The church of Kirkmabreck belonged to the monks of Dun- 
drainan previous to the Reformation, and it was afterwards vested 
in the King, by an Act of General Annexation, in 1587. This 
church, with the other property of the monastery of Dundrainan, 
were granted by the King, in 1606, to John Murray, and the 
grant was ratified in Parliament in 1609 and 1612.' In 1621, 
this church, with all its tithes and revenues, were, by Act of Par- 
liament, disjoined from the Abbey of Dundrainan, and granted to 
Sir Robert Gordon of Lochinvar, and his heirs.f The parish of 
Kirkmabreck, and the adjacent parish of Kirkdale, were afterwards 
annexed to the parish of Anwoth ; but this union was dissolved in 
1636, when a new and more convenient arrangement was made, 
whereby a small part of Kirkdale was annexed to Anwoth, and the 
greater part was united to Kirkmabreck. These changes were 
finally ratified by Parliament in 1641, and the boundaries of the 
parish have continued the same ever since, — though Symson says 
Skairbourn was the march with Anwoth in 1684. In 1645, how- 
ever, an Act of Parliament was passed for transplanting the church 
of Kirkmabreck, and a new church was built for the united parish 
of Kirkmabreck and Kirkdale, in a more accessible and convenient 
situation, at what was then called the Ferry Town of Cree, where 
there had been of old a chapel, and where there is now a prospe- 
rous village, called Creetown. The ruins of the old church of 
Kirkmabreck may still be seen standing in the old churchyard, in 
a very lonely and sequestered spot, near a farm-house of the same 
name. The old churchyard is still used, and contains many old 
and curious grave-stones, some of which are the workmanship of 
• " Old Mortality." 

The patronage of the old parish of Kirkmabreck belonged, 
in 1684, to the Laird of Rusco. The patronage of the united 
parish of Kirkmabreck and Kirkdale now belongs to John M'Cul- 
loch, Esq. of Barholm, and the Crown.:}: 
• Act. Par. IV. 326, 444, 495. 

f This grant stipulated, that the grantee and his heirs should pay the minister 
serving the cure the same yearly stipend which Murray was obliged to pay by tlie 
previous grant, and that they should furnish the communion elements, and repair the 
church.

Kirkdale. — The old church of this parish, which was dedicated 
to St Michael the Archangel, stood in the valley of a small 
stream which falls into Wigton Bay. Chalmers in his Caledonia 
says, that even the ruins of the ancient Cyrc have disappeared. 
This, however, is a mistake ; the time-worn and ivy-clad ruins of 
this ancient place of worship still stand in the midst of the old 
cemetery of Kirkdale ; and what was once a sanctuary for the 
living, has now become the sepulchre of the dead. Indeed it has 
long been the burying-place of the ancient family of the M'Cul- 
lochs of Barholm, and, so late as the year 1836, the remains of 
the most estimable and deeply-lamented lady of the present Mr 
M'Culloch of Barholm were buried there. The Kirkdale church- 
yard is also still preserved as the burying-place of some of the 
oldest families in the parish. The Hannays of Kirkdale and 
Mochrum have here their family vault, which is handsomely and 
substantially built of granite. The churchyard itself is of small 
dimensions, and has been originally surrounded, but is now com- 
pletely overshadowed with trees. It is impossible to conceive a 
more lonely spot. The situation is solitude itself, — remote — ro- 
mantic — placed in a dreary vale, in the bosom of a wood sur- 
rounded by hills — within sight of the troubled ocean, and within 
hearing of the ceaseless wailings of the stream. Nothing can 
surpass the solemnity of the scene. In entering the churchyard, 
the living feel as already in communion with the dead, and behold, 
in the most striking manner, " How still and peaceful is the grave." 

The church of Kirkdale belonged to the King in the reign of 
James IV., who transferred it to the priory of Whithorn. It ap- 
pears that, in July 1505, the King presented Mr Richard Aiken- 
head to the rectory of Kirkdale, vacant by the decease of Sir 
Robert Fard. In November 1508, Henry, the prior of Candi- 
da Casa, obtained a charter from James IV. of the church of 
Kirkdale. This charter was granted at the priory, while the 
King was on a pilgrimage to the ancient seat of St Ninians.f 
With this priory this church remained till the Reformation, when 
it was vested in the King by the General Act of Annexation in 
1587. At the Reformation, the tithes of Kirkdale were let by 
the prior and canons for L.24 Scots yearly. X When James VI. 
re-established Episcopacy, he granted, in 1606, to the Bishop of

Galloway, the priory of Whithorn with its pertinents, of which 
this church was one. But when Episcopacy was finally abo- 
lished in 1689, the patronage of Kirkdale reverted to the Crown, 
— and the Sovereign, as patron of this church, enjoys a moiety of 
the patronage of the united parish with M'CuUoch of Barholm.f 

Extent and Boundaries,' — The united parish of Kirkmabreck 
and Kirkdale is of an irregular shape, and is about 9 miles long, 
and 5| miles broad. It is bounded on the north by MinnigafF; 
on the east, by Girthon ; on the south, by Anwoth ; and on 
the west, by the Cree and Wigton Bay.

is mountainous, and may be said to be formed of a succession of 
hills and valleys ; and the ridges of mountains, which rise rapidly 
from the shore and intersect the parish, have a very picturesque 
effect, particularly from Wigtonshire. The hills are in general 
covered with heath, and present a variegated appearance ; and the 
sloping banks of Kirkdale and Cassencarrie are covered for miles 
with beautiful copsewood, which at all times, bat especially in 
autumn, gives a singular richness to the whole landscape. 

Mountains. — The principal mountains in this parish are the 
Glints of Drumore, Craig, Pebble, Cairnharrow, Larg. These 
are all from 800 to 1000 feet above the level of the sea, and are 
principally composed of granite, greywacke, and clay-slate, and 
are partially covered with heath. A part of Cairnsmore is also 
in this parish. It is the largest as well as the highest of all the 
mountains in this neighbourhood, and was found by the civil-en- 
gineers employed by Government many years ago, to be 2222 
feet above the level of the sea. It is wholly of granite, and par- 
tially covered with heath, and, at a little distance, it has a singu- 
larly gray and sparkling appearance. There is a plain of consi- 
derable extent upon its summit, with less heath and more soil and 
herbage than upon its sides. The top of Cairnsmore commands 
a most extensive view of many of the counties of Scotland, and 
of the Isle of Man, Ailsa Craig, and a part of England and Ireland. 

Surface and Soil. — The surface upon the hills is thin and much 
broken by projecting rocks. The valleys, again, are green, with 
a better soil, and have been considerably improved by shelling, 
and now yield good crops of grain and pasture. The land upon

the Cree, and along the shore the whole length of the parish, 
is in creneral very good. Some table-land very superior. The 
soil is in some places alluvial, but is in general light; and there 
are several fields along the shore covered entirely with shells to a 
considerable depth. The shells, however, are in such a state of 
decomposition, that the fields have been long under tillage; and 
in the north end of the parish, there is a considerable field of 
moss at Carsewalloch and Muirfad. 

Caves, Caverns, and Fissures. — There are several of these 
along this coast. Some of them are very curious, especially op- 
posite Ravens Hall. They are frequently visited by strangers, 
and are well worthy of inspection. They seem to have been 
formed by the ebbing and flowing of the tide, and are of very 
considerable extent. In some places the sea has forced a pas- 
sage through the rocks, and at other places it has cloven them 
like the granitic rocks of Hillswick Ness. There is one very re- 
markable cave, but being of difficult access, it is seldom visited. 
Its mouth is like a pit of two fathoms deep, at the bottom of 
which the cave diverges almost at right angles, and penetrates 
the rocks towards the north to a considerable distance. It is 
said that no person has yet explored it to the end. Tradition has 
claimed this as the cave of Dirk Hatterick ; and the supposition 
is strengthened by the legends of the parish, and the striking 
likeness of our coast scenery to the graphic delineations of Guy 
Mannering. An old tower, not far from this cave, is pointed out 
as " EUangowan Castle," — a curious ravine, as " Meg Merrilees' 
Path," — and a mansion on the Cree, as " Woodburn House." 

There is a remarkable fissure in the Knock Down of Carsluth. 
The hill appears to have been split by violence at some remote 
period. The opposite sides of the ravine are very like, and ap- 
pear to fit into each other with remarkable precision. 

Coast. — The coast is about six miles in extent, and is in ge- 
neral flat, sandy, and shelly. The Kirkdale shore is rocky, bold, 
high, and precipitous. 

Meteorology. — Amongst the various prognostics of the weather 
spoken of in this parish, may be mentioned the peculiar and dis- 
tant noise of the rising tide, and the flocking of sea- fowl to the

shore, — the signs which Virgil so well describes.  These are 
regarded by many as indications of a change of weather ; and 
when the foam is floating plentifully upon the rising tide, or when 
the shadows of the trees and houses on the opposite side of the 
bay are reflected in the sands, these are regarded by some as ne- 
ver-failing signs of approaching rain ; and if, at the same time, 
the smoke of Wigton is hanging over this town or descending to- 
wards the bay, it is affirmed that rain is at hand. 

The barometer generally ranges between 28| and 30 inches. 
By the thermometer, the mean temperature for the year may be 
about 47. 

The prevailing winds are from the south and south-west, and 
our severest storms of rain and snow are from the south or south-east. 

Climate, — The climate may be considered healthy from the 
number of old people generally to be found in the parish. The 
air upon the whole is pure and dry, although for a few years the 
seasons have been cold and wet. The rain, even when it falls in 
considerable quantities, is carried off" rapidly, and the lands and 
roads are soon left dry. The diseases most prevalent are catarrh, 
pleuritis, and rheumatism. From the old Statistical Account, it 
appears that small-pox had prevailed very much at one time in 
this" parish, which was attributed to the prejudice of parents 
against vaccination. This prejudice has disappeared, although 
some parents still neglect to get their children vaccinated, which 
is a most hazardous and culpable omission. In the spring of 1836, 
small-pox prevailed in Creetown to a considerable extent. Six 
adults died who had never been vaccinated ; but those who had, 
either escaped the disease altogether, or soon recovered from it. 

Hydrography. — The Bay of Wigton, which forms the western 
boundary of the parish, may be, in some places, about six miles wide, 
and nine miles long. By the ebbing of the tide, it is left nearly dry, 
and presents a large and smooth surface of sand, intersected by 
the Cree and Bladenoch. By the flowing of the tide, which oc- 
casionally rises 22 feet above the level of the river, tlie whole 
bay is one beautiful and unbroken sheet of water; and in calm 
weather, the hills around, and the Heavens above, and the ves- 
sels upon its surface, are reflected as in a mirror.

The current is considerable, both in the ebbing and flowing of 

the tide. i • • u 

Eivers.—The Cree is the only river connected with this parish. 
It is said to rise out of Loch-moan, where the three counties meet, 
and for miles it forms not only the boundaries of Penninghame 
and Minnigaff, but also of the two counties, Wigton and Kirkcud- 
bright, and finally falls into the Solway, after a course of about 
twenty-eight miles. From Newton- Stewart to Creetown, its 
course is singularly eccentric and serpentine, — and, as seen from 
Larg hill, it gives a charm to- the whole landscape. It is navi- 
gable for small vessels to Carty. A poem, lately published, under 
the title of " The Rivers of Galloway," has made honourable men- 
tion of the Cree. 

Springs. — Chalybeate springs are found in many parts of the 
parish, especially at Muirfad, Cuil, Falbae, Pibble, Ferryburn, 
Blackmire,-|-&amp;c. The one at Pibble is particularly powerful, and 
is occasionally frequented by invalids with much advantage. These 
waters have, perhaps, never been carefully analyzed, although the 
presence of iron, magnesia, and sulphur, may be easily detected. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The lower district of the parish is 
clay-slate or schist of a recent formation. All the different forma- 
tions of clay-slate are to be found in the parish. On some of the 
hills the floets trap and greywacke supersede the clay-slate, and on 
others the gneiss formation, particularly on the south end of Cairns- 
more. Traces of the whin dike are also found in different places ; 
and the strata that form the basis of all our mountains or hills is 
granite or syenite. Geologists contend that granite is never stra- 
tified. Galloway granite, however, is frequently found stratified; 
and in this parish the stratification is most distinct. When the 
granite is found in beds, it is perpendicular. In a troubled state, 
it has considerable dip, and scarcely any appearance of stratifica- 
tion. In the quarry, the strata vary in thickness from six inches 
to five feet and as they appear on the surface, they generally re- 
tain the same thickness below. This fact may be of great use in 
searching for granite of any particular dimensions ; because, if the 
tops are bad, as the quarry-men say, it is of no use to seek for 
good stuff below. §

The alluvial deposits 'covering the solid rocks of granite are 
principally gravel and boulders, which are dispersed over the pa- 
rish in great numbers. 

This quarry is worthy of the inspection of geologists. 

Lead has been discovered in different parts of the parish, par- 
ticularly at Blair-wood, Drumore, Glen, and Mark; and fine 
specimens of pure galena have been found in Monnipool. A 
copper mine was opened lately at Craigneuk, but did not succeed. 
Appearances of copper are also occasionally to be found in the 
quarry. 

Zoology. — There are no rare species of animals to be found at 
present in the parish ; but, from organic remains, of a peculiar 
formation and great size, occasionally found in the Cree, as well 
as from antlers of very large dimensions, there can be no doubt 
that animals of different kinds formerly existed in this district, 
which have long ago disappeared. 

In 1684, Symson says, that the farmers of Galloway did not 
kill any of their calves ; and veal was only seen at the tables of a 
few gentlemen. And as their wealth consisted chiefly in cattle, 
they thought it very ill husbandry to sell for a shilling what in 
three years would bring them twenty shillings. The price of Gal- 
loway cattle has risen very much since Symson's time. In 1794, 
the three-year-olds sold at L.7 ; and, in 1807, at L.IO. In 1814, 
two-year-olds were as high as L.IO, and three-year-olds, L.14. 
And in 1839, prices were, in some cases, even higher. Of course, 
in the interval of these dates, many changes have taken place, and 
prices have been occasionally very low. 

This parish cannot, perhaps, claim any pre-eminence in the breed- 
ing of cattle, although some of the farmers have excellent stocks 
of pure " Galloways." There are also some good Ayrshire cows, 
which have of late been increasing. At Cassencarrie, Muirfad, 
and Glen, there are now pretty extensive dairies, conducted upon 
the Ayrshire plan. 

There are a few cattle in the parish of a mixed breed, consist- 
ing of crosses between the Ayrshire, Galloway, and Irish. 

Mr M'Lean estimated that there would be 1600 black cattle 
in the parish in 1794. This number could not even now be well 
wintered, but many more might be grazed in summer. 

The native sheep of Galloway was a small handsome white-faced

so well as the softer and inore manageable sandstone." It is the ver reverse with 
Galloway granite.

breed with very fine wool. It was compared by Lithgow the tra- 
veller, who walked over this country in 1628, to that of Spain 
This breed has long ago disappeared. The hills are now stocked 
with small black-faced sheep; and Chalmers, in his Caledonia, 
states that it has not been ascertained whence this hardy breed 
came. It is the practice here to keep what is called a running 
stock, which is sold in regular rotation. Perhaps a well-selected 
ewe stock would be an improvement, with a little more attention to 
horns and wool. It was estimated that, in 1794, there were 7500 
black-faced and 300 white-faced sheep in the parish. There are 
now fewer black-faced and more white-faced ; of the former there 
may be about 7000, and of the latter 800. 

The horses of Galloway are as celebrated as its sheep. They 
are undoubtedly the descendants of the native breed, whatever 
may be said of the Spanish Armada having left upon the Gal- 
loway shore some sheep and horses when the Spanish ships 
were wrecked. Camden, who published his Britannia in 1586, 
describes the Galloway horses by their good qualities, be- 
fore the Armada was heard of. And Galloway horses were 
well known in Shakspeare's days, who makes Pistol exclaim when 
insulted by Doll, " Know we not Galloway naggs." Lithgow, 
who had visited many countries, says, in 1628, that Galloway 
abounds with little horses, which for mettle and riding may rather 
be termed bastard barbs. These useful horses continued to be 
exported from Galloway in great numbers in 1684. This admi- 
rable breed has by neglect been allowed to degenerate, and it is 
difficult now to find a genuine Galloway pony. It would scarcely 
be safe to state, that there is one of the pure breed in this parish. 
There are, however, some excellent draught horses, particularly 
at Spittal, Cuil, the Quarry, &amp;c. ; and Mr M'Culloch of Bar- 
holm has long been in the habit of breeding ponies of a small size 
and very handsome, which, for mettle, may be as good as those of 
which Lithgow wrote. The young horses bred in the parish are 
generally bought up by the dealers for the Glasgow market ; and 
the demand for horses of a large size has induced the farmers to 
pay more attention to bulk than beauty. This is much to be re- 
gretted, because the pasture in general is not fit to rear horses of 
a large size ; and besides, a horse of fifteen hands, of good pro- 
portions, is much more useful for all the purposes of husbandry 
in this part of the country. In 1794 it was estimated there were

200 horses in the parish. There may now be 300, all ages in- 
cluded. 

Swine undoubtedly once ran wild in the woodlands of Galloway, 
and many were reared in this district during the middle ages. Of 
this there are many intimations in the charters of the twelfth and 
thirteenth centuries. Swine were even paid as can to the King 
from Galloway. This practice has of course been long ago abo- 
lished, but Galloway still maintains its reputation for breeding 
swine. In this parish there are a great many reared for the New- 
ton-Stewart, Castle- Douglas, and Dumfries markets. Some of 
the old residenters still retain the wild breed, but in general those 
of a larger size are reared. Those from twelve to eighteen stone 
are found to take the market best, and will bring at present 5s. 
per stone of 14 pounds. 

In the old Statistical Account it is estimated that there were, 
in 1794, 500 goats in the parish. There is now not half that 
number, although there are still a few upon Drumore, Larg, &amp;c. ; 
and in Creetown a few families keep them for the sake of their 
milk, which is both wholesome and nutritious. 

Ichthyology. — The prejudices of the Celtic people did not al- 
low them to apply to the waters for their subsistence from fishery, 
and neither in Ireland nor in Galloway have the inhabitants ever 
profited as much as they might have done, from the fish which 
abound upon their shores and in their rivers. Yet Camden 
speaks at the beginning of the seventeenth century, as if the Gal- 
loway men practised the art of catching fish in the sea, as well as 
in the lakes and rivulets, and he specifies the incredible number 
of eels which they took in their creels.f Yet, says Chalmers, no 
professed fishers have ever settled along the shores of the Solway. 
The fishing of the Stewartry in the sea has been carried on hi- 
therto in a desultory manner. There is now a considerable change 
for the better in this respect. Deep sea fishing is practised 
upon our shores, and it is hoped that the success which has at- 
tended the experiments which have been recently made at Kirk- 
dale, &amp;c. will stimulate both proprietors and tacksmen to still 
greater exertion to procure for the use of man a much larger share 
of the treasures of the deep. 

There is a great variety of fish in the Bay of Wigton and in 
the Cree. The following is a list of those known to and found by 
the fishermen, viz. salmon, sea trout, herling, cod, herring, spur-

lings, soles, flounders, plaice and dab, gray and red gurnard, tur- 
bot, mackerel, sturgeon, chad, blockan brain, John Dorey, skate, 
conger, sea devil, jackalator or ink fish, lamprey eel, silver or 
horn eel, whiting, mullet, porpoises, hen or lump fish, shrimps, 
lobsters, crabs, oysters, mussels, cockles, periwinkles, sprats, lim- 
pets. There was even a young whale killed opposite Sutor Croft 
with an axe, about thirty years ago. 

The fresh water fish are trout, par, and eel. Some of the fish 
mentioned in this list are scarce in the bay ; fortunately, however, 
those most useful are in greatest abundance ; such as salmon, sea 
trout, spurling, flounders, &amp;c. These abound in the bay and in 
the Cree, and are caught in great quantities in their proper sea- 
sons ; and a great proportion of the salmon and spurling are sent 
to Carlisle, Liverpool, and Manchester. The spurling is so 
highly prized in Liverpool and Manchester that the fishermen now 
receive Is. per pound for all they can send, instead of 4d., the 
price formerly obtained in this district. This must now be a con- 
siderable source of gain to the fishermen, as spurlings can be ob- 
tained almost at any season of the year, although they are in ge- 
neral most abundant in March. The salmon fishing season opens 
here on the 1st January and closes on the 25th September. 

Conchology. — There is a great abundance, and a considerable 
variety of shells upon the coast. Upon the beach from Creetown 
to Carsluth, there is an immense number of univalves and bi- 
valves. From Carsluth to Ravenshall there is found among the 
rugged rocks another description of shells, principally of the class 
univalves, but of different orders and famihes. What is perhaps 
of greater practical importance to notice under this head, is the 
vast quantities of shells that have been found upon the shore and 
neighbouring fields. The holms.of Cassencarrie, the low lands of 
the glebe, and Kirkbride and Kirkdale, were at one time covered 
with shells from four to ten feet deep ; and as these must have been 
thrown out and left by the tide, it is evident that the tide must at 
onetime have risen at least fifteen feet higher upon this, coast 
than it has done for many years. 

The old Statistical Account takes particular notice of these 
shell banks for agricultural purposes, in the following terms : The 
principal manure used for improving land is sea-shells, of which 
there is an almost inexhaustible quantity, not only within the high 
water mark on this side of Wigton Bay, but also in the dry land, 
several hundred yards from the shore, particularly in the holms of 

KIRKCUDBUIGHT. X 



322 



KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE. 



Cassencarrie, where they are in beds from four to ten feet of the finest 
shells imaginable, without almost any mixture of sand. These shells 
are generally sold by the agents of Mr M'Kenzie at 5d. per ton, 
25 tons of which are sufficient for an acre of land, and prove a 
cheap and excellent manure to this part of the country, and are 
considered much preferable to either lime or marl. But the ad- 
vantages of this valuable treasure of shells is not confined to this 
part of the country alone, but extends round fifty or sixty miles of 
a coast as far as the Mull of Galloway, where they are sold as 
high as 3s. 6d. per ton. Many thousand tons of these shells are 
carried off annually by a number of vessels from twenty to sixty 
tons burthen, which are constantly employed, when the weather will 
permit, in carrying them all round the coast, and sometimes even 
to the Isle of Man. These shells have been used with great ad- 
vantage for the improvement of barren heathy land, in so much 
that many hundreds of acres in this parish originally not worth 
more than 2s. per acre, have been made worth from 10s. to 15s. 
per acre. 

These shell-banks, deemed at one time inexhaustible, have been 
greatly reduced. There is still a considerable quantity remaining, 
which might be profitably employed in reclaiming the waste land 
of the parish. The farmers do not seem to appreciate this trea- 
sure sufficiently, as shells are now but seldom used as a manure. 

Botany— \n this parish, there is much to interest the botanist. 
Plants, indigenous to some of the highest mountains in Scotland, 
to some of the richest glens, and also to the sea coast, are to be 
found in considerable abundance. The maritime plants are prin- 
cipally found on the south coast,and are such as the following :— 
Scilla verna two or three var., ser TripoUum, Senecio sarace- 
rdcus, Inula erithmoides, Iris Pseud- Jcorus, Botrychium Lunaria 
very rare. 

Those found in sheltered glens or well-cultivated districts are, 
Evpatorium camiabinum, Galantlms nivalis in greatest abundance, 
Ornithogalum luteum, Convallaria majalis, C. multijlora. 

There is a high and steep bank, stretching from the village of 
Creetown, a considerable way beyond the manse, literally studded 
with plants of this description. In the month of April, this bank 
is covered with one dense sheet of white, consisting of Anemone 
nemorosa and Oxalis Ace.tosella, which give way to all the beauti- 
ful varieties of Hyacintlius non-scriptus. At the bottom of this 
bank, there is a very considerable number of the family Orchidca, 



KIllKMAURUCK. 



323 



such as Orchis maculata, 0. latifoUa, Gymnadenia conopsea, Ha- 
bcnaria hifolia H. viridis. 

The alpine plants, which are by far the most numerous, em- 
brace several species of the genera Sedum and Saxifraga, parti- 
cularly Saxifraga oppositifolia ; all the native heaths— C«//w«a 
vulgaris Erica Tetralix, E. ciliaris, as well as Vaccinium Oxy 
coccos. 

There is a very great variety of the class Cryptogamia, mosses, 
lichens, and particularly ferns, growing in richest luxuriance on the 
mountainous districts of this parish, and some even of the rarer 
kinds. Behind the manse there are beautiful specimens of Poly- 
podium vulgare, P. Phegopieris, Scolopendrium vulgare. And on 
the old church, and wall round the old church, there are, AspU- 
nium Ruta-muraria, A. Adiantum- nigrum. 

Forests or Plantations. — There are cpnsiderable forests of na- 
tural wood in this parish, especially upon the banks of Kirkdale 
and Cassencarrie. These forests extend for several miles, and 
are principally composed of oak and ash, and are cut down at the 
end of every twenty- five or thirty years. At Cassencarrie there 
is a row of fine old sycamores ; and, at the south end of the house, 
there is a cedar of Lebanon of a large size. There are a few fine 
old oak trees at Kirkbride ; but these, although of a large size, are 
small when compared with some that have been found in the Cree. 
Mr M'Culloch of Barholm raised one from the bed of the river, 
a fevy years ago, which measured about 5 feet in diameter, and 
about 50 feet in length, and which he eold to Mr Younghusband 
of Whitehaven, for ship-building, at L.25. It is supposed that 
there are some even larger than this in the river ; but, from the 
difficulty of raising them, they have hitherto been left undisturbed. 
At what period these immense trees had grown, or when they 
were swept into the river, cannot now be known. It must have 
been, however, at some very remote period. And it is difficult to 
account for their size, seeing there is now nothing approaching 
their dimensions growing in the neighbourhood.

Parochial Registers.— There are three volumes of parish registers. 
The first volume embraces the time that elapsed between 1703 and 
1792. From 1703 to 1739, they have been kept with great regula- 
rity; from 1740 to 1756, no entry whatever; 1756 to 1792, kept im- 
perfectly. Some of the intermediate years have no entry, others only 
one; but towards the middle, and onwards to about the end of the 
above period, they were kept with great regularity. These records 
are almost solely confined to sessional matters, consisting of dry but 
succinct details, with little that is interesting to relieve the outline. 
The following, however, may be cited as a fine instance of the at- 
tachment which existed to our national church at the time the cir- 
cumstance alluded to took place, and which, as the spirit that 
prompted the gift is now unfortunately somewhat antiquated, we 
present in its antiquated dress.

The second volume of the parish register commenced with May 
1823, and is carried on with great regularity till May 1834, — 
though in one instance it is rather mutilated. 

The third volume begins June 1834, and is carried on to the

Eminent Characters. — The history of this parish is rendered 
more interesting by being connected with the names of a few emi- 
nent men, both in ancient and modern times. Gilbert Brown, 
the last abbot of Sweatheart, was descended of the ancient 
family of Carsluth, in this parish, now extinct. He had a 
seat in that Parliament by which the Confession of Faith was 
passed.f The celebrity of Gilbert Brown originated in the 
controversy between him and the famous John Welsh of Ayr, on 
the subject of Popery. A communication from Welsh, to a per- 
son of the Catholic religion, the object of which was to under- 
mine the principles of that faith, having fallen into the hands of 
Brown, he immediately composed what he regarded as a refuta- 
tion of it, addressed to Welsh. Welsh was not tardy in making 
a reply, which, while it is extremely satisfactory and conclusive, 
forms one of the most learned and elaborate works written in that 
age. Nor was Brown without his share of talent; and his erudite 
treatise, if a few pages can deserve that name, is as superior to 
the works of any of his Catholic brethren of that period, as it is 
inferior in every useful quality to the elaborate production of 
Welsh. Welsh wished for a verbal and public disputation on the 
points at issue, but this Brown, for his own good name, had the 
caution and prudence to decline. 

Brown, a rigid and inflexible Catholic, was, says Dr M'Crie, " a 
busy trafficker for Rome and Spain, and a chief instrument of 
keeping the south of Scotland under ignorance and superstition."| 
Accordingly the Commissioners of the Assembly, in a list of griev- 
ances, which, in 1596, they submitted to the King, stated among 
other things, " that Jesuits and excommunicated Papists were en- 
tertained within the country." Gilbert Brown of New Abbey 
was specially mentioned, and recommended to be apprehended, 
and brought before his Majesty for his errors. This recommen- 
dation, however, was not attended with immediate success; but, 
nine years afterwards, he was apprehended by Lord Cranstoun,

captain of the guard appointed for the Borders —though not 
without some difficulty, as the people attempted to rescue him out 
of his hands  He was first confined in Blackness, and thence, in 
a few days, conveyed to the castle of Edinburgh. More kindness 
was shown by the King to him than to his amiable and mgenious 
opponent ; for after having been liberally entertained, while in 
confinement, at the public expense, he was permitted to leave 
the kingdom ; all the apparatus and insignia of Popery belonging 
to him having been carefully restored before his departure. He 
died in France in 16l2.t 

This parish also contained, in the days of persecution, some who 
were counted worthy and were found willing to suffer for Christ's sake. 
Of these, the names of Major M'CuUoch of Barholm, and the Rev. 
Patrick Peacock of Kirkmabreck, ought to be held in grateful re- 
membrance. Major M'Culloch, who had been fined L.800 by Mid- 
dleton's Parliament in 1662, for his non-conformity, suffered mar- 
tyrdom at Edinburgh on the 7th of December 1666, for being pre- 
sent at the battle of Pentland, where he was taken prisoner ; and the 
Privy Council ordained his head and right hand to be cut off ; the 
former to be stuck up on the market-cross of Kirkcudbright, — the 
latter, on that of Ayr or Lanark, because it was there the Cove- 
nant was renewed with uplifted hands. Major M'Culloch suffered 
much before the insurrection. Soldiers were quartered on him 
thirty days at a time, which he had not only to keep, but to pay ; 
and, after his execution, his son was seized and imprisoned for 
a whole year. The Barholm estate was forfeited, and con- 
tinued under forfeiture till the Revolution. In the same year, 
1666, " some few families" in Kirkmabreck were fined in 
the aggregate sum of L.563, 6s. Scots. Mr Peacock, minister of 
the parish, was ejected, along with nearly a third of the Presbyte- 
rian ministers, from his living, in 1662. He was afterwards or- 
dered to be confined within the parish of Ochiltree in Ayrshire. 
He subsequently took refuge in the north of Ireland, but return- 
ed to Kirkmabreck at the Revolution in 1689, and continued mi- 
nister of the parish till his death in 1691. | 

The famous Samuel Rutherford officiated frequently in this pa- 
rish during his incumbency at Anwoth. He was settled in An- 
woth in 1627. Till this date, Anwoth, Kirkdale, and Kirkma- 
breck had been as one parish. Indeed, if the authorities I have

consulted, and which I have ah-eady quoted, be correct, this union 
was not dissolved till 1636, and not ratified by Parliament till 
1641. In this case, Anvvoth could only have been a separate pa- 
rish quoad sacra, during Rutherford's incumbency, — and must 
still have been a part of Kirkdale and Kirkmabreck quoad civilia. 
The Rev. William Dalgleish was minister of the united parish of 
Kirkmabreck, Kirkdale, and Anwoth, till the appointment of Ru- 
therford to Anwoth ;— afterwards he continued minister of Kirk- 
mabreck and Kirkdale till 1635, when he was deprived of his liv- 
ing by the bishop of the diocese. In 1637, he ventured to return 
to his flock, as Episcopacy began in that year to totter; and in 1638, 
he was a member of the famous General Assembly of Glasgow, as 
minister of Kirkmabreck. In 1639, he was translated to Cramond, 
near Edinburgh ; but was deposed for non-conformity in 1662. 
He continued, under all circumstances, the friend and correspon- 
dent of Rutherford. In November 1686, Renwick received in 
this parish the famous protestation of Machutchison and others. 
And it is a singular fact, which I state on the authority of the 
present Mr M'Culloch of Barholm, that John Knox had his 
hiding-place in the old tower of Barholm for some time pre- 
vious to his escape to the continent. This circumstance Mr 
M'Culloch learned from an old man of the name of Andrew 
Hughan, who was running footman to Mr M'CuUoch's great great 
grandfather, and who said that he recollected John Knox's signa- 
ture on the wall of the small arched apartment or bed-room at the 
head of the staircase. 

This parish has also the honour of being the birth-place and 
burial-place of Dr Thomas Brown, Professor of Moral Philosophy 
in the University of Edinburgh. This distinguished individual 
was born in the old part of the present manse on the 9th January 
1778. His father and grandfather were ministers of this parish. 
His grandfather was proprietor of Barharrow, and was married to 
a daughter of Murdoch of Cumloddan, a family that had been in 
possession of that estate from the time of Robert Bruce. His 
father was married to a daughter of John Smith, Esq. of the Cus- 
toms, Wigtown ; and his grandmother, Mrs Smith, was a daughter 
of a younger son of MDowal of Logan and of Miss Hamilton of 
Dalziel. f 

Dr Brown was the youngest of thirteen children. His father

died about eighteen months after he was born ; but his mother 
survived her husband nearly forty years, and had the happiness of 
seeino- her son attain to honour and favour, She did not leave 
the manse till about a year after her widowhood, when she re- 
moved with her family to Edinburgh, where she continued to re- 
side. Thomas here remained for some years under the charge 
of his widowed mother, a person of great worth. By her he was 
taught the elements of learning at a singularly early age, acquir- 
ing the whole alphabet, it is said, at one lesson, and every thing 
else to which his attention was directed with the same amazing 
facility. When between four and five years of age, he was able 
to read the Scriptures, and also, it would appear, partly to under- 
stand them. One day at that period of his life, he was found 
sitting on the floor of his mother's parlour, with a large family 
Bible on his knee, which he was dividing into different parts with 
his hand. Being asked jocularly if he intended to preach, and 
was now choosing a text, he said, " No, I am only wishing to see 
what the Evangelists differ in, for they do not all give the same 
account of Christ." From the kindly tutelage of his mother he 
was removed in the seventh year of his age, and placed by his 
maternal uncle. Captain Smith, in a school at Camberwell, from 
which, in a short time, he was transferred to one at Cheswick, 
where he continued for some years. In these and two other aca- 
demies he spent the years between seven and fourteen, and ac- 
quired an elegant classical education. In 1792, he returned to 
his maternal roof at Edinburgh, and commenced a course of at- 
tendance at the university. At this early period of his life he 
was deeply read in the English classics, and had even collected a 
considerable library, which unfortunately was lost at sea in its 
passage from England to Scotland. At the university he was a 
most distinguished student, especially in ethics. Dr Welsh, the 
accomplished biographer of Dr Brown, informs us, that the varied 
and profound acquirements of this extraordinary young man soon 
attracted to him the attention and friendship of many other per- 
sonages distinguished by academic rank and literary reputation, 
especially Professors Robison, Playfair, and Black, and Messrs 
Horner, Leyden, Reddie, and Erskine. Ere he had completed 
his twentieth year, he wrote " Observations upon Dr Darwin's 
Zoonomia," which obtained for him the highest praise. Dr Welsh 
justly characterizes it as one of the most remarkable exemplifica- 
tions of premature intellect which has ever been exhibited, and

as containing the germs of all his philosophy. Dr Brown ob- 
tained his degree of M. D. in 1803, on which occasion he was 
honoured with the highest encomiums of Dr Gregory. In the 
winter of 1808-9, he taught the moral philosophy class for Pro- 
fessor Stewart with wonderful success, — not only the students, 
but distinguished members of the bench, of the bar, and of the 
pulpit, were daily present to witness the powers of this rising phi- 
losopher. In 1810, he was appointed Professor Stewart's col- 
league in the chair of moral philosophy, which he filled with the 
highest honour to himself. In 1814, he published a poem en- 
titled " The Paradise of Coquettes." In 1815, he published 
another, under the title of the " Wanderer in Norway." In 
1816, the " War Fiend." In 1818, he published a poetical tale, 
entitled " Agnes." In 1819, " Emily." But his reputation in 
this walk of literature was not equal to his fame as a philosopher. 
In 1819, his health, which was never very good, became so pre- 
carious, and the symptoms of his disease so alarming, that, early 
in the session of 1819-20, he was obliged to appoint a substitute 
to deliver his lectures. At the recommendation of his physicians, 
he took a voyage to London, and established himself at Bromp- 
ton. Here he gradually grew weaker until the 2d of April 1820, 
when he gently breathed his last. His remains were put into a 
leaden coffin, and, according to his own wish, were laid beside 
those of his father and mother in the churchyard of Kirkma- 
breck. 

Dr Brown's Lectures on Moral Philosophy were published 
after his death in four volumes, 8vo, and have deservedly obtained 
the highest reputation, j An admirable account of his life and 
writings has been published in one volume, 8vo, by the Rev. Dr 
Welsh, Professor of Church History in the University of Edin- 
burgh. The biography of Dr Brown also holds a prominent place 
in the able and elaborate work of Dr Murray on the Literary 
History of Galloway. It has also found a place in Chambers's 
Scottish Biography. Dr Chalmers has also done homage to the 
transcendant genius of Dr Brown in his Bridgewater Treatise ; 
and Sir James Mackintosh, in his masterly Dissertation on the His- 
tory of Metaphysical Science, pays honour both to the head and 
heart of Dr Brown. " His mind," says he, « soared and roamed

and, so far as I know, without a parallel in this country."— Dr Murray.

Uirongh every region of philosophy and poetry, but his untravelled 
heart clung to the hearth of his fathers." 

Dr Brosvn, as I have already stated, was born in the manse and 
buried in the churchyard of Kirkmabreck, " in the tomb of his 
fathers." A handsome granite pillar has been erected over his 
grave, by his only surviving sister. A public monument has long 
been talked of. A number of subscriptions have already been 
obtained ; and it is hoped that the day is at hand when justice 
shall be done to the memory of one whose fame is as wide as the 
range of metaphysical science ; and having thus erected a monu- 
ment to his country/, it is not too much to expect that his country 
should now erect a monument to him. 

Samuel Douglas, the founder of " the Douglas Academy" at 
Newton- Stewart, was born in this parish. Mr Douglas bequeathed 
about L. 17,000, to build and endow this academy, for the benefit 
of Kirkmabreck and Newton- Stewart, and appointed the minister 
of Penninghame and his three senior elders, and the minister of 
Kirkmabreck and his three senior elders, as trustees over the in- 
stitution in all time to come. 

Several individuals who have risen to affluence and honour in 
the walks of commerce were also born in this parish. Amongst 
these the names of the late Mr Hughan of Airds, and Mr Kerr 
of Argrennan, may be mentioned. 

Antiquities. — There are a number of circles of large standing- 
stones in this parish, such as those supposed by some to be the 
remains of Druidic temples, by others, courts of justice, and by 
not a few, the rude memorials of a battle-field, intended to mark 
the spot where the slain had fallen and been buried. There is 
another conjecture concerning some of them, which, although less 
romantic, and less interesting to the antiquarian, may also be given. 
In this as well as in many parishes of Galloway, there were, in 
olden times, almost no fences. Sheep and cattle were on this ac- 
count more liable to stray from their own pasture. It was com- 
mon, therefore, to have enclosures or ponds, into which strayed 
cattle were put or ponded, till their owners found it convenient to 
send for them. These enclosures were generally of stone, and 
contained plenty of water for the use of the cattle when shut up. 
As fences became more abundant, these ponds became less neces- 
sary, and gradually fell into disuse ; the ruins of which are still to 
be found in this as well as in many other parishes of Scotland. 
These ruins are sometimes so far obliterated, as to render it diffi-

cult to trace their outline, or to tell what purpose they had once 
served. 

At Claens Mid-Spittal there are several traces of some ancient 
building, most probably an hospital, — Spittal being an abridge- 
ment of this name. Mr Burnie, a few years ago, in his farming 
operations near Claens, got the remains of some old windows, with 
leaden frames, with scarcely two panes of the same size, and a 
quantity of human bones. It appears also, from the ruins of an 
old dike, as if a few acres of land had at one time been enclosed 
here. These things strengthen the supposition, that, at some early 
period, an hospital had been erected here, and that the dead had 
been buried within this enclosure. 

In Cambret Moor, in the days of Symson, there was a stone of 
four or five feet in diameter, called " the Penny Stone," under 
which money was supposed to have been concealed. This stone 
had upon it the resemblance of that draught which is commonly 
called the walls of Troy. It is to be feared some avaricious per- 
son has destroyed this stone, in the hope of finding the hidden 
treasure, because it is not now to be found. 

In the south-east district of the parish, there was anciently a 
chapel, dedicated to Saint Briget, and named Kilbride. It stood 
near the shore of Wigtown Bay, not far from the farm of Cars- 
luth, where a hamlet still bears the name of Kirkbride, Of this 
chapel, like the statue formerly referred to, there is now no trace, 
and no tradition. 

About the year 1809 Mr M'Lean of Mark, while improving a 
field in the moor of Glenquicken in Kirkmabreck parish, found it 
necessary to remove a large cairn, which is said by tradition to have 
been the tomb of a king of Scotland, who is not in the genuine 
series, Aldus M'Galdus, M'Gillus, or M'Gill. When the cairn 
had been removed the workmen came to a stone coffin, of very 
rude workmanship ; and, on removing the lid, they found the ske- 
leton of a man of uncommon size. The bones were in such a 
state of decomposition, that the ribs and vertebrae crumbled into 
dust on attempting to lift them. The remaining bones being more 
compact, were taken out, when it was discovered that one of the 
arms had been almost separated from the shoulder by the stroke 
of a stone axe, and that a fragment of the axe still remained in 
the bone. The axe had been of green stone, a species of stone 
never found in this part of Scotland. There was also found with 
this skeleton a ball of flint about three inches in diameter, which 
was perfectly round, and highly polished, and the head of an ar- 



KIUKMABRECK.

row, that was also of flint, but not a particle of any metallic sub- 
stance was found.  

About the year 1778, in removing a quantity of stones for build- 
ing dikes from a large tumulus in Glenquicken Moor, there was 
found a stone coffin, containing a human skeleton, which was 
greatly above the ordinary size. There was also found in this 
sepulchral monument an urn containing ashes, and an earthen 
pitcher. The urn seems to evince the antiquity of this tumulus, 
when the British practised funeral cremation. This tumulus is 
called Cairny wanie. f Thus we have an account of two skeletons 
of very large size, found in Glenquicken Moor at different times. 
These facts seem to confirm the tradition that a battle had taken 
place here at some very remote period. History informs us of a 
battle having been fought on the river Cree, about the year a. d. 
310, wherein the Picts joined the Romans under Maximus their 
general, against the Scots under their King Eugenius, but where- 
in the Scots were overthrown.;}: Whether this conflict took place 
on Glenquicken Moor or not, it seems difficult to determine. 

But the most memorable place of antiquity in the parish is call- 
ed Cairnholy. The tumulus of this name, when opened up many 
years ago,§ was found to contain a large kistvaen of flat stones. 
The upper stone is so large, that curiosity has not yet removed it, 
to discover the contents below. On each side of this tomb, at the 
distance of 100 yards, there are the marks of many graves, and 
at most of these were placed rude stones of memorial, in the up- 
right manner of the common grave-stones. It is to be regretted 
that some of these have been removed, and that others are in a 
state of dilapidation. The history of this holy cairn is involved 
in much obscurity. King Galdus, who is supposed to have given 
his own name to Galloway, is said to be here inhumed. This is 
no doubt the fabulous Corbredus Galdus of Boece and Buchanan, 
who, according to their fictions, opposed Agricola in arms. Ad- 
mitting, however, the existence of King Galdus, and that he was 
slain in battle in Galloway, it is not probable that he was buried 
at Cairnholy. It is more probable that he was buried in Torhouse 
Moor, in the parish of Wigtown, where there is a monument of three 
large whinstones, called King Galdus's Tomb. This opinion has 
obtained the sanction of the celebrated antiquarian, Sir Robert 

 Captain Dennistoti's Letter to Mr Train of Newton-Stewart, dated 22d October 
1819.

Sibbald, and of Timothy Pont. Although Buchanan says that 
King Galdus died a natural death after a glorious reign of thirty- 
five years. 

There is another account given of this cairn which we submit. 
About the year 1150, three years before the demise of David I., 
it is said there was a battle fought on Glenquicken Moor, between 
the English and Scots, wherein the Scots were defeated and 
their general killed, — when the Bishop of Whithorn assumed 
the command ; but his troops being defeated, immediately fled to- 
wards the shore to their boats, and being overtaken by the enemy 
at Cairnholy, the bishop, and 'many of his men, were slain and 
buried. From this circumstance, it was called the Holy Cairn. 
This supposition is apparently strengthened from the fact, that there 
is a little rivulet or burn, that runs through the place where the 
battle is said to have been fought, that still retains the name of 
the Eno'lishman's burn.f Chalmers, however, in his Caledonia, 
says, that there was no such battle fought between the Scots and 
English on Glenquicken Moor in 1 150. Thus we are compelled 
to leave the history of Cairnholy in the same state of mystery in 
which we found it. 

Mansion- Houses. — The principal mansion-houses in the parish 
are, Kirkdale House, Barholm House, Hill House, and Cassen- 



carne. 



Kirkdale House, the seat of Miss Hannay, is a magni- 
' ficent building of the Grecian order of architecture, from the 
design of Mr Adam. It is wholly built of beautiful polished 
granite of exquisite workmanship ; and, until the late re- 
pairs upon the princely mansion of Mr Murray of Cally, M. P., 
it was without a rival in Galloway. It is stated in the old Sta- 
tistical Account that the Bishop of Derry, on seeing the house of 
the late Sir S. Hannay, was so much charmed with the stone, that 
he immediately contracted with the superintendent of that work 
for the building of the spires of two churches in his diocese, which 
were all to be executed with this stone. The situation is even 
worthy of the building. The scenery around is of the finest de- 
scription, combining the charms of the lovely, the picturesque, and 
the romantic. Altogether the house and views of Kirkdale ought 
to hold a high place among the beauties of Scotland. The views 
from Kirkdale House are singularly striking and beautiful in moon-

ni. — Population. 
The population of this parish has increased slowly but gradu- 
ally for many years. In Dr Webster's list in 1755 the numbers 
were rated at 858. In the year 1764 the whole population amount- 
ed to only 680 ; of which the Ferry- Town of Cree, now Creetown, 
contained 104. The landward part of the parish has altered very 
little in point of population since that period. The principal in- 
crease has been in Creetown, and the following table will show the 
increase at different times : —

The population has increased considerably since 1831, in con- 
sequence of the Liverpool Dock Company having opened a very 
large granite quarry in this parish, at which they have from 60 to 
430 men occasionally employed. From this statement it must 
appear that the population has been very fluctuating since the 
commencement of the quarry. In 1834, when the greatest num- 
ber of workmen was employed, the population was as high as 2300. 

Character, 8fc. of the People. — In general the people of this 
parish are industrious, intelligent, and sober. Many of them very 
correct in their morals and sound in their religious principles. 
The inhabitants are healthy and peaceable, and, as a proof of their 
sobriety, it may be mentioned that there is a Tee Total Society 
in Creetown with upwards of .300 members. 

Poaching and smuggling were at one time but too common. 
The former is now little followed, and the latter is entirely un- 
known. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — 

Number of acres imperial that have been cultivated, about .5300 

of meadow, about . 900 

Land that has never been cultivated, quantity unknown. 

• These quantities are partly conjectural, the whole parish never 
having been accurately measured, so far as I know. With regard 
to the number of acres that might, with a profitable application of 
capital, be added to the cultivated land of the parish, there may 
be a considerable difference of opinion. But I have no doubt, by 
the use of bone-dust upon the steep and dry land, and the intro- 
duction of tile-draining into the mossy and wet land, 1000 acres 
might be reclaimed with advantage. The practice of the Duke 
of Portland, in draining the land for his tenants, and charging them 
a certain percentage upon the money expended, would prodigiously 
improve the appearance and fertility of Galloway, and it would be 
good for the tenants in this parish if the practice of the Earl of 
Selkirk, in giving lime, were followed by our landlords. 

There is no land in this parish in a state of undivided common. 
There are about 1000 acres under wood, two-thirds of which may 
be natural, and one- third planted. Oak, ash, hazel, alder, and 
thorn, are indigenous ; and the trees that have been planted are 
in general a few of the most common varieties of the fir and oak, 
beech, sycamore, chestnut, and elm.

Tiie woods are in general judiciously managed ; thinning, prun- 
ing, and felling being all attended to in their proper seasons, and 
conducted according to the most approved methods. 

Rent. — The average rent of arable land per imperial acre may 
be about 15s. yearly. The average rent of grazing an ox or cow 
may be rated at L. 2, 15s. yearly. Black-faced sheep, on hill 
pasture, about L.4 per score ; white-faced, pastured on low land, 
according to the size, say about L.7, 10s. per score. 

Wages. — The rate of wages varies here as in other places; but, 
in general, common labourers receive Is. 6d. per day of ten hours; 
farm-servants about L.25 yearly, without victuals, or L.ll, 10s. 
with them; women servants, L.6 per annum, with victuals. Rate 
of wages for masons, carpenters, and smiths, from 2s. 6d. to 3s. 
per day. At the quarry, the wages are in general higher than 
these rates, both for labourers and artisans. A table of the rate 
of wages in this parish in the year 1794 is here subjoined: — Ma- 
sons and joiners, from Is. 8d. to 2s., without victuals; tailors and 
shoemakers, from 8d. to lOd., with victuals; an experienced man- 
servant, from L.8 to L.9 per annum ; women-servants, from L.3 
to L.4 per annum. 

The prices of produce are of course variable. In general they 
are regulated by the Dumfries and Liverpool markets. The ave- 
rage may be stated, for wheat, per imperial bushel, at 6s. 6d. ; of 
barley, 3s. 6d.; of oats, 2s. 4d. ; of potatoes, per bushel, lOd. ; of 
rye grass hay, 26 lb., 7d. ; black-faced wool, 6d. per lb. ; white- 
faced, Is. do. ; butter, lOd. per lb.; cheese, 6d. do.; eggs, 4d, to 
6d., seldom more. A good cart, L.S, 8s. ; an iron plough, L.4, 
lOs.; a double harrow, L.l, 15s.; a drill harrow, L.l, lOs Shoe- 
ing of a horse, 2s. 8d. Horses are cheap in this parish. A good 
sound young horse, fit for country work, may be had for L.l 6, 
and sometimes even less. Cattle have been high for the last three 
years. The best two-year-old Galloways have brought L.9 ; the 
best three-year-old, L.ll ; good Ayrshire cows, about L.ll. 

Livestock.'— i:\\e live-stock have already been described. Un- 
der this head it may merely be stated, that the sheep are in ge- 
neral black-faced, of a small size. The white-faced are Leicester 
and Cheviot, and crosses from these, &amp;c. The black-cattle are 
in general " pure Galloways." Ayrshire cows are increasing very 
much in this parish.  

Husbandry/.— -The system of husbandry in this parish is improving 
rapidly, by the introduction of bone dust and guano, by greater

attention to cleaning the land, and by following the most approved 
rotation of cropping. There are still a few who chng to the old 
system, and who would do well to imitate the example of their 
more enterprising neighbours. 

The rotation that is perhaps best adapted to this parish is, one 

grain crop a green crop — a grain crop — and the land sown down 

in rye grass and clover, not cut, but eaten on the ground, and to re- 
main in pasture alonger or shorter periodaccording to circumstances. 

Mr M'Lean of Mark, many years ago, received the Highland 
Society's medal for reclaiming waste land. Improvement in this 
vyay is still progressing, though slowly. Indeed, some of the te- 
nants have but little encouragement, being left to struggle with a 
heavy rent, a short lease, miserable houses, and wretched fences. 

Shelling land, which at one time was employed to a great ex- 
tent in this parish, is now bat little followed. There have been 
about fifteen acres of land reclaimed upon the Cassencarrie shore 
by an embankment of " rubbish" from the quarry, by the Liver- 
pool Dock Trustees. The land is rapidly rising by the deposit 
that is left by the ebbing and flowing of the tide, and the decom- 
position of the salt water, and will soon be a field of valuable pas- 
ture. There are many acres upon the shores of Kirkbride and 
the glebe capable of being reclaimed by warping, a system which 
has been Introduced by the Hon. Montgomery Stewart on the 
other side of the bay with great effect, and which is much cheaper 
than embanking. Indeed, by this process the land is gradually 
raised, and the tide is made to embank itself. 

Leases.— Theve are a great many tenants in this parish under 
yearly leases, a system which operates most powerfully agamst 
improvement. Others are more fortunate in having longer leases. 
They vary from three to nineteen years. There are a few old 
leases even much longer, although not liferents. Some of the 
old leases are upon very favourable terms to the occupant; but of 
late years the competition for farms has become so great, that, it 
is to be feared, in some of the new leases, the tenants are over- 
rented. This is an evil which will eventually cure itself, but for 
which, in the meantime, the tenants have themselves to blame. 
The farm-houses upon the Kirkdale ,property are in general good, 
and kept in excellent repair; and very neat and comfortable farm- 
houses have been lately built at Cuil, Carsewalloch, &amp;c. ; but 
upon several properties the houses are miserable. 

• This system was introduced by Mr Stewart on Lord Galloways property ;sc. 
vcral embankments have also been raised in the bay lately ; and it is expected that 
»nany hundreds of acres will soon be inclosed, and in valuable pasture.

There ave many obstacles to the improvement of hmd in this 
parish, and amongst these may be mentioned the high price of 
lime ; the want of capital in some cases, — the want of encourage- 
ment in others ; and, in too many, the want of houses and leases. 

Quarries and Mines. — There was a copper mine lately opened 
at Craigneuk, and a lead mine at Glen ; and at one time there 
was a trial made for lead at Blairs ; but none of them succeeded. 

" The Quarry" — There is a large granite quarry in this pa- 
rish, immediately behind the glebe. It was opened about ten years 
ago, by the Tnustees of the Liverpool Docks, for the purpose of 
procuring stones for the docks. The working of this quarry, in 
1834, cost nearly L. 15,000, including rent, and tonnage of vessels, 
&amp;c. At that time there were upwards of 450 men and boys em- 
ployed. There are only about 60 at present. This quarry is 
wrought in three breasts of about 30 feet high each, the one above 
and behind the other. The operations are conducted with much 
skill and regularity. At one time powder was very much employed 
in this work : 50, 60, and as high as 70 pounds were used in one 
blast. These explosions were felt and heard at a considerable 
distance, as the slight shocks of an earthquake. The use of pow- 
der, however, except in opening up corners, has been for some 
time entirely given up. Blasting was found to shake and frequent' 
ly to destroy some of the finest blocks. Drills, wedges, crowbars, 
sledge-hammers, and cranes, are now principally used in quarry- 
ing even the largest masses; and it is truly astonishing to see with 
what facility even mountains can be removed by handicraft. 

The modus operandi may be shortly described. In the quarry 
the rocks are stratified. The strata are perpendicular, and vary 
in thickness from nine inches to five feet. When a mass is to be 
separated, wedges are introduced between the strata, and are driven 
down with sledge-hammers until a separation is effected. A large 
crowbar, well manned, is then applied, to throw down the mass to 
the bottom of the quarry. This accomplished, the next thing is 
to cut up the stone into blocks as large as the materials will admit 
of. And this part of the work is perhaps the most interesting pro- 
cess of the whole. The rude and unshapely mass may be 5 feet 
thick, and 10 or 12 feet long, and must be cut into the form of a 
parallelogram, to fit with mathematical precision its own appoint- 
ed place in the docks. Holes are bored 4 or 5 inches deep, with 
a drill or jumper, and 8 or 9 inches apart, in the line the

stone is to be split. A block of 14 tons is soon cut to the size 
and shape required, by the power of the " plug and feather." As 
the " plug and feather" have extraordinary mechanical powers — 
are of great use in quarrying operations — and are rather a novelty 
"in these parts," a description of them may here be given. When 
a hole has been bored of the required depth, two wedges are in- 
troduced into the hole, with the thick end down, and a third is 
introduced between them, with the small end down, and by driv- 
ing the one in the centre, the combined power of three wedges is 
thus obtained, and made to bear upon every hole, and thus split the 
stone. A few holes charged with " plug and feather" will be found 
sufficient to split a very large stone. In splitting granite in this way, 
the quarrymen are careful to place the holes and the wedges parallel 
with the reed or grain of the stone. This arrangement renders 
the process comparatively easy ; and the skilful workmen can 
shape their blocks and paving-stones with as much comfort as if 
they were cutting wood in a saw-mill. As a proof of the extraor- 
dinary power of the " plug and feather," it may be stated, upon 
the authority of the present skilful overseer, that masses of 500 
tons are sometimes lifted or removed by their aid. The cranes, 
chains, rails, waggons, " braiks," employed about the quarry are 
all of the strongest description. There is one very fine traversing 
crane. There are several " inclines." The largest is upwards of 
800 yards, and rises about an angle of 40°. The railroad on this 
incline is double, so that the loaded waggons in going down the 
one road draw up the empty waggons on the other. 

Fisheries. — There are several fisheries in this parish upon the 
Cree, and in the bay, principally for salmon, spirlings, flounders, 
herring, &amp;c. ; and the nets employed for taking them are stake- 
nets, bag-nets, draught-nets, fish-yards, and half-nets. The rental 
of all the fisheries in the parish may be about L.lOO a-year. 

Manufactures. — Kelp was at one time manufactured in this 
parish, but is now given up. This, however, is not to be regret- 
ted, because the sea-weed may be turned to a much better ac- 
count in manuring the land. The tan-work, cotton factory, and 
mill for shot lead, mentioned in the old Statistical Account as 
having been in operation in Creetown in 1794, have long been 
given up. There is at present a small carpet manufactory near 
Creetown, which lately eniployed about thirty hands. In the 
meantime there is little doing. Prices have not been remunerat- 

• It was here the first patent shot was made.

ing. Men, women, and children employed at the mill generally 
work six days a-week, and twelve or thirteen hours each day, — 
certainly too long hours, especially for children, and must be inju- 
rious to their health. There are two saw mills and two grain mills 
in the parish. 

Navigation. — There is one smack belonging to Creetown of 47 
tons burthen. There are also several vessels, from 20 to 50 tons 
burthen, that frequent Palnure and Creetown ports. Besides 
these there are occasionally foreign vessels with tar and timber. 
We have also trading and coal vessels from Whitehaven ; and from 
one to eleven schooners have been regularly employed since the 
opening of the quarry in carrying granite to the Liverpool docks. 
Three schooners have been lost in the granite trade, and in two 
of them all hands perished. The Cree is the only river navigable 
in this parish, and is so as far as Carty. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Town. — The nearest market-town is Newton-Stewart, 
and is only six miles distant from Creetown. 

Villages.— Oi\ the Cree there was a considerable village in 
1300, when the English army rendezvoused here. It was then 
called Creth. It was afterwards called the Ferry Town of Cree, 
from a common passage over the river at this place, and more 
recently it obtained the present name of Creetown. It is pro- 
bable that the ancient village had long disappeared before the 
present one began, because it is statedf that Creetown was be- 
gun in 1785, and, in 1792, it consisted of 50 dwellings, and 50 
more were laid out. There are a few old houses in Creetown, 
which were built long before 1785. 

It was erected into a burgh of barony through the influence 
of John M'Culloch, Esq. of Barholm, on the 13th December 
1791, and registered at Edinburgh, •27th January 1792. One 
bailie and four councillors are elected triennially by the resident 
feuars according to the charter. About the year 1790, a small 
cotton manufactory was established, with a tan-yard, and a mill 
for making shot-lead. These have been discontinued for many 
years. The old shot-mill has been lately repaired and fitted up 
with machinery, for the purpose, it is supposed, of making potato- 
starch, &amp;c. The old cotton factory has been changed into a 
carpet manufactory, which has already been noticed under its 
proper head. A town hall and lock-up have lately been erected 
in Creetown, which have been found most useful.

The situation of Creetown is very picturesque. It is built be- 
tween two rivulets or burns and four bvidges. The gardens are 
so abundantly stocked with fruit-trees, that in spring, when the 
blossoms are exuberant, the village appears as if it had been built 
in an orchard. The scenery around is particularly beautiful. 
On the west lies the Bay of Wigton with its boats and smacks ; 
on the north, the tine plantations and mansion-house of Barholm ; 
and above and behind the village stands Hill House, begirt with 
ornamental trees ; and the new church, with its handsome tower 
and cathedral roof, — with the Larg hill and the woods of Cas- 
sencarrie — close in and enrich the landscape in the south. These 
beauties did not escape the observation of Mr M'Diarmid in his 
Sketches of Nature. He describes them with much of his charac- 
teristic humour and raciness, and numbers among the eccentrici- 
ties of our streets, the cherry-trees that adorn the walls of some 
of the houses, and the blacksmith's sign, who shod horses on the 
principles of expansion. The drive between Creetown and Gate- 
house is one of the finest in the south of Scotland. 

Post-Office. — There is a post-office in Creetown. The Irish 
mail comes in at 11 o'clock, p. m., and the Dumfries mail at "2 
o'clock, A. M. daily. Letters are delivered at the bouses of all 
within the burgh. 

Turnpike Roads— The length of the turnpike road that passes 
through this parish is nine miles. The road is remarkably well 
■kept and thoroughly Macadamized. The Dumfries and Port- 
patrick mail-coaches travel this road daily. There are also re- 
gular carriers to Newton- Stewart, Gatehouse, and Dumfries. 
The bridges are in good repair, and substantially built. There 
are no railroads in the parish, except at the Quarry. 

Fences. — The fences in this parish are in general built of stone. 
Some of them are Well built and in good repair, but too many of 
them are the very reverse. There are many specimens of both 
the single and double dike, five and six quarters high. There 
are few hedges, although thorns grow remarkably well, and would 
be a great ornament to the parish. Indeed there is a number of 
very fine old thorn trees in the parish, of a large size. One hundred 
years ago, there were few fences of any kind in this part of the 
country. Now they are very numerous, such as they are, and 
may measure not less than fifty miles in this parish. 

The Ifand is stony, and the general plan is to quarry he stones 
out of the field that is to be enclosed. This answers the double

purpose of clearing the ground and fencing it at the same time. 
A great deal more might be done in this way with advantage. 

Harbours.— At the " Point of Caskiel," there was a harbour 
built about ten years ago, by the Liverpool Dock Company, for 
the purpose of loading their schooners with granite. At Palnure 
a place has been Htted up for loading and unloading small vessels, 
but which is not worthy of the name of a harbour. At Creetown 
the vessels are moored upon the beach, no other accommodation 
having as yet been provided. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church is built upon the Clauchan 
Croft, near Creetown, and is very conveniently situated for the 
inhabitants of the village, although not particularly so for the 
landward part of the population. On the southern and eastern 
extremities of the parish, some of the people are six miles from 
church. 

The present church was opened for public worship on the 14th 
December 1834. It is in excellent repair, and was reckoned, at 
the time it was built, the handsomest church in Galloway. It is 
seated to hold about 800. The landward population have their 
sittings free. The inhabitants of Creetown have hitherto paid Is. 
each sitting yearly, which goes to the poor. Even this small 
charge will soon be abolished, and the Gospel will be preached to 
all " without money and without price." 

The following table contains a list, so far as can be ascertained, 
of the ministers of this parish since the Reformation :— John Mof- 
fet, 1535 to 1589; James Donaldson, 1597; John Kallen- 
der, 1601 to 1603 ; WilHam Dalgleish ; Samuel Row ; Patrick 

Peacock ; Andrew Naughley ; Shaw ; Patrick Peacock 

again,  1689 to 1691 ; David Edgar, 1693 to 1701; Samuel 
Brown, ordained 31st March 1703, died 17th May 1751 ; 
Samuel Brown, ordained 6th August 1752, died 23d July 1779; 
John Inglis, ordained 12th October 1780, deposed 17th April 
1804; John Slbbald, ordained 20th April 1809, died 20th 
December 1833; John Muir, ordained 19th June 1834. 

Manse. — I have not been able to ascertain when the old part of 
the manse was built. It must have been at least 130 years ago, be- 
cause the Browns lived in it. The antiquity of the building may 
be conjectured from the thickness of the ga-ble walls.f Repairs 

 In 1367 Thomas Regnall was reader and vicar of Kirkdalc, and Jolin Moffett,

have been executed and additions built at different periods. The 
last repairs and additions were made in 1835. The manse is 
now a handsome and substantial building, and is both comfortable 
and commodious. And it is but justice to state, that the heritors 
have been most liberal. The situation of the manse is much 
admired. It stands on an eminence about 150 vards from the 
sea, and commands a most extensive view. Although it is about 
70 feet above the level of the sea, four churches, twelve parishes, 
and the Isle of Man may be seen from the front door. 

Glebe. — The glebe contains nearly thirty acres. About the 
half of it is arable, the other half is very rough, steep, and rocky, 
and about seven acres of it are under wood. Some fields have 
lately been cleared of stones, and new fences built, and some other 
improvements made, which will soon render it more valuable. In 
the meantime it is worth L.20 per annum. As the glebe lies 
along a flat shore, it is capable of being greatly extended by warp- 
ing and embanking. There are at least forty acres that might be 
reclaimed in this way. 

Stipend. — The stipend of this parish is sixteen chalders, half 
meal, and half barley ; — a part of it has been commuted into 
money to the amount of L.104, including L.8, 6s. 8d. for com- 
munion elements. 

Dissenters. — There is one place of worship in Creetown belong- 
ing to the Seceders. It will hold about 300. It is reported that 
the minister's stipend is about L.SO, and is paid by the congre- 
gation. 

Divine service is in general well attended at both places of wor- 
ship ; and, in addition to the usual service during the day, there 
is sermon regularly in the parish church on Sabbath evening, and 
a lecture every Thursday evening at seven o'clock. Tracts are 
distributed monthly; and Sabbath schools and prayer meetings in 
connection with both congregations. The Lord's Supper is dis- 
pensed twice a-year in each place of worship. It is hoped by the 
diligent and prayerful use of all these means much good may be 
done. 

There are 27 families belonging to the Seceders ; 27 to the 
Roman Catholics; 1 to the Episcopalians ; 1 to the Cameroni- 
ans; 340 to the Church of Scotland. The average number of

communicants belonging to the Church for the last seven years 
has been about 500. Last year L.14, 4s. were collected for the 
General Assembly's four schemes ; besides L.4 for the Sabbath 
schools; L.5, 10s. for a church in Armagh; L.2, Os. 3d. for the 
education of the blind in Edinburgh. I am not aware of the sums 
collected by the Seceders for religious purposes ; but I believe it is 
very considerable, according to their numbers. 

Education. — There are five schools in the parish, viz. the paro- 
chial school ; a subscription school of industry for females ; two 
schools at the teachers' own' adventure, all in Creetown ; and one 
school in the country, partly supported by the heritors and partly 
at the teacher's own adventure. 

Branches tavght. — Reading, writing, arithmetic, English gram- 
mar, geography, mathematics, Latin, French, and, in the " female 
school of industry,"f besides the elementary branches of education, 
sewing, knitting, &amp;c. are also taught. 

Schoolmaster s Salary, c, — The schoolmaster's salary is the 
maximum, viz. L. 34, 4s. 4d. per annum. His house has the ler 
gal accommodation, and the school-fees may amount to about 
L. 26 yearly. 

Rate of School-Fees. — Reading, 2s. per quarter; reading and 
writing, 2s. 6d. ; reading, writing, and arithmetic, 3s. All these 
branches with English grammar, 4s. ; ditto with Latin, 8s. ; ditto 
with French, 7s. ; ditto with geography, 5s. These are the terms 
at the parish school. At the private schools they are about 
the same in the branches taught. At the school of industry, 
30 girls are taught free ; they have also occasionally received books 
and a part of their clothing. 

It is to be regretted that the accommodation in the parochial 
school is by no means what it ought to be, — an evil which, it is 
hoped, the heritors will speedily remedy. 

Literature. — There is a circulating library in Creetown, and 
also a small library in connection with the Sabbath schools. It 
would be an improvement, if a well-selected subscription library 
were established for the benefit of the whole parish. 

Poor's Funds. — The average number of regular paupers is about 
30, and of occasional paupers 10. The aliment allowed to each 
varies according to circumstances, and runs from L. 1 to L. 8 per 
annum. About L,95 are paid out of the poor's funds annually for 

 This teacher has a free house and garden from Kirkdale, and L. 10 yearly from 
the heritors.

ihe relief of the poor, besides a donivtion of L.40 a-year from Mrs 
Hugham of Cotsvvokl House. The poor's funds are supplied in 
the following manner : church collections, L.48 yearly ; procla- 
mation dues, hearse hire, Sic, L.7 ; voluntary assessment from the 
heritors, L.40; — L.95. There is now but little disposition among 
the people to refrain from seeking parochial relief except amongst 
a few of the old residenters. 

Prisons. — There is an excellent lock-up in Creetown, and it is 
to the praise of the people that it is now but seldom used. 

Inns and Ale-houses — There are eight inns and public houses 
in the parish, which are in general well kept; consequently they 
are much less injurious to the morals of the people than they 
otherwise would be ; although half the number would be quite suf- 
ficient for the entertainment of travellers and the convenience of 
the population. 

Fuel. — Both coals and peats are very much used. Coals are 
in general brought from Whitehaven, and cost about IGs. per ton. 
Peats are procured from the mosses in the parish, and cost from 
2s. to 2s. 6d. a-cart. The practice referred to in the old Statis- 
tical Account, of the poor people cutting whins and brushwood for 
burning, is still common. Coals are now 1844 only 13s. 4d, 
per ton. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since the last Statistical Account was written in 1794, the po- 
pulation has increased about 500 ; wages and prices have risen 
about 50 per cent, ; the rental of the parish has greatly increased, 
the style of husbandry has improved, and a great many fences have 
been built. Schools have become more numerous, and church ac- 
commodation more abundant. The quarry has been opened, and 
new fisheries established ; and although the manufacturing and 
shipping have diminished, yet the ' political economy" of the pa- 
rish may be represented as in a prosperous and improving condi- 
tion ; and my heart's desire and prayer is, that the piety which 
adorned this corner of the vineyard in the days of Rutherford, 
Dalgleish, and Peacock, may adorn it still. 

 The number of paupers has lately increased considerably. There are at present 
57 regular paupers on the roll, and it will now require above L.200 per annum to 
pay their aliment.

PRESBYTERY OF DUMFRIES, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE KEV. GEORGE M. BURNSIDE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name and Situation. — According to the former Statistical 
. Account of this parish, the ancient orthography was Vr, and the 
lronunciation Wiir or Whur, though it has long been frequently 
pronounced and spelt Orr. The lake out of which the river Urr, 
which bounds this parish for a considerable distance on the west 
side, issues, is called Loch Whur to this day ; and there are still 
some people in this country whose family name is M'Whir. 

Boundaries. — The parish is bounded on the east by the pa- 
rishes of Lochrutton and Kirkgunzeon ; on the south, by Colvend 
and Buittle ; on the west, by Crossmichael ; and on the north, by 
Kirkpatrick-Durham and Kirkpatrick-Irongray. 

The wind is generally from the south-west, and almost all the 
heavy gales are also from that direction. 

Extent and Mountains. — The length of Urr, nearly from north 
to south, is about 16 English miles, and its average breadth about '2 
miles. The total surface of the parish must therefore be about 40 
square miles. The only mountains of any considerable altitude are a 
range at the head of the parish, called the Larg-hills, where it is 
supposed coal might be obtained. The summit of the Larg-hills 
is about 600 feet above the level of the sea. Upon these hills lie 
the remains of four of the Covenanters who fell there, upon the 
bleak heath, victims to the persecution of Grahame of Claverhouse. 
A tombstone is erected at the place to their memory, and sur- 
roimded with a wall enclosing a small plantation. 

Lakes. — About three miles distant from the Larg hills, and 
in this parish towards its boundaries, are situated two lakes or 
lochs, of considerable extent and depth. These are Milton and 
Achenreoch lochs. The former is about three miles in circum- 
ference, and the latter about two and a half miles. They abound

with pike and perch, which are caught, at certain seasons, in con- 
siderable numbers. 

River. — The parish of Urr extends to near the mouth of the 
river Urr, which flows into the Solway Frith, and which, in gene- 
ral, bounds the parish on the west for the space of about ten miles. 
Salmon and sundry species of fresh water fish are caught in this 
river. The salmon, however, are much destroyed by night-poach- 
ing, and, with a few exceptions, the proprietors are culpable in 
not using means to prevent such an illegal and pernicious practice. 

Soil — Except a moorish portion of the upper part of the pa- 
rish, and intersections of granite rocks, and a portion of moss at 
the under part of it, the soil of Urr is in general light and kindly, 
and the arable land in the parish is perhaps in proportion to that 
which cannot be ploughed as 12 to 1. 

The plantations in the parish cover about 800 acres. 

II.~CiviL History. 

It would appear that, in the upper part of the parish, there was, 
in former times, a place of worship, probably Popish, and on the 
site of the building which is on the property of Meikle Kirkland, 
there were found, several years ago, some human bones and a 
quantity of melted lead. It is supposed that the building was con- 
sumed by fire, soon after the Reformation from Popery in Scotland. 

Mr, John Hepburn, whose memory is held in great veneration 
in this country, and in the parish of Urr in particular, was the 
first Presbyterian minister of this parish, after the Revolution of 
1688. Three several calls to this parish, the last in 1689, he 
accepted. Before this time, he had received Presbyterian or- 
dination at London, though, on account of the persecution 
against Presbyterians, his ordination was rather of a private 
nature. He preached also in the parish of Kirkgunzeon, 
which was then vacant. Besides his usual labours in this 
district, he preached sometimes in several other parishes in 
the west of Scotland, to many hearers, who, like himself, 
were displeased with some of the proceedings, both of the 
Church and State, about and after the Revolution of 1688. 
These adherents of Mr Hepburn published, in the year 1713, 
a book which they called Humble Pleadings for the Good Old 
Way, in which they state their principles, with thirty-four griev- 
ances, and the treatment which they and Mr Hepburn received 
from the office-bearers, both of Church and State. In the year 
1695, he was suspended by the General Assembly from the ex- 



URR. 



349 



ercise of his ministerial functions, on account of his ministerial 
actings independently of the sanction and authority of the Church 
courts, which had many proceedings against him. This suspen- 
sion was removed by the General Assembly in the year 1699. 
In the year 1696, he was tried by the Privy- Council for using 
some expressions which were supposed to be treasonable, and for 
which he suffered imprisonment for about three years, first in the 
Tolbooth of Edinburgh, and afterwards in the Castle of Stirling. 
In the year 1704, he was again suspended, and that by the com- 
mission of. the General Assembly, for not appearing to answer the 
charges brought against him by libel, for certain expressions he 
had used against the oath of allegiance and assurance ; and, m 
the year 1705, he was, by the General Assembly, deposed, as 
being guilty of teaching seditious doctrines, and following schis- 
matic courses ; but partly in consequence of a protest by the he- 
ritors, elders, and the other inhabitants of the parish of Urr 
against the said sentence, and partly by his conciliating declara- 
tions, he was reponed by the commission of the General Assem- 
bly in the year 1707. In some of the proceedings against him, 
he was accused of never having administered the ordinance of the 
Lord's Supper in the parish of Urr, for which omission he pleaded 
his peculiar circumstances, in regard to his brethren in the 
ministry, and the danger of corrupt communion; but he was 
desirous that these hindrances might be removed. Remark- 
ableeflFects, however, were sometimes produced by his minis- 
try, and especially by his preaching, some crying out " What 
shall we do to be saved " and others falling into a swoon. 
These effects were salutary to many, but only temporary to 
others, who soon returned to their sinful courses. Mr Hep- 
burn and his adherents in the south and west of Scotland 
were much opposed to the union of the two kingdoms of England 
and Scotland, to the Act of Toleration, the ambiguous nature of 
the oath of abjuration and supremacy, and some other public mat- 
ters, all of which they thought fraught with danger to Presby- 
terian government and true religious liberty in Scotland, and 
contrary to the Solemn League and Covenant ; and, upon these 
subjects, they drew up a memorial, to be presented to the General 
Assembly in the year 1712, praying the Assembly to cause a re- 
lio-ious fast to be held throughout the church, on account of these 
sins in Church and State. This memorial, though considered in 
the committees both of bills and overtures, was not read in the 



350 



K I RKC UDB RIG HTS II IRE. 



Assembly, but a sub-committee was appointed to confer with Mr 
Hepburn and his friends concerning the said memorial. Upon 
the whole, there is reason to believe that he .was a great and good 
man, though he may have, in some instances, manifested his zeal 
in an indiscreet and intolerant manner. It is reported that Mr 
Hepburn collected all the Popish books that he could find in the 
parish, and burned them publicly on a hill, called Corse Hill, near 
the church ; and tradition adds, that he made the most bigoted 
Papist in the parish blow the fire. It is more certain, however, 
that, in his zealous adherence to the Protestant succession to the 
Throne of Great Britain, he raised a volunteer corps in this and 
some neighbouring parishes, and marched at the head of it, for 
the purpose of assisting Government against the Popish rebels in 
the year 1713. The standard he then used is still in Urr manse. 
It is a large white flag, and upon it is emblazoned, in a kind of 
gilt coloured characters, " For the Lord of Hosts." The drum 
which was used in his corps, was also long kept in the parish ; but, 
about thirty years ago, it fell into a state of total decay. 

From the presbytery records, it appears that Mr Hepburn died 
in March 1723. 

The presbytery's records give a detailed account of many in 
the parish being attached to Mr Hepburn's peculiar views, and 
the difficulty the presbytery had to settle such a successor to Mr 
Hepburn, as might be ultimately satisfactory and profitable to all 
parties. They appointed Mr Patoun, one of their number, to re- 
quest the Lord Advocate not to issue a presentation in favour of 
any one, but to allow the presbytery and parish of Urr to manage 
the matter for the edification of all, and this request seems to 
have been complied with. 

Mr Christopher Wright succeeded Mr Hepburn, as minister in 
the parish of Urr, in October 1723. Mr Thomas M'Kinnel suc- 
ceeded Mr Wright in 1736. Dr James Muirhead succeeded Mr 
M'Kinnel in 1770 or 1771. The celebrated oriental scholar, 
Dr Alexander Murray, afterwards Professor of Oriental Languages 
in the University of Edinburgh, was ordained assistant minister 
in this parish in 1806, and to be successor to Dr Muirhead, who 
died in 1808. John M'Whir succeeded Dr Murray in the year 
1813. 

Registers.— ThQ ancient parochial registers and other session 
records of Urr are in a very imperfect, mutilated, and almost ille- 
oible condition. All the volumes to the year 1813 are more or 



URR. 



851 



less in this condition. There is one volunne from the year 1640 
to 1660, another from 1701 to about 1712, another from 1736 to 
about 1769, and another from 1770 to 1813. From 1813 down- 
wards, the session records have been kept with great accuracy. 

Buildings.— The parish church of Urr was rebuilt m the year 
1814, and may contain 775 sitters. The manse was built a few 
years before the church. There are several dissenting meeting- 
houses in the parish ; and in the village of Dalbeattie, there is a 
Popish chapel which was built above thirty years ago. 

LancUoicners.—The land-owners of Urr are 34 in number, but 
the greater part of them are proprietors of comparatively small por- 
tions of the parish. The chief land-owners are at present, John 
Heron Maxwell, Esq. of Munshes; William Copland, Esq. of Colli- 
ston ; John Sinclair, Esq. of Redcaslle ; William Maitland, Esq. of 
Achlane ; William Stothert, Esq. of Cargen ; William Young 
Herries, Esq. of Spottes; and John Hyndman, Esq. of Milton. 

Antiquities.— QeisX motes and fortified camps are to be met 
with, both in Urr and the adjoining parishes of Buittle and Cross- 
michael. Tradition is silent as to the origin and use of these 
motes. The mote of Urr is perhaps the largest of the kind in 
Scotland. It stands on the west side of the river, about half a 
mile below the church. 

Though the fossae or ditches, and the general construction of 
Urr Mote are by no means Roman, yet about seventy years ago, 
some outworks remained, seemingly erected by that people. At 
Mill of Buittle, about a mile west from the Mote of Urr, there 
were found about sixty years ago, three small silver coins, one of 
Tiberius, one of Hadrian, and one of Commodus. On the estate 
of Mr Maxwell of Munshes, also, about two miles south-west of 
the mote, there were found several spears made of a very hard 
brass. Upon the estate of Edingham, in this parish, about three 
miles south-east from the Mote of Urr, there was found a tripod 
or three-footed pot of Roman construction, made of a very hard 
metal, which seems to be a composition of copper and tin. This 
vessel is in the possession of Mr Train of Castle Douglas. Other 
two vsels, nearly of the same form with the one just mentioned, 
were found a few years ago on the farm of Rickhorn, in this pa- 
rish, at a considerable depth from the surface. There was also 
found in a peat moss cut in the upper part in this parish, a Ra- 
man javelin, which was presented to the late Sir Walter Scott, by 
Mr Train.

A very amusing account has been given respecting Robert de 
Bruce's gift of the mote referred to, to a woman named Sprotte. 
The story, called " King Bruce's Bowl," is related by Simon 
Sprotte. It was inserted in the Dumfries and Galloway Courier, 
1st October 1822. 

On the estate of Redcastle, and about a mile east from the 
Mote of Urr, there is a rude block of granite of considerable 
height, standing upright in a plain field, but tradition is silent as 
to the purpose of this erection. 

Auchengibbert was the residence of the Buchanites, before 
they removed to Crocketford. The sect is now reduced to two 
individuals. 

III. — Population. 

The return to Dr Webster in 1755 was 1 193 

By the census of 1801, . 1719

The villages of Dalbeattie and Springholm contain a popula- 
tion a great proportion of which is Irish, which the state of the 
surrounding country is unable to support by lawful industry. 
Hence poverty with its generally accompanying evils greatly pre- 
vails in these two villages. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — Agriculture, in this part of Scotland particularly, 
laboured long under great disadvantages, and, even after it began 
to improve, made very little progress for some time. About 150 
years ago, some lands in this neighbourhood, which would now 
bring a rent upwards of L.200 Sterling per annum, were offered to 
any tenant who would pay the public burdens. From the year 
1688 to the year 1740, agriculture seems to have improved very 
little. In the year 1760, shell-marl was discovered in Gal- 
loway; and the abundant crops at first produced by the use 
of this calcareous manure caused a general tillage of large tracts 
of land, which had been set apart for the purpose of grazing black- 
cattle. A spirit of industry began then to be dilTused among 
the tenantry and labourers ; but it was afterwards discovered, 
that marl manure was used too copiously, which brought the 
land into a state of consequent sterility. Honest industry was 
also greatly cramped by the vicinity of the Isle of Man, with 
which the inhabitants of Galloway carried on an extensive 
smuggling trade. But that island having become subject, about 



URll. 



353 



the year 1760, to the revenue regulations of Great Britain, it 
is inconceivable how much the agriculture of every parish in the 
maritime parts of Galloway was thereby benefited. Marl has 
long gone into desuetude in Galloway, and the calcareous manure 
substituted in its place is that of lime imported from the coast of 
Cumberland, and of late bone-dust for turnip crop imported chiefly 
from Liverpool. A large quantity of grain is exported from this 
and adjacent parishes chiefly to Liverpool, and the farmers are both 
skilful and industrious. 

Oats, barley, wheat, turnip, and potatoes are the chief agricul- 
tural produce of Urr. The annual rent of the parish is supposed 
to be about L. 16,000 Sterling. 

Live-Stock. — Horses, black-cattle, sheep, and swine are in ge- 
neral the live-stock. 

Sheep are fed in great numbers, especially of late years, upon 
the turnip crops, and the facilities now afforded of raising turnip 
by the recent use of bone manure, and of conveying fat sheep to 
Liverpool and other English markets, by means of steam-vessels, 
have greatly tended to increase the system of sheep feeding in 
this district of country. The rearing of pigs, and feeding them 
for the market, has long been carried on to a great extent in this 
country. 

Manufactories. — There is a paper manufactory in the village of 
Dalbeattie, where there are falls of water very favourable to the 
operations of machinery. There are also corn, flax, and saw-mills 
in different parts of the parish. 

v.— Pa RocHiAL Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The situation of the parish church is upon 
the whole pretty central ; but the parish ought to be divided into 
two, with a church in each. The amount of stipend is at present 16 
chalders, half oatmeal and half barley, paid in money according to 
the fiars' prices of the country, and L.IO allowance for expenses 
attending the administration of the Lord's Supper. The glebe is 
about 12 acres of extent, and worth about L,15 per annum. 

Education. — The schools in this parish are at present eight in 
number, and in all of them the ordinary branches of education are 
more or less taught. Three of these are parochial schools,— one 
in the centre of the parish, with an average attendance of 80 
scholars ; another at Dalbeattie, with an attendance of 90 scholars ; 
and another at Milton, having 50 scholars. The salary, in 
toto, is L.51, 6s. 6d. Of this L.22, 8s. 9d. goes to the teacher

of the central school, which was originally the parish school ; about 
L.18 is allotted to the teacher of the school at Dalbeattie; and 
about L. 11 is the appointed proportion of salary for the teacher 
of the school at Milton. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of paupers in the 
parish upon the regular poor's roll is 46 ; the number of those who 
receive occasional supply is 36. The regular poor receive at the 
rate of about L.l, 6s. per annum, the occasional poor about 16s- 
per annum. The rest of the expenditure goes to the support of 
orphans, salary for session-clerk, salary for church officer, &amp;c. 
The funds for the poor chiefly consist of the interest of L.l 00 of 
mortified money left by the late Michael Herries, Esq. of Spottes, 
— a. voluntary assessment from the heritors to the amount of L.56, 
and collections in the church to the amount of about L.40 per 
annum.

PRESBYTERY OF KIRKCUDBRIGHT, SYNOD OP GALLOWAY. 

THE REV. JAMES THOMSON, MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Extent, Boundaries, Sfc. — This parish has borne, at dif- 
ferent periods, the names of Dundrennan, Monkton, and Rerwick, 
or Rerrick. The first of these appellations is derived from the 
Irish words Drainan, signifying the Hill of I'horns — while, 
according to Symson, whose account of Galloway was compiled in 
1684, the parish was called Monkton, from the monks who dwelt 
in the Abbey of Dundrennan. Chalmers again, in his Caledonia, 
while he admits Rerrick to be a name of difficult etymology, con- 
siders it as an " abbreviated pronunciation of Rerwick, which 
was derived from diwick, or creek of Solway at this place."t This 
can scarcely be considered a satisfactory account of the origin of

t Chalmers' Caledonia, vol. iii. p. 313. 



REIIRICK. 



355 



the name of the parish, although it may be difficult to give any 
more plausible conjecture on the subject. The parish first ob- 
tained its present name towards the close of the seventeenth cen- 
tury, when a new church was erected upon the lands of Rerwick, 
forminfr part of the estate of Orroland, now the property of the 
infant "son and heir of the late Robert Cutlar Fergusson, M. P. 
for the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright. 

The parish of Rerrick is ten miles in length, and the average 
breadth is about six miles. It is bounded on the north by the pa- 
rish of Kelton ; on the east by the parish of Buittle and a Bay 
of Solvvay at the mouth of the water of Urr ; on the south by the 
Solway ; and on the west by the parish of Kirkcudbright. 

The surface of Rerrick is generally broken and varied. To- 
wards the north, it assumes a highland appearance, with a frontier 
of pretty considerable mountains, the most remarkable of which, 
both in height and picturesque character, is Bengairn. This 
mountain, covered with heath, and surmounted by a Cairn of al- 
most Druidical antiquity, rises to a height of about 1200 feet 
above the level of the sea, and overlooks, the Solway in all its 
length, commanding a view, which in variety, magnificence, and 
extent, is scarcely to be surpassed on the most romantic shores of 
Scotland. From the base of the hills on the north the parish 
trends towards the south and west, exhibiting as it approaches the 
sea a series of bold and lofty headlands, and terminating in an iron- 
bound coast, of which it is enough to say, that it furnished to 
ihe author of Waverley the materials for much of the scenery of 
EUangowan. In the romance of Guy Mannering, the reader 
will find the shores of Rerrick delineated by the hand of a 
master. 

The traveller who desires to visit this parish to advantage, 
should approach it from the village of Dalbeattie on the east. 
The road, after crossing the Water of Urr, and skirting the gra- 
nite rocks of Kirkennan, approaches Orchardton, the seat of Co- 
lonel Maxwell, through the Holms of Glenyarrick. Few places 
in the south of Scotland are richer in natural beauty than this. 
It is situated upon a deeply indented bay of Solway, and sur- 
rounded on the east and west by the wooded promontories of Torr

an amphitheatre of hills, the most striking of which are Skreel 
and Bengairn. If the traveller has time, it will well repay his

trouble to witness from the simimit of either of these mountains, 
the rising of the summer sun over Skiddaw and the Cumberland 
range. At such a moment, the bioad and still waters of Solway, 
reflecting the dark and rocky shores of the Scottish coast, form a 
picture worthy the pencil of Claude. 

After leaving Orchardton, the road passes for nearly two miles 
along the shore, fringed with extensive plantations, till it reaches 
the village of Auchencairn, situated at the head of the bay of that 
name. This is a thriving place, with much of an English cha- 
racter in its general aspect. The houses are of a superior de- 
scription, — interspersed with trees, — built on no regular plan, — but 
exhibiting, as a whole, that cheerful and riaut appearance for 
which the villages of the south are so remarkable. Tlie neigh- 
bourhood is beautiful, commanding a full view of Orchardton, and 
comprehending the mountain scenery already described, with Col- 
lin, the pleasant residence of Mr Welsh, at the head of tiie bay. 
A little to the south of the village stands the old mansion of 
Auchencairn, long the abode of the family of Culton of Auchen- 
abony ; and two miles along the west side of the bay of Auch- 
encairn is situated the modern mansion of Nutwood, built 
by the late Major Culton, with its policy overhanging the water. 
Still farther down, upon the very margin of the bay, stands Bal- 
cary, the beautiful residence of Mrs Gordon, widow of the late 
Mr Gordon of Culvennan. The green isle of Heston forms a 
fine feature in the mouth of the bay, and, as it were, landlocks 
it, giving to the whole much of the character of lake scenery. 
Outside the bay again, the shores of Rerrick, towards the west, 
and along the Heughs of Rascarrel, Barlocco, Orroland, Port- 
raary, and Netherlaw, present the boldest and most sublime fea- 
tures of coast scenery. Two caverns upon the Barlocco shore, call- 
ed the White and Black Cove, are particularly worthy of notice. 
The entrance to the former is as lofty as the mast of some great 
Ammiral, and its vast extent reminds the spectator of the airy 
and echoing halls of Fingal in Staffa. The Black Cove is of an 
opposite and gloomy character, and its dark caverns would form 
no unfit habitation for the Spirit of the Solway. 

For five miles to the west of Auchencairn, the road passes along 
comparatively an uninteresting ridge of the parish, still, however, 
commanding fine views of the Solway and the English coast, 
till at length it opens upon the beautiful and secluded valley of 



herpvIck.

Duiidrennan, with the village and ruined Abbey in the fore- 
ground. 

It is impossible to tread this classic spot, without carrying back 
our recollections to the period when the Abbey of Dundrennan 
afiforded a temporary shelter to the unfortunate Mary Stuart, dur- 
ing the last hours she spent in Scotland. Tradition has traced, 
probably with more of fancy than of accuracy, her course from 
Langside to the scene of her embarkation for England. It has 
been hitherto supposed that, passing through the wildest recesses 
of the Glenkens, she reached Queenshill, so named from her rest- 
ing sometime there, and now the seat of Mr Campbell, at the 
head of the Vale of the Tarf. Proceeding in the direction of Tong- 
land, she is said to have crossed the Dee by an ancient vrooden 
bridge, which then spanned the river about a mile above that place. 
But this traditionary account of the Queen's progress from Lang- 
side to Dundrennan has been recently discredited by the publica- 
tion of Historical Memoirs of her reign by Lord Herries, the com- 
panion of her flight. His account bears, that " so soone as the 
Queen saw the day lost, she was carried from the field by the 
Lords Herries, Fleming, and Livistoune. Prettie George Douglas 
and William the Fundlin escapt also with the Queen. She rode 
all night, and did not halt until she came to the Sanquhir. From 
thence she went to Terregles, the Lord Herries' hous, where she 
rested some few dayes, and then, against her friends' advyce, she 
resolved to goe to England and commit herselfe to the protection 
of Queen Elizabeth ; in hopes, by her assistance, to be repossess- 
ed affain in her kingdome. So she embarked at a creek near 
Dundrennen, in Galloway, and carried the Lord Herries to attend 
her with his counsel, and landed at Cockermouth in Cumberland, 
Heer she stayed, and sent the Lord Herries to Londone in hopes 
to be receaved with honor." 

Mary arrived at Dundrennan in the evening, and spent her last 
night in Scotland beneath the walls of the Monastery, then a mag- 
nificent and extensive building, and of which Edward Maxwell, a 
near relative of Lord Herries, was at the time Abbot. The situa- 
tion of Dundrennan Abbey has much natural beauty, indepen- 
dent of historical associations, to recommend it to the attention of 
the traveller. The building is now greatly dilapidated ; but

enough still remains to indicate its former splendour. It is al- 
most entirely covered with a pale gray-coloured moss, which 
gives a character of peculiar and airy lightness to the lofty co- 
lumns and Gothic arches, many of which are entire. Placed 
upon a gentle eminence, on the bank of a rocky and sparkling 
burn, and surrounded on all sides, except the south, by a range of 
hills, Dundrennan forms an exception to the usual aspect of abbey 
scenery. There is little old wood near it, save in the deep and de- 
vious glens which intersect the adjacent grounds of Mr Maitland 
of Dundrennan ; but the neighbouring braes are generally clothed 
with copse, and afford from many points extensive views of the 
Solway, and of the mountains of Cumberland. 

From Newlaw hill, an eminence adjoining the residence of Mr 
Maitland, and forming part of the Hill of Thorns, from which the 
place takes its name, the prospect is still more magnificent, com- 
manding, in addition lo an almost boundless expanse of ocean, a 
view of the Isle of Man, and of the mountains of Morne in Ire- 
land. It is not uncommon from this spot, as noticed in the ori- 
ginal Statistical Account of the parish, to have upwards of a hun - 
dred vessels in sight at one time, between St Bee's Head and the 
Mull of Galloway, which, from a well-known optical deception, 
seem elevated one above another, according to their distance, till 
the most remote appears as if actually dropping from the clouds; 
so that, in a certain state of the atmosphere, the ocean resembles 
an immense canvass suspended from the heavens, with an infinite 
variety of vessels pictured upon it. But sentiment, no doubt, gives 
to Dundrennan its principal charm. These broken arches and 
tottering columns — these deserted cells and weed-grown aisles — 
these neglected monuments of belted knights and mitred abbots 
— and this wide scene of ruin and desolation, melancholy and si- 
lent though they be, are all invested with an inexpressible charm, 
as far superior to that imparted by mere fine scenery, as the plea- 
sures of mind are to those of sense. 

For nearly forty years, the late Adam Maitland, Esq. of Dun- 
drennan was the principal resident heritor in the parish of Rerrick ; 
and during this long period, it may be truly said that, wilhin his 
sphere as a country gentleman, his life was devoted to objects of 
public usefulness and private benevolence. He turned his most 
zealous attention to every subject connected with rural economy ; 
and the result of this may now be seen in the admirable roads and 



RERKICK.

bridges, in the extensive plantations, and in the improved agricul- 
ture of the district over which his influence and his estates extend- 
ed. His important position as Convener of the Stewartry enabled 
him to give efficient support to every measure of general utility, 
guided, as all his objects were, by enlarged and liberal views on 
economical and political subjects. About twenty years ago, Mr 
Maitland transferred his residence to his estate of Compstone on 
the banks of the Tarf, but he still continued to take a lively in- 
terest in the parish of Rerrick ; and during years of declining 
health, when he had unavoidably in a great measure withdrawn 
from public life and active exertion of every sort, he still devoted 
himself anxiously to the work of doing good, by combining the 
improvements on his estate in Rerrick with the employment of the 
poor. Shortly before Mr Maitland's death, which took place at 
Compstone on the 20th of July 1843, he had removed the old 
mansion of Dundrennan, and erected a shooting-lodge on the site 
of it. 

Nevertheless, it is indisputable that Rerrick suffers from the non- 
residence of so many heritors, and it is impossible not to look back, 
with somewhat of a feeling of regret, to the good old times when 
the hospitable homes of Collin and Dundrennan, of Orroland and 
Portmary, were occupied by their respective proprietors, and when, 
of course, the interests of the tenantry and the poor formed the 
subject of active and personal superintendence. Many of the 
principal estates in the parish are now occupied and managed as 
led farms for grazing, and with less of agricultural spirit and stir 
than we should have seen, had it so happened that we could have 
. numbered not only among the proprietors but among the inhabi- 
tants of the parish, Sir Robert Abercromby of Birkenbog, Mr 
Murray of Broughton, M. P. for the Stewartry, Mr Maitland of 
Dundrennan, late Solicitor-General for Scotland, and Mr Welsh 
of Collin. 

'J' he village at the Abbey consists chiefly of feus upon the estates 
of Dundrennan and Orroland. The houses are pleasantly inter- 
spersed with fine old trees, and combine admirably with the pre- 
cincts of the Abbey. From Dundrennan to the sea the distance 
is about a mile and a half. The road runs through a narrow 
valley, and passing Netherlaw, the seat of Sir Robert Abercromby, 
leads directly to the shore, where the rock is still pointed out by 
the peasantry from which the hapless Mary embarked on her ill-

lated voyage to England. It is situated in a little creek, surrounded 
by vast and precipitous cliffs, and called Portmary in remembrance 
of the Queen. The scene is appropriately wild and sublime; and 
the contemplative stranger who visits it in the stillness of evening 
is apt to imagine that the waves fall here with a more mournful 
dash upon the shore, and that the cadence of the autumn wind is 
more low and melancholy than elsewhere, as if Nature's self were 
conscious of, and lamented the unhappy event she had seen take 
place upon the spot. 

The residence of Portmary is immediately contiguous to the 
sea. This estate is entailed, and is now the property of Mr James 
Lenox of New- York, the only son and heir of a native of Kirk- 
cudbright who migrated to America upwards of sixty years ago, 
and who recently died one of the richest men, and most eminent 
merchants in the United States. Along the coast of Solway to 
the east, lies the estate and ancient mansion of Orroland. The 
late Mr Cutlar Fergusson, Member of Parliament for the Stewartry, 
succeeded to this estate about thirty-five years ago, while still 
prosecuting his professional pursuits in India. His brother, Mr 
Henry Fergusson, soon after removed from Craigdarroch, — the 
family residence in Dumfriesshire — to Orroland, where he com- 
menced an extensive system of improvement — modernising the 
mansion-house — rebuilding the farm-steadings — draining and re- 
Hewing the fences — laying down extensive plantations in the most 
tasteful manner — and thereby giving a new character to this side 
of the parish. Still farther east we have Barlocco, the curious 
residence of Mr Macartney, hanging over the Solway, and Ras- 
earrel, the property of Mr Vans Agnew of Sheuchan, also conti- 
guous to the shore. This brings us again to the Bay of Auchen- 
eairn. 

To return to the valley of Dundrennan. From this point west- 
ward the parish of Rerrick assumes a pastoral character, till it 
terminates in the farm of Castlecreavie, forming the western ex- 
tremity of the estate of Dundrennan, which abounds in Roman an- 
tiquities, and the higher grounds of which look down upon the deli- 
cious scenery of St Mary's Isle and the Bay of Kirkcudbright. To 
the east of Castlecreavie Hes Auchengool, the property of John

mist and Statistof the day. From, this pointto the baseof Bengairn, 
the surface of the parish is of a wild and upland description, the 
greater part of it belonging to Mr Murray of Broughton. This 
seems enough in the way of a general description and survey of 
the parish. 

Mineraloffi/.— There is much in the parish of Rerrick deserving 
the attention of the mineralogist and natural philosopher. The 
range of hills, of which Bengairn is the summit, affords fine ex- 
amples of the granite formation, while the coast everywhere 
abounds with freestone of excellent quality, which has of late been 
much in request for building purposes. Upon the shore, in the 
immediate vicinity of Portraary, there is a remarkable natural 
arch of Barytes or Terra Ponderosa, which, from its resemblance 
to a person in a state of suspension, has long borne the name of 
the Hangit Man. Some of the highest headlands in the parish, and 
particularly those in the vicinity of the White and Black Coves of Bar ■ 
locco, are composed of puddingstone, resting upon extensive beds 
of very hard freestone. In the Coves fine specimens may be occa- 
sionally obtained of jasper which takes a high polish, and rock- 
crystals of a pale purple colour and of the most perfect prismatic 
forms, abound in a small stream upon the hill of Screel, within the 
estate of Colonel Maxwell of Orchardton. 

In the lands of Auchenleek, in the eastern district of the pa- 
rish, formerly belonging to Lord Macartney, and now the pro- 
perty of Mr Henry, an iron mine has been opened under the ma- 
nagement of an English company. From fifty to seventy tons of 
ore of superior quality are obtained weekly, and it is sent chiefly 
to Birmingham and the neighbourhood. A mine of copper ore 
has also for some time been wrought in the Island of Heston, at 
the mouth of the Bay of Auchencairn. It is at present let on 
lease to an English tenant, and the ore is shipped to Swansea. 

Ports.— The facilities for shipping produce from Rerrick are 
considerable ; and three places on the coast have been declared 
free ports, — Balcarry, on Auchencairn Bay, Burnfoot, at the 
point where the Abbey burn enters the Solway, and MuUoch 
Bay, at the south-western extremity of the parish. The first of 
these is safe and commodious by nature, and the other two ports 
might be raade so at a very inconsiderable expense.

kirk session of the parish 18th December 1751. The former has 
been very correctly kept since 1806, but very irregularly previous 
to that period. 

Antiquities. — Besides the ancient Cairn on the summit of Ben- 
gairn, already mentioned, the traces of two Druidical temples, 
and of no less than twelve camps, Saxon, Danish, and Roman, 
are extant in the parish. But beyond all question, the most re- 
markable and interesting remain of antiquity in Rerrick, is the 
Abbey of Dundrennan. Its situation, in valle reducta, has been 
already described, and it only remains to give some slight notices 
of its foundation and history. 

The reign of David I. has been truly described as " the great 
age of religious establishments" in Scotland. Fergus, Lord of 
Galloway, who was by marriage allied to the throne, emulated 
royalty in the " munificence of his foundations," one of the most 
remarkable of which was Dundrennan. He founded this Abbey 
in 1142, and filled it with Cistertian monks from the Abbey of 
Rievall, in England. Sylvan us was the first Abbot of Dundren- 
nan. He was transferred to Rievall in 1167, and, according to 
Spottiswood, he died at Belleland in 1189; but Cardonnel assigns 
the previous year, 1188, as the time, and Dundrennan as the 
place of his death. Those who are curious in such matters may 
be referred to Cardonriel's Antiquities of Scotland for a list of the 
successors of Sylvanus, the last of whom was Edward IVLixwell, 
son to John Lord Herries, after whose death King James Sixth 
annexed the Abbey of Dundrennan to his Royal Chapel of Stir- 
ling. This annexation took place in 1621, and was ratified by 
Parliament in that year, and again in 1633. Symson, writing in 
1684, says, " The Bishop of Dunblaine, as Deaneof the Chapel- 
Royal, is patron of the parish of Rerick, or Dundranen, and hath 
a part of his revenue paid out of the lands of that Abbacy; he 
hath also a bailerie here, heritablie exerc'd by the Earl of Nithis- 
dale, whose jurisdiction reacheth over the whole parish, except 
one baronrie called Kirkcastel, belonging to the Laird of Brouorh- 
ton."t

The historical notices of the Abbey are generally extremely 
meagre. The Chronicle of Melrose, the compilation of which 
has been frequently but erroneously ascribed to an Abbot of 
Dundrennan, contains only this slight mention of the Abbey: — 

/Imio M.c.xm. fu7idala est Abbatia Be Dundraynan in Gal- 
waya." Nor does Dempster's Apparatus give much additional 
information. "Dundran in Galweia. Fundat Cistersiensi or- 
dini S. Dauid, Rex. Hect. Boeth, Lib. xii. Historioe Scoticse, 
pag. ccLXXiv; ex hoc S. Richardas Sacruta fuit, et Thomas 
Abbas Pontificis elector Concilio Constantinensi mccccxxxix, 
qui Donduno male ab Onufrio dicitur apud Joannem Gualteriura 
Chron. Chronicorum, Demochares a Dundraina vocat."f Spot- 
tiswood is equally short and unsatisfactory in his account of Dun- 
drennan but, according to the better authorities, he gives the 
honour of founding the Abbey, not to King David, but to his 
noble kinsman, the Lord of Galloway. 8ir Robert Sibbald, in 
his Manuscript Collections, preserved in the Advocates' Library 
at Edinburgh, describes Dundrennan merely as a large Abbey, 
in the parish of Rerrick, " wherein the wisard, Michael Scott, 
lived."§ For this tradition, however, we are aware of no other 
or better authority. 

Although the building has suffered much from the devouring 
hand of time, and not a little from dilapidation, for the purposes 
of building cottages in the neighbourhood, the remains are still 
very considerable, and the original form and extent of the Abbey 
admits of being easily traced. The church of the monastery 
was in the form of a cross, with a central spire, which tradition 
represents to have been 200 feet high. The body of the build- 
ing was 120 feet in length, and divided into three aisles, by seven 
clustered columns, supporting arches entering to the side aisles, 
of great height and beauty. The breadth of each of the side 
aisles was about 15 feet, and that of the centre aisle 25 feet. 
The transept measured 120 feet from north to south, and 46 
feet from east to west. 

The east end of the church was of the same breadth with the 
middle aisle, and only 35 feet in length. On the south side of

the church were the cloisters, containing a square area of 94 feet. 
Still farther south were the lodgings and difl'erent offices of the 
Monastery, occupying a space of nearly 300 feet square. At the 
south end, again, of the western side of these buildings, was a 
small projecting erection in the shape of a cross, and very similar 
to the church but inverted — those portions which fronted the east 
in the one facing the west in the other. 

There are still some ancient and curious monuments to be 
found at Dundrennan. Of these, the most remarkable is the 
tomb of Alan Lord of Galloway, sirnamed the Great Constable 
of Scotland, who was buried within the walls of the Abbey in the 
year 1233. His mutilated figure is rudely represented in alto 
relievo, cross-legged, and in mail armour, with a buff coat above, 
a belt across the shoulder, and another round the waist. In the 
neighbourhood this figure is generally known by the name of 
Tlte Belted Knight. There is also a tombstone bearing the 
fiffure of an Abbot in his canonicals, in tolerable preservation ; 
but the inscription upon it is so much decayed as to be ille- 
gible. 

Although the Abbey of Dundrennan was indisputably annexed 
to the Crown in 1621, it was long matter of doubt whether it had 
not been included in some of the later Crown charters under 
which the lands and barony of Dundrennan have been long held 
by the family to which they now belong. This point, however, 
was set at rest by the late Mr Maitland of Dundrennan, who 
some years ago presented a memorial to the Commissioners of 
Woods and Forests, representing strongly the constant dilapida- 
tion to which the ruins were exposed, and proposing to abandon 
all right of property in the Abbey, provided it should be placed 
under the permanent management and protection of the Crown. 
After due consideration, this proposition was acceded to ; and 
Mr Nixon, the Master of Works for the Board in Scotland, was 
authorized and directed to examine and report upon the state of 
the ruins. The result of this inquiry has been an extensive re- 
paration of the Abbey, and the enclosure of the building, along . 
with the contiguous burying-ground, within a high stone wall. 
The accumulated debris of the ruins has been entirely removed, 
the pavement and precincts of the Abbey restored to their ori- 
ginal level, and the ancient monuments and many curious frag- 
ments of the building cleared and most tastefully disposed — the

whole exhibiting one of the most beautiful specimens of monastic 
antiquity now existing in Scotland. Mr Andrew Carter, school- 
master at Dundrennan, has been recently appointed Keeper of 
the Abbey, with an annual salary of L.5. 

The chartulary of Dundrennan does not appear to be extant ; 
but one or two charters, granted by the Abbots of this Abbey, 
are preserved in the Chapter-house at Westminster, with seals, 
in a state of very perfect preservation.

Principal 6'ea5,— Orchardton, Dundrennan, Orroland, Nether- 
law, Balcarry, Collin, Nutwood, and Port Mary. Late in the 
seventeenth century, when Sir Robert Sibbald compiled his De- 
scription of Scotland, the considerable houses of the parish of 
Rerrick are said to have been, " Dundrainnan Abbay, Ba- 
locco, Glenshinnock, Orchartoun, and Colnachtyr." G4en- 
shinnoch is generally understood to have been the ancient name 
of Orchardton, while Colnachtyr, under the more modern appel- 
lation of Conaightry, is now an outlying farm upon the estate of 
Mr Murray of Broughton.

Ill, — Population. 
Although population is generally stationary in parishes so 
purely agricultural and pastoral as Rerrick, there appears to have 
been a gradual and progressive increase in the number of in- 
habitants during the last half century. The return to Dr Web- 
ster in 1775 was only 1051 ; and it is stated in the former Sta- 
tistical Account, published in 1794, that the population of the 
parish was then nearly the same. But the more recent Parlia- 
mentary returns exhibit the following results: — 

In 1801, the population was 1 166 
1811, . . J224 

1821, . . 1378 

1831, . . 1633 

1841, . . 1692 

As to the general character of the inhabitants of the parish it 
seems sufficient to repeat the kindly language of their late minis- 
ter, who knew them well. " The people here," says Mr Thom- 
son in the former Statistical Account, " are peaceable, humane, 
and hospitable, have a lively sense of decorum and character, and 
many of them give indubitable proofs that their minds are deeply 
imbued with rational piety." This was the character of the peo- 
ple of Rerrick in 1794, and at the distance of half a century, they 
have in no respect forfeited their claim to it. 

IV. — Indttstry. 
Agriculture. — The parish of Rerrick contains about 20,447 
acres, standard imperial measure. Of these, 13,088 acres have 
been at one time or other under cultivation, while 6798 acres 
have never been cultivated, or otherwise used than as pasture. 
The remaining 561 acres are under wood, natural or planted. 
Of late years agriculture, properly so called, has not been ex- 
tending in the parish ; and, on the contrary, many of the finest 
farms have been laid down in permanent grass. In this way, 
hlacTi cattle may be considered as truly the staple commodity of 
the district, by which the farmer pays his rent and makes his 
livelihood. 

Bent of Land. — The real rent of the parish somewhat exceeds 
L.l 0,000 a year. In the poorer districts, the average rent of 
the Scotch acre runs from 15s. to 25s., but the rich old grazings 
of Dundrennan and Netherlaw yield a much higher rent. There 
are three corn mills in the parish, which appear to be amply suf- 
ficient for the purposes of the farmer.

Fishinffs.— Some years ago, a stake-net salmon fishing was 
established on the west side of the Bay of Auchencairn, by the 
proprietors of Balcary and Nutwood. It has been reasonably 
successful, yielding a steady and increasing rent. More recently, 
Mr Lenox of Port Mary has let the right of salmon fishing on 
the shores near to Burnfoot. The take of salmon here has not 
hitherto been great ; but the fish are of the finest quality. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Villaffes.—Theve are two villages in the parish, which have 
been already described, — the one at the head of the Bay of 
Auchencairn, and the other in the immediate vicinity of Dun- 
drennan Abbey. There are three licensed public-houses in 
Auchencairn, and two at Dundrennan, which are well kept and 
regulated. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The greater proportion of the inhabitants 
of the parish belong to the Estabhshed Church, although there 
is a most respectable congregation of the Free Church at Auchen- 
cairn, under the ministry of the Rev. Mr Murray. The patronage 
of the parish belongs to the Crown ; and it is a remarkable fact, 
that there have only been four incumbents of Rerrick since the 
Revolution. The first of these was the Rev. Mr Alexander 
Telfair, who is now chiefly known as the author of a very curious 
tract, printed at Edinburgh in 1696, under the following title :— 
A True Relation of an Apparition, Expressions and Actings of a 
Spirit, which infested the house of Andrew Mackie, in Ring- croft 
of Stocking in the Paroch of Rerrick in the Steioartry of Kirkcud- 
bright, in Scotland, 1695. It presents a curious picture of the  
times, that the truth of the details of supernatural agency con- 
tained in this relation " is attested, as ivhat they saw, heard, and 
felt" by the ministers of Kells, Borgue, Crossmichael, Parton, 
and Kelton, and by several of the most respectable parishioners 
of Rerrick. Mr Telfair was succeeded, as minister of this parish, 
by Mr William Jameson, author of an ingenious Essay on Virtue 
and Harmony, - \M\s\\Q&amp; in 1749, and which indicates great 
metaphysical acuteness on the part of the writer. Mr Jameson 
died in 1790, and was succeeded by the late Mr James Thom- 
son. In 1818, his son, the present incumbent, was appointed 
helper and successor to his father, who closed a long life of use- 
fulness and respectability as a parish minister in 1826.

The stipend of Rerrick amounts to 16 chalders, of which L. 16 
is payable in money. The glebe extends to 16 imperial acres, 
and may be worth about L.40 per annum. The manse was built 
in 1790. An addition was made to it in 1811, and in the present 
yec\r 1844, the heritors have again put it into a state of com- 
plete repair, and have erected a new steading of offices upon 
a convenient site. The manse is in a beautiful situation, im- 
mediately contiguous to the ruins of the abbey of Dundrennan, 
while the parish church is rather inconveniently situated more 
than a mile to the eastward on the road to Orroland. 

Education. — There are two parochial schools in the parish, one 
at the village of Dundrennan, and the other at the village of Au- 
chencairn. These schools are sufficient for the reception of the 
whole children in the parish, with the exception of those resident 
in a small district to the west of Bengairn, which, however, is for- 
tunately within two miles of one of the parish schools of Kelton. 
The schoolmaster at Dundrennan has a salary of L.39, and the 
schoolmaster at Auchencairn a salary of L.21, 6s. 8d. per annum. 
Each of the schoolmasters has a free dwelling-house, and the 
average amount of annual fees in each school may be stated at 
L.70. 

Savings Banks. — There is one in the parish. The average 
sum anually invested in it during the last three years has been 
L. 169, and the average sum annually withdrawn L.62. 

Poor. — The average number of persons receiving parochial aid 
is 34, and the average weekly sum allotted to each individual is Is. 
1 |d. The average annual amount of contributions for the relief 
of the poor has been for some time past L.99, 5s., of which L.49, 
5s. is obtained from collections at the church door, — L.45 is vo- 
Juutarily contributed by the heritors, — and L.5 is drawn from le- 
gacies and mortifications. There has not hitherto been any legal 
assessment for providing for the poor in Rerrick, although it is 
not improbable this may become necessary in consequence of the 
recent investigations by the Poor Law Commissioners.

PRESBiTERY OF KIRKCUDBRIGHT, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY. 

THE REV. GEORGE PATERSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

This parish and those of Kells, Balmaclellan, and Carsphairn, 
are supposed to have been anciently united. 

Name. — The name is derived from Gaelic words signifying a 
Royal Vale,— the land being hilly on the north and east, and be- 
coming beautifully level on the left bank of the Ken, and termi- 
nating in ground called the Holm of Dairy. 

Extent, c. — From north to south, the parish is about 15 miles 
long, and, from east to west, about 7 broad. It is bounded on 
the west by Carsphairn and Kells ; on the south, by Balmaclellan 
and Kells ; on the east, by Glencairn, in the county of Dumfries ; 
on the north, by New Cumnock in Ayrshire. It contains 26,172 
Scottish, or 32,902 English acres. 

Plantations, Rivers, c— Along the Ken, which is the boun- 
dary between this parish and Kells on the west for six miles or 
more, there are oak trees of considerable size, besides a variety of 
other species of trees in belts and ornamental clumps. The prin- 
cipal river is the Ken, which takes its rise near the northern ex- 
tremity of the parish, and, running south-west eight or nine miles, 
separates Dairy from Carsphairn, till it is joined by the Deugh. 
There, taking a new direction, it runs almost south, till it meets 
with a rivulet in Kells, called Palharrow. Thence it runs nearly 
south-east through rugged rocks, with many beautiful windings, 
till It meets with the Carpel, a rivulet which, for a considerable 
way, IS the boundary between this parish and Balmaclellan. From 
Bridge of Ken to Bridge of AUan-Gibbon, its bed is rock, and 
in some places of great depth from the top of the banks. The 
Blackwater, and the rivulets of Earlston, Stronfreggan, and Loch- 
invar burn in the parish, are tributaries to the Ken ; they all abound 
in trout, and salmon is frequently caught in the Ken after speats,

and opening of the " Satterdaies Slop" in the cruives near Kirk- 
cudbright, where the Ken, after its junction with the Dee, falls 
into the sea. The lakes or lochs in the parish contain excellent 
trout, and are much resorted to by fishers. Those of Troston, 
Knocksting, Regland, Ardoch, and Knockman, are small, but 
that of Lochinvar is of considerable extent, scarce less than three 
miles in circuit, and containing an area of 50 acres. 

Geology. — Hard granite or whiiistone rock abounds through- 
out the parish ; which is rarely wrought, from the requisite quan- 
tity of stone being found in loose and detached blocks on the sur- 
face of the moor or heath land, and commonly called heathens. 
In the Hill of Barlae, near the public road, between St John's 
of Dairy and Bridge of Ken, a slate-quarry, producing blue slate 
of durable quality, and large dimensions, has been wrought for 
some years. 

Zoology. — Most of the common descriptions of small birds are to 
be found. Red grouse, blackcock and grey- hen, partridges, snipes, 
pheasants, and hares are in considerable numbers. 

n. — Civil History. 
Antiquities c. — In Lochinvar are to be seen the remains of an 
old building with bridges, said to have been a castle belonging to 
the Gordons, anciently knights of Lochinvar, and now Viscount 
of Kenmure and Lord of Lochinvar by restoration in 1824 to the 
titles forfeited in ]716. Not much above a mile from this loch, 
there is a large pile of stones covered with a whitish moss, from 
which it has probably got the name of the White Cairn. At a 
short distance from this, is another of smaller size, which is 
supposed to be a monument or trophy of an heroic achievement 
performed -by the first Knight of Lochinvar, who on that very 
spot had the good fortune to kill a wild boar which infested that 
part of the country. Near the church of Dairy, and just at the 
brink of the Ken, there is one of those eminences called moats, 
which is still almost entire, and appears to great advantage from 
the Kells side of the river. From this moat a fine view of the 
river is obtained, and of the landscapes on each side of it. There 
is another moat in Lochrenny, on the border of the parish, but it is 
not conspicuous, as it stands on low ground. In the churchyard, 
which has been recently enclosed by a substantial stone and lime 
wall, there is an aisle of the old church, now quite detached from 
the new, which is the burial place of Viscount Kenmure. There 
is also a square piece of ground inclosed, with a blackish wall 



DALRY. 



371 



about seven feet liigh, with a bowl supported by a standard at 
each corner, which is the burying place of the Newalls of Rars- 
keoch. In the farm of Stronfreggan, there is a large cairn, near 
to which, in a rivulet that runs by it, are two large stones, some- 
what resembling human figures : one of them is about ten feet 
long and quite entire ; the other is a little mutilated. In the 
farm of Altrye, near the top of a hill, there is a trench which 
seems to have been dug, capable of containing about 100 people, 
A person concealed in this trench can see to a considerable dis- 
tance, without being observed ; and the Whigs or Cameronians, 
as they are usually styled, are said to have frequently made use of 
it during the time of the persecution in Scotland, both as a place 
of refuge and of observation. Hence it obtained the name of 
the Whig Hole, which it bears to this day. At Benbreck and 
Manquhill, two contiguous farms, are the remains of buildings, 
which are said to have been the residence of an ancient branch 
of the noble family of Galloway. 

At Earlston there are the remains of a stately residence, in the 
form of a lofty square tower, which has its compeers in many parts 
of the country, and bears date over the door 1655, with the initials 
" W. G. and. M. H.;" supposed to be those of a former proprie- 
tor of name Gordon. With some repair and expense it might be 
made inhabitable, a strong oaken roof being in good repair. It is 
situated near the river Ken, and surrounded by a lawn and ex- 
tensive plantation of oak trees. " Earlston Linn" is an object of 
curiosity, and the water of the Ken falling over the rocks and then 
boiling up in the deep pools beneath, is heard at a distance. It is 
a barrier to the ascent of the salmon, large numbers falling an easy 
prey to fishermen with bag-nets. 

Modern Buildings. — The church and manse are situated within 
a mile of the southern boundary, and contiguous is a village, com- 
monly known by the name of the Clachan, though its proper name 
is St John's Town of Dairy : from its modernized appearance, 
with its white-washed and slated houses, and neat gardens, it is en- 
titled more to the latter than the former appellation. Here the 
inhabitants are numerous compared with the rural population. 
The accommodation afforded to travellers is but limited. There 
is a post office, and coaches pass through the village daily, be- 
tween Ayr and Kirkcudbright. The licensed public houses in the 
village are six in number. 
Proprietors, — The ancient valuation of the parish is L.7137, 



872 



KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE. 



6s. 8d. Scots, and the real rent, L.5682, 18s. Sterling. The pro- 
prietors are, William Forbes of Callenrlar, Esq. ; Oswald, 

Esq. of Auchencruive ; John Eden Spalding, Esq. of Holme ; 
John Shaw Alexander, Esq. of M'Kilstoun; J. Kennedy, Esq. of 
Knockknalling; John M'Turk, Esq. Knocksting; the Duke of 
Buccleuch ; Lord Glenlee ; and the successor of Mr Watt, Ken- 
bank.

1831, - 1246 

1841, - 1215 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — The crops chiefly grown are barley, oats, turnips, 
potatoes, and some rye. In proportion to the extent of the parish, 
which is pastoral, the cultivated land is small, though increasing. 
Surface drains are made to a considerable extent, and are found to 
benefit the pasture, and where drains are put in meadows the hay 
is improved as well as increased. Limeworks are from twenty to 
thirty miles distant. The roads are now generally improved and 
much extended throughout the parish. Breeding and rearing sheep 
and black-cattle are chiefly attended to, but there is little or no feed- 
ing to fat. The fences are all made of stone, and dikers and road- 
makers are numerous. The farm-houses have been generally re- 
newed of late years, and chiefly slated. The climate is salubrious 
and snow soon disappears from the hills. 

Fuel — There are no coal works, nor has coal been discovered 
in the parish. It is carted from the Dalmellington coal pits, from 
fifteen to twenty miles distant. Peat is a common article of fuel in 
the parish, but the mosses of the best quality are nearly exhausted. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The stipend is fifteen chalders, meal and 
barley in equal halves, L.9, 7s. lOd. money out of the teindsof the 
parish of Carsphairn, and L.8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. 
Extent of the glebe, 13 acres. The manse was rebuilt in 1828, 
at the cost of upwards of L. 1000, and in 1831 the church was 
also rebuilt, at an expense of about L.1400 Sterling. Six hun- 
dred of the population are attached to the Established Church, 
and about 110 to the Dissenters. 

The Rev. Alexander M'Gowan was minister of the parish for 
the period of 43 years, and died at the age of 81 in 1826. He

was succeeded by the Rev. William Anderson, who died 29th 
December 1835, and his successor is the present incumbent. 

Education. — The parochial school salary is the maximum, 
L.51, 6's. 6d., divided between two teachers, one at Smeaton 
Bridge and another at Corseglass, with' school-rooms and other 
apartments in houses recently built for them. The number of 
scholars at Smeaton Bridge is 30, and at Corseglass 12. There 
is another school, viz. the Dairy Free Grammar School, erected 
in 1658, for educating poor scholars for the university. It is at- 
tended by about 120 pupils. The endowment consists of the in- 
terest of a mortified , sum of L.970, 17s. 6d., ten acres of land, 
and a dwelling-house and school-room. School fees in certain 
cases are paid by the pupils at the first two, at the rate of 2s. per 
quarter, but none at the Free School. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of poor of 
all classes is 50. Average yearly amount of church collections for 
their behoof, L.ll ; of mortcloth dues, &amp;c. L. 1, 3s. ; of assess- 
ment, L.210.

PRESBYTERY OF KIIIKCUDBRIGHT, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY. 

THE REV. THOMAS JOHNSTONE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The word Anwoth anciently written Avonwaith 
means the course or channel of the river. The term Avon, the 
original name of the Fleet, which bounds the parish on the east, 
was changed by the Anglo-Saxons who, for four centuries previ- 
ously to 840, held possession of Galloway, into Fleet, a name of 
synonymous import.  Caledonia vol. iii. p. 339. 

Boundaries, Extent. — Anwoth is bounded on the south by Wig- 
ton and Fleet bays ; on the east, by the parish of Girthon, from 
which it is separated by the river Fleet and on the north and

west by the parish of Kirkmabreck, It is about six and a-balf miles 
long from north-east to south-west, and three and a-half broad 
from east to west. The number of acres in the parish, according 
to AinsHe's map of the Stewartry, is 9023. The ancient parish 
of Kirkdale, which lay between those of Anwoth and Kirkmabreck, 
was suppressed in 1635, and apportioned between these two pa- 
rishes, Kirkmabreck receiving the larger share. 

Topographical Appearances. — The sea-board is generally flat, 
with the exception of one place on the south at Kirkclauch ; but 
though often rocky, it has no bold headlands. In the interior of 
the parish, the surface is imeven, broken, and hilly. The most 
remarkable hill is Cairnharrow, lying partly in Anwoth and partly 
in Kirkmabreck, the height of which is 1100 feet. The soil on 
it is of a mossy kind, covered with heath intermixed with grass, 
and not much encumbered with rock. Cairnharrow is the highest 
eminence within twenty miles, with the exception of Cairnsmore 
in the parish of Minnigaff ; and its summit commands one of the 
most interesting and extensive views imaginable, — not merely the 
adjacent country and bays of Wigton and Fleet, but the Isle of Man, 
part of Cumberland, and the high land on the coast of Ireland. 
There are two natural caves in the parish, one on the farm of Kirk- 
clauch, the other on that of Auchenlarie, both on the sea shore, 
but neither of them of great extent. 

Climate. — The parish may be regarded as salubrious; but, while 
the air is mild and balmy on the sea coast, it is comparatively 
chilly and sharp on the west and north ; and snow remains on 
the tops of the hills, while it is unknown throughout the other por- 
tions of the parish. 

Hydrography —Oi the river Fleet, which bounds the parish on 
the east, a description has been already given under the article 
Girthon. The only other stream in Anwoth is Skyreburn a 
Saxon term signifying cZear hum, which rises in the farm of Ark- 
land, and, after a course of about four miles, falls into the bay of 
Fleet. Being a mountain stream, its waters rise with unusual ra- 
pidity, and swell to an extent that would do honour to a river of 
greater pretensions. " Skyreburn," says Symson, " having its 
rise from Cairnsmore and the adjacent northern mountains, will, 
even in the summer time, and in a moment almost, by reason of 
the mists and vapours in those hills, be so great, that it will be 
hardly fordable, which occasioned the proverb q[ SkyrebunC s warn- 
ing, applicable to any trouble that comes suddenly and unexpect-

edly. This sudden inundation proceeds, as said is, from the mists 
and vapours on Cairnsmore ; hence the common people say, when 
that Cairnsmore hath a hat, Falnure a small river on the opposite 
side of that mountain and Skyrehurnmay lavgh at that" — {Large 
Description of Galloioay. Salmon, cod, noud, skate, and flounders, 
are caught in the Fleet; but the fishery is on a small scale, and 
scarcely repays the expense of labour. There is a harbour in the 
parish called Boat Green ; but as it lies in the immediate neigh- 
bourhood of Gatehouse of Fleet, in the parish of Girthon, there 
is an account of it in connection with that parish. A similar re- 
mark applies to the canal recently constructed by Mr Murray of 
Broughton, M.P. for the Stewartry, in order to facilitate the naviga- 
tion to Gatehouse, and to reclaim land from the sea; the quantity of 
land so reclaimed, lying chiefly in the parish of Girthon, being 170 
acres. But it may here be mentioned, that the canal was made 
chiefly by means of persons brought by Mr Murray from his estates 
in Ireland county of Donegal, who were either tenants in arrear 
of rent, or representatives of such tenants; the total number brought 
over being about 200. They were brought over and taken back 
at Mr Murray's expense; and while he fed them comfortably dur- 
ing the progress of the work, the surplus of their wages was allowed 
as payment of rent. 

Botany. — There is nothing peculiar in the botany of the parish. 
The number of acres under wood, according to the assessment for 
the property tax, is 616, of which not above two acres on the 
estate of Rusco consist of natural timber. The whole of the 
plantations consist of copsewood, except a few acres of old wood 
around the mansion-houses of Cardoness and Ardwall, and a few 
acres of young timber around those of Kirkclauch and Rusco. 

II. — Civil History. 
Land-owners. — The land-owners are. Sir David Maxwell of 
Cardoness, Bart.; Alexander Murray of Broughton, M.P. ; Ro- 
bert Hannay of Rusco; James M'Dowall of Logan; James Mur- 
ray M'Culloch of Ardwall; David Anderson of St Germains ; 
Walter M'CuUoch of Kirkclauch; and Miss Hannay of Kirkdale. 
The seats of Mr Murray and Miss Hannay respectively are in the 
two adjoining parishes ; the former in Girthon, the latter in 
Kirkmabreck. All the other land-owners reside in the parish, 
except Mr M'Dowall of Logan, and Mr Anderson of St Ger- 
mains. The whole land of the parish, except what belongs to Mr 
Anderson and Mr Walter M'CuUoch, is under strict entail; and

no estate has changed proprietors, except by death, since the end 
of last century. The Gordons of Kenaiure and collateral branches 
of the same family, were for centuries proprietors of almost the 
whole of the parish ; but it is above a hundred years since any per- 
son of that name had property in it. 

Eminent Characters, — The most eminent person connected with 
this parish is Samuel Rutherford, who was minister of Anwotb 
from 1627 to 1639, with the exception of about eighteen months 
previously to February 1638, during which he was banished to 
Aberdeen. Of his nimierous writings, the first, namely, Exerci- 
tationes ApologeticcE pro Divina Gratia, was published in 1636, 
when he held the cure of Anwoth. It issued from a foreign 
press Amsterdam, and was dedicated to Lord Kenmure, who, 
as patron of the parish, was the means of bringing him to Gallo- 
way, and who had a seat Rusco Castle, in this parish. Ruther- 
ford was appointed Professor of Divinity in St Mary's College, 
St Andrews, in 1639 ; and, about eight years thereafter, he was 
elected Principal of that College. But the people of Anwoth 
were so anxious to retain him as their pastor, that they presented 
a strong petition to the commission of the General Assembly to 
that etfect. See the petition of " the Elderschip and Parraish- 
enerie of ye paraishen of Anweth," in Murray's Life of Ruther- 
ford, p. 353. It has appended to it 180 names. Another ap- 
plication, of a similar tendency, was laid before the same body, 
entitled " The Humble Petition of Galloway," signed by ninety- 
five persons. lb. 354. Nor was Rutherford less averse to be se- 
parated from his flock than they were to retain him, for he pre- 
sented to the commission an urgent remonstrance from himself 
against the propriety of his removal. lb. 151. These various 
applications, however, were unsuccessful, and he was removed to 
St Andrews in the year already mentioned. But, notwithstand- 
ing the lapse of upwards of two centuries, Rutherford's name is 
still held in high veneration by the people of Anwoth ; and a mo- 
nument, consisting of a square granite pyramid, has, within the 
last three years, been erected to his memory. It is placed on 
Boreland Hill, is 56 feet high, and cost L.206, 6s.

Colonel William Maxwell, son of the Rev. Mr Maxwell, mi- 
nister of Minnigaff, and the founder of the Maxwells of Cardo- 
ness, was a brave officer. He had the military command of Glas- 
gow during the Rebellion of 1715, and for his gallant services was 
presented with a piece of plate by the cities of Edinburgh and 
Glasgow, ornamented with the arms of both places. He mar- 
ried Miss Stewart of Castle- Stewart, niece to William Gordon, 
designed of Cardoness, murdered by Sir Godfrey M'Culloch. 

The late Dr Maxwell Garthshore, of London, has a claim to 
be mentioned in any account of this parish. His father, who 
was a son of Garthshore of Garthshore, a very ancient family, 
was minister of Anwoth from 1714 to 1721, when he was translat- 
ed to Kirkcudbright. Dr Garthshore died in London in 1812, at 
the age of eighty-two, having led an eminent and successful life as 
a physician. He was the author of various papers on professional 
subjects, published either in medical journals, or in the Transac- 
tions of the Royal Society of London. He married MissM'Guf- 
fog, heiress of Rusco, in this parish. His only child, a son, pre-' 
deceased him. The life of Dr Garthshore affords a striking proof 
of the eminence, wealth, and dignity, to which talents, when pro- 
perly directed, good principles, and exemplary conduct, can ele- 
vate their possessor. Murray's Literary History of Galloway

Martyr. — John Bell of Whiteside, in the parish, " was the 
only son," says Wodrow, {History, \o\. iv. p. 241, " of a gentle- 
woman, heiress of Whiteside, who, after his father's death, was 
married to the Viscount of Kenmure." He had been forfeited 
in 1680, in consequence of his having been engaged at the battle 
of Bothwell Bridge. In 1685, Bell, with Halliday of Mayfield, 
Lennox of Irelandton, and two others, were surprised by Grler- 
son of Lag, on Kirkconnell Muir, parish of Tongland, and bar- 
barously shot on the spot, " without so much as allowing them 
to pray, though earnestly desired." lb. 242. Bell was buried 
in the churchyard of Anwoth.

Antiquities. — There are two old baronial buildings in Anwoth, 
— the Tower of Rusco, and the Castle of Cardoness, — the former 
on the Fleet at the north-east of the parish, the latter on an abrupt 
eminence overlooking the bay at the mouth of the river. Both 
are of a square form, and very ancient ; but the date of their erec- 
tion cannot be ascertained. Rusco, though old and venerable, 
has recently been repaired, and is inhabited, having been let as a 
shooting residence. Cardoness has been unroofed for nearly a 
century and a half, having not been inhabited since the time of Sir 
Godfrey M'Culloch. At the south-west of the parish is a beau- 
tiful moat, standing on a steep and rocky peninsula. It has been 
completely fortified by a deep trench cut across the narrow piece 
of ground that joins it with the mainland. Near the moat, stands 
a thin stone 5 feet 3 inches high, almost perpendicular, engraved on 
both sides with the rude figure of a cross, accompanied with several 
ornamental strokes, supposed by some antiquarians to be Runic in- 
scriptions. On the top of a hill, situated near the Castle of Cardo- 
ness, and about 300 feet above the level of the sea, is a vitrified fort, 
protected on the most accessible places by a double fosse. The top, 
which forms a level area 30 paces long and 20 broad, is nearly sur- 
rounded by an irregular ridge of loose stones, which have been twisted 
and partly fused by the action of fire, and are intermixed with vast 
quantities of vitrified matter. These loose stones and vitrified 
matter are scattered irregularly over the top of the fort, and ex- 
hibit no appearance of having ever formed a continuous wall. The 
vitrification is only partial and superficial. On the south of the 
fort, there is a broad flat stone, inscribed with various waving and 
spiral lines, of which the meaning is not known. Near it were 

" Here lyes John Bell of Whyteside, who was barbarously shot to death in the 
Paroch of Tongland, at the command of Grier of Lag, anno 1685.

That blessed Bell of Whitesyde here doth lye,

 Yet cruel Lag would not let him survive.

found, about sixty years ago, several silver coins ; one of Edward 
VI. ; the rest of Queen Elizabeth. 

Under the head of antiquities may be named the old church of 
Anwoth, built in 1626. It was used as a place of worship till 
within the last twenty years. Though a new church has been 
built, the heritors, in good taste, have preserved the ancient build- 
ing, which is of a barn-like appearance, and is one of the small- 
est and most humble we have seen ; its length being 64 feet 7 
inches; its width, 18 feet 3 inches; the side walls being only 10 
feet high. The pulpit is of oak, so perforated that it is probable 
it had been used for some purpose previously to its being convert- 
ed to the use which it has so long served. Several of the seats 
are of the same wood, and most of them that are so are embel- 
lished with carving. Two may be mentioned ; one bearing the date 
of 1631, the other of 1633, — a proof that the church had been 
erected some years before the seating of it had been completed. 
The former of these was that of the family of Bell of Hinton, and 
bears the initials J. B. The latter has the letters J. W. carv- 
ed on it above the representation of the family arms. These ini- 
tials refer to John or James Walker, of whom nothing is known 
except that their names appear among the signatures to the Peti- 
tion from Anwoth in 1639. The church bell is said to have been 
a present from Lady Kenmure ; and to have been previously 
used at Rusco Castle as a dinner bell ; a thing not improbable 
from its dimensions, namely 11 inches in diameter, and 13 inches 
high. 

Bushy- Bield, the house in which Rutherford lived at Anwoth, 
and which, as the name imports, stood in a sheltered situation 
surrounded with wood, continued standing till the year 1827, 
when it was pulled down. It was of a baronial character, and 
was not, it is probable, built for Rutherford, but had previously 
been the residence of a private gentleman. It was never in the 
glebe, and the farm on which it was situated is now the property 
of Mr Murray of Broughton. 

A walk close by, which Rutherford was accustomed to fre- 

 This church was built immediately previous to Rutherford's being brought to 
Anwoth. There was no manse at this time ; nor indeed while he remained in the 
parish. The truth is, the three contiguous parishes of Anwoth, Kirkdale, and Kirk- 
mabreck, were united quoad sacra, though distinct quoad civUia, for some time at least 
before Rutherford's induction ; the cure of the three parishes being under the minis- 
try of one clergyman, Mr Dalgleish. The people of Anwoth at that time had ser- 
mon only ' everic second Sabbath, by reasone of anc most inconvenient unionc with 
uthcr twa kirkis." Life of Rutherford, p. 28.

quent, is still denominated ButlierfurcC s Walk. It was here, as 
tradition bears, where he recognized Archbishop Usher, having 
overheard him engaged in prayer on behalf of the people of his 
diocese. The tradition is as follows : — The archbishop on passing 
through Galloway, urged by the admiration he entertained for 
Rutherford's character, paid him a visit in disguise at Anwoth, 
and was most hospitably received. He arrived at Bushy-Bield 
on a Saturday, on the evening of which day the minister was in 
the habit of catechising his family on religious subjects. The 
stranger is reported to have been asked " How many command- 
ments are there " — to which he answered eleven ; and on being 
reminded that there are only ten, he quoted, in corroboration of 
the correctness of his reply, the words of our Saviour, "a new 
commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another." The 
ability of these answers surprised Rutherford. On the following 
morning the stranger was accidentally recognised. Being over- 
heard by his host, in a thicket adjoining his favourite walk, en- 
gaged in prayer, couched in language of uncommon felicity, and 
containing allusions to the people under his spiritual care, Ru- 
therford immediately thereafter took an opportunity of stating 
his suspicion as to the rank and character of his guest. Usher 
frankly confessed the truth, and explained the circumstance on 
the ground that, being anxious to see a man of whom he had 
heard so much and thought so highly, and suspecting that he 
might be averse to receive the visit of a bishop if he knew him to 
be such, he had been induced to assume a disguise to accomplish 
his object. Rutherford welcomed him with great cordiality, as a 
man venerable equally for learning and piety. He requested him 
to preach to his people, as it was Sabbath, which Usher readily 
consented to do, adopting the Presbyterian form of worship, and 
laying aside for a time the Episcopal ceremonies. His text was 
the " new commandment" mentioned above. 

There is another tradition connected with this period that can- 
not be passed over in silence. Between the church of Anwoth 
and Skvreburn there is a level piece of ground on the farm of 
Mossrobin, where the people, in Rutherford's days, were wont to 
assemble after sermon on Sabbath, and play at football ; a practice 
the minister is said not to have denounced and condemned from 
the pulpit only, but, following them to the scene of iheir amuse- 
ment, solemnly to have reproved them there, calling on the ob-

jects around bim, particularly three large stones, to witness be- 
tween them and bim, that, however they might continue to be- 
have, he had done his duty. Two of these stones still remain, 
and are known under the name of "Rutherford's witnesses." The 
history of the removal of the third is curious, and savours much 
of superstitious feelings that have not yet entirely disappeared. A 
person employed in building a fence wished to avail himself of 
these stones, when a fellow-labourer remonstrated with him on the 
subject, and warned him of the danger of laying a sacrilegious hand 
on objects so sacred. This warning he scornfully disregarded, 
and he removed one of them, uttering expressions little respectful 
to the earnest piety which had given them distinction. The re- 
sult is said to have been such as had been feared. The man soon 
after came to a violent end, which was viewed as a judgment from 
heaven, in consequence of the alleged unhallowed and profane act 
of which he had been guilty. One report says, that the person 
having declared, in answer to the warning he had received, that 
he would remove the stone ere he broke his fast, was choked with 
the first mouthful he attempted to swallow. The tradition, in one 
shape or another, is pretty generally believed by the less educated 
portion of the people. The inhabitants of Anwoth still hold these 
" witnesses" in veneration. 

It may be mentioned that, in 1574, the well-known Robert 
Campbell of Kinyeancleuch Ayrshire, accompanied by John 
Davidson, afterwards minister of Prestonpans, paid a visit to Rusco 
Castle, the residence of Sir John Gordon of Lochinvar, grandfa- 
ther of the first Lord Kenmure. Kinyeancleuch was seized with 
fever soon after his arrival, and died there in less than a fortnight's 
illness. 

Maxwell, laird of Stroquhan, Dumfriesshire, was drowned in 
the river Fleet, in 1699, under the following circumstances: He 
had been on a visit to Brown, a gentleman resident in Bushy- 
Bield, for whose daughter, Jane Brown, he was said to entertain 
an attachment. He is also said to have been unsuccessful in his 
addresses to the young lady, who afterwards became the wife of 
the Rev. Patrick Johnston, minister of Girthon, and was the 
great-grandmother of the present Right Hon. Sir Alexander John- 
ston of Carnsalloch. At all events, he is represented to have left 
Bushy- Bield abruptly, and on the evening of the same day, he was

drowned in the Fleet at a place called " Stroqulian's pool," in com- 
memoration of the mournful accident. 

Mansion-houses. — These are, Cardoness, — not the castle of that 
name, which has, for nearly a century and a half, been uninhabit- 
able, but a comparatively modern house, built by the Maxwell fa- 
mily, — Ardwall, Kirkclauch, Ruseo House, built about, the begin- 
ning of the present century, and the Tower of Rusco, which is in- 
habited, not by the proprietor, but by a tenant. 

III. — Population. 
The population in 1841 was 883; in 1831, it was 830; in 
1821, 845; in 1811, 740; in 1801, 637; and in 1755, 530.

Anwoth, and which is of recent origin, the number of inhabitants

t Mr Nicholson of Kirkcudbright, in his Historical and Traditional Talcs 1843,

is familiar to the present writer, and has taken no notice of the circumswnces above 
stated There are other discrepancies between the two versions ; but our intormant, 
a person of a most tenacious memory, a distant relative of Miss Brown, and born i 17 
years ago, near the spot where the accident happened, seems to us to be unexception- 
able authority. We refer to Elizabeth Coughtry, who was born at Tanniefad, pansli 
of Girthon, in 1727.

in the landward portion of the parish may be regarded as almost 
stationary since the period last mentioned, or for the last 80 years. 
Indeed, in 1792, previously to the existence of Fleet Street, the 
population was 492 ; so that it had actually diminished between 
these two periods. In 1841, the population of 883 consisted of 
402 males and 481 females. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculiure. — Of the 9023 acres of which the parish consists, 
about one-fourth is arable and meadow, and the remaining three- 
fourths woodlands or hill pasture. Leases generally vary in dura- 
tion from fifteen to nineteen years. The rent of arable land about 
L.l per acre; of pasture land, from 5s. to 10s. The farm tene- 
ments are, on the whole, very commodious and substantial build- 
ings; and the most approved system of agriculture prevails. The 
breed of black cattle are chiefly of the pure Galloway kind, with 
a few of Highland and Irish descent. The sheep are mostly 
of the black-faced breed, with a few Leicesters and Southdowns. 

Mines. — There is a lead mine on the estate of Rusco, which has 
been in operation at intervals for about thirty years. No great quan- 
tity of ore has been raised from it; and to most of the companies who 
have successively undertaken to work it, it has not proved a profit- 
able speculation. It is at present in the hands of a company from 
Cumberland, and report speaks favourably of its produce. The 
vein can be more or less distinctly traced across the whole parish. 
Both copper and zinc ores have been detected in the mine, but in 
small quantities. Lead has been found on the farm of Kirkbride, 
the property of Mr Murray of Broughton, and has been partially 
wrought, but with little success. 

Rental. — From the assessment for the property-tax, it appears 
that the total rental of the parish is L.4019, exclusive of the land 
and wood-land in the possession of the proprietors, which may 
amount to about L. .526, making the aggregate rental L. 4545. 
The total rental, according to the old Statistical Account, pub- 
lished in 1794, was L.2200; so that the value of land in the pa- 
rish has more than doubled within the last fifty years. 

Wages. — The annual wages of a good agricultural servant, un- 
married, are between L.IO and L.12, including victuals; of a 
good cot-man, with a house and garden, but exclusive of victuals, 
between L.20 and L.24 ; and of a good female servant, between 
L.5 and L.6 with victuals. The wages of an able labourer, 
exclusive of victuals, average Is. 6d. per day in summer, and 



KIRKCUDBIIIGHTSIIIRE. 



Is. 41. in winter ; and a female's wages, also without victuals, 
average about 8d. per day for turnip work, lOd. per day for hay, 
and Is. 6d. for harvest work. The number of agricultural la- 
bourers in the parish is about 45 ; of artisans, about 20. There 
are no able-bodied labourers who cannot find employment. The 
price of meal is from Is. 6d. to Is. 8d. per imperial stone ; of po- 
tatoes, l'2s. per boll ; of coals, L.l, 3s. per ton of 36 cwt. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-town. — The market-town of Gatehouse is divided from 
the parish by the Fleet.; of which, indeed, a considerable portion, 
called Fleet Street, lies on the Anwoth side of the river. There 
is no village nor post-office in the parish. Gatehouse being the post 
town. 

Roads. — The turnpike road between Dumfries and Portpatrick 
runs through the parish, nearly along the line of the shore. Pre- 
viously to its being opened about forty years ago, the public road 
was most inconvenient, and almost impracticable. It left the shore 
at Gatehouse, and, regardless of hills or any obstruction, it went 
by a somewhat irregular line over the Corse of Slakes, an eminence 
about 800 feet above the level of the sea. The distance from 
Gatehouse to Creetown is three miles and a-half greater, but the 
road is nearly a dead level, and is one of the best in Scotland, af- 
fording one of the most beautiful and picturesque drives that can 
easily be imagined. Some of the parish roads are good ; others 
are much neglected. A mail coach passes through the parish 
daily, to and from Dumfries and Portpatrick respectively. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated rather more 
than a mile from Gatehouse, and about half a mile inland from 
the Fleet. It was built about seventeen years ago on a piece of 
ground about 250 yards from the old venerable structure, and is 
most substantial and commodious. The manse, which of late has 
undergone extensive repairs, and is a superior building, is within 
a quarter of a mile from the church. The glebe contains about 
7 acres ; and the stipend, according to the Report of the Com- 
missioners of Religious Instruction in Scotland, is L. 247, 10s. 7d. 
leaving a surplus of vacant teinds to the amount of L. 41, 18s. Id. 
The stipend, however, is variable, as all the proprietors, except 
those of Cardoness and Kirkdale, who pay in money, are assessed 
according to the Bar's prices. Sir David Maxwell of Cardoness is 

 We may state that the stipend, in Rutherford's time, consisted of 200 nicrks 
Scots, about L.l I Sterling, derived from the teinds of the parish, and of a volun- 
tary contributioa on the part of his hcareis. — Life of Rulherford, p. 41 .

the patron. The number of communicants in the parish church 
has not of kite years been less than 250, nor more than 300. 
There is a Dissenting chapel in Anvvoth at Fleet Street, belong- 
ing- to the Secession, but only about forty persons in the parish 
attend it. The number of Roman Catholics is about 20. There 
are a few " Free Church" adherents in the parish, who attend 
public worship in Gatehouse. The following is a list of the mi- 
nisters of the parish since the Revolution : Michael Bruce, 1689 ; 
Thomas Hay, 1696 ; George Garthshore, 1714 ; William Ainslie, 
1724 ; John Welsh, 1727; Robert Carson, 1753 ; William Gov- 
done, 1770; Hugh Gordon, 1790; Thomas Turnbull, 1809; 
Thomas Johnstone, 1839. 

Education. — There is one parish school with the maximum sa- 
lary, besides two Sabbath schools. The salary of the parochial 
teacher is the maximum. There are 20 children whose parents 
are unable to pay school fees, who receive their education gratis. 

Poor. — The number of paupers on the permanent roll is 16 ; 
on the occasional, 6. There is no legal assessment. The church 
collections on Sabbath average fully L. 40 yearly ; and there is an 
annual income of L. 4, 10s. 4d. from a mortification ; in addition to 
which there is a small sum, varying in amount, from the Usual 
parochial sources. But the heritors voluntarily contribute such a 
sum additional generally about L. 30 as may be required for the 
support of the poor. From the poor's funds are paid the salaries 
of the precentor, beadle, session- clerk, presbytery and synod clerks 
and presbytery officer. The total sum disbursed in 1843 was 
L. 80. Mr Murray of Broughton makes an annual allowance to 
a medical man for attending the poor, both in Girthon and An- 
woth. There is no pawnbroker's shop in the parish ; nor is there 
any begging on the part of the inhabitants. 

Inns.— Theve are two inns, both in Fleet Street. 
Savings Bank. — There is no institution of this kind in the pa- 
rish ; but not a few of the parishioners take advantage of the sav- 
ings bank in Gatehouse. 

LibravT/.— -There is one circulating library in the parish. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Anwoth, from its being chiefly a pastoral parish, has perhaps 
undergone as few changes within the last fifty years as any other 
district in the south of Scotland. There are, however, some de- 
partments in which a favourable contrast may be drawn, within 
that period. A new turnpike road has been made throuo-h the

parish ; and the old line by the Corse of Slakes which was by 
far the steepest and the longest road-ascent in Galloway, has 
been virtually abandoned ; the Fleet canal has been con- 
structed ; a new church and manse have been built ; the church 
collections have risen from L.14 to L.40; the stipend has been 
tripled; the schoolmaster's salary has advanced from L.ll to 
L,34, 4s. 4d. ; the rental of the parish has been doubled ; the 
houses of the farmers, and their general style of living, have been 
much improved ; superstitious opinions aregreatly weakened, if 
not eradicated, unless on the part of the older portion of the po- 
pulation, or in the more remote and thinly inhabited districts of 
the parish ; the wages of labour have increased about 25 per 
cent., while the price of the leading articles of food, meal and 
potatoes, for example, is about the same as in 1794; butcher- 
meat being a little higher, but clothing much cheaper. Indeed 
as to female servants, their wages are stated at L.l, 15s. per half 
year at that date: They now vary from L.2, 10s. to L.3. Peat 
was the only fuel used in the parish, except by the resident 
heritors, in 1794 ; about equal quantities of coal brought from 
the opposite coast of Cumberland and peat are now burnt. The 
number of paupers, however, has risen, within the last fifty years, 
from 10 to 21. The church collections, and the usual parochial 
revenue were, in 1794, sufficient for their relief; now, though all 
these sources of income have becoine more ample, the heritors 
have to advance a yearly sum of about L.30. On the whole, 
however, the standard of living and the means of comfort among 
all classes are greatly elevated, and the character and condition 
of the people have been improved.

This Stewartry is situate betwixt 54° 43' and 55° 19' north 
lat., and 3° 33' and 4° 34' west long. It is bounded on the north, 
by the shires of Dumfries and Ayr ; on the east and south, by the 
Solway Frith and the Irish Sea ; on the west, by the county of 
Wigton. It extends from east to west above 48 miles ; and its 
breadth varies from 17 to 30 miles. It contains about 882 square 
miles. About two-thirds of the surface is mountainous ; and it is 
calculated that about 110,000 acres are cultivated. 

The valued rent is L. 114,637, 2s. Scots. The real rent in 
1831 amounted to L.213,308. 

The Stewartry has a constituency of 1336, and sends one mem- 
ber to Parliament. The population in 1841 amounted to 41,119.

PRKSBYTRRY OF WIGTON, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY. 

THE REV. PETER YOUNG, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name is supposed to be compounded of the Saxon 
words Wic, a village, and Ton a hill, denoting the loca,l situation 
of the town, which is seated on an eminence, about 200 feet above 
the level of the sea, commanding an extensive view of the bay of 
Wigton, of the stewartry of Kirkcudbright, of the distant hills of 
Cumberland, and of the Isle of Man. The hill on which the 
town is situated contains about 200 acres of arable land of the 
best quality, not surpassed by any hill of the same extent in the 
south of Scotland. Wigton was made a royal burgh in the reign 
of David II. This honour was probably conferred on it in the 
year 1341, when it wa established as the chief town of the earl- 
dom or county of Wigton, conferred on Sir Malcolm Fleming; 
whence the noble family of Wigton. The title became extinct in 
1747, having terminated in a female. 

Extent mid Boundaries. — The parish, which is between five 
and 6 miles long, and about 4 miles broad, is supposed to con- 
tain about 5500 acres. It is bounded on the south by the river 
Bladenoch, which separates it from the parish of Kirkinner ; on 
the west, by a small rivulet and a morass, dividing it from the pa- 
rish of Penningham ; on the north, by the Bishop Burn, which 
runs between it and the last mentioned parish ; and on the east, by 
the bay of Wigton and the Frith of Cree. 

Geology. — The rocks in this parish belong to the transition 
class, chiefly greywacke and greywacke slate. 

II. — Civil History. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners are, the Earl of Gallo- 
way ; Stewart of Physgill ; M' Culloch of Torhouse ; Hagart of Tor- 
housekie ; and M'Haffie of Torhousemuir. 

The borough of Wigton has also a considerable property in the 
parish, and there are several smaller proprietors who possess por-

tions of land, called borough-acres, most of whom reside in the 
town or neighourhood. 

Parocliial Registers. — The earliest bears date 1701, and is 
brought down to 1740. After this period, it has been irregularly 
kept, and much neglected until 1800. 

Antiquities. — One of the most remarkable monuments of antiquity 
in the parish is the Standing Stones of Torhouse. It is one of those 
circles of large stones supposed by some to be the remains of Druidic 
temples, by others courts of justice, and reckoned by not a few to 
mark the spot where a battle has been fought, and where the chiefs 
have been slain and buried. The stones are nineteen in number, 
and of unpolished granite. " In the highway betwixt Wigton and 
Port- Patrick," says Symson in his Description of Galloway, writ- 
ten in 1684, " about three miles westward of Wigton, is a plaine, 
called the ' Moor of Standing Stones of Torhouse,' in which there 
is a monum.ent of three large whinstones, called King Galdus's 
Tomb, surrounded, at about twelve feet distance, with nineteen 
considerable great stones, but none of them so great as the three 
first mentioned erected in a circumference." This opinion, which 
has obtained the sanction of the celebrated antiquarian. Sir Ro- 
bert Sibbald, of Timothy Pont, seems the most probable, if not al- 
together certain, See his " Galloway Typographized," and other 
writers. As these Standing Stones are supposed to constitute a 
monument to the memory of Galdus, King of the Scots, who con- 
quered the province from the Romans, so there are several heaps 
of small stones in the neighbourhood, called Cairns, alleged to 
mark the burial-place of the common soldiers. There are also 
several single stones of considerable size erected at different spots 
in the vicinity, which a:re regarded as indicating the tombs of the 
commanders and persons of note that fell in the engagement. 
Sibhald's MSS. Adv. Lib. Jac. 5th 1. 4J 

Of the Castle of Wigton, which was built as early at least as 
the middle of the thirteenth century, scarcely any traces can now 
be found. It is understood to have been situated on the banks of 
the Bladenoch, south of the town, at a place where in ancient 
times that river fell into the bay. The fosse is quite discernible ; 
and though the foundation of the walls cannot be traced, mortar 
and other remains, indicative of an ancient building, are still to be 
observed. So important was this castle, that it was delivered in 
1291 into the hands of Edward I., till the claims of the different 
competitors for the crown were decided. He entrusted it to the 



WIGTON. 



3 



charge of Walter de Currie, Laird ofDunskey, and successively 
of others, and ultimately conferred it on John Baliol as the Scot- 
tish Kin Of. 

Wigton was the site of a monastery, founded in 1267, for Do- 
minican or Black Friars by Dervorgille, daughter of Alan, last of the 
provincial Lords of Galloway, and mother of John Baliol, King of 
Scotland. This monastery never attained to eminence. Mur- 
ray's Literary History of Galloway, 2d ed. 1832. It was situated 
on the east of the burgh, terminating on an abrupt ridge overlook- 
ing the bay, but no remains of it can now be traced. There was 
a large cemetery connected with it, where, within these sixty years, 
bones and other sepulchral remains have been dug up. Even in 
1684, when Symson wrote, " the very ruines thereof are now al- 
most ruined." 

In the present churchyard, there is an interesting monument 
erected to the memory of two female martyrs, who, on the 1 1 th 
May 1685, were tied to a stake within the flood-mark, at the 
mouth of the Bladenoch, near Wigton, and drowned, for not ab- 
juring Presbytery and the National Covenant, and not conforming 
to Prelacy. They were Margaret Wilson, aged 18, daughter 
of Gilbert Wilson, farmer in Glenvernock, parish of Penningham, 
and Margaret M'Lauchlan, aged 63, widow of John Milligan, 
Wright in Drumjargan, parish of Kirkinner. A younger sister of 
Wilson was also condemned at the same time, but, owing to her 
tender age, being only 13 years old, she was liberated, her fa- 
ther having given a bond of L. 100 Scots that he would produce 
her when called. The three were tried at Wigton before Sir Ro- 
bert Grierson of Lagg, Colonel David Graham, brother to the 
famous Claverhouse, Major Windram, and Captain Strachan; 
persons nominated by the King as a commission to try non-con- 
formists, with power of life or death.  Wodrow's Church History, 
Vol. iv. p. 6. Coltron, Provost of Wigton, acted as a constituent 
member of the commission, {ih. p. 248. The barbarous sentence 
to which we have referred was carried into effect on Margaret 
Wilson and Margaret M'Lauchlan ; Major Windram with some 
soldiers guarding them to the place of execution. The stake to 
which M'Lauchlan, the elder prisoner, was tied, being a good way 
beyond the other, she died first. When the water was nearly co 
vering the younger martyr, she was asked by Windram's or- 
der, if she would pray for the King. Knowing that an answer in 
the affirmative would be equivalent to a renouncement of her

sentiments and a violation of her conscience, she rephed, " she 
wished the salvation of all men, and the damnation of none." One 
of the spectators, deeply affected with the death of the one martyr, 
and the approaching dissolution of the other, said, " Dear Mar- 
garet, say, God save the King,— say, God save the King." With 
the greatest firmness and presence of mind, she immediately re- 
plied, " God save him if he will, for it is his salvation I desire." 
These words were not regarded by Windram explicit enough ; and 
though the heroic Christian martyr was again tried to recant, she 
mildly but firmly refused. " Upon which," says Wodrow, {ib. she 
was thrust down again into the water, where she finished her course 
with joy." 

At what time the monument to the memory of these two " faith- 
ful witnesses'' was erected in the church-yard of Wigton cannot 
be ascertained. But from the orthography and style of the in- 
scription, it must have been soon after the Revolution. The m- 
scription is subjoined. 

" Here lyse Margrat Wilson, Doughter to Gilbert Wilson in 
Glenvernach, who was drouned Anno 1685, aged 18." 

« Here lys Margrat M'Lauchlan, who was by injust law con- 
demned to die by Lagg, Strachan, Winram and Grahame, ty'd to 
a stake within the flood for her adherence to Scotland's reforma- 
tion and national and solem league, aged 63." 

There is another martyr's tomb in this church-yard. This tomb 
is to the memory of three individuals belonging to the parish of 
Penninghame,— William Johnston, gardener to the Laird of Fm- 
tilloch, John Milroy, chapman, living at Fintilloch, and George 
Walker, servant -in Kirkauly, who being brought to Wigton, and 
not answering satisfactorily the question put to them by Wmdram, 
particularly refusing to attend the ministry of the curate, were, 
without an assize or trial, caused to be publicly executed next day. 
The inscription on their monument is subjomed.f

There are 3 fatuous, and 4 blind persons in the parish. 

Character of the People. — The inhabitants, with the exception 
of the Irish settlers, are nearly all natives either of the burgh or 
county. The names of families that are still most prevalent 
injjWigton, such as M'Kinnell, M'Kie, &amp;c., were the predomi- 
nant names so early as the year 1495. MS. Advocates' 
Library, Jac. V. 8. 8. The condition of the people has been 
greatly improved since the time of the last Statistical Account. 
They are now more cleanly in their habits, more comfortably 
lodged, and in consequence of a more easy communication, and of 
a more frequent intercourse with other districts of the country, 
both their diet and their dress are of a better description. Of 
the moral character of the inhabitants of this parish, a favourable 
account may justly be given. They are, in general, intelligent and 
well informed. They have access, upon moderate terms, to a well- 
selected subscription library, established in 1794. With the pro- 
gress of society, and the more extensive diffusion of knowledge, 
their morality has also kept pace. Their attendance upon the or- 
dinances of religion is devout and exemplary, and, upon the whole, 
their habits are regular and temperate. When cases of distress 
occur, they uniformly evince a liberal and benevolent spirit. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — Since the time of the last Statistical Account 
much additional ground has been brought into cultivation, and new 
and improved modes of husbandry have been adopted. The num- 
ber of acres in the parish, cultivated and uncultivated, the writer 
cannot precisely ascertain. 

Produce. — The following table gives a near computation for the 
year 1833, of the produce of this parish, the rental of which is 
about L. 4500.

Manufactures. — At the village of Bladenoch, about a mile from 
the town, there is a distillery, which consumes yearly about 16,000 
bushels of barley, in the manufacture of whisky. About 20 la- 
bourers are employed in it, exclusive of tradesmen. 

Navigation. — The harbour is witlin a quarter of a mile of the 
town. The harbour dues are let by the magistrates for L. 26 per 
annum, which is expended in defraying the expenses of building 
and repairing the same. There were about fourteen vessels be- 
longing to Wigton, containing about 883 tons burden, for the year 
ending January 1, 1832. There were seventy-six vessels outward 
bound, the amount of their cargoes 5017 tons, and ninety vessels 
inward, amounting to 6220 tons. The quantity of grain shipped, 
from 29th September 1829 until 29th September 1830, was 1453 
bolls of 12 bushels each, 60 bolls of potatoes, 120 bolls oatmeal. 
From September 29, 1830 to September 29, 1831, 780 bolls 
grain, 12 bushels to the boll. 

A steam-boat plies betwixt this and Whitehaven, and between 
this and Liverpool once a fortnight, during the year. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
The town of Wigton has undergone great improvements withm 
the last twenty years. Many new houses have been built, and a 
large space of an oblong figure, in the middle of the principal street, 
which is unusually wide, has been enclosed, and planted with 
shrubs, evergreens, and forest trees. There are spacious gravel 
walks in it, and a bowling-green in the centre. The Parliamentary 
constituency amounts to 107. The corporation revenue is about 
L. 350 per annum. The number of inhabited houses in the town 
is 403. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The first church in Wigton was conse- 
crated to St Machute, an obscure saint, who died in 554. It ori- 
ginally belonged to the priory of Whithorn, but was afterwards a 



VVIGTON. 



7 



free rectory, of which the King was patron. There is a manuscript 
in the Advocates' Library, Jac. V. 8. 8, in which a donation is 
mentioned in the year 1495, from William M'Garvey, vicar of 
Penningham, of various houses and crofts in or near the burgh, 
which are minutely described, to support "a chaplain in St Ma- 
chutus in Wigtoun." The celebrated Sir Peter Young, the co- 
preceptor with Buchanan of James VI. for some time held the rec- 
tory of Wigton in commendam. At what time the present church 
was built, we have not ascertained. It is an old mean-looking edi- 
fice, and has so frequently been repaired that little of the ancient 
building remains. It is situated in a beautiful retired spot at the 
east end of the town, and at the extremity of the parish. The sti- 
pend is 18 chalders, half meal, half barley, and L. 8, 6s. 8d. for 
communion elements. There is no manse, but L. 30 per annum 
is allowed for a house rent, one-half of which is paid by the he- 
ritors, and the other by the burgh. The glebe contains 7 acres, 
and is worth about L. 21 per annum. 

There is also a meeting-house of the General Associate Sy- 
nod, in which there is accommodation for about 600 sitters. At 
an election of a pastor lately, about 120 members were found 
qualified to vote. The number of Dissenting and Seceding fa- 
mihes in the parish is about 66. The number of families attend- 
ing the Established Church about 240 ; the number of Roman 
Catholic families about 25. 

Education. — There is an excellent grammar-school in this town, 
conducted by an able teacher and assistant. The emolument 
arising from salary and school-fees is upwards of L. 100 per an- 
num. The number of scholars is from 80 to 100. The usual 
branches of education are taught, viz. English, Latin, Greek, 
French, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, and mathematics. Be- 
sides the pubhc schools, there are two unendowed schools, whose 
teachers depend upon the school fees. There are also two Sun- 
day schools, attended by nearly 300 children. The total number 
of scholars attending schools in the parish is about 450. 

Banks. — The Bank of Scotland first opened a branch in Wig- 
ton in 1784. There are now a branch of the British Linen Com- 
pany, and a private bank. 

Charitable Institutions.— A Friendly Society was instituted here 

in 1795. The terms of admission are 10s. 6d. from the age 

of 18 until 25. From 25 until 40, 6d. more for every year of 

their age above 25 ; and no person after the age of 40 is admitted.

The monthly contribution is 7d. No member is admitted to 
the superannuated list so long as he is able to work. Those on 
the sick list are allowed 4s. per week for the first three months, 3s. 
for the next three months, and afterwards 2s. per week ; and they 
are still liable to pay the monthly contributions. The sum of L. 4 
is allowed for the funeral of each member, or they may draw L. 2 
of the above sum when the wife dies. The funds at interest are 
L. 600. More than a third part of the members reside in the pa- 
rish. To prevent the funds from being dilapidated, they have 
agreed that every person alimented shall submit to a rateable re- 
duction if necessary. The funds have hitherto been equal to the 
demand. This institution has obvious and undoubted advantages. 
It encourages a spirit of independence, and stimulates to industry, 
and prevents many from becoming a burden upon the community. 

Poor. — The average number of poor upon the roll in the year 
1837 was 34, and the total amount applied was L. 96. The church 
collections average for the last three years L. 52, 6s. 2d. per an- 
num. There is no assessment, but a voluntary contribution by 
the heritors for some years averaged L. 72, 6s. 8d., and L. 7 more 
were received from other parties. The amount from a mortified 
sum of L. 600 is L. 24 annually. The number of poor receiving 
occasional relief is 14, and the amount applied to them is L. 60. 

The great influx of Irish labourers and vagrants into this dis- 
trict operates heavily upon the poor's funds, and there is little pros- 
pect of that evil being corrected, while there is no legal provision 
for the indigent in that country. 

Prisons. — The prison has long been complained of as insecure 
and unhealthy. An addition and considerable repairs have been 
for some time past in contemplation. 

Fairs. — There are five in the course of the year ; but there is 
little or no business done in them, and they are now fallen into 
complete neglect. 

Fuel. — The parish is well supplied with fuel — both with peats 
from a neighbouring moss, and with excellent coals, at a moderate 
price, from Whitehaven.

<p>

PKESBYTERY OF WIGTON, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY. 

THE REV. JAMES REID, MINISTER. 

1. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The popular tradition respecting the name of the pa- 
rish is as follows. In former times, the parish of Kirkinner in- 
cluded in it what now forms the parish of Kirkcowan. The clergy- 
man preached two Sundays at the church in the southern part of 
the parish, and the next in another place of worship, in the north- 
ern part of it. In those days, the one was distinguished as thelnner 
Kirk, hence the name Kirkinner; the other was called the Outer Kirk, 
which in course of time was changed into Kirk-cowan, and now forms 
the parish of that name. Chalmers, in his Caledonia, however, gives 
avery different account of the matter. He tells us, that the ancient 
church of Kirkinner was consecrated to Saint Kenneir, Virgin and 
Martyr, who suffered martyrdom at Cologne, October 29th 450. 
Hence the name of the parish Kirkinner.' This church was grant- 
ed by Edward Bruce, the Lord of Galloway, to the prior and can- 
nons of Whithorn, and the grant was confirmed by King Robert I. 
In the charter it is called the church of Saint Kenere of Carnes- 
moel. This seems to have been the name of a barony, for we 
learn from Chalmers that, " before the demise of David II., 
the Earl of Wigton resigned his whole earldom into the King's 
hands, except the barony of Carnesmull, and that after the acces- 
sion of Robert II. this resignation was repeated and accepted ; 
whereupon the King, in April 1 372, granted a charter to Sir James 
Lindsay, for the earldom, as the same had been held by the first 
earl, except the four pleas of the crown, and the barony of Carnes- 
mull. Kirkinner formed the benefice of the subdean of the chapel 
royal. In Bagimont's roll, as it stood in the reign of James V., 
Kirkinner was taxed L. 26, I3s. 4d. being a tenth of the estimated 
value. This was the highest of any parochial benefice in Wig- 
tonshire. In 1591, James VI. granted the patronage of this 



10 



WIGT0N8HIRE. 



church to Sh Patrick Vans of Barnbarroch, and this grant was ra- 
tified by Parhament in June 1592." 

Kirkinner now consists of the united parishes of Kirkinner and 
Longcastle. Longcaster or Longcastle parish obtained its name 
from an ancient castle, the ruins of which are still extant on a 
small island in a lake called Longcastle Loch. The name ap- 
pears to have been written Longcaster, at the epoch of the Refor- 
mation. The church was then a rectory. Longcastle continued 
to be a separate parish in 1630, but, being of small extent, it was 
annexed to the adjacent parish of Kirkinner about the middle of 
the seventeenth century. It forms the south-west corner of the 
united parish. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The mean length of the parish is about 
5 miles ; its mean breadth about 4 ; it contains nearly 24 square 
miles. It is bounded on the north and north-west, by the parishes 
of Wigton, Penningham, and Kirkcowan ; on the west, by Moch- 
rum ; on the south-west, by Glasserton ; on the south, by Sorbie ; 
on the east and north-east, by the Bay of Wigton. It may be com- 
pared to a section of a pyramid, the base running nearly from north 
to south, and the top lying along the bay of Wigton. 

Topographical Appearance. — In appearance, the country is 
hilly, but cannot be termed mountainous. With the exception of 
what are called the low lands, the greater part of the parish con- 
sists of gently swelling little hills, which, covered with rich verdure, 
or crowned with plantation, give a pleasing variety to the prospect. 
Standing on the top of one of these elevations, you may count a 
dozen others, all rising around ; but none of them are of great 
height above the level of the sea. 

The extent of coast along the bay of Wigton is about 3 miles ; 
the shore is flat, of a deep clay soil. 

Meteorology. — Temperature of the atmosphere for the last two 
years and a half, taken at Low Balfern, nearly on a level with the 
bay of Wigton. The calculations are made twice a day, in summer 
at five o'clock in the morning, in winter at sunrise, and every day 
at two o'clock afternoon.

Rain falls often, and in considerable quantities, but it seldom 
rains a whole day without intermission. The prevailing winds 
are the south and south-west. Our severest storms of rain, 
wind, and snow, are from the south-east. We have sometimes a 
heavy gale from the north-west, but it seldom lasts long, and com- 
monly falls in the evening,— hence the saying common in the 
country, " that an honest man, and a north-west wind, generally go 
to sleep together." 

The climate, when compared with that of the north-western 
counties of Scotland, may be considered rather dry than moist. 
Before the low lands were drained, the people who lived on them 
were often affected with ague, but the parish is now very healthy. 
Alexander M'Credie died, in 1824, at the very advanced age of 
108. 

Hydrography. — The parish is bounded on the eastfor about three 
miles by the bay of Wigton, which separates it from the parish of 
Kirkmabreck in the stewartry of Kirkcudbright. At full-tide the 
bay is 7 or 8 miles in width. The tide also flows up the water of 
Bladenoch for about two miles. There is a mineral spring on the 
estate of Barnbarroch, which is often used by the inhabitants for 
stomach complaints. It was formerly considered to be of great use in 
curing the ague. Another spring of a similar nature has lately 
been discovered on the same estate. They seem both to be impreg- 
nated with iron. The parish in general, but particularly about the 
church, is celebrated for numerous and copious springs of soft and 
light water, which must contribute much to the health of the in- 
habitants. On the south-west side of the parish lies the lake or 
loch of Dowalton, called also Ravenston and Longcastle. It is 
about two miles long, by one and a-half broad. It contains two 
small islands, both on the Kirkinner side. 

The river Bladenoch forms the boundary of the parish for 
many miles. It takes its rise in Loch Mabearee, on the borders 
of Ayrshire, receives the tributary streams of Malzie and Mild- 
riggen in this parish, and, after a winding course of about twenty 
miles, falls into the bay of Wigton, near that town. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The soil is in general gravelly, and 



12 



WIGTONSIIIRE. 



the subsoil of the same nature. The low lands of Baldoon are 
an extensive tract of alluvial soil, evidently formed of substances 
carried down by the river, and thrown back by the tide, mixed 
with clay, shells, and sand. In winter, after a strong south-east- 
erly wind, immense quantities of cockle shells are thrown up by 
the tide. These are often used as manure by the farmers, and 
when burnt they furnish the only lime which the country affords. It 
is reckoned whiter for plaster, and also of a more binding nature for 
building and rough-cast than the common lime, which is imported 
from England. There is not much moss in the parish, and it con- 
tains no mines whatever. Good stones for building are very scarce. 
The stratified rocks in this parish belong to the transition series : 
the only granite it contains is found in single stones, and these 
are now seldom to be met with. 

Zoology. — Many years ago, there were found in the moss of 
Airies, a pair of immense horns, the tips of which are said to have 
been six feet separate from each other. These must have be- 
longed to some animal now unknown here. 

Salmon, trout, and spirlings are found in the Bladenoch. The 
loch of Dowalton or Longcastle contains pike and perch, and floun- 
ders are sometimes caught along the shore of the bay of Wigton. 

Trees. — Most kinds of forest trees seem to thrive well. The 
beech, theash, the plane, and the Huntingdon willow attain to a 
great size. 

11. — Civil History. 
There is an ancient account of the parish in a work by Andrew 
Symson, minister of Kirkinner, 1684. It is entitled " A large 
Description of Galloway." A few copies have lately been printed 
from the manuscript in the Advocates' Library.— Mr Symson was 
Episcopal minister of this parish from 1663 to 1686, when the 
state of the times obliged him to leave it. He afterwards became 
a printer in Edinburgh, and died in 1712. He was the author of 
several poetical works. Vide Life prefixed to his Large Descrip- 
tion of Galloway : also Murray's Literary History of Galloivmj, 
2d edit. 1832. 

The family of Barnbarroch have given two bishops to Galloway. 
Alexander Vaux was consecrated Bishop of Galloway some time 
before the year 1426. His name is mentioned by Rymer, and 
Buyce terms him a learned man, and of noble extraction. In 1429, 
he was appointed by James I. one of the preservers of the peace 
on the borders of Scotland ; and he is said to have contributed

much to the overthrow of the then all-powerful family of Doug- 
Ijg George Vaux, cousin to Alexander, was also Bishop of Gal- 
loway. It 'was during the time of this prelate that James IIL 
having founded a chapel-royal at Stirhng, annexed it to the Bi- 
shoprick of Galloway. Sir Patrick Vaux of Barnbarroch was am- 
bassador to Denmark in the time of James VI., and a Lord of 
Session. 

The inhabitants of this parish seem to have had their full 
share of trouble and distress in the days of persecution. From 
the session record, April 15th 1711, we learn that the minister 
gave in the account of the sufferings of honest, godly people in the 
late times, which was read, and is as follows : " Margaret Lauchli- 
son, of known integrity and piety from her youth, aged about eighty, 
widow of John Millikin, wrightin Drumjargan, was, in or about the 
year 1685, in her own house, taken off her knees in prayer, and car- 
ried immediately to prison, and from one prison to another, with- 
out the benefit of light to read the Scripture ; was barbarously 
treated by dragoons, who were sent to carry her from Machirwood 
to Wigtoun, and being sentenced by Sir Robert Grier of Lagg to 
be drowned at a stake within the flood-mark, just below the town 
of Wigtoun, for conventicle-keeping, and alleged rebellion, was, 
according to the said sentence, fixed to the stake till the tide made, 
and held down within the water, by one of the town-officers by his 
halbert at her throat, till she died. 

" Her husband, John Millikin, when he lived in Killeal, being 
frequently quartered on by the soldiers, was obliged to pay to six 
of them eight shillings Scots to each man, ilk day, for a consider- 
able time, and afterwards was carried prisoner to Dumfries, where 
he was fined in a considerable sum. 

" Andrew M'Cubbin and his spouse Elizabeth Millikin, daughter 
to the said John Millikin and Margaret Lauchlison, about 1685, 
were stript of all their goods, had all their household furniture 
burnt to ashes by the dragoons, and themselves and their small 
children banished from house and hold. 

" Alexander Vaux of Barwhannie, brother-german to John Vaux 
of Barnbarroch, and Margaret Maxwell, his lady, who afterwards 
became Laird and Lady of Barnbarroch, from 1666 to 1689, the 
time of the late happy revolution, were harassed, processed, and 
fined, though there was nothing could be laid to their charge, but 
that they would not comply with .the times, and did resett godly 
people and ministers.

WIGTONSHIRE. 



" William Sprot in Clutoch being, about 1685, obliged to leave 
his own house to shun persecution and went to Portpatrick on his 
way to Ireland, and then at Portpatrick was apprehended and 
brought back on his feet betwixt two dragoons, exactly by his own 
house-door to Wigtoun prison ; his wife being big with child, fol- 
lowed him to the said prison, when she saw him laid on his back, 
in the cold prison, put in the irons, his ears cut off, his fingers 
burnt by fiery matches ; and afterwards he was sentenced to be 
banished to America, and in his voyage thither he died. He was 

person eminent for piety. His poor wife for grief miscarried 
of her child. 

« John Stuart in Kirkbien, about anno 1685, of known piety, was 
stript of all his goods and gear, 

" William Kerr in Borland, anno 1685, was imprisoned with the 
said Margaret Lauchlison, and made his escape. 

" John Dunn in Stewartown, about the year 1685, of singular piety, 
was imprisoned and banished, and in his voyage died at sea; and 
Janet Dunn, his daughter, was carried prisoner to Glasgow, and 
before she was carried there, had her fingers burnt with fiery 
matches, and wedged into wimble bores. 

« Margaret Maxwell, servitrix to Alexander Vaux of Barwhannie 
was imprisoned at Wigtoun about 1685, and scourged there three 
several times by the hand of the common hangman, and afterwards 
carried prisoner to Glasgow, in order to banishment. 

« Margaret Middinel, about the same time imprisoned ; she 
lived in the Meikle Airies. 

« Agnes M'Culloch, in Stewartown, spouse to Anthony Ha- 
thorn, was fined in two or three hundred merks. 

« John M'Reikie, in Newton, about the same time was fined. 
" Andrew Martin of Little Airies, about the year 1679, was de- 
clared a rebel for going to Bothwell, was forfeited, his house fre- 
quently plundered, his corns eaten up by dragoons and their 
horses, till his wife, Margaret Kennedy, who remained in his 
house for some years after the forfaulture, was necessit to forbear 
manureing the ground, in regard that the product was still an er- 
rand for the soldiers to come there, she could preserve no stock, 
save some few sheep, for want of fodder. There was no way left to 
the said Margaret Kennedy to support herself and chddren, but 
by improving the wool and milk of the sheep, which was all they 
had to subsist on for years. But she refusing to take the oath of 
abjuration, and other oaths then generally imposed on men and

women in their bounds, through the malice and cruelty of those that 
were in public place, was taken prisoner, and through prudence 
escaping, was obhged to abscond herself, in regard there was much 
searching for her in order to get her again apprehended, so that 
she was obliged to flee from both husband and children : her house 
being waste for several years, turned ruinous ; her sheep were all 
carried away, killed and eaten by the Earl of Hume's regiment. 
The search after these was so accurate, that many hundreds of 
oaths were taken anentthe said Andrew and his spouse, so that they 
were obliged to more close hiding, until King James' toleration. 

" Mistress May Dunbar, second daughter to Sir David Dun- 
bar of Baldoon,'of known piety all her life, was forced to abscond 
and leave her father's house, and live for some time here and 
there, frequently in herds' houses, where she could not be accom- 
modated according to her birth and rank. One day she very pro- 
videntially and narrowly escaped the enemy's fury at the Caldons, 
about the year 1685." 

Land-owners. — The Earl of Galloway possesses one-half of the 
parish, known as the estate of Baldoon. The chief of the other 
proprietors are. Colonel Vans Agnew of Barnbarroch ; Sir William 
Maxwell, Bart, of Monrieth, who possesses the barony of Longcas- 
tle ; and James Blair, Esq. of Penninghame, who possesses the 
estate of Dalreagfle. 

Parochial Registers. — The earliest birth recorded in the paro- 
chial register is August 27th 1694. At times the register seems to 
have been very ill kept, as in some years there are very few names 
inserted. 

The marriage earliest recorded is November 22, 1694. This 
record continues to July 13, 1742; but there seems to have been 
none kept from that date till the year 1779. 

Antiquities.~ln former times, at a place called Cairnfield, 
there was a monument resembling that called Galdus' tomb, in 
the parish of Wigton. It consisted of a circle of standing-stones, 
with one m the centre. These, however, have long since been 
removed to make way for the plough. " The ruins of the ancient 
chapel of Longcastle are still to be seen in the parish of that name, 
about half a mile from the castle. The vestiges of two circular 
camps may be traced, but there is no tradition connected with 
them. Ancient coins have, at different times, been turned up by 
the plough in the farm of Barness. On Cairnfield, already allud- 
ed to, a large cairn of stones being removed to build fences, there 



16 



WIGTONSIIIIIE. 



was found a collection of half-burnt human bones, in an oblong 
space, formed of stones set on edge, and covered with a flat stone 
on the top, but there was no inscription. In 1789, an urn and 
some bones, partly consumed by tire, were discovered in the same 
place. 

The old castle of Baldoon has now become celebrated in 
romance ;— an incident that occurred within its walls having 
furnished Sir Walter Scott with the tragic subject which he 
has wrought into the tale of the Bride of Lammermoor. Vide In- 
troduction to that tale, last edition ; also Symson's Elegies, append- 
ed to his Description of Galloway. 

Modern Buildings.— The only modern building in \i - parish of 
any note is Barnbarroch House, the seat of Colonel Veins Agnew. 

Dunhars of Baldoon.— Thei-Am\\y of Dunbar of Baldoon was found- 
ed in the beginning of the sixteenth century, by Archibald Dunbar, 
a younger son of the Knight of Mochvum. The Baldoon branch con- 
tinued in the parish for about two centuries, and ultimately ended in 
a female, Mary, heiress of Sir David Dunbar. This young lady 
married Lord Basil Hamilton, sixth son of the Duke of Hamilton. 
His Lordship, having been drowned while crossing the Minnoch, a 
small stream in the stewartry of Kirkcudbright, was succeeded by 
his son, Basil Hamilton. On the death of the latter in 1742, 
Dunbar Hamilton succeeded him, and two years afterwards, on 
the death of his grand-uncle, the Earl of Selkirk, fell heir to his 
title and estates ; on this occasion, he assumed the name of Dou- 
glas. The Dunbars of Baldoon are now, therefore, represented 
by tiie noble family of Selkirk. The estate of Baldoon remained 
in the family till 1793, when it was sold to the Earl of Galloway.

III. — Population. 
Of the state of population in ancient times httie is known. 
Some have imagined that, as there are the remains of many old 
steadings in the parish, the population must at one time have been 
greater than it is at present. It appears from the synod record, that, 
in the year 1697, the number of examinable persons was 500; the 
population at that time, therefore, must have been about 1000. 

According to Dr Webster's returns, it was 792 
In 1801, it was, . • • j

number of our young men go to England, where they are engag- 
ed in the tea trade and other branches of business ; and that many 
of the young women go out as servants to Edinburgh, but particu- 
larly to Glasgow and Paisley.

The Seceders and Roman Catholics do not in general insert 
the births of their children in the parish register, but, calculating 
them at the same rate with the rest of the parishioners, the average 
of births f ir the last seven years will be about 40. 

There i'' d register of deaths kept in the parish, but the num-

The native Scots are cleanly in their habits, the Irish part of 
the population less so. There is nothing peculiar in their style or 
manner of dress, but they in general dress well. Their ordinary 
food is porridge and milk to breakfast, broth with bacun and po- 
tatoes or oat-cake to dinner, and porridge or beat potatoes to sup- 
per. In Symson's time the people seem to have been remarkable 
for their love of tobacco. It is still in pretty general use, but not 
more so than in other parts of the county. The Irish- population 
live mostly on potatoes and milk or salt herrings. 

The farmers enjoy all the comforts and luxuries that are to be 
met with in the same class elsewhere ; but I doubt much whether 
the comforts of the people are increasing. Irish labourers can 
subsist on much less than the Scotch ; and, in all cases of compe- 
tition for wol-k, are sure to underbid them,— hence the wages are 
lower than they otherwise would have been, and the labouring class

are obliged to deny themselves some comforts they might otherwise 
have enjoyed. On the whole, however, they are contented with 
their situation and circumstances. 

The people are in general a shrewd, thinking race ; they are 
fond of reading, and there are very few of them that are not pos- 
sessed of a small collection of books, of which at their leisure hours 
they seem to make a good use. Some of them are really well- 
informed. With very few exceptions, they are sober and honest, 
and attentive to their religious duties. 

There is neither poaching nor smuggling amongst us. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — The parish contains about 15,000 imperial acres, 
of which about 13,500 are or have been occasionally in tillage. 
The remaining 1500 acres consist partly of moss, a considerable por- 
tion of which is now, by paring and burning, made to produce good 
crops, partly of broken rocky pasture land, and the rest of upwards 
of 300 acres in wood. There is no land in the parish which can 
be termed waste ; neither is there any undivided common. There is 
no natural wood, and the proprietors seem to me to take sufficient care 
of their plantations. 

Jlent. — The rent of the land varies from L. 2, 10s. to 8s. ; the 
average may be nearly L. 1 per imperial acre. The average rate 
of grazing may be about L. 3 per ox or cow, and from 12s. to 15s. 
for a sheep. 

Wages. — Labourers in summer have about Is. 6d., in winter 
Is. 4d. ; masons and carpenters have about 2s. 6d. per day. 
The wages of men-servants living in the farm-houses vary 
from L. 4 to L. 6, per half-year ; women-servants receive from 
L. 2 to L. 3, 10s. Cottagers are paid partly in money and part- 
ly in what is termed a benefit. This consists of a house, garden, 
and fuel, as much meal and potatoes as are thought necessary for 
the maintenance of their families, and sometimes pasture for a 
cow and a sheep, amounting in whole to from L. 26 to L. 30 per 
annum. The price of the different articles of raw produce is re- 
gulated chiefly by the Liverpool markets, to which there is ready 
access by means of steam navigation. The breeding of sheep is 
not carried on to any great extent, the attention of the farmers 
being directed to the improvement of the far-famed breed of black- 
cattle, known by the name of Galloways. 

The general system of agriculture pursued on the dry land is 
white and green crops alternately. If the farmer finds that he 



KIRKINNER.' 19 

will require more manure than his farm can supply, he makes 
up the deficiency with bone dust ; he consumes part of his tur- 
nip in the yard, and the rest are fed off on the field with sheep. 
The land is then sown out with oats or barley, and grass seeds. 
On the clay lands ofBaldoon the Carse of Gowrieof Galloway, 
the farms are large and beautiful, and they are managed in a very 
superior style. The farmers adopt the most approved modes of 
husbandry ; their lands are in the highest state of improvement, 
and their wheat crops are excelled by no district in Scotland. 
The late Sir Alexander Muir Mackenzie irrigated an extensive 
meadow on his estate of Dalreagle, since sold to James Blair, Esq. ; 
but it does not seem to have answered his expectations. Leases 
are usually granted for nineteen years, though of late many farms 
have been let for seven, nine, or thirteen years. 

The farm-steadings are in general good ; many of them very 
superior. The fields are commonly divided by thorn hedges or 
stone dikes. The proprietors seem anxious to promote improve- 
ments on their respective estates, and are disposed to encourage 
enterprizing tenants. 

Live-StocL — The black-cattle generally reared in the parish 
are what are termed the Galloway breed. There are very few 
sheep kept by the farmers. They purchase large quantities of 
Highland sheep at Falkirk, and feed them off on turnip during 
winter and spring. A great quantity of black-cattle are now fat- 
tened for the Liverpool markets. 

Produce. — On an average, there are produced in the parish as 
follows : 



10,000 bushels of wheat, at 7s. per bushel, - L. 3,500 

2000 acres oats, at L. 5 per acre, - 10,000 

200 do. barley, - i7 do. - . . ],400

2000 head of cattle, at L. 7 each, . . _ . 14,000 



L. 33,800 

There are a few hands employed in linen weaving, and one da- 
mask weaver. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Town. — The nearest market-town is Wigton, distant 
about three miles. There is a penny-post daily. The port for ship- 
ping is Wigton. There is a small harbour at Baldoon, which 
is very useful to the parish for grain and coals. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is situated towards the east- 



20 WIGTONSHIllE. 

ern side of the parish, and on that account is a considerable dis- 
tance, about six miles, from a part of the population. It was built 
in 1828, and is a very handsome commodious building. It affords 
accommodation for upwards of 600 people. There are a few free sit- 
tings allotted to the poor of the parish. The only benefaction on 
record is the sum of L. 30, left by the late Sir William Maxwell 
of Monrieth. The manse was built in 1820. The glebe con- 
sists of about 10 acres, mostly of a light gravelly soil. The 
yearly value may be about L. 20. The stipend is 16 chal- 
ders, half meal, half barley, and L. 8, - 6s. 8d. for communion 
elements. There are 205 families belonging to the Established 
Church, consisting of about 1100 persons; there are 55 families 
of Dissenters, most of whom attend a meeting-house in Wigton ; 
and there are 23 families of Roman Catholics. There is at pre- 
sent a Catholic chapel building at Newtonstewart, in the neighbour- 
ing parish of Penninghame. There are upwards of 300 communi- 
cants in the Established Church, and in general divine service is 
well attended. Collections are seldom made except for the poor, 
and these on an average of the last seven years amount to L. 25 per 
annum. 

Education. — There are at present 4 schools in the parish, the 
parochial school, and three private schools. The parish schoolmas- 
ter has the maximum salary, L. 34, 4s. 4d. a-year, and his fees 
may amount to about L. 30. He has the legal accommoda- 
tion. All the usual branches of education are taught ; and at a 
very low rate. English reading and grammar, 8d. per month; 
writing, lOd; arithmetic and geography, Is. ; Latin and Greek, Is. 
8d. ; and French, 2s. 6d. There are very few children in the pa- 
rish' who cannot read and write. Many of the Irish part of the po- 
pulation can do neither, but they in general send their chddren 
to school, and the people seem alive to the benefit of education. 
The school-house, the best in the country, stands near the church. 
I consider four schools, one a female school, perfectly sufficient for 
the parish. The scholars attending the pubhc school have the 
benefit of a small library. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— average number on the poor s 
roll for the last seven years is 22, and the average sum allotted 
to each is about L. 3. But besides these regular paupers, there 
are a number of persons in the parish who stand m need of oc- 
casional aid, which on an average may amount to about L. 15 a 
year. The annual expenditure thus amounts to L. 81, which is pro- 



KIRKINNER.

vided for as follows : Average annual collections at church doors, 
L.25; voluntary contribution by the heritors, L. 50 ; interestof L.30, 
L. 1, 10s.; proclamations, mortcloth, donations, &amp;c. L. 4, 10s. 

I fear the disposition among the poor to refrain from seeking pa- 
rochial aid is daily becoming less, and I consider the voluntary con- 
tribution inade by the heritors as a very great evil in that respect. 
Many, I am persuaded, now apply for relief, believing that, what- 
ever they get, comes from the heritors, and not from the poor's box ; 
but it is much easier to prevent an evil than to remedy it. 

Alehouses. — There are 4 alehouses in the parish, and I have 
no doubt that, in some instances, they are very prejudicial to the 
morals of the people. 

Fuel. — The common fuel used in the parish is peat at 2s. 6d. 
per cart load. Coals are imported from the English coast, and 
sold at 16s. per ton. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since the former Statistical Account was pubhshed, a great 
change has taken place in the parish. Wages and rents are 
doubled, — the lands are in the highest state of improvement, where" 
they were formerly covered with whins, — and 10,000 bushels of 
fine wheat are now annually produced, where it was formerly thought 
there was something either in the soil or in the climate unfriend- 
ly to that grain. The blessings of education are now more gene- 
rally diffused amongst the people ; and I would fondly hope that 
their character, intellectual, moral, and religious, is greatly im- 
proved.

PRESBYTERY OE WIGTON, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY. 

THE REV. ELLIOT W. DAVIDSON, \ mtktc;tt7tc: 
THE REV. A. FORRESTER, J   



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — Sorbie, the modern name of this parish, was in ancient 
times written Sourby, — a term- of Saxon origin, and indicating 
Sour-habitation, which has been explained as applying to the old 
Castle of Sorbie, and to the nature of the cold marshy soil on its 
western side.  

The present parish includes the three old parishes of Sorbie, 
Kirkmadrine and Cruggleton, each of which had its own separate 
church till the middle of the seventeenth century, when they 
were united into one, under the name of the parish of Sorbie. 

Extent, Boundaries. — The greatest length of the parish is 6 
miles; its mean length about 4 miles; its greatest breadth is 6 
miles, and its mean breadth about 3 miles. It contains about 16 
square miles. It is bounded on the north, by the parish of Kirk- 
inner ; on the south, by Whithorn ; on the west, by Whithorn 
and Glasserton ; and on the east, by Wigton Bay. 

Topographical Appearances. — The figure of the parish is ren- 
dered very irregular by a conical section of Whithorn, which pe- 
netrates its southern side, at one point, reducing its length to three 
miles, and its breadth at another point to one mile. Sorbie con- 
tains neither mountains nor high hills, but it is beautifully diversi- 
fied by unequal surface, its Httle hills and valleys, with their woods 
and the sea adjoining, forming in many places a richly varied land- 
scape. There is nothing pecuhar in the form or connexions of 
the valleys, with the exception of one which follows a pretty 
regular direction from west to east, commencing at Dowalton Lake, 
and terminating at Garlieston Bay. None of the hills are much

raised above the level of the sea, but several of them are suflicient- 
ly elevated to present a beautiful panorama of the surrounding 
country, including Wigton Bay, the Solway Frith, with the Cum- 
berland hills receding behind it, and also the Isle of Man. On 
the farm of Palmallet, on the south-eastern shore, where the coast 
is rocky and abrupt, there are two caves, almost contiguous, which 
are walled and arched by solid rock, and floored with beautifully va- 
riegated stones. The one has the appearance of an oblique fis- 
sure, and is about 120 feet long, 100 feet high, and 36 feet wide. 
The other is somewhat funnel-shaped, being widest at its en- 
trance, and maybe about 120 feet long, 40 feet high, and 15 feet 
wide. 

The extent of coast, including all its windings, is upwards 
of two miles. The shore is sandy and flat on the north-east, and 
in Garlieston and Rigg Bays. At Eggerness point, it is rocky, 
but not very high. From the south -eastern extremity of Rigg 
Bay, however, to the point where it joins Whithorn, it is bold and 
precipitous, rising in some places nearly 200 feet above the level 
of the sea. The principal bays are Garlieston Bay, Rigg Bay, 
Innerwell Port, Orchardton Bay, Port Allan, and Port Whapple. 
The principal sands are those of Orchardton, Culscaddan, and 
Innerwell ; and the chief headlands are Innerwell Point, Egger- 
ness Point, and Cruggleton Point. 

Meteorology. — The monthly or annual temperature of the at- 
mosphere has not been accurately recorded in this parish, but we 
may state, what is common elsewhere, that in winter the cold is 
more moderate, especially along the sea coast, than in the more 
inland parishes. The thermometer in the shade has, during the 
present summer of 1831, ranged from 64° to 74°, and in the sun it 
has been upwards of 100°. The pressure of the atmosphere, as 
indicated by the barometer, ranges from 29 to 30 inches. Our 
prevailing winds are from the west, south-west, and south ; but in 
spring and the latter end or autumn, we have often a long period 
of east wind, which is generally accompanied by dry weather. 
The state of the weather is sometimes prognosticated by a cloud 
resting on Cairnsmoor, a high hill in Kirkcudbrightshire ; which, 
after a long period of dry weather, affords a pretty sure sign of a 
change to rain. A dark haze stretching from the south to the west, 
and studded with small white clouds, is remarked as often preceding 
rain ; and an appearance in the atmosphere, here called the " wea-

ther gaw," which resembles the rainbow in colour, but is much short- 
er, and hangs in a vertical line, is sometimes pointed out as indicat- 
ing a change. A strange tumbling motion of the crows in the''air, 
by which they imitate something like the sound of wind, has been 
said to precede stormy weather, and rain has also been prognos- 
ticated by the more shrill cry of the sea-birds which alight on the 
lands along the south-eastern shore. Our climate is characterized 
by considerable variety of heat and cold, drought, and humidity, 
but it is upon the whole good. Perhaps we may say that it has 
rather a tendency to humidity, which, however, is well suited to 
the nature of the soil, and rarely too abundant in summer. There 
are no diseases which can be traced to any peculiarity in the cli- 
mate of this district. 

Hydrography. — The parish, as we have already stated, is 
bounded on the east by Wigton Bay, which extends upwards of 
ten miles along the coast. The narrowest part of the Bay, as 
connected with this parish, is about 4 miles wide. This is from 
Orchardton to Carsluth Point. From Eggerness Point to Borness 
Head, it is 8 miles wide ; and its greatest width, from Garlieston 
Bay, or Cruggleton, to the point of Ross, is 10 miles. The co- 
lour of the water is bright green, where it is not rendered muddy 
by flowing over sand. Its transparency is very considerable, es- 
pecially on the south-eastern shore, where, we are told, the fish 
have been seen at the bait at the depth of 18 feet. Its depth is 
various. Between Eggerness Point and the Ross, it is from 30 to 
50 feet. In Garlieston and Rigg Bays, it runs from 20 to 30 feet. 
The saltness of the water is considerable at Cruggleton, but de- 
creases as we advance up the bay, in consequence of the fresh wa- 
ter from the rivers. The tide is derived from the Western Ocean, 
by way of the North Channel, and may be styled a northern arm 
of the great tide of the Solway. It flows about six hours, and ebbs 
during the other six. 

There are numerous perennial springs diffused over the parish, 
which afford a copious supply of excellent water. On the north- 
western border of the parish, there is a very fine fresh-water lake, 
called Dowalton Loch,  from M'Dowall, the name of a fami- 
ly, who were proprietors of it, and who lived near it. It is about 
3 miles in circumference, and from 6 to 20 feet deep. From

this lake there issues a small stream, which runs from west to 
east, through a rich valley, and falls into Garlieston Bay. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — In many parts of the parish, parti- 
cularly on the north and north-west, there occur numerous beds of 
transition rocks, varying in extent and thickness. These are dispos- 
ed in horizontal and variously inchned positions, and follow a direc- 
tion from north-east to south-west. There is no granite, with the 
exception of a few detached blocks, from two to three feet long, 
which present themselves here and there on the surface. We are 
not aware that any fossil organic remains have been found, belong- 
ing either to the animal or vegetable kingdom. Neither ores nor 
any important minerals have been discovered in the parish. The 
soil consists, for the most part, of a dry, brownish earth, mixed 
more or less with till or gravel. In some of the valleys, a heavy 
loam occurs, but its extent is inconsiderable. The subsoil con- 
sists of till, gravel, and whinstone. In several districts marl was 
once found under beds of moss, from one to three acres in extent, 
but the greater part of it was exhausted about fifty or sixty years 
ago, when it was dug up for the purpose of manure. There are 
no mines of any kind in the parish. 

Zoology. — Sorbie contains none of the rarer species of animals. 
Foxes once existed among the rocky cliffs on the sea coast, but 
they are now believed to be wholly extinct. A great many years 
ago, very large bullock and deer's horns were found in a bed of marl 
at Palmallet. This parish, in common with the other parishes of 
the Mahers, is distinguished for breeding that peculiar species 
of black-cattle, denominated Galloways, which are well known 
throughout the country. The horses are mostly of the draught 
kind, but their breed is rather mixed. There is nothing very re- 
markable in the quality or value of our sheep or hogs. Pike, per- 
ches, and eels abound in Dowalton Loch, and trouts are found in 
some of the larger streams. The fishes found in the sea are chief- 
ly salmon, herrings, cod, and mackerel, all of which are of import- 
ance in an economical point of view. There are no insects which 
are not common to other parts of the country. Those which are 
most destructive to vegetation, in general, are the wire-worm and 
grub. Those which are most injurious to fruit-trees are the ca- 
terpillar and the wasp ; the former attacking the flower, and the 
latter the fruit. A considerable variety of shell-fish is found on 
the coast, such as the oyster, lobster, crab, &amp;c. but none of these 
are sought after for economical purposes.

Botany. — Sorbie was, in 1795, first visited for the purpose of 
botanical research, by Mr Mackay, then curator of tlie Botanic Gar- 
den in Edinburgh. Three years ago, it was again examined by Mr 
Goldie, who found a number of the rarer species of British plants, 
and reckoned it an excellent station, though it had not been previ- 
ously much noticed. The plantations display a beautiful variety 
of trees, such as the oak, ash, beech, birch, alder, plane, larch, &amp;c. 
to all of which the soil seems quite congenial. In Lord Gallo- 
way's pleasure grounds, there are some beautiful specimens of lau- 
rel, evergreen oak, horse-chestnut, and Turkey oak. Some of the 
laurels rise to the height of 31 feet, and are considered among the 
finest in Scotland. There is one Turkey oak, planted not more 
than fifty years ago, which deserves to be particularly noticed for 
its beauty, and for the rapidity of its growth. The circumference 
of its branches is about 156 feet, and the girth of its stem mea- 
sures 9 feet 5 inches. The soil here is also peculiarly adapted to 
the growth of evergreen shrubs. In his Lordship's garden, peach- 
es and figs are successfully cultivated on the open wall, even 
upon south-west aspects. Here, also, there is a vine which merits 
notice for its size, and the quantity and quality of its fruit. Its 
stem measures 13 inches in circumference, and the spread of its 
branches is 40 feet. It produces about 346 bunches, each averag- 
ing 1; lbs. and some of the individual berries are 3| inches in cir- 
cumference. 

II. — Civil History. 

The only ancient or modern historical accounts of Sorbie 
which we have seen, are contained in Symson's Description of Gal- 
loway, the Old Statistical Account, and Chalmers' Caledonia. 
From none of these does it appear that there are any historical 
events of great importance connected with this district. We have 
not seen any maps, plans, or surveys of Sorbie ; nor are we aware 
that any resident individuals possess letters, papers, pictures, or 
any other documents of interest, tending to illustrate the biography, 
history, or antiquities of the parish. 

Eminent Men. — The only literary character connected with 
Sorbie by birth is Patrick Hannay, the poet, who lived in tho 
seventeenth century. We copy the following account of him 
from Murray's Literary History of Galloway. " Patrick Han- 
nay was a younger son of Donald Hannay of Sorbie. It may 
be inferred that he had received an academical education : for in 

" Literary History, &amp;c. page 269.

the title-page of his Elegies, he styles himself A. M." Mr EUis, 
in his Specimens of the early English Poets, has remarked, that he 
appears to have served in a military capacity, under Sir Andrew 
Gray, a Colonel of foot, and General of Artillery to the King of Bo- 
hemia. One of his publications bears the following title, " Two 
Elegies on the Death of our late Soveraigne Queene Anne, with 
Epitaphes, written by Patrick Hannay, Master of Arts." Another 
is entitled " A Happy Husband ; or Directions for a Maid to chuse 
her Mate, together with a Wive's Behaviour after Marriage. By 
Patrick Hannay, Gent." Lend. 1619. 8vo. This composition is 
appended, with a separate title-page, to Brathwyte's Description 
of a Good Wife. It was afterwards inserted in a collection of 
Hannay's Poems, published in the year 1622, and containing 
" Philomela, the Nightingale, Theretine, and Mariana, Elegies, 
Songs, and Sonnets." We have been informed that, within these 
three years, a copy of his poetical works was sold in London for 
L. 42, 10s. 6d., and that there was prefixed to it, a portrait of the 
author, which was regarded as a valuable illustration of the state 
of the arts at the period when it was taken. 

Land-owners. — The chief proprietors of Sorbie are, the Earl of 
Galloway to whom the greater part of the parish belongs ; Sir 
Andrew Agnevv of Lochnaw, Bart. ; the Earl of Stair ; and Mr Ha- 
thorn of Castlewigg. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers are not volumi- 
nous. The date of their earliest entry is 1700. They were pro- 
perly attended to for some time at first, but afterwards not so care- 
fully conducted. Of late, however, they have been regularly kept. 

Ancient Ecclesiastical State. — We have already stated that the 
present parish of Sorbie includes the three old parishes of Sorbie, 
Kirkmadrine, and Cruggleton; but we are told by Chalmers, 
that in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, Sorbie itself formed 
two divisions; Great Sourby and Little Sourby, each of which 
had its own church. The union of these two churches was after- 
wards authorized by Gilbert, the Bishop of Candida Casa, and took 
place betwixt the years 1235 and 1253. The cure of Sorbie, thus 
united, was served by a vicar, and belonged to the monks of Dry- 
burgh, till the Reformation, at which period it was let for L. 20 a 
year.f Of the ancient churches of Great and Little Sourby no 
vestige is now remaining, but the sites of two churches are still

pointed out, the one at Culnoag, on the north-west, and the other 
at Gilfillan, near the middle of the parish, and on these we think 
they must have heen built. 

The ancient parish of Kirkmadrine forms the eastern district 
of the present parish of Sorbie. The church of this parish be- 
longed to the prior and canons of St Mary's Isle, and the cure 
"was served by a vicar. About the year 1562, the vicarage was 
reported to be worth only L. 10 yearly. The church appears 
to have been rather small, exceedingly plain, and without windows. 
Its ruins are still to be seen on the farm of Penkiln, surrounded 
by a clump of trees, which also incloses the church-yard. Here 
some families in the parish still bury ; and it may be noticed that 
some of the bones, occasionally dug up at the opening of a grave, 
are remarkably large. 

The ancientparish of Cruggleton forms the south-eastern district 
of the present parish. Its church belonged to the priory of Whit- 
horn, and the cure was served by a vicar. In 1562, the vicarage 
of Cruggleton was said to be worth L. 16. After the Reformation, 
the Bishops of Galloway received the patronage of this and the 
other two parishes ; and after Kirkmadrine and Cruggleton were 
joined to Sorbie, they held the patronage of the united parish, till 
the abolition of Episcopacy in 1 689, when it was vested in the 
crown.-f- The church of Cruggleton appears to have been larger, 
and better built than that of Kirkmadrine. The greater part of 
the walls is still extant ; and the interior of it is occasionally used 
as burying ground. 

Antiquities. — The Castle of Cruggleton, which gave name to the 
parish in which it stood, was built on the verge of a precipitous part 
of the sea coast. Nothing now remains of it, save part of an arch, 
and the foundations of some of the walls ; but there is enough to 
shew that, in ancient times, it must have been a place of great size 
and strength. The spot on which it stood is a kind of promon- 
tory, formed by a small bay on each side, and is elevated about 200 
feet perpendicular above the level of the sea. The fosse encloses 
upwards of an acre of ground, and is still quite distinct. It is 
183 yards long, and about" 12 yards wide. We have not been 
able to ascertain the precise period at which the castle was built, 
but we are told by Chalmers that it certainly existed in the thir- 
teenth century, and that it was the property and domicile of John

Comyn, the Earl of Buchan, as one of the heirs parceners of the 
Lords of Galloway. The same author farther informs us, that 
in 11292, John Comyn, the Earl of Buchan, obtained from Edward I. 
a license to dig in the ruins of the Calf of Man, for lead, to cover eight 
towers of his castle of Cruggleton, in Galloway ; that John Comyn 
was afterwards totally defeated by King Robert Bruce, who seiz- 
ed his estates and castles ; and that the castle of Cruggleton was 
involved in the ruin of his family. It existed as a ruin before the 
year 1684. The castle is now on the estate of Sir Andrew Ag- 
new of Lochnaw, Bart. 

The old Castle of Eggerness stood upon a bold part of the coast, 
on a head-land of the same name, and must have been a place of 
considerable strength. Scarcely any vestige of it now remains, 
except a part of the fosse, and its history is involved in entire ob- 
scurity. 

The old place or tower of Sorbie is a beautiful ruin, surround- 
ed by wood, and situated about three quarters of a mile from the 
parish church. It appears to have been a place of strength. 
There are the remains of a fosse on the eastern side, where the 
land is rising ; but from the nature of the ground on every other 
side, we think its chief defence must have been formed by a sheet 
of water. The Hannays possessed this estate and Castle of Sor- 
bie, together with other lands in Wigtonshire, in the reign of 
James IV., and continued here during the seventeenth century.-f- 
The estate of Sorbie now belongs to the Earl of Galloway. 

Modern Edifices. — The only modern edifice in Sorbie worthy 
of particular notice is Galloway House, the seat of the Earl of 
Galloway, which was built about seventy or eighty years ago. We 
quote the following account of it from the Old Statistical Account. 
" Galloway House forms part of a landscape truly beautiful and 
grand. Garlieston Bay is on the north, and Rigg Bay is on the 
south of it. From its windows are seen the richest fields ; an in- 
dented coast, adorned with growing improvements,- a cluster of 
isles, and the lofty mountains of Cumberland and Man, appearing 
at a proper distance. The principal rooms are spacious, and the 
library is stored with many thousand valuable volumes." 

The houses of the villages are in general well built. There are 
three mills in the parish. The materials generally employed in 
building are whinstone of which Sorbie furnishes an abundant sup- 
ply, and American pine, which is annually imported.

III. — Po PUL ATI O N. 
From the records of the synod of Galloway it appeared that, in 
1697, the population of Sorbie was 480. In 1755, it was 986. 

The amount of population as shown by the census of 1791, was 1071 

1801, 1091 
1811, 1265 
1821, 1319 
1831, 1412 
The number of males being 656, females, 756 

The gradual increase of the- population is to be attributed 
mainly to improvements in agriculture and shipping, but it must 
be observed that, within the last forty or fifty years, a considerable 
number of Irish families have settled in the parish, and have con- 
tributed to augment the labouring classes beyond what these 
causes could have otherwise effected. Their existence in the pa- 
rish is therefore to be attributed more to their capacity of subsist- 
ing on an inferior scale of comforts, than to the healthy stimulus 
of an increase in the means of subsistence. 

The number of the population at present residing in villages, is 757 

in the country is 655

The Earl of Galloway is the only nobleman who has a place of 
residence in Sorbie ; and there are no famiUes or individuals of 
independent fortune living in the parish. 

The number of proprietors of land of the yearly value of L. 50 and upwards, is 4 
unmarried men, bachelors, and widowers, upwards of 50, is 22 
unmarried women upwards of 45, - 22

The people, on the whole, enjoy, in a reasonable degree, the 
comforts and advantages of society, and are contented with their 
situation and circumstances. Their intellectual, moral, and reli- 
gious character is good. 

There is no poaching in game, or in the salmon- fisheries, and 
no smuggling carried on in the parish.

We have already mentioned the variety of trees planted, and it 
may here be noticed that the yearly thinning and periodical fel- 
ling of these is judiciously conducted. 

Rent. — The average rent of arable land per imperial acre is L. 1. 
The average rent of grazing may be rated at L. 3 per ox or cow 
grazed, and at 15s. per ewe or full-grown sheep pastured for the 
year. 

Wages. — The rate of wages for a farm-labourer per day is 
Is. 6d. ; do. per year without victuals, L. 25 ; do. per year with 
victuals, L. 11. Rate of wages for a mason, house-carpenter, or 
mechanic, per day, 2s. 6d. ; do. for a ship-carpenter, 3s. 

Prices. — The average price of wheat per imperial bushel is 6s. 
9d. ; of barley, do. 4s. ; of oats, do. 2s. 4d. ; of potatoes, do. 7d."; 
of turnips per cart, 3s. ; of hay per stone of 26 lbs. 7d. The price of 
a good cart, L. 10 ; of an iron plough, L. 4, 10s. ; of a couple of 
harrows, L. 1, 15s. ; of a drill-harrow, L. 1, 10s. ; shoeing of a 
horse, 2s. 6d. 

Live-Stock. — Our common breed of sheep is rather large, but 
considerably mixed. The cattle, as we have already stated, are of 
the Galloway breed, and much attention has been paid to their im- 
provement. Their colour is mostly black, and they are without 
horns. They are generally sold when two or three years old, and 
taken to the Dumfries market, where they are again sold for the 
English markets. 

Husbandry. — The state of husbandry, in this parish, is highly im- 
proved. Oats and barley are the grains usually cultivated. Wheat 
is raised only in small quantity. Within the last ten or twelve 
years, turnips have been extensively and profitably cultivated for 
feeding sheep. The sheep, for this purpose, are purchased at the 
Falkirk trysts, and, when fat, are generally sent to the Liverpool 
market, with which the parish enjoys the advantage of a regular 
steam communication. Bone-dust was introduced as a manure, 
about two years ago, and the green crops raised on it, as well as the 
following crop of grain, have been of superior quality. It costs 
2s. 6d. per bushel, and from twenty-five to thirty-five of them are 
laid on the acre. 



32 



VVIGTONSHIRE. 



The general duration of leases is nineteen years, which term is 
generally believed to be favourable to the occupier. The state of 
farm-buildings and enclosures, in the parish, is exceedingly good ; 
and we cannot say that any serious obstacles to improvement arise 
either from the want of capital, or the want of encouragement from 
proprietors. 

Fisheries. — There is a salmon-fishery at Innerwell Port, the rent 
of which is about L. 200 per annum. At this place, herrings, 
mackerel, cod, and other kinds of fish are also frequently caught. 
About three years ago, herrings were caught, in considerable 
quantity, off Garlieston and Cruggleton. Some of the bouts made 
nearly L. 30 each by their fishings, during the season, which in- 
duced the people of Garlieston to build about twenty little boats for 
the purpose of following the fishing ; but the want of success expe- 
rienced during the two last seasons, renders it doubtful whether 
this branch of industry will continue to be prosecuted for economi- 
cal purposes. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce annually 
raised in the parish, may be rated as follows : 

Produce of grain of all kinds, _ _ - L. 5175 0 0 

of potatoes, turnips, and other plants, - - 1778 0 0 

of iiay, meadow and cultivated, _ . - 1094 0 0 

of land in pasture, - _ _ _ 4052 0 0 

of the annual thinning and periodical felling of woods, - 187 0 0 
of fisheries, - - - - - 350 0 0 

Total yearly value of raw produce, L. 12,636 0 0 

Manufactures. — There are two branches of manufacture esta- 
blished in the parish ; the one, a damask manufactory, in the village 
of Sorbie ; and the other, a rope and sail manufactory, at the vil- 
lage of Garlieston. The former employs about 91 hands, includ- 
ing those who spin ; the latter employs about 10. At both of 
these, the men usually work ten or twelve hours per day, and six 
days per week. The damask manufactory is of nearly fifty years' 
standing, and is much famed for the superiority of its fabrics and 
patterns of double damask. The goods are all used by families 
of the highest rank, as they are wholly made from the best Dutch 
flax, hand-spun ; and the nobility of the county take such an in- 
terest in the success of the manufactory, that the quality of the 
goods is known through the most of Scotland and England. In 
1800, a suit of damask was sent for the first time to the annual 
competition in Edinburgh, before the Board of Trustees, and it 
gained the highest premium. The articles produced at the rope

and sail manufactory are used both for shipping, and for the diffe- 
rent purposes of rural economy. Both branches of manufacture 
afford a fair remuneration and support to those engaged in them, 
and produce no bad effects on health and morals. 

Navigation. — Garlieston is the only shipping-port in the parish 
which vessels usually frequent. The harbour was very much en- 
larged and otherwise improved some years ago, and is now ca- 
pable of affording shelter for thirty vessels. At high tides it con- 
tains about eighteen or twenty feet of water. There are fifteen 
vessels belonging to the port. Four of these carry 100 tons each ; 
and the remaining eleven average 48 tons each. Besides these, 
two or three foreign vessels occasionally trade to the port. Ship- 
building has been carried on rather actively at Garlieston during 
the last fifteen years. We may state, that, in the course of that 
time, fourteen vessels have been built, some of which carry 100 
tons. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Toion. — Sorbie contains no market-town ; and there are 
no fairs of any kind held in the parish. The nearest market- 
town is Whithorn, which is about four and a-half miles distant. 

Villages. — There are two villages in the parish ; Sorbie, which 
is about two miles from the sea ; and Garlieston, which is beauti- 
fully situated on a bay of the same name. The former contains 
170, and the latter 587 inhabitants. In these two villages there 
are thirteen public-houses ; and the effects of these on the morals 
of the people are uniformly injurious. 

Means of Communication. — The parish enjoys ample means of 
communication, both by sea and land. There is a penny-post 
established at Garlieston. Sorbie village has daily communica- 
tion with the post-office of Wigton. Good roads traverse the 
country in every direction ; and Garlieston harbour opens up an 
important avenue to the markets of Liverpool, Whitehaven, and 
other places on the western coast of Eno-land. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated at the village 
of Sorbie, and is about four miles distant from the extremity of the 
parish. Its situation may be said to be convenient for the greater 
number of the inhabitants, the populous village of Garlieston be- 
ing only two and a-half miles distant. It was rebuilt about the 
year 1750, and thoroughly repaired in 1826. It affords accom- 
modation for nearly 500 persons. Most of the seats in the lower

WIGTONSHIRE. 



part of the church are apportioned to the farmers ; the remainder 
below and the galleries are free to the other inhabitants of the 
parish. The manse was rebuilt in 1778, and enlarged about the 
year 1813. The glebe contains 9 acres, and its yearly value is 
about L. 12. The amount of the stipend is L. 242, 4s. lOd. in 
money ; and 2 firlots, 1 peck, 2| lippies of meal, and the same of 
bear. No communion elements are allowed, the teinds being 
exhausted. There are no chapels of ease attached to the Esta- 
blished Church. There is one Independent chapel in the parish. 
The minister of this is paid by his hearers, and receives about 
L. 60 per annum. There are no Episcopalian or Catholic chapels 
in Sorbie. 

The number of families attending the Established Church is 152 ; 
number of persons of all ages attending Estabhshed Church, 671 ; 
number attending the chapels of Dissenters, 214; number attending 
Catholic chapel at Newton- Stewart thirteen miles distant, 55. 
Divine service at the Established Church is generally well at- 
tended. The average number of communicants at the Establish- 
ed Church is about 240. There is one Bible Society in the pa- 
rish, the yearly contributions of which may average about L. 15. 
The yearly average of church collections for the poor is about 
L. 30. 

Education. — Total number of Schools in the parish, 5; pa- 
rochial schools, 1 \ unendowed schools, 4. Among these there 
are two female schools, one of which is supported by Lady 
Galloway, and conducted upon the Lancasterian system. The 
branches of instruction generally taught in the parochial school 
are, reading, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, geography, La- 
tin, and Greek. One of the schools of Garlieston has been 
long famous for navigation, and the practical branches of ma- 
thematics. The parochial teacher possesses the legal accom- 
modations. His salary is L. 25, ISs. 3|d. ; and the amount of 
school fees may be rated at L. 64 per annum. The yearly ex- 
pense of education at the parochial school is as follows: — Reading 
of English, 12s. ; reading and writing, 14s. j arithmetic, 16s. ; 
Latin or Greek, 20s. ; book-keeping by single entry, 20s. ; book- 
keeping by double entry, L. 2, 2s. ; mensuration, 7s. 6d. ; trigo- 
nometry, 7s. 6d. ; navigation, 21s. The number of the young 
betwixt six and fifteen, who cannot read or write, may be about 
six, and these we believe to be mostly of the lower Irish. We 
know of none in the parish upwards of fifteen who cannot read or 



SORBIE. 



35 



write. The people are in general alive to the benefits of educa- 
tion, and manifest a strong desire to have their children well taught. 
We do not think that any additional schools are required in Sor- 
bie. The increased facilities of education have certainly effected 
a corresponding increase in the knowledge and refinement of the 
people, but the state of morality is much the same as it has been 
for many years. Among some of the lower classes, indeed, the 
native virtues of our character have been invaded by the contami- 
nating influencoxof the lower Irish, whose poverty and degradation, 
in no instance, contribute to elevate the standard of morality. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is about 30, and the average sum allotted 
to each per year is about L. 2. The annual amount of contribu- 
tions for their support is about L. 60. Of this sum L. 30 are col- 
lected in the church, and about L. 30 received as donations from 
the proprietors. There is no other regular mode of procuring 
funds for the poor, but the inhabitants of the parish are in the 
habit of giving them additional charity in meal, and other articles 
of food, two or three times a-year ; and the relief afforded in this 
way is more than equal to that obtained by the annual contribu- 
tions. There is a disposition among the poor to refrain from seek- 
ing parochial aid ; but this feeling is by no means so marked as it 
once was, and its deterioration we ascribe partly to the hurtful ex- 
ample of the lower Irish, and partly to the ready relief afforded to 
the poor, in times of unusual scarcity and distress. 

Fuel— The fuel used in Sorbie consists of peat and coal. The 
peat is procured chiefly from the neighbouring parish of Kirkinner, 
at 2s. 6d. per cart-load ; and the coal is obtained from Whitehaven, 
Workington, or Maryport, at 16s. per ton. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since the date of the last Statistical Account, agriculture has 
undergone a very marked improvement. Green crops are now 
generally raised, and are found to be advantageous, both for the 
profits which they yield, and for the improvement which they ope- 
rate upon the land. Turnips, especially when eaten off by sheep, 
are followed by superior crops of grain. The general rule of farm- 
ing is still what it formerly was ; that is, to have one-third of the 
land in tillage, and two-thirds in pasture. The average rent of 
land per acre is now more than double of what it was forty years 
ago, and almost all the arable land has been under cultivation. 
Upon the whole, the system of husbandry pursued in this parish 



36 



WIGTONSIilRE. 



is fully as much improved as the present state of things will admit 
of, and our facilities of internal communication are as great as can 
possibly be desired. The villages have increased in size and po- 
pulation. GarliestoK, from its ship-building and the improvement 
of its harbour, has increased in commercial importance. The 
knowledge, taste, manners, and dress of the great body of the peo- 
ple, have all been obviously much improved within the last forty 
years; and the happiness and comfort of the labouring classes 
might be still farther promoted by an enlightened co-operation of 
landlord and tenant, to prevent the influx of Irish labourers, and 
preserve the rate of wages from sinking too low. This would ad- 
vance even the lowest classes in the parish to a point in the scale 
of living, which, in seasons of dearth, would admit of their making 
some retrenchments in order to subsist on the profits of their own 
industry ; whereas, at present, in times of scarcity, they are either 
reduced to want, or compelled to subsist on the voluntary contri- 
butions of their more fortunate neighbours, — a state of things, 
which, in so far as it prevails, exerts the most debasing influence on 
the genuine spirit of independence.

PRESBYTERY OF WIGTON, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY, 

THE REV. SAMUEL CLANAGHAN, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name.— The word Glasserton, it is said, is derived from the 
ancient Saxon, and signifies a bare hill. No doubt there are seve- 
ral bare hills in the parish : but the appellation is so far from being 
a distinctive one, that half the parishes in Scotland might have 
had the same name. 

Boundaries, 8fc.— The parish is bounded by Mochrum parish 
on the west; Sorbie and Kirkinner on the north; Whithorn on 
east ; and the Bay of Luce on the south. It is one of the most 
southerly parishes in Scotland. It begins two miles from Borough- 
head, and stretches along the sea coast till within two miles of Port 
William, a distance of seven miles, which is part of the space be- 



GLASSERTON. 



37 



tween Borough-head and the Mull of Galloway, — two points about 
which it has sometimes been disputed which is really the south- 
ermost. The maps, however, have decided in favour of the Mull, 
and I believe correctly. 

Topographical Appearances. — The parish is long and narrow, 
being at least eight miles in length, and varying from one to three 
miles in breadth. It is most irregular in its outline and shape, 
and so intersected by the neighbouring parishes, that some of the 
inhabitants of the parish of Whithorn, in going to their parish 
church, have to pass through part of the parish of Glasserton ; 
and, vice versa, the people of Glasserton, in more points than one, 
have to pass through the parish of Whithorn in going to their 
church. The sea coast of this parish and the north coast of the 
Isle of Man lie parallel to each other, the island bearing nearly 
south or south-south-west from Glasserton, at a distance of sixteen 
or eighteen miles. 

The coast is generally bold and rocky. The hills, or heughs 
as they are called, which terminate the land, are of various heights, 
green at top and half-way or more down the declivity. But from 
that down to the beach they are precipitous rocks, grey, black, or 
weather-beaten, as they are more or less washed by the waves. 
They are broken and rugged, often perpendicular, and sometimes 
hanging over. In other places, they slope away into the sea, show- 
ing here and there their black and pointed tops above the surface. 
The sea beach and all within water-mark is a rocky bottom, co- 
vered with loose stones of various sizes, some of them rounded and 
polished by the motion of the sea, whilst others are shapeless 
masses, covered with shells and marine plants. 

There are two three ports where sloops can unload in fine wea- 
ther; but there is nothing like a safe harbour in any part of the 
parish. 

There are some caves at the bottom of the cliffs, but they are 
not of much depth, nor do they penetrate far backwards. There 
is nothing remarkable in their history, nor any particular tradition 
concerning them, with the exception of one on the Physgill shore, 
in which St Ninian is said to have taken up his residence for a 
time ; but whether he lived in a cave through choice or necessity 
does not appear. St Ninian is said to have been the founder of 
Whithorn Priory, and the first Bishop of Galloway. It is proba- 
ble he was a man of abstemious habits, an anchorite in disposition, 
and one who, like a true Catholic, believed that, if self-denial was 



38 



WIGTONSIIIRE. 



good, penance was still better.- The people in this part of the 
country have corrupted his name into St Ringan ; and the hole 
where he lived is known by the name of St Riugan's Cave. 
It is a place of small dimensions, and does not penetrate more 
than twenty feet into the rock. Its roof is about eight or ten feet 
high. The stones in the roof are wedged like an arch, and water 
drops from the crevices. It stands a few feet above the level 
of the sea, and looks towards the east. It is a cool enough re- 
treat in a warm summer day ; but in winter, with an easterly wind, 
it would be exceedingly cold quarters. 

General Aspect and Surface of the Country. — It is broken and 
uneven, with scarcely anything like a level field to be seen ; and 
yet there is little of what could be called hill and dale, but small 
knolls, and a constant succession of heights and hollows. 

Almost every field has more or less waste land in it ; and yet 
some are excellent either for crop or pasture. Indeed, there 
are fields in this parish equal to any in the county for feed- 
ing cattle ; and yet they would find no favour in the eyes of a 
stranger, merely from their broken and uneven surface. But the 
richness of soil in the hollows, and the shelter afforded by the 
knolls, sometimes covered with furze, which still adds to their shel- 
ter, are advantages which make up for the apparent waste. These 
heights, when not covered with furze, are thickly clothed with a 
coarser sort of grass, which, not being eaten in summer, affords 
a great deal of excellent foggage for the winter. 

The south side of the parish, along the shore, is the highest 
ground, and may properly be called hilly. The Hill of Glas- 
serton, the Fell of Carlton, and the Fell of Barhullion, are hills 
43f considerable magnitude. As to their height above the level of 
the sea, I have not the means of ascertaining it with precision. I 
should suppose it to be from 400 to 600 feet. They are mostly 
green, with rocks occasionally breaking through the green surface. 
Such is the sea shore on the south side of the parish. On the 
northern boundaries, there are hills also, but they are of a different 
description, and consist of different materials. They are till from 
top to bottom, with a smoother surface, more curved and regular in 
their shape. The soil, however, is poor and spongy. They are 
always wettest at top, with a subsoil so close and impervious, that 
it is very difficult if not impossible to drain them. These hills 
are arable but not fertile, on account of their tilly subsoil. Both 
grain and grass is chilled and stunted by the moisture, which can- 



GLASSERTON. 



39 



not escape downward, but is constantly oozing up through the sur- 
face. 

The hills on the sea shore are only partly arable, from the thin- 
ness of the soil, and being interspersed with bare rocks towards 
their summits. But none of hills, either on the south or north, 
are covered with heath, as described in the Old Statistical Ac- 
count of this parish. In as far, then, as that Account was correct, 
so far has improvement advanced. But I suspect, that, if ever 
there were heath-clad hills, it must have been much earlier than 
the date of that report. There are, to be sure, spots and patches 
of moorland and mosses of considerable extent in the north-western 
parts, but even the moory parts are but lightly sprinkled with 
heath. They are covered with sprit and other coarse grasses and 
plants common to moory soils. The mosses formerly supplied the 
inhabitants with peats for fuel ; and even yet these are used in 
some places, but not commonly, for coals are procured with less 
trouble, and at a moderate expense. 

Of late, both proprietors and farmers have been more anxious 
to bring the mosses into cultivation than to encourage peat cut- 
ting. They are more desirous to level the surface and drain off 
the water, than to dig pits to retain it, which is the consequence 
of the peat system. Indeed, if the moss is upon a rocky bottom, 
and of no great depth, cutting it away in peats is destroying so 
much land altogether. It is demolishing in a single day what na- 
ture required some thousand years to produce. 

The cultivation of moss has been carried as far perhaps as is 
profitable. What has already been subjected to tillage might be 
susceptible of still farther improvement in draining, levelling, and 
manuring, or in top-dressing with cross soils, which is always ex- 
ceedingly beneficial ; but any farther encroachments into the cen- 
tre of the mosses, that is, into the flow-moss or soft spongy part, 
would not be advisable, at least for a long time to come. Besides, 
there is no great extent of such moss in the parish. 

There is no natural wood in this parish. Furze abounds, and, 
if not kept in check, would soon cover the whole surface. There 
are bushes of hazel, sloe-thorn, and broom to be met with, but 
not in such quantity as to give the farmer much concern; but 
furze costs him a great deal of labour to keep it from over-spread- 
ing the fields. 

From this description of the surface of the land, it may be sup- 
posed that there is much variety in the soil, which is the case, 



40 



WIGTONSHIRE. 



for, in the compass of a field of even small dimensions, we find 
th ree or four different soils. This, no doubt, is a great disadvan- 
tage in ripening the crops, for the same ridge, perhaps, has light dry 
soil, loam and moss, in diff"erent parts ; consequently, the grain is 
green or ripe, according as the soil is heavy or light, damp or dry. 

The subsoil is equally various, and perhaps more so. It consists 
of clay, till, gravel, and rock. The rocks are of different kinds, but 
chiefly a kind of ti-ansition slate, full of joints and fissures, which 
has sometimes been used for gravelling roads, though it is certainly 
the worst road-metal possible ; for the feet of horses or cattle 
immediately pound it into clay. Its only recommendation is cheap- 
ness at first. But at last, it is the dearest and the worst. A road 
made of this is never good, but constantly in need of repairs. 

But the 'subsoil in some places is of greywacke whinstone. 
This is now used for Macadamizing the roads ; but it is difficult 
to break, and does not cut in any direction which the workmen 
desire ; it is what they call " cross-grain'd," and breaks into ir- 
regular pieces. 

It does not appear that granite forms any part of the subsoil in 
this parish, nor are there any strata of it, either on the sea shore or 
inland parts, as stated in the Old Statistical Account. There are 
sometimes detached pieces of granite to be found. They are ge- 
nerally bedded in the surface. They are round in shape, as if they 
had been rolled among the other elements, like pebbles which are 
rounded by the motion of the sea. 

Meteorology. — The climate is exceedingly good, and favourable 
to health and longevity. Typhus, scarlet fever, pleurisy, and 
consumption, do occasionally make their appearance amongst us, 
but never prevail to any alarming extent. The atmosphere is mild 
and moist. The soil in Galloway is generally light and thin, 
and, of course, easily scorched by dry weather. But the soil 
and climate are well adapted to each other, for if the soil require 
frequent showers, it generally receives them. The prevailing 
winds are the westerly. The greatest storms and heaviest rains 
are from the south-west. The wind ranges from south-east to 
west, I should suppose, at least two-thirds of the whole year. The 
winter is very mild, without much frost or snow. From the mild- 
ness of the winter in Galloway, it has been called the Devonshire 
of Scotland; along the sea coast, especially, snow never lies for 
any length of time, and a week or two of uninterrupted frost is a 
very rare occurrence. As a proof of this, there are many winters

during which the curlers are entirely deprived of their favourite 
sport for want of ice. 

Hydrography. — There are no rivers in this parish nor lakes of 
importance. The Loch of Dowalton, however, is surrounded by 
Kirkinner, Sorbie, and this parish. But it forms only a small part 
of our boundary. This lake is perhaps a mile and a half in length, 
and from half a mile to three quarters in breadth. There is ano- 
ther small lake near the House of Castlestewart ; but there is no- 
thing remarkable in the appearance or history of either of these 
lakes. Pike, perch, trout, and eels, are found in them, but not in 
great abundance. In Castlestewart Loch, there are leeches of a su- 
perior sort, but not numerous. 

n. — Civil History. 

Mansion-Houses. — There are three mansion -houses in the pa- 
rish ; but only one residing heritor, Mr Stewart of Physgill, who 
constantly resides at Glasserton. Physgill is tenanted by two la- 
dies ; and in Castlestewart no gentleman's family has resided for 
upwards of forty years, — it is therefore getting fast into disrepair. 

Land-owners. — The parish belongs to five heritors, — Sir Wil- 
liam Maxwell, Bart, of Monrieth ; Stair H. Stewart, Esq. of 
Physgill ; the Earl of Galloway ; the Earl of Stair ; and John 
Pringle, Esq. of Craigdow. This latter gentleman resides occa- 
sionally on his property here. 

Antiquities. — It is worthy of notice that the head of a Urus was 
not long ago found in a marl-pit on the estate of Castlewig, in this 
parish. It was sent by Mr Train of Castle- Douglas, to Sir Walter 
Scott, — and, it is supposed, yet to be seen immediately over the 
door at Abbotsford. It is of the following dimensions : From the 
top of the head to the point of the nose, 28 inches ; between the 
sockets of the eyes, 13 inches ; diameter of the sockets of the 
eyes, 4 inches ; round the flint of the horn, 13 inches.

Agriculture. — The parish contains about 10,688 Scotch acres ; of 
which about 3000 are waste, and betwixt 200 and 300 planted. Thtf 
rental is about L. 8570. As many of the farms have their rents re- 



42

gulated by the fiars price of grain, of course these rents vary more or 
less every year, and some of the lands being possessed by the proprie- 
tors themselves, can only be reported at an estimated value ; in many 
cases, also, there is considerable difference betwixt what is promised 
and what is really paid. Some of the lands I was under the neces- 
sity of stating at rents promised in the original contracts, whilst 
from other tenants I obtained a statement of the reductions of rent 
which had been allowed for some time past, and which were ex- 
pected to be continued. The following is nearly the value and 
measurement of the properties separately, —

Agriculture has been much improved in • this parish during 
the last twenty or thirty years. Both landlords and tenants are 
on the alert to carry into practice every improvement which 
promises beneficial results. Those improvements suggested by 
Sir John Sinclair have been carried much farther than he could 
have anticipated at that time ; and many new plans have been 
adopted, and experiments made which Sir John did not think of, but 
which he would have highly approved, had he been consulted as 
to their propriety. The system of green cropping which he recom- 
mended has become quite general. 

The moors have thoroughly been brought into cultivation, if 
ever there was much land of that description in the parish. They 
have all vanished at the touch of cultivation, and those lands 
which were, forty yeais ago, covered with heath, now wave 
with barley, or are covered with rye-grass and clover they are 
now cultivated fields, shorn with the scythe, and levelled with the 
roller. But still it must be observed that, unless a fac-simile of the 
land in its original state could be preserved, it is impossible after- 
wards to estimate either the extent of the improvement, or the la- 
bour and expenses which it required. This remark is particular- 
ly applicable to draining, which is one of our greatest improve- 
ments. 

All the lands in this parish are now well enclosed and divided, 
and the rotation of crops strictly adhered to. Bone manure has 
lately been introduced and applied to raising turnips, which are fed 
off with sheep. This promises to be the greatest improvement 
which has been discovered for many years, and will probably be 



GLASSERTON. 



43 



looked upon hereafter as the beglnnuig of a new era in the his- 
tory of farmhig. Change of manure seems to be as essential as 
change of crops. Lime, when often repeated, loses much of its 
efficacy. It acts only as a"stimulant at best, and, after two or three 
repetitions, the land can be stimulated no longer, being exhausted, 
unless new strength is supplied by dung, or some other substan- 
tial manure ; and the quantity of dung which can be raised on a 
farm is very limited, and inadequate for keeping the land in proper 
condition ; — then it is too heavy and bulky a substance to be im- 
ported or carried from a distance ; consequently, farmers had the 
greatest difficulty in obtaining a sufficient quantity of manure for 
their green crop fields. Indeed, this difficulty was so great, that 
the land seldom got half the manure which it required. This dif- 
ficulty is now completely obviated by the application of bone dust. 
This is the most portable of all manures. Twenty or thirty im- 
perial bushels of it are the allowance for an acre of turnips. The 
carriage of this quantity from England or Ireland does not come 
to more than 2s. 6d. or 3s. : and a single horse cart will carry 
thirty bushels from the sea -port to the farm. Steep hills can now 
be manured with bone-dust, without subjecting horses to labour so 
hard and oppressive, that they were often wind-broken, and ren- 
dered nearly useless for life, — for this was a frequent occurrence 
in drawing dung and compost up to the tops of the mountains. 
Under these advantages, a greater quantity of grain will no doubt 
be raised in this part of the country ; and steam navigation being 
introduced about the same time, affirds greater facility in carrying 
produce to market, than the farmers in this neighbourhood have 
been hitherto accustomed to enjoy. But to say the truth, all 
these advantages were required to support the drooping spirits of 
the Galloway farmers, for, notwithstanding all the indulgence of 
their landlords, which has been very great indeed, they have been 
struggling with difficulties for at least these twenty years. They 
were difficulties too, of such magnitude, that several have sunk 
under them, and very few have been able to fulfil the engagements 
entered into with their landlords. 

The system of tillage generally followed in this place is one 
crop of oats in opening up a field ; next year, a green crop, either 
of potatoes or turnips ; the third, it is sown out with rye-grass and 
clover, along with wheat, barley or oats ; then a hay crop is taken ; 
and after that, the field returns to pasture, for a longer or shorter 
period, according to the number of divisions in the farm. Three 



44 



WIGTONSHIRE. 



or four years pasture is the general practice, but circumstances 
may occur which may warrant a change m this rotation. Landlords 
always lay down a specific plan of management in their contracts 
with tenants ; but they are very indulgent, and seldom interfere 
with a tenant's management. Indeed, the interests of landlord 
and tenant lie quite in the same direction, and what is good for the 
one, is seldom bad for the other. 

It is unnecessary to describe the various instruments of husban- 
dry used in this place, for they are quite the same here as in any 
place where an improved system of agriculture has been introdu- 
ced. Everything which can shorten labour or save expense is as 
readily adopted here as the best friends of improvement could de- 
sire. There is now nothing of prejudice, and no obstinate adhe- 
rence to old customs and habits in these matters. 

It might be inferred from the preceding observations, that 
this is a cropping district, and entirely under the dominion of the 
plough : the south side of the parish, in fact, is nearly all arable. 
Yet a considerable proportion of the best land in the parish is 
permanently in grass, at least it has not been disturbed by the 
ploughshare for the last sixty or seventy years. Indeed, some of 
the finest pasture land in Galloway is in this parish, and its excel- 
lence is generally known and acknowledged by all the graziers and 
cattle-dealers in the south of Scotland. 

Until within the last seventy or eighty years, the quantity of 
land under tillage was trifling in comparison to its present extent. 
This was the case not only in this parish, but through the whole 
of this part of the country. The farm-houses were generally 
placed on a spot of fine dry land, the richest and best which the 
firm contained, and in the neighbourhood of a clear perennial 
spring ; for that was an object to which the people then strictly 
attended. Having thus chosen the most favourable situation they 
could find for their farm-steading, they enclosed round about it 
ten, twenty, or thirty acres, more or less, in proportion to the size 
of the farm. This field was called the Fey and was cropped al- 
most without intermission. It received all the manure which could 
be collected about the place. Hence the distinction between 
fev-land and out-field land : the out-field being either not en- 
closed, or but partially enclosed, was used mostly for pasture, and 
the fey for cropping. This arrangement was the more convenient, 
because, in these times, there was no such thing as a cart. The 
dung was carried in two creels or hampers, slung across a horse's 



GLASSERTON. 



45 



back. The bottom of the hamper was fastened with a pin put 
through a staple or iron loop, and when they wanted to disload 
their caro-o they had only to take out the pin, when the bottom of 
the hamper opened, and the contents fell out without removal of 
the creels from the horse's back. This, to be sure, was but a slow 
Bnd troublesome method of carrying out manure, but, not unfre- 
quently, a still more laborious and tedious process was submitted 
to, for the people sometimes carried the creel upon their own backs, 
and the writer of this Report is old enough to remember having 
seen this method practised in the moorland parts of this county. 
When the wearisomeness and drudgery of these operations are 
taken into consideration, it is not very wonderful that manure was 
not carried to a greater distance, or that the fey, as they called it, 
should have the benefit of the whole manure collected in the farm. 
This, then, was the origin of what is now called rich old fey-land. 
A field of a good natural soil being selected, it received the whole 
of the dung for very many years. Among the other good qualities 
of rich fey-land, this is one, that it does not deteriorate by remain- 
ing in pasture ; but, on the contrary, continues to improve. This 
will account for the above assertion, that the best pasture in the 
county is to be found in this parish, for there are several fields of 
fey-land in pasture, which have not been ploughed for upwards of 
eighty years. 

Breeds of Live- Stock. — The breed of Galloway cattle here has 
hitherto been preserved pure and genuine ; and this parish has al- 
ways been considered as forming part of that particular district in 
the county, where the Galloway breed of cattle is to be found in 
its utmost perfection. But I am afraid the time is approaching, when 
it shall only be said that such things icere, and when it may be even 
necessary to appeal to such a record as this to prove the fact. 

The dairy system is now beginning to be considered more pro- 
fitable than breeding. This is an opinion which is fast gaining 
ground. And we have already in this parish three or four farms 
stocked with Ayrshire cows. This of course will contaminate the 
Galloway breed, perhaps displace it altogether. For the progress 
of contamination will be more rapid here, than almost any where 
else : for this reason, that feeding calves for veal is never practised in 
this part of the country. Besides, in order to unite the two systems 
together, I mean breeding and cheese-making, Galloway bulls are 
used, which produce black stock. This first cross isgrowthy, and feeds 
well. Some think that they even come to maturity sooner than 
the true Galloway breed : — of course the bullocks of this descrip-

tion bring nearly as much money as the native breed, and the cross- 
bred queys are often kept, from a notion that they will prove 
good milkers ; and sometimes they are passed off for true Gal- 
loways. The consequence of this will be, the introduction of a 
spurious, thin-haired, degenerate race of cattle. The causes which 
we have now mentioned are quite sufficient to produce that result; 
but some believe that there are other less obvious causes which have 
a tendency to increase the evil, and to accelerate the progress of 
deterioration. They believe that the very sight of Ayrshire cows 
in the neighbourhood corrupts the native breed, and that it often 
causes Galloways of the purest breed, and blackest colour, to pro- 
duce red, speckled, and spotted calves. 

There is nothing remarkable in our breed of horses now. For- 
merly Galloway was celebrated for its horses, which were small in 
size, beautifully symmetrical, and possessed of a great deal of ac- 
tion. So famousjwere they in these respects, that a handsome active 
little horse, useful for all purposes, has generally obtained the name 
of a Galloway. But this native breed is nearly, if not altogether, ex- 
tinct ; what has mostly been bred here for many years, is the com- 
mon cart-horse, of no very superior qualities. An attempt, indeed, 
was lately made to breed from blood-horses with cart mares, by 
way of getting a more lightsome, active sort of horse, and more 
convertible to different purposes. But this project seems to have 
failed, as many of this breed were not very suitable for any purpose 
whatever ; and farmers have now mostly turned their attention to 
improving the breed of strong draught horses. 

The sheep bred in this parish are but few. They seldom ex- 
ceed 12 or 16 breeding ewes to each farm, and these are gene- 
rally Leicesters. Those who fatten sheep on turnips during the 
winter, purchase them at Falkirk in October ; but they are brought 
from Minigaff also, or any place in the neighbourhood where they 
can be found. The farmers do not confine themselves to any par- 
ticular place or sort of sheep, but the Highland sheep seem to be 
preferred. Their inlaid cost may average about L. 1 a head, and 
their value when fattened about L. 1, 16s., or rather from L. 1, 10s. 
to L. 2 ; for their price is subject to considerable fluctuations. 

Fisheries. — There are no fisheries on the Glasserton coast. Small 
two-oared boats in the summer season take a few cod and other kinds 
of white-fish with bait. I believe there are not half a dozen such 
boats in the parish, and they are employed sometimes as an amuse- 
ment, and as a bye-job, when there is little else to do, or by old

people who are unfit for harder labour. It has been attempted to 
take salmon with a draw-net at a place opposite the little village of 
Monrieth ; but the plan does not succeed well, and can only be 
practised in fine weather, and for a few days at a time during the 
spring tides. The coast is too rocky for fishing in this way, at 
least to any extent. 

Wages. — Men-servants by the half-year, with victuals, L.5 or 
guineas; women-servants from L.2 to L.2, 10s.; harvest wages 
for men from L.2 to L.2, 3s., for women about L. 1, 10s. The 
day's wages is Is. 4d. in summer, and Is. 2d. in winter; day's 
wages in harvest about 2s. without victuals. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Means of Communication. — I have already mentioned the intro- 
duction of steam navigation as one of our very recent improvements. 
Since I commenced writing this report, I understand that the prin- 
cipal land proprietors in the county have made an arrargement with 
Government for a mail-coach to run from Newtonstewart by Wig- 
ton, Garliestown, Whithorn, Port- William, and Glenluce,to Stran- 
raer. This road passes through the parish of Glasserton ; entering 
this parish about half a mile from the burgh of Whithorn, it conti- 
nues in it to the village of Monrieth, within two miles of Port- 
William, which is eight miles from Whithorn. Hitherto, New- 
tonstewart was the nearest point at which the mail could be reach- 
ed, which is twenty-two miles from the church of Glasserton. 
This arrangement, therefore, may be considered as a great advan- 
tage to this part of the country. 

Villages, 5fc. — This parish contains no towns, and only one village. 
The nearest market-town is Whithorn. There is no pubhc or pri- 
vate associations of any description, and neither trade nor manufac- 
tures. It is entirely an agricultural parish ; and the few mechanics 
which belong to it are dependent on or connected with agriculture, 
suchas smiths, joiners, shoemakers, tailors ; but weavers have nearly 
vanished, and the inhabitants chiefly depend upon the manufactures 
of other places for their clothing. Spinning and knitting, which 
formerly was the employment of old and infirm women, is no 
longer practised. Indeed, that class have been the greatest suf- 
ferers from the introduction of machinery, for it has taken from 
them the only employment which they had strength to perform, 
and their sole means of subsistence. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church stands a,t the distance of 
about 600 yards north of Glasserton House. It is surrounded 



48 



WlGTONSHIRE. 



with Wood. It is nearly in the centre of Glasserton pleasure- 
grounds, which Mr Stewart of Physgill, the present proprietor, has 
greatly enlarged. The lawn or park in which the church stands 
is exceedingly beautiful, and the most extensive of any in this 
part of the country, containing upwards of 150 acres of the 
richest pasture ground, ornamented with plantations, as well as an 
immense number of single trees scattered over its whole surface, 
tastefully and judiciously arranged, so as to produce the finest ef- 
fect in passing along the approaches to Glasserton. Many of the 
single trees were transplanted on Sir Henry Steuart's plan. 

The church was built in the year 1732, exactly in the same 
style in which all country churches were built about that period. 
It is still strong and substantial both in walls and roof, but too 
small for the increasing population ; for at present it contains only 
about 270 sittings in the under part of the church. The galleries 
are private property, belonging to the family of Physgill and Glas- 
serton ; each of these estates having a gallery, but they both be- 
long to the same family. The heritors, however, have agreed to 
make an addition, by adding an aisle to the old church : and at the 
end of the aisle, is to be erected a handsome tower, 68 feet in 
height. The work is contracted for, materials provided, and on 
the 19th May 1 836, the tradesmen commenced building. The old 
church also is to be seated anew, and otherwise repaired. There 
have been no free sittings in the church hitherto, but it is proposed 
that some part of the addition shall be free. 

The church is much nearer the east than the west end of the pa- 
rish. The parish appears to have been formed by the junction of 
two parishes, Glasserton and Kirkmaiden. But there are no docu- 
ments to show at what time this annexation had taken place. A part 
of the walls of Kirkmaiden church still remain pretty entire. It is 
situated near the sea shore, not far from Monrieth. It lies close to 
the bottom of the Heughs, or rather it is embosomed in a kind of 
recess formed by these steep hills. The road to it winds down the 
brow of the hill, and at last ends in a flight of steps leading into 
the church-yard. The slope of the surrounding hill is covered 
with young wood. Altogether it is scarcely possible to conceive 
that a church could be placed in a more romantic situation. It is 
indeed a beautiful sequestered spot, but never could have been a 
convenient situation for a church, for it lies in a corner where even 



 The addition and repairs here alluded to have since been comiileled : 
church now contains 400 sittings. 



GLASSERTON.

now the population is small, and must have been much smaller in 
those times, when it was frequented as a place of worship. It is 
still used as burial ground by some of the old residenters in this 
parish ; and Sir William Maxwell's family, though not residing in 
the parish, have their burial-place within the walls of the old 
church of Kirkmaiden. 

The attendance on public worship in this parish is regular, 
notwithstanding of many disadvantages, such as the length of the 
parish, the church not being in the centre. Besides, there is 
no village near it, and the population in the neighbourhood is 
small, as the greater part of Glasserton estate is in pasture ground. 
A very handsome house and stable has been built by Mr Stewart 
of Physgill, at the church gate, entirely for the accommodation 
of the parish, — which certainly has removed many of the inconve- 
niences to which we allude. More accommodation at times would, 
no doubt, be desirable. 

The manse was built in 1818, is commodious, substantial, and 
in good repair. The glebe contains about 15 Scotch acres, and 
might, perhaps, be valued at L. 20 a-year. The minister's stipend 
averages about L. 190. The original valuation being mostly in 
money, it is subject to no great variation. The teinds are ex- 
hausted by the present stipend. 

Dissenters have changed their tactics very much lately. In 
my younger days, they were proud to be considered, or rather to 
consider themselves, the chosen feio. Now, there is no possibility 
of satisfying them with numbers. They are determined to be con- 
sidered as the manij, and that distinction, which they were for- 
merly so proud of, they are now extremely desirous should be 
conferred upon the Established Church. And as I should be 
sorry to disturb them, even in their dreams, I shall refrain from 
saying how few they are, though truth will not permit me to say 
that they are many. But, what is far more to the purpose, the 
Dissentmg families which are old residenters in the parish are 
both prudent and respectable ; they maintain their own opinions, 
and worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience, 
without giving the least offence to any of their neighbours. We 
have no voluntaries, at least as far as I know ; but it is really dif- 
ficult to speak with precision, from the fact of the farm-servants, 
bound-workers, and day-labourers being in a state of continual 
fluctuation; they change from parish to parish so frequently, that

a clergyman has not the means of knowing their religious tenets 
and their speculative opinions. 

Educatio7i.— There is an excellent school-house and school- 
master's house. The schoolmaster's salary is the maximum, that 
is, L. 34 a-year. The school fees may amount to L. 25 a-year. 
The school-house is not at the church, but two miles west, upon 
the road leading to Monrieth and Port- William. It stands nearly 
in the centre of the parish, but certainly not in the middle of the 
population, for a circle drawn round it with the radius of a mile 
would not contain many houses. 

There is another school in the north-west end of the parish, at 
Ravenstone, to which there is annexed, besides the school-fees, a 
salary of L. 15 per annum, — L. 10 of which are contributed by 
Mrs Stewart of Physgill, and L. 5 by Mrs- Hathorn of Castle- 
wigg, who also joined in a general subscription for erecting the 
school-house and schoolmaster's house. These are built on the 
property of the Earl of Stair, who granted the ground rent-free 

for that purpose. 

Education at these schools costs from 2s. to 3s. a quarter for 
reading, writing, and arithmetic. The children of the poor are 
tauo-ht free at the parish school, at the recommendation of the 
heritors and kirk-session. And w"hen apphcations of this kind are 
so numerous, that the session consider them too burdensome to 
the schoolmaster, they pay him from the poor's funds, at a lower 
rate than the usual wages ; and not unfrequently poor children are 
sent to school at the expense of charitable individuals in the 
neighbourhood. Altogether, the means of instruction are per- 
fectly accessible to the poorest individuals ; and there is no 
such thing to be found in this parish as children of six or seven 
years of age who cannot read. The population, however, is too 
thinly scattered to admit of infant schools, consequently, their first 
instructions are received from their parents at home, chiefly from 
their mother ; and then, whenever they have strength enough to 
travel two or three miles, they are sent to school. The people 
are perfectly alive to the advantages of education, and make every 
effort to have their children suitably instructed. 

Schoolmasters sometimes complain of the difficulties of collect- 
ing their fees ; but I believe there is less foundation for this com- 
plaint than is generally believed. I have known many who are 
exceedingly poor, that would rather want some of then- own ne- 
cessary sustenance than have their children's education neglected ;

and they consider school wages as a debt of honour, which they 
would pay, though they had nothing left, or though other debts should 
not be discharged. I must, however, admit, that these honourable 
feelings were more general thirty years ago than they are now. 
The habit of receiving assistance diminishes exertion ; and the 
habit of receiving charity destroys the spirit of independence. 

Poor. — The number of poor in this parish is not great, vary- 
ing perhaps from 15 to 20 ; but not more than a half of these are 
supported entirely from the church funds. Some of them receive 
from 5s. to 10s. per quarter ; and their other wants are supplied 
by their own industry, or the aid and assistance of their relatives, 
and the private charity of their neighbours. But though the 
number of poor is not great, and the allowance for their support 
very little, yet the demand upon the poor funds exceeds the sup- 
ply, and requires to be eked out by a voluntary contribution of 
L. 13 per annum from the heritors. This is rendered necessary 
at present by having on our list two helpless idiots, and an indi- 
vidual who was born without either legs or arms, now about twenty- 
two years of age, and in perfect health. In such extraordinary 
cases as these we have recourse to the heritors. The collections 
at the church on Sundays may amount to L. 20 or L. 25 yearly ; 
interest of money belonging to the funds to about L. 6 ; and fines' 
proclamations, and mortcloth-money may come to L. 6 or L. 8 
more. This is the whole of our revenue, which cannot afford 
much to every one,— and, indeed, would be no very extravagant 
ahment for a smgle individual ; and yet these poor people are con- 
tented and wonderfully happy. But still the tendency of pau- 
perism here, as almost everywhere else, is to increase. The poor 
list has been nearly doubled since I came to this parish in 1813 • 
and the collections more than doubled. '

PRESBYTERY OF WIGTON, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY. 

THE REV. CHRISTOPHER NICHOLSON, MINISTER. 



I. Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, -c— The ancient natnes of Candida Ca- 
sa, Leucophibia or Leucopibia, by which this town and parish were 
formerly described, and the name Whithern or Whithorn, by which 
it is now known, seem to have had the same origin. In Bedels 
history, mention is made of a church built of stone and Ume in this 
place, which is generally admitted to have been the first that was 
erected in Scotland of these materials, and which, of course, was 
denominated in the Roman language Candida Casa. Leucophibia, 
or Leucopibia, seems to be a corruption of X£ux-om8/a, the Greek 
for a white house ; and Hwitaern, which transcribers have changed 
into Whithern, and now into Whithorn, is compounded of two 
Saxon words, both signifying the same thing, as the Greek word. 

This parish is upwards of 8 miles in its extreme length from 
north to south, and 5 in its extreme breadth from east to west. It 
is so irregular as a whole, that there is no mathematical figure by 
which it can be described. It is bounded on the north and east 
by the parish of Sorbie; on the south-east by Wigton Bay; on the 
■ south by the Irish Sea; and on the west by the parish of Glasser- 
ton • and contains about 10,000 imperial acres. 

Topographical Appearances.— Ixx pomt of scenery, this parish has 
nothing to boast of; the surface is almost level, and has neither 
mountain nor glen, hill nor dale, wood nor forest, to interrupt its 
uniformity At the same time, it is abundantly diversified by a 
ereat variety of knolls of all shapes and sizes, generally consisting 
of gravel or rock, covered with a thin layer of earth sufficient to 
nourish whins, sloe-bushes, and briers, with which they are usually 
covered,-the only shrubs that seem to grow spontaneously,— and 
which, viewed at a distance, give the most fertile parts of the parish 

a very barren appearance. . . , . . , , • 

Hydrography. -Theve is nothing in this parish deserving the 



WHITHORN. 53 

name of a river, as might be supposed from the narrow peninsular 
country in which it is situated. There are three burns, each of 
which turns a corn and barley-mill, where it falls into the sea. But 
though there are no rivers and few burns, the parish is well watered 
with Innumerable perennial limpid rills, which are of the utmost 
benefit to the comfort of the inhabitants, and the health and im- 
provement of the cattle. There is a weak chalybeate spring at the 
Isle of Whithorn, occasionally resorted to by invalids. The lakes 
that were formerly in the parish have been drained, and all of that 
description that remains is a few mosses and marl pits. 

Meteorology. — The soil in this parish and district is, in general, 
dry, — the air pure, mild, and temperate. Epidemic diseases and 
malignant fevers are of rare occurrence. There has been no in- 
stance of spasmodic cholera in this parish. Many of the inhabi- 
tants attain the age of eighty years ; a few ninety and upwards. The 
medium temperature of the atmosphere is about 48°. The pre- 
vailing winds are the south-west and west, excepting in the spring 
months, when the parish is frequently visited with gales from the 
east, which are extremely hurtful to vegetation. The heaviest 
rains are from the south, south-east, and south-west. The win- 
ters for several years have been so extremely mild, that many black- 
cattle have been wintered in the pastures without fodder. Frost 
and snow have been of such rare occurrence, and of such short 
continuance, that the children in Whithorn run the risk of becom- 
ing as incredulous about the effect of cold upon water as the Em- 
peror of China. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The soil of a considerable portion 
of this parish consists of a rich vegetable mould of no great depth, 
but exceedingly fertile, affording the most succulent and nutritious 
pasture and excellent crops, when there is a sufficiency of mois- 
ture in the month of May. When there is a deficiency of mois- 
ture at that season, the pastures are but scanty, and the crops light. 
The most productive soil rests upon rock ; where the subsoil is till, 
the ground is less fertile, and the pastures and crops much later. 
The rocks invariably dip to the west, and generally belong to the 
greywacke series. There are no continued beds of granite, but 
large detached blocks are met with here and there. The shore 
is everywhere rugged and rocky. At Burrowhead, the coast is 
particularly bold, and the rocks, from their perpendicular height, 
magnificent and sublime, rising to a height of 200 feet, and per- 
forated here and there with deep caves. Trial has been repeat-

edly made for coal, but hitherto without success. Upon the estate 
of Tonderghie, close by the shore, a mining company, belonging 
to Wales, sunk a shaft to a considerable depth in quest of copper, 
and succeeded in discovering a small scattered vein, and procured 
a few very rich specimens of ore. The attempt was discontinued 
at a time when every interest in the country was involved in ge- 
neral distress. 

II. — Civil History. 

Burgh. — Whithorn, which was constituted a royal burgh by 
James IV. in 1511, is governed by a provost, two bailies, and fif- 
teen councillors, and one of four that return a Member to Parlia- 
ment. The burgh of Whithorn consists chiefly of one street, 
running from north to south, which is very irregular, being inconve- 
niently narrow at both extremities, and uselessly wide in the middle. 
The town-house and gaol were removed about twenty years ago from 
the middle of the street, where they formerly stood, and are now 
erected upon the west side of the street, about the centre of the 
town, and ornamented with a steeple. The dwelling-houses have 
been much improved since the termination of the war with France, 
many old ones having been pulled down, and new ones erected on 
the same site. This change seems rather to have been owing to 
the reduction of interest than the demand for better dwellings, as 
many who had money in the banks were of opinion that it could 
be invested in houses to more advantage, — which experience seems 
not to justify. The burgh has a small revenue, about L. 100 yearly, 
arising from harbour-dues and fees. 

Eminent Men. — St Ninian was born in this place or neighbour- 
hood during the fourth century ; and to that circumstance it seems 
to have owed its celebrity as a religious establishment. This emi- 
nent individual went to Rome about the year 370, where be was 
ordained Bishop of Britons, Upon his return to his native place, 
he there founded a church, which he dedicated to his uncle, St 
Martin of Tours in France, and within the walls of which he was 
afterwards buried. This church has been so completely dilapi- 
dated by the lapse of time and the ruthless hand of man, that only 
a few old arches remain to tell of its original grandeur. There 
was also erected here a famous priory of the Premonstratensian 
order, by Fergus, Lord of Galloway, who flourished in the reign of 
David I., in which some of the innumerable relics of St Ninian were 
deposited. Hither pilgrims resorted from distant places, not only 
of Scotland but of England and Ireland, attracted by the remark- 



WHITMORN. 



55 



able veneration in which the very name and memory of St Ninian 
were held. . Even royalty itself paid honours to his memorji ; for 
in the summer of 1473, Margaret, Queen of James III., made a 
pilgrimao-3 to Whithorn, and James IV., during his reign, made 
not only one but several pilgrimages to the sepulchre of St Ninian. 
There were belonging to this place two famous priors, the one 
called Gavin Dunbar, afterwards Archbishop of Glasgow, the other 
James Beton, Archbishop of Glasgow, next of St Andrews, and 
Chancellor of Scotland. For more minute information, consult 
Murray's Lit. Hist, of Galloioay. 

Antiquities. — In this parish, there are the remains of a Roman 
camp about half a mile to the west of the town of Whithorn, on 
the lands of Stair H. Stewart, Esq, There are likewise several 
forts or castles upon the shore, all looking towards the Isle of 
Man, — which had possibly been erected to protect the country 
against the inroads of the Scandinavians, who made that island the 
place of their rendezvous. One of the old arches in the church- 
yard, purely of the Saxon order, and almost entire, is much ad- 
mired, as the most perfect of its kind that exists in the .country. 
There is also in the churchyard a large vault, and others have 
lately been discovered apparently of great extent, and which there 
is no doubt were attached to the priory. Roman coins also are 
not unfrequently found in the grounds adjoining the site of the 
priory. At the Isle of Whithorn, a marine village, about three 
miles south of the burgh, there are the remains of the walls of an 
old church of very small dimensions, which is reported not with- 
out probability to have been the first place of Christian worship 
built in North Britain. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners in the parish are, the 
Earl of Galloway; Hugh Hathorn, Esq. of Castlewiggj Stair H. 
Stewart, Esq. of Physgill and Glasserton; Alexander Murray, Esq. 
of Broughton; Hugh D. Stewart, Esq. of Tonderghie; Sir Andrew 
Agnew of Lochnaw, Bart. ; and two or three small crofters. Two 
of the principal heritors reside in the parish, namely, Hugh Ha- 
thorn, Esq. of Castlewigg, and Hugh D. Stewart, Esq. of Ton- 
derghie. 

Parochial Registers. — The earliest parochial register, containing 
births, baptisms, marriages, poor-roll, and funds, goes no farther 
back than 1796. The register of births and baptisms has been 
very irregularly kept, owing to the negligence of parents.

Character, c. of the People. — The chief occupation is agricul- 
ture, and such pursuits as are requisite for the improvement of the 
soil. The famiUes originally belonging to the parish are gene- 
rally sober, honest, and industrious ; the families which have im- 
migrated from Ireland are not deserving of such a character. Po- 
tatoes are the principal food of the Irish families during three- 
quarters of the year, and even in labourers' families of Scottish 
descent, occupy a chief place both at dinner and supper. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The whole surface of the parish is arable, except- 
ing a small extent of peat-moss, a few marl bogs, and the knolls 
with which the surface is occasionally broken. The extent of 
meadow land is small, not exceeding 200 acres. Plantations are 
confined to a few rows and clumps, excepting around the mansion- 
house of Castlewigg, where forest trees cover a larger extent of 
ground. 

Bent of Land. — The rent varies much according to locality and 
quality. Crofts in the immediate vicinity of the burgh and the 
Isle of Whithorn, which are let out in small extent for the accom- 
modation of the inhabitants, rent on an average as high as L. 3 
per imperial acre ; large farms of the best description of soil at 
L. 1, 10s. and inferior farms from 12s. to 16s. per imperial acre. 
The rent of the parish is about L. 9000 yearly. 

Bate of aes.— Ploughmen of the first excellence, living in the 
farmer's house, receive from L. 10, 10s. to L. 12, 12s. yearly. 
Workmen living in their own families generally receive a benefit, 
which prevents the amount of their wages from being accurately 
ascertained,— as that to a certain extent depends on the price of 
provisions ; but it may be fixed somewhere betwixt L. 20 and L. 25 
yearly. Female servants receive from L. 2, 5s. to L. 3 the half 
year ; male labourers in the summer Is. 4d. to Is. 6d. ; and fe- 
males 8d. to 9d. a-day. During the harvest, males and females 
earn the same wages ; in ordinary harvests about 2s. per day with- 
out meat, and Is. 6d. with food ; occasionally 2s. 6d. and even 3s. 
thout food ; masons, 2s. 6d., and joiners, 2s. 3d. without board.

Breed of Live-Stock. — Formerly the Galloway breed of cattle 
was universally reared in this parish, and the greatest attention was 
paid to its improvement. Farmers from other parts of the country, 
desirous of improving their breeding stock, regularly applied to 
the farmers in this parish for young bulls and queys. Of late 
years, dairies have been introduced, and the Ayrshire breed is 
threatening to supplant the Galloway. The young cattle that 
were formerly reared in this country, and driven into England to 
be fed for the London market, are now to a considerable extent 
kept in the country until they are fit for the butcher market, and 
others shipped to Liverpool. The favourite breed of horses for 
the cart and plough is a low, flat, heavy-bodied, and rough legged 
breed : sheep, a cross betwixt the Leicester ram and the Mug and 
Cheviot ewe. 

Husbandry. — Farming in this district is every day arriving at 
higher excellence. The bone manure has given such an impetus 
to green crop, that turnip husbandry during the last ten years has 
increased at least tenfold. The turnips are partly eaten off" with 
sheep, and partly lifted for cattle fed in stalls. The rotation general- 
ly practised by crofters is the six year shift, a white crop, a green 
crop, a white crop with grass seeds, a hay crop, and two years in 
pasture. Upon large farms, the nine or ten years shift, — two white 
crops, a green crop, a white crop with grass seeds, a hay crop, 
and four or five years in pasture. Wheat is not cultivated to any 
extent, as it exhausts the strength of the land, and is very detri- 
mental to both hay and pasture. As to the produce of the parish, 

that depends upon so many circumstances, and is so various, one 
year differing so much from another, that any attempt at ascertain- 
ing its extent would be mere conjecture. A farmer, for instance, one 
year fatted upwards of fourscore swine ; other years, much fewer. 
An acre of wheat one year may yield 20 bushels ; and the same 
extent of ground next year, 40. The farmers in general are very 
comfortably lodged, with farm-steadings suitable for the dimen- 
sions of the farms, and both dwelling-houses and offices covered 
with slate. The duration of leases is from twelve to nineteen 
years. The crofts around the town are usually let for twelve 
years, and the large farms for nineteen. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Means of Communication. — The parish is easy of access both by 
land and water. At the isle, there is a very safe and commodious 
harbour, where a quay or pier was erected above forty years ago by 



58 



WIGTONSIIIRE. 



the assistance of the Convention of Royal Burghs; from which, small 
vessels sail every week to Whitehaven and other English ]orts, 
and which is occasionally visited by the Galloway steamer on her 
way to and from Liverpool. There are public roads from Wig- 
ton and Garliestown to the Isle of Whithorn, and from Whit- 
horn to Port William and Stranraer. A mail-coach traverses the 
parish, passing through the burgh from west to east in the fore- 
noon, and from east to west in the evening. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is very happily situat- 
ed upon a rising ground to the west of the burgh, in its immediate 
vicinity, and no situation more convenient for the country population 
could be found. A few years ago, this place of worship was in a 
very ruinous condition. In 1822, the heritors erected a very sub- 
stantial, commodious new church, with ample accommodation for 
800 sitters, besides free seats for a very considerable number of 
those who have no room in the church, and no means of procuring 
any. The church is regularly well attended, and the number of 
communicants is about 600. 

Besides the church, there are three other places of worship, one 
belonging to the Associate Synod, another to the Reformed Pres- 
byterian Synod, and a third to the Roman Catholics. Two of 
these have no settled pastor ; the congregations attending them are 
widely dispersed over different parishes, and very inconsiderable 
in number, compared with the congregation attending the Esta- 
blished Church. 

The number of families belonging to the Established Church is 
420 ; of families belonging to the Associate Synod, 45 ; to the Ca- 
meronians, 27 ; Roman Catholic families, 12. There are a con- 
siderable number of poor Irish families that belong to no place 
of worship. 

The manse was built twenty-four years ago, and is spacious and 
commodious. The glebe contains about 6 acres of rich arable 
ground, and would give a rent of about L. 20 per annum. The 
stipend is 17 chalders, half meal and half barley, with L. 10 Ster- 
ling for communion elements ; and was augmented in 1826. 

Education. — There are two parochial schools, and not fewer 
than nine other schools. The salary of one parochial schoolmas- 
ter is two chalders of meal and L. 6 for house rent. The salary of 
the other is one chalder of meal. Their school wages do not exceed 
L. 60 per annum. They have no other emoluments. The num- 
ber of children attending the different schools during the winter

season, cannot be less than between 300 and 400. All the usual 
branches of education are taught in both the parochial schools ; and 
in the other schools English reading, arithmetic, and writing. 
There are none in the parish descended from Scottish parents, that 
have attained the years of discretion uneducated. There are four 
Sabbath schools in the parish, well attended by children, who also 
receive family instruction in their own dwellings. Such as are 
neglected by their parents, seldom seek religious instruction from 
teachers. 

Savings Dank. — An institution of this kind has existed for near- 
ly twenty years, much to the benefit of individuals and families. 
The money deposited in it, is seldom below L. 2400, or above 
L. 2600. The money deposited and drawn during the year 
amounts to about L. 800. n 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — There are 70 paupers upon the 
poor's roll at present, who receive assistance every quarter of the 
year, a few to the extent of L. 4 yearly, and the rest betwixt 
L. 1 and L. 2. The funds for the poor arise out of collections in 
the church, proclamation dues, mortcloth hire, and voluntary 
contributions from the heritors. The heritors' contributions amount 
to about L. 50 a-year. The kirk-session in ordinary years distri- 
bute about L. 120, and the collections in the church average about 
L. 60 yearly. 

Fuel. — The parish is supplied with peats to a considerable ex- 
tent, and where peats are too distant to be sought after, with 
Whitehaven coals discharged from sloops at the Isle of Whithorn, 
and sold at Is. per bushel of three Winchesters. Irish families 
generally depend upon whins and brambles, which they carry in 
burdens upon their backs, to the no small annoyance of proprie- 
tors and farmers through whose grounds they travel. 

Fairs and Markets. — There are two fairs in the year, the one 

at Midsummer, and the other at Lammas ; and a monthly cattle 
market from April to January. 

Friendly Societies. — A few years ago, there were two Friendly 
Societies ; but the disbursements did not correspond with the con- 
tributions, and they are now both extinct. 

Public-Houses.—These are all situated in the Burgh and Isle 
of Whithorn, and are at the very least five times more numerous 
than they ought to be. Every one that asks a license obtains it 5 
and the magistrates justify their conduct in granting licenses by 
saying it is an evil that will cure itself.

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The greatest grievance that is felt in this parish at present, and 
which is most detrimental to its respectabiUty and improvement, 
is the extent of emigration, and the description of people that emi- 
grate. Our native labourers and artisans, with their little proper- 
ty and many virtues, are drifting across the Atlantic, and Ireland, 
from her exhaustless store, is supplying their place. The num- 
ber of Irish families that every year take up their abode in this 
place is almost incredible. These are possessed of nothing but a 
number of naked, starving children. The supply of labourers 
usually exceeds the demand, and wages are thereby reduced so 
low, that Scottish labourers who wish to feed, clothe, and educate 
their children, have it not in their power, and are compelled to 
seek in a foreign country what is denied them in their own. The 
children of Irish parents are driven out to seek food where they 
can find it ; and if clad and educated they are so at the expense of 
others. Unless means are immediately devised for arresting the 
progress of such a national calamity, the labourers in Scotland will 
soon be reduced to the level of the lowest of the Irish ; and the only 
means of accomplishing this is a legal provision for the poor Irish 
in their own country.

PRESBYTERY OF WIGTON, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER YOUNG, MINISTER. 



I. Topography and Natural History. 

Extent, Boundaries.— Tn greatest length of the parish from 
east to west is about 10 miles, and the greatest breadth between 
4 and 5 miles. It is bounded on the south, by the Bay of Luce ; 
on the west, by the parish of Old Luce ; on the north, by Kirk- 
owan and Kirkinner; and on the east, by Glasserton. 

Surface, Soil, and Climate.—'' The general appearance of the 
surface cannot be denominated either level or mountainous; itispart- 
ly both. The flats, however, are not extensive, nor are the hills of

great elevation ; but being intermixed with each other, at mode- 
rate distances, they exhibit a variety of prospect not unpleasing to 
the traveller, nor vmprofitable to the owner. From the eastern 
boundary, along the Bay of Luce, for several miles, the soil, with 
a few exceptions, is excellent, being mostly of a fine light, and in 
some places, a strong deep loam. Approaching towards the centre 
of the parish, it becomes gradually more thin and stony, while a 
large extent, on the east and west sides, mostly consisting of rocky 
eminences, or mossy swamps and lakes, exhibits a bleak and bar- 
ren prospect, and is chiefly used for pasture. There are, how- 
ever, scattered up and down in this bleak region, some small 
pieces of good dry arable land. Owing, perhaps, to the general 
dryness of the soil, the openness of the country, and its fine expo- 
sure to the sea air, the climate is remarkably healthful. 

" Sea Coast. — A flat smooth gravel beach, mostly about 50 yards 
wide, runs along from the eastern, till within a mile of the west- 
ern extremity of the parish, where it is intercepted by a steep rocky 
hill projecting into the sea, and forming a bold inaccessible shore. 

" Parallel to the beach, the land, rising suddenly, forms a steep 
bank or precipice, which renders the access from the shore into 
the country, in many places, rather difficult." 

Geology. — Here, as in the county generally, the rocks belong 
to the Neptunian series of the transition class. 

II. — Civil History. 

Land-oicners. — The chief land-owners in the parish are. Sir 
William Maxwell, Bart, and the Marquis of Bute. 

The real rental of the parish is about L. 8000 per annum. 

Parochial Registers.— In these, births, marriages, and all mat- 
ters of church discipline are recorded; but until the settlement of 
the present incumbent in 1822, there were no parochial registers 
regularly kept. 

" Antiquities. — Near by the church, which is situated about a 
mile right into the parish from Port- William, there is a pretty 
large earthen mound, quite entire, with a deep ditch or Jbsse 
round it. 

" On the eastern extremity of the sea coast, at the summit of a 
steep bank, there are very distinct remains of an Anglo-Saxon 
camp. And, within two miles of the western extremity, also hard 
by the shore, stand the ruins of a small manse and church, called 
St Finian's Chapel, probably from the famous Saint of that name.

WIGTONSHIRE. 



" In the middle of the moor-land appears an old tower or castle, 
whose walls are very strong, and almost entire ; and being nearly 
sm-rounded by lakes, when viewed at a distance it has a most 
curious and picturesque appearance, resembling much a large ship 
at sea. 

" It is called the old Place of Mochrum ; and formerly belonged, 
together with a considerable estate contiguous to it, to an ancient 
family, of the name of Dunhar, who resided in it, were created 
Knights of Mochrum about a century ago, and still enjoy that 
title. But the castle and the property have now, for about one 
hundred years, been in possession of the Earl of Dumfries, now 
Marquis of Bute." 

Mansion-Houses. — The principal mansion-house in the parish 
is that of Monreith, belonging to Sir William Maxwell. There 
are five or six smaller mansions. 

Eminent Characters, — The Dunbars settled in Mochrum so 
early as the year 1368, Thomas Dunbar, the first of Mochrum, 
who was second son of Patrick, Earl of March, having got a grant 
of the lands in question and others in that year. The Mochrum 
branch of the Dunbars were long eminent, and cadets of this 
house founded the families of Dunbar of Baldoon, now represent- 
ed by the Earl of Selkirk, and Dunbar of Clugston. But the 
most eminent person of this name was Gavin Dunbar, son of Sir 
John Dunbar of Mochrum, and ultimately Archbishop of Glasgow, 
and Lord Chancellor of Scotland. Gavin having studied at Glas- 
gow, was appointed Prior of Whithorn about the year 1504, as 
successor to James Beaton, whom he afterwards succeeded in the 
see of Glasgow. Dunbar, being, says Keith, " a man of polite 
letters," was appointed preceptor to the young King James V.; a 
trust which he discharged so satisfactorily, that on the see of Glas- 
gow becoming vacant in 1522, he was nominated to that dignity. 
In 1526, he was appointed Lord Chancellor; and in 1536, when 
the King went to France, on his marriage to Magdalene, daugh- 
ter of Francis I. his Lordship was chosen one of the Lords of the 
Regency. When Lord Maxwell, in the year 1542, made a mo- 
tion in Parliament to the effect that the Bible be allowed to be 
read in our vernacular tongue, Archbishop Dunbar opposed it. 
The motion was, however, carried, but he entered the dissent 
against the decision in his own name, and in that of " all the pre- 
lates of the realm." He died in 1547. The family of Moch-

rum was raised to the baronetage in 1694, and is now represented 
by Sir William Rowe Dunbar, Bart. Murray's Literary Hist, of 
Gallowmj, 2d edit. 1832, p. 14-17. The Maxwells, Baronets 
of Monreith, have been settled in the parish for about two centuries. 
John Maxwell, younger of Monreith, having joined the Covenan- 
ters, and having been present at the battle of Pentland, in 1666, 
was exposed to much suffering and persecution. Though not in 
custody, he with many others were tried for treason and rebellion, 
and were condemned " to be executed to death, and demeaned as 
traitors, when they shall be apprehended." Wodrow's Church 
Hist. Vol. ii. p. 73-5. But Maxwell, though he made several 
narrow escapes, never fell into the hands of his enemies. He was 
pronounced by the famous Colonel Wallace " the greatest Chris- 
tian that he knew in his station and his name is honourably con- 
nected with the ecclesiastical history of his times. Memoirs of 
Veitch and Brysson, p. 381. The Maxwells of Monreith can 
also boast of having given birth to a family, several of whom have 
distinguished themselves. We refer to the family of Captain 
James Maxwell, youngest son of Sir William Maxwell of Mon- 
reith. Captain Maxwell had eight sons, of whom the following 
attained to distinction ; Major Stewart Maxwell, author of an ex- 
cellent poem, entitled " The Battle of the Bridge, or Pisa De- 
fended, in ten cantos," who died in 1824; Captains Keith and 
John Maxwells, who both distinguished themselves in the naval 
service, James's Naval Hist. Vol. iii. p. 214; and Sir Murray 
Maxwell, the commander of the Alceste which conveyed Lord 
Amherst as Ambassador to China. The Chinese having insulted 
the officers and crew of the Alceste, Captain Maxwell resolved to 
chastise them for their temerity. He chastised them accordingly, 
having himself fired the first gun, thus rendering himself personal- 
ly responsible for the consequences of the attack. The Alceste 
was wrecked by striking on a sunken rock on her return home ; 
a misfortune from which Captain Maxwell's character received 
even an additional brilliancy. The naratives of Captain Basil 
Hall and Mr M'Leod, surgeon of the Alceste, descriptive of this 
calamity, as well as illustrative of the expedition generally, form 
about the most interesting works of the kind known to us. On 
the accession of his late Majesty William IV. Sir Murray was 
nominated one of his naval aide-de-camps ; and in 1831 he was 
appointed Governor of Prince Edward's Island. On receiving no- 
tice of this appointment, he left Scotland in a vessel for London;

but being seized with fever, and there being no medical man on 
board, he died soon after his arrival in London, leaving behind 
him a name for professional merit, general honour, and integrity 
of character inferior to none. Murray's Literary Hhtory of Gal- 
loway, 2d ed. 1832, pp. 283-92, 343-4. 

III. — P0PULA.T10 
In the former Statistical Account, it is observed, " there is, 
perhaps, no country parish in the county that has increased so much 
in population as Mochrum for these last twenty years. The inha- 
bitants, who now amount to 1400, it is certain, did not exceed half 
the number previous to that period. This increase has been al- 
most entirely effected on Sir William Maxwell's estate, who, car- 
rying on extensive plans of improvement upon the lands which he 
held in his own natural possession, had occasion to employ a num- 
ber of additional labourers, and these happening to consist mostly 
of young, stout, newly married Irishmen, this prolific race soon 
contributed largely to the human stock."

1822 ; and it is at present in excellent repair. 

Education — Number of schools in the parish, 5, and no more 
are required. All the native inhabitants of the parish above six 
years of age can read ; but about thirty natives of Ireland residing 
in the parish cannot read. The amount of the parochial school- 
master's salary is L.26 per annum ; and L. 5 are allowed him for 
house and garden. His fees may amount to J. 12 per annum, 
and his other emoluments to L. 2. 

Poor. — The number of persons receiving parochial aid is 40, 
and the average sum allotted to each is about L. 2 per annum'. 
The sum collected for the poor in the church amounts on an ave- 
rage to L. 69, 15s. There is no legal assessment. The amount 
received from alms or legacies may be about L. 15 per annum.

PRESBYTERY OF STRANRAER, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY. 

THE REV. JOHN M'DOWALL, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — It appears that this parish was anciently denominated 
Leuce ; but the northern district having been cut off and formed 
into a separate parish in 1646, was afterwards called New Luce; 
and the southern district Old Luce. In some old Latin docu- 
ments, dated in the year 1 560, it is called Vallis Lucis, the 
valley of light,— a na ue probably assigned it, because the whole 
origin \1 parish was intersected by a deep and wide valley, run- 
ning from the northern to the southern extremity, and in the 
middle of which an abbey or monastery was situated,— Ae light of 
the valley. 

Extent, Boundaries, -c— The parish of Old Luce, lying in the 
centre of Wigtonshire, comprehends about 80 square miles, bemg 
10 miles long, and 8 or 8 broad, and resembling in figure an 
oblong square or parallelogram. It is bounded on the north, by 
New Luce; on the west, by Inch and Stonykirk; on the south, 
by the Bay of Luce ; and on the east, by Kirkowan and Mochrum. 

Topoffraphical Appearances.— The general aspect of the parish 
is very irregular, the surface being for the most part hilly, and 
containing comparatively little level land, except in the vicinity of 
'the Bay of Luce, and on the sides of the river, which runs through 
the valley already referred to. The elevation, however, of the 
highest hills does not exceed 1014 feet above the level of the sea. 
The climate, compared with that of other parishes in Galloway, is 
temperate. 

Bar/— Coast —The Bay of Luce winds round the southern coast 
of Wigtonshire, from the Mull of Galloway to Burrow-head, in 
Whithorn, and comprehends at least 400 square miles. Some 
parts of its coast are sandy, some gravelly, and some clayey. 
Within two miles of Glenluce, it affords a harbour Burn-foot lor 
small vessels importing lime, coals, &amp;c. ; but usually vessels ot 



OLD LUCE. 



67 



more than 60 or 70 tons burden cannot approach that part of the 
coast. 

Hydrography. — The parish contains several small lakes or lochs; 
but they are too unimportant in all respects to require particular 
notice. The springs, which usually issue from rocks and the sides 
of hills, are numerous, unintermittent, extremely cold and trans- 
parent, but have nothing remarkable in their chemical nature. 
The principal rivers are Luce and Pooltanton. The river of Luce 
rises on the borders of Ayrshire, passes southward through New 
Luce and this parish, and discharges itself into the Bay of Luce. 
The length of its course is about 21 miles : the breadth of its 
channel may average 30 feet ; and, unless with high floods, it is 
easily crossed on foot. Pooltanton is a small river rising in Les- 
walt, and running through a part of Lich, Stonykirk, and the 
southern extremity of Old Luce, till it falls into the Bay of Luce, 
nearly at the same place as the former river. 

Soil. — All kinds of soil exist in the parish, but that which pre- 
vails is of a gravelly or sandy nature. The land, in general, is 
light, dry, and stony ; but on the sides of the river of Luce, and 
in the southern parts of the parish, some land of better quality is 
found. The depth of the soil varies from six to twelve inches ; but 
where it consists of moss, clay, or loam, its depth may vary from 
one to three feet. Unless in clayey or loamy land, the second 
stratum or subsoil is usually found to consist of sand or gravel, 
which extends to a considerable depth. 

Geology. — The larger rocks are of common greywacke, with veins 
of quartz; but small rocks of granite also abound in variousparts of the 
parish, and extensive tracts of slate might probably be found. A 
greywacke quarry, of some importance, has been wrought for several 
years in the immediate neighbourhood of Glenluce, where stones 
of great utility for various purposes have been obtained. No lime- 
stone, sandstone, nor mines of any description, have been disco- 
vered. In deep strata of moss, large trunks of trees, chiefly of 
oak, and nuts in an entire state, are often found ; but other fossil 
remains or petrifactions are seldom observed. 

Zoology.— rarer species of animals, birds, or insects are found 
in the parish. Foxes were once numerous, but for some years 
past have almost entirely disappeared. Game of every description 
abounds. 

In the rivers of Luce and Pooltanton, salmon and sea-trout 
were once very abundant, but during the last fifteen or twenty 



68 WIGTONSIllllE. 

years their niunber has considerably decreased. For the three 
last seasons, the river of Luce has bpcn preserved for rod-fishing 
only, with a view to increase the number of salmon, — which will 
probably have that effect. 

In Pooltanton, scarcely any salmon are now caught ; but in the 
earlier part of the season, sea-trout, weighing from one to twelve 
pounds each, are taken with nets. The fishery of greatest import- 
ance is at the mouth or entrance of the river of Luce, where sal- 
mon and sea-trout are caught with set nets, which rise with the 
flowing of the tide, and enclose salmon, &amp;c. when it recedes. The 
whole rental of the fishery on the coast and on these rivers may 
annually amount to L. 70 or L. 80. Shell-fish of various kinds, 
flounders, and cod fish, are also taken within the Bay of Luce. 

Plantations. — A few plantations of no great extent, and consist- 
ing chiefly of oak, ash, pine, and the more common sorts of tim- 
ber, lie on the southern part of the parish. 

IL — Civil History. 

Some brief notices of this parish will be found in Chalmers's 
Caledonia, and Murray's Literary History of Galloway ; but we 
are not aware of the existence of any important historical accounts 
of it, either ancient or modern. 

Proprietors of Land. — The chief land-owners are, the Earl of 
Stair ; Sir James Dalrymple Hay, Bart. ; Robert Cathcart, Esq. 
of Genoch ; John Adair, Esq. Balkail ; James Johnstone, Esq. 
Gillespie ; John Carrick Moore, Esq. of Corsewall ; William 
Gifford, Esq. ; and A. J. Hannay, M. D., Esq. Glasgow. 

Parochial Register. — A session record has been kept in this 
parish since the year 1731, containing [a registration of births, 
marriages, &amp;c. from that time till the present. 

Antiquities — Abbey. — The Abbey of Luce the only antiquity 
of importance stood on the side of the river, and in the middle of 
the valley which intersects the parish from north to south, about 
one mile and a quarter from Glenluce. It was founded in the year 
1190, and was afterwards inhabited by monks of the Cistertian 
order. From the ruins, which cover a whole acre of ground, and 
from some of its walls, which are still standing, it appears to have 
been a very magnificent and extensive building. Nearly a cen- 
tury after other monasteries had been destroyed in Scotland, the 
Abbey of Luce remained almost in an entire state ; for so late as 
1646, it is mentioned in the Records of the Presbytery of Stran- 
raer as having sustained little injury. The Chapter- House, as it

is called, still remains entire, — a small apartment on the eastern 
side of the square, the roof of which is supported by a strong pil- 
lar, diverging at the top into eight arches, and terminating in 
the surrounding walls. The centres of the arches are ornament- 
ed with various figures, curiously cut out in white freestone. Tho- 
mas Hay, the lineal ancestor of Sir James D. Hay, Bart, princi- 
pal resident heritor, was appointed Commendator of this monas- 
tery by the Pope of Rome, in the year 1560. A field adjoining 
the old building, and now forming a part of the present incum- 
bent's glebe, had anciently been a burying-ground, and there the 
Commendator's family the Hays of Park have still their burial- 
place. 

Castles.— -This parish contains also three ancient castles, one of 
which only is entire, viz. the Castle of Park, formerly the resi- 
dence of the family just referred to ; Castle Synniness ; and Carse- 
creuch, once the family residence of the Earl of Stair. 

Eminent Characters. — Several eminent persons have been offi- 
cially connected with the Abbey of Glenluce, of whom the most 
important were the two sons of Alexander Gordon, Bishop of Gal- 
loway, titular Archbishop of Athens, who died in 1576. Lawrence 
Gordon, second son of the bishop, was Abbot of this place for 
several years previously to 1606, the date of his death. In 1602, 
James VI. had erected, in his favour, Glenluce into a tempo- 
ral barony, which at his death was conferred, by royal charter, on 
his elder brother John Gordon, Dean of Salisbury. This latter in- 
dividual was a person of great condition, and an author of no mean 
reputation. For a minute list of his numerous literary publications, 
which are generally of an ecclesiastical or theological nature, see 
Murray's Lit. History of Galloway, 2d edition, p. 42. He died in 
1619, and was succeeded in the barony of Glenluce by his son- 
m-law. Sir Robert Gordon of Gordonston, the celebrated histo- 
rian of the family of Gordon. Glenluce was afterwards annexed 
to the see of Galloway, the revenue of which had, from various 
causes, been much reduced ; and towards the end of the seventeenth 
century, it was again erected into a barony, and became the pro- 
perty of the Noble family of Stair. It may not be uninteresting 
to state the origin of the connection of that celebrated family 
with this parish and with Wigtonshire. James Dalrymple of Stair, 
the Professor of Philosophy in the University of Glasgow, married 
in 1643, Margaret Ross of Balniel, by whom he became pos- 
sessed of Carsecreuch, Balniel, and other lands in this parish 



70 



WIGTONSHEUE. 



This lady had an only sister, married to Sir Thomas Dunbar of 
Mochr urn. James Dalrymple afterwards studied law, passed ad- 
vocate at the Scottish Bar, was appointed one of the Lords of Ses- 
sion, and on the Revolution was elevated to the office of Lord Pre- 
sident. He died in 1695, leaving behind him the highest cha- 
racter as a lawyer or a judge. His various publications are well 
known ; but his " Institutions of the Law of Scotland," has always 
been regarded as by far the best work produced in this country in 
the department to which it belongs. He was raised to the peer- 
age in 1690, and died in 1695. He rebuilt the house of Carse- 
creuch, which was his favourite country residence. His oldest 
son, who succeeded him, held some of the highest offices, and was 
a great promoter of the union between Scotland and England. His 
grandson was the great Marshal Stair. The family seat is now 
at Calhorn, in the neighbouring parish of Inch. 

The Rev. Robert M'Ward, an eminent clergyman and theo- 
logical and controversial writer during the reigns of Charles 1. 
and Charles II., was a native of this parish. He studied at St 
Andrews ; and afterwards acted as amanuensis and private secre- 
tary to the celebrated Samuel Rutherford, while the latter was in 
London as a member of the Westminster Assembly of Divines. 
M'Ward successively held several high offices. He was elected 
Professor of Humanity in St Salvator's College, St Andrews, in 
1650 ; Professor of Philosophy in the University of Glasgow in 
1653 ; and one of the ministers of that city in 1656. On the 
Restoration, he was tried for sedition and treasonable preaching, 
and was sentenced to banishment forth of the kingdom, six months 
beinff allowed him to remove. He retired to Rotterdam. He 
was for some time one of the ministers of the Scottish Church in 
that city ; but, owing to the interference of the English govern- 
ment, was obliged not only to resign that living, but to leave that 
town. He afterwards, however, ventured to return to it. He died 
there in 1681. He was supported while in Holland, before and 
after holding the ministerial office in Rotterdam, by the conjunct 
liberality of his Dutch and Scottish friends. He was the editor 
of Rutherford's Letters, which were first published in Rotterdam 
in 1664. His other works were, " The Poor Man's Cup of Cold 
Water;" " The True Non- Conformist;" " Banders Disbanded;" 
« A Testimony against paying of Cess to the Persecutors;'' 
" Earnest Contendings for the Faith," and other publications, 
all of which were long popular in this country. About seventy of

Character of the People. — There is nothing which respects the 
personal qualities, prevailing customs, or habits of the inhabitants 
of this parish that deserves particular notice. The people gener- 
ally are sober, honest, industrious, and attentive to religious du- 
ties, contented with their situation, and hospitable and friendly. 
Such, at least, is the prevailing character of the native inhabitants ; 
but a continual influx of Irish immigrants, who obtain settlements 
in the parish, may in some degree prove unfavourable to the moral 
and religious character of the gross population.

Number of acres which never have been cultivated, but remain con-

Perhaps some thousands of acres, in the moorland districts, 
which have hitherto remained untilled, might be reclaimed and 
profitably cultivated, if the tenants possessed sufficient capital, or 
had any prospect of being remunerated for the expense incurred. 

Livestock. — In the moorland and pastoral parts of the parish, 
the breeding of black Galloway cattle has long been extensively 
adopted, on account of their superior value. For these cattle a 
higher price has always been obtained than for others of equal 
age and size, their beef being considered of finer quality. A breed 
of white and grey-faced sheep," with fine short wool and horns, has 
been gradually exchanged, within the last twenty years, for a larger 
species black-faced, horned, with long coarse wool, brought from 
Ayrshire and the Highlands. 

Value of Land. — The average value of good arable land is 
probably about L. I, 10s. per acre ; but its value varies in differ- 
ent parts, according to the depth and nature of the soil. 

Acres under Crop. — There are annually about 400 acres of 
wheat under crop; 1350 of oats; 454 of ryegrass; 259 of mea- 
dow hay ; 60 of peas and beans ; 467 of potatoes ; and 160 of 
turnips. 

Dairies. — In the southward part of the parish, dairies have of 
late become very general, and upwards of 6000 stones of cheese 
are annually produced. 

Rabbits. — On the sandy coast of the Bay of Luce rabbits ex- 
ist in great numbers; and about 1500 dozen are killed yearly. 

Wages. — Male servants, capable of performing all kinds of farm- 
work, receive each about L. 9 in cash, 3 bolls and 4 stones of 



OLD LUCE 



73 



oatmeal, and 5 bolls of potatoes per year ; besides being furnished 
with a house, garden, and fuel. Male servants unniarried, living 
in farm-houses, and doing the same work, receive each for the same 
term of service about L. 10 ; common labourers usually receive Is. 
2d. per day in summer, and Is. in winter. Female servants in 
farm-houses receive each about L. 5 per year. 

Improvements. — Twenty years ago, the whole arable land in 
the parish of Old Luce was comparatively in an uncultivated 
state. Scarcely any wheat, barley, beans, peas, or turnips were pro- 
duced, even in the cultivated districts, and not more than one- 
fifth of the annual quantity of potatoes which is now raised. The 
high price of cattle and sheep, previous to that period, retarded 
the progress of cultivation, and turned the attention of the farmers 
chiefly to pasturage. Only a small proportion of the land actu- 
ally devoted to tillage received any manure, and little attention was 
paid to the reclaiming of waste land, or improving the general soil. 
Since that time, however, a different system of husbandry has been 
introduced and extensively prosecuted, which has greatly increas- 
ed the amount of raw produce, and changed the whole aspect of 
the southern parts of the parish. The continued low price of cat- 
tle for several years past has led, in all the more cultivated dis- 
tricts, to a change of stock, and an improved system of agriculture 
The increase of dairies, and the scheme of management connect- 
ed with them, have tended much to improve the general state of 
the land, inasmuch as a greater quantity of manure is thereby 
procured, and a greater proportion of the soil annually enriched. 
In particular, the system of green- cropping, upon a more extensive 
scale, recently introduced by an eminent practical farmer Mr Gib- 
son, factor to Sir James D. Hay, and now generally adopted, has 
greatly increased both the natural value of the land, and the quan- 
tity of farm produce. This system, besides having increased the 
average extent of crop on all farms where it is pursued, has na- 
turally turned the attention of the farmers to all practicable means 
of improving their lands; and by draining, levelling, removing 
stones, and applying proper manure, they have effected of late an 
extensive improvement. Some parts ofhe land which were for- 
merly waste and useless, have, under this system of management, 
been rendered the most productive and valuable ; and the gene- 
ral aspect of the parish presents in consequence a very melior- 
ated appearance. It is presumed that the mode of husbandry 



74 



WIGTONSHIRE. 



prosecuted in the parts of this parish best suited for tillage, is not 
inferior to that of any other parish in Scotland. 

On these parts which are less suitable for tillage, and solely re- 
served for pasturage, about 100 scores of sheep, and a correspond- 
ing number of black Galloway cattle, are kept as stock. 

The general duration of leases is nineteen years. 

Farm -Buildings, Sfc. — The dwelling-houses and office-houses of 
the tenantry are in general good, commodious, and advantageous- 
ly situated, and form a pleasing contrast with what they were but 
a few years ago. .Enclosures also are generally sufficient, and in 
good state of repair. 

Mamifachires. — No extensive manufactures have yet been es- 
tablished in this parish. There are, however, two corn-mills, two 
carding-miils ; one dye-mill, and one flax-mill ; but in none of 
these establishments are many hands employed, nor is any great 
amount of work executed. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Markets. — A catlle-market is held near Glenluce, on the first 
Friday of every month from April to December. 

Villages. — The only village in this parish is Glenluce, which 
lies on the side of a little glen or valley, about one mile and a 
half from the most inland point of the Bay of Luce, and on the 
public road leading from Newton- Stewart to Stranraer. A re- 
gular post-office has long been established in this village, and the 
mail-coach, running between Dumfries and Portpatrick, passes 
through it daily. 

Means of Communication, c. — There is but one turnpike road 
in the parish, which measures about ten miles. The only bridge 
of importance is that over the river of Luce, about one quarter 
of a mile west from the village, which at present is in course of 
being enlarged by an adjunct of 22 feet in breadth. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated on the 
north-west side of the village, and in its immediate neighbourhood. 
Its distance from the remotest extremity of the parish is about 
seven miles ; but it could not be more conveniently situated for the 
great body of the population. It was built in 1814, and is in 
good state of repair. It affords accommodation for 800 persons. 

The manse stands beside the old Abbey. It was built about 
sixty-five years ago, and was thoroughly repaired in 1830. The 
glebe contains 16 acres, and averages in value L. 2, 10s. per acre. 
The stipend of the present incumbent is the minimum. 



OLD LUCE. 



75 



There is one Dissenting chapel in this parish connected with the 
United Secession Church. The stipend of the minister is L. 80, 
raised chiefly from seat-rents and sabbatical contributions. The 
number of actual members is about 80 ; the average attendance 
about 150. 

Public worship in the Established Church is remarkably well at- 
tended. The average number of communicants amounts to up- 
wards of 600. The number of families attending the Establish- 
ed'Church is 321 ; of Roman Catholic famihes, 19 ; of Dissenting 
or Seceding families, 25, whereof 9 are Cameronians, who attend 
Divine service, someJn Stranraer, and others in Newtonstewart. 

Education. — There are five schools at present in this parish, 
four of which are supported chiefly by the fees. The parish school- 
master receives the minimum salary, with the legal accommoda- 
tions. His fees may amount to L. 40 a year : and he has about 
L. 4 a year from other sources. The branches of education taught 
in the parish school, and the rates of these branches per quarter, 
are as follows : English reading and grammar, 3s. ; Latin, 4s. ; 
arithmetic, 4s. ; practical mathematics, 4s. ; geography and history, 
,4s. ; writing and book-keeping, 4s. The more common branches 
of education only are taught in the other four schools ; and the 
average attendance at each may be about 30. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — About 30 persons annually re- 
ceive parochial aid ; but the sum allotted per week varies accord- 
ing to the peculiar circumstances of the different persons receiving 
relief. The amount of contributions for the poor is about L. 80 
annually. No assessment for the rehef of uch persons has at any 
time taken place in this parish. The late Earl of Stair mortified 
L. 270 in behalf of the poor in this parish. A strong aversion 
from seeking parochial aid exists among the native inhabitants of 
the parish. 

Fairs. — One fair is held in the month of May, in the village of 
Glenluce, for the purpose of engaging servants to work during the 
seasons of hay-making and harvest ; but for several years it has 
been attended by few, and all business of importance is transacted 
on Fridays at the neighbouring market-town of Stranraer. 

Inns and Ale-houses. — There are 3 inns and 6 or 7 ale-houses in 
this parish ; but nothing remarkable is observed as to their effects 
on the moral character of the people. 

Fuel.—T\ie fuel generally used in this parish is peat, obtained 
from extensive tracts of moss.

PRESBYTERY OF STRANRAER, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY. 

THE REV. WILLIAM M'KERGO, MINISTER. 



L — Topography and Natural JIistory. 

Extent, §-c. — The parish of New Luce is situated in a moor- 
land district of Wigtonshire, extending about 10 miles in length, 
from north to south ; and 6 miles in breadth, from east to west. It 
is bounded on the south by the parish of Old Glenluce, from 
which it was taken, and erected into a separate parish in the year 
1628. It is bounded on the east by the parish of Kirkowan, 
from which it is separated by -the Water of Tarf ; on the north, 
by the parishes of Colmonell and Ballantrae ; and on the west, 
by the parish of Inch, from which it is divided by the main 
water of Luce, which rises among the hills in Ballantrae, and runs 
south until it falls into the sea in Glenluce Bay. The Cross-water 
of Luce rises among the said hills, runs in a south -east direction until 
it reaches the middle of the parish, where it turns to the west, and 
runs into the main water at right angles, where the parish church 
and village are situated, at the distance ©f five miles from the vil- 
lasre of Glenluce, and nine miles from the town of Stranraer. 

The salmon-fishing in the main water belongs to Sir James 
Dalrymple Hay, of Park Place, Bart. ; that in the Cross-water has 
hitherto been reckoned free. 

Geology. — The rocks of this pari«h belong to the stratified series 
of the transition class. 

11. — Civil History. 

Parochial Registers. — The oldest parish register is dated 1695. 
Until about twenty-five years ago they were not regularly kept. 

Land-owners. — The heritors are four in number, none of whom 
reside within this parish. They are named below, as proprietors 
of the different farms. 

There are no mansion-houses of any consequence in the parish. 

Eminent Characters. — The only eminent character connected 
with this parish is the celebrated Alexander Peden, " the pro- 



NEW LUCE. 



77 



phet," as he is still commonly designated, wlio was minister of 
New Luce for three years previously to 1662, when he was eject- 
ed from his office, Charles II. having, in the preceding year, re- 
stored Episcopacy as the national religion. Peden, on retiring 
from the parish, skulked about from place to place, instructing 
and encouraging the people. He was at length apprehended and 
confined a close prisoner to the Bass. He afterwards received 
sentence of banishment to Virginia, but the captain of the ves- 
sel which was meant to carry him and others to their place of 
transportation, having refused to convey them, he was liberated. 
But his sufferings were not yet over. He was again obliged to 
conceal himself. He found a retreat sometimes in Ireland, some- 
times in Scotland, till at length in 1686, death put an end to his 
sufferings in the sixtieth year of his age. " Peden's Prophecies," 
a pamphlet published after his death, and which even yet has be- 
lievers in its statements, " were palmed," says Wodrow, " on this 
great man. By all the rules of charity, I reckon myself obliged 
to take these prophecies to have been most injuriously fathered 
on Mr Peden." His name, we may state, is still held in high ve- 
neration among the common people.

Agriculture.— Thk parish contains thirty-two farms; three of 
these belong to Sir James D. Hay; two to Thomas M'Mick- 
ing, Esq. of Miltonise ; one to Captain Macdowall of Logan ; 
and all the rest to the Earl of Stair. The above farms have been 
considerably improved, within these last thirty years, by new houses, 
march-dikes, and fences dividing the meadow and arable land 
from the moor pasture ; and likewise by new roads from this vil- 
lage to Glenluce and Stranraer, and towards the toll-bar at the 
head of Glenap, in Ballantrae, and towards Barhill, in Colmonell. 

There are not above ten acres of land planted in this parish, 
although trees thrive well ; and there are some hundreds of acres 
upon the banks of rivers well adapted for planting, and fit for little 
else, which would beautify the country, afibrd shelter, and turn to 
good account in point of gain. 



78 



WIGTONSHIRE. 



The writer regrets he cannot ascertain exactly the proportions 
of arable and waste land in the parish. 

There is about as much grain raised in this parish as is suffi- 
cient for its inhabitants ; and the principal produce of the soil is 
sheep and black-cattle. 

Rent. — The present rental of the parish is L. 3200 Sterling per 
annum. 

There are three shops and three public-houses, all situated in 
the village of New Luce, which contains about 180 inhabitants, 
some of whom are labourers, and some tradesmen, employed by 
the country people in the neighbourhood. 

There are no manufactories in this quarter. 

The road money is upwards of L. 30 yearly. Several roads 
have been made since the last Account, and a considerable quanti- 
ty of land has been fenced by stone dikes and manured with lime. 

Farm- Houses, Leases, c. — Suitable houses have been built 
upon most of the farms during these last twenty-five years. Leases 
are generally granted for the space of nineteen years ; and although 
the present low price of wool and of all other farm produce is se- 
verely felt, yet the farmers are, upon the whole, comfortably situ- 
ated. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

The nearest post-office is Glenluce, which is five miles distant, 
and the nearest market-town is Stranraer, above nine miles distant. 

Means of Communication. — There is a new line of road from 
Glenluce to the toll-bar of Curloch in Ballantrae parish, which 
passes through the village of New Luce ; and also a line of road 
from the said village, which passes through the farm of Miltonise 
to the village of Barhill, in Colmonell parish. There is a bridge 
upon the Cross water of Luce, about four miles from this village. 
Both these hnes of road will be of great use in opening up this 
dull country. 

Ecclesiastical State.— There is plenty of church accommodation 
here, the church being seated for 400 people ; and, by putting up 
galleries, it could be easily made to contain 200 more As the in- 
habitants of six or eight farms in the parish of Inch are more 
than six miles from their own church, and near to New Luce, they 
generally attend sermon in the latter place. The church was 
built about eighteen years ago. 

The stipend is L. 150 Sterling per annum, with L. 8, 6s. 8d. 
for communion elements,— of which sum the heritors pay L. 69, 



'EW LUCE. 



79 



I7s. 6d., and the remaining L. 88, 9s. 2d. is paid by the Ex- 
chequer. The manse was built about thirty-six years ago. 

The number of communicants is about 200. The people at- 
tend sermon as well as can be expected from the bad roads, and 
the distance at which several of them are placed. There is no 
chapel or meeting-house in. this parish. 

There are four families of Dissenters, and three families of 
Roman Catholics in the parish. All the rest belong to the Esta- 
blished Church. 

Education. — A sufficient school-house and schoolmaster's house 
were erected in this parish lately; but more than one-half of 
the farmers' children receive no benefit from the parochial school 
the only school in the parish on account of their distance, and 
they are generally taught by young lads, who are hired to live in 
their families through the winter season. There is a Sabbath 
school taught in this village by the parochial schoolmaster, except 
during four months in the depth of winter. The education of the 
young is generally attended to ; and there are no grown-up per- 
sons in this parish who cannot read. 

The salary of the parochial schoolmaster is L. 25, 13s. 4d. a year. 
His fees may amount to L. 5 per annum. He has also the interest 
of a mortified sum of L. 50 for the education of poor children, 
and L. 2 for acting as precentor, session-clerk, &amp;c. 

Poor. — There are no assessments in this parish. The poor are 
supported by collections in the church, which amount to about 
L. 15 a-year ; and the interest of L. 300 left as a donation by 
the late Earl of Stair, principal heritor of the parish. The ave- 
rage number of persons receiving parochial aid is 16. 

Ficel. — The fuel used is moss or turf, and easily procured. 
Inns. — There are three inns in the village.

PRESBYTERY OF STRANRAER, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY. 

THE REV. JAMES FERGUSSON, A. M. MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The name of the parish is evidently Celtic. Ms, 
Ynis or Inch signifies island. In the Loch of Castle- Kennedy, op- 
posite the present church, is an island supposed to have been the 
site of a religious house prior to the Reformation. This island 
was called the Inch, and hence the name of the parish. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish is about ten miles long, 
and in some places nearly the same in breadth. It is bounded on 
the north by the parish of Ballantrae ; on the east by the parishes 
of New Luce and Glenluce ; on the south by the parishes of 
Stonykirk and Portpatrick ; and on the west by the parishes of 
Leswalt and Stranraer, and the Bay of Lochryan. 

Topographical Appearances. The north part of the parish con- 
sists of high lands partly arable, but chiefly covered with heath, 
rugged and not susceptible of culture. The highest elevation is 
812 feet above the level of the sea. The south part of the parish 
is low ; and, when viewed from the hills, has the appearance of a 
plain ; but it is gently undulating in its surface. This part of the 
parish lies in an isthmus between the bays of Lochryan and Luce. 
The soil is in general light, resting on a bed of sand or gravel. 
There are some curious hollows here, called by the country peo- 
ple pots, perhaps formed by the retiring sea, which is supposed to 
have overflowed at one period the whole isthmus. One of 
these, situated on the farm of Aird, near the church, is of an oval 
form, and is about 1000 feet in circumference, and about 100 in 
depth. 

Coast. — There is an extent of shore of about eight miles along 
Lochryan. The shore is flat, sandy or gravelly, except where it 
joins the parish of Ballantrae ; it there acquires a rocky and pre- 
xipitous character. 



INCH. 



81 



Ba7/s. — Lochryan is situated at what may be considered the 
Biitrance of the Frith of Clyde, being about 60 miles south-west 
of Greenock, 40 miles south south-east of Campbelton, 52 south- 
east of the north channel opening into the western ocean, and 40 
miles north-east of the entrance of Belfast Loch. At its entrance 
it is about three miles across from east to west, with from four to 
five fathoms water, which gradually deepens to seven or eight as 
you proceed up. The loch lies north and south, and is between 
eight and nine miles long from the entrance to the town of Stran- 
raer, situated at the head of it. Its breadth varies from two to five 
miles. 

Meteorology. — The accompanying table will give the monthly 
temperature during the year 1837, also the pressure of the at- 
mosphere, as ascertained by the barometer, and the quantity of 
rain fallen, as ascertained by the rain-guage, &amp;c. The observations 
have been made and kept with great regularity and accuracy by 
Mr Burnet, gardener to the Earl of Stair at Castle- Kennedy.

Prevailing Winds. — The prevailing winds are south and west. 
In November and December 1833, we had gales of great and un- 
usual violence. The plantations suffered severely. The storm 
was preceded by a great depression of the barometer. A dreadful 
storm took place on the morning of the 7th January 1 839, un- 
roofing houses, and levelling with the ground the largest trees. 

Prognostics. — I have often observed the correctness of the prog- 
nostics of the weather described by Virgil. There is to be storm, 

" Cum medio celeres revolant ex asquore roergi 
Clamoremque ferunt ad litora ; cumque marina2 
In sicco ludunt fulicas ; notasque paludcs 
Descrit, atquc altam supra volat ardca nubem." 
WIGTON. F

WlGTONSHlllE. 



When there is to be rain, 

" c pastu decedens agmine inagno 
Corvorum incicpuit dcnsis cxercitus alis," 

and various sea birds may be seen, 

" Certatim largos humeris iufundere rores." 

Climate. — The climate of the parish is variable. The inha- 
bitants, however, enjoy much health, and live to a good old age. 
Rheumatic distempers prevail, occasioned, probably, by the change- 
fulness of the climate. 

The accompanying table will show the commencement of seed- 
time and harvest in the highland district of the parish, for a series of 
years. It is extracted from the journal of an intelligent farmer.

rograpliy - 


—There are several 


chalybeate springs in the pa- 



rish, some also slightly sulphuretted. I am not aware that any of 
these have been analyzed. 

There are no less than twelve fresh water lochs in the parish. 
The lochs of Castle- Kennedy and Soulseat are remarkable for their 
beauty, and are well worthy of a visit from the lover of lake scenery. 
The loch of Soulseat was called in former times the Green Lake, 
and an outlet is still called the Green Ford. At certain seasons . 
the loch is overspread with a green seed-like substance, but 
whether of a vegetable or animal nature, I have not ascertained. 

There are no rivers of any magnitude in the parish. The Luce, 
a stream which rises in Carrick, and flowing with much rapidity 
over a rocky bed, discharges itself into the Bay of Luce, is the 
boundary line between this parish and New Luce. The Piltantonj

a smaller and more sluggish stream, which discharges itself into the 
same bay, divides this parish from Stonykirk. 

Geology. — There is not much interesting in the geology of the 
parish. The hills are chiefly composed of stratified transition 
rocks, as greywacke, &amp;c. There is an excellent slate-quarry on 
the lands of Lochryan. Granite is never found except in detach- 
ed blocks. Tradition speaks of lead mines having been wrought. 
Probably an attempt was made to find lead ore, but without any suc- 
cess. Attempts have been repeatedly made to discover coal, but 
they have all hitherto failed. There are extensive tracts of peat 
moss, which supply abundant fuel. There is great diversity of 
soil, gravelly, sandy, clayey, loamy, and mossy. Throughout the 
lower part of the parish, the soil is in general light and sandy. 

Zoology. — The parish abounds in different sorts of game ; part- 
ridge, grouse, snipe, woodcock, hares, &amp;c. I have heard it al- 
leged that the ptarmigan once existed in the district. The bit- 
tern is sometimes, but not very often, found. Curlews and plo- 
vers abound. Troops of wild geese may be seen pasturing by the 
brooks on the highlands, or, when severe weather is setting in, wing- 
ing their way to the sea shore. A great variety of water-fowl 
frequent the lakes — ducks, coots, widgeon, teal, cormorant, &amp;c. 
In winter, we are frequently visited by swans. Sea-mews visit us 
in spring, to bring forth their young by the sedgy shores of our 
lochs. There are two rookeries in the parish, — one at Castle-Ken- 
nedy, the seat of the Earl of Stair, and one at Lochryan House, 
the seat of Sir Alexander Wallace. There is also a heronry at 
Castle- Kennedy.] Birds of prey, such as hawks, kites, owls, ravens, 
&amp;c. are not so numerous as they once were. Of beasts of prey, we 
have the polecat and weasel. Foxes, wild-cats, badgers, and otters 
once abounded, but have now disappeared. Serpents, lizards, &amp;c. 
are not uncommon. 

The lochs abound in pike, perch, trout, roach, and eel. Pike 
have been caught twenty- four pounds in weight. There are salmon 
in the River Luce, and in the estuaries of Lochryan. There are cod, 
haddock, whiting, herring, flounder, &amp;c. in Lochryan. Excellent 
oysters, too, abound in Lochryan. The fishery belongs to Sir 
Alexander Wallace of Lochryan, by a charter from the Crown. 

On a calm summer evening, the banks of the Loch of Soulseat 
present an appearance not a little curious. What seem to be 
pillars of cloud, appear here and there, rising to a height of fifty 
feet or more. A stranger viewing them at a distance might sup-

pose them to consist of vapour or smoke ; but on a nearer approach, 
they are found to consist of Hving creatures, engaged in ceaseless 
action, performing the most graceful evolutions ; and, on listening, 
will be heard the rush of their little wings and the piping of their 
tiny voices. These flies have, I believe, their nativity in the water, 
from which they emerge to an ephemeral existence in the region of 
air. Onespecies of them go through a very singularprocess — throw- 
ing off the skin. They fix themselves to a tree or bush, or any resting- 
place, and literally crawl out of their skin, and, having left behind 
them their exuviae, hie themselves off with freshened agility to 
their aerial dance. On remaining for a short time by the water 
edge, I have found myself covered with the filmy skins of these 
gay ephemerae. 

Botany. — The parish is not remarkable for the production of 
any rare plants. 

The plantations consist of beech, ash, elm, oak, plane, birch, 
alder, Scotch, larch, and spruce firs. The beech, ash, and plane 
thrive best. There are some large and beautiful ash trees at 
Castle- Kennedy. The larch only thrives in sheltered situations. 

11. — Civil History. 

Ancient Accounts of the Parish. — In 1 684, Mr Andrew Symson, 
minister of Kirkinner, drew up what he calls " a large Description 
of Galloway." In that work there is an account of each parish in 
Wigtonshire. In it will be found some notices regarding the geo- 
graphical position, antiquities, and remarkable objects of the parish 
of Inch. Mr Symson's " Description" remained in MS. in the Ad- 
vocates' Library, till 1823, when it was printed for the first time. 

The parish of Inch comprehended at one time the modern pa- 
rish of Portpatrick, and part of the parish of Stranraer. In 1628, 
Portpatrick, which had been popularly called the black quarter of 
Inch, was erected into a distinct parish. About the sarne time, 
or soon after, a part of Inch was detached to form, with a part of 
Leswalt, the new parish of Stranraer. To compensate for these 
disjunctions, the whole of the old parish of Soulseat was annexed 
to Inch. The manse and glebe remain at Soulseat ; the parish 
church is at Inch. 

Eminent Men. — The celebrated Marshal Stair was connected 
with this parish by property and residence. His military talents 
and achievements, and the part he took in the political proceedings 
of his day, are matters of history. When out of place this dis- 
tinguished nobleman resided much in the country, and delighted 



INCH. 



85 



in agricultural pursuits. To him the parish was indebted for the 
introduction of some improvements in husbandry. He was fond 
of draining bogs and lochs. Several of his works in this way are 
still to be seen. 

General Sir Alexander J. Wallace, a distinguished mihtary 
officer, resides in the parish. He has seen much service in In- 
dia, Egypt, the Peninsula, &amp;c. He obtained the commenda- 
tion of his Sovereign for his gallant conduct in the actions of 
Busaco, Fuentes d'Onor, and Salamanca. Having executed a 
gallant charge with his regiment, the 88th, or Connaught Rangers, 
in the Battle of Busaco, Lord Wellington, who had been a near 
spectator, bestowed the warmest encomiums. Riding up, he 
took Lieut.- Col. Wallace by the hand,"and said, " Wallace, I 
never saw a more gallant charge than that just now made by your 
regiment." When any difficult or dangerous service was to be 
executed, the post of honour was frequently assigned to Lieut.- 
Col. Wallace and the brave 88th. 

Sir John Ross, the intrepid Arctic Navigator, is a native of the 
parish. He is the youngest son of the Rev. Andrew Ross, former- 
ly minister of Inch. He was born at Soulseat 24th June 1777. 
He has a residence in the parish, North- West Castle. General 
Andrew Ross is another distinguished member of the same family. 
His promising career was closed by an early death. 

Land-owners. — The land-owners of the parish are, the Earl of 
Stair ; General Sir Alexander J. Wallace, Bart, of Lochryan ; 
Colonel Vans Agnew of Sheuchan; Patrick Maitland, Esq.; Sir 
James Dalrymple Hay, Bart. ; Colonel Blair ; W. Craig, Esq. ; Sir 
Adolphus Dalrymple, at present M. P. for Brighton. The only 
resident proprietor is General Sir Alexander J. Wallace. 

Antiquities. — At Glenterra, in this parish, at a little distance 
from the road leading to New Luce, there are four large unpolish- 
ed stones placed erect, and forming a circle. At the distance of 
some yards from the circle stands a single stone. They are cal- 
led by the country people " the Standing Stones of Glentarra." 
This may be a small specimen of the Druidical Temple. 

What are called " the Stepping- Stones of Glenterra" are not 
a little curious. About three feet deep, in a peat moss, there is 
a regular file of stepping-stones, extending about a quarter of 
a mile. These must have been placed to form a passage through 
a swamp previous to the growth of the peat moss. 

Stone axes have been found in the parish. These were proba- 



86 



WIGTONSIIIRE. 



bly the rude military implements of the ancient Nuvantes — tlie pri- 
mitive inhabitants of Galloway. 

Sepulchral stone cairns abound in the parish. They are com- 
monly called " the Auld Grey Cairns." Some of them are in a 
situation where the stones must have been brought from a consi- 
derable distance, there being no stones in the neighbourhood. 
They consist of a circular heap of stones, from 50 to 70 feet in 
diameter, and from 6 to 8 feet high in the centre. In the interior 
there is a cavity formed with large flat stones, 4, 5, or 6 feet in 
length, and 2 or 3 feet in breadth. In this cavity, is generally 
found an urn, with fragments of bone, burned wood, and ashes ; 
but sometimes the fragments of bone, burned wood, and ashes, oc- 
cur without an urn. At Cairnyaran, a moorland farm in this pa- 
rish, there are nine of these cairns within the extent of a Scots 
mile. 

These cairns occur in the high part of the parish. In the 
lower district, burrows or tumuli of earth occur, having the same 
sort of cavity, and generally containing an urn ith fragments of 
bone, burned wood, and ashes. Whether the age, or the locality, 
or whether the rank of the individual interred, made the difference 
between the stone cairn and the earthen tumulus, I cannot say. 
Both are no doubt the monuments of the ancient Novantes. 

At Innermessan, a farm in this parish, is a large circular mound 
called the Moat. Its circumference at the base is 336 feet, and 
from the foundation to the top is 78 feet. It -appears to have been 
surrounded by a fosse. Such erections may have served various 
purposes. The name Moat, a Saxon word, would seem to indicate 
that it was a place of judicial assembly. The Fosse would lead 
us to believe that it had been used as a fortlet or place of defence. 
But whatever other purposes it may have served, I have no doubt 
that it was used as a place for burning the dead, or depositing the 
ashes of the dead. On the 24th November 1834, I caused a 
hole, three feet deep, to be dug in the centre of the plain on the 
top. After passing through a fine rich mould, we came to a 
stratum consisting of ashes, charred wood, and fragments of bone. 
In the days of the ancient Novantes this was probaby the public 
cemetery of the adjacent town Rerigonium. May not this mound 
have been used also for such religious observances as " the kindling 
of lights on hills," the Beltan or Baltien, which, according to Ja- 
mieson's Scottish Dictionary, signifies Bel's Fire. 

This Innermessan was the site of the ancient Rerigoimim, a 



INCH. 



87 



town of the Novantes. It was situated on the Rerigonius sinus, 
the modern Lochryan. In subsequent times there was the town 
and Castle of Innermessan. The castle belonged to Sir Andrew 
Aonew of Lochnaw. The town of Innermessan seems to have 
been the most considerable place in the Rhins of Galloway, as 
Symson, in his " Description of Galloway," says, " the greatest 
town thereabouts till Stranraer was built." Every vestige of the 
town and castle is now obliterated, unless it be a sewer, about three 
feet under ground, which may still be seen. Innermessan is pro- 
perly Liver Messan, signifying the influx of the Messan. 

Close by the present manse may be traced some of the founda- 
tions of the Abbey of Soulseat or Saulseat. It was founded by 
Fergus, Lord of Galloway, in the twelfth century, for Premonstra- 
tensian monks. It was called in Latin, sedes Animarum and Monas- 
terium viridis stagni. This latter name it acquired from being si- 
tuated on a peninsula formed by a fresh water loch, the waters of 
which at certain seasons have a green hue. Chalmers, in his 
Caledonia, says, " it was the mother of the more celebrated and 
opulent Priory of Whithorn, as well as the Abbey of Holywood, 
both of which were planted by monks of the same order. It ap- 
pears to have been the original establishment of the Premonstra- 
tensian monks in Scotland ; and the abbots of Soulseat were the 
superiors of that order in this kingdom." Not much is known of 
the history of this -abbey. It is mentioned in an act of Parlia- 
ment 1487, against purchasing livings at Rome, as one of the 
Scottish abbeys, " that were not of old at the Court of Rome," 
i. e. the Pope had no right to dispose of it, the King having the 
appointment. In 1532, David, Abbot of Soulseat, obtained a 
precept from the King, commanding obedience to him, in visiting 
and reforming all the houses in Scotland of the Premonstratensian 
order. In 1568, the Abbot of Soulseat, along with others, sub- 
scribed a bond, obliging themselves to defend the Queen. These 
are all the notices I have been able to collect regarding the his- 
tory of this abbey. It was in ruins in 1684, when Symson wrote 
his Description of Galloway. Only a few of the remains are now 
visible. An extensive burying-ground seems to have surrounded 
the abbey. Human bones and pieces of coffins have been often 
dug up. Part of the burying-ground still remains, and is occa- 
sionally used as a place of interment. There are, however, no 
very ancient inscriptions. The oldest inscription is the following; 
— " Here lies ane honest man, Gilbert Mure, Marchand, burgess 



88 



WIGTONSHIRE. 



of Wigtown, quha departed this lyf, 16 September 1616, spouse 
to Agnes Cunningham." 

A deep fosse or trench, drawn from the two wings of the loch, 
seems to have shut in the peninsula of Soulseat. Symson makes 
mention of this trench, and traces of it may still be seen. Sym- 
son also speaks of a wonderful stone here. " At this manse," 
he says, " is a stone, pretty large, which I have seen, to the par- 
ticles whereof broken off the country people attribute great virtue 
for curing the gravel ; and tell a long story concerning the pro- 
gress of that stone, and how it came there, concerning which, if 
you think fit, you may inquire at Mr James Hutchinson, minister 
of North Leithj who was a considerable space minister of this 
parish." 

In that part of the parish of Inch which was detached to form 
the parish of Stranraer, stood St John's Chapel. A piece of land 
which belonged to the chapel was called St John's Croft. Ad- 
joining was the Castle of the Chapel, which Symson calls " a 
good house, pertaining to Sir John Dalrymple, younger of Stair." 
This castle now forms the jail of Stranraer. 

Castle- Kennedy is the most notable place in this parish. The 
castle has been a large and stately edifice. It was probably built in 
the reign of James VI. It was the seat of the Earls of Cassilis, 
who once possessed large estates in Wigtonshire. The great 
power of this family in this part of the country occasioned the fol- 
lowing rhyme : 

" 'Twixt Wigton and the town of Ayr, 
Portpatrick, and the Cruives of Cree, 
No man needs think for to bide there. 
Unless he court with Kennedie." 

In the reign of Charles II., Castle- Kennedy, with the adjacent 
lands, passed to Sir John Dalrymple, younger of Stair, and to that 
family it has since belonged. The castle was accidentally burned 
in 1715," and has never since been habitable. The walls, which 
are still standing, are 70 feet high. The castle is beautifully si- 
tuated between two fresh water lochs. The grounds and planta- 
tions were laid off by Marshal Stair, and are said to be a kind of 
military picture, in which that distinguished soldier " fought his 
battles o'er again." 

On the island near the church, the Earl of Cassilis had a small 
house, where he was wont, as Symson says, " to retire himself be- 
twixt sermons, having a boat for that purpose." 

The remains of a castle may still be seen at Larg, a fiu-m in this 



INCH. 89 

pai'lsh, near the River Luce. It was the property and residence of 

the Lyns of Larg. 

The Castle of Craig-caffie is still entire. It is not a large 
building, and has been converted into a farm-house. It has been 
surrounded by a fosse, but could never have been a place of much 
strength. It was the residence and property of the Nelsons of 
Craig-caffie, a family now extinct. 

Ill Population. 

The population by the return to Dr Webster was . n 

In the Old Statistical Account, . . •

By census 1831,— males, 1164— females.nSST, . • 2521 

The population is still on the increase. By a census taken by 
myself, it now amounts to 2684. The increase chiefly arises from 
the town of Stanraer extending its suburbs within the bounds of 
this parish. About 600 reside in villages, the rest in the country. 

The yearly average of births, as far as inserted in the parish register, is 52 

The average of marriages for the same time, ... 19 
No register of deaths has been kept in the parish.

Amusements. — In the winter season, curling and skating are very 
common amusements. During hard frost, some of our lochs pre- 
sent a very gay and animating appearance. The skater performs 
his evolutiojis, — the stone thunders along the ice amid the cheers 
of the spectators, — the graceful forms of the fair move up and 
down on the slippery promenade, giving additional interest to the 
scene. Curling levels all distinctions, — the laird and the labourer, 
the master and the servant, the clergyman and the clown, are all 
on an equality at this game. The late mild winters have render- 
ed less frequent the enjoyment of these amusements. 

Character of the People. — The tenantry of Inch enjoy, in a 
considerable degree, the comforts and advantages of society. 
They are, in general, well-informed, moral and religious. Some 
of them are well versed in historic lore. I recollect of one man, 



 



WIGTON SHIRE. 

long an elder in this parish, who for a minute acquaintance with 
all matters of history, surpassed any man I ever knew. A large por-- 
tion of the working-classes are Irish. They are by no means 
cleanly in their habits and style of living. Their habitations are 
too frequently scenes of filth. The pig often shares the same do- 
micile with his owner; The Scotch part of the labouring popu- 
lation are much more cleanly in their habits,— superior also in 
character and intelligence. The ordinary food of the peasantry 
consists chiefly of oatmeal porridge, and bread, milk, cheese, po- 
tatoes, poi-k, and herring. Tea and tobacco are in too general 
use. It would be better that what is expended on these luxuries 
would go to improve the comforts of the people in other respects. 
I have often wished that the labourer could enjoy the wholesome' 
and invigorating beverage of home-brewed ale. Poaching pre- 
vails much in the parish, but the poachers generally come from 
other parishes. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture.— T\iQ land cultivated, or occasionally in tillage, 
may amount to 12,600 acres ; the land never cultivated, constant- 
ly waste or in pasture, 18,000 acres. About 800 acres of the 
highland district of the parish might be added to the cultivated 
land ; the climate, however, would have to be ameliorated by belts 
of plantation. There is no land in the parish in a state of un- 
divided common. About 655 acres are under wood, all planted 
and enclosed. There is some natural wood in the glens in the 
higher district, but not of much extent or value. The oldest 
plantations were made about a century ago by Marshal Stair, and 
consist chiefly of beech. At that time, and till lately, beech was 
considered the only tree that would suit the soil and climate of 
Wigtonshire. This is now found to be a mistake. Beech also is 
very unprofitable timber. Ash, oak, elm, plane, and larch are now 
generally planted. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of arable land in the parish 
is L. 1 per acre. The average rent of grazing is about L. 3, 15s. 
for each cow, and 3s. 6d. for each sheep per annum. 

Wages. — The wages of a common labourer in summer, Is. 2d.; 
in winter. Is. The wages of a joiner in summer and winter, 2s.; 
of a mason, do. 2s. 6d. 

Sheep. — The common breed of sheep in the parish is ihehlack- 
faced. The sheep-walks not being very good, the stock are ge- 
nerally small, and the breed not much studied. The diseases 



INCH. 



91 



which prevail among sheep in this district are the braxy, a kind of 
flatulent distemper, which speedily proves fatal ; the sturdi/, or 
water in the head, and grupping, a kind of palsy. The latter is 
sometimes cured by putting the sheep into a clover or turnip- 
field. Sheep are dipped in the month of June, and smeared in 
November. 

Live-stock.— breed of cattle long common in this district is 
the well known Galhioay breed. They feed well, and are preferred 
in the English market to any other cattle of the same weight. 
Much attention has been paid by our farmers to the improvement 
of this kind of stock. Of late years, however, the purity of the 
breed has been much contaminated by the introduction of Irish 
cattle. In consequence of the low price of Galloways in the Eng- 
lish market, many of our farmers have introduced the Ayrshire 
cow, and turned their attention to cheese-making. 

Turnips were introduced into the parish more than a century 
ago by Marshal Stair, but their cultivation did not become general 
till lately. Turnip cultivation, and feeding off with sheep, are ex- 
tremely suitable to our light soils, and are now generally adopted. 
There is a bone-mill in the parish, and bone manure is in great 
demand. 

Reclaiming Waste Land, Sc. — There are several considerable 
bogs or mosses in the lower district of the parish, which might 
be reclaimed and improved ; but as the price of coal is high, 
being all imported these are required for a supply of fuel. 
George Guthrie, Esq. factor to the Earl of Stair, the most spirit- 
ed agriculturist in the district, has reclaimed many acres of bog 
land ; and splendid crops of corn are now raised on what was be- 
fore " a possession for the bittern and pools of water." The ex- 
ample of Mr Guthrie has given a stimulus to agricultural improve- 
ment in the parish. 

Leases. — The general duration of leases is nineteen years. 

Farm-Biiildingsy c. — The farm-houses about fifty years ago 
were very miserable, but they are now very comfortable dwellings. 

The general fence in the lowland part of the parish is the turf- 
dike sown with whins. The thorn hedge is not very common, 
and does not thrive well in all situations. In the highland district 
the common fence is the Galloway dike, built of dry stones. It 
is built 5 feet 2 inches high for sheep, and 4 feet 2 inches for cat- 
tle. The first can be built for Is. 4d. per rood, and the latter 
for Is. 



92 



"VVIGTONSHIRE. 



The principal obstacle to improvement arises from the want of 
capital among the tenantry. 

Raw Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce rais- 
ed in the parish may probably be as under : 

Produce of grain of all kinds, - L. 15 200 

of green crop, potatoes, turnip, &amp;c. . 6,500 

of hay, - _ J 

of crops cultivated for the arts, as flax, ' 40 

of land in pasture, _ 7,000 

 Ti/r f , " L. 30.240 

 Manufactures. — Manufactures have never been introduced into 
the parish to any extent. 

Navigation,— hochvoxx affords great facilities for shipping. 
There is excellent shelter and excellent anchorage opposite the 
village of Cairnryan. Here, with proper ground tackle, a vessel 
may ride out the heaviest gale. Lochryan has long been a place 
of refuge for the shipping of the Clyde, and vessels navigating the 
Irish Channel. It has often been suggested as the best station 
for the mail-packets between Scotland and Ireland. A Govern- 
ment survey was lately made with reference to this object, and it 
is understood to have been the opinion of the distinguished naval 
officer employed in that service, that Lochryan is the fittest sta- 
tion. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Town. — The nearest market-town is Stranraer. It is 
three miles distant from the parish church. 

Villages. — The principal village is Cairnryan. Its population 
is about 300. It is seven miles distant from the parish church. 
Another village contains about 200. A suburb of Stranraer has 
been lately built within the parish of Inch, containing nearly 100. 

Means of Communication. — The great road from London to 
Portpatrick passes through the parish i also the road from Glas- 
gow to Portpatrick. Three mail-coaches travel daily through 
the parish. The Stranraer and Glasgow steamer, and the Stran- 
raer and Belfast steamer call regularly at Cairnryan, and receive 
and land passengers and goods. The parish thus enjoys facility of 
communication with all parts of the world. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is the only place of 
worship within the parish. It is eight or ten miles distant from 
some of the extremities of the parish. Many of the parishioners 
are situated at an inconvenient distance. It is proposed, however, 
to remedy this evil by the erection of a church at Cairnryan. The 
parish church was built in 1770. It is not in good repair, and is 



INCH. 



93 



too small. It only contains 400. Its situation is very beautiful. 
The woods and lakes of Castle- Kennedy are close adjoining. On 
a fine summer evening the scene is exquisitely sweet. 

The manse was pulled down and rebuilt during the summer of 
1838. 

The glebe is about 18 acres in extent, and may be valued at 
about 15s. or 20s. per acre. I am adding four acres more by drain- 
ing a loch. 

The stipend is L. 258, 12s. 3d. 

The number of persons professedly belonging to the Established 
Church is 1965. The number of persons belonging to other re- 
ligious denominations is 689. The number not known to belong 
to any religious denomination is 30. 

Divine service 'at the Established Church is well attended in 
proportion to the size of the church, but not in proportion to the 
population. The number of communicants is 400. 

There is an association in the parish for the purpose of pro- 
moting the General Assembly's four schemes. From L. 12 to 
L. 20 may be raised annually. 

Education. — There are generally four schools in the parish, 
sometimes a fifth during the winter months. One of these is pa- 
rochial, the rest are on the teachers' own adventure. The branches 
taught in the parochial school are, Latin, Greek, English, writing, 
arithmetic, practical mathematics, geography. In the private 
schools, the branches taught are chiefly English, writing, and 
arithmetic. The parochial teacher has the minimum salary, house 
and garden. The school fees are 2s. 6d. or 3s. for reading; 5s. 
for the higher branches. The fees may amount to L. 20 per an- 
num. The teacher receives about L. 6 as session-clerk. The num- 
ber of persons between six and fifteen years of age who cannot read 
or write may be 16. The number upwards of fifteen years of age 
who cannot read or write 20. The people are in general alive to 
the benefits of education. There is one part of the parish three 
or four miles distant from any school, but the population there is 
very scanty. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is 50. The average sum allotted to each 
per annum is L. 1, 12s. About L. 90 is annually disbursed by 
the session for the support of the poor, for coffins and funeral ex- 
penses for the poor, and for paying precentor, session-clerk, pres- 
bytery-clerk, synod-clerk, beadle, &amp;c. The amount of contribu-

tions may be stated as follows: Church collections, L. 43; pro- 
clamations, L. 3, 2s. 6d. ; mortcloth, L. 4, 16s. ; fines, L. 5, 4s. ; 
donations, L. 12, 15s.; interest of funds left for the poor, L. 20, 
16s. 8d. ; total, L. 89, 14s. 2d. There is a disposition among the 
Scottish poor to refrain from seeking parochial aid. There is no 
disposition of this kind among the Irish settlers. 

Fairs. — There is a monthly cattle-market from April to Octo- 
ber, held within the bounds of the parish. Though held in the 
parish of Inch, it is called the Stranraer cattle-market. 

Inns, 8fc. — There are nine inns or public-houses within the pa- 
rish. Three would be sufficient. The part of the parish where 
public-houses are most numerous is the lowest in point of morals. 

Fuel. — The fuel in general use in the parish is peat. Peats 
can be cut and prepared for from 5d. to 7d..per cart-load. What- 
ever coal is used in the parish is imported from Ayrshire.

PRESBYTERY OF STRANRAE'r, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY. 

THE REV. DAVID WILSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
iame, Boundaries, c. — According to Chalmers, in his ac- 
count of this parish, the name is of difficult derivation. Of old the 
name appeared under different forms, Stranrever, Stranraver, and 
Stronrawer. He says, " this name is obviously Celtic." Stion appears 
as the prefix of many appellations in the Scoto-Irish language of 
North Briton, and is from the Gaelic Sron or Stron, which signi- 
fies a nose or promontory, and is usually applied to projections 
from rising grounds. There is here such a projection, or nose, to 
which the Stron was probably applied. The annex raer may be the 
Gaelic Reamliar, which is pronounced Reavar, signifying thick, 
clumsy. So Stronreaver would signify the " thick nose or clumsy 
projection." The general opinion, however, and perhaps the best 
founded, is, that it derives its name from the strand or rivulet which 
divides the row, raw, of houses on its banks. Strandraw became in 
time to be named and snelt Stranrawer, and afterwards Stranraer.

STRANRAER.

The parish consists entirely of the burgh, the buildings of which 
cover a space of ground extending to about forty acres. In the year 
1617, it was erected and created a royal burgh by authority of the 
Crown, and a portion of the parish of Leswalt, as also of Soulseat, 
now called Inch, were disponed to the burgh. The corporation 
consists of a provost, two bailies, a dean of guild, and fifteen coun- 
cillors. Stranraer is the seat of the presbytery of the same name. 
The Parliamentary constituency at present is 217. The revenue 
of the corporation in 1833 was L. 225. 

It is bounded on the east and south by the parish of Inch ; on the 
west by the parish of Leswalt ; and on the north by Lochryan, a 
very beautiful bay, about 10 miles in length. The villages of 
Clayhole and Hillhead, in the parish of Leswalt and Tradeston, in 
the parish of Inch, beuig separated from Stranraer by an ideal line, 
are usually considered by strangers, and even by the inhabitants, as 
part of the town. They contain a population of about 1000. 

Climate. — The climate is temperate, and has always been con- 
sidered healthy. The atmosphere is pure and free from fogs. The 
winters in general are mild, except when north or north-east winds 
prevail, which they seldom do for any length of time. 

Zoology. — Various kinds of fish abound in Lochryan, such as 
skate, flounders, turbot, halibut, cod, haddocks, whitings, crabs, 
and lobsters. I sometimes hear it said, that, if the fishermen were 
more industrious, our fish-market would be better supplied than it 
is. Lochryan at one time was famous for its herring-fishery. I 
have heard old people say that they have known 300 sail-boats in 
the bay at one time, which had come from the Highlands and other 
places, in order to fish or purchase herrings. For many years past 
the shoals of herrings may be said to have deserted the loch. 
Oysters, of an excellent quality, and in great abundance, are to be 
found in the bay, particularly on a sand-bank called the Scar, which 
runs a considerable way across the loch from south-west to north- 
east. 

II. — Civil History. 

Land-owners. — As above-mentioned, the parish is entirely bur- 
gal, but the whole property is not directly held burgage, — part, be- 
longing to the Earl of Stair, is let in long leases of 99 and 999 
years, and part is subfeued by Vans Agnew of Sheuchan. The 
remainder is held burgage, and the magistrates exercise jurisdic- 
tion over the whole parish. 

Eminent Characters, — The famous John Livingstone wias mi-

WIGTONSI-IIRE. 



nister of Stranrtaer for ten years previously to 1648, in which 
year he was translated by the General Assembly to the parish of 
Ancrum, in Roxburghshire. On the accession of Charles II., 
sentence of banishment was passed upon him : he was ordered to 
leave Scotland in two months, and until his departure to remain 
north of the Tay. He removed to Rotterdam, where he after- 
wards continued to reside till his death, which took place in 1672. 
He was one of the leading clergymen of his day ; and is also well 
known for the valuable papers, particularly a MS, account of his 
own life, and " Remarkable Observations upon the Lives of the 
most eminent Ministers and Professors," both of which throw 
great light on the history of the times. — Murray's Lit. Hist, of 
Galloway, 2d edit. pp. 96 — 106. Mr Livingstone was succeed- 
ed at Stranraer by Mr John Park, previously minister of Moch- 
rum. Mr Park was ejected from his charge at the Restoration ; 
and though having accepted the Indulgence, he was anxious to re- 
turn to Stranraer, the people also " as one man," says Wodrow, 
" adhering to him ; yet a Mr Naismith, a minion of the bishop 
of the diocese, was put in his place. Mr Park," says Wodrow, 
" was a man of great solidity, very sufficient learning, and' is the 
author of the treatise on Patronages, so well known in this church. 
The book was published, and, as I am well informed, consider- 
ably enlarged by his son, Mr Robert Park, Clerk to the General 
Assembly, after the Revolution, and town-clerk of Glasgow, who 
was basely murdered in the Clerk's Chamber at Glasgow, a little 
after the Revolution." — Church History, ii. p. 147. 

1 1 1. POPUL ATI O N. 

In the Old Statistical Account of this parish, it is stated, 
that, by the return from this parish made to Dr Webster about 
forty years "prior to 1790, the amount was 649 souls, and at 
the' beginning of 1791 it was 1602; according to the census 
of 1831 it was 3329. The increase of the population for the 
last forty years may be accoimted for by the improvement of 
the agriculture of the neighbouring parishes. Stranraer being the 
principal sea-port, and having vessels which trade between it, Glas- 
gow, Liverpool, and other large towns, they import the necessaries- 
and comforts of life. The population of the neighbouring parishes 
having increased in consequence of the increased culture of the 
land, more shops have been opened to supply them with these ne- 
cessaries. Besides, of late years, a great many of the natives of the 
sister island, having left their country in quest of food and employ- 



8TIIANRAER. 



97 



ment, have located themselves in hovels erected in the lanes and 
outskirts of the town, and depend, in a great measure, for subsist- 
ence, on the charity of the inhabitants. 

Number of families in the parish, - - - - 727 

chiefly employed in agriculture, - - - 7 

trade, manufactures, or handicraft, &amp;c, 720 

The average number of births yearly for the seven years pre- 
ceding 1831 is 48, as entered in the register of births and bap- 
tisms. To this must be added at least one-third more baptized by 
Dissenting clergymen, and not entered into the parish register. As 
there is no register of deaths kept in the parish, I cannot ascertain 
the average number of deaths for the last seven years. 



Average number of marriages is - . - 17 

persons under 15 years of age, - 1094 

betwixt 15 and 30, - - 932

Number of illegitimate births during the last three years, 17. 
Inhabited houses, 489. 

There is no family of noble blood residing in the parish. There 
are a few individuals of independent fortune, but the bulk of the 
population depend for their subsistence upon some hne of business. 
There is at present residing within the burgh 1 insane person ; 1 
fatuous ; 2 blind ; 1 deaf and dumb. 

Language. — The language generally spoken is tolerably good. 
The lower orders of whom a great many are natives of Ireland 
have a good deal of the accent of that country. Indeed, strangers 
allege that all classes of the inhabitants have a good deal of the 
Irish accent. This, no doubt, arises from our proximity to Ireland, 
and our very frequent intercourse with the Irish. 

There are no customs, games, or amusements, so far as I know, 
peculiar to this part of the country. 

Habits of the People. — The habits of the people, I believe, are 
pretty much the same as in towns of the same description. There 
IS a good deal of poverty, want of cleanliness, and wretchedness 
among the population in the outskirts and lanes of the town, who 
are mostly the lower orders of Irish. Smuggling, though carried on 
to a great extent formerly, if at all, is not carried on now to any ex- 
tent. It is to the vigilance of the officers of the Coast- Guard that 
this is in a great measure owing. Pawnbroking is carried on among 
the Irish residents, but not to a great extent. 

IV. — Industry. 
Manufactures.— T\iQ high price of fuel prevents the establish- 

WIGTON. r. 



98 



WIGTONSIIIRE. 



ment of any extensive manufactures in the parisli. There are a 
number of individuals engaged in weaving, in the employment of 
Glasgow houses. The wages allowed are extremely low, and total- 
ly insufficient to support a family in a comfortable manner. 

Navigation. — There are thirty-eight vessels at present belong- 
ing to this port. Tonnage of 37 vessels in the year 1835, 1789. 
A pier was built about twenty years ago, at which tolerably large 
vessels may lay ; but they can only approach at high water. 

Public Associations. — There is an agricultural Society, and a So- 
ciety for the encouragement of fishermen ; but they have been so 
lately established, that any beneficial influence they may have 
cannot yet be judged of. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State. — At present, the only place of worship in 
the parish to accommodate the population attached to the Esta- 
blishment is a wooden building erected about three years ago at 
the expense of the clergyman, at the risk of getting the seats let, — 
the burgh being entirely without public funds. The old church 
was condemned by the presbytery in 1833, as ruinous and irrepara- 
ble. It was built in the year 1766, and was calculated to contain 
about 700 sitters. There were no free sittings in the Old Church, 
but the sittings were so low as to be within the power of the poor- 
est in the community. 

Manse. — The minister has no manse ; but, by an act of Parlia- 
ment of George IV., he has L. 30 in lieu thereof. Strictly speak- 
ing he has no glebe, but about one hundred years ago, one of his 
predecessors in office, Mr Laurie of Reid Castle, a man of fortune, 
in order to encourage his successors in office in all time coming, 
mortified to them about thirty acres of land in the adjoining pa- 
rish of Leswalt, in order to supply the want of a glebe. As by 
the act of Parliament above alluded to, every clergymen whose 
living is under L. 200 per annum, and has no glebe, is allowed 
L. 20 in lieu thereof, immediately after the passing of that act, I 
made apphcation to be ranked in the list of those who have not 
legal glebes ; for it appeared to me, as well as to others whom I 
consulted, that it could not be the intention of the Legislature to 
consider any private benefaction to a living, and particularly that 
of a clergyman to his successors in office, as part of that living. 
The Officers of State, however, opposed my claim, and the Court 
of Session, by a majority, decided against me, on the plea, that, 
though the mortified lands do not legally constitute a glebe, they 



STRANRAER. 



99 



are at least equal to a glebe. It was evidently the intention of the 
benevolent donor to place his successors in office on a footing with 
their neighbours, or, to use his own words, " to encourage my suc- 
cessors in office in all time coming." Although it would be pre- 
sumption in me to call in question the legality of the decision of 
the Supreme Court of Scotland, I cannot avoid saying, that it to - 
tally defeats the generous intention of the donor, and holds out but 
little encouragement to such benevolent individuals, as, knowing 
the peculiar state of any particular parish, may contribute of his 
private fortune to better the circumstances of the officiating cler- 
gyman of that parish. The lands mortified to supply the place of 
a glebe were valued by the Court of Session, in the year 1821, at 
L. 56, when farm produce was double the value that it has been 
for some years. The same benevolent clergyman who mortified 
the lands, left a house and garden in the town to supply the want 
of a manse ; but as it was condemned by the presbytery about twenty 
years ago, and as the funds which Mr Laurie had in view to repair 
it the vacant stipend, have not, for many years, been available, 
the house is in a state of ruin. 

Stipend. — My present emoluments are L. 150 per annum, the mi- 
nimum. That portion of stipend, L, '24, 10s. 8d. per year, payable 
by the magistrates, has now been four years in arrear. The magis- 
trates have proposed to assess the inhabitants for the amount, but 
hitherto the assessment has been resisted. I believe that Stran- 
raer is the only instance in Scotland of a royal burgh, the seat of 
a presbytery, having only one minister, and that minister on the 
small stipend list. 

Chapels of Ease. — -There are no chapels of ease attached to the 
Established Church, nor any missionaries or catechists. The fol- 
lowing are the places of worship within the parish not connected 
with the Establishment : 1 Reformed Presbyterian ; 2 United Se- 
cession ; 1 Relief ; and 1 Catholic chapel. The ministers of the 
above churches are chiefly paid by seat rents. None of their 
stipends exceed L. 150 ; and they average from L. 100 to L. 120 
per annum. 

Of the population in 1835 1729 belonged to the Established 
Church ; 1033 to the Protestant Dissenting congregations ; and 
161 to the Catholics; 151 not known to belong to any religious 
denomination. From the above statement, it would appear that, 
since the census taken in 1831, the population has decreased from 
3329 to 3074. This is to be accounted for in the following man- 



100 



WIGTONSHIRE. 



ner, viz. : A number of new houses have been built in the sub- 
urbs, within the Parliamentary boundary, since the passing of the 
Reform Bill, and which are occupied by persons who lately resid- 
ed in the town, and who still consider themselves as belonging to 
the town, though not, strictly speaking, in the parish, and such of 
them as belonged to the Established Church, still attend it. All 
the seats in the temporary building for the accommodation of the 
Established congregation are let, and the congregation is very 
regular in attendance. I believe that the Dissenting chapels 
are well attended also. The communicants on the roll last year 
were 447 : the average rber may be about 400. The average 
amount of the collections at the church-door for rehofious and cha- 
ritable purposes, may be about L. 60 per annum. 

Religious Societies. — A Bible Society was instituted in 1809 ; 
amount of funds about L. 55. There is also a Sabbath School So- 
ciety. 

Education. — The schools in the parish are, one parochial ; 
one supported by a Society ; and six unendowed. The branches 
taught in the parochial school are, English, French, Latin, 
Greek, practical mathematics, writing, and accounts. In the 
other schools, English, writing, and accounts. The salary of the 
parochial schoolmaster is L. 20 per annum, and the amount of 
school fees about L. 50. He has no allowance for a house or 
garden. The average salaries of the other teachers may be about 
L. 25. The general expense of education per year is from 12s. 
to L. 1. Of the young betwixt six and fifteen years of age, there 
are few who cannot either read or write. Few, if any, born in the 
parish, above fifteen years of age, but can both read and write. 

Libraries. — There are two excellent public subscription libra- 
ries in the parish, — the one containing works of general literature, 
the other chiefly of theological works. The members of both re- 
side in the town and neighbourhood. There is a very good public 
reading-room, at which several Scotch, English, and Irish news- 
papers are received. There is a periodical published in the town 
monthly. It has been about eighteen months in existence. 

Charitable Institutions. — A Dispensary for giving advice and 
medicines to the poor called the Stranraer and Rhins of Gallo- 
way Public Dispensary, was instituted about twenty years ago. 
It is supported by subscriptions among the inhabitants of the town 
and neighbouring parishes. The funds have hitherto been ade- 



STKANllAEll. 



101 



quate to the expenditure. 'J' he average number of patients is 
from 50 to 60 yearly. 

Friendly Societies, — There are three Friendly Societies, which 
have been about twenty years in existence. They certainly have 
been attended with good effects in promoting industry, and a de- 
sire of independence among their members. 

Savings' Bank. — There is a Savings' bank in the parish, which 
was established in the year 1826. The average amount deposited 
yearly is L. 500, and withdrawn about L. 100. The investments 
are generally made by mechanics and servant girls. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid may be about forty. There is no stated 
sum allowed to each per week or year, except to such as are con- 
fined to bed. The funds from which the poor are supplied, consist 
of the collections at the church, averaging about ]j. 50 per annum, 
exclusive of occasional extraordinary collections in aid of the funds; 
the interest of L. 450 bequeathed by the late Earl of Stair; and 
about L. 30 from legacies. Hitherto, there has been no legal as- 
sessment for the poor, but it is feared it must ere long be resorted 
to. The bulk of the poor are natives of Ireland, who have left 
their native country in quest of food and employment, and who, 
probably, having in their native country been brought up beg- 
gars, have no disinclination to beg. There are many of the poor 
natives of the parish who have a disinclination to ask parochial 
relief; but it is most gratifying to think that there are also many 
humane persons to whom Providence has been more hberal, who 
seek out such objects and relieve them. 

Prisons. — There is a prison in the parish, in which about 40 
prisoners were confined during last year,— some for debt, others 
for theft and assault. The prison is well secured. Proper means 
are observed for preserving the health of the prisoners, in diet, &amp;c. 
It is under the superintendence of a jailor and two assistants. 

Fairs. — There are, in the course of the year, five or six fairs for 
black-cattle,' and three or four for horses. 

Inns, Ale-houses, Sfc. — There are two very good inns in the pa- 
rish, besides many others where spirits and ale are sold. 

Fuel— Coals brought by sea, and turf, are the principal fuel. 
Coals are very high in price. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since the last Statistical Account was published, there have 
been a great many new houses built in the town. The necegsa-

ries of life are much higher than they were at that period, being, 
with very few exceptions, as high as in the larger towns.

<p>

PRESBYTERY OF STRANRAER, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY. 

REV. WILLIAM ROSE, MINISTER.  



L--- Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The word Kirkcolm is a corruption of Kirk Columba, 
the parish having been named after St Columba, who flourished 
in the sixth century. It is uncertain whether this celebrated per- 
son was born in Ireland or Scotland, but, according lo Buchanan 
and Spottiswood, he was held in great repute in the latter coun- 
try. He established himself in one of the western islands, called 
from him Icolmkill, or the chapel of Columba, and devoted his 
life to the conversion of the natives to Christianity. Missionaries 
emanated from that island to preach the Gospel in various parts 
of the west of Scotland ; and the church built in this district was 
dedicated to him. 

Extent, Boundaries, Sfc. — This parish is a small peninsula, sur- 
rounded by the sea on all sides except the south, where it is bounded 
by the parish of Leswalt. Its average breadth, from the bay of 
Loch Ryan to the Irish Channel, is 4 miles : its length, along 
the west coast of Loch Ryan, from 5 to 5| miles. On this coast 
there is a shelving bank of sand, called the Scar, running oblique- 
ly into the loch about a mile, not entirely covered by the sea at 
the highest spring tides : it forms a natural basin called the Wig, 
which affords a secure anchorage in severe weather for small ves- 
sels, while ships of larger size find a safe retreat on the opposite 
coast of the loch, where there is greater depth of water. 

Topographical Appearances.— The parish generally presents to 
the eye an undulating surface. The hills partake of the charac- 
ter of the adjoining parts of the country ; they are never high 
nor steep, and the absence of abrupt or rocky acclivities has en- 

' Drawn up, at the request of the Minister of the Tarish, by Graham F. Moore, 
Esr„ Barrister at Law, of the Temple, London.

abled them to be, cultivated to their summits. The greater 
part of the land slopes gradually towards the west. For more 
than three miles from the southern boundary of the parish, the 
coast of Loch Ryan is a sandy beach ; there is next a rocky pro- 
montory, Clachan Heugh : to the north of it is the Bay of Port- 
more, affording good anchorage for large vessels : from this bay, 
round Corswall Point and along the Irish Channel, the land is 
bounded by a ridge of rocks, presenting bold and striking features. 
Towards the mouth of Loch Ryan there are several caves and fis- 
sures in the rocks ; one of which affords an entrance to the extent 
of 145 feet, as ascertained by measurement. 

Meteorology. — It appears from the returns of observations made 
at Corswall Lighthouse, and kindly furnished for this work by Mr 
Stevenson, the engineer, that for the ten years ending with 1834, 
the mean height of the barometer at 9 a. m. is 29.806 in., and at 9 
p. M. 29.806 in. : that the mean height of the thermometer at the 
same time is 49° 942 and 49° 189 : and that the quantity of rain 
indicated by the guage is 34.10 inches. 

The prevailing winds are from the north-west to the south-west, 
which blow over the whole western part of the parish with great 
violence, especially during the winter months; but where the hills 
or the few plantations that exist, break the force of these winds, 
the climate may be ranked among the mildest in Scotland, and 
the proximity to the sea on all sides prevents the continuance of 
frost or snow. Less rain falls here than on the opposite coast of 
Ayrshire, where the hills are much higher. 

The most frequent maladies are consumption, rheumatism, and 
inflammatory disorders caused by exposure to cold, epilepsy, and 
paralysis. 

Hydrography. — Springs of pure water abound in almost every 
part of the parish. There is only one stream of any consequence : 
it serves to turn the mill of Corswall, where nearly half of the 
grain of the parish is ground. A mile from the Bay of Lochryan, 
towards the centre of the parish, there is a lake called Loch Con- 
nel, fed by several streams flowing from the adjoining marshy 
lands : it is about a mile in circumference : there is nothing strik- 
ing in the scenery around it. A stream issues from it, which, 
joined by some small rivulets, enters the parish of Leswalt, where 
it turns two mills above two miles distant from each other ; but 
both close to the southern boundary of Kirkcolm, at which the 
grain of the adjacent parts of Kirkcolm is ground.

WIGTONSHIRt:. 



Geologij. — The geology of Kirkcolm is not without interest. 
Professor Jameson was the first who traced out the geological struc- 
ture of the great southern high landof Scotland, and ascertained that 
its predominating rocks belong to the transition class. Afterwards 
his celebrated pupil, Dr Bou.e, and a good observer, Dr Grierson of 
New Galloway, now minister of Cockpen, in Mid-Lothian, went 
over the same ground, and obtained similar results. Dr Thomson, in 
the second volume of his Outlines of Mineralogy, at pp. 181, 182, 
sums up what was previously known in the following terms : " There 
is a range of transition mountains in Scotland, which begins at St 
Abb's head, the southern termination of the Frith of Forth, and 
extends with little interruption till it terminates in the Irish sea, 
on the north side of Loch Ryan in Galloway. This range ex- 
tends in length about 120 miles, and includes the mountains of 
Galloway, Dumfries, Lanark, Peebles, Mid-Lothian, and Ber- 
wick. The highest part of the tract is near Moffat, where Hart- 
fell rises to the height of 3300 feet above the level of the sea. 
Lowther, near Lead-hills, is 3130 feet high. This mountainous 
tract is composed of transition rocks," p. 182. The Doctor adds, 
" Good sections of this greywacke may also be seen in the moun- 
tains north from Loch Ryan. The road from Glasgow to Portpa- 
trick crosses these mountains. It is steep and inconvenient for the 
traveller, but admirably contrived to furnish the geologist with sec- 
tions of transition rocks. The hill behind General Wallace's house 
at Cairn is composed of clay-slate, and this slate, alternating with 
greywacke, may be traced for several miles north till the moun- 
tainous country suddenly terminates a little to the south of Girvan." 

Now,, to satisfy any observer that the northern part of the pe- 
ninsula, which forms the parish of Kirkcolm, is merely a continua- 
tion of the great transition range just noticed, rising from the 
western shore of Loch Ryan on the eastern boundary of the pa- 
rish, and terminating in the Irish Channel on its western boun- 
dary, it is only necessary to inspect the rocks, as they are visible at 
the following points : at Lady Bay and Sloughnagarry, near Cors- 
wall House, at the parish school-house, at Portmoulin, near Cors- 
wall Lighthouse, at Aires, which lies south-west from it, and at 
Cairnbrook, on the south-west extremity of the parish. At all 
these points, strata of greywacke, alternating with greywacke

slate and clay-slate, are distinctly visible: tlieii- position nearly 
vertical, their direction nearly east and west by the compass, and 
their being destitute of organic remains demonstrate their identity 
with the strata of the great southern high land above referred to. 
There are some minor points in reference to these strata which may 
be noticed. When a rivulet flows into the sea, whether it traverses 
the strata across the direction of their cleavage, or parallel to it, 
some disturbance in their direction is observable. At Portmouhn, 
the strata run in a direction nearly parallel to the sea, which here 
washes the northern boundary of the parish ; on the east side of 
a rivulet, the strata run in a direction nearly from north-east to 
south-west ; while on the western side of the rivulet, their direc- 
tion is nearly from south-west to north-east. At Cairnbrook, 
where the western termination of the strata sinks nearly at right 
anffles into the sea, the rivulet does not cut the strata as at Port- 
moulin, but flows nearly parallel to their direction ; a slight dis- 
turbance, however, is also here observable ; on the north side of the 
brook, they run in a direction nearly from north-west to south-east, 
while on its south side they run nearly due east and west. When- 
ever these strata are exposed to the action of the sea, the clay- 
slate is decomposed much more rapidly than the other materials. 
Deep and well-defined chasms are thus left, which the motion of 
the waters is rapidly filling in some situations with the shingle of 
the coast, consisting of water-worn fragments of granite, green- 
stone, porphyry, basaltic amygdaloid, sand, and sea-weeds. From 
this coast the sea seems to have everywhere receded, and, after 
having for a time acted upon these strata, to have left them free 
from its influence. In this case the site of the clay-slate strata 
may be observed at some distance from the shore, to form green 
swarded intervals, while the greywacke, &amp;c. may be detected in their 
original position in rocky relief. On the beach, the spaces be- 
tween the greywacke strata vacated by the clay-slate, are used by 
fishermen as small harbours or rather docks, into which they drag 
and secure their boats. The tide fills these chasms, while the 
greywacke strata are elevated above its influence. These appear- 
ances are chiefly to be observed on the eastern and western shores 
of the peninsula ; on the northern shore, where a stratum of grey- 
wacke is exposed to the ocean in a lateral position, they are less 
to be noticed. Where exposed to the action of rain and the at- 
mosphere, these strata become nearly of a white colour ; where- 
ever they are exposed to the action of the sea, they become al-

most black ; Algae and Testacca adhere to Lliem very sparingly, 
whde on the conglomerate rock at Corswall, these substances are 
found covering it everywhere in the greatest profusion. The ef- 
fect produced by the sea upon the colour of rocks is curious. 
Greywacke becomes from the action of the water of an uniform 
black, while the boulders of greenstone found on the shores of 
Loch Ryan assume an appearance exactly resembling the sur- 
face of some of the more massive corallines, of a paler colour than 
the fracture of the stone, and of regular figures and shades. On 
a close inspection of the surface of such rocks, no incipient process 
of vegetation, or of chemical decomposition, can be detected. In 
the greywacke strata are numerous thin veins of quartz : thin veins 
of carbonate of lime, and carbonate of barytes also occurs in them ; 
and throughout these in most places a regular system of cleavage 
prevails, which causes vents to ascend through them at an angle 
of about 45° from the surface of the ocean. Extending from the 
beach near Corswall House, to Sloughnagarry, a distance of about 
two miles, there is what miners would term the outcrop of a con- 
glomerate rock, which evidently lies in an unconformable position 
over the greywacke strata, and, like the conglomerate of Oban, si- 
milarly situated, it seems composed chiefly of fragments of those 
rocks, varying in size from a circumference of several feet to the 
fifth and sixth part of an inch. Some of these fragments are 
water -worn, but the greater part of them retain a sharp fracture, 
and are but little abraded. The smallest fragments are generally 
the finest grained, and the whole are cemented by a friable sub- 
stance, resembling old red sandstone. This conglomerate is tra- 
versed in veins, strata, and masses, by the old red sandstone, and 
covered by a coating of sandy light soil, mixed with gravel, form - 
ed chiefly of fragments of water-worn chlorite slate, quartz rock, 
and granite. On this soil, some of the most thriving plantations 
, of forest trees on the Corswall estate are situated. The extent 
of this deposit is not accurately ascertained. It seems identical 
with the conglomerate of Oban and Kerrera, described by geo- 
logists. It ought not to escape the attention of the geologist, 
how rapidly the old red sandstone, wherever it occurs in strata 
in this deposit, is decomposed, and floated olf by the action 
of the sea, nor how rapidly the chasms thus left are filled by 
such influx of the tide, with sand and shingle of a different 
composition, which seems destined to consolidate in place of 
the sandstone strata. In a small ravine near Lady Bay, there oc-

curs, on the sides of a brook, a sandstone stratum of considerable 
thickness, immediately under a stratum, about two feet thick, of a 
clayey schistus. The latter breaks easily into rhomboidal fragments, 
and both strata dip in a gentle slope to the west, cropping out to the 
bay about a quarter of a mile from the greywacke strata, as seen at 
Lady Bay. The sandstone stratum splits into laminated fragments, 
and has been used as a building stone ; and might, perhaps, in some 
situations be useful for paving stones. These strata evidently re- 
pose in an unconformable position over the greywacke strata, and 
seem to take the place of the conglomerate, which terminates 
abruptly at Sloughnagarry, where a small ravine divides it from 
this laminated sandstone stratum. The latter is evidently but of 
limited extent. 

From the foregoing observations, it is obvious that the geologi- 
cal position to be assigned to Kirkcolm is that of the greywacke 
and old red sandstone formation. It is in such formations that the 
metalliferous veins, particularly those of copper ore, are generally 
most prevalent. From Corswall House to the southern extremi- 
ty of the parish, the red sandstone conglomerate formation recedes 
in its outcrop from the beach, which is low and flat, and strewed 
with shingle and boulder-stones of granite, sienite, greywacke, 
greenstone, basaltic amygdaloid, chlorite slate, greywacke slate, 
clay slate, &amp;c. Several boulders of indurated chalk the Irish 
limestone have also been found on this beach ; but it seems pro- 
bable that these have served for ballast to vessels. Their surface 
is curiously perforated, as if eaten by some insect, probably some 
marine species preserving characteristics analogous to the pholas. 
It was in this part of the parish that Sir Andrew Agnew, some 
vears ago, put down a bore in search of coal ; but the undertaking 
was abandoned. The following were the strata passed :

Upon the estate of Corswall a stratum of clay occurs very near 
the surface, and very abundant. It possesses the characters of 
potter's clay ; and, in the expectation that it might be found to 
answer as a body clay, in lieu of the Derbyshire clay, it has been 
tried by practical persons, who report it to afford but little refuse, 
and to work sweetly. The ware, however, made from it, was dis- 
coloured by the iron in the clay, in away which was not approved

of; but since the trials of it were made, some clay has been found 
of much superior whiteness and purity. This stratum is about two 
feet in depth. 

In the more elevated situations in the parish, there are several 
tracts of peat moss. As is frequent in such situations, the stems and 
trunks of forest trees are found in these mosses, of different spe- 
cies, and of large size. 

Zoology.— Vner this head there is little to distinguish Kirkcolm 
from the rest of the west coast of Scotland. As to quadrupeds, 
foxes and badgers have not been seen here for the last thirty years. 
There are still polecats in some places. Rabbits, of which there are 
some everywhere, are not nearly so plenty as they once were. 
There are many hares, though they have not now strong cover 
everywhere to protect them. Moles are much diminished in num- 
ber by the employment of mole-catchers on many farms. Of 
birds, the heath-fowl have long left this parish ; grouse very sel- 
dom are seen in it ; partridges are in abundance ; pheasants have 
been lately introduced into the plantations of Corswall, and mul- 
tiply rapidly. Along the shores,, or in the interior of the parish, 
wild goose and wild duck, teal and widgeon, the green and the 
gray plover, the large and the small curlew, the snipe, woodcock, 
and rail, may, at the proper seasons, be found. Starlings and field- 
fares now come in much larger flocks than formerly ; and some of 
both species build their nests here. There are a few wood-pigeons. 
Many of the small blue pigeons build in some of the caves on the 
shore ; in other caves, rooks and hawks, and owls of different kinds, 
bring out their young. Of singing birds, the lark and goldfinch are 
less abundant ; the thrush and blackbird much more abundant than 
formerly. The species of fishes most prevalent on the shores of 
this parish are salmon, sea-trout, herring, cod, haddock, whiting, 
ling, mackarel, mullet, sea-eel, sole, flounder, skate, turbot, hali- 
but, gurnard, lobster, and crab. The sea-urchin is also often found, 
but mostly destitute of its inhabitant. 

Testaceology. — The following list contains the shells most com- 
monly found in Loch Ryan, many of them destitute of the animals 
originally inhabiting them, which have perished ; but the list may 
not be without interest : Solen ensis, Solen siliqua, Ostrea edw 
lis. Turbo neritoides, Pecten maximus, Pecten varius, Venernpis 
pullastra, Venerupis perforans, Turbo littoreus. This testacea is 
very abundant, adhering in a live state to the conglomerate rocks 
near Corswall House, where they are washed by the sea; Bidla

This latter testacea is found alive in considerable abundance, ad- 
hering to the red sandstone conglomerate of Corswall. It is from 
a vein in this animal that the liquid substance which imparts a 
brilliant and lasting purple dye to linens and cottons, is obtained. 
When first extracted from the animal, this liquid is of a muddy yel- 
low tint, but becomes purple on exposure to the atmosphere. It 
is known by the fetid smell of garlic, which it has when the vein 
is first opened, but this speedily disappears. Modiola vulgaris,

ance to the red sandstone conglomerate on the shore of Cors- 
wall, wherever exposed to the flux and influx of the tide. 
When the limpet is first detached from the rock, its inhabitant 
contains abundantly a liquid resembling in hue the yellow of raw 
Terra Sienna, which may be used as a pigment in water colours. 
The extraordinary quantities in which the limpet, whelk, lepas, &amp;c. 
adhere to this conglomerate deposit, are very remarkable, especi- 
ally when the boulder stones with which the shore is strewed, con- 
sisting of masses of granite, sienite, greywacke, basaltic amygda- 
loid, greenstone, serpentine, &amp;c. are observed to be wholly desti- 
tute of them. The same remark applies in regard to the sea-weed ; 
and where the conglomerate is not exposed to the action of the 
tides, the diff'erent species of lichens and other stone plants are 
much more abundantly spread on its surface than on the greywacke 
and slate rocks of the same locality. 

Botany. — From the extent and variety of coast by which the 
greater part of Kirkcolm is surrounded, we should naturally ex- 
pect to find a considerable variety of those plants which grow in 
maritime districts. In this we are not disappointed ; for, besides the 
common species usually found in such situations, we find abun- 
dantly Scirpus maritimus and Savii ; Asplenium marinum, Juncus 
maritimus, Oenanthe pimpinelloides ; more sparingly, Carex ex- 
tensa, Sagina maritima, Pinguicula Lusitanica, Erythrcea littoralis, 
Crithmum mnritimum, Daucus maritimus ; also, Hypericum An- 

 For this account of the botany of Kirkcohn, tlie author is indebted to the kind- 
ness of Mr Gilbert M'Nab of Edinburgli, who has visited this district.

droscsmuyn. On the grassy banks and rocks on the coast, and in 
dry barren pastures throughout the parish, we find Ulex nanus, 
Jasione montana, Sedum Anglicum ; and rarely, Symphytum offi- 
cinale, vLT.Jlore ferri nigro. In the bays and ditches, Anagallis 
teneUa, Helosciadium nodiflorum, Lythrum salicaria. In a loch 
near the boundary of this parish with Leswalt, there is abundance 
of Lobelia Dortmanna. In the cultivated fields and waste grounds, 
Lepidium campestre, Stachys arvensis, Lamium intermedium and 
incisicm, grow in profusion. 

II. — Civil History. 

This parish is singularly deficient in antiquities, records, and 
traditions. The only account of it to be found, except in the Old 
Statistical Account, is that contained in Sympson's Description of 
Galloway, written in 1684, and published in 182a 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners, placed in the order of 
their valuations are, the Proprietors of the Ship Bank, Glasgow, 
who have acquired the lands of West Corswall and Bansalloch ; 
James Carrick Moore, Esq. of East Corsvall ; Sir Andrew Agnew 
of Lochnaw, Bart., M. P. for the county. The other land-owners 
are, David Ritchie, Esq. of Aires ; John Fergusson, Esq. of Cairn- 
brook ; Charles Wallace, John Forsyth, and Alexander M'Neill, 
Esqs., who have acquired parts of the lands of Aires and Knock- 
brake ; and Mr James M'Meihan of M'Meihan's croft. 

Parochial Registers. — No parochial register has been preserved 
here of an earlier date than 1775. In that year a register of births 
and baptisms, but with many omissions, commenced : a register of 
proclamations commenced in 1791, and soon after, a record of 
the ordinary business of the kirk- session : a register of burials com- 
menced in 1796. Since the beginning of the year 1822, the births 
and proclamations, except in the case of Dissenters, have been 
pretty regularly entered. Burials are entered as given in by the 
kirk-officer to the session-clerk : and this register, as kept at pre- 
sent, appears to be nearly correct. 

Antiquities. — In the northern part of the parish, within a mile of 
the sea, stand the remains of Corswall Castle, " once," says Symp- 
son, " a considerable house," but when he wrote, " wholly ruinous." 
It is a tower, with walls of great thickness, built of irregular stones, 
with mortar, now as hard as the stones, and with small slits for 
windows. It is now not more than 20 feet high. As the higher 
parts of the wall fell down, the stones were taken by the people in 
the neighbourhood to build their dikes. About fifty years ago,

Ill 



a cannon seven feet in length, with a bore of three inches diame- 
ter, was discovered in the ruins ; and a few years ago, a silver 
plate with an inscription, a gold ring, and some coins were found. 
About a mile from this castle, on a farm called Kirkbride, there 
was once a church dedicated to St Bride. Its foundations may still 
be traced. A part of the church-yard wall forms the side of a cot- 
tage. A tenant on the adjoining lands remembers, that, forty years 
ago, he dug up decayed pieces of coffins, with the iron handles, 
skulls, and other bones. The site was evidently chosen from the 
proximity of a well of remarkably pure water, which never fails 
in the driest seasons. There was anciently another chapel, called 
Kilmorie, or the Chapel of the Virgin, about a mile and a half 
from the present parish church, on the coast of Loch Ryan to- 
wards the south ; it was ruinous 150 years ago, and nothing is now 
visible but some fragments of a wall. The site of this chapel al- 
so appears to have been suggested by a spring of excellent water 
near it, of old esteemed beneficial in many disorders. Supersti- 
tion attached to it the discriminating power of becoming dry, if 
the patient for whom its water was sought had a mortal malady, 
but of appearing, in abundance if the disease was curable. From 
this chapel of Kilmorie, said to have been destroyed at the Refor- 
mation, a stone was brought, which, when the late parish church 
of Kirkcolm was repaired, 118 years ago, was placed as a lintel 
over its west door. In 1821, when that church was pulled down, 
this stone was left in the church-yard, and it has since been re- 
moved to the garden of Mr Carrick Moore. It is of grey whin- 
stone, carved on one side with armorial bearings, in so rude and 
primitive a style, that the figures can only be conjectured. There 
is the appearance of a shield, on which an animal is sculptured, 
surrounded by a cornucopia. A large cross, with some resemblance 
to the Maltese cross, surmounts the shield, on the lower part of 
which there appear to be two supporters, one resembling a fish, the 
other a serpent. On the other side of the stone is a figure whose 
arms are extended on a cross, and beneath it another figure, with 
the scarcely discernible appearance of an animal by its side. 

Modern Buildings. — The present parish church, built, not upon 
the site of the late church, but within less than a quarter of a mile 
from it, is a neat and commodious building, without a tower, but 
ornamented with buttresses. The only modern mansion deserving 
notice is Corswall House, the residence of Dr Carrick Moore, 
beautifully situated on a rising ground on the west bank of Loch

Rycan, commanding a view of the loch and of the adjoining coun- 
try, and surrounded by thriving young plantations. 

Corsioall Lighthouse. — The building in this parish which chiefly 
claims a detailed notice, is Corswall Lighthouse. — It is hardly pos- 
sible to allude to any of the maritime establishments in the Frith of 
Clyde, without alluding also to the noble estuary itself, which is per- 
haps connected viith fewer dangers to the mariner than any other 
navigable tract of similar extent in the united kingdom. If, for exam- 
ple, we look at the Thames and the Mersey, which lead to London 
and Liverpool, we find them encumbered to a perilous extent with 
sand-banks, while they are wholly unconnected with harbours of 
refuge ; whereas in the Clyde, from Greenock to its entrance be- 
tween Ireland and the opposite shores of Scotland, a distance of 
about 100 miles, there is every where an ample depth of water, 
with scarcely a snare to be met with ; while it is connected with 
the spacious natural harbours of Campbelltown and Lamlash on 
the north ; and of Loch Ryan on the south, at the entrance of 
which Corswall Lighthouse is situated. The erection of this very 
useful lighthouse was first brought under the notice of the Commis- 
sioners of the Northern Lighthouses by the late Mr Quintin Leitch, 
chief magistrate of Greenock ; a gentleman who, in early life, was 
distinguished as a mariner, and took much interest in every im- 
provement of the navigation of the Clyde. The first stone of the 
lighthouse was laid by Mr Leitch, on the 17th of June 1815, and 
the light was exhibited for the first time on the 15th of Septem- 
ber 1816. The building is situated on a projecting rocky part of 
Corswall point. It consists of a tower of masonry 86 feet in 
height, on the top of which the lantern is placed. The dwelling- 
house for the light- keepers is built apart from the tower, and con- 
sists of two floors, with cellars for the oil and other stores below. 
At some distance on either side of the lighthouse, there is a boat- 
creek, with roads leading from thence to the lighthouse, one of 
which also joins the parish road at some distance. The steps 
of the stair, and the other sandstone materials were brought from 
quarries in Ayrshire and the Isle of Arran ; but the rubble walls 
are built of the whinstone rock of the neighbourhood. As this 
description of stone does not readily adhere to mortar, much trou- 
ble was experienced in making the walls perfectly water-tight. 



• For the account of Corswall Lighthouse, the compiler begs leave to make his 
grateful acknowledgements to Robert Stevenson, Esq. Engineer to the Northern Light- 
houses.

Pointing- the joints carefully with mortar, and coating them with 
imboiled linseed oil, over which clean sharp sand, carefully screen- 
ed and dried, and in some instances, even used in a moderately hot 
state, was immediately cast, proved to be a perfect remedy. Since 
this was done, about fourteen years ago, the walls, which before were 
so moist as to threaten the rotting of the lath, were rendered com- 
pletely tight. 

The light-room consists of a frame of 16 sashes, and measures 
about 7 feet in height, and 12 feet in diameter. It is glazed with 
polished plate glass, in squares measuring about 27 inches each, 
and of the thickness of a quarter of an inch ; and is covered with 
a dome-shaped roof, consisting of an outer and innner shell of 
strong copper, with a space of an inch and a half left between 
them, to prevent condensation in the interior of the roof. With- 
out such precaution, the reflectors are apt to be destroyed by the 
dropping of the water from the roof, especially before the light- 
room has been heated by the lamps. The light is from sperma- 
ceti oil, with argand burners placed in the focus of 12 parabolic 
reflectors of silvered copper. So powerful is the effect of these 
reflectors, that they require to be screened during the day from 
the sun's rays, to prevent the ignition of the lamps. The fittings of 
the reflecting apparatus and light-room generally, together with 
the arrangements of this establishment, are very complete. The 
compact and neat state of the machinery and its brass case, and 
the very simple and complete manner in which the burners are 
withdrawn from the reflectors for the purpose of cleaning them, ~ 
are particularly worthy of notice. The light- room is kept remark- 
ably clean, and not a drop of oil is to be seen on the floor, while 
the roof is entirely free from the effects of condensed water or 
smoke. To distinguish Corswall light from other lights' on the 
coast, the reflectors here are fitted upon an upright shaft and a 
frame or chandelier, constructed with four faces, which are made 
to revolve by a train of machinery. On two of the opposite faces 
of this frame, the light is of the natural appearance, but on the 
other two sides, shades of red glass are placed before the reflec- 
tors. The revolution of this apparatus " exhibits a light resem- 
bling a star of the first magnitude, and one of a brilliant red colour, 
alternately. Each light appears in its brightest state at intervals 
of every two minutes, and gradually becoming less luminous, is 
eclipsed." This characteristic eff"ect, produced by the alternate

red and white light, with intervals of darkness, is similar to the 
light at the Bell Rock, which is so beautifully alluded to in the 
following lines of Sir Walter Scott, written in the Album of that 
edifice, in his visit to it in the year 1814.

" Far in the bosom of the deep, 
On these wild shelves my watch I keep, 
A ruddy gem of changeful light 
Bound on the dusky brow of night : 
The seaman bids my lustre hail. 
And scorns to strike his timorous sail." 

Each of the Northern Light-houses is furnished with a barometer, 
thermometer, and rain-guage, and observations are made upon their 
state every morning and evening, when the results are registered in 
the columns of the returns made every month to the engineer. A 
train of such observations cannot fail to be highly interesting in 
the course of time, when it is considered that the same system is 
observed in all the Northern Light-houses, extending to the Isle of 
Man, the Hebrides, Orkneys, and Zetland Isles, and the eastern 
coast of Scotland. The returns made to the engineer contain also 
an account of the expenditure of oil and other stores, and notice 
of any shipwrecks which occur on the neighbouring coast. There 
are two light-keepers at Corswall, who alternately mount guard 
through the night, keeping watch as on shipboard. The view from 
the light-house tower is extensive and striking; comprehending 
a large tract of the coast of Ireland, terminating in the Fair- Head, 
Rachhn Island, the Mull and Peninsula of Cantire, Ailsa Craig, 
the Isle of Arran, and the Cumbraes. 

III. — Population. 
There is no account of the population of this parish previous 
to 1755, when it was 765 ; in 1796, it was 945. The increase 
from the census in 1821 to that in 1831, which was only 75, was 
in the village of Steuart-town : the rural population had not in- 
creased. The yearly average for the last seven years is, of births, 
50, of deaths, 30, of marriages, 14. The following is a return 
of the present number of persons of different ages in the village,

greater part of the year : Two proprietors of land of the yearly 
value of L. 50 and upwards reside in it always. Of the labouring 
population of the whole parish, nearly one-third are Irish, or de- 
scended of Irish parents. The number of persons who are now, 
or at some period of their lives have been, subject to insanity is 9 ; 
of idiots, 5 ; of deaf and dumb persons, 2. 

Character of the People. — The people are in general sober, in- 
dustrious, and regular in their conduct. The excessive use of 
spirits by many is to be lamented : but this evil does not appear 
to have increased in proportion to the increase of population dur- 
ing the last forty years. Petty thefts are not unfrequent, and 
there is some poaching ; but smuggling, which once existed to 
considerable extent, has long ceased. There has been, especial- 
ly during the last twenty years, a marked improvement in the ha 
bits of living, and the general advancement in the country has 
been fully participated. The people are contented with their cir- 
cumstances, and cheerful. Every winter there is a farmer's ball, 
attended by a very respectable company ; there is also a small 
farmer's ball, a ploughman's ball, and sometimes a sailor's ball. 
The neatness of the appearance of the congregation at church has 
long been noticed by strangers. From the situation of the pa- 
rish, many of the natives become sailors. Their character as sea- 
men is held in estimation ; and in the Regattas at Stranraer for 
the last three years, the Kirkcolm boatmen have always gained 
the prize as rowers.

Agriculture. — 

No. of acres, imperial measure, in the parish, which are either cultivated, or 

occasionally in tillage, . . . . . , 10,384 

No. of acres which have never been cultivated, and remain constantly waste 

or in pasture, including 260 acres of meadow, is about . . 1,261 

These pasture lands are steep banks, some extent of moss, and 
a narrow selvage, extending along the rock-bound shore which 
surrounds the greater part of the parish, consisting of a poor thin 
soil, scarcely covering the rocks. The mosses are at present 
chiefly used for fuel. About 120 acres of moss might be brought 
profitably into cultivation for cropping or meadow ground. Of 
the remaining pasture lands, from their quality and exposure, only 
a few patches could be brought into cultivation. It is conceived 
that the most profitable application of agricultural capital in this 
parish, would be in draining and cultivating in a better manner

WIGTONSIIIRE. 



the lands already in tillage. There is no land in a state of undi- 
vided common. 

Plantations. — There are two old and neglected plantations in 
the western part of the parish. On the east side of it, Mr Car- 
rick Moore has, within the last fifteen years, planted nearly 70 
acres. The sycamore and ash are the most hardy trees in re- 
sisting strong winds. The pinaster is by far the most hardy of 
the fir tribe. It was first planted in this county about seventy 
years ago by the Earl of Galloway, who recommended it as re- 
sisting the sea breeze better than any other tree ; and experience 
has justified his recommendation. The prevailing error in this 
country respecting the management of trees is the idea that the 
exposure renders it necessary to keep them very close. This 
plan is equally fatal to their beauty and health. From the exclu- 
sion of light and air, no lateral branches can grow, and the plan- 
tation assumes the appearance of a clump of leafless poles. 
Whereas, if the plantations were regularly thinned in time, each 
tree would expand its branches laterally, and the excess of upward 
growth would be discouraged. There are young plantations, 
which show with what facility trees will grow here, when sheltered 
from the immediate blast. 

Bent of Land. — The average rent of arable land per acre is 
about 17s. 4d. There are no grazing farms, nor sheep farms. 

Wages. — The general rates of labour are as follows : A plough- 
man receives in money L. 8, 65 stones of meal, 5 bolls of potatoes, 
and a house and yard: a day-labourer Is. 2d. in summer, and Is. 
in winter : a mason 2s. 6d. in summer, and 2s. in winter : a joiner 
2s. per day. 

Live-Stock. — The native cattle are the well known Galloways, 
an . excellent breed, almost entirely black, and without horns. 
They are usually reared to two or three years old, and then sold 
to be fed for the London market. The purest and best Gallo- 
ways in the Rhins district are bred in this parish. 

The introduction of the Ayrshire dairy system into this parish 
above thirty years ago, by Mr James Ralston of Fineview, and the 
details of the management of his dairy, consisting of sixty Kyle 
cows, may be found in the Rev. Mr Smith's General View of the 
Agriculture of Galloway, and in other similar publications. That 
dairy has long ceased, and no dairy so large exists here now ; but 
the low price of Galloway stock has led to the adoption of the 
dairy system in many farms. There are at present thirteen dairies 

4 



KIIIKCOLM. 



117 



of Kyle cows in the parish, the largest having 42 cows, the small- 
est 15 : the total number of cows at these dairies is 357. In 
breeding, however, from this stock, the Galloway bull is always 
used. The cows are renewed by queys brought from Ayrshire. 
The cross of the Ayrshire cow with a Galloway bull is ;found 
to be good. They are generally black, resembling very much 
the Galloways, though their hair is not so long and rough ; and 
they are said to fatten at an earlier age. A bad description of 
cattle has lately been introduced from Ireland into this district. 
They are landed at the neighbouring harbours of Portpatrick and 
Portnessack, and the farmers are tempted by the low prices to 
buy them, but they are not kept as breeding stock. 

Husbandry. — The general character of the husbandry of this 
district is good. Fifty years ago, the greater part of the lands 
were covered with heather and whins. About that time the Earl 
of Galloway, then proprietor of the principal part of the parish, 
granted leases for twenty-one years certain, and the life of the 
tenant if he survived that period. The effect of the tenant having 
this long interest in the lands was very important. The pro- 
prietor got a much higher rent than he had previously received, 
and the tenants were induced to apply an exertion to the improve- 
ment of their farms, that would not otherwise have been called 
forth. The command of shells from banks near the shore in one. 
part of the parish, of shell-sand, and sea -weed on the shores, the 
facility of importing lime, and the rise in the price of farm'pro- 
duce from the year 1796, favoured the exertions created by long 
leases, and enabled the tenants, who were distinguished by their 
intelligence and respectability, not only to fulfil their engagements, 
but to increase their own comforts. They were also early enabled 
to adopt the green crop husbandry, so far as practised in the west 
of Scotland : and they have latterly, with the aid of bone manure, 
introduced a considerable extent of drill-turnip husbandry, for 
which the lands are well adapted. The general rotation of crop- 
ping is, 1. oats; 2d year, oats ; 3d. potatoes and turnips; 4. barley, 
oats, or wheat ; 5. hay and some years pasture ; but in many of 
the best managed farms, no two white crops are now taken in suc- 
cession. The advance in agricultural skill in this district has of 
late been, as over all the west of Scotland, very considerable ; but 
It IS some time before the prejudices in favour of old systems pass, 
altogether away. 71ie principal obstacle to fartlier improvement 
is the climate; but it is conceived that broad belts of plantations 



118 



WIGTONSHIRE. 



judiciously planted on the western side of tlie peninsula, would 
have, in course of time, a most important effect in ameliorating the 
climate of this district. The value of the adjoining lands would 
thus be materially increased. Irrigation is not practised here. 
The general subsoil is an open rock or gravel ; and spring or 
deep draining is more generally applicable than shallow or fre- 
quent draining: much, however, of both is wanted. Though 
there are no hills of considerable elevation, the surface is very ir- 
regular ; the bogs or deep soil at the bottom of declivities are 
often wet ; on such land, deep draining would be very profitable. 
From the present agricultural spirit both in proprietors and te- 
nants, considerable improvement by draining may be expected. 
The general duration of leases is nineteen years ; a period suffi- 
cient for the encouragement of the tenant. The usual entry to 
the houses and grass is at Whitsunday, the outgoing tenant hav- 
ing the crop of that year. The first half-year's rent being paya- 
ble at Martinmas, makes a hard entry to the tenant, and in a 
country where agricultural capital is scarce, is a bar to improve- 
ment. The farm-buildings are in general substantially built, and 
comfortable. The fences are usually stone dikes; but within 
the last few years hedges have been planted on some farms, and 
the tenants seem fully sensible of the benefit to be derived from 
them. Inconvenience is felt by the tenants in the north-east 
quarter of the parish from the want of a harbour or landing-place, 
for receiving and exporting produce. The erection of a small 
landing place in Lady Bay would be of great utiUty to the neigh- 
bouring farmers. 

Produce. — It is difficult to estimate accurately the gross pro- 
duce of the parish. The following is a rough estimate, from the 
extent of the parish, and supposed average produce per acre : 

Produce of grain of all kinds, about L. 8800 

Potatoes, turnips, &amp;c. - 3000 

Hay, whether meadow or cultivated, 1800 

Land in pasture, - - 6000 

L. 19,600 

Fisheries. — About eighty years ago, there was a great herring 
fishery in Loch Ryan. Since that time, and especially during the 
last twenty years, the herring fishery has not, excepting a year now 
and then, been very productive. Herrings, however, visit the 
Loch every year ; and every year are more or less beneficial to this 
parish. The quantity of white fish in the loch, has, upon the 
whole, decreased. Haddocks, which about twenty-five years ago 



KIRKCOLM. 



119 



were in great quantity, and of excellent quality, are now rare , 
while the quantity of small whitings is much greater than former- 
ly. Small cod, and in the beginning of the year, large cod, are 
still sometimes caught in abundance ; and the price of such fish 
has never exceeded a penny a pound. Though the quantity of 
fish in the loch has decreased, the quantity in the sea adjoining, 
appears to continue the same ; and if the fishermen here had ca- 
pital sufficient to provide smacks of ten tons burden or more, and 
were thus enabled to go out and fish in the open sea, such fishing, 
it is conceived, might, from the numbers of fish, and the facility of 
going to market, become very profitable. There are oysters in 
Loch Ryan of the best quality. Sir Alexander Wallace, a pro- 
prietor on the opposite coast of the loch, has, by Royal Charter, 
an exclusive right to them. The fishermen of the village of Stew- 
artown pay him a rent of L. 20 a-year for the oysters they can 
gather on the Scar, the sand-bank already mentioned. The fisher- 
men who pay him for leave to dredge for oysters, belong to other 
parishes. Crabs and lobsters, which were known to be obtainable 
at the mouth of Loch Ryan, were neglected by the fishermen 
here. Within the last few years, fishermen from the opposite 
coast of Ayrshire, and from Ireland, have had much success in 
catching them, and have found a ready market at Glasgow, Bel- 
fast, and Dublin. In the latter city, they at one time received 
3s. 6d. for each lobster. This encouragement tempted them to 
fish at improper seasons, during the time of spawning ; and the 
result was a great falling off in the quantity caught. It is hoped 
that this imprudence will not occur again, and that the catching 
of lobsters may yet become a source of profit to the native fisher- 
men. 

Manufactures, — The only thing worth mentioning under this 
head is, that in almost every house in the village, and indeed 
through the parish generally, young women are much employed 
in embroidering muslin webs, obtained from Glasgow or Ayrshire. 
By embroidering they earn, according to their expertness, and 
the time they can devote to this work, from 8d. to Is. 3d. a day, 
and sometimes more. 

Navigation. — There are at present three small vessels belong- 
ing to this parish, under 40 tons burden, employed in the coasting 
trade.

Ecclesiastical State.~The parish church is placed, not in the

centre of the parish, but at one side of it, about half a-mile from 
Loch Ryan, equidistant from the north and south ends of the pa- 
rish, and near the village of Stewartown. A great majority of 
the population are within three miles of it : few houses are more 
than four miles from it. It was built thirteen years ago, was 
very substantially executed, and is in good repair. It was calcu- 
lated by measurement to accommodate 650 persons ; it has no gal- 
leries. If three galleries were erected, which the plan admits, it 
would accommodate 300 more ; but the accommodation originally 
provided has as yet been sufficient. The feuars in the village 
have no property in the kirk : seventy sittings were reserved for 
them by the heritors, which are let to them at Is. 3d. each sitting, 
and the proceeds go to the poor's funds. Besides those thus ac- 
commodated, many of the villagers have sittings in the kirk as 
small tenants, or as farm-servants. There are a few free sittings. 
It is believed that every person desirous to have a sitting in the 
kirk can obtain it somewhere. The want of a sitting is an excuse 
for not attending church, made very rarely : the want of decent 
clothes in a parish where so large a proportion of the population 
are Irish, is an excuse made very often, and with too much truth. 
Divine service is in general well attended. The number of com- 
municants at the Established Church is 450. The manse was 
built above thirty years ago, and is in good repair ; the offices are 
bad. The glebe is in extent 10 acres. It might be let for about 
L. 15. The stipend is 15 chalders, half barley, half oatmeal 
and L. 8, 6s. 8d. element money. There are no Dissenting cha- 
pels ; the Dissenters go to the Dissenting meeting-houses of their 
several persuasions in Stranraer. There are forty famiUes of Dis- 
senters. They belong chiefly to the two congregations of the 
United Secession, and to the Reformed Presbyterian congrega- 
tion ; a few belong to the Relief congregation. Heads of families 
professing themselves to be Dissenters, their children of all ages 
who have not conformed to the Established Church, a few indi- 
viduals who live alone, a few who live in families that are not 
Dissenters, and those families of poor Catholics, make a total of 
191 persons not belonging to the Estabhshed Church. 

Education. — There is one parochial school : there are' at pre- 
sent three unendowed schools ; sometimes there are more. The 
branches of instruction generally taught in them are, reading and 
writing, English grammar, arithmetic, book-keeping, mensuration, 
and navigation ; Latin is also taught in the parochial school. 



KIRKCOLM. 



121 



The parish school-house is placed, not near the kirk, but about 
afnile from it, in the interior of the parish, so as to accommodate 
the existing population as well as one school-house could do. The 
schoolmaster's salary is L. 27, with the legal accommodations of 
dwelling-house and garden ; the school fees he actually receives 
for all schoolmasters here lose by bad payments average from 
L. 15 to L. 18 a-year. The other schools are supported wholly 
by the school fees. The fees at all the schools are the same. 
The general expense of education is Is. a month. No part of the 
parish is more than four miles distant from the parochial school. 
The people are generally much alive to the benefits of education. 
Children usually enter school about six years of age. There are 
few young persons under fifteen years of age who cannot read and 
write ; but there are Irish labourers in the parish who can neither 
read nor write. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of poor re- 
ceiving parish aid is 60. Of these 20 receive, at the stated times 
for dividing the poor's money, 16s. each, the remaining 40, 12s, 
each, per annum : but some of both classes, in addition to these 
sums, receive, when necessary, additional relief. The times of di- 
viding the poor's money are Whitsunday and Martinmas, and 
after the sacrament, when what has been collected on that occa- 
sion is distributed. Sometimes two of the aliments above men- 
tioned go to one family ; as to husband and wife, to mother and 
daughter ; or to two sisters, or to any two paupers living together. 
The parish poor are persons of advanced age or of infirm healthy 
or widows. By far the greater part' of them are able to do more 
or less for their own support, and willing to do what they can. A 
few of them go about begging within the parish, but seldom else- 
where. Many of them receive assistance from their friends, or 
from other charitable persons, chiefly from the farmers on whose 
lands they live, or in whose service they have been. The ali- 
ments given from the poor's funds are small ; but to a person in 
a state of general indigence 16s., or even 12s. a year, to assist in 
paying house rent, or in buying meal or potatoes, is felt to be a 
great relief; and certainly there is now very rarely any reluctance 
in applying for it. The funds for the relief of the parish poor 
are, at an average, about L. 40 per annum, from collections in the 
church, and about L. 1 6 from other sources : making a total of 
L. 56: which, after deduction of L. 6, 10s. paid to the session- 
clerk, precentor, and kirk-officer, and to the clerks and officers of 



WIGTONSHIRE. ' 

the presbytery and synod, of a donation of L. 1 to the Dumfries and 
Galloway Infirmary, and of about L. 3, 7s. paid for coffins for the 
poor, leaves to be divided yearly among the poor about L. 45, 3s. 
There never has been any compulsory assessment here : a voluntary 
assessment, which in some years has amounted to L. 30, but has 
niore frequently been under L. 20, is paid by the heritors, to pro- 
vide for cases different from general indigence. Such are cases of 
poor persons completely disabled by disease, or accident, lunatics 
or idiots, who have no funds of their own, and whose friends are 
unable to provide for their children that have fallen to be supported 
by the parish, and aged persons left destitute, and unable to take 
care of themselves. 

FueL—Feats are the ordinary fuel in this district. In places 
near the Bay of Loch Ryan, some coals brought from Ayrshire 
are also used. 

Ale-houses.~Theve are four houses licensed to sell ale and 
spirits : they are all in the village. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

In addition to what has been mentioned under the heads of po- 
pulation and agriculture, to shew the difference betwixt the pre- 
sent state of the parish, and that which existed at the time of the 
former Statistical Account, the following fact may be noticed, as 
sufficiently indicating the general progress : When the former Sta- 
tistical Account was drawn up, there was only one slated farm- 
house ; now, on all the considerable farms, in number about 40, 
the farm-houses are slated, and in general are handsomely fur- 
nished. Their offices are for the most part slated also. 

From the neighbouring port of Stranraer, the farmers here have 
the advantage of communication by steam-boats with Glasgow and 
Belfast, and sometimes with Whitehaven and Liverpool. The parish 
roads, however, in some parts of the interior, and in the south- 
west quarter generally, are still very bad.

PRESBYTERY OF STRANRAER, SYNOB OF GALLOWAY. 

THE REV. ANDREW M'CUBBIN, MINISTER. 

L— Topography and Natural History. 

Jame. — Leswalt signifies the meadow along the burn. The 
rivulet, on the bank of which stands the old church, takes its rise 
out of a large moss of nearly 1000 acres, and forms a beautiful 
cascade where it enters the romantic glen of Altdowran, which sig- 
nifies the Otter's Burn. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish is bounded on the east, by 
the Irish Channel ; on the west, by Lochryan ; on the north, by 
Kirkcolm parish ; and on the south, by Portpatrick. It is nearly 
8 square miles. 

Topographical Appearances. — This parish is very hilly, and there 
are large tracts of moss in the upper district. They abound in 
grouse and black game. There are many fine meadows and rich 
pasture grounds. The meadow which gives name to the pa- 
rish is now cultivated, and produces very fine wheat crops. That 
part of the parish next Lochryan is partly flat ; but the greater 
part is hilly, and for four miles the soil is very fine, and produces 
crops of all kinds, which return very fair profits to the farmers. 
The part lying along Lochryan has many advantages : vessels 
lie in great safety in Soleburn Bay. They import lime from Ire- 
land, and sometimes shells ; and along the coast, the shell sand 
has been of real advantage to those who have used it, particular- 
ly upon damp soils. Towards the south the ground is more adapt- 
ed for pasture than cultivation. It is wet, hilly, and interspersed 
with tracts of moss. Yet of late years, this side of the parish has 
undergone a great change. The coarse kind has been limed, and 
rewarded the farmers for their hard labour. The push-plough has 
been successfully used upon the unequal soils ; and when the sod is 
burnt, and the ashes spread upon the soil with lime, there are 



124 



WIGTONSHIRE. 



many instances of seven oi- eight seeds in return. Towards the 
west, upon the Irish Channel, some parts are fertile, but generally 
the ground is of a barren nature, and abounds very much in a 
sandy soil alongst the coast. Large tracts are kept solely for sheep 
and young cattle. The coast presents awful chasms of broken 
rocks, as if some convulsion of nature had torn them asunder. 
Alongst this coast, there is not one safe harbour; although, at no' 
considerable expense, one might be formed at the bay called Salt- 
pan, which would be of mighty advantage for this part of the pa- 
rish. Since the present incumbent came to the parish, the salt- 
pan was in operation, and produced very excellent salt from sea 
water. 

Along the coast, which extends about eight miles, there are 
excellent fish, particularly cod ; but no fishing station. The fish- 
ermen from Portpatrick scruple not to come along the coast and 
take the fine red cod. 

The middle of the parishhas of late been mightilv improved, be- 
ing at no great distance from Lochryan, and lime easily obtained at 
Soleburn about Is. 4d. per barrel. A fine road passes through the 
parish about the centre, and sweeps round Lochnaw, and passes on 
to Portpatrick, and another branch turns to the north, and passes 
alongst the north of Kirkcolm parish, and terminates at Stranraer. 
Sir Andrew Agnew, who succeeded his grandfather. Sir Stair 
Agnew, in 1809, has improved the face of the lands around his 
castle in a very tasteful manner. Every stranger considers him- 
self highly gratified with the prospect about Lochnaw. 

Climate.—This parish being situated along the Irish Chan- 
nel, the weather is very changeable, and dreadful storms visit it, 
particularly from the west. At certain periods, a creeping mist, 
assuming various forms, approaches from the Atlantic. Sometimes 
this presages a long tract of dry weather, and at other times, rain 
in abundance. 

There is a high wooded hill above Lochnaw Castle ; 
Take care when Lady Craigh hill puts on her mantle. 
The Lady looks high and knows what is coming ; 
Delay not one moment to get under covering. 

Although the climate is moist, few parishes can produce instances 
of longevity similar to what occur here. The beadle died a few years 
ago, aged one hundred and two years, and his wife eighty-two. 
Some are living at the advanced ages of ninety-six, eighty-six, and 
eighty-seven years. , The people are generally of a very healthy 



i 



LESWALT. 



125 



and sound constitution, and the labouring classes can perform a 
very fair day's work at seventy years of age. 

Hydrograp1iy.—T\\e only loch worthy of notice is Lochnaw, 
which signifies " the loch with the ford." One of the knights, a 
Sir James, drained this fine loch in order to have a meadow. The 
late Sir Stair often said, that some of his successors would again 
throw it into a lake, which prophecy has been fulfilled by Sir An- 
drew Agnew, the present proprietor. The water covers above 
thirty acres of land, and, at the end next Lochnaw Castle, is of 
considerable depth. Nothing can exceed the beauty of the scenery 
around this loch, and many strangers come to behold it. There 
are no rivers in this parish, but two considerable burns, viz. Sole- 
burn and Pooltanton. The former empties itself into Lochryan, 
having an eastern course ; the latter runs south, and empties itself 
into the Bay of Luce, after a course of ten miles. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — -There are no mines in the parish. 
The greywacke, called erroneously whinstone, is the common stone 
found, and some quarries thereof are of a beautiful texture and ap- 
pearance. The new addition to Lochnaw, lately finished, has 
been built of this stone. There are also quarries of red sand- 
stone. 

Zoology.' — This parish was famed, informer times, for goat- whey ; 
but it is now very rare to meet with one of these animals. Salmon 
come up the two burns before-mentioned, during the first flood in 
the month of August, or early in September, for spawning, and 
they return when the frost commences. The Bay of Lochryan is 
famed for oysters, which, at low water, are gathered in abundance 
along the shore. 

Plantations. — The only plantations are about Lochnaw Castle; 
some of the trees are very old, but none remarkable for size. The 
fir, the ash, the sycamore, and beech, are all in a very thriving state. 
The greater part have been planted, within these thirty years, by 
Sir Andrew Agnew. 

IL — Civil History. 
Leswalt belonged to the monks of Tongland in the reign of 
James V. The vicarage was taxed L. 12, 13s. 4d., being a tenth 
of the estimated value. At the Reformation, the tax was L. 26, 
13s. 4d. In 1587, the church was vested in the King, and re- 
turned to the Bishops of Galloway, by a grant from the King in 
1689. On the abolition of Episcopacy, it was vested in the Crown.

WIGTONSHIRE. 



Land-oivners. — There are four principal heritors in this parish : 
The Right Honourable the Earl of Stair; Sir Andrew Agnew, Bart, 
of Lochnaw ; Colonel Vans Agnew, Esq. of Sheuehan ; and the 
Rev. David Wilson, Stranraer. There are four other proprie- 
tors who pay a small part of the stipend. Sir Andrew Agnew is 
the principal heritor, and the only residing heritor. 

Modern Buildings. — Lochnaw Castle is the only considerable 
building in the parish. It is built on an elevated hill, and appears 
to have been intended for a place of defence. Towards the south, 
traces of a deep fosse may still be seen, and on the north it is de-

contains about 800 people.

Charade' of the People. — The people in general live in a very 
comfortable manner, and have of late improved much both in lan- 
guage and manners. They have a strong sense of religion, and 
their conduct becomes their profession. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Economy. — It is impossible to say what 
number of acres are under tillage, as the land has not been mea- 
sured. It may, however, be stated, that a very considerable quan- 
tity of land has of late years been under tillage, which before was 
never cultivated. When that coarse land is limed and laid under 
summer fallow, eight or ten seeds are generally produced. There 

3 



. LESVVALr. 127 

are very considerable tracts of land wholly in pasture, and very 
little probability that these will ever reward the farmer by tillage. 

Rent of Land. — There are no grounds in undivided common in 
the parish, but the whole is laid out in farms. Some of these rent 
at L. 200 Sterling per annum, and upwards. The rent of some 
parts of the parish per acre is as high as L. 3 per annum ; and L. 2 
per acre is common. Farms let on a lease of nineteen years may 
average about L. 1 per acre. The common rate for grazing a cow 
or ox for the year is about L. 3, 10s. ; a ewe, 5s. 

Wages. — The common rate for a farm-servant is L. 10 per an- 
num with victuals ; a maid-servant L. 4, 4s. ; meal per stone may 
be said to average 2s. 6d. per stone, potatoes lOd. per bushel ; 
a mason or carpenter 2s. per day with victuals. 

Live-Siock. — The breed of cattle being Galloways, they are well 
known and much sought after. Large droves are annually sent to 
England, which bring fair prices. The sheep are various ; the 
Cheviot, the black-faced and various mixed breeds, — all of which 
reward the farmer, perhaps, better than black-cattle. 

The general duration of leases is nineteen years, but there are 
some life tacks. The farm-houses are all good, and well adapted 
for their respective purposes ; and the fences have, of late years, 
been greatly improved, and add very much to the beauty of the 
country. 

Produce. — There are raised in the parish about 4000 Gal- 
loway bolls of oats, average value about L. 6000. Wheat has 
been of late cultivated ; but what the real amount is cannot 
be ascertained ; average price per bushel, 6s. There are rais- 
ed about 2000 bolls of potatoes annually ; average price about 
13s. 4d. 

V. — -'Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town. — No market-town in the parish, but one in 
Stranraer, which is in the neighbourhood. The post-office is in 
Stranraer. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church, built in J 828, stands 
in a very convenient situation for the parishioners, and is about 
eight miles from the farthest extremities of the parish, and aflPords 
accommodation for 800 sitters. No free sittings. 

The manse was built in 1811. The glebe contains nearly 20 
acres ; value about L. 30 annually. The stipend is the minimum. 
The only other place of worship in the parish is a parochial

WIGTONSHIUE. 



preaching station in the suburb adjoining to Stranraer, where a 
district church is about to be erected. The church is well at- 
tended, and the number of communicants about 400. The 
church collections and other donations average about L. 40 an- 
nually. 

The number of families attending the Established Church is 
41 1 ; of families attending chapels of Dissenters or Seceders, 111; 
of Roman Catholic families, 17. 

Education. — There are, at present, four schools in the parish, 
the parochial and three private. The parochial schoolmaster has 

the minimum salary, a house and garden, and the school fees, 

the amount of which I cannot ascertain. There are no children 
in the parish so distant but they may attend some of the schools ; 
and there are none belonging to the parish who cannot both read 
and write, as the parents, in general, seem anxious to have their 
children educated. About 200 children attend the Sabbalh even- 
ing schools. 

Library. — There is a parochial library, which contains nearly 
400 volumes, and the people have a taste for reading. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of poor re- 
ceiving aid is about 60, eleven of whom receive on an average per 
annum, L. 6. The rest of the paupers receive parochial aid from 
the church collections, which amount to betwixt L. 50 and L. 60. 
There are no legal assessments : but contributions are voluntarily 
made by the heritors. The poor have also the interest of L. 200 
left by the late Earl of Stair. The greater part of the poor, be- 
ing Irish, are very frequent and importunate in their demands. 

Inns. — There are six inns or ale-houses in the parish. 

Fuel. — Both coal and turf are used as fuel in the parish. A 
cart load of turf costs 2s. ; coals, 15s. per ton.

PRESBYTERY OF STRANRAER, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY. 

THE REV. ANDREW URQUHART, A. M. MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name of the Parish. — The lands which at present constitute 
the parish of Portpatrick were formerly called the Black Quarter 
of the Inch, and till 1628, formed a part of the parish of Inch, 
having pertained to the ancient Abbacy of Saulset or Soulseat. 
For some time before and after this date, the harbour and adjoin- 
ing village were very commonly called Portmontgomery, in ho- 
nour of the Montgomeries, Lords of Ardes in Ireland, who were 
the proprietors for a considerable period. But when the parish 
was erected, it received the ancient name of the harbour, which 
it has ever since retained, and which has completely superseded 
the name of Portmontgomery. A marvellous story used to be 
told here of the famous Irish Saint Patrick having crossed the 
channel at a single stride, and the mark of his foot was shown on 
a rock, that has been removed in the operations connected with the 
construction of the present harbour. Whether this superstition is 
of Scotch or Irish origin does not appear ; but it is probably con- 
nected with some historical fact, and with the origin of the name 
Portpatrick. Another story, undoubtedly Irish, bears that St 
Patrick, having been beheaded somewhere north of Glenap, took 
his head under his arm, and walked to Portpatrick, where, being 
unable to find a boat, he took his head in his teeth and swam across 
to Ireland. 

Boundaries. — The parish occupies about four miles of the coast 
of the Irish Channel, rather nearer the northern than the southern 
extremity of the peninsula, which, extending from north north-west 
to south south-east, about 28 miles in length, and 5 in its great- 
est breadth, and containing the parishes of Kirkcolm, Leswalt, 
Portpatrick, Stonykirk, and Kirkmaiden, is joined to the mainland, 

WIGTON. T 



130 



WIGTONSHIRE. 



a little northward of its middle, by an isthmus 6 miles in breadth, 
formed by Loch- Ryan on the north, and the Bay of Luce on the 
south. Towards this isthmus, the parish of Portpatrick stretches 
about 4 miles from its western shore. It contains about 18 
square miles, and exhibits an outhne of four sides, of which that 
towards the east is nearly parallel to the opposite side, bounded 
by the sea on the west. The only natural boundary between this 
and the adjoining parishes is a small stream called the Piltanton 
burn, separating it on the east from the parishes of Leswalt and 
Inch. It is separated from Leswalt on the north-west, and from 
Stonykirk on the south-east, by stone dikes, ditches, and other 
enclosures of the boundary farms. 

Topographical Appearances 8fc. — The surface of the whole pa- 
rish is elevated. From the coastto the distance of about three miles, 
where it reaches its greatest elevation, it is irregularly undulated, 
exhibiting almost no entirely level ground, except in a few places 
where there is peat moss, the subsoil of which has probably the 
same slopes as the adjacent hills. The slopes are generally gra- 
dual, and in few places are so steep as to hinder the use of the 
plough : but on many of them, especially the more elevated, the 
rock frequently shows itself uncovered. The hills are mostly flat. 
Some of them have assumed a form approaching to conical. The 
higher and more remarkable ones are called the Fells of the farms 
to which they respectively belong, with the exception of one to- 
wards the south-east of the parish, which is called Cairnpat, and 
sometimes Cairnpiot. This hill is the highest in the whole peninsula. 
Here the eastern part of the parish may be seen, sloping down rapidly 
to the Piltanton burn, with a surface generally irregular, and towards 
the north exceedingly rough and broken with the projecting rock. 
From the summit of the hill, in clear weather, we may command 
an extensive prospect on all sides. Northward our view extends 
to the hills and mountains of Argyleshire and of Arran. The 
majestic blue rocks of Ailsa appear surrounded by the sea be- 
tween them and the nearer view of the beautiful Loch-Ryan, which 
opens towards them between the bold hills of its eastern shore 
and the more gently sloping fields of Kirkcolm, and Leswalt, and 
sends back its quiet waves to the level shores of Stranraer. Turn- 
ing eastward, our eye is caught by the distant blue mountains of 
Kirkcudbright, seen over the wild but less elevated country beyond 
Gleniuce, and then descends on the_almost level plain, about five 



PORTPATIIICK.

\m\es in breadth, and stretching six miles in length between Loch- 
Ryan and the wide open Bay of Luce. This tract of country is 
beautified by stripes and masses of plantation chiefly belonging to 
the Earl of Stair. It is enlivened by the near view of Stranraer, 
immediately under ourleft, at the nearest angle of Loch-Ryan,— by 
a peep of Castle Kennedy and its lakes, about a mile inland from 
the more remote angle, — by the small village of Lochans, imme- 
diately below,— and by the parish church of Stonykirk, near to the 
bay of Luce, and seen over the plantations of Garthland to our 
right. Whether the English coast of Cumberland can be seen 
under a clear sky in the horizon beyond the Bay of Luce is doubt- 
ful ; but several curious black rocks rise distinctly from the sea 
in the distance. To the right, the southern limit of the peninsula 
stretches out from below us, in a long narrow but hilly stripe to 
the Mull of Galloway, over which, and extending to the east and 
west of it, the high mountains of the Isle of Man appear. As we 
continue our survey towards the right and look westward, the very 
beautiful panorama is completed by the Irish Channel, with the 
Irish coast seen extending for seventy miles on the farther side, and 
varied by the Mourne mountains to the south, by the lower lying 
lands of Downshire, and the town of Donaghadee right opposite 
to us, and by the bold continuous mass of the Antrim hills, stretch- 
ing to the north. The fore-ground of this view is the wildest part 
of Portpatrick parish. The high ground, which dips abruptly close 
to the shore, conceals the harbour and the town. Any one, who 
desires to obtain a correct idea of the geography of the parish, and 
of the Rhins of Galloway, and, at the same time, to enjoy a pleasant 
prospect, ought not to omit, when the weather is clear, to visit the 
top of Cairnpat, which is not half a mile from the turnpike road 
leading from Portpatrick to Stranraer. 

The Coast, 8fc. — Along the whole line of sea coast included in 
this parish, rugged rocks and cliffs commonly called heuffhs, 
rise abruptly from deep water, and are, in some places, perpendi- 
cular to the height of 130 feet. Down the less precipitous of these, 
very young children often scramble to perilous fishing seats, which 
they select according to the time of the tide, and which have been 
long known by names, such as Slogan a glassin, Greggary, Eilena 
garroch, Catevennan, Catelig, Ringwee, Eilafitz, Slogan a baa, 
&amp;c. In front of the cliffs, and opening in deep water, are seve- 
ral caves or vaulted fissures, but of no great extent, in which wild 



132 



WIGTONSHIllE. 



pigeons, jackdaws, &amp;c. build their nests. There is no beach ex- 
cept in four or five small bays, which are accessible from the land, 
the hills sloping back from them. In one of these, which is very 
rocky, and dangerous for shipwrecks, and is named Morroch Bay, 
the southern boundary of the parish meets the sea : and the north- 
ern boundary terminates in another, called Killantringan Bay, 
which is sandy, and enclosed by beautiful and bold green hills. 
The bay in which is the harbour of Portpatrick is nearly equally 
distant from both of these. High cliffs approach close to it on 
both sides, and, receding from the shore, are lost in steep hills of 
earth. These, gradually approaching towards each other, enclose 
the space on which the town is built, and at length form the banks 
of a small stream, along which the turnpike road leads by a mode- 
rate ascent towards Stranraer. Along the line of this road the 
newest street extends for about 350 yards down to the harbour, 
opening nearly on the centre of the basin, and passing on its right 
the church, manse, and church-yard. Another street, nearly equal- 
ly divided by the former,'and built with a slight curve, looks on the 
harbour. A few other small streets fill up the angles formed by 
these. The whole appearance of the place, when it is viewed from 
the heights on the south side, or from the sea, suggests the idea of 
a town built in a large quarry ; a considerable space of ground on 
the north side being occupied as a hewing field for the harbour 
works, and at present covered with enormous blocks of stone. 
About a quarter of a mile to the south of the harbour, and seen 
from the projecting pier head, are the ruins of the old Castle of 
Dunskey, situated on the summit of the rocky steep, about 90 or 
1 00 feet above the level of the sea. A deep chasm renders the 
castle nearly inaccessible on the side nearest the harbour. On - 
the opposite side the rock is quite perpendicular, and overlooks a 
small bay, called the Castle Bay. At the base of the rock on this 
side, and directly under the castle, is a cave, accessible at half-tide, 
the dark rugged entrance of which adds to the wildness of the im- 
posing cliff crested by the ruins. About the same distance to 
the north of the harbour, are two small bays separated by a small 
promontory of table-land, and remarkable for the difference of 
their strand : for though they are so close that it might be sup- 
posed the tide would alternately wash the contents of the one into 
the other, the one, nearest Portpatrick, called Portmurray, contains 
only pure yellow sand, whence it is called also the Sandy Bay, or 



PORTPATIUCK. 



133 



the Sand-eel-Bay, whilst the other, called Port Kale, contams only 
coarse gravel, the debris of the neighbouring rocks, which are blue 
whinstone. In the rocky side of the sandy bay, beyond the reach 
of the tide, is a cave obscurely reported to have been the residence 
of a hermit or monk. Adjoining to it is a smaller cave, over the 
entrance of which a small rill constantly pours itself. If the in- 
dulgence of bathing had been permitted to the hermit, he might 
here have enjoyed the benefit of a shower-bath with a dressing 
room, besides the excellent plunge bath in the bay. The banks 
of a small stream which enters the other bay form a small glen, 
the most picturesque in Galloway, through which walks, very taste- 
fully cut, lead past a very pretty wild waterfall, and connect the 
two bays with the present mansion-house of Dunskey, situated about 
a mile distant on the height. 

Meteorology. — The range of the thermometer is less by several 
degrees in the town than in the higher grounds ; and the tempe- 
rature of the parish, generally, is reckoned to be neither so hot in 
summer, nor so cold in winter, as that of the inland parishes ; but 
no accurate register is kept either of the barometer or thermo- 
meter. 

Occasionally dense fogs cover the channel of the coast, espe- 
cially in the months of May and September or October. They 
usually come from the sea with the south-west wind, and seldom 
last above a few hours at most ; fi'equently not more than a quar- 
ter of an hour. 

The prevailing winds vary from south to west. Those which 
raise the heaviest seas are from the south-west. It is considered 
a favourable sign of the weather, when the light breezes of sum- 
mer change during the day, followed by the sun. 

The climate is generally moist ; and hence cold is often felt in 
a greater degree than is indicated by the thermometer. Upon 
the whole, it is a healthful climate; if we may judge from the ro- 
bustness of the population, notwithstanding poor living and much 
exposure to the weather. But rheumatism, dyspepsia, consump- 
tion, fevers, and cancers are not unfrequent. Vegetation is slow 
in the early spring, but rapid in summer, so that the harvests are 
usually completed about the middle of October. But in Novem- 
ber, the young shoots of trees are often found unprepared for the 
storms which bedew them with spray from the sea, and cause them 
to die from the top to a considerable length down. 



l" WIGTONSHIRE. 

Hydrogrophy.—Tha sea, receiving but a scanty tribute of fresh 
water from the narrow peninsula, is very salt all along the shore. 
The depth close to the rocks is from five to six fathoms. Oppo- 
site Old Dunskey Castle, a bank of clay and gravel runs out for 
about three miles into the channel. On this bank, near the extre- 
mity, the depth of water is from 25 to 30 fathoms, whilst a mile 
north and south of this it is 50 fathoms. The deepest part of 
the channel opposite to Portpatrick is between 6 and 7 miles from 
the Scotch coast. From the greatest depth, about 90 fathoms, 
the water shoals gradually towards the coast of Ireland. Accord- 
ing to the tide-table in the New Edinburgh Almanack, the tkies 
at Portpatrick are 3 hours and 20 minutes later than at Leith. 
They are reckoned about an hour earlier than at Stranraer. But 
near the shore they are from an hour to an hour and a half earlier 
than a mile off, and they are generally reckoned an hour later 
than at the opposite port of Donaghadee. Spring-tides rise from 
14 to 17 feet, and neap-tides from 8 to 11 feet. The currents 
near the shore often run more than 3 miles an hour. South-east 
of the Copland Island, near the Irish coast, there are strong and 
ever-varying currents, on which the most experienced fishermen 
cannot calculate with certainty, and which they cannot explain. 
It is to this place that the Statistical Account of 1791, thus 
refers : " Within three or four miles of the Irish shore, when the 
flood returns, there is a regular current, which sets off strongly 
for the Mull of Galloway. It runs at the rate of seven knots an 
hour, and is so forcible, that when the wind opposes it, it exhibits 
for a great way the appearance of breakers. It is called the Race 
of Strangers, and is a very curious spectacle." 

On the south side of the town, there is a spring of strong chaly- 
beate water, which flows at all seasons in a small but regular stream 
from the rock. It is much esteemed by the people for its medi- 
cinal virtue. There is no natural lake in the parish : but one of 
four acres in extent has been recently formed north of the Fell, 
which rises behind the mansion-house of Dunskey. This artifi- 
cial lake has been stocked with trout, chiefly from a small stream 
in the parish called Craigoch-burn. It is of an irregular form. 
The banks are quite bare, but are being tastefully planted by the 
proprietor, by whom a carriage drive has also been lately formed 
along the margin and leading from the house with a wide sweep 
round the hill. This carriage drive, as it passes round the west 
side of the hill, crosses the walks leading from the mansion house 



PORTPATRICK. 



135 



to the glen formerly mentioned, with its waterfall. This water- 
fall is formed by a small stream called Auchtrematane burn. 
When this stream is swollen with rains, it pours a copious tor- 
rent over rugged rocks into a narrow ravine, about 50 or 60 feet 
deep, whence it flows with a peaceful current for a quarter of a 
mile along the bottom of the glen, which opens on Port Kale Bay. 
The scenery about this cascade and from it to the sea is exceed- 
ingly fine. The rugged rocks near the waterfall are enriched with 
furze and heath, or overrun with ivy and honeysuckle ; and the 
boldly sloping sides of the glen are well covered with thrivmg 
wood. 

The streams in this parish are all very small and rapid. They 
are generally named from the principal farms through which they 
pass. Their whole length lies within the parish, with the excep- 
tion of the Piltanton-burn, forming the eastern boundary of the 
parish, and running thence for about six miles into the Bay of 
Luce. 

Geology and Mineralogy.— It is impossible to say what is the ge- 
neral direction and dip of the strata of rock on the coast. In the 
cliffs north of the harbour, it may be said to be most commonly 
north -west, and to the south of the harbour south-east. In ge- 
neral the strata are very much inclined to the plane of the hori- 
zon, and in some cases almost perpendicular. All the rocks 
in this parish are understood to iDelong to the transition class. 
They become more slaty towards the southern boundary, but not 
so much so as on adjoining coast of Stonykirk parish, from which 
slates have been cut for the roofing of houses. On the strand of 
a small bay, near the northern boundary, a stratum almost perpen- 
dicular shows itself, composed of a transition rock. No. 1,  with 
frequently intersecting small veins of No. 1, a, calcspar. The sub- 
stance of the ordinary strata along the coast is represented by No. 
2, a variety of greywacke, strata of which, varying from one to five 
or six feet, frequently alternate with others of nearly the same sub- 
stance, but thin and of a more slaty appearance. 

In the Morroch Bay, at the southern boundary of the parish, 
the following strata, of from 20 to 30 feet in thickness, and near- 
ly perpendicular, but dipping towards the south-east, succeed one 
another from north to south, in the order of the numbers, and se- 
parated by strata of greywacke. No. 2, about the same thickness ; 
No. 3, greywacke slate ; No. 4, greywacke ; No. 5, transition 

" The numbers refer to the collection of specimens in our possession. 



136 



WIGTONSHIRE. 



clay slate ; No. 6, coarse alum slate ; No. 7, coarse alum slate ; 
No. 8, decomposed greywacke ; No. 9, Lydian stone; No. 10, 
coarse alum slate ; No. 11, clay slate of various tints, as greenish- 
grey, purple, and reddish-brown. Beside No. 6, on the shore, is 
a fixed mass of No. 6 a, which appears to be decayed greywacke, 
m Nos, 7, and 10, masses of No. 7 a, which is common iron py- 
rites, about the size of a man's hand, are frequently found. Along- 
side of No. 1 1, and at the height of 100 feet up in the face of the 
cliff, there is a stratum of No. 11 a, of a decomposed rock. No- 
dules of coarse jasper and agate, quartz in nodules and layers, and 
thin veins of carbonate of lime, are found not unfrequently in the 
rocks. No organic remains have hitherto been found. 

The soil in the parish is in some places pure brown earth, ge- 
nerally with a considerable proportion of sand ; in other places it 
is black, being chiefly reduced moss, with a small proportion of 
the clay of the subsoil. Where it does not rest on the rock, it 
lies generally either on layers of gravel apparently laid by water, 
or on a light brown clay, or on reddish till. 

There are no rolled stones in the parish, except afexo of the same 
substance with the variety of greywacke. No. 2. 

There is a layer of clay-slate near the Piltanton burn, on the 
eastern boundary, such as soft slate pencils are made of. 

Zoology, — It is believed that there is little remarkable in the 
zoology of this parish. 

The seal  Phoca vitulina  has sometimes been seen on the rocks 
of the shore, and the otter  Lutra vulgaris J frequently. The brown 
rat f Mus decumanus, which infests almost every house and stack- 
yard in the parish, abounds in the rocks along the shore, and is 
believed to feed there on shell-fish and the carrion cast up by 
the sea. The black rat  Mus rattus  is not found in the parish. 
Among the loose rocks, about the roots of furze, and in stone 
dikes everywhere, but especially near the coast, may be found 
abundantly the hedge-hog,  Erinaceus EuropcBus, the weasel 
Mustela vulgaris, the ermine Mustela erminea, and the fou- 
mart Mustela putorius. The gamekeeper at Dunskey thinks 
there are two distinct species called weasel here, the one much 
smaller than the other, and seldom attacking animals larger than 
mice or small birds; the other attacks rabbits. Foxes have been 
killed in the parish, but none have been known to breed in it for 
at least three years past. Hares are not so abundant as in many 
other districts. A young one was found last year nearly quite 



PORTPATllIC'K. 



137 



white. Rabbits abound within a mile of the coast. The grey 
rabbit is the most common, but the black are numerous. Some 
have been killed partly grey and partly white, and one was recent- 
ly killed partly black and partly white. 

The progress of cultivation has greatly diminished the numbers 
of the red grouse  Lag opus Scoticus.J Of the black-cock f Tetrao 
tetrix  a few are killed every year by the regular sportsmen, and 
many more, it is to be feared, by the poacher. The common par- 
tridge Perdix cinerea J is rather thinly distributed. The game- 
keeper at Dunskey has remarked that, during the absence of the 
mother from the nest, the damp seems to affect the eggs, so as 
frequently to cause induration of the membrane which lines tbe 
interior surface of the shell, so that the young birds cannot escape 
and die. The quail f Coturnix vulgaris is an occasional visitant 
from Ireland. The pheasant  Phasianus Colchicus  has been in- 
troduced, and thrives tolerably well in the more sheltered planta- 
tions around Dunskey. They have been found both young and 
old, nearly pure white. The heron  Ardea cinerea J frequents the 
coast, but does not breed here. The smaller birds that engage 
the interest of the sportsman are the woodcock  Scolopax rusticolaJ 
the common snipe  Scolopax gallinago J, and the jack-snipe f Sco- 
lopax gallinula. The starling  Stiirnus vidgaris  appears in 
considerable numbers once a year, and sometimes twice, and has 
been known to breed. Whilst the ring-dove  Columha Palumbus J 
is frequently met with in the woods, the rock-dove  C. cenas J 
abounds among the cliffs and in the caves of the shore, along with 
the hooded-crow  Corvus comix, J and the jack-daw f C. mone- 
dula.J A bird frequent among the jackdaws, which the game- 
keeper has not seen elsewhere, is described by him as rather 
larger, with very fine jet-black plumage, bill and legs red, build- 
ing its nest in dry holes in rocks and caves. The peregrine fal- 
con  Falco peregrinus J breeds in the neighbourhood, and may be 
seen in the parish during the whole year. The wind-hover or 
stannel F. tinnunculus  breeds, and is seen plentifully the 
whole year. The merlin  F. JEsalon J breeds, and is also plenti- 
ful at all seasons. The kite  Milvus vidgaris  may be seen some- 
times in the winter, but is not common. The hen-harrier  Circus 
cyaneus J appears at the end of the harvest but rarely. The spar- 
row-hawk  Accipiter fringillarius  breeds and js very common 
everywhere. The short horn owl  Otus hrachyotos J breeds, and may 
be found at all seasons, but not plentifully. The barn-owl fAluco

jflammeiis  is not rare, and remains all year. The European god,t- 
swckev  Caprimulgus Europosus breeds, bufis rare, and does not 
remain during the year. The raven, carrion-crow, blackbird, 
common thrush, and magpie, are found much as in other districts, 
at all seasons, the missel- thrush in harvest, and the rook not so 
common. The common lapwing and the green plover Chara- 
drius pluvinlis  are not rare. In the woods the common creeper 
 Certhia familiaris will frequently attract notice. Of other 
small birds the variety is considerable, but the numbers are not great. 

Ichthyologrj. — The common trout, of rather small size, but 
very superior flavour, and the common eel, are the only fish that 
inhabit the small streams. Of the sea-fish, those commonly brought 
ashore by the fishermen are the common cod, ling, conger-eel, 
pollack, here called lythe, coal-fish here called blockin, grey 
and red gurnard, the three-bearded gade, flounder, thorn -back, 
skate, turbot occasionally, and the common dog-fish, abundantly 
used as bait for the baskets in which the buckles  Buccinum. un- 
datum are caught for baiting the cod lines. Whitings are rarely 
taken, and the haddock which, in the remembrance of the present 
fishermen, was most abundant, seems to have abandoned the coast 
entirely. The cook Labrus coquus  and the saury  Scomberesox 
saurus have been caught. The following are given as inhabi- 
tants of this shore on the authority of W. Thompson, Esq. of Bel- 
fast, who has specimens in his possession : Liparis Montagui, 
Leptocephalus Momsii, and the doubly-spotted goby, Gobius bi- 
punctatus of Yarrell. 

Reptiles. — The lizard Lacerta agiHs,J and the blind-worm 
f Anguis frngilis  are not uncommon in this parish. The com- 
mon viper or adder Vipera communis abounds in some of the 
uncultivated parts of the parish. There is no scarcity of the dif- 
ferent sorts of the eft {Triton. The common frog and the toad 
are here much in the same abundance as in other districts not 
remarkably swampy. 

The glow-worm is found plentifully in the glen north of the 
town. Of eight species of Helix found in this parish, the H. 
trochilus may be remarked as rare, and the ff. nemoralis and 
H. aspersa as unusually abundant near the coast. The latter 
used to be gathered in large baskets as bait for cod-fish before re- 
course was had to the shell-fish so abundantly supplied by the 
channel. Along the coast the Pupa muscortm, Balea perversa, 
and Clausilia perversa, are also very abundant

The Cingula pulla may be easily found among the abundant 
Cingula parva at the roots of the small Algge north of the 
harbour. The Pholas Candida and Pholas crispata may be dug 
up from the clay in the harbour, and the Tellina fahula from the 
sand. Beams of wood used in the harbour works recently exhi- 
bited remarkable ravages of the Teredo navalis. The baskets 
used by the fishermen for capturing the Buccinum iindatum fre- 
quently contain the Fusus antiguus, Fusus corneus, Triton erina- 
ceus, N'asa reticulata, Nasa incrassata, and sometimes Rostellaria 
pes-pelecani, Trochus magus, Fusus nebula, Turritella terehra, 
Scalaria clathratulus, Cyprcea Europcsa, Natica glaucina, and Te- 
rehra reticulata. Entangled with the baskets adhering to other 
shells may also be found Modiola vulgaris, Capulus Hungaricus, 
Emarginida Jissura, Chiton ruber and Chiton fascicular is. In the 
roots of the larger Algae on the coast the Area lactea has been 
found, and the Hiatella arctica frequently. On the shore of 
Killantringan Bay, cast up by the sea, the Pectunculus pilosus, 
Pectunculus decussatus, Nucula nuclea, Venus cassina, and Venus 
fasciata have been gathered, as also the Lima fragilis. In the 
same bay, on the rocks and stones, the Chiton Icevigntus may be 
found often of a very large size. One lately found measured 13 
lines in length, and 7 in breadth. Oysters have been dredged 
off Old Dunskey Castle, and among them the Cyprina Islandica. 

Much attention is paid in this parish to the rearing of the 
black hornless breed of cattle peculiar to Galloway. 

Botany. — No very careful survey is known to have been made 
of the vegetable productions of this parish. There seems to be a 
rich field for the study of the Cryptogamic genera. The ferns, 
Ophioglossum viilgatitm and Botrychium lunaria, are found on the 
high ground north of the town. ~ Of the phsenogamous plants 
that abound along the coast, the following may be mentioned ; 
Statice armeria, Scilla verna, Cistus helianthemum, Pyrethum ma- 
ritimum, Anthyllis vulneraria, Geranium sanguineum, Gentiana 
officinalis, Erithrcta littoralis, Daucus carota, Hypericum pulch- 
rum, and Hypericum humifusum. The Crithmum maritimum. 
Inula crithmoides, and Carlina vulgaris, are found on the rocks 
of the shore, near the southern boundary of the parish. The 
Coronopus Ruellii grows abundantly near the town. The Adoxa 
moschatellina and the Echium vulgare are found in the iarish, as 
also occasionally a pure white variety of the Hyacinthus non- 
scriptus. The Vaccinium oxycoccos abounds in the boggy moor to 
the north-west.

Of forest trees, the elm, sycamore, and ash, are the favourites 
of the climate. The pinaster, spruce, and silver firs, and the 
oak, thrive tolerably well. The attempt to cultivate Scotch fir 
and larch has proved a decided failure. 

11. — Civil History. 

There seems to be very little in the civil history of Portpatrick 
which, in a brief account like the present, is worthy of notice apart 
from the general History of Galloway, of which a brief review may 
be found in Chalmers' Caledonia, Vol. iii., with frequent reference 
to authorities and to sources of more ample information. Some 
manuscripts connected with the history of the family of Montgo- 
mery were pubhshedat Belfast in 1830, in one volume 12mo. There 
is a large plan of the property of the principal heritor in his house 
at Dunskey, exhibiting the agricultural divisions of about two- 
thirds of the surface of the whole parish, with the measurement of 
each field in acres. 

Portpatrick was long celebrated as the Gretna Green for Ire- 
land. Parties who could not obtain ecclesiastical sanction of their 
marriage on the other side of the channel, with all the expedition 
or secrecy which the opposition of relatives or other circumstances 
rendered desirable, found their way to this place, and on satisfy- 
ing the minister that there was no legal objection to their union, 
were admitted to the benefit of proclamation in the parish church 
immediately on their arrival, and were married without delay. 
These marriages are registered in the records of the kirk-session, 
and attested by the minister and the witnesses. The fees exact- 
ed on these occasions varied according to the rank and ,abiHty of 
the parties. The lowest sum that was accepted at one time was 
L. 5, but it was latterly raised to L. 10, payable to the minister, 
and L. 1 to the session-clerk. This practice was abandoned in 
1826, in consequence of the interference of the church courts ; but 
during the preceding period of about fifty years, the records of 
these marriages exhiljits the names of 198 gentlemen, 15 officers 
of the army or navy, and 13 noblemen. 

Eminent Characters. — The late Sir James Hunter Blair, Bart, 
was sometime Lord Provost of Edinburgh, and its representative 
in Parliament. He was distinguished for the activity and intelli- 
gence with which he engaged in the general affairs of Scotland as 
a Member of Parhament, and for the influence which he had in 
promoting the improvement of the city over which he presided as 
a magistrate. At the same time he was not forgetful of the inte- 



PORTPATIUCK. 



141 



rests of Portpatrick, of which he was the principal heritor, but 
contributed much to its improvement and prosperity. His son, 
Colonel James Hunter Blair, for a considerable time Member of 
Parliament for Wigtonshire, was a man of many personal accom- 
plishments, highly esteemed and influential in the affairs of the 
county, and devoted to his parliamentary duties, to which it is be- 
lieved that he sacrificed his health and his life. His brother and 
successor in the estate of Dunskey, the late Forbes Hunter Blair, 
Esq. was induced, by the solicitation of a great number of the most 
respectable citizens of Edinburgh, to become a candidate, on the 
Conservative interest, for the parliamentary representation of that 
city, in the first election after the passing of the Reform Bill. The 
personal fatigue which he underwent in this election hastened his 
death, which happened soon after, to the deep regret of men of all 
parties in politics to whom he was known. Active and intelligent, 
disinterested, sternly conscientious and high-minded, yet most ge- 
nerous, and devoted to the promotion of the welfare of the poorest, 
his residence in the parish of Portpatrick was productive of much 
good to it in many ways, and his name merits a prominent place in 
a statistical account of it. To write the character of his excellent 
successor, while living, would not be consistent with delicacy. The 
late minister, the Rev. John Mackenzie, D. D., one of his Majesty's 
Chaplainsfor Scotland, who died in 1836, in the ninety- third year of 
his age, and sixty-third of his ministry, and was understood to be the 
oldest minister then in the Church of Scotland, was long admitted 
to a prominent place in the debates of the General Assembly. He 
was an early, and to the last the intimate friend and correspondent 
of Dr Gillies, the historian, and he has left an octavo volume of 
sermons, and a smaller volume of poetry, entitled " Ocean, Stella, 
and other Poems," which reached a second edition in 1830. 

Parochial Registers. — The only parochial registers are those 
kept by the session-clerk, in which, however, there are several mi- 
nutes of the meetings of heritors and kirk-session. Besides the vo- 
lume now in use, the records of the kirk-session consist of four vo- 
lumes ; the first extending from 7th May 1727 to 23d Novem- 
ber 1766, has been regularly kept : 341 small quarto pages are de- 
voted to the minutes of kirk-session, and 88 to the registry of 
marriages and births. On the last page is an oath of purgation 
from the sin of fornication, entitled " A copy of the Long Oath," 
the language of which is almost too horrible to be uttered. It ap- 
pears from these minutes that much attention was paid by the 



142 



WIGTON.SHIRE. 



kirk-session during the period to which they refer, to the restrain- 
ing and correction of Sabbath-breakers. The second volume a 
folio consists of 270 pages, of which 56 are occupied with mi- 
nutes of kirk-session, extending from 31st October 1773 to 20th 
November 1791. The remainder of the volume is occupied with 
the registrations of marriages, births, and a few burials. The 
third volume a folio has 52 pages near the middle devoted to mi- 
nutes of kirk-session from 29th October 1797 to 10th May 1818. 
The remainder of it is occupied with registry of marriages, births, 
and the sale of burying-ground in the church-yard. The fourth 
volume a folio has 29 pages onward in the volume devoted to 
minutes of kirk-session, and of heritors and kirk-session from 8th 
November 1818 to 28th April 1833. The remaining pages are 
devoted to the registry of marriages and births, and are at present 
in use only for this purpose. 

Antiquities. — Around the summit of the hill Cairnpat, at the dis- 
tance of about seventy and eighty yards, the ruins of two circular stone 
walls may be seen, which in late years have been greatly reduced, 
for the sake of the stones, to be used in erecting fences in the 
neighbouring farms. These walls beyond a doubt must have been 
erected for the purposes of fortification. An urn, well- formed of 
baked clay, was dug out of a cairn on the farm of Craigoch, about 
twenty-five years ago, and it is now in the mansion house of Dunskey. 
Circular pieces, from two to three inches diameter, cut out of ablack 
slate not found in the parish, are frequently dug up in the church- 
yard, along with rings, out of which these pieces seem to have been 
cut. Both of these are supposed by the people here to have been 
used at one time as money. An old kiln, such as those formerly 
used in Galloway for drying grain, may be seen near the farm- 
house of Low Auchenrue. No trace now remains of the mansion- 
house of the Adairs of Kilhilt, but its site is well known to have 
been where the line of Colfin Glen would meet the present turn- 
pike road. A chapel, dedicated to St Patrick, formerly stood 
either on the site of the present church or near to it, and was cal- 
led Chapel Patrick. Two views of Old Dunskey Castle, exhi- 
biting very nearly its present state, are given in the second volume 
of Grose's Antiquities, accompanied with a brief description. That 
antiquarian was probably mistaken when he concluded from the 
style of the building that it was not older than the middle of the 
sixteenth century. The suspicion which he intimates as to the 
accuracy of Simpson's account, that it belonged to the Lords of 



rORTPATRICK. 



143 



Airds in Ireland, is certainly unfounded. The same Viscount of 
Airds, by whom the church of Portpatrick was erected in the years 
1628 and 1629, is said, in the Montgomery manuscripts, p. 93, to 
have bought this castle, as well as Portpatrick town, from Sir Ro- 
bert Adair of Kinhiltj and to have put many convenient and hand- 
some additions to it. 

Modern Buildings. — The greater number of the houses in the 
town of Portpatrick are of very recent date. They are all built of 
the stone quarried from the neighbouring rocks, and are generally 
built substantially. The present mansion-house of Dunskey shows 
a stone in the wall with the inscription " Perfected 1706." It re- 
ceived a large addition about eight years ago, in the time of the 
late proprietor, and has been greatly altered and improved by the 
present proprietor. 

III. — Population. 

Within the remembrance of persons still living, and who are 
upwards of ninety years of age, there were not more than ten 
or twelve houses where the town of Portpatrick now stands. The 
inhabitants of these houses probably did not exceed 100, whilst it 
appears that about the same time the population of the whole pa- 
rish amounted to 551. 

The following is an extract from the Statistical Account given 
to Sir John Sinclair in 1791 ; " The return to the inquiries 
made by Dr Webster regarding the population of the parish of 
Portpatrick about forty years ago was 551 souls. It has since con- 
siderably increased. It appears from an enumeration recently 
made, that there are in the country part of the parish 484, and in 
the town, 512 souls, so that the whole population amounts to 996, 
being an addition, in that space of time, of 445 souls." 

By the census taken in 1831, under direction of Parliament, 
the whole population amounted to 2239. The following note has 
been kept by the schoolmaster who made the return:

Since 1831, the population has decreased inconsequence of the 
number of men having been reduced who were then employed in 
constructing the new harbour. At present it amounts to 1991, of 
whom there are in the town, 1010 ; in the country, 981.

The principal heritor is the only man of independent fortune re- 
sident in the parish. There are six other families deriving from 
L. 200 to L. 400 each, from their official duties and other sources. 

Of proprietors of land in the parish of the yearly value of up- 
wards of L. 50 there are three, among whom all the land in the pa- 
rish is divided in the proportion of 1026|, 346, and 190, accord- 
ing to their valuation. 

There are 25 unmarried men upwards of fifty years of age, of 
whom 6 have not been married, and 19 are widowers. There arc 
82 unmarried women upwards of 45 years of age, of whom 20 have 

 It is remarkable that, about twenty years ago, the birlh of an illegitimate child

not been married, and 2 are widows. Of 317 men who have 
been married, 30 have been twice married, and 287 only once 
married; of 363 women, 21 have been twice married, and 342 
only once married. Of married persons, male and female, who 
have had no children, there are 23 in the town, 8 in the country, 
31 in the whole parish. Number of families in the town, 238 ; in 
the country, 182 ; in the whole parish, 420. The average num- 
ber of individuals for each family is very nearly 4 in the town, 
5j in the country, and 4| in the whole parish. For the families 
in which all or some of the children reside with their parents, the 
average number of children of all ages thus residing is rather less 
than 2jV in the town, rather more than 3| in the country, and ra- 
ther less than 2j in the whole parish. 

There are 120 inhabited houses in the town, 177 in the coun- 
try, and 297 in the whole parish ; 4 uninhabited houses in the 
town, 2 in the country, and 6 in the whole parish. There are no 
houses being built at present. None have been built in the coun- 
try for a year past, and none in the town for ten years past. The 
people are generally hardy and naturally robust. But, upon the 
whole, they do not seem to perform so much labour as the inhabi- 
tants of many other districts. This difference may be chiefly owing 
to irregular employment and poor living. 

There are in the whole parish 4 persons insane, 9 fatuous, 4 
blind, 4 deaf and dumb ; and besides these, there are 2 persons, a 
man and his sister, he aged sixty-six, and she aged seventy-three, 
both of whom are at once blind, deaf and dumb. Both could once 
see, but have been blind for between 20 and 30 years. They can be 
made to understand by means of touch, what their friends find it 
necessary to communicate to them for their bodily comfort and 
personal safety. He can attend to the fire to supply it with fuel 
when it is required. She is remarkably particular as to her dress. 
Both can be made to understand when any one is present with 
whom they have formerly been acquainted ; and when they are in- 
formed that the minister is present, they compose themselves, and 
assume a grave and serious aspect. This is especially the case 
with the woman. 

Language. — English is spoken in this parish, with less of pro- 
vincial accent and less mixture of Scotch than in the more central 
and populous districts of Scotland. 

There are few games or regulated amusements followed, and 
none peculiar to the parish. Curling in the hard frosts of winter

is the favourite game. Quoits and hand-ball are occasionally re- 
sorted to at other seasons, but rarely by grown persons. Hand- 
ball and marbles are the only games in favour with the boys. The 
gu'ls seem to have no games at all peculiar to themselves. 

Character and Habits of the People. — The poorer class, constitut- 
mg the majority of the population, are very far from being cleanly 
or tidy in their habits ; but it is quite the reverse with those in 
better circumstances, especially in the town. The diet of the or- 
dinary labourer is often very poor. The smallness of his wages, 
and still more his improvident habits, allow him but a rare supply 
and scanty proportion of animal food. Many, especially of the 
labourers resident in the town or in the country, and of the small 
cottars in the country, are miserably clothed, miserably fed, mi- 
serably lodged, and miserably provided with furniture in their 
dwellings. But these evils have undoubtedly, in most instances, 
a moral cause. For others, with precisely the same advantages, 
contrive to make themselves tolerably comfortable. The agricul- 
tural population are generally much poorer, and do not live so 
well as in the better cultivated and more populous districts of 
Scotland. Farmers, in circumstances of moderate comfort, do not 
use animal food above once in a day, and that not always. 

The ordinary comforts and advantages of society may generally 
be enjoyed by the prudent and industrious. In the queries, to 
which this Statistical Account is an answer, it is asked whether 
" the people, on the whole, are contented with their situation and 
circumstances " Here it is necessary to distinguish between two 
kinds of what is commonly called contentment. There is in the 
majority by far too much of that sort of contentment which con- 
sists in preferring the present condition to the exertion and pru- 
dent management by which it might be improved. But, as inse- 
parable from this species of contentment, there is a lamentable de- 
ficiency of that just and thankful recognition of comforts and 
advantages enjoyed or attainable, which, mingling with a sense of 
the salutary discipline of unavoidable evils, constitutes true con- 
tentment. Although there is not so much of the restless and 
mischievous spirit of discontent openly displayed, as would be hail- 
ed by the unprincipled demagogue, enough may be observed to 
suggest and enforce the lesson, that, unless the hearts of men be 
imbued with the spirit of the Gospel, we shall look everywhere in 
vain for such contentment as is truly conducive to the well-being 
of society, or to its permanent security.

The people are generally characterized by intellect naturally 
vigorous, but uncultivated. They are capable of being excited to 
very great violence of feeling : and vindictive feelings usually .find 
with them a free and instant expression. But withal, they dis- 
play more external courtesy towards one another, and more re- 
spectful manners in addressing their superiors, than may be observ- 
ed in the more populous districts. In common with the other in- 
habitants of Galloway they are distinguished by a ready and un- 
grudging hospitality. Among the crimes ordinarily falling under 
the cognizance of the civil magistrate, assaults, rioting and fighting 
on the public streets, are much to be complained of, but are not so 
frequent as at one time, when it used to be said at Donaghadee, 
" I'll not meddle with you just now ; but stop till I get you at 
Portpatrick, where there is no law." Petty thefts are prevalent. 
They are often attributed to the bands of tinkers who encamp on 
the common on their way to and from Ireland ; but these un- 
doubtedly deserve but a small share of the blame. The f ciUties 
afforded by the wild coast for plundering the goods cast ashore in 
shipwrecks, have always presented a strong temptation. The des- 
perate cupidity exhibited in recent cases by many, even with the 
grim spectacles of death before them, and the impossibility of de- 
tecting the numerous depredators, sufficiently prove that the tone 
of public morality on the question of " mine or thine" is not very 
high. Profane swearing is lamentably frequent ; but probably not 
more so than in other parts of the country. If it be true, as has 
been said, that drunkenness prevails to a more than ordinary de- 
gree in Portpatrick, the assertion, which is probably incorrect, 
must, at all events, be confined to the town. And here the most 
favourable conclusion that observation will warrant is, that the ha- 
bits of the people in this regpect are, upon the whole, better than 
we find in other sea-ports, and that a great improvement has taken 
place of late years. The Sabbath is usually observed with out- 
ward quietness- Idleness and wandering are the principal forms 
of its desecration, if we overlook the national profanity of the 
sailing of the mail packets, and the running of the mail-coaches, 
by which many well disposed men are laid under the necessity of 
labouring, and of absenting themselves frequently both from pub- 
lic and domestic religious duties. An observer of the peculiar 
character of the people would probably remark a natural suscep- 
tibility of solemn impressions, which, however, through igno- 
rance and spiritual blindness, often degenerates into superstition, 



148 



WIGTONSHIRE. 



consistent with various immoralities. If the experience of a few 
years of ministerial duty might justify the author of these pages in 
hazarding the opinion, he would say that those who know and love 
the Bible in this parish seem to draw from it a deeper tone of 
religious feeling than is generally to be remarked in the same class 
of men in several other districts with which he has been acquaint- 
ed. The number of these, alas  bears but a small proportion to 
the whole population. Perhaps the following well ascertained 
statement respecting family worship, taken together with other facts 
to be stated under the heads of " Ecclesiastical State" and " Educa- 
tion" may illustrate the religious character of the population 
more satisfactorily than any mere general statement of opinion : Of 
the Protestant families in the whole parish, there are sixty in which 
there is family worship usually every day, and sixty-one in which 
it is usual to have family worship only on Sabbaths. 

Poaching in game prevails to a considerable extent, and is not 
confined, as in most other parts of the country, to a few worthless 
and desperate characters. Small quantities of soap are frequently 
brought from Ireland and sold among the families in the parish 
by poor people. This seems to be the only remaining vestige of 
smuggling. 

There is no regular pawnbroker nearer than Stranraer, and 
probably not very many persons from this parish have recourse to 
him. Those who would, have little to pawn. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The statements under this head are given with 
confidence on the authority of John Murdoch, Esq. J. P. factor 
to the principal heritor.

The kinds of trees which have been generally planted, are, oak,

and pinaster. The almost only wood in the parish is around 
Dunskey, the residence of the principal proprietor. It has been 
planted chiefly within the last thirty years. The annual thinning 
and pruning is conducted by experienced foresters under the di-

rection of the proprietor and his factor, according to the most ap- 
proved method of the present day. 

Eent. The average rent of arable land in the parish is 10s. per 

imperial acre. The average rent of grazing is at the rate of L. 1, 
10s. per ox or cow grazed, and at the rate of L. 5 per ewe or full- 
grown sheep pastured for the year. 

Wages. — The rate of labour, winter and summer, for different 
kinds of farm-labourers, varies from lOd. to Is. 6d. per day, and for 
country artisans, it is 2s. 6d. per day. 

The price of the several kinds of raw produce, grain, &amp;c. is 
that of the Glasgow and Liverpool markets, deducting the ex- 
pense of carriage. The rates of mason, carpenter, and other me- 
chanical work are also regulated by the more populous parts of 
Scotland. 

Live-Stoch — The sheep, of which comparatively few are kept, 
, are chiefly of the black-faced breed. The cattle are principally of 
the Galloway breed, to the improvement of which greater attention 
has been lately devoted by crossing with bulls of the same breed, 
selected from improved stocks of the neighbouring districts. The 
peculiar excellence of this breed consisting in the smallnessof the 
bone, and the greater proportion of lean when the animals are 
thoroughly fattened, is well known in the London Smithfield mar- 
ket, where the Galloway spayed heifer sells at I Jd. per lb. higher 
than any other beef. 

Husbandry. — The general character of the husbandry pursued, 
although not the best, is tolerably good, being alternate pasture and 
oats, with the intervention of a hoed green crop, chiefly potatoes in 
the drier soils. The general tendency, however, is to over-cropping. 
Draining and an undeviating rotation of crops are improvements 
of which the present husbandry of the parish is very susceptible. 

The general duration of leases is nineteen years. In this respect 
they are favourable at once to the improvement of the soil and to 
the occupier, giving him a sufficient time for a return of outlay. 

The farm-houses and buildings are, for the most part, pretty good ; 
as are also the fences, which are chiefly of stone, or of sod with 
furze sown on the top. The latter makes a tolerably good fence 
when the furze is properly dressed. 

Within the last twenty years, considerable improvements have 
been made by the occupiers generally, in reclaiming mossy and 
formerly waste hmds, by paring and burning, and by a better 
system of cultivation, although in this last respect much remains 



150 



WIGTONSHIRE. 



yet to be done. Within the same period, the principal proprietor 
has effected very striking improvements by extensive plantations, 
tastefully arranged for landscape effect, and by draining and laying 
down for permanent pasturage about 400 acres around his re- 
sidence. The great extent of private gravel walks and well- 
dressed thorn hedges, although, strictly speaking, they do not 
come under the head of agriculture, may be mentioned here as re- 
markable improvements. 

The chief obstacles to improvement are what may be supposed 
to have arisen from the want of improving leases as to farm-build- 
ings, &amp;c. and from the laws of entail, under which there is about 
one-third of the landward part of the parish. 

There are no mines in the parish. Coal has been lately sought 
for, but in vain. 

Fisheries. — Till the year 1813, there was no regular fishery at 
Portpatrick, except for the supply of the inhabitants. The fish 
caught were generally of small size, such as are still caught for 
the same purpose during the summer months near the shore, either 
with rods orhand-hnes baited with limpets or crabs. From 1813 to 
1821, about 20 boats and 100 men were employed in fishing herrings. 
Each boat used from 1200 to 1600 yards of net, and the average 
profit of each was about L. 80 ; the price of herrings varying from 
30s. to 40s. per barrel. The average number of barrels of her- 
rings caught by the Portpatrick boats during each of the above 
years must have been about 900. From six to eight of these 
boats fished with the Government bounty of L. 3 per ton, and 
averaged about twenty tons. The other boats employed were from 
five to eight tons. After the Government bounty was withdrawn, 
the fishery was abandoned as unprofitable : for, although the great- 
er number of the boats employed had not enjoyed the bounty 
they did not put to sea till the bounty boats had discovered the 
shoals of herrings, and so were saved much expense. The great- 
er number of herrings were caught between Portpatrick and Port- 
nessock to the south, and at the distance of from two to three miles 
from the shore. The usual fishing season for the Portpatrick boats 
was from the beginning of June till the beginning of August. The 
herrings came from the north, and proceeded south to the Isle of 
Man, where the fishery began about the 10th of August. Be- 
sides the Portpatrick boats, many from other places fished on the 
coast, and 120 have been seen in the harbour at once. The want of 



PORTPATlllCK. 



151 



the bounty is the only reason assigned by the fishermen for no at- 
tempt being now made to resume this fishery. 

Immediately after the herring fishery was abandoned, it was found 
that a profitable fishery of cod might be carried on during the five 
months, from the beginning of November to the beginning of 
April. This has continued ever since to be the only fishery car- 
ried on at Portpatrick. During last season, the fish were very 
abundant. Ten boats with three men, or two men and a boy in 
each, were employed ; and each boat realized at an average about 
L. 20 of clear profit. The fish above 12 pounds were sold at an 
average of 9d. each during the season. The average weight of 
such fish as taken from the water was about 16 pounds. The 
largest were from 36 pounds to 40 pounds. The cod come from 
the north and proceed southward. It is the opinion of the fisher- 
men, that they go round the south coast of Ireland, and return 
northward along the west coast. In the beginning of the fishing- 
season, they are caught in water .about 30 fathoms deep, and to- 
wards the end of the season in water about 60 fathoms. They 
are supposed to seek the deeper water, in order to avoid the strong 
current, as they become weaker from the approach of the time of 
spawning, which is in April and May. The distance of the cod 
fishing ground from the'shore is from two to three miles. The lines 
used in fishing are from 800 to 1000 fathoms, having hooks along 
the whole length, at the distance of two fathoms, and are stretch- 
ed along the bottom by large stones let down at each end, and 
fastened by a cord to a buoy on the surface of the water. The 
bait used is the shell-fish, Buccimm undatum called here buckie, 
which is caught for the purpose in baskets containing pieces of fish, 
which are let down in about 10 fathoms water about a Quarter of a 
mile off from the harbour or the old castle, and are drawn up daily 
to be emptied of the shell-fish which have crept into them to feed 
on the dead fish. Each shell-fish serves to bait two hooks ; so 
that reckoning the number of hooks used by all the boats at 4500, 
about 2250 of these large shell-fish must be destroyed every time 
the lines are shot, and probably not fewer than 70,000 every year. 
Yet the supply chiefly obtained from a space of no great extent 
seems to be even more abundant than ever. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 
the parish, as nearly as that can be ascertained, has been calculat- 
ed as follows, by the gentleman to whose authority the facts stat- 
ed under the head of Agriculture have been referred.

Manufactures. — There are no manufactures for the general mar- 
ket in this parish, except the embroidering of musHn with the 
needle by women. Twelve weavers, called customer weavers, are 
employed in working up the produce of the domestic spinning-wheels 
for the use of the families by whom they are employed. 

Navigation. — There are, at present, only four sail-vessels 
belonging to this port. Of these one is of 80 tons burthen, 
two of 40 tons, and one of 20 tons. All of the.se are frequently 
employed in bringing coals for the use of the steam-packets, or of 
the inhabitants. The largest sometimes also brings stone for the 
harbour-works, and the others sometimes import lime for the pur- 
poses of agriculture. About fifty years ago, six vessels of the ave- 
rage of 60 tons belonged to the people and the harbour of Port- 
patrick, and were employed in the coasting-trade, chiefly in the 
importation of cattle from Ireland. It appears from the Statisti- 
cal Account of 1791, that, sometime previous to that date, a com- 
pany of shipwrights had been formed under the auspices of Sir 
James Hunter Blair. But only four vessels of any considerable 
size seem to have been built here. The last of these was built in 
1790. 

Besides the sail-vessels belonging to this harbour, two steam- 
ers are stationed here by the Admiralty as mail-packets. 

Agricultural Association. — There is no public or private Asso- 
ciation in this parish for the encouragement or improvement of any 
branch of industry : but several of the farmers are members of the 
Stranraer and Rhins of Galloway Agriculture Society, which is of 
recent origin, but is believed to have excited considerable interest in 
the improvement of the breeds of cattle and of the art of ploughing. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
The nearest market-town is Stranraer, where there is a general 
weekly market on Fridays, besides other stated markets during the 
year.

Toion. The town of Portpatrlck was "erected Into a burgh of ba- 
rony in the end ofthe reign of James VI., or beginning of the reign of 
Charles 1. before 1628." Chalmers' Caledonia, Vol. iii. p. 408 : 
but the charter seems to have remained a dead letter, so far as re- 
spects the establishment of a burgh magistracy or police. There is 
only one justice of the peace in the parish. There has recently been 
stationed in the town, in connection with the police of the county, 
a sub-constable, whose district comprehends the parishes of Port- 
patrick, Leswalt, and Kirkcolm, and who acts under a superinten- 
dent residing at Stranraer. There is no trade worth mentioning. 
Lime from Ireland and coals from Ayrshire are imported for the 
use of the parish, and occasionally the agricultural produce of the 
district is exported ; but rarely, as the greater part is sold at Stran- 
raer, either for consumpt there or for exportation. The number 
of cattle and horses imported here from Ireland is now very incon- 
siderable. It appears from the Statistical Account of 1791, that 
the number of cattle and horses imported in the preceding year 
was 17,275; in 1812, it reached 20,000: but last year 1837 
it amounted to no more than 1080. Both cattle and horses from 
Ireland are now conveyed so easily and safely by steamers to Li- 
verpool or Glasgow, that the short sea passage at Portpatrick is 
not so desirable for them as when steam navigation was unknown 
or in its infancy. 

There was alarge custom-house establishment not very many years 
ago at Portpatrick, with a collector, comptroller, &amp;c. connected with 
the custom-house at Stranraer. There is now only a single tide- 
surveyor. 

The eastern boundary of the parish takes in a few houses of the 
small village of Lochans. Through this village the turnpike-road 
passes from Portpatrick to Stranraer. About five miles of this road 
lie within the parish, and are kept in admirable repair. 

Post-Office. — There is a post-office in the town, at which letters 
from Irelandare sortedforthe Scotch and English mails, and through 
which the number of letters and newspapers that pass to and from 
Ireland is supposed to amountto between 8000 and 10,000 daily. A 
mail-coach between Portpatrick and Glasgow, and another between 
Portpatrick and Dumfries, arrive and depart every day, each drawn 
by two horses, and calculated to carry, besides the guard and driver, 
four passengers inside, and four outside. The fares to Glas- 
gow inside are L. 1, 8s., and outside, 18s. ; to Dumfries inside, L. 1, 
10s., and outside, L. 1, Is. ; to Stranraer inside, 3s., and outside, 2s.

Packets. — Of the two steam-packets supplied by the Admiralty 
for the service of the post-office, one sails to Ireland, and the other 
returns daily. These packets carry cabin-passengers for a fare o f 
5s., and deck-passengers for 2s. The following table, supplied by 
the packet agent, shows the number of cabin and deck-passen- 
gers who have crossed the channel in these packets from 4th May

" Portpatrick," says Chalmers, Caledonia, Vol. iii. p. 409, 
" owes its increase to its having become the port of communica- 
tion with Ireland. It was only in 1662 that a regular post was 
established between Scotland and Ireland through Portpatrick ; 
and then only once a week. Formerly the harbour at Portpatrick, 
in its natural state, was a mere inlet between two ridges of rocks 
that advanced into the sea ; and as there is a prodigious swell 
from the west, upon the mouth of this creek, without any elbow 
to protect a vessel, it was then only practicable for small flat-bot- 
tomed vessels to navigate here ; and it was necessary for every one 
that arrived to take the ground ; and all the people of the place 
collected and drew the vessel on the beach, out of the influence 
of the waves. In order to remedy this inconvenience, a very fine 
pier was built ; but this having also been found insufficient, a pro- 
ject is now in operation, under the authority of Parliament, 1820, 
for very greatly improving the harbour of Portpatrick ; so as to 
afford perfect security and convenience at this frequented passage 
There is a reflecting light-house at Portpatrick, and another a 
Donaghadee on the Irish side, both which were built before 1790. 
Portpatrick forms one of the creeks of the port of Stranraer." 

The " project" referred to in the above extract began to be 
executed in March 1821, under the superintendence of a board 
of commissioners appointed by act of Parliament, and consisting 
chiefly of gentlemen belonging to the neighbouring district. A 
harbour greatly more extensive than the former, and comprehend- 



PORTrATRlCK.

ing it in its arms, was planned by the justly celebrated engineer, 
the late Mr Rennie, and the work was carried on for some time 
by a resident engineer under his direction. Subsequently to his 
death, the direction was transferred to his son, the present Sir John 
Rennie. The whole plan was originally designed for sail- vessels, 
and was admirably adapted for their warping out into the current 
of the channel in any weather, when it was possible for them to go 
to sea. After the substitution of steam-vessels as mail-packets, it 
was found necessary to excavate to a greater extent than was con- 
templated in Mr Rennie's plan, in consequence of which the ori- 
ginal estimate about L. 120,000, became deficient, and an ad- 
ditional grant was made by Parliament, which it is believed will 
complete the work. The form of the new harbour very much resem- 
bles a horse shoe. From the south side of it, the old quay, a 
pier showing the date 1774, points inward, nearer the land than the 
centre of the basin, whilst the other side embraces a large rock, 
by which it is partly sheltered from the sea that enters the mouth 
of the harbour. Both sides run out into piers, inclining slightly 
towards each other, and furnished with jetties near their extremi- 
ties, by which the entrance is contracted to 180 feet. The north 
pier is not yet finished ; but the south one was completed about three 
years ago, and is a very handsome building. The parapet is wrought 
in massive grey limestone from Wales, and terminates in a semi- 
circular curve, half embracing and protecting a handsome light- 
house 46 feet in height, and built of the same material. The back 
of this pier is protected by a glacis of rubble-work. From the 
extent of a quarry to the south, some idea may be formed of the 
enormous quantity of stone that has been poured into the deep in 
the construction of this harbour. But no one who did not see the 
work at its commencement, or in the early stages of its progress, 
can estimate the labour expended in excavating rock under water 
in the basin, partly by means of puddle dikes, and partly with the 
diving-bell. An animated description of these operations has been 
given by Mr M'Diarmid in his " Sketches of Nature." Although 
much opposition has been raised of late to this harbour as the 
station for the mail-packets between Scotland and Ireland, there 
seems to be very little reason to doubt of its possessing many very 
great advantages, in which no other station that has yet been sug- 
gested can compete with it. It is the nearest point to Ireland, be- 
ing only 21 miles distant, which during nine-tenths of the whole 
year, gives it an undeniable superiority. Steamers can go out here

in any weather, and effect a safe passage, and there is a peculiarity 
in the currents of the channel, which, in connexion with the ■prevail- 
ing winds, contributes to the faciUty of the passage. 

Notwithstanding all the disadvantages resulting from the un- 
finished state of the harbour, and the limited power of the ves- 
sels employed, the regularity and expedition with which the mails 
have been conveyed to and from Ireland at this station is remark- 
able. It appears from the report of Mr Napier of Glasgow, that 
steamers of 80 horse power could be built capable of entering the 
harbour of Portpatrick in its present state, whereas those at pre- 
sent used, have only 50 horse power. 

Notwithstanding much that has been said through ignorance, 
it is not to be believed that any enlightened and patriotic man, 
who shall rightly estimate not only the commercial but all of tlie 
many other advantages of hy far the shortest sea passage between 
Scotland and Ireland, will blame the expense that has already been 
incurred, or even grudge more if necessary, to render this passage 
as secure and easy in all sailing weather as a good harbour on both 
sides of the channel, with steamers of the highest available power, 
could make it. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church being in the town, 
which contains more than half of the population of the whole pa- 
rish, could not be more conveniently situated, although it is nearly 
five miles from the extremities of the parish. It was built in 1628 
and 1629. It is at present in indifferent repair ; but it has been 
resolved by the heritors to erect a new one, of sufficient size to ac- 
commodate the parish. The present building, which is in the 
form of a cross, with a round tower as a belfry, contains 300 sit- 
tings, none of which are free except those on a form placed in the 
middle passage. The manse was built probably more than sixty 
years ago. It received an addition of two rooms in 1824, and 
was thoroughly and comfortably repaired in the beginning of this 
year 1838 for the reception of the present incumbent. At the 
same time the garden was enclosed with an excellent six feet wall. 
The glebe consists of 12 acres of arable land close to the town on 
the south, and worth about L. 30 per annum. The stipend of the 
minister in 1755 was L. 55, 5s. lOd., and in 1798, L. 130, 12s. 3d. 
Some years ago apart of the stipend previously paid to the minister 
of Portpatrick was sued for by the minister of Inch as belonging to 
him, and recovered by him. The amount at present paid by the 
heritors to the minister of Portpatrick is L. 88, 10s. 5d., of which

Colonel Hunter Blair pays L. 67, 1 Is. 2d., Colonel Vans Agnew, 
L. 15, 19s. 9d., and the Earl of Stair, L. 4, 19s. 6d. After deduct- 
ing from this sum the allowance for communion elements, the 
difference between the remainder and L. 150 is paid by the Ex- 
chequer under the act for augmenting small stipends. 

Hiere are no places of stated public worship in the parish be- 
sides the Established Church. As this church contains only 300, 
the members of church-going families attached to the Establish- 
ment are under the necessity of attending by turns, and few chil- 
dren are to be seen in church. In these circumstances, it is im- 
possible to say how many individuals are in the habit of attending ; 
but the number who attend either regularly or occasionally, as they 
can be assured of finding seats, may probably amount to about 
600. Divine service in the parish church is usually well attended. 

The following table shows the number of the population be- 
longing, or professing to belong, to each of the several rehgious de- 
nominations known in the parish, with the number of communi- 
cants in each, and the number of sittings paid for by members of 
each denomination in the Catholic or in Dissenting congregations 
in Stranraer.

There are five elders in the kirk-session besides the minister ; 
and three others have been lately elected. A parochial associa- 
tion in aid of the General Assembly's four schemes, viz. Church 
Extension, School Extension, Foreign Missions, and Colonial 
Churches, was formed in August last ; the committee of manage- 
ment consisting of a president and vice-president, the members of 
kirk-session, thirteen collectors, a secretary, and a treasurer. Pre- 
viously to the formation of this association, the average amount of 
church collections yearly for religious and charitable objects, be- 
sides the regular and ordinary weekly collections for the poor, may 
be stated at L. 7. 

Education. — The number of schools in the parish, and the 
number of scholars in each, varies so much not only from year to 
year, but during every year, that the purpose of this Statistical 
Account will be best served by the following report made to the 



158 



VVIGTON SHIRE. 



presbytery in 1835, and exhibiting nearly the average of the last 
seven years. There is one parochial and seven private schools, 
the teachers of which, with one exception, belong to the Establish- 
ed Church. The branches taught are, English reading, writing, 
arithmetic, book-keeping, mensuration and navigation ; and the 
school fees vary from 2s. to 3s. per quarter. The parochial school- 
master has a salary of L. 30, besides the school fees. The year- 
ly average number of scholars attending these schools is 225. 

At present, there are four schools in the town, and three in the 
country. Of those in the town, one with six scholars has, for a 
year past, been under a teacher employed by the gentlemen of the 
parish, at the rate of L. 12, 12s. per annum for each scholar ; and 
another, with about 70 scholars, at the ordinary rate, has, for the 
same time, been under a teacher, appointed by a committee of the 
inhabitants, who secure to him either 60 scholars, or the wages 
for that number. Both of these schools are well taught. 

The present parochial teacher was the first who enjoyed a re- 
gular salary from the heritors. He was appointed in 1804. For 
about eight or ten years he taught in a room of the old barracks, 
above a lodging-house, whence all sorts of noise, and language of 
the worst description, might often be heard in the school. For 
about a year after this time he taught in his own dwelling-house, 
which had been erected for him about three years after his ap- 
pointment. He was then accommodated with the present school- 
house. The school-house and schoolmaster's house afford the 
legal accommodations ; but they are in indifferent repair. The 
number of the young between six and fifteen who cannot read, is 
103, who cannot write, 210. The number of persons upwards of 
fifteen who cannot read is 83, who cannot write, 383. 

The Bible and the Assembly's Shorter Catechism have always 
been used as ordinary class-books in the schools of this parish ; 
but it does not appear that the daily exercises have commenced 
with prayer. The superintendence of the presbytery has never 
amounted to more than simple inspection annually by a committee 
of two or three ministers. 

The standard of education is very low in the parish generally ; 
but there seems to be an increasing desire of improvement in this 
respect. There is no part of the parish so distant from a school 
as to prevent attendance. The great evil here is the desire to 
have schools in every quarter, rather than to secure the services of 
two or at the most three good teachers, which would be a sufficient 

3 



PORTPATRICK. 



159 



number for the necessities of the whole parish. In one district a 
teacher was recently employed by a committee of the inhabitants, 
who could hardly write, and who could not spell the most common 
English words. He lived in the school-house with his wife and 
two'' children ; and they begged in the neighbourhood whilst he 
was teaching. This was certainly an extreme case ; but it occur- 
red only three years ago. It may be safely affirmed that, during 
the last six years, three-fourths of the teachers in the parish have 
not earned the wages of a good ordinary labourer. A considerable 
sum has been subscribed, chiefly by the principal heritor and his 
sister. Miss Jemima Hunter Blair, for the erection of a comfort- 
able school-house and schoolmaster's house in a central position 
of the country part of the parish. It is hoped that this school 
will supply the greater part of the deficiency, which is altogether 
a deficiency in the quality, and not in the number of the schools. 
There has been a visible improvement in the general conduct and 
morals of the people since the facilities of education were increas- 
ed. But a considerable share of the credit, so far as educa- 
tion is concerned in it, is due to Sabbath schools, originally esta- 
bhshed by a committee composed of Dissenters and members of the 
Established Church, patronized by the late minister, and assidu- 
ously cherished by his daughters, who taught in one of them. 
These Sabbath schools have been recently united in one, under 
the superintendence of the kirk-session, and having on its lists 210 
scholars, of whom about 180 may be reckoned to attend every 
Sabbath. Only religious instruction is given in this school, and 
it forms also a congregation of the young, in which prayer and 
praise are united with frequent addresses from the minister. Twen- 
ty-one teachers, male and female, give their services gratuitously. 

Literature. — There is a small library connected with the Sab- 
bath school, and consisting of 250 small volumes, which are lent 
out to those scholars who pay 2d. during three months for the use 
of them. There is a parish library consisting of 352 volumes, 
which are lent out to subscribers in the parish at the rate of 2s. 
per annum. This library was founded about nine years ago, by a 
donation of 108 volumes from Miss Hunter Blair, of whom men- 
tion has already been made, and who, though residing in Edin- 
burgh, has ever shown the liveliest interest in the spiritual welfare 
of the parish. 

A Friendly Society, instituted in 1817, for the support of mem- 
bers in sickness, has done some good. It would have been of more 



160 



WIGTONSHIRK. 



general benefit, but that the surplus funds, having increased to a 
large amount under a too cautious management, and the entry- 
money bearing a fixed proportion to the amount of the funds hav- 
mg risen to a large sum, for a long time operated to the entire 
exclusion of new members. This evil has been lately remedied, 
and the number of members is increasing every month. 

A Savings Bank was commenced about nine years ago, by the 
then assistant minister, Rev. Mr Campbell, with the countenance 
and assistance of the late Forbes Hunter Blair, Esq. of Dunskey. 
But the attempt to promote the design of this most desirable in- 
stitution proved entirely abortive, chiefly in consequence, as it now 
appears, of an ungenerous and most absurd suspicion among the 
labouring classes, that their wages would be reduced if it were dis- 
covered that they could save money from their earnings to depo- 
sit in a bank. 

Poor's Funds. — The average number of names on the list of 
regular paupers during the last seven years is 32. The allow- 
ances are paid on the first lawful day of each month, and have va- 
ried from Is. 6d. to 17s. 2d. The average allowance may be 
stated at 4s. 6d. per month. But, besides the regular paupers, 
many receive occasional relief, and the sums thus given may amount 
to L. 20 in the year. The collections at the church door on 
Sabbaths have amounted to about L. 40 per annum at an average. 
A legacy of L. 180, left to the poor of the parish by the late Earl 
of Stair, yields L. 7, 4s. of interest per annum. The remainder 
of the sum necessary for the support of the poor and for other pa- 
rochial charges ordinarily made on the poor's funds, has hitherto 
been contributed voluntarily by the heritors, in the proportion of 
their respective valuations. There is no aversion among the poor 
generally to accept of parochial relief, but quite the contrary. 

Prisons. — There is a lock-up-house in the town, where prison- 
ers may be confined securely enough, though not very comfortably, 
for a night or two ; but it is very rarely used. 

Fairs have never been held in this parish. 

Inns, Ale-houses, Sfc. — There is a large and commodious Inn in 
the town, where nobility and travellers of rank frequently lodge 
in passing to and from Ireland. There are 8 other smaller inns 
and ale-houses, and a spirit store where liquors are retailed. The 
number of houses hcensed for retailing spirits is beyond all doubt 
injurious to the morals of the people here as elsewhere. Three 
well regulated inns in Portpatrick would be amply sufficient for all 

4 



PORTPATIIICK. 



161 



the purposes of orderly refreshment and comfortable accommo- 
dation. 

Fuel. — About 300 tons of coal, chiefly from Troon and Ayr, 
are consumed yearly by the inhabitants, at the rate of about 14s. 
or 15s. per ton. The fuel chiefly used is peat, procured from 
mosses in the parish, and usually sold in the town at from Is. 8d. 
to 2s. per cart load. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The more striking variations betwixt the present state of the pa- 
rish and that which existed at the time of the last Statistical Ac- 
count, have been already adverted to. The want of coal must pre- 
vent the introduction of manufactures to any considerable extent: 
but the condition of the working-classes would undoubtedly be im- 
proved if it were found profitable to introduce hand-loom weaving. 
The purity of the sea water here would render Portpatrick a de- 
sirable watering-place in the summer months, if baths were erect- 
ed, and pains were taken to improve the bathing-ground, which 
could be easily done by quarrying a little of the rock in various 
places where nature has already almost formed plunge-baths on the 
shore. There is a very pure and mild summer atmosphere ; the 
purest fresh water ; one chalybeate spring ; an admirable prome- 
nade on the piers, which are paved and dry in all weather; abun- 
dance of fish ; easy communication with the markets of Stranraer, 
Donaghadee, or Belfast; excellent houses for lodging; a daily 
post; and, in good weather, facilities for travelling to all parts of 
the three kingdoms.

PRESBYTERY OF STRANRAER, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY. 

THE REV. JAMES ANDERSON, MINISTER. 



1. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Situation, Extent, Sfc. — The parish of Stonykirk, more 
properly called Stephenkirk, comprising the united parishes of Stony- 
Kirk, Clayshank, and Toscarton, is situated on the west of the Bay 
of Luce. It is bounded on the south by the parish of Kirkmaiden ; 
on the west by the Irish Channel, and the parish of Portpatrick ; 
and by the parishes of Inch and Glenluce on the north. 

The parish is of an irregular figure, extending about 7 miles in 
breadth, on the north, and then continuing to contract towards the 
south, until its breadth does not exceed 3 miles. It measures about 
33 square miles, and contains 21,420 imperial acres, of which not 
about 650, stretching along the bay of Luce, of a sandy soil, and 60 
acres on the west, may now be reported as incapable of improve- 
ment. The soil of the rest, particularly of the eastern and south- 
ern district, is in general light and dry, and affords an early har- 
vest. A tract, extending along the western district, and reclaimed, 
in a great part, from a mossy and heathy state, consists of a heavier 
and wetter soil, and is in consequence later in the maturity of its 
produce. 

. The surface is varied by many inequalities ; but scarcely any 
of these deserves the name of a hill. There are about 1400 acres 
in detached spots, scattered over its surface, mostly considered ca- 
pable of improvement. 

Topographical Appearances. — The coast, on the north-west, is ra- 
ther bold and rocky, and precipitous in some places, becoming less so 
as it approaches the south. It is indented by three bays, affording 
moorings to the fishermen's small craft. The eastern coast is rather 
sinuous and stony, and varied by two bays: that of Sandhead is capa- 
cious, andaffords anchorage for lime and coal sloops. The lands 
extending from the Sandhead eastward, and joining the sands of 
Luce, of which they are a continuation, are marked with the ruins 
of many a vessel stranded on them, before the erection of the 

 Drawn up from Notes furnished by the parish Schoolmaster.

light-house on the Mull of Galloway. On the north and west 
sliores, the land rises rapidly from the sea ; but on the east and 
south-west, it slopes with a very gentle elevation. 

Climate. — Perhaps it is from the almost peninsular situation of 
the parish, that the sky is, generally speaking, rather cloudy, and 
the atmosphere moist ; and waterspouts are of occasional occur- 
rence. The most prevalent winds are from the west and north- 
west, which are generally accompanied with showers, and squally 
in winter ; and it is from the latter point that we experience our 
vernal and equinoctial gales. Our continued dry weather, how- 
ever, and frosts, are accompanied with east wind, and the heaviest 
rains are always preceded by the south wind. The climate, upon 
the whole, is rather salubrious, and the inhabitants generally at- 
tain longevity. 

Hydrography. — The little fresh water river which separates 
the parish on the north from the parish of Inch is not above 20 
feet wide when it leaves this parish ; and continuing its course in an 
easterly direction, it flows into the sea at the Bay of Luce. Its 
name is Poltanton, and it is frequented by the par, the pike, and 
salmon and sea-trout from the bay of Luce. The sands on the 
Bay of Luce abound with a shell-fish vulgarly called muskins, or 
razor-fish, from its resemblance to that instrument: it is taken 
as an article of domestic food during the months of March and 
April. We may remark, that the cod-fishery mentioned in the 
old Statistical Account, as prosecuted with various success, sup- 
ports its former character, affording nothing for exportation. 

Plantations. —The parish contains about 370 acres of planta- 
tion. Some of the planting is considered to be above 160 years 
old. There are about five acres of natural wood. 

II. — Civil History. 

Parochial Registers. —There is a register of baptisms and mar- 
riages kept, which contains also the accounts of disbursements, and 
the minutes of the session. There is no register of deaths ; and 
the births are by no means regularly entered. 

Land-owners.— The landed proprietors are, John M'Taggart, 
Esq. of Ardwell, M. P. ; Patrick Maitland, Esq. of Freugh ; Ma- 
jor James M'Dowall, Esq. of Logan ; Colonel Thomas Hunter 
Blair, C. B., of Dunskey ; Vans Agnew, C. B., of Barnbar- 
roch; Vans Hathorn, Esq. of Garthland; and the Honourable 
John WilHam H. Dalrymple, Earl of Stair, Caldons. The es- 
tates of each of these gentlemen yield more than L. 500 Sterlino- 



164 



WIGTONSHIllE. 



of annual rent.— The two principal heritors, John M'Taggart, Esq. 
of Ard well, and Patrick Maitland, Esq. reside generally on their es- 
tates in the parish, unless when the former is attending his duties 
in Parliament. 

Antiquities. — The parish contains three earthen mounds of a 
conical form ; the most remarkable of which is near Balgreg- 
gan House, the residence of Patrick Maitland of Freugh, which 
is 460 feet in circumference, and 60 feet in height, with an ex- 
cavation on its summit, and defended by a circular fosse. — On the 
lands of Garthland, is a square tower 45 feet in height, and exhi- 
biting on its battlements the date 1274; it was formerly the resi- 
dence of the Thanes of Galloway. The Bay of Floats is, in this 
parish, so called from a belief that some of the vessels composing 
the Spanish Flota were wrecked there. On the lands of Ard- 
well are some remains of Druid temples and Pictish castles. 
Two gold lachrymatories, weighing three and a half ounces each, 
were found on the lands of Garthland in 1783. It may be ad- 
ded, that there are the ruins of an old church, on the farm of 
Clayshank, distinctly visible above the surface. And Kirkmadrine, 
with its church- yard, still preserved as a burying-place, contains 
some grave-stones, with antique inscriptions. 

Modern Buildings. — A new church, on a magnificent scale, and 
of the Gothic order of architecture, was erected in the year 1827, 
the expenses of which amounted to L. 2000 Sterling ; and in 
1831, a new school-house and schoolmaster's dwelling-house, on 
a neat and commodious plan, were built. Within the last twenty- 
five years, a great number of farm-houses have been erected, 
all of which are very commodious and handsome, many of them 
consisting of two stories, and tastefully designed. 

III. — Population.

1811, . 2-364 

1821, . 3133 

1831, . 2966 

The increase in the population of 1821 was attributed to the 
ingress of Irish as servants and labourers ; and the decrease in 1831 
is attributed to the efforts of the heritors to check such ingress, 
with a view to the relief of the poor's funds. 

There is no town in this parish, and the only villages are the 
Sandhead, containing at last census a population of 121 ; and the 
little village beside the church, with a population of 72.

The farm-steadings in the parish, with fevv exceptions, are in a 
very commodious state. The farmers prefer the cultivation of 
wheat to that of barley. They practise the system of grain-crop- 
ping, and a farmer who, at the time of the old Statistical Ac- 
count, could not produce three square yards of turnips in his gar- 
den, can now have a field of 20 acres. 

Upon the whole, the modern system of farming, including re- 
claiming waste land, draining, &amp;c. is practised in the parish and 
on the most approved plan ; and for respectability, politeness, and 
intelligence, the farmers of Stonykirk need not shrinkfrom a com- 
parison with those of any parish in this district of Scotland. 

Rental— T\\e rental of the parish amounts to L. 12,000 per 
annum. 

Quarries, Mines, &amp;c. — There are none of these worked in the 
parish ; and the salt manufacture noticed in last account is quite 
neglected, as is the cultivation of flax. 

v.— Parochial Economy. 
The nearest market-town is Stranraer, about six miles distant 
from the church. It is also the nearest post-town ; but, under the 
new post-office regulations, we have a petty office at the village 
beside the kirk, one at Sandhead, and another between that and 
Kirkmaiden, — also an intermediate station between this parish and 
Stranraer. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated about two 
miles from the Bay of Luce. It stands about six miles distant 
from the southern boundary, and nearly the same distance from 
the north-western limits of the parish. Though capable of ac- 
commodating nearly 1000, it is still too limited for the popula- 
tion when the inhabitants are disposed to attend. It was erected 
in 1827. The sittings may be considered as all free. The manse 
was erected about fifty years ago. It since received a new kit-

chen and dining-room, and repairs are still required. The glebe 
is about eight acres in extent. The grain stipend consists of 4 
chalders of meal and 4 chalders of barley. 

The number of families attending the Established Church is 
410; of Dissenting or Seceding families, 74; of Episcopalian fa- 
milies, 2 ; of Roman Catholic families, 10. 

Education. — There are, besides the parochial school, five others 
not endowed. Only the common branches of education are or 
can be taught in the private schools. The branches taught in the 
parochial school are, English, writing, arithmetic, English grammar, 
Latin, Greek, and French, with book-keeping, and practical ma- 
thematics. The rate of wages at the parochial school, which may 
be said to regulate those of the others, is 2s. 6d. per quarter for 
reading English ; 3s. when writing is learnt with it ; 3s. 6d. for 
English grammar and arithmetic ; Latin, Greek, and French, 
with book-keeping, 5s. The parochial schoolmaster's salary is 
L. 25, 13s. 3d. ; and his school fees do not exceed L. 10 a year. 
The number of the young between six and fifteen years of age who 
cannot read or write is 23, and the number above fifteen who can- 
not read or write is 4. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons re- 
ceiving parochial aid amounts to about 60. The amount of contri- 
butions, on an average, may be stated thus : From church collec- 
tions, L. 55 ; legal assessments, L. 58. 

Ale-houses. — There are 5 licensed ale-houses or inns in the 
parish. 

Fuel. — The fuel generally used is peat, cut from mosses on the 

estates of Freugh and Port of Spittal. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The parish presents, undoubtedly, striking changes since the 

date of the Old Account — in the mode of farming, and in the ge- 
neral aspect of the parish. Besides the parochial road from Stran- 
raer to Kirkmaiden, passing through this parish, about eight miles 
along which the mail is carried thrice every week, — another road, 
almost parallel, runs through the western district, and opens a 
communication with Kirkmaiden and Portpatrick on the west. 
These roads are again intersected with three others, which afford 
a communication through the whole parish, and great accommoda- 
tion to the farmers. Still, there is a want of roads in the northern 
district of the parish. The public are in daily expectation of en-

joying the advantages of a new posting car, to ply every lawful day 
between Kirkmaiden and Stranraer. 

Since the time of the old Statistical Account, the rental of 
this parish has been nearly quadrupled.

PRESBYTERY OF WIGTON, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY. 

THE REV. SAMUEL RICHARDSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The origin and import of the name Penninghame 
have been variously explained. The word appears in different 
forms, — Penighame, Penyghame, and Penninghame, and in each 
form sometimes without the final e. Chalmers, in his Caledonia, 
seems unfortunate in his derivation of this name from the Anglo- 
Saxon penig or pening a penny, or penny land, and ham a ham- 
let or village, — the hamlet on the penny land. There has been 
another derivation proposed from the Celtic, pen nan-caem the 
head or hill, or extremity of the ridge, which term is appropriate 
enough to the character of the parish, and the situation of the old 
church. The Rev. Dr M'Leod of St Columba, Glasgow, has no 
doubt that the name is Gaelic, and made up of two words, signify- 
ing either the laud for grazing young cattle, or the penny land the 
lot or portion of the smith. That view of the derivation is sup- 
ported by the circumstance of a pendicle of land, denominated the 
Smith's Croft, Ivingf within a short distance of the ruins of the old 
church. 

Extent. — The average length of the parish of Penninghameis 
nearly 14 miles, and the average breadth about 4. From the 
windings of the rivers which bound it, the breadth is very un- 
equal, so that the average is not easily ascertained with any de- 
gree of accuracy ; and the number of acres on the different farms 
amounts to scarcely the preceding measurement ; but as some of the 
moss and moor pasture has perhaps not been measured very accu- 
rately, the probable average of miles may be as correct an estimate. 

Boundaries. — The parish of Penninghame is bounded on the 
east by the river Cree, whichseparates it from Minnigaff toward 



168 



WIGTONSHIUE. 



the north, and, from Kirkmabreck toward the south. The river 
Cree separates also the county of Wigton from the Stewartry of 
Kirkcudbright; on the south, Penninghame is bounded by the 
parish of Wigton, from which it is divided by the Bishop-burn, to- 
wards the east side ; and towards the west by a small rivulet, which 
rises in .the moorlands and runs into the Bladenoch ; on the south- 
west and west, Penninghame is bounded by Kirkinner and Kirk- 
owen, from which it is separated by the River Bladenoch ; on the 
north, it is bounded by the parish of Colmonell, in Ayrshire. 

The parishes of Penninghame and Wigton occupy the ridge 
formed by the Rivers Bladenoch and Cree; of which ridge about 
four miles from the southern extremity belong to Wigton. 

Topographical Appearances. — Penninghame is much narrower 
towards the northern than towards the southern end ; it increases 
much in breadth below Newtonstewart, particularly where it com- 
prehends the moss of Cree. There is a range of higher land from 
north to south, nearly in the middle of the parish, sloping towards 
the rivers on each side. There are no mountains nor hills of any 
height at all considerable ; and I am not aware that the elevation 
of the higher land above the level of the sea has ever been accu • 
rately ascertained. 

The moss of Cree is a tract of low flat land, on the south-east 
corner of the parish, extending to 1500 or 2000 acres; It is co- 
vered deeply with moss ; but a portion of it on the east side, next 
the river, has been long reclaimed, and produces excellent crops 
of wheat, oats, and beans. Some progress has been made in re- 
claiming the west side also, and with much success. 

Meteorology. — The range of the barometer is from 28 to 30| 
inches. It does sometimes exceed those points, but not often. In 
December 1838, it fell below 28 inches. 

The prevailing winds are from the south, south-east, and south- 
west ; and from those points are the heaviest rains. There are 
sometimes rains from the east of long continuance, but generally 
lighter than those mentioned. 

With the exception of marshy spots, the climate of Penning- 
hame is rather dry, and it is healthful. The air is, upon the 
whole, mild, and the cold in winter is mitigated by the sea breeze. 

Hydrography. — The tide flows up the river Cree. by the side 
of the moss to within a short distance of Newtonstewart. The 
shore is flat and clayey, and the clay is generally covered more or 
less deeply with sand. 



PENNINGHAME. 



169 



There is a harbour at Carty, about a mile and a half below 
Nevvtonstewart, at which vessels of from 35 to 45 tons burden 
arrive regularly ; and occasionally vessels of a larger size arrive. 

The only frith contiguous to the parish of Penninghame is the 
mouth of the River Cree, which flows into the Solway. The 
depth of the water varies, but at ebb-tide it is in no place con- 
siderable. As far as the parish of Penninghame extends, there is 
a current fresh stream, when there is no tide. The degree of sal t- 
ness in the frith is not great, and it is much affected by the floods 
in the River Cree, and the streams which flow into it. 

The current is pretty strong, both on the flowing and ebbing of 
the tide. 

The depth of the water at Carty on the flowing of spring-tides 
is about twelve feet ; sometimes a little more. 

There is nothing remarkable in the springs in this parish, which 
are generally very pure, excepting one, tbat contains so much iron 
as to be useful to invalids in a dry season. Were it duly attend- 
ed to, it might probably be made much more useful. 

There are several small lakes in the north end of this parish, 
without any peculiarities. The loch of Cree is merely a portion 
of the river, which spreads out into a lake of about four miles in 
length ; the breadth is various, but not great in any place. In 
some places, the water is pretty deep. The loch was much larger 
before the cutting of a rock, and deepening of the channel of the 
river, at the bottom of it, about forty years ago. That cutting 
gained a quantity of excellent meadow on each side of the water. 

The ojily rivers contiguous to this parish are the Cree and the 
Bladenoch, which bound it, as has been stated, and unite below 
Wigton. The Bladenoch flows from Loch Mabery on the bor- 
der of Ayrshire, and its course to the Frith of Cree is about twenty- 
four miles in length. The Cree rises in Ayrshire, not far from 
the boundary of this county, and falls into the Solway, after a 
course of about thirty miles. 

Geology, Sj-c. — There are no strata of rocks of any extent in Pen- 
ninghame. The common stone of the parish, the greywacke of 
geologists, exists in several varieties, and is found almost every- 
where. In one place, it is partially stratified, of no uniform dip, 
and of excellent quality for building; it forms walls, beautiful, 
strong, and, with due care, perfectly dry. It occurs in some places 
deeply tinged with iron ore. It is found in great and small quan- 
tities, and is luarried, sometimes with ease, and sometimes with 
considerable difliculty, and at much expense. 



170 



VVIGTONSHlllE. 



Greystone, or Galloway granite, is found in many places of Pen- 
iiinghame, but in masses, not stratified as in the neighbouring parish 
of Kirkmabreck. The masses of granite in this parish are from a few 
pounds to many tons in weight. Sometimes it is found mixed with 
red, and sometimes with green sienite. It is much used in buildina, 
and can be cut with wedges to any dimensions. It is commonly 
used instead of freestone, but when dressed to a smooth surface, it 
becomes expensive, though it forms a beautiful and durable build- 
ing. In common cheap buildings, it is coarsely dressed with picks, 
and in that case the expense is less than that of freestone, — much 
time and labour are necessary for smoothing it with a kind of axe- 
shaped pikes and chissels, made for the purpose. 

The soil of the parish is very various : — by the moss of Cree 
it is heavy, being a clayey loam. The moss itself is deep, and 
rests on clay : it contains trees, but where they grew, or how they 
became imbedded in it, is not known. On the higher land, the 
soil, where improved, is either dry, or may be easily made so, and 
bears good crops, especially barley, oats, turnips, and potatoes. 
The soil is particularly adapted for barley. The subsoil in those 
lands is generally either gravelly or sandy ; sometimes it is a close 
kind of clayey till. In the northern end of the parish, the land is 
much inferior in value, and there is much variety of soils. The 
surface is generally uneven. The larger and smaller eminences 
are dry, while the land among them is frequently wet and marshy. 
A great portion of the parish is capable of being drained, and 
as there are stones to be found very generally, much of it might 
be drained at no great expense. Excepting in the south end of 
the parish, the soil is not in general very deep, and it requires a 
considerable quantity of manure, especially where the subsoil is 
sandy, or of a dry sharp gravel. 

The fields abound with detached masses of stone, as well as 
with small loose stones. The clearing of an acre of those masses, 
some of them several tons in weight, is frequently attended with 
much expense ; but as the fences on the hard land are common- 
ly stone dikes, and as drains are often necessary; the stones may, 
in most instances, be turned to a good account. 

Ichthyology. — Salmon are numerous in the Cree. The dis- 
trict is fully supplied with them, and many are sent to Carlisle and 
Liverpool. The upper part of the river has been carefully pro- 
tected for some years, and the number of fishes has greatly increas- 
ed. Under the term salmon I have comprehended grilse, which 



PENNINGIIAME. 



171 



are very abundant in the advanced |3eriod of the season. The 
fishing season extends from the 1st of January to the 25th of Sep- 
tember. The salmon spawn from the end of November to Janu- 
ary, and the fry begin to run towards the sea in March. There 
are also sea-trouts in the Cree, which are caught in considerable 
numbers in the summer season ; and fresh-water, yellow, or burn- 
trouts, as they are termed, are caught at all times. They are 
found of a larger size, and in great numbers also in the lakes, and in 
the small streams that fall into the Cree from the mountains. Pike 
are numerous in some parts of the river and in the lakes. They 
are believed to be very destructive to other kinds of fish. They are 
not much caught, nor are they highly esteemed. Common eels 
are everywhere in the river and in the lakes, but they are not 
caught, except by boys for amusement. Smelts or spirlins run up 
the Cree in great numbers, particularly in March. Sometimes 
the water at the flow of the tide, about the mixing of the salt and 
the fresh, swarms with them. They are taken in great quantities, 
and many of them are sent to England. 

Botany. — Among the exogenous plants, the natural order Ba- 
nunculacecei besides . the Ficuria, the Caltha, and several species 
of Ranunculus, affords us the smaller meadow-rue  Thalictrum 
minus J, which grows from about a mile northward from Newton- 
stewart, on the bank of the River Cree, up the course of the 
stream to Penninghame House. Of the order NymphcEacecB, we 
have both the white and the yellow water-lilies, NymphcBa alba 
and Nuphar Intea. It may be remarked, that no species of the 
Papaveracece occur here, excepting, perhaps, the larger celandine 
{Chelidonhim majus. I pass over several orders, which present 
nothing uncommon : but I cannot avoid mentioning the Drosera- 
cecB, as furnishing the interesting sun -dew {Drosera rotundifolia, 
and the very curious Parnassia palustris. Of the Polygalece, Ca- 
ryophyllece, Li7iece, Hypericinea;, and Geraniacece, the common 
species are to be found in many places. Besides the common spe- 
cies of Vicia and Lathyrus, the important order Leguminosce pre- 
sents to us the rare and beautiful Orobus sylvestris, which grows 
in small quantity on the bank of the Cree, a little to the north 
of Newtonstewart. Of the Rosacece we possess the common ge- 
nera and species. It is, however, worthy of remark, that the 
Scotch rose Rosa spinosissima is not, so far as I know, to be 
found here, or in any of the contiguous parishes; though it is 
abundant within the Rhinns of Galloway, and on the shores of 



172 



WIGTONSIllllE. 



Mochnimand Luce. The rock-bramble Ruhus saxatilu I have 
seen nowhere in this county but in one spot near the Cree, where 
it displays in autumn its pleasantly acid berries. The orders Ona- 
grariea' and Lythrariece have their representatives in this parish ; 
and species of the numerous order Umbelliferce are but too com- 
mon everywhere. I need scarcely name the CaprifoliacecB and 
the HubiacecB, but to note, that the northern bed-straw Ga- 
lium boreale is abundant on the banks of the Cree, and of the 
neighbouring stream, the Pinkill, in Minnigaff. I pass over the 
Vale rianiecB and the Dipsacea, as offering nothing remarkable. 
To these I may add the great order Composites, the genera of 
which, though numerous, are such only as are found in the great- 
er part of Scotland. The Cumpanulacece and the Ericece are in 
a similar predicament. The most distinguished plant of the order 
BoraginecB is the Omphalodes senipervirem, which exhibits its 
bright blue flowers in one or two places under the hedges on the 
road side. The only plant of the dangerous SolanecB which is 
indigenous in Penninghame is the bitter-sweet {Solanum Dul- 
camara, a deadly poison, but a valuable medicine. It grows 
in a hedge which borders the road leading from Newton- 
stewart to Wigton. The Scrophularinea and Labiafce demand 
no special notice. But the Lentibularice must be mentioned, for 
the sake of the pretty, curious, and rare Pinguicula lusitanica 
Portugal butterwort, a few plants of which may be found in a 
single spot within the parish of Wigton, near the south-western 
boundary of Penninghame. The same species occurs more abun- 
dantly a few miles beyond the western limits of this parish, in 
Kirkowen, on the great road leading to Portpatrick. Of the Mo- 
nochlamydeous plants, the most interesting orders to be found 
here are the Chenopodea3 and the Polygonece. The former af- 
fords us, besides the common species, the curious and useful Che- 
nopodium bonus- Hemicus good Henry, which grows only on 
the sides of the road which leads from the hamlet of Penning- 
hame to the main road leading to Wigton. The most interesting 
species of the Polygonew is the Polygonum Bistorfa Bistort or 
snake-root, which is found, not in this parish, but in Minnigaff, 
on the eastern bank of the Pinkell, a little way below Cumlodun 
cottage. Of the endogenous orders the most remarkable is the 
OrchidecE, the most frequent of which are the Orchis macula- 
ta, which adorns our moist meadows with its bright spotted leaves 
and its tufts of purple flowers; the Platantliera bifolio, the deli- 



PENNINGIIAME.

cate smell of which is dissipated by the sun, and is therefore sen- 
sible only in the morning and evening ; and the Gymnadenia co- 
7iopsea, which at all hours impregnates the air with its grateful 
odour. The other orders of this great division of plants do not 
seem to call for particular remark. 

There are no forests in the parish, but there are several plan- 
tations ; of the latter the greater part is not very old. Trees of 
many kinds are planted: the most common are, larch, Scotch 
pine, Norway spruce, oak, ash, and elm. On the dry land, the 
larch, Scotch pine, and trees of the spruce species, with oak, ash, 
elm, and beech, grow well. Evergreens of all kinds grow on damp 
ffround, when the stagnant water has been drained off. Some of 
the plantations are on land not very valuable for other purposes ; 
and even on the high cold exposed parts of the parish, the trees 
soon form a shelter to one another, and grow more quickly than 
could be expected. The effect of the~ shelter afforded by them 
becomes very soon perceptible on the adjoining fields. It is pro- 
bable that there was a little natural wood near to the River Cree 
in the northern end of the parish, but the ground on which it must 
have grown seems all to have been planted. 

II. — Civil History. 

I have not learned that any authenticated historical events of 
importance have occurred in Penninghame. There are traces of 
a battle having been fought at Killiemore, not far from the tomb 
of King Galdus, in the neighbouring parish of Wigton ; but what 
credit we should give to the history of that personage 1 do not pre- 
sume to determine. 

Eminent Characters. — Penninghame was the usual residence of 
the Bishops of Galloway, so that in one sense the persons, some 
of them very eminent, who successively held that see, may be re- 
garded as having been connected with this parish {Symson, p. 38. 
But the celebrated Bishop Alexander Gordon, titular Archbishop 
of Athens, who died in 1576, was connected with this parish by 
being proprietor of the estate of Clary, afterwards the seat and 
still the property of the noble family of Galloway, which estate 
he conferred on his only daughter, who was married to Anthony 
Stewart, Rector of Penninghame.  Gordon's History of the House 
of Gordon. Murray's Literay History of Galloway, 2d. edition, p 
40. 

But Penninghame has produced more than one distinguish- 
ed character in more modern times. The Rev. Robert Rowan, 



174 



WIGTONSIIIRE. 



the first cler/2fyman of the parish after the final establishment of 
Presbytery as the national religion in 1690, was an eminent man 
in his time. He was the friend and correspondent of Wodrow, 
the historian of the Church, to whom he communicated minute 
accounts of the heavy persecutions inflicted on the parish of Pen- 
ninghame, both as respected life and property; which accounts, 
while they appear in an abbreviated form in the work of that ce- 
lebrated historian, Rowan also engrossed in the parish records, 
where they still remain. Rowan seems to have acted an emi- 
nent part as a member of the church courts ; and several learn- 
ed letters are addressed to him by the Rev. James Webster of 
Edinburgh, respecting the alleged heresy of John Simson, Pro- 
fessor of Theology in the College of Glasgow, whose case was so 
long before the ecclesiastical courts, and who was ultimately sus- 
pended from his office on account of having taught erroneous doc- 
trme. A correspondence was also carried on between Rowan and 
Simson, on the same subject. Rowan died in 1714. 

The Rev. John Miller, minister of this parish from 1716 to 
1746, had a son, George, who attained to considerable eminence. 
Having been settled as a planter in Virginia, he attached himself 
to the cause of the Royalists on the breaking out of the American 
Revolution in 1775. He was, in consequence, obliged to leave 
the country, and to forfeit his whole property. But on the return 
of peace, the English government, aware both of his eminent abili- 
ties, and of the sacrifices he had made, appointed him successively 
British Consul at Charleston, South Carolina, and Consul-Ge- 
neral for the whole of the United States. He died in 1798. 

But perhaps the most distinguished person that Penninghame 
ever produced was the late Dr William M'Gill, one of the ministers 
of Ayr, and author of "A Practical Essay on the Death of Jesus 
Christ." Dr M'Gill was born of respectable parents at Carsenestock, 
in this parish, in the year 1731. His " Practical Essay," being sup- 
posed to inculcate principles both of an Arianand Socinian character, 
created a strong sensation, not only among the orthodox clergy of 
the Established Church, but also among Dissenters. Various pam- 
phlets were published in answer to the work ; and not a few clergymen 
thought it their duty to" wara their hearers from the pulpit against 
its pernicious tendency. The whole west of Scotland, indeed, was 
involved in a religious ferment, which was perhaps heightened 
by the wanton attacks of the poet Burns. At last the matter 
was brought before the church courts. Dr M'Gill at first strenuous- 



PENNINGIIAME. 



173 



ly defended the soundness of his views, and at the same time, en- 
deavoured to prove that these views were not hostile to, or incompa- 
tible with, the doctrine taught in the Confession of Faith. Ulti- 
mately, however, for the sake of peace, and finding that farther 
contention might lead to results not very agreeable to himself, he 
was induced to make such an explanation and apology as were sa- 
tisfactory to the synod of Glasgow and Ayr, before which court 
the case was at the time undergoing trial. It may be mentioned 
that no question, agitated in modern times before our eccle- 
siastical courts, ever excited so intense and general an interest 
as that of which we have been speaking. The " Essay" in ques- 
tion was the only large work of which Dr M'Gill was the author; 
but he published several detached sermons ; and contributed two 
excellent discourses to The Scotch Preacher. He died in 1807, in 
the seventy-sixth year of his age. 

The late Rev. William Macartney, minister of Old Kirkpatrick, 
in the presbytery of Dunbarton, was born at Mains of Penninghame 
in 1762. His father rented that farm, and carried on at the same 
time the business of a corn-miller. Mr Macartney, who was an emi- 
nent classical scholar, as well as asuperior maninother respects, pub- 
lished in 1798 the best translation that has yet appeared of Cicero 
de Officiis. He accompanied his translation with copious notes, 
which, however, are rather ethical and biographical than critical. 
He died in 1828. Murray's Literary/ History of Galloioay. 
Mr Macartney had a brother, not less eminent than himself, but 
in a different department of hfe, namely, the late Mr Alexander 
Macartney, long Manager of the Commercial Banking Company 
of Scotland, — a gentleman whose knowledge as to the science of 
money and of banking subjects generally, was inferior to that of 
no individual of his time. He died in the month of December 
1838, in the seventy-second year of his age. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners are, the Earl of Gal- 
loway and James Blair, Esq. who possess about sixteen-seven- 
teenths of the parish, in valuation. 

Parochial Registers. — Parochial registers of births, baptisms, 
and proclamations for marriages, with the exception of a short pe- 
riod in last century, have been kept with considerable regularity. 
The oldest entry is 17th October 1696. The records extend to 
six volumes of different sizes, and these volumes contain a full 
and distinct state of the receipts and disbursements of the parish 



176 



WIGTONSHIRE. 



funds, with the names of the persons who have received parish aid 
since 1696, excepting during the period already mentioned. 

■Antiquities, — About five miles north of Newtonstewart are the 
ruins of a chapel, which was built in 1508, by John Kennedy of 
Blairquhan, who dedicated it to St Ninian, and endowed a chap- 
lainry for the celebration of divine service in it, with an annual rent 
of L. 8, 10s. from the barony of Alloway. This was confirmed by 
the King's charter, 20th June 1508.— See Caledonia, Vol. iii. 
page 435. 

About three miles farther north, along the right bank of the 
river Cree, was the more ancient Kery or Keir chapel, of which 
I have not been able to find any ruins. But there is a place very 
near the spot on which that chapel stood, named Kirkhoble, or, 
as pronounced, Kirkhapel, or Kirkhapple ; and there is another 
place not distant, named Glenhapple, or, as almost uniformly pro- 
nounced Glenhapples, — which circumstances lead me to suppose, 
that the chapel distinctly mentioned by Chalmers, at the head of 
the Loch of Cree, may have been dedicated in honour of Saint 
Hippolytus. There are two saints of that name in the Calendar, 
one of them the tutor of Orien. 

The ruins of the old parish church, and a burying-ground, are 
about three miles south of Newtonstewart, at the Clauchan of 
Penninghame, which contains now but few houses. The old 
church was dedicated in honour of Saint Ninian. When Symson 
wrote his " Large Description," &amp;c. there was at the church of 
Penninghame, a bell with the following inscription, in Saxon let- 
ters, " Campana Sancti Niniani de Penigham, M." from which 
he supposes that it had been dedicated in honour of the saint 
A. D. 1000. 

When James IV. passed through Penninghame on the 7th 
March 1506-7, on a pilgrimage a-foot to Whithorn, he gave at 
the Clauchan of Penninghame a donation of 9s. to a man that 
bore St Ninian's bell. From that circumstance, the author of 
Caledonia concludes that it was an hand-bell. That conjecture 
is almost confirmed by another circumstance. Very near to the 
ruins of the old church is a small knoll, still denominated the " bell 
knowe." On that eminence, it seems most probable the man stood, 
and rang the bell at the fixed hours. 

There are still some remains of the house of Clary, anciently 
called Clachary ; and the garden, at least the fruit-trees in it, still 
continue to produce crops. 



PENMNGHA.MK.

About three miles north from Newtonstevvart are the ruins of 
Castle Stewart, which was the residence of the Stewarts of Castle 
Stewart. The youngest brother of the Earl of Galloway, about 
the end of the seventeenth century, married the heiress of Castle 
Stewart, grand-daughter of Colonel William Stewart. 

The property was, for some time, in the possession of the Earl of 
Galloway, But about thirteen years ago, it was purchased by James 
Blair, Esq. whose residence, Penninghame House, is about half a 
mile from the ruins of the old castle, near to the River Cree, 
beautifully situated at the southern extremity of the Loch of Cree. 

Coins have been found at different times and on one occasion 
the quantity was considerable on the west side of the parish, — 
near to Killiemore, already mentioned as the place on which there 
are traces of a battle having been fought. The coins are old, 
but I have never been able to procure any on which the inscrip- 
tion was legible, or on which any distinct traces of their precise 
age coifld be observed. 

In Killiemore there are many graves about which nothing is 
known. It is not a burying-ground, nor was it at any period, so 
far as can be ascertained. I am not aware that any of the graves 
have been opened or carefully examined. 

The following notices have been obhgingly contributed by Jo- 
seph Train, Esq. Castle Douglas. 

" The head of a Roman spear, nine inches in length, was dug up 
in the year 1813, at Merton Hall, in Penninghame parish, where 
the military road passes from Newtonstewart to Glenluce. This 
ancient weapon is now in the possession of Dr Black of Bolton, 
formerly of Newtonstewart. 

" A Roman battle-axe was found in the moss of Cree in 1818, 
resembling exactly that represented in Gough's Camden, Vol. iv. 
Plate 7, Fig. 9. I presented this relic to Sir Walter Scott, and 
afterwards saw it in the museum at Abbotsford. 

" A granite celt was dug up in the moor of Knockbrax, at least 
eight feet below the surface of the ground. I supposed it at first 
to be of freestone of fine quality, although its weight, which is 
7 lbs. 9 oz., might have convinced me that this was a mistake. 
However, on perforating the side with a chissel, the real quality of 
the stone gradually became more evident, as the point of the in- 
strument receded from the surface, till at last I found it to be of 
the hardest granite. This leads me to suppose that the exterior 
texture of this ancient weapon of war has been changed by the 

WIGTO N. M

WIGTONSHIRE. 



great length of time it must have remained in the moss. After 
having communicated these particulars to Mr Chalmers, he re- 
plied, " I have seen only one celt discovered in Ireland, but there 
have been several discovered in Britain. From this and other 
circumstances, I am inclined to infer that the settlement of Ire- 
land is much later than that of Britain, whatever General Vallency 
may say." I sent this stone celt also to Sir Walter Scott. I 
think he alludes to it in his Border Antiquities. 

" The Celtic people of very early times left other remains, which 
lay open to us some of their modes of life. Canoes resembling 
those used by the savages of America have been found in the 
Carlinwark Lake and in Loch Doon. In the moss of Barnkirk, 
in the immediate neighbourhood of Newtonstewart, a canoe was 
found about the year 1814 made of a single log. Mr M'Millan, 
writer in Newtonstewart, being then the occupant of Barnkirk, 
caused this singular remnant of antiquity to be made into the lintel 
of the door of a cart-shed on the farm of Barnkirk, where it may 
yet be seen. Part of the sides are cut away, but the hold of the 
canoe is yet about ten inches deep, and nineteen inches in breadth. 
When entire it appears to have been four or five inches broader 
at the top. The length of the hold is seven feet six inches ; the 
bow and stern seem to have been a little rounded, and the mark 
of the axe or chissel, by which the log was hollowed, is seen, parti- 
cularly at each end, where the grain of the wood is cut across. 

" I saw a ball of fat, or bannock of tallow, weighing 27 lbs., that 
was found in the moss of Barnkirk immediately over the canoe, 
at least six feet from the surface, by people casting peats there. 

" It is a remarkable fact, that, in the small valley of Barnair, there 
are 49 cairns placed in regular order. That in the centre is 30 
feet in diameter. The others are only 25 feet in diameter each. 
That a great battle was fought there, may be reasonably suppos- 
ed; but at what period, and by whom, is now wholly unknown." 

Modern Buildings. — The present church of Penninghame was 
built in 1777. It is in a very insufficient state, and it is very in- 
adequate to the accommodation of the people ; a great part of the 
village of Newtonstewart having risen since the church was built. 
A contract has been entered into by the heritors for a new church, 
suitable to the present amount of the population, on an elegant 
plan furnished by William Burn, Esq. architect, Edinburgh,— ex- 
pense about L. 5000. The church now standing is a very plain

building, in the village of Newton Stewart, affording by no means 
suitable accommodation. 

Penninghame House, the residence of James Blair, Esq. is 
about four miles north of Newtonstewart, on the border of the 
river Cree, as already mentioned. — Merton Hall, belonging to 
Edward Boyd, Esq. is about two miles from Newtonstewart, near 
the road to Glenluce. — Corsbie, belonging to the Earl of Gal- 
loway, is very near Newtonstewart ; and Corrisel, belonging to 
Captain John M'Kerlie, R. N. a few hundred yards from it, on the 
road to Wigton. 

There are two mills for grain in the parish, but no manufactory. 

There is a town-hall in Newtonstewart, and under it a lock-up- 
house, for the temporary confinement of those who transgress the 
laws. The buildings here specified are all of stone, blue or whin- 
stone trap, and the rybats, lintels, &amp;c. of granite or freestone. 
The wood used in building is generally American red or yellow 
pine ; and in some of the older houses it is from the Baltic. 
Larch and other firs are used in farm-steadings occasionally, but 
not in houses of any considerable size.

The population of Penninghame was much increased by the esta- 
blishment of a cotton-mill in the end of the last century ; and it has 
continued to be increased by the demand for labourers in the pro- 
gress of agricultural improvement. Many families from Ireland, 
travelling in quest of work, on getting temporary employment, fre- 
quently settle here. We have had some emigration of late years, 
but not so extensive as to affect perceptibly the amount of popula- 
tion. The persons emigrating have not been generally of the 
poorest class.

Character, Sfc. of the People, — The habits of the Scotch and Irish 
portions of the population are very different. The Scotch are gene- 
rally provident, endeavouring to promote the comfort of themselves 
and their families ; and many of them show a desire to live within 
their incomes, even when very small. They show also almost uni- 
formly a desire to have their children clothed and educated. The 
Irish come to this parish in great poverty ; and, in general, seem but 
little desirous of making provision for the future. They do not pay 
much attention, in many instances, to clothing, either for themselves 
or for their children ; and having commonly but very little instruction 
themselves, they are certainly not very attentive to the education 
of their families. But after having been some time in this country, 
their habits change frequently very much, and they acquire a relish 
for comfort, and pursue the only means of attaining it. There are in- 
stances of some of them having become saving and comfortable in no 
long time ; but in too many cases, they retain the habits which they 
bring with them. Upon the whole, the people do enjoy, in a 
reasonable degree, the comforts and advantages of society. They 
were apparently, in a great measure, contented with their situa- 
tion and circumstances, showing, at the same time, a laudable de- 
sire to improve them, previously to the excitement produced by the 
Reform Bill : but since that time there have been evident symp- 
toms of discontent and disappointment, and much more in the 
village than in the country. The people in their respective sta- 
tions are, upon the whole, well informed; and their moral cha- 
racter stands high. In the landward part of the parish, there 
is much attention paid to the observance of religious duties ; and 
very little avowed neglect of religious ordinances. In the village. 



PliNNINGHAMl. 



181 



thouo-h there is not the attention paid to these matters that could 
be wished, there is not much avowed neglect. The frequent 
shifting of the population in Newtonstewart diminishes much the 
influen°ce of pastoral superintendence on part of the population. 
The great distance from the parish church in some cases, and the 
want of due accommodation, render the attendance at church less 
than it would otherwise be. The want of suitable clothing, too, 
is not unfrequently pled as an excuse for absence from public wor- 
ship. But the two last assigned causes— want of accommodation, 
and indifferent clothing— have been met by an additional service 
in the church at six o'clock on Sabbath evening ; at which the 
attendance is very respectable, and increasing. 

Poaching in game is carried on to a great extent, and is de- 
cidedly a most demoralizing practice. Facilities seem to have been 
given to poaching by the act authorizing the sale of game ; and the 
temptations are increased by the ready steam communication with 
England. Poaching in this parish brings uniformly both indivi- 
duals and their families to misery and ruin. It is believed that there 
is now very little poaching in the salmon- fisheries. The rivers are 
carefully watched. 

Smuggling has for a long time decreased in this parish, and 
is now scarcely known. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — 

Number of acres imperial, cultivated or occasionally in tillage, about 12,000 

that have never been cultivated, about - 20,000 

of meadow, about - - - 1600 

Besides the preceding, there is a great number of acres of moss, 
of which I am not able to procure any accurate measurement. 
From the size of the parish, as already calculated in miles, there 
are about 4000 acres of moss, lakes, roads, &amp;c. and that quantity 
corresponds nearly with the conjectural measurement. 

Of the acres in pasture that might be cultivated with advantagej 
there are about 1200 marked in the returns from the far- 
mers ; but I am satisfied that much more of that land might be im- 
proved by being ploughed and laid down in grass, to remain in 
pasture. Some of the meadow land would carry good crops of 
grain, but it is more profitable in the present state. What- por- 
tion of the moss might be improved profitably, it is impossible to 
state. There is no land in this parish in a state of undivided com- 
mon. There are about 600 acres under wood. There is little 



182 



WIGTONSHIRE. 



natural wood. Any trees that may be considered indigenous are 
oak ; but I am disposed to believe that they have all, at some pe- 
riod, been planted. 

The management of woods is now good, — much more attention 
being paid to them than was paid formerly. The use of saw-mills 
enables the proprietors to turn the produce easily, and at very mo- 
derate expense, into money. Thinning, felling, and pruning are 
practised judiciously. With respect to forest trees, there seems 
to be less and less pruning. 

Re7it of Land. — The average rent of land in this parish, it is not 
easy to state. About Newtonstewart, the average rent is from L. 3 
to L. 2 per Scotch acre, as the land is near the village ; and the land 
decreases in value, in proportion as it is farther from the village ; 
though the introduction of bone manure has certainly caused the 
rent of land to be less affected by that circumstance than it was. 
The loamy arable land near the Moss of Cree is rented at from 
L. 1, 10s. to L. 2 per Scotch acre. In the upper, or north end, and 
west side of the parish, the arable land is worth considerably less in 
general. The rent of the arable land attached to sheep-walks is not 
known ; it is valued merely as an accommodation to the families in 
the farms ; the value of which is calculated from the sheep and 
cattle grazed on them. In these farms, the dependence is on hay for 
winter fodder for the cattle, — not on straw, to agreat extent. As the 
farms are valued from the stocks which they are capable of maintain- 
ing, less attention is paid to their exact contents in acres ; and the 
precise number of acres in some of the high-lying rough sheep- 
walks, comprehending, in some cases, large portions of moss, I be- 
lieve, may not have been ascertained. 

The average rent of grazing an ox or cow for a year is from 
L. 4 to L. 5 ; a ewe or full-grown sheep from 3s. 6d. to 7s., accord- 
ing to the size of the animal, and the quality of the pasture. The 
rent mentioned does not include dry fodder for the ox or cow 
during winter, which may cost nearly as much. The price of hay 
varies greatly according to the season ; probably, on an average, 
excluding a year of particular scarcity, the price of rye-grass hay 
may be stated at 6d. for twenty-six pounds, and of bog hay, 4d. 
for the same quantity. There is not much straw sold, as the 
tenants generally are not allowed to remove it from the land 
which they occupy. 

Wages. — The average rate of labour is about Is. 4d, or Is. 6d. per 
day in summer, and Is. 2d. in winter, varying, however, according to 



riSNNINGHAME. 



183 



the demand. Cutting peats and mowing are generally had at 2s. 6d. 
per day. Artisans commonly work in their oWn houses now, and 
charge for the work done. There are, however, still a few excep- 
tions, and their wages are from 2s. to 2s. 6d. per day for wrights ; 
and from 2s. 6d. to 3s. for masons. 

Live-Stock.—ThQ sheep of the original breed have been men- 
tioned, and they still constitute the stocks of the sheep-farms : but 
sheep of the Leicester, Cheviot, and other breeds have been in- 
troduced into the parish, particularly into the south end ; and 
they seem to be increasing in number. Cattle of the Galloway 
breed are over the whole parish, and much attention has been paid 
to the improving of them. There are some Irish cattle in this 
parish, by which the original breed is in some places affected. 
Kyle cows have also been introduced, particularly near to New- 
tonstewart. They are considered preferable, when milk is the 
principal object in keeping them. The pasture seems to suit them 
very well, and the management of them is beginning to be well 
understood. In this district, the object formerly was to rear cat- 
tle. There is much more attention paid to dairy produce since cat- 
tle became of less value, ,and of course did not pay the farmer so 
well. 

Husbandry. — The general character of the husbandry pursued 
is good. Infold and hfe leases, the tenants are commonly left much 
at hberty in the management of their farms ; but these leases are 
now not many in number ; and in all recent leases, the rotation of 
crops is distinctly specified, and strictly observed, — though there 
may be some small deviations permitted in particular circum- 
stances. The common and most approved rotation is one grain 
crop oats, though two are frequently allowed, a green crop, 
a grain crop, and the land sown with rye-grass and clover, &amp;c. 
to lie in pasture for a longer or shorter period according to the 
number of fields, and other circumstances of the farm. A crop of 
barley is most common after a green crop. The system of hus- 
bandry would be improved by cleaning the land better, — in many 
cases, by ploughing deeper, — and by more care in making the fields 

Improvements. — There has been some improvement in reclaim- 
ing waste moss land. One tenant has reclaimed about seventy acres 
on the west side of the Moss of Cree. The land was worth about 
3s. 6d. a year per acre. Improved, at the present low rate of value, 
it is worth about L. 1 a year per acre Scotch. The expense of im- 



184 



WI&amp;TONSHIRE. 



provement was about L. 8, 8s. per acre Scotch. But the expense 
of improving more land in the same place will not be the same in 
proportion, as the large drains necessary have been made. 

Improvement has been made in the system of draining ; but 
many are not duly aware of its importance, and are doubtful of a 
return for the money expended in such operations. 

There have been in this parish, some specimens of deep drain- 
ing nine and ten feet deep of late years, attended by the most 
obvious and most beneficial effects. In general, we have no want 
of declivities, so that draining to a common moderate depth af 
from two to four feet is not attended with much difficulty, except 
from the numerous lumps of stone under the surface. The ex- 
pense of breaking or raising the stones, however, is, in a great 
measure, compensated, sometimes more than compensated, by 
their use in building, and covering the drains when cut. For the 
clayey land, in which there are no stones, tiles can be procured in 
the parish at a moderate expense. Upon the whole, draining in 
this parish is not an improvement of an expensive description ; in 
comparison with other parts of the country. I am convinced, that, 
by deeper and better draining than has been generally practised, 
much of the pasture land might be rendered greatly more valuable. 

Irrigation has been but little practised ; and there is reason to 
believe, that in some parts of the parish, it might be productive 
of much advantage at a very moderate expense ; but as the water 
is in general so pure, that advantage would be less than in other 
circumstances. Embankments have been made, of late years, to a 
considerable extent on the lands of the Earl of Galloway, against 
the tide and the River Cree ; and there is the prospect of land 
being not only saved but gained by them. 

In the lower southern part of the parish, the land is generally 
enclosed, the greater portion of it by stone-dikes, which gives ra- 
ther the appearance of bareness and coldness to the district. There 
are hedges also, particularly in the wet clayey land, in which stones 
are scarce. In many places, it is very convenient to use the stones 
dug out in cleaning the fields, for dikes. In the sheep-farms, the 
march dikes are all of stone, as are also the division fences on the 
portions cultivated for the convenience of the families resident on 
the farms. 

Leases, — Leases are of nineteen, twelve, and nine years dura- 
tion. In most cases in which improvement is expected or agreed 
to, the leases are of nineteen years ; and, indeed, that term is com- 



rENNINGIIAME. 



185 



mon througliout the parish. The shorter leases, for the most part, 
are given for the fields, and small portions near the village. The 
leases are commonly favourable to the occupiers ; but there are 
cases certainly in which too much rent is offered. That evil, and 
a great evil it is,' arises from competition among the offerers ; and, 
instead of being beneficial, it is injurious to proprietors, as well as 
to tenants, because when the tenant's means are diminishing or 
exhausted, improvement or even good management of a farm can- 
not be expected. 

The farm-buildings have been improved much of late years, and 
in general they are now good, substantial, and suitable to the farms. 

The enclosures are in general adapted to the size of the farms ; 
at least in all improvements, that adaptation is contemplated. The 
fences are various in kind and quality ; those made at present, or 
that have been made lately, are high and sufficient for any pur- 
pose ; but the old fences are, in many cases, low, and by no means 
strong. Some of them consist, in a great measure, of a single row 
of stones or little more piled on one another to a small height, 
and they soon become nearly as useless as they are ugly. The 
appearance of the. country would be greatly improved by the in- 
troduction of hedge-rows, instead of stone dikes generally. 

Great improvement has been made within the last twenty years 
by adopting a regular and better rotation of crops, and by better 
management of stock and farms generally, and also by draining, 
especially by introducing tiles for drains. Ploughing and all farm 
work are now done in a much better style than formerly, and the 
produce of the land has increased in proportion. 

The embankments made by the Earl of Galloway form one of the 
principal improvements at present ; and the effect may be expected 
to become soon very apparent. When completed, the quantity of 
land recovered may amount to about 100 acres ; and it is contem- 
plated to extend the operations greatly. The quantity of land that 
may be recovered still, is supposed to be about 800 acres. 

The tenant in Baltersan, Mr John Hewetson, has reclaimed 
some valuable land from the moss of Cree, to which reference has 
already been made. He first made a deep drain along the edge 
of the moss, which intercepts the water from the higher land. The 
moss having been by that means dried, becomes fit for being dug 
and ploughed. The quantity reclaimed by him is about 70 acres. 

Improvement is not impeded by the want of capital generally ; 



186 



WIGTONSHIRE. 



and the proprietors are disposed to give all reasonable encourage- 
ment to industrious and enterprising tenants. 

The constant excitement about the corn laws, and the uncer- 
tain state in which they are believed to be, are considered to be 
most unfriendly to improvement. 

Quarries.~The only quarries in the parish are those of com- 
mon bluestone greywacke already mentioned, as used in building 
houses; and there is nothing particular in the manner of working 
these quarries. 

Fisheries, — There is a salmon-fishing in the river Cree, and 
also in the river Bladenoch ; and in both rivers, spirlings are caught 
in spring and autumn ; sometimes they are caught in small num- 
bers at other seasons. The rent of the fishings belonging to Pen- 
ninghame amounts to about L. 100 per annum. 

Manufactures. — In the end of last century, a manufactory for cot- 
ton was erected in this parish, at Newtonstewart, by Douglas, Dale, 
and Co., at an expense of above L. 20,000. It was erected particu- 
larly for spinning, but with the view of extending the work to weav- 
ing, &amp;c. in the village. The speculation did not succeed well, and af- 
ter a few years it was given up. In 1826, the premises were pur- 
chased by Lord Garlies for about five per cent, of the original cost. 
The houses have all been taken down ; the materials of the mill, 
&amp;c. were partly sold, and partly used in building farm-houses. 
The dwelling-houses, with three acres of the feu on which the 
mill stood, became the property of the Douglas Trustees, having 
been presented to them by the present Earl of Galloway, fes a 
site for the Douglas School ; and the materials of the houses were 
sold for the benefit of the Doufflas funds. 

The weaving of cotton still continues to be carried on in 
this parish, but not to a great extent; and it is rather diminish- 
ing. The webs come from Glasgow to agents in Newton- 
stewart, and the weavers have looms in their own houses, or hire 
them in some neighbour's house, at a weekly rent of about 8d. 
or 6d. The carriage from and to Glasgow forms a deduction 
from the payment, that is felt considerably, when the rate is low. 
In general, the trade does not remunerate very well those employed 
in it. The establishment of the cotton manufactory increased the 
number of paupers, and did not produce any permanent benefit 
to the parish. 

There is now no regular manufactory in this parish. The trades- 
men do not generally extend their work beyond the demands of 



PENNINGHAME. 



187 



the district. Perhaps tanning and currying leather may form a 

limited exception. 

Navigation.— river Cree is navigable for small vessels to 
Carty, within about a mile of Newtonstewart ; and the parish is 
dependent on ship-carriage for lime, freestone, and coals. Mer- 
chant goods and other commodities are now generally brought by 
the same kind of conveyance. 

Vessels of 70 and 80 tons can sail to the port of Carty with 
spring-tides ; but the vessels which commonly sail into it are from 
35 to 45 tons burden. The steam-boat that plies between the 
Frith of Cree and Liverpool, has sailed to Carty ; but the windings 
of the river form an objection in point of time. There is no other 
navigable river in the parish. 

Societies. — There are a Horticultural and an Agricultural So- 
ciety in the parish. But they were instituted two or three years 
ago only, and there has not been sufficient time for judging 
what their effects may be. There is reason to hope that they 
may be beneficial. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Towns. — The only market-town in this parish is New- 
tonstewart, the population of which in 1831 was 2241 ; and there 
is every reason for believing, that the population is very nearly 
the same in amount at present. Newtonstewart has not been very 
long in reaching its present extent. The first feu-contract is dat- 
ed 1701. 

As has been stated, very little trade on a scale at all extensive 
is carried on in Newtonstewart. Bacon curing has been practised 
since 1830, to the great benefit of the district. Perhaps, on an 
average, from L. 5000 to L. 6000 a-year have been expended by 
the curers. The wool trade has been carried on for some years 
also, by people m Newtonstewart ; but how much has been pur- 
chased on commission, how much on personal risk, I have not 
ascertained. 

The police of the county of Wigton has this year been al- 
tered and extended. An officer with a salary now resides in 
Newtonstewart; and it is contemplated, that he shall have an 
assistant. For a few years, an officer has been paid by the 
heritors and others, with a small allowance from the county. 
From the situation of Newtonstewart, on the great road from 
London to Portpatrick, where it is intersected by the road from 



188 



WIGTONSHtllE. 



Ayr to Wigton, the place is rather a convenient resort for those 
who are disposed to disturb the public peace. 

There is no other market-town in the parish, nor any other 
village of any extent. 

Post-Offices.-~T\\evQ is a post-office in Newtonstewart, which 
accommodates an extensive district. A letter-carrier has just 
been appointed by the post-office, for delivering letters, free of ex- 
pense, to the inhabitants of the village. 

Means of Communication.— The turnpike road from the Cree 
to the Bladenoch is about five miles long, and that from Newton- 
stewart to the High Bridge of Cree is about nine miles long, to 
the bridge at which it crosses the river, and enters the stewartry 
of Kirkcudbrio-ht. 

We have excellent parish roads in Penninghame, on which 
there are no tolls. These roads extend in different directions, 
and together may be in length about thirty miles. The roads 
were formerly made of gravel, the quality of which in some places 
IS sharp and good ; but the turnpike roads have now been all Ma- 
cadamized, and the others are in the course of being Macadamized. 

One mail-coach passes and repasses daily, along the London 
and Portpatrick road ; another goes to Portpatrick and returns, 
by the Mahars daily, Sundays excepted ; and a mail-gig runs daily, 
Sundays excepted, to and from Girvan. 

There are regular carriers to Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dumfries, 
the south end of the county, Stranraer and Girvan. 

There are good bridges over the Cree and the Bladenoch, 
and over the rivulets on the roads through the parish. The bridge 
over the Cree at Newtonstewart is elegant and substantial, built 
of granite, with a freestone parapet. A bridge nearly on the 
same place was destroyed by a flood in the beginning of the 
present century. There is a new bridge on the same line of 
road, over the Bladenoch, not yet quite finished, instead of the 
very old one, a little higher on the river. The bridges on the pa- 
rish roads over the rivulets are good generally, and in a good state 
of repair. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situate in the vil- 
lage of Newtonstewart, — conveniently for the great body of the 
population, but it is at a very inconvenient distance from the 
extremities of the parish. The present church was built in 
1777, and is in a very indiff'erent state of repair; but a new 
church, adequate to the attending population, has been contracted 



IM'NNINGIIAMK. 



189 



for by the heritors, and preparations afo now making for building 

The present church affords accommodation for about 700 sit- 
ters ; it was calculated to hold 750, but too little room was allow- 
ed. There are about 25 free sittings. The rents of the let seats 
are low : some of them Is. a year only. 

The manse is a house that was built by the present mcumbent 
in 1828; and it was purchased, and made a manse by the heri- 
tors, with concurrence of the presbytery, in March last. The 
glebe contains nearly 12 acres Scotch, and when let was rent- 
ed fit L. 22, 17s. 2d. The stipend is 16 chalders, half meal, half 
barley, with L. 10 communion element money. 

There is a church or chapel built lately in the parish of Min- 
nigaff, which will accommodate a portion of the northern end of 
this parish. A district has not yet been regularly assigned to it. 
The church was built by subscription, and arrangements are in 
progress for building a manse in the same way. The preacher 
for there is regular public worship is paid by the heritors and 
people. The greater part of his salary of L. 50 is paid by the Earl 
of Galloway, and James Blair, Esq. of Penninghame. 

There is a church belonging to the Relief, and another to the 
Reformed Presbytery in Newtonstewart. But I am not informed 
how the ministers are paid, nor what is the amount of their stipends. 

There is also in the parish a Roman Catholic Chapel, and the 
bishop resides in Glasgow. 

The number of persons professedly belonging to the Establish-, 
ed Church is 2728 : families about 530. The number of Dissent- 
ers of all denominations, including Roman Catholics, is 833. The 
discrepancy between the sum of those and the census 1831, arises 
from a colony of above twenty families, established in the parish, 
on the small allotment system, since that date. Number of Dis- 
senters and Seceders, 640 ; professed Episcopalians, 9 ; Roman 
Catholics, IQii. 

Divine service in the Established Church, considering the cir- 
cumstances of the parish, is well attended. 

The average number of communicantsat the Established Church 
is rather above 700. 

There is a Society for religious purposes managed by Dissenters, 
of the funds of which I have no knowledge. There is also a Society 
for the distribution of tracts religious, supported by subscrip- 
tion, and a collection in church when necessary. Under the 
management of the kirk-session, there is a Sunday school, and also

a regular distribution of Bibles to the poor : for which objects, col- 
lections are made in church, when necessary. There is a library 
for the benefit of the Sunday scholars of Penninghame and 
Mninigaff in common. The library is kept in MinnigaflF. 

The average amount of collections in church for religious and 
charitable purposes, besides the weekly collections for the poor, 
during four years, was very nearly L. 10 a year. 

Education, — There are nine schools in this parish ; one pa- 
rochial, three endowed, and the rest unendowed. All the branches 
commonly taught in parochial schools are taught in these, ex- 
cepting the female schools, which are confined to the branches 
generally comprehended in female education. There is an infant 
school about to be opened on an endowment by the Earl of Gal- 
loway. The parochial schoolmaster has the legal salary of L. 34, 
4s. 4d. and the legal accommodation of house and garden. Of 
the endowed schools, one has a salary of ten pounds a year from 
the Earl of Galloway, with a school-room and dwelling-house rent 
free. Another was endowed in the end of last century by Archi- 
bald M'Creddie, Esq. a benevolent gentleman, a native of Penning- 
hame. He left L. 500, after having purchased an acre of land, 
and built a school-room and dwelling-house on it. Of the L. 500, 
L. 50 was paid as legacy duty, and the remainder L. 450 was 
ent on bond for affording a yearly salary to the teacher. That 
bequest has been, and is, of the greatest importance to a district 
of the parish, which, being thinly inhabited, and at a great distance 
from any other school, would, but for it, have been destitute of 
the means of education for the children of the poor. The other 
endowed school was founded by the late Samuel Douglas, Esq. 
of Jamaica, who died in 1799, leaving his property under the ma- 
nagement of executors named in his will ; and on their death, to the 
management of the ministers of Penninghame and Kirkmabreck, 
with the three oldest acting elders of each parish, trustees in all 
time coming. Some difficulties occurred in the management of 
the trust, and after some years of litigation, the trustees invest- 
ed the property recovered by them, agreeably to the terms of 
the will, in lands in the parish of Ballantrae, Ayrshire. These 
lands yield a rental of between L. 200 and Ij. 300 a-year ; but 
they are burdened with some debt. After paying a master 
L. 80 a-year, and other expenses, the trustees are to nominate, on 
the foundation, as many boys at L. 20 a-year each for board, 
education, and clothing, as the funds will permit. The instruc-

tions given in the will on those pointfs are very minute, some of 
them rather curious. 

The trustees built an excellent house at the north end of New- 
tonstewart, agreeably to a plan furnished by John Henderson, Esq. 
architect, Edinburgh, on a piece of ground extending to three acres, 
presented to them by the Earl of Galloway, when Lord Garlies ; 
and the school was opened in 1834. 

Of the natives of this parish, it is believed there are none be- 
tween six and fifteen who cannot write or read ; nor any upwards 
of fifteen. But there areTamilies from Irelandconstantly settling, 
for a longer or shorter period, some of the heads of which cannot 
write or read, but they very generally express a desire to have 
their children taught. Some are prevented by poverty from send- 
ing their children to school ; and others, who are Roman Catho- 
lics, may have scruples respecting Protestant schools. 

There are great facilities for procuring education for the children 
of the poor in this parish. A number of children is recommended 
to be taught gratis, at the parish school, in terms of the act of 
Parliament. That number is fixed in proportion to the extent of 
the school, at the time of fixing it. The proportion proposed was 
about one to fifteen or sixteen. From ten to twelve are taught on 
a bequest by the late Sir William Douglas, Baronet. Ten are re- 
commended to be taught gratis in the Douglas School, by the 
Trustees of the late Samuel Douglas, Esq. and a reasonable num- 
ber is taught gratis at each of the endowed schools. The people 
do certainly value the benefits of education ; but in the lower classes 
generally, the desire of procuring it for their children is not always 
so strong as could be wished. At the same time, they are always 
ready to admit its importance. The schools are judiciously enough 
placed, but from the great extent and shape of the parish, there are 
still some parts of it at a very inconvenient distance from any 
school. With one exception, those parts are not populous. Per- 
haps two additional schools would sufficiently accommodate the dis- 
tricts of the parish referred to. 

Library, §-c.— A subscription library was formed lately in New- 
tonstewart ; where there is also a public reading-room. 

A clothing-club has existed for some years, with much advan- 
tage to the industrious poor. The members pay Id. or 2d. a- 
week, and at the end of the year they receive in clothes the ac- 
cumulated amount, with their proportion of such contributions as 
may have been made to the box during the year.

Poor. — The average number of persons receiving regular paro- 
chial aid is about 67, viz. paupers, 50; orphans, deserted children, 
&amp;c., 1 1 ,• insane and weak-minded persons, 6. The average sum 
received by 50 paupers, is about L. 54 yearly; by 11 children, 
L. 32, 16s. do.; by 6 insane persons, L. 25, 18s. do. Those sums 
do not include occasional aid given to poor persons not on the roll, 
nor any extraordinary assistance given to the regular poor in par- 
ticular seasons, nor in particular family circumstances, such as 
sickness, &amp;c. which frequently occur. In addition to the amount 
of money distributed by the kirk-session, the poor belonging to the 
parish go round to each farm-house within a reasonable distance 
of their residence, once in the quarter, and receive meal or money. 
That observation applies particularly to the village poor. Those 
entitled to go receive a line from the kirk-session. The practice 
keeps up a good feeling between the different classes of the com- 
munity, and tends to preserve the real character of charity. 

The annual amount of collections in church for the relief of the 
poor, on the average of five years, was L. 75, 18s. Od. The sum 
of L. 6, Is. yearly accrues to the poor, from bequests lodged in 
the national funds ; and also the interest of another bequest of 
L. 100, at present yielding 4 per cent. ; — in all L. 10, Is. yearly 
The proclamation of banns also yields a small sum to the poor's 
fund. The heritors contribute voluntarily for assisting the session 
in supporting insane persons ; and in seasons when the wants of 
the poor are generally greater than usual, these voluntary contribu- 
tions are greateralso. In such seasons, those of the community who 
are able have always shown a willingness to assist liberally in any 
measures adopted for alleviating the wants of the poor. There is 
no regular assessment in this parish. 

There is a disposition among the poor, particularly among the 
Scotch poor, to refrain from asking parochial relief, from a feeling 
that it is degrading ; but it is to be regretted that such a feeling 
is becoming less and less perceptible. The exception implied re- 
specting the Irish is confined to those lately come, or who continue 
in destitute circumstances. When any of them have acquired the 
means of keeping themselves and their families in any degree of 
comfort, so far as I have observed, they do not fail in manifesting 
a spirit of independence. In general, they come to this country so 
very destitute, that perhaps they may not seek nor estimate duly 
these means.

Prison. — There is no prison in this parish, but merely a tem- 
porary lock-up-house in the village of Newtonstewart. 

Fairs. — There are four fairs held annually in Newtonstewart, in 
March, June, July, and October ; — for what purpose now, it is not 
easy to say. There is a market every Friday, and a cattle-market 
on the second Friday of every month. There is a horse-market 
in February, one in June, and one in November. 

Markets. — The weekly markets are not numerously attended, 
since the cattle-markets were reo'ularly established. Much busi- 
ness is done at both the cattle and the horse-markets, and it seems 
to be increasing. From the situation of Newtonstewart, it is like- 
ly to increase much. 

Ale-houses. — There are 38 houses licensed to sell beer and spi- 
rits in this parish, 34 in Newtonstewart; 2 in the north and 2 m 
the south end of the landward part of the parish. The effects of 
so many inns on the morals of the people, are certainly not bene- 
ficial. It is hoped, however, indeed I have no doubt, that drink- 
ing spirits to excess is diminishing in this parish and district. 

Fuel — In the landward part of the parish, the fuel used, with very 
few exceptions, is peats, of which there is abundance, and in diffe- 
rent places of excellent quality. In the village, the poorer classes 
use very generally peats, with small quantities of coals occasional- 
ly. The higher classes use coals generally ; but in many in- 
stances they prefer peats in kitchens. Coals are imported from 
England, commonly from Cumberland ; and sometimes they are 
brought from Ayrshire and the neighbourhood of Glasgow, usually 
as ballast. The Scotch coals are preferred for particular pur- 
poses, as malting, &amp;c. They are as high priced as the English 
coals, and they burn more quickly, so that they are not consider- 
ed so economical. Formerly, smiths procured coals from Ayrshire, 
but now they get them sometimes from Liverpool. In Newton- 
stewart, a considerable quantity of wood has been used for fuel since 
saw-millswereerectedinthe neighbourhood. Peats are brought into 
Newtonstewart at from 2s. to is. a cart-load, about or fully a yard 
solid. Coals are sold at present from 14s. to 16s. per ton of twenty 
hundred weight. The ton was 24 cwt. before the change of weights 
and measures. Coals have been dearer of late years here ; the price 
formerly for 24 cwt. was nearly what it is now for 20 cwt. Indeed, 
the price of coals has been and is inexplicably high. Wood, as fuel,' 
is sold at various prices, according to the quality and circumstances: 
when cut intp pieces of about a foot long, from 3s. to 4s. or 4s. 6d.

the purchaser from the plantations, uncut into short pieces, from

put on his cart. These prices are for hard- wood ; fir is cheaper. 
General Observations. 

Since the date of the former Statistical Account, the popula- 
tion of the parish has increased from about 2000 to 3461, and 
that of Newtonstewart from 900 to 2241. 

I have endeavoured to make a comparison of the average of 
seven years, 1791 — 797 inclusive, with the average of seven years 
1831 — 1837, and the following is the result: Grain, taking into 
account, oats, barley and oatmeal, has risen between six and seven 
percent. The boll of oatmeal of 10 stones of 14 lb. in this pa- 
rish has risen 9d. only. 

Rents of good arable land have become nearly triple of what they 
were during tbe former period. I refer to the rents of good land 
only, and as there is some bad or inferior land in every farm, the 
best arable land must be of more than three times its value dur- 
ing the former period. 

The rent of sheep stock farms is nearly double of what it was in 
1791 — 1797; these farms were also much higher rented during 
the war. 

The proportion of the present rent and real value of arable 
good land to the value of the same land, during the earlier period, 
is a most satisfactory proof of great improvement, as the price of 
grain is now so nearly what it was then. Great improvement has 
been made in the roads since 1797. 

The sheep stock of this parish was stated by Dr Boyd in the 
former Statistical Account to amount to about 9840; it is now less. 
It has been found advantageous to keep smaller stocks, and have 
them in a better state. Some farmers have reduced their numbers 
one-sixth or nearly one-fifth, and believe they have gained by doing 
so. The regular stock sheep are now rather under 7000 in number. 
Besides these, there are at present about 1100 feeding on turnips, 
and from 400 to 500 of Cheviot, Leicester, and other breeds, in 
the south end of the parish. The sheep stocks have been dimi- 
nished by the increase of cultivation also. The stock sheep in 
value may average about L. 12 a score ; during 1791 — 1797, they 
were, on an average, about L. 8 a score. From better manage- 
ment, and from diminishing the numbers, they are now of really 
more value at the same rate than they were then.

Galloway cattle bred in the parish are in the present year about 
twice the price they brought at the period 1791 — 1797. But 
their price varies so frequently, and so much, that it is not easy 
to fix an average. 

The present system of husbandry continued, will effect much 
improvement in the parish, and that improvement will be much 
aided by draining both to a greater and less depth. 

Sea shells were much used for manure formerly, and lime has 
succeeded them. They produced the most beneficial and endur- 
ing effects. After the lapse of many years they are dug up ap- 
parently little diminished in size, which seems to suggest that 
grinding them would be economical and profitable. If ground, 
the same quantity would produce much more effect, and in much 
less time, on a larger portion of land. It is rather singular that 
such a measure has not been adoptedj — at least so far as I have 
been able to ascertain. The quantity of shells on the shore 
in the parish of Kirkinner is very great, and the grinding of 
them would be attended with littb expense. It could be ma- 
naged by a small mill, moved by water, wind, or a horse. The 
shells brought as manure to this parish contain of mild lime ; 
when burnt /g, carbonate of lime, and // of caustic lime. 
The lime procured from them forms excellent mortar. It seems 
extremely probable that the old houses, castles, &amp;c. were built 
with it. Great improvements might be made in the moss of Cree. 
The moss might be floated off by the river Cree ; and it is ex- 
tremely probable that the bottom of it would not be below, but 
rather above the adjoining land : it is considerably higher at pre- 
sent. The water for carrying it away could be raised by a steam- 
engine, or by a wheel moved by the river- itself, in sufficient quan- 
tities, and at a moderate expense. The moss might be compres- 
sed for fuel also ; and by that means the present exorbitant price 
of coals might be reduced. The gaining of 1200 or 1500 acres of 
land would be a great acquisition, in addition to the land that may 
be recovered from the sea, on the east side of the moss. 

The encouragement of home manufacture, particularly of clothes 
from wool and flax, would unquestionably be conducive to in- 
dustry and economy. 

Nothing, however, can contribute so much to the comfort and hap- 
piness of the people as the knowledge and practice of religion ; hence 
the great importance of giving all countenance and support to re- 
ligious education from the earliest period of life.

THE REV. ANTHONY STEWART, M. D. MINISTER.  



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Extent, Boundaries. — This parish is somewhat of a triangular 
form and of very considerable extent. Its length from north-east 
to south-west is about ] 5 miles. Its greatest breadth is between 
6 and 7 miles ; and its smallest breadth not much above one mile. 
On the north and east, it is bounded by the parish of Penning- 
hame ; on the south and east, by the parish of Kirkinner : on the 
south and west, by the parishes of Mochrum and Old Luce ; and on 
the north and west, by that part of Ayrshire called Carrick. 

The river Bladenoch runs along the north-east side of the pa- 
rish, and forms a natural boundary between it and the parish of 
Penninghame. This river rises from a lake called Loch Mac- 
beary, situated mostly between the two parishes of Kirkowan and 
Penninghame ; but a small part of it extends into Carrick. This 
river, after a winding course of about 24 miles, empties itself into 
the Bay of Wigton. 

Tarf is another river, on the south-west side of the parish, which 
rises from a bog in Carrick, and, after a course of about 12 miles, 
crosses the parish to the eastward, and joins Bladenoch at a little 
distance from the church of Kirkowan. f

Parochial Registers. — The session-books were destroyed by fire 
about fifty years ago. Hence the comparatively recent date of 
the commencement of those now existing. Births, marriages, and 
a list of communicants are regularly kept. 

Land-owners. — These are, The Marquis of Bute ; James Blair 
Esq. of Penninghame, M. P. ; W. C. Hamilton, Esq. of Craigh- 
law; A. Murray, Esq. of Clugston ; John M'Kie, Esq. of Bar- 
galie ; Stair H. Stewart, Esq. of Physgill ; John Milligan, Esq. ;

The real rental of the parish is about L. 5000. 

Mansion iJoies.— Craighlaw-House, the residence of W. C. 
Hamilton, Esq. is the only one worthy of notice in the parish. It 
is an old but commodious and comfortable house. 

There is no traditionary or written account of antiquities that 
merits attention.

A decided improvement has taken place in agriculture since the 
date of last report. The roads are generally in a much better 
condition. Arable farms, in respect of subdivision, fencing, rota- 
tion of crops, and general management, are in an improved and 
improving state. Kirkowan being more a pastoral than an arable 
district, less attention is consequently paid to tillage, while its in- 
land position presents an impediment to those who have a taste 
and desire to extend the sphere of cultivation. 

Live-Stock. — The black-faced breed is held in the highest esti- 
mation by the holders of this description of stock, being found to 
suit the soil and climate better than the more valuable but less 
hardy breeds. The number of sheep which constitute the regular 
stock may be about 9000. Their merits in respect of wool, &amp;c. are 
not inferior to those of other sheep in the adjacent parishes. The 
annual clip of wool averages about 1200 stones of 26 lbs. to the 
stone, value from 9s. to 17s. per stone. 

The Galloway breed is all but without a rival in this parish. 
The land being not rich enough to develope the peculiar excellencies 
of this breed, farmers generally dispose of their sale stock when 
two years old. These are resold at Dumfries, thence driven 
southward, and after a year's feeding on the fertile plains of Eng-

land, find their way to the London market, where ihcy are much 
esteemed. 

Manufactures. — In 1822, a woollen mill was set agoing by the 
Messrs Mih-oy. It stands on the north bank of the Tarff, and at 
a convenient distance from the village. This is a thriving esta- 
blishment, which affords employment and the means of subsistence 
to a considerable number of persons. The articles of manufacture 
are blankets, plain and pilot cloths, plaidings and flannels. The 
Tarff water, from its softness, is well adapted for the purposes of 
dyeing and milling. There is, too, such a declivity in its course 
for two miles above where it joins the Bladenoch, as would afford 
ample power for propelling machinery to a much greater extent. 

Qitarries. — There is a quarry of blue-stone, the greywacke of 
geologists, about a mile and a half east from the village, which 
affords an excellent material for building. Granite, in large blocks, 
is to be met with throughout the parish, and is much used for mak- 
ing lintels, door-posts, &amp;c. to the houses, and serves the twofold 
end of increasing their stability and beauty. Slate transition 
clay-slate was discovered in one of the hills Culvennan about 
thirty years ago, but proved to be of such inferior quality, that it 
was soon abandoned. 

■V. — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The number of families attending the Es- 
tablished Church is 263 ; of families connected with the Secession 
and Relief, 21; of families connected with the Reformed Presby- 
tery, 7 ; of Roman Catholic families, 13. 

The teinds of the parish are exhausted, and wholly converted 
into a money stipend. The stipend of the parochial minister 
amounts to L. 292, lis. 8d. 

Education. — There are only two schools in the parish. The 
salary of the parochial schoolmaster is the minimum ; and his 
school fees amount to about L. 35 a-year. He has also L. 5 a- 
year as postmaster. 

Poor.— The average number of persons receiving parochial aid is 
33 : and the allowances to each, according to the necessities of the 
claimants, vary from L. 6, 10s. to 8s. per annum. The funds arise 
from church collections, yielding about L. 35 a year ; from a volun- 
tary assessment of the heritors to the amount of L. 25 a year ; and 
a sum of L. 3, Is. being the interest of a legacy.

PRESBYTERY OF STRANRAER, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY. 

THE REV. JOHN LAMB, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

This is the most southerly parish of Scotland, forming the ex- 
treme boundary of that promontory which terminates in the Mull 
of Galloway, in Lat. 54° 39'' north, and Long. 5" west. 

Name. — There are various accounts of the origin of the n ime 
of the parish. In Symson's Description of Galloway, it is said to 
have been " so called, because the kirk was dedicated to the Virgin 
Mary, the print of whose knee is fabulously reported to be seen on 
a stone where she prayed at a place called Maryport, near to which 
there was a chapel long since but now wholly ruined." In Chal- 
mers' Caledonia, it is said " to have obtained its appellation from 
the old parish church, which was dedicated to St Medan, to whom 
some other churches in this shire were consecrated, and was called 
Kirkmedan, from the name of the Saint. After being called by 
various forms of the name, Kirkmaiden at length became its settled 
appellation." There is a third account of the origin of the name, 
wholly traditionary, viz. that three maiden ladies of the name of 
Adair, belonging to a religious establishment at Kilhilt, in the pa- 
rish of Portpatrick, built, or left funds for building, threa churches. 
One of these was built at the chapel now in Stranraer : another at 
Kirkmaiden, now annexed to the parish of Glasserton: and the third 
in this parish ; and hence the parish is said to have taken its name. 

No change appears to have taken place in its name or bound- 
ary since the Reformation. Antecedent to that event, though at 
what period is uncertain, these must have undergone various 
changes, as is evident from the number of places throughout the 
parish, which, from their names, ,the ruins of buildings called 
kirks, traces of burning grounds, &amp;c. must have been the sites 
of places of worship. The chief o'' these are Kirkbride, Kil- 
stay, K.ldonnan, Kir..leish, and Kiikdryne or Kirkdrain. At 
the last of these places, was the residence of Mr John Cal lender.

Extent and Boundaries.— The length of the parish in a direct 
hne may be about 10 miles, and 12 miles by the roads. Its breadth 
varies from somewhat less than li to upwards of 3 miles : and its 
area may be about 20 square miles. On the north north-west, it is 
united to the parish of Stonykirk by a boundary of about 2 miles 
in length. The sea is its boundary on all other sides. 

Topography.— The form of the parish is very irregular and not 
easily described. The public road enters at the north-east cor 
ner, at a small modern building of antique construction, erected as 
a porter's lodge, or to commemorate the name of a place where, in 
old times, stood a kirk or chapel called Chapelrossan, or the chapel 
of the promontory. On proceeding a mile to the south-west, the 
mansion-house of Logan is seen on the right. It is small for the 
extent of the property, but handsome, commodious, and pleasantly 
situated. The road here separates, one line skirting the Bay of 
Luce to the village of Drumore ; the other leading to the Irish 
sea at the Bay of Portnessock. The parish here, to the extent of 
nearly 3 miles, is generally low and diversified with eminences, 
some of which are tastefully adorned with clumps of plantation. 
The village and harbour of Port Logan, in the south-east corner 
of Portnessock Bay, is a bare, bleak, unattractive-looking place in 
winter; but affords a delightful summer residence for those who 
take pleasure in sea scenery and amusements. The breadth of 
the parish here is about a-mile and a half. On leaving Port Logan, 
the road winds over a mountainous ridge, which stretches from sea 
to sea, a distance of more than two miles, descending rapidly into 
a narrow valley, also extending to the sea on both sides, — an extent 
of about a-mile and a-half. On the right in this vale, are seen 
the ruins of Castle Clanyard, in old times the residence of a fa- 
mily of the name of Gordon, a collateral branch of the House of 
Kenmure. Hence, a mile of up-hill road leads to the church, a 
building of the most mean appearance, and only remarkable for 
its elevated situation. The width of the parish here is conside- 
rably increased; and about a mile and a half farther south, is at 
its greatest, nearly four miles. 

Mull of Galloioay. — The extremity of the Mull of Galloway 

lies south-south-east from the chiu-ch, at a distance of about six 

4 



KlUKMAIDEN. 



201 



miles. The road now takes a more central direction. To the 
west, the land is bleak and mountainous ; to the east, it slopes down 
to the sea, and constitutes the most fertile portion of the parish. 
Nearly opposite the church on this side are situated the old 
castle, village, and harbour of Drumore. 

The point of the Mull is a peninsula of a mile and a quarter 
in length, by a quarter of a mile in breadth. It is joined to the 
mainland by a low and narrow isthmus formed by two small bays 
called East and West Tarbets. The hill forming the promontory, 
though bleak, rugged, and on its south-west side an almost per- 
pendicular rock from its very summit, has always been regarded as 
an interesting object by those who are fond of looking on nature 
in rude grandeur. A handsome light-house, lately erected, with its 
establishment, has added greatly to the pleasure of the visitant, and 
converted what before was merely grand, into what is both grand 
and beautiful in a high degree. From the balcony of the light- 
house may be seen, in a clear day, the lofty peaks of Cumberland; 
— the Isle of Man in all its extent ; the coast of Ireland from 
the mountains of Morne to Fairhead ; the highest mountains of the 
counties of Dumfries, Kirkcudbright, Ayr, and the towering Paps of 
Jura in Argyllshire. Though the picturesque and striking fea- 
tures of the coast are nowhere seen to more advantage than from 
the Mull-hill, there are other and higher eminences from which 
an equally good view of distant objects may be obtained. The 
chief of these are Montlokowre, Bunman, Cairnhill, Cairn of 
Dolt, and Grennan hill. The highest summit in the parish is 
probably somewhat under 900 feet above the level of the sea. 

Bays, c. — The bays are numerous, and generally succeeded 
by a promontory of the same name. Beginning on the north-east, 
and going round the coast, we have, 1. The bays of Chapelrossan ; 
2. Balgown ; 3. New England or Myroch ; 4. Tirally ; 5. Grennan ; 
6. Curghie;. Drumore; 8. Cairngarroch ; 9. Maryport; 10. Por- 
tonkill; 11. East Tarbet ; 12. WestTarbet; 13, Port Corkrie ; 
14. Clanyard; 15. Portnessock ; 16. Port Gill. The chief head- 
lands are Killiness Point and Mull of Galloway on the east ; and 
on the west Crammag, Gounies, and Mull of Logan. 

The only harboiirs are Port Logan, in the bay of Portnessock, 
on the western coast, and Drumore on the east. At both these 
places, besides a quay where vessels may lie in safety, there is good 
anchorage in the bays. Were the former so constructed that ves- 
sels could enter at low-water — and this could be done at no very

Plantations. — The plantations are mostly confined to the vicinity 
of Logan House, and are generally in a thriving state, and contain 
trees of considerable magnitude, considering the warfare they have 
to wage with the storms, and the copious sprinklings of spray they 
must frequently submit to from the sea. The most suitable for the 
climate — for there is soil for every variety — seem to be the ash, 
mountain-ash, sycamore, elm, beech, birch, and Huntingdon wil- 
low among the deciduous trees. Pinaster, white spruce, Scotch 
fir, Pinus montana, holly and yew among the evergreens. Where 
well sheltered from the sea, many other kinds also grow freely. 

II. — Civil History. 
Symson's description of Galloway, and Chalmers's Caledonia, 
contain the only record of this parish worthy of notice. The lat- 
ter says, " The parish church of Kirkmaiden belonged to the ab- 
bot and monks of Soulseat, which enjoyed the rectorial revenues, 
while the cure was served by a vicar. In Bagimont's Roll, it is 
stated that, in the reign of James V. the vicarage of this church 
was fixed at L. 2, 13s. 4d. At the Reformation, the rectorial re- 
venues were let to William Adair of Kiuliilt, by the abbot and 



KUUCMAIDRN. 



205 



monks of Soulseat, for the yearly payment of 300 merks and 100 
bolls of bear, small measure. The church of Kirkmaiden was 
vested in the King by the act of 1587. A portion of the revenues 
of this church was assigned as a stipend to the Protestant minister 
of the parish, and the remainder was afterwards granted by Charles 
I. in 1630, as part of the stipend for the minister of the newly es- 
tablished parish of Portpatrick, in which grant the King reserved 
to himself and his successors the patronage of the church of 
Kirkmaiden. But King James had heretofore, in September 1602, 
granted the five merk land of Drumore, with the patronage of the 
church of Kirkmaiden, to Ninian Adair of Kinhilt, whose son Ro- 
bert obtained a ratification of this gfrant in the Parliament of 1641. 
Symson says, in his account of Galloway, " The King's Majesty 
is patron of the parish of Kirkmaiden, although the lairds of Kin- 
hilt pretend a right thereto, and are in possession." The Earl 
of Stair as proprietor of the lands of Drumore has long been 
the patron of this parish. As the old church of Kirkmaiden was 
situated in a very inconvenient situation in the southern extremity 
of the parish, the parishioners gave in a representation to the Ge- 
neral Assembly, praying for a new church in a more central situa- 
tion. This w'as referred to Parliament, and the Parliament in 
October 1 639 remitted the prayer to the commissioners to be ap- 
pointed for the plantation of kirks. The desire of the petitioners 
was granted, and a new church was built in a more central situa- 
tion." The following extract from the presbytery records gives 
a somewhat different account of the removal of the church to its 
present site. 

" Presbytery at Kirkmaiden, the lOth day of July 1638. — Up- 
on the whilk day, the parochiners of Kirkmaiden presented ane 
supplication, desiring that, in respect their kirk was builded at the 
most extreme part of the paroch, and lay very inconveniently, that 
they wouldappoint some more convenientplace. — Whilk the brethren 
having considered, thought it reasonable, and assigned a part in 
Corghie, in the midst of the parish, for building a new kirk— de- 
siring the Lords of Council, by petition, to grant their letters to 
further the same, and to ratify the same in tyme coming." The 
Session records say, « that the building of the church commen- 
ced in 1638. On the 5th of March in that year, the National Co- 
venant was renewed at Edinburgh, and by order subscribed by all 
the congregations within the kingdom." It was subscribed at Kirk- 
maiden I he 25th March in that yeai-, and from this circumstance

the kirk was long called, supposed by way of sobriquet, Kirk 
covenant. 

Eminent Characters.— \Jnd.QY this head, may be mentioned, 
Andrew M'Douall, Lord Bankton, one of the Judges of the 
Court of Session, and author of " Institutes of the Laws of Scot- 
land." He was son of Robert M'Douall, Esq. of Logan, and 
Sarah Shaw, daughter of Sir John Shaw of Greenock, and was 
born at Logan, about the year 1685, and died at Bankton, in East 
Lothian, in 1760. Lord Bankton was thrice married; but none 
of his marriages was productive of children. His character as a 
lawyer and a judge was only equalled by his character in all the 
relations of life. The estate of Bankton, which had previously 
belonged to the celebrated Colonel Gardiner, descended, on his 
Lordship's death, to the head of his family, and still belongs to 
the M'Doualls of Logan. Murray's Literary History of Gal- 
loway. 

Robert M'Douall, Admiral of the Blue Squadron in his Ma- 
jesty's Fleet, and who had formerly held a similar rank in the Por- 
tuguese service, was the son of Alexander M'Douall, and Mary 
Gordon in Portnessock; born in 1729, and died at Stranraer 1826. 

Land-Oioners. — The land-owners of this parish were formerly 
numerous ; at present, there are only four, and the property of one 
of them is too small to entitle him to a voice in any parochial mat- 
ter. Their names and proportions of rent, according to the old Scots 
valuation, are as follows : Major M'Douall of Logan, L. 3181, 15s.; 
the Earl of Stair, L. 853, 10s.; John M'Taggart, Esq. of Ard- 
well, L.358, 15s.; Captain Maitland of French, L. 6. Total, 
L. 4400.

The earliest of the session records commences in 1699, in the 
time of Mr Monteith. In Mr Anderson's book, reference is made 
to that of Mr Turnbull, who was the second minister ; but that book, 
though it appears to have been in existence in Mr Anderson's time, 
1716, has been long since lost. From Mr Anderson's settlement 
to the present time, the session records, and registers of births, 
deaths, and marriages are continuous. They are, in some instan- 
ces, written by the minister, but generally by the session-clerk. 

Antiquities. — The traces of ancient buildings are numerous ; but 
their history is either altogether lost or involved in traditionary 
fable. Dunman, a high rocky hill overhanging the sea, at the south- 
west corner of the parish, has on its summit the remains and dis- 
tinct traces of a fortification. It is said to have been a place of 
great strength in the days of the Picts. On another less elevated 
promontory, half a mile north of Dunman, are also distinct traces 
of a place of strength. A round tower, of about 57 feet, has 
Tormed the principal building. In front of this building, there has 
been a fosse or ditch, and at a little distance outside of this a cir- 
cular wall. A short way south of Dunman, are two small green 
eminences, called " the auld Kilns," situated amid surrounding 
heath. These, tradition says, were used by the Picts in preparing 
their mysterious beverage heather crap ale. Farther to the south, 
there is another green spot named the Peat Knowe, where it is said 
some ceremony was gone through for banishing an epidemic dis- 
ease called burying the peat. The promontory forming the Mull- 
head is said to have been the last retreat of the Picts ; and here, 
when no longer able to withstand their enemies, the last feeble re- 
mains of them are said to have leapt or been forced into the sea ; 
and a tradition, illustrative of the tenacity with which they kept the 
secret of brewing their ale, still exists in the parish. When all were 
in the sea, except a father and son, they were offered their lives, on 
condition they would reveal this secret. The father promised to 
consider of this proposal, after they had precipitated the son over 
the rocks. This was done, and he then said the secret remains 
with me alone, and will die with me, and immediately leapt over. At 



208 



WIGTONSIIIIIE, 



the neck or isthmus of this promontory are the traces of a double 
line of fortification, extending from sea to sea. There is a small 
cave, though one of no little note formerly in the parish, on the 
south-east coast, between the bays of Port-ankill and East Tarbet, 
called by Chalmers St Medan's Cave ; together with a pool in the 

adjoining rock, called the well of the Co', or the chapel well, for 

the place often goes under the name of the Chapel. From the su- 
perstitious observances connected with this spot, it seems likely 
that it was the abode of some Druid or recluse, in times prior to 
Christianity ; and in later times, it might also have been the re- 
treat of some monk, or disciple of St Medan, who would proba- 
bly take advantage of its locality and reputation to serve his own 
interested views. To bathe in the well, as the sun rose on the first Sun- 
day of May, was considered an infallible cure for almost any disease, 
but was particularly efficacious in the recovery of " back-gane 
bairns." And till no very remote period, it was customary for al- 
most the whole population of the parish to collect at this spot, on 
the first Sabbath of May, which was called Co' Sunday, to bathe 
in the well ; to leave their gifts in the cave, and to spend the day 
in gossiping or amusements. 

The well is a natural cylindrical hole in the solid rock, about 
four feet in diameter, and six feet deep, filled with loose stones, to 
about half its depth. Round its mouth are three or four small holes, 
which were used for bathing the hands and eyes, while the large one 
was used for the body generally. There is no spring ; the well is kept 
full by the surf breaking over the rock at full flood and spring-tides. 
The inner apartment of the chapel or Co' is a natural cavity of the 
rock. The outer is of rude mason work, with a door and window. 
The walls are now greatly dilapidated, and the roof long gone. 
At its best, it must have been a mortifying residence. Strangers, 
on a first visit, are still reminded of the custom of leaving a pre- 
sent or gift at departure. A pin, a blade of grass, or a pebble from 
the beach, are now considered sufficient — though, no doubt, in the 
days of our hermit, more substantial offerings were looked for and 
bestowed. 

The ruins of buildings of a more recent period are of those 
mentioned by Symson, namely, the old houseof Logan ; Castle Clan- 
yard and Drumore. Among the antiquities of the parish, may be in- 
cluded the church-bell, said to have been at one time the dinner-bellof 
Castle Clanyard, and to have been brought to that place from Ken- 
mure. The inscription upon it is, " Nicolains Bamsa Do7iims

xxxiiii. IHS Maria Jhone Morison" — from which it appears that 
it was made in the year 1534, for Nicholas Ramsay, the grandfa- 
ther of the first Earl of Dalhousie. 

Modern Buildings. — The only modern buildings worthy of remark 
are the quay at Portlogan, erected by the late proprietor of Logan, 
at a very considerable expense; and the Light -house, erected a 
few years ago, at the extreme point of the Mull of Galloway. Ves- 
sels bound from the English coast to the north sometimes mis- 
took the Bay of luce for the Channel, and did not discover their 
mistake till they were aground on the sands at its head, where it 
is not always practicable to get off. This mistake, except in very 
foggy weather, the light effectually prevents. 

HI. — Population. 
The number of the inhabitants in 1790 was 1380; of families, 
285. In 1801, the number was 1613, of whom 742 were males, 
and 871 females ; families, 335. In 1811, the number was 1788, 
of whom 834 were males, and 954 females ; families, 357. In 
1821, the number was 2210, of whom 1090 were males, and 1120 
females; families, 442. In 1831, the population was 2051, of 
whom 973 were males, and 1078 females ; families, 429.

The inhabitants who are descended from native ancestors are 
rather remarkable for size and strength. This was said to have 
been conspicuous, when the Kirkmaiden company of volunteers was 
reviewed along with those of other parishes. The habits of the 
people with regard to the cleanliness of their cottages, cannot be 
much commended. There is httle peculiar in their dress. The 
home-spun linsey woolsey gown, and blue cloth coat, are still pro- 
duced by a few thrifty housewives ; and although linen webs are 

 The cause of the decrease at the last date was that, in 1821, the nuav at Port 
employed '" "' P'P'' "- "''"§'"8 ° the parish, were

not now, as formerly, made up for the market, they are still manu- 
factured in considerable quantity for home use. Their style and 
manner of dress, on the whole, is decent, neat, and substantial. 
The ordinary food of the peasantry is oatmeal porridge and milk, 
when milk can be got, for breakfast ; for dinner, potatoes and salt- 
herrings, or other kinds of fish, — and with the better economists, 
pork or bacon differently prepared ; and potatoes and milk or her- 
rings to supper. The bread is oatcakes or scones, composed of 
potatoes and oatmeal, or more rarely, of potatoes and wheaten or 
barley-flour. The difficulty of procuring milk where the dairy 
system prevails, has perhaps been the principal cause of the 
too frequent use of tea and its accompaniment loaf bread, — 
considerable quantities of both being consumed even by the poor- 
est ; and it is to be feared too many forego the more substantial fare 
which the pig they feed would furnish, to indulge in this favourite 
repast. 

The people enjoy in a considerable degree the comforts and ad- 
vantages of society, and seem contented with their situation and 
circumstances. Their secluded situation does not present many 
opportunities of cultivating their intellectual powers. Their attain- 
ments in religious knowledge are respectable, and their general 
demeanour is peaceable and orderly. Poaching in game is occa- 
sionally followed by a few individuals. Smuggling, which at one 
time was almost the sole occupation of many of the principal in- 
habitants, is now entirely abandoned.

jected to a proper rotation of crops, might, at least, in the form of 
meadow or permanent pasture, be made to assume a more seemly 
aspect. There was at one time a small common attached to the 
churchyard ; but it has long ago merged into the surrounding pro- 
perty. The woods are under the management of a judicious and 
experienced forester. The yearly thinnings are very useful for 
many farming purposes. They consist principally of ash, beech, 
and larch. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of arable land maybe about 
14s. per acre. The farmers are not in the practice of grazing 
cattle and sheep, except what belong to themselves. 

Rate of Wages — Prices. — The wages of ploughmen are at the rate 
of L. 9 per annum; of maid-servants, L. 2, 5s. for the half-year, with 
board. Married men servants, or benefit men, get L. 9 of money ; 
6 Galloway bolls of potatoes, and two bushels planted ; 52 stones 
of 17 lbs. oatmeal ; 2 tons or 48 cwt. coals, with house and gar- 
den, A day-labourer's wages in summer are Is. 2d. — in winter Is. 
Females employed at out-door work receive 6d. or 7d. per day. 
Reapers' wages are Is. 6d. per day without victuals; men are fre- 
quently hired for the harvest season, and receive L. 2 with board. 
Masons' wages are 2s. or 2s. 6d.; joiners 2s. per day, without victuals. 
A rood of mason work, furnishing all materials, will cost at an ave- 
rage about L. 3, for labour only L. 1, 10s. A good box-cart costs 
about L. 7, 10s. ; an iron plough from L. 3, 10s. to L. 4; an iron 
drill plough about L. 3. 

Live-Stock. — The few sheep-walks in the parish are stocked 
with the black-faced breed of sheep. The farmers generally keep 
a few of the Leicester breed for their domestic use. The cattle 
reared are principally of the Galloway breed, and more attention 
seems to have been lately given to its purity. There are in the 
parish several large dairies, in which the Ayrshire breed are kept 
and reared, or a cross between that and the Galloway bull, whose 
progeny generally take his likeness. 

Husbandry.— k\ihough the agriculture of the parish cannot be 
said to be behind that of the neighbouring districts, it has made 
little progress, except on a few farms, during the last twenty years, 
and is susceptible of great improvement. What the land chiefly 
requires, is thorough draining, followed up with the subsoil plough. 
A great proportion of the soil, resting on a stiff retentive till, is 
soaked, or, as the farmers express it, soured, with stagnant water 
durmg winter; and in dry summers, where clayey, it becomes un-

productively hard,— -where light and peaty, too loose for the roots of 
grain to retain their hold during high winds. Were the till broken 
up, and the water allowed to sink and run off by drains, the clayey 
soils would become more friable, the peaty, with a gradual admix- 
ture of the subsoil, would acquire a more adhesive texture, lime and 
manures would tell with more effect, and all would undoubtedly be 
rendered doubly productive. This improvement, though great and 
permanent, would also be expensive, and would be most effectually 
promoted by the landlord defraying the greater part of the ex- 
pense, — seeing it judiciously executed, and receiving interest for 
the outlaid capital in the shape of additional rent. 

Thorough draining, consisting of shallow drains running pa- 
rallel to each other, at the distance of 15 or 18 feet, has been in- 
troduced to a limited extent with the most beneficial results. The 
drains are cut about 2 feet deep, and filled to within 14 or 16 
mches from the surface with small stones. The expense of open- 
mg and filling such, exclusive of the stones, is about 6d. per rood. 

The land in tillage is managed in different rotations of cropping ; 
the six-shift seems to be the best. The order is as follows : 1. 
oats after grass ; 2. green crop of turnip or potatoes ; 3. wheat 
or other white crop ; 4. grass for hay or pasture, and the remain- 
ing years in pasture. 

The duration of leases, where these exist, is generally nineteen 
years. Those last given seem favourable to the occupiers ; who 
are furnished with suitable farm-buildings, and receive a liberal-al- 
lowance of lime; and whatever drainings they judge necessary are 
opened to them, free of expense. 

With regard to farm-buildings, there is great room for improve- 
ment. Very few contain accommodation sufficient to allow of the 
most profitable farm management, and many of them are in a de- 
cayed and ruinous condition. The greater part of the parish is 
enclosed, but, except in the vicinity of Logan, with insufficient 
fences. These consist of stone walls, turf with whins on the top, 
hedge and ditch. Many of the first are badly built, or built 
with bad materials; the second are not kept closely furnished 
with furze ; the last, when properly executed, are by far the 
best, effectually securing the enclosure from the first, and soon af- 
ter affording shelter besides. The quicks, consisting of thorn and 
beech, are planted in a facing of stone about three feet in height, 
banked behind with the earth taken out of the ditch, — which bank 
is also planted with sets of the hardier willows. Timber trees are 



KIRKMAIDEN. 213 

planted in the hedgerows, but seldom with good effect ; unless 
where sheltered, they rarely get beyond the stature of a bush, and are 
injurious to the fence, without being ornamental to the landscape. 

The greatest and most striking improvement that has recently 
been made in the parish, is on the roads. These,, only a few years 
ago, were in a scandalous state, carelessly formed, or in many places 
not formed at all, and as carelessly kept. Many old lines have 
lately been improved, new lines of considerable length have been 
or are in the course of being formed, and almost all kept compa- 
ratively in excellent repair. The fund for upholding the roads is 
derived from the conversion of Statute labour. The assessment 
for this purpose is L. 1, 10s. Scots in the hundred pounds Scots 
of valued rent, and 2s. 6d. from householders and mechanics, 
amounting in whole to L. 75 Sterling. There is no turnpike road 
in the parish. 

There are many obstacles existing to agricultural improvement. 
These arise from want of capital or enterprise in some instances, — 
the want of encouragement by the principal proprietors, — the want 
of sufficient fences and suitable accommodation in farm-buildings, 
— and, above all, the want of leases, or of such as last longer than 
a year ; for it will generally be found that " short tacks make thrift- 
less tenants." The most of these obstacles, however, arise from 
peculiar circumstances in which the principal proprietors are placed, 
and it is confidently expected, that, along with these circumstances, 
they will soon be removed, 

Quarries.— There is an extensive body of slate-rock in the pa- 
rish, which has been wrought in several places to a considerable 
extent, but not perhaps to a depth sufficient to obtain the article so 
good as it might otherwise yield. These quarries have, for some 
years past, been abandoned. 

Fisheries.— Fishing is not followed after with that industry and 
enterprise which the favourable locality would lead one to expect. 
Few make it their regular occupation ; although many of the in- 
habitants engage in it occasionally, both with net and line, and 
sometimes with very encouraging success. As many as fifteen cart 
loads of blockins or of coal-fish have been taken with the drag-net, 
during a single tide. The herrings, after having nearly abandoned 
the coast for years, are again promising to revisit it, and the people 
are now well prepared with nets to receive them. In connection 
with fisheries, Logan fish-pond deserves notice, as it is an object 
of attraction to all strangers visiting the parish. It is situated on 



214 



WIGTONSHIRE. 



the north side of the bay of Portnessock, and is formed by a circu- 
lar excavation from the soHd rock, connected, by a natural archway, 
with the sea. This opening is shut up with an uncemented stone- 
wall, which effectually secures the prisoners, and allows a free en- 
trance and exit to the tide. The pond is always kept well-stock- 
ed, especially with cod, lythe and coal-fish, and a few flounders. A 
salmon, red and grey gurnard, and some other small species have 
sometimes, by way of ornament and variety, been introduced ; but 
. the salmon lives only a very limited period, and the smaller soon 
become the prey of the larger inmates. On descending by a 
rude stair to the surface of the water at a large stone-flag, the fishes 
forthwith repair to this spot, where many of them, with their heads 
above water, are eager to receive from the hand of their keeper their 
usual treat of limpets. On such occasions, thekeeper may be seen lift- 
ing one into her lap, putting a limpet into its mouth, patting it on the 
head, and returning it to its native element. It appears somewhat 
uncomfortable and impatient when put through this ceremony, but 
does not resent the liberty she takes with it, by any subsequent pet 
or shyness. She firmly believes that they not only Amr, but that 
they can distinguish her voice from that of a stranger, and she re- 
lates the following occurrence as one of her proofs : During a very 
high tide lately, the sea so injured her house, that she was obhged 
to leave it, and reside for some days in the village of Port- Logan. 
Part of the wall surrounding the pond was forced into it, several of 
the fishes were killed or hurt, and the rest so alarmed, that they re- 
mained at the bottom, and would not venture to the surface, till she 
uttered her wonted call, when they immediately repaired to their 
feeding station as before. Being on such a familiar footing with 
her finny charge, it is not to be wondered, that she should have a 
struggle with her feehngs, when consigning one of them to the 
care of the cook. 

Manufactures. — Kelp was formerly manufactured in consider- 
able quantities, but, owing to its low price, is now entirely given 
up. 

Navigation. — There are four small sloops belonging to Dru- 
more, of 16, 25, 29, and 37 tons burthen respectively. They are 
employed in exporting farm-produce, and importing lime and coals, 
or otherwise engaged in the coasting trade. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town. — There is no market-town in the parish. The 
nearest is Stranraer, at a distance of about 18 miles from the 



KIRKMAIDEN. 215 

church. A carrier from each of the villages of Drumore and Port- 
Logan goes regularly to Stranraer, once and sometimes twice 
weekly. Penny post-offices are established, at regular distances, on 
the road between Stranraer and Drumore. The mail is conveyed 
daily by a car, carrying also passengers, to Port- Logan, and is for- 
warded by a person on foot to Drumore. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is situated in the centre of the 
parish ; but, being six miles distant from the extremities, it is incon- 
veniently placed for the aged, infirm, and even the hard-working la- 
bourer. The building of it was commenced in 1638, but owing, it is 
said, to some dispute amongthe heritors, it was not completed till se- 
veral years afterwards. The walls and roof are substantially good, 
the seating is in astate of great disrepair; butas it accommodates on- 
ly 275 sitters, its worst fault is its want of room. None of the seats are 
rented. There is a small gallery occupied by the residing heritor 
and his immediate dependents ; the rest of the seats are apportion- 
ed to the different farms. Few of the farmers, however, have 
sufficient accommodation for their own families exclusive of their 
servants and labourers ; and there is none whatever for the inhabi- 
tants of the two villages. 

The manse, having become partly ruinous and very uncomfort- 
able, was taken down, and a commodious and substantial one 
was built in 1837. The extent of the glebe, including garden 
and site of houses, is 6 acres, and its value about L. 1, 6s. per 
acre. The amount of stipend is L. 137, 13s. 6d. Sterhng in 
money, 5f Galloway bolls of bear, and 75 imperial stones of 
oatmeal. L. 5, 7s. 8d. is received from the Exchequer, to raise it 
to the minimum amount. There is no Dissenting or other chapel 
in the parish. It is proposed to erect a church, somewhere be- 
tween this and the neighbouring parish of Stonykirk, — to which a 
parish, containing a population of 1000, may be attached. 

There are about 88 Roman Catholics, and 28 Protestant Dis- 
senters in the parish ; the remaining 1935 of the population be- 
long, professedly at least, to the Established Church. 

The attendance upon public worship at the Established Church 
has been improving for a considerable time past, and would un- 
doubtedly be greater were the church larger. The inhabitants 
may not be a church-going people; but this arises principally 
from the want of accommodation ; few who have sittings for them- 
selves have sittings for their children also. They are thus prevent- 
ed from bringing them to church, and training them up to church-

going habits. The average number of communicants is about 
400. 

There is, at present, no Society for religious purposes. A pa- 
rochial Association is on the eve of being formed for promoting 
the four schemes of the General Assembly. The average amount 
of yearly collections for religious purposes is L. 5. 

Education. — There are three schools regularly kept in the pa- 
rish ; two situated for the accommodation of the children at the 
extremities ; one on the parochial establishment in the centre of 
the parish. English, writing, and arithmetic, are taught in all. 
Geography and mathematics are also taught in the school, at the 
north end of the parish ; and these branches, with French and Latin, 
are taught in the parochial school. The parochial teacher's salary is 
L. 25, 1 3s. — with the legal accommodation of dwelling house, school- 
house, and garden. One of the other teachers receives L. 4, be- 
ing the interest of a sum bequeathed for the education of poor chil- 
dren. The third teacher is entirely dependent on school fees. 
The expense of education is 2s. per quarter for English reading 
and writing, and 3s. for the higher branches. The children of 
paupers are taught gratis. The average number attending the paro - 
chial school is about 65 ; and 90 at the other two. There are no 
parts of the parish so distant from the schools as to prevent attend- 
ance ; and the people are so alive to the benefits of education, 
that there are none above six years of age who cannot read, or 
above 15 who cannot also write. There are, indeed, four or five adult 
individuals who cannot read, or who read but imperfectly; but these 
are all from Ireland. No additional schools are required ; but the 
amount of fees, where this is the only remuneration, is quite too 
small to secure the services of an efficient teacher. Great bene- 
fits have undoubtedly resulted from the facilities of procuring 
education. 

Literature. — A parochial library was instituted in 1836. It al- 
ready contains upwards of 600 volumes in religion and general li- 
terature. 

Poor, §-c. — There is no legal assessment for the poor. They 
are supported by church collections and other contributions; by the 
interest on sums bequeathed for their behoof ; but principally by the 
alms of the charitable, which they are in the habit of collecting 
quarterly. The average number of persons receiving parochial 
aid, including eight who are relieved occasionally, is 57 ; and the 
average yearly sum allotted to each is about L. 1, 10s. The an- 



KIKKMAIDEN. 



217 



nual amount of contributions for their relief is about L. 90. Of 
this sum, L. 31, 12s. consists of church collections; L. 30 of in- 
terests from legacies ; and L. 30 of voluntary contributions by he- 
ritors and others, mortcloth dues, &amp;c. Parochial relief is not, in 
general, considered degrading ; and there is, consequently, little 
reluctance in seeking it. 

jilehouses.— There are no fewer than ten ale-houses or public- 
houses in the parish ; and their influence on the morals and comfort 
of the people is most pernicious. 

Z'uel — The fuel used in the parish consists of coal imported 
from England, Glasgow, and Ayrshire, and sold at the rate of 16s. 
to 18s. per 24 cwt. Peat also is used : and poor people are frequent- 
ly obliged to have recourse to furze and heath. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The most striking variations betwixt the present state of the pa- 
rish, and that which existed at the time of the last Statistical Ac- 
count, are observable in the introduction of the modern system of 
husbandry ; the more extensive cultivation of green crops, espe- 
cially potatoes ; the substitution of wheat for bear ; and the now 
improved state of the roads.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 

ON THE COUNTY OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q550606">WIGTON</name>.</head> 
<p>

Etymohgy—Ov the etymology of the name Wigton, it is diffi- 
cult to give an account. The respectable minister of the parish 
of Wigton derives the word hovciDic, a village, and ton, a hill ; a de- 
rivation descriptive of the local situation of the town, which is seat- 
ed on a considerable eminence, overlooking the bay of Wigton. 
But the word is susceptible of a very different etymology ; name- 
ly, vjic or waeg, a wave, a billow, a sea, and ton or tun, a dwelling, 
or village. This derivation is as appropriate as the other, and bears 
a better analogy to the names of many other places in the same 
province. The word ton or tun is universal throughout Scotland, 
as signifying a village or dwelling ; hence, indeed, the English word 
town. A farm-steading is to this day, in many districts, called in 
the current speech a farm-town. And as to the syllable wic, or, 
as it is generally spelled, wick, it is used as descriptive of a place 
that is washed by the sea, such as Senwick, Rerwick, Southwick. 
Hence we define Wigton as a village washed by the sea ; a defini- 
tion which is corroborated by the fact, as mentioned by Syrason 
in his Large Account of Galloway, and as is known from other sour- 
ces, that Wigton, instead of having been at first built on an emi- 
nence, as the former etymology would lead us to believe, original- 
ly occupied a level site, which was gradually abraded by the sea, 
and is now a full quarter of a mile within tide-mark. The county 
would necessarily take its name from the chief town within its 
bounds; and Wigton was, at the time 1841 when the county 
was formed, if not the onlv, at least the chief town in the district. 
Wigtonshire is sometimes called West Galloway, or the shire of 
Galloway, or more briefly, the shire ; the Stewartry of Kirkcud- 
bright being denominated East Galloway ; the two are known by 
the common name of Galloway. 



GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. 



219 



Boundaries. — The county is bounded on the east by Wigton 
Bay, and the river Cree, which separate it from the Stewartry 
of Kirkcudbright ; on the north, by Ayrshire ; on the west, by 
the Irish Channel ; and on the south, by the Irish sea. It is 
bounded by water, therefore, on every side, except the north. It 
hes between 54° 38' and 55° 4' north latitude, and between 4° 16' 
and 5° 6' west longitude. It is divided into three districts, — the 
Rhynns peninsula, which lies west of a hue drawn between Luce 
Bay and Lochryan ; the Machers flat country, lying between the 
Wigton and Luce Bays ; and the Moors, which includes the re- 
mainder, being more than the third of the whole county. No part 
of the shire is above 13 miles from the sea. 

Population. — The following table shews the state of the popu- 
lation at different periods :

16,466 22,918 26,891 33,240 17,078 19,180 36,258 

The number of square miles in the county being 459, there are 
79 inhabitants to each square mile. Taking Scotland altogether 
the average is 80 to a square mile. The following table may not 
be uninteresting.

We may state that, with the exception of Irish settlers, who 
form a numerous class, the greater number of the inhabitants can 
trace back their descent through many generations. They are of 
Celtic descent ; and it is a curious circumstance that, even so late 
as the time of Queen Mary, Gaelic was the vernacular dialect of 
the district. Nor was this speech entirely disused in the more re- 
mote parishes of the county, till about the beginning of the seven- 
teenth century. It may accordingly be supposed, what is really 
the case, that the feudal feeling predominates in Wigtonshire to 
a greater extent than in any other county in the south of Scotland ; 
and that superstitious observances and traditionary legends abound. 
These, however, are now confined chiefly to the more remote pa- 
rishes, and are fast giving way even there. 

Physical Appearance. —The physical appearance of Wigton- 
shire is not striking or varied. Though there are eminences and 
hills of considerable height, yet it has been remarked, that there 
is no county in Scotland that rises so little above the level of the 
sea. There are, properly speaking, no navigable rivers, if we 



220 



GENERAL OBSKUVATIONS ON THE 



except the Cree, which is navigable for vessels of very small ton- 
nage for about four miles, and Bladenoch navigable not so far. 
But though not possessed of large and navigable rivers, this county 
abounds with the most spacious bays and harbours ; Wigton Bay, 
which lies on the east, gradually varying from eight miles in width, 
till It terminates in the Cree, a distance of about ten miles; and Luce 
Bay forming an indentation on the south of the county, to about 
the extent of fifteen miles, stretching inward till it reaches the town 
of Glenluce, where it terminates. These bays form two remarkable 
promontories,— the Borough Head on the south-east, and the Mull 
of Galloway on the south-west,— the two most southerly points in 
Scotland, the latter being about a mile and a-half farther south than 
the former. Lochryan, on the north-west, extends into the coun- 
ty about 9 miles, till it reach Stranraer, its breadth varying from 
2 to 4 miles. The most important harbours are Carty, Wigton, 
and Garlieston, on the Wigton Bay; Isle of Whithorn, near the • 
Borough Head; Port William and Sandhead, on the opposite 
sides of the Luce Bay ; Portnessock and Portpatrick, on the Irish 
Channel ; and Stranraer and Cairnryan, on Lochryan. The fresh 
water lochs, though pretty numerous, are small. Dowalton, on 
Longcastle, in the Machers, the largest, is only about 2 miles 
long, by 1 broad. The lakes in the county occupy 7 square 
miles. 

, Soil and Agriculture. — The soil in the three districts, — the Ma- 
chers, the Rhynns, and the Moors, into which Wigton is divided, 

is very different. The soil of the two first districts is, for the most 
part, a hazelly loam, dry and well adapted for the turnip husbandry; 
but on the barony of Baldoon, in the parish of Kirkinner, and 
along the Cree for several miles, between Newtonstewart and Wig- 
ton, there is a considerable extent of rich alluvial soil. The moors 
are bleak and barren, and in many instances constitute what is- 
called Jlow, that is, mossy land partially covered with water. The 
most improved system of agriculture is everywhere pursued, though 
perhaps the best specimens may be found on the estate of Baldoon, 
which is reckoned the Carse of Gowrie of the south. Of the re- 
lative proportions of land in crop and in pasture, a correct idea 
may be formed from the fact, that out of 288,960 English acres 
which the county contains, 101,136, or about 35 per cent., are 
under cultivation ; 187,824, or about 65 per cent., in pasture. Land 
in Wigtonshire is very little subdivided, and is mostly under en- 
tail. It is let in farms of middle size, and generally for a lease of

nineteen years. The average rent of land in 1810 was 8s. 6d. an 
acre ; now, however, it must be about a fourth less. The valued 
rental of the county is L. 67,64'i Scotch, old valuation. Annua 
value of real property in 1815, was L. 143,425. 

Agriculture, though now practised on the most modern and en- 
lightened principles was, till within a century, in a very rude state. 
Marshal Stair was the first to introduce agricultural improvements into 
this county, as his sister, the Countess of Loudon, who diedin 1770, 
aged 100, did into Ayrshire. This celebrated nobleman retired 
from pubhc business in 1728, and spent the remainder of his days 
either in the counties of Wigton or Linlithgow, in each of which 
he had a residence, in the quiet pursuits of private life. He in- 
troduced into both these counties, the most approved modes of 
agriculture he had witnessed either in England or on the Continent 
He practised the horse-hoeing system : he introduced the Lucerne 
and St Foin grasses: in addition to potatoes, which then 1728 
first began to be cultivated in the open fields, he cultivated tur- 
nips, carrots, and cabbages, with the plough ; he subdivided and 
inclosed his lands, drained swamps and marshes ; and altogether 
exhibited a skill and an enterprise such as to effect a revolution 
in agriculture in the two counties in question. Lord Stair died 
in 1747; but the beneficial influence of his example continued; 
and since his death, Wigton has enjoyed the advantage of posses- 
sing various skilful agriculturists, both landlords and tenants, to 
whom her progress is deeply indebted. Two agricultural societies 
have been long erected in the county ; and the existing race of 
farmers are highly respectable in point both of general intelligence 
and professional skill. 

Steam- Navigation. — But Wigtonshire, from the general progress 
of the arts of peace, now enjoys advantages unknown there even ten 
years ago. Remote as is her situation, she is reaping all the benefits 
which steam navigation is so eminently calculated to confer. Two 
steam-boats regularly ply between her leading ports and Liverpool 
and Whitehaven ; so that a ready and advantageous market is open- 
ed up for her black-cattle and agricultural produce. A farmer 
can now send his stock or his corn to Liverpool, and get it dis- 
posed of in the shortest time, at the market-price, and for ready 
money. Formerly, the case was quite otherwise. Corn-dealers 
travelled the country, buying up grain, with the view of shipping 
it to an English market. Their purchases were seldom, if ever, 
made with cash. On the contrary, it was almost the invariable 



222 



GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE 



practice to grant bills for payment, at four or six months' date. 
These persons were not always men of capital ; and the business 
which they followed was, from its nature, a very precarious one ; 
so that, in proportion to their numbers, a greater proportion of such 
provincial corn-dealers are known to have become bankrupt than 
any other class of men. A similar remark is applicable to the 
drovers, or those persons who purchased black'cattle in Wigton- 
shire, with the view of driving them for sale to some English mar- 
ket. These persons also followed a trade liable to as much ca- 
price and fluctuation as that of the corn-dealers ; and, like them, 
they seldom, if ever, paid in cash, but by a bill drawn at four or 
six months. Hence the great risk and eventual losses to which 
the farmers in Wigtonshire were continually exposed, and the ge- 
neral bankruptcy and distress that ensued. When the agricultu- 
ral interests were suffering so much for some years previously to 
1823, it is a fact well known to the present writer, that all the 
more extensive corn-dealers and drovers became bankrupt ; so that 
the county of which we are speaking, as well as tha Stewartry of 
Kirkcudbright, experienced an extent of loss and misery equally 
general and lamentable. But the introduction of steam navigation 
has put an end to this wretched system, and now affords to the 
farmer a ready and a safe market for effecting the largest sales, 
either of cattle or of corn. In addition to the steam-boats which 
ply regularly between Wigtonshire and England, there are two 
steamers which weekly sail between Stranraer and Glasgow ; so 
that the inhabitants of this remote county have now the ready and 
frequent command of the best markets, both in England and Scot- 
land, either for buying or selling. But while steam navigation 
has been productive of such important advantages as we have de- 
scribed, it has been attended with other results, which, though fa- 
vourable in a national point of view, are unfavourable to this pro- 
vince. The traffic and travelling that had previously prevailed 
between Ireland and England, via Portpatrick and Donaghadee, 
have been, in a great measure, turned into a new channel, and 
this county has in consequence proportionally suffered. Gal- 
loway formed at one time the great high road between the north- 
ern, and north-western counties of Ireland and England. There 
is now very little travelling by this route. The steamers plying 
from almost every Irish port to Liverpool or Holyhead, engross 
almost the whole of the travelling, of which Galloway formerly 
enjoyed the advantage. Hence, posting in this county has nearly

disappeared the number of post-chaises being supposed to be 
now only a fourth of what they were twenty or thirty years ago. 
Nor is this all The importation of Irish horses and black-cattle 
at Portpatrick has diminished to a similar extent. It appears from 
the account of the parish of Portpatrick, that whereas the number 
of such stock imported at Portpatrick, was 17,'275 in J 790, and 
20,000 in 1812, it was, in 1837, only 1080. " Both cattle and 
horses from Ireland," says the reverend writer of that account, 
" are now conveyed so easily and safely by steamers to Liverpool 
or Glasgow, that the short sea-passage at Portpatrick is not so 
desirable for them as when steam navigation was unknown, or in 
its infancy." We may here state that the mail-coach was first in- 
troduced into Galloway in 1804, and that it has since continued 
to run daily between Dumfries and Portpatrick. An additional 
mail-coach commenced two years ago to run between Newton- 
stewart and Stranraer via Wigton, Whithorn, Portpatrick, and 
Glenluce but as the speculation, we believe, is a losing concern, 
it is thought it will be discontinued, and the mail between these 
places carried, as before, on horseback. There is not, nor ever 
was, an opposition coach in Wigtonshire. 

Religious Houses and Ecclesiastical State, — Wigtonshire was 
distinguished for the number of monasteries which it contained ; 
namely, those of Whithorn, Wigton, Glenluce, and Soulseat, of 
each of which an account will be found under the parishes to which 
they severally belong. The oldest church in Scotland, founded 
by St Ninian, was built near the site of the present Whithorn. 
This county, at the Reformation, contained 21 parishes, with va- 
rious subsidiary chapels, built either for the private use of some 
baronial family, or for the advantage of the remote inhabitants of 
a large parish. These chapels have long been disused ; and in 
some cases even their ruins have disappeared. Parishes have been 
more judiciously arranged : in some instances, that of Sorbie, 
for example, three, being annexed, form one ; and though three 
new parishes have been erected, Kirkcowan, Stranraer, and Port- 
patrick, the number is reduced to 17. 

History. — As the civil history of Galloway, of which province 
Wigtonshire formed apart, is curious and interesting, a brief sketch 
of It, as connected with the county, may not be inappropriate in 
this place. The aborigines, who were of Celtic origin, were the 
Novantes : their chief towns were Berigonium on the Rerigonius 
Sinus, or Lochryan,— and Leucophibia, the present Whithorn,

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE 



The Mull of Galloway they called Promonturium Novantium ; the 
lAice Bay Abravaimus Sinus ; the Wigton Bay Jena fiavius. 
Galloway was invaded by the Romans ; but no Roman colony 
seems to have been established there ; nor were the original in- 
habitants driven away. On the abdication of the Romans in 448, 
this province was over-run by the Anglo-Saxons of Northumbria; 
to whom it remained partially subject till the beginning of the 
ninth century. The inhabitants, owing to the extinction of the 
Northumbrian dynasty in 820, having gained their independence, 
fell a prey to the Picts ; a race of men, who, whatever was their 
origin, flourished and became eminent in Galloway, after their 
name had been forgotten in other districts. But notwithstanding 
of their successively falling under the dominion of these various 
tribes, the original Celtic inhabitants of Galloway were never en- 
tirely displaced. On the contrary, they contrived to retain their 
customs and manners, and, in many respects, to preserve, if we 
may so speak, their nationality. They were distinguished for dar- 
ing heroism and intrepidity, insomuch that they obtained the ap- 
pellation of " the wild Scots of Galloway," and were granted, by 
the Scottish Kings, the privilege of forming the van in every bat- 
tle at which they might be present. Of their leaders or rulers we 
have, for a long time, but little account. Jacobus, " the ruler 
of Galloway," is mentioned as one of the eight reguli who met at 
Chester in 973. Ulrigand Dovenald M'Dowall, still represented 
by the M'Dowalls of Logan, in the parish of Kirkmaiden, in Wig- 
tonshire, the leaders of the Gallovidians, acted a conspicuous part, 
with their followers, at the battle of the Standard in 1138, in which 
they were both slain. But the first " Lord of Galloway" was 
Fergus, of whose parentage nothing is known, though there is no 
doubt that he represented a family who had long been powerful 
in the province. The Gallovidians were, for about a century, ruled 
over by their own independent princes or " Lords," the descen- 
dants of Fergus. They frequently revolted against the Scottish 
King, and carried on war against their sovereign with various suc- 
cess. On the death of Allan, the last Lord of Galloway, his power 
and domains were, in 1234, subdivided among his three daugh- 
ters, — which introduced new families and new customs. He had 
been twice married : his second wile was Margaret, daughter 
of David, Earl of Huntingdon. His daughter, Elena, was mar- 
ried to the Earl of Winchester ; Christian, to the Earl of Albe- 
marle ; and Devorgille, to John Baliol of Bernard Castle. The 



COUNTY OF WIGTON.

two last daughters were born to him by his second wife, the 
daughter of the Earl of Huntingdon. Devorgille's marriage was 
productive of five children ; a daughter, married to John Cumyn 
of Badenoch, — and four sons, one of whom, John Baliol, succeeded 
to the Scottish throne, as the descendant of David of Huntingdon. 
John Baliol, King of Scotland, who was grandson of Allan, the 
last of the Lords of Galloway, possessed great estates in both Wig- 
tonshire and the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright, the chief seat of the 
family being Buittle Castle, in the latter. The county of Wig- 
ton, with the title of Earl, was conferred by David II. in 1341, 
on Sir Malcolm Fleming; but Fleming, amid the distraction of 
the times, was obliged, in 1372, to dispose of his estates though 
he retained the title to Archibald Douglas. From this date, the 
Douglases ruled supreme till their forfeiture in 1453. The 
county was then parcelled out among different families ; many of 
which still remain ; and the Agnews of Lochnaw were created 
heritable sheriffs. This office remained in their family till the 
abolition of hereditary jurisdiction in 1747, with the exception of 
seventeen years previous to the Revolution, when Graham of 
Claverhouse, and his brother, Colonel David Graham, were ap- 
pointed joint-sheriffs. Chalmers's Caledonia Vol. I. passim. 
Murray's Literary History of Galloivay, 2d edit. pp. 330-2. 

Antiquity of Families. — Whether any family in Wigtonshire 
can claim descent from the ancient Lords of Galloway, is a ques- 
tion that has long been agitated, and, from its nature, will never 
probably be ascertained; but it seems to be generally allowed 
that the M'Dowalls, if not lineally descended from them, are 
of the same race and lineage. Caledonia, 'in. 379. The 
M'Dowalls have always been a powerful race in this country, and 
their origin is lost in its antiquity, — ultra memoriam hominum to 
quote the words of one of their earliest charters. The name is 
still eminent ; but the number that bear it is reduced. — The 
M'Cullochs, of whom the laird of Merton, in the parish of Mo- 
chrum, was the chief, are perhaps next in point of antiquity to the 
M'Dowalls. Both families, during the successive wars, espoused 
the cause of the BaUols ; and Edward I. appointed Thomas 
M'Culloch sheriff of the province. In 1337, Edward III. granted 
Patrick M'Culloch an annual pension of L. 20 for his good ser- 
vices in Scotland. The last of the Merton line, Sir Godfrey 
M'Culloch, a dissolute character, who squandered and sold his 
estates, was beheaded at the Cross of Edinburgh for murder in 
1697. In those distracted times, private property was not in 

WIGTON. 1.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE 



many cases secure. Sir Godfrey, and a person of the name of 
Gordon, claimed the estate of Cardoness, in the Stewartry of Kirk- 
cudbright. The former had possession ; and the latter lived at 
Bushybield, in the neighbourhood. They were personal enemies 
to each other; and Sir Godfrey having come to Bushybield to 
assist in removing some cattle that had been poinded, and having 
thus met Gordon, discharged a loaded gun at him, and inflicted 
wounds which afterwards proved fatal. Sir Godfrey fled to Eng- 
land, but having afterwards returned to Scotland, he was appre- 
hended in a church on a Sunday in Edinburgh, while attending 
public worship. At the end of the service, a gentleman from 
Galloway, who was present, and who, it is said, had a pecuniary 
interest in the death of M'CuUoch, cried out with an air of authori- 
ty, " Shut the doors, — there's a murderer in the house " Sir God- 
frey was thus apprehended ; and having been tried, he was executed 
on the 26th of March 1697. His " Last Speech," printed from the 
only copy known to exist, and which is in the hands of the writer of 
this notice, isiven below.  He had never been married, though

to give a faithful and true account of the matter. 

I do declare in the sight of God I had no design against his life, nor did I ex- 
pect to see him when I came where the accident happened : I came there contrair 
to my inclination, being pressed by these two persons who were the principal witnesses 
against me they declaring he was not out of bed, that I might relieve their goods 
he had poinded : I do freely forgive them, and I pray heartily God may forgive them, 
for bringing me to that place. 

" When I was in England, I was oft-times urged by several persons who declared 
they had commission from Castle-Stewart and her Ladyjf now the pursuers for my 
blood, that I might give up the papers of these lands of Cardincs, whereupon they 
promised not only a piece of money but also to concur for procuring me a Remission ; 
and I have been several times since in the country, where the misfortune happened, 
and where they lived, but never troubled by any of them ; although now after they 
had got themselves secured in these lands without me, they have been very active in 
the pursuitc, untill at last they have got me brought to this place. 

" I do acknowledge my sentence is just, and does not repine ; for albeit it was on- 
ly a single wound in the leg, by a shot of small hail, which was neither intended nor 
could be foreseen to be deadly ; yet I do believe that God in his justice hath suffer- 
ed me to fall in that miserable accident, for which 1 am now to suffer because of my 
many other great and grievous unrepented for sins ; I do therefore heartily forgive my 
judges, accusers, witnesses, and all others who have now, or at any time injured me,

he avers the contrary ; but he left behind him several illegitimate 
children, who, with their mother, removed to Ireland on the death 
of their father. One of his grandchildren suffered capital punish- 
ment in that country for robbery, about the year 1760. These two 
families, the M'Dowalls and the M'CuUochs, are the oldest in Wig- 
tonshire ; but there are many others of nearly equal standing ; 
such as the Agnews, the Kennedys, the Adairs, all of Irish ex- 
traction; the Dunbars descended from the Earls of March, the 
Hannays, the Gordons of Balmeg, Craichlaw, and Culvennan, the 
M'Kies, all of which settled in this county about 500 years ago. 
The first charter in favour of the Vanses was in 1451. The 
Maxwells from the house of Nithsdale, were established here 
in the same century. The Murrays of Broughton, of honourable 
descent in Dumfries-shire, and now representing in the Stewartry 
the Stewarts of Cally and the Lennoxes of Plunton, the Hays 
of Park, the Stewarts, the Rosses, the Blairs of Dunskey, the 
Dalrymples of Stair, the Cathcarts of Genoch, the Hawthorns, 
first appear in the annals of Wigton in the 16th or 17th century. 
The Ramsays of Boghouse, the Nelsons of Craigcaffie, the Chris- 
tians or Christies of Monkhill and Drummaston, the Houstons of 
Cutreoch, the Martins of Cutcloy and Airies, the Baillies of Dun- 
ragget, have either become extinct, or have terminated in females, 
or have now no property in Wigtonshire. There are, also, 
M'Kerlies, a name common here since the days of Wallace, but 
which, so far as we know, occurs in no other district in Scotland. 
The M'Taggarts represented by John M'Taggart of Ardwell 
M. P. for the Stranraer burghs, have been settled in Wigtonshire 

ant religion, renouncing all righteousness of my own or any others, relying only up- 
on the merits of Christ Jesus, through whose blood I hope to be saved, and whom I 
trust will not only be my Judge but also Advocate with the Father for my redemp- 
tion 

" Now, Dear spectator, as my last request, again and again , I earnestly desire and 
beg the assistance of your fervent prayers, that although I stand here condemned by 
man, 1 may be absolved before the tribunal of the great God, that in place of this 
scaflfold, I may enjoy a throne of glory ; that this violent death may bring me to a 
life of glorious rest, eternal in the heavens ; and that in place of all these spectators 
I may be accompanyed with an innumerable company of saints and angels, sinking 
Hallelujah of the great King to all eternity. 

" Now, O Lord, remember me with that love thou bearest to thy own, and visite 
me with thy salvation, that I may see the good of thy chosen ones, and may glory in 
thine inheritance. Lord Jesus, purge me from all my sins, and from this of blood- 
guiltiness, wash me in thy own blood. Great are my iniquities, but greater are the 
mercies of God  O let me be amongst the number of those for whom Christ died • 
be thou my advocat with the Father. Into thy hands do I recommend my spirit ' 
come Lord Jesus, come and receive my soul. Amen.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE 



for a century and a half ; but, though of respectable rank, were 
not land-owners till about forty years ago. The oldest names, in 
addition to those already mentioned, are M'Guffie, M'Kinnell, 
M'Keand, M'Gowan, M'Geoch, M'Gill, M'Nish, M'Cracken, 
Broadfoot, Donnan, almost all of which are evidently Celtic, and 
must have come down from the remotest antiquity. While old 
names and old families thus predominate, very few new ones, 
owing to the remote nature of the province, have been introduced. 
The chief immigration is from Ireland ; and this is generally not 
of a very desirable kind ; though some of the oldest and best fa- 
milies in the county were originally of Irish extraction. 

Miscellaneous Observations. — There is one important infer- 
ence to be made from the various parochial accounts; name- 
ly, the great number of Irish settlers, and the inferior rank they 
hold, both as to education, a spirit of independence, and other 
respects. A third of the whole labourers of the parish of Kirk- 
colm, it is stated, are either Irish, or descended of Irish pa- 
rents ; while in the" parish of Portpatrick it appears that, out of 
a population of 2239, no fewer than 421 are natives of Ire- 
land, exclusive, of course, of those who, though born in the parish, 
are descended of Irish parents ; so that, taking this view of the 
case, the Irish proportion of the labourers will not be less than a 
third. The parishes nearest to Portpatrick will of course be more 
occupied with immigrants from the sister island than those in the 
middle or east of the province ; but, taking the average of the 
whole county, we have little doubt that a fifth of the aggregate 
population will consist either of native Irish, or of persons born of 
Irish parents. It will also appear from the accounts, as hinted 
above, that, proportionally to their numbers, the lists of paupers 
in the different parishes contain more Irish than native Scotch. 
But though the county be thus overrun with adventurers from 
Ireland, who, while they bring no money along with them, have 
a tendency, by factitiously adding to the supply of labour, to lower 
wages, and thus to deteriorate the general condition of the indus- 
trious classes, — yet pauperism prevails but to a small extent in this 
county ; a fact highly honourable to the character of the excellent 
classes in question. Out of a population of 36,258, there are only 
about 700 persons receiving parochial aid, and some of these re- 
ceiving only the smallest sum, sometimes less than L. 1 a-year, in 
order to pay, or help to pay, their house-rent; that is, only 1 in 
62 persons is a pauper, being less thanthe third of the average

of England. Nor Is the smallness of the sum applied to their 
relief less remarkable than the paucity of the number of paupers. 
The aggregate annual amount distributed among these 700 poor 
is only about L. 1375, being rather less than L. 2 for each indivi- 
dual, or at the extraordinarily low rate of 6d. per head of popula- 
tion. The lowness of this rate will be best appreciated when we 
state that the average burden in England, previously to the new 
poor law in 1834, was twenty-three times greater, or lis. and 8d. 
per head of population. There are no poor-rates or legal assess- 
ments in the whole county except in one parish. 

Wigton, Whithorn and Stranraer unite with the small burgh of 
New Galloway in returning a Member to Parliament. The constitu- 
ency of the first is 10 1 ; of the second 54 ; of the third 217 ; and New 
Galloway 20; the aggregate being 392. John M'Taggart of

The following communication on the interesting antiquity called 
the Deil's Dike, has been received from Mr Joseph Train, 
Castle-Douglas, a zealous and distinguished antiquary. 
" My attention was, for several years, occasionally occupied in tra- 
cing the vast rampart called the Deil's Dike through Galloway and 
Nithsdale. It commences at Lochryan in the farm of Beoch, near 
the site of the ancient city of Berigorium, where Agricola, the 
Roman General, had a station.  Thence it extends through the 
farms of Braid, Auchenvane, Kirnevarn, and Kilfedder. From 
Kilfedder, it takes an easterly direction from the farm of Derry, 
and passes by the north end of Loch Maberrie. It passed the old 
Kirk-yard of Kirkcalla; but about the commencementof the present 
century, the stones were carried away to make Riiff Fences in the 
neighbourhood. In the adjoining farm of Ocheltree, this ancient 
structure runs from the east side of the loch to the summit of the 
hill, where there are the remains of a watch-tower made of very 
large stones. Along the whole line of the Deil's Dike, there is no 
other place from which a sentinel could have had such a command- 
ing view of the surrounding country. From the hill of Ocheltree, 
the dike extends along the farm of Glcnvernock. Immediately 

• I have seen the head oF a Roman spear which was found there. In the year 
1825, this remnant of antiquity was in the possession of Mr Mackenzie of Stranraer, 



COUNTY OK WIGTON,

above Glendochart, the hne is interrupted by a circular stone wall 
190 yards in diameter. This is evidently a hill-fort of large di- 
mensions. In the farm of Knockvill, which adjoins that of Glen- 
dochart, the dike runs into the loch of Cree. From the opposite 
side of the loch, it passes through the Cumberwood, and appears 
again in Cordorken, in the parish of Minnigafif ; thence stretches 
along the hill of Blair, in the farm of Torregan, and across the 
moor of Dranandow, between the standing stones, called the 
Thieves and the Nappers. As it passes from Torregan to Dran- 
andow, it runs through a bog, and is only perceptible by the hea- 
ther growing long and close on the top of it ; whereas, on each side 
the soil only produces rushes and moss. Near the centre of the 
bog, I caused the peat to be cleared away close to the dike, and 
thereby found the foundation to be several feet below the surface, 
which appeared to me a sure indication of its great antiquity. 

" From the Craw-Stane of Dranandow, the dike passes along the 
south side of the Garlick, through the farm of Auchinleck,''over 
the south side of Drigmorn, and by the foot of Tonergee. It 
crosses the burn of Pilnure, and appears again on the south side 
of Talnetrie. It goes up Craignelder, on the farm of Corwar, 
passes to Craigencallie, and is very entire in the Garrory, Clanry, 
Duckieston, Largrave, and Knockreach. Near the old bridge of 
Deuch, it appears again, and continues through the farms of 
Moonkaig, Auchinshinnoch, and hill-end of Keroch. It passes 
through Glencairn, Tynron, Penpont, and is nearly entire in the 
farm of Southmains, in the parish of Sanquhar. 

" Keeping the course of the great dike, Southmains is upwards 
of fifty miles from Lochryan. In this distance, there are so many 
connecting links as to leave no doubt of this vast ruin having been 
conjomed. Where there is any breach in it, I was fortunate 
enough, m almost every instance, to find old people who remember- 
ed the stones having been carried away from that part of the dike, 
to make enclosures in the neighbourhood. 

" From Southmains, it is said to have taken an easterly direction 
tdl It jomed the large dike, yet so entire at Thornithwaite, and at 
Hightae Flow, m the parish of Lochmaben. Thence it extended 
to Bntton Wall, in the parish of Annan, and ran into the Solway, 
nearly opposite Bowness, in Cumberland, where the great wall of 
Adrian commenced. 

" Dr Clapperton of Annan, the father of the celebrated traveller 
of that name, traced the Deil's Dike far to the westward of

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. 



which is to be regretted, as in Dumfries-shire agriculture has made 
larger inroads on this old structure, than in Galloway, where the 
greater part of the lands through which it passes, are less suscep- 
tible of being disturbed by the plough. 

" This ancient fence is invariably eight feet broad at the base, 
with a fosse on the north or inland side of it, and seemingly, as far 
as stones could be procured conveniently, it is built of blocks of 
common moorstone, which bear no mark of either chisel or ham- 
mer. As it recedes from the stony district, it is built of an ad- 
mixture of stones and earth, or wholly of earth as at Hightae Flow. 
The builders of this vast rampart, have not taken advantage of na- 
tural barriers, such as lochs, rivers, and glens to strengthen its po- 
sition as a line of defence, but in Galloway it uniformly includes 
the fertile land to the south of it, from which circumstance, and 
from the fosse being on the opposite side, it appears to have been 
built by a people inhabiting the lower and more southern part of 
the district. 

" The era and use of all the other great walls in the kingdom 
being well known, it is a singular circumstance that a work of such 
magnitude as the Deil's Dike should have been overlooked by 
historians : consequently every thing connected with its erection is 
involved in the darkest obscurity.- It is not mentioned in the 
charter of any of the lands through which it passes, so far as I 
have been able to ascertain. Mr Chalmers, the author of Cale- 
donia, in a letter which I received from him, dated 16th April 
1820, says, " I wish you to understand, my good Sir, that there 
are questions which arise out of your communications, which jus- 
tify the observations of Mr Hume, that there are questions in his- 
tory as difficult of solution as any in the sciences. Such is the 
Deil's Dike. Considering all its circumstances, it is extremely 
difficult to assign its age, its object, or its builders. In Ireland, 
there is nothing like the Deil's Dike ; the inference is, that it was 
not made by Irish hands. I am disposed to think that this work 
is several centuries older than the arrival of the Irish Cruithne or 
Picts in Galloway." In Caledonia, Vol. iii. page 237, alluding 
to the same subject, he adds, " It is obviously a very ancient work, 
and was probably formed by the Romanized Britons after the de- 
parture of the Roman armies." 

" The name of this ancient structure is an additional proof of its 
great antiquity, as, down to a late period in Scotland, any work of 
unknown origin which seemed to exceed the ordinary limits of hu- 
man exertion, was commonly ascribed to either the Picts, to Mi- 
chael Scott the wizard, or to the Master Fiend himself."
