ADVERTISEMENT, 

To the 'T^d and \th Volumes, 



HAVE now the pleafure of delivering to the 
public, a very valuable addition to the volumes 
already printed of the Statistical Account of 
Scotland. They contain, in all, 1 5 1 parifhes, which 
fufficiently proves, that the whole work, on the lame 
fcale, may be comprehended within bounds not too 
bulky — a matter, at the fame time, not very eafily 
accomplifhed, as it is difficult to fix on that happy me- 
dium, which, avoiding prolixity on the one hand, yet 
preferves, on the other, every fa£t or obfervation of 
real curiofity or importance. 

The value of this inquiry, not only to this, but to 
other countries, appears every day more and more 
indifputable ; and it is to be hoped, that the example 
of Scotland, in this refpeft, will foon be imitated by 
other nations. For that purpofe, a fpecimen of the 
work has been tranflated into French, and tranl'mit- 
ted to every perfon of power, political influence, or 
literary merit, on the continent of Europe. The 

Vol. III. b fpecimen 



 



( X ) 

1 

fpeclmen contains 6 diftridts, and is drawn up, in fuch 
a manner as to give, within narrow hounds, a view of 
the progrefs of human fociety. The firft diftrift, (that 
of Kinguffie in Badenoch), is entirely paftoral j the fe- 
cond, (Morhani in Eafl Lothian), is employed in agri- 
culture J in the third, (Moulin in Perthfliire), there 
is the commencement of manufaftures : From the 
fourth, (Neilfton in Renfrewfhirel, the effefts of the 
complete eftabllfhment of manufactures, on the man- 
ners and morals of the people, may be traced. The 
fifth, (Montrofe*), is a dilhiit poflelTed of foreign 
coir.rnercei and the work concludes with an account 
of Edinburgh, as a fpecimen of the progrefs of luxu- 
ry. The very flattering encomiums, bellowed by fe- 
veral foreigners, of the firft merit and diftindlion, 
who have had an opportunity of examining this pa- 
per, proves to what a heighth the charadler of the 
clergy of Scotland will be elevated, by their ftatifl;i- 
cal exertions. 

In a work of this nature, it is impoflible to avoid 
committing a number of miftakes f. It is even at- 
tended with confiderable difficulty to print a volume, 
the manufcript of which is written in from 50 to 80 

different 

■* Montrofe and Moulin are in the 5th volume, which is now 
in the prefs, and in which it is alfo propofed to include Edin- 
burgh. 

1 On6 miftake, in the 2d volume, in juftlce to the able and 
learned minifler of Kettle, it may be proper to take notice of, 
it appearing, on farther inquiry, th^t the very important table, 
given in the Statiftica! Account of the parifh of I^ettle, (vol. 
ift), was fuggefted by Mr Barclay himfelf, who is conftquentl}; 
entitled to the praife of that meritorious idea.

different hands : And it is impoffible, on every occai 
fion, to ftop the progrefs of the printer, in order to 
procure, from a diftaht correfpondent, an explana- 
tion of his original communications. But every 
clergyman of liberality of fpirit, and every reader 
of candour, will readily make allowances for accidental 
errors, to which, indeed, a work of this nature is fo 
peculiarly liable. 

It is at prefent only neceffary to add, in regard td 
the fucceeding volumes, that it is the author's inten- 
tion, to perfevere in the fame plan, until he has 
given a fimilar account of ever^ parifh of the kingdom. 
His objedl is, to lay the foundation of a great, metho- 
dical, and complete furvey of Scotland, and perhaps 
of England, which he hopes will be undertaken, by 
the government of the country, at the commencement 
bf the enfuing century. If periodical furveys are af- 
terwards taken, every 50 or 100 years, they will fur- 
nifli the beft means of afcertaining the progrefs of na- 
tional improvement, and will point out the proper 
fyftem to be purfued, in order to bring political fo- 
ciety, in thefe kingdoms, to the highefl pitch of hap- 
pinefs and perfeclion. 

He will conclude with the following addrefs, ori- 
ginally printed in French, which was prefixed to the 
fpecimen of the Statiftical Survey of Scotland, above 
mentioned, as it tends ftiil farther to explain the na- 
ture and importance of this inquiry.

ADDRESS 

T O T H K 

READER. 



THE fuperiority, which the philofophy of modern 
times has attained over the antient, is juftly 
attributed to that anxious attention to fadls, by 
which it is fo peculiarly diftinguiflied. Rafting not 
on vifionary theory, but on the fure bafis of invefti- 
gation, and. of experiment, it has arifen to a degree 
of certainty and pre-eminence, of which it was fup- 
pofed incapable. It is by purluing the fame method, 
in regard to political dilquifitions, by analyhng the 
real ftate' of mankind, and examining, with anato- 
mical accuracy and minutenefs, the internal Jlruciure 
of fociety^ that the fcience of governrnent can alone 
be brought to the fame heiglith of perfedion. 

Many inquiries, it is certain, have, at various pe- 
riods, been made, into the political circumftances of 
nations : Unfortunately, however, they have uni- 
formly been inftitutcd, with a view of afcertaining 

the 



( xili ) 

fhe flate of the country, for the purpofes of taxation 
and of war, and not of national improvement. Their 
cbjecl has been, not to meliorate the condition of 
the people, but to fiH the exchequer,, or the armies 
of the flate * ; and the utmofl that could be expell- 
ed from them, was to render taxation, and other 
public burdens, lefs unequal. But, in modern times, 
more extenfive and more important objects of in- 
veftigation have been pointed out. Real flatefmen, 
and true patriots, no longer fatisfied with partial and 
defective views of the fituation of a country, are 
now anxious to afcertain the real (late of its agri- 
culture, its manufactures, and its commerce, — the 
means of improvement, of which they are refpedtive- 
ly capable— the amount of the population of a (late, 
and the caufes of its Lncreafe or decreafe — the man- 
ner in which the territory of a country is poflefFed 
and cultivated — the nature and amount of the various 
productions of the foil — the value of the perfonal 

wealth 

* Salluft, in his Orat. ad Caefarem de Republ. ordln. II. i. 
cap. i. has clearly explained the objeds of antient ftatefmen. 
*• In rei:ublica, cognol'cenda, multam, magnamque, curam ha- 
" bui, uti quantum, armis^ virij, cfiilentia, ea poffit, cognitum 
" habcrem." From Townfend's Travels to Spain, vol. 3. p. 
348, it appears, that in 1575, Philip II. propofed making fimi- 
lar refearches, on a very great and extenfive fcale ; but they 
never feem to have been brought to any conclufion. In Pruffia, 
in Sweden, in Saxony, in Sardinia, and in Tufcany, fuch plans 
have been attempted ; but rather with a view of afcertaining 
the prefent flate, than the means of future improvement.

Impreffed with thefe ideas, in the month of May 1790, 
I circulated amongft the clergy of the Church of Scot- 
land, a number of Queries, for the purpofe of elucidat- 
ing the political ftate of my native country. Nothing 
could be more flattering than the reception they met 
with, from that learned and refpedtable body. Scot- 
land is divided into about 950 parochial diftrifts; an'dj 
in lefs than eighteen months, reports were received 
from above one half of that number. The returns 
that were tranfmitted, alfo, were not trifling or fui- 
perficial ; but, in general, fuch as might be expedled 
from men of extenfive knowledge, and of found 
abilities, acquainted with the various topics to which 
their attention was direded. With fo much zeal, 
indeed, have they entered into this inquiry, that, ia 
lefs than three or four years from its commence- 
ment^

jnent, this great and extenfive furvey will probably 
be completed. 

Aflonlfhed with fo rapid a progrefs, and convin- 
ced that the moft important and beneficial confe- 
quences muft be derived from it, to Europe in gene- 
ral, but more efpecially, to thefe kingdoms of Great 
Britain and Ireland, I flatter myfelf, that it will not 
be deemed improper or prefumptuous, to fubmit, to 
perfons of power and authority abroad, the proprie? 
ty of carrying on, in other ftates, fimilar inveftiga- 
tions. It is an undertaking which, though great and 
laborious, yet may be effedled in fmaller kingdoms, by 
the exertions of one individual ; and, in the greatefi: 
empires, by any body of men conftituted for that pur- 
pofe. In order to explain its nature, and the beft means 
of carrying it into execution, there is herewith printed, 
an analyfis of the ftatiftical account of a parochial dif- 
tridt, a table which may render fuch accounts lefs ob- 
fcure or voluminous, and fpecimens of the accounts of 
certain diftricls in Scotland, in many refpeas diffe- 
rent from each other, and including almofl every 
poflible variety. 

If fimilar furveys were inftituted in the other 
kingdoms of Europe, it might be the means of efta- 
bhfhing, on fure foundations, the principles of that 
mofl: important of all fciences, to wit, political ox Jla^ 
iijlical philofophy. 1 hat is the fcience, which, in pre- 
ference to every other ought to be held in reverence.

No fcience can furnlfli, to any miud capuble of re- 
ceiving ufcful information, fo much real entcrtidn- 
ment ; none can yield fuch important hints, for the 
improvement of agriculture, for the extenfion of com- 
mercial inriuftry, for regulating the conduft of indivi- 
duals, or for extending the profperity of the (late; 
none can tend fo much to promote the general hap- 
pinefs of the fpecies.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1011416">DINGWALL</name>. 
(County of Rofs.') 
By the Rev. Mr Daniel Rose.</head> 

<p>Situation and Boundaries. 

THE parifii of* Dingwall, fituated at the weft end of the 
Frith of Cromarty, lies in the prefbytery of Dingwall, 
of which the town of that name is the feat, and in the fynod 
and county of Rofs. It is bounded on the eaft by the parifh 
of Kiltearn ; on the north lie a vaft tra£t of high mountains ; 
and on the Weft and fouth by the parifli of Fodderty. That 
part of the parifli of Urquhart, called Ferrintofli, lies on the 
ikirt to the fouth-eaft ; but ffom it Dingwall is divided by 
the river Conan, which, at high water, is widened to about 
half a mile by the influx of the fea. 



Vol. III. 



^ Statijlical Account 

The Na:ne nvd GcncralJppearance.-Tht name was iorm.r^ 
h Dingnnval or Di.snavalUs,. ^nd took its origin from t,he 
nchncfs and fertility of the foil of the rower "qrouncIs, which 
form a confiderable part of the parifl,. Exchuling a fmall 
•d.ftr.dt, peopled -by-few inhabitants, and divided from the 
reft by a high hill, tliis parifh forms nearly an oblong bf one 
and a half by tt^-io miles. It confifts partly of a pretty exten 
five valley, and partly of the Hoping fides of hills, a great 
portion of which is in a high ftate of cultivation. The wafte 
ground is not very confiderable, and there are no commons 
in the parifh ; the great bulk of the land is in culture ; and 
the whole forms a beautiful interchange of hill and valley^ 
wood and water, corn-fields and meadow?. 

&amp;//.— The foil over the whole, pariHi is abundantly fertile,, 
and the greater part is uncommonly rich. It generally con- 
iTfts of ^ deep loam, or clay mixed with a confiderable quan- 
tity of vegetable mould, which, in feafons of any tolerable 
mildnefs, and witlvan ordinary degree of gaod culture, fel- 
dom, if ever, fails to produce luxruriant crops. Every kind 
• of pulfe, and all the culmiferous-gra'ins are accordingly foun^i 
to thrive well in this parifli. ^ut, from the flatnefs of the 
ground in the lower parts, and the fleepnefs of the neigh- 
bouring hills, together with the nature, of the foil, a wet fea- 
foh- is always uncommonly pernicious to its produce. It re- 
tards the labour of the farmer both in fpring and in autul^ti, 
to a degree not experienced in other places, v.'hich "arc neither 
more favourably fituated with refpe£t to climate, nor nearly 
equal in point of fertility of foil. 

Climale. — The climate of this part of the country is upon 
the whole tolerably good. It is not fubje£l to any deftrudtive 
inundations, nor has it: more frequent rains than moft other 

parts 



of DihgzcalL ^ 

prirts of the kingdom ; but it is expofed to high 'winds, 
T/hich, though never rifing to any fignally pernicious violence, 
are often inconvenient to' the inhabitants, and Ibmetimes 
hurtful to the growing corn. The wiilter is not attended 
Xfith any peculiar degfee of feverity. 

Difeafes. — This diftridl has never been rejiiarlcable for the 
prevalence of any peculiar difeafe- To periodical vilits.of the 
fmall pox we are expofed in common with every part of the 
kingdom. It returns after unequal and uncertain intervals ; 
but it feldom gives us a longer refpite than from fix to eight* 
years. The laft fummer it was, in the natural way, extreme- 
ly mortal. This dillrefsful circuniftance, however, was at- 
tended with fome happy confequences. It opened the eyes 
of the lower clafles of people to the advantages of inocula- 
tion, againft which their prejudices had before been as vio- 
lent as they were general. 

Mineral Springs. — All along the fide of the hill, fronting 
the fouth, which forms the northern part of the parifh, there 
£ye irdneral fprings Urongly impregnated with fulphur. One 
of them at Drynie appears nearly, if not fully, as ftrong as a 
ipring in the neighbouring parilh of Fodderty, which has 
been found extremely efficacious in curing a variety of cuta- 
neous difeafes. 

Rivers and FjJIjlngs. — There are fome rivulets in the pa- 
rifli, but no river except Conan. In theie fome excellent 
trouts are cauj^ht ; but they are fo few as never to be 
brought to market. The (Jonan is not, nor probably ever 
can be made, navigable lor large vcflels. On this river, how- 
ever, there is a very productive falmon fifliery. The time 
allowed by law for fifliing, is from the 30th of November to 

the 



4 Staiijiical Accmnt 

the 26th of Auguft; but, on account of the frofl in the win- 
ter, or tlie quantities of rain, which, by falling in the hills 
where the river has its fourccs, Iceep it too high to admit of 
Iiauling the nets, there is generally no regular fifhing till the 
fpring is well advanced, Thpugh there are cruives • on the 
river, the water runs above them in the almoft inceffant 
floods which happen previous to that time ; and nioft of the 
£fh getting over the dykef, a great number is leldom caught 
in the cheft % before March or April. When fold to the 
people of the country, 2d. a pound is the ufual price of the 
^refli fifli throughout the feafon. 

There is belonging to the public good of Dingwall, a ftell 
ialmon fifhery on Conan, or a fifliery on that part of the 
river into which ths Tea flo\vs. Five and twenty years ago, 
it brought no rent, but is now let at L. 18 : 10 per annum. 

Sea. — The Tea, at high water, waOies a confiderable part of 
the parifh, running in apparent canals, in feveral direfticns, 
^long the fide of the towa, and forms a beautiful variety of 
iflets and peninfulas. But, even in this ftate, it is very Hial- 
low for feve.-al miles down the frith ; and, at low water, 

recedes to the diftance of near four miles, leaving nothing 
but a flimy ftrand, which makes it unfit for the navigation 
pf any large vefitls, adverfe to the produdlion of fifli of al- 
mofl. any kind, flounders excepted, and barren of all objedls 
which merit the attention of the naturalift, the farmer, or 
the politician. 

The goods imported to this place from London, Glafgow, 
Leith, and other manufafturing and trading towns are car- 
ried in the London and Leith fmacks, which maintain a 
conftant communication every three weeks or month at

moft, between the fouthern and northern parts of the king- 
dom. There arc in this parilh only two boats ; one of whicU 
is very fmall, plies at high water, between Dingwall and 
Ferrintofli, the other ferves for the carriage of bulky arti- 
cles from place to place, 

^tarries. — Three quarries have been opened in this pa- 
rilh. The ftones in one of them, which is not now ufed, 
were of a very indifferent quality, being apt to moulder into 
fand, when long expofed to the weather. Another, the 
property of the public, and difcovered within thefe fifteen 
years, is of a much better quality. Its ftones, though hard, 
are extremely uleful in all thoie parts of houfes where hewn- 
work is not neceffary, and lying within a quarter of a mile 
of the town, they have contributed not a little to its im- 
provement and increafe, The third quarry, which is of a 
fine light blue colour, is private property. It is of a ftill fu- 
perior quality, as it is fit for hewn as well as for coarfc 
work, and is capable of a very fine polifli. It has, however, 
pne difadyantage ; there is a fmall intermixture of iron ore, 
upon which the rain in time operates, and ftains in a very 
ugly manner the contiguous ftones. 

Doynejl'tc and Wild Animals. — The domeftic quadrupeds 
and birds are fuch as are ufually found in every other part of 
the country. There are plenty of hares, and at a little dif- 
lance, great numbers of red-deer. Once, and, only once, 
the minifter faw two roe deer in the parifti. They were 
probably driven by the feverity of the weather, from the 
woods amoHg the neighbouring hills, to thofe in the lower 
part of the country, where better fiielter and more eafy ac- 
cefs to pafture were found. There are feme foxes, with 
the ufiial fmaller kind of quadrupeds. 

The 



p. Siai\/l:cal Account 



The ftationai-y birds are of the common kinds. Plenty cf: 
partridges, gioule, black game, plovers, and water- fowl, oi'' 
Various fpecies.- The migratdry birds are pretty numerous,^ 
They are the bernacie or rood-goofe, the woodcock, land- 
rail, lapwing, cuckcoo, fieldfare, red\^'ing, fwallow, rnoijo- 
tain-finclv or fnow-ilake, and fbmetimes the Bohemian oljat- 
terer. The latter appears felddtn, ■.but then it comes in great 
flocks, feeding upon the berry "or the mount?in-afli j all the 
former are very .'plentiful in this parifh. 

. ^rees. — The vegetable produdlions of the parifh are fuch 
as are common to the whole country. There are few trees 
isdeed of ipontaneous growth, except alders, which abound- 
ed much fome yedrs ago, but are now rapidly giving place to 
corn and grafs fields.

other fheriff courts of the county. It is remarkable, however, 
that this bufinefs has greatly decreafed. fince Ferrintofli was de-

Statijlical AccounU 



All the inhabitants of this parifli are of the eflabljnied 
church, two Secedcrs excepted, and ten families, which are 
either partly, or wholly, of the Epifcopal perfuafion. Thefe 
have here no fixed clergyman ; but they have the ordinances 
of religion occafionally difpenfed among them, by niinifters 
from other parts of the country. 

Uoitfes and their Inhabitants. — The inhabited houfes of e- 
very defcription in the parifh amount to 239, but of fuch as 
are well built, and have two ftories, to about 40. Of the 
fmaller and middling kinds, a good number has been built 
within thefe ten years paft ; but as many others of the fame 
fort have been removed by the converting of feveral fmall 
into three larger farms, there has probably been no very con- 
fiderable increafe of their number. Of the better kind of 
houfes, which are let at from L. 7 to L. 16 per annum^ 
about feventeen have been built in the above period. In 
this account, however, houfes are not included which have 
been ereifted on the fites of others gone to decay, but fuch 
only as were built where no houfes of the fame fize were; 
before, and fo make an addition to the total number of hou- 
fes in the parifh. There is no uninhabited houfe of cottage 
in the town or neighbourhood. The demand, on the con- 
trary, for houfes, particularly for the middling fort, is very, 
great. At an average the number of inhabitants to each 
houfe is 5-^. 

Jgriculture, Produce, ^c. — The greater part of the parifh 
is arable, and produces corn of different kinds, chiefly oats, 

next 

the quarrels and breaches of the peace among the inhabitants, 
were very frequent, and often furniflied a good harveft to the' 
Dingwall procurators. But now that this courfe of biifmefs has 
in a great meafure failed, the people have become much more 
feaceabie.

next barley, then peafe, then wheat, a fetv beans^ and 
pccafionally a very little rye. The quantity of ground for/n 
with oars is about 500 acres, with barley 200, with peafe 
50, and with wheat 10 About 100 acres are annually em- 
ployed in the produ6tion of fown graffes for hay, and about 
double that quantity is pafture ground. Potatoes form a part 
of the food of all, and the greater part of moft, of the pa- 
rifliioners. The culture of them is generally confidered as 
favourable to the ground, and an excellent preparative for 
grafs crops ; becaufe the neceffity of keeping them clean de- 
ftroys the weeds, and th-e general idea of much manure be- * 
ing requifite to infure a good crop ferves to fecure the me- 
lioration of the ground : This latter advantage is great- 
ly increafed by the populoafnefs of the town. The 
people in general collect confiderable quantities of dung, 
which they know not low to ufe to better purpofe than the 
cultivation of this root. They accordingly manure the 
land, plant the potatoes, and keep them clear of weeds; ia 
^opfequence ;of which, the gentlemen or neighbouring far- 
mers allow theni to have ground rent free. Nearly 25 acres 
are annually employed for this purpofe. The cultivation of 
iflax is fo inconiiderable an objefl, that it is left mora 
to the charge of the houfewife, than of the furnier. 
Small patches of hemp, a plant which always thrives re- 
markably well, are fometimes fown ; but it is railed for the 
ii(e of individuals only. Plantations of trees of di£ferenc 
kinds cover at leafl 900 acres of ground. 'Ihey conGfl 
chiefly of Scotch pines, oak, afh, beech, elm, plain, and 
larch. In all thofe plantations there is excellent flielter, and 
in many parts of them very good pallure. 



Seed-time commences about the middle of March ; br.t It 
is as irregular as the climate is variable. For it fometimes

happens, from the feverity of the fpring, that no fowing 
takes place till a month later. The harveft is fubjedl to the 
fame uncertainty, yet it commences in general about the 
beginning of September. 

Horfis and Black Cattle.^llh.^ horfes of all defcriptions a- 
mount to J of thefe 56 are of the larger fort, and 318 
of the fmall country kind. The depth of the roads leading 
to the mofTes, and perhaps the fteepnefs of the afcent, make 
it eligible for the farmers and cottagers to prefer this breed 
qf horfes. Larger ones would certainly fink deeper, and 
perhaps not fo eafily climb the hills. The black cattle, great 
and fmall, fomewhat exceed 600. Many of thefe arp 
draught oxen ; hut they chiefly confift of milk cows and 
young cattle. 

Ploughs and Carts. — Septs ploughs are generally ufed ; 
there are, however, about nine chain-ploughs in the parifh. 
They are fometimes drawn by oxen, generally by horfes, 
but often by a mixture of both. About 18 are drawn by 
oxen, 48 by horfes, and 27 by a mixture of both. The 
vhole number of ploughs in the parifli is 93. In the choice 
of thv fpecies of animals by which they are drawn, the far- 
mers are regulated by the fituation of the grounds, and q- 
ther circumflances. There are only 24 carts, properly fo 
called, in the parifh. Of the fmaller open kind ufed by 
country people in the porth, there are about 2410; but 
thefe being feldom ufed, except in the feafon for drawing 
peats, and in harveft, it is difficult exactly to afcertain their 
pumber. The farmers colIciTt their manure into dunghills, 
and fpread it on their fields, by means of a kind of carts 
failed hllachks. They confift of fmall folid wheels, on 
V^hich a frame is placed, with trams for the horfe , and in 



of Dingwall. 



an opening of the frame, a conical coarfe wicker balket is 
fet, where the dung is carried. In hilly and uneven places, 
their lightnefs may be a reafon for ufing them ; but, in 
places differently lituated, blind attachment to inveterate cus- 
toms can only account for the ufe of them. 

Rent of Land and Houfos. — The annual land rent of the 
parilli is, I am informed, about L; i 20c. Ihe rents of the 
houfes are difficult to afcertain. It may not be improper, 
however, to obferve, that fuch houfes as day-labourers and 
fervants occupy, are cdmmonly let at from 15 s. to 21s. 

Church, t^c.-^Thc living of this pafifli is L. 58, 32 bolls 
of oat-meal, 9 Hones Dutch weight to the boll; and 16 
bolls of barley, country meafure, which is confiderably lar- 
ger than the Linlithgow; Eight bolls were the common 
rent of the glebe, when it was let to a farmer. It conlills of 
about eight Scots adres. Tile prefent "minifter is a batchelor, 
and has been fettled in the parifli upwards of 10 years. 
The King is patron. Within thefe two years, a commodi- 
bus good nianffe was built. The church is nearly a ruin. It 
had coniieded with it, by wide arches, one large chapel, and 
feveral fm'all ones, which were probably ufed both as ce.Be- 
teries Snd places of devotion. They have long been fliut 
out from the church, and ufed only as burying places. The 
heritors have it in contemplation to build a new church foon. 
Which will be both convenient for the pariQiioners, and or- 
namental to the town. 

Thd heritors, including proprietors of burgage tenements, 
amount to 39. But, ftriaiy Ipealcing, there are only two, for 
there are only two feparate valuations in the parifli ; viz. the 
valuation of the eftate of Tulloch, and the magiftracy of 
Dingwall. Upwards of four-fifths of thefe proprietors live

in the town ; of the two wealthien-, one only refides occa- 
fionally in the pariOi, and the other has his pfincipal fa- 
mily feat in the neighbourhood. 

Poor.' — The number of poor in the parifh who receive 
aid from charitable funds, is 58, of which 8 are males, and 
50 females. The annual amount of the weekly contributions 
for their relief is extremely Imall, viz. about L. 7 or L. 8. 
A fum of money, however, at interefi-, yields L. 35. In the 
number of poor are included thofe who, although not wholly 
unable to work, are incapable by their labour to earn what is 
fufficient for their own er their families fubfillence. None 
are admitted on the poor's roll, or obtain occafional aid from 
the funds, without previoufly acknowledging the feffion to 
have a claim on the efi-efts they may chance to leave, to 
the full extent of the fums they have received. 

Prjfoners. — In the courfe of the year 1790, there were 18 
perfons confined in the jail of this town. Of thefe there 
were imprifoned for debr 1 1, for petty theft 5, for horfe 
and flieep ftealtng one ; and one woman, from a diftant part 
of the country, has lain here under fentence of tranfporta- 
tion, fince the autumn circuit 17S9. But in this parilh no 
murder has been committed for thefe Ia(t 40 years nor has 
an individual been baniflied. 

School.— ^The parochial is the only fchool in the parifli*- 
The fchoolmafler's falary from the town and parifli, amounts 
to L. 16; his emoluments as feffion-clerk, to L. 3 : 10; and 
the fchool- fees, communihus afinis, to L. 24. He has alfo a 
very good houfe with a garden from the town. The num- 
ber of fcholars is variable, from 60 to 80. TJie prefent

hiafter's knowledge fully qualifies him for his olEce,' and 
his afliduity is unwearied. 

Price of Proviftons^ Labour^ ^c. — The prices of provifionsi 
within thefe 30 years paft have undergone a great alteration. 
At the commencement of that pferiod, mutton, pork, even 
beef, &amp;c. were fold in the lump, by the quarter, or the 
whole carcafe. I^rom 8 d. to i o d. was the ufual price of a 
quarter of good niutton, as," 6d. of d quarter of pork, and 
5 s. 6 d. or 6 s. bf an exceeding good quarter of beef. Now 
the average price of all thefe kinds of meat is 3d. per pound, 
which is at leaft double their former value; A good fat 
goofc was then fold at 10 d. a duck at 3 d. and a fowl at 
2td. They flow fetch twice as much money. Butter was 
then bought at 6 s. a ftone ; it is now fold at from i 2 s. to 
14 s. common country made cheefe at 2 s. or 2 s. 6d, at 
molt; now it is nevef under 5s,' Barley and oat-meal were 
commonly fold at that period for 8 s. or i o s. a boll ; they 
have not for many years been under 16 s. Hovv much fo- 
cver thefe changes may evince the general increafed profpe- 
rity of the country, they neverthelefs bear very hard on in- 
dividuals, Vvhofe livings are ftationary at a certain allowance 
in money. 

The wages of a common labourer are 6 d. a day, and 
of mafons and houfe- carpenters, from i s; to i s. 6 d.- 
Suppofing a labourer to have conftant employment the 
whole year, he vyill earn L. 7 : 16. His wife, though

L. 9 : 1 6. Large families are, however, on fucli reared,' and 
often on fmciUer incomes, with the afliftance of a fmall field 
for potatoes, and perhaps a little patch of ground for greens, 
cultivated after hours of labour, or when other employment 
is not to be got. How this wretched pittance is diftributed 
ariiong the variety of objefts which are neccffary to human life, 
jn a very limple ftate, and how it is made fufficient for thft 
lubfiftence ot a family, is inconceivable. But habits of frugal 
management, taught by poverty to the indigent, are found 
to effe£t what the affluent do not imagine, and cannot eafily 
believe. 

Roads and Bridges. — The roadS In this parifli are exceed^ 
Jngly deep in winter. Their badncfs may be attributed iii 
part to the nature of the foil through which they pafs j but 
it is owing aUb to the not adopting a proper method in the 
reparation of themi One public road leads acrofs Cohan, 
•which forms a communication between the very populous 
diftridt of Ferrintofh and this town. From a defire to fave la- 
bour or time, the ford is ohen attempted, when the tide is 
too far advanced, or the river too liigh, and the confequence 
Is frequently fatal. A bridge over this river would not only 
be a vaft accommodation to travellers, but would alfo be a 
mean of faving many lives. There are two excellent bridges 
on a rivulet, in tlie courfe of the public roads; two, how- 
ever, are ftill vtrarited, one over each of the burns which 
form the fouth and eaft boundary of the parifh. 

jintiquity and Government of the Borough, — This town had 
its charter of eredtion into a royal borough, from Alexan- 
der 11. in the year 1226. By this charter, which another 
granted in the reign of James IV. confirmed, the town was 
empowered to chofe a ptovbft, two bailies, a dean-of-gu!ld, a 

treafurer- 



of Dingwall.

trcafurer, and 10 counfellors. It was alfo entitled to ajl the 
privileges, liberties, and communities, pofleffed by the town 
of Invernefs. The town is one of tl).? five boroughs, con- 
ftituting the northern diftritSl ; and, in common with Kirk- 
wall, Wick, Dornoch, and Tain, fends a member to Parlia- 
ment. 

The Aniient fize of the Toww.— There are fome circum- 
ftances which would feem tp indicate, that the town was 
oncp much more extenfive than it is now. The crofs now 
ftands at the eaft end of this borough; bift a ftreet of about 
200 yards long runs from it to the north eaft ; and a gentle- 
man of the town in digging fqme time ago for manure^ 
found the remains of 3 caufeway at the diftance of 300 or 
400 yards, in a line fouth eaft from the crofs. The former 
bad few houfes built along it, till 30 or 40 years ago^ and 
the latter has yet i^oqe near it. Thefe circumftances, how- 
ever, afford fome kind of prefumption, that the antient 
might l^ave exceeded the prefent lize of the place. 

Ruins of the Ca/i/e.-r-The ftreet north eaft of the crofs, 
leads to the ruins of what once w^as the principal refidence 
pf the Earls of Rofs. This building, fituated clofe to the 
|liore, had on three fides an. extenfive' plain. It was fituated 
at a confiderable diftqnce from any rifing ground, and a little 
river with a deep flimy channel, into which the fea flowed, 
winded about two of its fides. It feems to have been a re- 
gular fortification, which in thofe days was v/ell adapted for 
defence. The caftle was built at the weft end. A part of it, 
which ftill remains, has the ftones fo ftrongly cemented witl^ 
the mortar that it is eafier to break a folid rock, than to fe- 
parate thofe of which it is compofed. To the north eaft, 
|)u^ contiguous to the caftle, there is an are^ of about half an 

acre 



Siati/lical Account 



acre which ,was inclofed. The whole was furrounded with a 
deep ditch, and a regular glacis ftill remains. After the for- 
feiture of the Earl, the proprietor of the eftate of Tulloch 
was appointed hereditary conftable of the caftle, and the 
trifling falary of 2o merks, or L. i : 2 : 2-f Sterling, is to this 
day annexed to the office. This Earl was once one of the 
moft powerful of the Scottifh barons. He was proprietor of 
a great part of this country ; and many of our moft coniider- 
able families poflefled their lands by charters from him, 
dated apud cajjrum nofirum de Dingwall. His male reprefen- 
tative is Munro Rofs of Pitcalnie, Efquire. 

About 25 years ago, the annual revenue of the borough 
did not exceed 7* now upwards of L. xco. This 

vaft increafe arofe chiefly from the feuing out of commonries 
to the gentlemen and other inhabitants of this place, for the 
purpofe of their being converted into arable ground, or 
otherwife improved. P^rt of thefe were of excellent foil 
perfeftly level, contiguous to the town, and of eafy cultufe j 
all of them were good fubjeifls of improvement, of one kind 
or other, if the inhabitants of the town, fome centuries ago, 
were either as numerous, or as wealthy as they are at pre- 
fent, their wants mud indeed have been few, or they thera- 
felves extremely ignorant and inadtive, when they left wafte 
fuch tracts of Innds, which y/ere fo eafily convertible into 
fertile fields or thriving plantations. The town has of late 
been greatly enlarged^ as well as improved in the appearance 
pf its houfes. This change appears to be chiefly owing to 
that fupcrior tafte, and fpirit of improvement, which gene- 
rally prevail, together with the accidental influx of money 
through private channels. Articles are now in univerfal de- 
mand, which were formerly unknown ; and things once 
known, are now come into general ufe. To obtain thefe ar- 
ticles, the people refort to the town, where they arc to be 

fouHd ; 



I 

of DingivalU if 



found J and accordingly, a large retail trade is carried on 
here, confidering the fize of the place. This trade could 
not fail of introducing additional weahh, and its confe- 
quences luxury, and improvements of various kinds. Be* 
lides, the gentlemen of this neighbourhood, are in general 
fond of a country life, and are happily attached to their own 
family feats. Their ftyle of living, and their expences, are 
widely different from thofe of their anceftors. Much of the 
money they circulate mud centre in the neighbouring town, 
and men of trade or buiinefs feldom allow it to pafs through 
their hands without retaining fome portion of it. Thofe 
means of improvement exift much more in Dingwall than in 
either of the other two boroughs of the county. For thefe, 
lying at the extremities of the fhire, do not feel fo much the 
advantages of local lituation, and have nat been happy enough 
to experience in the fame degree the favours of fortune. Of 
the three boroughs, Dingwall is accordingly by much the moft 
flourifhing. 

Eighteen years ago, a very neat fpire was built over the 
fteeple of the town-houfe, and it was furnifhed with an ex- 
ceedingly good clock. And feven or eight years ago, the 
ftreets were new paved. 

The town of Dingwall is the centre of the county of 
Rofs, with refpedl to local fituation, to the value of the pro- 
perty on all fides, and to the refidence of the inhabitants. 
Nature, therefore, and common fenfe, both point it out as 
the moft proper place for the tranfaftion of all the moft public 
bufinefs of the fhire. The convenience of gentlemen, and 
the intereft of the people, both require that it fliould have 
this privilege. 

Mifullaneous Ob/ervatlons— This parifli is very happily fitu- 
ated. Though the branch of the fea on which it lies is not

Iiavigable bj^ large vefTels, yet it furniflies a water commtinTi 
cation with all the maritime parts of the kingdom \ and 
though it does not produce mueh variety of fifli, yet it fup- 
plies the means of an eafy conveyance of the produce of the 
country, to the markets of the town. Befides, the parifli 
lies in the centre of a fertile and well inhabited country. It 
}3 conveniently (Ituated in refpeft to the midland and "wef- 
tern highlands. Moft of the roads from them meet in this 
place, and of courfe it is often well fupplied with their pro- 
duce. From this view, it muft be obvious, how well it is 
fituatcd for mofl kinds of manufa£\ares. There is abun- 
dance cf people in the parifh and neighbourhood, who 
would be glad of employment living is comparatively mo- 
derate ; the home market for feveral forts of manufadlures 
would by no means be inconHderable and a communica- 
tion with the foreign market would always be eafy and open. 
. Gaelic is ftill the language of the common people, in 
which, therelbre, the greater part of public worfliip is per- 
formed. But moft of the parifliioners now underfrand and 
fpeak Englilli. TJiere are comparatively few of the younger 
people who were not early fent to fchool, and taught both to 
read and to write. 

In this, parifh there are two inns, and nineteen ale or 
whilky houfes. The former are kept by well behaving rc^ 
fpe£t?.ble people ; they are frecfuented by travellers, and ufed 
for public meetings. Of the ale-houfes only feven are re- 
gularly licenfed. Moft of this defcription, indeed, whether 
licenftfU or not, are the worft of nuifances. They not only 
endanger the morals of the people, by furnifhing fecrct op- 
portunities of indulging a propenfity to drunkennefs, but by 
encouraging theft in fervants, and by diverting the earnings 
of mechanics and labourers, and the produaions of farmers, 
from the fupport of their familieB. It is, therefore, a falfe 

and 



of - Dingwall, xg 



and pernicious len'itf, which, under the pretext of charity, 
k fometimes fhewn to fuch traders; for indulgence to thetn, 
often proves ruin to the innocence and welfare of thou- 
fands. 

The lower order of people is not remarkable for any eJc- 
traordinary degree of hofpitality. Living in a country well 
inhabited, and much reforted to by ftrangers, and not en- 
joying thofe means of wealth which arife from extenfivc 
commerce, or regular manufaftures, this virtue cannot have 
much rooni 'to exert itleif among this clafs. According to 
their fituatiori, however, they are by no means unwilling to 
fhare what they poffefs, either in the way of hofpitality or 
charity. The more wealthy are noted for their hofpitality 
and attention to ftranjgers. lAixury is a vice with which the 
people cannot be charged. I wi£h truth permitted me to 
fay that they always had abundance of the necelTaries cif life; 
Indeed, total want is a thing little known in this part of the 
country; but between that and aoy approach to luxury, the dir- 
tance is very great, and the intermediate flages are extreme- 
ly numerous. In general, the people are fober and induftri- 
ous, decent in their behaviour, and fubmillive to the laws. 
Every country furnilhes fome e^xreptions to the good charac- 
ter of its inhabitants. There are no temptations to any ex- 
traordinary cxpences ^ neither commerce nor manufa£lures 
have yet given fcope for dangerous fpeculations and the 
peo{4e ftill retain that fond attachment to patrimonial inhe- 
ritances, however trifling, which the feudal inftitutions in- 
fpired. The lands, however, fometimes change their pro- 
prietors, and when fold, the price is high, perhaps 30 years 
purchafe ; and it is ftill daily advancing. 

The parilh is fufficient to fupply itfelf and the town with 
provifions. Indeed, on this fubjecT:, it is difiicuit to f(;eak 
mil any degree of certainty ; for moft of the barley which 

the 



2o Stati/iical Account 

the parifli produces is fold to diftillers, and many of the 
cattle arc purchafed by drovers. The Dingwall butchers are 
therefore often obliged to go to a diftance for cattle, fheep, 
&amp;,c. and the mechanics furnifti themfelvcs with their fum- 
mer-meal from other parts of the country. It is difficult to 
draw the balance between thofe exports and imports ; but, on 
the whole, it is probably in favour of the parilh. 

Near the church an obelifk ftands, which, though of no 
great antiquity, attrafts the notice of all travellers. It is 
crcdted on an artificial mount, the bottom of which covers 
about two-thirds of an Englifti acre. The obelilk is fix feet 
fquare at the bafe, and riles in a pyramidal form to the 
height of 57 feet. It was erefted by George firfl: Earl o^^ 
Cromarty, fecretary of ftate for Scotland in the reign of 
Queen Anne, and was intended to ornament and diftinguifh 
?his rpot, which he defigtied to be the family burying-place.

NUMBER II. 
PARISH OF <name ref="NA">PETTY</name>, 

(County of Imernefs,') 
By the Rev. Mr WiLLiAM Smith.</head> 



<p>Name^ Extent, and Boundaries, 

THE parifh confifts of the original parifli of Petty, and 
the' parifli of Briachlich, which was annexed to it. 
At this laft place there are ftill the remains of a church or 
chapel. There is no account, traditional or written, when 
this annexation took place. 

This parifli lies in the prefl^ytery of Invernefs, and fynod 
of Moray, and in the county of Invernefs, excepting a fmall 
fpot that belongs to the county of Nairn. It extends along 
the fouth fide of the Moray Frith, about eight miles ia 
length, and near half that much in breadth. It is bounded 
by that Frith on the N. or N. W. by the pariflies of Airder- 
fier and Nairn on the N. E. by that of Croy, on the E. the 
S. E. and S. and by the parifli of Invernefs on the S. W. 

Surface^ — It is nearly of the form of a rectangle. 
The greater part of it is flat or nearly level : but the ground 
rifes conlider?bly to the fouth, and, in one place, be- 
tween the plain and the Frith. The face of the coun- 
try is very agreeable, as the parifli contains large trails 
of cultivated fields ; and, where the ground rifes towards 
the fouth, the fields are feparated by rills of water, fall- 



Siati/lical Account 



ing in fome places over rocks ; there are clumps of foreft 
trees almoft at every farm houfe. But what contributes 
moft of all to the rural beauty of this place, is, that the Earl 
of Moray has, within the laft twenty years, inclofed and 
planted, in different places, at leaft 500 acres of what was 
till then bleak and barren heath. Thefe plantations con- 
lifted at firft almoft entirely of Scots firs j but, as the firs 
grew up, they were weeded and thinned, to make room 
for trees of a more valuable kind, chiefly oaks, which thrive 
amazingly well, to which the firs ferve as a fhelter. While 
thefe plantations thus decorate the country, the weedings arc 
of fome uie to the inhabitants for firing and other purpofes. 

Air, Climate, and Difeafes — The air in this part of the coun- 
try is ferene, and the climate dry. Though the ground in 
general is rather flat and low, there are no marfhes nor ftag- 
naring water in it, to occaCon noxious vapours. The high 
hills in the neighbourhood attract the clouds, efpecially dur- 
ing the fummer months, fo that this parifli fuffers frequent- 
ly b)- excefllve drought at that feafon of the year, while 
places at no great diftance have no reafon of complaint on 
that account. 

The people of this place are not liable to any peculiar lo- 
cal difeafes, but are in general as healthy as their neighbours. 
As they have not yet been prevailed upon to innoculate for 
the fmall-pox, when a malignant kind of that difeafe pre- 
vails, which generally happens once in five or fix years, it 
fweeps away a number of children. 

This parifh cannot be accounted remarkable for the longe- 
vity of its inhabitants. There are at pfefent a few perfons 
in it above 80 years old ; feveral above 70 ; and many near, 
that age. 

Population^ 



of Petty* 1% 

Population, — There was an a6lu'dl numeration raadc of the 
catechefable perfons in this parifh, about ^ 6 years ago, when 
they amounted to about 1370. Since that time the popula- 
tion has diminifhed ; for by a recent numeranon for the pur- 
pofe of this ftatement, the number of perfons above eight 
years old is 1302, and of children under that age is 216, in 
all 1518 fouls. In Dr Webfter's report, the number of fouls, 
is 1643. 

The population of this parifh- appears to have undergone 
very great changes, during the lafl: century and a half. For, 
by an old regifter of births, that has every appearance of ac- 
curacy, the average of births for the ten years, between 1650 
and 1660, is 51. From that time till 1704, there is no re- 
gifter extant ; but, from the year laft mentioned down to the 
prefent time, there are regifters of the births and marriages, 
but with chafms of fome years in different places, and appear- 
ances of negligence and inaccuracy. During the ten years 
from 1704 to 1714, the population appears to have been 
very great \ for the average of births recorded is 71, and of 
marriages 16. But, from that period downwards to the pre- 
fent, it has been conrtantly decreafing ; fometimes rapidly, 
and at other times more flovvly. What is very remarkable, 
tlie average of births for the ten years, between 1750 and 
1760, is 50, that is, nearly the fame that it had been a cen- 
tury before. Since the 1760, it has continued to diminifli, 
till it has come to the ftate already mentioned. What is the 
average of births at prefent, or for the lafl ten years, cannot 
be afcertained with exaiStncfs, as the regifler has not been 
kept with accuracy. 

Different caufes have contributed to diminifli the popula* 
tion of this parifh, during the laft thirty years. Though 
the farms in this parifh are far from being large, they were 
fmaller, and of courfe more numerous, before that time. 

Some 



Statljlical Account 



Some tenants had not only cottagers, as at prefcnt, under 
them, but parcelled out part of their farms to fubtenants, 
who alfo had cottagers under them. 

But the chief caufe of the decreafe of population is fear- 
city of fuel. That neceflary article of life, which half a 
century ago was tolerably plenteous, has of late years be- 
come extremely fcarce. 

CharaEier and Manners of the People — The inhabitants of 
this parifh are in general fober, peaceable, and induftrious. 
Crimes of an attrocious nature arc extremely rare, or rather 
unknown among them. Though they are far from being 
Tinfocial, but have pretty frequent convivial meetings, as at 
weddings and the like, yet, after fpending fome hours chear- 
fuUy together, they fcparate in a peaceable and friendly 
manner. Drinking to exceCs and quarrelling are accounted 
reproachful, and, therefore, perfons addidled to thefe vices 
are avoided. They appear to be fatisfied with their condi- 
tion ; and moft of them are eafy in their circumftances ac- 
cording to their ftations, nay, fome of them have even made 
a little money. But it mull: alfo be acknowledged, that fome, 
from want of induflry and oeconomy, and fome from mif*- 
fortune, or from having very large families, are in very 
ftraitened circumftances. They are very ready, according to 
their abilities, to relieve the indigent and diftrelTed, efpecial-. 
ly fuch as have been reduced to that condition by calamity 
or misfortune. They arc fair and honeft in their dealings, 
and obliging to one another. 

In their manners they fliew a good deal of attachment to 
old fafliions and habits. Though, from their frequent inter- 
courfe with people that fpeak the Englifli language, it might 
be expe£led that they would have acquired fome knowledge 
of it, yet the Gaelic continues in general ufe among them.

Moft of them can fpeak nothing elfe, and the few that can 
fpeak the Englifli do it but very hnperfeaiy. The High- 
land drefs is ftill retained by them in a great meafurc. The 
plaid is almoft totally laid afide ; but the fmall blue bonnet, 
the ftiort coat, the tartan kilt and hofe, and the Highland 
brogues are ftill the ordinary drefs of the men. The women 
in like manner retain the Highland drefs of their fex, but 
have adopted more of that of their low country neighbours 
than the men. 

Occupation and Div'ifion of the Inhabitants, — There are no 
towns, no villages, no manufadlures in this parilh. All the 
inhabitants are farmers, cottagers employed by them, or arti- 
ficers employed by both. Belides the ordinary farmers, or 
tenants and cottagers having huts from them, there is a great 
number of crofters, who have been planted by the proprie- 
tors in wafte ground to improve it. The number of farmers 
i« not lefs than ninety ; three or four of them have pretty 
large farms, paying L. i oo, L. 8®, and L. 60 Sterling yearly ; 
but the more general run is not above L, 20 or L. 25 of 
yearly rent, and there are a good many of them even below 
L. 1 o. The cottagers are partly fervants and labourers em- 
ployed by the tenants, and partly follow other occupations, 
as taylors, weavers, llioemakers, &amp;c. There are four mills 
in the parifh for grinding the grain. There are al/b fome 
fifliers in the parifli, as many as i7ian two or three boats. 

Heritors aticl Rent. — This parifh is the property of four 
heritors, the Earl of Moray, Arthur Forbes of Culloden, 
Efq; John Campbell of Ciilder, and James Rofe of Brea. 
Their refpeftive valued rents ftand as iollows : viz,

pd, as high as 1 8 s. or 20 s. and Ibme of the bad, as low as 
_c; s. or 6 s.-, but the general run is from 12 s. to 16 s. 

Pcrfonal fervices, called carriages, xyere formerly in ufe in 
this parifh and the neighbourhood ; but, though ftill exafted 
in fome placeg in the neighbourhpod, they have been totally 
(ibolifhed many years ago, to the mutual fatisfadlion both qf 
inafter and tenant. 

None of the heritors of this parifli refide in it. There isj 
9 large old houfe near the church, called Caftleftuart, be- 
longing to the Earl of Moray, wliich was deligned for a feat: 
pf the family ; but it has been for many years out of repair 
^nd uninhabitable. Around this houfe there is a large gar- 
den and orchard, furrounded and fiieltered by large foreft 
trees. The garden is remarkable for different kinds of ex- 
cellent ftraw-berries ; and the orchard for a great number of 
large old trees, bearing the fpecies of fmall cherry, called 
black and red geens. Thefe geen-trees were fent there from 
Kent, about a century ago, by Alexander Earl of Moray. 

Soil, Mode of Cuhivation, atid Produce, -r-Tho. fqil of this 
parilh is various. Some of it is a pretty rich black mould, 
capable, with proper management, of bearing any kind of 
f rops. But the far greater part of it is light and fandy ; yet 
f'ven that light foil might brought to very good ac- 
count 



of Petty. 

tbunt by.artlficijil grafs, and green crops. A few of the oc- 
cupiers of the larger farms have made inclofures ; feme with 
hedge-rows, and fome with flone dykes ; they raife green 
trops, fow artificial grafles, and have adopted the other 
modes of cultivation introduced into the more improved 
parts of the country. But the whole of the ordinary te- 
nantry ftill retain the fame pradices that were followed by 
their predeceffors. Their fields are quite open, — ^there is no 
grafs fownj — no fallow, — no green crops raifed j but barley 
fown with manure, and oats without it, as long as the land 
will produce more than the feed fown in it ; after which it rs 
allowed to reft three years as lee, and then it is broke up toi 
undergo the fame treatment. 

The manure ufed js the dung of the cattle of the farm; 
made into a compoft dunghill, with at leaft twice as much 
earth or fand. Such as live on the fide of the Frith, get 
fome fea-wced or ware, which they lay on their lands, and 
which gives in ftrong lands a good crop of barley ; but th6 
fucceeding crops of oats are generally poorer than after the 
ordinary dung. In light foil the ware does not anfwer when 
the feafon is dry, but opens it too much. 

Though, from the improper management of the lands, thiS; 
parifh does not produce near fo much grain as it otherwift 
might ; yet in the moft unfavourable years, it produces more 
than is fufficient for the maintenance of the inhabitants. The 
price is various ; but in general, the boll of oat-meal weigh- 
ing nine ftone Dutch, is nearly a fliilling cheaper than the 
boll of barley ; and the barley in general fells very nearly at 
the Haddington priced. Befides grain, there is a good deal 
of potatoes raifed, not only by the tenants, but alfo by the 
crofters and cottagers. Some of the tenants raife flax; 
Tvhich the women fpin and get manufadlured into linen.

for domeftic u(c. 

T/i/ie of Salving and Rea^'ifig. — The oats are commonly 
fown in March, or about the beginning of April \ imme- 
diately after the oats are fown, the potatoes are planted j 
after which the barley is fown about the end of April or be- 
ginning of May. The earlieft barley is ripe in the end of 
Auguft or beginning of September. The harveft commonly 
becomes general in September, and is finifhed by the end of 
that month, or the beginning of October. 

Number of Ploughs, Horfes, Cattle, Isfc. — The exa£t num- 
ber of ploughs in this parifli cannot be eafily afcertained. 
But the error will not be great, if they be ftated at an hun- 
dred. The number of horfes is not lefs than 450. Some of 
them are of a pretty large fize, and fo ftout that two of them 
draw a plough ; but the moft of them are very much below 
that fize. The number of black cattle is about 1400, 
mofl:ly oxen ufed in the plough, eight of them together. 
They are of the light nimble Highland breed; when turning 
iinfit for work, they are difpofed of to dealers in cattle for 
the Englifli market. Few of thefe cattle are reared in this 
place ; they are generally brought from the Highlands when 
young. 1 hough there is not much pafture ground in this 
parish, yet moft of the tenants cottagers have flieep. The 
number is about 2500. They are of a very fmall fize, the 
carcafe will not weigh above two fi:one Dutch. The wool is 
fpun by the women, and manufadtured into coarfe cloth for 
domeftic ufe, and the fheep are difpofed of to butchers from 
Invernefs and Fort- George.

Fi/lj, Harbours.— The Frith along the fide of this parifh 
does not abound in firti ; Culloden has on his property what 
is called a Jlel/ fipngy where falmon are caught of an uncom- 
monly excellent quality, bat the quantity is not confidcrable. 
At times haddocks and whitings are found in the Frith, but 
rarely, and of a fmall fize. Haddocks of any fize, and the 
larger kinds of filh, as cod, ling, llcate, &amp;c. are feldom 
found nearer than the coaft of Sutherland or Caithnefs. 
In fome feafons herrings appear in this Frith, and in great 
quantities, and continue feveral months, perhaps from O£lo- 
ber to February j but they generally take three or four years 
to repeat their vifit. Cockles and mufcles are found in the 
ebb, but in no great plenty. About forty years ago, there 
were oyfters in this Frith, but they are now entirely gone, 
except on a fmall fpot oppofite to Culloden's lands, where 
fome are ftill found. Invernefs is the general market for the 
fiHi caught by the fifliers of this place and neighbourhood. 
The landing places on this part of the Frith (for there are 
no harbours) are but indifferent. The water is Ihallow at 
and near the lliore, and at low water the fea retires to a 
great diftance. There are two or three places within this 
parish, where fafe and commodious harbours for fmall veffels 
might be made at a fmall expence. 

Frice of Labour. — Labour is performed chiefly by fervanta 
hired for the half year, who receive ftipulated wages, and 
their maintenance, either in the employer's family, or meal 
in place of it. About forty years ago, the half year's wages 
to an ordinary farm-fervant, including fome fmall perqui- 
fites, was no more than 13 s. 4d. When meal was given in 
place of maintenance, it was at the rate of fix bolls in the 
year, one-third of it oat-meal, and the other two-thirds bar- 
ley-meal, either meafured with the wheat firlot, or weighed, 

at 



Stati/liml Atcount 



at the rate of nine flone Dutch to the boll ; which comes to' 
54 ftone Dutch in the year. A day-labourer at that period 
had 4d. a day with, or 7d. without maintenance. Of latfi 
the wages of both have hetn iHcre^'fing, that of a hired fer- 
vant now is 40 s. in the half year j and that of a day-labour- 
er is 6d. with, and pd. without maintenance. At heavy 
work, fuch as the peat-mofs, harveft, &amp;c. day labourers get 
pd. with, and is. without their victuals. The wages of fe- 
male fcrvants, though it has increafed of late, is ftill more 
moderate than that of the men ; at an average it is about 
15 s. or 1 6s. in the half year, with maintenance, which they 
always receive in the family in which they ferve. 

Servants and labourers having families, live much more 
comfortably than would at firft view be expefted from the 
fmallnefs of their wages. But, befides their wages and meal, 
all of them have fome perquifites from the tenants, along 
with their houfes ; as land to plant potatoes, or fow a little 
barley, a fmall garden for cabbages and greens, gcc. With- 
thefe and the induftry of their wives, they contrive to fi.jp- 
port themfelves, and to bring up a family. 

Roads af/d BnJges.^The military road from Stirling to 
For't George crofles this parifh, that road with two bridges 
on it within this parifli, was made, and is kept in repair by 
government. The military road from Fort George to Fort 
Augullus, pafTes along the whole length of the pariQi ; there 
are four bridges on it. This road was made about twelve 
years ago by the ftatute labour, but has lately been repaired, 
and in fome places altered in the direftion, and four bridges 
have been built upon it, at the public expence. Both thefe 
roads are in excellent repair. The county road from In- 
vernefs to Nairn goes alfo through this parifli ; it was made 

by

Iby the fl:atute labour, and had two or three bridges built or^ 
it at the expence of the coi^nty. 

Poor. — The poor are not numerous in this parilli, but it 
is much infelled with beggars from other places ; for there 
is no regulation in this part of the country to reftrain 
common begging. The funds for the relief of the poor de- 
pend entirely on the weekly colleitions at the church, which 
do not amount to more than L. 5 or L. 6 in the year j fuel 
being fcarce, poor people have not the fame inducement to 
fettle here, as where parochial funds are large and fuel a- 
bounds. 

Cottages pulled down and built. — Within the laft ten years, 
a number of cottages' have been pulled down ; not fewer 
than fifteen or fixteen, and there are at leaft as many empty 
at prefent in the parifh. But, to compenfate in fome mea- 
fure for this diminution, there^have been about ten new 
ones built. So that, within the period above mentioned, 
cottages have become twenty fewer in number than they 
were before. 

Ale-houfes and their EffeEls — In this part of the country, 
the inferior kind of public houfes ought not to be called ale- 
houfes, as formerly, for ale is feldom fold in them. The 
only entertainment to be found in them now is whilky, which, 
is much more expenfive and pernicious than ale. The 
numberrof thefe houfes has been doubled of late. For- 
rperly there were not above ^ve or fix, but now there arc 
not fewer than a dozen ! Hitlaerto there has been no reafon 
to comphin of their having any bad effedls on the morals of 
the people; but the more fober and judicious entertain 
preat apprehenfions that idlenefs, quarrelling, and other bad 

confequences.

confequences, will be produced by fo many temptations to 
drinking Ipirits. 

Church. — The Earl of Moray is patron of the parifli of 
Petty. The church and manfe are near each other, and are 
fituatcd on an eminence facing the fouth eaft, near the head 
of a fmall bay ifliiing out of the Frith. This fituation is 
both heaUhy and agreeable, as it is dry, and commands an 
cxtenCve view of the country ; but the church is fituated ra- 
ther inconveniently for the parifhioners, as, inftead of being 
in or near the center, it is placed on a fpot almoft detached 
from the reft of the parifli. The church was built about 
three and twenty years ago, has received very httle repara- 
tion fince, and appears to be in a fufficient ftate. The 
nianfe was built about forty years ago, and has been repaired 
different times. The ftipend is 78 bolls of barley, 2 bolls of 
oat-meal, and thirty pounds Sterling of money, with about 
ten acres of glebe land, molt of it a poor light foil. The 
prefent incumbent, Mr William Smith, was admitted in 
September 1775, was married in 1779 and has five child- 
ren •, two of them fons, and three daughters. His prede- 
jceflbrs in office were Mr John Morrifon admitted in 1 759, 
who died in November 1774 ; Mr .^neas Shaw admitted in 
1742, who was tranflated to Forres in 17585 Mr Lewis 
Chapman admitted in 1 738, who died in 1741 ; Mr John 
Duncanfon admitted in 1728, who died in 1737; Mr 
Canicl M'Kenzie admitted in 17 19, who was tranflated to 
Jnvernefs in J 727. He was preceded by Mr Alexander Du- 
noon the laft Epifcopal minifter of this parifli, who was 
admitted in 1684, and continued till his death in 1718. 
All the inhabitants of this jparifh are of the eftabliflied 
church. 

School, 



I 



f Peity. 53 

School. — The fchool-houfe was built in a pretty fubftantial 
tnanner in 1784, at about half a mile from the church ; 
which fituation, as being more centrical, is much more con- 
venient for the pariftiioners. A great number of fcholars 
attend the fchool, as even the pooreft of the people are be- 
coming fenfible of the importance of giving fome educatioa 
to their children. The falary is twelve bolls of oat-meal, 
allocated on and paid by the tenants. The fchool fees are 
low, being only r s. in the quarter. The fchoolniafter is al- 
ways feffion-clerk, for which he has a falary of 13 s. 4 d. 
and certain dues, as 6 d. for regirtering each baptifm, mar- 
Hage, &amp;c. All thefe emoluments put together will make 
about L. 20. 

Antiquities. — There are not many monuments of antiquity 
in this parifh. The moft ftriking are two earthen mounts j 
one of them clofe by the church- yard, and the other about 
200 yards weft from it. They are evidently artificial, the 
outfide being fod, or turf, incloling fand or light earth. 
They appear to have been exactly circular, contrafted a lit- 
tle as they afcend, and quite level on the top. The circum- 
ference at the bottom is 150 feet, at the top 120, and the 
height is 42. The tradition concerning them is, that they 
Were places for adminiftering juftice ; fo their name Imports, 
for they are called torn mho it ^ i. e. the court hill. 

There are in diiferent parts of this parifh circles of large 
-flat ftones, ftanding on one end on the ground, fupported 
between two other large ftones buried under ground, fo that 
where there is a fingle circle above, there is a double one 
under ground. They arc faid to be Druidical temples.

<p>Name^ Extent, and Situation. 

FROM the name of this parifh, which, m its literal at- 
ccptation, fignifies f « t/:e Head of the Fir-iuood," it 
ieenis evident that a large traft of the lands adjacent to the 
church had been formerly covered with fir trees ; though at 
prefent there is not a fingle tree of this kind witlvin Ibme 
miles of it ; and the country in general, owing to a fcarcitf 
of planted wood, has, to the eye of a traveller, a bleak and 
naked appearance. 

The extent of the parlfli from eafl to wefi-, is nearly 17^ 
miles, and from north to fouth upwards of 20 ; but of this 
only the low part and the glens along the rivers are well in- 
habited, the reft being in general a range of hills appropri- 
ated to paflurage, where but a few hamlets are thinly fcatter- 
ed, for the accouimodation of thofe who attend their cattle 
during the fammer months. It is bounded by the parifli of 
Laggan to the weft, the united pari flies of Moy and Dala- 

rofiic to the north, Alvie to the caft, and Blair in Athol to 
the fouih.

It is fituated in Badenoch, a diftrift in the flilre of Inver- 
nefs J and is perhaps more elevated above the level of the 
fea, and farther removed in every dir.e3:ion from the coaft, 
than any other parifli in Scotland. 

Climate and Difeafes — As a confequence of the elevation of 
the parifh, the cUmate is naturally cold i and though from 
this circumftance it might be regarded as healthy, yet there 
are other caufes, arifing from the local fituation, that render 
fomc difeafes exceedingly common j the low n:;eadow grounds 
have fo little declivity, that every flood in the Spey over- 
flows them, and the ftagnation of the water not only renders 
the land (wampy, but produces noxious vapours. Hence 
rheumatifms, confumptions, and other complaints of a limi- 
iar kind, are very frequent. 

Rivers and Lakes^ — The river Spey interfe^ls the parifh, 
running from weft to eaft. It winds in a number of beauti- 
ful curves, through a rich fertile meadow, interfperled with 
allar and willow trees ; and the rifing grounds to the fouth be- 
ing moftly covered with natural birch and hazle , the rocks 
appearing fhaggy and abrupt to the north and weft, with the 
mountains in every direction, feen towering in diftant prof^ 
peft j the whole, viewed in the calm of a fummer's evening, 
forms a fcene truly romantic and pi&amp;urefque. The other 
rivers within the parifh are the Truim and Calder, the Tro- 
mie, Gynag, and Pefliie. All thefe rivers abound with 
trout ; and fome of them with pike, falmon, and charr. 
There is a large lake called Loch Inchy about a mile fquare, 
and fituated at the eaftern extremity of the parilli. It con- 
tains plenty of all the kinds of fiflies mentioned above. Of 
late an attempt was made to drain it, which, had it fucceed- 
cd, would have been a great advantage to the county ; but, 

after 



56 



Statiftical Account 



after expending feveral hundred pounds, little has been ef- 
fefted, as the natural declivity of the ground is not fufficient 
for the purpofe. 

SoiL—Jn the lower ground, the upper ftratum of the foi; 
is a mixture of fand and Hime, left by the overflowings of 
(he river ; a light loam conftitutes the fecond ; and clay 
the third. The high land, in general, is a light loam with a 
mixture of fand. This, indeed, is not a diftria adapted for 
Taifing grain. Storms are frequent at all feafons frofts are 
uncommonly intenfe i and as they continue late in fpring, 
?nd begin early in autumn, with heavy falls of rain during 
the harveft mouths, crops are always rendered uncertain. 

Agriculture and Natural Hijlory. — Grazing feems to be the 
only kind of farming proper for this place ; and for this the 
tills in general are very fuitable, particularly for fheep paf- 
turage. The hills which have nothing Angular to attradt at- 
tention, and are fo numerous that they would form merely a 
tedious mufter-roll of names, anfwer likewife another purpofe. 
They abound with game, and are much frequented by fportf- 
incn. Grous and tarmagan are in great plenty. In fomq 
parts black-cock and wood-cock are alfo to be found ; 
though thefe are more rare. In the mofl; remote and un- 
frequented places, there are a number of flags and roe-deer. 
"Wild duck arc uncommonly numerous ; and in the lake al- 
ready defcribed, from 70 to ^oo fwans refide during winter. 

The natural hiftory of the parifli contains nothing fo An- 
gular as to merit a particular defcription. A mine was open^ 
ed feveral years ago, where fome fpecimens of very rich 
:^lver ore were dug up j but the work wa^ foon difconti- 

nuedf 



of Kingufte and Inch. ly 

^ued ; and no attempt has been fince made to difcover whcf 
ther it was worth working or not. 

■ Sheep farming has not as yet made any confiderable pro- 
grefs in the parifli, notwithftanding the many fuccefsful ex- 
amples in the neighbourhood to recommend it. The whole 
number perhaps does not exceed 7000. Black cattle is the 
primary objea. On thefe the tenantry principally depend 
for payment of their rent. Their other fales confift of 
flieep, wool, fome goats, and a few hill horfes. 

The parifli in general does not raife grain fufficient to 
fupply Itfelf. The kinds uluaily cultivated, are bear, oats, 
and rye. I have already ftated my opinion on corn-farming 
in this climate ; and yet, notwithftanding the difadvantages 
mentioned, were the exertions of the induftrious tenant pro- 
perly diredled, — were he inftrufted by thofe whole circum- 
ftances enable them to make ufeful experiments, — were he 
freed from vexatious fervitudes, that are the bane of im- 
provement, and taught to look forward with hope to the: 
period when he fhould enjoy the fruit of his labour fecured 
to him and his children, by a leafe for a length of years ; 
there is little doubt but the foil could be brought to main- 
tain double the number of its prefent inhabitants. The re- 
verfe of this picture is unfortunately too true, — The lands in 
many places are only held from year to year, or on very 
fnort . leafes. Graffums (fines) are frequently exacted ; addi- 
tional burdens are impofed without regarding whether they 
correfpond with the progrcfs of improvement ; and pcrfonal 
jfcrvices are fo often demanded, that the tenant, in many in- 
ftances, is more at the difpofal of his landlord, than the 
feudal vaflal was of his fuperior in former times. The ri- 
gour of, thefe exadions has of late been in foxne degree ale- 

yiatcd s 



, Statljlical Account 



vlated ; and it is to be hoped that, in an enlightened agc» 
the pradlice will be difcontinuad altogether. 

There is no village either in the parifh, or in the whole 
diftrifl. This inconvenience is leverely felt. Not only the 
luxuries, but even many of the common neceflaries of life, 
mufl: be fent for to the diftance of more than forty miles, 
Tradefmen have no fixed place of refidence where they can 
be reforted to. There is no centre for the little trafRc, or 
barter, requifite to be carried on in an inland country. The 
wool that could have been manufa£lured in the place, muft 
be fent by a long land carriage to buyers invited from ano- 
ther kingdonn. The flax that might have proved a fource of 
wealth to both proprietor and tackfman, has been negleiled, 
becaufe fkilful people are not coUefled in one clofe neigh- 
bourhood, to carry it through the whole procefs. 

Population^ Is'c — The number of inhabitants afcertained 
by a late furvey, amounts to 1803. Of thefe there are 
males above ten years of age 645, females 693, — children of 
both fexes under ten years of age 645, — total as above. It 
is to be regretted, that no data fufiiciently accurate to form 
any proper eftimate of the inhabitants in paft times, are to 
be found. If an opinion may be hazarded, where fadb only 
ought to be attended to, there is reafon to think that the 
number of inhabitants within the laft thirty years has de- 
creafed ; but not greatly. Dr Webfter's report makes this 
.pariih contain 1900 fouls. 

The baptifnis and marriages for eight years arc as follow. 
Ko table of burials has been kept.

The inhabitants confift of fix heritor's, three of whom aref 
refident ; feveral officers retired on half-pay, from the army 
and navy ^ and the remainder almoft wholly of hufbandmen: 
and cottagers j excepting faiiths and weavers, there are fevr 
mechanics of any kind.' This is owing partly to the caufe 
already ftated, there being no village in the place ; and part- 
ly to the genius of the people, which is more inclined to- 
martial enterprize, than to the painful induftry and labori- 
ous exertion requifite to carry on the arts of civil life. 
Till of late, it was even with reluctance that they would hire 
as day-labourers j and ftill the greater number of thofe em- 
ployed in this way, are brought from other countries. 

Prices of Labour atid of Proviftons. — A fhilKng per day is 
reckoned but very ordinary wages. Many receive 15 d. and 
16 d. and fome refufe ta work under i8d. The wages of 
women, however, is not in proportion ; during harveft, and 
when employed at peats, they receive 8 d, a day, and at e- 
very other feafon of the year only 6d. 

The price of provifions is in fome articles uncommonly 

bigh, 



Statijlical Accoant 



high, and in others fufficiently moderate. Oat-meal, on aii. 
average of years, fells at 20 s. the boll of 9 ftone. Oats for 
feed, at i6si i8s. and fometimes 20 s. Bear and rye fre- 
quently 2 IS. Beef and mutton cannot be valued by the 
pound, as there is no market for butcher- meat ; but both in 
general are dear. Ducks and hens are 6d.; chickens 2d.; 
eggs i|di per dozen; cheefe 5s. the ftone of 24 pounds 
when green ; butter 12s. the ftone when falted; milk 2d. a 
ScottiOi pint vphen warm ; potatoes 66; per peck j and fomc" 
times, when fold for feed in fpring, i s. 

From the foregoing circumftances, the poverty of the in- 
habitants may be inferred as an unavoidable confequence. 
An averfion to labour, combining with local difadvantagesj 
and feudal oppreffion, cannot fail to render a peafantry poor, 
difpirited, and comfortlefs. To fay the truth, the wretched 
appearance of numbers of them, is a fufficlent proof of the 
hardfhips they endure^ A few individuals, perhaps, in the 
rank alluded to, may be found who are eafy and affluent ; 
but, whoever is at pains to examine minutely the condition of 
the bulk of the people, — to view the mean ill conftruded 
huts in which they refide, — and to confider the fcanty and 
precarious crops oh which they depend in a great meafurc 
for fubfiftence ; will be far from thinking that the pidlure of 
their mifery is drawn in exaggerated colours. 

Manners. — Should a pcdple thus obnoxious to poverty 
and all its train vof concomitant evils, be found lefs fcrupu- 
lous in fome particulars, than others who enjoy a happier 
lot ; perhaps the liberal mind would find fome alleviation of 
their errors in the neceflity of their fituation. But even this 
excufe is unneceffary on the prefent occafion. Inftances of 
theft are very uncommon ; more flagrant crimes in a great 

mcafure 



ofKinguJjie and Inch* 4t 

meafure unknown. Like moft of the natives of the High- 
lands, they are brave, hofpitable, and polite. Their vices 
may be faid to be grafted on their virtues. They are quar- 
relfome, addicted to drunkennefs, and little to be depended 
on for the fincerity of their profeffions. 

Language. — The Gaelic language is moft frequently fpo- 
ken, though the Englilh is tolerably well underftood by 
many of them. They have preferved but few traditions of 
their civil hlftory ; and thefe are fcarcely worth the trouble 
of recording. 

Church. — Their ecclcfiaftical hiftory, till a confiderable 
time after the Refornlation, is little known. Though it is 
well afcertained, that there was once a monaftery in the 
parifli, and a priory with very liberal endowments j yet there 
is fo little known concerning them, that our antiquaries have 
barely mentioned them in the catalogue of religious houfeSj 
without attempting any further illuftration. There have 
been only five clergymen in fucceffion, fince it was eredled 
into a parifh ; the laft incumbent officiated 57 years ; the 
prefent minifter has been fettled 9 years ; he has been fix 
years married, and has no children; The fiipend is L. 704 
the value of the glebe about L. 12. There are neither manfe 
nor office houfes ; the heritors allow the fum of fifteen 
pounds yearly in place of them. The valued rent of the 
parifh is 3000 pounds Scots. There are no Papifts nor Dif- 
fenters of any kind in the parifh. Moderation in religious 
opinions charafterizes the people in general. 

SchooL—ThtTQ is only one parochial fchool, with a Hilary 
of L. 1 1 : 6 : 8 Sterling. The other emoluments of the 
mafter are L. 2 for being feffion- clerk, with a trifling allov/-

ance for regiftering baptifms and marriages ; and the ufual 
fees paid by the fcholars. The number of thefe varies occa- 
fionally from 20 to 50. This is owing to the children of the 
tenantry being fent to attend the cattle in the hills, during 
the fummer months, and their returning again to fchool in 
the beginning of winter. They are naturally fond of learn- 
ing, Ihrewd, and of quick apprehenfion ; but parents are of- 
ten unable to afford the expence of giving their children 
even the common education to be obtained in the country; 
and the greater number of them, on this account, are fo il- 
literate, that they can neither read nor write. 

Poor. — There are no funds for fupporting the parifli-poor, 
except the weekly collections at the church. Thefe in ge- 
neral amount to very little, and can afford but a very partial 
relief to upwards of fifty neceilitous poor, whofe names are 
on the roll. In cafes of this kind, common begging is un^ 
avoidable. Where the law has made no particular provifion, 
the indigent mufl depend on the charity of the public at 
l?rge. 

Afitiqutties. — Among thefe may be reckoned a green hill, 
on which are the remains of a ruined barrack, which was 
built about the year 1725, and burnt in the year I745. 
This hill is thought to be an artificial mound of earth ; and 
the conjedure is fupported in part from a view of its fliape 
and fituation j but more particularly, from a circumflance 
mentioned by fome of the old inhabitants, that, when they 
were finking a well within the barrack, crofs pieces of wood 
were found at regular dirtances, from the furface to the 
bafe ; if really artificial, it muft have been a work ©f im- 
menfe labour and expence. 



This 



of Ktngiffie and Inch. 43 

This paridi likewife contains foa^e Druidical circles, and $ 
the appearance of a Roman encampment. This laft is fitu- 
ated on a moor, between the bridge of Spey and Pitmain ; 
and is faid by many who have examined it, to fliew feveral 
of the lines of a camp perfeftly diftincT: and entire. Appear- 
ances of this kind are often fo little to be depended on, that 
every opinion concerning them (hould be hazaVded with un- 
common diffidence. Collateral circumftances, however, ia 
this cafe, may add a degree of probabiHty to conjefture. Ia 
clearing fome ground adjacent, an urn was found full of 
burnt alhes, which was carefully preferved, and is ftill ex^*

cealed in a rock ; and is depofited in the fame hands with 
the urn. Thefe are ftrong prefuinptive proofs, that the Ro- 
mans had carried their arms far beyond Agricola's wall ; the 
Celtje never burned their dead ; nor was the tripod ever ufed 
in their libations. 

Mifcellaneons Retmrhs. — In concluding this fuperficial de- 
fcription, the writer has only farther to obferve, that he has 
endeavoured to give a faithful ftatement of particulars, as 
they appeared to him, without any bias or partiality. That 
the peafantry in this, as well as in dilFerent other diftri£ts of 
the Highlands, fuffer uncommon hardfhips, and are lefs 
comfortable than their fouthern neighbours, none who have 
attentively examined their condition, will venture to deny. 
But it is eafier to enumerate grievances, than to point out 
the means of redrefs. Were the proprietors to grant them 
their lands rent-free, if could not anlwer the purpofe at pre- 
I'ent. Improvements in Agriculture are ■ilow and progref- 
five ; an influx of wealth, and a liberal patronage, may en- 
courage individuals to make uncommon exertions for a time ;

<head>NUMBER IV. 
 PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5468112">FORDICE</name>. 

(County of Banff.) 
By the Rev. Mr James Lawtie.</head> 



<p>Name^ Situation, Extent, Soil, and Surface. 

THE antient and modern name of this parifli is Fordice, 
it is faid to be derived from the Gaelic, and to flgnify 
the bleak cottntry. And, indeed, the upper part of the parifli 
may ftill be entitled to the epithet of bleak ; but much more 
fo, before the woods were cut down, and the marfhes drain- 
ed. Fordice is fituated in Banfffliire, in the prelbytery of 
Eordice, and fynod of Aberdeen. 

This parifli fince Ordlquhill, Defkford, and CuUen, were 
detached from it after the Reformation, is nearly triangular. 
From the mouth of the river or burn of Boyn, on the eafl:, 
to the Knockhill, is five miles Scots. From the Knockhill 
to Logie the fame number of miles on the wefl:. From 
Logic to the mouth of the burn of Boyn, near Scots Mila 
and Old Houfe of Boyn, alongfl: the fide of the fea, five 
miles. On the eaft it is bounded by the parifli of Boyndie, 
on the fouth by Ordiquhill and Grange, on the wefl: by 
Delkford, Rathven, and CuUen, on the north by the fea, 
or Moray Frith, 



The 



Statijiical Account 



The general appearance of the country is rather flat, with 
many inequalities and rifing grounds. There are two fmall 
and contiguous hills, thofe of Fordice and J3urn, about a 
mile fouth from the fea, befides the Knockhiil at the fouth- 
weft extremity, much higher than the two preceding, and 
which feparates this parifli from part of Grange and Ordi- 
quhill. 

The coaft or fliore is high and rocky, with the exception 
of a few bays, fuch as thofe of Portfoy and Sandend. 

Many forts of fiflies are caught on the coaft, ling, cod, 
tulk, haddock ; befides dog, whiting, mackarel, holybut, 
turbot, cat, and flounder of various kinds. Lobliers, 
crabs, clams, limpits, and periwinkles. The principal 
market for the firft four kinds was Leith and the South 
Frith ; but now the fifhers fay they fuffer luch exactions at 
Leith, (a ftrange policy upon an article of provihons) that 
they feldom proceed to that market, and fell betwixt this 
and the South Frith. There are corallines on the coafts, 
and from famples taken up on the filhers lines or hooks, it 
is believed a few corals and fponges. There are large ihoals 
of herrings and confiderable numbers of feals, purpoifes, and 
fometimes whales, and fharks, feen on the coall. The lime- 
ftone on the coaft is frequently perforated by a fpecies of 
fmall muicle, which live and grow in the flones. The fiih 
of this kind called pholades in Italy, have three or four Ihells, 
oars, like common mufcles, only two. There might be 
large quantities of kelp made on the coaft. However, the 
great quantity of both tangle, and belly-weed, which grows 
on the fea rocks, when by ftorms loofened and difengaged 
from them, and caft alhore, are carefully gathered and ufed 

as 



of for dies. ilf 

as manure. Sometimes belly-weed is fhorn "or cut for that 
purpofe by the farmers. 

An intelligent boatmafter at Sandend, fays, that the courfe 
of the tides is from half tide to half tide, and that there are 
no extraordinary currents until they get above Cromarty ; 
and tl^e only dangerous rocks are the Skairs of Caufrey. 
The fifhers direft their courfe by the hills of Durn and 
Knockhill. There is no light-houfe ; but a beacon, it is 
faid, would be ufeful upon the above-mentioned Skairs. 
Eafter and Weller Heads of Portfoy, and Logie Head on 
the weft towards CuUen, and a few miles from Scarnofe, in 
the parifh of Rathven, are the moft remarkable head-lands. 
Redhyth betwixt Sandend and Portfoy, is a very ufeful and 
fafe creek in fome cafes, having a deep beech. A fliip from 
Onega, about twenty two years ago, by being run into the 
bay of Sandend, faved both her cargo and hands. 

The hills are covered with grafs, or heath, moflly the 
latter. There has been a very deep mofs on the top of the 
Knockhill ; but was never ufed, being inacceffible almoft by 
horfe carriages, and moftly burnt out in the dry year 1723, 
There is much marble (or rather jafper) at Portfoy, quarried 
in the ordinary manner, and manufadliured into chimney- 
pieces, funeral-monuments, tea cups, fun-dials, &amp;c. Upon 
the firft difcovery, much of it was exported to France, and 
it is faid, there are two chimney pieces of it in the palace of 
Verfailles, and that it became fafhionable in France ; but the 
fimily of Boyne overftocking the market, it went out of 
fafhion, and a fhip load of it lies neglen:ed on the banks of 
the Seine, as a gentleman who faw and knew the ftones 
informed me. This quarry runs fouthward from Portfoy 
into the hill of Durn, and then acrofs the country to the 

weft

Staii/ltcal Account 



weft end of the hill of Fordice, and from that fouth nearly 
to the Knockhill. The hill of Durn feems to be one mafs 
of marble, and a kind of quartz, a white filiceous ftone em- 
ployed in the manufadture of ftoneware. There are like- 
wife in the lower end of the parifh, through the eftates of 
Findlater, Birkenbog, Glaflaugh, and Durn, inexhauflible 
quarries of limeftone j large quantities of lime and lime- 
ftone are tranfported. There is a weighty clumfy fort of 
flate in the rocks of Findlater. Hopes have been entertain- 
ed of finding a coal mine near GlafTaugh or Sandend. A- 
longft with the limeftone there are mixtures and layers of a 
black fubflance, like flate of coal. Boring was tried at 
Glaflaugh, both by the late General Abercrombie, and his 
father, but no difcovery of coal was made. The rocks on 
the fea at the eaft fide of the parifh, near Craig of Boyn, 
have been faid to confift entirely of iron ftone. The foil in 
general is deep and fertile, but rather wet than dry, which 
renders the harveft late in a rainy harveft. No part of the 
parifti is fubjefl to inundations, except the haughs and flat 
grounds, near the rivulets, where mifchief is fometimes 
done, both to corns and houfes. In fummer 1772, fome 
houfes and a bridge were fwept away, both at Fordice and 
Glaflaugh. The fame happened in November 1781. 

Climate and Dijiempers. — The air is rather dry than moift, 
and in general healthy. The ravages of the fmall-pox are 
very much abated by the practice of inoculation. The moft 
prevalent diftemper is fever, and that for the moft part not 
univerfal, but confined to particular diftridls. It is fome- 
times thought to arife from infeftion and communication 
with other parts of the country ; at other times from local 
Ctuations, and circumftances of the people's houfes and ha- 
bits of living in particular diftrids. 

Population, 



of Fordice. 



49 



PopdaUott. — The population of this parlfli, fo far as it has 
bttn traced, was as great formerly as at prefent. This may 
cppear a little problematical, confidering the great number of 
people colleaed together and living in Portfoy ; but former- 
ly there were many moffes, now exhaufted, and the fides of 
thele mofles were crouded with cpttagers, who laboured a 
few acres of ground, had a little coarfe flax of their own 
growth, and kept a -fmall flock of ftieep, which afforded 
them clothes. Thefe people multiplied and afforded fol- 
diers, fervants, and tradefmen. The great check given ;to 
this rank of people was firft the mofles being exhaufted, and 
then fome heritors limited by their leafes the number of 
fubtenants, in order to fave their mofles. The return of the 
population of this parifh to Dr Webfter was 2,212. In the 
year 1782, the police of the county required an account of 
the number, young and old, in the parKh, in order to afcer- 
tain the quantity of meal neceflary to be imported. A tole- 
X2bly exaft numeration was made, and then young and old, 
amounted to about 3425. The population fince that period 
has rather incr^afed than diminiihed. 

The average of births according to the regifter of baptifms 
Ki 1683, — 4, — 5, is •104; in 1783, — 4,-r-5, 55. It is be- 
lieved, however, that there are as many, or nearly as many 
births and baptilms in the parifh now as formeily, and that 
tlie difference of thefe two averages arifes in a great mea- 
fure from the inaccuracy of the baptilm regifters, owing to 
the negligence of the people, in regiftering their children's 
Kames. During laft century, there was only one minifter, 
and the fchoolmafter was attentive to his own intereft, in ob- 
liging the people to regifter their children. There are now 
Icveral who baptize at Portlby, a minifter of the eftablifli- 
^lent, — a Seceder, — a Nonjuror who preaches every fort-

night, — and a Roman Catholic prieft, who frequently fays 
mafs there. The regiller of baptifms commences in 1663, 
and from the beginning, the average of baptifms continues 
much the fame as the firft mentioned average, to the end of 
the century, w^hen the feven years famine which then hapr 
pened, reduces the number in 1699, to 70. From that 
time the number rifes gradually in the regifter to I7I7» 
when a Nonjuror fettling at Portloy, and afterwards near it, 
the people became negligent in regiftering, and have gener, 
ally continued fo, to the great lofs of many, in proving their 
kindred with relations who had entered the feafaring line, 
or fettled abroad. 

There has only very lately been a rcgifler of burials ; and 
the average for 1784, — 5, — 6, is 47. But, as there is a bu- 
rial place at Portfoy, this average is not very accurate. 

There is no regifter of marriages before 1722, By the a- 
verage for 1 729, — 30, — : i, about 22 men fettled in this parifli 
married wives either within or without the parifli, — and eight 
women married from this parifli into other pariflies. Jn 
1^84, — 5, — 6, 24 men fettled in this parifli, married women 
of this or other parillies, ^nd three women were married 
from this into other pariflies. Without attending to this cir- 
cumftance, marriages might be ftated twice ; becaufe, when 
the nian andwoman belong to different parifhes.the publication 
of the banns and regiftration of the contradl take place in both. 

There are five fifliing boats, fix men to a boat, and a few- 
yawls befides, for the boys. This rank is ftill diminifliing by 
prefiing for the Navy fervlce, and young people going to the 
merchant fervice j likewife by accidents of fhipwreck.— 
There is one ftudent at the Univerfity, — A few belonging to

this parifh were born in England.— Great numbers are born 
to the weft of Spey. A great part of the fervants male and 
female come from other parifhes, in queft of more liberty, 
and better wages ; particularly from the more northerly parts 
of the ifland.— No nobility have refxded in this parilh fince 
the end of laft century, when the family of Findlater fold 
Durn. Refident families are Birkenbog, Glaflaugh, and 
Burn ; only Sir George Abercrombie of Birkenbog, has pul- 
led down the old family feat, and has not yet rebuilt it.— 
There are fix heritors. — There is a minifter of the eftablifli- 
ed church at Fordice, and a preacher at Portloy, prelented 
by the prefent Lord Findlater's grandfather with L.20 year- 
ly ; likewife a Relief one, occafionally a Nonjuror Epiicopa- 
lian minifter, and a Popilh prieft. — There is one notary, and 
one mefTenger. — One furgeon at Portloy, and one apothe- 
cary. — The great body of the people are Prefbyterians of the 
eftabhlhed church.— There are a few Seceders. — A confider- 
toble number of Epifcopalians. — ^A few Papifts. 

The population of the parilh is not very materially diffe- 
rent from what it was 25 years ago. The decreafe of fub- 
tenants by throwing many fmall tacks into one, is balanced 
by tenanting the grafs- rooms, and the increafe of people at 
Portfoy. The tenants alongft the coaft paid large vidtual 
rents ; and therefore, found it convenient to have grafs farms 
in the upper part of the pariQi, for fublifting their cattle in 
fummer. In thefe farms the folding grounds were only 
fown. The introduflion of grafs-feeds, and partial conver- 
fior) of victual rent, have rendered this policy unneceffary j 
and it is difcontinued. 

None have died for want fince the 1 700. — None have left 
the parifh for want of employment, except a few day-labourers, 

who

who removed to the contiguous parifh of GuUen, for moff 
conftant employment in Lord Findlater's works ; and a con- 
fiderable number of lint-dreffers difperfed into ditFerenfi 
parts upon the failure of the thread manufactory at Portfoy, 
a few years ago. 

Cultivation and Produce^ Horfe ploughing has itt 

fome farms fuperfeded the ufe of oxen ; flieep have greatly 
lecreafed by winter herding, and the wearing out of the 
commons by tillage and much feal. A great deal of oats 
and barky, and alfo a confiderable quantity of wheat, ars 
raifed in this parifh, efpeeially Cnce the erefti: n of flour- 
mills. Almofl: every farmer has fields ef turnip and pota- 
toes ; the laft are fometimes fold for exportation. The cul- 
ture of field cabbage and cokworts is likewife coming into 
pradtice. The parifh does furely more than fupply itfelf 
with provifions, though there is, no doubtj a confiderable 
importation of meal and flelh at Portfoy, from other pa- 
riflies; yet that muft be more than balanced by exportation. 
Almofl all the farmers raife flax for their own ufe, and feme of 
them for fale ; while others let their lands for a crop to the 
flax-raifers at Portfoy. The fowing of grafs-feeds has be- 
come very general. The rage of ploughing and raifing com 
had long ago deftroyed the natural beft paftures of the pa;- 
rifh, except a few on the fides of burns and rifing grounds, 
which could not be fafely touched by the plough. Thers 
are, however, flill remaining in fome parts of the parifh, 
what they call outfields, which may be called pafture, as 
they do not undergo the culture of the plough, except for 
two or three crops in a dozen or twenty years. The ufe 
of lime has much diminiflied the quantity of out-field. 
Wheat is generally fown in the end of harveft:, peafe, 
beans, oats, and barley, are fown from the beginning of 

March 



of Fdrdice. 5 J 

March to tne end of May, according to feafons and fitua- 
tions. Harvefl: begins in Aiiguft, and in early years termi- 
nates in Septemlxr or beginning of Oftober. Common or 
wafte ground is every year diminifliing, being convsrted into 
tillage by the contiguous tenants, or planted by the heritors. 
There is one natural wood of alder, and feveral plantations of 
lir, aOi, elm, and other trees ; but fewer than might be ex-, 
pefted from the refidence and opulence of the heritors. The 
land-rent of the pariih may amount to nearly L. 4000 year- 
ly. The valuation of this parifli is between the 8th and 9th 
part of that of the whole county. The rent of fifliing boats 
about Lrf4 yearly each ; but from this is to be deduced the 
price of a boat furxiifhed once in feven years by the heritors^ 
About 20 s. is the rent of the befl: lands. From los. to 12 s, 
for thofe of inferior value. The fmall allotments to the inhabit- 
ants of villages go higher, perhaps above 40s- the acre^ 
The number of farms is diminifhing every year. From 80 
to 1 00 acres is the largefl:. However, a confidcrable number 
of fmall farms ftill remain, for furniftiing tradefmen and fer- 
vants to the country. Farms are beginning to be enclofed. 
There is a white peat (under the name of greafy clodsy 
which may be called a bitumen, and fome years ago was uni- 
verfally uled for giving light to fpinners in winter j and is 
ftill ufed by the pooreft people for that purpofe. 

Language. — No language is fpoken in this parifli, except 
the bcottilh or Anglo-Saxon. Ail the old farms feem to 
have their names from the Gaelic or Erfe. Glajfaughy Gray 
or Green-Haugh. Kilhillock, Burial-Hillock. Aird of Port- 
foy, Height of Portfoy. DurUy Round, from its contiguous 
round hill. Auckmore, Large Field. Hindrovght, Bridge- 
end, &amp;c. The old Mains of Findlater, which was very ex- 
tenfive, is now divided into many farms, which have all

Englifli names. Some farms in the upper part of the parlili^ 
tvhich were laid wafte, in the bad years, or famine, at the end 
of the lafl: century, have had new and fanciful names given 
them, fuch as York, Windfor, See. 

Stipend. — The ftipend (in which are 21 1 bolls meal, 
reckoned at los.per boll) amounts to L. 71 : 10. The glebe, 
according to the value of contiguous lands, L. 7 : 10. Grafs 
money L. 2. In whole L. 81. The glebe having been per- 
fedlly inclofed by the prefent incumbent, it may be worth 
fomething more to his fucccffor. There is likewife L. 5 of 
communion-element money ; but that has not been uniform- 
ly paid. The Earl of Findlater is Patron. 

Poor. — The number of poor receiving alms is 97. There 
are three different managements for the poor at Fordice, 
Portfoy, and Sandend. The produce of the colle£tions may 
be about L. 3 1 annually. Befides this, there is the inte- 
reft of L. 130 of fettled money, which has chiefly rifen 
from faving on the collections, with a few fmall benefa£tions 
from particular perfons. There is the rent of a loft in the 
church at Fordice, and of two mort-clothes. There are 
likewife penalties on delinquents ; and three of our heritors 
dying within the laft ten years, about L. 30 accrued to the 
poor, either by their own bequearhments, or that of their 
families. Some of the heritors likewife, give every year a 
quantity of meal to the poor of their refpeClive eftates. 

Price of Proviftons and Labour. — When the incumbent fet- 
tled here, 43 years ago, beef, mutton, pork, and lamb, fold 
from lid. to 2d. /ifr pound. Chickens at 2d. the pair ; 
hens from 5 d. to 6d. the pair. Butter from 5 s. to (5s. the 
ftone, Amfterdam weight ; cheefe at 2 s. 6 d. per flone. At

prefcnt beef fells from 2id. to 4^- the pound Amfterdam 
weight; mutton from 2d. to 4^- according to the feafon 
veal and lamb from 3 ^ d. to 6 d. ; pork from 2 i d. to 3 i d. ; 
pigs from 2 s. 6 d. to 6 s. Ducks 1 s. 6 d. the pair ; hens 
IS, 4cl. to IS. 6d. the pair; chickens fell at 2d. the piece; 
pigeons at 2d. the pair; turkies at 2 s. 6 d. and 3 s. each; 
geefe 2s. 6 d. each. Wheat at an average may be 17 s. 6 d. 
the boll ; fomething better than Linlithgow meafure. The 
heritors convert barley rent at 14 s. Oats may be reckoned 
from 8 s. to 12 s. the boll ; peafe and beans equal to one boll 
oat meal. Farmers men-fervants get from L. 2 : 10 to 
L. 6 :6 annually. Maid-fervants from L. 2 to L. 2 : 10 an- 
nually. Day-labourers from 8 d. to 1 s. per day, without 
^meat, with meat 6d. a day. Mofling and harveft-work is the 
deareft, and perhaps a little more than the above ; for a 
good harveft-man fometimes gets is. and vidluals, /xrr day. 
Thirty or forty years ago, nien-fervants got from L. i : i 3 : 6 
to L. 4 yearly; women- fervants from 16 s. to 20 s.; day- 
labourers from 5 d. to 6d. without meat, with meat, about 
4d. Mafter-mafons now receive about 2 s. per day ; mafter- 
carp'enters is. 4d. or is. 6 d. ; journeymen-mafbns from 
I s. 4d. to 1 s. 6d. ; journeymen- wrights from lod. to i s. ; 
taylors get 6 d. and victuals ; houfe fervant-maids from L.^ 
to L- 3 : 3 yearly ; men from L, 6 to L. 19 yearly. With 
the induftry of his wife, a day-labourer may bring up his family^ 
As foon as they are able to work, the children are fet to fpin- 
ning, or hired out to herd. When old, if their children be 
. not both dutiful and fuccefsful, they need help from the 
poor's-funds. Their food is meal of oats, barley, peafe, 
and beans, with potatoes, milk, greens, and fome fifti, which 
fome years ago, when cheap, was a great help to their liv- 
ing ; but of late are rifing above their purchafe. They fel- 
doin can afford any flefli meat now, except at Chriftmas ;

tut formerly could afford a linle through the winter. They 
gre genernlly affct^lionate to their children, and part witk 
Jiiore to thenn, than a prudent concern for old age permits. 

Antiquities, —Thtvt is a triple fofle and rampart on the 
Cdes and top of the hill of Durn, which feem to have quite 
furrounded it. The higheft, which includes the large plain 
?n the top of the hill, feems to have been ftrong with a Hone 
rampart or wall, efpecially at the entry or mod acceffible 
part, where it joins the hill of Fordice. It commands an 
extenfive view of the adjacent country ; and probably was 
ufed as a retreat for the people, their families, and cattle, on 
i.nvalxons of the Danes from ths fea, or of the wild High- 
landers. Hard by it, on the fuJe of the hill of Fordice, 
there is a farm called Badhwitoul. According to Mr Pennant, 
in his Hebrides, Badhun fignifies a place of refuge, and fome 
foy Totil llgnifies a burn, others a hollow; in either way it feems 
to juPlify the fuppofition, with refpedl to the intrenchments on 
the hill of Durn, Of predatory invafions from the High- 
landers, there ftill remain fome traditions in the parifli. 
There is a tribe of Qregors amongft the country people, faid 
to be the defcendants of boys taken in a purfuit of the 
thieves. Kirktown and the Caflle of Dtflcford in the old 
bounds of this parifli, are fuppofed to have been a Roman 
ftation. Flint .arrow-heads of our anceftors, called by the 
country people elf arrow heads, have been found in this pa- 
rifli. There are the remains of fome Druidical temples, 
likewife hurrows or tumuli. Three of the laft have been 
opened within thtfe few years. One very large between 
Glaffaugh and the fea, immediately above the bay of Sand- 
end. It confided of a large circular accumulation of ftones, 
fourteen feet high, and fixty feet broad, and then covered. 

Fith earth or turf. Upon breaking in ?it the top^ there were 

found 



Bf Fordice. 

Toirad a ftone coffin of flag or flat ftones, and in it the 
bones of a chieftain lying in their natural order ; and a 
deer's horn, a fymbol of the chief's being a hunter. The 
flones, of which fort there were few in the neigh- 
bourhood, by the fliells of the pholades, or mufcles in- 
cluded in many of them, feem principally to have been 
brought from the fea. The quantity, diftance, and dif- 
ficulty of accefs, feem to have required an army, or 
•large diftridl of country to tranfport them. This burrow is 
now the fite of a wind-mill. There had been another com- 
paratively very fmall burrow, at about a hundred paces dif^ 
tance from the largeft. It had been conftruEled by cafting 
up a trench round it, which ftill remains ; but the earth of 
the tumulus has been long ago carried ofi-'. Another bur- 
row was likewife broken up at Kilhillock in Findlater fome 
years ago. It was entirely a cairn of ftones ; and in remov- 
ing them for the purpofe of indofing, an urn was found, and 
likewife a ftone coffin covering a flceleton. The tenant was 
greatly furprifed, and, that he might not fuffijr for violating 
burial ground, he carefully interred the bones, and the pieces 
of the urn, at a marked place in the inclofure. Another tu- 
mulus was likewife broken up in the contiguous farm of 
Brankamentum, through the curiofity of Mr Duncan of 
Broom, where there was found an urn containing Tiflies ; it 
was very hard, and the clay well baked. In the loth cen- 
tury, the Danes landed at the mouth of the burn of CuUcn ; 
King Indulfus came up, beat them, and obliged them to re- 
embark ; but was flain at the end of the engagement, in a 
■corner of a wood, where he fell in with an unbroken party 
of the Danes. It is a matter of uncertainty whether the 
battle was fought in this parifli, or in that of Rathven on the 
weft of Cullen, where remains the King's Cairn, in the

Emfnetit Men. — It is probable that Archbifhop Sharp was 
a native o'f this parifh. His father was proprietor of Ordin- 
hoves, the family eftate in this pariQi, and afterwards re-^- 
moved to Banff, where, as is generally fuppofed from that 
circumftance merely, the Archbilhop was born. The father 
managed the bufinefs of the family of Findlater, and the in- 
cumbent has heard the late Earl of Findlater's father fay, 
that the beft written papers in their charter cheft, were done 
by him. The late General Abercrombie of Glaffaugh, was 
3 native of this pariQi, and educated in it. Mr George 
Smith another native of this place, after ferving as clerk in 
Holland, Paris, and Aleppo, found his way over land to 
the Eaft Indies, was not heard of by his friends for feve- 
ral years, and died February laft, on his way to Britain, 
He had become matter of a very confiderable fortune 5 
and, if any of his five fifters, or their progei)y, fail to claim 
in five years, their fliares come under the adminiftration 
of the magiftrates of Banff. — L. 1000 to be employed for 
an hofpital or infirmary at Banff' or Fordice, — L. 25 year- 
ly in augmentation of the minifter of Fordice's ftipend, 
— L. 40 yearly, to endow a fchoolmafter at Fordice, to 
teach the French and Dutch languages, with arithmetic, 
mathematics, and book-keeping,— and L. 25 yearly, to each 
of his burfars at this fchool. Walter Ogilvie of Red- 
hyth, a native of this parifh, laft century, endowed twelve 
burfars at the fchool of Fordice, and eight at King's Col- 
lege Aberdeen. The prefentation was in the^ift of Ogilvie 
pf Boyn, but fold by the late Inchmartin to the family of 

Findlater,

of the burfars, the 4th year of their attendance, and, if they 
be found not qualified for a literary education, or not inclin- 
ed to follow it, they get the 5th year to prepare them fo far 
for fome trade. 

General Chara8er of the People, life. — There is nothing in the 
heighth of the people which may diftinguifli them from their 
neighbours in the country. Their fize cannot be called 
dwarfifli, but lower, probably, than it would otherwife be, 
owing to the boys being early put to hard work, and the 
girls confined to fpinning. Very few of the people reach the 
height of fix feet. Here it may not be improper to obferve, 
that Sir John Gordon of Park, about a century ago, intro- 
duced a breed of tall men into his eflate in Ordiquhill pa- 
rifh, coUedled from different parts of Scotland ; but that 
their defcendants of the third generation have generally 
come down to the fize of the country. More lately, when 
the King of Pruflia was collecting his tall men, the incum- 
bent has not heard that he obtained any from this corner % 
but he got fome from the contiguous parilh of Rathven. 

The people are in general difpofed to indufiry. Since the 
failure of thread-bleaching at Portfoy, there is no manufacture 
of confcqence carried on within the parifli. But mofl: of the 
inhabitants rai!e as much flax, and weave as much lineji 
cloth, as ferve their families. Perhaps not 1000 yards of 
the cloth manufactured in it, are fold out of the parifli at 
prefent. The manufacture of linen feems to have cxifted in 
this pcirifii 309 years ago, for amongfb other privileges 
granted to the weekly market at Ford ice, by charter from 
the Crown, that of felling Linteum latum et arBimy is givcu 
in i^po. The people are rather inclined to the fea than the

land fervlce. However, many do not enter voluntarily, but hj 
draughts made from the fifting boats, and preffing from the 
merchant fervlce. The people are in general economical 
and frugal; but luxury in drefs and living are creeping in. 
Only one cftate in this parifh has been fold for many years, 
that of Durn, which fetched, it is believed, about 30 
years purchafe ; but much more had been offered fx)r it a 
few years before. A part of Sir William Gordon of Park's 
unentailed eftate in this parifli^ fold not long after 1746, for 
40 years purchafe. The better fort of -people are much dif- 
pofed to give charitable affiftance to the fliipwrecked : but 
perhaps the olo feudal favage cuftom of diftreffing the ftiip- 
wrecked, and embezzling their property, would appear, if 
not reftrained by law, and by the humanity of the better 
fort. The people enjoy the comforts and advantages of fo- 
ciety in a tolerable degree, and feem contented. Their ftate 
might be ftill bettered by long leafes, commutation of 
viftual rent, abolition of fervices, &amp;c. and all tliefe things 
are coming in apace. There is one woman in prifon for 
theft . 



School. — The number of fcholars at the parochial fchool, 
is, at an average, between 50 and 60. The mafter's e- 
moluments from the kirk-feffion, keeping the regifters, fa- 
lary from the parifli, and thirteen burfars, amount to L. 26. 
Befides tliis, he h^s fchool-fees from his other fcholars^ 
from I s. to 2 s. 6d. quarterly, according to what they art 
taught. Something likewife is made by teaching book 
keeping. 

There is a fchool by fubfcription at Poftfoy, the fixed fa- 
lary of the fchoolmafter is L. 15 ; and, as he is allowed to 
take in fome more fcholars than thofe fubfcribed for, about ' 



• of Fofdice. 6t 

L. 5 more is made of it. The number of fcholars amounts 
to 30. 

There is likewife a charity fchoolHiafter at Portfoy, for 
teaching the poor. His fixed lalary from the Society 
for propagating Chriftian Knowledge is L. 8, — from the 
Countefs Dowager of Fmdlater L. 5, — and the value of L. z 
in land from Lord Findlater as a cow's grafs, — L. 2 as cl^erk 
and treafurer for the .poor's funds at Portfoy, in all L. 17. 
And about feven pound more may be made by teaching 
thofe who are able to pay for reading, writing, arithmetic, 
book-keeping, and navigation. 

There is another fchool for boys at Portfoy, where froni 
20 to 30 are taught ; and through the reft of the parifh there 
are four fchools for girls, where reading, fowing, and knit- n 
ting of ftockings are taught. 

Mifcellaneous Obfirvations.- — The remarkable meteor which 
travelled over fo great a fpace a few years ago, was feen here, 
as alio in the neighbourhood, about the fame hour. — 
Likewife the remarkable noife like cannon fhot, heard all 
over the north country in fummer 1 745, was heard in this 
parifh. 

The fuel generally ufed in the parifh is peat or turf; a 
good cart load of. the firft cofts is. 3d. of turf 8 d. Confi- 
derable quantities of Englilh and Scots coal are imported at 
Portfoy, and even bought by the tenants in the lower parts 
of the parilh, at a diftance from the moffes. Some of the 
•poorer villagers pull heath and cut furze.

ing to private perfons. There is a fifhing village at Sand- 
end. A fifhing and trading one at Portfoy, both on the fea 
fide. The Kirktown of Fordice, half a mile above Sandend, 
which was ereded into a borough of barony", by Elphingfton 
Bifhop of Aberdeen, in 1499, afterwards by another Bifliop 
of Aberdeen feued out to Ogilvie of Durn, is now the pro- 
perty of Lord Findlater. There is a fmall village at New- 
mills of Boyne, about two millb from the fea.

The bridges are few, and not all in repair ; they are moft- 
ly conftructed and kept up by county aireffments. The great 
road between CuUen and Banff is in excellent order, but the 
other roads are greatly negleifed fince General Abercrom- 
bie's death. The ftatute labour is generally exacted ; but by 
the latenefs of the harveft, the exaclion of the three lafl: days 
being fometimes hindered, thele days are frequently commu- 
ted for a day extraordinary in fummer. 

In the years 1782, — 83, the parifli fell fliort of its ordi- 
nary produce of corn and potatoes, and, without importation, 
could fcarcely have fupplied itfelf with feed and provifions. 
The heritors fold their farms in the country, and en- 
couraged importation j Government gave fupplies, and the 
kirk-feffion encroached upon their funds. The incumbent 
had the curiofity to read over the fefhon's records, for the 
laft ten years of the laft century, in which period hap- 
pened the great famine of feven years, called the 111 Tears. 
An antient elder of this parifh faid, that if the fame pre- 
cautions had been taken at that time, which he had 
feen taken more lately in times of fcarcityj the fiimine 
would not have done fo much hurt, nor would fo 
many have perifhed. From the records, it did not ap- 
pear, that any public meafures were purfued for the fupply

of the poor, nor any thing uncommon done by the feffion, 
except towards the end. The common diftribution of the 
colleftions of the church, amounted only to about j s. 2d, 
or IS. 4 d. weekly. The thing moft remarkable was, that 
for feveral years before the famine, adultery and fornication 
had been extremely frequent, to which the famine put 
an entire and fpeedy ftop. — Neither do thefe crimes feem to 
have abounded fo much in the parifli, fince that time. Soon 
after the Reformation, Popery in its outward form feems to 
have left the parlfh entirely, but the fuperftition as to wells, 
fpells, charms, remained much longer ; and above all, a diP. 
regard to the decent religious oblervation of Sunday. The 
eaft and weft fide of the parifli continued their competition 
at the foot-ball after divine worfhip, and a public niarkec 
was held in the church-yard. Bifhop Elphingfton, when he 
got his village of Fordice erected into a borough of barony 
in 1499, and obtained the privilege of a' weekly market day, 
thought it decent to leave out Sabbathiy and perhaps thought 
of abolifliing the practice, which probably exifted before his 
time. But in the renewal of the charter in 1592, to Menzies 
of Durn, whofe predecelTor had feiied it from the Bifliop of 
Aberdeen, die Sabbathi' is exprefsly inferted. This praftice 
was only got gradually fupprefTed in the beginning of this 
century or end of the laft. So ne people, whom the incum- 
bent has feen, remembered the fale of oxen-yokes, fnuff, &amp;c. 
upon the Sunday. The laft parcel of fnuff brought into the 
church-yard for fale on Sunday, was tofled out of the bag 
by Mr Gellie the miniftcr, who paid the value. The annual 
market called Hallow-fair, by Mr Menzies's charter, was to 
be held ad Fejlum Omnium SariLlorutn ad All Hallomes per 
Jpntium oclo dierum. ■ By Bifliop Elphingfton's charter, in

whom the incumbent has converfed, can give him any ac- 
count ; though it is plain he was once a faint of their 
church, and had a feftival dedicated to him. He feems to 
have been the patron faint of the parifh, and a well is hill 
called by his name. 

There arc in this parifli thirteen ale-houfes and three inns. 
The number of ale-houfes is greatly diminiflied, whereby the 
morals of the people with refpeft to fobriety and decency 
ssrc greatly mended. The ale-houfes in this village, now re- 
duced to one, were very numerous, and the Sunday's drink- 
ing very great, origin?ting from the Sunday's market ; in fo 
much that the minifter was obliged to compound the matter, 
' to allow a certain time after public worfliip, and then to caufe 
ring what was called the Drunken Bell ; after which he vilit- 
ed the ale-houfes, and difmifled any who remained in them. 
This practice, however, ceafed before the incumbent's time, 
or that of his predecefTor, though both have been obliged 
to make a ftep through the village, after dinner, and break 
up drinking companies. 

More cottages have fallen in the laft ten years than have 
been rebuilt ; but on the whole, the number fallen in and 
not rebuilt, is abundantly compenfated by new feus taken, 
2nd new houfes built at Portfoy. 

The employing cottagers in agriculture is much difconti- 
rued in this parifli. The farmers think themfelves better 
ferved by hired fervants who lodge with them, and have no 
interruption by the neighbourhood of their families. Forty 
years ago, moft large farms had their cottar-man, i. e. a 
cottager living near them, who held the plough, bound tlie 
.corn in barveA, an3 built the ricks. This feemingly ufeful

difficulty is not great, of finding a good ploughman to hire 
at any term ; however, feme of the farmers wifh for cotta- 
gers on their farms, whom they can employ incidentally, or, 
what would be ftill more ufeful, to have villages fcattered 
up and down the country, where day-labourers could be 
hired.

<head>NUMBER V. 
    PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6906978">MONYMUSK</name>. 

{County of Aberdeen.) 
By the Rev. Mr Alexander Duff. .</head> 



<p>Name. 

MONYMUSK appears to be a compound of two Gaelic 
words, momugh high or hilly, and niouficky which 
fignifies low and marlhy ground ; the nature and fituation of 
the country renders this conjecture more than probable, as 
the parifli confifts, partly of farms lying along the fides of 
hills, which bound it on the weft and north, and of low 
lands or haughs, which occupy a large fpace on both fides of 
the river Don, 

Situation and Extent.— -This parifh, which lies in the coun- 
ty and fynod of Aberdeen, and in the prefbytery of Ga- 
rioch, is feven miles long, and from four to five broad, its 
figure is very irregular. It is bounded on the eaft and fouth 
by the parifhes of Kemnay and Cluny, ori the weft: by the pa- 
rifti of Tough, and. on the north- weft and north by the pa- 
rifhes of Keig, Oyne, and Chapel-Garioch. It is eighteen 
miles diftant from Aberdeen, the neareft Tea- port ; the com- 
munication to which is eafy, by two roads, both of which 
are well made and kept in good repair. 

SoiL

5^//.— The foil Is in general good, and is diilinguifhed into 
infield and outfield, the proportion of which Is as two of the 
latter to one of the former ; excepting in tl.e farms which 
lie on the banks of the river, which almort all confif^ of 
infield and well cultivated lands. The mould is generally of 
a blackifh colour, rather light, having little or no mixture 
of clay in it. The haugh grounds have a fmall mixture of 
fand, which gives them a lighter colour^than the foil more 
diftant from the river. There is a large quantity of rich 
clay in mo ft of the lands that go by the name of outfield 
ground, and fuch of them as have been limed, and properly 
cultivated, become as rich as the beft infield ground in the 
parifh. • 

Air. — There is nothing very particular in the air of this 
parifh, to diftinguifli it in that refpedl from the circumjacent 
country. A tranlient obferver might perhaps pronoimce the 
fituation rather unfavourable to health. A large proportion of 
the lands lying low, and on the banks of the river, are of 
courfe vifited with frequent fogs; and the extenfive plantations 
which cover a confiderable part of the grounds, and nearly 
furround the whole parifli, might befuppofed to prevent the 
free current of the winds, and detain the ftagnated air fo 
long as to afFcdt the health of the people ; but thefe feeming 
difadvantages are more than counterbalanced, by the country 
being open on the eafl and fouth weft, which affords n free 
■circulation of air ; and the frequent weff, and north-weft 
winds following the courfe of the river, which, in the upper 
.part of the parifli, runs along a deep glen bounded by high 
hills, fweep away whatever noxious vapours might have 
rbcen collefting for a few days in the flat parts of the coun- 
try. The air in fadl: is efteemed good, and many perfons in 
iconfumptive diforders take their refidence here, for the be- 
nefit

nefit of it. A great extent of the high and crofs roads 
through the parifh, is fkirted on both fides with belts of 
planting, which render them pleafant in fummer, and warm 
in winter. 

Dijiempers. — It cannot be faid that this part of the coun- 
try is liable to diftempers peculiar to itfelf. The rheuma- 
tifni is the mod frequent. The people are in general healthy 
?ind laborious. 

Minerals. — There are feveral mineral fprings in the pa- 
rifh, none of them at prefent of note. Many years ago an 
iron mine was difcovered in a hill, about a mile diftant from 
the church to the north weft ; the iron flone has been tried 
pnd found to be fo rich, as to yield thirteen twentieths of 
iron, and fo near the furface of the ground, that it can be 
taken out at a comparatively fmall expence. The road to it 
is at prefent paffable, and with little trouble can be made 
cafy, as the carts from the neighbouring farms draw the 
fuel from the dyke which inclofes the hill, at a hundred 
yards diftance from the opening which has already been 
paade into the mine. The reafon of its not being wrought, 
. \s the fcarcity of fuel in this part of the country. 

River. — The river Don runs through this parifli, and di- 
vides it into two unequal parts, leaving two thirds on the 
fouth, and one-third on the north of fts banks. It is not 
navigable, nor could it be made fo, it being very rapid in many 
parts, and having a fall within two miles of its mouth, which is 
thought to be an infuperable bar to any attempt of that na- 
ture. It contains a great riumber of falmon, fome pike, and 
yery fine trouts ; but though the proprietor here poflefles lands 
g?^tending from five to fcyen miles along both fides of the 

river.

river, his profit from fifhings Is very trifling, owing to the 
number and conftrudtion of the cruives and dykes between 
this place and the fea. The falmon fifhing company who farm 
that part of the river which lies neareft the lea, have builc dykes 
for the fecurity of the cruives, which rife conliderably above 
the furface of the water, and prevent any fiih of Cze from 
forcing their way up the river, unlefs when it is extremely 
fwelled with rain, and the Saturday's flap is faid to be but lit- 
tle attended to. 

Hills. — ^Though a confiderable part of the parifh is bound- 
ed by hills, there are none of them very high ; fome of them 
are planted, and the plantations along their fides thrive 
well ; but, near the fummit, the ground is fhallow, with 
bare flat rocks, and does not yield mould fufEcient for 
nourifliing or fupporting trees of any large flze. The hills 
which are not planted, are partly green and partly heathy, 
and afford excellent pafture for flieep. Many young cattle 
alfo are found feeding among the flocks of flieep, on the 
green tops of the hills, and in a thriving ftate. 

Antiquities. — One figured ftone has been difcovered in the 
parifti ; there is little doubt but it had been originally placed 
in an upright pofture, and after it had fallen, it remained 
' in that ftate time immemorial, in a field near the river, a 
mile eaft of the houfe of Monymulk, until it was lately 
moved by Mr Grant, to the neareft part of the public road ; 
nnd, after being painted white, and the figures black, to render 
them vifible and more lively, it is now fixed in its old pof- 
ture, and prefents an object for exercifing the talents of the 
antiquary. The figure of a crofs about four feet high, with 
rude ornaments, is diftinft, and below the crofs is a double 
circle, ornamented like the crofs j the part of the ftone 

which 



yo Staitjfical Account 

which appears now above ground, is about feven feet high ; 
and the only conjecture about the ufe of it, is, that it had 
been fet up to mark the boundary of the priory lands, on 
that fide where it was found. 

Floods. — All the low grounds which ly along the banks of 
the river, muli in lome degree be liable to inundations or 
land floods, though it is furpriiing how little mifchief hap- 
pens from them, confidering how large a traft of land lies 
feemingly expofed to their de vacations. The greateft da- 
mage occafioned by events of this nature, was in the middle 
of September 1768, at a time when motl of the corns were 
cut, and in jhocks ; all the plains along the river fuffcred 
extremely, the corns were fwept almolt clean away, and 
, many farmers were ruined. 

Thunder Siorm. — But a calamity of a different nature, 
though equally fatal in its effects to the grain, and all the 
vegetables within its reach, was a thunder ftorm, which vi- 
fited a part of this country, the 30th of July laft, 1790. 
The morning on which it happened was calm and warm, the 
iky fercne, and the fun flione bright. About 10 o'clock 
A. M. the air was fuddenly overcaft, and an uncommonly 
loud peal of thunder, inftantly followed by hail of a prodi- 
gious fize, began to excite fome apprehenfions for the crop, 
at that time only filling. It continued to thunder from ten 
o'clock to four in the afternoon, with very fliort intervals, 
pouring down immenfe quantities of hail, and with fuch ir- 
refiftible voilence, that it levelled all the corn with the ground, 
{ind pierced and tore to pieces all the turnip, potatoes, &amp;c. 
It was fo far happy for this parifh, that two or three farms only, 
•in the eaft quarter of it, were expofed to its violence- The 
hail lay above a foot deep in many places, and notwithftanding 

the 



' of Monymufi* 

the feafon of the year, was not quite dlflblved in two 'days. 
The froft was fo intenfe the night following the ftorm, that 
the pools in feveral parts were covered with ice nearly an 
inch thick. The deftruftion of the grain, has been attri- 
buted by many people, to that circumftance. 

Birds The birds which are known in this parifh, are of 

the fame kinds with thofe which are common in the north 
of Scotland ; they refort in great numbers to this place, be- 
caufe the many woods and plantations here afford them bet- 
ter flielter, than they could find in countries naked and defti- 
tute of wood. 

S/:eep. — The number of ftieep is greatly dimlniihed of late. 
About 50 years ago, 4000 flieep could have been rec- 
koned upon the paftures of this pari'Ih j one third part of that 
number is not to be found at this time. The caufe of the 
decreafe is to be accounted for, from the great number of 
parks and plantationsi which have circumfcribed the paflure, 
by the large extent- of barren ground and old flieep walks 
which they occupy, and render it extremely troublefome for 
the farmer to keep flocks in their neighbourhood. There 
are feveral farms ftill, at a confiderable diftance from all 
planting and inclofures, where the contiguous hills afford 
excellent pafiure for fheep, as their fides and fummits are 
covered with grafs, and the heathy parts of them have a 
large proportion of grafs intermixed. 

Deer. — Of late years great numbers of deer and roes reforfc 
to this place, for the good pailure and fecure flielter, which 
the extenfive woods afford. They do not, as in times paft, 
only vifit the low country, when deep fnows and feverc 
winters deny them fubfiftence and flielter in the forefts of

Glenaven, and Glentannar, and then return to their refi- 
dence in thofe. bleak and defolate regions, when the feafoa 
permits. But they now take their rcfidence always here, 
and in a fhort time all the inclofures will be well flocked 
with thefe beautiful animals, without any trouble or expencc 
to the proprietor. 

Population — For thirty years back the ftate of the parifli, 
in regard to population, has undergone very little alteration.

Heritors. — The whole parifh is the property of one heri- 
tor, Sir Archibald Grant, grandfon of Sir Francis Grant, 
who was knighted by Qaeen Anne, and appointed one of 
the Senators of the College of Juftice, by the title of Lord 
Cullen. That gentleman fold the eftate of Cullen in 
Buchan, and purchafed the whole lands of Monymulk from 
the anceftors of the prefent Sir William Forbes of Pitfligo. 

Clergymen. — The parifh is the charge of one clergyman. 
There are no Seceders in it. The inhabitants are all of the

and two perfons who are Roman Catholics. 

Umigratmis .—^\itrz are no emigrations from this part of 
the country, except what may be occafioned by the cafual re- 
moval of tenants or fervants, who are replaced by a greater 
of lelter number as circumftances occur. 

ProduElions. — The produce is wheat, rye, oats, barley, and 
peafe \ the quantity of wheat is much lefs conliderable of 
late years, than in the time of the late Sir Archibald Grant; 
It is faid that a wheat crop exhaufts and impoveriihes the 
foil more than any other grain.

Improvements and Agriculture.— k^xcxAVaxty and, indeed, 
improvements of almoft every kind, were carried to a very 
advanced ftate by the late Sir Archibald Grant. As he 
could find no perfons in this country qualified to fuper- 
intend his improvements, he was careful to draw to this 
corner, by fuitable rewards, men of knowledge in farming, 
from fuch parts of the kingdom as had advanced fartheft 
in agriculture ; and by employing fuch, either as overfeers, or 
by giving them advantageous leafes with fuitable accommo- 
dations, a part of the eftate was brought into good order, its 
value increafed, and the country people convinced, by the 
ftriking example of advantage before their eyes, of the nccef- 
fity of draining, cleaning, fi:raightening, and green-croping 
their lands, to fave much labour, and enfure better returns. 
But, as long rooted prejudices cannot be univerfally eradi- 
cated, it was judged neceiTary to bind down the tenants in 
their leifes, to a proper method of managing their fields, 
to build annually a certain quantity of ftone dykes, to lay on 
a quantity of lime proportioned to the extent of their farms, 
to cultivate a luitable proportion of turnips, potatoes, arti- 
ficial graffes, Sec. This fcheme had the defired efFeft ; 
and the mode which m;my at firft were obliged reludtantly 
to adept, is become fo agreeable and profitable, that they 
■would renounce their leafes, rather than relinquifli a plan of 
managemeni, they now find to be fo produdlive.

Flax. — The people have been in the pra£lice, for Ibme 
years paft, of cultivating flax in fmall quantities. 

Grain fent out of the Pari/Jj — This parifli fends conCder- 
able quantities of oats, oat meal, and barley, to the Aber- 
deen market, but how much cannot be known ; the quanti- 
ty produced within the parifh is confiderably greater, than 
what is confumed bv the inhabitants. 

Time of Sowing and Reapirig. — Wheat is fown in the 1 
month of Oftober, peafe, oats, and rye as early in March as 
the weather will permit. The bear or barley is Ibwn in the 
mouth of IVTa)'-, and is generally reaped betwixt the middle 
of Augufl: and the loth of September. The oats, wheat, 
rye, &amp;c. are reaped in the courfe of the month of Sep- 
tember, or betwixt the beginning of September and the 
middle of October. There is generally a rich crop of hay 
produced from the fields which have been carefully prepared, 
and it is generally cut down in the beginning of July ; the fe- 
cond crop is v.'ell advanced about the end of Auguft, but it 
is icldom ufed otherwife than for pafture. 

Number of HorfeSy Cattle, and Sheep — A good many cattle 
and fheep are fattened upon turnip, &amp;c. for the Aber- 
deen market, and draw very good prices to the farmer. 
The number of horfes in the parifli, is - 182

JVood- — Befides the number of acres within the parifli, 
occupied by woods and plantations, mentioned above, there 
are two large inclofures, which have never been furveyed ; 
one of them called the Millftone-hillj is from eight to ten 

miles

miles in circumference ; the other, which is called the hill of 
Pitfichie, and likewife is inclofed and planted, meafures from 
live to fix miles in circumference, and both together will 
amount to feveral thoufand acres. The whole was begun 
and accomplifhed by the late Sir Archibald Grant, who had 
the pleafure of feeing the trees arrive at maturity, and of de- 
riving annually a confiderable revenue from the fale of woQd. 
The fir trees, in particular, have been obferved to thrive re- 
markably here, and although it was the year 1720, before 
a fingle fir was planted, fome of them had advanced fo 
rapidly, that befides a great number of trees, which had been 
iifpofed of for many years back, fufBcient work was found 
for a faw-mill, which was erected about twenty-four years 
ago, for cutting the largeft trees into planks, and fupplying 
the country around with wood of diSerent fizes for carpen- 
ter work. Paradife wood contains a great number of fine 
full grown oaks ; and, although the family of IVlonymulk pof- 
fefs that wood, and another oppofite to it, which is not in this 
parifli, where the oaks are fully as numerous, Sir Archibald 
Grant has not hitherto fold any of them. In the fame 
wood are fine birch trees", afli, alders, and hazel wood ; the 
Isfl; of which produces frequently great quantities of nuts,

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q18352557">ANSTRUTHER.WESTER</name>. 

{County of Fife.) 
By the Rev. Mr James Forrester.</head> 



<p>Name, bfc, 

ANSTRUTHER- WESTER is fituated on the fea- 
coaft, in the eaft part of the county and fynod of 
Fife, and prefbytery of St Andrews. The name is derived 
from its fituation, &amp;triither being a Celtic word which fig* 
nifies a place lying in a valley, as Anftruther does. 

Anftruther-Wefter became a borough of barony in 1554, 
and a royal borough in 1583. The magiftrates are three 
bailies, a treafurer, and any number of counfellors, from fix 
to eleven. 

Exienty Boundary, Soil, \5'c. — The parifli is of a very irre- 
gular form. There is no map of it ; but, from the beft infor- 
mation, it contains about 540 acres of arable land, and about 
feven or eight acres of common, on which the burgelTes 
have the privileges of pafturage and of cafting turf. It is 
bounded on the fouth by the fea, for about half a mile ; on 
the eaft by Eafter- Anftruther ; on the north by Carnbie and 
Kilrennie ; and on the weft by Pittenweem. Near the fea, 
the foil is either a black loam, or a light fand mixed with 

ftiellsj, 



75 



Stati/lical Account 



fliells, both of which, though fhallow, are very fertile. In 
the higher ground^ there is forne light foil, but the greateft 
part of it is a deep ftubborn clay, that neither agrees with a 
wet nor a dry fealbn, but yields couliderable crops in favour- 
able weather. About the town the ground is flat, but it 
rifes gently from the coaft. From the vicinity of the fea, 
and from the eafVerly fogs, which come from the German 
ocean, the air is moilt ; yet the pariih cannot be faid to be 
unhealthy. Agues, which from the above mentioned cir- 
cumftances might be fuppofed to be prevalent, are totally 
unknown ; and no epidemical difeafes, except the fmall-pox, 
have appeared within thefe laft twenty years. The praiSlice 
of inoculation is increaiing, and has been attended with 
fuccefs. 

Rivers y Fijheries, and Produce of the Coajl, ^c. — A fmall 
river divides the two Anftruthers, in which, it is faid, there 
%vas once a confiderable falmon fidiery, whence the arms of 
the town, bearing three falmon, is faid to be derived. Cod, 
ling, turbot, hollybut, fkate, haddocks, herrings, flounders, 
and lobfters, are caught here and fent to Cupar, Edinburgh, 
Stirling, and Glafgow. Lobfters are the only filli fent to 
London, for which, it is fuppofed, that above L. looo is an- 
nually brought into this and the neighbouring towns. Great 
quantities of fea weeds are thrown on fhore after fiorms, and 
are ufed as manure. Once in two years, the fea weeds, grow- 
ing on the rocks, are cut and burnt into kelp ; ten ton of 
which is thought a good produce for the two years. The 
firft mention of kelp in the records is in the year 1694, 
when an EngliHiman offered the town-council L. 4 for the 
privilege of cutting and burning it for one year, which one 
of the bailies protcfted againfl, as being prejudicial to the 
health of the inhabitants, and his own family; but at length 

they 



*f Anflruther-WeJieK 



n 



they accepted the offer, on condition that the kelp fliould 
be burnt at the weft end of the town, and only whefla the 
wind blew from the eaft. 

The harbour does not admit fhips of burden ; but a little 
to the vveftward is a creek, called VVefihaven, which, at no 
great expence, migiit be made an excellent harbour. Nature 
leems to have fitted it for that purpole, as boats can come 
into it almoft at low water. It is Angularly ufeful in the filh- 
ing feafon. 

Migratory Birds, bfc^ — The woodcock, fieldfare, and cur- 
liew, vilit the coaft regularly in the winter, and the Bohe- 
mian jay is fometimes feen in the neighbourhood; as are 
alfo wild geefe, when the higher grounds are covered with 
fnow. Thefwallow, cuckoo, water- Wagtail, and plover, malce 
their appearance in" fummer. The early arrival of the wood- 
cock and Bohemian jay, indicates the feverity of the winter 
on the continent, wWle the cuckoo's early vifit is a fure mark 
that fine weather may be foon expected. 

Agriculttire. — The rotation molt approved by the beft far- 
mers on the ftrong clay foil of the parifh, is, ift fallow, 2d 
wheat, 3d beans, 4th barley, Jth oats, with grafs, 6th hay ; 
on the light foil, ift turnips, potatoes, or flax, 2d wheat or 
barley, 3d oats or drilled-beans, 4th barley with ^clover, 5th 
hay ; part of the o\itfield is pafture for the young cattle. 
This plan is purfued with advantage. On a farm of 148 acres, 
of which about 50 are outfield. Ihe largeft farm in the pa- 
rifh is 148 acres, the fmalleft 70. Formerly every farmer in 
the parilh had cottagers befides his hired fervahts, and the 
prefent farmers have not more i'ervants than their pre'd^ecef^ 
fors ; hence the cottagers were fupernumeraries. The pa- 

rifh, 



So Staii/iUdl Account 

ri{h, befides fupporting itfelf, exports a confiderable quant], 
ty of wheat, barley, and beans; but the light and folt 
grounds being unfavourable for oats, a quantity of oatmeal 
is annually imported. Peafe and beans are fown in Febru- 
ary ; oats in March ; barley in May, and wheat in Oftober. 
The earlieft harveft begins in the firft week of Auguft, and 
the lateft in September. 

Cattle. — The breed of cattle has, of late, been much im- 
proved, by croffing with the Lancafliire, Holdernefs, and 
Dutch kinds j by houfing them in winter, and by feeding 
them on turnip. The farmers find, by experience, that there 
is not a more profitable application of turnips, than giving 
them liberally to young cattle ; and the fame which the Fife 
breed of cattle has acquired, is probably owing to this me- 
thod of rearing them. A young ox of 20 months old, lold 
lately for 7 guineas. It was much ftouter, and fitter for 
work, than a three year old one fed in the common way, 
with ftraw in the winter. 

Price of Labour and Provi/ions. — In 1764, the wages of a 
day-labourer were 6 d. in winter, and 7 d. in fummer. They 
are now 10 d. in winter, and is. in fummer. Men in 
fiarveft, pd. ^^rday, and their victuals, women 7 d. They 
are now more conftantly employed than at the former period. 
When they are frugal and induftrious, they live very com- 
fortably, and their children are well fed and educated. 
Thrice the quantity of butcher meat and wheat bread are 
ufed now, that were 20 years ago in this parifli. In 1695, 
the wages of a man fervant was L. 20 Scots ; a maid fervant, 
ftom L. 5 to L. 8 Scots, for the year. In the year 1768, 
.the wages of a man were from L. 4 to L. 5 Sterling per ati^ 
mtn't of a woman, from 32 s. to 40 s. /fr annum. The pre- 

fent 



of AnJlrmher-WeJler. 8i 

fcnt wages of men are from L. 6 to L. 7 Sterling per annum ; 
and of women, from L. 2 to L. 3 Sterling. 

Prices of Provifions. — Provifions have rifeti one third in the 
courfe of 20 years. Mutton, lamb, veal, and beef, are from 
3 d. to 4 d. ^£'r pound J a hen, is.; ducks, 8 d.; geefe, 3 s.; 
cg8^' 3 ^* ^ /^o^ien. The only kind of provilions that have 
not rifen are pork, which is 4d. per pound, and rabbits 6d. 
a-piece, owing to the common people having an averlion to 
pork and rabbits. 

Church. — The parifh church appears to be a very antient 
building, from the remains of a large choir, and the gothic 
ftrucfturc of the fteeple. It was new-roofed in the year 1761. 
The manfe was built in 1703, and repaired in 1761. Sir 
John Anftruther of Anftruther, Bart, is patron of the pariih. 
The prefent incumbent was ordained in 1768, is married, and 
has a fon and two daughters. The ftipend, valuing the vic- 
tual at 12 s. per boll, is about L. 90 per anmwiy exclufive of 
the manfe and glebe. 

School. — The fchoolmafter has a falary of L. 8:6:8 per 
annum. The heritors pay the rent of his dwelling houfe and 
fchool, and the feflion pays him 10 merks a year for teach- 
ing poor children. The dues are, for reading Englilh, 14 d. 
a quarter-, writing, is. 6d,; Latin, 2 s. 6d; and naviga- 
tion, L. I : I : o. As the fchoolmafter is elteemed tlie bell 
teacher of navigation on the coaft, his chief attention is di- 
reaed to that branch. All the young people in the pariili, 
without a fingle exception, are taught to read Englifli, and the 
principles of the Chriftian religion.

Rent. — The valued rent of the parifli is L. 1185 Scota. 
The rent of land has rifen greatly within thefe 20 years, viz, 
from 7 s. and 10 s. per acre, to 21 s. and 30 s. 

Poor. — Thecolledlions at the church,theintereftof the poor's 
funds, and the favings in years of plenty, make an annual in-

All the inhabitants are of the Eftabliflied Church, except 
one man and his wife, who attend the Relief Congregation 
at Pittenweem ; and they are all natives of Scotland, except 
one Englifli woman. 

The population is rather increafing at prefent, owing to 
the revival of the coal, and fait works at Pittenweem, and 
the confequent increafe of {hipping. 

Four new houfes have been built within thefe laft 20 years* 
One of them is uninhabited, owing to the high rent of L. 10 
which is demanded for it. 

Sir John Anftruther is proprietor of a third part of thd 
parifh ; Sir Robert Anftruther has one farm, and the remain- 
ing part is divided among 1 5 fmall proprietors. 

Antiquities — At the weft end of the town, there is a large 
mound, called the Chefierhill^ in the middle of which is a find 
well. Tv^ro or three years ago, in digging, on the fide of 
this mound, a foundation for a houfe, two fkeletons were 
found in the moft perfect prefervation, at a fmall diftancef 



^4 Statl/lical Account 

from each other. They were inclofed in a kind of coffin, 
confifting of a large ftone at each end and fide. 

IJle of May — South-eaft from Anftruther-Wefter, and fix 
miles diftant from it, in the mouth of the Frith of Forth, 
ftands the Ifland of May ; which, after the defolation of the 
Abbacy of Pittenweem, was fuppofed to belong to the pa- 
rifli of Anftruther-Wefter, the mother church, and in this 
light it was annually vifited by the minifter of Anftruther- 
Wefter, while it was inhabited by 14 or 15 families. 

It is computed to be one mile long, and three quarters of 
a mile broad ; it has a well of fine water, and a fmall lake, 
and aSbrds excellent pafture for fheep. It is frequented by 
a great variety of fea fowl, fuch as kittiewakes, fcarts, dun- 
ters, gulls, fea-pyets, marrots, &amp;c. 

On the ifland is a light-houfe, erected upon a tower 45 
feet high ; it was built in the reign of King Charles I. ^nd 
a duty is exa£ted, of idi. per ton, upon all ftiips which pafs 
the ifland. The archittdt, who planned and built the tower, 
perifhed in his return to his houfe, in a ftorm, which fome 
old women, then fuppofed to be witches, were burnt forraifing. 
There was a priory on this ifl-ind, for fome monks of the order 
of St Auguftine ; it belonged firft to the abbacy of St Andrews, 
and afterwards to Pittenweem. There was a chapel dedicated 
to St Adrian, who was murdered by the Danes, in one of their 
incur fions, and buried here in the 870. There is a ftone 
cofiin which has ftood expofed to the injuries of the wea- 
ther, time immemorial, in the church-yard. Tradition fays 
that it once contained the reliques of St Adrian. 

A very intelligent farmer, who has dealt in ftieep above 

thirty 



^ Anjiruther-Wejler. ^ 

thirty years, and has had them from all the different corners 
of -Scotland, fays, that he knows no place fo well adapted 
for meliorating wool, as the IQand of May; he adds, that 
the fleeces of the coarfeft woolled ftaeep, that ever came 
from the worft pafture in Scotland, when put on the Ifland 
of May, in the courfe of one feafon, become as fine as 
fattin ; their flefli alfo has a fuperior flavour ; and that rab- 
bits bred on this ifland have a finer fur than thofe which are 
reared on the main-land. 

While employed in drawing up this account, a very me- 
lancholy accident happened, which ought to be recorded, as 
a warning to future times. The keeper of the Ught-houfe, 
his wife, and five children, were fuffbcated. One child, an 
infant, is ftill alive, who was found fucking at the breafl: of 
its dead mother. Two men, who were aflitlants to the 
keeper, were fenfelefs, but got out alive. This truly 
mournful event was owing to the cinders having been allow- 
ed to accumulate, for more than ten years. The cinders 
reached up to the window of the apartment where thefe un- 
fortunate people flept. They were fet on fire by live coals 
falling from the light-houfe, and the wind blowing the 
fmoke into the windows, and the door below being (hut, the 
confequences were inevitable. Thefe perfons were the only 
inhabitants, and all of them lodged in the light-houfe. The 
families, who formerly refided there, lodged in houfes detached 
from it. The old plan is to be again adopted ; and houfes 
are preparing for lodging the keeper, and a boat's crew, 
whicli will be of advantage to all the coaft, as they will be 
ready to give intelligence when the herrings come into 
the Frith. The revenue arifing from the light-houfe, was 
formerly let at L. 360 per annum; it was let laft: year at 
L.97P.

Mtfcellaneous Obfervatlons. — What the ftate of the fifherieaf 
once was, and how much they have declined, will appear 
from the following fa£ts, which are either taken from the 
records, or related on undoubted authority. The minifter 
drew the teinds (i. e. tythes  of fifh, as part of his ftipend; 
the town generally farmed them at the rate of ten, twelve, 
or fometime^ fifteen pounds a year. For tliefe laft twenty 
years they have never let for more than 1 3 s., and have been 
fometimes fo low as 5 s. The late Mr Nairne, minifter of 
Anftruther-Eafter, drew L. 55 per annum for the teinds of 
the herring fifliery alone ; but his fon the prefent minifter 
let them to the town for L. 22 : 4 : 5 Sterling. 

The town of Anftruther, and many others on this coaft, 
fuflfered much in the civil wars, in the reign of Charles I. 
both by fea and land. They were zealous covenanters, and 
there are few old inhabitants of the parifti, who do not talk 
of fome relations, that went to the battle of Kilfyth, in the 
year 1645, were never afterwards heard of. In 

this difafter, and in temporary failures of their fiftiing, An- 
ftruther lhared the fate of its neighbours, about the year 
1670, by an inundation of the fea, which deftroyed or 
chocked up the harbour, walhed away the bulwarks, and 
rendered many of the houfes unfafe to dwell in. An inun- 
dation of a fimilar kind happened about the end^f laft cen- 
tury ; when about a third of the town leems to have been 
deftroyed. A long ftreet, called the fore ftreet, was totally 
deftroyed ; fcarce a veftige ot it now remains. The rock on 
which the town houfe once flood, is covered by the fea 
every fpring tide, and every tide the fea wafties the ftreet, 
where the principal houfes of the borough were fituated. 

The old people date the decay of the towns on this coaft 

to 



of Anjlruther-Wejlen 



87 



to the Union with England. It is evident, that that event 
did undoubtedly give a great fhock to the trade of thefe 
towns. Their ftaple commodities were malt, herrings, and 
cod. Before the Union, there were 24 fhips belonging to 
Earter and Wefter Anftruther, and 30 boats employed in 
the fifliery. In 1764, there were only two (hips, each 40 
tons burden, and three fiihing boats belonging to Anftru- 
ther-Eafter, and one of 20 tons, and two fifliing boats to 
Anftruther-Wefter. At prcfcnt the number of fhips be- 
longing to Eafter and Wefter Anftruther, is 20, their ton- 
nage 1x72, men employed 94, of which fix in the foreign, 13 
in the coafting, and one in the filhery trade ; eight of thefe 
belong to Anftruther- Wefter, whofe tonnage is 532, and 
they employ 36 men At prefent there is not a fingle perfon 
in the parifti, who can properly come under the denomma- 
tion of a fiftierman ; yet in the herring feafon there are four 
boats, which are manned by the tradefmen of the place, and 
fome mariners, and fitted out for filhing. Ever fince the 
battle of Kilfyth, the people here have a ftrong averfion to a 
military life ; in the courfe of twenty-one years, there is only 
a fingle inftance of a perfon inlifting, and it was into the 
train of artillery. There has not been a fufpicion of murder 
for thefe 50 years. A fingle inftance of fuicide is remem- 
bered about the 1 744. No perfon has been tried before a 
criminal court fince the 1732, and he petitioned for banifti- 
ment. This is the only inftance even of banifliment. 

Agriculture is much Improved ; the cattle employed are of 
a better breed, and in finer order, and the tenants enjoy 
more of the comforts of fbciety, and are in a more affluent 
ftate than their predeceflbrs. This change is probably owing 
to the following caufes : Formerly the rent was all paid in 
viftual, which the tenants were obliged to drive fix Scots 



miles,

Statijfical Account 



miles, at any time between Chriftmas and Candlemas ; they 
were obliged to lead the proprietors coals during the fum- 
mer ; befides a ftated number of other carriages, fuch as 
flop.e, lime, and timber ; if required, they paid a certain 
number of hens and chickens, and they were allowed to 
fublet or let off part of their farms to inferior tenants. In 
many places the proprietor drew the teind on the field. No 
tenant, however favoured, was allowed to lead any part of his 
corn, till the whole was ready, and in fome places they 
were obliged to make the barley into malt, and to pay their 
rent in the grain thus manufadtured. The great prices of 
cattle and grain, and the marker of Glafgow, of late opened 
to this county, by the canal, which takes off vafl: quantities 
of wheat, barley, and beans, have given a fpur to induftryj^ 
which, joined to the improved mode of culture, have melio- 
rated the face of the country, and added to the wealth of the 
farmers. It is well known, that this country was vifited with 
a great famine in the year 1699. It had been preceded by 
fome years of late and rather fcanty crops, and it was at- 
tended with a great mortality. From an account publifhed 
in the beginning of this century, and from tradition, it is 
probable, that in fome pariflies nearly one third of the in- 
habitants died. The only manufadtures exported, are Ofna- 
burgs and green linen. There are three ale-houfes in the 
parifh, which do not feem to have any bad effedl on the 
morals of the people. The peculiar difadvantages of the pa- 
rifh are, the encroachments of the fea, and the harbour not 
admitting fhips of burden. The people in general are fober 
and induftrious. They enjoy in a reafonable degree the 
comforts and advantages of fociety, and are contented with 
tjieir fituation.

<p>NantCf Extent^ iffc, 

THIS parifh had its name cirigirtally from a very fmall 
loch, near the church and the houfe of Flowerdale, 
and fo clofe by the fliore, that the lea at high tides covers it. 
The etymology bf it is abundantly clear, and fignifies in the 
traelic language a (hort contrafted loch. 

The parirti of Gairloch Is fituated in the county of Rofs, 
in the prcfbytery of Lochcarron, arid fynod of Glenelg. Its 
length is no lefs than 32 miles Englilh, and its breiadth 
about eighteen; 

Soil. — ^This country refembles many other parts of the 
Highlands of Scotland. The vallies are furropnded with 
hills, that aflbrd good pafture to different kinds of cattle. 
As the parifh abounds in hills and mofTy ground, the arabl? 
parts of it are confcquently but of a fmall extent. When 
the fcafon is favourable, the crops are by no means bad, 
yet they fcarccly ferve the inhabitants above feven or eight 
months. The potatoes the farmers plant, and the fifli they 
catch, contribute much to their fupport. This country.

of eight ftones, at i6s. and when provifions are high, at i8s. 
and upwards. 

Rivers and Antiquities. — There are many rivers in this pa- 
, riHi, but no bridges nor pafiage but by horfes ; and there- 
fore, when thefe rivers overflow their banks, which oftent 
happens in the winter and Tprlng' Teafohs, and fometimes 
even in fummer, travellers are detained, and are expofed to 
delays, and additional expdnces. There are two large rivers 
near the caft end of this pari^i, whiclv meet and run int-o 
one zt KenlocJbew, which in the Earfe .language imports the 
Head, of the Loch-River. Thefe two river.s empty them-r 
felves into Loch-Mari. This loch again is 12 computed 
iniles in length, and more in fome,..pafts than . a mile inr 
breadth. There are 24 fmall iflands in it, which arc 
beautified, with fir -trees, and a variety of other kinds- of 
wood ; in one of , thefe iflands there is an antient burying- 
pbce, called I/IeancI-AIari, vfkcre the people on the norti* 
fide of the loch flill continue to bury their dead. There 
is a well in it of a falubrious quality, the water of which 
hatla been found, for ages pafl, very ferviceable to many dil- 
eafed perfons. The remains of a Druidical temple is like-* 
wife to be feen in this fmall ifland. 

-F//^-',-— Gairloch has been for many ages famous for the 
cod-fifliing. Sir Hedtor M'Kenzie of Gairloch, the p.-efenl; 
proprietor, fends to market annually, upon an average, be-

aifo frpm time Immemorial been remarkable for the herrlng- 
lifhing. The coaft of this parifli abounds in very fafe har- 
bours for veflels of all dimenfions. 

Agriculture. — Oat5 and barley are fown in this country. 
Some of the gentlemen fow a fmall quantity of peafe, which 
when the harveft is warm and dry, yield profitable returns ; 
our time of jfowing oats, black and white, is commonly from 
the middle of Marjch to.the end of April ; within which period 
we alfo plant potatoes ; we fow barley from the beginrfiri^vof 
May to the loth of June our lateft barley is feldom the worft 
part of the crop, when the fummer proves warm and 
fliowery. Our harveft jcommences about the end of Auguft, 
and tJie crop is gathered in about the loth.of 0£tober. Our 
crop frequently fufFers niujch from ftiaking winds, attended 
svith heavy cold rain, about the autumnal equinox. 

Difeajes. — No peculiar local diflemper of any kind is pre- 
valent in this parilh. Fevers are frequent ; fometinies they 
are of a favourable kind ; at other times they continue long, 
and carry off great numbers. An infe£lious and putrid fever, 
parly in winter laft, made its way from the north over a 
iong trait. of .different countries, and proved fatal to many. 

Population.. — There were in this parifh in the year 1774, 
)f examinable perfons about 2000. And from that period 
to the prefent, there is an increafe of ' 200 fouls, and up- 
wards. In Dr Webfter's report the number was 2050. 
There are a few people in the parifh at the age of 86 and 
87. Two died lately who arrived at the age of an 100 years.

already obferyed, there 15 no fchool but the parochial, by 
which means the rifing generation fuflrer much, and arc

two neighbouring parilhes. 

Church.'— AW the people of every denomination are of the 
eftablifhed church ; there are no Diircntcrs, Seceders, nor 
any other kind of feft whatever in the parifli. The churci^

fome years paft been in a ruinous fituation ; and was therev 
fore taken down this fummer, and a new elegant churcl^ is 
"building. There are three places of public worftiip in the 
parifli, exclufive of the church, viz. Kenlochew, Chapel of 
Sand, and the croft of Jolly. The church and manfe are at 
the diftance of fix Jlnglifli miles from each other. The 
manfe is very near the fliore on the north of the church, 
and fuppofed to be in the centre of the parifli. The valu^ 
of the li^*"E exclufive of the glebe, and including the ex-

PARISH OF <name ref="NA">MARNOCH</name>, 

(County of Banff".) 
By the Rev. Mr James Innes.</head> 

<p>. . 

Nattif, Situation^ Soil, and ProduSIions. 

ABERCHERDER was the old name of this country 
and parilli, which is now called Marnoch, the church 
being dedicated to' St Marnoch. This parifti lies in the 
county of Banff, prefbytery of Strathbogie, and fynod of 
Moray. It is from nine to ten meafured miles in length, and 
from four to five in breadth. In general it is rather flat, low- 
lying land, being moftly furrounded with hills upon the 
weft, north, and eaft, which are covered with heath. The 
river Doveron, which is not navigable, runs from five to fix;^ 
miles along the fouth fide of the parifti. The foil near the 
banks of the river, is a rich loam, and produces good crops. 
Toward the upper part of the country, it is wet, ftoney, and lliff. 
The crop confills of barley, oats, peafe, potatoes, and turnips. 
A very large quantity is annually exported from Banff, Port- 
foy, or M'Duff. The befl: arable and meadow ground rents 
/(fr acre from 15 s. to 20 s.; the rent of inferior from, 6 s. 
8d. to 2s. 6d. The parifh is fully provided with good 
peats. Confiderable numbers of cattle are reared yearly and 
fold, and libewife a large quantity of butter and cheefe. 
There are feveral extenfive plantations of various kinds of 

wood.

farms cannot be precifely afcertained. Tirere are farms that 
pay rent from L. 4o to:L. 70 Sterling, and many lefler onea

a fedentary life ; bfeing either country gentlemen, farmers, or 
crofters, their bufinefs occafions them to be much in the

Church. — The church is very old, and in a very ruinous 
condition. James Donaldfon, Efq; of Kinnairdie, is the pa- 
tron. . About twenty years ago, the church was repaired, and 
galleries were eredled fufficient to accommodate 300 people. 
A new and much larger church is to be built next year, 
which clearly Ihows the increafe of population here, occa- 
fioned partly by a good many extenfive farms being parcelled 
out and let in crofts, which alfo made a confiderablc in-

By an enumeration made this year, the whole population 
amounts to i960, 84 of which are Roman Catholics, 60 
Epifcopals, and eight or ten Seceders. In Dr Webftcr's re- 
port the number was 1 894. 

The bridges were built, and ai-e held in repair by the 
county, and the roads by the ftatute labour. There are 
about 500 work horfes, and about 30CO cattle, in the parifli. 
There are about 500 different families, which, at an average, 
will make near four perlons in each. There are no lioufes 
uninhabited, and many more have beqn lately built than 
pulled down. 

School. — The fchoolmafter has only 100 merks falary, 
two guineas as feflion-clerk, i s. per quarter for teaching 
Englifh, I s. 6d, for writing and reading, and 2 s. for Latin 
and arithmetic; 3^ d. for each certificate, 6| d. for each bap- 
tifm, and is. 7 d. for each marriage. At the parochial 
fchool there are from 12 to 20 or 30 fcholars ; at tle cha- 
rity fchool in Foggicloan from 40 to 60. 

There are fix alehoufes in the parlfia.

    PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1026799">ELLON</name>, 

{County of Aberdeen.') 
By the Rev. Mr James Mili^.</head> 



<p>Namey Extent, and Surface. 

THE etymology of the name Ellon is unknown. It is 
lituated in the county and fynod of Aberdeen, and is 
the feat of a prefbytery. The parifli of Ellon is in length 
from fouth to north, about nine meafured miles, and in 
breadth from eaft to weft, five meafured miles. The face of 
the country is uneven ; but it cannot be faid to be hilly, 
though there is a good deal of rifing ground in it, which 
goes under the denomination of hills ; but they are very in- 
confiderable. They are generally covered with heath, as are 
alfo fome of the lower grounds. 

5o/7, ^c, — ^The nature of the foil is very various. Some 
grounds, efpecially in the fouthern parts of the parifli, and 
along the river fide, are dry ; but in the northern parts, 
they are generally wet and mofly. There are no lakes in the 
parifli. The fmall river Ythan runs through the parifli 
from weft to eaft. It has its rife in the eaftmoft parts of the 
parifli of Forgue, about 15 or 16 computed miles from 
KHon, and runs through the pariflies of Auchterlefs, Fyvie,

Methlick, Tarvis, Ellon, and Logic- Buchan, and at Newi 
burgh enters into the fea. 

Fijh. There is a valuable falmon fifhing on this river at 

Ellon, which yields of yearly rent about L. 80 Sterlingi 
The greateft part of the falmon are fent to Aberdeen for ex- 
portation ; and what is fold on the Ipot, has, for fome years 
paft, fetched from 4d. to 6d. the pound, Dutch weight; 
There are alfo plenty of excellent trout and eels in the river, 
and a kind of (hell filh, in which are found pearls, generally^ 
indeed, of fmall fize ; but frequently of conliderable value; 
This fmall river is navigable, from its mouth at Nevvburgh, in 
the parifli of Foveran, by large boats, or what are called 
lighters, at high tides, very near Ellon, and at ordinary 
tides, within half a mile of it. 

Population.'— There is reafon to believe, that the antient 
ftate of the population of the parifti was materially, differ- 
ent from its amount at this time. The prefent popu- 
lation amounts to about 1830, of which number there are 
857 males, and 973 females. In Dr Webfter's report the 
number is 2523. There are in it under the age of i a or 14 
years, 400. — Under the age of 20 or 24, — 460. — Of about 40 
years of age, 520. — And above 40 years, about 450. The 
average of births in the parifh, for the five laft years, is 24 
males, and 1 8 females. The average of marriages, in the fame 
time, is 22. The average of burials in the fame time, is 1 6 
males, 18 females. There are no tt)wns in the parifli. Ellori 
is the only village, in which there at prefent reilde, young 
and old, 190 perfons. The number of farmers may be rec- 
koned to be about 60 ; but many of their farms are vcrv 
fmall. Upon the largeft farms are commonly employed, 
four men fervants, two women fervants, and two and ■ n-ie- 

times 



'oo Statiftical Account 

times three boys. Upon the common and ordinary farms, 
one man fervant, one woman fervant, and one or two boys! 
The number of handycraftfmen, fuch as fmiths, wrights, 
weavers, taylors, fhoemakers, mafons, &amp;c. may be between 
60 and 70.— The number of apprentices, about 20. The 
number of clergymen refiding in the parifh are two j the 
one of the Prefbyterian, the other of the Epifcopalian com- 
munion. The number of the eftablifhed church is about 

'^73 — The number of Epifcopalians about 130 Of Sece- 

ders about 27.-.Thcre are no Roman Cathohcs in the pa- 
rifh. The number of inhabited houfes may be about 440. 

^ ^griculture.^The pariflb produces plants and trees of va- 
rious kinds J but oats, and bear are its principal produce. For 
fome years paft, turnip, rye-grafs, clover, and potatoes, have 
been raifed in greater quantities than formerly. There are 
fome fmall plantations of fir trees ; and there are alfo aft, 
elm, alder, and fome other barren trees j but not in any 
great numbers. The number of acres cannot be afcertained. 
The parifh does more than fupply itfelf with proviGons. 
Small fpots of ground are here and there employed in railing 
flax ; but many more in raifing fown grafs. 

Church. — The minifters ftipend, by decreet in the year 
1721, is 1000 merks, one chalder of meal, one chalder of 
bear, and 100 merks for communion elements. The glebe 
is fcarcely legal ; but in its prefent culti\^ated ftate, is worth 
L. 9 or L. 10 Sterling, yearly. The patron of the parifh is 
the Earl of Aberdeen. The number of heritors or pofTef- 
fors of landed property in the parifli, is fix, who all re- 
fide in the parifh, except Robert FuUarton Udny of Dud- 
wick, Efquire. 

School.

School— falary and perquifites of the fchoolmaftcr, 
amount to about L..13 Sterling yearly, with a dwelling- 
Loufe and garden, and igo merks from the proprietor of 
the eftate of Watertown, with fees from the fcholars, who 
are not at all numerous. 

Faor.—Thx:. number of the poor in the parifli, at prefent 
receiving iupply from the poor's iunds, is 40. The annual 
amount of the contributions for their relief is ablaut L. 43 
Sterling, arifing from the weekly collections, the annual rent 
©f a fraail fum of money, and the rent of a little croft of 
land i befides 10© merks mortified to the poor in the eftate 
of £llon. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — The principal difadvantage of 
the louthern parts of the parifh, is the fcarcity of fuel. 
And a general difadvantage throughout the whole, is flxort 
leafes, and no encouragement to the tenants to iuclofe their 
grounds. — The valued rent of the parifli is L. 8950:6:8 
Scots. The fuel commonly made ufe of is peat ; which 
is very expenfive, elpecially in the fouth parts of the parifh, 
which lie at a great diftance from moifes. Some people 
of late have begun to ufe coals, both Scots and iinglifli, 
which would be by far the cheaper fuel, were it not burden- 
ed with a moft unrealbnable tax. Tney coft at Newburgh 
from 4 s. to 4 s. 6 d. per boll ; befides carriage by land, for 
the moft part four or five computed miles. The ploughs 
are many ; almoft every perlbn who rents any land from 
an heritor having one. The manufafture moft generally 
carried on, is the knitting of ftockings, in which all the 
females are commonly employed, with fome old men and 
boys. Of late fome are employed in fpinning linen yarn, 
and eafily earn more than by the ftockings. There was a

is not as yet carried on to great extent. The roads are not 
in a very good ftate, They have been made originally by 
ftatute labour, and by it are repaired ; Ibmetimes it is com- 
muted, and it is the general wifli, that it were all com- 
muted on moderate terms. There are pretty good bridges 
in the moft frequented roads j and a bridge over the Ythan 
at Ellon, is very foon to be built. The money requifite for 
it is already almoft ralfed by a voluntary fubfcription. The 
rent of fome land in this parifh, is from 30 s. to 40 s. per 
acre j in general, good land is valued at 1 3 s. or 15 s, per 
acre, and a great deal at i o s. fome at 5 s. and fome much 
lower. There is but little ground inclofed, except fome 
about the heritor's houfes, and by a few of the principal far- 
mers •, all are convinced of the advantages of inclofures, and 
would generally fet about inclofing, if they had long enough 
leafes. There are five alehoufes in the parifli, and one inn 
in the town of Ellon.

THE parifli of Loudoun is fituated in that part of the

from eaft to weft is nine Englifli miles ; its breadth towards 
Eaglefliam is about feven miles ; but at the weft extremity it 
is not above three miles broad. There are four villages in 
the parilh, firft Newmilns afi antient borough of barony. 
Their charter of ereftion the inhabitants obtained from

and Galfton parifli ; two of them have been lately dug up, 
in which burnt human bones were found ; and an urn with 
human bones that had been burnt, was alfo found. A ftone 
coffin was hkewife found, four feet ten inches long, and 
about ig inches broad. It was full of human bones ; the 
top was free ftone, and the fides whin ftone. The urn was 
about fix inches diameter at the mouth, and had no infcrip-

irion. The field adjoining is vulgarly czlkd Anciors- Field ; 
but in the old charters, irs real name is Acorns- Field ; 
where, probably, was a grove of oaks, held in veneration by 
the Druids. 

The cuftom fiill remains amongft the herds and young 
people to kindle fires in the high grounds, in honour of" 
Beltan. Be/tan, which in Gaelic fignifies Baai, or BePs-^fe, 
was antiently the time of this folpmnity. It is now kept on 
3t Peter's day. 

As the Danes were undoubtedly in pofTcffion of great part 
of Cunningham, there are two ruins, ftill called caftles, that 
refemble Danifli forts ; the one in the village of Auldton, 
and the other near Derval, which is more entire, and fur- 
rounded by a deep ditch, and a place where there appears to 
have been a draw- bridge, and oppofite to it, a gate that led 
to the caftle. The Knights Templars had lands in this pa- 
rifh, as the n^mes and charters plainly indicate ; as Temple- 
Hill, Temple-Derval, neither dq they hold of any fuperior, 
rot even of the Crown. Near Derval is a place called 
Glenchapel, but there is not the leaft veftige of a church or 
chapel. There are iikewife the ruins of an antient cafile be- 
longing to the family of Loudoun, which was burnt 300 
years ago, by the clan Kennedy, who were headed by the 
Earl of Caffilis. There is a very old caftle belonging to the 
fame family, in the village of Newmilns, ft ill entire, but 
very fmall. The houie of ^JOudoun is at a little diftance in 
the woods ; which was greatly improved by an addition 
made to it by Chancellor Loudoun, in the year 1622. In 
this houfe there is a library room 90 feet in length. The 
library confifts chiefly of Greek and Roman daffies, and at 
prefent contains about 10,000 volumes. In the inclofures,

near tlie houfe, is a Druidical ruin. The late Earl John, in 
trigging ^I's garden, found ten brafs cannon quite entire, two 
feet under the furface ; they were about fix pounders, of the 
fwlvel kind, with the Canapbell's arms, and are flill ufed on 
birth days ; but we have no tradition concerning them. 

Se&amp;arles and Heritors. — There are two Seceding meetings 
in the parifh, one of the fe^t of Antiburghers, and the other of 
the old Covenanters. In this laft feft there are not above 
fifty. There are about ten or twelve Burgher Seceders. 
No family of note has a refidencc in the parifh, except the 
Countefs of Loudoun's, now a minor. Four fifths pf the 
parifh is her property. The other heritors, and feuers, are 
numerous, but they all pay feu to the family of Loudoun, 
except Captain Nifbet of Carfin, near Hamilton. 

Church. — The church is new and in good repair. The 
manfe was built in 1768, and is in good order. The flipend 
is in meal 76 bolls, bear :2 bolls, at an average L,69, in 
money L. 2t, gnd L. 3 : 16 : 8 for communion-elements ; in 
all L. 93 : 1 6 : 8. The glebe is 1 2 acres. The flipend is very 
ill paid ; the bear by more than thirty fmall feuers, and the 
ineal likewife in fmall quantities. The money is paid by 
ten or twelve tenants ; and the flipend has not been augj- 
^nented for 140 years pafl. 

School. — The fchool is one of the beft in the weft country. 
It has a flate roof, and a very good accommodation for the 
fchoolmafier above the fchool-room. The teaching room is 36 
feet long by 16 feet within the Walls, and IQ feet high. 
The fchoolmafter's falary is L. 100 Scots ; he has fel^om lefs 
than 60 fcholars, and often above 80 or 90. He teaches 
phiefly JingUfli, at is. 6d./?y quarter j \yjth the addition of

^ arithmetic and writing, it is 2s. 6d, per qnafter. He teaches 
alfo menfuration and book-keeping ; his payments for bap- 

I tifms, feffion-cleric, and marriages, a few pounds. His Whole 
income is not above L. 30. 

Climate^ Situaiio}!, find Di/ea/es.— This parifli is fituated at 
the extremity of the fine ftrath upon the river of Irvhie* Ic 
is bounded by very high hills on the north and fouth. We 
have much rain, but very little fnow. The narrow ftrath 
from eaft to weft forms a kind of Ventilator, which, un- 
doubtedly, contributes greatly to the health of the inha- 
bitants. Except fmall-pox and meaftes, I never knew aa 
epidemic, or what deferved that name; I never faw an ague^ 
and fcarcely ever an infeftioUs fever ; a putrid fever never ; a 
piarple fever carried olF feveral people about 20 years ago, 
from improper management, by immediately bleeding, v/hich 
Was found to be very fatal by thofe of the Faculty who firfc 
tried it. Some years ago, nine children died of a difeafe 
called the clofihg^ or crbup. The difeafe that is moft frequent 
is the confumptlon. Scrophula or white fwelling is frequent 
from poor living, and fedentary life, and bad air in weaver's 
fhops, where they never have a fire. There are a few re- 
markable iriftances of longevity. Lady Loudoun died at the 
age of 160 in 1779, and enjoyed all her faculties to the laft. 
Several^ people die above 50, and many above 80. Inocula- 
tion is gradually coming into ufe } and is always fuceefsful. 

Agriculture. — The time of fowing oats, is from the end of 
March to the end of April ; and immediately when the oats 
are fown, the bear is begun to be fown, which is finifhed be- 
twixt the middle and end of May. We fow very little peafe, 
and no beans, or wheat. Ever)' perfon, whether in town or 
country, pla.-.ts a few potatoes* 8ome few farmers fow rye-

grafs, and a fmall proportion of red or white clover for hay, 
or cut grafs. The late John Earl of Loudoun, fucceeded his 
father in the year 173T, and deferves the name of the father 
of agriculture in this part of the fhire. He had both a great 
tafte, and great quicknefs of parts. He prudently began 
with making roads through the parifh, as early as the year 
1733 ; and an excellent bridge was, by his influence, built 
over Irvine water ; and the road from thence, and from his 
houfe to Newmilns, was the firft made road in the fhire of 
Ayr, which was done by the ftatute work. He remembered 
when there was neither cart nor waggon in the parilh, but 
his father's, Earl Hugh, and his fadlor's. Now there are 
above 250 In the parifh, befides waggons for leading grain, 
peats, &amp;c. Formerly they carried home their grain in 
Hedges or cars, and their coals on finall horfes. At the fame 
period Earl John began to plant and inclofe •, he is faid 
to have planted above one million of trees. The trees 
are moftly afti, elm, oak, and many of them are of a 
great fize. One crop of hoop-willows from a fmall inclo- 
fure of three roods, fold for L. 27. The weeding and thin- 
ning the plantations of elm, and afh, &amp;c. yield from two to 
three hundred pounds annually. Many afh and elm trees 
fell at one, two, and fometimes three guineas. They were 
all planted from the year 17^3, progreffively, to the year 
1775. The number of farms planted and inclofedj are about 
fifty, inclofed and fubdivided into fmall farms, from 20 to 30 
acres each; in all about 6000 acres. Add to this about 1570 
acres ; the whole of which is inclofed, and amounts to 
7570 acres, including 95 acres of natural wood, and 250 
acres of planted ground. About 1000 acres in flieep farms 
are not yet inclofed.

five or fix hme quarries, fome of them nine feet thick, and very 
near the furface, and not interrupted by water. The whole 
ground round the manfion houfe is full of coal : two feamsy 
one a little below the other, have been worked to great ad- 
vantage, (efpecially of late, as the demand has increafed bjr 
the lime-works, and the increafe of the number and riches 
of the inhabitants,) yielding annually about L. 200. of profitV 
But, a few years ago, the pits were fo rapidly filled with- 
water, that the tutors of the Countefs were obliged to caufe 
ereft a fire engine, which coft near L. 1000 ; but it ahfwer- 
ed the end, and the coal is of immenfe benefit to the parifli, 
and to the farmers for burning lime. There are five draw-- 
kilns, which, when going, would produce 740 bolls of lime 
in 24 hours. The lime is fold to the country, at from 5d. 
to 6 A. per boll, and to the tenants upon the eftate of Lou- 
doun, at 4id. per boll, of five Winchefter bufbels, with one" 
year's credit to the induflrious tenant. 

Sheep. — There are only four fheep farms in the parifii, 
containing about 60 fcore. Nine farms keep fheep, and are 
partly arable. In thefe the number is about 50 fcore ; arid 
in the other farms, not belonging to the eflate of Loudoun, 
about 3 2 fcore. The flieep are all black faced, and have 
coarfe wool, which fells at feven or eight fliillings per 
ftone tron weight. 

i^tff/, S«7, ^c, — There are nearly 10,000 acres in the 
parifh, and three fourths of the land are arable. There are 
extenave mofles. The inhabitants of Newmilns and Dervall, 
&amp;c. raife and fell peats at 10 d. and i s. ^fr fniall waggon. 
But the ready accefs to coal has diminiihed the demand for 
peats. The foil, in general, is a rich deep loam, and mirch

Btatijlical AccQuni 



improved by lime ; and a fmall part is light and gravelly. 
The rent of the arable land, about thirty years ago, was 
from 5Si to los. it is now from lo s. to L. i : 4 : o per acre ; 
near the villages an acre gives twO, arid fOmc acres three 
pounds. 

Prices of HorfeSy Labour^ and Servants Wages.— ^ork-xng 
horfes, twenty years ago, fold from L. 10 to L. 16, and now 
from L. 16 to L; 25; The wages of men fervants are now L. 7 
and L. 8 anhually. Some labourers, that have houfes in the 
villages, or near farmfcrs houfes, are occafionally employed. 
Their wages in winter are is. or 8 d. and their vidluals, ia 
fummer is. 2d. Mafons of late receive is. 8 d. per day^ 
and houfe-carpenters i s; 6 d. befides their vi£luals. Women 
fervants receive from L. i : 5 to L. i : 15 per half year. There 
are about 100 ploughs in the parifh, moftly of the old Scots 
kind, with improvements. Milk cows fell, near the time of 
calving, from five to feven or eight guineas. 

Produce and Prices of Grain. — The parifli produces more 
provifions than ferve the inhabitants. The tenants tranf- 
port meal, butter, cheefe, and veal, to Edinburgh, Glafgow, 
and Paifley, &amp;c. The average price of meal is ix^d.per 
peck, for twenty years paft ; bear 19 s. per boll of eight 
bufhels, for the fame period. Butter from 10 s. to 12 s. per 
ftone, — Ikimmed milk cheefe, when perfectly new,gives 3 s. 4d. 
and in winter 4 s. per ftone tron weight ; fweet milk cheefe 
is from 6 s. to 8 s. /■/■ ftone. Butcher meat of all kinds never fells 
high in our little village ; whenever it is high, every thing is 
carried to the great towns. Lamb, when early, is fold from 
JOS. to 20s. ; veal brings Zd.per pound, &amp;c. It is a pro- 
fitable branch to the farmer to fatten his early calves ; when 
two or three months old, they bring from L. 2 to L, 4 each. 

Poor. 



of Loudoun* 



Poor. — ^There are no fums of money mortified for the 
poor. The heritors, minifter, and feffion, have a joint meet- 
ing annually, and appoint the penfions for the poor, general- 
ly from I s. to 2 s. weekly. In the interval, betwixt the an- 
nual meeting, the feffion, from time to time, takes in new 
annuitants. The condu^b of the poor is examined at each 
annual meeting. The fchoolmafter is allowed from the 
funds, wages for poor fcholars. The whole expence annually 
amounts to L. 50. The funds chiefly arife from the weekly 
qolledlions, the mort-cloth money, and the feat-rents of the " 
church. The truftees of Lady Loudoun allow generally 
JLi. 10 anpually to the poor's fluids^

<p>Extent, Sell, Surface, ^c. 

THIS parifh is of fmall extent, not exceeding 800 acres 
Englifti meafure. It was part of the priory of Cold- 
ingham ; and before the Reformation, it is faid, that the prior 
of Coldingham had a chapel of eafe here, and that it was 
ere£led into a parifli, no fooner than in the reign of King 
James VI. This parifh is about a mile fquare, including the 
farm of Highlaws, but its marches with thofe of Colding- 
ham, are indented, and very irregular. About one half of 
the lands are let in two farms, viz. Linthill, and Beanrigg. 
The reft are polTefled by the inhabitants of Eyemouth, in 
fmall parks and acre-dale. The feuers, fmall heritors, who 
are alfo mechanics, polTefs their own lands. Eyemouth is a 
borough of barony. Mr Home of Wedderburn, our prelent 
reprefentative in Parliament, is the fuperior, and is aUo pro- 
prietor of more than nine tenths of the land in the parilh. 
The yearly rent is from 25 s. to 40 s, per acre Englilh. There 
is not one foot of bad or wafte ground. The lands were all 
open twenty years ago ; but they are now almoft all indofed, 
and the rents are near double of what they were then. The 
foili in general, is good, and produces every fort of grain, of 

a 



a- good quality ; as well as fown grafs, turnips, and potatoes. 
The climate is dry, and perhaps as littk rain falls here, as ia 
any other part of Scotland. 

Antiquities. — Here are the remains of a regular fortification 
lipon a fmall promontory ftretching out to - the fea, which is 
^aid to have been erefted by the -Earl of Hertford, afterwards 
3)uke of Somerfet, when going to invade Scotland, while he 
held the regency, in. the minority of Edward VI. It was de- 
moliflied by treaty in Queen Mary's reign, foon after the 
battle of Pinkie. Though all the rocks along the cqaft are 
of the common hard whinflone, yet the promontory, upon 
which this fortification. has been built, conlifts of wha^t is called 
pudding Jlone. It is remarkably hard, and- will cut like mar, 
ble, and even ftands the fire. The two piers were built 
of it, which ftand both weather and .water without the leafl: 
appearance of wafte. 

Harbour and Trade — At the beginning 'of this century, 
£yem©uth was a mere filhing town j but, after the Union, it 
gradually increafed ; and, owing to its vicinity to England, it 
became remarkable for fmuggling but that pernicious trade 
'being much qualhed, -the gentlemen ..of this county, amongft 
their firft improvements, ere(9:ed a pier on the weft fide 
.of the harbour, about thf year i750jthat .coft about L. 2000, 
which was raifed by fubfcription i and, about the year 1770, 
another pier was built upon the eaft fide of the harbour., 
■which coft above L. 2500 ; which laft pier was planned and 
executed by Mr Smeaton,. 

The harbour of Eyemouth," Mr Smeaton remarks, " lies 
at the corner of a bay, in which (hips can work in and out at 
•all times of tide, or lie at an anchor fccure from all winds. 



' Staiiftical Jccount 

except the northerly and north eafterly. From this circum- 
ftance, its fitqation feems very advantageous : Put, as the 
jnouth of the river or harbour lies open to the northerly 
winds, fhjps cannot lie in Hifety therein, without going up 
beyond the elbow of the prefent quay, where the water being 
fhallower by feveral feet, and the breadth much contraded, 
the harbour is not only defeftive in point of capacity, but in 
fafety alfo ; for, at a full fca, (the mouth being wide), the 
fea tumbles in with fo niuch impetuofity, that great feas find 
their way round the elbow, and make the veflels, even there, 
|Ie not fo quiet as is to be wifhed. In order, therefore, not 
pnly to enlarge the harbour, but very greatly to increafe 
the fafety of veflels lying therein, it is propofed to build a 
north pier to defeqd the harbour's mouth ; and, to this end, 
iiature has furnifhed a ledge of rocks, not only capable of 
making the moft excellent of all foundations for fuch a pier, 
but in as advantageous a direction as could be wiflied upon 
vhich a pier is propofed to be built according to the plans; 
Bccompanying this Report : For, according to the diredlioii 
therein fpecified, the harbour will be defended from all fud; 
feas as annoy the bay ; and the only points from whence the 
harbour could be affedted by fqas coming in through the 
mouth, is Ij^nd locked by the points of the bay ; fo that the 
harbour will, in it5 whole extent, be perfectly fafe in all winds. 
It is alfo to be noted, that the fame pircumftances which con- 
cur to pfiake the harbour fale in all winds, afford the means 
of vefTds getting in and out in all winds ; and this proceeds 
from the entry into the harbour lying nearly at a right angle 
'vvith the direction into and out of the bay. It alio is a great 
advantage that there is a good flow of tide, which at fpring 
tides is faid to be twentv feet ; and there is at the lovi^efl ebb 
feveral feet of water, at low water, between the propofed 
pier headsj fo t|iat there will be fcldom lefs at neip tides than 

fixteem 



of Eyeniouihi 



ixteen or feventeen feet of water in the harbotir ; which is 
capable of receiving veflels from three to four hundred tons, 
according as they are more flat, or more ftiarp built, and 
which afterwards can, lipon a greater flow of tide, be got into 
a more advantageous birth. Another advantage to the exe- 
cuting the propofed defign arifes frorii a great quantity of* 
rough rocks that lie at the north werterly point of the bay, 
very proper for building the outfideS of the body of the pier, 
the infides of which may be done with rough fiones, v/on or 
blafted from the rocks, neighbouring to that upon which the 
pier is propofed to be built. By this means, the pier may be 
executed at a trifle of expence, in proportion to the extent and 
utility of the defigri ; for the rocks, that are reprefented with- 
in the intended pier, will be rerhoved and made lmooth,To a3 
to procure an addition of harbour- room at little or no charge, 
as they will be ufed within the pier. When this is done, there 
will be an addition of harbour-room in the fpace between the 
elbow before mentioned and the pier-heads, capable of hold- 
ing thirty fliips of middling fize, with I'ufiicient paflage} and 
tvhich, in tirhe of war, will be very ufeful on this coaft, not 
only for the refuge of coafters from the enemy, but, in bad 
weather, for privateers, and the fnialler fized velTels acting of- 
fenfivcly/' 

Previous to the ere£libn of the flrft pier, there was very 
little fair trade carried on ; but, ever fince it was built, much 
corn and meal have been brought into the county, and fliipped 
here, for Leith and other markets, to the extent of 20,000 
bolls annually, and, in fome years, more than double that 
quantity. For feveral years pall:, there has not been a fingle 
fmuggler refiding in this parifh. The former dealers in that 
illicit trade are now all dead, or removed to diftant parts. 
Not ope of them died rich, and the far greateft part of them

became bankrupt. For twenty years and upwards, We' havd 
had at leaft two wholefale merchants, who import wood, iron-, 
flax, tar, and other foreign goods. There is one good inii*, 
and too many alehoufes. 

Manufa&amp;'ure-!. — We have no manufadtory here ; nor is 
there any in the whole county, except two ' paper-mills, one 
near Dunfe, and the other near Ayton. 

i^t/^/«^(.— There are only fix fifhing crews in this place,- 
who take abundance of fifties, the greater part of which are- 
carried to Edinburgh. But, in place of fix, there is room for 
lixty boats, as our coafl abounds with fifties of all kinds, 
and of a good quality. We have alfo^ a herring fiftiery; 
and, in fome years, millions- are caught j and, after ferving 
the country demand, the reft are partly falted, and made into 
what are called luhite herrings^ and partly manufadtured into 
red herrings, and both are fent to London, and foreign 
parts, where they^ generally bring a good profit. Formerly 
they caught the herrings at what they called the Ground 
Drove^ which lafts only a few days ;• but now they alfo fifli 
for them by a Float Drovey which lafl:s for fome months ; i'o 
that they now get ten times the number they got formerly, 
and the herrings are of a far better quality, becaufe they ne- 
ver come to the ground till they are about to fpawn.- 

There is no other fuel than coal.. If we were not 
almoft prohibited from fupplying ourfelves with Scottifti coals, 
with one of the moft unreafonable duties that ever was im- 
pofed, viz. 3 s. 4 d. a ton, no other coals would be ufed. 
We complain of another grievance. This port is a branch 
©f the Cufliomhoufe of Dunbar, and our merchants are obli- 
ged to go there, which is a diftance of 20 miles, to report- e- 

very

very cargo, and get fufFerances to load or unload-, jrhd there- 
after to go back again for cockets and clearances, which is af» 
tended with much dangerous delay, and no fmall expence.

aSlicled with any infedlious or epidemical dileafes, except the 
ftnall-pox, the bad efFeds of which have of late been pre- 
vented by inoculation. The only complaints that prove mor- 
tal in this place, are different kinds of ffevers and confumptions ^- 
and thefe are moftly confined to the pooreft clafs of people, 
and afcribed to their fcanty diet.

partly from teinds of fiflies, which being (o variable, cannot

<p>Situation y Extent, ts* c. 

THIS parlfli lies near the eaft corner of Perthfliire, and 
in the prefbytery of Meigle, and fynod of Angus and 
Mearns. The church lies in latitude 56° 34' north and weft 
of Edinburgh, 5' longitude j Coopar Angus being a mile and 
an half fouth, and Dunfinnan hill bearing fouth, at the dif- 
tance of fix Englifh miles. The church is lituated centri- 
cally, at four miles diftance from the neareft Grampian 
mountains on one fide, and four miles from the neareft Sid- 
ley mountains on the oppofite fide ; which Sidley and Gram- 
pian mountains run from north-eaft to fouth-weft, parallel to 
one another, from the fea at Mohtrofe, to the Tay at Perth, 
and include Strathmore between them, in which the church 
of Bendothy ftands, at the diftance of 14 Englifti miles from 
Perth, and 17 miles from Dundee. The greateft length of 
the parifh is about fix qpiles from fouth to north, and the 
general breadth does not exceed an Englifli mile and an 
half. 

Rivers. — The river Ifla runs along the fouth eaft fide of 
the church, and within 200 yards of it. The river, from 



Staiijlkal Ai-comit 



Its confluence with the Dean, five miles eaftward of the 
church, to its confiuence with the Tay, five miles to tli;C 
weftward of the church, runs in a line from north-eaft t© 
fouth weft^ .parallel to the .Sidley and Grampian mountains. 
The Ifla ilTnes from the Grampians in a courfe from north- 
«weft to fouth- eaft, till it falls |nto, and follows the courle of 
■the Dean. The river Eroch, half way between the Dean 
and the Tay, fjills into the Ifla at right angles from 
the north weft, in the parifh of Bendothy, and divides 
that parifh into two equal parts. Seven miles up the 
Eroch from the Ifla, is the confluence of Airdle river, on 
the weft, and Shee river, on the eaft, which, after their con- 
^uence, take the name of ELroch. Eroch is a ftoney rapid 
r,iver. . ^ • 

Si?//, Vahie^ Wc. — The fides of the high grounds flope gra- 
dually to the Ifla on one fide, and to the Monk-myre on the 
other. The fkirts of . the. high ;grounds, on the eaft' and 
fouth, confift of a rich black earth. The low ground, under 
Ifla flood-mark, is moftly light fand. This .part of the pa- 
rifli is po,fl"efl"ed by three proprietors : The eaft part by the 
heirs , of , the late Dr Young of Edinburgh, which is the 
largeft eftate in the parifh ; the valued rent of ic being; 
L. 1411 Scots; and the weft part called Bendothy and 
Couty, by the Honourable James Stuart M'Kenzie, which is 
the fecond eftate of the parifli, and its valued rent is L. 958; 
enother proprietor occupying L. 129 valued rent in the mid- 
dle, Thefe eftates contain about 1500 acres of arable land, of 
which 35P are nnder Ifla flood mark, and let at about L. io8c 
Sterling ; befides 300 acres of fir planting. The average 
rent of an acre on thefe eftates is about 1 3 s. That part of 
t,he parifti which lies eaftward of the confluence of Eroch 
and Jfla, rifes with a gradual afcent from the Ifla to the 

northj 



of Bendothy, 



121 



^orth, and contains about 2100 acres, which let at about 
L. 874. It is pofleffed by 12 different proprietors. The 
.valued rent of the whole parifli is L. 6045 Scots. 

• Population. — In the low part of the parifli there are 79 fa- 
milies of the eftabliflied religion, and 350 people above feven 
years of age; 182 males, 168 females; there may be loq 
more of Seceders. In the infulated or highland parts, there 
are 42 families, and 156 people above feven years ; 68 males, 
•88 females. The whole inhabitants above feven years of 
age, are about 606. In the year 1648, there were 30 bap- 
tifms, in 1702, 42; in 1749, 33; in 1779, 20. We have 
no regular account of burials, 

^griculture.—Tht eftatcs of Bendothy and Cupargrange, 
are beautified with thorn hedges, and hedge rows of trees. 
On the eaft fide of Eroch the ground is moftly open, except 
fome fencible ftone d)'kes at St Fint and Muirtown. The 
farrns in this parifii are from 150 to 2o acres, and under; 
but generally 70 or 80 acres. The average produce of 
wheat, is eight bolls the acre, and the avei*age price is 20s. 
Oats and barley produce four or fix bolls an acre ; the ave- 
rage price of bear and oat meal, is 13 s. 4 d. Potatoes and 
fome lint are likewife raifed with advantage. Horfes are 
now ufed for the plough and cart ; two horfes draw the 
plough in foft ground, and four in grafs ground. Eight oxen 
■drew the plough here formerly, or fix oxen and two horfes. 

Wages y ^c. — The wages of men fervants are eight guineas 
and board, a-year ; womens wages are L, 2 : 10, and board ; 
a day labourer gets 8 d. or 9d. and board, or i s. or is. 2d. 
without it. Oats or barley threfliing cofi: 6d. a boll. Wrights 
and mafons get i s. 6 d. or i s. 8 d. a day. I?eef fells at 3^.d. 



123

and 4d. the pound, and hens i s. each. Cupar of Angus is 
the market town. | 

Poor — There are few objefts of charity belonging to the 
parifh. The weekly coUeaions are from is. 8d. to 2S. 6d. 
When this is deficient, ($d. is laid on every L. loo of value4 
rent, to be colledted half yearly from the heritors, and an equal 
fum from the tenants. 

Atttiqu'ities . — In the back wall of the church of Bendothy^ 
there is a figure, in a coat of mail, cyt at full length, of 
John Gumming, proprietor of Gouty, who died 1606. Qn 
the fame wall is a monument of Leonard Leflie, commenda- 
tor of the abbey of Gupar, who died 1605. Some years ago, 
there was dug out of the church, and now lies in the paf- 
fages, the monument of Donald CampbelJ of Keithock, fori 
of the abbot of Cupar, and grandfon of the ^l^arl of Argyle^ 
who died 1587. At Gouty, near the bridge, there is an arti- 
ficial mount or barrow, which was never opened, called the 
Law-hill, on the top of which is a flat, where an open court, 
or a juftice-air, may have formerly been held. On a field of 
Mudhall, on the banks of Ifla, half way between the Eroch 
and the church, there were four or five buildings difcovered 
a few years ago, under ground. They were built of un- 
drefiTed whin ftones ; the plough led to the difcovery. Aftev 
the rubbifli was cleared out, the infide of the building re- 
fembled the moon, the fecond day after the change. On 
one fide, the earth was faced up with a circular wall from 
the furface to four or five feet under it. Another circular 
wall of fame depth, faced up the earth on the fide oppofite. 
Thefe walls run in curves parallel to one another, and were 
fix or feven feet afunder in all parts. The fpace between 
^h^ w^Us was paved in the bottom with the fame rough 



of Bendothy, 



123 



ftoncs. The length of this curved building was from 1 5 to, 
20 yards. It was filled with afhcs, cinders, and earth, 
and the furface above had long been cultivated. I have ia 
my cuftody a ftone hatchet, found near the nine ftones of 
the Druid temple. It is made of a very fmooth hard 
ilone. 

Chunk and School. — The ftipend of the parifti is 104 bolls 
viftual, two parts meal, and one third bear, and L. 33 : 13 : 4 
Sterling in money. The fchoolmafter's falary is L. 100 
Scots. There are fix acres of glebe, a manfe and offices. 

Language.— 'The Earfe language is not fpoken in any part 
of this parifli.

    .PAkrSH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1026782">GLAMMISS</name>.' 
{Cou7ity of Angus,) 
By the Rev. Mr James Lyon.</head> 


<p>Kame, Extenty and Surface. 

THE modern name of this pariOi is Glcmmlfsy but its ety- 
mology is unknown. It lies in the' prefbytery of 
Forfar, and fynod of Angus and Mearns. It is about 12 
miles in length, and the greateft breadth is 5 miles ; but in 
fome places it is hardly one. The greateft part of this pa- 
rifh is flat country, and lies in the heart of Strathmorc, 
which is an extenfive plain, lituated at the foot of the Gram- 
pian mountains, and remarkable for its fertility. Large 
plantations of trees, together with the fields regularly divi- 
ded and fenced by hedge-rows, make the country round ex- 
ceedingly beautiful. Part of this parifh is rocky and moun- 
tainous, and the Sidlie hills run along the fouth fide of 
it. They are covered with heath, and are not remark- 
ably high. 

Soil. — The foil is in general good. It has been well culti- 
vated, and produces plentiful crops. About 60 years ago, 
the people were funk in floth and indolence ; but a variety 
of caufes have concurred to call forth their vigour, and to 

roufe 



of Ohmmip; 



roufe thetrf into aflion. Improvements have been, and ftiU 
are, carried on with ardour and fuccefs. The difcovery of 
marie has wonderfully contributed to the improvements in' 
agriculture. 

Amidft the many advantages which the people 
bere enjoy, the want of fuel is a great inconvenience. They 
generally ufe peats, of which there are plenty in different 
moffes ; but they are dug at a confiderable expence, and will 
foon be exhaufted. Some tranfport coals from Dundee, the 
neareft fea-port town, which is twelve miles diftant from' 
Glammifs. This defefl, however, will in a ftiort time be- 
fupplied by the extenfive woods planted by the late Jiarl of 
strathmore, which, are in a very thriving condition, and are 
\ great ornament to the country. 

Difea/es. — The air is rather moift, and neither very heal- 
hy, nor very unhealthy. Agues and melancholy habits 
ire not much known here. Fevers and confumptions are 
he moft prevalent diftempers, owing, it is fuppofed, to the 
noifture occafioned by the hills to the fouth, and the great 
luantity of planting. We have no mineral fprings of any 
ionfequence. 

Rivers and Fifies, — The river Dean, a deep running Water^- 
3 fupplied from the lake of Forfar. The Kerbet,. and the 
)urn of Glammifs, run through the parifh, and abound with 
plenty of fine red trout. There is a very confiderable lake 
n the eaft end of the parifh, near Forfar, called the Loch of 
Forfar. It originally contained. 140 acres ; but 60 of thefc 
lave been drained, and a great quantity of marie and peat 
lave been dug out, which has proved very advantageous to 
he Earl of Strathmore, the proprietor. When the lake 

was 



Stdif/lical Account 



was drained, a number of curious antiquities were found, and 
are to be feen in the caftle of Glammifs. 

Antiquit'its. — Within a few yards of the manfe of Glam- 
mifs, there is an obelilk, of rude defign, erefted, as is gene- 
rally fuppdfed, in memory of the murder of Malcolm II. 
King of Scotland; On one fide of the monument, there arc 
figures of two men, who, by their attitudes, feem to be 
forming the bloody confpiracy. A lion and a centaur, on 
the upper part,reprefent the (hocking barbarity of the crime. 
On the reverfe, feveral forts of filhes are engraven, as a fym- 
bolical reprefentation of the lake, in which, by miffing their 
way, the aflaffins were drowned. In a neighbouring field, there 
is a ftone on which are delineated a variety of fymbolical cha- 
ra£lers fimilar to thofe already mentioned, and intended, as is 
fuppofed, to exprels the fame faiSts. At the diftance of one 
mile from Glammifs, near a place called ColTans, there is an 
obeliik, not lefs curious than either of the two preceding 
monuments. It is vulgarly called 5/ Orlatid's Stoie. Nc» 
probable conjefture has been formed relating to the facts de- 
figned to have been perpetuated by it. On one fide is a crofs 
rudely flowered and chequered ; on the other, four men oa 
horfeback appear to be making the utmoft defpatch. One 
of the horfes is trampling under foot a wild boar ; and, on 
the lower part of the ftone, there is the figure of an animal 
fomewhat like a dragon* It has been thought that thefe 
fymbols reprefent officers of juftice in purfuit of Malcolm's 
murderers. There is a fortification on the fummit of a hill, 
two miles fouth-weft from Glammifs, known by the name of 
Denoon Qajilt, It probably was defigned for a place of re- 
treat in times of danger. It is encompafl'ed by a wall, fuppo- 
led to have been 27 feet high, and 30 broad. There are 
two entries, one to the fouth-eaft, and another to the north- 
weft. 



of Qlatmnifi* lay 

jtrefl:. The whole circumference is about 340 Englifh yards ^ 
tut, although this wail be much defaced, and alnioft covere4 
]fvith grafs, yet there are evident traces of buildings in the 
intermediate fpace. The only other work of antiquity in 
the parifh, is the Caftle of Glammifs. Tliis venerable ftruc- 
ture, the property of the Earl of Strathmore, and his chief 
feat in Scotland, is of very anticnt date. Fpr fome time it 
remained in the hands of the crown ; and, in the year 1372, 
it was granted by Robert II. to J. Lyon, his fpecial favour- 
ite, who not long after recpiyed his daughter in marriage. 
Since its original conftru^lion, it has hpca greatly enlarged. 

^/arries. — Befides other quarries of inferior note In thg 
parifli, there is near the village of Glammifs a free (lone 
quarry, the ftones of which are very durable, and are excel- 
lent for building and for millftones. There are abundance 
of fine gray flate quarries, in different places, belonging to 
the Earl of Strathmore and Lord Douglas. About twenty 
years ago, an attempt was made to find out a lead mine neap 
the village of Glammifs. It was wrought a confiderable 
time, and fome ore was found ; but the fcheme was not per- 
fifted in. 

Cattle. — A confiderable number of fine cattle are fed ia 
this parifh. One dealer in this article is often pofl!efl!ed of 
ten thoufaiid pounds worth of cattle at a time, moft of which 
he carries to the EngUlli marl^et. 

Population. — In the year 1783, the number of fouls in 
the parifli amounted to about 2040. In Dr Webfter's Re- 
port, the number is 1780. From the Regifter, it appear? 
that, in the year 171 8, there were 63 baptifms, in the year 
^740, 60, and in 1750, 69. In the year 1784, there were 

SI

Staii/lical Account 



51 baptifms, 36 burials, and 14 marriages. In 1786, 47 
baptifms, 38 burials, 17 marriages. From the i ft of Ofto- 
ber 1789, to theift of October 1790, there were 42 baptifms, 
37 burials, and 16 marriages. There are a aumber of villa- 
ges in this parifh. The village of Glammifs contains about 
500 fouls ; the Newtown of Glammifs about 140 ; Arnefont 
60 ; Cotterton of Hayfton 48 ; Nether-Handeck 39 ; Mill- 
town of Glen-Ogilvie 67 ; and Cottertown of Drumglye 1 20. 
The number of farmers in the parifh is about 80 ; fome of 
their farms are extenfive, and others but fmall. The num- 
ber of weavers and manufadturers is about 70. 

Heritors^ ^c. — The parlfli is divided among four heri- 
tors, the Earl of Strathmore, Lord Douglas, William Doug- 
las of Brigtown, and Mr Henderfon of Rochilhill. Lord 
Strathmore's eftate contains about 6000 acres. The greateft 
part of the unarable ground confifts of thriving plantations, 
to the extent of about looo acres. The yearly rent may be 
from L. 2500 to L. 3000 Sterling, fhe value of land, on 
this eftate, has rrfen confiderably within tb&amp;fe fifteen years. 
One farm, in particular, which was rented at L. 52 twelve 
years ago, now gives L. 300. The rental of the eftate of 
Lord Douglas in this parifh is about L. 500, an advanced 
rent from L. 200 fince the year 1770. The whole of this 
eftate contains about 3000 acres. The eftate of Mr Doug- 
hs of Brigtown in this parifli contains about 70 acres, and the 
prefent rental is about L. 50. The eftate of Rochilhill con. 
tains above 200 acres, and brings about L« 7° yearly rent. 
The parifli fupplies itfelf with provifions, and generally fends 
a confiderable quantity of meal and barley to different part« 
of the country. 

Chtinh, — The Earl of Strathnwre is patron of the parifjb. 

The 



of Gldmmifs, 129 

The ftipend is, of money, L. 52 : 15 : (5, with 40 bolls of 
meal, and 16 boljs of barley. The glebe contains rather 
more' than fix acres and a half, and is worth 40 s. an acre. 

Wages. — -The expence of a labouring fervant is generally 
about L. 8 or L. t) a year, with fix bolls and a half of meal. 
Maid-fervants wages arc about L. 3, befides maintenance. 

Poor The number of poor fnpplied from the funds of 

the parifh are about twenty, befides others who receive cha- 
rity occafionally. The kirk fefllon have a number of feats 
in the church at their difpofai, for which they draw about 
L. 7 annually. The average of weekly collections is lO^.

(County of Aberdeen,') 

By the Rev. Mr WiLLlAM WiLSON.</head> 



<p>Situation. 

DYCE lies about jSve miles north-weft of Aberdeen. 
It is bounded by Nt-whills on the Ibuth, Newmachar 
on the eaft, Fintray on the north, and Kinellar oa the weft. 
There is a hill, which runs quite crofs the parifti, from fouth 
to north, called Tyre-baggar, or perhaps, rather Tyre-beggar ^ 
as formerly the road from Garioch to Aberdeen, went over 
the middle of it, which muft have been very tirefome to 
travellers. Now the poft-road goes along the fouth end, 
which is more eafy. 

Soil, — As the parifh is hilly, there are many different foils 
in it. Along the fide of the river Don, there is excellent 
deep mould, which produces fine crops of barley, oats, and 
peafe ; and fome wheat has been tried of late, which anfwers 
very well. Towards the hill, about a 'rtile from the river 
fide, it is a black light mould, and produces but very indif- 
ferent crops. The hill is covered with heath ; and as there 
}s no other fuel, but what turf can be got on it, it is very 
much exhaufted. There are three plantations of fir trees 

upon 



of D^ce. 131 

upon this hill ; two of them belong to Sir William Forbes, 
Baronet. 

Jgnculture. — Agriculture advances here rapidly i the peo- 
ple fee the advantages of lime for^heir ground, which, in 
general, anfwers well ; and is brought from the neigh- 
bourhood of Aberdeen. They likewile fee the advantage of 
inclofures, of which there ^jre great numbers in the parilli. 
The nature of the air is dry and healthy. The people are 
llrong, and generally live long. 

Anttqtiities. — On the top of one of the hills belonging to 
Tyre-baggar, there is a Druidical temple. It conlifts of ten 
long ftones placed in a circular form j the diameter of it is 
about 24 feet. The liigheft of the ftones, which ftand on 
the fouth fide, are about nine feet above ground. The 
loweft, which are on the north fide, four and a half. There is 
one ftone placed on its edge, betwixt the two fouthmoft 
ftones, which is about fix feet high. They are all rough 
ftones, and of great bulk. There are feveral cairns within 
the parifli, but though they have their names, I can learn no " 
tradition concerning them. There are fmall cairns too on 
the tops and fides of the different hills, fcattered here and there, 
which I cannot account for, but by fuppofing there have been 
engagements in thefe places, and that the flain have been 
buried under thefe heaps of flones. There is another long 
ftone about 9 feet high, which is called the Gouch Jlone, in 
memory, as the country people report, of one Gouch a ge- 
neral, who was flaiif^there. 

Church. — The parifh church is faid to have been dedicated 
to St Fergus. The ftipend is only L. 56 Sterling. At one 
of the doors of the church (lands a ftone cut like a trough, 

which 



132 Statijlical Account 

which has no doubt held the holy wnter. In the church-yard 
dyke, there is a ftone fix feet high, on the one fide of Which 
is a crucifix diftinftly cut. 

parries, ^c, — There are no mineral fprings nor grottos 
in the parifh, nor any kind of ftone but the common moor- 
ftone, which is very good for building. About 24 years ago, 
quarrying and dreffing ftones for paving the ftreets of Lon- 
don, commenced ; and it has continued ever fince, almoft 
without intermiflaon. 

Population arid Cattle, ^c. — Though the parifh is of confi- 
derable extent, it is but thinly inhabited. The whole nua;ber 
of inhabitants exceeds not 352, of which there are 181 
males and 171 females. Ranked according to their ages, they 
ftand thusj under 10,-725 betwixt 10 and 20,-71 ; be- 
twixt 20 and 50,-157 ; betwixt 50 and 70,-45 » 
twixt "o and 100, — 7. As to births, marriages, and burials, 
at an average, there are in the year eight baptifms, four bu- 
rials, and two marriages. I'here are 70 dwelling. houfes. 
There are about ^4 large, and 46 fmall farms. There are in 
the parifii between 700 and 750 cattle. The number of 
fheep does not exceed 600. 

p^oy There are only five on the lift at prefent, who get re- 
gular fupplies, four "times a-year. They receive from 25 s. 
to 30s. yearly. Poor fubtenants with numerous families re- 
ceive occafional fiipplies, from los. to 15 s. The fund for 
fupplying our poor arifes from the contributioiw in the church,

{County of Wigton.) 
By the Rev, Mr Peter Fergussom.</head> 



<p>i Situation^ Name, Extent, and Surfacet 

THE parlfh of Inch is fituated in the county of Wigton, 
the prefbytery of Stranraer, and fynod of Galloway. 
Oppofite to the fmall village of Inch, where the church now 
ftands, is an ifland, whence, in all probability, the parifli de- 
rived its name ; the word for Ifland, in the Gaelic language, 
being fimilar in found to the name of the parifli. This ifland is 
fituated in the loch of Caftle Kennedy, and is about 600 
yards in circumference. In this ifland there was formerly a 
place of worfliip, vefliges of which are flill remaining ; and 
it communicated with the land by a caufeway and draw- 
bridge. The names of places in this parifh, and, indeed, in 
all the county, are Gaelic ; and are in general charaflerittic 
of the local fituation, or of fome peculiar circumftance. 
The parifh of Inch is nine miles long, and in fome parts the 
fame in breadth. About one half of the parifh confifts 
of flat and low land, forming an extenfive plain, which 
ftretches from Lochryan, nearly to the bay of Luce. On 
the eafl: and north-eafl: of this plain, rifes a beautiful range 
of hills, reaching from one end of the parifli to the other. 
The face of thefe is partly green pafture, and partly arable 

land.

land. Their tops, for fome miles, are covered with heath, till - 
you defcend on the other fide to the water of Luce, where 
there is excellent pafture, and good arable ground, 'i his 
water divides the parifh from Newluce ; difcharges itfelf into 
I^uce bay ; and abounds with falmon. 

Zoil and Produce.— The foil of Inch is various. Near 
Stranraer, there is a good loam. The reft of the parifh con- 
fifts chiefly of a light fandy foil. The hills abound in mofs. 
By the influence and example of the late Earl of Stair, the 
Inch has undergone a total alteration. It is but juftice to re- 
mark, that this noble and worthy perfonage, was the great 
promoter of improvement in this part of the country. As 
he poflefled Ikill and ability, fo he a£led on an extenfive 
fcale. He procured proper implements of hufbandry,— . 
paired and burnt mofly grounds, — divided and inclofed his 
lands, — drained fwamps and marlhes, — made excellent roads,. 
— tore up large tracks of barren ground, — and import- 
ed lime in great quantities both from England and Ire- 
land. Hence what formerly produced only heath, foon 
yielded rich crops of corn. The people beheld the benefi- 
cial eficdls of his meliorations. They were roufed from in- 
dolence and inadivity. Ignorance and idlenefs foon vanifli- 
ed, and labour and induftry occupied their place. As a 
fpecimen of the*excellent effedls of his Lordfliip's improve- 
ments, a farm which, preceding 1 790, was let for the fum of 
L. 7 : 2 : 6, now rents at L. 195 ; and another, previous to 
the fame date, was rented at L. 48 : 4 : 8, and is now let at 
L. 245. The fame nobleman found his eftate in this parifli, 
not only in a great meafure barren, but alfo naked. He 
therefore clothed and adorned it with large plantations of 
trees. During the fpace of twenty years, he planted annual- 
ly, at an average, at leaft 20,000 trees, chiefly Scots firs, 

with

with fome larlx, afli, beech, &amp;c. The valued rent of Inch 
B L. s954 Scots. There are farms from L. 10 and under, 
to L. 300 rent. The beft arable land lets at a guinea the 
acre. According to its quality, it rents from 5 s. 10 s. and 
15 s. to 20 s. The quantity of grain annually fold, may be 
ftated at 1000 Galloway bolls, or 2000, Linlithgow meafure. 
The crops confift chiefly of oats Both Poland and Blanter 
corn are fown, of which the former is by far the raoft pro- 
duftive. Bear in fome places anfwers well, and confiderable 
crops are raifed ; alfo fome wheat, and potatoes in abun- 
dance. Few attempt to raife flax ; it is, however, not un- 
productive in fome places of the parifh. Clover and rye- 
grafs are fown by the farmers in general, and with great ad- 
vantage. Some have been fuccefsful in railing turnip. 

Cattle and Sheep. — The Galloway breed of black cattle arc 
univerfally known and admired in both kingdoms. They 
arc finely fhaped, and have no horns. Attention to the fizc 
and fhape of the bull is of confequence. It is calculated 
that there are 2500 head of black cattle in the parilh of 
Inch, and about 5000 fheep, moftly of the Scots breed. The 
wool fells from los. to 12 s. the ftone. 

Population. — ^The whole inhabitants of this parilh amount 
to 1450 fouls, of which number 701 are males, and 7^19 fe- 
males. In Dr Webfter's report the number was 1513. The 
number of children baptifed in 1790, was 32, of which 17 
■were males, and 1 9 females. The number of Seceders, 
young and old, may be fliated at 240. The annual mar- 
riages are eight at an average. 

Lakes, ^c. —This parilh is remarkable for its frefh water 
lakes. They are 15 in number 5 fome of a larger, and fome 

of 



ef Inchi 137 

of a lefs extent. They abound in pike, perch, carp, tench, 
roach, white and red trout •, and are frequented by a variety 
of water fowl, fuch as wild ducks, teals, widgeons, coots, and 
cormorants. Swans emigrate from Ireland, particularly in 
fevere winters, and continue on thefe lakes till fpring. The 
two lakes of Caftle-Kennedy are very fine pieces of water, 
in each of which there is an ifland. The lakes are nearly 
parallel ; the one a mile, and the other a mile and a half in 
length, and both in fome parts half a mile broad* 

Cajlle. — Caftle-Kennedy is a large fquare building; and 
was burnt by accident in I7IS nor has it ever fince been re- 
built. The walls of the ruin ftiU ftanding are 70 feet in 
height. 

Church. — The manfe is called Soul feat, Sedes anmarum, and 
is almoft furrounded by a loch nearly fimilar in form to a 
horfe flhoe. The King is Patron of this parifli. The hving 
is 48 bolls of meal, i6 of bear, Linlithgow meafure, and 
L. 45 in money, with a manfe and glebe. 

Villages and Antiquities, — The Cairn Is the only ccrifider- 
able village in the parifli, and contains 130 fouls. It is fitu- 
ated on the fide of Lochryan, a piece of water, and has an 
excellent harbour from three to eight fathoms deep at low- 
water. Here many veflels from the W eft Indies, bound for 
Clyde, take refuge from the ftorrn, and ride in perfect /afety. 
The Cairn is well fituated for foreign trsJe, and excellently 
adapted for fhip-building. Below the village, towards Ayr- 
fhire, there is a bold rocky fhore, where there are feveral 
caves, extending 80 and 100 yards under ground. The 
cairns of Caii-narran exhibit an appearance truly fingular. 
In the extent of a Scots mile, there ate nine of them, of

which fix are very near one another, within lefs than an 
Englifh mile. Two circumftances render them very remark- 
able ; the vaft quantity of flones piled together, and the dif- 
tance whence thefe ftones muft have been carried ; as many of 
them are fituated in moffy ground, where not a fiingle ftone 
can be found. Where any of them has been entirely de- 
moliflied, urns have been found containing afhes and burnt 
bones. There are feveral moats in this parifh. A beautiful 
one ftill remains entire on the fide of Lochryan, in a farm 
called Innermefl"an, and commands a full view of the loch. 
It appears to be wholly formed of earth. At the bottom it 
meafures 336 feet round ; from the foundation to the top 
6b feet; and the diameter at the top is 78 feet. It is a round 
figure, and plain at the top. 

Mineral Springs. — In the parifh of Inch there are feveral 
mineral fprings, A fulphur fpring has been lately difcover- 
ed, which is of confiderable ftrength, and faid to be ufeful 
in ftomachic and (corbutic complaints. There is alfo, in the 
neighbourhood of the Cairns already mentioned, a chaly- 
beate fpring, which pours forth a great quantity of water. 

Fuel. — The Inch is exceedingly well fupplied with peat. 
In the moors every tenant has abundance on his own farm. 
In the loper parts of the parifli there are a great many 
fwamps, and every fwamp is a mofs. There are alfo fome 
appearances of coal. A few years ago, Lord Stair employ- 
ed men, fuppofed to be competent judges, to explore the 
ground, but they were unfuccelsful in their'refearches. 

Poor. — There are eighteen perfons on the poor's lifl:, who 
are fupported chiefly by the weekly colleftion, and an an- 
tiual gratuity given by the Earl of Stair. This parifii is both 

able

able and willing to provide for its own poor •, but the 
people are greatly opprefled by inundations of poor vagrants 
from Ireland. The great road from Portpatrick to Dum- 
fries, palTes through this parifh, and is conftantly fwarming 
with Irifli beggars. They turn afide into the country, and, 
either by entreaties or by threats, extort alms from the in- 
habitants. They often go in crowds together, accompanied 
generally with a number of young children. They may be 
divided into two clafles. The firft are thofe whofc only ob- 
je£l is to beg their bread. The fecond are thofe called 
i^sggers^ who carry on a fpecies of traffic, unknown, I am 
perfuaded, in moft places. They bring linen from Ireland, 
which they barter for the old woollen clothes of Scotland, 
and thefe they prefer to gold or filver. Bending under bur- 
dens of thefe clothes, they return to their own kingdom. 

CharaEler of the Inhabitatits .—Thty are in general fober, 
intelligent, focial, and hofpitable. Their knowledge of agri- 
culture, for thefe laft twenty years, is much enlarged, and 
their habits of life much improved. 

Difeafesy Ss^f.— The parifli is fituared between Lochryan 
and the bay of Luce, and enjoys a niild and healthy climate. 
Epidemical diftempers are feidom known here ; rheumatifms, 
however, are frequent. But, upon the whole, the inhabi- 
tants enjoy much health, and live to a good old age. There 
are about 30 perfons in the parifli above 80 years of age, two 
95, and one who fays he is 105. 

i^mV^r/. -There are feven heritors in the parifli, of 
whom the Earl of Stair is the only refiding one.

County of Dumfries* ) 

By the Rev. Mr Joseph Kirkpatrick.</head> 



<p>Situaiton, Extent, and Surface. 

THIS parifh is Ctuated in the county, prefbytery, and 
fynod of Dumfries. From the river Nith, which 
interfe£ls"it in one place in the lower end, it extends acrofs 
the country to the river Urr, which runs along the upper 
end. The river Cairn runs through it near the middle ; and, 
a little below, receives the name of Cluden River. The pa- 
rifh is very narrow at the middle ; and, turning wider at 
both ends, nearly refembles a fand-glafs. It is about 12 miles 
long. In fome parts it is 4, in fome 3, in fome 2 miles 
broad ; and^ in one part, only a few yards, being nearly in- 
terfered by the pariflies of Glencairn and Holywood. It is 
partly muir, and partly dale. It is very flat alongft the 
river Nith -, but, in general, it is hilly, and, in the upper 
end, rocky and mountainous. The tops of the hills are ge- 
nerally covered with heath. A pretty high hill, called Halli- 
day-hill, lying in the lower end of the parifh, is mofily co- 
vered with green paflure Of late, much progrefs has been 
made in improving the lower hills by lime and tillage •, but 
the high multures, to which a great part of the panfli is fub- 
^- jefted^ 



oj Dun/core* 



jelled, are a very great difcouragement to improvements in 
agriculture. 

Soil. — Some parts of the foil are deep and fertile; but 
much more of it is light and fliallow, lying upon a tilly bed. 
The fides of the hills, facing the north, feem to be generally 
of a more deep and ftrong foil, than thofe of a fouthern ex- 
pofure. 

Di/eafes. — Fevers and rheumatifms feem to be the mofl; 
prevailing difeafes, and are often occafioned by the people 
expofing themlelves to variable weather ; or, when warmed 
with their labour, by fuffering themfelves to cool luddenly, 
by keeping on wet clothes, and by living poorly, and in 
damp houfes. 

Population — The number of fouls, at prefent in the parifh, 
is about 913. In pr Webfter's Report, the number is 
651.

as either farm the whole or a part of their eftates ; 2 fliep- 
hcrds ; 6 blackfmiths ; 7 joiners ; 1 1 mafons ; 7 ihoema- 
kers ; 19 weavers; 6 taylors ; 5 niillers ; and i elcck and 
watchiiialcer". Of late, the number of inhabitants is confi- 
derably increafed, which may be owing to the farms being 
made imaller, and the improvement of the land by lime from, 
Cloleburn and Barjarg. James Grierfon, illq; of Dalgoner 
has alfo, of late years, granted a number of feus, which have 
greatly augmented the number of inhabitants upon his e-f 
ftate. The mhabited houles are 224 \ five perfons iu each 
houie may be nearly the average. 

Cattle and JJieep — The number of black cattle is nearly 
1300 ; the number of Iheep 3480 ; and the number of horfcs 
218. The black cattle, in general, are of the Galloway 
breed ; but Mr Robert Burns, a gentleman well known by 
his poetical produdtions, who rents a farm in this parifii, is 
of opinion, that the weft country cows give a larger quantity 
of milk.

and Hax are not much cultivated, though more has been 
raifed of late than formerly ; nnd, in the courfe of the en- 
fuing feafon, a flax mill is to be ereded on the river Cairn, 
Oats are fown in March and April, and reaped in Septem- 
ber and Oftobcr. Barley is fown in the beginning of May, 
There nre about 72 ploughs in the parifh, and chiefly of the 
Scottiih kind. 

Church. — The money and viftual Itipend that fhould be 
paid annually is L. 48 : 12 : 2i. The glebe was valued, 25 
years ago, at L. 6 : i : 9 Sterling j but it has been much im- 
proved of late, and would now let for L. 20 Sterling. In 
1649, the church was removed from the lower eijd of the 
parifh to near the middle of it, where it now ftands. 

School. — There is no legal falary for a Ichoolmafter in this 
parifh. A Mr Grierfon of Ldinburgh, a good many years 
ago, left L. 300 for the ufe of a Ichool in this parifh. The 
heritors were nominated truftees for managing it j and, 
about 30 years ago, they divided the annual rent of faid 
L. 300 amongft three Ichoolmafters, in the following propor- 
tions. To the fchoolmafler in the upper end of the parifh, 
they allotted L 6 : 10 : o i to one in the middle of the parifh, 
L. 2 ; to one in the lower end of the parifh, L. 6 : 10:0. 
Between 20 and 30 fcholars attend the fchool at the upper 
end i:f the parilh ; between 30 and 40 attend the fchool in 
the middle ot the parifli ; about 37 attend the fchool in the 
lower end of the parilh. i s. and 2d. a quarter is the

refide in it. 

Poor. — In the year 1738, the names of ten perfons were 
in the poor's lift i in 1756, eleven. About four years ago, 
twenty perlbns got fupply from the poor's funds ; but, at 
preient., there are only ten in the poor's roll. The funds 
for the poor are about L. 23 Sterling ; of which L. 15 arife 
from the coUeftions in the church, and the reft from the in- 
tereft of legacies.

the lower end of the parifli, moft of the proprietors have 
mofs in their own eftates. Thofe who have them to pur- 
chafe pay for the liberty of cafting them. 

Antiquities, — The church being removed to the middle of 
the parifti in the year 1 649, the veftiges of the old one ftill 
remain. Upon the top of a hill called Meikleiuood-muir are 
the walls of a houfe which are ftill named the Preaching 
•walls. There are alfo veftiges of a chapel and burying place 
in the upper end of the parifti j the farm ftill retains the 
name of Chapel. The burying place is not tilled. Upon 
one corner of it grew a large yew-tree, which was confumed 
in the heart. Three men have ftood in it at once 3 but it

<p>Name, Situai'wti, and Boundariesi 

rnpiHE narne is derived from the Gaelic, and Is expreflive 
X of its natural fituation, Lug fignifying a hollow or lonv 
place. Though this pariOi is one of the higheft in Scotland 
•with regard to its elevation above the fea, there are in it ma- 
ny glens and narrow valleys. It lies in the fouthern extre- 
mity of Invernefs-fliire, prefbytery of Abertarph, and fynod 
of Gleneig, extending, from north-eaft to fouth-weft, up- 
wards of 2o miles. The breadth of the inhabited part is a- 
bout 3 miles ; but, taking its boundaries fouth and north, it 
will meafure more than 20 miles. It is bounded on the' 
north by Momt-liec^ or Grey Mou/Uain, a prodigious ridge of 
inacceflible rocks^ 

Rivers, Lakes, and Woods .—-th&amp; river Spey takes its rife 
from a very fmall lake of the fame name in the vveftern parts 
of the parifh, and is formed by currents falling do\vn from 
the mountains. It runs through the middle of the parifh ; 
its courfe is from weft to eaft, inclining a little to the north. 
In its progrefs, befides many rivulets, it receives the river

Mafie about the middle of the pariHi, and the river Trulme^ 
at the eaftei-n extremity. Both thefe rivers fall into it from- 
the fouth, and have their rife in the Grampians. Loch-lag- 
gan, which, with its environs, forms a diftrict by itfelf, lies 
on the fouth weft extremity of the parifli. It is very deep, 
with a bold rocky fhore ; and it is furrounded with woody 
mountains. On the fouth fide is the Co/// More^ or Great 
Woody the moft confiderable remain of the great Caledo- 
nian Foreft. This wood, which extends five miles along, 
the loch fide, is the fccne of many traditions. At the eafl: 
end of the lake, the l-iver Pattack, which Is formed by a lake 
ot the fame name, falls into Loch-laggan, which runs from 
eaft to weft, and difcharges itfelf by the Spean river into 
Loch-lochy, near Fort William. - The rivers Mafie and I'at- 
tack run almoft parallel to one another. They are about 
two miles diftant. The former goes by the Spey into the 
German Ocean ; the latter into the Weftern Sea. There arc 
fome other fmallcr lochs, as Loch n'Righ, or the Kin^s Loch, 
remarkable for large black trout, very fat and high flavour- 
ed. Loch laggan abounds with char, and various kinds o£ 
trout. In the Spey, there are fome falmon, with plenty of 
fine trout and pike, of a large fize. 

AW^ Soli, and Climaie.— The air is moift, and generally vc- 
ry cold j yet, fo purified by ftorms, and kept in motion by 
rapid currents, that it is, upon the whole, clear and healthy. 
Along the banks of the river is a very rich and deep foil 
which, were it not for the difadvantages of inundations, 
frofts, and mildews, would produce as rich crops as any in 
the kingdom. The lands that lie in Hopes and declivities, 
without the water-mark, are, though ftoney, of a good qua- 
lity, and produce furer crops than ^the rich meadows, being 
earlier ripened, by the refleaion of the fun from the adja- 
cent

cent rocks. The lands on Loch-laggan fide, though higher, 
and lying in a ftill wetter climate than that of the valley in 
the center of the parifli, yield a furer crop, being lefs liable 
:to frofts and mildews, owing to their lying on a ftratum of 
iilme. The climate here is very variable ; every two or three 
miles makes a fenfible difference; and it rains on the one 
iide of the river, when it is dry on the other. :It is the high- 
eft and moft inland parifli ir. Scotland. 

Produce.— m\xQ vegetable produce is oSt^ and barky, rye, 
r-and potatoes. The ground on the river fide, if allowed to 
remain out of culture 3 years, yields excellent crops of black 
and white oats, without any manure. When prepared for 
barley, it requires a very great quantity of compoft manure. 
The number of black cattle in the parilh may probably be 
computed at about 1600. The ground is laboured by hor- 
Tes, generally of the country- breed, 'Of a middling fize, and 
very hardy. In ;Former times, it was ufual to vfend many of 
them to market ; but nowthc parifla hardly railes a fufficient 
number for labouring the ground, owing to the introdudlion 
of fheep, and confequentiy the advanced value of hill-grafs. 
The average quantity of meal made in the parifli, in ordi- 
nary good years, is 2450 boils; but the crop of 3782 did 
not exceed 850 bolls. The ilieep-farms in this parilh are 
not above four or five. Thcfe Iheep-farnis at present fup- 
port about 12,000. The other farms, on which there are a 
mixture of black cattle, fheep, and hories, will not fupport 
above 2000 fteep. In whole, there are about 20,000 Ihecp 
in the parifli. People in general judge it more profitable to 
reduce their number of black cattle, and, as much as pof. 
fible, to increafc their flieep. The beft and largefl: wedders 
•fell from 12 to 15 or 16 s. ; and an ordinary weddcr, of the

Improvements — Farmers have at laft found out the advan- 
tage of inclofures, and the comfort of good habitations ; for 
which the proprietors are difpofed to make a reafonable al- 
lowance. At the end of a leafe, the tenant is allowed melio- 
ration-money, for dykes, dwelling-houfes, and offices, to their 
full extent, ' 

Rent of the Pari/Jjy and Proprietors. — Thtrt are only two

The yearly average of baptifms and marriages, from the 
above abftraft, will be about. 40 baptifms and 9 marriages, 
"But, as there are 250 Catholics in the parifh, which is a 6th 
of the whole, the average may be laid proportionally higher. 

Shiality of Farmers — The parifh is let to three defcrip- 
tions of people. Gentlemen farmers, confifting of half-pay 
officers and graziers, chiefly thofe who are profefledly fhep- 
herds j and the lower clafs of people, who pay from L, ^ to 
J^. 6, yearly rent, which arc the more numerous clafs. The 
gentlemen pay from L. 30 to L. 100 Sterling. Sheep-farms 
pay from L.60 to L. 190, yearly rents. Farms in general 
feem to be on the rife, from the numerous and advanced of- 
fers that are made for every farm which is out of leafe, as the 
fame kind of fheep-farms only feem capable of bearing any 
confiderable advance of rent. The value of fuch ground as 
is calculared for rearing Iheep does not feem yet to be fully 
underftood 5 but people in general entertain a high idea of 

its

its value. A farm which, about 12 years ago, paid only L. 39 
rent to the Commifliorjers of the Annexed Eftates, has 
been fince let by the holder of it to an Airfhirc fticpherd 
at L. 190, and it is ftill thought a good bargaii^. The Duke 
of Gordoa, has not as yet (hewn any great difpoGtion to let 
his lands to fhepherds j that nobleman is attached to his 
|3eopIe, and fond of nouriftiing ?ind rearing them. 

Churchy Sti^ndy Patrotiy l^c. — In the year 1785, there 
^was a commodious church built, in the centre of the parifli, 
at a very confiderable expence. The glebe at prefent lets 
at near L, 12 Sterling. The Duke of ,Qordon is patron of the 
parifh. The minifter lives near the church, upon a com- 
modious farm ; and the heritors allow him L. 20 Sterling, 
in lieu of a manfe, till one is built. TJie money ftipend is 
JL. 7® Sterling. 

Schools. — In the middle .pf .the parifh ftands the parochial 
fchool, and fchoolmaftcr's houfe, under one roof, both fuffi.- 
jciently commodious. The heritors allow the I'choohuafter 
J 500 merks of falary. The number of fcholars attending 
this fchool are from 50 to 80, and fometimes more. In tlwj 
weftern parts of the parifli are two Society fchools ; one upoji 
«he Duke of CJordon's eftate, and the other upon the eltate 
pf Cluny. 

Servants and Labourers. — Our bufinefs is managed and car-

A-uifff. — At the eaft end of Eoch-Iaggan ftarid the remaihs 
of an old church dedicated to St Kenneth. The greatefi: 
part of the walls of that venerable edifice are ftill ftanding,- 
It is furrounded by a ^onfecrated burying ground, which is 
ft HI more ufed than any other. In the middle of the 
Coill More, a great wood on the fouth fide of the lociv 
is a place called j^rjl Merigicy or the height on which 
a ftandard was wont to be erefted. Here is a place held fa- 
crcd by the moft remote antiquity, and faid to be the burial- 
place of feven kings of the antient Caledonians. It fliould 
appear, from popular tradition, that thofe kings, or eminent 
warriors, lived about the period when the Scots were driven 
by the Pi£ls beyond the Tay, and had their feat of govern* 
ment at Dunkeld. It likewife appears, that of old this was' 
a famous place for hunting ; and indeed it continued to a- 
bound in deer and roes till very lately, that the introduction 
of fheep, with which thefe animals never mingle, has driven 
them away. It is faid that the kings came always, with their 
retinue and hounds, to hunt, for the mofl: part of the fum- 
mer, on the banks of this loch, and in the neighbourhood. 

This

This is rendered the more probable, from the vicinity of the 
parallel roads in Glenroy, already made known to the public, 
which were evidently calculated for the purpofes of huntings 
and muft have been made by fome perfons of more power and 
confequence, than any ufually refiding in this country. In the 
middle of the loch are two iflands, one of them much lefs than 
the other. On the larger, are the fide-walls ftill remaining 
of a very antient building, made of common round ftones, but 
cemented with mortar. This is faid to be the place where 
the kings retired from hunting, and feafted on their game. 
In the neighbouring ifland, which is called Elian «' Cone, or, 
27»f 1/land of Dogs, and faid to be the place where their 
hounds were confined, is alfo a wall fl:anding of a fimilar 
building. In the n*iddie of the parifh, there is a rock, which 
is upwards of loo yards perpendicular, and very difiicult of 
accefs ; yet, on the very fummit, there are confiderable re- 
mains of a fortification. The wall is built, outfide and in- 
fide, with large flags, or broad ftones, without mortar. It is 
upwards of three yards in thicknefs. The area will meafure 
500 feet in length, and 250 in breadth.

UNITED PARISHES of <name ref="NA">BONKLE and PRESTON</name>. 

(County of Berwick.) 
By the Rev. Mr Robert Dougj.**.</head> 



<p>NamCy Situation,, Bxient^ 

THE parifhes of Bonkle and Prefton, were originally 
two feparate parifhes, but are now united. Bonkle 
is fuppofed to be derived from bona cella. It lies in the 
county of Berwick, prcfbytery of Dunfe, and fynod of 
Kelfo. It is nearly a fquare of fix miles, and contains 8,900 
acres. 

ZoiU — In the high lands towards the Lammermoor hills^ 
the foil is thin, dry, heathy, and poor ; but it has of late 
been much inaproved by lime. The reft of the parifh, and 
particularly on the banks of the Whittater, confifts of a fine 
fertile loam. 

Air and Difeafvs. — As in moft parts of the caft of Scot- 
land, the air is very healthy. Formerly the people were 
very fubje£l: to agues in the fpring ; but fince improvements 
have commenced, and been carried to, a very confiderable 
ftate of perfeftion, this difeafe has almoft totally difappeared. 
This efFe£t is attributed to the bogs and fwaprips being drain- 
ed, and to the improvement of the furface, .

^/arries — There is whin Hone in different parts, and 
good free Aone quarries upon the banks of Whittater, both 
very fit for building houl'es, and Inclofing ground. 

Minerals. — A copper mine was difcovered in ]j0rd Dou- 
glas's eftate, at a fniall farm called Hoardweel. It was 
wrought about twelve years ago, by an Engllfli company^ 
and had a very promifing appearqrjce, the ore being very 
rich ; but, altliough the vein continued, it ceafed to bear 
metal, and was abandoned. It is tlipught the trials madt^ 
to recover it vyere not fuIFicient. 

Land-Floods, — The river Whittater runs with great ra- 
pidity, and at foine places rifes 15 feet perpendicular above 
jts ordinary channel, overflowing the haughs and carrying 
pfF great part of the loil. Attempts have been made by fe- 
"teral heritors to make barricadoes, but few of them have 
been fuccefsful. A very great flood bappene4 in Oftobec 
X-'-- which carried down every bridge, excepting the bridge 
at Freflon, in this pariHi. They have fince been rebuilt at 
very conlidcrable expence. 

Cattle and Sheep The cattle bred in this and the neigh- 
bouring parilhcs, particularly in the diftria between this and 
j'weed, are confiderable in point of number, and as large as 
any bred in Scotland. But people of Ikill are of opinion, 
that they are not fo good as our land can rear, nor of a kind 
fhat fatten fpeedily. Some public fpirited gentlemen and 
farmers, have of late purchafed, at very high prices, fome 
fine bulls and cows, from the beft places, and beft breeders 
in England. They have not yet, hov/ever, become general. 
The bulls are let out to the country at two guineas. Sheep

iburity in gfeneral. They are the Englifli breed introduced 
by Mr Bakewell, and fince carried on by the Meflrs Culleys, 
and other eminent breeders, both in Northumberland, and 
this county. The criterion of their goodnels and fort, is 
gcttirig fooner and more cafily fat, than any other animal, 
bearing a valuable fleece, and enriching the land upon which 
they are fed. There are two different ages at which they 
are fold ; the firft when they arc about 1 8 months old, after 
the firft fleece is taken off, when they are called dunmotts^ at 
which time they ufually fell from 24s. to 34s. The fecond 
time is after their fecond fleece is taken off, when they are 
called ivedders of the firjl heady and are 28 months old, when 
they fell from 32 s. to 38s. each. The fleece weighs from 
feven to eight pounds each, and fells from 4 s. 6d. to 5 s. 
The ewes are kept for breeders, and are fold, after having 
three lambs, from 24 s. to 34s. Thefe fheep are bought by 
dealers, and driven to Morpeth market, where they are again 
fold, and killed at Newcaftle, Shields, and Sunderland, for 
the ufe of the coallieries and fhipping ; and many are driven 
to Yorkftiire, and farther fouth. The wool i$ fold to agents 
from Leeds, and other manufadluring towns in Yorkfhire ; 
fome Is fliipped at Berwick for Aberdeenfhire, and a fmall 
quantity fent to Edinburgh and Stirling. The beft paf^ 
tures are appropriated for feeding fheep in fummer, and 
they are moftly fed for five months in winter, upon turnip, 
of which very large quantities are raifed. An acre of good 
pafture, value a guinea, will fatten three ; and the average 
expence of turnip is 3 d. per week, each fheep, when fed to 
the higheft extent, vvhich for the winter five months is 5 s. 
each. It is computed that two ewes rear three lambs. High 
prices are paid for the hire of rains of good breeds, viz. 
from 10 to 30 guineas Is common per feafon. Some have 
paid double or more for the feafon of the beft bred rams. 

Each 



156 



Stailjlical Ac'cou?^ 



Each ram will impregnate from five to fix fcore of ewes^. It la 
a certain fadl, that no animal follows the properties of the 
male fo much as Iheep ; and therefore, the breeder is fcl- 
dom difappointed. The higheft breed alfo bear the finefV 
Wool', though not always the greateft quantity. Our farmers 
pay as much attention to the breed of their flieep, as is paid 
to the higheft breed of galloping horfes in England i and I 
believe they bring much greater profit. 

j/igrkulture.~h'5 fbon as the crop Is ofF the ground, and 
fometimes before the fhocks arc removed, they begin to 
plough. They fow peafe as early as the feafon will permit j 
after that cats, atid then barley ; and laftly turnip, which 
commonly begins in the laft week of May, and finifties by 
the firfir of July. They begin to reap in the laft week of 
Auguft, and generally fin-ilh in the firft week of October. 

Mark and Lime, — There is a great quantity of clay marlc 
along the banks of the Whittater. It was formerly ufed as 
a manure to great advantage, and pofleffed at an average, 
two-fifths of calcareous matter ; but its operations are very 
flow, though lafting. The obligations in the tenants leafes^ 
in regard to the rotation of crops, and the obligation of hav- 
ing fo great a quantity in graft, at leaft for the laft 10 years 
of a 2 1 year's leafe, have induced the farmers to prefer lime 
as a quick manure, though they are obliged to drive it 15 
miles. Marie for raifing crops of corn will laft fix times 
longer than lime. 

Poor. — The poor in this parifli, as well as every other in 
this eounty, are maintained by an afleftment laid on by 
the heritors themfelves, according to their feveral valued 
rents, one half of which is paid by the heritors, and the 

Other 



of Bonhle and Prejlon. j^j 

other half by the tenants. There are no legacies, and tho 
colleftions are inconfiderable. There are no begging poor 
allowed in this county. Two conftables are appointed with 
falaries, whofe bufinefs is to go through the county, to at- 
tend fairs, markets, and public meetings, and take up all 
gypfies, tinkers, beggars, and diforderly perfons, who cannot 
give a proper account of themfelves. They are carried be- 
fore the neareft juftice of peace, who commits- them to the 
county jail for fome days ; they are then condudled to the 
extremity of the county, neareft their own refpedlive pa- 
rifhes ; and befides the falary, the conftables have gd. per 
mile, for carrying them to jail, which expence h paid out of 
the rogue money. By this in-ftitution the county is kept free 
from beggars ; and very few petty thefts are committed, as 
people of that defeription have canneilions together, and 
know they can fcarcely efcapc. 

Fuel. — Before the introduf^ion of improvements, the far- 
mers, &amp;£. burned turf, which were principally taken from 
the Lammermoor hills. But, fmce improvements commen- 
ced, and the people knew the value of their labour, nothing, 
but coal is ufed. It is all brought from Northumberland, at 
a diftance of 15 miles, through very bad roads; and confe- 
quently driven in fummer, when the Tweed is fordable. 

Ploughs — There are about 50 plouglis In the parifh. 
They are all chain ploughs, and are drawn by two horfes, 
without a driver. 

Roads. — The roads and bridges in this parifli are better 
than in moft parts of this county, owing to its not being a 
great thoroughfare, to the vicinity of materials, and to the 
attention to having the ftatute labour properly applied. The 

roads 



Siaii/H-cat Account 



l-oads, in the greateft and beft parts of the county, are bad 
beyond expreffion, and are a reproach to this rich and thriv- 
ing diftrift. 

Farmsy l35'c — The farms in this paridi are from L. 20o to 
L. 600 a year. Thete are but few faiall farms. The whole 
parifh under the Lammermoor hills, as well as the whole 
low parts of the couilty, are inclofed, principally with hedge 
and ditch. 



Population. — There has never been any record kept of the 
population of this parifli. Since the practice of letting large 
farms, this parifli has decreafed confiderably in point of 
numbers of the people. From an exadl ftatc of the popula- 
tion, taken November 1 790, it ftands thus : 



Number of families - 131

UNITED PARISHES OF <name ref="NA">LOCHGOIL-HEAD 
AND KILMORICH</name>. 

{County of Argyle.) 

the Rev, Mr DuGAL M'DouGAL.</head> 

<p>Name, 

THE old name of this parifli was KU nam hrathaim- 
Killy which, in the Gaelic language, fignifies, a fpot of 
ground upon which a church or chapel was built. The ground 
within the chapel, and adjacent, was employed as a burying- 
place, and ufually dedicated to the memory of fome favour- 
ite faint. Kil is fuppofed to be derived from the Latin cella ; 
hrathair means a brother ; and Kilnam brathairan, the houfe 
and facred ground of the brethren ; from which it appears, that 
Lochgoil-head was once the refidence of fome religious order 
or fraternity ; but no tradition exifts with regard to the na- 
ture of the eftablifhment. During the laft 200 years, the 
parifli has been generally known by the name of Lochgoil- 
head, from LochgoiU an arm of the fea ; at the head of which 
the church is fituated. 

Hifory. — The parifli of Lochgoil-head, of old, was very 
extcnfive, and comprehended not only Kilmorich, but alfo 
the greateft part of Kilmaglafs, now called Strachur. In the 
times of Popery, and of Prelacy, Lochgoil-head was an arch- 
dcanpry j and, not only the revenues of Lochgoil-head itfelf, 

which

«.-hich were then very confidenible, but part of the tithes of 
■ieyeral other pariflies, contributed to I'upport the dignity of 
the arcli-dean. The reformation of religion in Scotland, 
however neceflary and beneficial in general, was produdtive 
■ of one evil, which could not readily be fuppofed to refuli; 
iVona fuch a revolution. At that aera, at leaft two thirds of 
the pla;es formerly eftablilhed for public worlhip were (up- 
prellcd. Under the church of ,R.oaie, the people, every 
where, had eafy accefs to the places where they were to per- 
form their devotions, and to receive religious inrtruftion. But, 
after the Reformation, owing to the fcarcity of the Proteftanc 
.preachers, and to the avarice of the Reformers, (particularly 
the laymen who condudled that revolution), lo tew .places 
of worfliip were perniitted, and thefe coniequently fb di- 
jflant from one another, and To divided by mountains, rivers, 
and arms of the fea, as to render it extremely difiicult, and 
fometimes impoffible, for the miuilfers to .perform the duties 
of their office, or for the people to attend on their in- 
flrudlions. This was particularly the cafe in the province of 
Argyle. In order to remedy thefe inconveniencies, an adt of 
parliament palled, atiti.o 1649, en^powering certain perfons to 
disjoin the old, and to eredl new, pariflies in that province. 
In confeqtience of thefe powers, the cot^imiflioners difmem- 
bered the old pariSi of Lochgoil-head, and formed it into 
three feparate and independent cures. One of thele in thcr 
prelent parifh of Strachur; Kilmorich -was another; and the 
ijiother church made the third, which, fFOni its ficuation, 
retained the old nanie. 

Situation and Extent.— This parifli is Ctuatcd In the county 
and fynod of Argyll, and in the prcfbytery of Dunoon. It ' 
is about 30 miles long, and from 6 to 20 miles broad. This 
is exclufive of a diflria belonging to it of 5- miles in length, 
•which is annexed; ciuoad farra, to the pariQi of Inveraray.

Figure and Surface.— Of the figure of this parifh it is im- 
poflible to give any adequate defcription, as it is interfcftecj- 
by three arms of the fea, divided by mountains, and indent- 
ed by creeks and promontories. The eaft part of it is fitua- 
fed on the weft ward of Loch- long, an arm of the fea, \vhich 
llrikes off fi-om the Frith of dlyde, at firft in a north, 
and afterwards in a nor;h-eaft direction, and feparates the 
counties of Argyle and Dumbarton. It is about 24 miles in 
length ; but the parifli of LochgoiLhead occupies no more 
than 1 2 miles of its coaft. Lachgoil is a fmall ^rm of the 
fea, which ftrikes off from Lochlong, in a north-weft direc- 
tion, and interfc6ls the fouth divifion of the parifh for 6 
miles. The north-weft part of the parifh is divided in the 
iame manner by Lochfine. Upon the weft fide of Loch- 
long, and upon both fides of Lochgoil, the coaft is bold and 
jfteep, and the hills high and craggy. The fliore, upon both 
fides of Loch fine, as far as this parifh extends, is more flat 
arid acceffible ; the land is very high, but not fo rocky or 
fteep. The barrennefs of the ground along the coafts of 
Loch-goil and Loch-long is partly concealed j and the tre- 
jiienduous wildnefs of the fcene, agreeably diyerfified by ex- 
tenfive natural woods, which cover the land near the coaft, 
and rife to a confiderable diftance from the fliore. To a 
perfon who is rowed up Loch-goil in a calm fummer day, and 
who is not accufiomed to fee tli^ ftrong features of nature,, 
which prevail in this country, the appearance of the objed^ ■ 
around him, muft be uncommonly ftriking. The furface of 
the country in general is very unequal ; fome of the moun- 
tains, v/hich form the weftern extremity of the Grampian 
hills, are fituared in this parifli. Particularly, Bein una, 
i'o called from the richnefs of its grafs ; Bein-an-locham, from 
she frefh water lake which waflies its bafe ; Bein luibhain, a- 
nding in herbs •, Bein thiolaire^ remarkable for its fprings

amd watef-crefles ; and Bern Donlchy called after a faint 
df that name. Thefe, and fome other hills in this parifli, 
rife to a great height. Their altitude has never been exactly 
afcertained ; but^ if we rriay judge from their appearance, and 
from the experience of thofe who frequently afcend them, 
none of them is much lower, aiid fome of them are rather 
higher, than Bein-lsmnieti, the height of which is well known. 
Some of thefe mountaitis are interfperfed with huge rocks, 
caverns, and frightful precipices in others, fcarce a rock is 
to be feen. Till of late, they were covered with black 
heath ; but, fince they have been chiefly paftured with fheep, 
they begin to exhibit the pleafing appearance of verdure ; 
and fome of them are already green to the very tops. The 
low lands and valleys form a delightful variety in the 
furface of this parifli. After furveying extenflve wilds, and 
barren rocks, which prefcnt nothing but defolation and foli- 
tude, the eye is greatly refreflied, by the appearance of fmall 
cultivated fpots of plain ground, upon the coaft, and in the 
valleys, which bring back the pleafing ideas of Ihelter, of in- 
duftry, and of population. 

Soily and Climate — The foil in the hills is, for the mofl 
part, thin, dry, and firm to the tread of cattle. The high 
glens are generally wet arid fpungy, and, in fome places, a- 
bound with deep mofs. The land, upon the coaft, is lights 
fharp, and fandy •, and fome of the low valleys are rich and 
fertile. The face of the heavens is generally louring and 
cloudy ; a ferene Iky is feldom to be feen. The tops of the 
mountains are moft frequently covered with clouds, and, du- 
ring winter, with fnow. The rain is heavy, and frequent] 
The winds, prevented from a free circulation, rufli through

Stailfiical Account 



high hills, and in narrow valleys, the tranlulons of heat and' 
cold are fudden and exceflive. 

Difiaps. — Notwithftanding the moid: and changeable na- 
ture of the climate, the people, in general, enjoy good 
health, and very few difeafes are known among them. The 
conflant, but moderate exerciffe, which is necefiary for fhep- 
herds, and the Tea air enjoyed by filhers, are favourable to 
health. To thefe' circumftances it may be added, that the 
people are- not crouded together in towns or villages, every 
family having a- complete, and, in general, a comfortable ha- 
bitation for itfelf. The difeafe, of which the people chielly 
complain, is the rheumatifm, owing to the inoifture of the 
climate, and to their manner of living, which expofes them 
daily to the changes of the weather. Extraordinary inftan- 
ces of longevity cannot be boafled of. There are, however, 
at prefent, in the pariflij \6 perfons above 80, and 4 of thefe 
above 90 years of age. I'here is one man, in particular, 
who is 93 ; and who not only enjoys health, and the exer- 
cife of his mental faculties, but alfo ftrength fuiEcient to 
drefs his Uttle garden and potatoe ground. 

M'wcs atid Minerals. — The rocks and ftones in this coun- 
try are chiefly moor-ftone, and fpar. Thefe two fubftan- 
ces are fometimes found" feparate, but are moft frequently 
conjoined in the fame mafs. Spar is found in a great variety 
of forms ; in fome, it is traniparent and pure ; in others, it 
is of a marble hue ; and it finks, in fome, to a mere earthy 
appearance. There is alfo fome granite ; but this fubftance- 
ifi not found in any great quantities. There are feveral quar- 
ries of lime-ftone ; but, owing to the badnefs of the roads, 
and the difficulty of communication between the different 
parts of the parifli, they are of no fervice, except to the 

people 



of Lochgoil- head and Kihnorkh. 165 

jieople who live in the immediate neighbourhood. In gene- 
ral, it is found cheaper to bring lime-ftone from Ireland ; 
but the quantity of lime ufed in this country is very incon- 
fiderable. There is a lead mine near the head of Loch-fine, 
but it has never been wrought. Some years ago, a company,, 
who were concerned in lead- mines in other parts of Argyle- 
fliire, fent perfons to open up and examine the place, in this 
parifh, where the lead was fuppofed to exift. Thefe perfons 
found, that there was a lead mine, and carried away fome of 
the ore ; which, upon trial, was found to contain a greater 
proportion of filvep than any lead ore in the weft of Scot- 
land. The company were upon terms with the proprietor 
for a leafe of the mines, but no bargain was concluded. 

Caves. — Among the rocks in this parifli, there are a great 
number of natural caves, vaults, and grottos, of different 
forms and dimenfions. One of thefe caves is fituated a little 
below a very high and tremendous rock, from which a 
great number of fmaller rocks fecm to have been torn, either 
by lightening, or by fome convuKion of the earth ; probably 
by the former, as lightening produced a fimilar effeft, a fevsr 
years ago, in another part of the country. Among thefe 
fmaller rocks is the cave already mentioned. The entry to 
it is in the form of an arch, about 4 feet high, and 3 broad. 
The cave itfelf is very fpacious, of a circular figure, but not 
perfedlly regular. It is more than 70 feet in circumference, 
and about i o feet in height. All around the cave there are 
fmaller vaults, refembling cellars ; and, from one part of it, 
a narrow palTage leads to a fmall apartment, not unlike a 
fleeping chamber. The cave is covered above by a great 
number of large rocks, which appear to have been thrown 
upon one another without any order or regularity; within, it 
is perfectly dry, but rather dark, having no light but what

it receives through the pafTage already mentioned. TKi^i 
cave is remarkable for having been the fanfluary of one of 
the lairds of Ardkinglafs j who, according to the tradition 
of the country, having been defeated and opprefled by fomc 
powerful neighbour, was obliged to conceal himfelf, and a 
few folio wers, in this cave for a whole year ; during which 
time his vaflals and tenants found means to fupply him 
with provifioris fo fecretly, that his retreat was not difcover- 
ed by the enemy. It is called, from this incident, Uamh 
mhei Saifi Reoich *. But the moft remarkable of all the nu- 
merous caves in this country, is one which is called Uamh 
na plundarain. In the face of a fteep hill there is a fmall 
area between two rocks. At the bottom of this area is a 
fmall opening, the mouth of which is covered, and concealed 
from the eye by thick heath and ferns; This narrow and 
troublefome palTage, through which a perfon of an ordinary 
fize is with great difficulty able to creep, is about 6 feet 
long, and leads to a fmall fubterraneous apartment, about 
lo feet long, 6 broad, and 8 high* Four feet above the 
bottom of this cave, is a fmall opening, between two rocks, 
which muft be afcended by a ladder j and which leads to a 
fecond apartiViCnt, about 15 feet long, 12 feet high, and of 
an irregular breadth. To this place it will be neceflary to 
bring a candle, or lanthorn, as it is perfectly dark. From this 
there is a narrow and rugged paflage to a third apartment, 
which is alfo dark. This place is about 24 feet in length, 1 5 
in breadth, and as many in height. The rocks all around 
are covered with petrified water. The bottom, which is alfo 
rock, is perfectly dry. Two large rocks meeting cover it a-i 
bove, exactly like the roof of 2 houfe. Beyond this, there is

another dark cave, nearly of the fame dimenfions with 
the firft. Thefe, and a great many other fubterraneous a- 
partments, in this pariih, were, in former times, often the 
refidence of a banditti, who committed depredations on thp 
neighbourhood. They were alfo of great fervice in prefer- 
ving the perfons, and the property, of the inhabitants, du- 
ring the deadly feuds, and predatory wars, which prevail- 
ed of old in this country. A few years before the Revolu- 
tion, the powerful famihes of Argyle and Athol were attach- 
ed to oppofite parties in the ftate ; in ^:onfequence of this, 
and prompted to revenge by the memory of former injuries, 
the vafTals of the latter made an irruption into Argyle-fliire, 
Upon that occafion, the inhabitants of this parifli retreated, 
with their wives, their children, and the moft valuable part 
of their portable effedls, to their caves, their ftrong-holds, 
and hiding places, from whence they furprifed the enemy in 
feveral fuccefsful fallies, but qould not prevent them from 
burning many houfes, nor from carrying away and deftroying 
much cattle. 

Antiquities. — There are three caftles in this parifti. The 
caftle of DiMiduramh * is a large and ftrong tower, of an 
irregular figure^ with fmall turrets above the angles in the 
wall j but, as it is built in a low fituation, it could only be 
a defence againft the curfory attacks of hoftile neighbours, 
or of thieves and robbers, who fought for plunder, and, 
when repulfed, fled away. Above the gate of the caftle i$ 
the following infcription : 

* Doniuramh^ the Fort of the iivo Oars. This caftle was built 
clpfe to the fca ; and, as the accefs to it by land was in thefe 
times very bad, the moft frequent communication would pro« 
bably be by boats.

The caftle of Ardkinglafs * is compofed of three feparate 
towers, each of them fronting an area within. 'I he fpace, 
between the towers, is defended by a ftrong wall, about 15 
■feet high. In the courfe of this wall is the great gate, which 
is defended by fmall round turrets in flank, with apertures, 
through which thofe who affailed the gate might be annoy- 
ed with arrows, or with fmall fire-arms. The gate is aUb 
defended by a fmall tower, immediately above it, called the 
j gate toiver. Around the area, and within the walls, are 
fmaller buildings, for lodging fervants, for holding arms, 
and for ftorehoufes and cellars. This caftic, is alfo built 
in a low fituation, and could not ftand out againfl: a regular 
inveftment. I'he time in which this caftle was built is not 
known ; but there is certain evidence of its having been re- 
paired in the year (586. The old refidence of the family of

ftrength, in this diltrift, is the caftle of Carrick *. This 
cafilei is built upon a rock, which -was formerly {'urroundcd 
by the fea, by means of a deep ditch. The entry to the 
calUe froni the lahd, was by a draw-bridge, which was de- 
fended by a ftrong wall, and tviro fmall towers. The callle 
itfelf, is of an oblong figure, but not perfectly regular, as the 
nrchitefts in laying the foundation, kept in fome places by 
the very edge of the rock ; it is C6 feet long, and 38 broad, 
over walls, the fide wall is 64 feet high, and 7 feet thick. 
Between the caftle and the fea, there is a part of the rock 
unoccupied, which was furrouhded by a high and ftrong 
wall, built found the edge of the rock, within this fpace 100 
men might conveniently ftand, for the defence of the caftle, 
if it was attacked by fea. Before the Invention of gun- 
powder, the caflle of Carrick could only be taken by fur- 
prife ; it was fcarcely poffible to ftorm it, nor could it be 
taken by blockade, as it had always a free communication 
with the fea, for a vefiel of any burden will fwim along the fide 
of the rock. The time in which this caftle was built, does 
not feem to be afcertained : It can be traced up as far as the 
end of the 15th century, but it is probably much older^ The 
tradition of the country is, that it was built by the Danes. 
It was a King's houfe, and the Duke of Argyle is heritable 
keeper of it. It was burnt by the Atholmen. Nothing now 
remains but the walls j and thefe are not entire. 

Woods. — In all the mofies in this country, even in thofe 
on the tops of the hills, trunks of tree? of various kinds are 
found, and there is no doubt that this country was once 
much covered with timber. Old people ftill remember fe- 
vernl extenfive woods, where there is not now the veftige of

a tree. The great obje^l:, for a long time, was to clear the- 
ground, and to prepare it for pafture and tillage ; but this- 
fyflem was carried too far: Timber has become fo fcarce, and 
fo valuable, that in a confiderable part of fuch a country as 
this, the woods yield- a greater profit than any thing elfe 
which the lands can produce. The natural woods, there- 
fore, arc now regularly cut, and preferved with care; and- 
there is a great number of trees planted yearly in different 
places. The natural woods conlifb of afli, alder, hazel, and 
birch, but nioflly oak j and there are feveral plantations,., 
(particularly a very extenfive one at the family place of Ard- 
kinglafs) of Scots and filver fir, larix, plain, beech, elm, and 
lime. The natural and planted timber in this parlfli, yields 
the proprietors of the land about L. 500 Sterling yearly ; if 
the woods were cut down, the ground which they occupy, 
even though perfcftly cleared, would not pay the half of 
that rent. 

ji^gricuUitre. — As this parilli was never meafured, it is im- 
poffible to afcertain the number of arable acres in it with 
any exaftnefs. It is believed, however, that the proportion 
of arable land to the reft of the parifli, is as one to fifty. 
There was more grain raifed in this country formerly than 
at prefent : The inhabitants of old were in ufe to delve, or 
dig the ground, a great way up the face of very fteep hills,, 
and the ridges can be traced at thi^ day ; at prefent, there is 
very little ground in tillage, but what is ploughed; and fuch 
is the inattention of the people to agriculture, and fo tena- 
cious are they of old cuftoms, that they continue to ufe the 
ftrong htavy Scots plough,, which requires two men and 
four horfes, though the ground, in general, is neither ftroiig 
nor fconey. Some of the tackfmen are beginning to ufe the 
liaht Englifli plough, by which they fave the expence of a 

man

man and two horfes. This country, however, is in every re- 
ypeft ill adapted for tillage ; there is very little land capable 
of being ploughed, little fan-diine to ripen, or dry weather to 
preferve the crops. The prefent lowing of this very extern- 
live parifii, is only 230 bolls of o ts, and 25 bolls of bear. 
The fmall quantity of grain that is fown, docs not yield good 
returns ; oats generally yield three feeds and a half, and bear 
from four to five feeds ; nor will the ground produce even 
thefe fcanty crops, without conftant manure. Oats are fown 
from the 5th to the 26th of April, and bear the fecond and 
third weeks of May. The harveft begins in September, and 
the crops are feldom completely fafe before the end of Odto- 
ber ; in wet feafons the harveft is ftill later. Potatoes are 
much cultivated, and they produce plentifully ; there are 
about 150 bolls planted annually. The hay harveft, how- 
ever, is the moft important, and occupies the attention, and 
the labour of the people, more or lefs, from the end of July 
to the end of Odtober. 

Fip. — There are in this parifh two fmall water lakes, 
which afford abundance of trout, of a fmall fize, but of a molt 
delicious tafle and flavour ; thefe trouts are killed with the rod, 
and take the hook readieft in the months of May and June. 
In the rivers Goil, Fine, and Long, there are burn trouts of dif- 
ferent fizes, and near the coaft, fea trout and Hilmon. Loch, 
fine, Loch-long, and Loch-goil, abound in great variety of 
excellent filh ; at all fealbns of the year, there are haddocks, 
whitings, and codlings ; they are killed either with the hand 
line, or with the long line. The haddocks in Loch-goil are 
more numerous, and of a larger fi2e, than in thofe parts of 
Loch-fine, and Loch-long, which belong to this pari/h. In 
confequence of the ready accefs from Loch-goil, and Loch-long,

able Turns of money might be made of this fifliing, and manjr 
hands might be employed, with great benefit to the country, 
and advantage to the inhabitants ; efpecially in the winter 
and fpring feafons, ^yhen frefli fifli of every kind, muft bring 
a great price in thefe populous towns. It mull be confclTed, 
■thac this field of induih-y has been much negledled ; and it 
was not till of late, after fome people from Nairn began to 
fifli in thefe lochs, that the inhabitants of the country were 
ienfible of the plenty, which Providence has placed within 
their reach. They are no^ beginning, and only beginning, 
to beflow more attention on this kind of fifhing, but not 
fucb as its importance deferves. In the end of fpring, and in 
fummer, there are feveral falmon fillieries, on the coads of 
the three lochs fo often mentioned ^ but the quantity of fal- 
mon killed is very inconfiderable. A few Ihoals of mackerel, 
ufually come in to Loch-goil, and Loch long, in the months 
of June and July. What fifli is killed is fent to Glafgow, 
f3-reenock, &amp;c. Before the middle of May the falmon gives 
from lod. to 8 d. the pound, and after tljat 6d. Mackerel, 
being a fiih which is only got pccafionally, never fails to 
bring a great price ; a mackerel generally brings from li d. 
to 2d. But the fifli which is of the greateft general good, 
in this country, and in every country where it is found in 
abundance, is herring. There is frequently a good herring 
iilfiing, in fome one of the three lochs connedted with this 
parifh. '1 he Loch-fine herrings are well known; and the her- 
rings killed in the two other lochs, are nearly of the fame fize 
and quality. The herrings generally make their appearance 
in the months of June and July, and fometimes remain till 
December or January ; and as the lochs in this country are 
feldorn more than a mile broad, and have no fwell of fea, 
por rapid currents, the boats can go out in the ftormieft fea- 
fcns. The alacrjty with which the people prepare for this.

feen:s to compenfate for their indifference to every other 
flfliing. The two laft feafons there was a great herring filh- 
ing in Loch-goil, and Loch-long, efpecially in the former j 
but fcarce any in Loch-fine. The lafl:. year in particular, 
there were iip\vard3 of 1 20 boats, and at leaft 500 men in 
both thefe lochs more than four months ; and there is good 
reafon tp believe, that L. 5000 Sterling were received, for 
herring, exclufive of what the fiflhers ufed for their own fub- 
fiftence, and of the great quantity which was confumed frefli 
in the country. It is computed that L. 1200 Sterling of this; 
money was drawn by the inhabitants of this parifh. Such a 
fifliing is not frequent in Loch-goil ; but, as has been already 
obferved, there are often great numbers of herrings caught ia 
fome one or other of the neighbouring lochs ; though there 
are fome feafons, in which this fifh entirely difappears. 
Loch-long, and Loch-goil, from their fituatipn, have one ad- 
vantage over Loch-fine. The herring that is killed in the 
two former lochs, may be brought to Greenock, or Glafgow, 
in a very fl\ort time, without any land carriage; whereas the 
herring that is killed any where near the head of Loch-fine, 
in order to be fold frelli, mull: be carried by horfes in creels, 
from Loch-fine, to the head of Loch-goil, at the diflance of 
eight or ten miles ; thus not only an additional expence is 
incurred, but the fifh i? much damaged by frequent hand- 
ling, efpecially in the warm feafon of the year. The herring 
that was killed early laft feafon, fold at 2 s, or 2s. 6d. the 
hundred ; after the fiOiing became general, j s. the hundre4 
was the ufual price. Befides the varieties of fifh already 
mentioned, there are fevcral other kinds found in thefe 
lochs. Flounders and fkate are in great abundance ; mullets 
alfo are fometimes to be found ; the fun or fail-fifh occafion.

without any refiftance, till it gets fo near the land, that for 
want of a fufEclent body of water, it cannot exert its ftrength, 
in dilintangling itfelf from the net, the fifliers in the mean 
time, take advantage of its fituation, and attack it with flicks 
and ftones, till they have it fecure. Some of thefe fifb are 
very large ; many of them have been taken afliore at Loch- 
goil.head, in the manner now defcrihed j there was one in 
particular, a few years ago, which meafured 28 feet in 
length, and from which 150 gallons of oil was extradhed. 
Small whales, and purpoifes, make their appearance in fum- 
mer, and backers at all times of the year. Of amphibious 
animals, there are none but the feal and the otter, nor are 
thefe very numerous. A few years ago, a creature of a very 
uncommon appearance, was taken afliore in a falmon net at 
Loch-long fide in this parifli ; it was of the fpecies called the 
fword-fifii. The body of the fifli was about nine feet long, 
and fomewhat rounded ; from its nofe iffued a horn, or hard 
bony fubftance, aoout three feet long, fliaped like a two- 
edged fword, and tapering beautifully towards the point, 
which with the edges were exceeding iharp. The year after 
this fifli was taken afhore, another of the fame kind was» 
caught in the fame place, and in the fame manner. Witii 
regard to fhell-fifli j there are a few oyfters to be got upon the 
ftones and rocks, and great abundance of mufcles, cockles, 
wilks, or periwinkles, and fome fpout-fifli. There is alfo fomc 
fea-ware, but not in great abundance, owing to the rugged- 
nefs of the fhore ; the fea-ware in this country is of an in- 
ferior quality, from the great quantity of frefli water in the 
lochs. About 20 tons of kelp may be made yearly. The 
fea-ware is alfo ufed for manure ; but generally with a mix- 
ture of dung. 

Birds. — The migratory birds which vifit this country, are 

the 



of Lochgmlhedd and Kilmorkh. iy^ 

the fwallow, cuckoo, fieldfare, doterel, green and gray plo- 
ver, and woodcock. With regard to native birds, the eagles 
of this country are of a prodigious Cze, and remarkable for 
their ftrength and ferocity. They make great havock aiiiong 
the lambs in the end of fpring, when, in addition to the cra- 
vings of their own hunger, they are impelled to rapine, by 
the cries of their young. There are fevcral inftances well 
vouched, of an eagle's carrying a lamb, whole and entire in 
the air, more than a mile, and bringing it to her nefl:. Two 
years ago, one of thefe birds carried a kid away from its 
dam, upwards of a mile, and after lighting with it upon the 
ground, on being feared away, by people who were coming 
that way, it was found, not only that the kid was alive, but 
that it had received no material injury ; the kid was five 
weeks old. The hawk is next to the eagle in ferocity ; but 
it does no injury to cattle. The raven is not fo harmlefs j 
kites, crows, and rooks, are in great abundance ; and the 
harfti and melancholy note of the owl, fometimes difturbs 
the filence of the night. This country has all the fmall 
birds which, are common in the weft of Scotland. Birds of 
game are not fo numerous as they were before the intro- 
duiflion of fheep ; thefe animals break their eggs, crop the 
tender part of the herbage, and of the heath, upon which 
they feed while young birds of prey, however, do more 
injury to game, than even the flieep ; and gentlemen of 
landed property, by their anxiety to preferve the game, 
feem to defeat their own purpofe. They have in effe£t dif- 
armed the country people ; the confequence is, that birds of 
prey of all kinds,, are becoming more numerous, and thefe 
birds do a great deal' more injury to the game, than poachers 
could poffibly do in fuch a country as this. The tarmagan

cormorant, heron, and fea-gull. 

Wild Benjls. — The red deer, once a native of this countrvj 
is not now to be feen ; but the roes have not yet altogether 
forfaken their old haunts. Hares are in great abundance. 
Foxes were formerly very numerous ; but fince the land has 
been chiefly flocked with flieep, the deftruction of thefe 
animals has become an obje£l of great attention. For this 
purpofe, two, three, or more parifhes, according to their ex- 
tent, join in fupporting a fox-hunter, and a pack of dogs. 
The fox- hunter receives a fixed 1 alary he is continually per- 
ambulating the country, and lives upon his employers j every 
tackfman and tenant being obliged to entertain him and his 
dogs, a fpecified number of nights in the year, accord- 
ing to the extent of land which he pofTeiTes. In confe- 
quence of this eftablifhment, a fox is feldom feen. Wild 
cats are more numerous than foxes, and are alfo very def- 
trudlive to lambs ; they lodge in the crevices of rocks, and 
in deep and narrow holes, in the face of dreadful precipices, 
where it is exceedingly difficult tb get near them. Martins 
are not fo freqjent as they have been, but there are ftill a 
few of them in the country ; and alfo polecats and weafels. 

Blach Catt'le and Herfes.—ThtYt are 1 80 horfes in the pa- 
rifli, and 2120 head of black cattle. The horfeS are partly 
reared in the parifh, and partly brought from the weftward. 
They are, ih general, neither handfome, nor large ; btit they 
are hardy, adive, laborious,' and eafily fed. The black 
cattle are fmall, but, like thofe of Argylefhire in ge- 
neral, they are very handfome, well haired, well limbed, and 
weigh well for their bulk, the ftots, or bullocks, are 
brought annually to Crieff, or Falkirk, and fold in thefe 

places.

places, to people from England. They are generally fold 
-when three or four years old, and after being fattened a few 
years in Lngland, it is faid, that they are reckoned fuperior 
to Englifli beef. The cows are fattened in the parifh, and 
in the neighbourhood, and fold to the butchers of Glafgow, 
Paifley, Greenock, and .Dumbarton. 

Shtep.—^TWii di^lricl is much better adapted for fhoep, 
than black cattle. Among the high rocks, concsaHcd deep 
•pits, and hanging precipices, black cattle could not pilture 
with any fafety i and, in-fornier times., a very conliderable 
number of them were loii every rlealon ; but Jheep can travel 
•tlirough thefe places with great eaie and fecuriry. The cir- 
■curaftance whkh principally renders this county improper 
■for black cattle, is the want of provender in winter. A 
great number niight -be grazed in 'fumnier and harveft, but 
there are no low lands from which to raife-fhe tt?iith part of 
the provender ncceflary for 'feeding them to -advantage in 
winter and fpring ; the provender, indeed, is ra-ther fcarce 
for the fmall number of black cattle in the.pari{h;iat prefenc, 
though there is double the quantity of hay ujade now, than 
was made ,30 years ago. Accordingly, when -this county 
was chiefly flocked with bbck cattle, there was not a iealorx 
in which a great number of .them. did not peri-ili ior want ; 
and in bad fealbns, it was VC17 common for a tenant to lofe a 
third, ancl fometimes the half of his flock. But there is now 
provender prepared for the fheep, and, except hi exceedinj 
bad years, when the fnow comes .on late in the fpring, and 
ll;s long upon the gron«d, there is never any confidsrahle 
\ok. John Campbell of Lagwine, from Ayrlhire, was the 
firft perfon who flocked a farm with flieep in this parifh, 3^ 
years ago. Some of his countrymen fettled foon after, in 
the neighbouring ,parifhc3. The country people regarded the

few Grangers who came to fettle among them with an evil 
eye ; and this rendered them more averfe to follow their ex- 
ample. But a fhort time reconciled them to their fyftem, 
and convinced them cf the fuperior advantage of Iheep to 
black cattle. From that time, therefore, the number of 
Iheep has been encreafing, and that of black cattle decreaf- 
ing. It is believed, that there are at prefent about 26,500 
flieep in this parilh. The few ftrangers who came to fettle 
here, brought with them the breed of flieep which they 
had in their o\yn country, and the fheep which have been 
introduced fince, from time to time, were chiefly brought 
from the Linton market. It is faid that there are principally 
two kinds of flieep at that market. The long tailed white faced 
flieep, ^rq a mongrel breed, a mixture of the Scots and the 
heavy Englifli breeds ; thefe h^ve never been found to thrive in 
this country. The other is the black faced fliort tailed kind ; 
thefe anfwer here well, and impfove greatly the firfl: few years. 
The proprietors of flieep in this diftridt are very attentive to, 
change the breed of their rams. Without this precaution, a 
£heep fl;ock is found to degenerate very foo:i. They are alfo 
convinced that it' would bp of advantage to change their hogs, 
1. e. one year old flieep ; and lome of them are refolyed to 
make the experiment. They feldom keep a rani above three, 
never above four years old. V/ith regard to the ewes, it is 
found very unprofitable to keep them longer than fix years ; 
they commonly begin to degenerate at four. Indeed, the 
vounger the breeding flieep are, it is the better for the flock, 
both with regard to carcafe and wool. The rams are re- 
moved from the ewes the firlT; day after the loth of Octo- 
ber, and kept feparate from a month to fix weeks, confe- 
quently the ewes lamb between the ift and 20th of April. 
The flieep in this country run wild through the mountains, 
but they muft be gathered at leaft four times in the year. 
■ ' ' ■  The 



of L ocbgoil ■ bead and Kilmorich. 179 

The firfl: gathering is early in the month of May, in order 
to mark and cut the ram-Iambs ; the fecond in the month of 
June or July, to clip the wool ; the third in Augufl:, to wean 
the lambs from the ewes, and the fourth in Oiftober, to fe- 
parate the rams from the ewes. The llieep that are fold, 
are bought upon the fpot by tlie butchers of Glafgow, and 
the other neighbouring tdwns ; and the tackfmen wifh to 
manage matters fd, that the butchers may take them awaj'-, 
at the two laft gatherings. In this, however, they are not al- 
ways fuccefsful; on the contrary, they are frequently obliged 
to have other gatherings, merely for the butcher. They ge- 
nerally fell off about a third of their lambs, and always the 
"worft. Their wedders they feldom keep more than three 
years, though they are not in rheir prime till four or five ; 
but it is found more profitable to fell them when three years 
old, than to keep them longer. The year old fheep and the 
rams are fmeared ; Imearing preferves them from the fcab, 
and from vermin ; it keeps them warm in winter, by occa- 
fioning a continual perfpiration, which prevents the fnow 
from lying upon them, in fo much, that a fmeared flieep may 
eafily be known in fnowy weather by its not being covered 
over with fnow, like the reft of the flock. The great quantity 
of fnow which lies upon a flieep, efpecially if it freezes Upon 
the animal, mufl: be a very heavy load, and mufi: greatly ob- 
flruft it in travelling, and in working for its meat, i. e. re- 
moving the fnow with its feet, in order to get at the herb- 
age : The fhieared flieep are free from this inconveniency ;

pears to be an Inflammation of the bowels; it carries tiicni'

after the' animal dies, and entire, it fells for half price. This 
difeafed meat is partly eat by fervants, partly by cottagers, and 
a confiderable quantity of ic is falted and fent to market. No 
antidote has yet been difcovered againft this difeafe. It ufual-

flefli ; blit the high fteep hills, and thick fogs in this coun- 
try, render it impoflible-ta pafture ftieep in feparate hirlles, 
as they do in the fouth. It does not appear that the flieep 
which have been introduced within thde laft ^o years, arc 
of a better kind, than the few" flieep which were in the 
country before that period. I-t jnufl: be confefled, that the 
prefent kind are larger, but th«rc was no attention paid to 
the improvement of the old breed : The breed of rams was 
never changed, they had actefs to the ewes at all times of 
the yfeari the ewes often brought forth in the months of Fe- 
br-uary and March, and a great number of the lambs periflied 
in the florm: the few who furvived wanting fuitable nourifli- 
ment, were ftinted in their growth, and the refufe of the' 
lambs were never fold oft'.- Notwithftanding thefe difadvan- 
tages, the old flieep were not much inferior in bulk, to the 
prefent kind, . and their flbfla was equally fat, delicious, and 
well-flavoured. 

7^00/.— Whatever be the cafe, with regard to the carcafe,. 
the wool of the prefent breed of flieep is much inferior to 
that which grew upon the old Highland kind. The prefenr 



oj Lochgoil-head and KilmGrkh 



flieep, indeed, yield a larger quantity, but it is coarfe, ftrong, 
and fliaggy ; the fliecp which were in the country formerly,, 
had thick fhort wool, remarkably fine in the pile. At pre- 
fent about leven fleeces go to the ftone ; there are upwards 
ef 3000 ftones fold annually in this parifh. The greatefts 
part of which, for fonie years paft, has been fold to the pro- 
prietors of a very extenfive woollen manufeftory, betweea 
Glafgow and Dumbarton, and conveyed there by water at 
the expence of the ptirchafers. The price of the white 
wool is 7 s. and 6 s. 6 d. wheii there is a fourth part of it 
laid ; it is ufual to give a ftone to the fcore. Though all the 
wool in' this parifh brings the fanie price, it is not all nearly 
of the fame value ; the buyers are fenfible of this, and when 
they get' well acquainted with the wool of the different 
ftirms, it is hoped they will make a diftinftion, as nothing 
rends more to difcourage the improvement of wool, than 
giving the fame price for the good and the bad. 

Population. — From a furvcy of the parifli, w'hich was finifh- 
ed the 24th day of March 1791, it appears, that the number 
of inhabitants at that time was 1012; of whom there wera 
under 15 years of age - 431

married - - 276 

widowers and widows - 8 c

The great decreafe in the population of ttie country 13 
owing to the introduftion of (heep. Since the farms have 
been chiefly flocked with fheep, one man often rents as 
much land as 10, 12, or 14 tenants formerly poflefled. 

Utility of the Pre/ent SyJIem. — It is frequent with people 
who wifli well to their country, to inveigh againft the prac- 
tice of turning feveral fmall farms into one extenfive grazing, 
and difpoflefling the former tenants. If the ftrength of a 
country depends upon the number of its inhabitants, it ap- 
pears a pernicious meafure to drive away the people by de- 
priving them of their poiTefHons, This complaint is very 
juft, with regard to fome places in Scotland ; for it muft be 

greatly 

• There never was regider of burials kept in the parifli. 



of LochgoU'head and Ktlmorkh* 183 



greatly againft the interefl: of the nation, to turn rich arable 
land, which is capable at the fame time of fupporting a 
number of people, and of producing much grain, into paf- 
ture ground. But the complaint does not fecm to apply to 
this country. The ftrength of a nation cannot furely con- 
Cft in the number of idle people which it maintains ; that 
the inhabitants of this part of the country were formerly 
funk in indolence, and contributed very little to the wealth, 
or to the fupport of the ftate, cannot be denied. The pro- 
duce of this parifh, fince fheep have become the principal 
commodity, is at leaft double the intrinfic value of what it 
was formerly fo that half the number of hands produce 
more than double the quantity of provifions,_ for the fapport 
of our large towns, and the fupply of our tradefmen and 
manufacturers ; and the fyftem by which land returns the 
moft valuable produce, and in the greateft abundance, feeras 
to be the moft beneficial for the country at large. Still, 
however, if the people, who are difpoffefled of this land, 
emigrated into other nations, the prefent fyftem might be 
juftly condemned, as diminilhing the ftrength of the country. 
But this is far from being the cafe ; of the great number of pep- 
jjle who have been deprived of their farms in this parifti, for 
30 years paft, few or none have fettled out of the kingdom ; 
they generally went to fea, or to the populous towns upon 
the Clyde. The greatqft part of them betook themfelves tp 
a fea-faring life, and there are many veflels belonging to 
Clyde, and to other places in the Weft India, American, and 
coafting trades, and in the fiflieries, at prefent commandec^, 
and partly navigated, by men who were born in this country, 
and the greateft number of whom would have remained in 
the fame ftate of indolence and infignificance with their an- 
ceftors, if they had not been obliged to go in fearch of better 
fortunes. Such of the people as went to towns, and had no

ilock to lay out In trade, found employment, partly as day- 
labourers, porters, barrowmen, boatmen, &amp;c. but the great- 
«ft number of thofe who left the country for 1 5 years paft, 
fupport themfelves by working in bleachfields, printfields, 
cotton-mills, qnd many other branches of manufa(^lures, in 
which much previous inftruflion or preparation is not rc- 
,[uired. In thefe places, they have an eafy opportunity, 
vhich they generajly embrace, of training up their childrea 
to ufeful and profitable employments, and of rendering them 
valuable members of fociety. So that the former inhabi- 
tants of this country have been taken from a fituation, in 
which they contributed nothing to the wealth, and very- 
little to the fupport of the flrate, to a fituation in which their 
labour is of the greateft public utility. It is true, indeed, 
that while they remained in tlieir former fituation, the coun^- 
try had always a brave and a hardy race of men, r^ady to 
rife in its defence, in times of danger ; and though the inha- 
bitants of this parifli were never fond of a military life, and 
few of them ever enlifled in flanding regiments, they always 
fhowed great alacrity in arming for the defence of their 
country ; and twice formed a company in the fencible regi- 
ments, which were raifed for that purpofe. But it will be 
acknowledged, that the navy is of greater importance to this 
country than the army. The prefent fyftem tends to fupport 
the navy, not only by increafing the flock of our manu- 
faftures, and thereby promoting commerce, but alfo bydirefliy 
increafing the number of our feamen. It has already been 
obferved, that more than the half of the young people who 
left this country went to fea ; when married, their families 
Jive in fea- port towns ; their fons early follow their father's 
own profcflion ; on any emergency, they arc liable to be 
p;-efled into the navy j and during the late unfortunate Ame- 
rican 



of L ochgoil- bead and Kihnorich, 185 

•fjcan war, a great number of them fervcd on board the 
King's (hips. 

Nor has the prefent fyftem contributed to make the con- 
dition of the inliabitants of the country worfe than it was be- 
fore ; on the contrary, the change is greatly in their favour. 
The partiality in favour of former times, and the attachment 
to the place of their nativity, which is natural to old people, 
together with the indolence in which they indulged them- 
felves in this country, miflead them in drawing a comparifon 
between their paft, and their prefent fituations. But indo- 
lence was almoft the only comfort which they enjoyed. 
There was fcarcely any variety of wretchednefs, with which 
they were not obliged to ftruggle, or rather to which they 
were not obliged to fubmit. They often felt what it was to 
want food ; the fcanty crops which they raifed were con- 
fumed by their cattle in winter and fprijig •, for a great part 
of the year they lived wholly on milk, and eveti that in the 
end of fpring, and beginning of winter, was very fcarce. To 
fuch extremity were they frequently reduced, that they 
were obliged to bleed their cattle, in order to fubfift for 
fome time upon the blood ; and even the inhabitants of the 
glens and vallies, repaired in crowds to the fliore, at the dif- 
tance of three or four miles, to pick up the fcanty provifion 
which the (hell fiflh afforded them. They were miferably ill 
clothed, and the huts in which they lived, were dirty and 
mean beyond expreflion. How different from their prefent 
fituation ? They now enjoy the necelTaries, and many of the 
comforts of life in abundance % even thofe who are fupported 
by the charity of the parifh, feel no rea.l want. Much of 
the wretchednefs which formerly prevailed in this, and in 
other pariflies in the Highlands, was owing to the indolence 
of the people, and to their want of management ; but a

country, \vhich is neither adapted for agriculture, nor for 
rearing black cattle, can never maintain any great number 
of people comfortably. A few villages, one perhaps in this 
parifl), might be of fervice in carrying on the fifliing. The 
herrings, however, in thefe lochs, are a precarious fupport y 
and it may be doubted, whether the other fifheries would 
maintain a great number of men v perhaps the cottagers al- 
ready in the country, are fufficiently numerous, to make the 
moft of the white fifhing, if they carried on the bufinefs 
with induftryand pcrfcverance ; at any rate, if they gave it 
a fair trial, it would be found, whether an acceffion of peo- 
ple to the country would be eligible. But in order to carry 
on the fifliing wiih fuccels, it would' be expedient that a vil» 
lage fliould be formed., and that the fifliers fliould live in 
one place. The moft convenient fituation for a village in 
this parifli, feems to be near the entry into Loch-goil, this 
fituation being convenient for Loch-goil, Loch-long, and the 
Frith of Clyde. 

Number of Proprietors , Tack/men, and 'Tenants* — There are 
three proprietors of lands in this parilh, they are all perfons 
of rank, family, and fortune, and have eftates in other parilhes. 
None of them relide here, except the principal heritor, who 
has refided in it occaiionally, during the two laft years. The 
valued rent of the parifti is L.4392 : i : o Scots, or L.366 : o : i 
Sterling. The real rent is about L. 2500 Sterling, exclufive 
of the woods : 40 years ago the rent did not exceed L. 800 
Sterling. Of the tackfmen, there are three who pay above 

L. 200, 

* jln this co^ln^ry, when a m;m tatcs a leafe of a whole 
farm, and pays L. 50 Sterling, or upwards, of yearly rent, he 
is called a tackfman ; when two or more join about a farm, 
and each of them pays a fum lefs than they are called 

tenants.

L.50 Sterling of yearly rent j the reft, to the number of 35, 
are fmall tenants, and pay from %. 10 to L.40 Sterling 
year, 'fhe tackfmen are opulent, comfortably lodged, and 
live with great decency ; the tenants are alfo eafy in their 
circumftances, and enjoy in a reafonable degree the comforts 
and advantages -of fociety. The land in general is let upon 
very reafonable terms. This is chiefly owing to the late Sir 
James Campbell of Ardkinglafs, who did not wifh to oppreis 
his people, but took pleafure in feeing them profperous and 
happy. The benevolence and moderation of that gentleman 
will be long and gratefully remembered in this country. 

Poor. — The number of poor on the roll of the parifh at 
prefent, is 23 ; they are fiipported by tlie money collected in 
the church on Sundays, which, at an average, amounts to 
near L. 24 SterHng a year. This fund is diftributed to the 
poor, according to their refpeftive circumftances. 

Church. — There are two :hurches in this parifh, one at 
Lochgoil-head, where the manfe is, and the other at Cairndow, 
near Kilmorich, upon Loch-fine fide^ The minifler preaches 
two Sabbaths at X,ochgoil-head, and the third S^ibbath at 
Cairndow; Both tlie churches are ©Id, and in bad order; the 
manfe was built about 80 years ago, and is now undergoing 
a thorough repair. The living, including two glebes, one at 
Lochgoil-hcad, and the other at Kilmorich, may be valued 
at L. 130 Sterling. Sir Alexander Campbell of Ardkinglafs, 
Baronet, is patron, and chief heritor. The family of Ard- 
kinglafs have had the principal property in this parifli, for 
many centuries. There is no Secedsr nor Roman Catholic 
ifi it( 



Schools., 



Btaiiflical Account 

Si/jsols.—Thcre are two fcliools in this diftria ; a paro- 
chial fchool at Lochgoil-head, and a fchool at Cairndow, 
fupported by the Society for propagating Chriftian Know- 
ledge. The parochial fchoolouder teaches Latin, Englifl), 
Gaelic, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, navigation, and 
church-mufic ; and the Society fchoolmafter teaches all thcfe 
branches of education, except Latin. The ntimber of fcholars 
who attend the parochial fchopl is about 40. The number 
who attend the Society fchool is ulually about 6c. This 
difparity in the number of the fcholars, is owing to the dif- 
ference of the roads leading to the fchools. Some of the 
tackfmen employ young men to teafh their children in their 
own houfes ; and the tenants and cottagers, who live at a dif- 
tance from the eft^blifhed fchools, ufuaUy join in hiring a 
teacher at tleir own expence, at Icaft during the winter fea- 
Ibn. The falary of the parochial and Society fchoplmaftcrs 
is L. 10 Sterling each ; and their other perquilites amount to 
about L. to more. It muft be acknowledged, that L. 
too little for the decent and comfortable fupport of a f.hoo!- 
maftcr, and too fmall an allowance for the great trouble ani 
importance of his charge. 

jTw^;/.— 'There are two principal houfiis of entertainment in 
this parifli, one Sit Lochgoil-head, and the other at Cairn- 
dow ; they are both peceflary for the accommodation of the pu- 
blic, Cairndow being lituated upon the line of the great wefterii 
ftjilitary road, and the only ftage between Arrochar and Inver- 
aray i and Lochgqil-head being a much frequented pars,efpe- 
cially in fummer, between the Wert Highlands and the Low 
Country. Beildes thefe, there arc two or three huts in the 
parifh, where fpirits are occaljonally fold. Thefe, however, 
have no bad cSecls cpoa the morals of the inhabitants of 
this country* 



of Lochgoil'head and Kilmorlch, 189 

Roads and Bridges.— Tht roads were formerly made and 
kept in repair by the ftatute labour ; but that method was 
found inconvenient, and ineffbaual, for making and keeping 
up good roads. Some years ago, an aft of Parliament was 
obtained for the county of Argyle, converting the ftatute la- 
bour into money, to be paid at the rate of as. by every male 
perfon above 14 years of age. There is alfo an affelFment 
upon the land, at the rate of 1 s. per pound of valued rent, a 
third of which is payable by the proprietors, and two- thirds 
ty the tenants. The great military road from Dumbarton, 
to the Well: and North- weft Highlands, goes through 16 
miles of the upper end of this parilh ; but, upon the weft 
coafb of Loch-long, and upon both fides of Loch-goil, there 
is fcarce fo much as a path ; the ruggednefs of the country 
renders travelling extremely difficult, and the many large 
and rapid waters without bridges, make thefe parts of the 
parifti often impaffable. It is found very difficult to keep up 
the bridges in many parts of the country ; the rivers fwell fo 
luddenly, and ruth down from the mountains with fuch ra- 
pidity, that the bridges muft be built in very advantageous 
fituations, in order to ftand any time. There is one bridge 
in particular, near Lochgoil-head, which has fallen three 
times, within the laft 15 years; it was built at firfb, and. 
twice rebuilt, at the expence of the inhabitants. 

CharaBer of the People. — The tackfmen of this parlfh are 
in general very refpedtable, both with regard to information 
and morals ; the tenants are fober and induftrious ; the cot- 
tagers are rather indolent, efpecially after they are fuccefsful 
in the herring filhing ; and too many of them fpend their 
time, from the beginning of January to the beginning of 
April, without any employment, but preparing their nets fo,r 
the enfuing feafon. To this, however^ there are many ex- 
ceptions.

Siatiftical Account 



ceptlons, and fome of the cottagers are fedulous and aftlve 
in fupporting their families : it is much to be wiflied, that 
the cottagers would carry on the white fifhing, during thele 
months of the year, in which fo many of them are at pre- 
fent idle. The people of this parifti have long been remark- 
able for their ftridt honefty, the regularity of their manners, 
their humanity, and their courtefy to ftrangers. 

Language and Drefs. — The Gaelic language is mofl gene- 
rally fpoken in this diftrifl. The greater number of the 
people fpeak Englifh, but not in general with fo much eafe and 
fluency as they Ipeak Gaelic. Many of the old people un- 
derftand no Englifti. The Gaehc that is Ipoken in this 
place, owing to the frequent communication with the Low 
Country, is corrupted with a mixture of Englifli words and 
phrafes, and is not (o pure, nor fo correfl, as that which is 
fpoken in the more remote parts of the Highlands. It. is 
not, however, more than 15 years, fince the prefent minifter 
heard very old people in the parifh repeat Gaelic poems, 
which they afcribed to Oflian, Orran, and other Caledonian 
bards ; among thefe there were fome detached and mutilated 
pieces of the poems, tranflated by Mr M'Pherfon, and fome 
entire epifodes, fince publifhcd by Dr Smith of Campbeltown. 
The inhabitants in general, except thofe who carry on the 
fiOiing, continue to wear the Highland drefs, the bonnet, the 
phillabeg, and tartan hofe ; even the authority of an aft of 
Parliament, was not fufikient to make them relinquifli their 
ancient garb. 

Jdvnntages and Difadvantagcs. — The inhabitants of that 
part of the parifh which is fituated upon Loch. fine fide, la- 
bour under a very great difadvantage with regard to fuel. 
The peats there are fcarce, and at fuch a difiance, on the 

tops 



of Lochgoil-head and Kilmcrkh, 391 

tops of high, fteep, and rugged mountains, that they are 
carried to the houles at a very great expcnce. At the fame 
time, the great diftance from the Low Country, and the 
croffnefs of the navigation, render the freight of coal very 
high ; but, as if thefe natural difadvantages were not fufii- 
ciently diftreffing, the coals are fubje£led to a very heavy 
duty. Wliatever may have been the original caufe of this 
tax, it is aftonifliing, that the Legiflature of a free and en- 
lightened nation, fliould have fo long continued a duty fo 
oppreffive and partial, and which fo direftly counterafts e- 
very attempt that can be made to improve thofe remote parts 
of the kingdom. 

The want of inelofures is another very great difadvantagCp 
in all parts of the parifli. In a country which is not calcu- 
lated for raifing corn, and where provender is very fcarce, 
green crops, particularly fown graffes, and field turnips, 
would be of the greateft advantage. This advantage the 
people cannot enjoy without inelofures ; and inelofures will 
not become general, till the proprietors encourage that fpe- 
cies of improvement more than they do at prefent. A tackf. 
man or tenant has little inducement to make improvements. 
Hi3 leafe is fhort, never exceeding 19 years. The expence of 
{locking his farm, may in general, be fuppofed, for a few 
years, to exhauft his money, and in a country which was for- 
merly poflcffed by fmall and poor tenants, and which has 
been but lately flocked with Iheep, the tackfmen are only 
beginning to have comfortable dwelling-houfes and there 
are many fmall inelofures of different kinds ftill wanting for 
the Iheep ; fo that a great part of a man's leafe will be ex- 
pired, before he can get himfelf conveniently fet down ; 
and (hould he continue to ma,ke other improvements, parti-

cularly Inclofures, he not only throws away his money, with-* 
out having time to get fuitable returns, but thefe improve^ 
ments will make the farm more valuable, and confequently 
heighten his rent, in the event of his getting a new leafe ; 
and they often tempt others to offer a greater rent than 
they would otherwife have done ; fo that he runs a greater 
hazard of being difpolTefled, in confequence of thofe very 
improvements which he has made at his own expence. 
Whatever money is judicioufly laid out upon inclofures, is 
evidently for the advantage of the proprietor ; he reaps the 
benefit ; he ought therefore to contribute to the expence. 
The tackfmen of this country, are in general, fo lenfiblc of 
the advantage of inclofures, that they would very willingly 
bear the half of the expence of making them, and keep 
them in repair entirely at their own charges, or pay the pro- 
prietor legal intereft for whatever money he lays out for that 
purpofe ; or make the inclolures wholly at their own ex- 
pence, upon condition of being paid the value of them at 
the end of their leafe. The inclofures that feem to fuit 
this place beft, are ftone dykes and ditches ; hedges will not, 
in general, anfwer the purpofe j the young cattle in this 
country lie out both fummer and winter, and are fo lively 
and wild, that they will run through a hedge without diffi- 
culty ; and nothing can confine them, but a fufficient ftone 
dyke, or a deep ditch. The parilh enjoys a very great ad- 
vantage, from the eafy accefs to market, in the higher parts 
of the county, by the military road already mentioned, and 
jn the other parts by water carriage. By thefe means, the 
people can fend their black cattle, flieep, wool, fifli, and 
every other commodity to Greenock, Glafgow, Dumbarton, 
and other towns, with great eafe ; and they alfo get, I ex- 
cept thofe who live upoa Loch-finc fide, all the articles

which they import, brought to their doors, with expedition, 
and with very little expence. The confequence of tliis re- 
gular and eafy communication, is, that the inhabitants have 
always a fure and ample fupply of the neceflaries of life. 
Even in the year 1782, when more remote and inland 
countries were in the greateft diftrefs for meal, this parifh 
had a plentiful fupply from Clyde,

<p>Situation^ Extcnty Name, K^fc. 

THIS parifh is fituated in the prefbytery of Haddington, 
and fynod of Lothian and Tweeddale, where the Frith 
of Forth opens into the German ocean. It is about fix En- 
glish miles in length, and as many in breadth. The weft 
part along the Frith is barren land for near three miles. To- 
wards the eaft the foil is better, and confifts of a large 
plain, near three miles in length, and one in breadth, which 
is covered with fine grafs, and Teems never to have been 
ploughed. There are two fmall iflands belonging to the pa- 
rifh. The one called Fidrie is a very beautiful ifland, on 
which there are the ruins of a building, probably defigned either 
for a chapel, or a lazaret for the fick. The village of Dirle- 
ton is nearly in the middle of tlve parifli, ftanding on a 
rocky ground, riling towards the weft. Ihe rocks found 
and fhake, as carriages pals along, w^hich circumftance, pro- 
bably gave rife to the name ; the Scottilh word Dirl Cgnify- 
ing trembling. 

D'lfeafes. — Agues and nervous diftempers are common 
here, Eaft-Lothian being much expoled to the eafi:erly 
winds, which blow in April and May.

Fijb^ The fea oppofite to this parifh abounds with 

aieli-lifti, and till of late, afforded abundance of white flftx. 
There are aUo a good many feals on the coaft. Sea-ware is 
plentiful after a ftorm, and is found to be an excellent ma- 
nure. This weed, taken from the rocks and burnt, affords 
about 1 2 ton of kelp yearly. 

, Agriculture.— 'Thcve are at prefent about 10 farmers in the 
parilh, men remarkable for their indultry and knowledge ia

Population, — ^There has been no great alteration in the 
number of inhabitants for thefe 50 years paft. There never 
was any great trade or manufadlure in the parifli, and the 
hands employed in agriculture, are always nearly the fame. 
There are at prefent about 1200 of all ages, and about 900 
above 10 years of age. From the feffion records, it ap-

The common people are rather of a large fize, and are re-

Wages. — Men fervants maintained in the houfe, receive 
from L. 6 to L. 7 Sterling yearly ; women fervants from 
L. 2 : 10 to L. 3, day-labourers from 10 d. to is. The 
young people are much employed in weeding corn and tur- 
nips, during the fummer feafon ; their wages are from 4d. to 
5 d. a day. 

Improvements — The people here are inclofing their fields, 
and raifing turnips ; potatoes (which now conftitute a great 
part of the living of the common people) are much culti- 
vated. Many cattle and work horfes are bred. There arc 
but few trees of any age or growth in this part of the coun- 
try. Mr Nilbet of Dirleton has planted a good many of 
late, moftly fir, afli, and elm, and is increafing the number 
pvery year. 



Schools. — In the parifli there are feveral fmall villages, 
where old and infirm people keep fchools for young child- 
ren. The principal eftabliflicd fchod is in the village of 
Dirleton j the falary is 20© merks Scots, about L. 1 1 Ster-

chial fund, arifing from feveral fums of money, mortified by 
the family of Dirleton, and by Mrs Carmichacl. There are 
at prefent about 40 on the poor's roll ; but there is not one 
beggar in the parifli belonging to it. In this part of the 
country, coal is the common fuel, either brought by fea, or 
from fome coal pits which are now wrought in the county. 
Near the head- land called Gulan Nefs, there was formerly a 
ferry-boat, for carrying pafi^engers from Eafl:-Lothian to Fife ;

houfes, and cottagers, for the purpofes of agriculture. The 
latter are confidered to be more fteady, and lefs given to 
change ; and are generally trufted with fome degree of over- 
^ fight in the farm. The wages of thefe cottagers, or hinds 
as they are here called, is nine bolls of oats, two bolls of 
barley, two bolls of peafe, a cow maintained fummer and 
winter; and, if they fow and ftack the grain, one firlot of 
wheat, and a pair of flioes. All fervants, day-labourers,

NUMBER XXII. 

PARISH OF <name ref="NA">COULL</name>, 

[County of Aberdeen.") 
By the Rev. Mr Alexander Robertson.</head> 

<p>Name, Situation, ^c. 

THE name of this parifli, {Coull) is of Gaelic extrac- 
tion, as are the names of almoft all the places in this 
country. By a very fmall variation in found, it may mean 
either the back or the corner, the latter of which is its natu- 
ral and proper import ; as it is fituated not fo much on the 
back of any rifing ground, as in the corner of a large ftrath 
called Cromar, in the eaft end of which Coull lies. It is in 
the prefbytery of ICincardine-Oniel, county and fynod of 
Aberdeen. The form of the parilh is nearly triangular ; its 
longeft fide may meafure about five miles, and the other two 
about three miles and a half each. The ftrath or country of 
which Coull forms a part, is in general flat, but furrounded 
with hills on every fide, which fiielter it very much. The 
Toil is of an excellent quality, deep and fertile, equally re- 
moved from clay and fand, and is confequently lefs apt to 
fail id its produce, either from violent drought on the one 
hand, or inceflant rain on the other. The air is pure, dry, 
and healthy ; and there are no dileafes, as far as I have had 
accefs to hear, peculiar to the place. To the weft of the 
manfe, there is u large bog or marfli, called Bogmore, 

through 



cf Coull. 

through the midft of which, a fmall rivulet runs, but fo ftlU 
as to be hardly perceptible, till you come near to Tarland, 
which is about two miles to the weft. In confequence of fo 
long a level, the bog often rifes to an extraordinary height, 
forming a flieet of water, about a mile fquare, full of wild 
gecfe, and ducks ; the laft of which remain throughout the 
year; the former make their appearance about the middle of 
September, and continue till about the end of April. There 
are few fifh, to be found in this bog except pike. There 
are no remarkable mountains here ; the hills around are 
bleak and barren, affording pafturage only for Iheep. 

Population. — The number of inhabitants is from 4^0 td 
470, men, women, and children, included. There are 205 
males, and about 260 females. The number in Dr Web- 
fter's report is 751. In this parifli there are no inftances of 
extraordinary longevity, which are well authenticated. It 
would alfo be extremely difScull to fiix the precife num- 
ber of farmers here, for every man is ;v farmer in his 
own way. A man of fome wealth and ftanding in the 
country, takes immediately from the proprietor 100 or 150 
acres of arable land, and becomes accountable to him for the 
rent of this quantity : be will perhaps retain one third or 
one half of the beft of it in his own hand, and let the re- 
mainder to the poor dependents in his neighbourhood- As 
there is no market for potatoes here, the farmer raifes only 
as many as ferves his own family. 

Advantages and Difadvantages.— This parifh enjoys no pe- 
culiar advantages, except a fine pure air, and a warm lively 
foil. Its difadvantages are : 1. It lies in an inland country, 
far from market, and the means of improvement. Aberdeen, 
the neareft fea-port, is 30 miles eaft. 2. This difadvantage 

might 



200 Siatiftkal Account 

might be furmounted, if proper encouragement were allow- 
ed or improvements ; the foil would be very grateful with 
ordinary treatment, but there is fcarcely room even for that 5 
few farmers here can fay with certainty, that the lands 
which they poflefs this year, will be their's the next ; they 
hold their farms , from year to year, and it totally depends on 
the will of the landlord, whether they fliall continue or re- 
move. What farmer holding his ground on fuch a precarious 
footing, would choofe to lay out money in improving his 
farm ? 3. Accordingly, there are few fences in this coun- 
try ; and on that account, though the people here begin to 
fee the advantages of raifing turnips, and would alfo very 
readily be brought in to improve by fowing grafs-feeds, 8cc. 
yet it is hardly poffible, without fences, to preferve either; for 
it is the curtom here, and in the whole country round, as 
foon as harveft is over, to fet cattle, flieep, and horfes at li- 
berty ; by which means, grafs, turnips, and every thing of 
the kind, are trampled under foot, or eaten up. 4. Ano- 
ther miterinl difadvantage which this parifh, and the whole 
diftridt round, labours under at prefent, and if not fpeedily 
removed, muft in a very few years complete the ruin of 
mary farmers here, is the difficulty of procuring fervants, 
and the enormous height at which their wages are arrived. 

Church and Poor. — ^The glebe, &amp;c. will amount to about 
L. 60 Sterling. The church was rebuilt laft fummer ; the 
offices are to be rebuilt this year, and the manfe repaired. 
There are three heritors in this parifh, Sir William Forbes 
of Lraigievar, and the Earls of Aberdeen and Aboyne. None 
of them refide in it. Mr Farquharfon of Finzean, has 
alfo fome property, and pays a fmall proportion of ftipend. 
The poor in this parifli are few in number, perhaps nine or 
ten at an average. The annual amount of the contributions, 

will 



of Coilll, 2.01 

s^III be little better than L. 4 Sterling of money, and at inte- 
reft about L. 40 Sterling. 

Antiquities.- About a mile and a half weft of the manor, 
ire to be feen the remains of a Druidical temple. The 
3lace is called Tammvnc, which fignifies the Hill of Wor- 
ihip i but there is nothing to be feen but a few large ftones, 
:ome t)f them ftanding upright, others fallen down, without 
my appearance of figures or infcription. The moft remark- 
able fragment ot antiquity, in this parifh, is the CalUe of 
Coull i it is fituated about one-fourth of an iLnglifli mile 
fouth of the manfe. Not many years ago, there was fcarcely 
any thing to be feen at all, but a number of little green hills, 
and the remainder of an old wall, about 30 yards long, and 
JO or 12 feet thick; the ruins were buried in the ground, 
and might have continued hid from mortal view, had not a 
fcarcity of manure induced people to dig about the old wall 
For rubbifh ; in doing this, they came upon the remains of 
Four gates and five turrets, of very extraordinary dimenfions. 
Thefe laft, as nearly as can be guelTed, for it is impoffible to 
mcafure them exadlly, on account of their broken ftate, will 
be about 18 or 20 feet diameter; the walls in thofe places 
which feem moft entire, are 15 feet thick, built with 
lime and ftone throughout ; one of the gates, which is not fo 
much demoliflied as the reft, is clofed above with a Gothic 
arcli of free ftone ; this gate is 9 feet wide, 12 feet high, and 
15 feet thick. The whole work, as far as it can now be tra- 
ced, appears to have been a fquare, meafuring about 50 
yards on each fide. It is only a very fmall portion of it that 
is yet opened up ; three fides of it, in a great meafure, are ftill 
under ground. Among the rubbifh dug up, were found fe- 
veral imall pieces of filver coin, with this infcription :

    PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q880816">BLACKFORD</name>*

( County of Perth. J 
By the Rev. Mr John Stevenson,</head>  


<p>
Situation, Surface, ^c. 

THE parifh of Blackford lies in the county of Perth, 
prefbytery of Auchterarder, and the fynod of Perth 
and Stirling. The church ftands upon a rifing ground, and is 
nearly in the centre of the parifli, which extends three or 
four miles around it. It was burnt in the year 1738, after 
difmiffing the ichool in the evening. It was afterwards re- 
built upon the fame ground. The moft foutherly part of 
the pari Ih is occupied by a ridge of the Ochil hills, which 
upon the fouth fide, towards the Devon, is fomewhat fteep^ 
and in fome places craggy, affording excellent pafture for 
fheep. Upon the north fide, the declivity is more gentle, 
and laid out in feveral farms. The bottom of the country is^^ 
a dead flat, watered by the Allan. Part of it is arable, and 
the reft is either deep mofs, or marfhy ground, where the 
plough cannot go. Upon the north 01 the Allan, the 
ground rifes and forms a group of fandy or gravelly hills, 
with a vaft number of hollows, fome of them rounds ^nd 
others extended in length, forming Iktle valleys, cproiigh 
which, for the moft part, fome fmall brook runs. Tivefe 
heights may be from 20 to 30 feet perpendicular, and make 



204 



Siaii/tical Account 



a very uncommon appearance. They contain no rock, but 
when dug into, difcover nothing but ftrata of dead fand or 
coarl'e gravel They are generally covered with a fliort 
heath or broom, having little or no foil upon the furface. 
North from thefe tumuli, the ground rifes to a large moor, 
called the moor of TuHibardine, the property of the Duke 
of Athole. It is continued from the Grampian hills in 
Muthil parifli, and defcends gradually eaftward to the parifh 
of Auchterarder, dividing Stnithallan from Strathearn, and 
the fouth fide of this parifli from the north. It is about two 
miles in breadth, is perfeflly flat, and every where covered 
with heath. From this to the north boundary of the pa- 
rifh, the ground rifes and finks alternately, according to the 
courfe of feveral rivulets which run through it from wefl: to 
eafl, till they fall into the Earn. 

Soil and Climate. — The foil in this parifli is not good. In 
general, it is thin, with a coarfe gravelly bottom, and may 
be divided into wet and dry in the extremes. " A great part 
is foaked in water, which ifTues from numberlefs fprings, or 
runs between the upper fward and the gravel below. What 
is dry is a light fliarp mould, mixed with fand, and a vaft 
number of fmall flcnes. In fome places, the foil is deep, and 
confifis of a cold wet fandy clay, with mofs or dead fnnd be- 
low. Some few fpots, that have been long cultivated, are 
tolerably fertile when the feafon is good 5 but the far greater 
part of the ground in tillage has not the fniallefl pretenfions 
to fertility. But, bad as the foil is, the climate is flill more 
unfavourable. Great part of the parifh lies very high above 
the level of the fea, and with the Ochil hills between it and 
the fun. The efFedts of the cold are fenfibly felt in retard- 
ing and marrincr the growth "of vegetables. Owing to the 
vicinity of the Ochil hills, we arc expofed to continual rain, 

and 



of Blackford* 20 § 

and to henvy and deep falls of fnow, which, for the moft 
part, lie very long, and render the country impaflvible. 

Dl/ea/es. While the climate is fo noxious to plants, it 

cannot be favourable to the bodies of animals : moft of the 
difeafes, which take their rife from a cold damp air, pr^-vail 
here, fuch as rheums and pulmonary complaints ; but the 
fcurvy is the moft predominant difeafe and is attended 
with violent fymptoms, fuch as aching pains in the joints, 
and limbs, and hard livid fwellings : In lome cafes tumours 
are formed, which fuppurate and degenerate into fcrophu- 
lous runnings ; in fome inftances it affefts the judgment, and 
makes the unhappy fufferers put an end to their own exift- 
ence. Nervous fevers are very frequent ; the inflammatory 
and intermitting fevers are, little known ; the putrid fever 
has appeared but once thefe laft 20 years. Formerly the 
fmall-pox never appeared in the parifh, without proving fatal 
to one out of three whom they ieized. But the country people 
have been taught to change their way of managing childrea 
in that difeafe ; and fome are fo hardy as to inoculate their 
children with their own hand, fo that very few die of that 
diftemper. 

Rivers and Lakes. — The rivers of Ruthven, and Allan, 
both take their rife in the neighbourhood of Gleneagles. 
St Mungo's well is the fource of the firft, which, paffing the 
houfe of Gleneagles, takes its courfe eaftward, and falls into 
the Rarji, to the north eaft of Auchterardcr. The latter 
runs w'="ft through Strathallan, pafies Dumblane, and falls 
into the Forth, about a mile above Stirling bridge. Both 
thefe rivers abound with the common red trout- The Allan, 
whir'-- is fed by a .n'miber of rivulets from the neighbouring 
Ochils, is fometimes fo fwelled, as to lay a great part of the

flat ground, through which it runs, under water, but very 
feldoni does any confiderable damage, as the current is very 
gentle. There are two or three fmall lochs near the church, 
in which there are fome perches ; but the filh are not in fuch 
plenty as to make it worth while to carry them to market. 

^larries and Stones. — The ftone In this parilh is of a very 
hard quality. There is a large quarry wrought in Aber- 
cairney's lands, at the foot of the Ochils, which for many 
years furnilhed fine mill-fl:ones to all the mills many miles 
round ; it is ftill working, though the demand for mill- 
ftones is not now fo great as formerly. It alfo produces 
ftones for building, and takes a tolerably good polifli ; but, 
where it is much cxpofed to the weather, it is apt to wafte 
and fall to pieces. Of this ftone very good rollers are 
made. Befides the quarry ftones, there are vafl: quantities 
of large ftones fcattered upon the ground, fome of which lie 
on the furface, and others are buried in the ground, to the 
great hindrance of the plough. They are generally a hard 
blue whin, which cannot be broken without the aid of gun- 
powder ; the people begin now to remove them in that v.ay, 
and build dykes with them. 

^ladrupeds — The quadrupeds of a domeftic kind are the 
fame here as in every parifli in Scotland. Our country breed 
of horfes and cows are generally of a fmaller fize, than thofe 
in the low country. The fiieep were formerly fmall ; but 
fince great numbers of young flieep for breeding have been 
annually imported from the fouth, the fpecies is greatly im- 
proved in fize. 

Population, —In the year 1787, the number of fouls a- 
mounted to 1360, of which 650 were males, and 710 fe- 
males i 



of Blackford. 



males ; all of whom refide in the country, as there are no 
towns or villages in the parifh. In Dr Webfter's report, the 
number is i68r. Of late, feveral people have died betvfeen 
70 and 100, two men paft 90, and not a few paft 80. One 
woman of the name of Seton, died a few years ago at Black- 
ford, who, from hiftorical fadls which flie remembered, was 
fuppofed to be four or five years above 100. She retained 
her faculties perfeftly entire to the laft. Within the bounds 
of this parifh, there are 90 farmers, each of whom keep a 
plough, and whofe families amount in whole to 432 old 
and young; and, including fervants, male and female, to 559. 
But, befides thefe, there are 92 families, whofe numbers a- 
mount to 359, who live upon fmall pendicles of land. 

Produ8ions.^Tb,is parifh produces mofl: of the vegetables 
that are common in other parts of Scotland. No wheat is 
fown, except a little which Mr Haldane fows for the ufe of 
his own family. And it is but lately that the tenants have 
begun to raife peale, as they are apt to be deftroyed by our 
early hoar frofts, while they are green ; and if the harveft is 
rainy, it is difiicuit to fave them. Barley is more or lefs 
the produce of every farm ; the kind generally fown is the 
Chefter or rough barley ; but oats are what the tenants prin- 
cipally cultivate. In fome farms, they low a good deal of 
what goes by the name of gray oats, which are only valuable, 
becaufe they yield a pretty good crop upon our thin chan- 
nelly ground, where hardly any other grain will grow. Tur- 
nips, when they are fown in drills, and properly managed, 
grow to a very confiderable lize. Clover and grafs-feeds 
alfo produce tolerable good crops. Flax is raifed in great 
plenty, and is, for the moll part, of a very good quality. A 
peck of lint-feed, in a favourable feafon, will produce be- 
tween four and five ftones of flax. Potatoes thrive very well 

here, 



«o8 Staitftkal Account 

tere, and conftitute a great part of the food of the lower 
clafs of the people. Fruit trees do not fucceed, owing 
to the thinnefs of the Ibil, and the coldnefs of the climate. 
Barren trees of all kinds grow here ; but what feems moft 
adapted to the foil, is the fir, which thrives very well in our 
worll foil, in the wood of Gleneagles, there are a dozen or 
twenty fir trees, of the common kind, concerning which 
there is no tradition, when, or by whom they were planted ; 
they are exceedingly beautitiil, and fir light in the trunk, and 
of a conliderable length. One of tnem is lo feet in cir- 
cumference, at about four feet above the ground. The pa- 
riili, in general, fupplies itfelf with the neceflary articles of 
provifiiin ; and grain is frequently exported to Stirling and 
other towns. 

Fuel. — The fuel commonly made ufe of in this parifli, is 
peat and turf, of which there is great plenty. Since a good 
road was made through Gleneagles and Glendovan, which 
opens a pafTage to the fouth fide of the Ochils, a confider- 
able quantity of pii-coal is annually imported, and is ufed 
even by the common people. They are bought at the coal- 
liery of Blaingone, belonging to the Duke of Athole, about 
nine or ten miles from this, and coft the purchafer lod. for 
every 30 ftone upon the fj ot j an ordinary one horfe cart 
will bring home 30 or 40 ftone. The peats coft the people 
in the parifti nothing but the trouble of cafting them, and 
leading them home. 

Church.— The value of the living, by an interim decreet 
of the Court of Seffion, obtained by the minifter, Mr Archi- 
bald Moncricfis in the year 1727, is L.43 i? = ^ '5 in mo- 
ney, including L 5 for communion-element?. The ftipend 
paid in viftual is \^ chalder of bear, and the fame quantity

of oatmeal, with a glebe and pafture ground, confifting alto- 
gether of 1 7 or 1 8 acres. Charles Moray of Abercairney is 
patron. The heritors of this parifh arc ffiven in number ; 
the Duke of Athol Charles Moray of Abercairney, Colonel 
Drummond of Mahany, George Haldanc of Gleneagles, 
Alexander Campbell of Barcaldine, David Drummond of 
Duchaly, and William Graham of Orchil. None of thefe, 
except Colonel Drummond, Mr Haldane, and Mr Drum- 
mond, have manfion houfes in the parifli.' 

Poor, — It appears, by the regifter and books of accounts, 
from the Revolution to the prefent time, that, in the parilh 
of Blackford, the ordinary funds have anfwered the ends of 
public charity. At firft, very few applied to be taken upon 
the funds of the parifli : And, till the Seceffion began, 
the parifh being much united ; all, except a few Epifcopals, 
came to church, and contributed to the lupport of the poor. 
Thus more money was annually collected, than was expend- 
ed, in the courfe of the year. Hence the ftock rofe, and 
being laid out at intercft, and that intereft allowed to accu- 
mulate, the poor, in the year 1769, were poflefied of L. 280 
of ftock. About the year 1778, a farmer in the parifh be- 
queathed L. 50 to the poor. From the year 1 780, to the 
prefent year, the average annual fum received has been L. 33^ 
and the annual diftributions at an average amounted to L. 28. 

Antiquities — It does not appear that there ever was any 
raonaftery in this parifh. But there were feveral chapels, 
fome of which are ftill ftanding; and, before the year 1741;', 
public worfliip was occafionally performed in two of them. 
One is fituated at the houfe of Gleneagles, which is the 
burial place of the family, and another near the caftle 
of TuUibardine, which was built in the form of a crofs, in 

Vol. III. Dd tho 



2IO Sfaiijlical Account 

the 15th century, by one of the Earls of Tullibardine. In 
the choir of this chapel the Dukes of Athol formerly buried 
their dead. Befides thefe, there are the veftiges of two 
chapels in the ground of Mahany, at one of which there is 
ftili a burying ground, ufed by the people in the neighbour- 
hood. Ihere is the veftige of a fmall camp upon an emi- 
nence, fronting Gleneagles, which has a commanding prof- 
pe£t to the eaft, and was probably an out-poft, where a fmall 
party of the Romans kept watch, while the army was en- 
camped at Ardoch, five miles to the weft. The courfe which 
the Romans purfued in their marches from Stirling, eaft 
through Strathern, lies to the north of this parifh, where 
there are the remains of a Roman caufeway, called the Jlreet 
road. There is one barrow, a little eaft from the manfe, but 
it has never been examined. The common notion concern- 
ing it, is, that it is the burial place of fome great man. Per- 
haps it is of Druidical origin, and was one of thofe places 
where they kindled their facred fire. In different places of 
the parifli, there are circles of ftones, one in the parks of 
Gleneagles, one in the glebe, and another in the heights of 
SherifiFmoor. Thefe are fuppofed to have been places of 
Druidical worfiiip. In this parifli, the anceftors of the Duke 
of Montrofe had their ordinary refidence, at the caftle of 
Kincardine, which was burnt in the time of the Civil Wars,

party of M.ir's army, and taken by Argyle. Before the 17 .5, 
Lord George Murray and his family refided in it. Since 
that time it has been fuffered to go to ruin. 

Mifcellcweous Obfrvations — There are no mountains in 
this parifh, except a fmall i idge of the Ochils. It is not fo 
as the ridi-e to the fouth of it, which is feen from 
Edinburgh. It is covered for the moft part with fine paf- 
ture. 

We have frequent thunder and lightening in this pa- 
riOi, but no remarkable accident has ever happened by it. 
We are expofed to very violent gales of wind from the welt 
and fonthweft, which fometimes unroof houfes, blow down 
trees, and in harveft caufe a prodigious fliaking in the land- 
ing corns. About two years ago, a hurricane of this kind 
began about the weft end of the parifh, and continued in a 
direction north eart, for about a dozen of miles, and little 
more than three miles in breadth. The greateit part of the 
ilax was at the time fpread upon the ground, and, within the 
limits mentioned, it fwept the whole before it, rolled it into 
heaps behind dykes or hedges, or threw it into ditches and 
other hollow places. 

The parifli cf Blackford hath no peculinr advantages or 
difad vantages. Tiie names of places in it are for the mofl 
part Englhli, but iome few are evidently Gaelic. 

The people have nothing remarkable in their fize, 
ftrength, or features ; they are of the middle fize, of a dufky 
complexion, have a ferious turn, and are very zealous iu 
religious matters,

Stciti/tical Account 



The women are the only manufadlurers in this parifti. 
From the flax that is raifed in it, they fpin a good deal of 
linen yarn, and make many pieces of coarfe linen cloth for 
fale ; and, by their induftry, raife a part of the rent that is 
paid to the landlord. 

The roads in the diftridl are naturally good, owing to the 
gravelly foil. They are eafily kept up, and till lately, this 
was done by the ftatute labour, which was very ill perform- 
ed. They have now fallen into the method of commuting 
the ftatute labour for money, at the rate of from 8 s. to 12 s. each 
plough ; and little tenants and cottagers are charged fuch fmall 
fums as they are able to pay. Within thefe few years, bridges 
have been thrown over feveral rivulets which come from the 
Ochils, and in floods were very troublefome to travellers. 
Thefe were moftly built at the expence of the county. The 
late Sir William MoncriefF received L. 30 from the county 
funds, with which h? built three very necelTary bridges at 
^lackford.

{Counties of Roxburgh and Selkirk.') 



By the Rev. Mr SiMOK Hal I BURTON.</head> 



<p>Situation^ Extent ^ and Surface. 



HIS parlfli lies in the counties of Roxburgh and Sel- 



A kirk ; the greater part of it, however, is in that of Rox- 
burgh. It is in the prefbytery of Selkirk, and fynod of 
Merfe and Teviotdale. The parifli is of a fquare form, 
about feven Englifh miles long, and three broad. This pa- 
rifh may be called hilly, but moft of the hills are free from 
heath to their very tops. The foil in general is light, and in 
feveral parts fpongy. 

River and Lakes. — There is only one river in the pariflj, 
which runs through it from weft to eaft j it is called jile. 
There are four lakes within, and eight partly without the bounds 
of the parifti, none of them above a mile in circumference, 
all which difcharge their waters into the river Ale. This 
river abounds with trout. The lakes produce large trout, 
perch, and pike in confiderable numbers. 

Hor/es and Black Cattle The number of horfes is about 

140, and that of black cattle about 442. About 92 calves 

are

are bred yearly, part of which are difpofed of when fat, and 
part retained for keeping up the ftock. 

ProduBions, — There was formerly, perhaps, too much grain 
fown here, and the paffion for doing lb is ftill great. The average 
increafe is only three or four feeds, which plainly (hews, that 
the land is very ill cultivated, or better adapted for pafture than 
for corn. Many of the farmers have got pretty much into the 
ufe of raifing green crops, efpecially potatoes, cabbages, and 
turnips, which anfwcr well. Finding the great advantage of the 
latter, in feeding their fheep and black cattle, it is likely that 
they will continue to cultivate fuch kinds of crops. So 
much, indeed, has this practice prevailed of late, that there 
arc now 107 acres employed in this way. 

Land-rent and Heritors. — The land-rent is about L. 2009 
Sterling. Within thefe fifteen years it has rifen about a 
fourth. This increafe may be afcribcd to the melioration of 
the land by marl, from a mofs of great extent, which was 
drained about 15 years ago, as well as to the general rife of 
markets. There are nine heritors, only one of whom re- 
fides in the parifli. Sir Gilbert Elliot, Baronet, of Minto, is 
patron. 

Church. — In the month of April 1 790, the church was 
begun to be rebuilt, and is now nearly finifhed. The manfc 
was built in 1785. '1 he ftipend amounts to L. 57 rp -5 in 
money, and 90 bolls of viflual, one half oat-meal, one half 
barley, Teviotdale meafure.

90 fouls ; in Dr Webfter's report the number being 629. 
The people of this parilh are induftrlous, frugal, temperate, 
and devout. 

Fuei. — The fuel principally ufed is peat or turf, which 
are not abundant. The more wealthy parifliioners bring 
coals, for the ufe of their families, from Lothian, or from 
the Englifh borders. The places whence thefe coals are pro- 
cured are about 30 miles diftant from Alhkirk. 

Poor. — ^The number of poor who ftand upon the roll of 
the parifli is lo; they are maintained by affeflments, and 
the weekly colleftions in the church. The heritors affefs 
themfelves in a certain fum, to be raifed in proportion to 
their valued rents. The proprietor pays one half, the tenant 
the other, and the diftribution is made quarterly.

{Counties (f Roxhurgh and Selkirk.) 
By the Rev. Dr Alexander Duncan. </head>



<p>Name, Situatiotiy Surfaccy Extent^ isfc. 

SMALLHOLM is the name of the parifh. Whether it li 
derived from fmall-hanty a village, holm a wood, or 
Home^ from the town of Home, two miles diftant, which was 
formerly a garrifon and a caftle, is uncertain. It lies in the 
county of Roxburgh, in the prefbytery of Lauder, and 
fynod of Merfe and Teviotdale. It is in extent fomewhat more 
than three miles, from the north a little beyond the 34th 
mile ftone, on the high road from Edinburgh to Kelfo, to 
the 37th on the fouth. The form is irregular ; it is near 
four miles from weft to eaft, but at the eaft draws to a 
tongue, or fmall point. The turnpike road runs through 
the village, in the middle of which the church ftands. 
Statute labour, when exafted, never came to any account ; 
it Is now commuted. The country is a mixture of flat, 
and rifing grounds. The foil is in different places very 
various, but generally a mixture of clay ; though, upon 
the whole, when not too much of it is ploughed, or too 
often, it is thought to produce very good crops of oats, bar- 
ley, peafe. and fome wheat. The air is healthy, neither is 

the 



of Smallholin, 



the place liable to any topical or epidemical difeafe. The 
Village, and two other parts of the parifli, have rock for 
their bottom, and materials of that fort are got very near 
the public roads, to repair them. Of the difeafes, that pre- 
vail among labouring people, four fixths are fevers ; a phyfi- 
cian who praclifed a good many years in this country, faid 
that thefe difeafes abounded mofl: in years of plenty. 

Afjtlquiiies.— On the fouth weft corner of the parifli, 
ftands a large fquare tower, belonging to Mr Scott of Har- 
den. It is a beacon or land-mark at fea, to diredl fliips to 
Berwick } it is called Sandy- know, or Smallholm-tower. The 
hills or rifing grounds are covered with grafs for fheep paf- 
ture. This neighbourhood, on both fides of Tweed, was 
formerly the warlike part of the country, and expofed to the 
inroads of the EngHlh ; the lands, therefore, all lay run-rig, 
that when the enemies came, all the neighbourhood being 
equally concerned, might run to oppofe them. After the 
Union of the Crowns, this contention ceafed, and pro- 
perty became fafe. The ravages in former times were fu 
frequent, that there was no bifhopric in Scotland, fouth of the 
Forth, until Charles I. eredted the bifliopric of Edinburgh. 
In England, none were eredled further north than Chefter in 
the ftreet, and Lindiffern in Holy Ifland ; though on both fides 
of the border there were many abbacies. The reafon was, 
abbacies were reckoned holy houfes, and the people never 
touched them. But the bifliop, his palace, and furniture, Were 
reckoned fecular ; and therefore, on any inroad, the people, 
like the populace of Rome, on the fede -yrtfaw/^, accounted all his 
property lawful plunder. By this run-rig difpofition of lands 
in Scotland, the poffeffions were formerly very fmall ; but 
the people of fuch villages were more numerous. Now aU 
moft all thefe run-rig lands are divided. In the former lhape 
they were incapable of improvement. In this parifli, in the 

Vol. in. E e Years

2l8 Stai'l/lical Account 



years 1739 and 1740, 1800 acres of lands in run-rig were 
divided, and let into large farms. The villages and houfes 
formerly poflefTed by the fmall farmers, have fallen down, and 
the lands are let to one fixth part oi. the former number of 
tenants. This is one certain caufe of the decreafe of the num- 
bers of people in many places. Another is, young men going 
to the army and navy, many of whom never return. It was 
computed, that, during the two laft wars, 70,000 men were 
recruited or raifed in Scotland. It is alfo reckoned, befides 
thofe who have gone to North America, and to the Eaft or 
Weft Indies, that 10,000 journeymen wrights, carpenters, 
bakers, gardeners, and taylors, Sec. go yearly from Scotland 
to London. Many of them emigrate from this part of the 
country, failing from Berwick and Newcaftle, where the 
palTage is fliort and frequent, and the freight eafy. 

Population. — In 1700, the number of inhabitants was 600; 
jn 1743* the examination roll was 457 ; in 1790 it decreafed 
more than 100. In Dr Webfter's report the number of fouls is 
flated at 551. One effedl of the diminution of the numbers, 
is, in many places, to raife the price of labour. In 1744^ day- 
labourers here had 5d. or 6d. a day without viftuals; now they 
liave6d. or 8d. and victuals, and 10 d. or is. without them. 
The number of examinable perfons, who are inroUed after 
they are feven or eight years old, is 335 j of thefe 150 are 
males, and 185 females. 

Mi/cellaneous Ohfervations. — The public roads from fouth 
to north, through the middle of the parifli, were made by 
adt of parliament, and are fupported by the tolls. A good 
part of the parifh is inclofed, and is let at los. the Englifli 
acre. Since 1744, the wages of ordinary or houfhold fer- 
vants are doubled, and are now from L. 6 to L. 8 a man fer- 
vant in the year, and L. 3 or L.4 a woman fervant.

(County of Ayr.^ 
By the. Rev. Dr James Wright.</head>



<p>Situation and Name. 

MAYBOLE is fituated in Carrick, one of the three 
diftrifls into which the county of Ayr is divided. 
It is the principal village in Carrick. It feems to have 
derived its name from the ancient game called tl\e maypole. 
There is at Maybole a piece of level ground, confifting 
of upwards of an acre, called the Green of Maybole, 
which is ufed as a place of exercife for the fchool boys ; 
where, in former times, the people from feveral parts of the 
country ufed to alTemble, for the purpofe of enjoying the di- 
verfion of the maypole. 

Maybole confifts of a town and of a landward parifli. 

I. Town of Maybole. — Maybole is fituated on the ridge of 
a piece of high ground, with a dry bottom, and a fine fouth 
expofure. It is defended from the northerly and eafterly 
winds, by a range of high lands, which gradually fall 
back from the town, in the form of a fort of amphi- 
theatre. Maybole is amply fupplied with excellent wa- 
ter. This circumftance is pientloned, becaufe, toge- 
ther

ther with the dry bottom, and foutherly expofure, it ac- 
counts for the great health and longevity of the inhabi- 
tants. Within thefe five years, Mr David Doig, fchool- 
mafter at Maybole, died at the age of 104. About three 
years ago, a woman died here, aged 105. In this town 
there are at prefent 10 perfons, whofe ages put together, a- 
mount to upwards of 900 years. Maybole is a borough of 
barony, and enjoys as extenllve privileges, as any borough of 
the fame denomination in Scotland. Its charter is dated at 
Edinburgh, the 14th of November 15 16. There is at May- 
bole a very old building, commonly called the college, the 
walls of which are ftill ftanding ; and the area within is now 
ufed for the burying-place of the family of Caflillis. This 
houfe was built in the year 1371. It was the chapel or co\- 
legiate church of Maybole, and was both built and endowed 
by John Kennedy, a conneition of the Caflillis family. 
The charter of the edification and endowment of this chapel, 
was granted to John Kennedy of Dunure, by Robert II. 
King of Scotland, and by Walter, Lord Bifhop of Glafgow, 
within whofe diocefe the chapel lay. 

ManufaBures. — The woollen manufafture is carried on, in 
Maybole, to a greater extent than is commonly known. 
Eitrhty looms are employed in the town and country parifli 
of Maybole, in weaving woollen cloth for blankets ; and all 
thefe looms, except a very few, are in the town. Thefe 
looms employ, in the courfe of the manufadlure, about 300 
perfons, who are fo induftrious, that they manufaaure an- 
nually about 5600 ftones of wool, each ftone containing 24 
lib. averdupois. According to its quality, the wool is pur- 
chafed from s s. to 21 s. per ftonc. The cloth is fold from 
6d. to I s. 6d. per yard ; and from 20 to 40 yards are made 
from one ftone. It is wove from i d. to 2 d. per yard, and is 

fol4

fold at eight annual public markets, four of which are at 
Maybole, and four at Ayr. Within thefe twelve months, 
the cotton manufadlure has got a fmall footing at Maybole, 
in which 24 looms are employed. 

Population In the town of Maybole, there are 80© 

examinable perfons, that is, at or above eight years of 
age. 

School — ^The fchoolmafter has a falary of 200 hundred 
merks Scots, to which the heritors, many years ago, added 
100 merks more. The fchool-houfe, which is built at the 
foot of the Green of Maybole, is but an old mean thatched 
houfe, very unfultable to the eminent characters, which, at 
different times, have been educated in it. 

II. Landward Parifj of Maybole. — ^The country part of this 
parifti is very large and populous. In length from north to 
fouth, it is 12 miles, and in breadth from eaft to weft, 7. 

Rivers. — The rivers of Doon and Girvan, afford plenty 
of excellent falmon and trout. The Earl of Caffillis has 
the privilege of a falmon cruive, at the houfe of Caffillis, 
which ftands upon this river, on the march of the parifli of 
Maybole ; and his Lordfhip lets the falmon fifhing at the 
foot of the river, where it joins the fea, at the yearly rent of 

L. ICQ. 

Population. — In the country part of this parifli, befides 
thofe in the town, there are about 1700 examinable perfons. 
Within the laft 20 years, the population of the parifli has in- 
creafed by about 300 fouls. Among this numerous body of 
people, confifting of 2500 perfons, at and above the age of 

eight

eight years, there are only three Seceders, two women and 
one man J and even thefe came but lately into the parifli. 
The return to Dr Webfter being only 2058 fouls, it follows, 
that the population has increafed about 1000 fince 1755^ 
there being now about 3000 fouls in the parifh.

Poor. — 'The number of the poor in the parifh of Maybole 
is very confiderable, arifing partly from the great number of 
the inhabitants, and partly from the great influx of vagrants, 
particularly from Ireland. It may be faid, that in this pa- 
rifh the poor maintain the poor. Few of the principal heri- 
tors reflde in the parifh ; and nothing is given by them, in 

the 



of Maybok, 223 

the way of donation, to the poor, who are maintained 
wholly by the collections made at the church door, upon 
Sunday. For that reafon, though the contributions are 
very liberal, confidering the fmall fortunes of the pcrfons by 
whoai they are given, the poor of this parifli do not receive 
even one half of what they would require.

Namey Situation^ ^c. 

THE antient, and true orthography of the parifli, is 
Femell ; but it is ufually written Fernwell, or Farn- 
nvell, Femell is faid to be of Gaelic origin ; fern fignifying, 
in that language, a den, and nell, a fivan ; fo that it Ihould 
feem to have derived its name from an adjoining den, which, 
at that time, had been the abode of fwans. On the north 
fide of this den ftands an old caftle, once the refidence of 
the anceftors of the prefent family of Airly. The parifh 
church is about three Englifh miles fouth of Brechin. The 
parifli lies in the fliire of Angus, prefbytery of Brechin, and 
fynod of Angus and Mearns. It is about three Englifli 
miles long, and two broad. 

The parifli of Kinnaird, which lies between the pariflies 
of Fernell and Brechin, was disjoined from that of Fernell, and 
formed into a feparate parifli, about the year 1633. In the 
year 1771, at the inftance of the heritors of the pariflies of 
Brechin, Fernell, and Kinnaird, the Court of Sefllon annex- 
ed almofl: the whole of the parifli of Kinnaird to Fernell, 

and 



of Fernelh 



225 



and the reft of it to Brechin ; which annexation took place 
in the year 1787. 

&amp;/■/.— The foil is fertile, and generally low land, being fi- 
tua^ed in the middle of a flrath, which extends to Mon- 
trofe, about five miles diftant to the eaft. This part of the 
parifla confifts of a very fine clay and loamy foil, perhaps as 
gbbd as any in Scotland, and visi-y much refembles the foil of the 
Carfe of Gowrie, betwixt Dundee and Perth. The fouth and 
. weft part of this parifh is higher ground ; the foil alfo is of a 
different nature, and inferior quality, confifting chiefly of black 
earth. Some of the fields, in the eaft part of the parifli, 
are fubje(St to inundations, from a fmall river, which, taking 
its rife in the muirs, and being increafed by a number of fmall 
ftreams, fometimes in autumn fwells to an amazing fize, over- 
flows its banks, and breaks down the adjoining fences. 

Rivers.-^Tht only large river ih the parifli is the South 
Efk, which riles among the Grampian mountains, runs clofe 
by the fouth fide of the town of Brechin, and after mean- 
dering beautifully through the ftrath, difcharges itfelf into the 
bafon, formed by the reflux of the fea, on the weft fide of 
Montrofe. A confiderable part of this river forms the boun- 
dary of the parifh of Fernell, on the north. It abounds in 
falmon and falmon-trout ; and the fifhing upon that part of 
it, which now belongs to the parifli of Fernell, the property 
of Sir David Carnegie, in extent about two miles and a half, 
pays about L. 90 SterUng of yearly'rent. 

Popiilation.~An May 1791, there were living in the parifh 
620 perfons, of whom there were,

greater part of the parifh is inclofed ; the haughs or low 
grounds, where the foil is richeft, with thorn hedges ; and 
the others with fences of earth and whins, or with ftone 
dykes ; which laft is acknowledged to be the beft of any. 
Several improvements in this way have been carried oa 
of late years, and the farmers feem to be convinced of 
the benefit of inclofures. All the uninclofed ground is 
therefore to be inclofed by the heritors with ftone dyfces, the 
tenants paying the intereft. The farm houfes are in general 
very good; they, as well as the offices, being built of ftone, 
and covered with flate. The principal crops in the parifli 
are wheat, oats, barley, and peafe. The quantity of wheat 
fown here, has, for fome time, greatly increaled, and 
the clay foil is peculiarly adapted for it. This year there 
are about 150 acres of wheat fown. Of late, there has been 
almoft no Chefter bear fown, barley being preferred, on ac- 
count of its giving a greater return, and a higher price. A 
confiderable quantity of peafe, fome beans, and a great deal 
of clover and rye-grafs, are fown in the parifh ; and ufually 
about 30 acres of flax. Turnips and potatoes are a general 
crop all over the country. Yams are alfo fucctfsfuUy culti- 
vated for feeding cattle, and are faid to anfvver better with 

milk

milk cows than turnips, as the milk of cows fed upon them 
is not affeaed with the difagreeable tafte, which the turnips 
never fail to give it. Oats, peafe, and flax, arc fown from 
the beginning of March to the end of April ; barley, from 
the middle of April to the middle of May ; and turnips, 
from the middle till the end of June, and are generally 
fown in drills. September and Oftober are the months for 
fowing wheat. The harveft generally begins about the end 
of Augult, and, in ordinary years, the crop is got into the 
barn-yards before the middle of Odlober. The loamy ground 
is cultivated four years in tillage, and four years in grafs. 
The clay lands are cultivated in fix parts, viz. fallow, wheat, 
peafe, barley, clover, and oats. A greater quantity of every 
ipecies of grain, than is neceflary for the maintenance of 
the inhabitants, is raifed within the parifli. The unarable 
ground conlifts of pafture, wafte ground, and planting. The 
extent of the natural pafture cannot be exaflly afcertained ; 
neither can the meafurement of the land, denominated wafte 
ground, be given but it is neither extenfive nor ufelefs, as it 
ierves to fupply the inhabitants with broom or whins for fueh 
Of planting, there may be between 3 and 400 acres, the 
greater part of which is Scots fir ; but in the pleaftire 
grounds at Kinnaird, there is a great quantity of fine thriv- 
ing wood of all kinds. 

Church and School. — The ftipend of Fernell, now, in confe- 
quence of the annexation from the parifti of Kinnaird, is, 
303 bolls, 9 pecks meal ; 32 bolls oats; 67 bolls and a fir- 
lot Chefter bear, and L. 24 : 13 : 3 Sterling, communion ele- 
ments included j befides a manfe, garden, and glebe of about 
7 acres. The late Earls of Southefk were patrons of this 
parifli ; but, in confequence of the forfeiture of their eftate, 
^n the year 17 15, the right of patronage is now in the pof- 
feffion of the Crown. Sir David Carnegici Bart, of South- 



of FerncJL 22f 

eflc, is the reprefentative of the family, has his feat at Kin- 
naird, and is proprietor of all the parifh, except Little Fi- 
thie, a fmall eftate of about loo acres, the property of Wil- 
liam Gibfon, Elq; who refides upon it. The inanfe and 
church were repaired in the year 1752 ; and the fchool-houfe 
was built in the year 1747. The fchoolmafter's falary is a- 
bout L. 10 Sterling /(fr ; and he has, at an average, 

twenty- four fcholars, who are taught Englifli, writing, and 
arithmetic. 

Poor. — The number of poor in the parifh is, at an aver- 
age, 12. There is a mortification, by Dean Carnegie, of 800 
merks Scotch ; the annual intereft of which, together with the 
intereft of fome former accumulated colleftions at the church 
door, amount yearly to about L. J 9 Sterling, which is dil- 
tributed among the poor. The funds have rather increafed 
than diminifhed for fome years paft. No poor in the parifh 
are allowed to go about begging ; but this, as well as other 
pariflies in the neighbourhood, is much opprelTed by vagrants 
and fturdy beggars ; an evil generally complained of, but Hfe- 
yer attempted to be remedied. 

Wages. — About 40 years ago, the annual wages of the 
beft labouring man fervant was about 40 s. per annum ; at 
prefent, they cannot be hired under L. 7 Sterling. About 
40 years ago, maid fervants wages were about 20 s. per an- 
num ; now they are L. 3, or fomething more yearly, befides 
fome perquifites. 

Fuel. — The fuel in general ufed among the lower ranks of 
the people, for a long time paft, was turf, brought from 
IMonthrithmont Muir ; but that muir was, fome years ago, di- 
vided among the gentlemen of property in the neighbour- 
hood. 



Siaii/tical Account 



Jiood, and no turf was afterwards allowed to be carried onfc 

,of it. In confequence of which, fuel is a fcarce commodi- 
ty here ; and that now ufed by the lower ranks is the 
Ijranches of firs, which are pruned from the woods, or 

.fuch broom and whins as the uncultivated grounds afford. 

.Coals are alfo brought from Arbroath, about eight miles dis- 
tance, where they are bought for 6 s. or 6 s. 6d. per boll, 

,(72 ftone) free of any duty to government ; fo that they are 
I s. 6d. cheaper than at Montrofe, where the duty is levied. 
No peats can be had within 12 or 14 miles. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — In this parifh there are 60 carts 
and 40 ploughs, 20 of which are ploughs conftrudted for 
four horfes, and 20 for two horfes ; fo that the number of 
labouring horfes is 120. The number of black cattle is fup- 
pofed, at an average, to be about 600. There are no fheep 
kept in the parifli, as there are no hills or wafte ground to 
fupply them with pafture. The roads were formerly kept in 
repair by the tenants, who had their labour appointed accor- 
ding to the extent and value of their farms. Laft year the 
flatute ad took place, which converts the labour into money, 
at the rate of i 1. 4 s. Sterling for every L. 100 Scots of va- 
lued rent. There was colkdled laft year in this parifh, in- 
cluding the tax on faddle and work horfes, L. 3 1 Sterling, 
which is in future to be coUefted every year, for the purpofe 
of repairing the roads. There are no rnanufadtnres car- 
ried on here, all the people being employed in farming, 
except a few who follow handy-craft employments, fuch as 
taylors, wrights, fhoemakers, weavers, &amp;c. They are a fo- 
ber and induftrious fet of people, enjoying, in a reafonable 
degree, the conveniencies and comforts of fociety, and feem- 
ingly contented with their fituation and circumftances. 
There are no ale-houfes, nor is the want of them confidered 
by the people as an hardfliip.

{County of Eaji- Lothian.) 
Bv the Rev. Mr Alexander Davidson.-</head> 


<p>Extent and Situation^ 

THE parifh of Stenton lies within the county of Ha^i* 
dington, in the prefbytery of Dunbar, and fynod of 
Lothian and Tweeddale. The inland part of the parifli is 
about 2\ miles from north to feuth, and 3 from eaft to weft. 
It is called the inland part, becaufe a wing of the pal-ifh 
flretches fouthward into Lam'mermoor, to the diftance of 
about 10 miles from the church, and is there bounded by' 
the river Whitewater. 

Soli — There is a great diverfity of foil in this parifh ; al* 
moft all the variety comprehended between the ftrongefb 
clay and lighteft mould. The ftrata immediately below the 
foil, are chiefly free ftorie or gravel. Round the village of 
Stenton, and in fome adjacent fields, the ground is very 
ftoney ; the fmall ftones upon the furface lie fo thick, that m' 
fome fpots, when harrowed, fcarce any foil is to be feen, and 
yet in thefe very fpots, the crop is generally good, and fonie- 
times luxuriant. The ground in this neighbourhood is al- 
moft all inclofed, chiefly with ftone walls, from excellent 

free 



'^3^ Siatljilcal Accouni 

free ftone quarries, which are to be found almoft in ever^' 
field. 

Produ^iofjs.— The crops are the fame as elfewhere in Eaft- 
l-othian. The grain is in general good j but, in Latnmer- 
moor and its confines, the corn is of a very inferior quality. 
Fortunately, in that bleak country, they depend little upon 
Corn crops ; their flieep farms are their chief fupport. The 
paffion for the turnip crop feems to grow in this part of the 
Country, and is perhaps juftified by its fuccefs. 

Population. — The numbers in this parifli, by an accurate 
lift juft now made up, are 624 fouls. In Dr Webfter's re- 
port, the number is 631. For the laft io years the average 
of baptifms was - 14 

marriages - 3 

burials - _ y 

Poor. — Without the aid of alTeflments, the poor of this 
parifh are well provided for ; the truftees, at the fame time, 
take care that every individual fliall do the beft he can, for 
fupporting himfelf, and no encouragement is given to idle- 
hefs. They have a capital of about L. 500, moft of which 
has been bequeathed at different times by individuals of the 
family of Beild. The colleftions, added to the iutereft of this 
capital, afford the poor a decent and comfortable fupply. 
The poor here are under no temptation, and, indeed, they 
receive no encouragement to beg, becaufe they are aware of 
the confequence, that they fhould thereby be cut off from 
all parochial aid. But, though there are no vagrants from 
this parilh, the country Is perpetually harraffed, and perhaps 
never more fo than at prefent, by ftranger beggars, who pour 
in from all quarters, and greatly diftrefs the honeft and in- 
duftrlous,

<p>Extent, ^c. 

BEATH is a fmall inland parifh, about four Englifli miles 
long, and three broad, fituated on the weft end of the 
county and fynod of Fife, and prelbytery of Dunfermline. 
The Earl of Moray is patron. The value of the living is 
about L. 80 Sterling, including the glsbe, 

ProduBions. — The only crops it produces are oats, barley, 
peafe, beans, potatoes, and turnips; but no vsrheat, except what 
the minifter fows in his glebe. It is believed, however, that 
a great deal of wheat might be raifed, were the ground pro- 
perly prepared ; but the farmers feem to have a prejudice 
againft it. A great proportion of the land is in grafs, and 
produces excellent hay and pafture. The largeft of the cat- 
tle bring about L. i o or L. i 2 a head. Provifions of all kinds 
have rifen nearly one halt within thefe 20 years, except oat 
meal, which is the principal food of the common people. 
There is only one coalliery in the parilh at prefenr, be- 
longing to John Syraes, Efo; of Cartmnre j feveral othe;' feams 
of coal have been wrought formerly, and may ftill be wrought, 
as moft of the ground feems to contain that mmerai 

Vol. III. Gg Heritors, 



Statiftical Account 



Heritors^ ^^.^There are 15 heritors in the parifti, foup 
of whom are non-refident. Many of them farm their own 
lands, fo that the real rent of the parifli cannot be eafily 
afcertained ; but there are about 30 farms in the parjlh, great 
and fmall, which, taken at L. 50 each, at a medium, would 
make the whole rent L. 1500. About two thirds of the 
ground are inclofed, partly with ftone dykes, and partly with 
hedges and ditches. 

« 

There is no lime here, but plenty of ftone for building. 
* The whole of the furface is rugged and uneven, confifting 
of a great variety of little hills, or riling grounds, but no- 
thing that can be called a mountain. 

Population. — ^Theparifh contains about 100 families, which, 
allowing foniewhat more than four to a family, may amount 
in all to from 400 to 500 fouls. In Dr Webfter's report, the 
number is 1099. The population has decreafed confiderably 
within thefe 20 years ; owing, not to any epidemical diftem- 
per, for the people are very healthy, but principally to the 
practice of laying fo much ground into grafs, by which 
means the farmers carry on their labour with fewer ha»ds 
phan formerly. 

Poor. — There are nq beggipg poor her?, and only a few pen- 
fioners, generally from 10 to 12. Thefe arefupplied euher quar- 
terly, or occafionally, as they need. The funds are the ordi- 
pary collections, dues upon marriages, and burials, and the 
intereft of L. 100 due by bond to the feflion. 

Rivers, ^f. — ^I'here are only two fmall rivers in the pa- 
^'ilh, one of which rifes out of Loch Tilly, and drives two 
njj|Is, the only two in the |)arifti j there is alfo a lint 



(f Beaihi 2^ij 

mill, lately ere£lcd on a ne\w conftru^lion, which is drawn 
by a lingle horfe without water, and ferves for a barley mill 
at the fame time : this is confidered as a great improvement 
in this part of the country. Loch Tilly is a fmall lake, or 
piece of water, which feparates i3eath from Dunfermline, and 
abounds with pikes and perches. 

Curiofttles. — The greateft curiofity in the parifh is the 
hill of Beath, the fouth weft paf-t of which affords a moft 
delightful and extenfive profpen: of the Frith of Forth, 
the three Lothians, and many of the neighbouring counties ; 
it is covered with a beautiful green fvvard, and affords excel- 
lent fhcep pafture. From the top, there is certainly one of 
tha fineft landfcapes in Scotland. This hill is frequently 
vifited by ftrangers, for the fake of the extent and beauty of 
the profpeft. 

School. — The parochial fcKool is the only one in the parjfh; 
the falary is loo merks Scots. The ntimber of fcholars is 
about 30 ; the living altogether doe^ not exceed L, 15 or 
L. 16 a year.

C County of Aberdeen.) 
By the Rev. Br Samuel Copland. </head>



<p>SHuatiortf Extent, Isfc. 

THE parifli of Fintray, the origin and import of whofe' 
name are unknown, is fituated in the county of Aber- 
deen, and in that divifion of the county called Formartin. 
It is alfo within the bounds both of the prefbytery and fy- 
nod of Aberdeen. The pariQi contains about 10,00© acres 5 
and extends nearly five Englifh miles in length, and four in 
breadth. Its form refembles that of an Irifh harp. The na- 
tural boundaries are the Don, which feparates it from 
Dyce, Kinnellar, and Kintore ; the burn of Danemiln, which- 
feparates it from Keith-hall ; and fome rifing grounds, and 
fmall rivulets or burns, feparate it from the other pariflies. 
The parifli is hilly, but not mountainous. The highway, 
running fouth-eafl: from Danemiln to Aberdeen, divides the 
arable ground almofb equally : That part of it, which is on 
the weft and fouth-weft of the high-way, is generally a rich 
loamy foil. The haughs efpecially are very rich grounds ; 
and this parifta contains feveral hundred acres of haugh, the 
greater part of which however is lubje£l to be overflowed by 
the Don. The ground rifes from the river to the back part of 
the parifli nearly 300 feet 5 and the foil is much worfe, con- 

fifting 



of Fintr^'ji 



fiftlrrg partly of peat mofs, and partly of moor, interfperfcd 
with patches of arable land, fome of which is a ftrong clay foil* 

River. — The river Don produces falmon and very fine 
trout ; but the cruives, which are fituated near the mouth of 
the river, greatly diminilh the value of the higher fi(h« 
ings, and have given rife to many difputes between the heri- 
tors of the upper parts of the river, and the proprietors of 
thefe cruives. A late decreet arbitral has been obtained, 
which, it was thought, would have terminated thefe dilutes; 
but a procefs is now depending again ft the proprietors of 
the cruives, for not obeying this decifion. A great inunda- 
tion of the Don, in 1768, carried off the whole crop on the 
haughs. 

Population^ ^c. — The population has decreafcd withire 
Ihefe few years. At prefent the number is 920. The 
number of both fexes, below 15 years old, is 341 ; a- 
bove 15, there are 579. At a medium of ten years, 
the number of deaths is 16; — of births 19 ; — of marriages 4, 
Out of 500 children, whofe names are recorded in the pa- 
rifli regifter, 274 are males, and 226 females. There are 
220 families in the pari fli, of which 4 perfbns are black** 
fmiths ; 1 3 are houfe-carpenters ; i o are taylors ; 7 are 

weavers ; 5 are mafons ; i dyer, and 9 are flioemakers . 

The number of inhabitants in Dr Webfter's report, is ^q^^ 
fouls. — There are 808 black cattle, 182 horfes, and 
flieep. 

Produaions and i2^?i/.—The productions of the parifh are 
oats, bear or big, rye, barley, and peafe. Yams, or horfe po- 
tatoes, have been lately introduced with fuccefs. Potatoes 
and turnips are becoming very general. The rent of the pa-

rifh is fuppofed to be L. 1300 Sterling. The valued rent ia 
L. 3007 Scots. 

Advantages and D'lfadvaniages. — The difadvantages of the 
parifti are, the poverty of the inhabitants, fhort leafes, and 
diftance from lime or marie. Peat mofs is alfo becoming 
fcarce. This would really be an advantage, if the abfurd 
and oppreffive tax on coals were repealed ; which puts it out 
of the power of poor people to purchafe coals. The advan- 
tages of this parifti are its fouthern expofure, which renders 
the harveft earlier, than that of the adjacent pariflies ; 
and the neighbourhood of Aberdeen, to which the inhabi- 
tants can go to market, and return the fame day. Some 
long leafes have lately been given, where the rents rife at dif- 
ferent periods of the leale, and which tend much to encou- 
rage agriculture. Three of the farmers, who took thefe 
leafes, came from the county of Angus. Good land generally 
rents at 20 s. per acre ; poor out-field, as low as 2 s. or 3 ?i 
The latter, in the way the tenants manage it, is the deareft. 

Church. — The ftipend is 5 chalders of vi£lual, one third 
of which is bear, and 440 merks in money. The glebe conlifts 
of 6 acres of arable land, and an acre and an half of poor 
grafs land. The heritors are. Sir William Forbes, who is 
alfo patron of the parilh, and proprietor of confiderably 
more than the half of it ; Mr Skene of Skene, who has 
nearly one third part •, Mifs Dyce of Dirblair, and William 
Johnftoun portioner of Wefter Blair. 

PoQf, The number of families, on the poor's roll, is at 

prefent 16. The yearly coUedions are L. 18 or L. 19. It 
may be proper here to obferve, that the late Sir Arthur For- 
bes, when in the decline of life, being unable, as formerly, to 

be 



bJ Fintray, 131^" 

be prcfent at public worfliip, always fent a fum of money e- 
very Sunday for the poor, not only from himfelf, but col- 
Iefreci from all the company, who refided at his houfe, and 
did fi.ot attend. This was a confiderable fource of fupport to 
the poor ; and affords an excellent example, in thofe parts 
of the north of Scotland, where the heritors and inhabr.ants 
are not aflelTed by law, as is ufual in the louthern diftricts. 

Mifcellaneous Ob/ervotions. — There are nearly 300 acres 
planted with Scots fir, in general interfperfed with oak, alh, 
elm, plane, beech, birch, larix, fpruce, filver fir, and other 
foreft trees. — The lands now, are commonly ploughed with 
weak horfe ploughs. Formerly ftrong oxen ploughs were 
ufed. Since the introdtjftipn of horfe ploughs, the number 
of cattle has diminished, at leaft one half. I hat of Iheep in a 
flill greater proportion — One perfon, aged 96, died lately, 
and there are feveral now alive above 90 years old. The peo- 
ple are in general induftrious ; but the knitting of llockings, 
which is here carried on to great extent, is too fedentary an 
employment, and is often hurtful to the conftitution. The 
farmers, in general, are but in middling circumftances : Their 
condition would be much meliorated, by giving them long 
leafes. The largeft farm here, confifts of about 300 acres of 
arable land. The parifli, in general, is uninclofcd, except 
what the proprietors have in their own hands. The roads 
are now in prer'^y good repair j and bridges are laid over all 
the burns, or fmall rivulets in the parifh.

<p>Name, Extent^ is'c. 

THE name of the parifh is Culfalmond. It is fituated in 
the county and fynod of Aberdeen, and prefbytery 
of Garrioch. In length it is three and one half miles, and in 
breadth three miles. There are two little hills in the parifh, 
called Corfdow and Culfalmofid, which are covered with heath, 
and abound with fine blue flate, which is carried to confider- 
able diftances. The reft of the parifh is quite level, and of 
a deep fertile foil. The air, in the fpring, is a little foggy, 
but very few diftempers prevail. The only river is the Urie, 
running the whole length of the parifh ; but, as it is fmall, 
trouts alone are caught in it. The diftance from the fea is 
25 Englifti miles. 

Population, — With regard to the population of the parlfli,this 
can be traced no farther back than 36 years. It was then more 
populous than at prefent, owing to the improvements made by 
the proprietors, which led them to take muchground into their 
own hands. But as the whole parifh, in the courfe of 25 years, 
has gone to new owners, the population is increafing by people 

coming 



of Culfahnondo 241 

coming from other places, and taking the wafte farms. The 
prefent inhabitants are, males, 314; females, 304; in whole 
618. In Dr Webfter's report, the number is 810. The an- 
nual average of births, for fix years, is 16 ; of deaths 8, and 
of marriages 5. Under 10 years of age, 116; between that 
and 20 years, 84. All, the people attend the Eftabhflied 
Church, except 9 Scceders. 

ProduBions.—T\\t productions of the parifli are oats, baf-^ 
ley, turnips, and a very few peafe. As the ground is fer- 
tile, good crops are obtained. The produce is more than 
double of what is fufficient to maintain the inhabitants. The 
number of horned cattle is 648 ; horfes of the fmall kind 
166; fheep, 850, and they annually rear up 140 calves* 
It is not above 26 years fince the planting of timber began ; 
now there are extenfive plantations, all thriving well, con- 
fifting of larix, fpruce, Oak, afti, elm, beech, birch, moun- 
tain afh, and Scots fir. Inclofing began at the fame time, 
and is found to be a very great improvement. 

Heritors y &amp;c. — The parifh is divided among four proprietors, 
viz. Colonel M'lntofti of Newton, who is the only refiding 
heritor ; Leith of Freefield ; Gordon of Ardmeallie, and 
the heifs of Innes of Breda. The whole rent does not ex- 
teed 1 150 I. ftipend included, which, one year with another, 
may amount to 70 I. including the value of the glebe. 

Fuel. — The only fuel is peat and turf ; of which there are 
great abundance, except in one corner of the parifh.

<p>Situation and Surface. 

THIS parifh' is fituated in tJie county and fynod of FifeV 
and in the prefbytery of Cupar. It is of an irregular 
form, extending from rhe foutH-eaft, to the north-weft, twd- 
Scots miles, and from the fouth-weft, to the north-eaft, near- 
ly as much. Its general appearance is that of a gently rifing 
ground. There are in it two hills of a moderate height-", 
from which are very extenfivc profpefls. The one is called 
Foodie^ the other Craigfoodie^ and both of them are remark- 
able for bearing good crops nearly to their tops. The foil 
in this parifh is for the moft part fertile, and in many places 
rich and deep. The air is generally dry and healthy. There 
are no confiderable rivers in this diftrifl, except the Eden, 
which forms its boundary to the fouth and fouth-eaft, and, a 
little farther on, runs into the Eaftern ocean. It abounds 
with excellent trout, and a few fahnon are fometimes caught 
in it. The fifti are moftly taken by the rod, and very few- 
are ever fent to market. 

Population. — This parifii contains 540 perfons. In Dr 
Webfter's report, the number of fouls is 469. There are 1 1 

farn9 



.tf/" Dairfie, ^243 



/arms here of different extent, from 330 down to 60 acres. 
The parifh is laboured by about 24 ploughs. Every two 
ploughs employs at leaft three men, two for the ploughs, 
and one for the barn and other work. A farmer having two 
ploughs of land, commonly keeps two boys for taking care 
of the cattle, and two women, chiefly for harveft work. 
The population of this parifli is not materially different from 
what it was 18 years ago. There are, upon an average, fiye 
marriages, and 13 births. 

Cattle and Produclioiis. ^There are no flieep-in this parifh. 
There are about no horfes, 400 cows, oxen, and young 
cattle. Of wheat there are fbwn about 190 acres. Sowing 
artificial gralfes^ and the cultivation of potatoes and turnips^ 
have of late exceedingly increafed. About 20 acres or morp 
are annually fown with flax feed. 

Chunk and Poor. — Tlie ilipend of this parifh is five and a 
half chalders of vidlual, and about L. 28 in money, with a 
manfe and a glebe of fix acres. The church was built by 
Archbifliop SpottiiWood, in 1622, when he was proprietor of 
the eflate of Dairfie. In the old houfe near the church, it is 
faid, that he wrote his hiflory. The church is a remarkably 
neat and well proportioned building, having a flat lead roof, 
and a fpire on the fouth wefi corner. Its fituation is beauti- 
ful and pifturefque. The manfe was built in i 749. Befides 
Mifs Scot, who is proprietor of a great part of this parifh, 
there are four other heritors, none of whom, except a minor, 
refide in the place. There are four or five perfons fupport- 
ed by the poor's funds. The contributions for the relief of 
the poor on the Lord's day are from 3 s. to 3 s. 6 d. weekly. 

Mifcellaiteous Obfervaiions. — In this p?.rifli are fevcral good

whin ftone quarries, which are eafily got at, and good free 
jftone is to be had, at different places not far diftant. Ex- 
cellent cattle are bred in the neighbourhood, which, when 
three or four years old, bring, in the market, from fix 
to ten guineas. This parifh derives confiderable advantage 
from its fituation, being about four computed miles from the 
Frith of Tay, ajjd nearly the fame diftance from St Andrews, 
to both which the farmers fend a great deal of grain. Coal 
is the fuel generally ufed here, and cofts 2 s. 8 d. at the pit, 
for the double horfe cart. The ploughs formerly ufed here, 
Vttre drawn by four oxen and two horfes ; now they are 
inade much lighter, and drawn by two horfes only. There 
is nothing peculiar either in the ftrength, fize, or ftature of 
the inhabitants, who in general live eafy, and are difpofed to 
be indufrrious. They are a plain and frugal people, and en- 
Joy, in a reafonable degree, the comforts and advantages of 
fociety. There is a good bridge here over the Eden, confift- 
ing of three arches, faid to h^ve been built by Archbifhop 
Spottifvvood. The roads in this neighbourhood are as yet in 
bad repair. The ftatute work is commuted. Turnpike roads 
are juft beginning to be made. Some of the bed land In 
this parifli has been lately let at about 40 s. the acre ; other 
farms rent from 15 s. to 20 s. The parifli in general is un- 
inclofed. There is hardly any alteration in this place more 
remarkable, than the change in the people's drefs, which, 
^vithin thcfe 20 years, has become much gayer than formerly.

(County of InvernefsJ) 
By the Rev. Mr Roderick M'Leod.</head> 



<p>Situation, Surface, isfc, 

nrTIIS parifh is fituated in the county of Invernefs, in the 
"T- ifland and prefbytery of Sky, and provincial fynod of 
Glenelg. It is of an irregular form. The length of the in- 
habited part is about 1 7 computed miles. The breadth in 
one part is feven, and in other places about four comput- 
ed miles. It is interledted by arms of the fea in different 
direiflions. The furface, in general, is hilly, with fonie plain 
fpots adjacent to the fea. The foil in fome parts is fertile; 
the air is moift and foggy, but not unhealthy, owing to the 
frequent breezes of wind. There arc no confiderable lakes 
or rivers, and none that are navigable ; though there arc 
many rapid waters, Tvhich are frequently attended with in- 
convenience, difficulty, and danger, to people travelling from 
one part of the parilh to the other. The fliore is flat in 
fome places, but for the moft part high and rocky. There 
are various kinds of fifh upon the coaft, but they are not 
caught in any confiderable quantity } which may, perhaps, bp 
owing either to want of pains, or of proper encouragement. 
Sea-waiw, in ibme farms, is ufed for manuring the land. I'he 
greateft number of farms in the parifli have no kelp, and fuch 
" ■ ' of 



StaiijTical Account 



of them as have any, manufafture it only once every two or 
three years. The average quantity of it cannot be accurately 
afcertained, but may be about 50 tons. The principal bays, 
or harbours, ^re Loch-Bracadale, a good and fafe harbour, 
Loch-Harport, a confiderable branch of Loch-Bracadale, 
where velTels may ride with fafety, and Loch-Eynart, at the 
diftance of feven computed miles fouth of Loch-Bracadale, 
where veflejis fometimes refort. South of that, at the dif- 
tance of three computed miles, is Loch-Brettle, an open bay, 
and not a fafe harbour. The iflands in this parifli are Ha- 
verfay, Vuiay, Oranfay, Soay. Thefe iflands are not inhabit- 
ed, but are only pendicles to the different farms on the 
fhore that are oppofite to them, and afford pafture for cattle, 
during part of the fummer and winter feafons. Oranfay is a 
peninfula. There are no remarkable mountains within the 
parifli ; but a confiderable ridge of very high and lofty 
hills, (the foreft of the ifland of Sky) run betwixt this parifli, 
and the parifli of Strath, and are the property of Lord M'Do- 
jiald, Colonel M'Leod, and Mr M'Alifter of Strath. Aird. 
They are commonly called Cidititi^ a name conjeftured by 
fome to be derived from the famous Cuchulmn^ fo often men- 
tioned in Oflian's poems. The tops of thefe hills are rocky, 
but there are hollows, or valleys between them, frequent- 
ed by deer, and which likewife afford pafture to differ- 
ent kinds of cattle in the fummer feafon. The hills within 
the parifh are for the mofl: part covered with heath, mixed 
with fome fpots of grafs, and afford good fummer pafture for 
horfes, flieep, and cows. The parifli, in general, affords 
good grazing for black cattle, and fome parts of it are good 
pafture for flieep. 

• 

Population., — With regard to the population in the parifli, 
the prefent amount is about 2250 fouls. In Dr Webfter's 

report, 



tf Bracadale, 247" 

fcporty the number Is 1907. This increafe is the more re- 
fnarkablc, as it has taken place, notwithftanding emigra- 
tions at different times to foreign parts. If there had been 
no emigrations, the number of people would have been con- 
fiderably greater. From 1771 to 1774* 128 fouls emigrated. 
In Auguft 1788, about 200 fouls went frc^ni' this pari'fli tct 
North America", and about the fame ntimber In Oftober 
1790. The number of males will be upwards of a third 
more than that of the females. There are no cowhs nor vil- 
lages in the parlfh. The annual average of births is 40, of 
deaths 16, of marriages 20. All the Inhabitants are of the 
eftablifhed church, except twb Epifcopalians ; there are no 
SecederS, and no Roman Catholic?. 

ProduEl'ions. — This parlfh produces black cattle, flieep, 
and horfes. Black cattle is the main ftaple, of which 
numbers are fent to the Englilh markets every year ; from 
the returns of which the people pay their rents, and fupply 
themfelves with neceflaries. There are fmalt quantities of 
ftieep on each farm, but there is no farm laid out entirely 
in flieep pafture. The breed of horfes is generally fo fmall, 
that each farm mtifl: keep a number of them for leading 
their peats, (which is their chief fuel), for leading manure, 
and for labouring the ground. The parifli does not al- 
ways fupply itfelf with provifions, but frequently imports 
grain from other countries. There is neither hemp, nor flax, 
raifed here, but there are much greater quantities of hay 
than there was 20, 30, or 40 years ago ; all from natural 
grafs. The people in general cultivate fmall oats, which 
they fow in the months of March and April, and reap in 
the months of September and OiSlober. Their barley and 
potatoes they fow in the month of Apri], and reap in the 
months of Augufl; and September. 

With 



Stati/lical Account 



With regard to the advantages and difadvantages of the 
parifli, it is, like the whole of this part of Scotland, fitter for 
grazing and rearing cattle or flieep, than for corn. 

Language — The Gaelic is the principal language fpokcn in 
this parifh. As to the names of places, fome of them are 
derived from the Gaelic ; but it has been always believed, 
that, fince the encroachments of the Pi£ts and Danes, the 
ftames of many places in this, as well as in the greateft part of 
the Weftern Ifles, are derived from the Danifli. 

Churchy ^c. — The land rent of this parifli is about L. looo 
Sterling. The prefent ftipend is looo merks Scots, the 
■*Fhole living, including the glebe, is upwards of L, 60 Sterling. 
Colonel M'Leod of M'Leod is patron and fole heritor. There 
are two churches in the parifh, at the diftance of feven or eight 
computed miles from each other, wh6re the minifter preaches 
alternately, one of which was built above 40 years ago, and 
was repaired in 1783. The other was raifed upon the ruins 
of an old chapel, and is at this time in a very ruinous ftate.- 
The manfe was built in 1789. The number of poor who re- 
ceive alms in the parifh is about 170. They are chiefly fup- 
plied by the Sunday collections. 

AntlqtiHies. — There are different places in the' parifh, 
vhcre there have been burial grounds, and vefliges of houfes, 
that feem to have been places of worfhip in ancient times. 
There is one Danifli fort lefs than a computed mile from the 
manfe. A great part of the outer wall of it is ftill entire, 
made up of large dry flones, without mortar, or any kind of, 
apparent cement, but very regularly and artificially laid toge- 
ther, and traces of apartments within. There is likewife 
another fort of the fame kind, at the diftanpe of about 13 

computed 



of Bracadak, 



249 



compated miles, and fituated at one extremity of this pariOi. 
There are feveral of the fame form in different parts of this 
country, and are all built upon eminences or rifing grounds. 
There is, at the diftance of about a computed mile from the 
manfe, a fubterraneous cavern or grotto, artificially built 
with ftone within, and the top laid over with earth, fo that 
it cannot be feen till a perfon is clofe at the entry, which is 
narrow and difficult of accefs. It is believed, that all thefe 
fubterraneous caverns were ufed as places of flieltcr or con- 
cealment in perilous times. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervathm. — There are no turnpike roads 
nor bridges in the parifh. There have been fome attempts 
to make a general road through the parifh, partly by flatute 
labour, and partly by raifing money ; but the roads are flill, 
for the raoft part, in a wretched flare. With regard to in- 
clofures, there are in general no flone incloflireg ; there arc 
fome feal dykes, which get an annual reparation. There are 
fome other kinds of ditches, or feal dykes of a more durable 
form.

(County of Murray.) 
, ' By the Rev. Mr G. Cruickshank.</head> 

<p>Situation, Soil, ^c. 

THIS parifli lies along the bank of the Spey, on the 
north fide, and is in a great meafure furrounded with 
hills, wliich are all covered with heath. The foil is general- 
ly dry and fandy, and the crops are, for the moft part, oats 
and bear. The culture of green crops is not very extenfive- 
ly praftifed. There is neither lirae nor marie in the parifli. 
Salmon are caught in the Spey, and commonly fell for 4d. 
a pound, during the months of March, April, and May, and 
afterwards from 3d. to id. per pound. 

Population. — In the old parifli of Rothes there are 1000 
•fouls, and in that part of the parifli of Dundurcas, which 
was annexed to Rothes about feven years ago, there are 
about 500, fo that the parifli of Rothes, at prefent, contains 
about 1500 fouls. In Dr Webfter's report, previous to the 
annexation, the number is 746. The population has greatly 
increafed of late, owing to a village that is built at Rothes, 
which contains about 300 young and old. 



fleritorst

Heritors. — There are four heritors in the parifli, namely. 
Lord Findlater, who has about two thirds of i'. ; Sir William 
Gordon of Gordonfton, Baronet, who has the lands of Inch- 
beary and Gerbety j the Honourable Arthur DufF of Orton, 
who refides at Orton, and Mrs M'Dowal Grant of Airndelly, 
who has the lands of Ackenway. 

Antiquities. — There are the ruins of an old Caftle, which 
gives title to the noble family of Rothes, which was once the 
relidence of the Earls of Rothes, from whom all the Leflies 
are defcended. It now belongs to Lord Findlater.

ProduSliotis, 



ojnjk. 



ProduBiorts.— The farmers fow a good deal of wheat. 
About 1 2 or 15 years ago, there was very little wheat fown ; 
but now they fow, one year with another, 150 bolls, in the 
extent of one or two and twenty ploughs of land. As the 
barony lands in this parifh are upon the Tay, the fanners 
have their barley, which is efteemed very good, fhipped off 
in cargoes to other places ; but, before the demand from the 
diftilleries, &amp;c. they often found it difficult to procure a mar- 
ket for their grain. They have now got threftiing-mills in- 
troduced, which will forward their operations not a little. 

Hilisi — There is a very large hill, called Norman's Lan/f 
\frhich rifes from the level of the Tay, upon two eminences, 
one above another. From this hill there is ar moft extenfivd 
profpedl. The common opinion, as to the: Origin, of thd 
name Norman^ is, that the Norwegians, in their piratical in- 
curfions, did, for fome time, encamp upon this hill. This 
traditional account is favoured by the appearance of an in- 
trenchment round the fummit. 

Sheepi — There is not a flieep in this parilli, nor indeed, 
from the prefent mode of farming, can (heep be kept, unlefs 
the low lands, as well as the hilly grounds, of which therar 
is a vaft extent, were inclofed.

<p>Situation^ Extent^ Surface. 

THIS parifh lies in the county of Tweeddale, or Peebles. 
The weftern boundaries of the parlfli are alfo the 
boundaries of the fhire. It is in the prefbytery of Biggar, 
and fynod of Lothian and Tweeddale. It is two miles and 
a half long, and nearly the fame in breadth. The general 
appearance of the furface is uneven. We have no moun- 
tains j but there arc three fmall green hills in the parifh. 
On part of two farms there is fome fhort heather* The foil 
is fertile, though generally light. Being much above the 
level of the fea, the air is pure and wholefome. Owing to our 
high fituation, the crops are often damaged by frofls, which 
fometimes fet in about the middle of Augufl. The houfe 
of Skirling appears, by the vcfliges of the walls, to have 
been large. It was furrounded by a morafs or bog, ex- 
cept a fmall fpace on the fouth-weft fide, and that was de- 
fended by turrets. The entry to the houfe was by a bridge 
of flone over this bog. 

Fairs — We have four annual fairs here ; the flrfl on the 
Tuefday before the 12th of May; the fecond on the 3d 

Tuefday 



of Skirling. -255 

Tuefday after the iith of May; the third on the firfl:

ProduB'tons. — Natural grafs is found here on the hills and 
plains. White clover grows fpontaneoufly in fome fields. 
We have pot-herbs of all forts, and various kinds of afli, 
elm, beech, plane, and fir trees. A great part of the parifli 
has lately been fown with grafs-feeds for pafture. There are 
between 70 and 80 horfes in the parifh. The chief crop 
here is oats, with which between 300 and 400 acres are an. 
nually fown. Each acre, at an average, will produce between 
5 and 6 bolls. Between 30 and 40 bolls of peafe are the ut- 
inofi; that arc fown in one year ; this crop being moffc readily 
damaged by frcfi:. Potatoes and turnips thrive in this foil. 
An acre of potatoes planted in the drill way, with the 
plough, will produce about 20 bolls Linlithgow meafure, 

and

and fell for between 4 s. and 5 s. a boll ; cows and horfcs 
feed well on them. Every fanner here fows five or fix 
lippies of flax-feed ; cottagers and thofe who have fmall 
poffeflions, two or three lippies. Each lippie produces be- 
tween 12 lib. and a ftone of fcutched flax. The wafte 
ground in this parifh ferves for fheep walks ; and there may 
be of fuch ground between 70 and 80 acres. 

Church. — ^The living here is L. 38 : 17 ; 8 ; one chalder of 
bear, 175 bolls of meal ; a manfc and a glebe, containing 
7 acres, 3 roods, and 19 falls. John Carmichael of Skirling, 
fucceflbr to the late Lord Hyndford, is patron. The church 
here was probably firft built as a chapel of eafe for the pro- 
prietor and his tenants. It appears to have been rebuilt in 
1720. The manfe was built in 1636 ; and rebuilt in 1725. 

Poor.-^T\\z perfons receiving charity here, at prefent, are 
one family of five children, another of two, and two fingle 
perfons. None of thefe receive weekly or monthly pen- 
fions, except one perfon. They only receive, occafionally, 
fuch fupplies as we are able to aflbrd, from the colleftions in 
the church, the hire of the mort-cloths, and for proclama- 
tion of banns. The whole of thefe may amount to between 
L. 4 and L. 5 per annum. We have no flock, but a few 
pounds to anfwer any extraordinary demand. 

Fuel. The fuel here is moftly coal, which is brought 

from the diftance of 15 miles. There is only one mofs in 
the parifli, which is nearly exhaufted. 

Mifcellaneous Obfirvations. — In this parifli there are 10 far- 
mers. One of thefe poflefles five farms. Other two poflefs 
two farms each. Each of thefe 10 farms contain, at an 

average. 



average near 200 acres. The rent, at an average, is 4 s. pet^ 
acre. Befides thefe ten farms, there are ten fmaller poflell 
fions about this village, which are inclofed with hedges and 
ditches^ and with behs of planting. They are rented at 20 s. 
and 25 s. J)er acre. There is a map of the parifh in the hands 
of Cornelius Elliot, Efq; writer to the fignet. I fuppofe 
there are between 2000 and 3000 acres in it. The roads id 
this parifli, are, at prefent, in bad repair, owing to a great 
part of the lead, from LeadhUls and Wenlockhead, paffing 
from one end of it to the other. The ftatute labour is exadt-^

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6415847">DURRIS</name>. 

{County of Aberdeen.') 
By the Rev. Mr William'Strachan.</head> 



<p>Name and Situatioti, 

*■ I ""HE antient name of the parifh, as appears by Tome old 
^ manufcripts in my pofleffion, is Dtiires. The mo- 
dern name is Durris or Dores. The word Duires, fignifies, in 
the Gaelic language, the Mouth of the Highlands. The parifli 
of Durris lies in the county of the Mearns, and in the pref- 
bytery and fynod of Aberdeen. Its form is nearly that of 
an oblong fquare. It is about four or five Scots miles long ; 
and two and a half broad. The appearance of the coimtry 
is, in fome parts, flat, and in others mountainous. Part of 
the Grampian hills run along the fouth fide of the parifh. 
The foil, near the river fide, is generally thin and fandy. 
There are, however, two pieces of flat ground, viz. thofe of 
Durris and Balbridie, of a deep foil. That of Durris is moft- 
ly inclofed and fubdivided. A good part of it has, of late, 
been improved ; and now produces excellent crops. In the 
midland, and towards the hills, the foil is deeper afncf 
blacker. 

Mineral Waters. — There are feveral mineral fprings in 

this parifh, inoftly of the chalybeate kind. There is one on 

the 



tf Durris, 



259 



the top of mount Gower, called Red Beard's IV ell, which, is 
reckoned good for ftoniachic complaints. There is another 
ftrongly impregnated with fulphur. The tafte of the water 
is difagreeable j but it fits very L"ght on the jftomach. 

River. — The river Dee bounds the parifh on the north. 
It is not navigable, but at Aberdeeen, by means of the tides. 
The falnion filhings on the Dee, for fome years paft, have 
not been profitable ; becaufe the fifli do not come up the 
river in luch numbers as formerly. From the month of Ja- 
nuary, till the middle of May, falmon fells at Aberdeen, at 
6 d. per pound. During the reft of the feafon, they are luld 
at ^d.per pound. They are in perfeftion from the begin- 
ning of January to the middle of September. 

Hi/Is. — The hills in the parifh are Hawk's Neft, Mount 
Gower, Cragg-beg, Mon-dernel and Cairn Monearn. The 
moft remarkable of thefe hills is Cairn Monearn ; according 
to Mr Garden's map of the county, it is 340 yards high. 
It has a very large cairn of ftones on the top of it. All 
thefe hills are covered with mofs and heath. There are a 
good many rocks at the foot of Cragg-beg. Among thele 
rocks is a cavern. A road to Stonehaven, called the Stag"

are faid formerly to have fheltered themlelves in it ; and rd 
have committed many depredations. Red-Beard's Well re- 
ceived its name from this robber.

<p>Name, Situation, ^c. 

'T^HE etymology and derivation may be, the Town of 
MacKer, or Ker's Son. It lies in the county of Rox- 
burgh, in the prefbytery of Kelfo, and fynod of Merfe and 
Teviotdale. Its form is a long fquare, ftretching five or fix 
miles along the north bank of the Tweed, from eaft to weft. 
Its breadth, from north to fouth, is between four and five 
miles. The country is flat, with a gentle afcent from the 
Tweed. The air is dry, and the foil fertile. There is no 
lake or river, except the Tweed, which produces fine falmon 
and trout. The former are fold from 3 d. to 1 s. per pound, 
according to the feafon ; but by far the greatcft proportion 
is carried to Berwick, pickled, and fent to the London 
market. The Tweed is not navigable here. The paftures 
are for the moft part rich, and fo very fine, that they feed 
the beft mutton, though not the largeft in this country ; 
with very good oxen, cows, and horfes, that fetch high 
prices. A good many fwine are alfo fed.

mers in the village of Makcrfton, where now there is not 
one. It contains only 1 2 old cottages. There were for- 
merly about 24 farmers in this parifli, with their families 
and fervants, where we can now reckon only nine. I prc- 
fume, that the number of inhabitants muft then have exceed- 
ed 1000, where I can hardly find above one fourth of that 
number, viz. 250 or 255. Of thefe, there is nearly an 
equal number of males and females, about 60 under 10 
years of age, and 10 or 12 between 10 and 20. All the reft 
are between 20 and 70 years. The total number of births, 
for thefe fix lafl: years, is 76. The marriages are only 18 in 
that /pace. In Dr Webfter's report the number of fouls is 
ftated at 165.

M'l/cellatieous Obfervatlons. — There is no map of the pariHi, 
but it is fuppofed to contain about 3300 acres, which yield 
in rent about L. 1700 or L. 1800. Of thefe, perhaps 600 or 
700 may be in pafture, on which above 1000 flieep are fed; 
and 160 or 180 black cattle are fed for the butcher, and 
for family ufe. There are 60 horfes for plough, cart, and 
faddle ; befides one chaife and two waggons. The farms are( 
laboured by 1 8 ploughs, and as many carts carry the corn to 
market, and bring home the coals ; which are the only fuel 
ufed, except feme cuttings of wood, and a few whins. 
There is no mofs, and there are not five acres in the whole 
parifh, of moor land. Wheat, barley, oats, peafc, turnips,

<p>Name, Situaiion, tzfc. 

THIS parifh derives its name from a diflridl of it which, 
lies next to the main land of Lorn. The name feeras 
to be derived from two Gaelic words, which fignify a mound 
or fmall hill, and a ford, or a pafs over water, joined together 
by the conjunftion fignifying and. It lies in the ifland and 
prefbytery of Mull, in the fynod and county of Argylci 
The general furface of the parifli of Torofay is mountainous, 
and thefe mountains^ are moftly covered with heath. TKie 
length of the parifh from north to fouth is computed at 
about 1 2 miles by the fhorteft road but along the coaft the 
road forms a curve, and is much longer ; the land is in- 
dented by feveral bays, viz. Lochbuy on the fouth, Loch- 
fpelve, and Lochdon, on the eaft, and north of thefe the 
Bay of Dowart, and Bay of Couynahenach, Macalifter's Bay, 
and Bay of Pennygown. In the firft of thefe, fine large 
herrings are foUnd yearly, both about Lammas and Hallow- 
mas but the fifliing is moftly by country boats, the bay be- 
ing thought not fafe for veffels of any burden. The herrings

L. 2000 Sterling. 

Church. — The Duke of Argyle is patron. The living Is 
now L. 83 : 6 : 8 Sterling, including comrnunion-elements. 
The laft incumbent had a long procefs for a glebe, in which 
he was caft ; after which the heritors agreed to give him 
L. 20 Sterling yearly, in Heu of glebe and manfe. There 
are two places of public worfhip, at which the mtnifter ofli- 
ciates alternately, and only one of them has a church. 
There is alfo a church at the confines of this parifli and 
Kilninian, built at the joint expence of both ; where ofli- 
ciates a miffionary ernployed by the committee on the royal 
bounty, with a falary of L. 24 ; but he goes every third 
Sunday over the mountains to Kilfinichan, having under his 
charge part of each of the three extenfive pariflies into 
which Mull is divided. 

School. — The fchools in the parifli of Torofay are three, 
one of which is parochial, with a falary of L. 8 Sterling, but 
lias no other emolument, except the common fees ; the 
fcholars attending this fchool are from 20 to 30. The other

the height of the mountains brings down on this paiilb ra-

thefe mountains are excellent flieep walks, and others are 
very barren. From the top of the mountain czWtd Bemmore^

There are feveral woods in different parts of the pari/h, 
moftly birch, with fome oak and alh. Thefe woods are oc- 
cafionaily fold for charcoal to the Lorn Furnace Company. 
The fhores to the fouth are high and rocky ; along the eaffc 
and north eafl:, they arc acceffible, though not flat, excepting 
jn a few places. There is a ftated ferry to Morven, another 
to Lifmore, a third to Nether Lorn, and the principal ferry 
of Mull is froto Achanacreig in Torofay, firft to Kerrera, and 
thence to the mainland near Oban. Here near 2000 
black cattle are yearly wafted over, for the feveral mar- 
kets to which they are driven, and a conliderable number of 
horfes ; but in the above number are included the black cat- 
tle from the ifles of Coll and Tyree, which are driven 
through MuU, in their way to the low country. Some bli^ck

{County of Perth.') 



By the Rev. Mr George Fraser.</head> 



<p>Situation and Etctent. 
HIS parifli lies in the county of Perth, about four com- 



puted miles, to the north weft from the town of 
Perth. Both In length and breadth, it is about two com- 
puted miles. There are, properly fpcaking, no hills in the 
parifli, but only rifing grounds, which run northward, aad 
fouthward, from the banks of the Shochie. 

5w7, Clintatey Isfc. — The foil is various. On the low flat 
parts, it is partly a light loam, and partly gravelly ; both 
of them on a dry hard deep gravel. On the rifing 
grounds adjacent to the river, the foil is a rich loam, upon 
a itrong deep clay. In the places more diftant from the 
river, the foil confifts of a cold wet tilly clay, refembling 
fl:rong thick mortar. A large quantity of the foil is moor 
ground, covered with dwarf heath. The air is dry and falu- 
brious, owing perhaps to an extenfive range of hills, on the 
weft and north, which are fituated at a good diftance, and 
attra(5l the clouds and fogs. There are often great rains, 
fnows, and frofts, in the hills, and the places near them, 
when it is quite fair and frefli beloW. The weft winds pre- 
vail

vail moft here, and are commonly dry, which contributes 
to render the people healthy. They generally live to a good 
old age. There were two perfons, in the prefent incumbent's 
time, who were reckoned confiderably above i«o years. 
Their ages could not be precifely afcertained, as their names 
were not in the regifter. 

Jgricuhurey Manure, ^c. — Within thefe eight or nine 
years, the various foils are much improved ; and the lands 
which formerly yielded only three or four returns, now give 
fix or eight, and fome more. The rental of one eftate only, 
three fourths of which are improved, and which, previous 
thereto, drew only L. 105, now draws L. 400, befides the 
minifter's ftipend, fchoolmafter's falary, and other public 
burdens. Of late, oxen have not been ufed in ploughing. 
At firft a team of four horfes and a driver were employed in 
their ftead, but now that the breed of horfes is a little im- 
proved, they plough with only two and no driver. The old 
Scots plough is ftill ufed by the old tenants ; but the new 
farmers who have confolidated feveral of the fmall farms 
into one, ufe the new ploughs, with waved mould boards, 
and other deviations from the old Scots plough. Rolling 
after harrowing is now becoming general. The principal 
manure is lime ; it is brought by fea, from Lord Elgin's 
quarries in Fife, to Perth ; from whence the farmers drive it 
to their farms, many of them above 10 or 12 miles diftant. 
They allow about 30, 40, or 50 bolls, in fhells, to the 
acre. There has lately been found a pit of fliell marie, on 
the farm of Monedie, three or four acres in extent, and two 
or three feet thick ; but under a covering of about 12 feet 
at an average. The common crops are oats, barley, peafe, 
potatoes, turnips, lint, and grafs. Till of late, they made ufe 
tjf gray oats in their thin gravelly outfields, and black oats in 

the 



of Monedie, 271 

the wet fwampy fields. They alfo ufed to fow oats and rye 
intermingled ; but now, as by the improvements carrying 
on the diftinftion of out and infield is wearing out, thefe 
crops are difufed. They commonly fallow with turnips and 
potatoes, which are found to be beneficial crops, as well as a 
great improvement of the foil. As all the lands in this 
country feem to have been gained at firft out of moor 
ground, each farm has a good deal of moor intermixed with 
the ploughed fields. The farmers have begun to cultivate 
thefe moors, which are anfwering very well, and in time 
will be converted into good foil, and reward them for their 
indufl:ry. The proprietors are beginning to plant the moors 
with firs. Early peafe feems to agree beft with our foils, 
and are therefore generally ufed. Lint thrives well, which 
the old tenants of fmall farms manufaflure into linen, (moft 
of them being weavers), and find a good market for it in 
Perth. Some of our principal farmers now fow a confider- 
able quantity of lint, and expoft it to fale upon the field, a 
little before it is full ripe ; and they commonly make about 
L. 12 or L. 14 the acre. Laft year, one farmer got L. 19 per 
acre. Barley-harveft commences ufually about the end of 
Auguft j when the barley is cut down, the peafe are com- 
monly ripe ; and then follow the oats, when the harveft is 
finifhed. The crops are got into the barn-yard, before the 
end of September, and then the potatoes are dug up. In 
late feafons the corns are not got in till the end of October. 

^hcep^ Isfc. — Almoft every tenant in the parifli had for- 
merly fome fheep, but they were all banifhed. as deftruftive 
to the young hedges, with which the new farms are in- 
elofed. But an Englifli gentlemen, who has taken the farm 
of Monedie, which Mr Graham has been improving thefe 
two years, has got a fcore of pregnant ewes, of the Bake well 

breed.

breed. They are remarkable for the largenefs of their car- 
cafe, the finenefs and quantity of their fleeces, and their eafily 
fattening even on poor pafture. If they thrive, he intends 
to introduce the breed of them into this part of the country. 
The fame gentleman has alfo brought a horfe from Mr Culley, 
the celebrated farmer in Northumberland, to improve the 
breed of horfes, which is much wanted in this country. The 
horfe is highly commended, by all the connoifleurs, as the 
fineft they ever faw. He has all the genuine marks of an 
excellent ftrong draught-horfe, and is about 16 hands high. 
He is greatly run upon by all the neighbouring gentlemen 
and farmers, who are defirous of ftrong draught horfes. 
The breed of cows are but flowly improving. There are few 
tenants who have not an apiary : bees having a great range 
of open country, thrive well, and make plenty of honey. 

ManufaBures and Trade. — There are no manufaflures in 
the ftridl fenfe of the word# Moft of the old tenants were 
weavers, and a great many of them are fo ftill. There are 
three taylors, one fmith, one mafon, and one lint-dreflcr. 
Every man almoft of the lower ranks knits his own ftock- 
ings, which he learns while herding the cattle. The wo- 
men are all fpinners of linen yarn, and affift in managing 
the farm. 

Farm-houfes. — The lower farmers, who occupy only fmall 
farms, build their own houfes, and they build them of flone 
and feal, thatching with divot and ftraw ; but now, when it 
is neceflary to renew them, they employ mafons to build 
them of ftone and mortar, harling them on the outfide with 
lime j and they thatch them with ftraw and clay, as they are 
prohibited from carting feal and divot. Thefe houfes give 
the country a better and more cheerful look, and they can be 

kept 



of Monedie. 



273 



kept clean and neat. Tliere are four new farm-houfes wholly 
of niafon work. 

Jlents. — The valued rent of the parifh is L. 2000 Scots ; 
and the real rent, by the improvements in agriculture, will 
be as many pounds Sterling, if not more The tenants pay 
their rents in money and vi£lual. Kain fowls, carriages, 
(hearing in harveft, running of errands, and other fervitudes, 
are now converted into money ; which is a great benefit to 
the tenants, who were obliged to anfwer their landlords, 
when called upon, however unfeafonable and prejudicial to 
them. The tenant now enjoys more liberty, and has more 
leifure to attend to the improvement of his farm. 

Population. — Marriages, baptifms, and^^u^^als, taken at an 
average of fix years, immediately precftiing 1791, are as fol- 
lows : Marriages 5, baptifms 13, burials 10. From an ac- 
count taken by the elders, the number of the people is 520 j 
but there are between 7 and 800 joined, quoad facroy to the 
parifti. 

Poor,' — The poor are provided for, by an affeflment on the 
heritors and houfe-holders ; one half on the heritors, the 
other on the houfe-holders. For the purpofe of afleflment, 
the heritors, minifter, and elders, meet, on fummons, half- 
yearly in the kirk, inform themfelves of the number and 
ftate of the neceflitous poor, appoint them a weekly allow- 
ance, according to their different circumftances, and mark 
their proceedings in writing. 

Church. — The f^ipend is four chalders of victual, convert- 
ed at los. 5d. Sterling per boll, and four chalders, ipfis ccr- 
poribusy two thirds meal, and one third bear ; which, with

been frequently repaired at a great expence. The offices 
were, within thefe two years, renewed, but upon too fmall 
a fcale. The kirk alfo, is an old building. It got fome re- 
pairs a good number of years ago ; but it is, at prefent, in a 
very miferable and poor condition, and too fmall for the 
congregation. 

Schooly esJ^^r.—Thc fchoolmafter is well lodgfed, in a houfe 
lately built of mafon work. He occupies the upper ftory 
with a garret ; the ground ftory is the fchool. His falary is 
100 merks Scot^vhich, with the other emoluments, a- 
mount only to about L. 20. 

Fuel.—T\\\ within thefe two or three years, the principal 
fuel of the common people was turf, but, as they are now 
prohibited from paring the ground, they ufe coals ; which 
are brought from Fife to Perth, where they are fold for 
aboutss. or4s. theboll, (40 ftones to the boll), and the 
people find them cheaper, and more comfortable than turf. 
There is no peat mofs in the parilla. 

^«//^//;V;V^.— There are many circles of ftones, fuppofcd to 
be Druidical temples. There are feveral veftiges of ancient 
battles, diftinguiftied by cairns of ftones, with a large ftone 
placed ere(Jl, and another large one, lying length-ways, at its 
foot. There is the pretorium of a Roman camp, according 
to the opinion of an officer, an antiquary, who carefully 
viewed the fpot. There is alfo a vault, the only remains of a

The people are now emancipated from the difagreeable obli- 
gation to particular mills, and fmithies ; and left at full liber- 
ty to go where they pleafe. Some of the meal mills grind 
bear into pot barley pretty well, without any additional machi- 
nery. The only river in the parifh is Shochie, which is but 
fmall. It is clear and rapid, owing to its great declivity ; it 
abounds with trouts, and a ftone bridge %vas lately built over 
it, oppofite to the kirk, which ftands on the fouth fide of it. 
There was another bridge built laft year, over Condrachiei 
where the new high- way, planned and formed by Mr

<p>Situation^ Soil, ^c. 
HE parifli of Maxton is fituated in the county of Rox- 



burgh, In the prefbytery of Selkirk, and fynod of 
Mcrfe and Teviotdale. It lies along the fouth fide of the 
river Tweed, where there are fine falmon and trout. It is 
nearly fotir miles in length, and three in breadth. The foil, 
in the upper part of the parifh, is a ftifF clay ; in the lower, it 
is lighter and dry. 

Population — The parifh is not fo populous, as it was fome 
years ago ; owing, in fome meafure, to feveral farms being 
polTefled by one tenant. About the year 1782, there was a 
pretty exaft account taken of all the inhabitants of the pa-

mounted to 262, and of children below 10 years, to 64, in

marriages are feldom above four in one year, the births fel- 
dom above ten, and the deaths are about the fame number. 

Agriculture. — A good deal of attention is paid to agricul- 
ture. The land produces wheat, barley, oats, peafe, rye, pota- 




toes,

toes, turnips, and rye-grafs. The great diftance from coal 
and lime is fevereiy felt. The valued rent of the whole pa. 
riih is L. 5390 : 6 : 8 Scots. 

Church. — A good part of the ftipend is paid in vi£lual, 
which varies according to the price of grain j communibus 
annis, it is about L. 88 Sterling, with a good glebe. No 
perfon remembers when the church was built ; both it and 
the manfe were lately repaired at confiderable expence. The 
bell is a good one, and has this infcription upon it ; *' 1609. 
«* Zoli Deo Gloria. Joari' Burgenfts me fecit" 

School and Poor. — A good fchool-houfe was lately built, 
which cofl: about L.80 Sterling ; the fchoolmaftcr enjoys the 
legal falary. There are about feven or eight penfioners on 
the poor's lift ; the rates are paid by the heritors and te- 
nants, and amount fometimes to L. 25, fometimes to L. 30 
Sterling, yearly. 

Antiquities. — Upon the eftate and farm of Littledean, there 
are the remains of an old tower, which formerly had been 
a place of feme ftrength, and was built in the form of an 
half moon. It was long the refidence of the Kers of Little- 
dean, and ftill belongs to that antient family ; who have alfo 
a vault, or burying ground, adjoining to the church of Max- 
ton, where they ftill bury, and have done fo, for many ge- 
nerations. Upon Rutherford common, there are the re- 
mains of a Roman camp, on a rifing ground, not far from 
the banks of Tweed, called, the Ringly-Hall," from its 
circular figure ; upon the oppofite fide of that river, there is 
a deep hollow, called the Scots Hole, in which the Scots lay, 
while this Roman camp was pofl^efled by the Englifh. They 
were fome days in this fituation, with the Tweed only be- 
tween

tween them ; when at lafl: the Englifli, being fuperior in 
numbers, ventured to ford the Tweed, at a place where 
the village of Rutherford now ftands, and the Scots met 
them on a riling ground, on the oppofitc fide, which 
is ftill called the PJeabrae. An obftinate battle enfued, 
in which the Englifh were worfted, many of them 
flain, and interred in the burying ground at Rutherford. 
From this battle, the place was called Rue-the-fordy on ac- 
count of the great lofs fuftaincd by the Englifli, in fording 
the Tweed, to attack the Scots. This account is by tradition. 
The time of this battle cannot be afcertained. The lands 
and barony of Rutherford, belong to Sir Alexander Don of 
Newton, Baronet, the reprefentative of a very antient family 
in the Merfe. Near the border, betwixt the pariflies of 
Maxton and Ancrum, there is the ridge of a hill called Lil- 
Hard Edge^ formerly Ancrum Muir. There, a battle was fought 
between the Scots and Englifli, foon after the death of King 
James V. who died in the year 1542, when the Earl of 
Arran was Regent of Scotland. Sir Ralph Rivers, and Sir 
Bryan Laiton, came to Jedburgh with an army of 5000 En- 
glifli, to feize Merfe and Teviotdale, in name of Henry VIII, 
then King of England, who died not long after, in the year 
1547. The Regent and the Earl of Angus came with a fmall 
body of men to oppofe them. The Earl of Angus was greatly 
exafperated againft the Englifli, becaufe, fome time before, 
they had defaced the tombs of his anceftors at Melrofe, and 
had done much hurt to the abbey there. The Regent and 
the Earl of Angus, without waiting for the arrival of greater 
force, which was expefted, met the Englifli at Lilliard Edge, 
where the Scots obtained a great vidtory, confidering the in- 
equality of their number. A young woman, of the name of 
LiJ/iardf fought along with the Scots, with great courage ; in 

memory 



of M,aition» rayg 

memory of which, a tomb ftone was eredled upon her grave, 
in the field of battle, with this infcription : 

* Fair maiden Lilliard lies under this ftane, 

* Little was her ftature, but great was her fame ; 

* On the Englifli lads £he laid many thumps, 

* And when her legs were off, fhe fought upon her flumps.* 

Some remains of this tomb ftone arc ftill to be feen. It is 
near a Roman caufeway, or road, which runs through the pa- 
rifli of Maxton, about two miles, and goes fouthward to- 
wards the foot of Jed water, and northward toward the foot 
of Eildon hills, on the weft fide.

C County of Forfar.) 
By the Rev. Mr John Carnegie. </head>



<p>Name. 

THE antient name of this parifli was ConghoilltSt as ap- 
pears from a charter defcribing the lands of Boifack. 
Its prefent name is Inverheilory from the Gaelic word invery 
implying the mouth of a ftream, there being a rivulet named 
Kei/or, which empties itfelf into the fea, about a mile from 
the village. 

Situation, General appearances, ^c- — The parifh is fituated 
in the county of Forfar, or Angus, prefbytery of Aber- 
brothock, and fynod of Angus and Mcarns. It is of an ob- 
long form, and extends from the fea weftward, about fix 
Scots miles in length ; and its breadth at a medium is about 
2 1 miles. The general appearance of the country is pretty 
level, except on the north fide, where the ground rifes from 
the river Lunan, and forms a beautiful bank, moftly of good 
arable land, Hoping to the fouth. 

Soil, Air, Difeafes. — The foil of the parifli varies, but is in 
general dry and fertile ; the air is pure and healthy, but in 
the months of April and May, thick fogs frequently rife 

from

from the fea. The ague was formerly the moft prevalent 
difteniper ; but of late the rheumatifm has become more ge^ 
heral. 

, Rivers and Milis— The river Lunan runs eaftward thrbugU 
this parifli, and takes its rife, about four miles from the weft 
end of it, near Forfar. This river has its Iburce from a 
well, called Lurian Welly a little above a chain of lochs, vizi 
Reftenet, Refcobie, and Balgaves, through which it paffes, 
and in its courfe is fed hj feveral burns. It flows with a 
clear current, and after a variety of beautiful windings, falls 
into the fea at Redcaftle, It formerly abounded with fine 
trouts, and fome pike, but of late the fifti have fuffercd 
much from watering lint in the river, or in burns that ruil 
into it ; and from fifliing witii nets. In the courfe of this 
river, through the parilh, there are 15 mills, four of which 
are corn, four barley, five lint, one flbiir, and one oil milh 

Sea-coajl. — The extent of fea-coaft is about five miles^ of 
Which, that along the bay of Lunan, (which aflFords a fafe 
anchorage for lliips, except in a ftorm from the eart), is fldt 
and fandy, and overgrown with bent ; but the coatt on the 
jbuth is high and rocky, where there is a remarkable pro- 
nibntory, the Red-head, on the eftate of the Earl of North- 
lelk, whofe feat, Ethie-houfe, lies near it. it was built by 
Cardinal Beaton, and was one of his country feats. This 
cape is 45 fathoms in height ; it is feen at a great diftance 
from fea, and abounds with a variety of fea-fowls. At the 
Red. head there is an inexhauftible quarry of fine free flone. 
And below the rocks, pebbles, known by the name of Scots 
pehblesy are numerous ; among which there are Ibme of the 
colour and denfity of an amethyft^

Ftp. — On tl)is part of the coaft there is a- fmall fiflifng: 
town, c'A\\i\Ethie havm, inhabited by ten incluftriousfifliermen, 
wiio cmpioy two boats. The fifli caught are haddocks, flcate, 
cod, ling, holybut, and lometimes turbot. Salted cod, (abouti 
nine inches in length), were lent to the London market, and 
fold at 5 s. j6gr hundred. In the year 1755, a lobfter fifliing 
commenced, which conficierably hurt the fifliing of fkate, 
kilhng, ling, and holybut \ but the fmall lifh were not found 
to be fcarcer. In London the demand for faked cod ceafedy 
but lobfters found there a good n\arket. In the year 1760, 
a falmon fifning was begun on Redcaftle and Lunan fands. 
It was pretiy fuccefsful that feafbn, but not fince j. perhaps, 
in fome meafure, owing to fteeping lint in the river Lunan, 
which communicates with the bay. The white fishing con- 
tinued much the fame, till the year 1786, from which pe- 
riod, both the great and the fmall fifh, have been very 
lcarce» particularly the haddocks. 

Puel. The fuel commonly ufed is eoal, brought from 

the Frith of Forth, and fold at the harbour of Aberbroth- 
Gck, at 6 s. 6d- cart load, being 72 ftone. But on all that 
pafe the Red heads northward, there is a tax of iSjd. per ; 
boll. There are indeed ftill fome whip and broom in the 
 country, but the fupply from thefe is become,, by the im- 
provements in agriculture, exceedingly fcarce. 

Population. — There are no records of this paridi, farther 
back than the year 1739 fince which time the population 
has increafed. The number of fouls at prefent in the pa- 
rifli, is 1747. In Di" Webfter's report, the number is i285. 
The births at an average of feven years, amount to 45 per 
annum., the marriages to 14-, the burials to 24. But it muft 
be obferved, that the number of burials cannot be exaftly 

afcertained)

afcertained, as many of the parifliioners bury elfewhere, and 
fome from other parillies bury here; and it is only when the 
mort-cloth is given, that the deaths are recorded. 

There are fix heritors in the parifli, of whom four are re- 
fident. The number of tenants is 48, of ploughs 98, and 
thefe, except a few, are drawn by two horles. T here are 
353 houfes in the parifh. The average number of fouls in 
each family, is about 5. The following tradefmen are all 
houfeholders : weavers 46, who are chiefly employed in ma- 
king coarfe green linen cloth, or Ofnaburghs. which they 
fell to the greater manufafturers in towns, intended for the 
Weft-Indian and American markets, and exported from Lon- 
don and Glafgow ; carpenters 9,^ — taylors 8, — fhoemakers 
5, — blackfmiths 5, — flax-drelTers 6, — -mafons 3, — coopers 2, 
— bakers 2, — brewers 3, — retailers of ale 5. The inhabitants 
are all of the eftablifhed church, except four families of Epil- 
copalians, and one family of Seceders, 

Rent and Crops. — The valued rent of the parifli is 6354I. 
6 s. 8 d. Scots, The real rent is 3179 1. 13 s. 6 d. Sterling. 
The rate at which land is let, is various : fome farmers pay 
from 7$. 6d. to 20 s. per acre. There is no map of the pa- 
rifli, but the number of acres is reckoned to be about 7083, 
Of thefe one Iralf is annually employed in raifing wheat, bar- 
ley, oats, peafe, &amp;.c. ; and betwixt 70 and 80 acres at an 
average, in raifing flax. The other half in hay, pafture, 
I'ummer-fallow, and potatoes, which afford a very general 
fubfiftence ; and in turnips, on which cattle are fed after the 
fpggage. The tenants find their advantage in breeding 
cattle, a confiderable number of which, both fat and lean, 
go to Kfigland yearly The produce of the parilh is more 
than iuiEcient to fu^ply its inhabitants. 

Poor. 



284 StatJJlical Account 



Poor. — The average number of poor on the roll, is about 
20, who receive according to their circum fiances, from 2 s. 
to 7 9 per month. The annual amount of the fum, expend- 
ed for their relief, and for occafional charities, is about 
Jj. 54 Sterling, which arifes chiefly from the weekly collec- 
tions, and from the intereft of a fmall mortified fum. 

Church — The ftipend is, meal 68 bolls at 7 ftonc per boll, 
bear 48 bolls, wheat 12 bolls, money L. 17:2: 2y, includ- 
ing L. 5 for communion elements ; a glebe four acres arable, 
and L. 20 Scots for grafs. Both kirk and manfe are old, 
ncl need frequent repairs. 

School. — The number of fcholars is various ; there have 
been from 30 to 70. The fchoolmafler's falary is 100 merks 
from heritors, and eight bolls of oats in leed-time from the 
tenants. The fchool fees per quarter are, for reading 1 s. 
reading and writing is, 6 d. arithmetic 2 s. and Latin 2s. 
He has likewife fome emoluments, arifing from the ofEces of 
feflion- clerk and precentor, together with a houfe and 
garden. 

Roads. —tihoni two miles of the poft-road, leading fron^ 
Aberbrothock to Montrofe, run through this parilh. It has 
been hitherto kept tolerably well in repair by the ftatute la- 
bour. Two tolls have been lately erefted on it, with a view- 
to the alteration of its courfe. The turnpike road betwixt 
Aberbrothock and Forfar, pafles, for about two rniles, through

where divine fervice was performed by the monks from the 
abbey of Aberbrothock. At a place called Chapeltown^ there 
are the remains of the chapelry of Quyte6eld, now annexed by 
charter to the eftate of Mr Lindfay-Carnegie ; and which is the 
family burying ground. There are veftiges of Danifh camps, 
both in the lands of the Earl of Northellc, and of Mr Lind- 
fay-Carnegie. Thofe on the ground of the latter are near a 
farm-houle, called Denmark. Although, owing to the culti- 
vation of the country, the veftiges are not now remaining fq 
very diftindl:, ftill the tradition is ftrong, and the name of 
Detimark feems to warrant it. 

Iwprovcments . — Since the fettlement of the prefent incum- 
bent, agriculture has been amazingly improved. There was 
then little wheat fown, no barley, (the firft boll of which the 
prefent incumbent imported from Eaft-Lothian) ; no grafs- 
feeds, nor fummer- fallow, few inclofures, and thofe of earth. 
At prefent, agriculture, in every branch, is in a ftate of culti- 
vation, little inferior to the Lothians. Of late, the know- 
ledge of improvements, and the value of farms, have increafed 
with a rapid progrefs. And within thefe 10 or 11 years, a 
fpirit of improvement has been particularly obfervable. Far- 
mers are fo fenfible of the advantages of inclofures, that all 
the fences now going on are of ftone. Their houfes of late,

with a comoltte ikading or fet of offices. The houfes of cotta- 
gers and traaefmen, are generally now of ftone, and fome of 
them flated. It muft be obferved, that in building here, there 
is a local convenience, as on every eftate in the parifli, there is 
plenty of free ftone. This ipirit of improvement has not 
produced, in the parifli at large, the depopulating tScdis that 
have marked its progrefs in other parts of Scotland. A 
Junftion of farms has taken place in but a few inftances ; and 
in thefe, owing to fome local inducements, viz. ground late- 
ly feued, and the adjacency of a river, the lofs to popula- 
tion is fully compcnfated, by many new houfes built for 
^radefmen.

<p>Extent and Situation. 

THIS parifli is about four miles in length, and nearly as 
much in breadth, and is fituated about two miles 
north from Stirling, in the prefbytery of Dunblane, and pro- 
vincial fynod of Perth and Stirling. The pari(h lies in three 
fliires, viz. Stirling, Perth, and Clackmannan^ 

Population. — About 30 years ago, when a computation of 
the number of the inhabitants was made, at the requeft of 
the fheriff depute of Perthfhire, it was reckoned, that the 
fouls contained in each of the three counties, amounted to 
about 500, making in ail 1500. In Ur Webfter's report, the 
number is 1985. 

Produce and Soil. — Provifions of all kinds are plentiful. 
There are four coalhills within as many miles of the church. 
■*^'here is plenty of peat in Mofs Flanders, which is about 
four miles diftant from the church. As to the foil of this pa- 
rifh, the one half of it is ftrong carfe clay ground, and is 
reckoned to be the j ichcH: of any in thp kingdom ; the other 
half is dryfield, and hilly ground j the former prpduces ex-

ceeding good crops ; the latter is fit for pafturing cattle, flieep; 
and goats : thefe two foils are nearly equally divided by a 
high.road, at the foot of the Ochil hills, running from Alva 
to Stirling. 

Poor. — Poor's rates are adopted in this parifh, one 
half of vsrhich is paid by the heritors, and the other by the 
tenants. In the year 1774, the number of the poor was 
33, for whom were contributed L. 40 Sterling. L 28 was 
paid by the heritors and tenants, and L. 1 2 out of the poor's 
funds; but in 1775, L. 38 was diftribiited, and for fome years 
paft, the heritors and tenants have advanced only L. 22, 
Which, with L. 1 2 paid yearly out of the poor's funds, Ihows 
that the expences have diminilhed. The poor live in their 
own houles, and none are allowed to beg. 

Mifcellaueous ObfervaHom. — The abbey of Cambufkenneth 
is the only place of antiquity in this parifli, where King 
James III. of Scotland was buried. Nigh to this is the Abbey 
Craig, of conhderable height ; upon the top of which is to 
be feen the form of a battery, faid to be eredted in Oliver 
Cromwell's time, when he laid liege to the caftlci of Stirling, 
but without effedt. There is a high conical hill in this parifli, 
called Dunmyatty from the top of which, is to be feen part 
of 12 counties. About half a jnile from the foot of this hill 
to the north, is a very fine well, which iffues from more 
than 60 fprings, that rile through the fund and channel. It 
is called the Holy Welly and is faid to have formerly been 
much reforted to by the Roman Catholics. There are ap- 
pearances of filver and copper mines in this parifli. Some 
of them have been wrought, but with little profit to the ad- 
venturers. The only one that feemed to prove advanta- 
geous, was that on the eftate of Aithrey, belonging to Mr

and they got about 50 barrels of filver ore, of which four 
barrels made a ton, and each ton was valued at London 
at L. 60 Sterling. One Dr TwiiTe, to whom the ore was 
configned, became bankrupt, which put an end to the ad-

UNITED PARISHES of <name ref="NA">STITCHEL and HUME</name>. 

{Counties of Roxburgh and Berwick,) 
By the Rev. Mr Andrew Scott. </head>



<p>Situation, Na??je, ^c. 

nr^HE united pariflies of Stitchel and Hume, lie in the 
prefbytery of Kelfo, and fynod of Merfe and Teviot- 
dale. Tiie former is in the county of Roxburgh, and the 
latter in that of the Merfe or Berwickfliire. The parifh of 
Stitchel is fituated on the north eaft corner of Roxburgh- 
Ihire, and ten-twelfths of it are furrounded by Berwickfhire. 
It is faid that the name Stitchel fignifies in Gaelic a declivity; 
and this name will be reckoned very proper by thofe who 
have feen the fituation of the houfe and village of Stitchel. 
Moft part of the parifh is 600 feet above the level of 
the river Tweed at Kelfo, which is only four miles dif- 
tant. The united pariflies will be between five and fix miles 
from fouth to north, and between three and four from eaft 
to weft. The figure is irregular, being frequently intercept- 
ed by the pariflies furrounding it. 

Rent and Soil —The valued rent of the united pariflies is 
L. 7623 : i8 : 4 Scots. The real rent is, at prefent, upwards 
of L. 30^0 Srerling. A good part of the land is of a ftrong 
foil, and bears good crops, both of grafs and grain of all 

kinds. 



&amp;f Stitchel and Hume. 



kinds. There is a good deal of clay in the foil, and in fome 
places the land is wet and cold, which makes it lefs fit to re- 
ceive the benefit of lime. It is, however, certain, that the 
tenants have improved their lands in a high degree, by the 
ufe of lime and other attentions to agriculture. The lands 
are almoft all incloled, and moflily in tillage. 

Caii/e. — The cattle in the parilh of Stitchel are of a larger 
fize than the common run of cattle, north of the Tv* eed, 
owing to the late Sir Robert Pringle, having, for leveral 
years, had a fupply of Dutch bulls. It is now the practice to 
feed cattle on turnip in the field, as well as in the houfe. 
Turnip is alfo given to the fheep through the winter. The 
flieep are chiefly of the Englifli breed, and the wool is of the 
fame quality, which they ufually produce. 

Population. — The number of inhabitants, young and old, is 
nearly looo. Of thefe there are between 3 and 400 Sece- 
ders. In Dr Webfter's report, the nun:iber is 959. 

Poor. — Each barony, viz. that of Stitchel and Hume, 
maintains its own poor, which is done by afleffments on the 
proprietors and tenants, as circumftances require. There is 
a deed of mortification of L. 100 Sterling, by a Captain 
Robert Home of the reginient of foot, formerly command- 
ed by Colonel Roger Handyfide, the one half of the in- 
tereft of which is annually diftributed at Chriftmas, to poor 
houfeholders in the village of Hume ; and the other half 
to the fchoolmafter of Hume, for teaching poor fcholars 

born in the village There are eight perfons on the 

poor's roll in the parifh of Hume, and feveral families 
who receive occafional fupplies from the feiKoru At prefent, 
there are no poor on the roll, in the parifli of Stitchel,

owing cliiefly to the uncommon care and attention of the fa- 
mi]y of Stitchel to the inhabitants. 

Church. — ^The King is patron of the parifli. The living 
confifts of 600 merks of money, and fix chalders of vidtual, 
one half of which is bear, and the other infield oats, Lin- 
lithgow meafure. The allowance for communion elements is 
L. 40 Scots, of which the one half is paid by the Earl of 
Marchmont, and the other by Sir James Pringle, Baronet, of 
Stitchel. The glebe of Stitchel confifts of about five Scots 
acres, and the glebe of Hume betwixt three and four acres 
Englifh. 

Antiquities^ ^c. — The caftle of Hume, which ftands in the 
parifli, was for ages a noted defence to its neighbourhood, 
during the contentions and wars on the borders. The Earls 
of Home refided in it. Our fijuthern neighbours often be- 
fieged it. It was furrendered to the Duke of Somerfet in 
the year 1547, and retaken in the 1549. It is faid, that 
Oliver Cromwell, when at Haddington, fent a fummons to 
the governor, ordering him tofiirrender the cafi:le,but that the 
then governor returned for anfwer ; That * He Willie Wajlley 
* ftood firm in his caftle, and that all the dogs of his town, 
« fliould not drive Willie Waftle down.' And that this is the 
origin of that play, with which the children here often ex- 
ercifc themfelves. Oliver Cromwell, however, after con- 
fiderable difficulties, made himfelf mafter of it, and in a 
great meafure demoliflied it. There is a tradition generally 
believed in the country, that when King James II, went to 
befiege the caftle of Roxburgh, he left his Queen in Hume 
Caftle that one day, when flae was upon the road to vifit her 
royal huflaand, ftie was met about half a mile eaft of Stitchel 
!Poufe, by a mefi^enger, witli the melancholy account of his 
Majefty's being killed by the burfting of a cannon. This fad

in the parifh of Hume, called Hardie^s Mill Place^ is a loch 
of about 30 acres, in which peats have formerly been got, 
but, in a dry fummer, cattle can feed all over it ; to the north 
of the loch, about 200 yards diftant, is a rifing ground, called 
Lur^'rc Craigs, which confilts of regular ranges of whin, 
ftones, fimilar, but not near fo large, to thofe in Arthur's 
feat, on the foot path to Duddingfton from Edinburgh. 
They are regular polygons of about five and fix feet high, 
and x6 or 17 inches over; they ftand ere£l and clofe, but not 
adhering to each other, fo that a man with a crow can eafily 
feparate them. They have all the appearance of being the 
fame with thofe of the Giants Caufeway in Ireland, or in 
fomr of the Weftern Iflands of Scotland. In another of 
thefe farms, belonging to Sir James Pringle, viz. Hume- 
Byres, is a hill, called Hume Pallat^ about a mile from the 
caftle, and nearly on a level with it ; upon the weft: end of 
the hill, are the diftin£l remains of a fort with a foffe ; whe- 
ther formerly an appendage of Hume Caftle, or not, cannot 
now be known. 

Mifcellaneous Ob/ervotions. — The water of Eden feparates 
the parilh of Stitchel from that of Nenthorn, for about a mile 
and an half. In this courfe it falls over a rock, nearly per- 
pendicular, of about 40 feet high. In a flood, or in a hard 
frofl, it is a moft beautiful objeft. This rock is at a fmall 
diftance from Newton- Don Houfe, There are no manufac- 
turers in the parifh. Lime and coals are brought from the 
Enghfh fide, and are exceedingly dear. The procurin* 
fuel is one of the greatefl: hardfhips that the parifli lies un- 
der. Coals are carried near 20 miles, and any peats that 
are ufcd, are driven about (oven The poorer people, there- 
fore, have but a very fcanty fupply of fuel.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3059402">ETTERICK</name>. 



{Counfy of Selkirk.') 



By the Rev. Mr Robert Russell.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, and Extent. 



HE ancient and modern name of the parifti is Eticrick ; 



but from whence it received this appellation, there is 
not even a tradition extant. It is fituated in the county of 
Selkirk, in the prefbytery of the fame name, and in the 
fynod of Merfe and Teviotdale. It extends about ten miles 
every way. 

Surface and Soil. — The general appearance of the country 
is hilly and mountainous. The foil in the haughs is exceed- 
ingly deep and fertile. This Is occafioned, in a great meafurc, 
by the inundations from the hills. As they bring down 
with them a great many rich particles of earth, fo when they 
retire, they leave thefe behind them, which deepen and fer- 
tilize the foiU Very few good crops are, however, raifed. 
This is owing to the great height of the counti'y, and the 
frequency of the rains, which prevent the crops from com- 
ing to maturity. In a remarkably dry and hot year, the cafe 
is otherwife. Then, not only a great quantity of ftraw, but 
of grain, is produced. This, however, feldom happens. 
Upon the hills, the foil is in many places mofly, and fit for 




nothing 



of Etierick, 



nothing but fuel and pafturage. In other places, it is pretty 
deep and hard, but, on account of the immenfe height and 
fteepnefs, it is fufceptible of no cultivation. The air is in 
general moift. This is occafioned by the height of the hills, 
which continually attraft the clouds, and the vapour that is 
conftantly exhaled by the fun from the mofly grounds. It 
does not appear, however, to be unfavourable to health, as 
the people live as long here as thofe in dryer countries. 

Lales and Rivers. — There are two lochs adjoining 
to one another, partly in this parifli, and partly in Yar- 
row. The one is called the Loch of the Lotus, and the 
other St Mary's Loch, The extent of the former is incon- 
fiderable ; the latter is about three miles long, and one 
broad in fome places. The fifh, with which they chiefly a. 
bound, are pike and perch. No pcrfon, however, pays any 
attention to them. The Etterick is the only river in this pa- 
rifli. It is a fmall one, but abounds with excellent trout. 
After a courfe of 30 miles to the eaftward, (wherein it pafl^es 
through the pariflaes of Etterick, Yarrow, and Selkirk), it is 
abforbed in the Tweed, fome miles above Melrofe. 

Mountains and Hills. — The mountains in general are high. 
The moft remarkable are thofe called the Ward Law, and 
Etterick Penn. The former rifes ipso feet above the level 
of the feaj the latter 2200. The hills, for the moft part, are 
covered with a fine green pafture. Some heath is inter- 
fperfed. * 

Sheep. — This parifli produces no remarkaWe fpecies of ani- 
mals, except flieep, which are allowed by all to be delicious 
food, and to thrive well, either when removed to the Eng- 
lifli paftures, or the Highland hills. Nothing, however, can 

be

be faid for their wool. It is of ihe coarfeft kind, and little 
adapted for oianufaaure. A fione of it does not bring uiorc 
than 6s. The number of fheep is about 30,000, and there 
are about 230 head of black cattle, and 40 horfes. 

Population.— Th^ ancient ftate of the popuiation of this 
parifh cannot be exactly alcertained. It feems, however, to 
have been confiderably greater in former times than at pre- 
fent. In one place, about 50 years ago, there were 32 
houfes ; but at prefent, there are only three. From this 
circumftance, it would appear, that the population hath de- 
creafed. The prefent number of inhabitants, however, a- 
ttiounts to 470 ; of thele 222 are males, and 248 are females. 
In Dr Webfter's report, the number is only 3^7. 

ProduEiions. — Nothing but the common vegetables and 
plants are produced. — The Scots fir is almofl the only 
fpecies of wood to be feen here, and that in very fmall quan- 
tities. Indeed, there is not fo much as to anfwer necoflary 
purpofes. In former times, this country abounded with 
wood ; hence it received the name, which it ftill retains, of 
Etterick Forefl. Not a veftige, however, of the ancient wood 
now remains. As great quantities of oak are ftill dug up in 
the molles, this feems to have been the prevalent fpecies. 
The number of acres employed in raifing corn, roots, &amp;.c. 
is not exa£lly known. But it may eafily be conceived, that 
they are very few, when, in q fquare of 10 miles, there is 
not fo much arable ground, as to maintain 400 people with 
its produce. Barley, oats, and potatoes, are the only crops 
raifed. Wheat, rye, turnip, and cabbage, are never attempt- 
ed. The parifli both exports and imports articles of provi- 
.fions. It exports mutton in great quantities, and imports 

meal 



r 



ef Etterick, 

meal of various kinds to a confiderable extent, 
is another great article of exportation. 

Mifcellaneoiis Obfervations. — This parifh poflelTes no advan- 
tage. The neareft market town is 15 miles diftant. The 
roads to all of them are alaioll impaffiible. The only road 
that looks like a turnpike is to Selkirk ; but even it in many 
places is fo deep, as greatly to obftruft travelling. The dif- 
tance is about 16 miles, and it requires four hours to ride it. 
The fnow alfo, at times, is a great inconvenience ; often for 
many months, we can have no intercourfe with man- 
kind. It often alfo obliges the farmers to fly with their 
flocks to Annandale for provifion. Another great difadvan- 
tage is the want of bridges. For many hours the traveller is 
obftrudled on his journey, when the waters are fwelled. 
The land rent of the parifh is between L. 2000 and L. 3000 
Sterling, per annum. The value of the living, including the 
glebe, is L. 100 per annum. Lord Napier is patron. There 
are 10 proprietors of land in this parifli: none of them re- 
fide in it. The number of perfons, receiving alms, at this 
time, is 15-. The afleflments upon the heritors for their fup- 
port, amount to L. 37 Sterling, per annum. The fuel ufed 
here is peat. Coal is diftant 30 miles. In this parifh 
there are 12 ploughs, and 20 carts, but no carriages or 
waggons.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1123060">FORGANDENNY</name>. 

{County of Penh.) 
By the Rev. Mr Robert Thomas. </head>

<p>

Origin of the Nar^e, 

THE parifli of Forgandenny has born its prefent name 
from time immemorial. If it ever had any other 
name, it is not now known. The word is compounded ; 
Forgan appears to be of Gaelic extraftion, for there is a hill 
in the Highlands, called Fergati ; which, by a fmall alteratiou 
of the vowel ^, into 0, becomes Forgan : Denny Teems to be 
added, to diftinguifh this parifh from the pariQi of Long- 
Forgan, in the eaft end of the Carfe of Gowry. It is 
obvious, that it is called Forgandenny, or Denny- Forgan, 
from the fituation of the church, which is upon a fmall hill, 
on each fide of which there is a den, formed by the perpetual 
running of two fmall brooks, which meet at the foot of the 
hill, a little to the northward of the church. Perhaps like- 
wife from the number of dens in the hills. 

'f. 

Situation and Extent. — This parifli is fituated in the county, 
fynod, and prefbytery of Perth, about three Englifli miles, 
nearly due fouth, from the town of that name. It is about 
five miles In length, and fcarcely two in breadth. Its whole 
e^^tent is computed to be about 8000 Scots acres. 

Surface. 



of Forgandenny. 



Surface. — The appearance of the country is various. The 
parifli may be divided into two parts, the upper and the 
lower. The lower divifion, though it rifes gradually to the 
foot of the hills, is upon the whole a champaign country : 
the upper is hilly, being part of thofe hills which are called 
the Ochils. In the upper, or hilly part, there are frequent 
rocks, yet it cannot from them be denominated rocky, moft 
of thofe hills being covered with grafs, and fome parts of 
them with heath, furze, and broom. 

Soil. — In the hilly part, the foil confifts of reddilh clay, 
black earth, and fand. It is for the moft part light, and 
better fitted for producing oats, than any other fort of grain; 
and thefe it produces in great abundance. In the lower part 
the foil likewife varies. The meadows, by the fide of the 
Earn are fandy. The grounds above them confift chiefly of 
rich black earth, and cky. The meadows, both by the fides 
of the Earn, and of the May, a fmall river, which runs 
through the hills, produce plenty of excellent flax. And on 
the black earth and clay are raifed rich crops of barley, and 
wheat, befides oats, clover, turnips, cabbages, and potatoes. 
Much of the low part of the parifli they call carfe ground, 
from its bei-ng the fame fort of foil with the Carfe of Gowry* 
And, indeed, the Carfe of Gowry feems to be but a continu- 
ation of that extenfive valley, which is called Stratheartit 
That chain of hills which in Strathearn are called the 
Ochills, and which bound the fouth fide of the ftrath, run 
from weft to eaft through Fife, nearly as far as the mouth 
of tlie Tay. And the hilly ground v,;hlch flielters Strathearn 
on the north, is feparated from thofe hills, which are called 
the Brae of the Cnrfe^ only by the courfe of the Tay, From 
a high hill in the parifh of Forgan, which the}- call Cylle. 



3^0 ' Staiijlical Account 

lawy there is a profpe£l of all that level, which in one place 
is called Strathearn, and in another the Carfe of Gowry. 

Climate and Difeafes — The air in the higher grounds is ra- 
ther chilly. But in the valleys on the river May, and in the 
low part of the parifli, where the country is fheltered with 
wood, it is much milder. The hills are fometimes covered 
with mifts or fogs, which rife alfo occafionally from the fur- 
face of the Earn, and hover over its banks. But thefe mifts 
are far from being frequent ; and the air is upon the whole 
dry and very falubrious. Before the low part of the parifh 
was drained, the ague was a frequent complaint ; but, fince 
that took place, it is fcarcely known. 

Minerals. — There are two mineral fprings in the parifh. 
The one is on the eftate of Mr Oliphant of Roffie. It is a 
chalybeate ; but it has not been generally attended to. The 
other is on the eftate of Lord Ruthven. It is fituated in 
the neighbourhood of the mineral fprings of Pitcaithlie, and 
its virtues are nearly the fame^ The waters of thefe fprings, 
when drunk from a quart to two quarts, prove moderately 
cathartic. They are likewife ufed in the form of a cold, 
but, more frequently, of a warm bath. They are much fre- 
quented by the gentry and others,, who fometimes receive 
much benefit from. them. They give relief in various cafes, 
but chiefly, perhaps, in rheumatic and fcorbutic complaints, 
and diforders of that nature^ 

Rivers. — The rivers are the Earn, and the May. The 
Earn ilTues from a lake of the fame name in the Highlands, 
and flowing through Strathearn, a beautiful, and in many 
places a well cultivated country, falls into the Tay, a little 
below the old caftle of Elcho. This river has been much 

and 



of Forgandenny, 



301 



and juftly admired, for thofe many beautiful curves which 
it defcribes, and peninfulas which it forms in its courfe. It 
produces falmon, different forts of trout, pike, perch, eel, 
and flounders. Both in the parifti, and above it, the fal. 
mon filhings are inconflderable. The only falmon fifliing 
which belongs to this parifh is let at about L. 7 Sterling. 
As we proceed down the river, thefe fifhings become more 
valuable, till we come to the conflux of the Tay and Earn, 
where falmon are caught in great abundance. The price, 
which this fort of fifti gives, in the fpring is pd. and in fum- 
mer 4^ d. j&amp;fr pound. The May takes its rife in the hills, 
about two miles due Ibuth from Dunning, and, after defcrib- 
ing a curve of about eight miles in length, fomewhat re- 
fembling a reaping hook, (the greatefl: part of which is con- 
tained in this parifli), falls into the Earn nearly oppofite to 
the parks of Duplin. In this fmall river, the falmon Ipawn 
below a place called the Fall of Muckarftey but none are 
caught in it. Not to mention eels, falmon, fmelt, and fome 
flounders, it affords in great abundance a very fine flavour- 
ed trout, about the fize of an herring. The Earn is navi- 
gable up to a bridge, which is built acrofs it, about two miles 
eaft from the village of Forgan. Veffels, from 30 to 40 tons 
burden, come to this bridge, laden with lime and coals, for 
the inhabitants in the neighbourhood. 

Stones and Mineral ProdiiH'ions. — ^The only ftone ufed in 
building, to be found in this parifli, is whin ftone. Iron 
ftone is frequent, and a fpecies of lime ftone has been found ' 
on the banks of the May. But neither of thefe forts of 
quarries have as yet been wrought. In the wood of Condie 
which is in the Ochills, on the banks of the May, copper 
was found by the grandfather of the prefent Mr Oliphant 
of Condie. And near the fame place, on the eftate of Mr 

Oliphant

Stat't/lical Account 



Oliphant of Roffie, there were difcovered, fome years ago, 
.certain metallic appearances, which invited a company to 
make a trial of them. Accordingly, a trial was made, and 
lead ore was difcovered, containing in it a great quantity of 
filver ; but, unfortunately, the chief perfon concerned in the 
undertaking failed, and the profecution of the work ceafed. 

Land Floods. — In autumn and winter, thfc meadows, on the 
fides both of the Earn and May, are frequently overflowed. 
When the Earn overflows its banks, it fometimes carries off 
a great deal of the produce of the fields, if the farmers are 
not fufficiently careful to have it removed to fome higher 
ground j but what damage is fuftained in this way, is amply 
compenfated by the rich particles of earth, which are waflaed 
from the hills, and depofited upon the meadows, and which 
ferve them, in general, inftead of manure. 

Cattle^ Is'c. — There are in this parifli, at an average, 261 
horfes, 1222 black cattle, and 520 flieep. The breed of 
horfes and cattle has of late years been improved, both by 
their being better fed, and by their being mixed with a kind 
which are more generous, and of a larger fize. The cattle, 
in the hilly part, are rather of a fmaller fize than thofe in the 
low. But thofe which are fed on the banks of the May, are more 
than commonly handfome, and are efteemed very good beef. 
The hill cattle weigh from 30 to 40 fl:one, and thofe in 
the low country from 40 to 50. The horfes, though not large, 
are hardy and very well fitted for labour. A horfe in its 
prime cofts from L. 16 to L. 20. 

Population. — The population of the parifli, fo far back as 
r can be remembered, has been nearly ftationary. The num- 

ber of fouls, at prefent, is 978, of which 4^7 are males, 

and 



of Forgandenny, 2 03 

and S 1 1 females. In Dr Webfter's report, the number is 
1295. The annual average of births is 27, of deaths 22, and 
of marriages 7. The number of farmers families is about 
23. There arc no manufacturers who do bufinefs to any ex- 
tent. There are. 2 poffefTors of mills, (of which there are 6 
in the parifti), who manufadlure corn into meal, and fell it in 
the neighbourhood. And there are two or three people, 
who, with a fervant or two, manufacture linen cloth and 
fhoes, which they fell in Perth. There are no merchants in 
this parifh. The number of handicraftfmen, in which are 
included fome of the manufacturers, is - 67

population, is nearly as i to 36 : — Between the annual deaths

Vegetable ProduBions — The hills and pafture grounds, be- 
fides different forts of grafs, produce naturally red and white 
clover. In moll: of the gardens of the common people, 
are raifed coleworts, cabbages, onions, leeks, turnips, and 
carrots. Some of them likewife have introduced gcoleberry 
buflies, chiefly for flicker to their hives of bees, of which 
there is no inconfiderable number. And others, in the low 
part of the parifli, have of late begun to plant in their little 

gardens,

Statiftical Account 



gardens, thyme, fouthernwood, balm, mint, chamomile, and 
fome flowers, which ferve both for ornament and ufe. The 
barren wood, which grows wild, is chiefly alder, hazle, 
beech, and birch. Moft of the wood in the plantations is the 
common fir, intermixed with oak, afh, plane, larix, birch, 
beech, Sec The hedge rows are beech, elm, plane, chelnut, 
larix, &amp;c. but chiefly oak, which is planted in the greateft 
abundance. There is a number of very fine trees in the low 
part of the parifli, which have arrived at maturity, amongft 
which arc not a few oaks. And of this latter fort of wood, 
there is fuch abundance, of about 20 or 30 years Handing, 
and in fo thriving a condition, as affords the molt pleafing 
hopes, that, in fome future period, it will contribute in a 
great meafure to fupply our dock yards for (hip- building ; 
efpecially if it be confidered, that moft of it grows within a 
mile of the Earn, down which river it may be conveyed in 
rafts, and {hipped to any port in Britain. Befides the ordi- 
nary crops of barley and oats, and the different green crops, 
there is raifed, in the low part of the parifti, a confiderable 
quantity of wheat. In the hilly diftrift, the principal 
crops confift of oats, peale, and barley. Potatoes and 
flax are raifed in abundance in both places. Turnips alfo, 
with which they ffed their cattle, and fome of their fheep, 
are raued through the whole parifli, but principally in the 
low grounds. 

Exports. — This parifli exports, to different places in the 
neighbourhood, feveral articles of provifion, fuch as meal, 
grain, butter, cheefe, eggs, poultry, black cattle, flieep, and 
fome honey. And it is almofl: folely by their exports, toge- 
ther with their linen yarn, that they are able to pay their 
rents, and procure a fubfiftence. 



Language, 



ef Forgandenny, 2 05 

Language. — ^The language now fpoken is a dlale£l of the 
Englidi ; but the names of many places feem to indicate, 
that ihe Earfe, or Gaelic, had formerly been the vulgar lan- 
guage. Many of thefe names are plainly derived from that 
language, and are in fome meafure defcriptive of the places 
to which they ferve as names. Culteuchary from cult a back 
place or corner, and itachder uppermoft or higheft, fignifies 
the higheft corner or back place. RoJJte fignifies a head of 
land near water. Bunion^ compounded of bun the foot, and. 
ion land, fignifies the foot of the land. Dich fignifies a 
chafm, gully, or ditch. Ochills^ in a word, fignifying the hills 
of that name, is purely Englifh, and feems to be compound- 
ed of oali and hills^ as if the word were written Oak-hills. 

Church and Stipend. — The whole emoluments of the living, 
jnanfe and glebe included, amount to about L. 100 Sterling. 
This parifli was formerly in the diocefe of the Bifliop of 
Dunkeld ; and, therefore, the right of patronage is fuppofed 
to be vefted in the Crown. The church, from a date upon 
the aifle, is fuppofed to have been built about 400 years ago. 
The manfe is of about 54 years ftanding. Both of them 
have at different times undergone various repairs. The 
number of heritors is 17 ; of theje eight are refident, the 0- 
ther nine, non-refident. 

Fuel. — ^The fuel commonly ufed here in fummer is furze, 
broom, wood, and fprays, or branches of trees. The parifh 
produces very little peat. In winter, the chief part of the 
fuel is coals ; thefe coals are brought from places in Fife, 
about 10 or 12 miles difl:ant. The price of them at the pit 
is i8d. a cart load. When brought home they cofl: i d per 
ftone. What can be procured for 20 s. is, with what other 

Vol. III. Qjl fuel 



Stati/lical Account 

fuel can be got at home, fufficlent for a poor family during a 
whole year. 

Rent. — The rent of the heft arable ground is from 25 s. ta 
30 s. per acre, and of the beft meadow ground 21 s. Some 
ground, however, is worth 40 per acre. The rent of infe- 
rior arable ground is from 20 s. to 10 s. 

Size of Farms. — Some farms confift of 200 acres, and 0- 
tliers of 150. The average fize of farms here is fomewhat 
above 100 acres ; but there are a few good farms between 
80 and 40 acres ; and feveral mechanics and others rent 
fmall portions of good ground, of about two or three acres, 
which ferve in fome meafure to employ them, and to con- 
tribute to their fubfiftence and comfort. The number of 
fana: is pcj haps, upon the whole, diminifhed by the addition 
of one fmall place to another. 

P/oughs, ^c. — The plough ufed by the farmers, is the 
common Scots plough, without any wheels. That invented 
by Small has been lately introduced, and affiards much fatif. 
fadlion. There are 48 ploughs in the parifh, 1 coach, 2 
jchaifes, and 2 1 o carts, but no carriages of any other fort. 

Villages,— There are four villages in the parifh, the New- 
ton, Ardargie, the Path of Condie, and Forgan. The New- 
ton is Ctuated between the houfes of Newton and Roflie, 
upon a rifing ground, half a mile from the Earn. It confifts 
of about 15 dwelling-houfes. Ardargie is a village in the 
Ochills. It is lituated at the foot of a ridge of hills, and 
upon a height up from the May. It contains about 1 7 or 18 
farm houfes and cottages. The Path of Condie lies in the 
Ochills, towards the fouth extremity of the parifli. It is 

built 



Fo'rgandefiny. ^b^ 

built upon a hill, which on the one fide is waflied by the 
May, and on the other by a rivulet, called the Chapel waterj 
both of which ftreams meet to the eaft of this hill, in a 
deep and fufficiently pleafant valley. This village contains 
about 22 dwelling-houfes, befides a mill, an Antiburgher 
meeting-houfe, and a fchool. The village of Forgan is fitu- 
ated between the houfes of Freeland and Roffie, about half a 
mile up from the Earn. It confifts of about 30 houfes, moft 
of which are inhabited by handicraftfmen and labourers. It 
is divided into two parts, by a fmall brook, which runs 
through it. 

Church and School. — The church has a very decent appear- 
ance, but what gives it a venerable air, is its being furround- 
ed with a number of the fineft trees which this country pro- 
duces. The fchool-houfe and dwelling-houfe of the fchool- 
mafter, form together a very neat fmall building. In this 
fchool there are educated annually about 50 boys and girls^ 
of which about 10 or a dozen are the children of poor peo- 
ple, the whole expence of whofe education is defrayed by 
the kirk-feffion. The whole emoluments of the fchool a&amp; 
mount to L 27 or L. 30 Sterling. 

Roads and Bridges. — The public roads, in the low part of 
the parlfh, and even in the hills in fome places, as well as 
the bridges, are exceedingly good. They were at firft niade^ 
and are ftill kept in repair, by the ftatute labour, which is 
partly exacted in kind, and partly commuted. The private 
roads, leading to the gentlemen's houfes, do honour to the 
|)roprietors. Ail of them in point of goodnefs are equals 
and fome of them iuperior to the public roads; 



Indofuresi — '

fifli is inclofed. The inclofiires are.' made by hedges and 
ditches, and furroiinded with a fingle,, double, or triple row 
of trees, which at once fhelter and beautify the country. A 
confiderable part of the higher grounds are likewife inclofed. 
And though much remains yet to be inclofed, yet all are 
convinced of the benefit of this improvement. 

Public Hoiifes. — There are five public houfes in the parifh, 
three or four of which are neceffary. The effedts of them 
upon the morals of the people is inconfiderable. 

■Poor. — The poor of this pariHi are fupplied folely from 
the property of the feffion or church. This property confifts 
.of what is collefted at the church door, and of the remain- 
ders of fuch colleftions in former times, after relieving the 
poor, which have in time accumulated, and are laid out 
upon intereft. There are, at an average, four or five conllant 
penfioners upon the feffion. Thel'e receive monthly 2s. 3 s. 
4 s. or 5 s. according to their need, and refide in houfes of 
their own. Several others likewife receive fupply occafion- 
ally, when their circumftances require it. , 

Aniiquhies. — In the weft border of the low part of the pa- 
rifli, are the remains of an ancient fortification. It is fituated 
upon a piece of rifing ground refembling a femifphere. It is 
fortified, partly by nature, and partly by a ftone wall, the re- 
mains of which are yet difcoverable under the mols, which 
has nearly covered them. On the eafi: there is an opening, 
and lower down, without the walls, there are fome remains of 
ditches. No place can be better fitted for obfervation. It 
commands an extenfive profpecl on all fides, except the fouth. 
It is fituated at the lower end of the valley, through which 
the May runs, and which is the only pafiage, within fome 

miles 



of Forgandenny, ^©i 

miles on each fide, through the Ochils to Fife. It is there- 
fore imagined by fome, that it might have been an outpoft 
of the Romans, whilft they were in Strathearn. Befide 
Ardargie, a village in the hills, there is a place, which for time 
immemorial has been called the Roman Camp, It is fituated 
upon a height above the May. Its figure is a fquare, each 
fide of which is about 90 yards in length. On the one fide 
it is defended by a deep hollow, through which runs a 
brook ; and on the other three fides by trenches. The 
width of thefe trenches, at the top, is about 10 yards, their 
depth on the fide next the camp about 14 feet, and on the 
outfide 10. Somewhat more than a mile fouth from For- 
gan, is a place called Cajlle-laiv. It is fituated upon the 
fummit of a very high hill, which refembles a low cone. 
The circumference of its area is about 500 yards. This fpot 
is defended on all fides by a ftone wall, the veftiges of which 
are yet to be feen ; thefe veftiges are of a form nearly circu- 
lar, and the walls feem to have taken their form from the 
top of the hill on which they were built. Befides this wall, 
there are alfo feveral outworks, which feem to have been 
formed for defence ; particularly on the fouth, where the 
hill is lefs fteep, and the ground below higher, .there are 
three mounds of earth parallel to the wall, and to each o- 
ther. Within the area of this caftle or fortification, are the 
veftiges of buildings ; and there was ere£ted, by the former 
Lord Ruthven, on this fp';t, a fort of half tower, which is 
yet ftanding. This place commands a profpedt of the coun- 
try, to the mouth of the Tay, or the German ocean on the 
eaft, all Strathearn to the Grampian mountains on the weft^, 
a great part of Perthfliire and Angusfliire on the north and 
north eaft, and the top of the Lomond hills on the fouth. 
The general opinion concerning Cnftle-law is, that it had 
been a Danifh fortification. About half a mile north from 

t;he 



310 Statijlical Account 

the foot of this high hill, is a place called the Law of Dum" 
hinls. It is a craggy hill, the top of which arc the vef- 
tiges of a wall, whofe form has alfo been determined by that 
of the hill on which it was built. There is nothing remark- 
able in thefe veftiges. They are much the fame with what 
is to be feen, on many of thofe hills, called Laws, and ate 
very probably the remains of fome ancient fortification.

(County of Roxburgh.) 



By the Rev. Mr John Riccalton,</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, ^c. 



HE ancient name was Hob/iirk, and the modern name 



X. is Hobkirk. Tradition fays that it was built by a man 
of the name of Hob, and had taken its name from the founder. 
The parilh is fituated in the county of Roxburgh, prefbytery 
pf Jedburgh, and fynod of Merfe and Teviotdale. It is of 
an oblong form, about 12 miles in length, and about three 
where broadeft. The general appearance of the country is 
mountainous. 

Soil. — The foil is very different both in its nature and 
quality. All along the fide of the water of Rule, it is a very 
fertile, deep, ftrong clay, feme parts of it mixed with fmall 
channel, and other parts with fand. At a diftance from the 
water, it is a light Tandy foil, lying upon the face of a cold 
till, and moft of it very barren. 

Mountains, ^c. — The moft remarkable mountains arc 
Winbrough, and Fanna. Winbrough, from its bafe to the 
fummit, is an afcent of a mile and a half, and Fanna is 
nearly the fame. Windbrough is fo high, that, from its 




fumriiit.

fummit, you have a view of both eaft and wed: feas, though 
both are at the diftance of 40 miles. Tiie parifli abounds 
with free ftone. Beyond Winbrough there are very good 
lime ftone quarries, and three lime kilns ; two of them upon 
the lands of Sir Francis Elliot of Stobs, and another upon 
the lands of Mr Elliot of Harrot. A little below the laft 
mentioned lime kiln, there is a place called Robert's Linn, 
where there are large rocks of pebbles, ot which are made 
feals and buttons of different kinds. Moft of the rock is of 
a light blue colour. There are other parts of it finely varie- 
gated with ftrokes of red and yellow ; and fo much are 
they efteemed, that great quantities are carried as far as 
ShelEeld and Birmingham. 

Popuiation, — The parifli at prefent contains about 700 
fouls. In Dr Webfter's report, the number is 530. The 
number of males and females are nearly equal. At an aver- 
age for thefe 20 years part, the number of births has beeu 
20, and that of deaths about 14. The number of fouls 
tinder 10 years of age- is - 150 

From 10 to 20 - - 150 

From 20 to 50 - - 300 

From 50 to 70 - - 80 

From 7e to 100 - - 20 

The number of farmers in the pariflb is 32, and that of their 
fervants 127. 

Cattle. The parifh at an average contains about 500 

black cattle, 9000 llieep, and 156 horfes. 

ProduSlions and Rent.—kt an average there are looo acres 
in tillage. As it is an Highland place, the crop confifts 
moftly of oats, barley, peafc, turnips, and potatoes. There 

arc

arc not perhaps above 20 acres fown with wheat. The land- 
rent of the parifli is L. 2830 Sterling. 

Church. — The value of the living, including the glebe, is 
L. 115. The Crown is patron. The church was repaired 
in 1777. The manfe was built in 1770. There are eleven 
heritors in the parifh, only three of whom repde in it. There 
are about 30 Seceders, and one Epifcopalian. 

Poor. — The number of poor receiving alms is 25. The 
annual amount of the contributions for their relief is L. 76 
Sterling. 

Einhient Men. — The immortal Elliot, Lord Heathfield, 
Governor of Gibraltar, who, with a fortitude, a vigilance, 
an incorruptible integrity, and a military Ikill, fcarcely to be 
paralleled in hiftory, defended that fortrefs againft the unit- 
ed forces, naval and military, of the houfe of Bourbon, was 
born in this parifh. 

Mtfcellatieous Obfervatlons. — The air is rather moift, but 
not unhealthy. No deftrudtive epidemical diftempers prevail 
in it. The cottimon fuel is pear, one horfe-load of which, 
when carried to market, is fold at is.; when bought on the 
fpot, at 6 d. There are 46 ploughs in the parifh, moftly of 
the Englifli kind, though fome ftill ufe the old Scotch plough. 
The mimber of carts is 70. There are three fingle-horiij 
chaifes, and only one poft-chaife. There is a Ipecies of 
Lriftol ftone fometimes found in the bed of the water. The 
number of handicrafifmen is 27, with 6 apprentices. There 
is only one woollen manufadlurer. None have been under 
the neceffity of leaving the parifh for want of employment ; 
nor have any emigrated from it, farther than to the neigh-

bouring towns or parifhes. None have ever periflied for 
want, nor have any been guilty of capital crimes, or even of 
thofe more petty offences which are punifhed by banifhment. 
The people in general are of a ftrong robuft make, and a 
good complexion. The greateft height of ftature any of 
them attain, is 6 feet 2 inches. There are 147 houfes in the 
parifh, and, at 'an average, 5 fouls in each family. The 
number of acres has never been exactly afcertaincd, but the 
parifli is famous for the beft breeding grounds, which pro- 
duce flieep of an excellent quality, and diftinguifhed for a 
fine ftaple of wool. The turnpike road from Edinburgh to 
Newcaftle runs through this parifh : It was made at the ex- 
pence of the county, and is kept in repair by the tolls. The 
people in general are convinced of the utility of public roads. 
Provifions are rather high. The prefent price of beef is, 
4I d. per pound. Early in the fpring, veal is 5 d. and feldom 
■under 34- d. at any feafon of the year ; mutton 4 d. and fel- 
dom under 3 1 d. ; even at the mofl plentiful feafon, good 
lamb is never under r s. 6 d. or i s. 8 d. /ifr quarter, and 
fometimes 1 s. Pork is commonly 4 s. or 4 s. 6 d. per ftone ;

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q635398">DRUMOAK</name>. 

(Cou7ity of Aberdeen.') 
By the Rev. Mr James Fraser.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation^ ^c. 

T N this part of the country, it is aliBoft always called 
Dalmaik. The church and manfe are fituated by the 
river Dee, on a haugh (in Erfe Dal) ; and near, a well, which 
has ftill the name of St Maik's Well. Yet it is almoft uni- 
verfally written Drumoak, and fomefinies Drumaok. It is 
Drumoak in papers above 150 years old. It lies in the county 
of Aberdeen, (except what belongs to the eftate of Leys, in , 
the weft end of the parifli, which is in Kincardinefhire), and 
in the prelbytery and fynod of Aberdeen. It is about four 
meafured miles from eaft to weft, and about two from north 
to fouth. 

Soil and Climate. — The foil is fhallow, and a great deal 
of it is only fit for flieep pafture. The air is dry and very 
healthy. 

Popuratton. — ^In 1790, the number of fouls was 708, of 
whom 321 were males, and 387 females. In Dr Webfter's 
report, the number is 769. In 1780, the number was 663 ; 
and in 1786, only 637. The annual average of births for 



3i6 



Stati/lkal Account 



ten years, ending in 1789, is exactly 20. During the courfe 
of that year, however, there were 30. For ten years, begin- 
ning 1692, (when our oldeft regifter commences), the ave- 
rage is 16. For ten years, beginning 1720, very near 21 ; 
and for the fame period, preceding 1780, a little above 18. 
The average of deaths cannot be afcertained, there being no 
regifter of burials. The grave-digger computes about 10 pa- 
riftiioners annually buried. The number of marriages is on- 
ly about 2 each year, fince June 1786. All the inhabitants 
are of the eftablilhed church, except one Epifcopalian. 

ProduBions. — No wheat is fown in this parifta, and but 
little artificial graffes, or turnips. The crops confift chiefly of 
barley and oats. There are about 2000 flaeep. Oxen are 
lefs employed in ploughing than formerly. The parifh gene- 
rally fupplies itfelf with provifions. 

Church.— Th-t ftipend is L. 37 : 7 : 9 and 28 bolls of meal. 
The glebe confifts of about five acres arable ground, and as 
much pafture fit for fheep. Mr Irvine of Drum is patron, 
and the only refiding heritor. There are other two non- 
refident. The church is fo old that no body knows when it 
was built : It has had frequent repairs. The manfe was re- 
paired 30 years ago. 

Po5,-._-There are about 20 poor people in the parifla who 
receive alms. The annual amount of the funds is about 
L 20, including L. 4 arifing from the intereft of legacies, by 
the Laird of Drum, to decayed tenants, or their widows, and 
to poor fcholars. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervat'ions .—Tht people in general live very 
economically. There is little change of property. Men 

fervants 



of Drmioak, 

fervants receive about per annum of wages ; women about 
2 1. ; labourers in hufbandry, i s. per day, or 6 d. and their 
vi£luals. Peats from the mofs, of which a certain quantity is 
allotted to each farm, are chiefly ufed for fuel. The roads 
are in good repair. The ftatute labour is partly performed 
in kind, and partly commuted. The beft arable land is rented 
at about 1 5 s. per acre. The number of farms is not dimi- 
nifliing. There are few inclofures *.

(County of Wigton.') 
By the Rev. Mr John Rose, </head>



<p>Name, Situation, ^c. 

THIS parifli is named Lefwalt. The origin of the name 
cannot be afcertained. It forms a part of that penin- 
fula commonly called the Rinns of Gallonvay. It is fituated 
in the county of Wigton, in the Prefbytery of Stranraer, 
and fynod of Galloway. Its greateft length is feven miles, 
its greateft breadth from five to fix, and where narroweft, it 
is three miles. The appearance of the parifli is much diver- 
fified with hills and plains, vallies, meadows, and large 
mofles. The part adjacent to Lochryan extends about three 
miles, is almoft level, and the foil is light and fandy, with a 
mixture of gravel. All this track is well cultivated, and, in 
moift feafons, yields excellent crops of oats and bear. The 
means of improvement, lime and fhells, are eafily obtained 
from the vicinity of Lochryan. On the fouth, the ground 
is hilly, wet, and fpongy, partly green, and partly covered 
with heath ; and, even on the higheft ground, there are large 
deep mofles. All this track is much fitter for pafture than 
tillage. Here little improvement has been made. There is 
indeed one fpecies of culture, which has been praftifed here 
very fuccefsfuUy ; that is, by pairing, or, as it is here called, 

ripping 



of Lefwalt, ^ip 

ripping and burning the fod, and fpreading the afties. After 
thefe operations, feme farmers have had feven or eight, and 
feme more, excellent crops of oats. In fome farms, the 
fame operations have been repeated on the very fame ground, 
three feveral times, and ftill attended with equal fuccefs. 
But it is remarked, that, after thefe operations, the grafs de- 
generates, becomes very coarfe, and refembles bent. On the 
fouth-weft and north-weft points of the parifh, the ground is 
very wet and fpungy, confifting of a deep clay, mixed with 
gravel, and is either green or covered with heath. The in- 
terjacent fpace along the Iriflii channel is much diverfified. 
In fome places the land is flat, partly green, partly covered 
with heath ; in other places there are fine green vallies, that 
defcend to the fhore in a variety of turnings and windings. 
The foil is either light and fandy, or deep mofs. The coalt 
is high, bold, and rocky. Here no improvement has yet been 
attempted, from the difficulty of procuring manure. Loch- 
ryan is fome miles diftant, and there are fcveral fteep pulls 
for carriages in the way. There is not a fafe port on the 
weft coaft of this parilh, for the importation of lime from 
Ireland ; though, at a fma^l expence, a very commodious one 
might be formed, much to the emolument of both proprie- 
tors and farmers. On this coaft there are great quantities 
of fifli, particularly excellent cod, of which fome are 
caught by the tenants, at the intervals of labour, for the ufe 
of their own families ; a few only are fold, and none export- 
ed. The ground in the middle of the parifh is high, and 
either green, or covered with heath. In fome places 
there are large tracks of deep mols. Hence little improve- 
ment has been made, except what has been done by Sir 
Stair Agnew, adjacent to his own houfe, where there are 
fome fields highly cukivated, and which produce excellent 
crops of clover and rye- grafs. There are alfo feveral ranges 



3S0 



Stati/iical Account 



of plantings feme old, feme young, and all In a thriving 
condiiion. 

Produdlionsy ^c. — As this parifli has not been meafured, 
it is impoffible to afcertain the number of acres that are in 
tillage, though it muft be confiderable ; as, befides affording 
a fufficicncy for the inhabitants, wheat, meal, and malt 
are fold at Stranraer, and there is an annual exportation of 
from 6 to 700 bolls of oats and bear, to Ayr, Greenock, 
and Port-Glafgow. Black cattle and flaeep are the articles 
upon which the farmers chiefly depend for the payment of 
their rents. There may be about 150© head of horned 
cattle in this parifh, and near 3000 flieep; but thefe laft are 
faft decrealing in numbers, as agriculture advances in its 
progrefs. There are 240 work horfes, and above 50 carts 
in this parifh. — There is no river in it, but there are 
two ftreams of water, called Solburn, and the burn of 
Pallanton, both abounding with fine trout, and, at fome dif^ 
tance from the fea, with falmon. The former empties itfelf 
into the bay of Lochryan, the latter, after many windings 
through an extenflve plain, into the bay of Luce. Upon 
the fides of thefe burns, there are large tracks of fine mea- 
dow ground, almoft to their fources. None of the hills in 
this parifli are of any confiderable height, though, from the 
peninfular fituation of the country, they command extenfive 
profpe£ls. One in particular, called the Tone of Cragach, 
a beautiful green hill, rifing in form of a cone, commands a 
full view of the Irifh coaft, the bay of Belfaft, the ifland of 
Arran, and fome of the other WeAern iflands. There arc 
plain traces of an encampment on the fummit of this hill. 

Climate, ^c. — The climate here Is mild, temperate, and 
^lubrious, though moift. There have been feveral inftancea 

of 



ef Lefwali, ^21 

of longevity fincc the fettlement of the prefent incumbent. 
One man hved to the age of 98, two to the age of 92, and 
there is one now hving aged 95. 

Population. — What the population was, at any former pe- 
riod, is not precifely known ; but it has certainly, of late, in- 
crcafed cbnliderably. This is not fo much to be afcribed to 
the progrefs of agriculture, as to a paflion that has prevailed 
for fome years, of taking feus in the villages. In the year 
1766, there were only 18 houfes in Clay hole, and now there 
are about 50. The man is ftill alive who built the fir it houfe 
in it. The number, in Dr Webller's report, is 652. The 
prefent population of the parifh, from an accurate furvey late- 
ly made, amounts to 1 194 fouls. Of this number there may 
be about 150 Irifli, three Englilh, and one Mulatto. Theie 
are in general either hired fervants or labourers. The 
births during the laft 12 months were 28, and the marriages 
eight ; but there were fome irregular marriages. 

Poor. — The poor are chiefly fupported by the weekly col- 
lections, and the intereft of a fmall fum of money fet apart 
for them. There are, at prefent, 1 3 upon the poor's lift. 
Few of the natives of this country are in very indigent cir- 
cumftances, but we have conftant lupplies from Ireland, of 
poor emaciated perfons, whofe very afpeft excites compaf- 
fion. Every week brings frefh cargoes to Portpatrick, and 
they are permitted to traverfe this country at large. This is 
a grievance that has been long complained of, but hitherto 
without redrefs. 

Church and School, ^c. — The ftipend is L. 49 : 18 : 3! of 
money, and 15 bolls of meal, of 16 ftone to the boll, and 
Vol. in. • S f • 4 bolk 



322 



Stat't/lical Account 



4 bolls bear, 1 2 bufhels to the boll. The valued rent of this 
parifh is about 3600 pounds Scotch ; the real rent L. 2000 
Sterling. There is a fchool-houfe near the church, where 
the youth arc taught for about five months in the year ; but 
towards the fummer feafon they are generally called off, to 
affift their parents in country matters. There is alfo a fchool 
at one of the villages ; but the perquifites are fmall, and no 
falary has been paid for near 50 years ; hence learning muft 
be at a low ebb. 

Antiquities, — Lochnaw Caftle is the only confiderabic 
building in the parifli. It is a very antient edifice, built on 
an elevated fituation, and feems to have been intended for a 
place of defence in former times. It was protected on the 
fouth by a deep fofl!e, the veftiges of which may ftill be 
traced ; and on the north by a lake of water, called Lochuaw, 
which has been drained, and its bed is now fine meadow and 
pafture ground. 

Mifcdlatieoiis Obfervations . — ^There are only three heritors 
in thl^ parifli, the Earl of Stair, Sir Stair Agnew of Loch- 
naw, Baronet, and Robert Vans Agnew, Efq; of Schuchan, 
Sir Stair Agnew is the only refiding heritor. It is not eafy 
to fay what the land lets at per acre, as the ground has not 
been meafured ; but the rents have been all doubled during 
the prefent incumbency, and the farmers live better, and have 
more elegance in their houfes, than formerly. Mr Vans 
Agnew's lands in the neighbourhood of Stranraer, that have 
been meafured, let at from 15 s. to 42 s. /^r acre. There 
are above 40 farmers in this parifli, who pay above L. 10 of 
yearly rent, and feveral tenants and fubtenants, who pay 
near that fum. There is only one farmer who pays above 
L. 100.— There are two villages in the eaflern extremity 

of 



of LefwalL ^23 

of the parifii, clofe upon Stranraer, and feparated from it 
only by an ideal line, called the Clayhole and Hillhead, 
which contains near one half of the inhabitants of the parifh. 
Mr Vans Agnew is the proprietor of the ground on which 
thefe villages ftand. He lets it out in fmall lots for building 
houfcs, at an eafy feu duty of 3 d. a foot in front of a houfej 
and allows 100 feet behind the houfe for garden ground. 
Such as choofe to flate their houfes, are exempted from feu- 
duty for four years, and this has encouraged many to make 
ufe of flate. The inhabitants of the villages arc generally 
tradefmen, failors, and labourers-, and fome of them rent 
fmall pieces of ground.

NUMBER XLIX. 
PARISH OF <name ref="NA">STOBO</name>. 

(County of Twecddak.J 
By the Rev. Mr ALEXANDER KeR. </head>



<p>Sittiatitn, Surface, ^c. 

THE parifli of Stobo is fituated in the county of TwejsJ- 
dale, in the prefbytery of Peebles, and fynod of Lo- 
thian and Tweeddale. It is about fix miles long, and between 
three and four miles broad. One part of the parifh is 
mountainous, and fit only for flieep pafture; another part of 
it is arable, and capable of cultivation. Some of the hills 
are green, but mofi: of them are covered with heath. 

Soil. — The foil of the arable land is various ; fome parts 
are a wet clay, interfperfed with ftones ; when drained and 
limed, they give good returns. There is another part, ly- 
ing on the fide of the river Tweed, which is a mixture of 
earth, clay, and fand. This land yields very good crops, al- 
though it does not, in general, receive from the farmer that 
jutlice, in point of improvement, which its quality deferves, 
owing to the inundatiops of the river Tweed, to which it is 
in many places expofed, and by which, in fome parts, it is 
over-run with a confiderable current. This land is peculiarly 
adapted for pafture. It produces a thick ftool of natural grafs, 
which is well adapted, either for fattening cattle, of for milk

co\v5, whofe butter, in refpeiH: of colour and richnefs, may be 
diftinguiflied from the milk of any other cows, which pafturc 
upon the higher grounds. The greater part of the land is a light, 
but fertile foil, lying upon a bed of graveL This foil, when 
properly cuhivated, never fails, when the feafon is fliowry, 
to produce excellent crops ; but, in a hot or dry year, it is 
very much parched, and, of courfe, the labour of the molt 
Ikilful and induftrious farmer is defeated. It may be obferv- 
ed, that the land is in general ftoney ; and, what is remark- 
able, in the hollows, where the ftones moft abound, (in 
fuch quantities, that a plough, when at the beam, does not 
reach the bottom of them), there the heavieft part of the 
crop upon the field is produced. It may be accounted for in 
this way, that the ftones, by fheltering or keeping warm any 
fmall quantity of foil, which is amongfl them, in the cold 
feafons, and by proteiting it from the fcorching heat of the 
fun, in the hot feafons, always occafion a good crop. 

Ploughs, bfc. — The Scotch plough Is chiefly ufed in the pa- 
rifh, as it is beft adapted to the nature of the ground. The 
practice of ploughing with oxen was for feveral years almofl: 
totally given up, till of late, that fome of the farmers have 
begun to revive that antient praftice. In flrong floney land, 
which is frequently to be met with in this parifh, oxen 
are preferable to horfes. The oxen move at a flow, but perfe- 
vering pace, and take the draught along with them ; whereas 
the metal of the horfe is foon raifed by refiftance and 
the whip j of courfe he becomes reflive and unmanage- 
able. The oxen have alfo the advantage of the horfes 
in point of economy, being maintained at much lefs ex- 
pence. The chief objedtion againft oxen ploughs is the 
flownefs of their movement j but, when the fuperior execu- 
tion of their work is confidered, where the ground is crofs 

and

and ftoncf, and that they can contmue in the yoke two hours 
longer than the horfes without any injury, the objedlion has 
little or no weight. 

Climate and Difeafes. — The fituation of Stobo is dry, and 
the air pure. The ftate of health, which the inhabitants in 
general enjoy, is the beft proof of the wholefomenefs of the 
climate, few or none of them being affe£ted with any pecu- 
liar difeafe. 

Rivers, — The river Tweed, which runs through this pa- 
rifh, and divides the north part of it from the fouth, has its 
fource in the parifh of Twcedfmuir, at a fountain called 
Tweeds Wellj about 1 8 miles diftant from Stobo, and 7 from 
Moffat. 

Antiquities. — The Sheriff Muir is the chief place which 
difcovers fome remains of antiquity. It is a flat uncultivat- 
ed heath, with fome ftones upon it, which have the appear- 
ance of being monuments ; from which circumftance fome 
have concluded that it muft have been once the fcene of bat- 
tle. But there is no record or hiftorical evidence of the 
fa£t. There are two erecl ftones of confiderable fize, about 
fix feet diftant, which are probably the fite of a grave, by 
fome fuppofed to have been a Druidical temple. From the 
center of the grave, there are a number of ftones about a foot 
high, eredled at regular diftances, and extending eaftward in 
a curved diredion. Two cairns are likewife raifed upon this 
muir, the one confiderably larger than the other ; both of 
them, it may be prefumcd, to perpetuate the memory of 
perfons of diftinftion. Not far diftant from the two ereft 
ftones already mentioned, is a large round cavity, in the form 
•f a bafon, called Pinkie's Hole ; it is about 90 paces in cir- 
cumference. 



of St oho » 

cumferencc, and, at the centre, is between 6 and 7 feet below 
the level of the adjacent plain ; whether it is the efFe£t of 
nature or of art, it is difficult to determine. There is an- 
other cavity near the largeft cairn, which is much larger 
than Pinkie's Hole, being about 1 40 paces in circumference ; 
but it is neither fo deep, nor fo regular in the formation, 
having a fmall ridge in the middle of it. There are alio, 
upon the muir, a few fmall circular appearances, which are 
evidently the effect of art. The Sheriff Muir is the place 
where the Tweeddale militia met. It was thought expedient, 
whilft the unfortunate animofity fubfifted between the filler 
kingdoms, that each county fliould embody a militia, who 
were fummoned to appear before the flieriff-depute on a cer- 
tain day, and at an appointed time and place. This muir be- 
ing both centrical for the county, and well adapted for muf. 
tering the militia, was the place appointed by the flieriff for 
that purpofe j hence it was called the Sheriff Muir, and ftill 
retains the name. 

Slates. — There are two feams of flate in one hill, nearly of 
equal quality, which muft have been wrought for many ages 
paft, as the oldeft houfes in the diftridt of country, to which 
they have been carried, are covered with them. The flates 
are of a dark blue colour, fplit to a proper thicknefs, and, for 
durability, and ftrength in proportion to their thicknefs, arc 
believed to be inferior to no flate whatfoever, as no decay is 
obferved in the flates of the oldeft houfes covered with them. 
The feams of flate having been long let, with a large farm in 
which they are fituated, little attention was given by the te- 
nant to the working of them, and the country was ill ferved 
with them 5 but the quarries are now wrought, to a great ex- 
tent, by the prefent proprietor, and his leffees, and the flates 
are faid to be much improved in Cze,

Statiftical Account 



Incloftires, is'c.—VAvt of the eftate of Stobo, contiguoug 
to the houfe, was inclofed early in this century, to which the 
prefent proprietor has added largely. The inclofures eaft 
from the manfe extend about a mile, and 'to the weft about 
two miles, and in depth, from north to fouth, from half a 
mile to a mile. The river Tweed is the fouth boundary. 
The fences are quickfet hedges, or dry flone walls. Inclofures 
are begun in other parts of the parifli, but hitherto they have 
made no confiderable progrefs. 1 here are few full grown 
trees in the parifh, except in the old inclofures of Stobo, 
where there are a good many ; and in the new inclofures, 
confiderable young plantations have been made of all kinds 
of trees ufually planted in Scotland. The farmers are in 
general fenfible of the advantages of inclofures. One farmei-, 
upon a three-ninetcen years leafe, has begun to inclofe part 
of his farm at his own expence ; and others, upon fliorter 
leafes, follcit the aid of their landlords, (who are not averfe 
to encourage them), to aflift them in making fmall inclofures. 

ProduBions. — Oats, bear, and peafe are the ftaple crops in 
the parifh. Wheat is fown, but in fmall quantities. Turnip 
is fown by thofe who have inclofures ; and potatoes are 
found to be fo generally ufeful, and the foil fo well fuited to 
the growth of them, that they are raifed by every perfon. 
Clover and rye-grafs are alfo fown, and fome fow as much 
flax or lint-feed as is neceflary for family ufes. There is 
more grain produced in the parifh than is neceflary for the 
maintainance of its inhabitants. 

Population. — The number of inhabitants, of which this 
parifh confifted, preceding the year 1734, is not afcertained. 
Trom the remains of old houfes and old towers, which are 
now much defaced, but arc ftill in the remembrance of old 

people, 



of Stobo, 



people, it appears that the population ia- confiderably dimi- 
riflied. The greateft part of the depopulation took place 
previous to the year 1734. If there is any decreafe fmce 
that period, it is very trifling, as appears from the examina. 
tion roll of the patifli at that time, compared with the exa- 
mination roll of this year. Since the year 1734 it has un- 
dergone fome changes in regard to numbers. In that yeat 
there were only 200 examinable perfons in the parifti, pcr- 
fons from eight years of age and upwards. In this ftate it 
continued till the year 1741 or 1742, when it had an increafe 
of numbers, from having the half of the parifli of Dawick 
annexed to it ; in confequence of this circumftance, the 
numbers were increafed from 200, to between 240 and 250. 
Of late years, however, the numbers have decreafed. There 
are at prefent in the parifh only 221 examinable perfonsj 
and 97 that are not examinable, or under eight years of age ; 
total, 318 fouls. Among this number there are 15 Seceders.- 
The number of males, from eight years of age and upwards, 
is 119 i the females, 102. There are 60 houfes in the pa- 
rifti, and 5 inhabitants, upon an average, to each houfe. In 
Dr Webfter's report, the number is 313. The births, for 
thefe eight years paft, are, at an average, about 9 per annum j 
during the fame period there have been 36 burials at the 
church, but then 1 3 of thefe perfons did not refide in the 
parifh at the time of their death ; fo that 23 only have died 
for thefe 8 years paft, being, at an average, about 3 per anmwK 
There have been only 10 marriages duriqg the laft 8 yeajrs. 

Churchy Isfc^ — The church of Stobo is Gothic, and appears 
from hiftory to be between 4 and 500 years old. The re- 
mains of a font, ait oven, and other apparatus peculiar to 
the Popifli church, are ftill to be feen. It was called in an- 
cient times the Parfonage of Stobo. It appears from the ori^

ginal rights of Lord Wigton, once patron of this parlfla, thac 
it was a parfonage, having four churches belonging to it, 
which were called the Pendicles of Stol/o, viz. the church of 
Dawick, upper and lower Drummelzier, Broughton, and 
Glenholm. Dawick is now annexed to Stobo and Drum- 
melzier, and what was called, in the original rights of Lord 
"Wigton, Upper Drummelzier, is now a diftincl parilh, and is 
C2\\td Tiveedfmuir Parijfj. i he ftipend is 49]. 8 s. lo^d. 
Sterling money, 60 bolls of victual, part of which is meal, 
and part bear. Belides the ftipend, the minifter of Stobo 
receives from Sir James Nafmyth 10 bolls of meal, which is 
converted at the Mid-Lothian Fiars, being the rent of one 
half of the glebe and grafs of Dawick annexed to Stobo. 
There is a manfe, and a glebe of 2 1 Englifh acres, which is 
all inclofed, and fubdividcd with ftone walls and quickfet 
hedges. The prefent incumbent inclofed the moft part of 
the glebe at his own expence. 

Poor. — There arc very few perfons at prefent upon the 
poor's hft j any fupport which they receive arifes from the 
weekly coUcclion?, and from the intereft of fome money 
which belongs to the kirk-feflion. 

School— Thtrt is but one fchool in the parifti, which is 
taught by the eftabliflied fchooUmafter. His yearly falary is 
5 1. II s. i\ d. There arc about 24 fcholars i from thofe 
that are beginners, or confined to the reading of Englifli, he 
receives one billing per quarter ; and from thofe that are 
taught writing and arithmetic, one billing and fixpence. He 
haJ a comfortable houfe, which was built about 15 years 
ago. 

Fuel. 



ef $tobe. 3^1 

Fuel.— Thzrt is no particular inconvenience which the in- 
habitants of this parifli labour under from its local lituation, 
but a difficulty of procuring fuel. There is no peat which 
can pay the labour of manufadluring. And as to the turf it 
affords, though generally ul'ed, it is of a very inferior quality. 
There is no good coal nearer than Lothian, which is 1 8 Eng. 
lifh miles diftant. 

Mifcellaneous Obfcrvailons. — The valued rent of the parilh 
is 2874 1. 9 s. 8 d. Scotch, the real rent about 1 143 1. Sterling. 
There are three proprietors, none of whom refide in the pa- 
I'ilh. ihe number of tenants is i r, their ploughs 14. There 
is an excellent breed of flieep in the parifh, they are reraai^c- 
ably found and healthy, of a middle fize, and in number 
about 5000. There are 81 horfes, and jpo black cattle in 
the parifli. There are alfo a good number of black cattle, 
moftly of the Highland kmd, which are bought either early 
in the fiimmer, for the purpofe of feeding, or in the 
autumn, in order to eat up the foggage or after- grafs. The 
high road which runs through this parifh, and which is com- 
monly called Stobo Hedges^ from its being bounded on each 
fide by a hedge for fome miles, was completely made fome 
years ago. The roads which join it, on the weft and eaft, 
have alfo been made of late years. The flatute labour is 
commuted. There is no turnpike in the parifli. There are 
two bridges over the Water of Lyne, which is the boundary, 
on the eaft, between this parifti, and thofe of Kew- 
lands, Lyne, and Peebles. Qne of them was built by contri- 
bution within thefe few years ; the other, thou;;!i an old 
bridge, is very fuflicient, and makes the accefs between this 
and Peebles very eafy. The bridge which was lately built 
over the Water of Lyne, was m coufcquence of a road be- 
ing made along the fide of Lyne Water, which joins the

Peebles road upon the eaft, and the Kirkcurd road upon the 
weft. This road is completely finiflied, and is of great ad- 
vantage to travellers coming from the weft country by the 
Way of Peebles. There is alfo a bridge over Biggar Water, 
which is the boundary on the weft between this parifli and 
Glenbclm, This bridge opens up a free communication be- 
tween this parifti and the road leading to Moffat.

Situation, Extenty ^c. 

TH E united parifhes of Larbert and Dunipace are fitu- 
ated in the county of Stirling, about feven miles 
diftant from the town, lying towards the louth-eaft, and are 
within the prefbytery of Stirling, and fynod of Perth and Stir- 
ling. Each parifli hath its own church and kirk-feffion. Thefe 
churches were originally two chapels, belonging to'the abbot 
of Cambulkenneth, near Stirling : But, at the Reformation, 
they were erefted into different charges ; and, fince that time, 
have been under one minifter. The extent of both parifhes, 
from eaft to weft, is about eight, and frpm fouth to north, 
about two miles. They are generally level ground ; and the 
foil is partly of a light dry nature, and partly clayey. 

Minerals, — There is plenty of free.ftonc and coal in both 
pariflies ; but no coal is wrought at prcfent, except at Kin- 
aaird and Quarrole, which lie in the parifli of Larbert. 

Population. — In former times, the parifli of Dunipace was the 
moft populous j but now the population there is greatly dimi- 

niflied) 



334 Staii/lical Account 

nifhed, owing to the heritors taking the land into their own 
hands, and appropriating it to pafturage for large cattle, flieep, 
&amp;c. The population of the parifh of Larbert has increafed in 
a very large proportion. There are about 3000 people in it 
above 1 2 years of age, confequently about 4000 in all In Dr 
Webfter's report, the number is 1 864. There are feveral vil- 
lages in faid parifli, but no market town. The number of han- 
dicraftfmen in Larbert parifli is about 1500. In the parifli of 
Dunipace, there are only about 80. The annual average of 
marriages in the parifh of Larbert is about 31, which is ta- 
ken from the records. The births in It are about 60 ; but, 
on account of the different feftaries, there are a great many 
who are not recorded. Of deaths, there are about 38 ■, 
but there are feveral inhabitants in the parifh of Larbert who 
have their burying places in other pariflies, and the deaths 
of fuch are not inferted in our records. At an average of 
three years, there are, in the parifh of Larbert, i 7 baptifms, 
5 marriages, and 10 burials. 

MatiufaBoy'ies. — The nnanufadtories in both pariflies arc 
very confiderable. In the parifli of Dunipace, there are a 
printfield, and a cotton-fpinning manufaftory. In the parifh 
of Larbert the famous Carron works are fituated, which is 
one of the greatefl: founderies in Europe. There arc about 
1000 workmen employed, and about 150 carts for driving 
coals, iron-f^one, &amp;c. The works confift of 5 blaft furnaces ; 
16 air furnaces ; a clay mill for grinding clay and making fire 
bricks for the ufe of the faid furnace an engine that raifes 
4 tons and a half .of water at one ftroke, and, on an aver- 
age, draws 7 ftrokes in a minute. This engine goes in tlie 
time of drought, and confumes 16 tons of coal in 24 hours. 
Befides the coals confumed by this engine, there are 120 
tons burnt every day in the works, and by the inhabitants 

belonging 



of Larbert and Dunipace* 



belonging to them. Befides the air furnaces, there are 
3 cupola furnaces, that go by virtue of the blaft furnaces, by 
pipes conveyed from the machinery of the blafts. Their 
bufinefs is much the fame with the air furnaces. There are 
alfo 4 boring mills, for boring guns, pipes, cylinders, &amp;c. 
One of the boring mills .is adapted for turning the guns on 
the outfide. They have likewife fmiths forges for making 
the largeft anchors and anvils, as well as fmall work of vari- 
ous kinds ; befides a forge for making malleable iron,^ and a 
plating forge : Alfo a forge fo/ ftamping iron, the hammer 
of which, with the helve, are both of cafi: metal, and weigh 
a ton and a half. A nail manufactory is likewife carried on 
in Larbert parifh to a confiderablc extent. 

Church. — There are po places of public worfliip, es;cept the 
eftablifhed churches of Larbert and Dunipace. 

Produce, ^c. — Neither parifli can fupply itfelf with 
meal, owing to fo much ground being laid out in pafture. 
In both parillies, there are about 50 acres fown wich flax, 
and as much with grafs. There is no ground in common 
in either, except where the great cattle tryft is held three 
times in the year. It is a dry muir, belonging to Sir Michael 
Bruce, where, it is computed, there are between 26,000 and 
30,000 cattle coUedled at the Odober tryft. The advantages 
er)joyed by both, are plenty of coal, and, from their vicinity to 
the great Canal, water carriage to and from the Eaft and 
Weft feas at an eafy rate. Of courfe, they have plenty of pro- 
vifions brought to them from many diftant places. 

Aritiquit'ta. — Near the Carron works once flood the famous 
Arthurs Oven, called by Buchanan Templum 'Termini. Seve- 
ral Danifh forts, or obfervalories, are in thefe parifties ; one 

at 



33^ 



Staiijiical Account 



at Larbert, another at Braes, in the parifli of Dunipace, and 
a third in Upper Torwood. There are two artificial mounts 
in the parifli of Diinipace, near the church. Each of them 
cover, at the bafe, about an acre of land. They are up- 
wards of do feet high, and raifed in a conical form. The 
reafon of raifing them is faid to be for a memorial of a peace 
which had been concluded there between the Romans and 
Scots *. A part of one of the mounts, towards the weft, was 
carried away (as Buchanan fays) by a flood in the river Car- 
ron. At what time this happened is uncertain but the 
courfe which the river had then taken, when it made this 
encroachment on the mount, is ftill vifible. The great Ro- 
man Caufeway from Carmuirs, (where the Roman camp was, 
in the parifh of Falkirk), which croffed the river Carron by 
a bridge, weft of the village of Larbert, and went almoft in a 
ftraight line to the caftle of Stirling, is ftill entire in many 
parts, both in the parifli of Larbert and Dunipace. In 
Dunipace parifli is the famous Torwood j in the middle of 
which there are the remains of Wallace's tree, an oak which* 
according to a meafurement, when entire, was faid to be 
about 12 feet diameter. To this wood Wallace is faid to 
have fled, and fecreted himfelf in the body of that tree, then 
hollow, after his defeat in the north. Adjoining to this 
is a fquare field, indofed by a ditch, where Mr Donald 
Cargill excommunicated King Charles IL 

Schools. — In the parifli of Larbert there are five fchools, 
the principal of which is the parifli fchool in Stenhoufe- 
muu-. The number of fcholars, in general, is between 60 
and 70. The annual falary is 100 1. Scotch, and 1 1. Ster- 
ling

two hills. They were the Duties pads or hills of peace.

marriages, and certificates, &amp;c. amount in general to 8 1. 10 s. 
Sterling. In the fchool at the village of Carron-fhore, there 
are about 40 fcholars, and the fame number in the li.ho. l at 
the village of Larbert. In another fchool at the colliery of 
Kinnaird, about 24 fcholars are taught, in the parirti khool 
of Dunipace there are about 40 fcholars. The fees per 
quarter are the fame with the parilh fchool of Larbert. i'he 
annual falary is 100 merks Scotch; the mafter has 1 1. Ster- 
ling per annum for being leffion clerk. The pfrquilites arif- 
ing from baptilms, marriages, &amp;c. amount to 1 1. 4 s. 8 d. 

Mifcellaneous Ohfervations, — The great road that leads from • 
Stirling to Edinburgh, goes through both par;(hes, upon 
which there is a toll- bar at the Torwood, This road is 
maintained by the toll ; and other crofs roads are repaired 
by ail afleffment laid upon houfeholders, and the ftatute work 
of.the farmers. The land rent is generally between 20 s. and 
"^o s. Sterling per acre. There are leveral funds in the pa- 
rilh of Larbert, belides the poor's rates, and colledtions 
at the church door. The firll was erected by the Carron 
Company loon alter they began their works, for the be- 
nefit of their workmen. The members belonging to this 
fund are about three hundred and twenty. There .ire three 
public houles in the pariQi of Larbert ; one at Carron, 
and two in the village. There is one in the parilh of Duni- 
pace, on the I'oad from Siirling to Glafgow. But alehoules, 
or rather what may be called whifliy houfes, are very nume- 
rous in both thcfe parilhes. In ihefe houles a drink of good 
ale cannot be got ; but aquavitae is to be had in abundance. 
It has even got tlie better of feme of the fair lex, who 
inftfad of being admired, then become the abhorrence of 
fober men. In general it is obferved to be hurtful to the

taken too often, or to excefs. There are fix heritors in the 
parifli of Larbert, viz. Sir Michael Bruce, Bart, Colonel 
Dundas, Mr Bruce of Kinnaird, Mr Strachan of Woodfide, 
Mr Caddel of Banton, and Mr Miles Riddell of Larbert 
and three in Dunipace, viz. Mr Morehead of Herbertfliire, 
Mr Johnfton of Denovan, and Mr Spottifwood of Dunipace ; 
each of whom keeps a four wheeled carriage. It is worthy 
of being recorded, to the honour of thefe gentlemen, that 
during the great fcarcity in 1782 and 1783, they voluntarily 
raifcd the afleffment upon their property from 20 s, to 30 5. 
Sterling on the 100 1. Scotch of valued rent, for the fupport 
of the poor ; befides importing grain, which they fold be- 
low the market price to all who applied for it. Mr Bruce 
of Kinnaird, the famous Abyflinian traveller, has lately erec- 
ted an elegant monument of caft metal, over the vault 
wherein his lady and eldeft fon are interred, which is much 
admired by ftrangers. Ther^ have been 40 houfes built 
within thele 10 years, befides one gentleman's feat in the 
parifh of Larbert, and only four taken down within that 
period. Servants wages are very high in comparifon of what 
they were formerly, being about 10 1. per annunty befides 
their board ; lb that between the increafe of rents, and the 
high rate of wages, the hufbandman is often put to great dif- 
ficulties. Such as employ cottagers feem to be eafier, and

Namey Extent^ ^c. 
QOME have conje£lured, that in the old Scottifh lailgUdgfe 
^ the parifli was called Pennivgham, firft, becaufe it is the 
head on the north end, next to Cree Water, of the whole 
county and fliire of Galloway ; and that the laft fyllable in. 
old times denoted head. Secondly, becaufe the parilh is aU 
moft furrounded with water, and therefore has beeti called 
Penningham, in allufion to its being a large pemnfiila. But 
this is given more from conje£ture, than from any fubftantial 
rcafon that can be afligned ** Penningham lies in the pro- 
vince 

* Since writing the above, the foUoVping remark has been 
tranfmilted, which is given verbatim. It appears thai Scotland, 
as far as the Frith of Edinburgh, was poifeired by the Saxons t 
Hence the etymology of many places in that dillrift of coun- 
try ; as, for example, the termination ton, is equivalent to the 
word toivn, affixed to many names, and ferves to corroborate 
•this remark* It is not unlikely, therefore, that the termination 
hat?i or ghame may be equivalent to the word dale, which is to 
be found in the names of many places, both in England and 
•Scotland, when inhabited by the Saxons : For, a^ Cunningham

vince of Galloway ard county of Wigton, and is one of tliofe 
parifees of which the prefbyteiy ot Wigton is compoled, 
"ihe pariQi is at leaft j6 miles long from its two' greateft ex- 
tremities ; and upon the north end, above the military road^ 
it is 5 broad ; on the fouth end 6\ miles. The military road- 
pafles through the middle of the parifli, leading from New- 
ton Stewart and the Water of Cree, to Stranraer and Portpa- 
trick. 

Rivers. — The river Cree, by the affiftance of the tide* 
from tlie fea, is navigable within 2 miles of the towns of 
Newton Stewart and MiunigaC This river, after making va- 
rious turnings and windings, for about 4 Englifh miles in 
length from the above towns, at laft empties itfelf into a bajr 
of the main ocean, oppofite to Wigton, the county town up- 
on the weft, and Cree Town, the parifli of Kirkniabreck, 
and llcwartry of Kirkcudbright uj on the eaih In the ufual 
feafons, plenty of faimon are caught in this river,, and it\{ 
at moft rbalonable rates, generally 2 d. per pound,, and not 
above 3 d. at the higheft. It is remarkable for a certain fpe- 
cies of fmall fifli, which come in great quantities in fpring. 
They are exceedingly good, and fent to the mofi: diftant cor- 
ners of the country. The name they arc^ commonly called 
by, is fpcrllngs or fmclts. It is faid that they are not found in 
any other river, except one or two, in all Scotland, 

Church The ftipend is 1240 merks Scotch, th-e cxpence 

of lacramental elements included. The manfe was let iome

Dak^ therefore it is not an improbable conjefture, that the name 
Penningham may be originally derived from the fame root, al- 
though the exaft mciining of the tirft fj liable Penning^ or Pcn- 
virt, does not clearly appear.

years ago, and, by the carlefsnefs of fervants, burnt to the 
ground. The prefent incumbent is allowed, by the heritors, 
8 1. 14 s. yearly in lieu of it. The glebe is very indifterent, 
and far from being legal, being let only for 8 guineas yearly. 
The valuation of ' the parifii is 6151 1. Scotch. 

Population. — The number of fouls in the country parti 
of the parifli are at leaft 900 : Thofe in Newton Stewart 
will fully amount to iioo, making in all 2000. The increafe 
of the inhabitants in this particular village of Newton- 
btewart is amazing. Its origin does not exseed 85 yeara. 
The proprietor, (Caftleftewart), a fecond fon of the Gal- « 
loway family, wifely viewed it as a proper place for erefting 
a village, and therefore built a houfe or two at his own 
expence, in order to begin it. The humour of building and 
feuing, from the example fet by the proprietor, prevailed a*- 
mong the people, and ever lince lias been increafir.g. What 
has greatly promoted the above humour was, the throwing 
a large and beautiful bridge, at the north end of the town, 
over the Water of Cree, by which the fhire of Galloway 
and ftewartry of Kirkcudbright are united with the old and 
new towns of Minnigaff, on the oppofite fide of the water. 
This bridge, built upwards of 40 years ago, is of great ad- 
vantage to the public in general, and to the town of New- 
ton-Stewart in particular. The return to Dr Webfter, ia 
1755, was 1509 fouls. 

Zoil and Produce. — The grounds above the military road, 
which divide the parifb, are far inferior to thofe below on 
the fouth end, except a few fpots on the Water and Loch 
of Cree, which, if properly improved, are capable of raifing 
excellent crops, being warm and fertile. The other fide of 
this upper end of the parifli, is greafly inferior to the eaft 
fide, and very moorifh. Still, however, the grounds, even 



34t 



Staii/lical Account 



in their wild and natural ftate, are capable of fupplying the 
inhabitants and their families with plenty of grain ; and, what 
is very extraordinary, there is not any part of the ground in the 
whole parifli, however wild or barren, but what might be im- 
proved fo as to fupply the inhabitants with provifions. The 
upper end of the parilh, on which fnow may be fuppofed to 
lie for fome time, yet is feldom or never covered with it above 
three, four, or fix days at the utmoft ; but in the adjoining 
parifhes of Kirkcowen, Colmonell, and MinnigafF, it will re- 
main for weeks, nay fometimes for months. This is judged 
to be owing to its being fituated between two large rivers, 
and the land lying much lower than that in thefe other pa- 
rilhes. The wool in the parilh in general is good, and fupe- 
rior to that of moft of the neighbouring pariflies. It is much, 
run upon, and commonly gives about los. 6 d. per {ionc. 
The foil in general, on the fouth end of the parifh, is ex- 
ceedingly good. The land is fertile, and much of it has of 
late been improved with fliells and lime, and produces un- 
tommon crops of corn, rycgrafs, and clover. The grounds 
indeed are ftoney, except what is immediately upon the wa- 
ter fide, and occafions a good deal of expence in clearing 
them off; but, when done, the labour and expence are am- 
ply repaid. The moft remarkable fpot of ground in the pa- 
rilh, is a corner of it called the Mcfs of Cree, lying along 
the fide of the Water of Cree. It begins at a port called 
Cartyy about 2 miles from Newton-Stewart, where fmall vefTels 
can be brought with fafety into it, either with merchant 
goods from the Englifli fide, or with lime, coals, and fliells } 
and extends, in length and breadth, to about 4 Englifli miles. 
It is of a deep clay bottom, and was once undoubtedly cover- 
ed with the fea, and afterwards with wood; for large trunks 
of trees are ftill found in different parts of it. The tide 
oomes up the Water of Cree, very nigh to the town of New- 
ton-Stewart, 



of Penningham» 

ton-Stewart, and in a very forcible manner, making vafl: and 
daily encroachments ; but what the land lofes on one fide, is 
commonly regained on the other. 'I'his part of the parifli 
is uncommonly fertile. The inhabitants living upon this 
niofs, though every day in water up to the mid -leg, in courfe 
of their ordinary employments, and dwelling in mud or clay 
houfes, are, notwithftanding, the healthieft in the parifh, and 
arrive at the greateft age. They feldom complain of any 
ailments. It has been obferved, by fome families in the 
neighbourhood of the Mols of Cree, whofe houfes are built 
upon higher ground, that the land in the Mols of Cree ap- 
pears to be fweliing and increafing in height ; and, fay they, 
we would not be furprifed, if one day it would take a float- 
ing, and be all carried into the ocean, which immediately ad- 
joins to the fouth end of it, as the Solway IVTofs in Annandale 
did fome years ago, and the Waters of the fea return again to 
their former channel, and overflow it a-new,. 

Zheep. — The number of flieep, fo far as can be calculated 
with any degree of exaftnefs, amounts to 9840. 

School. — A regular fchool is kept for teaching Latin, Eng- 
lifli, writing, and arithmetic. The falary is 10 1. yearly. 
The number of fcholars is about 50 through the year. The 
whole emoluments, including fchool-wages, falary, &amp;.c. are 
reckoned to be 30 1. yearly.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q972353">POLMONT</name>. 

{County of Stirling.) 
By the Rev. Mr William Finlay, </head>

<p>Name, Sittiatioti, Exteiit^ ^c. 

THE parlfli of Polmont was disjoined from that of Fal- 
kirk in 1724. The derivation of the name is un- 
certain ; but one of the titles of the Duke of Hamilton, viz. 
Lord Polmont, is taken from it. The parifh is fituated in 
the county of Stirling, prefbytery of Linlithgow, and fynod 
of Lothian and Tweeddale. Its greatefl: length is 5 miles, 
and its breadth 2. It is interle(5led by the Frith of Forth on 
the north, and the river Avon on the eaft i and partly by the 
great canal. 

Solly C/itnaie, Minerals^ ^c. — A confiderable part of the 
parifli is of a rich carfe ground, and very fertile ; the average 
rent of which is 2 I per acre. The reft is high, and of a light 
foil, but moftly in cultivation, except a fmall part of moor, 
and about one eighth, or one tenth, in common. The cli- 
mate is remarkably healthy, even in the low carfe diftricls. 
Seed is fown in March or April, and harveft generally takes 
place in September. There are feveral mineral fprings, im- 
pregnated with iron, from the great quantities of iron ore in 
the higher grounds. The fhore of the Frith (if it may be fo 

called) 



of Folmont. 34_j 

called), is flat, pretty extenlive at low water, and covered 
with lleetch. Tliere are feveral confiderable quarries of 
free-ftone, two of which are conftantly wrought for building, 
and employ from 12 to 14 men. There are alfo leveral coal 
mines, chiefly belonging to the duke of Hamilton. 
principal one is that at Shieldhill, in the moor fouth from 
Falkirk, which is let in leafe to the Canon Conipany, and 
produces about 500 tons per week, of a remarkably fine qua- 
lity This coal work employs about 250 people, men, wo- 
men, and children, and from 40 to 50 horles. It yields, to 
the proprietor, about 500 1. per anniim\ befides the protit of 
the iron-ftone, which is wrought from the old coal-pits, ?nd 
is fold to the Carron Company at lod. per ftone weight, 
above the exnence of working it, and affords conftant employ- 
ment to about a dozen of people. 

Population. — ^According to the report fent to Dr Webfter 
in 1755, the population then amounted to 1094 fouls. It 
muft therefore have increafed confiderably fince that period, 
as it now amounts to about 1400. Of thefe the fiir greater 
part refide in the country, there being only a few houfes 
near the church, and about 50 fauiilies who have feus on the 
turtjpike road, which lies fouth from it. The average of 
births, for thefe lafl: five year;, is 64 ; of deaths, during the 
fame period, 5'3, and of marriages, 22. The average num- 
ber of perfbns to each family is 3^, there being 400 houfes 
in the pArl/h and not one of them uninhabfted. Of thefe 
there are ten, which Vnay be properly ftiled villi^, being pof- 
fefied by genteel families, hnt wi;hout any great 'extent of 
property. The building of thefq houfes, and the concomi- 
tant improvernerus of the cotintry, occalioning a demand for 
labourers, have been the chief caufes of increafinp the po- 
pulation, as well as of preventing emigrations, of which

there has not been a fingle inftance from this diftrift, for 
thefe five years paft. There are about 200 houfehold fer- 
vants, male and female, in the parifli, the former of whom 
get from 5 1. to 8 1. 3 year, and the latter from 2 1. 10 si to 

Churchy Stipend, Isfc. — The living, including the glebe, is 
worth about 90 1. per annum at an average. The Crown is 
patron. The church was built in 1732, and has had no re- 
parations fince, except being plaftered in the roof and walls 
in 1785. The manfe was built a few years after, and got 
fome trifling repairs in 1784, and, in 1785, newofiice houfes 
were built. There are about 40 heritors, 20 of whom are of 
the fmaller fort. All the people attend the eftablifhed church, 
except a few Seceders. There are no Epifcopalians, and only 
one Roman Catholic. There arc at prefent 17 regular pen- 
lioners, who receive alms from the poor's funds, befides thof?" 
who receive charity occafionally. The annual amount of the 
funds for their relief is about 28 1. Sterling. 

General Ckara^er, ^c. — The people, in general, are fober 
and induftrious. None have been indidted for any crime, or 
baviiflied, thefe many years, one only excepted. They mea- 
fure from 5 feet 8, to 5 feet 10 inches. There is only one 
individual in the parifh 6 feet 3 No particular manufactures 
arc carried on in it. 'I he expence of living is rather upon the 
incrfafe of late years. Landed property has not changed 
often, and what has been fold lately has drawn 30 years pur- 
chale, and in general higher. On the whole, the people en- 
3oy the ufual comforts and advantages of fociety, and appear to 
1?? very well contented with their fituation and circumftances.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5875994">HODDOM</name>. 



( County of Dumfries.) 



By the Rev. Mr James Yorstoun. </head>



<p>Situation^ E)4tenty ^c. 
HE parifh of Hoddom lies in the county of Dumfries, 



A and in that divifion of it called Annandale. It is fitu- 
ated about i6 miles fouth-eaft from the town of Dumfries, 
and belongs to the fynod of Dumfries, and prefbytery of An- 
nan, extent of the parifti is, in length, about 5 miles, 
and, in breadth, about i\. Its form is fomewhat quadran- 
gular. The prefent parifti of Hoddom confifts of three pa- 
riflies united ; Hoddom, Line, and Ecclesfechan. It is now 
almoft a century and a half fince thefe pariflies were thrown 
into one. In each there is ftill a glebe belonging to the mi- 
nifter. 

Rivers, — The rivers conne£led with the prefent parifh are 
the Annan, the Milk, and the Mien. The river Annan 
runs along the weft fide of the parifli, and is enlarged by the 
fupplies it receives, in a courfe from the north, of about 26 
miles. About 6 miles to the fouth, it empties itfelf into the 
Solway Frith. The fifli in this river are falmon, trouts, Sec. 
Though there be as yet no fcarcity, yet, it is to be obferved, 
that there never have been fo many fifli in the river fince the 




land 



348 Statiftical Account 

land began to be manured with lime. This manure being 
waflied from the land into the river by floods, is fuppofed to 
be very fatal to every fpecies of fifli. Ihe Milk walhes 
only a fniall corner on the north-weft of the parifli, and then 
empties itfelf into the Annan. It runs from the eaft. The 
extent of its covrfe is about 14 miles. It abounds whh fmall 
fifli, and IS an excellent river for trouting. The Mien, whicli 
is fo Imall a"s hardly to deferve the name of a river, runs alfo 
from thi eaft. The extent of its courfe is about 6 miles. It 
runs acrofs the. parifli. dividing the old parifli of Hoddoni 
from that of. Line, and then empties itfelf into the Annan. 
This rivukl is concinually changing its channel, and dama- 
ging the land lying alongft its banks. 

Surface and Soil.— The land of the parifli conflfls partly of 
•high, partly of low ground ; and it may be added, that the 
low ground contains a confiderabie extent of holm. The Ibil 
may be cialTcd unutr three kinds: ift, The holm land, 
which lies by the banks of the Annan on the weft, and by 
thofe of the Mien, towards the eaft of the parifli. The land 
"near the banks of thefe rivers is all, excepting a few fmall 
fpots, a deep and a rich loam, collected by the rivers, and. 
exceedingly fertik. The next is that in the body of the pa- 
rilh, where there is a plain of about two Iquare miles. The 
foil in that plain is lij^ht and gravelly, but pretty free from 
flones ; and, with proper culture, and a i'euion not remark- 
ably dry, produces rich crops both of corn and grafs. 1 he 
third 13 that towards the northern parts of the parilh, where 
the ground riles, from the plain in the body of the parifli, 
in a gradual and gentle afcenr, flncly expofed to the fouth 
and iouth-weft. The foil here inclines to clay; much of 
it lies upon a cold till fome of it upon a rock ; but, 
when properly limed, is almoft as-produaive as the low 

lands.

lands. A few farms to the eaft, on the march of Mlddlebie, 
and a few to the north, on the march of Tundergarth, have 
not the fame expofure, but the loil is the fame. On the 
weft fide of the old parifti of Line, a' confiderable tracl bf 
land lies wafte, the moft of which could not admit of cul- 
ture ; but, excepting this and a few other places, all the land 
in the prefent parifh of Hoddom ifi arable ; and, indeed, the 
greateft part of it has actually been ploughed. 

Iticloft4res and Produce. — About 22 years ago, not a fence 
or dyke of any kiptl was to be feen in the whole parilh. 
Now, almoft every fiirm is furrounded with a good fence, 
either of ftone or hedge, moftly of the latter ; and feveral 
farms are divided into parks or inclofiires. The grain crops 
are principally oats and barley. In fbme particular Ipots, 
wheat may be feen ; but fo little of it, as not to deferve 
being particularly mentioned. The mode of culture com- 
monly adopted is, firft, manuring the land with lime, 
when that is judged neceflary ; then breaking the ground, 
and taking from it two crops of oats fucceffively ; then 
manuring the land with dung and taking from it one 
crop of barley, then taking from it other two crops of oats ; 
and, after thar, fulFering the land to reft for about four years. 
This is the method which is commonly followed ; but there 
are individuals who purfue a different method, and lay out 
their fields both with judgment and rafte. The quantity of 
grain, produced in the parifli, greatly exceeds that which is 
confumed by the inhabitants. 1700 Carlifle bufhels of bar. 
ley, 400 Carlifle bufhels of oats, together with 3500 fione 
weight of oat-meal, are computed to have been, for thefe 
three years paft, carried out of the parifh. annually, at an 
average. Some of this barley is exported to Greenock, but 
the greateft part to Lancafhire and Cumberland. It muft 

not, 



Siatifiical Account 



not, however, be underftood that all the grain carried out 
of the parifli, is over and above what is confuraed by the in- 
habitants. Both meal and malt are brought into the parifti 
from other places, and fold in fmall quantities to thofe who 
cannot afford to lay in a ftock. But the quantity brought in, 
bears no proportion to that which is carried out of the parifh. 
The vegetable produce, not included in grain, confifts chiefly 
of potatoes, the chief fuftenance of day-labourers, and the 
lower clafs of people. Few if any of thefe are exported. 
Almofl every cottager keeps a hog or two, which he fattens ; 
and, by the affiftance of thefe animals, the inhabitants are 
enabled to confume almolt the whole potatoe produce of the 
parifh. A few fields are allotted for turnips. Of late years, 
a confiderable quantity of ground has been laid out in fown 
grafs. The quantity allotted for flax and hemp may not 
exceed 12 acres. There is one farm in the parifli which it 
may be proper particularly to mention, on account of its ha- 
ving been lately converted into a dairy, a new thing in this 
part of the country. It is the farm of Relief ; belongs to Mr 
Pulteney and is let to a perfon from Cheftiire, who had ac- 
quired the knowledge of dairy- work in that country. Cheefe 
is there made of the fame kind with that made in Che- 
fliire, and is fold at 4§ d. per pound. The butter, which is 
made from the thick of the whey, is fold at 6 d. per pound. 
This dairy conflfls of about 200 acres. 40 cows were kept 
upon it lafl: feafon. The quantity of cheefe made and fold 
amounted to the value of 140 1. SterHng, and of butter to 
the v^lue of 1 1 1. Lafl: feafon was unfavourable ; and it is 
expeaed that a confiderably greater quantity of cheefe and 
butter will be made this feafon. The ftock of milk-cows is 
alfo to be increafed this feafon, by the additional number of 
ten. 




9f Hoddom* 



Curioftties. — Two places deferve to be mentioned, on ac- 
count of their curiofity, and conneclion with antiquity. The 
one is the hill of Burnfwark, famous for its particular form, 
(which, from its fmoothnefs and regularity, has all the appear- 
ance of art), for the extenfive view which it commands, and for 
the veftiges of Roman works, which may be diftindlly traced 
on the fides, and on the top of the hill *. The other place 
is Hallguards, being the place on which the old caftle of 
Hoddom flood, faid to have been the feat of one of the fa- 
milies of the Bruces. This caftle is faid to have been de- 
molifhed fome centuries ago in compliance with the terms of 
a border treaty. It was rebuilt by Lord Kerfes, in the days 
of Queen Mary, but removed to a fituation on the other lide 
of the Annan, where it now ftands. The hiftory of this 
caflle, and alfo of the Tower of Repentance, will probably 
be given in the account of the parifh of Cumbertrees, ta 
which they belong. 

Church. — ^The living, including the ftipend and the value 
of the three glebes formerly mentioned, amounts to lool. 
The manfe is old, and in wretched repair. The offices are 
in good condition, having been very lately built. The right 
of prefentation is vefted in the Duke of Queenfberry and Mr 
Sharpe of Hoddom, who have exercifed it by turns. 

School. — ^The fchoolmafler's falary is only 61. 13 s. 6d, 
befides quarter wages, which have ufually amounted to up- 
wards of 10 1. per annum. 

* For a more particular defcriptJon, confult Gordon's Iti- 
nerary, in which is drawn ^ plan of the jhill, and the works 
upon it. 



Stattftical Account 



Poor. — The poor's funds confift of a capital of 400 I. Ster- 
ling. This capital originated from two mortified fums ; the 
one a fum of 1 1 19 1. 19 s. 4 d. Scotch money, mortified to 
the poor of the parifli in the year 1701, by Mr James Alex- 
ander, through whofe means, chiefly, the three pariflies were 
united ; the other, a fum of 1 000 merks, mortified by John 
Sharpe of Hoddom, in the year 1715. By the intereft hav- 
ing, from difi:erent caufes, been fuffered to accumulate, thefe 
fums have fwelled to a capital of 400 1. Sterling. Befides 
the above, the weekly colle£tions produce about 1 2 1. Sterling 
per annum. 

M'lfccllaneous Ohfervat'ions . — There are few pariflies fo well 
provided with roads as thai of fioddom. It is divided lon- 
gitudinally almofl into two halvts, by the turnpike road lead- 
ing from Gratenay to Moffat j and there are five crofs roads, 
all of which are equal to turnpike. It may be proper to 
mention the conveniency of its fituation, in regard to one of 
the priiicipal commodities for improvement, viz. lime. Lime 
of excellent quality i- to bt got in great abundance, within 
the diflancc of 2 niiles. This, together with the good roads, 
has of late years greatly increalcd the value of the land, and 
wealth of the inhabitants. The commencement of improve- 
ments in this parifli, and within the county of Dumfries in 
general, may be dated from the year 1777, when a particu- 
lar adl of Parliament was obtained, authorifing a certain de- 
fcription of heritors, to afl"els the p.roprietors of land, and 
their tenants, in an annual fum, not exceeding 12 s. on each 
1 00 merks valuation, for the fpecial purpofe o[ repairing and 
fupporting the different highways in each parifli within the 
county. Before that aiH: was obtained, moft of the roads 
were unmade, or had been repaired in a very fuperficial 
manner ; and in that diflridl of the county called Annan- 
dale 



of Hoddom, 353 

dale, altnofl: the whole of the roads were iinpaflable dunng 
the winter feafon. The power grunted by the a£t 1777, has 
enabled the gentlemen of the county, who have exerted 
themfelves with much laudable zeal, to repair, in the courfe 
of 14 years, almoft every road of confequence in the "-tlpec- 
tive pariflies. The four great roads within the county, 
which lead to Edinburgh by Langholm, to Edinburgh and 
Glafgow by Moffat, to Portpatrick by Dumfries, and to 
Ayrfhire by Sanquhar, as alfo the road from Annan to Lang- 
holm, are now turnpike roads, and have all been effeftually 
repaired fince the year 1777. The tolls upon them produce 
about 1700 1. per annum ; and no county, either in Scotland 
or in England, can boaft of having better roads than 
the county of Dumfries. From this caufe alone, Dumfries- 
fliirc has become a great thoroughfare. The improvement 
of the foil has been great, rapid, and fubftantial. Lime, the 
only manure ufed for the improvement of wafte lands, can 
now, by means of the good roads, be without any difficulty 
tranfported to a confiderable diftance at all feafons. The 
great, almoft the only drawback, which this parifh fuftains, is 
the want of coals. Our diftance from thefe is about \6 
miles, which renders their carriage by land very expenfive ; 
and the unreafonable oppreffive tax laid upon coals imported, 
renders their carriage by fea ftill more burdenfome. 

In the account of the parifh of Hoddam, the village of 
Ecclesfechan muft not be omitted. It conlifts of 105 lioufes 
and 500 inhabitants. In this village there are two well fur- 
rilhed inns, where paflengers meet with good accommoda- 
tion, and may be provided with poft chailes and poft horfes. 
There are 2 inns of an inferior kind, 22 tippling houies, and 
8 fliops. It has been a poft town fince the year 1788. The 
mail coach, which runs between London and Glafgow, palles 
and repafles every 24 hours ; and every day is a poft day in

Ecclesfechan, for London, Edinburgh, and Glafgow. The 
revenue, arifaig from the poftage levied upon letters and pac-» 
kets, at the poft-office in Ecclesfechan, amounts to 120I. ^fr 
annum. But the chief things for which Ecclesfechan de- 
ferves to be mentioned, 3re its fairs and markets. In 
this village a market is held every month, befidcs two 
fairs in the year. Thefe fairs and markets, befides con- 
vening the inhabitants of the country around, draw crowds 
of people from the Border, and even from the Englilh fide. 
On thefs occafions there is frequently a good (hew, and a 
great fale of horfes and black cattle. Hawkers and pedlars 
get a number of their goods difpofed of^ and a good deal of 
bufinefs is tranfafted in the way of fettling accounts. On the 
markets preceding the terms of Whitfunday and Martinmas, 
many attend for the purpofe of hiring fervants for the en- 
fuing half year. In former times, thefe meetings uled ijever 
to part without fome bloody encounter j but, through the 
progrefs of civilization, this Border^ or rather barbarous {^^irii^ 
has of late been gradually ciecreafing, and, in a fliort time, it 
is to be hoped, will ceafe to exift. 

Befides thefe fairs and monthly markets, there has lately 
been efiabliflied a weekly market for fwine, which promifes to 
be of great advantage. Formerly, the only market for fwine, 
near this place, was at Longtown, a village on the Englifti fide 
pf the Border. About 4 years ago, fome dealers being of 
opinion, that a market in Ecclesfechan would be more con- 
venient for many of the inhabitants of this part of the coun- 
try, propofed to efl:ablifli one in this village. — A market for 
fwine was advertifed to be held every Friday, from the begin- 
ning of January to the beginning of May. It was firft held 
jn January 1788, and has fince continued according to the 
original eaablilhment. During thefe 4 years, upwards of

looo cai-cafcs of fwlne, at 4 Si per ftone, which will amount to 
2 1. 8 s. each carcafe, have been fold at an average each feafon. 
Moft of this pork, with a great quantity not brought to the 
market, is made into bacon in this country. After being pro- 
perly manufactured and dried, it is fold commonly at 6 s. pef 
ftone to different dealers, by whom it is exported to different 
places in England. A great quantity is exported each feafon 
to London, by a perfon who refides in Ecclesfechan. Of late 
years this parifh, as well as thofe in the neighbourhood, have 
been comfortably fituated in regard to frelh provifions. 
Formerly, there was rarely any frefli butcher meat to be got 
nearer than Dumfries ; now, one may be very well fupplied 
from Ecclesfechan twice in the week during fummer, and 
once in the ten days or fortnight during winter. And, from 
Annan, one may be regularly fupplied twice in the week 
during the whole of fummer, and the greateft part of winter. 
This is a great convenience to the inhabitants of this place, 
who, not long ago, were fubjedted to the trouble of fending 
to Dumfries, which is 16 miles diftant, at all times, when 
they ftood in need of frefh provifions. It would not be do- 
ing juftice to the place, to omit mentioning the objedls which 
contribute to its beauty and pleafantnefs. A place is always 
pleafant where there is much wood, water, and dry ground. 
All thcfe contribute to beautify Hoddatn, and to render ic 
the moft delightful fpot in Annandale. The three rivers 
have already been defcribed. The fields, lying on the banks 
of thefe rivers, particularly the Annan, are charming, being 
moftly holm land, dry, and at the fame time rich, and fur- 
roilnded with beautiful banks of wood. On this fide of the 
Annan, one large wood, confifting of birch, oak, and afh, 
afcends from the river about a quarter of a mile, and extends 
alongrt its banks about two miles. Part of it goes beyond 
the bounds of this parifli. A foot path, always dry and 

clean, 



35^ S'tali/ifcal Account 



clean, makes a moft delightful walk from one end of the 
wood to the other. One may walk for the fpace of twa 
iniles together, enjoying all the way the charms both of wood 
and water, in their utmoft perfection. On the other fide of 
the Annan, the.hill of Woodcockair rifes from the river, in 
a pretty ftcep afcent, for about a mile, and is covered with 
one of the fined woods in the fouth of Scotland. This is 
an obje6l, to thofe on the oppofite fide, at once pleafant, 
from the beauty which it exhibits, and comfortable, from 
the flielter which it affords. Mention has already been made 
of the large plain in the body of the parifli : The road from 
Dumfries to Carlifle by Ecclesfechan runs through it. On 
each fide of the road, this plain is divided into inclofures^ 
fenced with hedges, and interfperfed with clumps of oak 
and afli. To the traveller coming from Dumfries, who has 
to pafs through a wild, bleak, hilly traCl of country, this vale, 
at firft view, appears like a paradife.

By the Rev. Mr James Lauder. </head>



<p>Situation, ts'c, 

THE parifli of Dun is fituated in the county of Angus, 
fheriffdom of Forfar, and prefbytery of Brechin. It 
is very near in the middle between the towns of Brechin 
and Montrofe ; is about 4 miles in length, and as much in 
breadth ; is bounded on the weft by the pari£h of Brechin, 
and on the eaft by that of Montrofe. Between thefe two, 
there is an excellent high-road, kept ii; good repair by the 
gentlemen and tenants, fo that at prefent it has no need of 
turnpikes. It is bounded on the fouth by the parifhes of 
Maryton and Kinnaird, which laft is now annexed to that 
of Farnel, and on the north by the parifties of Strickathrow 
and Logic. 

Churchy tsfc. — The kirk is within Mr Erlkine's inclofures. 
It appears antiently to have been a chapel belonging to the 
family of Dun, the manfion-houfe of the family having been 
built very near to the church.yard. The glebe, I think, con- 
fifts of little more than 5 acres, very good arable land. 
The ftipend may amount to between 72 1. and 80 1. comtnuni' 
kus amisf as a great part is paid in victual. The church is in 

good 



Stati/iical Account 



good repair ; it has two loftSj ^one to the ead, the other t» 
the weft. The eaft end of the church is ftiled the choir, and 
has a fount in the wall, intended, of old, for baptifm. 

Name, l^fc. — The name of Dun feems to be taken from 
the proprietor, who was called Dun of that ilk. It is iaid 
that one of the name of Erlkine married the heirefs \ but 
when that happened, is difficult to fay, as it is known oniy by 
family tradition. Others derive the name from the Gaelic 
JDunis, which fignifies, in that language, a hi// or rifing 
ground j and it is indeed on a ground pretty much elevated 
above the river South Efk, or fouth water ; for £/k is faid, 
in Gaelic, to fignify ivater. There is a very elegant bridge 
over the river, confifting of three large arches, finely orna- 
mented. It was built in the 1787, and opens an eafy and 
fafe pafTage over the river, which was formerly very dange- 
rous ; and many lives were loft, by venturing to crols it when 
in flood, or covered with ice. There is a good falmon fiftiing 
upon the river, which abounds with trouts of various kinds, 
viz. fmouts. which appear in the month of May, and continue 
till the end of J une. They are thought by fome to be falmon fry, 
the catching of which has been prohibited by thofe who have 
the falmon flfhings in leafe. There are likewife plenty of 
fea trouts, about 12, 18, or 20 inches in length ; befides a 
trout called a finneck, which appears in the months of July 
land Auguft, and difappears tovrards the end of September. 
There are alfo many other kinds of trouts, which fecm to 
be paffengers, as they appear only at certain featons of the 
year. 

Soi/ and Produce. — The lands upon the river fide confift 
of a clay foil, and produce excellent wheat and barley. 
There are about 30 bolls of wheat fown in the parifl^, befides 

great 



ef Dum 361 

great quantities of barley, oats, and peafe. Potatoes are 
commonly planted about the middle of April, and turnips 
about the middle of June. Some farmers feed cattle with 
turnips, which turn out to very good account, as there 
is a great demand for butcher meat, the parifh being fitu- 
ated in the neighbourhood of the two populous towns of 
Montrofe and Brechin. There are but few fheep kept in this 
diftrift, (as they are thought prejudicial to the fown grafs and 
hay), excepting iuch as are neceflary for the ufe of the inha- 
bitants. 

School. — There is one public fchool in the parifli. The 
legal falary of the fchoolmafter is only 100 nlerks, too fmall 
encouragement to obtain a properly qualified perfon for that 
office ; and therefore the heritors, minifter, and principal 
tenants in the parifh, have fubfcribed a certain fum in addi- 
tion to the legal falary, in order to make up a tolerable living 
for the fchoolmafter. 

Populatiotti — The number of parilhioners, in the year 1750, 
by the late incumbent's examination roll, amounted to 506* 
Afterwards they increafed greatly •, for in the years 1760, and 
1766, they amounted to 640. But after that period, when 
many fmall farms were converted into one, the numbers de- 
creafed, and at prefent do not exceed 500 fouls. In Dr Web- 
fter's lift^ the number is 657. There is a regifter of mar- 
riages, births, and burials, kept, an extract of which, for ten 
years paft, is as follows :

were two tumuli of earth, covered over with Itones.

By the Rev. Mr David Campbell.</head> 

<p>Situation, Extent, life. 

THE parifli of Southend, in the prcfbytery of Kintyre, 
and lynod of Argyle, lies at the extremity of the pe- 
ninlula of Kintyre Its length, from caft to weft, is about 
II miles, and its breadth, from north to fouth, is about 
5. — On the north and eaft, it is bounded by the parifli of 
Campbeltoun, and on the weft and fouth, by the Irifli fea, 
the breadth of which, to Ballycaftle, is about 7 Itagues. 
Between the two countries, however, there is not much in- 
tercourfe or commerce. The Irifli bring over fome black 
cattle, and carry back fmall horfes in return. A ferry boat 
is always in waiting in this parifh ; the "fare of the whole 
boat is 15 s. in fummer, and 20 s. in winter. They fome- 
times go to the oppofite coaft in one tide, and return with 
the next. 

Surface, ^c,- — This parifli exhibits a beautiful and varie- 
gated profpeft of hills, neither high nor rocky, and vallies, 
through four of which fmall rivers flow ; and on each fide 
of thofe vallies, there art farm houfes at fmall diftances from 
each other. The rivers frequently overflow their banks,

and change their courfe, to the great injury of the commu- 
nity. Within thefe 40 years, a great part of the higher 
grounds, which formerly were covered with heath, have been 
converted into arable and parture land. Prior to that time 
there were no carts in the parift), and very little lime made 
ufe of, for the cultivation of the land ; but of late a fpirit 
of improvement has prevailed among the inhabitants, rrofl: 
of whom cover two or three acres yearly with lime, and 
would do much more in this refpeft, were it not for the 
fcarcity of fuel. The peats are not fo fit for the purpofe, 
and are at fome diftance. There are coals at the diftance of 
9 or 10 miles j but they are not fo good as thofc to be had 
in Ballycartle in Ireland, from whence, or from Ayrfliire, 
they would readily carry theui, were it not for the tax impo- 
fed upon coals carried coaftways, which is a great hindrance 
to the improvement of this part of the country. There is 
no draw-kiln for burning lime, but one built by an Englifii 
farmer for his own ufe. All the other farmers make their 
kilns of turf. 

Produce. — The produce of the country is oats, barley, po- 
tatoes, and beans, and in greater abundance than Icrves to 
fupply the inhabitants. There is alfo fome wheat and rye 
cultivated in the parifh. Some hundred bolls of barley, 
meal, and potatoes, are yearly fold in the neighbouring town 
of Campbeltown ; and Ibme of thofe articles are exported 
from hence to Clyde. About 400 bolls of barley are diftil- 
led within the bounds of the pariih. 

Populatioti. — The number of examinable perfons, from 8 
years old and upwards, is near 1000; confequently the total 
population is about 1300. In Dr Webfttr's report, the 
number is 1391. The average of Chriftenings, for the la ft 



of Southend, ^65 

10 years, is 60, and of marriages, 14. The language of above 
two thirds of the inhabitants is Gaelic ; the remainder fpeak 
Engli{h. Both, however, know as much of each other's 
language, as qualifies them to tranladl all matters of bufinefs. 

Curiofities. — There are no very remarkable natural curiofi- 
ties in this parifli. There are feveral caves, but not of fuch 
a fize as to merit much notice. Along the coaft there arc the 
remains of fome Danilh forts, the moft confiderable of which 
is in Balemacumra, on the promontory commonly called the 
Mull of Kintyre, near the place where a light-houfe has been 
lately ereded, which is of great fervice to velTels from Eng- 
land, from the north, the weft of Ireland, and America ; 
fpveral of whom fuffered formerly in dark nights, or when 
the promontory was covered with fog. The old caftle of 
Dunaverty deferves to be mentioned, as the fcfene of fome 
hiftorical events. There is, on one lide, a tremendous preci- 
pice hanging over the fea ; on the other, the hill on which 
it is fituated rifes in the form of a pyramid. Nature was 
affifted by art in making this a very flrong hold. The 
fea nearly furrounds it ; and the foflee, covered with a 
draw-bridge, after which two or three walls, one within 
the other, fortified the afcent. On the top of this rock 
the Lord of the Ifles had one of his cafiles, in which 
Robert Bruce took refuge for fome nights, during his ad- 
verfity, as appears from l\is life, by Archdeacon Barbour. ' 
There, alfo, Alexander M'Donald, known by the name of 
Alifter, fon of Coll Kittach, who had raifed a party of irifh 
and Highlanders, calling themfelves Royalifts, to afllfl: Mon- 
trofe in the civil wars, had his laft palladium ; 300 of his 
men were purfued by General Leflie, and befieged there ia 
the year 1647. Being reduced to great difl:rtfs by the want 
of water, they were pcrfuaded to furrendcr at difcretion } af- 
ter

tcr which they were barbaroufly malTacred. The general, 
on this occafion, feems to have been a nice cafuift ; he 
thought he kept his word, by diftinguifliing between the 
difcretion of the Eftates. (which was the exprefllon made ufe 
of in the treaty), and his own difcretion, by which they 
were put to dea^h. His adjutant general, Sir James Turner, 
in his account of this tranfaclion, leems defirous to lay a 
fhare of the guilt to the account of a Mr Nave, who urged, 
that fparing the enemies of God and the kirk, would involve 
him in the like fin and curfe of Saul, in fparing the Ama- 
lekites. To fliew mercy to them, however, adds the hifto- 
rian, virould have been more like a Chriftian. 

Not far from this rock is the ifland of Sanda, above a 
mile and a half in length, and half a mile in breadth, famed 
as the place of rendezvous for the Danifli fleet, in their ex- 

"curfions to thcfe coafts. Hence it went under the name of 
Avona Porticcfa, and is flill fometimes called Aven. Sanda, 
however, is the more ancient, as well as the more common 
name, as appears from St. Columba's life by Adomnan. In 
this ifland there are the remains of an old Popifh chapel. 
There are alfo two other fmall. iflands at the eaft. fide of 
Sanda, well calculated for keeping (heep ; and about a league 
to the fouth of it, there lies a dangerous rock, called Pater- 

fon^s Rock, above a mile in circumference. Several veflels 
have been endangered, and fome lofl upon this rock, which 
is always covered at high water, but vifible at low water. In 
the found of Sanda, which is a league diftant from the conti- 
nent, there is plenty of cod ; and along the whole coall of 
the parifli, the people are abundantly fupplied, at proper fea- 
fons of the year, with haddocks, whitings, fkate, mackerel, &amp;:c. 
On the water foot of Carilkey, alfo, there are fcveral hundred 
falmon taken in a good fealon. The cafual mention made

above of St. Columba, leads the author to obferve, that, till 
about 1 20 years ago, there were two churches in this parifh^ 
one dedicated to that faint, and the other to St. Blaan. The 
walls of St. Columba's chapel are ftill pretty entire ; but of 
St. Blaan's there is no veftige. It was probably carried away 
by the river, which paffed near it. Moft of the burial ground, 
which belonged to it, has been demolifhed in the fame man- 
ner, within a century back. 

Between St. Columba's chapel and the Caftle of Dcinaver- 
ty, there is a bank of fine coral, above 1 00 yards from the 
fea mark. If the farmers had fkill and induftry to drag it 
into boats, it would be of great fervice to them ; and it is 
found to be better manure for moifl heavy lands even than 
lime. The fmall quantity of it, found after ftorms, has been 
of fignal fervice to gardens and outfield lands ; and when 
fcattered upon moor lands, it wears out the heath in a few- 
years. There is alfo, in fome vallies here, and along the banks 
of the rivers, what is commonly called Fuller^ s earth. 

Church. — The Duke of Argyle is patron of this parifh, 
and has the greatefl fhare of the property in it. There 
are 7 other heritors, 2 of whom generally refide in it. 
The ftipend was only 50 1. till about 16 years ago, when the 
minifter commenced a procefs before the Court of Seflion, 
and, after fome years litigation, he obtained an augmentation 
of 1 61. 12 s. lOyd. The whole living, at prefent, including 
the allowance for communion elements, with a manfe, and 
glebe confifting of 6 acres, amounts to 75 1, no part of it be- 
ing paid in visual. A new church was built in 1774. There 
is alfo a parochial fchool, with a good houi'e, accommodated 
with 4 acres of land, given by the Duke of Argyle at a mo- 
derate rent.

J-'oor, — The number of poor in the parlfli lift is about 24» 
The aiuount of the colie£tions at the church door is about 
12 1. a year, which is occafionally diftributed, according to 
their necellifies. There is no mortification, or any other 
fund of provifion for ihe lupport of the poor, and fome of 
them are under the neceffity of going about to beg. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — The rental of the parifli is a- 
bout 3C00I. Sterling yearly. The price of provifions, at 
prt^fent, is 22s. the Kintyre boll of meal, at 10 ftone each; 
12 s. the boll of potatoes ; and 3|d. the Englifh pound of 
beef. The wages of men fervants, maintained in the houfe, 
are about 7 1. yearly ; and of women fervants, nearly half as 
much.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q621538">APPLECROSS</name>. 



{County of RofsJ) 



By the Rev. Mr John M'Queen. </head>



<p>Origin of the Name. 

APPLECROSS is a fanciful defignation, alTumed by one 
of the proprietors of that part of tlie parifli, from 
which it derives its name. In commemoration of this, 
five apple trees were planted crofs ways, and have lince, in 
form, been perpetuated by his fuccelTors. The antient and 
only name by which it is known in the language of the coun- 
try, is Comrich, a Gaelic word fignifying protcBion ; a name 
implying the immunity of the place in antient times, this 
having been the feat of a cloifter, and, as fucb, an afylum. 
for all, who either from perfecution, or merited punifli- 
ment, fled for protedliion. 

Situation, — ^The figure of the parifli is irregular, being fre- 
quently interfered by the fea, and having, in the centre of 
one of its moft populous diflrifls, a few farms which form 
a part of the parifli of Lochcarron. It is fituated in the 
county of Rofs, prefljytery of Lochcarron, and fynod of 
Glenelg.

Siati/lical Account 



Extent.— Hht extent of the parifh is confiderable, but 
cannot, with precifion, be afcertained, as there is neither 
public road nor bridge, from one extremity of it to the other. 
The foot traveller is guided, according to the feafon of the year, 
what courfe to take, over rugged hills, rapid v?aters, and deep 
and marfhy moors. Befides here, as in all the adjoining pa- 
rifhes and Weftern Ifles, the computation of miles is merely 
arbitrary, always terminated by a burn, cairn, well, or fome 
fuch accidental mark, which renders them fo remarkably un- 
equal, that it is impoffible to reduce any given number of 
thefe imaginary miles to a regular computation. The extent 
pf fea coaft, talcing it in a dired line, by the opening of every 
bay and creek, is upwards of 20 miles -, or following the 
fliore, in all its curves and windings, cannot be under 90 
miles long. Though in general high and rocky, yet, ii^ 
fome parts, it is flat and fandy. The courfe of the tides 
is all along from the north. There is no current worthy of 
pbfervation. 

Surface and Soil. — ^The general appearance of the parifh is 
hilly, rocky, and mountainous. Yet amidft thefe hills, cover- 
ed with heath, and dreary to the fight, are vallies both beauti- 
ful and very fertile ; but being detached by hills, lofty, ajid 
often inacceflible, the foil is exceedingly various. The (hal- 
low is the moft prevalent, which frequent rain nouriflies in- 
to a ftate of fertility, of which it would otherwife be deficient. 

Climate and Crop.-^Thz climate, like the furface of the 
country, is remarkably unecjual. The fame day is often di- 
verfified by the appearance of all the different feafons ; and 
though occafionally we may have iome trafts of dry weather, 
yet at no period can two fucceffive days be wholly depended 
on. The hulbandman hath, in all his operations, the cli- 



of Applecrofsi

mste to combat. The ground is prepared, either with the 
plough or crooked fpade, a clumfy hand implement, point- 
ed with a piece of iron four or five inches diameter, which, 
though ludicrous to the eye of a ftranger, is abfolutely ne- 
cefla-y in fliallow ftoncy ground, where it is impoffible for 
the plough to move, or for the hand fpade to be ufed ; yet 
it muft be acknowledged, that it is often employed without 
neceffity. Oats, potatoes, and barley, are the crops of the 
parilh ; which, as foon after the middle of March as the 
ground is properly dried up from the winter ftorms, are .ov/n 
in regular fucceffion, with as little intet-ruption as the wea- 
ther permits. Small oats are much, if not principally ufed, 
a hardy grain, which, though neither fo fruitful nor fo noi:- 
rifliing as the large, Is found to be beft adapted to the leve- 
rities of the climate. The early oats have been tried, but 
abandoned, as precarious and uncertain. Potatoes are much 
cultivated, and ferve as a fubfiitute for bread dmong the 
lower clafs of people, neai-ly for two thirds of the v/hole 
year. In a rainy climate, early crops are not to be exped'tedj 
yet this parifh, notwithftanding its local difadvantages, is re- 
markable for an early harveft. The harvefts 1782 and 1783, 
were Angular over all Scotland. The barley was then cut 
in October, and the oats not got in till the end of Novem- 
ber yet thefe were years of plenty ; the general fcarcity did 
not afFeft this parifh, whofe crop would bear a comparilbn 
with any year's fince that period. But it is to be obferved, 
that this is not a corn, but a grafing country, whofe crops 
i-arely fupply the parifli with meal, a confiderable quantity of 
furface being wafte and ufelefsi 

Animalsi — Black cattle is the great article, from which the: 
farmer principally derives his emolument, and the landlord 
his rent* There are generally about 3000 black cattle,

^mall and great, in the pari Hi. During the fummer and har- 
veft, they pa ft lire upon the low grounds, which produces grafs 
of a finer and more nourifliing quality, than is to be found 
in any part of Sky, or the other adjacent illands. The cattle 
are for the moft part coupled, i. e. have but one calf between 
every 2 cows by thefe means the calf is better fed, a greater 
quantity of butter and cheeie is manufactured, the bulling fe- 
cured, and no fuperfluous ftock kept on hand. Except in the 
dittridl of Kifhorn, the number of horfes is very inconliJer- 
abie. ' The flieep are all of the fmaileft kmd j their mutton 
is firm, fat, and juicy. Goats are kept for private uie ; their 
milk is the earliell fupply to relieve the neceflities of the indi- 
gent J and palturing, among rocks and precipices, inacctllible 
to other cattle, their milk is thought to contain fome medi- 
cinal virtues. The hills abound with deer ; 30, 40, or 50 is no 
uncommon fight in a flock. Roes, badgers, and otters, are 
likewiie to be found. The kingsfilher, cuckow, water- 
wagtail, fwallow, and corncraick, are the migratory birds of 
the parifh. There is fome moor game ; but the wetnefs of 
the moors, and the number of foxes in the neighbourhood, 
fo noxious to the hatched young, prevent their increafe. 

FiJJj, — The haddock, cuddie, Ikate, whiting, and flounder, 
are to be got all along the coaft of this parifli ; but not being 
ufed for exportation, and having no ready market at hand, 
they are only fought after, either to gratify the defire, or re- 
lieve the neceflities, of the prefent moment. The herring 
occafionallv frequents all our bays, creeks, and harbours, 
which are numerous, aud being a favourite fifli, not only -for 
exportation, but for home confumption, it is in all feafons 
greedily purfued. From the middle of July to the nth of 
September, it is in its greateft perfe£lion and from the begin- 
ning of November to the nth of December, though not fo 

good,

good, is thought richer than at any after period. Cod and 
ling are caught on different parts of the coaft. The cod is 
in its beft feafon from the middle of February to the end of 
March ; but ling is caught from the middle of March to the 
end of July; yet thofe fifhed for the firft two months are 
reckoned the beft. Our rivers, though fmall, are very rapid ; 
they abound with trout, and thofe of Firdon and the river of 
Applecrofs, produce fome falmon. Fifhing is a favourite oc- 
cupation of the people of this parifh ; they derive much of 
their fuftenance from the fea. Each principal farmer hath 
generally a boat of his own ; and among the lower clafs, 
either two, three, or four, make a joint purchafe, according 
as their circumftances will permit. There are befides five 
velTels, of from 20 to 40 tons, employed in the fifhing, one 
of which belongs to a fifliing company, founded at a confi- 
derable expence, by Mr M'Kenzie of Firdon, one of the he- 
ritors of this parifli. The patriotic exertions of this gentle- 
man merit much praife ; and as fuch an eftablifliment, by af- 
fording a ready market, ajid an example for improvement to 
our fifliers, doth naturally quicken and improve their induf- 
try, the public is interefted in its fuccefs. 

Exports and Imports Black cattle, butter, cheefe, fifh and 

kelp, are the exports of this parilli. All thefe articles, with- 
in the laft 30 years, have nearly doubled their value. The 
number of cattle annually fold may amount to 300, which, 
of late years, at an average, draw about 2 I. 15 s, The price 
of fifli varies according to the quantity caught. Herring, 
packed for home confumption, give from us. to 15 s. the 
barrel ; but, if repacked for exportation, 4 of thefe barrels 
go to make up 3. Cod and ling are fold, either by the dozen, 
or by the ton ; when by the dozen, the price depends on 
the fize of the filli j if by the ton, it fetches from 12 1. to 

15I.

Siati/lical Account 



15 I. Ster'-ig. Oli3n and Greenock are the markets moft 
commonly frequented. Kelp, prior to the American war, 
fold at 3I. 10 s. the ton; the price has fince been fludluat- 
ing, nearly between 5 1. 5 s. and 4 1. 15 s. There will be a- 
bout 50 tons annually brought to market. A greater quan- 
tity could be manufactured, but a confiderable portion of the 
ware is appropriated for manure to the dilFerent farms. It 
may not be improper to obferve, that clofe to the harbour of 
Poldown, there is a fhelly fand, which, when ufed with difcre- 
tion, not only meliorates the ground for corn ; but after it 
is laid on, introduces, for a few years, excellent crops of 
white and red clover. Meal, and all other articles, (except- 
ing thefe now fpecified), which either the neceflities or con- 
■^eniencies of life require, are imported into this parifli. 

Proprietors and Refits. — There are three proprietors. The 
principal heritor conftantly refides in the parifli, and pays 
four fifths of the ftipend. The eftate hath remained in the 
family for more than two centuries ; nor hath there been an 
acre fold in the panfli for lome generations. The rents, In- 
clufive of kelp, exceed 700 1. Sterling. The lands are great- 
ly fubdivided. There is only one farmer who pays upwards 
of 40 1.; the general run of rents being from 10 1. to 2L 
Sterling. 

Occupations and Wages. — In a country deftitute of trade 
and manufaftures, diftin£l occupations are not to be expeEledi 
All the inhabitants of this parifh are, in fome degree, farm- 
ers and fifliers. Every man is the architedt of his own houfe j 
and though there be a few nominal flioemakers, fcarcely a 
boy of fifteen but makes his own brogues. There are feveral 
boat-wrights and weavers, the former generally maintained by 
their employers, and paid by the piece j the latter, make

their demand in money, but are paid in meal, at the conver- 
fion of half a mcrk Scotch the peck. There are 3 fmlths 
(when no private ftipuiation Cakes place), for the farm work ; 
they are paid in meal, by an immemorial affeffment on the 
different farms. Antiently they had the head of every cow 
that was flaughter^d in the parifh, a privilege they ftill claim, 
but it is rarely complied with. There is but one miller, who, 
by means of the detached fituation of his mill, can accom. 
modate but a very inconfiderable diftridl of the parifh ; all 
the refl of the corn is either carried to the mill of the neigh- 
bouring parifh, or grinded by a hand mill c.illed a quern. 
The wages of domeflic fervants, for the year, are from ? 1. 
to 3 1. Sterling, for men ; and from 10 s. to 1 1. Sterling for 
women. There are no ftipulated wages for day labourers ; 
they generally exadl, according to the exigencies of the em- 
ployer, excepting in the few farms adjoining to the refxdence 
of the principal heritor, who, having aboliflied fervitudcs, 
has fixed the wages of men working at peats at 6 d. and of 
women, at 4 d. a day ; both to furnifh their own vifluals. 

CharaEler. — Of that indolence and inquifltivenefs, for which 
the Highlanders were formerly fo remarkable, little is now 
to be found in this parifh. The people in general are regu- 
lar, and very induflrious. The ufe of fpirituous liquors is 
rather too prevalent, yet there are fewer inftances of grofs 
intoxication, than at any former period : Antiently they 
drank rarely, but always to excefs ; now frequently, but for 
the niofl: part with moderation. There is not fo much as a 
tradition of fuicide in the parifh, nor of murder, but one, 
during the prcfent century. For 20 years paft, only one 
perfon hath been imprifoned for theft, who foon afterwards 
inlifled for a foldier. In every country where leafes are from 
year to year, and in which there is no independent occupa- 
tion,

tion, in trade or manufaftures, much of the charafter of the 
people niuft depend, cither on the virtue or the caprice of 
their fuperiors ; for though local jurifdiftions be aboliftied, 
there is ftill a fpecies of defpotifm remaining, by which the 
difpleafure of the fuperior is equivalent, in its effects, to the 
punifhmeiits of the law. 

^Population. — From the account, publiflied by the Society for 
propagating Chriflian Knowledge, in the 1774, there were 
1 100 examinable perfons in the parifti. By an accurate enu- 
meration, recently made, there are 1734 fouls, of which 
number 897 are females. In Dr Webfter's report, the num- 
ber is only 835. At an average of four years, the number 
of births amount to 68, and of marriages to 9. There be- 
ing five burial places in the parifli, betides the parifli church- 
yard, the number of burials cannot be afcertained with cer- 
tainty. The increafing population of the parifli is evident, 
to which the cultivation of potatoes, aud the aboUtion of 
fervitudes, greatly contributes : For, prior to the introduv^lioa 
of this ufeful root, a general fcarcity pervaded the Highlands. 
By the abolition of fervitudes, the tenant is put into poiTef- 
Con of his own induftry, which was formerly fettered by fti- 
pulated fervices, in the different feafons, to the fuperior, ex- 
a£led with rigour, and only accepted of in the beft: weather, 
in an unfteady climate. Communicating the fraall-pox by 
inoculation, is of fo very recent a date in this parifli, that it 
could as yet have but little influence. Religious prejudice 
oppofed it, but experience hath now eftabliflied its utility. 
In the year 1789 the mortality was fo great, that only i 
in 13, of thofe who caught the infedtion the natural way, re- 
covered. Soon afterwards, a man in no refpeft noted for ac- 
quired knowledge, in this and 3 of the neighbouring pariflies, 
inoculated about 700 perfons, of which number only 8 died. 

This 



5/" Jpple'crofsi, ' 

This hath fo thoroughly removed all prepoffeffians, thnt upoa 
the appearance of this peflilence of late in the parifh, ino- 
culation was generally adopted. How far thefe caufes may 
be counteradted by a f];int for emigration, which hath reviv- 
ed in the neighbouring ifland of Sky, and hath formerly 
been found very generally to have been of an infe£tious na- 
ture, time will prove. The local attachment of the High- 
landers, hath, for fome time back, been gradually abating. 
The influx of money, and their communication with other 
countries, hath.introduced a defire'for better living; and the 
rapacity of the fuperiors, in applying all the zd\'- niages of 
the times to their own private intereft, hath efFcdhiaily re- 
laxed thofe attachments. The increafing population of the 
country at large, is favourable to the interefted views of the 
proprietors. For every farm, a multitude of candidates is 
ready to appear, and the culture of the ground,- being the 
fole occupation of the inhabitants, the difappointed have no 
other option, but either to emigrate or beg. The inhabitants 
df this parifh are not remarkable for longevity : There are, 
however, ho local diftempers. The palfy and dropfy, difeafes 
little known to our forefathers, are now become common. 

Church. — Thcf parifli is divided into three diftri£ls, each 
feparated from the other by a ridge of hills, inaccefliblc in 
ftormy weather. For the dillridt of Lochs and Tirdon, 
containing 6i6 fouls, the mlnifler officiates once a quarter ; 
and in the diftrifl of Kiihorn, confifting of 5.18 fouls, once a 
month. The Ikeleton of the parifh church ftands in the 
diftrift of Applecrofs ; it was condemned in 1788, but is ftill 
the only edifice for public worfl:iip in the parifli. The living 
amounts to 56 1. 13 s. 35 d. Sterling, and afmall glebe. The 
patronage iS in the Crown. The weekly colledtions, and in- 
cidental penalties for delinquencies, which are left to the dif-

pofal of the kirk.feflion, are the only funds provided for th6 
poor. AH the inhabitants communicate with the Eftabhflaed 
Church, but one, who is of the Epifcopal perfuafion. 

School. — By the local Ctuatlon of the parifli, one diftrift 
only can be accommodated by the parochial fchoo], which is 
fixed at Applecrofs. The fchoolmafter's falary is 200 mexks 
Scotch ; he hath no perquifites, but the quarter payments, of 
IS. 6 d. for Englifli fcholars, and 2 s. 6d. for Latin and a- 
rithmetic ; and the cock-fight dues, which are equal to one 
quarter's payment for each fcholar. It is difgraceful, that a 
clafs of men, fo ufefully employed in the fervice of the pub- 
lic, fliould have fo little of its countenance. 

Antiquities. — There are feveral natural caves in the parifh, 
fome of them rendered more commodious by art ; they feem 
to have been the habitations of the firft plundering adventu- 
rers who came into the country. The Gaelic for cave is uadk^ 
and the only vocable in that copious language for giant, is 
uadhefy that is, the inhabitant of a cave. Fear magnifies 
objects ; thefe favages, in all our old fables and poems, are 
nientioned as men of mighty ftature, and reprefented as ca- 
nibals, who devoured all forts of flefli raw. in the diftri6l of 
Applecrofs are the remains of a fubterraneous houfe, of 
which there is ftill a part entire. It was of conliderable length, 
four feet wide, and four feet deep, regularly faced with ftone, 
and covered with flags, which were overlaid with turf, fo as 
to be on a level with the furrounding ground. The paflage 
was at one of the ends, which, if covered with a turf or 
bundle of heather, would elude all fearch. From the con- 
ftruflion of thele houfes, it is more likely, that they were the 
receptacles of plunder, and the fences of real property, than 
the habitations of men. Near this houfe are the ruins of a 

Danifli 



of Apple crofs, 279 

Danifh Dun. All of the fame defcription along the coafl-, 
ferved as fo many centinels to the Weftern Ifles, (then under 
the dominion of Denmark), who, by the fignal of a torch, 
could give an early intimation to their nearer infular friends, 
of any approaching danger, which being in like manner com- 
municated from one Dun to another, the alarm would in a 
moment become general. There are trunks of trees found at 
a conliderable depth under ground, in hills and meadows, 
where there is no veftige of any kind of wood remaining i 
many of them have vifibly fuffered by fire, which the tradi- 
tional hiftory of the country reports to have been occafioned, 
by the Danes burning the forefts. Clofe by the parifh 
church, are the remains of an old religious houfe, where the 
flandard and foles of crucifixes are ftill to be feen. It was 
richly endowed with landed property, which tradition relates 
to have been conveyed, by the laft Popifli miffionary, in the 
place known by the de/ignation of the Red Prieji of j^pple. 
crofsy to his daughter. Notvvithftanding the pretended ce- 
libacy and chaflity of the Romilh clergy, there are feveral 
firnames in the Gaelic language, which clearly prove, that 
ftrifl; abftinence was not their favourite virtue, luch as Mac. 
an-tagirdy the ptiefs Jon; Mac-vriar, the prior's fan; AlaC' 
jicker^ the vicar's fori ; Mac- pherfoti^ the parjon's fouy ^c. 
Thefe names exactly correfpond with the Englilh firnames of 
PrieJIly, Prior, Par/on, ks'c. and prove the character and 
pradlices of thefe primitive apoflles, in both the kingdoms, 
to have been the fame. 

SupcrJIitlons — There are none of the common calamities, 
or diftrefsful accidents incident to man or beaft,. but hath 
had its particular charm or incantation ; they are generally 
made up of a group of unconneded words, and an irregular 
addrefs to the Deity, or to fome one of the faints. The de-

fire of health, and the power of fuperftition, reconciled ma- 
ny to the ule of them ; nor arc they, as yet, among the 
lower clafs, wholly fallen into difufe. With them the belief 
of the fecond fight is general, and the power of an evil eye is 
commonly credited ; and though the faith in witchcraft be 
much enfeebled, the virtue of abftrafting the fubftance from 
one milk, and adding it to another, is rarely quertioned. The 
ghofts of the dying, called ta/ksy are faid to be heard, their cry 
b'eing a repetition of the moans of the tick. Some affume 
the fagacity of diftinguifliing the voice of their departed 
friends. The corps follow the tra6t led by the tajhs to the 
place of interment ; and the early or late completion of the 
predidtion, is made to depend on the period of the night at 
which the tq/k is heard. Credulity and ignorance are conge- 
nial ; every country hath had its vulgar errors; opinions, 
early imbibed, and cherilhed for generations, are difficult to 
be eradicated. This parifl), like fome of the Weftern Ifles, 
hath its charadleriftical expreffions. The Leabharfein of 
Skv, i. e. by the Bool hfclf \ meaning the Bible ; the Danifti 
Mhoirc of Lewes, e. by the Great Sabbath ; and the Ider of 
i\pplecror=, i- e. by St. Jderius, are fo characSleriftical of the 
natives of thefe feveral places, that, when talking the Gaelic 
language, they can, with few exceptions, be ealily diftinguifli- 
ed ill any part of the globe. They are the remnants of Po- 
pifli oaths, which, having loll their original meaning, are 
now ufed merely as expletives in converfation. 

Language. — Gaelic is the only language ordinarily preach- 
ed in the paiilh. The names of places are principally deri- 
■ved from it, the reft from the Danifli : Thus Ktporn is com- 
pounded of two Gaelic words, Ksp, a tribute^ and bcar^

Germans ufed the afties of burnt wood, extinguiftied with 
fait or mineral water. It is probable, that from this pradlice 
Kilvoury or Kilvourly hath got its name \ from which it 
would appear, that this kind of fait hath once been in gene- 
ral ufe. The afhes of fea ware are ftill ufed in St. Kilda, 
and other places, for curing cheefe, and the cheefe fo cured 
is called ca/Jj-mourly, i. e. the cheefe of murluadh. From the 
Danifh are derived all thofe names which have burgh in the 
compound, as Burghdale. It is obfervable, that in all places 
of this defignation, there hath antiently been a Danifh Dun j 
and alfo, that all thpfe places, whofe name^ terminate in ic 
which, in the Danifli language, .is faid to fignify a bay^ as 
To/gici Cuic, Dibic^ and Shittic, hath each of them an inlet 
of the fea. 

Mines and Woods, — In the diftri^l of Kifliorn there is a 
copper mine, which Williams, in his mineral kingdom, con- 
fiders as equally rich with any in great Britain. On the foutli

local fituation. Could this be remedied, by the eftabliiliment 
of ftore-houfes, a redudtion of the duty, and a fmall bounty 
to open boats, the condition of the Higlilanders would be 
greatly meliorated, a new fource of national wealth explor- 
ed, and the current of emigration more effe£tually reftrain- 
cd, than by any other means which have hitherto been de- 
vifed. The fupermimeraries would be amply and indepen- 
dently provided for, as the new erected villages would afford

tations without vilible difadvantages.

{County of Peebles,') 
By the Rev. Mr WiLLiAu Marshall. </head>



<p>Namcy Situatiotiy Extent^ tsfc, 

FROM the old feffion records, the name of the pari fh ap- 
pears to have been commonly written Manor^ and 
fometimes Mantjor, but never Manner^ as has been fuppofed 
by fome. It probably received the name of Manor, as being, 
during the time of Epifcopacy, the occafional refidence of 
the re£lor of Peebles, from which circumltance, he was cal- 
led the Parfon of the Manor. Manor is fituated within the 
county of Tweeddale, and the prefbytery of Peebles, and 
belongs to the fynod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The ex- 
tent of the parifh, from the fouth-weft to the north-eaft, is 
about 9 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth. The num- 
ber of acres is faid to be 18,1 10. 

Soil, Clitmie, and Difeafes. — This part of the country, like 
the other pariflies in Tweeddale, is mountainous ; but to- 
wards the bottom, where it is more open, there is excellent 
arable ground, which produces grain inferior to none in the 
county. The hills in the upper part of the parifh, on both 
fides of the Water of Manor, are very high, and fo clofely 
adjoining to each other, as to occafion very fuJden inunda-

tions, when the rainy feafon fets in, on the approach of win- 
ter. The winds tnoft prevalent here, ate the fouth and 
fouth- weft, which are chiefly owing to the narrow ftrath ; 
there being a continued chain of hills, on both fides the wa- 
ter, for 6 miles. The air, though in fome of the higher 
grounds intenfe, is both pure and wholefome, and fewer epi- 
demical difeafes prevail here, than in molt parts of Scotland. 
The arable land bears but a very fmall proportion to the paf- 
ture ground, and lies moftly at the bottom of the hills, along 
the river Manor, and partly on the banks of the Tweed. It is 
naturally fertile, and of a fharp foil ; and the harveft is fully 
earlier than in the neighbouring parifhes. There is indeed 
part of the arable ground of a wet, tilly fubftance ; but it 
has lately undergone a material change, by means of drains 
and ditches carried on by the proprietors. 

Produce, — Peafe, oats, bear, and potatoes, are the 
common produce of the arable farms. A few years ago tur- 
nips were introduced into this parifli, for fattening cattle, 
and have fucceeded as well as could be wilhed^ There is, 
however, one great hindrance towards carrying on this fpe- 
cies of improvement^ which is, the want of inclofures ; 
otherwife the raifing of this moft ufeful vegetable, would be 
ftill more general among the farmers. It is not eafy to afcer- 
tain the real value of the arable ground, as it is commonly 
laid out in flieep pafture : At an average it may be worth 
los. the acre. The mode of cuhivation, obferved here, in 
the rotation of crops, is the fame as in other places of 
Tweeddale It may likewife be obferved, that the wages of 
fervants vary alnloft nothing throughout the whole county ; 
the men getting about 6 1. and the women 3 1. fer anf'tifii. 
l^rovifions are the fame as at Peebles.

Vaitk ^Thie number of horfes cannot well be afcertalned, 

as the farmers very feldom keep more than what is neceffary 
for labouring their land. The number may be betwixt JJo 
and 90. A few black cattle are bred for fale, efpecially year 
olds ; but, in general, they content themielves with as many 
milk cows as they can conveniently keep, finding this equally 
profitable. The number of black cattle may be about 190, 
Sheep being the ftaple commodity of this country, the ftore- 
mafters appropriate moft of their time to that employment : 
And as other parts of Scotlandj fimilar to this, have improv- 
td their breed of ftieep, they are not behind the.r neighbours 
in this refpedl. Accordingly, within thele 10 years, the 
fheep farms have greatly increafed in value, at the fame time 
that the tenants appear to be doing well. The breed of 
Iheep is the fame with thofe in other parts of Tweediiale, 
which are too well known to need defcription. Their num- 
ber may amount to 8700. The wool, for ieveral years paft, 
has fold from 7 s. to 9 s. the flone. 

Rent of the Par'i/fj. — The valued rent is 3301 1. 18 s. 2 
Scots; the prefent rent may be about 1685!. Sterling. 
There are five heritors, two of whom occafionally refide, and 
are improving their lands with much fpirit and iucctfs. There 
is one tenant who pays about 100 guineas per annum^ but does 
not refide in the parifh ; there is another who pays 220 1, ; 
two others pay 150 1. and five iool. a year each. The 
other feven pay from 20 1. to 60 1. of yearly rent. 

Population. — The number of inhabitants appears to have 
greatly decreafed fince the beginning of this century. About 
50 years ago, there were 35 tenants, whereas at prefent there 
are only 16, as above enumerated. The population, in 1755, 
amounted to 320 ; at prefent, it is only 229. This diminurion 
is difficult to be accounted for, as It can hardly be afcribed to

the junaion of many fmall farms, like that of feme other pa-- 
nflics ; and it appears the more furprifing, when it is confi- 
dered, that upon the moft exaft average, talcen from the

has been more than double the number of deaths. This will

of Manor* 



Poor. — There are only 3 penfioners upon the pari{h lift, 2 
of whom are partly fupported by the refiding heritors, and 
principal farmers. When thefe two heritors are mentioned, 
it is but doing them juftice to fay, that they are uncomnaon- 
ly attentive to the poor, and extend their charity to thofe, 
who, though once comfortably fituated, are now reduced 
in their circumftances. There is no parochial fund, but what 
arifes from the Sunday collections, which, at an average, do 
not exceed 2 s. weekly ; and the intereft of 40 1. Sterling, 
which, together with occaiional charities, anfw€r every rea- 
fonable demand. 

General Characl^r. — ^Tlie people are, in general, fober, in- 
duftrious, and well difpofed ; attentive to their feveral fitua- 
tions in life, and uncommonly charitable and humane. They 
are all of the Eflablifhed Church, except one family, and a 
few fervants, who are partly Burghers, and partly Anti- 
burghers ; the whole not exceeding 16, 

School. — The parifli fchool has not been well attended for 
many years paft. This was greatly owing, to the want of a 
proper fchool houfe ; but, though the heritors have lately 
built a commodious one, it is fet down in fuch a part of the 
parifh, that there never will be a numeroug, fchool in it. At 
prefent there are not above 1 2 at the day fchool, and about 
8 at the night fchool. The fc^\ooImafter's falary is lop 
inerks, and 1 2 s. as feffion clerk. 

State of the Church. — During the time of Epifcopacy, the 
church was fituated 4 miles diftant from the prefent one 
where it was perhaps more centrical. It bore the name of 
St. Gordian's Kirk. It was removed, about the middle of 
the laft century, to the bottom of the parifli, where it now 

ftands.

ftands. For many years it remained in a ruinous ftate, till, 
upon an application to the heritors, both it and the manfe 
were repaired. The prpfent incumbent was admitted mint- 
fter in 1788, upon the tranflation of Mr Welfh to Drum- 
melzier. His Grace the Duke of Queenfberry is patron. 
The ftipend is paid in money, and amounts to about 70 1. 
,38 s. The glebe mealures 234. Scottifti acres. 

Mifcellaneous Ohfervations . — There are two very high hills 
in the panQi, called Scrape and DoUarburn, from whence 
there is an extenfive view of the Lothians, Berwickfhire, 
and the Englifti Borders. The latter of thefe is fuppofed to 
be 2840 feet above the level of the fea. No antiquities are 
to be found in this parifh, but a Roman canjp, which is 
pretty entire ; in the neighbourhood of which were found, 
fome years ago, a Roman urn, and fome antient coins, upon 
digging up a piece of ground, with a view to till it. At a 
fmall diftance from this camp, there is a tower raifed upon an 
eminence, and commanding the beft view in the parifh. It 
appears to have been built feveral hundred years ago, and 
(to have ferved as a watch tower, to give fignals of alarm, 
when the enemy made inroads upon the country, and com- 
mitted depredations. Ttiis parifh, lile others in the neigh- 
bourhood, labours under great difadvantages, by being about 
1 8 miles diftant' from coals. They are generally bought in 
fummer, and cofl: about i \ d. the ftone. The greater part

By the Rev. iff*' George Douglas,</head>  



<p>Situatiotiy ts^c, 

THE parifli of Tain is fituated in the county and lynod 
of Rofs. It extends, from eaft to weft, 8 miles, and 
from north to fouth 2, along an arm of the fea, which, 
running from the Moray Frith, divides the (hires of Rofs 
and Sutherland. The royal burgh of Tain, the capital of 
the county, lies near the center of the parifli. The name is 
antient, and, originally, perhaps, was written Thane. It is 
certain that the lands adjacent belonged to the thanes of 
Rols, and there is a diftrift of the parifli ftill called Thane- 
fom. The name in Gaelic is Balduich^ which fignifies the 
town of St. Duthas, or Duthac. The ground, in general, is 
flat, but, towards the weft, rather hilly. The hills are partly 
covered with heath, and partly planted with Scottifli pines^ 
The air is dry and falubrious. The foil is various j fome 
deep, and fome light, fome fertile, and fome barren. The 
fea ihore, the whole length of the parifli, is flat and fandy. 

Fijhing and Coaji.— -At the eaftern extremity of the parifli, 
there is a village called Inver, having 4 boats and 24 men 
T7holly employed in fifliing, by which the town and neigh- 
bourhood

jbourhood are chiefly fupplied with various kinds of fifli, fucli 
as cod, flcait, flounders, and particularly haddocks. Tain, 
20 or 30 years ago, was reckoned an exceeding good fifli- 
market ; but, for fome years part, there has been a fcarcity of 
on the coafl:. This occafions a rife in the price, fo that, 
inftead of 20 haddocks, (as was the cafe about 20 years 
^o), for I d. only one can now be got ; and of other kinds 
3n proportion. The prefent haddocks are much larger than 
the old ones. It is a great difadvantage to the fifhing, that, 
with an cailerly or northerly wind, there is a fwelling on the 
{hove at Inver, which prevents the boats going to fea. There 
is i fand bank, called the Gizzin Briggs, about 3 miles be- 
low the town, extending from the Rofs to the Sutherland 
fide. On it there is a violent furge, with a loud noife, when 
the north or eaft winds blow, and fometimes during a calm 
in frofty weather, or the approach of froft. This bank is 
iwhoUy covered at high water, during neap as well as fpring 
tides ; but is expofed when the fea is out. There is a chan- 
nel near the middle, through which vefl^els can, in moderate 
weather, be conduced fafe, by perfons acquainted with the 
ground', but ftrangers dread it, and it hath been fatal to 
■pefl*cls, particularly about 7 years ago, to a Swedifh fliip, 
loaded with wood. This bank, and the fliallownefs of the 
water between it and the fhore, prevent the fifliing boats 
from coming nearer the town than Inver, which is 4 miles 
diftant. And in confequencc of the badnefs of the naviga- 
tion, merchant goods for Tain are often landed at Cromar- 
ty, which occafions a land carriage of 7 miles. At the 
Meikle Ferry, (the weftern extremity of the parifh), where the 
. paflage boat between Rofs and Sutherland lies, there is, at 
Ijigh .water, depth fufiicient for fhips to come clofe to the 
land. When the fea ebbs, it leaves below the town, and to 
die eaft, a large trad]; of fand expofed, in fome places a mile, 

and 



of Talm 

a«d in fomft twov On this fand, during the fpri-ng. and part 
of fummer, there are found quantities of mufcles, which th^ 
people gather and make ufe of. About the middle of the 
Frith, 2 miles above the Gizzen Briggs, there is a fmall 
bank, the property of the burgh, richly covered with thiss 
fpecies of (hell fifh. Not only do the inhabitants here find 
a plentiful fupply, but alfo many boats, perhaps 50 or 60 iri 
a fealbn, are loaded for other places. It is remarkablep- 
though cockles be not ufually found on this bank, that, in 
1783, when there was great fcarcity of bread, it afforded, ia 
April, May, and June, immenfe quantities of themy of are 
excellent quality, which contributed to the fupport of mul- 
titudes, not only in this parifli, but in the neighbourhood. 
The water has, of late years, made fome fmall encroachments' 
on the land below the town; but, in a plain to the eaftwardj, 
there are more alarming encroachments made, and yearly 
making, by fand blowing. Many acres of pafture and arable 
ground have been thus covered within the laft 10 years ; and,- 
whei'e fome old people remember dwelling houfes and grow-' 
ing corn, nothing is now to be feen but fand banks. 

Population, Isfc, — There is no accefs now to know parti^ 
culaifly the antient ftate of the population of the parifix,' 
There are no regifters extant farther back than the begin- 
ning of the prelent century. In 1755, the return to Dr' 
Webfter was 1870 fouls. The number of catechizable per-' 
fons, counting from 6 years old, is 1800, of which a Uft i$' 
annually taken. Children under 6 years are left out, but ifc- 
is fuppofed there may be of fuch 300 j confcquently the to- 
tal population is about 2100 fouls, and the increafe, fincc 
1755, about 230. The average of births, for the laft lo- 
years, is 70. The variation is very fmall, taking any 10 year* 
of the century. The loweft number, during this century, is 

42, 



i59^ ^iatt/ikd AccounI 

42, an. 1783; the higheft is 84, in 1769. It vTas 82 iri 
1721. In no other year of the century does the number a- 
mount to 80. The average of marriages is 15. There was 
no regifter of deaths kept before 1783, when the aft of Par- 
liament, impofing a tax upon burials, was thought to require 
it. The average, fince that period, is 28 ; but, as only thofe 
interred in the parifli are recorded, and many are carried to 
lieighbouring parifties for burial, the number of deaths might 
be reckoned from 34 to 36. All the people, with the ex- 
ception of 2 or 3, are, by profelEon, of the Eftabliftaed 
Church. A few years ago, there were 2 or 3 died here paft 
ipo. There are none now quite 90, and few from 80 to 88. 
There have been no emigrations from the parifh ; but leve- 
ral young people go yearly to Londonj Edinburgh, Glafgow, 
Aberdeen, the Weft Indies, and North America, fome of 
Vrhom have profpered well, and been of fcrvice to their re- 
lations. A good many go to the army, chiefly to regiments 
ivho wear the Highland drefs. Hardly any go to the navy* 
There are 1 2 merchants and fhopkeepers in the town, and 80 
tradefmen and artificersi 

Jgrkttlture. — There is a good dfcal of flaX and potatoes 
taifed, many acres fown with grafTes, and fome wheat and 
rye } but the principal crops are, barley, oats, and peafe. 
The two laft are fown irt March and April ; barley, from the 
laft week of April to the laft week of May. In a year ordi- 
narily favourable, harvert begins about the middle of Auguft, 
and ends about the middle of Oftober. The corns raifed 
inight be fufficicnt for bread to the inhabitants ; but often 
gentlemen export all their viftual rents, and the people of 
the town get fupplies from neighbouring parifties. 

Price 



of Tain. 393 

Price of Provi/tons. — Beef, mutton, veal, pork, butter, and 
cheefe, are imported, and the prices of them double of what 
they were 40, or even 30 years ago. Butcher meat fells from 
2d. to 3 d. fometimes higher, per pound butter, from 10 s. 
to 12 s. per ftone j cheefe, from 4 s. to 6 s. ; hens, cocks, and 
ducks, from 3 d. to 6 d. each. There is lefs variation in the 
prices of vidtual. Barley and oat meal fell now from 14 s, 
to 16 s. and have been generally at the fame rates for the laft 
feven years, and indeed from 177010 1780. Twelve (hillings 
is reckoned no bad contraft price for 7 or mors years ; the 
iigheft given is 13 s. 4d. About 40 years ago, fifli were 
plentiful and cheap j but now they are fcarce, and advanced 
in the price. 

Language. — The inhabitants of the town fpeak the Eng. 
lifii, and alfo the Gaelic or Erfe. Both languages are preach- 
ed in the church. Few of the older people, in the country 
part of the parifh, underftand the Englilli language ; but the 
children are now generally fent to fchool, and taught to read 
Englifli. The names of places are, partly Scottifh, partly Gae- 
lic ; fome expreflive of the local fituation, as being on an 
eminence, or in a hollow, or on a muir ; by the wood, or by 
the water fide j and fome indicating the names of antient 
poffeflbrs. 

Rent — The land rent is about 1 200 bolls, and 800 I. Ster- 
ling. The rent of houfes in the town is about 650 1. Ster- 
ling. 

Stipendy Isfc. — The benefice is 120 bolls of victual, half 
barley, half oat meal, with 4 1. 15 s. Sterling, as fixed in. 
1718 ; befides a glebe, manfe, and garden, worth about 12 I. 
per annum. There are 1 5 heritors in the parifli. The Crown

is patron. The church was built about 400 years ago. The 
mafon work, being all afhler, is ftill entire and firm. It had 
a new roof about 40 years ago. There is a ftatue of St. Du- 
thus in the weft gabel. A little below the town, there are 
the remains of a chapel called by his name, having the 
gabels, the north fide wall, and part of the fouth, ftanding. 
To this place it is reported, that King James IV. in the way 
of penance, travelled on foot from Falkland, with uncom- 
mon expedition, refting only a fliort while at the monaftery 
of Plufcardine, near Elgin. There is a tradition, that foon 
after this royal vifit, the edifice was burnt by a party of the 
M'Kays, who were in purl'uit of fome perfons obnoxious to 
them, that fled for fhelter to this ianftuary. There are no 
other veftiges of religious houfes in the parifii, except about 
3 miles to the eaft of the town, at Lochflix, where there 
are fome remains of a fmall chapel. The manfe was built 
in 1720, and has had fome reparations feyeral times fince. 

Landed Property and Farms. — The number of heritors is 
35, of whom Mr M'Leod of Cadboll is the principal, in 
point of property, and Lord Ankerville the greateft refident 
proprietor, at leaft occafionally *. Property has been rather 
flucluating. There are not above three, whofe family prede- 
ceflx)rs had land here a century ago. Thirty years purchafe 
is reckoned a good price for lands ; but there are iixftances of 

fmall 

• Mr Baillie of Little Tarrel, one of the heritors who refides 
near the town, has a farm particularly well inclofed, and in good 
order. This farm was naturally unfertile, and when in the 
hands of tenants, gave poor returns ; but Mr Baillie having re- 
fided on it for near 30 years, and paid attention to its improve- 
ment, by draining, fowing graffes, and a rotation of other 
meliorating crops, it now produces excellent crops of every 
kind. 



of Tain. 395 

fmall parcels rear the town, fold for 50 years purchafe, 
and upwards. The farms in the parifh are generally fmall. 
There are 60 farmers, befides 150 mailers or cotters. Moft 
of the lands near the town are inclofed, fome with ftones, 
fome with ditch and hawthorn. Thefe lands let at from 
20 s. to 30 s. per acre. Open fields, at a diilance from the 
town, let at from los. to 15 s. 



State of the Poor. — There are about 130 names on the 
poor's lift, of feeble, aged perfons, among whom there is an- 
nually diftributed about 20 1. Sterling, colledted in the churchy 
there being no other funds for their fupport, except a fmall 
croft, mortified by a gentleman about the beginning of this 
century, that pays 3 bolls of yearly rent, and the intereft of 
40 1. Sterling lent by the kirk-fefllon. The poor of this pa- 
rifli do not, as is cuftomary in other places of the countryj 
receive any benefit from bells and mort cloths ufed at fune- 
rals, the magiftrates and town council, for time inamemorial, 
referving to themfelves thefe emoluments. 

Situation of the Par'i/h in 1 783. — In 1783, befides victual 
' fent by government for fupply to the poor, the gentlemen in 
the town and neighbourhood contributed liberally. With 
the money coUe£Ved, there was bought a quantity of excel- 
lent peafe, of which a cargo, through the kind attention of a 
north country gentleman in Glafgow, was brought from the 
Baltic, and fold at the Meikle Ferry in this parifh. Thefe 
peafe, and the government bounty, were given not only 
to the poor, who ordinarily receive alms, but likewifc 
to farmers, cottagers, and tradeiir.en. Through favour- 
able fucceeding feafons, and the indulgence of landlords^ 
the people are recovered from the calamitous effects of 

that

that difaftrous period, and none of its arrears rtow remain 
unpaid *. 

Building.-^ Of late, fevdral old houfes that were ruinous 
have been rebuilt in the town, and fcveral new onej: built. 
The humour for building is prevailing. Mr M'Leod of 
Geanies, 3 years ago, feued fevcral acres of ground, lying to 
the eaft of the town, on which feveral houfes have been 
built, and are now building. This ground was feparated from 
the town by a deep hollow, through which a rivulet runs ; 
over it there is a handfome bridge, of one large arch, .ere£i- 
ed, which coft about 80 1. Sterling, the expence being defray- 
ed by the burgh, and Mr M^Leod. The entrance to the 
own, by this new bridge, from the eaft and fouth, is much 
more commodious now than formerly. Of an extenfive

magiftratcs give 50 merks annually, to a man who teaches 
JEnglifli and writing to the lower fort. He hath likewife the 
perquifites belonging to the offices of precentor and feffion 
clerk. Befides, he gets 61. Sterling for teaching a Sunday 
evening fchool, founded 3 years ago by Lady Rofs-BaiUie

pays the mailer's lalary, but hath furniflied the fcholars, 
whofe number is between 70 and 80, with proper books* 
There is one of the Society's fchools for propagating Chrif- 
tian Knowledge in the eaftern part of the parifli. The 
teacher is allowed 1 2 1. per annum from the Society, and is 
furniflied by the parifli, with a houfe, a garden, and a cow's 
grafs. About 30 fcholars attend him. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervattons . — There are fix dealers in the 
town, licenfed to fell fpiritous liquors and ale, and one of 
them has a wine licence. The people, in general, are fober. 
About 30 cottages have been built in the country part of the 
parifli, within thefe 10 years, and 20 houfes in the town, 
fome of them 2 and 3 ftories high. There is alfo an ele- 
gant mafon lodge, the building of which cofl: 500 1. Sterling. 
The roads and bridges are kept in good repair. The ftatute 
labour is exadted in kind. There are 12 merchants and 
fliopkeepers in the town, and 80 tradefmen and artificers; 
befides 20 in the landward part of the parifli. Mafons and 
Wrights receive from 10 d. to 16 d. /)fr day •, taylors rather 
lefs ; labourers in huflDandry, from 6d. to i s. according to 
the ocrafion. A man, in harvefl;, receives i s. per day, a 
woman 6 d. without victuals. Men fervants, maintained in 
the family, receive, per amwmy from 50 s. to 3 1. for wages ; 
women about half as much, befides flioes. About 40 years

which are all found in the parifli, are chiefly ufed for fuel. 
Coals, moftly imported from England, have alfo been ufed 
of late. The only manufaftures carried on here, are the 
fpinning of flax, and the tanning of leather. It is generally

<p>
Name, Situation, and Extent. 

THIS parifh was formerly written Newtyld, but is now 
fpelt Newtyle It is fituated in the county of Forfar, 
in the prefbytery of Meigle, and fynod of Angus and Mearns. 
Its extent is about i| miles in length, from eaft to wef^-, 
along the Sidlie Hills, on the eaft of the Glack of Newtyle, 
(an opening in the Sidlie Hills, affording a paflage from 
Strathmore to Dundee) ; it is i-| miles from fouth to north, 
over the Sidlie hills, and one mile broad ; the remaining ^ of 
a mile, along the hill, being pretty nigh fquare. 

Soilt Climate, and Difeafes, — The country is hilly on the 
fouth, and flat on the north. The foil is a mixture of black 
earth and clay ; and, in fome places, of fand and gravel. la 
general it is fertile and well cultivated. Horfes and cattle, 
of a good lize and value, are raifed here. There is but one 
flock of flieep. The air is dry and healthy, excepting in 
fome marlhy places toward the north. Slow fevers are fre- 
quent here, and fcrophulous complaints not rare ; which laft 
are very fevcre in the fpring.

There is only one family of Seceders, and no other fedla- 

ries. The proportion between the annual births, and the 
whole population, is nearly as i to 39. The proportion be- 
tween 



of Neivtyk, 



tKvttn the annual marriages and the whole population, is 
nearly as i to ii8. The proportion between the annual 
deaths, and the whole population, is nearly as i to 49. 

Renty Jgriatliure, tsfr.— There are about 1600 acres of 
arable land in the parilh. Thefe are divided into 15 large 
farms, which are let at from Sol. to near 200 1.; and 6 
fmall, which draw from 61. to 1 2 1. a year. The average 
rent of the beft arable land is from 17 s. 6 d. to 20 s. •, and 
of inferior land, 10 s. or 12 Si per acre. Some of the farms 
might draw 3 1. or 4 1. per acre, if they were near a town. 
What is efteemed the beft plan of farming here, is to have a 
farm divided into four parts, and to lay down one fourth in 
clover and rye-grafs, another in oats, another in turnips, po- 
tatoes, and peafe ; and another in barley, and grafs fown with 
it ; and fo in rotation. Very little wheat, and fcarcely any 
hemp, arc raifcd. There are 59 ploughs, many of which la- 
bour but Imall portions J and there are 106 carts. The pa- 
rifli fupplies itfelf with provifions, and exports a confiderable 
quantity of grain, particularly barley. "Wheat is fown in 
September and Odlober, oats in March and April, and barley 
generally in May. Harveft, for the moft part, is in Septem- 
ber and October. There are more than 800 acres of hills, 
moralTes, &amp;c. all divided among the tenants. Some good 
marl is found in the parifli. No land has been fold in it for 
a confiderable number of years paft. 

Language. — Engllfh is fpoken here in the Scotch dialefl. 
Names of places are chiefly derived from the Englifh ; but 
there are alfo inftances of derivation from the Gaelic. Auch- 
tertyre, the name of a farm here, feems to be Gaelic j Unch-

ing from it. Balmaiv^ in Gaelic, fignifies a good town. 

Ecclefiapcal Staie — The living, including the glebe, iS 
from 80 1. to icol. at an average. The ft ipend is chiefly 
paid in vifVual, viz. two thirds meal, and one third barley. 
The Right Hon. James Stewart M'Kenzie, Lord Privy Seal- 
for Scotland, (proprietor of the whole parifh, excepting three 
farms), is patron. The manfe and offices were built in 1771, 
and th6 church in 1767. 

State of the Poor. — There are 5 penfioners, who receive 
alms monthly ; belides 2 or 3 who get occafional charity. 
The annual contributions amount to 13I. or 14 1. which 
would not anfwcr the exigencies of the poor, if there were 
not fome ftock lajd out upon intereft. 

"Brice of Provifcns and Labour. — Beef, mutton, veal, pork, 
&amp;c. are fold at 3d. 3 id. and 4 d. pound. Geefe are 
fold at from i s. 8 d. to 2 s. 6 d. j chickens at 4 d, ; hens,

of male fervants, are from 7 1. to lol. per nmium, and of fe- 
male fervants about 3 1. which is near 4 times the value of 
what they were about 30 years ago; and yet the fervants fave 
no more money now than formerly, owing chiefly to their 
extravagance in drefs. 

Jltiilqwties. — Near the Kirktown of Newtyle are the ruins 
of the Caftle of Hatten, built by Laurence Lord Oliphant, 
in 1575. Near the Caftle of Hatten, (ome traces are dif- 
cernible of what is called the Caftle of Balcraig, {Bailie 
Craig^ i. e. the town of a rock^ fituated at the foot ef a hill.) 
There are feme traces of a camp at Auchtertyre, about a 
quarter of a mile from the Kirktown of Newtyle, where 
Montrofe's army is faid to have taken their ftation for fome 
nights, while the Marquis himfelf lodged at a neighbouring 
caftle, after burning the hoyfe of Newton of Blairgowrie, 
then the property of the father of the late Provoft Drum- 
mond of Edinburgh. There is a tower built by the Lord Privy 
Seal, on the top of Kinfurney's hill, (a pait of the Sidlie 
Hills), which lerves as a land mark. From this tower Sr. 
Abbe's head is feen, and fome parts of jo or 11 adjacent 
counties. This hill appears to have been anciently made 
life of as a proper place for kindling fires, to warn this and 
the neighbouring counties of the ap.proach of enemies. 

Defcr'iptiou of the People — The general fize of the people, 
in this parifli, is about 5 feet 6 inches: A few individuals 
have attained the height of 6 feet. I hey are very induf- 
trious, in general, and more than one half of the houfe- 
holders are weavers, and poireH; a fmall portion of land. 
They are not fond of a military life, and few inlift in any

corps. They are in general fober and ecor.omical ; enjoy, m 
a reafonable degree, the comforts and advantages of (ociety, 
and, on the whole, feem pretty well fatisfied with their condi. 
tion. Their fituation, however, might be meliorated, by 
greater exertions of induftry, and by fuperior knowledge of 
agriculture, and the other arts of civil life. 

JMifcellaneous Ohfervat'ions. — Coals are the fael ufed here. 
They coft from 4 s. 6 d. to 5 s. per boll at Dundee. There 
are fome peats, of a bad quahty, and dearer than coal, ufed 
for kindling fires. Roads were kept in tolerable repair by 
the ftatute labour, till laft fummer, yrhen it was commuted. 
Now there are turnpikes, of whole utility many are not yet 
fatisfied, though it is hoped they will be fo, when the roads 
are completed. The general fcarcity, in 1782-3, was felt 
here. The kirk' feffion bought meal for the poor, and fold 
it at a reduced price. Oat meal fold, in fummer 1783, at i s. 
3 d. ; peafe and bear meal, at 1 1 d. the peck. The poor, ia 
fome of the hilly countries, bought coarfe flour, and mixed 
it with bran, of which they made bread. Hence the mifer- 
able ftate of the country may eafily be conceived.

(County of Sutherland.) 
By the Rev, Mr Sage. </head>



<p>Origin of the Name, 

KILDONAN, the name of this parifli, feems to be of 
Gaelic etymology : It is a compound of Cil (equiva- 
lent to the Latin noun Cella, a cell or chapel), and Donan^ 
the tutelar faint of the parifli, in Popifli times *. Similar to 
this term, are fome other names of places, as Kilearnati, Kil^ 
phedery and Kilmuir ; which may be tranflated St. lerne's, St. 
Peter's, and St. Martha's chapels ; the lafl: has the annexation 
of Coil Chi/mhiiiry i. e. St. Martha's Chapel and Wood. An- 
tiquarians 

* As an evidence of the high veneration, in which St. Do- 
jian was formerly held here, there was a large hollow ftone, fi- 
tuated about 3 miles from the church, and about mid way be- 
tween it arcl Helmfdalc, which was called Suigh Dofzan by 
fome, and Caihair Donan by others, /. e. St. Donan's Seat, or 
Hefting Place. The tradition is, that the faint fat down in it, to 
reft himfelf, when pafling through the Strath of Kildonan. 
The ftone had a cavity, fo very capacious, as to hold any perfon 
in the front of it, who, through fatigue or curiofity, chofe to 
fit down in it. But an ignorant fellow, from the coaft; of Su- 
therland, wifhing to difplay his mufcular ftrength by lifting it, 
let it fall from his hands with fuch force, that it was daftied to 
pieces. There are fome old people ftill alive, who have feen it 
entire, and the incumbent was ftiewn a fragment of it as a pre- 
vious relidt.

tiquarians are of opinion, that the original names of many 
pariflies, towns, and places, have been changed ; and, in 
compliment to Popifli faints, as already mentioned, modern- 
ifed, in different parts of the Highlands. As this parifli, 
therefore, is chiefly fituated on the banks of the river of Helmf- 
dale, and the inhabitants dwell near it on both fides, the 
name Kildonan does not feem to have been its original name, 
but lubftituted for it. The river of Helmfdale, which paffes 
through the Strath, is called Abhin High ; the Strath, more 
frequently, if not altogether, called Strath lligh^ and the Gae- 
lic name of Helmfdale, in the country language, is called 
Bun Itigh, that is, the mouth or lower part of the water, 
where it iffues into the Moray Frith. If, then, the name of 
the parifh has been changed from High to Kildonan, as a few 
have called it Scir High, the parifh of High or Hie muft be 
the original name and defignation ; and indeed this is ren- 
dered ftill more probable, by the Roman geographers, who 
place the river Hie in this neighbourhood, which muft evi- 
dently have been the Helmfdale. 

JExient, Rivers, and Lakes. — The appearance of the parifli 
is mountainous, extending on both fides of the river of Helmf- 
dale, for the fpace of 13 miles; and 7 miles beyond that, 
at the fartheft extremity of the parifli, the inhabitants are 
fituated along both fides of 6 lochs or lakes, which are the 
general fource of the river. The length of the parifli is 
computed to be 20 miles, and only 8 miles broad in one end, 
and fcarcely a quarter of a mile in the other. It refembles 
the form of a tree, ftretching out at the top, or height of 
the parifli, into branches. Thefe branches, which are thus 
formed, are the diftricls of Strathtilney, Frigh, and Strath- 
beg, whofe refpeftive fmall rivulets run into the river of 

Helmfdale.

contain plenty of trout, and fome falmon, 

Moutitains. — There are fix mountains, not very high, but 
covered with heath. Acrofs one of thefe hills, called Slerfil^ 
there is a road, (the Crafg)y which leads from Badfluich, at 
the foot of Bein Uarigh, to Lothbeghoufe, through a deep 
valley, \Gleiiloih), about 5 miles in length, being a courfe 
about half way fhorter in diftance, than round Helmfdale 
to the coaft. Towards the north-weft, in the height of the 
parifti, in the ftraight courfe to that of Farr, there is a place 
called Bealach nan Creach ; and another leading to Strath- 
haladale, in the parifh of Reay, Bealach Chnoicfhim, both 
of which can only be travelled on horfeback, with proper 
guides. It would be of vaft utility, that the tra£t in the 
Crafg was made a patent good road, and a road cut out 
in Bealachfnan, Creach, and Cncckfin, where there is not fo 
much as the veftige of one for a number of miles. The 
hill road called Bealach-nan-Creach^ on the weft fide of Beia 
Mhadugh, fignifies the Pafs or Si r eight of Spoils ^ depredation, 
or booty. During the ellablifhment of the feudal fyftem, 
when the M'Kays were proprietors of Strathnaver, in the 
parifli of Farr, great numbers of cattle were carried away 
from the Highlands of Sutherland, on this fide of the coun- 
ty, through this pafs, from which it derived its name. Such 
depredations were not confidered as a£ts of fpuiizie or theft, 
but the e&amp;edls of bravery and reprizalS. Near the foot of Bein 
Ghrim-mor, and not far from the Bealach, there is an ex- 
tenfive green field, (now ufed for a fliiehng), called Inis 
Cbomhraigy or the Field of Contejl ; where there are many 
fmall hillocks, covered with mofs and heath ; and alfo a 
larger cairn, called Carn-an-Teichigh^ the Cairn of Retreat. 
In this place, it is fuppofcd, the people of Sutherland en-

gaged with the MKays, to get their cattle brought out 
of their hands, before they had time to crofs the Bealachi 
and could get them landed on the Strathnaver fide, where, 
to rifle an engagement, would have been attended with greater 
danger. 

Population. — The return to Dr Webfler, in 1755, 1433 
fouls. In April 1791, the population amounted to 1365, of 
whom 244 were men, 295 women, 756 children, and 7® 
fervants. The number of births, from 4th June 1790, to 
4th May 1791, were 40, and that of deaths 60. There are 
only 2 old men, the one . 80, and the other 96 years of age. 

Cattle and Provifions. — The number of horfes, in April 1791, 
were computed at 81 2 ; cows, 2479 » A^eep, 504 1 j and goats, 
570. For thefe different kinds of cattle, of late years, good 
prices have been got at the markets. Horfes, of the bcft 
kind, draw from 4I. to 6 1. Sterling j cows, from 50 s. to 4 h 
los. ; fheep and wedders, from 4 s. to 6 s. ; goats with kid, 

5 s.; yell goats, from •3 s. to 4 s.; avers, i. e. gelded he., 
goats, from 5 s. 6 d. to 6 s. 6 d. ; lambs, in mid-fummer, af- 
ter being taken from their dams, draw, in the Caithnefs 
markets, and at Dornock, from 2 s. to 3 s. Sterling. The 
produce of cattle has lately rifen confiderably in value. A. 
ftone of butter or tallow, which fold, about 10 years ago, at

ruinous fince, and is repairing this feafon. There are two 
fchools eftablifhed in this pariQi, for the inftruflion of youth, 
a parochial fchool, and a Society fchool } the mafter of the 
former has only 100 merks Scotchj conamon quarter fees, 
from fuch fcholars as can afford them, and 1 L 55. from the 
kirk-feffion, as feffion clerk and precentor. The number of 
the fcholars is very few during the bufy feafons ; but in win- 
ter, he has upwards of 30. The Society fchool, when laft 
vifited, had rather more. The mafter's falary is 9]. Ster- 
ling. He receives few payments from the fcholars, as they 
are in general very poor; 

Antiquities.— In Suinachugh, or Kinbrace, 4 miles above 
the church of Kildonan, a battle was fought about the mid- 
dle of the 1 2th century, between two chieftains, originally 
of Danifh extradtion, named Suenus and Aulver Rofta. 
Tradition informs us, that, from the number of large cairns 
which furround the town, and are called Cairn- Suin, or 0/d 
Cairns, the town itfelf was named Suinachugh, or 0/d Field : 
But the Danifti hiftorian, Torfaeus, who relates the ftory of 
the battle between Suenus and Aulver Rofta, feems to give a 
better account of the etymology of the name, in the 23d 
and 26th chapters of the firft book of his Hiflory of the Ork^ 
neys ; from which it is more than probable, that it was ori- 
ginally called Suenus Field. There are 3 fubterraneous paf- 
fages, or tumuli, in this parifh, which, it is faid, lead from 
one cairn, under the bed of the river of Helmldale, lo an-

other on the oppofite fide. They are covered at the t&amp;p 
with large flags, above a trench of 3 feet broad', and 5 or 6 
feet high. From their conftru£tion and dire£tion, they feena 
to have been places of retreat for the inhabitants, with their 
efFe£ls and cattle, from the purfuit of invading enemies, m 
troublefome times ; or fally ports, for facilitating their efcape 
from a vi^Storious enemy. Monfieur du Moulin mentions, in 
his hiftory, that the Albigenles often made good their efcape 
from their bloody enemies, who befiegcd them, by a fubter- 
raneous pafFage, in Carcaflbn in the fouth of France, which 
was 6 miles in length. There are upwards of 9 Piftifli 
cairns or towers interfperfed through the pariih, the greateft 
number, if not all of which, arc in ruins. Some of them 
are round, and others oblong. They are fituated near rivers 
and forefts, as moft comrriodious for fuftenance, which, in 
thofe days, confifted chiefly of fifh, fowls, and vcnifon. 
Thofe of the round kind are erected on eminences, conti-- 
guous to, or in fight of each other ; for the purpofe, as fome 
iuppofe, of making fignals with Imoke or fire, on the alarn^ 
of an enemy approaching any partrcular diftrift. The ob- 
long low kind are generally believed to have been repofito- 
ries for the dead flain in battle. 

Inundations. — In Breinchoel, a fhieling or grazing in this 
parifli, happened the fall of a dreadful water fpout about 4* 
years ago. The Bowman, with his family, and the produce 
of the dairy, were all carried away in one heap, in the hut 
or booth where they flept that night, and were found dead 
after the flood was over. The courfe, which the tremendous 
ftream marked out, may be computed at 60 or 80 feet deep, 
which appears like an awful cavern, whence large pieces of 
folid mofs, and trunks of trees were driven down to the 
plain at the foot of the hill. About 14 years ago, a fimilar

phenomtnon happened at Tuary, though not fo very fatal, 
but the marks of which ftill remain difcernible. Inundations 
of the river of Helmfdale, with floods in fuminer and har. 
veft, often become fatal and deilrudive in the ftrath of Kil- 
donan J and the tenantry, whofe lands lie flat and low along 
the water, have their corn and hay earrjed down by the flream. 
They are obliged to cany home thefe articks with all conve- 
nient fpeed, and leafon them nigh their dwelling places. 
Their lands are commonly in good heart, by the frequent 
overflowings of the river, and produce good rich crops of bear, 
oats, and potatoes. By means of thefe inundations, the ri_ 
ver has changed its original courfe, and detached feveral 
fields on each lide, from the farms to which they formerly 
belonged. 

Language. — The language fpoken in this parifli is Gaelic, 
and the greateft number of the names of places is of Gaelic 
extradion. For example, l^nocfin, hingai's Hill^ from Knoc^ 
a hillf and Fitif the contiacbop of Fingnl ; Grimachcorigb^ the 
valley of Rein Ghrim i Cqftaligb., a towct-'s bolloiv, the name 
of the remains of a fidlilh tower in the bottom of the town, 
^he places beginning with &amp;7, feem to be a mixed compo- 
fition ot Gaelic and Latin, as Kildomn^ Ki/eartiafi, &amp;c. 

Difadvantages. — There is as yet no proper houfe of accom- 
modation tor itrangers in the parilh. There are, indeed, 8 
whifky hollies, in which much tippling is carried on, and of 
coiilequence, feveral immoral pra^^ices have been thereby in- 
troduced among the people. Bin as there is no regular inn, 
travellers above the common rank cannot be accommodated, 
unlefs they lodge in the minifter's houfe. This renders the 
road from the coaft of Sutherland to the north coafl-, very 
inconvenient to fl:rangers of that defcriptiofiv This parifli

labours under another difad vantage. No gentleman refides 
in it, who can ad in a judicial capacity. There are 2 or 3 
flieriff officers ; but no judge warranted to decide any caufe 
of a civil nature. Hence, fome difputes of the moft trifling 
nature cannot be determined, till application is made to one 
of the juftices of peace pn the coaft fide, or to the flieriff of 
Dornock. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervaticns .—in the lower part of the parifli, 
the people, in favourable years, can raife crops, which not 
only fupply themfelves with provifions, but enable them to 
difpofe of bear, oat meal, and potatoes, for feed to the High- 
landers in the heights of the diftridl, where the lands are bad, 
and more fubjedl to blafting and mildew. But the cattle on 
the higher grounds are far better, larger in lize, and more 
valuable in every refpedl. Accordingly, as much dependence 
is placed on them, as the inhabitants of the flrath have on 
the quantity and quality of their crops. A great deal of hay is 
likewife raifed in their meadows ; but this crop is expofed to 
much hazard, and requires much labour, as it muft be car- 
ried olf the held as foon as cut, to prevent the rilk of inun- 
dations. In the years 1782, and 1783, and fome of the 
fubfequent years, the crops were often blafted and deftroyed 
with frofts ai.d mildews, which fet in early in autumn. Such 
lands as lay neareft Hill bodies of water, as large ponds, were 
moll: fubjt£l to this calamity; and confequentiy, fuch lands 
as were farthefl: removed from them, or were contiguous to 
the moft rapid ftreams of the river, efcaped much better. 
There is a little Highland place, north of the Strath of Kil- 
donan, called Ccfialy, which yielded fome found wholefome 
corn, when there was fcarcely a peck of good meal in all the 
reft of the parilh. In thefe years, the guardians of the 
Countcfs of Sutherland, then a minor, fupplied her tenants 

with 



of Kildonan* 



with foreign visual, which was imported at the Little Ferry, 
and fold very high; meal, bear, and peafe, at 20s. and 22s, 
per boll. Many Highlanders, who, at this enormous price, 
bought great quantities to fupport their families, have yet 
been fcarcely able to get their arrears paid up, notwithftand- 
ing every poffible indulgence.

{County of Shetland.') 
By the Rev. Mr JamEs Sands.</head>



<p>Name^ Siiuaiion, Extent^ Isfc. 

THIS parifh in general, and more particularly that part 
of it on which the town is built, derives its name 
from the Norfe or Norwegian language *. It is fituated in 
the lordfhip and prefbytery of Shetland, and, like the other 
parifhes in that part of the country, unconne£led with any 
particular fynod. It extends, from north to fouth, about 6 
miles along the fea coaft, and is no where above a mile in 
breadth. On the eaft and north-eaft, it is bounded by the 
fea, which feparates it from the ifland and parilh of Brafla, 
and forms that excellent harbour commonly called Braffa 
Sound. 

Soily Climate, and Di/ea/es. — The parifli, and country a- 
round it, are rocky and mountainous. The foil, on the 
piountains, is generally peat or mofs, and is deep to their 
very fummit. The arable land lies in fpots along the lea 
coaft ; the foil is light and fandy, but as fertile and produdtive 

as 

• Probably from the fca-port town of Lerwick or Larwick 
in Norway.

as can well be fuppofed, from the fituation and clhnate. The 
higheft hill in the parifli rifes little more than 300 feet above 
the level of the fea. The air, though moift, is far from be- 
ing unhealthy. The moft deflrudlive diforders kiiown In 
this parifh are fevers, introduced by frequent intercourfe 
with ftrangers* Formerly, the ravages made by the fmall- 
pox here, and indeed through the whold country, were truly 
dreadful ; but, for feme years paft, inoculation has been 
pfadlifed among all rariks, with very remarkable fuccefs. 

Mineral Springs and Lakes. — -There is one chalybeate 
fpring in the vicinity of the town, generally believed to be: 
good ; its water, however, is very little ufed. There are 
4 fmall lakes in the parifh ; 2 of them produce excellent 
trout, but not in fuch quantities as to render them an objedt 
of merchandife. 

FtJIjeries. — The principal fifliery, carried on by the inhabi. 
tants of Shetland, is that of ling and tulk, which are fold 
frefh to the landholders, or their tackfmen, at various prices^ 
They are generally caught in the months of June and July, 
on long lines, fet at the diflance of 10, and fometimes 12 
leagues from all land, by fix-oared boats, from 2 to 3 tons 
burden. The yearly export of this article, to foreign mar- 
kets, particularly thofe of Spain and Italy, is, at an average, 
800 tons from all the iflands. There is a very confiderablfc 
herring fifhery on the coaft, carried on wholly by foreigners; 
200 bufles from Holland, 50 from Denmark, 40 from 
Pruffia, 20 from Dunkirk, and about the fame number 
from the Auftrian Netherlands, are employed every fummer 
in this fifhery. They generally put into Breffay Sound before 
the filhery, which, with the Dutch in particular, does not 
commence until the 24th of June. The Dutch formerly 

carried

carried on this fifhery far more extenfively than now; It 
has been on the decline with them ever fince the year 1703; 
They had then about 500 bufles in Shetland, under the con- 
voy of 4 fhips of war, commanded by an admiral ; but a 
French fleet of 6 fhips of war, fent out for the purpofe, fell 
in with the Dutch fhips of war off Fair ifland ; and an en- 
gagement taking place, the Dutch Admiral's fhip was funk, 
on which the remaining 3 run away, and made their efcapci 
Whereupon the French fleet failed for the entry of Brafla 
Sound, fent their boats into the Bay, and burnt and deftroy- 
ed about 400 of the Dutch fifliing vefTels, fparing only a 
number barely fufiicient to carry home the crews of the 
whole. BrefTay Sound abounds with a variety of flounders ; 
but it is imagined, that therd is no fifhing in the country 
more univerfally beneficial, than that of a fmall fifh called 
felloch. The bays, during the winter feafon, generally abound 
with thefc, and they occafion a very confiderable faving of 
the fmall crops of grain. The quantity of oil made in Shet- 
land from fellocks, from Oftober 1790 to April 1791, muft 
have confiderably exceeded 2000 barrels ; this, however, is 
more than is commonly obtained. 

Kelp. — This parifh does not produce above 6 tons of kelp 
yearly ; and the annual export of this article, from the whole 
country, does not much exceed 200 tons, Doubtlefs more 
might be made j but the quantity muft flill be inconfiderable, 
the fhores being fteep, and the fall of water not exceeding 6 
or 7 feet of perpendicular height, even with fpring tides. 

Tides^ ShipturechSf Isfc. — The ebb tides here run north, 
and the flood tides to the fouthward, unlefs on the north and 
fouth extremities of the country, where they run eaft and 
weft ; their, rapidity is inconfiderable, at leaft when compar- 
ed

%a to that of the firths of Orkney. There is no llght-houfe 
in Shetland ; nor is there any chart of the country extant 
that can be depended on. A light-houfe ereded on Nofsi 
a fmall ifland eaft from Breflay, might be of eflential ferviccj 
as many fhips have been loft on the eaft coaft of Shetland, 
efpecially within thefe laft 1 6 years, that fuch a light-houfc, 
in all probability, might have faved. Some of the moft re- 
markable of thefe are the following: In 1775, a Liverpool 
fliip, 2 men only faved out of 24. In 1776, the Ceres of 
London, Greenland ftiip^ was loft with her whole crew. In 
1779, a Dutfch Greenland fliip loft, one of the crew faved. 
In 1780, a Ruffian man of war of 36 guns, on her way from 
Archangel to the Baltic, loft, and of her whole crew only 5 
faved. In 1786, the Concordia, a Danifli xJ.aft India fhip, 
with a valuable cargo, outward bound, loft, and only 15 of 
her crew faved. In 1789, a Dutdi Greenland fliip loft^ of 
her crew only 5 faved. 

Harbours. — The only harbour in this pai-ifh is that of Ler- 
wick, or Breflay Sound, a capacious bay, in which veflels, well 
found, may ride at all feafohs in perfedl fafety ; and what 
renders this harbour particularly commodious, is, its having 
two entries, one from the fouth, and another from the northi 
On the outfide of the horth entry, lies a funk rock^ called 
the Unicorn. When the Earl of Bothwell fled to Shetland^ 
the Unicorn man of war was defpatched in purfuit of him. 
On the appearance of the Unicorn, his fliip, then lying ill 
Brefl^ay Sound, vrzs got immediately under way, and failed out 
at the north entry, followed hard by the other \ and, having 
a pilot on board, got to fea, by which means he made his 
efcape, and was landed at Norway ; while the chafing Ihip 
was wrecked on that rock, which has ever fince been called 
the Unicoroi

in making woollen bed- covers, commonly called rugs. I he 
number of handicraftfmen and apprentices in Lerwick is ve- 
ry confiderable. The men of the lower rank are alnioft all 
feamen and fifhcrmen, the reft merchants and fhopkeepers. 
Lerwick being the feat of juftice, and the place of the flieriff. 
fubftitute's refidence, is not without a few praftitioners in the 
law : Two licenced procurators refide in it. There are two 
lurgeons in the parifh, regularly bred to the buCnefs. The 
inhabitants are all of the Eftablifhed Church. They arc ge- 
nerally fober, inoffenlive, and obliging; and fuch is the hu- 
manity and attention of thofe in eafy circumfrances, that, 
even in times of the greateft fcarcity, none have been known 
to die for want. 

Poor. — There are above 30 who receive a monthly allow- 
ance from the poor's funds, fuch as can be afforded This 
provifion arifes from the Sabbath day's collefbions, and frora 
the mtereft of a little money, lodged for them in different 
hands. They have alfo 50 s. yearly, ariling from the fliare 
ef the church, which was humanely and generoufly pur- 
chafed for them, by Mr Andrew Bolt, merchant in Lerwick. 

Church. — The minifter's ftipend confifts of 500 merks, 
payable according to charter, granted by King William, out 
of the Bifhop's rents of Orkney; 300 merks from the ftent 
of the town ; 200 merks from the tythes of the country part 
of the parifh, and 100 merks allowed for communion elc- 
ments. And, about 3 years age, rhe town, in confideration 
of the incumbent's numerous family, and expenfive fituation, 
added 15 1. Sterling to his yearly income. He has no manfe

by the town. The church was built in 1782, ott a very 
handfome and commodious plan. 

Education — There has not, as yet, been any eftablifhed 
fchool in the parifli ; but there are always one or two teach- 
ers of Englifh, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, and navi- 
gation, in it, who depend entirely on the quarterly payments. 
Thofe, therefore, who wifh to give their fons a grammatical 
education, are under the neceility of bringing teachers from 
the continent of hcotland, upon falaries paid according tc 
their refpective lubfcripupns. 

Renti and Cattle. — No valuation of lands has as yet taken 
place in hhetland. The yearly rent of the country part of 
the panfli njay be about 50 1. Sterling; and that of the 
town 400 1. The houfes in both are all inhabited. The 
parifh contains about 250 merks of arable land, befides 
very extenfive grafs, meadow, and pafture grounds. A 
merk of land is a term perfedtly indefinite : In this parifh it 
is not nearly a Scottllli acre. There are about 200 cows, 
1500 fheep, and many fmall horfes in the parifh. 

Antiquities. — In the country part of the parifh, the ruins 
of two Popifh chapels, and two Pidtifh caflles are to be feen. 
At a rifing ground, near the north end of the town, there 
is a fort, faid to have been built in the days of Oliver Crom- 
well. In the year 1781, it was repaired, under the direction 
of Captain Frafer, Chief Engineer for Scotland, and called 
Fort Charlotte. It was garrifoned, until the peace of 178J. 
It is now committed to the care of a corporal and 4 privates 
of the train of artillery.

<p>Name, Situation, and Extent. 

EAST KILBRIDE, fo called to diftinguifli it from Weft 
Kilbride in the Ihire of Ayr, is fituated in the county 
of Lanark, prefbytery of Hamilton, and fynod of Glalgow 
and Ayr. It i^ about lo miles in length, from north to 
fouth, and from 2 to 5 in breadth. It confifts of the united 
parilhes of Torrance and Kilbride, and is fubdivided into 
446 horfe gangs, according to which the ftatute work for the 
roads is coUedled j each horfe-gang being rated at 3 s. 9 d. 
Sterling. 

Heritors and Rent. — The valuation, as it ftands in the cefs 
book of the county, is 7679 1. 13s. 3d. Scottifli. The real 
rent, at 5 s. per acre, on an average, amounts to 4800 1. Ster- 
ling. The parifh belongs to about 135 proprietors, nearly 
30 of whom are non-refidents. 

Population. — It is inhabited by 587 families, which contain 
E359 perfons, of whom 1065 males, and 1294 females. 
Of thefe there are 488 under 6 years of age. The population, 
owing to the late increafe of manufactures, is on the advance.

There is no regifter of burials kept in the parlfh ; there- 
fore the proportion between thefe and the births cannot be 
afcertained. 

Agriculture and Roads. — About four fifths of the parifh is 
arable ; the reft conlifts of moors and peat molTes. The 
moors afford excellent pafture for fheep, and pre ftocke4 
with about iioicore. Each of the moor-land farms con- 
tains feveral hundred acres of land ; but, in the lower part 
of the parifti, they confift of about 60 or 70 acres. Both 
foil and climate arc unfavourable for improvements in agri- 
culture : The former i? chiefly of a ftiff wet clay, and in- 
cumbent moftly on ich iius ; and the latter variable and cold, 

the 



of Eaji Kilbride, ^2*^ 

the greateft part of the parifh being 700 feet above the le- 
vel of the fea, and fome of it fo high as 1 600. Oats, of all 
kinds of grain, give the beft crops ; but even thefe are ren- 
dered precarious, by the late feed-time and harveft. There 
is, however, much more grain produced in the parifli, than 
is fufficient to fupply the inhabitants. By far too much of 
the arable land is plowed, and very little of it is properly 
drained. Although the moft part of the parifh is inclofed, 
yet the fences, owing to various caufes, are extremely infuffi- 
cient. The roads in general, are in bad repair. Two turn- 
pikes were, laft year, drawn through the parifh, the one 
leading from Glafgow to London, by way of Muirkirk, Dum- 
fries, &amp;c. ; and the other, from Ayrfliirc to Edinburgh, by 
Bothwell Bridge, or Hamilton. 

Trees. — There is little planting in the parifh, except at 
Calderwood, Torrance, and Kittochfide, where trees of va- 
rious kinds thrive remarkably well. There are, however, 
few farm houfcs but what arc .fheltered by aged trees, mofl 
of which are confiderably large. It is thought, that if the 
proprietors confulted their own interefl:, they would lay the 
tenth or twelfth part of the parifh under planting properly 
difpofed. The expofed lituation of the greatefl part of the 
land, would require to be well fheltered. 

Commerce. — The farmers have of late paid great attention 
to the making of fweet milk cheefe ; and in this they have 
fucceeded remarkably well. From every farm of a plough 
of land, there is brought, at an average, to the market, 100 
ftone of cheefe annually, equal in quality to any made in 
Scotland ; it goes under the nanje of Dunlop cheefe, and 
fells, in retail, at 7 s. 8 d. or 8 s. per ftone. The whey, pro- 
duced in making the cheefe, is ufed for feeding young fwine,

for which purpofe it anfwers extremely well : They arc, a 
few weeks before flaughter, fed with potatoes, beans, or oat- 
meal, with a little water. Reared in this manner, their flefti 
is thought to be very clean and delicious j for which reafon, 
they bring a good price in the Glafgow market. 

^Mechanics and ManufaBures. — From the following lift of 
artificers, it will appear, that the parifh is well fupplied with 
mechanics of different kinds :

Moft of the fhoemakers, weavers, and hofiers, are etja- 
ployed by manufacturers in Glafgow. A cotton manufa^lory 
was, in 1783, eftablifhed at the Kirktown or village of Kil- 
bride, and employs about 60 hands. The yarn, which is 
all fpun on plain or rolling jeanies, is moftly fold in Glaf- 
gow. The coarfer kinds, however, are manufadhjred in 
Kilbride, into rauflins, but chiefly into counterpane bed^co- 
vers, which are made here in great perfedlion. . 

Minerals. — Lime and iron ftone are found in great plenty. 
The quarrying and burning of lime ftone has, for time im- 
memorial, given employment to many induftrious labourers 
in this part of the country I'here are, at prefent, 52 men 
employed in that branch : Ti'y fometimes work by the 
piece i but, in general, are paid in proportion to the quanti-

of ftone thev turn out. Each man gains about ps. per 
Jeek at a medium. The quantity of lime produced, in 
noo! was 984s chalders, which, at 6 s. 8 d. per chalder, a- 
founts to 3281 1. 17 s. 4 d. Sterling. About 40 men are em- 
ployed in the iron ftone mines, of which there are many m the 
pariih. The ftone is confumed in the Clyde iron work. The 
mining of coal is not fo extenfive as that of iron ftone. 
There are two coal-works in the parifti ; the one belongs to 
Alexander Stewart of Torrance, Elq-, the other is in the lands 
of Lickprivick, the property of John Boyes, Efq. About 
ao men are ufually employed at both. The coals produced 
from thefe works are not lufficient to fupply the inhabitants 
with fuel j the deficiency is made up with excellent peats, 
with which the parifti abounds, and with coals of the beft:. 
quality from Cambuflang, at the diftance of a few miles. 

Wages, ProviftonSy and Education. — Mafons and wrights re- 
ceive from 20 d. to 2 s. for their day's work ; a common la- 
bourer I s. or 14 d. i a man fervatit, in the farming bufinefsj 
gets from 4I. to 5 1. per half year ; and a woman fervantj 
2 1. Marketable commodities find a ready fale in Glafgowj 
which is diftant from the village of Kilbride 7 miles and a 
half. It is owing to this, that provifions of all kinds are 
nearly as dear as in Glafgow. The education of youth, how* 
ever, is to be had on very eafy terms. Englifli is taught, at 
the public fchool, for i4d. per quarter 5 writing and arith- 
metic, at 2 s. i and Latin at 2 s. 6 d. 

General CharaBer. — The people, in general, are induftridus 
and frugal. They poflefs, from their forefathers, a coura-» 
geous and independent fpirit, which, as it enables them, on 
the one hand, to bear misfortunes with magnanimity, fo it 
forbids them, on the other, to receive, with impunity, the

affronts that may be offered (hem. Being eafy In their cir. 
cumftances, they know not what it is to cringe or to flatter. 
They have fuffered but few encroachments on tlieir liberty, 
either civil or religious: Of courfe their fpirits are not bro- 
ken by meafures hoftile to the natural rights of men, or of 
Chriftians. 

Eminent Men. — The parifli of Kilbride has the honour of 
giving birth to a confiderable number of individuals, who 
have added to the Credit of their families by the Iplendor of 
their names, and the importance of the high firations which 
they have filled in life. I'he camp and the court are indebted 
to the families of Calderwood and Torrance, for men of dif- 
tinguiflied abilities, who honourably fupported leading cha- 
rafters in their feveral departments. An extenfive benevo- 
lence to mankind ; valour and courage, untainted by cowar- 
dice, and a deep penetration into the affairs of ftate, refledl 
a diftinguiftied luftre on their names. Nor will the name of 
Hunter ever be forgotten by the literati of Europe. The 
late Dr William Hunter, and his brother John Hunter, Efq; 
who are juftly ranked among the firft in the lift of the 
learned of the prelent age, were born at Lang Calderwood, a 
little to the north-eaft of the church. So much has been 
fa:d cf the former, that it would be needlefs here to make a 
repetition ; it needs only be obferved, that for great abilities, 
and uncommon fuccefs, he was eminently diflinguilhed, while 
alive, as a phyflcian, and that his name will be immortalized, 
as a careful enquirer into the works of nature and art. His 
coUedlion of antiquities and natural curiofities, is not equalled, 
perhaps, by any private mufeum in Europe. His brother, 
Wr John Hunter, who has arrived at the head of his pro- 
feffion as a Ikilfui lurgeon and anatomift, is, by his medical 

invefligations, 



of Eafl Kilbride, 427 

Jnveftigations, Sec. &amp;c. daily adding honour to his name, arid 
the place of his nativity. 

Difenfes There is no epidemical diliemper peculiar to 

Kilbride. The difeafe, that carries olF the greateft number 
of perfons, about the middle period of life, is the confurap- 
tion. Old people affirm, that, in their forefathers days, this 
diforder was extremely rare, and feldom mortal. The pro- 
grefs of the difeafe, in this country, is generally afcribed to 
the change of clothing, from the thick and warm Scottifh 
plaiding, to the fine, but thin and cold Englifli cloth, \vhich. 
now fo much prevails. The fmall-pox fometimes rages with 
great fury. There were, in the year 1789, no fewer than 
32 children in the parifli feized with that loathforae diforder, 
and only 13, with difficulty, recovered. Inoculation, the 
beft remedy for that mortal contagion, meets here with a bad. 
reception. Rooted prejudices, founded upon arguments, 
fome of which are trifling, and others abfurd, influence the 
minds of the people fo much againft it, that they lit flill, in 
fuUen contentment, and fee their children cut off in multi- 
tudes. It is to be hoped, however, that natural alFeftion,' 
and a fenfe of duty, will at length get the better of unrea- 
fonable prejudices \ and that the period is approaching, when 
inoculation will be univerfally praflifed, by which the difeafe 
will be greatly meliorated, or, perhaps, altogether eradicated. 

Church. — ^There are two places of worfliip in the parifli ; 
the church, which was rebuilt in the year 1774, and a Re- 
lief meeting houfe at prefent building. I\Ir French enjoys 
the living, which amounts, exclutive of manfe and g'c„e, to 
J 2 chalders of meal, paid in money, according to the fiarj 
of the commiflariot of Hamilton and Campfie. The teinds- 
are paid to the Univerfity of Glafgow, who raife nearly 32 

chalders. 



428 



Siaii/lical Account 



chalders. The King is patron. As the Relief congregation 
is not yet properly formed, the number of diffenters belong- 
ing to it is not known. The Reformed Prefbytery has, in 
the pariih, 45 adherents ; the Amiburghers, 42 ; and the 
Burghers, about 12 or 14. 

Poor. — To the minifter and elders is entrufted the folc 
management of the poor's funds in Kilbride. The method 
by which ihefe funds are applied, is entirely agreeable to the 
true fpirit of the Church of Scotland. Poor's rates, which, 
in fome places, are the fertile fource of corruption, and even 
of poverty itfelf, were never eftablifhed here. There is no 
encouragement given to idlenefs, whilft none are allowed to 
ftarve. Though the number ot poor is conftderable, yet it 
is no greater than might be expected, in fo populous a parifh. 
There are ufually about 1 7 who receive ftated fupplies, the 
greatert number of whom are aged women. The monthly 
allowance ot each, is from i s. to 6 s. Sterhng. A few are 
permitted to beg within the bounds of the parifh. Befides 
the ftated poor, there are a few indigent perfons, mofi of 
■whom are heads of families, who get occafional fupplies, as 
the feffion fees neceflary. This, though fmall, added to 
what they can earn by any kind of labour, enables them to. 
live more comfortably in their own houfes, than they could 
poffibly do in the beft endowed hofpitals. The funds for 
anfwering the above charitable purpofes are very fmall. 
They amounted, from the 6th of May 1786, to the fame 
day 1787, to 46 1. 17 s. 4 d, ; of this, 38 1. 2s. 1 1| d. were 
coUefled at the church door ; the reft was made up of 2 1. 8 s. 
10 d. of proclamation money, with the intereft, firft, of 1000 
merks, mortified by the Calderwood family, to the poor 
of the parifti, and, fecondly, of a fmall fum, that has, for 
fome years, been given out on loan, The annual amount 

of

of the poor's money is feldom fo much as it was at the above 
mentioned period. The deficiency, owing to the prefent di- 
vided ftate of the parifli, muft daily increafe. In all fecef- 
fions from the Eftablifhment, the poor, from certain motives, 
remain but too firmly attached to the church ; whilft the 
contributions of the people arc direded into another chan- 
nel. 

Mifcellaneous Ohfervations. — The parifh contains feveral fub- 
jefts of antiquity, if old caftles, fepulchral tumuli, &amp;c. may 
be received amongft the number. Here, alfo, a wide field 
is opened to the lovers of natural hiftory. A great variety 
of curious foffils prefent themfelves to view. Petrifaftions 
abound in almoft every part of the parifh. They are divid- 
ed into two kinds, viz. recent and antient. The recent com- 
prehend mofi^es, &amp;c. petrified by water, containing calcareous 
particles. The antient, or extraneous, divide themfelves in- 
to two kinds, as they once belonged to the vegetable or ani- 
mal kingdom. Of the former, there are various kinds of pine, 
&amp;c. now known by the name of the coal-ftalk ; of the latter 
are varieties ot fhells, entrochi, fifties teeth, and corralloides^ 
which are fuppofed to have originally inhabited the antedi- 
luvian ocean *. 

• Defcriptlons and drawings of more than a hundred va- 
rieties of thefe petrifications, along with the fubterraneous geo- 
graphy of the parifh, and an account of its antiquities, &amp;c. may

(County of Dumbarton.') 
Sy the Rev. Mr John Gillespie, Minijler of that Parijh.</head> 

<p>Name^ Situation^ a/id Extent. 

ARROQUH AR is a Celtic word, which fignifies a higti 
or hilly country. It is generally jTonounced, in the 
Gaelic language, Arrar, which is a contraflion of Ardthlry 
ard fignifying high, and th'ir a country. The name is very 
defcriptive of the place, which is high and mountainous, 
having very little flat or arable ground in it. The extent of 
the parifli is near 14 miles long, exclufive of 4 farms, which 
lie on the eaft fide of Lochlomond, near the north end of it. 
The mean breadth may be computed at 3 miles. It is fitu- 
ated in the county and prefbytery of Dumbarton, and in the 
fynod of Glafgow and Ayr. 

Soily Climate^ and Difeafes. — The furface of fome of the 
farms is fmooth, and clothed with a beautiful verdure, inter- 
mixed with heath and bent ; of others rocky, but the inter- 
mediate fpaces afford excellent pafture for flieep. When the 
pafturing of black cattle prevailed here, the iurface was moft- 
ly covered with heath, and had a difnial appearance ; but 
fince the introdudtion of fheep, the country has afllimed a 
different afpedt. The climate is very temperate in this place, 

it 



tf Arroquhar* 



it being fcreencd by the mountains from the northerly 
and eafterly winds, the cold in winter is not fo intenfe 
as in the low country } but there are frequent and heavy 
falls of rain from the Ibuth and fouth-weft, accompanied 
with high winds. There are no local diftempers preva- 
lent here, except fevers, to which the poorer people are 
fubje£t in the latter end of winter and beginning of fpring. 
With rcfpedt to the fmall pox, the people begin now to fee 
the advantages of inoculation, and to be more reconciled 
to it, though it is not yet much pradtifed among the lower 
clafs. 

Sheep, Horfesy i^c. — The number of fheep in the parifh 
amounts to about 10,600; horles, 60 ; black cattle, 460. 
The Iheep, in general, are black faced, and of the Linton 
kind. 1 he white wool has fold here, thele two years paft, 
at about 7 9. per ftone of 24 lib. Englifli weight, and the laid 
at 5 s. On an average, 8 or 9 fleeces of the white, and 5 
or 6 of the laid wool go to the ftone. If a premium were 
given annually for the beft tups, there would be a competi- 
tion, and confequently a confiderable improvement made 
both on the fiieep and wool. It is expefted, that the Hon. 
Board of Truftees in Edinburgh, will give the fame encou- 
ragement to this diftridl: of the county of Dumbarton, for 
the improvement of the breed of flieep, that they give to 
fome other counties in the Highlands of Scotland. 

Trees. — There is a confiderable deal of oak growing in 
this parifh, on the banks of Lochlomond. But as the woods 
are generally cut -ibout 20 or 24 years of age, there is no 
great timber in them, except foq:ie ftandards left at laft cut- 
ting.

From the above it appears, that there are, upon an ave- 
rage, 13 baptifms, and 5 marriages annually. From the 
year 1769, to 1775, the average of baptifms is nearly 12 ; 
but the marriages do not amount to i yearly. Hence it ap- 
pears, that the population of this parifh, fince 1 769, has in- 
creafed, which is owing, probably, to the high price of la- 
bour, and the encouragement given to tradefmen and day 
labourers to refide in it. There has been, however, a de- 
creafe of 87 upon the whole, within thefe 40 years, as the 
return to Dr Webfter, in 1755, was 466. There is no regi- 
fter of burials kept in the parifli. 

Heritorif 



of Arroquhar. 



 ^ V 

4.3^ 



HeriiofSi Renty bfc — There are only two heritors, one of 
whom is proprietor of nearly the whole parifli, but does not 
refide in it. The rent,- after Whitfunday next, will be near 
1200I. Sterling. The farms, which were let in leafe about 
7 years ago, and, fmce that time, pay, on an average, double 
the fornier rent, and are ftill increafing in value. After the 
introduction of flieep into this country, the proprietors found 
it their intcreft, to let as much ground to one man as he 
could ftock, fo that the principal farms In this parifli and 
neighbourhood are in the hands of a few. One man pof- 
felTes now what was formerly thought fufllcient for 5 or 5 
tenants, and yet the condition of the lower clafs is not ren- 
dered worfe. About 40 years ago, fome of the tenants could 
afford to pay very little more than the public burdens for 
thele farms, which now pay a high rent to the proprietor. 
Formerly, every tackfman was bound to perform work with 
men and horfes, a certain number of days yearly, or to pay 
fo much in lieu thereof, in the option of the mafter ; but in 
moft of the leafes, which have been granted of late, thefc 
perfonal fervices, and the other cafualties payable by the te- 
nants, are converted into cafli, and included in the rent. 

Occupations. — The finall tenants and cottagers find employ- 
ment, either in repairing the high roads along with the mili- 
tary, building dykes, manufacturing timber and barks in 
woods, or at the herring fifhing, which they generally at- 
tend, from the beginning of harveft till New Year's day. 

Prices of Labour.— On an average, the wages of a man fer- 
•vant are i s. a day, from the beginning of February till the 
beginning of November, without victuals. The day's wages 
of a Wright are 1 s. j of a taylor 8 d. ; of a carpenter i s. 
6 d. ; of a fhosraaker 8 d. ; and of a mower of hay 1 s. be.

li. s iheir maintenance. The wages of women fervants, in 
general, are 3 tl. a day; but in harveft 6d. exclufive of their 
vidluals, When they eat in their mafter's houfe, they receive, 
on an average 3 I. a year^ and the mpn fervants, about 6 1. 
In this parifli they all eat in the houfe, except fhepherds, 
who live at a diftant corner of the farm. Thefc have a be- 
nefit from the mafter, that is to fay, a houfe, 52 ftones of 
meal, 2 cows grafs, ground for potatoes, and grafs for 60 
fheep in the hill, which may amount in all to 14 1. or 15 1. 
Sterling per annum. 

Church. — The parlfli of Arroquhar was originally an ap- 
pendage of the parifli of Lufs, and was disjoined from it in 
the year 1658. The ftipend, including the glebe, is below 
the minimum. The manfc, which is in bad repair, was built 
in the year 1 754. Sir James Colquhoun of Lufs, Bart, is 
patron. 

Poor, — ^The number of poor, upon the roll at prefent, is 9. 
The weekly colledlions amount to about 7 1. Sterling a year, 
which are diftributed, together with the intereft of 50I. Ster- 
ling, left to the poor of the parifli, by the late Robert Car- 
inichael of Broonily, and the intereft of another fmall fum 
appropriated for their benefit. 

pt/Jj The fifli, which frequent Lochlong, are cod, had- 
docks, feath, lythe, whitings, flounders, mackarel, trouts, an4 
herrings. Nobody in this place, a few individuals excepted, 
give themfelves the trouble of fifliing any of thefe fpecies^ 
but the latter, which are fometlmes got in abundance. For 
thefe two feafons paft, each man employed in the herrmg 
fifhing, has cleared 8 1. on an average, between the middle of 
harveft and the ift of January.

/y^/._The common fuel is peats, which are got in abun- 
dance in the hills. But it fometimes happens, that after all 
the expence and trouble of carting and fitting them up, the 
feafon may be fo wet as to put it out of the poWer of the 
tenants to get them home. The better fort of farmers, wKo 
live near Lochlong, make ufe of coals, which cdfl: about 5 s. 
6 d. the Glafgow cart, including freight, &amp;c. It is believed, 
upon the whole, every thing being confidered, that they arc 
cheaper than peats. 

Prices of Provjficns — The average price of oat meal may. 
be eftimated at i s. per peck. Sometimes Irifh meal is im- 
ported into Lochlong, and fold under that price i but meal 
manufadlured in the country is often above it. The average 
price of butter is 9 d. per lib. ; of coaimon cheefe, 5 s. the 
Hone tron weight ; of a hen i s. ; and of eggs, 3 d. the do-i 
zen. The price of beef is regulated by the Glafgow and 
Dumbarton markets. 

Roads and Bridges. — The principal roads and bridges iri 
this parifh are kept in repair at the expence of government. 
The hne of road, which leads to Inverary, being the moft 
public, is kept in good order ; but the line from Tarbert, 
leading to Tyndrum, is much neglected. In feveral places^ 
particularly at the point of Farkift, and at Craig-art-arenj the! 
road has been ill planned. Inftead of bringing it iip a fteep 
hill, it fhould have been brought, at both places, round the 
point along the fide of the loch, which would not have been 
much longer, and might have been executed at nearly as lit- 
tle expence as the pfefent line. It is inudh wifhed, that the 
roads in thefe places may be {boh altered, and the pulls taker! 
off, which are fo inconvenient for travellers, and fo opprefilve 
to horfes. The other roads are kept ip. repair at the ex- 
pence

Stati/iical Account 



pence of the tenants and cottagers. Lafl year the former 
were affeflcd at the rate of 1 1 s. for every 30 1, of real rent. 
This aflcffliient varies according to circumftances. The ul- 
iimatum is 12 s. for every ploughgate, or 30 1. Sterling of 
r.cnt^ which the commiffioners of fupply cannot exceed. The 
latter pay from i s. 6 d. to 2 s. 6 d. according to their abili- 
ties. The bye-roads in Arroquhar might be kept in good 
repair with the one half of the money levied in it, or per- 
haps with, lefs ; notwithftanding, the affefllnent is as high as 
it is in thefe parifiies within the dilbift, where the roads are 
bad, (the truftecs having it in their power, to appropriate the 
furplus money to any other part of the diftridt, where they 
think it neceflary), which is confidered as a grievance. 

Pojis — Every night, about 8 o'clock, (Wednefday except- 
ed), a pofi: arrives from Invcrary, and another, at the fame 
'ttme, from Dumbarton. Thefe are fiicceeded by other two, 
who wait their arrival, and fet out loon after with the mails. 
They meet near the head of Lochlong, where they are all 
ftationed, (which is half way between the port: towns, or 22 
miles diftant from each), and fucceed one another alternate- 
ly. There being no allowance made for horfes, they are 
obliged to travel on foot, which is a laborious tafk in winter. 
It very rarely happens, however, that the fnow is fo deep on 
the road as to ftop travellers. In March 1782, the commu- 
nicatio.n between Dumbarton and Inverary was interrupted 
for a few dap ; but fuch a fall of fnow, fo uncommon at 
that feqjon, may not happen again in a century. 

Lotigtinge. — Both the Gaelic and Englifli languages are 
fpoken here. The former is moft prevalent, and is beft un- 
derftood, particularly by the old people. The names of 
places are Gaelic, and defcriptive of their local fituation. 

General 



of Arroquhar* j^y^ 

Oeneral Character.— Wit greater part of the people in the 
pari 111 are ALuf at lanes, who have always had, till of late, a 
ftrong attachment to the laird, as their chief; and while this 
fubfifted, mifanthropy and ferocity of manners were promi- 
nent features in their charadtcr. Several circumftances, how- 
ever have occurred, to deftroy the influence of the feudal 
fyftem in this place. The military roads, which were made 
after the year 1745, "opened a free communication with other 
parts of the kingdom, and an intercourfe with ftrangerS. 
The confsquence of this was, that the rnind expanded by- 
degrees, to embrace, within its grafp, people of other deno- 
minations, and. to weaken that prejudice which it conceived 
in favour of an individuai, and a particular clan. The fet- 
tlement of fome graziers here, from the low country, contri- 
buted likewife to produce thofe happy effects. They were 
at firft confidered by the natives as aliens, and invaders of 
property, to which they had no natural right, being neither 
lineal dependents, nor collateral branches of the iVlacfarlane 
race. Such was their antipathy to their new neighbours, 
that they made feveral abortive attempts to extirpate them. 
This, however, gradually fubfided, and they lived together 
afterwards in habits of frieudfliip. The fale of the eltate 
of Arroquhar, which happened fome years agc^, contributed 
alfo i.ot a little to extinguifli the remains of that fyftem of 
barbarity, which fo long retarded the progrefs of civilization 
in Europe. In proportion as it loft its influence, the manners 
of the people changed to the better. They are now civile 
well bred, honeft, induftrious, and not addidled to an immo- 
derate ufe of fpirituous liquors.

<p>Nattiey Situation, and ExtetM. 

THIS parlfh is fuppofed to take its name from a Gaelic 
word which fignifies farm ; probably in allufion to 
the quality of the foil, which is, in general, very good, and 
which might then be fuperior in fertility to the neighbour- 
ing diftrifts. Others derive it from a word in the fame lan- 
guage, fignifying the den and if it was meant to apply to 
that part where the church ftands, it is very charafteriftic, 
as it is fituated in a low place, of an elliptical form. The ex- 
tent of this parilh is about 2 miles from eaft to weft, and 5 
from fouth to north. It is fituated 6 miles from Brechin, 
(the feat of the prefbytcry), and lies in the county of Angus 
or Forfar. 

Sot/, C/imate, tsff.— The greater part of the furface is a 
light loam, and has a good expofure ; the reft, which may 
comprehend a farm or two, has a clay bottom. In the hilly 
parts there are 5 ftieep farms. The fheep walks are whole- 
fome, few dying of the rot, or by any hurtful herbs. The 
climate, for this northern latitude, is mild and temperate, 
particularly towards the fouth i in the hilly parts, fomewhat

^re fharp, and cold ; yet the whole is accounted falubrious 
there being no ftanding lakes or marfhes, which are often fo 
fatal to health. Of courfe, difeafes arifing from colds and 
damps are not frequent, and the people, in general, live to a 
good old age. 

Rivers^ Hills, and T rets. — There are two burns or rivulets 
in the parifh, the Cruick and the Noram. The former has 
its fource in it, and both abound with black trouts. The 
hills abound with the ordinary game of the Grampians. A- 
bout 25 years ago, it had a very naked appearance : There 
was no timber of any fort, but a few planes and afties, in the 
old tafte, round the garden dykes ; but now there are feve- 
ral hundred acres laid out in plantations of Scottifh fir, and 
hard timber, all in a thriving ftate. 

Cattle. — There are about 120 or 130 horfes employed in 
hufbandry, from 2 to 4 in a plough. On the Iheep farms 
above 800 flieep are kept, of different breeds ; and their 
wool fells, one year with another, from 14 s. to 2os. fer 
flone. 

Fuel and Fojftls. — The tenants have peat and furze from 
the hills, and drive fome coals from the neareft fea-port 
towns, Montrofe and Arbroath. Within thefe few years, 
there has been difcovered, in the grounds, of the principal 
proprietor, a flate quarry, of a light blue colour, and pretty 
hard. A few cart loads have been taken out of it, but no 
farther trial has been as yet made. 

Population.— YoT thefe 30 years pall the population has 
been on the decreafe. Many petty farms being con- 
verted into one, numbers of families have been driven into 
the towns j and farms that formerly fupported 5 or 6 fami- 
lies.

lies, are poflefled only by one. The whole number of fouls, 
young and old included, is about 490. The return to Dr 
WebOer, in 1755, was 500, but the amount was probably 
more confiderable. The marriages laft year amounted 
to 4, the births to 9, and the deaths to 7. There are 3 fhoe- 
makers in the parifli, 4 taylors, and 4 weavers. 

Heritors atid Rent. — There are only 4 heritors ; two occu- 
py their own lands, a third has only one farm, all the reft of 
the parilh is the property of one gentleman. The lands let 
at from 5 s. to 25 s per acre. The valued rent is 23141. 3 s. 
4d. Scots, or 192I. i6s. li|d. Stcrhng. Tne real rent, 
as now paid, has not been afcertained. 

jigriculture. — The crops chiefly railed are oats, peafe, bar-

The feed time commences the ift of March, and the harvefl:

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4093370">BONHIL</name>. 

{County of DujJibarion.J 
By the Rev. Mr GoRDONSTEWARTy Minijier of that Parifj.</head>



<p>Name, Situation^ Extent^ ^c. 

THE parifli of Bonhil is fituated in the county and 
prefbytei y of Dumbarton. It is 4 and one half miles ia 
length, and about 4 miles in breadth, forming nearly a fquare. 
The ancient mode of fpelling the name of the parifh was 
Buneilf which, in the opinion of fome judges of the GaeUc 
language, means a bottom or hollow. Others imagine, that it 
fignifies the furgcot^s refidcrtce^ as the antient family of Len- 
nox had a manfion houfe in the parifh, and feveral places 
derive their names from their fervants and dependants. 
Bonhil was ereSl:ed into a parifli by that family *. The 
original diftrift was very fmall, and, about the middle of 
the lafi century, lands were disjoined from the pariflies of 
Lufs and Kilmarnock, and annexed to that of Bonhil. 

The 

* The time of Its ereflion is mentioned either in Keith's Hif- 
tory of the Bifliops, or in Duncan Stewart's Hiflory of the 
Stewarts, vol. 2d. The three Tullichcum, Stockragent, Ca- 
meron, and Auchindinnans, were disjoined from the pariih of 
Lufs ; the lands of Bailoch, Ledreftbeg, Bellagan, and Blur- 
hich, were disjoined from the parifli of Kilmarnock. 



of Bonhil.

The foutlx end of Loch-Lomond is furrounded by part 
of iti but a defcription of that lake will more properly 
beloDg to another parilh. This part of the lake, with the 
Leven which illlies from it, divide the parifli nearly into two 
equal parts, 

River The Leven, though not fo large as the Tweed or 

the Tay, may be reckoned amongll the large rivers in Scot- 
land. It is remarkable for the foftnefs of its water, and the 
clearnefs of its ftream. Thofc who are judges of the Gaelic 
language, derive its name from the words Le, which fignifies 
fmooth or foft, and Avon, a river. It ilTues from Locli-Lo. 
mond at Balloch, and falls into the Frith of Ciyde at Dum- 
barton Caftle. In a ftreight line from the lake to the Clyde, 
it will meafure about 5 miles ; but the courfe of the Leven, 
owing to its windings, will be more thjan 9 miles. The fall 
from the lake to the Clyde is 22 feet. The river is notwith- 
ftanding navigable for one half of the year. The tide comes 
up the river more than a third of its length ; and where the 
tide fails, the veflels are drawn up the river with horfes,, 
Thefe veflels arc conftru(R:ed long and narrow, on purpofe for 
the navigation of the Leven, in order to draw little water. 
They are chiefly employed in bringing coals and lime, and 
other heavy articles, to the manufa6lurers, and to the gentle- 
men who reflde upon the banks of the Leven and of the lake ; 
and in carrying down the wood and barks that grow upon the 
banks, with flates from the flatc quarries in the parifh of 
Lufs. 

FiJJj — The Leven produces falmon, pp.rr, aiid a variety of 
trout, and other fmall flfli. The falmon it produces are 
reckoned among the bell in Scotland. Whether this is 
owing to the f|-or£ners of the n:n from the fea, or their com- 
ing 



444 



Statiftical Account 



ing into the river early in the feafon, is uncertain. Whea 
the feafon is mild, there are falmon in the river in the end 
of Decenaber. The greateft number is taken in the months 
of March and April. The largeft falmon ever taken in the 
Leven weighed 45 lib. troy weight. The falmon fifhing in 
that part of the Leven which lies in the parilh of Bonhil, 
rented, about 50 years ago, at 300 merks. The laft leafe was at 
the rate of 150I. Sterling. This rife of rent has not been ow- 
ing to the increafe of falmon in the river but has principally 
arifen from two caufes, the great rife in the price of Salmon, 
and the greater attention that has been paid to the fifliery, 
with the improved methods which have been adopted. The 
price of falmon here depends upon the Edinburgh and Glas- 
gow markets. In the beginning of the feafon, or before the 
firft of May, a confiderable quantity are fent over land to 
iPerth, and from thence to London, 

There is at prefcnt a law fuit depending about the right to 
the trout filhings in the Leven. The queftion is, whether a 
charter from the Crown, granting the falmon and other fi{h:ngs 
in the Leven, gives an exclufive right to the trout fifliings ? Or 
whether trouts are to be reckoned among the res nullius, or 
to be coafidered as annexed to land, and that every proprie- 
tor has a right to the trout fiftiing oppofite to his property.? 

PopuIation.^Thc return to Dr Webfter, in 1755, was 901 
-fouls. From a lift of the inhabitants, taken in Jajj^iary 1791, 
it appears that they amounted to 23 10 in all. Of that num- 
ber there were 562 under 10 years of age. In the year 1 790, 
there were 82 births, 47 burials, and 21 marriages, whereof 
there were only 9 inftances, in which both parties belonged 
to the panfh. There is an imperfeft record of births, as far 
back the y«ar 1677, from which it appears, that there 

were 



445 



were 38 births that year. The population of the parifh has 
been fince decreafing, until 1768, when the firft print field 
was ereded. There were only 27 births that year, and, by 
a lift of the inhabitants, taken in 1 769, the population was 
about 640 above 6 years of age. It has varied fince 1 768, 
according to the brilknefs or dulnefs of manufactures ; and 
therefore, if the lift of the inhabitants had been taken dur. 
ing the lummer, the population would have been about 100 
fouls more than are above ftated. 

Profelfions. — Of the above number there are 993 employ- 
ed by the three printfields, whereof 507 are women ; befides 
67 boys and girls under 10 years of age. It is not eafy to ftate 
the number employed at the bleachfields, as it varies fo much 
at different feafons of the year. Befides thefe, there are 7 
fmiths, 15 flioemakers, 12 taylors, 21 wrights, and 6 millers 
of different kinds ; 2 diftillers, 4 excife officers, 8 (hopkeepcrs, 
and 14 keepers of alehoufes. 

Mam/a^ures. — Some peculiar excellencies in the water of 
Leven, have encouraged feveral manufaflurers to fettle in 
this parifh. The Leven is remarkable for the foftnefs of its 
water, which fits it, in a peculiar manner, for the purpofes of 
bleaching. It is feldom or never muddy, as the rivers and 
burns, from the Highland hills, fall firft into Loch-Lomond, 
where the mud they carry along with them fubfides^ It is not, 
therefore, fubje£l to the fudden rifings and fallings which, 
moft other rivers are liable to. By gradually rifing and fal- 
ling, it is fitted for the different kinds of machinery, which, 
are fo convenient and neceffary for Carrying on the manu* 
failures. There are at prefent 3 printfields, and 4 bleach- 
fields in the parilh. The duties paid to government from 
them for one year, ending 5th July 1790, amounted to 

8971 K 



44^ Siaiijical Account 

$9711. ps.j thofe of this laft year, ending 5th July 1791, 
to 13,2961. 8 s. 4d. } from which it is evident, that the 
trade has increafed rapidly. From thefe duties, a calculatioE 
may be made of the value of the goods nianufaftured. By 
a ftatement laid before the Houfe of Commons, a few years 
ago, the duties upon printed Lnens and muflms were fuppof- 
ed to be equal to 10 per cent, of tke whole value. There 
can be no calculation made of the value of the goods bleach- 
ed on the banks of the river. 

The firft printfield on the Leven was begun about the year 
1 768 i the other two were eredled a few years ago. Ai firft, 
the printing bi.finefs was almoft wholly confined to handker- 
chiels, and in thefe no great variety of colours was attempted ; 
it was all done by what is called block printing. They after- 
wards eredted copperplate prefles. Thefe prefles were at firft 
driven by the hand ; but as they required great force, the man 
who drove the prefs was obliged to reft frequently : This kept 
the oihtr 2 idle, for there were 3 men employed about every 
prefs. lo remedy this, they have conftrudted fonie preftes to 
be driven by water, one of which, driven by 2 men, can print 
from 20 to 30 dozen of handkerchiefs in one hour. 'Jhefe 
prefles, at firft, were almoft wholly employed in printing 
handkerchiefs ; but of late they have improved them, fo as 
to print two or more colours upon their fineft linens and 
muflins, leaving the fprigs and flowers to be put on after- 
wards by the block printers. At the printfields upon the 
Leven, they have contrived, of late, to do a great deal of 
work by machinery driven by water, which formerly was 
done by the hand, and at great expence. Their calicoes, for 
variety and finenefs of colour, are reckoned the firft in Bri. 
tain ; the neighbourhood of London itfelf can fcarcely be ex- 
cepted. 

Wages. 



if Bonh'ii: 447 

}yages. — For fomp years after the firft printfield was eredl- 
ed, the bufinefs was conducted upon a Imall fcale, and that 
part of it, which is properly called the printing, was almoft 
wholly done by apprentices, bound for the term of 7 years, 
at the rate of 3 s per week for the tirft 3 years, and 4 s. for 
the laft 4 years. The common labourers had, in general, 
10 d. per day. Some years ago, feveral new printfields were 
erected in Scotland, and the trade came to be greatly extend- 
ed and improved by the old ones, which occalioning a great 
demand for journeymen, their wages rofe amazingly. For 
fome years part, the wages of a journeyman may be ftared at 
18 s. per week ; and thofe of a common labourer at the print- 
fields, may be reckoned at 6 s. per week. Thofe who have 
acquired any degree of fkill in bleaching or dying, may get 
about 7 s. weekly. 

Of the hands employed at the printfields, there is nearly 
an equal number of both lexes. The wages given ta 
the women, at firft, were generally at the rate of 3 s. per 
week. They are now in general paid by the piece, and they 
may be faid to earn 14 s. per month, at an average. The 
greater part of the women are employed in pencilling. A 
great variety of colours cannot be put upon the printed cloth 
without the afilftance of the pencil. The boys and girls 
have, in general, 6 s. 8 d. per month ; a very few of them 
have 8 s. 

Formerly, the operative manufacturers were employed by 
their mafters at day's wages ; but the mafters, for fome time 
paft, have found it their intereft to give fo much money for 
the piece of work, and to leave it to the operative hands to 
do much or little as they choofe. As Toon as the trade came 
to be put upon this footing, fome of the operative people 

difcovered

difcovcrcd amazing induftry, and made very great wages j al- 
though the mafters had the fame quantity of work done for 
Icfs money, than formerly when the men were at days wages. 
For thefe two years paft, however, there have been violent 
difputes between the mafters and fervants, about the prices 
for the different pieces of work ; the mafters, on the one 
hand endeavouring to reduce the prices, and to lower the 
wages, to what they thought the trade could bear ; and the 
fervants, on the other, endeavouring to keep up the prices, 
and entering into thofe illegal combinations, that are now be- 
come fo common among the manufadturers of this country. 
Among other manoeuvres, they appointed a committee of 
their number, from the different printfields in the weft of Scot- 
land, to meet and to regulate the prices, which they were to o- 
blige their mafters to give for the different pieces of work. They 
were to allow no perfons to be employed, but fuch as came 
under certain regulations which they had framed ; and, that 
the number of hands might not increafe too faft, the mafters 
were not to be allowed to take in more apprentices, than the 
operative fervants thought proper. Thefe meafures obliged 
the mafters to commence prolccutions, and to imprifon fome 
of their hands laft fummer, and a kind of compromife has 
been made between the mafters and fervants for a time ; but it 
will be eafily forefeen, that one of the parties rauft be in 
complete fubje^tion to the other, before the trade can be up- 
on a proper or fure footing. The apprentices to the print- 
ing bufmefs are, after the firft or fccond year, generally em- 
ployed at piece work ; and, from the prices that are allowed 
them, they can make from 8 s. to los. per week. 

Manners. — From this change in the wages of the manu- 
fafturers upon the banks of the Leven, it will be eafily fup- 
pofed, that their manners and mode of living has undergone 

fome

of Bonhil. 449 

fome change. At firfl: they were remarkable for fobriety : 
Their principal food was porridge and potatoes ; even milk 
and bread was confidered as a luxury. They difplayed their 
zeal and their learning in declaiming againft patronage and 
Arminian preaching ; and the man who was able to fpare 
fome money to fupport a diflenting clergyman, came to con- 
fider himfelf as a man of confequence. In procefs of time re- 
ligious difputes came in fome meafure to be negledled or for- 
gottenj and then, like moft other manufacturers, they came 
to be extravagant in the articles of drefs, tea, and fpiritous li- 
quors, &amp;c. They are only beginning, however, to ufe butche'r 
meat. It may appear paradoxical, but it is a faSl, that among 
the common labourers, who receive moderate wages, there are 
many who fave a little money ; whereas, among thofe who 
receive great wages, fuch inftances are more rare. 

Villages. — There are two villages built in the pari fh, be fides 
feveral houfes built upon feus, or long leafes, by the manu- 
fa«Sturers adjoining the printfields. In one of the villages, 
the houfes are built upon feus, at the rate of 8 1. per acre ; 
in the other, upon a leafe of 99 years, at the rate of 6 1. per 
acre. The grounds occupied by the printfields and bleach- 
fields, are feued at the rate of 2 1. 10 s. per acre. Some of 
the ground, adjacent to the villages and printfields, is rented 
at 2 1. per acre. 

Refit — The valued rent of the pari fli is 2 180 I. 9s. 2d. 
Scotch. It is impoflible to fay exadlly what the real rent 
may be, as a great deal of the land is in the proprietor's own 
hands j but it is fuppofed to be about 2500 1. Sterling. 

Soil and Produce.— The parifti is all inclofed and fubdivid- 
ed. The foil, as in moft others, is various. The low ground 

3 L upon 



45© 



Staii/lical Account 



upon the banks of the Leven and the lake, is partly a rich loamy 
and partly a light gravel. The rifing ground is more wet,- 
and tilly, and fome part of it covered with heath. The pro- 
duce of the ground is barley or bear, oats, peafe, potatoes, 
and turnips, with a fmall quantity of wheat and flax ; but 
the greater part of the land is either under hay, or in paf- 
ture. 

Wood. — There are about 250 acres planted with Scotch 
firs and larix. A cutting of the natural wood, at 20 years 
of age, is worth about 2350 L Sterling. The afli tree, in the 
church yard of Bonhill, deferves a particular defcription, be- 
ing no lels remarkable for its uncommon fize, than for its 
extenfive fpreading, and the regularity of its branches. The 
trunk is 9 feet in length, the girth, immediately above the 
furface of the ground, is 25 feet ; about 3 feet above the 
furface it meafures ipi feet ; and, at the narrowed part, 18 
feet. It divides into 3 great branches •, the girth of the 
largeft is 11 feet; of the fecond, lo; and of the third, 9, 
feet 2 inches. The branches hang down to within a few 
feet of the ground, and, from the extremity of the branches- 
en the one fide, to that of thofe on the other, it meafures 
no lefs than 94 feet.. There is another large afh tree in the 
parifli, though it is greatly decayed, only the trunk, and part 
of fome of the branches remaining. The trunk is about 1 1 
feet in length ; the girth, immediately above the furface of 
•the ground, is 33 feet ; at the narroweft part it meafures 19 
feet 10 inches. The proprietor has lately fitted up a room 
in the infide of it, with benches around, and 3 glafs win- 
dows. The diameter of the room is 8 feet 5 inches, and 
from 1 o to II fc-et high. 



Mills. 



ef Bonhil, 451 

^lilh. — There are 3 corn mills in the parlfh ; at one of 
which they have eredled machinery for making pearl barley, 
and for grinding wheat and madder. Tliere is likewife a mill 
for drefEng flax, and they are erefling machinery for grind- 
ing logwood. 

Cattle. — There are about 160 horfes, and about 100 fheep 
in the parifli ; but It is impoflible to fay any thing with cer- 
tainty refpeSling the number of black cattle, as it varies fo 
much at the different feafons of the year, many being brought 
.from the Highlands in the beginning of fummer, and flaugh- 
tered in the end of the feafon. 

Ecclefiajlical State and SchooL — The ftipend is 82I- bolls of 
vi61:ual, and about 27 1. in money, paid by a decreet in the 
year 1654. The kirk was built in the year 1747, and the 
manle in the 1758. The Duke of Montrofe is patron The 
fchoolmafter's lalary is 2co merks. There is no diffenting 
meeting houfe in the pariih ; bmt there is a kirk of relief in 
the neighbouring parifh of Kilmarnock, which is attended 
by 210 perfons, above 6 years of age, from this parifli. There 
is alio a Burgher Seceding meeting houfe in the parifli of 
Cardrofs, which is frequented by 180 perfons from that of 
Bonhill. There are hkcwife a few Antiburgher Seceders, 
and 6 or 7 Covenanters. 

Heritors. — The number of heritors is 27, the greater part 
ot whom have but fmall properties ; the reft being divided a- 
mong 9 or 10, who generally refide, the greater part of the 
year, in the parifli. 

P^sr.— The number of poor is from 30 to 35. Tlie funds 
for fupporting them are, a capital of fomething above 300!. 

Sterling, 



45 2 Stati/tical Account 

Sterling, which is lent out at intereft ; and the ordinary col- 
leftlons in church, with the mort-cloth dues, and the fines 
for fornication, which amount in all to 40 1. or 50 1. Sterling 
a year. 

Fuel.- — ^The companies get their coals by water. A cart, 
weighing 12 cwt cofts 5 s. Sterling. The operatives, who 
get them in fmall quantities, and by land, from Dumbarton, 
pay 6 s. per cart. The farmers carry their coals in carts about 
13 or 14 miles, and pay 2 s. 6 d. at the pit. Coals are alfo 
got fome miles nearer, but of an inferior quality, at 1 8 d. per 
cart at the pit. 

Antiquities. — The antient family of Lennox had a manfion 
houfe at the fouth end of Loch-Lomond ; but nothing re- 
mains at prefent but the foffe, which is ftill entire. The tra? 
dition is, that the materials of the manfion were carried from 
this place to one of the iflands of the lake, to build a caftle 
there, as a place of greater fafety, and where a confiderable 
part of the building ftill remains, thoygh in ruins. They 
bad another houfe in the parifli, which is entire, and is at 
prelent pofftfled by Mr \ule of Darleith. From its fitua- 
tion, and from the fmallnefs of its fize, it is fuppofed to have 
been k -pt as ^ hunting feat. There is no infcription to afcer- 
tain the date ; but it is believed to have been built by the 
antient family of Lennox, before the eftate came into the 
poffeffion of the Stewarts, The whole lands in the parifh 
formerly belonged to the family of Lennox ; but in the 15th 
century, the Darnly family, by marriage, got one half of the 
eftate, and the titles. Ihe other half went to the Rulky 
family. This laft half was afterwards divided between the 
families of Napier and Gleneagles. The Darnly family got 
the greateft part of this parifh. That of Gleneagles got 

fome

453 



fome farms, whereof they are ftill in polTefiicn of the fupe- 
riority, along with confiderable feu duties. 

Mifcellaneoti^ Obfervatlons. — The oldeft inhabitant at pre» 
fent in this parifh, is a man of 87 years of age. — There are 
two licenced dillillers in it.— The woods are famous for the 
number of woodcocks that frequent them during winter ; 
and the river and lake for a great variety of fea fowl. In fe- 
vere feafons fwans frequent the lake. — Inchmarin, one of the' 
iilands in Lochlomond, is at an equal diftance from the pa- 
jrifties of Bonhill, Lufs, Kilmarnock, and Buchanan. Some 
parts of Lcnnoxfhire, now Dumbartonfhire, were formerly 
annexed to Stirlingfliire. From this circumftance, it is not 
determined to what county it belongs ; and as it pays no fti- 
pend, it is equally undetermined to what parifh. It is the 
largeft ifland in the lake ; is about 2 miles long, and from 
half a mile to one mile broad. It is beautiful, and finely 
wooded. The Montrofe family ufe it as a deer park, where 
they keep about 200 fallow deer. The ruins of the caftle, 
formerly belonging to the Lennox family, are ftill upon this 
Ifland The perlon, who has the charge of the woods and 
the deer, refides with his family upon it. Some years ago, 
many pcrfons difordered in their fenfes, were fent to it as to 
a place of confinement ; and thofe of the fair fex, who were 
fb unfortunate as to give pregnant proofs of their frailty, 
were fent here to avoid the reproach of the world. At that 
time the neighbouring clergyman, who happened to be a 
ftrift difciplinarian, and very zealous againft fornicators, 
claimed Inchmarin as belonging to his charge : But owing to 
complaints of abufe, the proprietor, for fome time -paft, has 
not allowed his forrefter to take lodgers.

PARISH OF <name ref="NA">DALZIELf</name> 

, (County of Lanark.^ 

^y the Rev. Mr Robert Clawson.</head>



<p>Etymology of th Name, 

THIS parifh is fuppofed, by fome, to have got its name 
from the anceftors of the Dalziels, Earls of Carnwath. 
Others fay the name is of Celtic origin, and fignifies white 
field in the Gaelic language, which they fuppofe « it has ob- 
tained from a kind of white vegetable fcurf, which grows 
over the clay foil, before it is fweetened by cultivation. But 
whether the parifh has given the firname to that family, or 
derived its name from them, it is certain that the barony was 
vefted in them by a charter from King Robert III. in the 
year 1395. It appears, by an old charter ftill extant, that it 
had before been in the hands of a family of the name of 
Sandilands, in the reign of Malcolm Can more, and had af- 
terwards come to be in the gift of the Crown, whether fromi 
failure of heirs, or forfeiture, is not known. There is a tra- 
dition, that at an early period, a baron of the name of Nifbit 
alfo -held fome part of the parifh. The Dalziels retained 
thefe lands till the year 1600, when they were fold to James 
Hamilton, the brother of Sir John Hamilton of Orbifton, 
who was Lord Juftice Clerk in the reign of Charles I.; and 
a defcendant of that gentleman is the prefent proprietor. 



vf Dalziel, 



455 



Mr Hamilton holds the whole parifh Immediately of the 
Crown, and is proprietor of about eleven-twelfths of it. 
The remainder is held of him in feu. He is alfo patron of 
the parifh, and titular of the tythes. 

Situation and Extent.— This parifli is fituafed in the middle 
ward of the county of Lanark, in the prefbytery of Hamil- 
ton, and fynod of Glafgow and Ayr. It is of an oblong fi- 
gure, and would be pretty regular, if it were not for a part 
of the parifli of Hamilton, lying on the fiime fide of the 
Clyde, indented in it, and almoft interfe6ting it. There is a 
tradition, that this part was disjoined from the parifh of 
Dalziel, on account of the mifdemeanours of a curate, who 
Was then incumbent. Why it was not reftored to his fuc- 
cefTors is not known. It would have been convenient that 
it had been fo, for the living is very fmall. The whole 
length, from fouth eaft to north weft, is about 4 miles, and 
the breadth about 2. Mr Hamilton's eflate, including roads, 
gtc. contains 21 13 Scotch acres, and the other properties 
being about a twelfth more, makes the whole 2289 acres. 
The diflance from Glafgow is about 1 3 miles, from Lanark 
about 12, and no part of the parifh is above 4 from Hamil- 
ton. 

Surface, Soi/, i^'c. — The land is low, and the furface even 
and regular, being varied only here and there by gentle in- 
equalities. It rifes moderately from the two rivers Clyde 
and Calder, by which it is bounded, to a kind of flat ridge, 
having always fuflicient declivity to carry off the water. 
There is fcarcely any part of it much more than 150 feet 
above the level of the fea. On account of this, and the na- 
ture of the foil, fnow feldom lies here. It frequently hap- 
pens, that while the neighbouring fields lie buried under a 

white 



Statiflical Account 



white cdverlhg, here alone a mild verdure appears. Thd 
banks of the Clyde, all along this parifh, are low, with fine 
vallies or meadows along the fide of the river, except in one 
place, where there is a bold rocky bank for about 300 or 400 
yards. Upon the top of this bank, the father of the prefent, 
proprietor, apprehended, from the veftige of a trench, inclof- 
ing a fpot of an oblong figure, about the fourth part of an 
acre, that he difcovered fomething like the remains of a Ro- 
man Caftellum or outpoft, and built a little temple or fum- 
mer houfe, as well to perpetuate that circumftance, as for the 
fake of the variety of magnificent landfcapes to be feen from 
the fpot as it commands a view of Hamilton houfe, the 
town of Hamilton, and the finely diverfified fields around 
them ; and alfo an extenfive profpeft both up and down the 
river, taking in a great number of grand and beautiful ob- 
jects. This commanding fituation feemed to favour the con- 
jedlure, that it had been an outpoft belonging to a pretoriim^ 
or Roman camp, in another part of this parifli to be after 
mentioned. When the ditch was cleared out, nothing was 
difcovered but a quantity of vitrified cinders refembling the 
drofs of a fmith's forge. Mr Hamilton alfo cleared the face 
of the rock of the furze and brambles, with which it was 
covered, and cut a number of terrace walks along it, placing 
feats at advantageous fituations, and planting various kinds of 
fruit and forefl trees, where ever they could be admitted ; 
and in the year 1789, the fruit on this hitherto unprofitable 
fpot, was fold for 30 1. Sterling. 

The banks of the Calder are beautifully diverfified with 
coppices and Hoping glades ; and upon the eaft corner of the 
parifh, become boldly rocky and romantic. On thefe banks 
Mr Hamihon of Wifhaw, who has a farm here, has many 

acres 



of Dahiel.

acres of thriving foreft trees planted, which tend greatly to 
heighten the fcenery. 

The foil of the vallies is a rich loam ; the reft is almoft 
all of a ftrong marly clay, fome of it of a peculiar good cjiia- 
lity, lying in a natural llaie in thin horizontal layers, which 
eafily fepaiate in working. It appears naturally Ikrile, but, 
by the effects of cultivation, produces good crops ; aiiU there 
is perhaps no part of the neighbouring country capable of 
higher improvement. Even the bottom, tliough a pllly of 
that kind of blue till which is prevalent in this clay country, 
feems to be more favourable, particularly for the growl h of 
wood, than inoft of the neighbourhood ; which perhaps may 
be owing to its being divided alfo into thin lam.nie, tlirougU 
the fiffures of which the fu^erfluous u^oiilure filters oti'. 

Springs and Rivuleis. — From the evennefs of the furface, 
and denfity of the foil,'fprings of water are not numerous, 
and this, no doubt, has made thoie that appear more valued, 
the moft confiderable being dignified with the names of par- 
ticular faints, inch as, the Well of our Lady, St. Patrick's 
Well, St. Catharine's Weil, &amp;c. For the fame reafons there 
are few brooks, and thole but fmall ones. The moll: conli- 
derable is that formed by the conjun6\ion of St. Catharine's 
fpring, with another little rill, which runs through the in- 
clofures around Dalziel houle. In one part or its courie, it 
has obtained a deep bed, with pretty bold banks, and falls, 
in a few fine calcades, over the rocks which lie in its bot- 
tom. 

Antiquities. —On the north fide of this brook, upon the 
moft pidurefque part of the banks, ftands the manfion houfe

nor, which hns been fpared, and kept in repair, by the pr»- 
prietor, folely on account of its antiquity. It is a high Gothic 
building, with battlements and loop-holes on the top, and a 
foot path around within them ; but its age is not known. 
The great Roman highway, commonly called Watling Street, 
went along the lummit of this parifh from eaft to weft, but 
its courfe is now much defaced by modern improvements, 
much of it being dug up, and its bottom ploughed, and for 
fome length, the modern turnpike road is laid upon the top 
of it. In one place, however, near the center of the parifh, 
it has been preferved entire, fo as to point out the line to af- 
ter times, the crofs ftone, the emblem of the baron's jurif- 
diftion, being placed upon it, and that fenced and fecured 
by a large clump of trees planted around. At this place lies 
a large heap of the cinders of the Roman forges ftill un- 
touched. Along this antient road, at the weftern boundary 
pf the parifli, upon a fteep bank over the river Calder, 
is the remains of a pretorium, or Roman encampment. Little 
more than 20 years ago it was pretty entire ; but cultivation 
has now greatly encroached upon it. At the foot of the bank 
there is a femicircular arch over the river, of good mafon. 
ry, and very uncommon conftruftion, which has been fuppo- 
fed to be the work of the Romans. By this bridge Wattling 
Street feenis to have entered the parifli of Bothwell. In the 
halt of the old tower, or chateau above mentioned, an iron 
chain from the cielmg fulpends a luftre compoted of large 
ftag horns, connected with iron work, and having fockets 
for the candles of the fame metal. Where the gallows ftood, 
on which the antient barons ordered ti anfgreflbrs to be exe- 
cuted, there is a fmall column raifed, to perpetuate that 
mark of feudal dignity and the power annexed to it. The 
old church of Dalziel, lately deferted, is mentioned by Sir 
James Dalryn:i;ple, irj his H't^oncal Church CoikBionsy as a 

chaplainry 



of Dalziel,

thaplainry, dependent on the abbacy of Paifley, dedicated to 
iSt. Patrick. TIic font for holy water ftill remains fixed iii 
the wall. In the foundation of the weft gable, which was re- 
built in the year 171 8, was found a handibme ftone coffin, 
large enough to contain the body of a full grown man, but 
empty, and Teeming as if nothing had ever been in it. In the 
infide, the upper part is hollowed but to fuit the fhape of the 
head and neck ; and there was a hewn ftone cover for the 
face, with a ftar or cinque foil carved upon it. Upon the 
bank^ oppoCte to that on which the prefent manor houfe 
ftands, may ftill be traced the foundation of a fquare build- 
ing, faid to have been the refidence of the Baron Niftjit • 
above mentioned. By him the crofs, fpoken of abovCj is fald 
to have been fet up; 

Church and School. — Thfe prefent parifh church was built 
in the year 1789. It is a handlome edifice, with a fine fpire, 
ahd being placed near the centre of the parifti, upon the 
fummit of the ridge, is feen at a good diftance, and makes 
an agreeable objedt. The ftipend, in whole, is near 50 1. 
Sterling, with a houfe, garden, orchard, and a glebe of be- 
tween 5 and 6 acres. The falary of the fchoolmafter is the 
fmalleft legal one, with a dwelling houfe and garden. There 
being no other fchool in the parilh, the Icholars are very nu- 
merous. 

Culthation — The late Archibald Hamilton, F.fq; the father 
of the prefent proprietor, enjoyed the eftate during the courfc 
of a long life. His father had begun to plant a little, anri 
this branch of cultivation he profccuted. for a good part of 
his life, with great judgment and perfeverance, planting all 
kinds of trees kno.vn in this country, adapting each to its 
proper fituation and cxpofurc, and covering and adorning a 

country

country, which before was fterile and naked, with extenfivc 
forelts. His fuccefs was equal to his attention. -His planta- 
tions were extended to 150 acres of foreft trees, which are 
the admiration of all who have feen them ; to which his 
fiicctflor has added about 10 acres more, beautifying the 
country, and flieltering the neighbouring fields from the cut- 
ting blafts, by which alone the fertility of many of them is 
greatly increaied. He had the good fortune to live to fee 
trees, which he had planted after he appeared as a lawyer at 
the bar, grown to i 2 feet in girth. He pleafed himfelf with 
havin" the furniture of his dinin? room made of his own 
wood. And for feveral years fince his death, more timber 
of his planting has been fold in one year, than the value of 
the yearly rent of the eftate, when he entered into the pof- 
feffiop of it ; and yet the trees are ftill fo crouded, as to want 
room to expand their branches. 

He was no lefs attentive to the orchard, than to the foreft. 
Upon doping banks by the lides of brooks, &amp;c. he planted 
apple, pear, and plumb trees, from time to time, to the ex- 
tent of 20 acres-; and for a long time paft, fince thefe have 
grown up, the fruit has been fold, in good years, from 100 I. 
to 167 1. Of all thefe 20 acres, not 6 were worth 6d. 
an acre, except for pl anting foreli trees ; but from the variety 
of expofures which thofe oi chards enjoy, and the tall forefl:s 
■which embofom them, fo many of them are fecured from 
the injury of blights and mildews,- as always to enfure a crop 
of fruit,, if there be fruit any where in the country. 

Nor was he lefs fuccefsful in promoting improvement in 
agriculture, by cherifliing and prompting the induftry of his 
tenants. He convinced them, by the whole of his conduft, 
that he took an intereft in their welfare. He and his family 

made

jnade themfelves Intimately acquainted with their condition, 
were ever ready to hear their tale, to take part in their trou- 
ble, or to rejoice in their profperity. If any of his hufband- 
nien were born down with the preflure of incidental mis- 
fortunes, he raifed them again by his bounty and forbearance, 
never difmiffing any of them who were willing to continue 
in their^poflefEons ; but, at the end .of every leafe, preferring 
them or their pofterity to a new one, at a reafonable rent ; 
and this has been fo uniformly the practice of his family, 
that there are tenants who can reckon their anceftors in the 
poffefllon of the fame farm, previous to the period at which 
this family became proprietors. He inclofed the fields with 
hedges, and flieltered them with planting. He abolilhed the 
feudal cuftom of exading carnages and other lervices from 
his tenants ; and, in flaort, did every thing to turn their at- 
tention folely to the cultivation of their own farms. Under 
this mild and benevolent treatment, the peafantry, finding 
their induftry tended as much to their own and their pofte- 
rity's permanent advantage, as to that of an indulgent 
landlord, profited by every leflion and example. They began 
to fummer fallow their fields, to flreight their crooked ridges^ 
to carry lime, and make compofts ; and the benevolent fpirit 
of their landlord fpreading among them, every one is ready 
to affifi: his neighbour on all emergencies. And thus has the 
value of the eftate rifen to nearly five times the yearly rent, 
which it yielded when the fame gentleman firft fucceeded to 
it j and at the fiunc time the condition of the tenants, with 
their moderate farms, and plain manner of life, is perhaps as 
happy as any to be met with. 

The Scottifh plough, drawn by 3 or 4 horfes, is generally 
ufed in this heavy foil ; lighter ploughs, drawn by 2 horfes, 
being only applied to the latter plowings of fallows.

This parifh is indebted to its late proprietor for another 
important improvement. All along the high ways, he gr.ve 
Icafes and feus of fpots ot little value, for building. On 
thefe there are now upwards of 50 handfomc cottages '..tdi- 
ed, filled with induftrious inhabitants, having neat little kit- 
chen gardens around them ; by which he not only improved 
and beautified his own eftate, but fet an example, which has 
fince been followed by others. 

Produce. — ^The land here produces principally wheat, 
beans, peafe, oats, butter, cheefe, and hay from artificial 
grafles. There is not much barley cultivated here ; and, 
from the ftrength of the land, flax and turnips are not raifed 
without much trouble, and the return is uncertain. All the 
inhabitants cultivate potatoes for domeftic ufe. The average 
quantity of wheat fold, may be about 500 bolls a year, each 
boll being a little more than 4 Winchefl:er bufliels. Before 
this year, there have not been good crops of peafe and beans 
for feveral years paft ; but in tolerable feafons there may be 
about 600 bolls fold annually. There is generally alfo a con- 
fiderable quantity of oat meal fold out of the parifh, befides 
what is confumed at home ; fo that the produce exceeds the 
confumption of the inhabitants. The hay, butter, and 
cheefe is mofily fold to Glafgow, and the quantity of hay is 
fome years confiderable ; but it is difiicult to form an average 
of it. 

It has been already obferved, that trees of all kinds fuc- 
ceed well in this parifh. The Weymouth pine has come to 
a great fize in fheltered places. The balfam and berry-bear- 
ing poplars feem alfo to thrive greatly. Thorn hedges, on 
the moft fliff and flerile parts, grow ftunted a little, after a 

few 



fif DalzieL 



few years ; but in general thrive better here, than in much of 
the clay foil in the neighbourhood. 

Cattle. There are about 66 labouring horfes in the parifh, 

befides a few young ones, and about 200 milk cows, the 
young ones of which, annually reared, may be between 40 
and 50. Few fiaeep are reared in the parifh ; but in the parks 
around the manor houfe, there are always a number fed for 
{laughter, and no where is better mutton to be found. It 
deferves here to be remarked, that an experiment was made 
a, few years ago, of fmearing fome of thefe fheep with tar. 
But it feems, in thefe warm flieltered fields, it was improper 
to continue fuch a prad\ice, the fineared fheep turning out 
inferior both in mutton and wool. As this experiment, how- 
ever, was never repeated, it is doubtful if it ought to be laid, 
down as a general rule. 

Fi^. — The proprietor has a falmon fifhing on the river 
Clyde^ of which he avails himfelf only for family ufe, giving 
away, to friends and neighbours, what flfh are caught more 
than necefTary for his own table. The other fifh found in 
the river, befides falmon and their progeny of grauls, fry, 
and pars, are trouts, lampreys, filvcr eels, pike, perch, roach, 
minnows, and a few horfe or pearl mufTels. In the river Cal- 
der, near its mouth, falmon are alfo found, and farther up, a 
good deal of fmall trouts, filver eels, &amp;c. 

Roads and Bridges. — A turnpike road, from Lanark to 
Glafgow, runs, from fouth eafl to north wefl, through the 
parifli J and upon the weft boundary, there is a bridge over 
the Calder. The turnpike road from Edinburgh, through 
Hamilton, which crofTes this parifla from north eafl to fouth 
weft, enters it by another bridge over the fame river. Be- 
fides 



4^4 Statijlical Account 

fides the Roman bridge above mentioned, there is fllll an- 
other bridge over the Calder, upon a lefs public road. 

Climaie, ^ c. — ^The air here is pretty dry and clear, fogs 
of any continuance never being remembered, except in the 
year 1783: It is mild, compared with that on the higher 
lands around, and furely very healthy, no difeafe being preva- 
lent but fevers and the fmalLpox, at diftant periods. Agues 
are not known here. Inoculation for the fmall pox has not 
taken place. It is not uncommon to find people arrived at 
the age of 80 and upwards. There are at prefent 2 perfons 
of one family, whofe ages together make 179; and fome 
years ago, there were 3 more perf ns of the fame family 
alive; when the ages of the 5 were added, the fum was 387. 
It was well afcertamed, that William Morton, an old fervant 
about the houfe of Dalziel, who died there within thefe 16 
years, was at leaft 104. 

Minerals. — Large beds of excellent pit coal have been 
found in this parifli, lying at difi^erent diftances under one 
another, which are believed to be continued under the great- 
eft part of it ; but none of them are wrought at prefent, as 
coal" is cheap and plenty in the neighbourhood. Free ftone 
quarries, of a good quality, abound here ; in one of them there 
is a ftratum which produces good mill ftones for making pearl 
barley, fome of which are carried to a great diftance. 

Population. — -The population of this parifh is confiderably 
increafed of late, owing to the number of new cottages be- 
fore mentioned. Thefe are not collected into a village, but 
ftand detached along the road. In two places only there are 
clufters nearly together, which may be called fmall villages, 
there being 15 houfes in the one, and 12 in the other. The

All the women were formerly employed in fpinning fine 
yarn, except when occupied in the difirerent offices of huf. 
bandry, which fall to the fhare of that fex ; but of late the 
young girls belonging to the cottages have learned to flower 
niuflin, in large frames made for the purpofe, which they 
find more profitable. The greateft luxury which prevails 
among them, is drinking tea and fmoaking tobacco, in which 
they all indulge. Their drefs is alfo more fliowy and ex- 
penfive than formerly.

{County of Forfar.') 

By the Rev. Mr RiCHARD WaTSONj </head>

<p>NariiSf Situation, Extent, tsfc. 

ARBHILOT is termed, in old writings, Aberelliot. The 
name feems to be of Gaelic oiriginal, in which lan- 
guage aher fignifies above, and Elliot is the name of the waten 
Aberelliot, therefore, is expreflive of the local fituation of 
the village. The parifti of Arbirlot lies in the county of 
Forfar, in the prefbytery of Aberbrothock, and fynod of 
Angus and Mearns. It is about 4 miles in length, and 3 irv 
breadth. The extent of fea coaft is about 3 miles, and, for 
the moft part, flat and fandy. 

./}. 

Soil and Clinjate.—'The greater part of this parifli is hilly ; _ 
yet the hills arc neither very high nor rocky. They are iri 
general green, and capable of cultivation. 'J'he air is con- 
fidered as healthy, and there are no peculiar difeafes. The 
foil is various. Along the coaft there is a thin dry foilj 
which, in a wet feafon, yields a tolerable crop but in a dry 
feafon, a very fcanty one. The foil, contiguous to this, con- 
fifts of a light rioh loam, on a gravelly bottom, which be- 
comes fertile in proportion to the feafon, and the care bev 
flowed on its cultivation. In fields adjoining to each others 



463 



Statl/lical Accotini 



we have foils very different ; fome fhallow, others deep. The 
deep foils have generally an under ftratum of clay, which ren^ 
ders them hard to plough ; but when proper care is taken of 
their cuhiire, and the feafon favourable, they produce weigh- 
ty crops. In the hilly parts of the parifh, there are various 
qualities of foil, fome cold and wet, fome moorifli and fpon- 
gy, lome dry and gravelly. In a word, the variety of foil is 
fo great, that often, in the fame field, different foils are to 
be found. This- inequality of foils, which, at firft fight, 
feems a defeft, is in reality a remarkable proof of the wifdom 
of providence ; for there is no foil fo ungrateful, as not to 
reward the labourer's toil, if he will only beftow proper care 
on its culture, and each foil has a feafon, in which it is pecu- 
liarly produdtive. The ground, in this parifh, has, for the moft 
part, a good expolure, and grows fruitful, in proportion to 
its rtate of cultivation. This has encouraged the farmers of 
late years to improve tracts of it, which formerly lay wafte 
and uncultivated. 

Agriculture atul Produce. — Such of the tenants as border 
on the Ihore, ufe fea ware for manure. But the principal 
manure here ufed is lime, which is brought partly from the 
Frith of Forth, and partly from Sunderland in England, at 
a very conf'ierable expence ; yet the farmers value it fo 
much, that they look upon it as an eflential requifite in cai% 
rying forward their improvements. 7 he times of plowing, 
fowing, and reaping, are determined by the feafons, and the 
general rules laid down by the moft experienced farmers. 
The principal crops raifed in this parifh are oats and barley. 
Of the former there is onjy a fmall quantity, but of the 
latter a great deal is annually exported. Of late years, a con- 
fiderable quantity of wheat and turnips has been fown, and, 
in general, fucceeded well. For fome years paft, the farmers 
have paid due attention to the raifing of flax i and, from the 

premiums 



ef ArhlrloU 



4% 



premuims they have received, it appears that their labour 
lias not been in vain. In the year 1790, there were 97 acres 
of ground, within the bounds of this parifh, (own with lint- 
feed, which in general fucceeded well, and procured the pre- 
miums given by the Society for raifing of flax in this county. 
There are from 40 to 50 ploughs in this parifli, of different 
couiftruc^ions. Some of them are drawn by 4 horfes, and 
others by 2. When 4 horfes are yoked, 2 fervants are re- 
quifite ; but when two do the work, one man is fufiicient, as 
he both holds the plough, and drives the horfes. This laft 
mode of plowing has been introduced, partly from the im- 
proved ftate of the farm, and partly from the increafe of 
fervants wages. It will be admitted by the candid, that im- 
provements in hufbandry, as in the fine arts, arrive at matu- 
rity by degrees. Encouraged by fuccefs, the farmers in this 
parifli have, within thefe 20 years, made rapid progrefs ia 
the cultivation of their lands. And as their farms arc not 
ove»- rented, they are enabled to go on with their improve- 
nients. 



Cattle. — It may not be improper to obferve, that great at- 
tention is paid to the breeding of cattle ; but little to the 
feeding of them. They are, for the moft part, brought to 
the market about 3 years of age. There is only one grazier 
in the parifli. It is remarkable, that there is not within the 
bounds of this parifli one flock of fheep, efpecially when we 
confider, that the greater part of it is hilly. Perhaps the pe- 
riod isnotfardiftant, when the farmers may fee their interefl: 
in this particular, and take the benefit which their local fitu- 
ation evidently points out. 

Wages, — The yearly wages of men fervants, in th« diffe- 
rent branches of hufljandi^, are from 7 1. to 8 1. Sterling ; 

and 



Statl/tical Account 



and of women fervants, from 3 1. to 4 1. Sterling, including 
the perquifites. The wages of a day labourer arc 6 d. when 
the employer furniflies him with provifions. But when the 
labourer viftuals himfelf, his wages are from x s. to 15 d. per 
day. 

Population, — ^The return to the Inquiry made by Dr "Web- 
fter, in 17551 refpefting the population of this parifh, was 
865. No particular enumeration has been made fince that 
period, until about 12 months ago, (September 1790), when 
an exatt lift of the inhabitants was made up ; and their 
number amounted to 1055 of whom there were 550 males, 
and .505 females. By a regifter, well attefted, it appear?, 
that the marriages, births, and deaths in this parifh, from 
the beginning of the year 1780, to the end of the year 1799, 
were as follows :

The above account of births, correfponds with an obferva- 
tion made by the Baron de Montefquieu, in his Spirit of Laws, 
that there are born, in feveral parts of Europe, more boys 
than girls. 

ManufaSfures.—Tht Inhabitants of this parifli enjoy the 
advantages of raifing, watering, dreffing, and fpinning of 
flax, in a high degree, which might furely be an objeft of 
great importance, both to flax dealers and manufacturers ; 
though, as yet, there is no eftabliftied linen manufadtory in 
the parifh. For fome years paft, there has been a fmall 
brick-work carried onj but it does not appear, that this 
branch of manufadure has either enriched its proprietors, or 
much benefited the parifhioners. Several houfes have been 
built within thefe laft i o years for tradefmen, efpecially wea- 
vers, who have met with due encouragement from the far- 
mers. They are allowed a piece of ground nigh to their 
houfes, on reafonable terms ; and are bound to perform no 
fervices, except a few day's labour, at different feafons of the 
year, during which time they receive, from their refpeftive 
mafters, 6 d. per day, and their vidtuals. It is probable that 
thefe pcrfons, from their induftry, economy, and attention to 
bufinefs, will increafe the produce, the wealth, and the po- 
pVilation of the parifli. There is one brewer in this parifli, 
and 4 perfons who fell ale and fpirituous liquors, and are known 
by the name of tapjlers. Thefe alehoufes arc rather for the 
accommodation of ftrangers, than for the ufe of the pariflii- 
oners, who look upon idlenefs, debauchery, and intemperance, 
as the principal fources of human mifery. 

Fuel. — The fuel, commonly ufed by the inhabitants in the 
U)wer part of the parifli is coal, and by thofe in the higher 
part, peats and turf» 

Roads 



Siati/lkal Accmnt 



Roads cuid Bridges. ^Hlxt bridges in the parifh are good. 
The roads were exceeding badj but have been altered for the 
better within the laft two years ; and at prefent there are fe- 
veral favourable circumftances, which induce us to hope, that 
they will foon be repaired to our wifhes. By a late acT: of 
Parliament, the ftatute labour has been commuted ; and the 
converfion money raifed in this parifli has been laid out by 
the gentlemen of the diftrift to great advantage. Being fur- 
nifhed with every qualification requifite for the improvement 
of the roads, we may juftly be confident, that they will take 
the moft effe£lual raeafures in order to complete a fcheme, fo 
confonant to friendly intercourfe, fympathetic aid, and iound 
policy. A turnpike road is now making between Dundee 
and Arbroath, which runs through this parifli ; and though 
the tolls charged are confiderable, yet the advantages are 
fo vifible, both in ipeculation and in faft, that very much good 
is expelled from it. 

River and Fijh. — The water Elliot, which runs through 
this parifti, from north to fouth, hath its fource in the parifh 
of Carmylie, about the diftance of 3 miles from the town of 
Arbirlot. It was noted, fome time paft, for trouts of a pe- 
culiar reUfh. At prefent there are very few in the water. 
It may be obferved^ that our young men, inflead of ufing the 
well diflembled fly to catch the finny race, have of late tried 
the gun to kill the fpringing game. This new falhion will, pro- 
bably, foon be over. For fome years paft, there has been, at 
the mouth of the Elliot, a falmon fifliery ; but, either through 
the negligence of the perlon who has the management, or 
from the different run which that fpecies of fifli have taken, 
very few are caught. By the variety of trees and flirubs on 
the banks of Elliot, which invite the feveral kinds of fing- 
ing birds, and the Caflle of Kelly, built upon a rock, by the

T^ater edge, though in a half ruined ftate, a very beautiful 
and delightful romantic fcene is formed, which is to be feen 
to great ''advantage on the road betwixt Arbroath and Arbir- 
lot. The Elliot is not only an objea of beauty, but of uti- 
lity. There are 5 mills upon it ; one for cleaning flax, an- 
other for dreffing yarn, and 3 for grinding corn. A few 
years ago, the greateft part of this pariHi was under thirlage 
to fome of the corn mills in the neighbourhood, and payed 
a very high multure. But the prefent tenants, defirous of 
obtaining freedom from this thraldom, agreed among them- 
felves to pay the rents of the feveral mills to which they 
were thirled j and the late fa£lor or fteward on the eflate of 
Panmure accepted of their propofal ; in confequence whereof, 
they can carry their corn to any mill they pkafe. 

Heritor and Rent. — The whole parilh of Arbirlot, at pre- 
fent, is the property of the Hon. William Maule, brother of 
the Earl of Dalboufie, by a deed of the late William Maule, 
Earl Panmure. The valued rent is 4266 1. 13 s- 4d. Scotch. 
The real rent is 22 bolls 2 pecks wheat, 454 bolls bear, 519 
bolls 8 pecks meal, and 935 1. 1 1 s. 5 d. Sterling. The rent 
paid by the tenants varies from 5 s. to 30 s. per acre. But 
ground, in proper culture for flax, is frequently let for one 
crop, by the farmer, at 5 guineas the acre. There are in- 
flances of individuals renting lands, formerly pofleircd by 
feveral tenants, and of removing thofe people known by the 
name of cottagers ; but whether this has turned out to the 
advantage or difadvantage of the farmer, is doubtful. 

Church. — The living confifls of 57 bolls 4 pecks meal, 
Linlithgow meafure, 44 bolls bear, lo bolls 12 pecks wheat, 
and 16 1. 6s. ii|d. In money, with the addition of a manfe, 
a garden, and a glebe of 4 acres. The value of the living,.

therefore, cannot jje eftimated above 85 1. Sterling a year. 
The King is patron. The kirk was repaired in the year 
1785, and the manfe in the year 1790. There are only a 
few Seceders in the parifli, and no Roman Catholics. 

School— "Iht parochial fchoolmafter has no legal falary 
paid him by the heritor. His income confifts of 8 bolls of 
meal, which was mortified in the year 1628, by Alexander 
Irvine of Drum, then proprietor of Kelly, in favour of the 
fchoolmafter of Arbirlot ; aricl confirmed by his fon. Sir 
Alexander Irvine, Knight, in the year 1637 j and 5 bolls 8 
pecks of oats, collected from the leveral tenants in the parifli, 
at the rate of 2 pecks for each plough i which, together with 
a houfe, garden, feffion-clerk's dues, and fchopl fees, may be 
eftimated about 20 1. Sterling per annum. The number of 
children, educated at this fchool, varies according to the dif- 
ferent leafons of the year. In winter, they may be reckon- 
ed from 40 to 50; in fummer, from 30 to 40 ; in fpring 
and autumn, from 20 to 30. The preft^ytery have appoint- 
ed every parochial fchool, within their bounds, to be exa- 
mined once a year, by a committee of their number. 

Poor, — The poor, being few in number, are tolerably Well 
provided for. In the year 1629, Alexander Irvine of Drum, a 
gentleman of fortune, then proprietor of Kelly, mortified 12 
bolls of meal to the poor in the lands of Kelly, which have 
been of very great advantage to indigent perfons in that part 
of the parilh, efpecially in the year's 1782 and 1783. There 
are, befides, of certain annual income, 10 1. Sterling, belong- 
ing to the poor's fund, being the intereft of 4000 raerks, 
lent at 4 1 per cent, which, together with the coUeflions in 
the church on Sundays, and at the celebration of the Lord's 
(upper, produce about 35 1. Sterling a year.— -The diftribu- 
' tioi^

\\on of this money is confidcred as a branch of duty belong- 
Jng to the minifter and kirk elders, who meet at various times 
in the year for that purpofe. Part of it is employed in buy- 
ing coals, coats, and (hoes, for indigent perfons in the winter 
feafon ; part in fupplying thofe who need a certain weekly, 
monthly, or quarterly allowance, according to their neceffi- 
ties; part in teaching poor children of the parifti; and part, 
in relieving fuch other occafional objects of compaffion as 
make application to them. Of all thefe difburfements an 
exa£t account is kept, for the fatisfadlion of every fair inqui- 
rer who is entitled to afk it. As the kirk feffion has ad- 
vantages, both for knowing and fupplying the wants of the 
jpoor, fo its members are extremely attentive to diftribute to 
(every one according to his exigencies, infomuch that there is 
not at prefent one beggar belonging to this parifh. Vagrants, 
however, to whom begging is fweet, infeft it from week to 
week, and from day to day, through the revolving year. It 
were to be wifhed, that work hoiifes, in eVery county, were 
ierefted for the diflblute and idle. 

Longevity. — ^We have feveral inftances of great longevity. 
There was a man in this parifh, who died a feVv months ago, 
at the advanced age of 99. About eight days previous to his 
death, he feemed to have loft all his fenfes ; he neither favv, 
heard, fpoke, felt, nor moved ; but received food, when it 
Was put into his mouth. 

Mineral W a/fr/.— Propitious nature has kindly provided 
feveral mineral fprings near Arbirlot, one of which had a 
high charadler fome years ago } and it is to be tegreted, that 
for want of proper accommodation, perfons of high rank 
have declined coming to it. The well is about half a mile 
diftant from Arbirlot, and not exceeding 100 yards from the 

high 



47^ Siatj/lical Account 

high road betwixt Arbroath and Dundee. It is called Wor^ 
my-h'tlls W '.II, probably from the formation of the hills about 
)t, which very much refemble worms, efpecially when they 
twift themfelves. The water of this well has been ufed 
with fuccefs, both in fcorbutic, and in rheumatic dlforders. 
It is defervedly efteemed on account of its medicinal virtue ; 
and being within 200 yards of the fea, perfons attending it 
have the benefit of fea bathing, which, of late years, has 
been much recommended by our beft phyficians. 

Antiquities. — A few years ago, the remains of a religious 
houfe in the parifh, whofe ruins had been revered for ages, 
were taken down. And though we cannot fay at what time, 
or by what perfon, it was built, yet from the accounts given 
of it, we have reafon to believe, that it had been a Druidical 
temple. The province of the Druids, properly fo called, was 
religion ; yet they managed matters fo dextroufly, that they 
engrofled all power, civil as well as religious and under the 
charadler of either priefts, magiftrates, philofophers, or phy- 
ficians, took every thing under their cognizance. In ihis 
parifh, there are many heaps of ftones, which the people call 
cairns. But whether they were at firft defigned as monu- 
ments, raifed over the dead, or figns of memorable events, or 
altars of the druids, is uncertain. 

Among the Greeks, there were many heaps of ftones, con- 
fecrated to Mercury ; and among the Latins, there were num- 
berlefs rude pillars, confecrated to the fame divinity, under 
the denomination of Faunus. It is alfo certain, that in Gaul 
jmd Britain, there were many heaps and pillars exactly fimi- 
Jar to thefe. But we cannot affirm, that the natives of this 
country performed any religious ceremonies on thefe cairns, or 
confidered them in any other point of view, than as objects of 

grateful

grafefui remembrance, of mutual confidence, and of future 
fame. 

It is reported, with much confidence, that a crown of 
one of the kings of the Pi6ls, was found in the Black-den 
of this parifti, by a quarryman, about the beginning of the 
prefent century, who fold part of it in the neighbourhood, 
for 20 1. Scotch 'i and fent the remainder to London, with a 
•view to procure its real value. But by fome unforefeen oc- 
currence, he and his family were prevented from reaping 
that advantage, which might have been expefted from fo va- 
luable a curiofity. — It is confidentially reported, that a road 
■was made through part of this parifh, by Heftor Boethius, 
the Scotch .hiftorian, which ftill bears his name, though 
ibmewhat corrupted. It is called Heckenbois-path^ 

Cajlle of Kelly. — Neither the period vs^hen the Caftle of 
Kelly was built, nor the proprietors, through a long feries of 
ages, can now be traced. Tradition, however, has handed 
down a circumftance, which deferves notice, viz. that one 
Ouchterlony, laird of Kelly, was violently aftive in demo- 
lifhing the Abbey at Aberbrothock. Nor is it unlikely that 
he confidered every religious fabric as a relidt of idolatry. 
And being remarkable for the activity of his zeal, he was 
appointed by the Convention to carry this barbarous deed 
into execution. — To defcribe, at large, the beautie* of Kelly, 
and do jufticc to Nature's varied charms, would require un- 
common defcriptive powers. The foil docs not refufe nou- 
riftiment to trees of foreign birth. At prefent there is in 
the garden, a tree called the Dall-howid-holly^ remarkable for 
its beauty. Then expofed to the fun, and fheltered from the 
chilly blaft, it has grown up to full maturity. 



Migralor^

. Migraiory Birds. — The migratory birds are the fwallow, 
the cuckoo, the lapwing, the dotterel, and corn-cralck or 
rail. The fea-gulls are confidered as ominous. When they 
appear in the fields, a ftorm from the fouth-eaft generally 
follows ; and when the ftorm begins to abate, they fly back 
to the fhore. 

General CharaBer. — The inhabitants of this parifli are fd- 
ber, induftrious, and regular in their attendance on the ordi- 
nances of religion. Senfible of the advantages which they 
enjoy, both of a civil and religious nature, they wifti to re- 
lieve the miferies, and promote the happinefs of their fellow 
Creatures. They are juft in their dealings, true to their 
promifes, liberal to the poor, and mutually helpful to one 
another.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1924131">DORES</name>, 

{ County of Invernefs. ) 
the Rev. Mr Jqhn M'-Kilican.</head>


<p>Name, Situation, and Extent. 

DORES, artieritly called Durris, is fuppofed to be deriv-j 
ed from the compound word in the Gaelic language, 
Tur-ri-i/h, which, tranflated into Englifli, fignifies, a rijtng^ 
ground near a ivater. Such a rifing ground there is in the 
parifli, whofe lides are wafhed by Lochnefs. It lies within 
the county and prefbytery of Invernefs, and fynod of Moray ; 
and is about 20 miles in length, and 3 or 4 in breadth, 

5c// and Climate.-^The foil js generally light, but not much 
cultivated, as the grpund is occupied by a number of fmall 
tenants, who have but fhort leafes of their farms, and con- 
fequently no encouragement to improve them, either for 
their own or their mafters advantage. The mountains, which 
inclofe the valley on the north and fouth, prote£t it from all 
winds, except thofe from the weft and eaft 5 whereby, in hot 
feafons, the fummer heat is increafed fo much, that the corn 
and grafs would be in danger of being quite parched, were 
it not for the night dews, that frequently fall in great quan- 
tities. In the high grpund there are feveral lakes and moun- 
tains, to the extent of which the arable land bears but a 

very 



Staii/ikal Account 



very fmall proportion. The foil, in fome of thefe, has 
greatly the advantage over that of the low ground, and is 
very productive in feafons free from froft, or much rain. 
The pariQi, in general, though better calculated for paftu- 
rage than for raifing corn, produces as mtich grain as is fuffi- 
cient for the fubfiftence of its inhabitants. The air is efteem^. 
cd falubrious, and many live to a good age, though there are 
no inftances of great longevity. There are, however, in the 
neighbourhood, 3 men and their wives, whofe ages, addecj 
together, amount to 510 years. 

Cultivation and Produce, — The crops chiefly produced here 
are oats, barley, and potatoes, on the latter of which the 
poorer fort chiefly depend for fubfiftence. The new mode 
of farming can hardly be faid to be introduced into this pa- 
rifl3, except at Gortuleg, the property of James Frafer, Efqj 
writer to the fignet, who fpares no pains nor expence to im- 
prove it. His tenants have alfo got good leafes ; and his pa- 
triotic example, in both thefe refpefts, is deferying of imita- 
tion. The feafon of fowing oats is from the 20th of March to 
the middle of April. The fowing of barley begins about the 
1 2th May, and continues to the end of that month. The 
reaping of the crop, unlefs the feafon is wet and cold, as 
happened laft year, is from the beginning of September tQ 
the middle of October, 

Wages, — Male fervants receive from 3 1. to 5 1. Sterling 
per annum : and the females from 30 s. to 35 s. There arc 
few day labourers, (as many of the young lads go out of the 
county for work, in the fummer and harveft), which obliges 
the tenants to keep more domeftic fervants, efpecially in har- 
veft, than their farms can well afibrd to fupport. On this 
account, more than from unfkilfulnefs in hufbandry, fome 

difcover 



of Dores, 



dlkovtr an inclination to abandon tillage, and throw their 
lands into pafturage. A married fervant, with 3 or 4 chil- 
dren, if he and his wife are fober and iuduftrious, can live 
more comfortably than many of the farmers. Befides his 
wages, he has ground from his mafter for planting as many 
potatoes as he can gather manure fit to raife them. Tradef. 
men, fuch as mafons, wrights, taylors, &amp;c. unlefs they work 
by the piece, are allowed 18 d. a day, or is. and their 
maintainance. Day labourers, employed in cafting peats, xc- 
celve 9 d. a man, and 6 d. a woman. 

Population. — The population, of late years, if a ccnclufion 
may be drawn from the births entered in the parifh regifter, 
has rather decreafed. By a furvey lately taken, (in April 
1791), the number of fouls amounted to 1365; of whom 
610 were males, and 755 females. The return to Dr Web- 
fter, in 1755, was 1520. There appears to be, therefore, a 
decreafe, on the whole, of 155. The births and marriages, 
for the laft 10 years, as recorded in the parifli regifter, are as 
follows :

Statlftical Account 



Heritors. — There are 8 heritors, only one of whom, viz, 
Mr Frazer of Gortuleg, occafionally rcfides in the parifli. 
The non-refidence of heritors may, in the opinion of fome, 
be an advantage, as hereby that degree of luxury is prevent- 
ed, which excites particular pcrfons to aim at making a 
iiigher figure than is confiftent with their circumftanccs ; but 
perhaps it would be for the general good of the tenants, that 
they were like a family, under the immediate eye and obfer- 
vation of their mafter, fo that his care might extend, as much 
as poffible, to every individual refiding upon his property. 
Indeed while the rents and produce of almoft all the eflates 
in a parifh are fpent out of it, no great improvement can be 
cxpedled to take place. 

Roads. — The roads of communication are properly attended 
to by the gentlemen concerned, and annually repaired. The 
ftatute labour is converted into money. The fherifF of the 
county, who is an heritor, takes an a£live concern in every 
thing that regards the police of the county in general, and of 
this parilh in particular. He is ever labouring at the fuppref- 
lion of vices in general, efpecially fuch as are the moft likely 
to affect the welfare of the community. 

Church and School.— The ftipend is 40 1. Sterling, and 3 
clialders of visual, half bea», half meal. It has not been 
augmented fince the year 1740. The glebe contains exadly 
4 acres. The manfe was built upwards of 50 years ago, and 
has fince undergone various reparations. — The parochial 
fchool is far from being in a flourifliing condition. The 
number of fcholars has not, at any time, at leaft fince the 
admiffion of the prefent incumbent, in 1785, exceeded 20. 
The falary is only ico merks. ^

Poor. There are 60 on the poor's roll ; but there is no 

fund eftablifhed, as the law direfts, by aflefTment on the land- 
ed property, for their maintenance. Tiie only parochial fund 
for their relief, is the annual intereft arifing from 70 1. Ster- 
ling, mortified by gentlemen who were heritors of the pariflj, 
and the weekly colkclions at the church, which amount to a- 
bout 4 1. a year. The poor here, as is the cafe with moft 
of the poor in the northern counties of Scotland, aflc 
alms, not only at the dwelling houfes of the inhabitants of 
their own, but of other parilhes. It is much to be wiflied, that 
every parifh would enter into a refolution to obferve the law 
for maintaining their own poor, when they cannot work, as 
vagrants and flurdy beggars, who are the pefls of fociety, and 
may well be called the public robbers of the poor, would 
thus be effedtuallj detefted and difcountenanced. 

ifl^fj-.— "Lochnefs and its environs furnifli excellent mate- 
rials for a beautiful landfcape. It lies E. N. E. and W. Si 
W. and is 22 miles in length, and from i to 2| in breadth. 
The depth, in the middle, is from 60 to 135 fathoms. The 
flowing, occaiioned by continued rains, and melting of fnow, 
is from 8 to 10 feet perpendicular from the low water mark. 
The loch is fo deep at the fides, that, except at the points of 
Torr and Foyers, a fhip of the line might fail within her 
length of the fhore, from end to end, on either fide. The 
wind being confined, by the great height of the hills, on both 
fides, as it were in a funnel, blows almoft always either 
ftreight up or down the loch, a circumftance much againft 
the navigation of it ; as is Ukewife that of the heavy fqualls 
which blow from all the glens and gullies^ when the wind 
inclines either to the north or fouth. A decked vefiel may- 
turn to windward, from one end to the other, in moderate 
weather in 3 days, but muft anchor every night. There is 

goad 



484 



Stalijlical Account 



good anclioring ground at both ends, and at Urquhart 
Bay, Alt Say, and Port CJair, on the north fide ; and Inver- 
farigach and Foyers on the louth. There is alfo a fafe creek 
at the Horfe Shoe. 

The lake never freezes, which is fuppofed to be owing to 
its great depth, and fulphureous bottom ; and the high hills, 
with which it is inclofed on the fouth and north, prefent to 
one failing on the lake, a pleaiant view of wood, pafture, rivers 
and rivulets, corn fields, broken fleeps, and irregular preci_ 
pices. In this large body of water there are many trouts of 
3 or 4 pounds weight, and fome falmon, which pafs the 
cruives in the river Ne{s, when it is high. There is no re- 
gular falmon fifhing on the lake, as the cxpence of filhing, 
on an average, exceeded the profits. Fort Auguftus, which 
lies at the farther extremity of the lake, is well fituated for 
?.n woollen manufacture, as it is in the mouth of the High- 
lands, where many, who were diftrefled by the extenfion of 
flieep farms, ftiil continue to refide, from an invincible at- 
tachment to their native country, though they have fcarce 
luiTicient cmplovment to maintain them. There are feveral 
other lakes, befides Lochnefs, in this parifli, which abound 
with fmall trout ; but the inhabitants near them filli more for 
their amufement than for fubfifience, and never for fale. It 
is remarkable, that one of thefe lakes never freezes in winter, 
but frequently does in (pring. 

Wood ami Jnhmls.—Thtrc are feveral extenfive fir plan- 
tations in the parilh, which are in a thriving condition, and 
conveniently fituated for the market.— Befides the common 
imimals for domefcic ufe, there are deer, roes, badgers, 
foxes, hares, pole-cats, wild- cats, and wealels.

Ant'iquiiies At the diftance of 3 miles from the lake, are 

to be feen the veftiges of a fort, called Cafial Dunriachati^ 
which fome reckon a corruption of Cajlal Dun Ri-chuan^ or 
the Caftle of the King of the Ocean, a name which it is fuppo- 
fed to have got, at the period when the king of Norway 
and Denmark was mafter of the fea. A little to the eaft of 
that fort, there are feveral cairns or heaps of ftones, and one al- 
moft equal in fize to all the reft. Tradition reports that 
Fin GAL, fo much celebrated in Offian's poems, here engag- 
ed in battle Afiiy the fon of the Norwegian king, and killed 
him, which gave the name of Druma/Jji, or AJJji^s Hill, to 
the fcene where this event happened. The inhabitants 
point out the chair where Fingal refted on the occafion, and 
which is ftill called Sheir Finn, or Fingal's Chair. About 9 
miles diftant there is another fort called Dundardell, which, 
is faid to have been one of the many forts in the great val- 
ley, extending from the German Ocean at Inverncfs, to the 
Atlantic at Fort William, that were intended for making 
fignals, by fire, of the enemy's approach, during the times of 
the Danifh and Norwegian incurfions ; and indeed they are 
fo fituated, with refpedl: to each other, as to be very well cal- 
culated for fuch a purpofe.

General CharaHer, — The people, in general, are fober, 
quiet, and induftrious. There are, however, fome exceptions. 
The tenants would be better pleafed with their condition, if 
they obtained longer lenfes than are commonly granted them, 
and their fervants were more moderate in regard to wages.

NUMBER LXIX. 
PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1012333">AIRTH</name>. 
(County of Stirling.) 
By the Rev. Mr Robert Ure. </head>

<p>Origin of the Name. 

THE name j^irth, is of Gaelic extra£lionj and is derived 
from the word ard or ardhe, which, in that language^ 
jSgnifies a high or eminent place. Probably it bears that 
name, becaufe the hill of Airth, on the fouth-eaft corner of 
which the church and manfion houfe are built, rifes confi- 
derably higher than the grounds immediately adjacent. The 
perpendicular height of this hill is upwards of 70 feet. 
From the manfion houfe of Airth, and every part of the 
Hill, there is a delightful and extenfive profpedl, over a coun* 
try rich, populous, and beautifully diverfified. In this prof- 
pcft, part of I o or a 2 counties are to he feen. 

Situation and Extent. — Airth lies in the county and prefby- 
tcry of Stirling, and in the fynod of Perth and Stirling^ 
The extent of the parifh, upon the fide of the river, is about 
6 miles, its medium length 5, and its breadth fully 2 miles. 
The figure is irregular, and approaches neareft to the parallel- 
logram. The whole parifh is a plain, the hills of Airth and 
Dunmore excepted. This laft hill is termed, by fome wri- 
ters, Airth'begi or Little Airth, 

Soil. 



of Airth,

Soil. — The foil is, in general, a ftrong deep clay, but the 
Hill of Airth is a very rich mould. It is believed, a great part 
of the low ground, near the river, once made part of its bed, 
as many fea fhells are mingled with the earth ; and a few- 
years ago, an anchor was found upon Dunmore hill, by 
the Earl of Dunmore, about half a mile from the prcfent 
courfe of the river, when digging a few feet below the fur- 
face. At a fmall diftance from the fame place, there is a 
large ftone, called Carling Stones to which the cables of ihips 
are fuppofed to have been faftened, and of which there are 
ftill evident marks. On the weft fide of the parifti, there 
are part of two molTes, called the Mofles of Dunmore and 
Letham. Within thefe 25 years, 100 acres of ground have 
been gained from that part of the Mofs of Dunmore which 
belongs to the Earl, and added to the arable land. Here 
are fettled 30 families, called Mofs Lairds^ as the ground 
is given them for a certain number of years, at a very low 
rent, in recompence for their labour in clearing away the 
mofs. The fettlers are induftrious and healthy. The mofs 
is from 5 to 10 feet deep, and when removed, the foil under 
it is not inferior to that of the neighbouring Carfe. 

Climate^ ^c. — The air is pretty dry, and free from fogs ; 
and, though mifts are frequently feen on the diftant hills 
and high grounds, yet they are fcldom experienced here. 
The people, in general, are healthy and laborious. The fea 
breezes, doubtlefs, contribute to the health of the inhabi- 
tants on the river fide. Though the people in the Carfe arc 
faid to be much fubje£l to the ague, of late years inftanccs 
of that difeafe have been few. 

Rivers and Fifh, — There is a fmall river, which runs 
through the parifli, from weft to eaft ; it takes its rife in St. 

Ninian's 



4B3 



Siatijiical Account 



Ninian's parlfli, and difcharges itfelf into the Forth, at Hig- 
giri's Neuck. Stream tides flow in this rivulet a mile or more 
from its mouth. In time of great rains, it overflows its 
banks ; if thefe fall in harvefl, it is hurtful to the farmers in 
its immediate neighbourhood. This fmall' river is between 
20 and 30 feet in breadth in many places, and has 5 ftone 
bridges over it. One of thefe is on the public road, leading 
from the villages of Dunip[iore and Airth, to Carron and Fal- 
kirk. It is called the Abbey- town Bridge, which name cor- 
roborates an opinion many have entertained, of there having 
been formerly an abbacy at Airth, belonging to the Abbey 
of Holyroodhoufe ; and that this bridge had that name, 
from its being the direft road to the abbey town. It alfo 
appears, from feveral old writs, that the parifli of Airth be- 
longed to the Bifliop of Edinburgh, during the times of 
Epifcopacy. The fifli caught in the river Forth are falmon, 
herrings, flounders, and trouts. Cod and turbot are alfo 
fometimes taken. Salmon are chiefly caught in July and 
Augufi:, with ftaff-nets, at the time of low water, and are all 
confumed by the parifliioners. Within thefe 25 years, 300 
acres have been gained from the river Forth, and made good 
arable ground. It is defended from the river by a ftrong 
dike of fods. 

HillSi Coal^ ^c. — The hills of Airth and Dunmore abound 
with free-ftone, and the rock, in many places, is within a 
few feet of the furfacc. The flones are ufed for building 
walls and houfes. There is a fine coal under the rock in 
both hills, and in the flat fields around. The greatefl: part 
of the level free coal of the former was wrought fome time 
ago j at prefent there is no work carrying on, although there 
is a great deal of coal ftill in the ground, which might be 
wrought to advantage. The latter, viz. Dunmore, has been 

wrought

wrought, to confiderable extent, for many years paft, and 
the work is nill carrying on. Tliis coal confifts of 3 or 4- 
-leams ; a great deal of the parifh, and adjacent places, arc 
Supplied from it, and a confiderable quantity is exported. 
The fire engine at thefe coal works, is the fecond that was 
built in Scotland. 

Ferries. There are two well known and much frequented 

ferries in the parifli, viz. the ferries of Kerfie and Higgin's 
Neuck. The former is about half a mile in breadth. The 
proprietor, John Francis Erlldne, Efq; of Mar, lately built 
a pier upon each fide of the river, which renders it commo- 
dious for pallengers, and all kinds of carriages, witli or with- 
out horles, either at high or low water. The latter, viz, 
Higgin's Neuck, is about a mile in breadth. There is a paf- 
fage boat once a day, from Airth and Dunmore to Alva, and 
the places oppofite ; its time of departure varies according to 
the tide. There are three harbours,, viz. Airth, Dunmore, 
and Newmiln, all of which are within the precin^ls of the 
cuftomhoufe at Alloa. At each of them vefTels are occa- 
fionally built. 

Wood. — There is a wood of confiderable extent upon the 
Hill of Dunmore, which confilts of birch, oak, a(h, elm, 
beech, and fir. On the fide of the hill, contiguous to the 
mofs, upwards of 40 acres have lately been planted with oaks 
and firs, moll: of which are at prefent in- a very thriving con- 
dition. There are a great number of fallow trees planted 
about many farmers houfes, and interfperfed through the 
fields, which add greatly to the beauty of the country.

Orchards,

Siati/lical Jccou,nt 



Orchards. — There are 9 in the parifli, which let annually at 
from 10 1. to 20 1. each. The fruits which they produce are,, 
apples, pears, cherries, a^id plumbs. 

The rents are paid chiefly in meal and barley, at 
the rate of 10 firlots per acre ; which, when converted, are, 
at an average, for the laft 20 years, from 1 1. 1 4 s. to i 1. 1 8 s. 
per acre, and upwards. When the rent is paid all in rrioney, 
it is from i 1. 14 s. to 2 1. 2 s. according to the quality of 
the foil. The valued rent of the parifli is 8638 1. 16s. 
Scotch. 

Farms. — The farms are moftly fmall j few exceed 50 or 
60 acres, and the greateft number are from 20 to 30. The 
farmers generally put 3 horfes into their ploughs ; but of 
late, the mode of ufing only 2 horfes, which are driven by 
the ploughman, has taken place, and, it is hoped, will foon 
univerfally prevail throughout the parifli. 

Produce, — The crops are wheat, barley, oats, beans, peafe, 
and potatoes. The wheat is fown after fallow or potatoes. 
Thofe who fow no wheat, divide their farms nearly into 3 
parts, one of which is fown with barley, another with pats, 
and a third with peafe and beans. Of thei? the barley crop 
is by far the molt expenfive, as it requires moft manure and 
labour I here is more grain produced in the parifli than is 
fufEcient to ^naintain its inhabitants. Mapy bolls of beans 
and peaie are lent to Falkirk every Thurfday, and fold there. 
Barley is fold to diltillers and brewers in the neighbouriiood ; 
but moft of the oatmeal is confumed in the parifh. 

Mode of Agriculture^ and Expence of Labour. — The barley 
^cl'ds muft be three times piovred. The firft plowing is in 

November, 



tj Airih. 



491 



f^ovember, the fecond in March, and the laft in the end of 
April or beginning of May. Previous to the laft, a quantity 
of lime and dung is fpread upon the fields. The efFefts of 
the lime are particularly beneHcial; in hard clay ground, it 
Separates the ftiff particles from each other j and, if the foil 
is foft and wet, it fucks up the exuberant moifture. The 
farmer fliould be very attentive, as to the time and manner 
of putting lime oh his barley fields. Perhaps the beft time 
is the beginning of November, when the ground fiiould be 
plowed with a very thin and flight farrow, as the lime natu- 
rally finks into it.. By its being put on at this feafon, the fa- 
line particles, and hot burning quality of the lime, are ab- 
forbed by the earth, and incorporated with it through the 
winter; whereas, if it be deferred till after the fecond or 
third plowing, little advantage is derived from it that feafon j 
and in cafe of much drought, it is often found to be hurtful. 
There is a prejudice entertained by many farmers, that lime 
is not beneficial to light fandy ground. This opinion may 
be prefumed to proceed from the want of a fair trial; for ic 
is well known, that lime incorporates with fand, and tends to 
confolidate its fmall particles, and to give the ground a pecu- 
liar ftrength and firmnefs. The farmers often roll their bar- 
ley fields with a heavy wooden or ftone roller : This, in a 
dry feafon, is of great ufej as it tends to preferve the moii- 
ture in the ground, and hinders the drought from penetrat- 
ing into it ; but if heavy rains fall foon after the rolling, it is 
necefiliry to open the furface with the harrow. It may be 
obferved, that the barley fown in April is the ftrongefl: grain ; 
but that fown in the middle of May is the moft prohfic. 
Beans and peafe are fown in the beginning of March, 
the oats immediately after. Ploughmen's wages, at prefent, 
are from 81. to 10 1. per annum. Thofe of fervant maids,

Popttlntkn. — The number of inhabitants, in 1755, was 
2316. The population has not fince decreafed. Ihe fami- 
lies in the parifli are 508 ; tliefe families, by the neareft com- 
putation, exceed 44^ iu each family at an average; and the whole 
population may be ftated at about 2350. The villagers are 
about I2C0; tradefmen and feamen about 140. The annual 
average of births, for the laft 10 years, is 66; of deaths, 54 j 
and of marriages, 20. 

Decline of Trade. — The trade tn Airth, prior to the year 
'745» ^^'''^ ^^^^ conliderable, but has fince been on the de- 
cline, owing to a number of vefTels being burnt at that pe- 
riod. The Qccafion of this was, that the rebels, having 
fei2ed a fmall veflel at a narrow part of the river, called Tal- 
lin, by means of it tranfported a number of fmall brafs can- 
non to the harbours of Airth and Dunmore, near each of 
which they ereded batteries, artd placed their cannon. Up- 
on the King's velTcls coming from Leith to diflodge them, a 
reciprocal firing took place. The commanders of the King's 
vefiels, finding their efforts ineffeftual, failed down the river 
with the tide, and gave orders to burn all the vefiels lying 
on the river fide, to prevent them falling into the hands of 
the rebels, who might have ufed them as tranfports, and har-. 
raffed the people on both fides of the river. The lofs of 
thefe veffels were feverely felt by the trading people iri Airth, 
and trade has fince removed to Carronlhore and Grange- 
mouth. 



Shippitig,

Shippifig. — There are at prefent 8 veflils belonging to tlio 
parifli. Some of thefe are employed in the Eahic, others in 
the coal and lime trade. 

Church and Schools. — The ftipend is 69 bolls of meal and 
barley, and about looo merks of money, with a manle, and 
glebe of 10 acres of good arable ground. The patron of the 
parifti is James Graham, Efq; of Airth — There is an efta- 
bhlhed fchool in it, and a fchoolinafter, who has a dwel- 
ling houfe and legal lalary allowed him by the heritors. 
The number of fcholars, taught in it, is between 70 and 80. 
There are fome other Ichools of leffer note ; but the mafters 
of thefe have no allowance, except what is given them by 
the parents of thofe children whom they inftrudl. 

Heritors. — There are 5 heritors, who refide conftantly or 
occafionally in the parifh, and 6 who do not refide in it. « 
Befides thefe, there are feveral leffer heritors and feuers. 

Poor. — The number of poor fupplled weekly is 30 ; and of 
occafional poor, there are about 1 2. They are fupplied by an 
annual aflelTment, which the heritors voluntarily impofe upon 
themfelves, the one half of which is paid by them, and th^ 
other by their tenants. By the intereft of money, the aflefl- 
ment, and the weekly colleftions, the fum given annually to 
the poor is between Sol. and 90 1. Sterlings 

Ant'tquities. — There are 3 antient towers in the parifh, one 
at Airth, another at Dunmore, and a third at Powfouls. The 
tower at Airth was built before Sir William Wallace's time, 
who lived at the beginning of the J4th century. If credit 
can be given to Blind Harry's poetical hiftory of that hero, 
he fays, that Wallace came privily into this tower, flew the

captain and leo men, and relieved his uncle, who was a pri- 
foner in it. This tower is in good repair ; it makes part of the 
houle of Airth, and bears the name of Wallace's Tower. 
The antiquity of the other two is not accurately afcertamed. 
In one of the aiiles of Airth church, belonging to the family 
of Airth, there is a black marble ftone built in the wall, with 
the Brucis arms elegantly engraved above it, bearing the 
following infer jption in very neat legible characters;

PARISH OF <name ref="NA">KINNELLAR</name>. 

(County of Aberdeen,") 
By the Rev. Mr Gavin Mitchell.</head>



<p>Situation and Extent. 

THE parlfli of Kinnellar is fituated in the prefbyterj^ 
fynod, and fhire of Aberdeen. It forms an area of 
4000 acres, and is of narrow extent ; confifting chiefly of an 
irregular aflemblage of hills, none of which, however, rife ta 
any confiderable elevation, or difplay any thing very wild or 
dreary in their afpeiSt. 

Soil and Cultivation. — The whole parifh is either a£luallv 
cultivated, or at leaft fufceptible of cultivation. Even the 
hills are partly cultivated, both upon the fides and the Turn- 
niit. Their tops are partly covered with thriving plantations 
of firs. In other places, where they produce heath, or a ftrong 
coarfe fpecies of grafs, they are ftill referved for pafture. 
The low ground dividing the hills, is, for the moft part, 
fwampy. The foil of the hills, wherever they difcover any 
appearance of heath, is warm, kindly, and, in fome degree, 
fandy. 

Cattle^ is'c. — Great numbers of flieep were formerly fed 
here ; but thefe have decreafed, and do not now exceed 447, 

more

xnore advantageous modes of farming having been introdu- 
tcd. Black cattle are more numerous, being at prefent nt 
fewer than 534; and even thefe are only the winter ttock, 
kept for labour, and for breeding. In fummer, many fields 
are rented by Grangers for grazing cattle, which they intro- 
duce from different places ; and even the farmers of the pa- 
rifti purchafe additional ftock, when the grafs fprings up. 
Thcfe are again fold off, as the year advances. Until Janua- 
ry, however, a number continue to be fed in the ftalls upon 
turnips, which are then alfo driven to Aberdeen, and there 
fold. Horfes are lefs numerous than they would be, if the 
practice of plowing with oxen did not prevail. Of thefej 
however, there are in the parifh 87. A few fwine are fed 
here; but the greater part are annually fattened, and killed, 
in December or January. In the beginning of fpring lypij 
there were 39 bee-hives in the parifti, which would, no 
doubt, produce many additional fwarms in the courfe of the 
fummer; 

Agriculture. — Agriculture has been gradually improved to 
a ftate of confiderable perfeflion. Grafs feeds had not beeri 
fown in this pariflij in ahy confiderable quantity, before the 
year 1750 ; till about that time they were not kept for falc 
by the merchants in Aberdeen, and confequently could not 
be much known among our farmers. The culture of tur- 
nips was equally unknown at the fettlemjent of the prefent in^. 
cumbent. A few only were raifed by fome gentlemen iii 
their gardens, for kitchen Ufe. In the year 1758, the mini- 
fter, unwilling to be at great pains in weeding a bed which 
he had fown in his gardeh, and which he did not expe£l td 
fucceed wellj tore out the greater part with a hoe, leaving 
only a few fcattered hisre dnd there upon the bed ; but was 
piuch furprifed, to find his crop of turnips turn out much 

VdLillli 3R fupcriof 



Staii/iical Accomi 



fiiperior to any of the fame plant, that he had evei' bcforft 
feen. After this, he continued to hoe and thin all his fub- 
lequent growths of turnips in the fame manner. In the next 
year, a neighbouring gentleman fowed fome turnips in a field, 
and although he did not ufe a hoe in weeding them, yet 
thinned them fo as to leave about a hand-^breadth of ground 
open around each plant. His crops anfwered equally well. 
In 1760 or 1761, the pradtice of hoeing was generally a- 
dopted, by all who fowed turnips through the parifli. The 
culture of this plant has, fince that time, become gradually 
more common j and it has contributed greatly to clear the 
ground of wild oats, and other weeds, which ufed before to 
choke the corn 5 and the turnips have been very profitably 
made ufe of, in feeding and fattening cattle. The intro- 
du6lion of grafs feeds has been no lefs favourable in its in- 
fluence upon agriculture. Before the ufe of thefe was 
known, thofe parts of our lands which were cultivated, were, 
(however much exhaufted), kept almoft continually in cropj 
the farmers being unwilling to fufi^er them to reft j becaufe, 
for the firft two years, fcarcely any other vegetable but the 
ft inking May weed appeared upon them. The conftant fuc- 
ccflion of crops then was, one crop of barley immediately 
after the land had been manured ; then two crops of oats ; 
after which the manure was again laid on. This fucceffion 
is ftill in fome meafure continued, notwithftanding the im- 
provements which have taken place ; but the land is always 
ery much exhaufted by fucceflive crops of oats. Auguft 
und September are commonly the months of harveft labour. 
On the lands adjoining to the river Don, which pafTcs 
through the parifti, the crops ripen early. They are fome-' 
wlvat later towards the fouth. March is the feed time for 
oats ; barley is fown ia the end of April and beginning of 
May.

I Frices of Lahour.-^'D^Y labourers receive, for their labour, 
8d. a day, but are now beginning to alk more. Car^jenters 
are paid from lo d. to is.; mafons, i s. 5? d. ; taylors, 4 d. 
or 5 d. with vidluals. Labourers, who have families, com- 
monly rent a (mail piece of ground^ the work upon whicl»^ 
is performed chiefly by their children. The wages of fervants, 
hired by the year or half year, have increafed greatly within 
thefe 30 years. In 1758, a man fervant might have been 
hired for 1 1. 16 s. 8 d. a year ; at prefent, 5 1. a year are the 
common wages for men fervants who can hold a plough, and 
perform all fuch farm work as requires the greateft ftrength 
^nd Ikill. Others, whofe years and dexterity fit them only 
for work of a iefs robuft nature, receive indeed fmaller 
wages ; but eveji the wcakeft and moft unfkilful man fervant, 
cannot be hired for lefs than 2I. a year- - For. the haryeft la- 
bour alone, they get from 30 s. to 40 s. Women iervants 
«re paid at the rate of 2I, or 2I. los. a year. 

Ploughs and Caris.— For Come time paft, cows and oxen 
have been ufed, as well as horfes, in drawing th? ploughs. 
The whole number of ploughs, now ufed in the pariOi, are 
25. Seven of thefe are drawn by oxen, and from 4 to 10 
oxen are yoked in each plough; the other 18 are drawn by 
horfes. Thirty-eight carts are employed in this parifli j 6 
drawn by a fingle horfe; 28 by 2 horfes; and 4, belonging 
to Mr Leys, a refiding heritor, by a horfe and an ox each- 
Cows are fometimes yoked in the plough, as well as oxen, 

Inchfures and Roads. --^The lands are, for the moft part, 
well inclofed. A fmall part of the public road, which pafTes

Trade and i^tte/.— .Befides cattle, ccnfiderable quantities of 
meal and barley are fold at Aberdeen. Peats are the com- 
mon and principal article of fuel. Coals are alfo brought 
from Aberdeen, which is 9 miles diftant.

Rents and Heritors,— The whole rents of the lands in 
this parifh amount to between 800 1. and 900 1. The 
heritors are, Sir William Forbes of Craigievar, the Dyer 
Company of Aberdeen, the managers of the funds of King's 
College in Aberdeen, Mr Wilfon of Glafgowego, Mr Leys 
pf Glafgowforeft, Mr Robertfon of Strachry, and Mr Hog 
of Auchronie. Two chaifes are kept by gentlemen refiding 
in the parifli.

of about 5 acres of land, not the vvorft in the parifh. The 
eaft end of the church was antiently a Popifli chapel. Neaf 
the door ftill remains what feems to have been a font for 
holy water, infcribed with the date A. C. I534. The weft 
end of the church was built before the erection of the bell- 
fry, in 1615.— Four poor families are at prefent affifted fron^ 
the funds of the pariih, under the management of the kirk 
feflion. The weekly coUedions, making about 5 1. Ster- 
ling a year, and the intereft of a mortified fund of 60 1. are 
the only fums which the feffion has to apply to their relief. 

School, — The parochial fchool is far from being liberally 
endowed. The fchoolmafter's yearly falary is 100 merks 
Si^otch, paid by the heritors. JJe alfo receives, a^ feflipi\ 

clerkj^

clerk, 20 1. Scotch a year ; with 6 s. 8 d. Scotch for each 
baptifm, and 16 d. Sterling for each marriage. The wages 
paid by the fcholars are, is. 61. Sterling a quarter for Eng- 
lifli and writing ; i s. for EngHfh alone ; and 2 s. for Latin • 
and arithmetic. The medium number of fcholars is 30 ia 
winter, and 1 6 in fummer. The parifh has at prefent an. 
excellent fchoolmafter. 

Population and Difeafes. — The great body of the inhabi- 
tants confifts of farmers, with their families and fervants. 
As no manufadtures are carried on, there are few mechanics, 
and no villages. Too many cattle, indeed, are kept in this 
parifli, to admit of its being a thriving nurfery of the humaa 
fpecies. Not that it is much afili^led with dangerous diftem-. 
pers ; although inflammatory and putrid fevers appear occa- 
Conally. In autumn 1790, a complication of fever and rheu- 
matifm, which, on the third day, brought on a delirium, pre- 
vailed in the parifli ; but fcarcely any died of it. The circum- 

ftance chiefly inimical to the increafe of its population is, 
that, as a few hands are fufiicient for the management of 
black cattle, the reft go elfewhere for employment, as they 
grow up. Even the inclofures, in many rcfpefts fo benefi- 
cial, are, in one inftance, unfriendly to population. Boys 
and girls were employed to tend cattle, while feeding in the 
open fields ; but in grafs parks, a cow-herd is hardly necefia- 
ry. This is one caufe of the great dccreafe of inhabitants 
■within thefe 30 years, which amounts to nearly one fourth 
fince 1765. The decreafe fince 1755, however, is not fo 
great, being only 56, or about one feventh on the whole ; as 
the return to Dr Webfler, on that occafion, was 3c; 8. The 
table here fubjoined, exhibits an accurate flate of the popu- 
lation of Kinncllar, for thefe laft 34 years.

^nt'tqutiles, — Three cairns, with broad bafes, flill remaltt 
in this parifli, monuments of a ftate of arts and manners 
long fince forgotten. One of thofe cairns, called Cairn- 'o- 
vcily is placed upon the farm of Kinnellar ; another, on the 
farm of Nether Auguhorfk ; and the third, called the Cairn 
tj HemblingSy or the Aflembly Cairn, on the top of the hill 
of Auchronie. Upon the farm of Blackhill were formerly 
feveral fmall cairns, which have been opened and dug to the 
bottom. In one of them were 3 concentric circles of ftoncs, 
and within the innermoft of thefe circles, fome bones ftill 
pcrfedt, but white, as if calcined, upon the furface, and 
black within. Upon the farm of Upper Auguhorlk there is 
a large ftone, called Drum Siofte, within fight both of Drum 
and Harlaw, upon which, tradition fays, the Laird of Drum 
made his teftament, immediately before he went to the battle 
of Harlaw. In the wall of the church-yard, there are fome 
great ftones, 10 feet in length, and 4 in thicknefs, and refting 
opon the fide, which appear to be the remains of a circle of 
large ftones, that once ftood in this fituation. Another fmaller 
drcle, of the fame fort, appears to have been placed on the 
fummit of the adjacent hill of Benachard^ 

3Iifcellaneous Olfervations . — -A ftofm of thunder and hail,- 
t»hich happened on the 30th of July 1790, did confiderabk' 
damage to the turnips. A meteor was obferved, on the even- 
ing of the 5th of Odober, paffing, at a fmall diftance, eaft- 
irard from this ])lace, in a direction between fouth and norths 
It feemed, when obferved, to be low and falling.

PARISH OF <name ref="NA">KINCARDINE</name>. 

{Counties of Rofs and Cmnariy.') 
By the Rev. Mr Andrew Gallie.</head> 

<p>Origin of the Name, 

IT is well known, that the Highlanders of Scotland were 
formerly divided into many different clans or tribes, and 
thefe again fubdivided into families. The clan Rofs, as far 
back' as tradition goes, were the proprietors and inhabitants 
of this diftridl. They ftill retain three fourths of the property, 
and are by much the moft prevalent name in it. Vefliges of 
the moft antient refidence of their chiefs, are ftill to be feen 
in a beautiful field, between the church and the fea fide. 
The field terminates in a fteep bank, hanging over the fea at 
high water, called the Batik of the Gate^ and at the bottom, 
there is a fpring of excellent water, called the Lady^s Well. 
The chief of the clan, and his moft powerful and confidential 
friends dwelling here, fixed the name Kincardine, or the 
Heads of the Friends.^ to the place where they refided. Here 
pafture for cattle, with- fifhing and hunting, the favourite 
employment of the Highlanders, could be had in the great- 
eft variety. The place, therefore, fuited their genius, and 
gave them the eafieft accefs to thofe exercifes, which, requir- 
ing coolnefs, patience, and ftratagem, fubjefling them, at the 
fame time, to hunger and cold, and obliging them to pafs

through deep and rapid rivers, to run over extended heaths, 
and to climb rocks and mountains, formed at once, both 
the body and mind, for the toils and arts of war. As they 
had but a precarious fubfiftence from their herds, from fifli- 
ing, and hunting, certain of their numbers were fent to the 
inviting plains of Eafter Rofs, for the purpofes of agriculture, 
and when there, looking up towards the country they had 
left, they would naturally think on the place where the heads of 
their tribes refided, which they emphatically called Kincardine, 

The chief of the clan Rofs, is mentioned at a very remote 
period, in the neighbourhood of St. Duthus. This muft 
have happened, when he was inverted with the power and 
jurifdiftion of thane j for the town, then a village, clofe by 
Duthus's fanftuary, retains the name of that faint in Gaelic, 
and yet, in Englifli, it is called Tain, The illiterate High- 
landers, even of the prefent day, found Thane, Tain, 

Extent and Situation, — ^The parifli of Kincardine extends, 
from eaft to weft, upwards of 30 miles, and its greateft 
breadth is near 20. At the eaft end it is very narrow j but 
widens gradually to the weftern extremity, where the foreft 
of Balnagown is fituated, which is of great extent, and re-r 
markable for the large fize of its deer. The parilh is fituated 
in the prefbytery of Tain, fynod of Rofs, and counties of Rofs 
and Cromarty. It confifts of feveral ftraths and glens, and of 
courfe abounds with hills and rivers. The foil, in fuch an 
extent of ground, naturally varies. 

Heritors and Rent. — There are i o heritors in the parifli, 
only 3 of whom refide in it. The parifli contains about 3000 
acres of arable ground and meadow grafs. The rent, which 
is fludtuating, is from 1200I. to 1300I. per annum. 

Hills and Sheep Walks.— Thz hills are of great extent, and 
many of them abound in the flneft heath, Cattle, from the

love country, are paftured on them, for about 4 months, at 
the rate of 18 d. per head ; but they are beginning to rife \A 
their value, fheep farmers, from the borders, having taken 
pofleflions in the neighbourhood, and inviting their acquain- 
tance, by the fuccefs they have had, and the promifing ap- 
pearance of the country, to follow their example^ 

Pofulation.^The number of the inhabitants is at prefent 
far (hort of what it was 16 years ago, when the prefent in- 
cumbent was fettled. It was then upwards of 2000, above 
7 years of age, whereas there are not now above 1600 examin- 
able perfons. There appears, however, to be but little de- 
creafe upon the whole vsrithin thefe 40 years, the number re- 
turned to Dr Webfter, in 1755, being 1743. The chief 
caufe of the late great decreafe is, that in 1782, many were 
reduced to poverty by the lofs of their cattle, and the almoft 
total failure of the crop of that year, which occafioned fuch 
accumulated diftrefs, that they were obliged to remove with 
their families, and fettle in the low country, as day labourers^ 
or domeftic fervants *, 

As fheep farming has begun, and is likely to have a great 
and rapid progrefs, and feveral fmall farms are turned into 

* Having mentioned the diftrefs incurred in the year 1782, 
the author confiders himfelf called on to record an a6lioD of 
the late gallant Sir John Lockhart Rofs, which does him the 
higheft credit. Underftanding the diftrefs of the poor people 
on his eft;ate, he fent a feafonable and bountiful fupply of large 
quantities of peafe, barley, flour, and potatoes, to which God- 
like beneficence many hundreds owed their lives. Let it be 
added, that he ordered his fadlor or fteward to give his High-, 
land tenants, who did not fave as much as would fow their 
grounds, feed from his farms in the low country, where the 
failure Was, not fo great as in the Highlands : And at the con- 
clufion of the war, upon his return to his native country, he dif- 
counted one third of the arrears of rent, over the whole of his 
eftate.

one, it is not probable that the number of people will in- 
creafe, efpecially in the remote parts of the ftraths and glens } 
which, it muft be acknowledged, are more fit for the ftiepherd 
and his fiieep, than for the hufbandman with his plough. 
The number of births and burials cannot be afcertained i ma- 
ny of the children of this parifli being baptized by the mi- 
nifter of Creich, and vice verfa. And when a ftranger cler- 
gyman paffes through either parifh, which is often the cafe, 
the parents, accompanied by one or more of the elders, wait 
on him, and get their children baptized. There are 5 bu- 
rying places refdrted to by the inhabitants, and 3 of thefe are 
in the parifh of Creich. There is no regular grave-digger 
but at the church. 

Improvemettts. — Hitherto there have been few, if any, im- 
provements, worthy of being mentioned ; but fomething in 
that line is expected foon to be introduced, by two refpe£lable 
gentlemen, who have taken farms in the parifh. 

Wood. — There is much wood fcattered over the parlfli^ 
though now, not one half, either in refpeiH: of fize of tim- 
ber or extent of ground, to what feme ftill living remember. 
There are no plantations, except at Invercharron and Glad, 
field. 

Pi/lmigs. — The waters of Oigeal and Carron formerly a- 
bounded more in falmon than they do at prefent. The 
fmaller waters, and the lochs, of which there are a great 
number, fupply thofe who are in the neighbourhood, and 
take the trouble of fifliing for them, with excellent trouts. 
Sir Charles Rofs fifhes with cobles at the Bonar and on the 
Oigeal, where he has likewife a linn fifhing. On the Kyle, 
Sir Hedor Munro hath two fifliing ftations, and Mr Rofs of 

Inver- 



of Kincardine, . ^09 

Invercharron one. There is a yair at Kincardine, which pro- 
duces a fmall rent to Sir Charles Rofs. He furnifhes wood 
for ftandards and faplings. His tenants in the neighbour- 
hood are obliged annually to repair the yair, and have the 
fmall filh for their trouble. The falmon belongs to the 
mafter, or to the tacklman. The fmall filh are of feveral 
kinds, fome of which have no names, but fuch as the natives 
invent for them. Early in the feafon, great flioals of that 
fpecies of fifli, known in England by the name of nuhite bait., 
come up. They grow to the fize of anchovies, and are 
thought to be what are found in the harveft months, (refem- 
bling the fmall winter herrings), found in the Bays of Cro- 
marty and Invernefs. 

It is worthy of remark, that duri^ng the great fcarcity in 
1783, thefc fifh came up in fuch aftonifliing quantities, as to 
contribute very much to the fupport of thole who fifhed the 
yair, as well as of many families from the neighbouring 
county and eftates, who were invited to fhare the boun- 
ties of providence in that feafon of diftrefs. Sturgeon is alfo 
found in the yair. The incumbent has feen a large one ta- 
ken from it, that meafured 13^ feet. The country people, 
thinking it of fcrvice to their cattle in certain difeafes, carry 
it home, and preferve it in their houfes. Prawns, fmall rock 
and ware cod, gurnet, turbot, and padles arc found ; but for 
the laft 3 years, all the fmall fiih have decreafed very much, 
except flounders. 

Ferries. — There are 5 ferries ; one at Bonar, where the Car- 
ron runs into the Firth j one on the river Carron, a mile 
above the Firth ; one at Culrain ; one at Tighniriver, and 
one at Ochtow. The 3 laft facilitate the communication be- 
tween the counties of Rofs and Sutherland. 



ManufaBures-, 



Statiftical Account 



MamifaElures. — There are no manufa£lures of any confe- 
quence carried on in this parifh. The aft 1746, difcharging 
the Highland drefs, had the word of confequences. Prior to 
that period, the Highland women were remarked for their fkiU 
and fuccefs in fpinning and dying wool, and clothing them- 
felves and their houfeholds, each according to her fancy, in 
tartans, fine, beautiful, and durable. Deprived of the pleafure 
of feeing their hufbands, fons, and favourites, in that elegant 
drapery, emulation died, and they became contented with ma- 
nufadturing their wool in the coarfeft and clumfieft manner j 
perhaps thinking, that fince they mujl appear like the neigh, 
bouring Lowlanders.the lefs they flione, in the ornaments of the 
Lowland drefs, they would be the more in charafter. Their fa- 
vourite employment thus failing them, rather than allow their 
girls to be idle, they ipade them take to the fpinning of li- 
nen yarn, in which few are yet fo improved as to earn 3 d. 
per d'lem^ and much, if not the moft of the fmall earnings of 
thofe fpinners, is laid out upon flimfy articles of drefs j 
whilft that confcious pride, which formerly afpired at diftinc- 
tion from merit and induftry, is converted into the moft ri- 
diculous and pernicious vanity, fetting them above the drud- 
gery of being ufeful domeflic fervants. 

Advantages. — No corner of Scotland, however. Is better 
adapted, for a manufadluring village, than Kincardine. It is 
in the near neighbourhood of two great corn counties, has 
the advantage of water carriage, and a choice of fafe har- 
bours, for vefTels of 50 tons burden. There is plenty of 
running water, and of the beft Highland fuel. It lies open 
to feveral very populous diftridls, and, were manufaftures 
once eftablifhed, and fhops opened, it would be reforted to by 
many. There are in the parifli, and its immediate neigh- 
bourhood.

bourhood, I2,ooo fleeces of wool fliorn annually the moft 
remote can be delivered at the Kyle-end, and an expence too 
trifling to be mentioned, would bring them to Kincardine by 
water. Thofe who fhall firft have the fpirit to undertake 
fomething in the manufa£luring line here, will merit the 
bleflings of hundreds, in a corner half depopulated, and in 
danger of being totally deferted ; befides contributing great- 
ly to their own immediate benefit and emolument. Many 
of the Highland boys and girls are, in the fummer and har- 
veft feafons, employed in herding; and as the range of paflure 
is generally extenfive, were the woollen manufactures fet on 
foot, the boys and girls, in the hills and plains, could, at the 
fame time that they tended their cattle, earn as much by 
knitting ftockings, as their full grown fillers at home, by the 
conftant turning of the lint wheel. 

Minerals. — This parifli remains hitherto unexplored, by 
any who have knowledge of mines. On the farm of Dibi- 
dale ftands one of our higheft mountains, called Carnchui- 
fiaigy on which ftones have been found, perfedtly fimilar to 
thofe known by the name of Cairngorms, Knockirny, 
where this parilh marches with Afllnt, abounds with marble, 
white and party coloured. 

Antiquities, — Craigchonichan lies in this parilh, where the 
gallant Marquis of Montrofe fought his laft battle, and was 
defeated by Colonel Strachan. He fwam the Kyle, and lay 

for 

* The late Sir John Locthart Rofs of Balnagown, introduced 
flieep farming into this parlfh.and the neighbouring one of Creich, 
in order to employ his Highlanders, and had the creeling of ai 
village in contemplation ; but being called to the wars, and his 
fkeep falling under bad management, he fold off his ftock ; and, 
at his return, finding himfelf in the decline of life, dropt his 
favourite idea. 



51 ^ Siatijllcal Account 

for fome time concealed in Affint ; but being dlfcovered and 
apprehended, he was fent prifoner to Invernefs. Attempts 
were made to throw the odium of betraying this truly great 
man on M'Leod of Affint, who was a royalift, and the friend 
of Montrofe. He went to Caithnefs to meet him, but Mon- 
trofe moving fouthward, by a rout dilFerent from what Affint 
had taken, the Marquifs's misfortunes, (his death was none 
of them), had their full completion, before the Laird of 
Affint returned to his own country. His family fuffered at 
that time j but when, at the loweft ebb of fortune, it revived 
again, and now confifts of two branches, Geanies and Cad- 
boll, which rank among the moft refpedlable in the counties 
of Rofs and Cromarty. The ground, where the battle was 
fought, took its prefent name from the event of that memo- 
rable day 5 it may be tranflated, the Rock of Lamentation, Its 
antient name is ftill well known, though rarely ufed. 

Nigh to the church there is an alley, walled in, and ter- 
minating in a large femicircle, appropriated to that antient 
military exercife and difcipline, known by the name of nvea. 
pan Jlmiving. In the church yard there is nothing remark- 
able, but a ftone about 5 feet in length, and divided into two 
cells ; the ends and fides are full of figures and characters. 
An Imperial crown, and a man on horfeback, in the a6l of 
darting a lance, are ftill very vifible. It appears to be the 
half of a ftone coffin ; and tradition fays, that the remains 
of a Prince of Loellin, who died of his wounds in the neigh- 
bourhood, were depofited in it. There are feveral Douns, 
which are conjectured to have been Druidical temples. They 
were open at top, and, if the Bel of the Druids was the 
Terminus of the Romans, it fufficiently accounts for their 
circular conftru£l:ion,^nd aperture at top. There are alfo feve- 
ral of thofe circles of flone, fo frequently mentioned by Offian,

which were facred to Loda, the favourite deity of the antient 
Scandinavians. Fields of battle can be ftill traced ; but as 
thefe were the refult of clannith and provincial feuds, a par- 
ticular account of them is unneceflary. 

Churchy ^c. — The church is placed within a mile of the 
eaftern extremity of the parifh. It continues to be only 
thatched with heather, but is well feated, and has a large and 
well-toned bell, which was captured in a French man of 
war, and prefented to the parifh by the late Admiral Sir 
John Lockhart Rofs. Tain is the prefbytery feat. The 
church is - 14 miles to the weft of that burgh. Tbe manfe 
was lately repaired. The ftipend is only 70 1. Sterling, and 
being all paid in money, makes the living by far the pooreft 
in the fynod of Rofs, Contin excepted. The prefent in- 
cumbent is married, and hath 9 children living. Six are 
dead. There are two preaching ftations befides the church, 
viz. Amat in Strath Carron, and Doun in Strath Oigcal; 
the one 10, and the other 14 miles, diftant from the manfe. 
The parifli was long fupplied by the committee for manag- 
ing the Royal' bounty, with a fucceffion of mifHonaries and 
catechifts. Thefe, however, about 2 years ago, were with- 
drawn, a meafure mofl: prejudicial to the temporal and fpiritual 
interefts of the people refiding in the Highlands where they 
preached. The inhabitants then could feldom have the 
means of inftruftion ; the diftance of many from the parifli 
church, making the journey tedious and fatiguing, and, i^ 
bad weather, dangerous. Marriages and baptifms, however, 
obliged many to come to church, on which occafions a 
great expence was incurred ; for the open-hearted con- 
vivial Highlander, would not pafs a public houfe, without 
entertaining thofe who attended him, to the number, per- 
haps, of two thirds of a village, made up of his relations

and acquaintance. This evil is now happily removed. A re- 
fpeftable lady, who, in this and other adts of charity and bene- 
i^cence, proceeds according to the rules prefcribed in 
the gofpel, has fupplied the parilh with a miffionary ; and 
Jias it in contemplation to build him a comfortable houfe, 
and a genteel chapel for Divine fervice. 

Poor. — The number on the roll is not great. There is. 
830 fund but what arifes from the weekly colleftions, out of 
svhich two ferries are paid for the ufe of the poor. 

^tad-iipeds.~-The number of black cattle and horfes is 
on the decrcafe j but the breed is improving. England regu- 
lates the prices of them. Befides other domeftic animals, 
the parilh abounds with deer, roes, hares, foxes, badgers, 
otters, wild cats, and polecats. Squirrels are alfo found in 
the woods of Glen Ainaig. It may be added, that the Frith 
abounds with feals, to the great prejudice of the falmon fifli- 
ing. 

Birds. — Befides the feveral domeftic kinds, there are a 
great variety in the fields, woods, hills, and waters ; fuch as 
the wood and mountain thrufhes, linnets, black birds, riarr 
lings, finches of all kinds, field-fares, curlews, wild geefe, 
herons, fwans and ducks of various fizes and colours. Birds 
of prey alfo abound, viz. eagles, hawks, ravens, kites, and 
hooded crows. There are fome finging birds of a moft 
beautiful plumage, the names of which the incumbent is not 
acquainted with. There is one fpecies, remarkably fmal!, 
and of a pale fand colour, which is diftinguifhed for the 
ftrcngth and fvveetnefs of its notes, and fings during the 
night. By way of ironical contraft to its fize, ajid in com- 
pliment to its pipe, it is called the Giant of ths Wood. 



Kincardine, 



f he migratory birds are the cuckow, fwallow, green plover^ 
and woodcock. The parilh alio abounds in game, fuch as 
moor fowls, black cocks, ptarmigans, grey plovers, partridges^ 
and fnipes. 

Mifcdlaneous Obfervatlons. — Janet M'Leod, the remarkable 
fading womani is ftill living in this parifh. A particular de- 
feription of her cafe is to be found in Pennant's Tour, and 
the Encyclopaedia Britannica. She is paft 60 years of age^ 
and takes no nourifhment but a little of the thinncft gruel^j 
or fome fuch light aliment, which flie receives through the 
aperture made by breaking two of her fore-teeth, for the 
purpofe of feeding her. — This parifh has but one fair. It 
holds In the laft week of November. There is commonly a 
fine fhew of Highland cows, fattened on the beft heath, and 
•whofe beef is allowed to be of the firft flavour and tafle; 
They draw from 3 1. to 5 I. per head. Butter is fold at 1 2 s.- 
the Scotch ftone ; and cheefe, at from 4 s. to 5 s. Veal, kid, 
or lamb for the butcher, are never fold here. The fmall 
Highland wedders, when fit for killing, fetch from 6 s. to 8 s; 
per head. On the top of the higheft mountain in Balnagown's; 
foreft, called Sciulm-a-bharra, which is diftant many miles 
from the fea, fhells of different forts of fifli are found, fome of 
them in beds well covered with earth. — The llatute labour 
is regularly exadted, and the public roads are improved. 
Bridges are much wanted.— A common labourer receives 8 d. 
in fummer, and 6 d. in winter, per day. Many of the young 
tnen and women move fouthward, when the day lengthens, 
and the Weather becomes rhild. By low living, and hard la- 
bour, they return with comfortable profits, great part of 
which they lend out at exorbitant interefl, and, during the 
inclemency of the feafons, they live with, and are a burden 
on, their friends and acquaintance, efpeclally fuch as necef-

fity has obliged to borrow their money, and who are not 
pun(flual in paying either principal or intereft. Thefe 
are evils to be remedied only by finding proper employment 
for the people at home. 

General Character. — The charafter of the people here, 
as in moft places, is of a mixed nature. Moft of them 
are moral in their lives, and when occafion requires, capa- 
ble of unremitting induftry. In common with moft other 
Highlanders, they are hofpitable, of quick parts, of great 
agility, inquifitive and fond of information, and extremely 
patient under hunger, cold, and other diflrelTes, from which 
their fouthern neighbours would (hrink with horror. — They 
ftlll retain a facred regard for the clan and family they arc 
fprung from i but it muft be allowed, that this feehng is on 
the decline. — The tale, the fong, and the dance, do not, as 
jn the days of their fathers, gild the horrors of the winter 
night. If thofe of the prefent age have not all the ble- 
nifhes of their forefathers, neither have they the whole of 
their good qualities. The moderns feem, both with regard 
to bodily and mental faculties, to be declining. One caufe, 
and perhaps the chief, is, the abundance of whifky introdu- 
ced by the late diftilling aft. There are 4 ftills in this pa- 
rlQi, and more are in cdntem-plation. The retailing houfes 
are upwards of 30. Thefe diftilleries are beneficial to indi- 
viduals ; but they feem to be making a rapid progrefs in de- 
bauching the morals, impairing the ftrength, and afi:eaing 
the induftry of the common people.

Natne, Sitiiatior.j and Extent. 

THE parifh of Tongue is fituated in the county of Su** 
therland, the prefbytery of Tongue, and fynod of 
Sutherland and Caithnefs. It is in circuit about 60 milcs 
and refembles a fpherical triangle, whofe hypothenufe forms a 
capacious bay, from which the parifh derives its antient namefj 
Kinta'il, [cean an tial), which, in Gaelic, fignifies the boundar/ 
of the fea. It is in length, from eaft to weft, 1 1 miles, and 
nearly the fame in breadth from north to fouth. 

Soil. — The foil varies in different parts of the parifli, but Is 
frequently rich, and capable of high improvement. By a ju-» 
dicial rental, taken in December 1789, it appears there are 
only 89^^ penny lands in the parifh, which, at 8 acres to the 
penny land, is 714I arable acres ; the reft confifts of pafture, 
the extent of which is not afcertained, and much of which 19 
entirely wafte. 

HiUs, Lakes, and Rivers. — A femlcircular chain of moun- 
tains piiffes nearly through the middle of the parifh, the 
principal of which arc Knoc-Rheacadan^ (The Watchman's 

Hill),

Hill), Ben Laoghal *, and Ben Hope, Ben Laoghal Is almoft 
a perpendicular rock, deeply furrowed, and about half a mile 
high. As it declines towards the weft, it is broken into fe- 
veral craggy points, on one of which are feen the remains of 
a building, called by the country people Ca'ijlal nan Druidhichy 
the Druid's Caftle. About 300 yards below Caiftal nan 
Druidhich, the eye is relieved by a wood of birch, which 
feems gradually to defcend to a lake, one mile in length, 
that lies at the bottom of the mountain. The north fide is 
covered with heath, and the eaft with very fine grafs, which 
affords pafture to a number of cattle, horfes, fheep, and 
goats. On this fide lies Loch Laoghal, a lake 4 miles long, 
and one broad. The river Torrifdale takes Its rife from this 
lake, and difcharges itfelf Into the Tea at Torrifdale,- whers 
the channel is about 20 yards wide, and the water 13 feet 
deep at fpring tides. Ben Hope is more than a mile high 
from the level of the fea, and, except a few fpots, which are 
rocky, is wholly covered with heath. Its appearance, in a 
calm fummer evening, when partly obfcured by mift, is 
wonderfully grand, and infufes into the mind a fublime 
kind of melancholy. Ben Laoghal, and Ben Hope, 
make a part of Lord Reay's foreft, in which there are 
fuppofed to be about 2000 deer. From the foot of Ben 
Hope to the Whiting Head on the weft, and as far asTongu«

fedaced, would not himfelf attack him, but found means to 
get him fliiin by a boar. He and the lady, or the boar, (it s 
not yet determined which), lie buried at the foot of the mouiv-

fents a profpedl uniformly rugged and dreary. At Tongue 
Bay, the profpeft varies. An arm of the fea, ikirted oa 
each fide with corn fields, inclofed paftures, and farm houfes, 
ftretches itfelf 5 miles into the land. On the weft fide is 
Melnefs, an excellent fituation for a fifhing village, or a 
woollen manufadtory, either of which would be of vaft ad- 
vantage to this part of the country. 

Mineral Waters. — The parifli of Tongue abounds in mi- 
neral fprings ; but none of them have as yet been applied io 
medical purpoles. The moft remarkable is at Sculomy, about 
a mile from Knoc Rheacadan. It has a ftrong fuiphuroua 
tafte and fmell, refembling, it is faid, the Moffat waters. 

CoaJI and Caves. — From Tongue Bay, the coaft extends 16 
miles to the north weft, as far as the Whiting Head, the on- 
ly promontory in the parifli, and 6 miles to the eaft, as far as 
Torrifdale. It is in general high and rocky, and is inter- 
fered by feveral fmall creeks, in one of which (Pari Va'if- 
gaigj, there is a quarry of grey Hate, and another of excel- 
lent flags, both eafily wrought, which are conveyed by boats 
to different parts of the country. The rocks along the coaft 
are hollowed into caves, or formed into arches and pillars, 
fome of them fo regular, that they feem to be the work 
of art. Uaidhe-Mhor Fhrmfgill^ the Great Cave of Fraifgill, 
extends more than half a mile under ground. It is about 
feet high, and 20 feet wide at the entrance, and grows 
narrow by degrees, till at laft a man can fcarcely creep in it. 
Its fides are variegated with a thoufand colours, which are 
loft in each other with a delicacy and foftnefs that no art 
can imitate. Upon entering the cave, the mind is imprcfi^ed 
with a plcaling fort of a-ivc, \Yhich is heightened by the fo-

lemn gloomirrefs of the light, the clang of the fea birds that 
neftle in it, and the mournful dafliing of the waves againft 
the adjacent rocks Numbers of feals are found in this cave. 
The tides follow the diredlion of the coall: nearly from eaft to 
weft. There are no currents worth mentioning. 

Antiquities. — At Melnofs there are the remains of an an- 
tient building ; but fo ruinous, and fo covered with earth, 
that its original form cannot be diftindtly traced. It is called 
Dun Bhuidhy the Yellow heap, and fuppofed to be erefted by 
Dornadilla, king of the Scotch. The flceleton of two men 
were found buried near it fome years ago. One of them 
meafured in length above 7 feet. Upon being expofed for 
fome time to the air, they mouldered into duft. At the 
diftance of about half a mile from Melncfs, there are feve-. 
ral heaps of ftones, and ruins of fmall circular buildings, 
fcattered at various diftances, on a rifing ground near the fea. 
The circular buildings are faid to have been folds, erefted to 
guard the younger cattle from the wolves, with which, it is 
fuppofed, the country was once infefted. No account is gi-^ 
ven of thefe heaps, though, from the fize and fituation of 
them, it fhould feem a battle had been fought on the fpot. 
. — On the eaft fide of the bay lies Tongue, one of the feats of 
Lord Reay, a beautiful fpot, laid out into gardens, furround- 
ed with beautiful trees, which, in fome points of view feem 
on the one fide to wave their tops among the cliffs of Ben 
Laoghal ; and, on the other, to lofe themlelves in the ruins 
of Cai/lal a Bharruichy a ftrufture fo antient, that there is no 
confiftent tradition concerning it. Perhaps it was poffefled 
hy John Mackay Abarach, the greateft name for hcroifm in 
this part of the Highlands ; and, what renders this conjec- 
ture the more plaufible, there is a cave in'the rock upon 
which the caftle is built, called Lcahuidh Eoin Jkvuich, i. e»

IJands. ^The principal iflands on the coaft are, Ealan na 

Coomb, or Ealan na Naoimph, i. e. the Ifland of Saints, Ea/aft 
nan Rean, or the Ifland of Seals, and the Rabbit Ifland* 
Ealan na Coomb had formerly a chapel and burial place in it, 
the traces of which are ftill to be feen. On the fouth lide 
of the ifland, the lea, after pafling for feveral yards through 
a narrow channel, fpouts up into the air fometirnes to the 
height of 30 feet, through a hole in a rock, which in fliape 
and Cze is like the moon at full ; and a few feconds after- 
wards, there is a difcharge of water from the eaft fide of the 
ifland, with a noife and appearance refembling the explofion 
of a cannon* This happens only when it is half flood, and 
a fmart gale at north-weft. Ealan na Roan is about 2 miles 
in circumference, and is inhabited by 4 families, confifting of 
36 pcrfons. It is formed of a mixture of fand^, and a red- 
difti kind of pebble, which appear as if baked together*

F'l/Jj.—lAng, cod, haddocks, and llcatc, are caught on this 
coaft, from May till February, and are moftly ufed by the 
country people. They are moft in feafon in November, De- 
cember, and January. Porpoifes and otters frequent the 
coaft, and feals in great numbers. The Bay of Tongue a- 
bounds with fhell filh of various kinds. In the years 1782 
and 1783, numbers of poor people, from all parts of the 
country, had fcarcely any other lubfiftence, but the cockles 
and muffels they gathered in this bay. The cockles are in 
feafon during the fummer, and the mulTels during the win- 
ter months. Loch Laoghal and the Torrifdale, produce line 
trouts, eels, and falmon. The char ( tar deargav ) appear in 
fhoals in Odtober, and are caught with nets only. There is 
a falmon fifliing on the Torrildale. 

^tadrupeds and Birds.-— feveral kinds of quadrupeds 
in the parifli are, black cattle, horfes, flieep, goats, deers, 
roes, foxes, hares, and rabbits. The birds are, moor fowls, 
black cocks, heath hens, partridges, curlews, plovers, fnipes, 
rock pigeons, wild ducks, wild gcefe, fwans, and various 
kinds of fea fowls. The black and grey eagles build their

Population. — The return to Dr Webfter, from the parifli 
of Tongue, in 1755, was 1093 fouls. By an accurate enume- 
ration, made, at laft fpring (urvey, in the courfe of catecheti- 
cal exercifes, it was found that there were, at that period, 
{anm I79i) ^439 ^^^^^ t^'s parifh, of whom about 200 
were under 8 years of age ; 23 between 60 and 70 ; 9 be- 
tween 70 and 80; and 8 between 80 and 90. The princi- 
pal caufe of the increafe of population, is the fubdivifion of 
farms, which, by affording employment and provilion for a 
greater number of people, encourages induftry and early 
marriage, and increafcs the natural attachment to their na- 
tive foil. There are, however, about 140 more females than 
males in the parifli. In regard that two populous dif- 
tri£ts of the parifh, detached, at the diftance of feveral miles 
from the principal part of it, but adjacent to the neighbour- 
ing pariflies of Farr and Durnefs, receive baptiim, &amp;c. from 
the minifters of thefe refpe£tiye pariflies, on account of their 
vicinity, the dates of births, &amp;.c. in thefc bounds, have been 
reglefted, from time immemorial, to have been given in re- 
gularly to the feflion clerk of Tongue for regiftration. This 
segleft is to be remedied in future, as it is determined 

that 



Statijiical Account 



that thefe ordinances fhall not be adminiftered, v^ithout cer- 
tificates from the clerk, bearing, that the fails of births, con- 
trail of marriages, he. have been duly entered in the records 
of feflion. — In the body of the parifh, for fome years paft, 
the births did not exceed 1 7 per annum. The number of 
baptifms, during laft year, was 47, and of marriages, 17. It 
is difficult, at prefent, to afcertain the deaths that annually 
happen in the parifh, as fome, in the detached bounds above 
mentioned, bury their dead in the burial grounds of adja- 
cent parifhes ; and of late, others have been fo wife as to in* 
ter in ground within the diftridl, recently fet apart for that 
purpofe. The number of burials laft year was 21. 

Food^ Fuel, Difeafesy ^c. — The principal food of the peo- 
ple, in general, is potatoes, of which they now raifc great 
quantities. Along with thefe they have butter, cheefe, milk, 
and fifh j and fuch of them as are richer have fometimes 
mutton and beef. They are well provided in fuel, the mofles 
which cover a great part of the parifh furnifliing them with 
peats •, and, in the winter nights, the mofs fir, when dried and 
cut into ftakes, affords a ftrong, though not a clear light, and 
ferves them inftead of candles. The moft prevalent diftem- 
pers are rheumatifms, fluxes, confumptions, and fevers of the 
nervous and intermitting kinds, all which may be attributed 
to the moiftnefs of the air, the damp fituation of the houfes 
in general, and their low and confined ftruflure. The fmall. 
pox ufed to make terrible havock, till, about 5 years ago, a 
oentlewoman, by introducing iunoculation, was the means of 
preferving many lives. She innoculated 99 with her own 
hand, and paid them fuch attention, during the progrefs of 
the malady, that, except one, they all recovered.

Mode of comhBmg Burials. — Burials arc condu£led in this, 
parifli with very great decorum. None, even of the com- 
mon people, attend without a particular invitation. After 
fome entertainment, (for at the burial of the poorcft here, 
there is a refrefhment given, confifting generally of whifquy 
heathy or fome foreign liquor, butter and chcefe, with oat 
bread), the friends of the deceafed, and neighbours of the 
village, who come to witnefs the interment, are drawn up in 
rank and file, by an old ferjeant, or fome veteran who has 
been In the army, and who attends to maintain order, and 
give, as they term it here, the word of relief : Upon hia 
crying Relief! the 4 under the bier prepare to leave their 
ftations, and make room for other 4, that inftantly fucceed. 
This progreffion is obferved, at the interval of every 5 mi- 
nutes, till the whole attendants come in regularly; and if the 
diftance requires it, there is a fecond, a third, or a fourth, 
round of fuch evolutions gone through. When the perfons 
prefent are not inflamed with liquor, which is now feldom the 
cafe, there is a profound filence generally obferved, from the 
time the corpfe has been taken up, till the interment is over. 

Church and Heritor. — The church of Tongue was firfl: 
built in the year 1680. It was almoft entirely rebuilt in the 
year 1731^ and repaired in the year 1778. 'Ihe manfe was 
built in the year 1787. Lord Reay claims the patronage of 
this parlfh. He is the only heritor in it. The value of the 
living, including the glebe, is about 54!. 

Schools. — There are two fchools in this parifli. One of 
of thefe was eredled laft year, by the Society for propagating 
Chriftian Knowledge, with a falary of 12!. per ajinum. It 
is ftationed at Melnefs, and was vifited, in April laft, by a 
committee of the prelbytery, whofe report bears, that there 

were 



Stattftica! Account 



were then 30 fcholars, 10 of whom were girls ; and that the 
teacher is well accommodated, and the proficiency of his 
fcholars confiderablc for the time they have attended. The 
other, the parochial and grammar fchool, is fituated not far 
from the church, on the banks of the little river of Rhians, 
near the arm of the northern ocean, called the Bay of 
Tongue, which divides the parifh into two diflindl parts. 
It confifts of a houfe 40 feet long, and 15 broad, built with 
ftone and mortar, containing an apartment in one end for 
the matter, and in the other, the fchool-room, accommodated 
with writing tables, benches, and a delk for the preceptor, 
lighted by 6 glafs windows. There has been lately a decreet 
of prefbytcry for its thorough repair. — The ftated falary is 
111. 2|dv the one half of which is paid by the heritor, the 
other by the tenants. Forty fcholars attended laft winter 
and fpring. The quarterly fee, for teaching Latin, is 2 s. 
6d.; for book-keeping, 10 s. 6 s.; for arithmetic and writ- 
ing, 2 S. (5 d. ; and for Englifh, only i s. 

Poor. — The number of poor in this parifh is 50. They 
are fupported, partly by the Sunday coUeftions ; but chiefly 
by private alms. The crops of 1782 and 1783 failed conC. 
derably, as the froft fet in the latter end of July, and conti- 
nued in fome degree throughout the whole months of au- 
tumn, which blafted the crops, and rendered them unfit t© 
be cut down, till winter was far advanced. However, on ac- 
count of' the maritime fituation of the greatefi: part of the pa- 
rifh, the mildew did not do To much hurt in it, as in parldies 
more diftant from the fea. There was vi£lual fufKcient for the 
maintenance of its inhabitants, till the middle of the follow- 
ing fprings ; when, not only the poor on the feffion roll, 
but families of many fmall farmers, were reduced to the 
nioft deplorable fituation for want of bread. In this alarm. 



cf Tongue, 



iijg critical jun£lure, the feffion, with the rcfident gentlemen 
who were not members of it, met to take into confideration 
the ftate of the poor, and to adopt fuch meafures as might 
tend to their immediate relief. Accordingly the meeting 
appointed one of their number in every diftrift, to go to 
fdlicit the charitable aid of thofe who had fome victual to 
fpare, and to receive from them any quantity they might be 
pleafed to give as a donation to the poor. In confequence 
of this appointment, fome bolls of meal were collected, 
and diftributed among the moft indigent. Soon after, the 
late Hon. General MKay, tutor to Lord Reay, fent 20 bolls 
of vidlual for the poor on the Reay eftate, which, with the 
government mixt meal, that foon followed, and was fold at 
the low price of S s. per boll, prevented the dreaded confe- 
quences of the failure in the crops. Not one perfon perifh- 
ed from want of bread. 

Language. — Gaelic is the language generally fpoken, and 
from it the names of the principal parts of the parifli are 
faid to be derived. The inftances given are, Shrray, from 
/^er, a rock, and Jye^ a man's name 5 Torri/da/e, from tor, a 
tower, and da/, a valley; in which place are to be feen the ruins 
of an antient ftrudlure, on a plain between two hills ; Kinloch^ 
from cean, a head, and loch, a lake or bay ; Achchaijlal, from 
achadh^ a field, and caifial, a caftle ; Dalchairn, from dal, a 
valley, and cam a heap *, where there is a Druidical temple 
built upon a plain. It would require confiderable Ikill in the 
Gaelic to judge of the propriety of thefe derivations, and 
whether Jker and dal be Gaelic words. Perhaps they are 
common to that language and the Danifh. 

Roads — It Is not many years fince roads began to be made 
In this parifh ; they are now carried on with great fpirit, and 

rendered

Rent and converfion cf Services. — The real rent of the pa. 
rifti is 525 I. 19 s. Sterling, in which are included 20 1, as the 
converfion of thofe ferviccs, which the tenants were former- 
ly ufed to perform to the proprietor, as the remains of the 
feudal fyftem. Thefe fervices were thought a very great 
grievance, as the tenants were obliged to perform them, at the 
time they fhould have been employed in cultivating their 
own farms. To work without maintenance from their em- 
ployers, from morning to night, at the diftance of feveral 
miles from their refpeftive homes, they juftly deemed cruel 
and oppreffive, and a violation of the precepts of religion, 
of juftice, and the rights of men. They therefore applied, 
by petition, to the late Hon. and worthy Commander in 
Chief of his Majefty's Forces in North Britain, General 
M'Kuy, (tutor to Lord Reay, the fole proprietor of this pa* 
rifh), praying for a converfion of faid fervices into money, 
which that humane and public fpirited gentleman moft 
chearfully granted ; and, in a letter to the minifter of Tongue, 
reprobated, in very fevcre terms, every remnant of fuch bar- 
barity. Thus the laft veftige of feudal domination, and ty- 
rannical oppreflion, in this remote northern corner of the 
Highlands, has been abolilhed, under the aufpices and influ- 
ence of an honourable military gentleman, whofe patriotic 
charadter, and generous conduft, fhall be perpetuated while 
there is a M'Kay living in this country. The farms, in ge- 
ueral, of which there are 130, confift of from i acre to 40 
cf arable land, befides pafturc ; and let at from los. to 12 s. 
the acre.

Uoufes, There has not been one houfe of any note built 

within thcfe 10 years, except the manfe, and 2 convenient 
f-irm houfcs. Several cottages have been built, many old 
ones pulled down and rebuilt, and others have been repaired. 
For want of fufficient buildings, the generality of the fmall 
farmers employ a great part of every fummer in repairing 
their huts, to the negledt of improving their farms, by col- 
lefting, in that feafon, materials for manure. The number 
of houfcs in the parilh is 248, all inhabited ; and the num- 
ber of perfons in each, at an average, is 5. 

Servants and Cottagers. — Hired fervants are employed in 
agriculture; but as the wages in this country are low, many 
go to the fouthern part of the kingdom for fervice, and few 
of the young men ftay at home, except thofe whofe parents 
have employment for them. The number of male fervants 
is 52 J of female fervants, 1 76. The wages of men fervants, 
from 1 1. 4 s. to 3 1. yearly, befides fhocs, and 6 bolls of meal 
for board wages; and of women fervants, from 1 1, to los. 
with Ihoes, and 3 bolls of meal tor board wages. Such tackf^ 
men as have fub-tenants, employ them in fpring and harveft 
too frequently to cultivate their land, to the almoll utter ne- 
gle£1: of their own fmall farms. To aboliih this fpecies of 11a- 
avery, (which is doubtlefs in the power of every proprietor, 
when giving leafes), would fureiy be a patriotic aft, by which a 
great number of worthy people would be emancipated from 
a degree of bondage almoft equal to that of the negroes in 
the Weft Indies. There are indeed fome few exceptions. 
Some tackfmen are kind and benevolent, and fupport their 
fubtenants in calamitous times ; but the generality naturally 
prefer their own intereft to every other confideration.

S3^ Siati/ilcal Account 

General CharaEler — The people of this country do not eat 
their morfel alone. They open their hofpitable door to the 
traveller ; they make the heart of the widow to rejoice ; and 
they grant to the poor his defire. Gencrofity, indeed, is the 
principal trait of their charafter •, to this they add devotion 
. to the Supreme Being. An illiterate countryman, while he 
contemplates the ftupendous fcenery of rocks piled one upon 
another, the long extended heath, the tempeftuous ocean, 
and the like, will exclaim, with an exprelEon of countenance 
not to be defcribed, ' Juftly is HE called Wonderful !' They 
are alfo faft emerging from their former habits of indolence. 
Many of them having been in the fouth country, in their 
younger days, employed in hard fervice, have returned to 
their native foil, with more Ikill to work, and more free of 
that Highland pride, which made the antient inhabitants of 
the mountain difdain to fubmit to hard labour, or purfue 
any other exercife but the chace, or a military life. 

i 

Advantage of long Lea/es. — Nothing, indeed, now is want- 
ing to make them as induflrious as the Lowlanders, but the 
introduction of commerce, manufadlures, and long leafes to 
the farmers. By the want of long leafes, they are difcou- 
raged from improving their farms, and building comfortable 
houfes on them. The dread of being removed, when an 
avaricious neighbour offers an augmentation, and an unfeel- 
ing mafter accepts the bribe of iniquity, ties down the hand 
of induflry, and prevents its operation from extending any 
further than to labour the antient fields, and patch up the old 
cottage. There are two refpeilable farmers in this parilh, 
who have obtained tolerable long leafes fome years ago ; in 
confequence of which they have built very commodious houfes^ 
jnclofed confiderable parts of their farms, and are em,ploying 
every poflible method to meliorate every pendicle belonging

\6 them ; from which it is evident, that it contributes to the 
jntereft of the proprietor to give long leafes, as well as td 
the happinefs of the tenant \ for, at the expiration of fuch 
leafes, a double rent can be afforded to be given; 

Mifcellaneous Ohfervatms ,—T\\e fea weeds, commonly ufed 
as manure, are the tang and kelp ware, which are got in 
abundance. But befides thefc, there is another kind of ware^ 
refembling kelp ware, of an unftuous appearance, fo very- 
rich, that it muft be cut into fmall pieces, and fpread thin, 
otherwife the crop would be too luxuriant. It is called, in 
Gaelic, Jemtnan nam portany (crab ware) from the number of 
crabs that ate found amongft it. Notwithftanding the great 
quantity of ware, there is but little kelp made in this parifli. 
; — There aire numbers of fmall ftones, found in the Rabbit 
Ifland, of a rufty colour, which here and there ernit broken 
rays of light, and are fuppofed to be garnet. Mr M'Kay of 
Eighoufe has got a fpecimen of them. —Thunder and light- 
ning are frequent ; but feldom followed with any pernicious 
confequences. About 60 years ago, there were two men kil- 
led by lightning near Torrifdale. As this is not a corri 
country, there is not one ale-houfe in the parifli. There is 
only one inn, near the church, where good entertainment 
can be got. This paucity of public houfes has moft falutary 
ieffefts on the morals of the people. It is no\V a rare thin^ 
to fee a man drunk among them ; whereas, in the memory 
of many, when the fmuggling trade prevailed, and foreign 
liquor abounded in every diftrift, outrages of different kinds 
were moft daringly committed. During the courfe of the 
year 1790, no perfon has been committed to any jail from 
this parilh ; nor has any criminal profecution been comment 
ced againft any in it, from time immemorial, one inftance 
Bnly excepted*

{ County of Renfrew. J 

By the Rev. Mr Thom as Burns, M'mfler of Rerfr </head>

<p>Name, Situation y aud Extent. 

THE origin of the name cannot now be afcertained. 
The extent of the parifli is about 3 miles long, and a 
niile and a half broad ; but there is no map of it. It is 
pretty much in the form of a cone. The high-way from 
Glafgow to Greenock enters the point, and cuts the bafe a- 
bout the centre, lo that it divides the parifli nearly into two 
equal parts. It is lituated in the county of Renfrew, prefljy- 
tcry of Paifley, and fynod of GlaJgow and Ayr. 

SwV, Produce, Rivers, 3'c. — Every kind of foil is to be 
met with in the parifh, though, in general, it is good, efpe- 
c'uWy near the rivers White Cart, Grife, and Clj'de, wiiich 
feparate it from the pariflies of Renfrew and Old Kilpatrick. 
Great care, however, muft be taken by thofe who have crops 
near the fides of thefe rivers, as much mifchief is done by 
inundations in autumn. In 1790, the Grife rofe fo higli, 
and fo fuddenly, that it carried away complete fields of oats, 
6 miles above the bridge. In general, there are as good 
crops of every kind in the parifli, as in any part of the weft 
of Scotland. The farmers are rather wealthy than other- 
wife.

wife, and do great juftice to their farms, being all very in-* 
duftrious and attentive. There are feveral very beautiful 
hills in the parifli, not high, but arable to the top; and few 
pariflies afford fo many delightful fituations for fmall country 
feats. — There are about 2400 acres of ground in the parifh. 
About 100 acres are planted with common fir. There are 
few old trees in the parifh, excepting a few at North Barr, 
the feat of Lord Sempill. There are about 200 acres yearly 
in fown grafs, for which they find good and ready markets 
at Greenock and Paifley. Every other kind of grain is fown 
in the parifli, though oats bear the greateft proportion. 

Population. — The average of births, for the laft 7 yeafs. Is 
i6j of marriages, 6; and of deaths about 4 ; though th^ 
deaths cannot be fo eafily or exadlly afcertained, as there is 
no regular regifter kept of them. It appears from the roll 
book, that in 1695, there were 86 families in the parifh ; a- 
bout 40 years ago, there were upwards of 100 ; and in 1791, 
there are 68 families, which, upon the ufual average of 4| 
perfons to each family, makes the prefent population Only 
306. The return to Dr Webfter, in 1755, was 397. One 
caufe for this decreafe of inhabitants, is owing to their 
being fo near Paifley, to which place mofi of the cottagers 
have vcforted, on account of the encouragement they 
meet with, from the flourifliing ftate of the manufac- 
tures ; but the principal caufe of the depopulation, is 
owing, to the largenel's of the farms, one man renting 
as much land now, as 3 or 4 did formerly. Whatever 
advantage this monopoly of farms may be to the proprietor, 
or tenant, it is by no means favourable to the manufacturing 
towns, or the country at large. When farms are fmall, yet 
fufUcicnt to bring up a family, the children are all bred up 
to induflry. Every article produced upon the farm is carried 

to 



534 



Stati/lical Account 



to market -Butter, cheefe, fowls, &amp;c. Thus the people of 
the town are ferved at a reafonable rate ; but now the farmer 
is above dealing in thefe things, unlefs he get an extravagant 
price for them. This will in part account for the great rife 
upon thefe articles ; and they muft, in all probability, conti- 
nue to rife : For if all thefe neceflaries of life are confined 
within the hands of a few farmers, who can raife them at 
pleafure, the tradefman muft have higher wages, and the 
price of the manufaftures muft of courle be raifed, which, ia 
the end, muft be greatly againft the trade of this country. 

Church. — The minifter's ftipcnd is 8 chalders of meal, and 
20 1. Sterling in cafh, exdufive of a manfe, and glebe which 
confifts of 8 acres, that would rent at 40 s. per acre. Colo- 
nel Campbell cf Blythfwood is patron. The church of Inch, 
innan, before the Reformation, belonged to the Knights 
Templars. The time when it was built cannot now be af- 
certained, though tradition fays, it was in the 1100. The- 
only repairs it feems to have got for thefe many years, is up- 
on the roof, which is plaftered ; yet a ftranger, upon enter- 
ing into it, would hardly believe that public worfhip had 
been performed in it for a century paft. The manfe was re- 
paired in 1788, but in fo fuperficial a manner, that it now 
ftands as much in need of repairs as ever. 

Heritors and Rent. — ^There are 1 1 heritors in the parifli, 7 
of whom refide in it ; and of thefe, 3 poflefs but a few acres 
each. The valued rent is 2398 1. 13 s. 4 d. Scotch, of which 
the patron has nearly one half. The real rent is about 2 1 ool. 
Sterlincr. 

o 

Improvements. — The property of Lord Douglas, who is a 
eonfiderable heritor, was little better, about 30 years ago, 

thaii 



cf Inch'innan* 



535 



than wafle land. The greateft part of it was let, about 20 
years paft, to Mr Ord, a thorough bred farmer from the 
cafl: country, who fet about inclofing and fubdividing it \ and 
after much trouble and cxpence, in levelling, draining, &amp;c. 
he has now made it one of the fineft farms in this diftrift. 
His public fpirited exertions, however, ojQFended the country 
people, who were much prejudiced againft fuch plans of im- 
provement, and therefore by no means plcafed at his coming 
amongft them. Some of them even endeavoured to render 
his fituation very difagreeable. But the prefent advanced 
ftate of agriculture in this corner, may, in a great meafure, 
be juftly afcribed to him. Some of the heritors have made 
great improvements upon their eftates, by planting trees, 
which, in a few years, will add much to the beauty of the 
country. There are neither towns nor villages in the parifh, 
not even one about the church \ but the pariih is all inclof» 
ed, and the farmers are abundantly fenfible of the great ad- 
vantage of inclofures. 

Poor. — The number of poor, who receive alms regularly, 
are four. They are all old people, and unable to do any 
thing for themfelves. They receive, upon an average, 5 s. a 
month, befides their coals and houle rent. This fupply 
comes from the colleftions made at the church door upon 
Sabbath, and from the intereft of a fmall fum appropriated 
to the poor. The kirk-feffion are very attentive, not only 
to thofe upon the funds, but to others in the parifli, whofc 
modefty will not allow them to make their wants known ; 
and were it not for a number of well difpofed people, who 
are very attentive to thofe in ftraitened circumftances, the 
funds would not be fulFicient to fupply the poor. If gentle- 
?nen, who have property in the pariili, would be lb kind as 

ta 



Siaii/lical Account 



to fend their coUeftion, when they do not choofe tp come ta 
church, the poor's funds would be equal to their expendi- 
ture. 

Wages. — The wages of day labourers and hired fervants, 
are perhaps as high, in this corner, as in any part of Scot- 
land. This is no doubt owing to the flourlfhing ftate of ma- 
nufactures in the neighbourhood. Day labourers, in the win- 
ter feafon, get i s. a day ; in fpring and fummer 15 d.; and 
in autumn, frequently 18 d. The average of male fervants, 
for the year, is 9 1. Sterling ; of females, 4 1. which is more 
than the double of what they received 20 years ago. The 
n:iode of living is much altered to the better ; but the mode 
of drefs is far fuperior to what it was then, amongft both 
fcxes. 

Bridges. — At the conflux of the rivers White Cart and 
Grife, there is a very fine bridge, confifting of 10 large 
arches. A large arch is thrown over, from about the center 
of the bridge to the high-way that leads to Paifley. When 
built, a toll was laid upon all palTengers, to defray the ex- 
pence, and the management of it was committed to truflees. 
In 1 782, it rented for 377 1. Sterling. This tax was taken 
off in 1787. 

^fiilquiites. — Upon the north fide of the parifh, near the 
river Clyde, flood the Palace of Inchinnan ; one of the feats 
of the noble family of Lennox. It was built in the begin- 
ning of the 16th century. There are many people ftill 
living, who remember to have feen part of its ruins 5 but 
now, there is not the leaft veftige cf them remaining. 



of IncJjinnan. 



jW/cellatmus Ohfirvatlons. — There are 30 ploughs in the 
parifli, all of the Northumberland chain fort, which were 
introduced into this country by the above mentioned Mr 
Ord.— In 1782 and 1783, the harveft here was very late, and, 
in fome places, the corn lay a confiderable time under fnow. 
The general fcarcity, which then prevailed throughout Scot- 
land, was as much felt in this neighbourhood as any where j 
but, providentially for this part of the country, a large lup- 
ply of white peafe was brought; and thefe bemg ground into 
meal, relieved the wants of many families, who would other- 
wife have been in a very miferable fituation. — Small as 
this parifla is, there are 5 public houfes in it. It would be 
well for the country in general, if there were fewer fuch 
houfes to be met with, as they often prove nurferles for vii» 
grants, and a ruin to the morals of youth. Here young peo- 
ple and fervants frequently meet, fpend their money, debauch 
their morals, and render themfelves unfit for the duties of their 
ftations. Fond of imitating their fuperiors in rank and for- 
tune, they meet together, for the purpofe of drinking and 
gambling. In fome of thefe houfes, even card tables are 
not unufual j the confeqnence of all which is, that they get 
drunk, lofe their money, negleft their bufinefs, betray their 
truft, and contract habits, that fometimcs at lafl prove fatal 
to them.

THE antient and modern name of this parifli is Far. It 
is fituated in the county of Sutherland, in the pref* 
bytery of Tongue, and fynod of Sutherland and Caithnefs. 
Its form is a fcaline triangle. Its length is 30 computed 
miles, and its breadth 14. The general appearance of the 
country is mountainous and rocky. The hill of Clibrigg is 
very high 5 the fouth fide is covered with heath, part of it 
green ; and the other fide is rocky. The foil, in fome parts, 
js fertile and deep; but, in general, is very barren and fliallow. 

Sea Coaji and Bays. — The extent of fea coaft is ri com-f

3trathy-head and Bay, Armdale Bay, Far-head and Bay, San*

rally dry and healthy ; though occafionally otherwife. The 
niofl: prevalent dlfeales are fevers and fluxes, owing to 
cold and wet. — There are fome mineral waters of the cha- 
lybeate kind, One is thought ferviceable in fluxes. The

principal lake is Loch Naver, the length of which is 4 com- 
puted miles. The river Naver runs from it. There are al- 
fo fome fmall lakes. 

FiJJj, The fifli got on the coaft are haddocks, whitings, cod, 

ling, mackerel, &amp;c. The ling and cod are fent to Aberdeen* 
Whales are found near the coaft. Salmon are caught in the 
rivers Naver and Borgie. The greateft quantity, in a fcafon, 
is 1 1 lafts. They are in the greateft perfc£lion in the months 
of March and April. 

Caves. — There are fome fiatural caves near Strathy-head^ 
where feals are taken. There is one very large, and 14 fmall 
ones. There is alfo a natural arch below Far.head, where a 
£fhing boat may pafs with oars *. In Roflal, 10 computed 
miles from the church, by the Water of Naver- Wiflair, there 
is an artificial cave, faid to have been made by one William 
Munro, which, at the entrance, is wide enough to admit twa 
men. The fofm of it is a curve. It is at leaft 100 fathoms 
in lengths and about as much in breadth ; and extends from 
Roflal to the river. 

Population. — The population of the parifii now, compared 
with what it was 60 or 70 years ago, is fuppofed to have 
confiderably increafed ; although the return to Dr Webfterj 
in 1755* was 2800, and the prefent population, in 1790, is 
only 2600 : Of thcfe, the males and females are about 1300

The population is not materially diifferent from what it was

rage, from 4 to 5 children. In 1772, there were 77 perfons 
who emigrated to North Carolina, and others have been 
going annually iince to the fouth of Sco'tland. Some have 
left the parifh for want of employment. 

C.iitle. — This paridi is Vk-ell adapted for rearing cattle. la 
good feafons, moll of the farms could keep a greater num- 
ber i but a bad feafon carries them oflf. There are generally 
from 1000 to 1500 black cattle on the meadow of Mudale 
in a fcaton ; and fometimes 2000, betwixt 20th June and 
20th Auguft, belides about 200 horfes, 660 fheep, and 200 
goats. This meadow is two Englifli miles in length, and 
half a mile in breadth. 



Agriculture. 



of Far, 541 

Jgricullure. — There are 50 ploughs in the pariflij but 
inoft of the farmers delve their land. The plough is drawn 
with 4 ho'rfes a breaft. They generally fow in April and 
May, and reap in September and the beginning of OiSlober. 
Very little of the parilh is cultivated, compared with what 
is lying wafte and common. It is, therefore, by no means 
furprifing, that it does not fupply its inhabitants with provi- 
fions. In 1782, there were 1000 bolls imported. The fi- 
tuation of the people, in 1783, was deplorable. They killed, 
the few cattle they had, and eat their flefh without bread or 
fait. Many left the parifh, and went to other places for 
employment. 

• Rent.—Tht land rent is about 1255 1. The fifliing of 
Naver is 100 1, and upwards. The average rent of farms 
is about 5 1. The parifh, in general, is not inclofeds 
but fuch as have tried inclofures are convinced of their ad- 
vantages. There has been no change of property in land 
here for thefe many years. 

Church. — The church was built in 1774. The manfe was 
repaired laft year. The ftipend is 800 merks, or 44 1. 8 s. 
10 d. Sterling, and 3I. 6 s. 4d. for a glebe. A procefs of 
augmentation is commenced. The Countefs of Sutherland 
is patron. There are 2 heritors and a wadfetter ; but none 
of them refide in the parifh. 

Poor. — The number of poor receiving alms is 54. The 
annual amount of the contributions for their fupport is 61. 
10 s. befides mort-doth dues, which are about i 1. los. per 
amiumj with the intereft of 5 1. left by Mr Skeldach. 



Schools,

Stati/tical Account 



Scheoh, — There arc 2 fchools in the parifli, the parochial^ 
and Society fchool. The former is Rationed at the nianfe, 
near the church ; the latter in Armdale ; neither of thetn 
well accommodated. The firft is quite ruinous, and the fa- 
lary is only 100 merks, or 5 1. 1 1 s. i^d. with 20 s. as pre- 
centor and feffion clerk's dues, and one half of the baptifm. 
money, (which was, laft year, 1 5 s.) and i s. for each mar- 
riage, of which there are about 16 at an average in a year. 
The fcholars are very few, 26 being the greateft number dur. 
ing the courfe of laft year. In harveft there are not above 1 2 
or 14, from which it is evident the fchoolmafter's encourage- 
ment is not great. The quarterly dues are, for reading, i s. ; 
arithmetic, 2 s. 6 d. ; and Latin, 2 s. 6d. A new fchool- 
houfc is expefted to be built foon. The Society fchoolmaf- 
ter has a falary of lol. with a dwelling houfe and fchool 
houfe, (which is alfo to be rebuilt), a kail yard, with an acre 
of ground, for raifing corn, potatoes, grafs, and provender 
for one or two milk cows, gratis^ from the proprietor, who 
formerly received a guinea of rent for it. He alfo has his 
peats cut, dried, and brought home free. In this fchool 
there have been 33 fcholars during the courfe of laft year, 
none of whom were taught gratis ^ except 5, who were really 
indigent.

Roads. — The ftate of the roads and bridges is very bad. 
After the ftatute labour was exadted in kind, they made 
pieces of roads in different places ; but they have been al- 
lowed to go into difrepair. 

Antiquities. — There are 6 Pidtifli caflles, or rather watch 
houfes, wherein they raifed lights when invalions happened. 
There are hkewife the ruins of a fort on Far-head. There 
arc feveral tumuli in the neighbourhood. There is a figured 
ftone at the weft end of the church, under which a Dane of 
diftindtion is faid to be buried. Several battles, or rather 
ikirmifhes, have been fought in this neighbourhood. 

CharaHer of the People, — The general fize of the people, 
in this parilh, is 5 feet 7 inches. They are rather indolent. 
No manufaftures are carried on. They are fond of a mili- 
tary, but not of a feafaring life. Some hundreds have en- 
lifted in the army in the courfeof thefe laft 20 years. Their 
mode of Uving is rather expenfive for their circumftances. 
The introduftion of manufadures would operate as a fpur to 
induftry, and meliorate their condition. No perfon has been 
put in jail in the courfe of laft year. 

Mifcellaiieous Qhfervatians, — Some parts of Strathnaver arc 
fubjedl to inundations, the moft remarkable of which happen- 
ed in 1 76 1. A woman and 2 cows were killed by lightning 
60 years ago, on the hill near Longdale. The diftance from 
markets is one of the difadvantages peculiar to this parifli. 
The language fpoken here is Gaelic. The names of places 
feetn to be derived from it. Some, indeed, near the coaft,

are faid to be of Danifli extraction. — The number of houfes 
employed in felling fpirituous liquors are 6; viz. one in Arm- 
dale, and 5 in Strathnaver. The etFeft they have on the 
morals of the people, is certainly mifchievou?. It is greatly 
to be wiflaed that proprietors, particularly in the Highlands, 
would take fome method to flop this evil.

By the Rev. Mr Alexander Thomson.</head> 

<p>Origin of the Name, 

THE name of this parifli is originally Gaelic. Thofb 
who underftand that language, fay, that Garvock is 
evidently a corruption of a Gaelic word, nearly of the fame 
found, which fignifies the rugged hill : And accordingly the 
name, like many others of the fame origin, is defcriptive of 
the general appearance and fituation of the parifh, for a con- 
fiderable part of it is not only uncultivated and barren ; but 
fo high, that there is more than a mile of a pretty fteep a- 
fcent to it, from that level country called the How or Holloio 
of the Meetrnsy on the north, and upwards of 4 miles of an 
eafy afcent to it from the coaft on the fouth. It is generally 
believed, that Garvock was once a hunting park belonging to 
Earl Marifchal, who had, at that time, a confiderable proper- 
ty in this county. There is the more ground to credit this 
tradition, as the remains of a dyke, which furrounded the 
parifli, (which, to this day, is called the Deer-dykey becaufe, 
as people affirm, it inclofed a foreft, in which plenty of 
thofe animals were then found), are fiill perceptible* About 
the middle of the parifli, where the church and manfe now- 
Hand, it is faid, there was a fmall houfe, built by Lord Ma-*

rifchal, where he and his valTals fometimes refided for the 
purpofe of hunting, 

F.xtefit^ Siitiation, and Surface — By a.map of Kincardine- 
fhire, drawn from a furvey taken in the year 17^4, by Mr 
William Garden, it appears, that this pnriOi is about 8 mea- 
fured miles in length, 4 in breadth, and extremely irregular. 
It contains 6300 Scotch, or 8006 Englifli acres. Not much 
more than^ one third of the parifh is arable. It is fituated 
within the county of Kincardine, the fynod of Afigus and 
Mearns, and prefbytery of Fordoun. The foil is naturally 
deep, wet, and of a clay bottom. The high uncultivated 
ground is, in general, covered with heath, whins, and broom ; 
the low uncultivated ground is rather inclined to produce 
bent and rufh. 

Crops — The principal crops /n the parifli are oats and 
barley. Some farmers in the neighbourhood have fown a 
fmall quantity of wheat, which fucceeded well. Turnips 
and potatoes are a general crop all over the country. The 
culture of turnips in particular has been much fludied by the 
farmers, and with great faccefs. 

CTmiate, Henhh, and CharaBer of ihe People. — The arr is 
mcift, nearly as much fo as in the Grampian Hills, which 
are fituated about 6 miles north, and in ftormy winters, the 
higheft places of the parifh, though not farther than 5 miles 
north weft from the fea, are very long covered with fnow. 
The people, in general, are very healthy and induftrious j they 
live comfortably, and not beyond their circumftances. 

Population. — The population of this parifli has greatly de- 
ci-eafed within thefe 12 or 1 6 years, chiefly owing to two or 

three

three fmall pofleffions having been thrown into one ; and 
likewife to fome large farms having been let to farmers who 
refide in other pariflies, and who only keep an overfeer and 
a few fervants at their farms here. In November i79i the 
number of people amounted only to 460 ; whereas, accor- 
ding to the report fent to Dr Weblter, in 1755, the number 
was 755. The number of births in this parifli, do not ex- 
ceed, at an average, 12; the deaths not more than 2 or 3, 
and the marriages not more than 2 annually. 

Rent of the Panfj.— The valued rent is 2842 1. us. 
Scotch. The real rent is not lefs than loool. Sterling. The 
number of proprietors is 7, none of whom refide in the pa- 
rifli J the number of tenants 40, fome of whom pay from 
60 1. to lool. of yearly rent. At prefent there refide 2 
fhoemakers, 3 taylors, 4 weavers, and i fquare wright. A 
taylor commonly receives, along with his vi£tuals, 6 d. a day j 
the wright and labouring fervants, 8 d, with their viduals. 

Fairs. — There is an annual fair, which is indeed the only 
©ne in this parifh, held in the month of Auguft, about half 
a mile north from the manfe, called St. James's Fair. It is 
now one of the largeft in the county. There is commonly 
a great number of horfes and cattle in it, and a good and 
ready fale for them. It is a fingular circumllance, that the 
ground upon which the market ftands belongs to the Earl of 
Kintore, and yet the duties arifing from it, have, from time 
immemorial, belonged to Mr Scott of Commiflon, another 
heritor. 

Eccleftafical State. — There is a commodious and fufficient 
church, built in the year 1782. The hianfe ftands much in 
need of reparation. It was built upwards of 50 years ago, 

when 



548

when the lafl; minifter was admitted. The office houfes were 
lately built, and are perfeftly fufficient. There is a glebe of 
the legal dimenfions, and of good foil. The ftipend, at an 
average, is about Sol. Sterling, and a good deal of it paid in 
viftual. There are no diffenters in the parifli, excepting 2 
Antiburgher Seceders, and i Epifcopals. 

Poor. — ^The number of poor, is not at prefent above 7 
or 8. There is commonly a diftribution once every 3 
or 4 weeks, after fermon. The weekly collection, in 
winter, amounts to little more than 2 s.; in fummer, to 
between 3 s. and 4 s. There arc upwards of 1 00 1. of capi- 
tal belonging to the parilh, the annual intereft of which, with 
the weekly collections, make a competent provifion for the 
few who are really indigent..

(County of Kinrofs.^ 
By the Rev. Mr Daling.</head>



<p>Situation and General Appearance. 

THE parifh of Cleifli lies in the county of Kinrofs, the 
prefbytery of Dunfermline, and fynod of Fife. It is 
about 6 Englifh miles in length, from eaft to weft, and ra- 
ther more than a mile in breadth. The greatefl part of the 
pariih is fituated along the north fide of thofe hills, that 
bound Kinrofsihire on the fouth. The arable land is moftly 
low, and pretty level. The north fide of the parifli confifts 
of meadow grounds : A little higher lies the arable land, 
upon both fides of the road which runs through the parifii 
from eaft to weft : Above this is a tra£l of damp ground, 
producing coarfe grafs and heath : On the fouth fide, and 
towards the eaft end of the parifh, there are hills covered 
with fine grafs. Thefe hills are not high, nor, in general, 
very fteep. Some of them are rocky on the fiides j all of 
them have a gradual flope eaftward. 

Soily C/imate, and Difeafes. — The arable ground of the weft 
end of the parifh is a ftrong clay ; about the middle it is 
gravelly ; in the fouth-eaft, cold and tilly. The foil is, in 
general, deep and fertile i, but the dampnefs, and the north- 
ern 



55* Siaii/lical Account 

crn expofure, render it peculiarly well calculated for grafs. 
The air is rather moift. This' appears to be owing to the ex- 
pofure of the parifla ; to its vicinity to the hills ; and the low- 
wet ground to the north. The inhabitants, however,- being 
fober, and a good deal employed in the open air, are, in ge- 
neral, healthy. They are not peculiarly liable to any difeafe 
except the rheumatifiii : Young perfons, however, are fel- 
dom affedted by it, and few in a violent degree. This ^if- 
temper feems to be owing principally to the dampnefs of the 
air and the houCes. The dampnefs of the houfes is occa- 
fioned, in a great raeafure, by the water which foaks through 
the ground, in its paflage from the hills to the valley. This 
inconvenience might be remedied, by chufing proper fitua- 
tions for houfes, and cutting drains to intercept the water 
from above, 

Lakes^ RiverSf and Springs, ^c. — There are 4 lakes among 
the hills : The largeft about a mile and a half in circumfe- 
rence J the other 3 much fmaller. The fifh found in them 
are pike, perch, and eels, with fome trouts. The ftream 
which runs from thefe lakes drives 2 mills j and there is a 
fufficlent fall for drivi^ feveral more. The river Gairny 
is the boundary of the parifla on the north, for more than 2 
miles : It falls into Loch Leven. Its fifli are fmall trouts, 
produced by the trouts of Loch Leven, which come up the 
rivers to fpawn in the floods in autumn. — The parifli is ev 
ceedingly well watered j there are a great number of excel- 
lent fprings, which rife in difi'erent places, from the bottom 
of the hills down to the low grounds. There is fcarcely a 
houfe which is not either near a fpring, or has a rivulet run- 
ning by it. In fonie of thefe fprings the thermometer funds 
42* J but in the greatefl: part at 45". 



Minerals, 



of Cleijh. 551 

Minerals. — There is a great deal of excellent free ftone in 
the parifh, which fiipplies the country to the north. It is 
got in the higher grounds, feems to run under the hills, and 
appears again on the other fide. The foil above the free 
ftone is commonly damp and moffy, covered with coarfe 
grafs, and always with heath, if the ftone is near the furface. 
The hills are compofed of whin ftone ; they are all covered 
with fine fhort grafs, without any heath. It feems probable, 
that thefe hills were once bare rocks, the furface of which has 
been diflblved by the influence of the weather, into the 
mould that at prefent covers them. When the turf is taken 
off, the rock is feen to be in a mouldering ftate ; and when 
this rotten rock, (as it is here called), is laid upon a road, in 
a few years it is changed into a reddiih earth, exa£lly refem- 
bling that on the hills. There is lime in the parifh of a 
good quality, efpecially for building ; but it lies fo deep in 
the earth, and the road to it is fo inconvenient, that little 
advantage has been derived from it in this neighbourhood.—- 
There is alfo coal in the eftate of Blair, belonging to John 
Adam, Efq-, of Maryburgh. It has produced 180I. a year; 
but it has not been wrought for forae time, on account of its 
vicinity to the proprietor's houfe. 

Animals. — Befides the common domeftic animals, there are 
hares, rabbits, weafels, otters, and foxes ; which laft are more 
deftruclive to the poultry than to the ftieep. Wat«r rats 
and water mice are found by the fides of the rivers. Bad- 
gers and polecats are fometimes killed. — The birds are, par- 
tridges, moorfowl, fnipes, wild ducks, a few curlews, herons, 
owls, hawks, crows, magpies, jackdaws, water crows which 
fing in winter, blackbirds, thruflies, linnets, larks, and feve- 
ral other kinds of fmall birds. One family of hawks has 
liihabited a particular rock for many years ; they feem to be

Stati/iical Account 



the kind ufed by falconers ; are large and ftrong, and deftroy 
a good many partridges. The migratory birds are fwallows, 
cuckoos, lapwings, woodcocks, fieldfares, and wild geefc. — 
As a confiderable part of the parifh is in grafs, the number 
of the cattle, horfes, and flieep is variable. When pofTelTed 
by tenants, it formerly maintained, during the whole 
year, about 750 cattle, 140 horfes, and 1 100 flieep. The 
parifh exports yearly about 150 cattle, valued at 5 1. each; 
and 10 horfes, worth about 10 1. each. Very few fhcep arc 
bred in the parifh. They are commonly brought from Linton 
in the beginning of fummer, and great part of them is fold 
before winter ; the profit on them is about 2 s. each. They 
are black faced and coarfe wooUed. This is luppofed to be 
the hardieft kind of fheep, yet a fevere winter generally car- 
ries off a good many of them, the farmers feldom thinking 
of feeding rhem at that feafon ; and thofe that furvive arc 
fo much weakened, as fcarcely to recover their ftrength for a 
great part of the following fummer. Much more profit 
might be made from them if they were properly managed. 
The hills afford excellent pafture, and feem to be adapted 
for a better brerd. The wool that is fhorn from the flieep, 
the year they are brought from the fouth, is fold at 6 s. 8 d. 
the ft^one, tron weight, (22 pounds avoirdupois) ; the year 
following, the wool from the fame flieep, is fold at 13 s. per 
flone. The difference of price is owing to the foulnefs of 
the former wool, which is fmeared, and lofes a great deal of 
the weight in fcouring. Smearing is little praflifed here ; 
tliough it is faid to improve the finenefs of the wool, and 
the health of the flieep. This, however, has lately been 
cjueflioned. The cattle and horfes are much larger than they 
were fome time ago, and come fooner to their full fize. TWs 
3S owing, partly to a greater degree of attention to the breed, 
but principally to th^ir being better fed.

Extent and Produce. — Only a part of the parifli has been 
tneafured. It contains, by the moft exadt calculation, about 
5000 acres, of which 1450 are arable. Of thefe there are 
at prefent about 460 in tillage, viz. 380 in oats, 50 in bear^ 
15 in peafe, 5 in flax, 5 in potatoes, and 5 in turnips. There 
are about 80 acres in cloVer and rye-grafs, 3860 in pafturc, 
250 in the lakes above mentioned, and 350 in planting. 
There are 3 commons, containing between 200 and 300 acres. 
They are not of great value, and will probably be foon divid- 
ed. The parifh does not at prefent fupply itlelf with provi- 
fions. A confidcrable quantity of oat meal is required. 
Much of the beft arable land is at prefent in grafs. Paftur- 
ing is found to be very profitable, as it requires little trouble 
or expence. Farmers and graziers often rent one or more 
inclofures, either for fattening cattle, or rearing young cattle 
and horfes. If tlic parifh were fully cultivated, it could do 
more than maintain its inhabitants in every kind of grain. 
At prefent it is computed to produce as much meal, poultryj 
roots, butter, and cheefe, &amp;:c. as is equal (exclufive of the 
beef and mutton) to the maintainance of the people. 

Improvements. ~£ht parifh has certainly, of late, improved 
confiderably in agriculture. Clover, rye-grafs, and tur- 
nips, are found to be of great advantage : The quantity of 
potatoes, raifed by the farmers, is but inconfiderable ; but a 
great many of the poorer fort of people, have fome potatoe 
ground, the produce of which makes a principal part of their 
food for more than half the year. Mr Adam of Maryburgh, 
and his fon, John Adam, Efq; M. P. the prefent proprietor j 
were the firft perfotis, in this part of the country, who gave 
an example in the improvement of land, by inclofing, plantjng, 
and raifing artificial grafl!es, cabbages, aiid turnips. By them 
fome millions of trees have been planted, a confidcrable part

of which are in this parifh, and in a very fiourifli'ng 
ftate. Mr Adam, len. was the firfl: perfon, in the county 
of Kinrols, or neighbourhood, who planted potatoes in 
the fields ; before that time, there were only a few raif- 
ed in gardens ; but not being able to obtain what he 
wanted for feed in this country, nor in the Edinburgh 
market, he brought them over land from Carlifle. Since 
that rime, the advantage of this uftful root has been often 
experienced. Upon a particular occafion, many of the poor 
had fcarcely any thing elfe to fubfifi: on, for about 2 months, 
aher the old crop of corn was confumed, and before the 
new crop was ready ta be cut down. Almoft one half of 
the parilh is already inclofed ; and inclofures are increaCng 
fiift. The fences are partly ftone dykes, and partly hedges. 
'Ihe parifh poffefles great advantages for inclofing, as hedges 
thrive very well. There is plenty of ftone, and the ground 
is well yyatered. 

Rent and Heritors. — The valued rent of the parifh is 2703 1. 
}os. lOf d. Scotch. The real land rent, when a procefs of 
augmentation was begun, rn 1758, was eftimated at 600 1. j 
but this calculation was rather too low, and it was probably

mills, valued at 30 1. a year ; a bleachfield and lint mill at 
^5 1. i an mn aijd brewery at 20 1. j free Hone quarries, 10 1. }

The church was built in 1775, and is one of the bell: in the

81 1. 9 s. The manle was built in 1744; it is at prefeut 
much out of repair, but will foon be either rebuilt, or

The average of the whole 'parifh is probably fomething 
lefs than this, or, perhaps, about 6 from each marriage. 
Nearly the half of the prefent inhabitants of the parifh were 
born in it ; 2 or 3 are natives of England, and 5 of Ireland. 
— Upon the whole, the population is not materially different 
from what it was 40 years ago. In 1755, according to the 
report made to Dr Webfter, there were 692 fouls. The 
number of inhabitants, in the country part of the parifh, has 
diminifhed ; but in the villages it has increafed, though, 
perhaps, not in the fame proportion. Within the lafl half 
year, 6 families, confifting of about 40 perfons, have been 
obliged to leave the parifh, in confequence of a tra(5l of 
ground having been thrown into paflure. There are at pre- 
fent, (fpring 1791), a few uninhabited houfes. The number 
of inhabited houfes is about 158; each of thefe contains a- 
bout 4 perfons. The families are about 168, as fometimes 
IJipre families than one inhabit the fame houfe. There are

the colle£lions at the church door, amounting, at an average, 
to 61, ICS. a year J and 206 1. Sterling, lent at intereft, 
making in all about 15 1. 5 s. There are at prefent 5 per. 
fons in the parifh receiving alms ; thefe have from 6 d. to 
1 s. a week each, with 1 s. or 2 s. occafionally, for coals and 
other neceflarics. Befides the regular fupplies, fmall fums 
are paid for educating poor children, to the fick, &amp;c. Small 
fums are alfo privately lent out of the fund to perfons, who, 
by misfortune or difeafe, are difabled, for a time, from main- 
taining their families ; and if they are able, they repay it. 
The fupplies arc always, if poiiible, given in fuch a manner 
as to give no encouragement to idlenefs. In general, the peo- 
ple are unwilling to let their poverty be known, and rather 
choofe to work hard, and fare meanly, than receive fupply 
from any public fund. The charity of private perfons to old 
fervants, labourers, nurfes, fitc. is a great help to the public 
funds. The people, in general, are very ready to affifl their 
indigent neighbours, and therefore no perfon has ever died 
for want. In 1782, when there was a great fcarcity, the 

meal 



of Clejjh, 

meal being from i6d. to iHd. per peck, the heritors agreed 
to take 10 1. out of the poor's fund, to reduce the price of 
meal to the lower rank of people to i s. per peck. The 
whole of this was not /jpent, and the remainder was returned. 
The fund has increafed about 13 1. fince the year 1778. 
There is only one perfon in the parilli who occafionally begs 
in the neighbourhood. 

Schools. — There are about 30 fcholars attending the parifh 
fchool. The falaryof the fchoolmafter is 100 merks Scotch. 
He is alfo feffion clerk and precentor. The whole emolu- 
ment, exclufive of his houfe and garden, are about 13 1. a 
year. The fchool, though in the middle of the parifh, is at 
a diftance from the moft populous part of it. In the villages 
there are private fchools, where children are taught to read 
and write. The people are very defirous of giving tlieir 
children education. There is fcarcely a child of 8 or 9 years 
cf age, that cannot read pretty didinftly. 

Wages. — The wages of labourers are 1 s. and 14 d. a day 
without viftuals ; carpenters, i6d. ; mafons, i8d.; flaters, 
2s. 6 d. ; taylors, 6d. with vi^luals; men fervants, 61. a 
year; women fervants, 50s. The wages c^f labourers arc 
fafficient, if they and their wives are induflrious, and enjoy 
an ordinary meafure of health, to enable them to bring up a 
family. 

Fuel. — The fuel ufed in the parifh is coal and peat, with 
both of which the inhabitants are well fupplied. Coal 
is got in two places, about a ihile diAant from the eaft and 
fouth eaft parts of the parifh. The price, on the fpot, is 
6 d. for 1 8 flone of great coal, and 4 d. the fmaH coal or 
chews, Thefe coals are of excellent quality. The flone 

contains

Statijlical Account 



contair* 17^ pounds avoirdupois. The peats are got from 
feveral mofles in or near the parifli. 

Ploughs and Carts. — There are about 25 ploughs in the 
parifh, and 30 carts. The ploughs are moftly of the Scotch 
fort. The Englifh ones are coming into ufe, and are found 
to be much fuperior to the other. i 

Mifcellaneous Obfervbt'tons. — ^There are 5 inns and alehoufea 
in the parifli, 4 of which are upon the road from Queenf- 
ferry to Perth. Only two of them are neceflary for the ac. 
commodation of travellers. The parifli, in general, is fober. 
It has been found, by experience, very prejudicial to fuffer 
fpirits to be fold at the turnpike houfes. — The number of 
houfes in the country has been for fome years diminifliing, 
and the villages increafing. — Cottagers are lefs employed in 
agriculture than formerly ; partly becaufe the farmers think it 
cheaper to make ufe of hired fervants ; and partly becaufe the 
people are more employed in trades and manufadtures, which 
are more conveniently carried on in towns and villages than 
in the country. It is, however, believed, that the farmers 
have derived but little advantage from this change j and the 
community has luSered by it, as the people in the country 
commonly have larger families, are more healthy, and more 
virtuous, than the inhabitants of villages and towns. A good 
deal of attention has been paid, of late years, to the roads 
in the parifli. They were made, and are now kept in repair, 
by the ftatute work. The carriages are exafted in kind ; 
but the perfonal labour is commuted. There is good gravel in 
the neighbourhood, which lies conveniently for a confiderable 
part of the roads. Several bridges have been built of late. 
There are now good roads through a great part of the parifli, 
and they are fliill continuing to improve them. The roads, 

however,

Jiovrcvcr, are not well planned, little pains having been taken 
to keep them upon level ground, which might ealily have 
been done. There is a turnpike in the parifh, up. h the 
great road from Queensferry to Perth. It was ertfted in 
the year 1753. In 1756 it was let, and produced 40 1. 15 s. 
a year. In 1762 it rofe to 115 1. At prefent it produces 
250 1. or 26c 1. a year, in 1790, it was let for 300 1. ; but 
cither this was too high, or the candidates for it, had com- 
bined to lower the rent j for it afterwards fell to 230 1, 
Upon feveral of the hills there are the remains of forts, 
which appear to have been conftrudted with a great deal of 
labour. They are fuppofed to have been the work of the 
Romans, and to have formed part of a chain of ports, run- 
ning from eaft to weft, intended to defend their conquefts 
againft the incurfions of the people from the north. They 
are found in 4 places of the parifli. The moft remarkable 
of them is upon the top of Drumglow, the' higheft hill in 
the parifti, or in the neighbourhood. About a mile north 
from this hill, in the low ground, feveral urns were found in 
fpring T791. Four of them were got under a large ftone, 
and fome others among a heap of fmall Hones. They con- 
tained human bones, mixed with allies and pieces of charcoal. 
The urns, when broken, appear to have been made of very 
coarfe materials. The outfide is pretty well glazed, and orna- 
mented with dotted lines.— Perfonal fervices are only performed 
by one tenant in the parifli. He is bound to aflift his landlord 
ui making and ftacking his meadow hay, and to carry 90 loads 
of coals, (18 ftones each), to his houfe. — The greateft part 
of the names of places feem to be derived from the Gaelic, 
as Drumlochran, Drumgloix), Lochgloiu^ Doivh'ill, Doivlochf 
Jjlaircrumbeth, Binn, &amp;c. — The neareft poft town is Kinrofs. 
The general charafter of the people is good. No murders 
h ive been committed in the parifli, nor has any perfon been

brought to a public trial within the memory of man. A 
fingle inftance of fuicidc happened about 60 years ago. — The 
people, in general, arc healthy. There are no diftempera 
that are peculiarly deftrudlive : Some are carried off, from 
time to time, by the fmall-pox. Inoculation has been intro- 
duced, and is gradually advancing ; the prejudices of the 
people againft it are by degrees wearing away. A few per- 
fons have inoculated their own children. If this praflice 
were general, it would certainly fave many lives. Perfons of 
fuperior ftation, could, without much difficulty, introduce it 
among their dependents.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2951627">ROGARt</name>. 

(County of Sutherland, J 

By ihe Rev, Mr Mueas M'Leod.</head>


<p>Name, Situation, and Extent. 

THE name feems to be of Gaelic origin ; and the parifh 
to have been fo denominated, from the peculiar fitu-a 
ation of the parfonage, which is nearly on the top of a high 
hill i and thus Rogh-ard, i. e. very high, came to be written^ 
as now, Rogart. It lies in the county of Sutherland, pref- 
bytery of Dornock, and fynod of Sutherland and Caithnefs* 
Its extent is not above lo miles, and it is nearly as broad as 
it is long. 

Surface and Soil.-^Thc furfdce is moft irregular. The two 
ftraths, Strathfleet and Strathbrora, which make the princi- 
pal part of it, are rather inote regular than the reft ; and 
yet even iti thefe, very few acres of gtound are found toge- 
ther, that are not interfered, either by brufliwood, growing 
from old ftocks of trees, or by very rapid deftru6tive burnsj 
running down the hills on both fides. Thefe ftraths run 
from weft to eaft the whole length of the parifh, and lie 
; miles diftant from each other. The intef-jacent fpace is a 
group of rocky hills, with mofs inte:\tnirg tiere and there* 
The fides of the hills are, for the moft part, cultivated j but 



/*^f StaiiJlicalJcmni 

it is rare to fee 3 yards of ground without a rock. The foil 
is therefore thin, and ahuoft every where mixed with blu6 
fand, or gravel. The tops of the hills are commonly cover- 
ed with dry'lhort heath of little value. In the ftrath, the 
foil, in general, is a light loam, and where the rivers do not 
overflow, not unfertile. 

Climate, is" c — The climate is fharp and cold j the winds 
beat ftrong on many places ; and, from the immediate neigh, 
bourhood of the lofty mountains of Strathnaver, much rain 
falls here ; yet the people in general are healthy, no particu- 
lar diftemper being prevalent among them. They all have 
plenty of good peats, and lodge dry and warm in their 
houfes. There are feveral perfons living in the parifh con. 
fiderably above the age of 80 The ravages of the fmall- 
pox are ftill to be lamented, inoculation having obtained but 
very little aii^ong the lower clafs ; but it is believed, that this 
is not fo much owing to any invincible averfion they have to 
the practice, as to their having little accefs to medical prac- 
titioners, who would inoculate their children either gratis, or 
for a Imall fee. 

Wood. — Some wretched veftiges of very confiderable birch 
woods are to be feen in different parts ; but the fhoots from 
fuch of the old flocks as have not decayed, are annually 
cropt by the cattle in autumn and winter ; and fuch fhoots 
as may furvive to a fecond fuinnier, are fure to be cut by the 
people to bind their cattle. 

Population. — About 40 years ago, when the returns were 
made to Dr Webfter, the number of people in" the parifh 
was fta'^ed to be 1761. They now amount, by particular 
enumeration, to about 2000. The number of females is a- ' 

bout 



cf RogarU 



5^5 



bout 50 more than that of the males. No parifli regifter 
was ever kept in Rogart, but the prefent incumbent, for 
his own fatisfaaion, made up a lilt of baptilms for the laft 3 
years, from which he finds the number baptized each year to 
have been between 75 and 80. 

Occupations.— A great many people in the parifli call them- 
felves tradefmcn, and, at times, exercife their feveral crafts, 
as weavers, taylors, flioemakers, fmiths, carpenters, coopers, 
&amp;c. But there is hardly any one in all thefe profefSons, 
that does not hold more or leis land ; fo that the whole may 
be faid to be farmers, and their chief property confifts in the 
number of cattle of different forts they can keep. 

Heritors and Rent. — The valued rent cannot be obtained 
from the Clerk of Supply, without a fee ; but the real rent 
of the parifli is between 630 1. and 640 1. Sterling. Arable 
farms, with their fliare of adjacent commonties, are from 

15 s. to 20 s. per acre. There are 4 proprietors, befides the 
Countefs of Sutherland, who is the principal heritor. Of 
the leffer proprietors, two refide in the parifli. 

Church. — The ftipend confifts of 800 merks Scotch, and 

16 bolls of bear, with a glebe worth about 5 1. The manfe 
was built in the 1776, and the church in 1777. The Coun- 
tefs of Sutherland is patron. 

Poor. — The number of poor upon the kirk-roll is from 45 
to 50. There is no fort ot fixed provifion or aflelTment for 
them, except a trifle, once a year, arifing from the ^eekly 
collections, which feldom exceed 3 s. or 3 s. 6 6.. to each; yet 
real want is feldom felt by them. In this, as well as in all 
the neighbouring pariflies, the poor beg from houfe to houfe, 

and 



566 Statt/tical Aaouni 

and from parlfh to parifli, and very frequently from countj^ 
to county. This mode of fupporting themfelves, falls very 
heavy on the charitable and humane, whilft thofe of a con* 
trary difpofition, free themfelves almoft altogether from the 
burden. 

- Crops and Expenee of Labour.' — ^The only crops in the pa- 
rifli, are oats, barley, and potatoes. The oats are commonly 
fown in April. The potatoes are planted, if not in the end 
of April, as early as poffible in May, and the barley is all 
fown in the month of May or beginning of June. The 
lower clals of tenants are much ftraitened for fervants, till 
their own children be able to help them. They can only 
afford to hire young boys, who are commonly very reftlefs, 
running to the louth of Scotland for higher wages during 
the warm feafon, as foon as they find themfelves able for 
any heavy work, and returning to live idle with their friends 
from November to March, when they emigrate again to the 
fouth. This is an evil feverely felt all over this country, 
and their earnings fcarcely compenfatc for the extravagance 
of drefs, and other vices they bring home with them. Far- 
mers in better circumftances commonly employ married fer- 
vants. The wages are, from 40 s. to 50 s. a year, with 6 
bolls of meal, as much potatoe land, rent free, as maintains 
their family, 4, and fometimes 6 months in the year ; grafs 
and wintering for a cow and a calf ; a free houfe, and plenty 
of fuel. If the wife is at all induftrious, they may live very 
comfortably, eat a pig or two, which hardly coft them any 
thing, and, on the whole, are better off, having much lefs 
concern and care than their mailers. 

Roads. — The improvement of roads in this diftriiH: is, as 
yet, quite in a ftate of infancy* The common people 

ars 



of Rogart* 567, 

are very averfe to perform ftatute labour upon them, and 
their fupcriors give themfelves little trouble about the matter. 
Nor are there any bridges, except feme wooden ones for foot 
paflengers. Hence it is that every thing muft be carried oa 
borfebacL. 

jintiquiiies. -^There are traces of encampments, with ma- 
ny tumuli, and remains of Piftifli buildings almoft every 
where. 

General CharaSler, — The people feem to be much more in- 
clined to idlencfs than to induftry. They are extremely frugal 
of the little they have ; but as to earning any thing more, it is 
a melancholy faft, that a poor tenant, who rents land only 
to the value of 20 s. or 30 s. and whofe labour could well be 
fpared from his little farm many days in the year, will rather 
faunter, or fit idle at home, than work for 5 d. a day, which 
would be a confiderable addition to his own and his family's 
fcanty meal. Such being the general chara£ter of the peo- 
ple, it is almoft necdlefs to add, that the evils attending idle- 
nefs and poverty are too common amongft them. They arc, 
however, in general, religious and well difpofed, and may be- 
come induftrious, when they have more tempting induce- 
ments to become fo. — They all fpeak the Gaelic language. 
Such as underftand Englilh at all, fpeak it grammatically, 
though with the accent peculiar to moft of the Northern 
Highlanders.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7594086">St. MADOIS</name>. 

(County of PerthS) 
By the Rev. Mr David Black.</head> 


<p>. Namey Situation, Extent, and Surface. 

THE antient, as well as modern name of this parifh, \s 
St. Madois, or St. Madoes, fpelt with an i or / in- 
differently It is fituated in the weftern extremity of the 
Carfe of Gowrie, in the county and preftytery of Perth, and 
fynod of Perth and Stirling. It lies along the north fide of 
the river Tay, and is almofl: a complete fquare in form, about 
a mile in length, and as much in breadth. The general ap- 
pearance of the country is flat, rifing, in a very gentle and 
gradual afcent, from the river to the northern boundary of 
the parifti. 

Soil, Climate^ and Difeafes. — The foil is chiefly of two 
kinds. A confid.erable part of it, along the fide of the river, 
is a deep ftrong clay ; that on the higher grounds is a rich 
loam. Both are fertile, and, with moderate manure and 
labour, capable of yielding excellent crops of all kinds. The 
ufe of lime, has, of late years, become univerfal in this part 
of the country, and perhaps has contributed more, than any 
thing elfe, to improve and meliorate the foil. The air is nei- 
ther remarkably moifl nor dry. From the fituation, one 

might

niight naturally expefl that it would rather be inoiflr. But 
the country is open all around, and the current of the river 
carries off any moifturc in the air, that may arife from the 
low grounds. It does not appear by %ny means to be un- 
healthy, nor are there any difeafes which can properly be 
faid to be peculiar to it. The ague, which ufed greatly to 
prevail here, as well as in other parts of the Carfe of Gowrie, 
is now hardly known, a change which is univerfally attri- 
buted to the rapid improvements in agriculture, particularly 
to the draining of the low marfhy ground, which formerly 
lay under water during a great part of the year. A curious 
obfervation has been made, by perfons who refided feme 
time in this country, refpedling the comparative healthinefs 
or unhcalthinefs of different fituations in the neighbourhood. 
They remarked, that perfons refiding in the loweft parts of 
the Carfe of Gowrie, are in general more healthy, and liable 
to fewer difeafes than thofe who live in the higher grounds, 
particularly along the face of the hill. It belongs to medi- 
cal gentlemen to account for this ; but the fa£l is aflerted 
upon pretty attentive and accurate obfervation, 

Poptilatisn — The population feems to have increafed con- 
fiderably within thefe 40 years ; one caufe of this may be, 
that about 30 years ago, the proprietor of the eflate of Pit- 
four, (to whom the greatefl part of the parifh belongs), di. 
vided a confiderable portion of his ellare into difl^indt farms, 
obliging every tenant to refide upon his own farm ; whereas, 
before that time, they lived together in a finall village, where 
they had not the fame conveniences or comforts. The 
farms in general are fmall, not exceeding 40 or 50 acres, 
which is another circumflance favouraole to the population, 
of the country. The number of fouls at prefent in the pa-

other diffenters from the eftablillied Church. Ihe number 
of inhabited houfes is about 54, with ibmcwhat more than 

5 at an average to each houfci 

Agriculture and Produce.^Thc Whole ground is arable, ex- 
cept a few acres of planting. It produces all forts of grain. 
Wheat, barley, oats, clover, grafs, peafe, and beans, are the 
ordinary crops, together with a fmall quantity of potatoes 
and flax, which are commonly raifed, not for fale, but for 
the ufe of private families. Turnips are but little cultivated. 
Some of the farmers of this parifh oblerve pretty nearly the 
moft approved method of agriculture, which is now generally 
pradtifed in the Carfe of Gowrie, dividing their farm into 

6 parts ; one fixth part for fummer fallow, one for wheat, 
one for peafe and beans, one for barley, one for clover grals, 
and one for oats. The common rotation of crops is in the 
order juft now mentioned; but this order is not rigidly ob- 
ferved, even by the beft farmers ; for wheat is very often 
fown after peafe and clover, as well as fallow. The method 
of fallowing and fowing grafs, though evidently for the ad- 
vantage of the farmer, is only couiing into general repute. 
Many divide their farms into 4 parts, fawing wheat after 
peafe, barley after wheat, oats after barley, and peafe after 
oats, with only as much grafs as is nectfla.ry for food to 
'their cattle during the fummer leafon. Tliere is fcarce any 
fuch thing as pafture. The horfes and cattle are chiefly fed 
within doors. The parifli does much more than fupply it- 
felf with the necefTaries of life. It annually exports a con- 
fiderable quantity of grain, particularly of wheat and barley, 
and, from its vicinity to Perth, and ether convenient ports 

for

for fliipping, along the Tay, a ready market is found for all 
its produce. 

Prices of Provifions and Labour. — The average prices of 
grain are, wheat 21 s. per boll ; barley and meal, 15s.; and 
peafe and beans, 14 s. Other provifions are regulated by the 
Perth market. The wages of men fervants, employed in 
hufbandry, are from 81. to lol. when they live in the fami- 
ly ; and 2 pecks of meal in the week; with a free houfe, 
when they do not. Women fervants have generally from 
40 s. to 50 s. /ifr awm/OT, with fome perquifites. The wages 
allowed to fliearers, for cutting down a harveft, is from i6s. 
to a guinea, according to their different ages and ftrength. 
They are, for the moft part, hired for the feafon, except in 
thofe cafes where the farmers have cottagers, of whom there 
are a confiderable number in this parifli. To cut down the 
harveft is a part of their ftated labour, and for this and fome 
other pieces of fervice, they have a free houfe, a garden, and 
an acre of land. The effeft of employing cottagers in agri- 
culture, is doubtlefs friendly to the population of the coun- 
try, and the morals of the people, though it may be qucf- 
tioned, if it be equally profitable to the farmer. 

jpuel. — The fuel commonly made ufe of is coal, with fome-* 
times the addition of a little wood by the poorer fort of 
people. The coals are all brought by water carriage up the 
river, from different parts of Fife. The price paid for them 
at the port, when delivered, is feldom above 4 s. per boll, 
which confills of 52 ftone weight, and the people in general 
are well fupplied. 

Rettt.^1h.t general rent of the land at prefent, is from 
25 s. to 30 s. per acre j but fome ground lately let at above 

40 s.

40 s. The whole land rent of the parifh, as it now lets, will be 
about 800 1. or 900 1. 

Church and Stipend. — The church, from an infcription on 
the front of it, appears to have been built in the year 1610. 
The manfe was built in 1729. Both have undergone fre- 
quent repairs. The manfe got a thorough repair in the 
courfe of laft year. The ftipend, at an average, is 70 1. per 
annum, with a glebe of 20 acres. iVlr Richardfon of Pitfour 
is patron. He refides in the parifli during fummer. The 
only other heritor is Mr Craigie of Glendoich, 

Poor There are juft 2 perfons who receive at prefent a 

ftated allowance from the poor's funds. They are both a- 
bove 80 years of age. Others receive occafional fupplies, 
when they happen to fall into diftrefs, or meet with any mif- 
fortune that demands a temporary aid. But the people here, 
in general, are rather backward to accept of any relief, unlefs 
in cafes of real neceffity. The contributions at the church 
door, and other ftated funds, amount to about 1 2 1. a year, 
which, in general, is I'ufficient for every demand. But there 
is befides, a fum of upwards of 200 1. belonging to the poor, 
lent out at intereft, which is perpetually accumulating, and, 
in all probability, never will be applied to the purpofes for 
which it was colleded. 

School. — The falary of the parilh fchoolmafter is 100 
merks. The quarterly payment for reading, is 1 s. j for 
writing and arithmetic, 2 s. ; and for Latin, 3 s. The num- 
ber of fcholars, at an average, is about 60, a confiderable 
part of whom come from neighbouring pariflxes. 

Language 



'55^4 Statijlkal Account 

Language and Names of Places. — The language fpoken ih 
this country is a dialeft of the Englifli ; nor does there feenm 
to be any very peculiar provincial accent. The names of 
places are chiefly derived from the Gaelic, fuch as Pitfour, 
Pitcogue, Cairney ; Fitfour fignifying, (as the incumbent is 
informed), a hollow befide a fortificatmi ; Pitcoguey a narrow 
hollow or gulley ; Cairny, derived from cairn, which fignifies 
a heap of ftones piled together for fome religious purpofe, 
or for commemorating fome remarkable event. There is a 
large (lone, which gives name to a village or hamlet in the 
parifh, called Hawkejione. The tradition of the country is, 
that it is the ftone on which the hawk of the pcafant Hay 
alighted, after it had performed its flight round the land 
given to the gallant ruftic, in reward for his fervices perform- 
ed at the battle of Luncarty. The word Caledonia is in- 
foribed in modern letters ; but for what reafon it does not 
appear. 

Advantages and Difadvafitages. — The principal advantage 
this parilh pofl"efles, in point of fituation, is its vicinity to the 
river Tay, which is navigable as far up as Perth. The vil- 
lage of Inchyra, fituated on the river, is not much more than 
a mile diftant from any part of the parilh, and not a quarter 
of a mile from fome part^ of it. And as this village has a 
tolerable good harbour, that admits vefl^els of confiderable 
burden, it afibrds an eafy and convenient opportunity to the 
inhabitants, of fupplying themfelves with coals and lime, and 
at the fame time of carrying off the produce of their induf- 
try to the befl markets. The principal difadvantage, is the 
badnefs of the roads in winter, owing to the nature of the 
/ foil. This, however, in time may be remedied. An excel- 
lent turnpike road has lately been made between Perth and 
iDundee, part of which paffes through this parifli, one of the 

greateft 



of St. MadoU, . 

grcatefl: improvements that has ever taken place in this 
country. 

Genera/ CharaBer of the People. — The inhabitants of this 
parifh are, in general, above the middle fize, and of a ftout, 
robuft make. They are rather, perhaps, of a phlegmatic 
than a fprightly conftitution. They are, upon the whole, 
fober, honeft, and induftrious, regular in their attendance 
upon public wprfhip, and attentive to the duties of their fta* 
tions.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q992725">DURNESS</name>, 

{County of Stitheflahd.') 
By tie Rev. Mr John Thomsoi*,</head> 

<p>Origin of the Name. 

VARIOUS etymologies are affigned for the name of 
this parifh. Among others, it is faid that Dur is a 
contraflion of Durrin or Dovrin^ which fignifies, in the Gaelic, 
a ftorm, fo that Durnefs would feem to mean the nefs or promon- 
tory of forms, an appellation to which the neighbouring coaft 
is not unentitled. But whatever may be the meaning of the 
name, it is well known, from tradition, that the application 
of it, to this parilh, took place, not from the nature of the 
ground, but in confequence of the Biftiop of Caithnefs dif- 
poning of it to Morrilbn, (Ay Mac Hormaid, as they call 
him), a Lewis man, and a native of a place called Diurnefs 
there, on occafion (i his being married to his natural daugh- 
ter, or, as fuch were ulually termed in thofe days, his ffer. 
This Ay Morrifon gave it its prefent name, to commemorate 
the place of his own nativity. Whatever its former name 
jnight have been, it (urely has been a feal^ or fummer dwel- 
ling of old, belonging to the biftiopric of Caithnefs. 

Extent and Situation. — The parifli comprehends the culti- 
rated lands on the eaftern fide of Loch EriboU, commonly 

called 



of Durncfst 



577 



caUtd Weflmoine ; with the traft denominated Strathmore, 
and interfered by the river Hope. It forms a part of the coun- 
ty of Sutherland, of the preiby tery of Tongue, and of the fy- 
nod of Caithnels and Sutherland. The greateft length of the 
parhh is computed to be 15 miles, and the greateft breadth, 

W ^awry.-— The fcenery cf this parhh is moftly 
wild and mountainous. Confiderable trades are occupied by 
molfes. Towards the fhore, however, where the peninfuU 
terminates in Far-hut-head^ there is a feries of beautiful fields, 
and rich grteii pafture. On the fides of the hills, too, upon 
fpots where JInelds have been occafionally erecled, to fhelter 
the fliepherds, in fummer and harveft, when feeding their 
flocks at a diftance from their ordinary dwellings, the Avar J 
is richly variegated with clover, dailies, and other valuable 
gralTes and wild flowers. Lo'ch-Borley, a lake which is a 
full tjuarter of a n^ile in length, and about two thirds iiS 
much in breadth, lies in the middle of the peninfu la of Duw 
nefs. A fmall river falls into the Bay of Durnefs, and the 
river Hope holds its courfe upon the call £de of Loch £rri- 
boll. Along the iliore, a trail of ilut land extends, in fonie 
places, to the very verge of the ocean j in others, there is a 
confiderable extent of bare fands j at the head lands, piles of 
rocks tower to a vaft height. 

Shores and Tides. — The lliores are almoft every where rocky, 
barren, and even deilitute of vegetables. In Loch ErriboU, and 
indeed in lome creeks, led-wate, or fea-wetd, is produced 
in futh quantity, as to aflTord, yearly, lo or 12 tons of kelp.; 
and on the ihores, upon both fides of Far-out-head, great 
quantities of this weed are driven in by the waves, and ufed 
ior manure by the pclTdrors of the udjoming lands. Great

plenty of fpunges, but not of the beflr quality, are alfo inter- 
mixed among thofe fea weeds The tides rufh in with great 
rapidity and violence upon this coaft, efpecially on the head 
lands ; and, above all, at Cape Wrath, where their violence 
is increafed by. means of a flioal, running out north by eaft, 
from the extremity of the Cape, for 5 or 6 miles, and cover- 
ed by a depth of water, meafuring only from 16 to 24 fa- 
thoms. About a mile from the coaft is the SiaigSy a rock 
the top of which is always above water j but which is, ne- 
verthelefs, formidable to fhips approaching the Cape by 
night ; but a ftill more dangerous rock, the top of which 
can be fecn only in neap tides, is faid to lie 9 miles due north 
from the Cape. 

Lakes and Rivers. — Loch Erriboll is a fpacious harbour, in 
which even the fmalleft floop enjoys perfedt fafety, and which, 
appears large enough to receive perhaps the whole Britifh 
navy. On the eaft, it is bounded by the bright and elevated 
rocks of Whitenhead, which, manners diftinguifti at a dif- 
tance, even in the night ; and on the weft by Rufpin, a fmall 
dry harbour, lately much improved by the tackfmen of the 
fifliings and the kelp fliores. At Far-out-head, there is a 
large bay of rough fea, too open to afford flielter for veffels. 
Cape Wrath, Far-out-head, ^nd Whitenhead, are the only 
headlands on this part of the coaft. 

Caves. — In the cave of Smo, founds are diftintSly repeated 
by a remarkable echo. This cave is, indeed, in many re- 
fpedls, an objedl worthy to attra£l and engage the notice of a 
curious obferver of nature. It is, in fome places, 100 yards 
wide. The natural vault is about 70 or 80 yards in height. 
A fliort way within the mouth of the cave, there is a perfo- 
ration in the arch, through which a ftream of water de- 

, fcends,,

fccnds, and is received into a fubterraneous lake, that extends 
backwards to a length that has not been afcertained. Tra- 
dition fays, that the only perfon who ever had courage to at- 
tempt to explore it, was one Donald, maftcr of Reay, and 
that the extindion of the lights, by foul air, obliged him to 
return, before he could advance to the extremity of the lake, 
or the boundary of the cave. Many other caves, befides Smo, 
are fcattered through the peninfula of Durnefs ; but none 
fo fingulariy remarkable, fo large, or fo magniJacent. 

Minerals, ^f.— This tra£l of country is not known to af- 
ford any uncommon minerals. Through the whole penin- 
fula, no lefs upon the fhores, than in the interior parts, the 
foil feems to reft upon one unbroken bed of limeftone, per- 
forated here and there, indeed, by the caves above mention- 
ed, but intercepted by no veins or ftrata of ftone of a diffe- 
rent nature. 

JPi^. — Loch-Borley affords, in great abundance, a fpecies 
of trouts called Red Bellies, and, in Gaelic, Tarragati. They 
are caught only in October, when they repair to the fhallow 
water to depofit their fpawn. Both the fmall river, which 
empties itfelf into the Bay of Durnefs, and the Hope, afford 
falmon, like other Britifli rivers communicating with the fea. 
Thefe, with all the other fifhings in Lord Reay's country, 
are under leafe to a company, who export the filh caught. 
The former river yields about 24 barrels of falmon annually. 
The Hope may afford 20 barrels. Cod, ling, ikate, turbct, 
haddocks, whitings, and flounders, are the moft common Tea 
fifh upon thefe coafts. Loch ErriboU fometimes affords a fmall. 
tack of herrings. Seals abound all around the coaft. When 
the tide is at ebb, fcores of them are daily to be feen, ballc- 
ing upon the banks of the channel. As they feldom go out 

to 



S^o Sfati/llcal Account 

to fea in queft 6f food, they are commonly in a pitiful lean 
condition ; and yet they are fo fliy, that it is fcarcely poffi- 
ble, by any artifice, to come at them. 

Birds and ^/adrupcds. — The quadrupeds and birds, in tliis 
traSt of country, are the fame as through the reft of tlie 
Highlands. Grous and muirfo\vl are, however, lefs plen- 
tiful here than in many other places ; for the hills and fields 
are too bare to aQ^ord much cover for thefe birds ; and, as 
there are few corn fields, neither can hares or partridges find 
much food or flielter here. Both the black cattle and the 
flieep of Durnefs are efteemed to be of an uncommonly ex- 
cellent breed. Cape Wrath has long been reckoned an ex- 
cellent flieep. walk •, the fheep ftock fed upon it was, how- 
ever, much more numerous 30 years paft, than at prefent, 
having been disjoined from the contiguous farm of Balna- 
ciell, and afFordtng, itfelf, no fit pafture for the younger 
flock, it has fmce fufiered a rapid decreafe. 

Agy'tciiltuye and Produce. — The grain produced here is bar- 
ley and black oats. - White oats have been found to dege- 
nerate greatly in a few fuceefuve fowings. Great quantities 
ef potatoes are planted every year. The plough is ufed in 
planting ai'd hoeing them, and anfvvers extremely well for 
.this article of crop. Cabbages, green kail, turnips, carrots, 
he. are produced in the gardens. In favourable feafons, the 
parifli produces as much as maintains its inhabitants. Ih 
years of fcarcity, it is fiipplied from Caithncfs. It is a hap- 
py circuniltance,. that the bottom of Loch-Borley contains 
an inexhauftible fund of the richeft fliell marie. 

Roads, — No roads have yet been made through this tra£l 
of country, and, of confeqiience. on no occafion has the fta- 
tuie labour yet been exadled. 



cf Durnefs^ 



Shipping. — About 20 of the natives of this parifli are em- 
ployed in navigating two floops, the property of the tarkf- 
mtn of the kelp fliorcs and falmon fifliings. Thefe floops 
were built in the Bay of Durnefs, in the years 1788 and 
J 789. They fail from Rufpin, to the herring and cod fifli- 
ing, in which they have hitherto been pretty fuccefsful. 

Price of Labour. — The wages of day labourers are com- 
monly from 6 d. to 72 d. a day ; carpenters receive i s. and. 
mafons the fame, daily wages, for building walls of dry 
ftones. The ufual half yearly wages, w],iich farmers pay to 
their men fervants, are from 26 s. to 1 1. 16s. ; women fer- 
vants are paid from los. to 15 s. 

Fuel. — Peats are the fuel unlverfally ufed through the pa- 
rifli. Thefe every family cut and prepare for themfelves. 

Language. — The Gaelic language is fiill generally fpoken 
through this parifli; but the Englifh makes confiderable 
progrefs among the people. 

^ Heritor and Rent. — Lord Reay is fole proprietor of the 

whole lands of this parifli. The whole rent of the lands, 
kelp fliores, and fifliings, may be about 450 1. Sterling. 

Population. — As to the population of this parifli, it appears, 
from lifls completed upon the 12th of June 1790, that the 
whole number of fouls then amounted to 11 82, of whom 
509 were inhabitants of Weflimoine, and 673 of the penin- 
lula of Durnefs. The return to Dr Webfter, in 1755, was 
1000. The annual average of births appears, from the pa- 
rifli regifler, to be 41 of the deaths 305 and the marriages 

10. 



Difeafes^ 



582 



Statijlkal Account 



ZJj/ffl/f J".-- Although the atmofphere be frequently molft, 
and very large quantities of rain fall here in the courfe of 
the year, yet the people are not greatly infcfted by difeafes. 
Dyfenteries, (often occafioned, perhaps, by the inordinate ufe 
of cow's milk in fummer and harveft), and flow fevers, (pro- 
bably produced, in many inftances, by fleeping in the fhiels, 
upon the damp ground, or on green bulruflies ; by long faft- 
ing, by expofure to wetnefs of feet, and by negledl of perfo- 
nal cleanlinefs), are the moft prevalent diftempers, efpecially 
among the poorer inhabitants in this parifti. The fmall-pox 
tifed formerly to cut off great numbers of the children ; but 
inoculation was introduced here more than 30 years ago, by 
the late Dr Dunnet of Thurib; and about 12 years pafl:, the 
practice was rendered general, by the aftive benevolence of 
a gentleman belonging to the parifh, and was attended with 
the greateft fuccefs. 

Emigrations. — About 17 or 18 years ago, feveral families 
emigrated from this parifh to North America. A few have 
removed, within thefe 2 or 3 years, to feek employment at 
the cotton mills. 

Churchy ^c, — This, with the adjoining pariflies in Strath- 
naver, known by the names of Tongue and Eddrachylifla, 
comprehending a tradt of country, which is computed to be 
30 miles in length, and 15 or 20 in breadth, were formerly 
united in one parifli, under the common name of Durnefs. 
But, as one clergyman was not equal to the talk of inftruft- 
ing the inhabitants of fo extenfive a diftridt in religion, and in- 
fpefting their manners, George Lord Reay, in the year 1721, 
applied to the General AlTembly of the Church of Scotland, 
for aid towards the religious inftrudtion of the inhabitants of 
this country. The AlTembly agreed, that a colleflion fhould, 

for 



of Durnefs, 



for this purpofe, be made through all Scotland. A contri- 
bution of 1500 1. Sterling was thus obtained. The original 
parifh of Durnefs was, in confequence, divided into the 3 
prefent pariflies of Durnefs, Tongue, and Eddrachylifli, in 
the year 1724. Stipends were afligned for the minifters of 
thefe pariflies, in certain proportions, out of the teinds of 
Lord Reay's eftate, and the intereft of the money contribut- 
ed. The ftipend then allotted to the minifter of Durnefs, 
was 800 merks Scotch, with 40 merks more, in the fame 
money, for communion elements. Of thefe fums, 150 merks 
were conftituted payable out of the teinds of Lord Reay's 
eftate ; the other 690 merks were to be received out of the 
intereft of the general contribution. By a reduction of the 
rate of the intereft upon the mortified fund, this ftipend 
has been fince diminiflied to the fmall fum of 42 1. 16 s. 8d- 
Sterling. The glebe may be worth about 4 1. of yearly rent. 
The king is patron ; but the family of Reay have always 
prefented, and their prefentees have ever been acceptable to 
the people. A part of the church feems to have been built 
in the year 1692, and fome part of it may have been built 
ftill earlier. The manfe was firft built in the year 1727 ; in 
1 77 1, It was repaired ; and in the years 1785 and 1786, it 
was entirely rebuilt. 

Schools. — The falary of the parochial fchool is only 100 
merks Scotch, payable by Lord Reay, with recourfe on his 
Lordlliip's tenants for the one half. The quarter payments 
are, 2 s. 6d. for teaching Latin-, 2S. for arithmetic ; is. 
6 d. for reading and writing ; and i s. for teaching to read. 
The fchoolmafter has fometimes 20 s. and fometimes 1 1. 
1 o s. a year, as precentor and feffion clerk. He has i s. for 
every marriage, and 3 d. for a baptifra. But the falary and 
perquifites could not maintain him, if his employers did not 

accom- 



Statiftical Account 



accommodate him in board and lodgings. The prefent mafii 
ter, Mr Thomas Rofs, is approved for his diligence and fuc- 
cefs. The number of fcholars is 45, or thereby. The 
fchool houfe and room for the mafter will be in excellent re- 
pair very foon. There is a Society fchool in Weftmoine, a 
diftri^t of this parifli. The mafter has lol. a year; and 
his wife 3 1. for teaching lome branches of female education. 
The number of fcholars never exceed 30 at any time ; there 
are indeed feldom fo many. 

Pcor. — There are 35 poor people who are affifted from the 
funds, under the direction of the klik fefjion. The amount 
of the weekly contributions, for their relief, with the inte- 
reft of a mortified fund of 57 I. 10 s. may be about 12 1. a 
year. In the years 1782 and 1783, when the crops failed, 
the fupplies liberally provided by the late Lieutenant-Gene- 
ral Alexander Mackay, together with the fliare of what Par- 
liament granted, for the relief of the north of Scotland, 
contributed greatly to alleviate the fufi'crings of the poor, in 
thofe feafons of general want. 

Antiquities. — The only remarkable monument of antiqui. 
ty, that remains in this parifli, is the famous Dun Dornadiiia, 
in Strathmore. That portion of the wall, of this antient 
tower, which is ftill {landing, is 1 8 feet at the higheft part. 
The area appears to have been furrounded with 2 concentric 
walls. A large triangular ftone covers the front door, as a 
. lintd. The oppofite hde has been reduced to rubbilh. 

Enwient Men. — The celebrated Gaelic bard, Robert Doun, 
was of this parifli. His fongs are well known, and difcover 
uncommon force of genius. It is a pity that they have not 
/ beqA 



Durnefs, 



been printed, to fecure them from mutilation, corruption, or 
oblivion. 

Propcfed Improvements. — It would contribute greatly to the 
fafe navigation of veflels upon thefe coafts, if a light-houfe 
was erefted upon Cape Wrath. The bearings of the rocks, 
lying off the Cape, ought alfo to be accurately afcertained. 
Some fliipwrecks that have happened, within thefe laft lo 
years, upon the coaft of Durnefs, feem to point out the nc- 
ceiSty of thefe meafures. 

General CharaEIer. — Of the charafter of the inhabitants 
of this parifh, it may be obferved, that they are moderately 
induftrious, hofpitablc, and fond of a military life. Many a 
brave hardy foldier has gone from Durnefs ; and of thefe, 
fome have raifed themfelves confiderably in the army.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7621158">STRAITON</name>, 

(County of Ayr J) 

By Mr William Crawford, AJJlftant to the Rev. Mr 

M'Dermit.</head> 



<p>Origin of the Name, 

WHEN the Romans were matters of this part of the 
ifland, they formed roads of communication between 
their ftations. The iflanders called thefe roads Jlrats^ ffetSf 
or JlreetSy from a refemblance they bore to the ftreets in their 
own miferable villages. Hence it is inferred, that towns or vil- 
lages, the names of which begin with Jlrat or Jlret^ are fo 
named, becaufe eredled on or near fome Roman high- way *. 
To favour this conjedlure, that the village of Straiton or 
Strettoivn ftands on or near one of thefe Roman roads, there 
are ftiU vifible fome vefliges of an oblong entrenchment on 
the fummit of Benan Hill, which ftands fouth from the village 
about half a mile, commanding a very extenfive view of Car- 
rick, Kyle, Cunningham, Arran, the rock of Elfa, and fome of 
the hills in the Weft Highlands. — Some years ago, in digging a 
foundation for an obelilk, erefled on the top of this hill, by the 
late Sir John Whitefoord, there was found an urn, curioufly 
carved, and filled with aOxes ; and, at the farther fide of the 

fame 

* Vide Cambden, p. 636; &amp; Bede, B. i. c. ix. 



of Straiton* 



5^7 



fame hill, there was found, about 3 years ago, another urnj 
much fmaller than the fornier. 

Situation and Extent. — The parifh of Straiton lies in that 
diftria of Ayrfliire called Carrick, in the prefbytery of Ayr, 
andfynodof Glafgow and Ayr. It is about 15 miles in 
length, from S. E. to N. W. j and, at an average, 5 miles in 
breadth ; containing about 75 fquare miles in furface. The 
fituation of the village, at the bottom of 2 hills, between 
which runs the water of Girvan, is delightful. It is built 
on a rifing ground. The houfes are neat and uniform, being 
all conitru6led upon the fame plan, about 30 years ago, by 
Thomas Earl of Caflilis. The uniformity of the houfes, to- 
gether with the adjacent green hills, fliirted with wood, the 
vicinity of the Girvan, and a confiderable number of very 
old trees in the church- yard, and about the village, juftify 
thofe who vifit this place, in pronouncing it one of the moft 
beautiful Highland villages they have ever feen. It ftandst 
13 miles S. £. from Ayr, and about the fame diftance N« 
E. from Girvan. 

Soil, Surfacsy Climate^ ^c. — In a parifli of fuch extent^ 
there is, as might be expedled, a variety of foils, and diver- 
fity of climate. The greateft part of the furface is only fit 
for pafturage. The fouth-eaft part of the parifh, though 
not very high, is extremely wild and rocky, having a num- 
ber of fmall lakes fcattered here and there in it, abounding 
with excellent trouts. There is one farm, containing up- 
wards of 6000 acres, which does riot pay to the proprietor a- 
bove 50 1. of yearly rent. A great deal, even of the arable 
part of the parifh, is employed in raifing cattle. The farmer 
reaps a greater, at leaft a more certain profit, this way, than 
from tillage. The land employed in raifing corn, bears a 

very 



588 



Stafi/llcal Account 



very fmall proportion to the whole. The proportion is miich 
fmaller now, than it feems to have been about 50 or 60 years 
backwards. The quantity of grain fown annually may a- 
mount to 6©o bolls. The foil, in which it is fown, is ge- 
nerally either an earthy gravel, or a light loam. In the neigh- 
bourhood of the village, and in the barony of Whitefoord, 
oats will yield 6 or 7 feeds at an average, and barley in pro- 
portion. Wheat, in fome feafons, fucceeds very well ; but, 
being rather precarious, is very little cultivated. The cli- 
mate is very temperate and healthy, and the foil, in general, 
dry ; fo that the farmers winter their young cattle, without 
ever bringing them into a houfe. The fnow feldom lies 
long, efpecially about the village. A perfon travelling from 
the eaft, as he approaches it, is fenfibly ftruck with the 
warmer temperature of the air. The harveft is remarkably 
early, confidering the proximity of the hills. — The difeafe, 
moft fatal in the parifh, is confumption on the lungs. The 
fmall-pox carries oflF very few, the practice of inoculation 
having become Very general, even among the lower orders of 
the people. There are, in the parilh, feveral perfons who 
have reached the age of 80, fome 90, and one 100. 

Rent, and Stock in Cait/e.— The valued rent is 4548 I. rp s. 
10 d. Scotch i the real rent, about, 3000 1. Sterling. There 
are only 7 proprietors, 3 of whom refide in the parifli. It 
maintains about 20,000 flieep, which yield about 171 packs 
of wool, which has been fold, at an average of the 3 laft 
yeafs, for 5 1. or 5 guineas per pack. Wedders, 3 years old, 
are fold for half a guinea, or n s. and other flieep in pro- 
portion. There are, in the parifh, about 2ieo black cattle, 
fold at different prices, according to their age and weight. 

Some of the farmers fell them, when only two years and a 

half 



of Straitofi* 



half old, at 5 guineas a head. They are very like the 
cattle in Galloway, both in fize and fliape. 

Prices of Provj/ions. — The price of butcher meat depends 
upon the Ayr market. It is commonly fold a halfpenny per 
pound cheaper in Straiton than in Ayr. A pair of fowls fells 
at I s. 4 d. } chickens, 6 d. i a dozen of eggs, 2 d. i a pound 
of butter, 8 d. 

Rivers. — The Doon, the eaftern boundary of Carrick, 
ifluing from a lake of the fame name, 7 miles in length, 
wafhcs the eaft and north- eaft fide of the parifli ; and run- 
ning north-weft about 1 8 miles, empties itfelf into the Frith 
of Clyde, about 2 miles fouth from Ayr. In both loch and 
river there are falmon, red and white trouts, and cuddings, 
or charr. The rains ufed formerly to raife the loch in fuch 
a manner, that the river, receiving the accumulated water 
from this refervoir, frequently overflowed its banks, and de- 
ftroyed the meadows. The rock, over which the loch dis- 
charged itfelf, has lately been cut in two places at confider- 
able expence, by the Earl of Caffilis, and Mr M'Adam of 
Craigingillan, the proprietors on each fide ; fo that, by means 
of fluices, not only the damage is prevented, but fome land 
is gained, by a diminution of the extent of the loch. The 
Girvan has its fource in the parilh, about 8 miles above the 
village. Like the Doon, it rifes from a loch, or rather a 
great number of lochs, the principal of which are Garany 
and Braden. Thefe two, and 1 2 other lochs in the parifli, 
are inhabited, fame of them by red, and fome by white 
trouts, fome by both, and one of them entirely by pikes. la 
the Water of Girvan there are trouts and falmon. The 
courfe of the Girvan, till it pafs the village, is north-weft. 
After leaving the parilh, which it divides into two unequal 

parts.

parts, it turns fouth weft, and difcharges itfelf into the Frith 
of Girvan, after a courfe of 20 miles. 

W wd. — There is a great deal of natural wood in the pa- 
rifti, which is very profitable to the proprietors. Some of 
the hills are beautifully fkirted with it, alinoft to their tops. 
There are fome confiderable plantations of exceeding good 
trees of different kinds ; fuch as oak, elm, afti, beech, lime, 
fycamore, fir, gcc. efpecially about and n^ar the place of 
Whitefoord. 

Minerals. — There is plenty of coal, lime, marl, aftd free 
and iron ftone in the parifh. It is to be regretted, that the 
coal is at a diftance of more than 4 miles from the village, 
and the road unpaflable with carts for the greateft part of 
the year j fo that the inhabitants are obliged to bring their 
coals from the parifh of Dalmellington, at the diftance of 8 
miles. On the margin of Loch Doon, there are beds of a 
very fingular foft bluifh clay fubftance, which, when taken 
up, and expofed to the fun and atmofphere, becomes as white 
as any fuller's earth, and acquires the confiflency of chalk. 
It has been examined chemically by the celebrated Dr Hut- 
ton, who can give the fullefl and beft account of it. 

Church. — The old fllpend was 53 1. i8s. a-fd. with 48 
bolls of visual, two thirds meal and one third bear. The 
Court of Seffion laft year granted an augmentation of 40 
bolls meal and bear, in the above proportions, with 3 1. 6 s. 
8 d. for communion elements. The glebe, including the 
garden, confifb of 8 acres of good land. The patronage of 
the parifh belongs to the Crown. The church is in pretty 
good condition. The manfe, though built fo lately as in

nifter 



of Siralton* 



hifter from the Revolution. There is but one Seceder, and 
no Roman Catholics. 

ScAool. The fchool-houfe is in good condition ; but the 

falary being only loo merks, no teacher thinks it worth his 
while to rtay long in the parifh. Accordingly, of late, there 
has been a very rapid fucccffion of fchoolmafters, to the 
great detriment of the parifh. The fmallnefs of the emo- 
luments excludes from a choice of teachers. 

Population. — According to Dr Webfter, the population, in 
1755, amounted to 1123. The number of fouls, taken lafl: 
fummer (1791}, at a parochial vifitation, was 934. Of thefe 
there are.

There has been no regifter of marriages and burials kept 
in the parifh before 1783. From the regifter of baptifms it 
appears, that the number has decrealed. This, indeed, 
might be expefted, as feveral farms that formerly kept 2 or 
3 families, are now polTefled by individuals. Of this fre- 
quent proofs are feen, in the veftiges of old houfes, of which 
only the foundations remain. In all countries, where fh? 
people live chiefly by pafturing cattle, this will be the cviie. 
As they improve by inclofures, 5rc. fewer hands are necelTa- 
rjT to fuperintend the flocks and herds.

D'tvifion and Conditions of the Inhabitants. — Of the 1 84 fa- 
milies, 3 belong to proprietors of land, 33 to farmers, and 41 
to villagers. The reft are the families of fhepherds, cot- 
tagers, labourers, and coalliers. There are 4 flboemakers, 3 
taylors, 4 mafons, 4 blackfmiths, 2 millers, 3 joiners, 2 cart- 
wrights, I butcher, and i baker, who are chiefly employed 
by the people in the parifh j and 1 2 weavers, befides jour- 
neymen and apprentices, who, till very lately, were employ- 
ed principally in making woollen webs for the Ayr and May- 
bole markets. During the laft year, the greateft part of 
them have betaken themfelves to the weaving of muflin. — 
Before the late extenfion of the excife laws, there were in 
Straiton a confiderable number of fmugglers. The late re- 
gulations, having increafed the rilk, at the fame time that 
they diminifhed the profits, have, in this place, almoft en- 
tirely put an end to this kind of illicit traffic. There are in 

the 



of Siraiion, 



596 



the viHage 2 inns, and 4 ale-houfes. It were to be wiflie J that 
ale only were fold in them. 

Poor. — The decay of fmuggling has reduced feveral fajni- 
]ies, that ufed to live plentifully, to great poverty, {'o that the 
number of the poor may be expe£led to increafe. The 
number of paupers, fupported by the parifh funds, has in- 
creafed from about 12, within thefe 2 or 3 !art years, to 19. 
The fum annually expended upon them is about 30 1. which 
is procured by the weekly colleflions at church, and the in- 
tereft of 120I. appropriated to them. They live in their 
own houfes, and the greateft part of them earn fometiiing 
by their induftry, befides their monthly fupply from the 
funds. Scarcely any of them beg. 

Antiquities. — Befides the two urns already mentionrd, there 
is, upon a little ifland in Loch Doon, the ruins of an old 
caftle, which has been built of very large frec-llones. The 
form is oftangular. The arch of a Gothic gate is rtill en- 
tire. The hiftory of this caftle, which muft have been a 
retreat of great ftrength and fecurity, cannot now be ob- 
tained. The ifland on which it ftands is neareft to the Car- 
rick fhore, and belongs to the Earl of Callilis. How the 
ftones, which are very large, were brought hither, is not 
eafy to conjecture. There is no quarry nearer tJian 8 miles, 
and the intervening ground is rough and hilly, without any 
veftige of a road. In Loch Bradfn, one of the fon-ce of 
the Girvan, there is alfo an ifland, with the remains of a 
caftle on it. There are feveral veftiges of thofe cairns, fo 
frequently met with in Scotland, in the parilh of Straiton; 
one in particular, which feems to have been 3 place of great 
confequence and folemnity. It is remarkable, that Sir lames

Situation. 

THIS parifli is fituated in the county, fynod, and prefi 
bytery of Aberdeen. ; 

Rent. — The real rent cannot be exatSlly afcertalned, as it 
confifts of money, meal, bear, pouhry, fervices, and what is 
worft of all, (as they operate as a tax upon improven^ent)^ 
tniln multures. 

Church. — The ftipend is paid, partly in money, and partly 
in vi£lual. The former amounts to 3 Sol. 2d. Scotch; and 
the latter confifts of 37 bolls 3 firlots 3 pecks meal, 6 bolls 
iy pecks bear, and 6 bolls malt i befides a glebe of 5 acres.

and about a quarter of an acre of pafture ground. In 17(5-^ 
there was an augmentation of 106 1. Scotch. The College 
of Sc. Andrew's are titulars of the teinds, and draw a confi- 
derable fuui yearly from the parifli. 

School. — The parochial fchool is frnall. The number of 
fchohrs, in winter, is from 20 to 30 ; but does not exceed 
J 4 or 15 in fummer. The falary is only 5 1. 12 s. The 
perquifites are trifling. Till wilhln thefe 9 years, there was 
uo legal falary. 

Po^'^t'Iat'on. — The return to Dr Weber, in the year 1755, 
was 3*^; 3; from which it appears, there is a decreafe of 31 
within thefe 40 years. 

Cattle, — The number of black cattle feldom exceeds 650. 
That of the horfes, in January 1792, was 94. Both were 
included in the former calculation. 

Dif advantages . — The high duty on malt is feverely felt in 
this parifh. This tax amounts to nearly one third of the 
value of the bear, which operates almoft as a prohibition of 
the manufacture, and, of confequence, not only diftreffes the 
country people, by depriving them of a neceflary and 
flrengrhening refrcftiment, but likewife hurts the revenue, 
by diminifliing the confumption. There is hardly one fourth 
of the quantity of malt made now in the parifli, that was 
made in it 20 years ^go ; which is attended with this addi- 
tional bad confequence, that the people, being deprived of 
their ufual whclefome liquor, are obliged to have recourfe to 
fpirits, which are Ibid through the whole country, to the no 
Imall hurt of their health, as well as their morals.

Copy of a letter from Robert Riddell,\^; of Glenridde.Uf 
to Sir John Sinclair, Bart. 

Sir John, 

I inclofe you a letter, wrote by Mr Burns, as an addition 
to the account of Dunfcore pariih. It contains an account 
of a fmall library, which he was fo good, (at my defire) as to 
fet on foot, in the barony of Monkland, or Friar's Carfe, in 
this parifli. As its utility has been felt, particularly among 
the younger clafs of people, I think, that if a fimilar plan 
were cftablifhed,in the different parifhes in Scotland, it would 
tend greatly to the fpcedy improvement of the tenantry, 
trades people, and work people. Mr Burns was fo good as 
take the whole charge of this fmall concern. He was trea-

SIR, 

THE following circumftance has, I believe, been omitted 
in the Statiftical Account, tranfmicted to you, of the parifh 
of Dunfcore, in Nithfdale. I beg leave to fend it you, be- 
caufe it is new, and may be ufeful. How far it is deferving 
.of a place in your patriotic publication, you are the bcft 
judye. 

To ftore the minds of the lower clafles with ufeful know- 
It^dge, is certainly of very great confequence, both to them 
as individuals, and to fociety at large. Giving them a turn 
for reading and refleftion, is giving them a fource of inno- 
cent and laudable amufement ; and befides, raifes them to a 
more dignified degree in the fcale of rationality. Imprefled 
with this idea, a gentleman in this parifh, Robert Rid-

»ELL, Efq; of Glenriddel, fet on foot a fpecies of circulaU 
ing library, on a plan fo fimplc, as to be practicable in any 
corner of the country ; and fo ufeful, as to deferve the no- 
tice of every country gentleman, who thinks the improver 
ment of that part of his own fpecies, whom chance ha$ 
thrown into the humble walks of the peafant and the arti- 
fan, a matter worthy of his attention. 

Mr Riddell got a number of his own tenants, and farming 
neighbours, to form themfclves into a fociety, for the pur- 
pofe of having a library among themfelves. They entered 
into a legal engagement, to abide by it for 3 years ; with a fav- 
ing claufe or two, in cafes of removal to a diftance, or of death. 
Each member, at his entry, paid 5 s. ; and at each of their 
meetings, which were held every fourth Saturday, 6 d. more. 
With their entry money, and the credit which they tobk on 
the faith of their future funds, they laid in a tolerable ftoc^c 
of books at the commencement. What authors they were to 
purchafe, was always to be decided by the majority. At every 
meeting, all the books, under certain fines and forfeitures, by 
way of penalty, were to be produced ; and the members had 
their choice of the volumes in rotation. He whofe name ftood, 
for that night, firft on the lift, had his choice of what volunie 
he pleafed in the whole collection ; the fecond had his choice 
after the firft ; the third after the fecond, and fo on to the 
laft. At next meeting, he who had been firft on the lift at 
the preceding meeting, was laft at this ; he who had been 
fecond, was firft ; and fo on, through the whole 3 years. At 
the expiration of the engagement, the books were fold by auc- 
tion, but only among the members themfclves ; and each 
man had his ftiare of the common ftock, in money or in 
|?ooks, as he chofe to be a purchafer or not. 



At

At the breaking up of this little fociety, which was form* 
cd under Mr Riddell's patronage, what with benefadtions of 
books from him, and what with their own purchafes, they 
had collefted together upwards of 150 volumes. It will 
eafily be guefled, that a good deal of trafti would be bought. 
Among the books, however, of this little library, were, 
Blair's Sermons, Robertfon's Hiftory of Scotland, Hume's 
Hiftory of the Stewarts, the Spectator, Idler, Adventurer, 
Mirror, Lounger, Ohferver, Man of Feeling, Man of the 
World, Chryfal, Don Quixotte, Jofeph Andrews, &amp;c. A 
peafant who can read, and enjoy fuch books, is certainly a 
much fuperior being to his neighbour, who, perhaps, ftalks 
befide his team, very little removed, except in fliape, from the 
brutes he drives.

tEreB'ton. — This parifli was formerly a parfonage, in the 
prefbytcry of Fordoun, and diocefe of Brechin. As the mi- 
nifter found it, at all times, very inconvenient, and in winter 
often impoffible, on account of the deep fnovv on the hills, to

fore, in the year I717, annexed Durris to the prefbytery of 
Aberdeen. 

^Agriculture. — The Norfolk plough is ufed for faughing, or 
ribbing the ground, and plowing light foil. The drill and 
\?heel ploughs are ufed on the haugh ; but the old Scotch 
plough, with low ftilts, is mofl in ufe. The farmers con- 
ftantly employ hired lervants j but moll of them have fub-

Minerals. — On the farm of Monedie, next the river, there 
is a pure, unmixed, ftrong gravel, 2 feet below the furface j 
which the prefent incumbent difcovered, by digging a well. 
About 12 feet deep, there was a ftratum of a perfedlly black 
colour, and about a foot thick, fo extremely hard to dig, that 
the workman, who was employed to dig it at piece work, fe- 
veral times gave it up, declaring that he would be a lofer at 
triple or quadruple the price agreed on. When it was bro- 
ken through, the pieces were full of fhining yellow particles, 
like fpangles of gold ; but after fome hours expofure to the 
open air, they loft their luftre. It appeared, in fome places, 
as if it had been a little fufed by the force of fire. The co- 
lour of the gravel, above and below, and in immediate con. 
tadt with it, was not in the leaft altered. The black gravel, 
from its furface quite through, was of the fame deep black 
colour, and when it was broken into fmall pieces, thefe gold 
like fpangles ftill appeared. Mineralogifts may, poflibly, if 
they have feen or heard of this phenomenon, account for it. 
The water of the well is exceeding fine and foft, and very 
good for wafliing and breaking foap, owing, no doubt, to its 
iaeing filtered through fuch a depth of rough gravel. 

Eminent Perfons. — Bessy Bell, celebrated in fong by our 
Scotch Horace, was defcended from the ancient family of

tfadition, we learn, that there was a peculiar intimacy bfe. 
tween this young lady and Mary Gray, of the houfc of Led- 
nock, a fmall ellate upon the banks of the river Amon, about 
a mile diftant from Kinved ; diftinguifhed beauties, but of 
quite different complexions. In the beginning of that dread- 
ful plague, which lo cruelly ravaged and depopulated this 
country, they retired together to a lonely place, called the 
Burn Urea, to fecure themfelves from the infedtion. A young 
gentleman, whofe name and defcent are not known, but 
who is fuppol'ed to have been a native of the parifli of Mo- 
redie, had a warm and laudable affection for them both, and 
paid them a vifit in their retreat. This vifit was attended 
with fatal conieqiiences ; for, having unhappily imbibed the 
feeds of the yilagae, without perceiving it, the young ladies 
caught the infection, and died. They were both buried in 
one grave, which is ftill pointed out at the head of a heugh, 
on the banks of the Amon. The foundation of their bower 
is alio (hewn on " yon Burn brae." The late proprietor, 
Major Barry, inclofed their burial place with a wall of mafon 
work, with this infcription on one of the ftones in the wall, 
" Bessy Bell and Mary Gray."

Situation f Extent i and Population, — Logie-Amon, or the 
New Parifh, digjoined from the parifhes of Foulis and Mon- 
zie, and annexed, quoad facra^ to the pariih of Monedie, 
lies contiguous to it on the weft fide, and reaches weftward 
to a fmall rivulet, called the Mill- Burn. The river Amo^ 
wafhes it on the fouth, from whence it extends northward to 
the foot of the Grampians. It is about 3 computed miles 
fquare, and has a gradual defcent from the north to Amon, 
and contains, at prefent, between 700 or 800 fouls. 



6o6 APPENDIX. 

S«7, Climate, F el, isfc — The foil adjacent to the river iai 
partly alight loam, and partly gravelly ; on the rifing ground^ 
and towards the hills, the foil is a deep till mixed with mofs. 
The ground next the hills is compofed, partly of muir unfit 
for tillage, fome of which is already planted with fir j and 
partly of mofs of a good quality, and which is now the only 
fuel of the inhabitants, paring the ground for the turf being 
prohibited by the prefent and only proprietor, William 
Drummond, Efq. Rains are frequent, by reafon of its prox- 
imity to the hills. The air is fharp. In ftormy weather, 
with which they are pretty much vifited, they have very high 
winds, efpecially from the weft, which, collefled in, and 
ifluing from, a narrow opening, confined between two high 
hills on the north and fouth, blow with great violence, pu- 
rify the air» and render the climate very healthy, and confe- 
quently populous, few families having below 6 or 7 children, 
and many of them above a dozen. There was one man, in 
the prefent incumbent's time, who had 24 children all bap- 
jtized in the kirk of Monedie. The people commonly live 
long, and many to a great age. They are, in general, fpright- 
ly, flout, handfome men. 

jigriculturey ^c. — All the arable ground was run-rigg till 
3aft year, which greatly retarded, or rather quite prevented, 
improvement ; but the prefent proprietor has wifely abolifh- 
ed the practice. He has divided all the lands into fmall 
:ompa(Sl farms, containing from 20 to 40 acres each, with 
the laudable intention of providing for all his old tenants, 
and (uch of their fons as incline to agriculture. He has al- 
ready, within the fpacc of one year, at confiderable expence, 
reared up 20 neat convenient farm houfes, built with ftones. 
Two of thefe houfes are of two ftories, and garrets ; the reft 
one ftory and a garret each. He defigns to proceed in the

fame manner over his whole eftate, which is very much to 
the fatisfaftion of his tenants, who have readily adopted his " 
plan of improvements, in croping their refpetStive farms,^ 
Laft fuinmer they drove a yaft quantity of lime from Perth, 
allowing about 30, 40, or 50 bolls of fliells to the acre. As the 
length and tedioulnefs of carriage bears rather a little heavy 
on the tenants, he has it in contemplation to try 10 difcover 
marie on his grounds, and entertains hopes of lucceeding. 
The hills have been tried for lime ftone, but without fuccefs. 
The crops, till laft year, were only black oats, bear, potatoes, 
and lint. This laft agrees exceedingly well with the foil, 
producing to the amount of 12I. 14 s. per acre. But they are 
now fowing peafe, and intend to try grafs crops and turnips, 
and it is hoped thefe experiments will fueceed. They have 
already begun to roll after harrowing. They have entirely 
laid afide the old mode of plowing, which was with 4 horfes, 
yoked fide by fide, with a driver, or rather leader, who plyed 
before the horfes, heW them by the head, and travelled 
backwards. They now plow with only 2 horfes, and no dri- 
ver. They fiill retain the old Scotch plough. The feed 
time, for oats, is in April ; for bear, in May. Harveft be- 
gins about the end of September and beginning of Odtobcr^ 
In unfavourable feafons it is later. 

uinimals, — Formerly all the tenants kept Iheep ; but they 
are now reftrided to the farms that are ncareft the hills, 
which are divided into ftieep walks. The horfes and 
cows are, as yet, very little improved. The tenants hitherto 
had their apiaries, the honey of which was in very great re- 
queft, owing, perhaps, to the bees having no other food but 
the bloflbms of heath, and other wild mountainous flowers. 
The hills of Logie-Amon abound with muir fowl, heath 
cocks, and partridges in the corn fields, with ploveus 
in the feafon, and a great number of hares.

Reftis.— The valued rent is 4020 1. Scotch ; the real rent 
about 600 1. Sterling. All the antient fervitudes are con- 
verted into money. The poor arc provided with thofe of the 
old parifhi 

Eccleftaftical State. — The principal part of the inhabitants 
are of the Eftabliflied Church, ihe only Jipifcopals are the 
family of Logic. There are no Roman Catholics, in the 
vtreft of Logie-Amon there is a Seceder church and manfe. 
The minifter has a pretty good living, and rents a farm. 
Moft of the people of the eftablifhed periualion have feats 
in the church, and, from local conveniency, attend Divine 
fervice there ; but communicate in the parifh church. It is 
more than probable, that if there were a preacher or mini- 
fter of the eftablifhed perfuafion fettled among them, they 
would give up the Seceffion. 

Rivers, Bridges, ^c. — The country is interfe£ted with fe- 
veral rivulets defcending from the hills to the river Anion, 
which, a little below their lources, form deep guUies, edged 
and bottomed with rugged precipices and rocks, in all of 
which there are trouts. Thefe gullies are greatly levelled 
with high arches, for the fake of a high-way from Perth to 
Crief. The river Amon takes its rife from the top of a glen 
in the Grampions, called the Narrow Glen^ to the weftward 
of Glen-Amon. It runs through Monzie and i'oulis, walh- 
ing Logie Amon on the fouth, continuing its courfe between 
the parifhes of Methven, Regorton, and Perth, and there falls 
into the Tay. The bed and banks of this river are rocky. 
In many places the water, confined between fteep and high 
rugged rocks, makes a tremenduous appearance, and arrefts 
the eye with a pleafing and aftonifliing fublimiry. There 
are 6 bridges on it. The laft bridge over it was built about

er)r 6 years ago, a little to the weft of the Hcufe of Logic, 
It is a fingle arch of a circlilar form, very high, and 60 feet 
in diameter. The working men, gathering ftones in the bed 
of the river, found, in the filTurcs of the rocky bottom, two 
iGlvcr pieces of King Charles I.'s coin. There is a tradition, 
that the famous Earl of Mbntrofe paffed that part of the ri- 
ver, in his way from the Highlands, where he ufually levied 
his troops, which may perhaps account for the money being 
found there. The pieces, which the incumbent faw, was onfe 
bf them a little larger than our half crown j the other, a little 
bigger than our (hilling, btit thinner; 

Eminent Men.— The obly remarkable perfon known, was 
ihe prefent Mr Drummond's grand uncle, a gentleman highly 
refpefted for his amiable qualities, and hahdfome perfon, as 
Well as diftinguiilied for his great bodily ftrength, and perfo^ 
nal bravery. He was zealouily attached to the houie of 
iStewart, and fignalized himfelf at the battle of Sheriffmuir^ 
in which, after a noble ftruggle, he was overpowered, and. 
taken prifoner. The bulk and weight of his broad fword 
VfiS greatly admired, and thought worthy to be laid up as a 
great curiofity in the Tower of London, where it is faid (till 
to remain. 

Antiquities y b'f.— In the weft corner of the country is a 
ftone 10 or 12 feet high, ftanding inverted upon its narrow- 
end, with 3 large ftones, in an arable field immediately below 
ihe furrow. There is no infcriptioh on them. There is a 
tircle of big ftonfes toward the north corner, fuppofed to be 
an ancient place of worfhip. There are fome, but very im- 
^perfeft veftiges of old buildings, on fome rifing grounds on 
the banks of the Amon, fuppofed, by tradition, to have been 
caftles. There is a quick thorn, of a very antique appear-

ance, for which the people have a fuperftitious veneration. 
They have a mortal dread to lop off, or cut any part of it, 
and affirm, with a religious horror, that fome perfons, who 
had the temerity to hurt it, were afterwards feverely punifh- 
cd for their facrilege. In the boundary between Logie Amon 
and the old parifli, the 3 dioceres of St. Andrew's, Dum- 
blane, and Dunkeld, meet in 3 points, within 2 or 3 yards of 
each other. Tradition has handed down, that the 3 bifliops 
havijig vlfited and perambulated their diocefes at the fame 
time, they met together at thefe extremities, and there being 
•g wells, one at each point, they fat down, and pledged each' 
other out of their refpective wells, one of which ftill re-

SchQol.—^There is a very flourifhing fchoql in Glammlfs. 
The prefent fchoolmafter is eminent in his profeflxon. His 
falary and perquifites amount to about 50 1. Sterling, with a 
good houfe, which, befides his own family, accommodates 
fome boarders. The r^umber of his ^cholars is about 50, at 
an average. 

Cattle. — There are about 1 190 cattle in the parifli ; 272 
horfes, and between 700 and 800 fheep. 

Alifcellaneous Obfervations. — There is one good inn in the' 
village of Glammifs, and 3 alehoufes ; befides two or three 
more of the laft defcription, in different parts of the parifh. 
The number of thefe alehoufes is much reduced of late, 
which is not to be regretted, as they have always been found 
to have a very bad efFecl on the morals of the people. — A 
few farmers in the parilh llill employ cottagers in agricul- 
ture 5 but the generality find, that they get their wprk beft 
done by hired fervants. The tenants are bound to no fer- 
vices, except driving fome coals, if required, and furnifliing 
a proportion of carriages towards the building of their maf- 
ter's houfes. They alfo furnifli carriages for the building 
or repairing of the church and manfe. The fervices for- 
merly required of the tenants, made them little better than 
flaves, — The neareft poft town is Kirriemuir, which is abou^ 
^ miles diftant.
