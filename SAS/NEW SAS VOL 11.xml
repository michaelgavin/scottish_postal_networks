I- — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Boundaries, Dundee, a large manufacturing town 
and parish, is situate on the northern bank of the river Tay, about 
sixty miles from its source, and twelve from the open sea. The 
name was anciently written Dunde or Dundie. Some regard it 
as a contracted form of Dei Donum, which is the designation of 
the town m law Latin. There can be no doubt, however, that 
the word IS Celtic, and was originally either Dunde or Duntaic, 
in Latin Taodunum; the former signifying the Hill of God the 
latter the Hill of Tay,-both probably in allusion to an insulat- 
ed conical hill immediately behind the town, which rises to the 
height of about 525 feet above the level of the river, and which 
would in al probability be the first object to receive a name from 
our Celtic forefathers. 

The parish extends along the river about six miles. At its west- 
ern branch it is about two miles broad, but it gradually narrows 
towards I S eastern limits, at which it strikes off from the rivei- 1 

Z 'J " "iles in a northerly direc 

tion. The Tay forms the boundary of the parish on the south ;

the united parishes of Liff and Benvie on the west; the united 
parishes of Mains and Strathmartine on the north; and the parishes 
of Murroes and Monifieth on the east. 

Climate.— kW those places lying to the south of the line of great- 
est elevation, which runs nearly east and west, possessing not 
only a better exposure to the sun, but also his reflexion from the 
river in summer, and the radiation from it in winter, enjoy a finer 
climate than those situate on the northern aspect. And of all the 
places in the parish, none is better sheltered than the town. But, 
either on account of the exhalations arising from silt of which a 
great extent is uncovered twice every day by the recess of the tide, 
or from the original swampiness of the bottom on which a con- 
siderable part of the town stands, or from the impurity of the at- 
mosphere arising from the smoke of steam-engines used in the ma- 
nufactories, or from the denseness of the population in many dis- 
tricts, or from the negligent habits of the people as to cleanhness, 
or from a combination of several, or of all these causes, the town 
must be regarded as still rather unhealthy. 

Diseases.- ksi\ra, which, however, seems scarcely to impair 
the longevity of those who are affected with it, typhus fever, and 
even dysentery, though not to the same extent as formerly, are still 

in some measure endemic.  i  

In 1819, tvptas fever prevailed to an alarmmg extent, number- 
ing during seven months, 1264 seizures, and 95 deaths. And m 
1 132, malignant cholera made two eruptions, one m July, the other 
n O tobe,; and prevailed more or less tor the same length of time 
as the tylAus of 1819, but at the opposite season, carrjmg ofl 
612 perls out of 808 seized. In 1833, this dreadful malady again 
revisLd the to.n, but though it «s very fatal m certain quarters, 
Seagate and Black's Crof,, it did not become generaUy diffied. 
and the number carried oH by it ,,as comparatively small. Cholera 
has now December 1833 been succeeded "'='"-1'°= 

K,,rfro»mpAy.-Full tide in the estuary of the Tay, which, as 
hafbeen staged, washes the southern limits of the parish, is gene- 
X aTd to oc ur on the days of the new and full moons, at a quar- 
p " two o'clock, but it aows in the harbour of Dundee till about 
h If past two. The average height of the spring tides, as measm- 
ed by a '"dex at the entrance to King William's   
evelteen feet, while that of the neap tides is -''o-  f

down the river ; and this probably is the reason why marine in- 
sects never attack the piles, buoys, or beacons about the harbour. 
The river opposite the town is rather less than two miles broad. 
The channel across is much interrupted by a sand bank, which, 
though formed within the last forty years, has now at full spring 
tides only about ten feet water over its summit ; and at neap tides 
scarcely more than four. Its position is not far from midway across. 
Its form is spindle-shaped ; its length, as seen at low water, upwards 
of a mile ; and its course parallel to that of the river. At present its 
lower or eastern extremity is stretching down in the form of a curve 
concave towards the harbour of Dundee. It is, however, so constant- 
ly altering its features, that no other remark need be made upon 
it, but that it is always increasing in quantity, and slowly moving 
down the river. 

Of the water, which is carried through the town in pipes, there 
is but a very inadequate supply ; and this is the more deeply to be 
regretted, since it has been lately estimated, that for a sum be- 
tween L. 40,000 and L. 50,000, a supply of 200,000 cubic feet 
daily of good water may be obtained from any of three sources at 
no great distance. 

Geologij.~ThQ whole parish, along with all the surrounding 
country, consists of rocks subjacent to the carboniferous strata, 
and mterposed between them and the members of the primitive 
series. Of the last mentioned class of rocks, the nearest to the 
parish is mica-slate, which forms a great part of the Grampian 
range, lying about twenty miles to the north; while the nearest 
coal-pits are m Fifeshire, about fifteen miles to the south. That 
part of the intermediate series which forms the parish of Dundee 
IS composed chiefly of porphyry, sandstone, and amygdaloid, which 
are here mentioned in their apparent order of superposition in an 
ascendmg series. In the sandstone, and especially in the amyg- 
daloid, there also occur included masses and alternating beds of 

• As this bank is an object of great interest, in reference to the navigation of the 
Tay, and as U may be .n,porta„t in some future age to ascertain its prfsent mag,  
tude and pos.tion somewhat accurately, we have thought it might be worth w2 t o

known by the name of the West Protection Wall, a line 817 feet in len h ZT

trap; and the sandstone often possesses such characters, as to 
identify it with the different varieties of what is often called clay- 
stone. The porphyry is most fully displayed on the precipice 
which forms the bank of the river, about two miles west from the 
town. Its colour is brownish-red, and the porphyritic structure is 
indicated by ciTstalliform spots, differing from the basis rather m 
the paleness of their tint than in their composition. It is traversed 
by veins,consistingusuallyof jasper, heavy spar, and sparryiron ore 
with occasionally acicular crystals of manganese. Its junctions w-ith 
the sandstone which usually overlies it, but at other times dips be- 
neath it, are extremely interesting. In some places the transi- 
tion is violent and abrupt, and accompanied by dislocations ; at 
other places the porphyry gradually passes into the sandstone, and 
large masses occur of a structure every way intermediate. The 
physical characters of the two rocks are, indeed, often very similar, 
both being usually of a brick colour, both at some places displaying 
a stratified structure, and at other places both seeming to want it 
The sandstone also is occasionally traversed by veins similar to 
those which have been already described as traversing the porphyry. 
Cn the whole, the phenomena displayed by these two rocks m the 
S alluded 'to Je very interesting. To describe them more 
minutely would be incompatible with the limits of this work But 
" ood dla of them may be formed, by supposing that both rocks 
recited from the same materials, those parts llch contained most 
Xm na and alkaline matter having been softened, and m some 
tres "used and thrust up among the beds of the more sihcious 
tZ thus giving rise to the porphyry; while the moi hcious 
,ar hling been softened merely where most powerfully heated,

Carse of Gowrie on the north and west, has mostly disappeared 
from this parish; leaving only the more durable masses of trap, 
which had been formerly included in it. Such appears to be the 
geological history of the rocks which form the hill of Balgay, the 
Law, and other eminences of whin in the parish. On the eastern 
shoulder of the Law, indeed, the trap is still, at a considerable ele- 
vation, immersed in the amygdaloid, through which a tunnel has 
lately been cut in forming the line of a railway into Strathmore. 
In the place named the Den, at the east end of the town, the junc- 
tion of the sandstone with the trap may be observed, presenting 
phenomena well worthy of the attention of the geologist. Much 
of the trap in the parish is of a tufaceous nature, and though, when 
newly opened upon, seemingly very fit for road metal, moulders away 
in the course of a few months, generally weathering in concentric 
lamella. Nor, indeed, is the trap of the Law much worthy of 
confidence as a road metal. Its most remarkable features are its 
almost resinous lustre and highly conchoidal fracture. Other 
masses of trap in the parish, however, such as that forming the rock 
of the Magdalene Yard, and the quarry near Stobs' Muir, are ex- 
tremely durable. 

Under this head the parish presents httle that is in- 
terestmg. In none of the strata have organic remains so far as 
we are aware been met with, though, in the analogous rocks of 
the neighbourhood, even those of vertebrated animals have been 
lound.- It IS perhaps worthy of remark, that the golden-crested 
wren  Regulus cristatus occasionally nestles in the hill of Balo-av 
and that the water-shrew  Sorex fodiens  is by no means rare in 
the brooks of the neighbourhood. The fish of greatest conside- 
ration m the river is the salmon ; but a description of the manner 
of fishing It belongs more properly to other parishes. Among the 
lavertehrata few species occur worthy of notice. In pools of water on 
the rock at Broughty Ferry, however, a very beautiful Sabella i Cuv  
seemingly the T. Fahricia of the Fauna Grcnlandica, which does 
not appear to have been previously recognized as an inhabitant of 
our country IS to be met with. At the point of- the Magdalene 
Yaid, also, the student will always be able to procure alive, at the 
proper season several interesting zoophytes, and, among other.

B«ta/»/.-The- botany of the parish is also devoid of pecuhar 
interest. It may be merely remarked, that a variety of Centaurea 
scabiosa with white flowers, Potentilla verna, and P.reptans Spirea 
filipendida, and Allium vineale, are met with on the bank of the 
Tay to the west of the town. To the east some rare mosses, 
such as Didymodon ricjidulum, and Grimmia ovata, the latter 
abundantly on the Hare-Craig, occur; and withui water-mark 
the usual species of AkjB, of which Fucus nodosus, F. veszculosus, 
and R canalicidatus, are the most characteristic. In the fissures 
and emptied veins of the red porphyry and sandstone, the Cera- 
mium Rotlvii frequently forms a covering resembling the richest 
crimson velvet.

Accounts oftU P«rfe;..-There is no history of the town and 
mrish. properly so called, of later date than the very able one 
E wa furnished by the late Dr Small in the tortoer Stat,st,-

by Gamble, his own Chaplain, we learn several P--'''""";

under Edward I. It was considered of such consequence in giving 
security for tlie observance of national treaties in the reigns subse- 
quent to that of Robert Bruccj as to rank the third town in Scotland 
after Edinburgh. It bore a large share of the taxes in the reign of 
James I., and of the 1200 merks imposed upon the adjoining 
towns, for fitting out a yacht to bring home the King and Queen 
from Denmark. The proportion paid by -Dundee was 700 merks. 

In the troubled times of Bruce and Baliol, the town suffered 
severely. It was twice taken by Edward I., and as often retaken 
by Wallace and Bruce. In each of the reigns of Richard 11. and 
Edward VI. it was almost reduced to ashes. But it experienced 
its last and most destructive calamity when it was stormed by 
Monck, in the year 1651. It was estimated that not less than a 
sixth part of the inhabitants perished, among whom were many 
strangers of eminence, and not a few respectable clergymen, from 
the south, who had fled thither as to a city of refuge. Besides the 
immense loss of lives and property, the greatest part of the ancient 
records of the town is said to have been carried off or destroyed ; 
and, a seven years' dearth happening about the beginning of the 
following century, the town did not soon recover from the effects 
of these disasters, — indeed, not until several years after the Rebel- 
lion in 1745. 

The union of England and Scotland was doubtless productive 
of many beneficial consequences to both nations, especially to the 
latter ; and if by the loss of our Dutch and French privileges it 
was the occasion of destroying one branch of our trade, that of 
plaiding, or the spinning and weaving of coarse woollens, which 
was then the staple manufacture of the place, it opened up a 
new source of commerce and wealth, in the manufacture of lineiis 
of various kinds, particularly those of coarser fabric, and which go 
under the name of Osnaburghs, canvas, bagging, &amp;c. which are 
exported to the foreign markets, and from which not a few for- 
tunes have been realized. 

The manufacture of cottons was attempted here about 1780, 
but was not found to succeed, and has long since been given up 
The manufacture of thread, for which this town was famous for a 
period of sixty years, and the manufacture of glass, which em- 
ployed at one time about a hundred persons, not having been found 
productive, have been entirely relinquished. The manufacture of 
hnen is now, and for the last fifty years has been, our principal ar- 
ticle of trade ; its diff'erent operations employ the greater part of

the population ; and Dundee is considered, in regard to this kind 
of manufacture, the first town in Great Britam. 

With the increase of the trade and wealth of the place, there 
has been, especially during the last twenty years, an immense ad- 
dition to its size. It has produced many enterpnsmg merchants 
and adventurers. There have been introduced many miprovements 
and inventions, which were unknown to our forefathers, and are the 
boast of later times, and which tend at once to give employment 
to the industrious, to facihtate the intercourse of commerce, and 
to contribute to the sum of human enjoyment. Among these the 
first in the order of time, and perhaps not the least worthy of being 
noticed in any point of view, is the Steam-boat which phes on the 
Tav between Dundee and Newport, on the opposite coast of Fife ; 
of which an account will be found in the sequel under the branch 

of Industry- „ , .j . 

Police Establishment.-ln consequence of the rapid increase 

of the population of Dundee and surrounding district, and the 
ordinary provision of the law for preserving the pubhc peace hav- 
ing become inadequate for the purpose, in 1824, the magistrates, 
with the concurrence of the inhabitants at large, applied to Par- 
liament for an act to provide for the better paving, lighting, watch- 
ing, and cleansing, the burgh, and for building and mamtaining a 
Bllewell there. The bounds comprehended within the Act which 
was readily obtained, were extended considerably beyond the an- 
cient royalty; including Blackness toll upon the west, Clepington 
:;on the no;th, Mayfield upon the east, the f 
being the river Tay. The town, by this Act, is divided into ele- 
ven wards ; each ward yearly elects two genera ai.d wo resident 
commissioiers. The resident ones, who are all head conle. 
of their wards, have a general supermtendence and 1- abo a 
charge of the measures necessary for promoting the peace o the m- 
habifants. To the general commissioners, again, is -orarJ 
general execution of the act. Besides the officers annually elect- 
ed from the different wards, the following are general commis- 
Lrs e. officio, viz. the provost, the four baihes, the dea. of 
guild and councillor, the convener of the town t-des the lenff 
depute and his substitute, residing within the bounds of the pohce. 
The general commissioners elect a superintendent, who is re pon- 
.blefialltheinferiorofficersandvested.

other places of L. 5 of yearly rent. The qualification for a ge- 
neral commissioner is, that he possesses property within the ward 
of L. 10 yearly rent ; and of a resident one, property of L. 5. 

The expense of the establishment is defrayed by an assessment, 
levied according to the rental of all shops, warehouses, and dwel- 
lino'-houses, situate within the limits of the act. The rate of as- 
sessment is fixed by the general commissioners, but cannot exceed 
one shilling and threepence per pound of the rent ; and it has been 
declared that the total sum collected in any one year shall not ex- 
ceed L. 4000. 

The Judges of the Police Court, which sits every morning at 
ten o'clock, are declared to be the provost, the magistrates, and 
dean of guild, the sheriff and his substitute, who are empowered 
to take cognizance of, and to punish crimes committed within the 
bounds of pohce, and also of all offences against the regulation of 
the act ; but in no case can they fine to a gteater amount than 
L. 5, nor imprison for a longer period than sixty days. The 
amount of the assessment levied under the act has never been suf- 
ficient to enable the general commissioners to erect a bridewell, — 
an institution for which there seems to be great need ; and at this 
present time an apphcation is about to be made to Parliament for 
a new act, having for its object, among others, the erection of this 
necessary establishment. 

The police estabhshment has been of essential service to the in- 
habitants, with respect to the protection of their persons and pro- 
perty ; although it cannot be denied that the streets are not much 
improved. The number of watchmen is too limited for the extent 
of the bounds ; and the suburbs, which are generally the haunts of 
the disorderly, are but poorly lighted. 

But as the facilities for lighting the town have been greatly in- 
creased by a late establishment, it is hoped, that, along with the 
provision, the commissioners will ere long be furnished with the 
means of carrying their wishes into effect. For, in the year 1825, 
an event took place of no small importance in the history of the 
town ; this was the establishment of a Gas Company. 

Gas Company. — The proposal originated with some spirited in- 
dividuals. Several attempts had been made, upwards of twenty 
years before the period referred to, in the way of lighting separate 
shops by means of gas ; but as the scale according to which these 
were constructed was too limited, and as the expense was found to ex- 
ceed the profit, the plan had long been abandoned. By means of our 



10 FORFARSHIRE. 

Gas Company, the town and neighbourhood are now supphed with 
a cheap and beautiful light. The work is situate to the eastward 
of the High Street, about a mile; and it sends out light both to 
the north and westward, to the distance of more than two miles. 
Not only are the lamps in the public streets supplied, but likewise 
almost all the shops and spinning-mills, and a great proportion of 

dwelling-houses. , , r j 

The prospect of another Gas Company, threatened to be formed 
sometime ago, induced the proprietors in the original Company to 
reduce considerably the price of their article. The concern is 
understood to be profitable; and it has now partners in Perth, 
Aberdeen, and London, and seems to work so well as to supersede 
the necessity of any other like estabhshment. 

Royalty of the Toion.—TXe privileges of the town of Dundee, 
as a free and royal burgh, are of very ancient date. The place 
appears to have enjoyed many immunities previous to the reign o 
King William, who is supposed to have first erected it into a royal 
burgh in 1210, before conferring the town on his brother, David 
Earl of Huntingdon, and is reported to have granted all the privi- 
leges to Dundee that had been bestowed on the most favoured 
Royal Burghs. 

These rights appear to have been confirmed and enlarged by 
many succeeding princes, in particular, by King James VI. m the 
charter dated Holyroodhouse 1601, and finally by Charles 1. in 

1641. , • 

Civil Constitution of the Burgh.- Accovdmg to this sett or con- 
stitution, the town-council consisted of twenty persons, mcluding 
the magistrates, that is the provost and four bailies, who were elect- 
ed yearly at Michaelmas, as also the dean of gmld and treasurer 
the nine deacons of the trades assembling in the Town-hall, 
alonff with the members of the council, and proceedmg to elect 
■ the new council from leets or lists transmitted them by the magis- 

''The formation of the new council was thus almost entirely de- 
pendent upon their predecessors; and although, to use the words 
of Dr Small, it is due to « the honour of the magistrates to ac- 
knowledge, that in many instances they exerted themselves wid. 
laudable zeal and success in promoting the pubhc ofl 
poration thus constituted, without a greater degree of mtelhgence 
and public spirit than what falls to the lot of ordmary luen, was 
under strong inducement and temptations, to consider that as a i.a- 



DUNDEE.

ternity distinct from the community, and having separate rights." 
As, according to the sett, five ofthe councillors must be taken from 
the guildry, — a body of free merchants, — and as this body had no 
voice in the nomination of these, or of their dean, and as three 
councillors, also, must be taken from any separate three of the in- 
corporated trades, who could vote for these only in the leets sent 
them by the magistrates, a spirit of dissatisfaction, with regard to 
the election of the magistrates, had for a considerable time been 
cherished by the inhabitants ; and, after many remonstrances upon 
the subject, the sett of the burgh, upon the application of the ma- 
gistrates, was altered by the convention of Royal burghs assem- 
bled at Edinburgh in July 1818. By this alteration, the election 
of the dean and of his councillors was vested in the guildry ; and 
the convener of the nine trades, who was chosen by his own body, 
became a member of council. A dispute, however, having arisen 
some years after the alteration of the sett, about the election of 
the Dean of Guild, and the matter having been brought by the dis- 
appointed party before a civil court, the burgh of Dundee was dis- 
franchised by the Court of Session in March 1830; and upon the 
11th of that month, seven persons, members of the late council, 
were appointed by the Court of Session as interim managers of 
the burgh. 

During this interregnum, meetings of the inhabitants were called 
from time to time, in order to consult about the measures to be 
employed in obtaining a new sett of the burgh, and for giving the 
burgesses at large a voice in the election of their rulers. The King 
in Council was petitioned upon the subject ; and a poll election of 
the magistrates and town-council by the burgesses and heritors, in 
virtue of an order by the King in Council, dated 27th April 1831, 
took place in the Cross Church on 10th May, before the sheriffs 
of Forfarshire and Aberdeenshire, and the sheriff-substitute of 
Perthshire as commissioners. The proceedings having been re- 
ported by the sheriffs, an order of the King in Council was issued 
on 27th July 1831, confirming the election of the magistrates and 
council, made by the majority of the electors. The magistrates 
and council thus elected, accepted office on the 30th of July ; and 
on the 23d of August, an act of the 2d of William IV. extending . 
the royalty of the burgh, and jurisdiction of the magistrates, and 
mtroducing new regulations as to the election of magistrates and 
municipal government of the burgh, received the Royal assent. It 
IS provided by this set, that seven of the members of council re- 



12 



FOTIFATISHITIE. 



tire from office annually. The seven new councillors were to be 
elected by the burgesses, and the council was then to appoint in- 
dividuals of its own number to its several offices. 

Since the passing of the Reform Bill for the Burghs of Scotland, 
the election of the members of council is extended to all persons 
residing within the burgh and extended royalty having a right to 
vote for a Member of Parhament, with the exception of the dean 
of guild, who is now chosen by the guild brethren, and who is ex 
officio chairman of the incorporation. The number of councillors 
is twenty-one, being the same as under the former constitution. 
The different offices are appointed by the councillors themselves ; 
and a third of them yearly retire from the council, but may all be 

re-elected. , . , p i 

In consequence of the Reform Bill, Dundee, which formerly, 
along with St Andrews, Cupar, Perth, and Forfar, sent one mem- 
ber to Parliament, has now the privilege of being represented by a 
member of its own choosing. Its first representative in the Re- 
formed Parhament was George Kinloch of Kinloch, Esq. who died 
in London during its first session, and whose place is now supphed 
by Sir Henry Parnell, whose character is well known among poli- 
tical economists by his treatise on Finance. 

Ancient Documents, §-c.— The common burying-ground, or houtt, 
as it is called, lies on the north side of the town, and contains 
about four acres. It is said that Devorgilla, mother of John 
Bahol, competitor for the crown of Scotland, in 1260, founded a 
convent and other religious houses in this ground, which was then 
and long afterwards, used as a garden and orchard. About 200 
years afterwards, Lady Beatrice Douglas, widow of Wilham Earl 
of Errol, granted a sum of money in aid of the common funds, and 
for keeping the convent in repair. An indenture was entered into 
between the Countess and James Lindsay, vice-general of the or- 
der in Scotland, and warden of the convent, that the friars should 
say mass daily at the high ahar for the souls of Lady Beatrice of 
William, her spouse, and of William, their son. The capitular 
act, signed by all the brethren of the convent, is dated at Dundee 

the 25th November 1483. , . , i i 

Soon after the marriage of Queen Mary with Lord Darnley, she 
conveyed to the town the whole church-lands and revenues m and 
adjoining to the town, and, in particular, the site of the demolished 
convent of Franciscan friars, with the garden and orchard, for a 
burying-ground. That the whole ground was not at that tune, at

least, applied to the above purpose, is evident from several inden- 
tures, seisins, and charters, which are still preserved. One of these 
is dated 31st December 1564, entitled on the back, Sasina Tliomce. 
Holland Horti in Vinella Fratrum Conventualiuvi. The seal of 
the convent is appended, upon which is this inscription : " Sigil- 
lum commune Conventi de Dund." This, together with another 
seisin dated August 1574, is in the possession of Mr Charles Roger, 
merchant in Dundee. A chapel in the neighbourhood of the bury- 
ing-ground is still standing, and was formerly used as a place of 
worship for the methodists. The ruins or foundation of the other 
parts of the convent are often laid bare in the digging of graves ; 
and lately, the sextons discovered a leaden pipe about eight feet 
deep, and three inches in diameter, which went in the direction of 
the convent, and appeared to have come down from St Francis' 
Well, which also belonged to the convent, and which had seemed 
to supply them with water.  

Eminent Men. — Among eminent characters connected with the 
parish by birth, residence, or burial, are Alexander Scrymseor, one 
of Wallace's heroic companions, whom he put in possession of the 
hereditary dignity of constable : also Sir John Scrymsoure, after- 
wards Viscount of Dudhope, who, in his adherence to Charles I. 
perished in the battle of Marston Muir, and whose son was creat- 
ed Earl of Dundee. The chiefs of this family were hereditary stan- 
dard-bearers of Scotland ; and they continued to be represented 
by the Scrymseoures of Birkhill and of Wedderburn. 

There are also to be noticed under this head Robert Pitilloch, now 
called Patullo, who distinguished himself in the wars of Charles VII. 
of France, particularly on the expulsion of the English from Gasco- 
ny : James Halyburton, uncle to Halyburton of Pitcur, one of the most 
able promoters of the Reformation, who was provost of Dundee for 
thirty-three years, and whose funeral, from gratitude and respect to 
his memory, was defrayed at the pubhc expense : and the famous 
Sir William Wallace, who is reported to havereceived his education 

• In the street caUed the Sea- Gate, the most ancient part of the town, and in which 
stood the former Tolbooth, the stones showing the foundation of which are still to 
be seen, a spot is pointed out where, in the times of ignorance a.id bigotry, one 
Onzzel Jeffrey was burnt for witchcraft. The tradition is familiar to every native of 
Dundee; and not many years ago, when a gentleman of the law profession, from 
ii-clmburgh, was searching the records of tlie council and guildry, he discovered the 
wliolc of the documents relative to the horrible transaction,_a deed which seems to

Sir James Ivory is a native of Dundee, now F. R. S. L. and

every branch of mathematical science, and not excelled in that 
department by any philosopher of Europe, and upon whom his 
Majesty William IV. has conferred the honour of Knight- 
hood. 

Last, though not least, is to be ranked the late Reverend Dr 
Small, who was for many years parish minister, and author of the 
former Statistical Account of Dundee ; a man of a sound under- 
standing, of considerable hterary attainments, and an able preacher 
of the Gospel. He was distinguished also for his philosophical 
researches, was the intimate friend of the late celebrated Professor 
Playfair, and himself the author of a profound work in astronomy 
entitled Kepler's Discoveries. 

Land-oioners. — The chief land-owners are the Heirs of the late 
Alexander Guthrie of Craigie ; Lord Douglas of the lands of Clay- 
pots, Milton, and West Ferry; William Stirhng Graham of Dun- 
truin; David Blair of Craighill; George Kirkaldy of Baldouie ; 
Patrick Kerr of Drumgeills ; John Alison of Montpelier ; Mungo 
Dick of Pitkerro; William Brown Constable of the Wallace 
Craigie; James Lorimer of Kellyfield; David Rankine of Dudhope; 
David Arklay of Clepington ; the Heirs of Alexander Thoms of 
Wester Clepington; David Hunter of Blackness. But this last 
estate, as well as those of Logie and Balgay, are said to lie in this 
parish only quoad sacra. None of these, except the lands of Dun- 
trum and those on the Douglas estates, have been above 100 years 
m possession of the family of its present proprietor. 

Parochial Registers.— The register of births and baptisms, and 
that of marriages, both began in 1645, and are continued, without 
interruption, till the present time. The former occupies six vo- 
umes, the latter four volumes. The records of the kirk-session 
begin in 1682, and come down also to the present time. These 
registers are regularly and distinctly kept.

The iron rod, as tradition reports, about three feet in length,

In 1831, while the workmen were clearing away the old houses 
and rock from the ground intended as a new street from the Cross 
to the Meadows, at the top of the Mint Close, they discovered the 
remains of our ancient mint, which was erected by Robert Bruce 
m 1311. The smelting furnace was almost entire. 

Coiogate Port— In order to defend Dundee from the attacks of 
enemies, the town in ancient times was surrounded by a dauble 
wall ; and in each of the streets leading to the west, north, and east, 
were two gates or ports. There is now scarcely any part of the wall 
remammg, except a few yards at the burying-ground ; and as the 
ports had ceased not only to be useful, but had become inconve- 
nient, these were removed about sixty years ago, except the Cow- 
gate Port, which IS still kept in good preservation. 

This port has been allowed to stand, and has lately been re- 
paired, from respect to the memory of the famous Mr George 
Wishart, and his affectionate services to the inhabitants of Dun- 
dee during the dreadful plague in 1544. At that time, this mi- 
nister IS said to have preached from the top of the Cowgate Port 
from Psalm evil 20: " He sent his word and healed them, ani 
delivered them from their destruction ;"-the diseased being re-

subject. From calculations made by the late Dr Small, it would 
appear that the population in 1651 was about 8047. From that 
time it rapidly decreased, in consequence, no doubt, of many leav- 
ing- the town from the horrors of the massacre, and the uncertainty 
and troubles which followed the siege; so that in 1746 the inha- 
bitants are said to have been only 5302. After that period a 
rapid increase must have taken place ; for, from actual enumera- 
tions, we know that 

In 1766 the population was 12,426 
1781 - - 15,700 
1788 - - 19,329 

The state of the population subsequently, as taken from the go- 
vernment census, is as follows : 

In 1801 - . 26,804 

1811 - - 29,616 

1821 - - 30,575 

1831 - - 45,355 

In this last return there are of males 20,910, and of females 
24,445. 

The account of 1831 is exclusive of seafaring persons, who can- 
not be estimated at less than 2500. The cause of the extraordi- 
nary increase in population since 1821, is to be ascribed, perhaps, 
chiefly to the great advancement in the linen trade, which has pro- 
duced so many spinning-mills, and led to the extension of the har- 
bour; and which, by giving employment to thousands, has encou- 
raged early marriages, as well as brought families from other parts 
of Scotland and from Ireland. 

The number of inhabitants in the town and suburbs is 44 200

At the same time, in regard to the accuracy of this list, it must be

tive Dumfries-shire. Public amusements, and especially theatrical 
ones, have been on the decline ; and a more rational, healthy, do- 
mestic tone of liappiness has been introduced. The people have 
been improving in their style of living, and in their dress. The 
hodden grey and broad bonnets, for the manufacture of which Dun- 
dee was once famous, are almost abolished. A few patriarchs 
from the neighbouring country exhibit now the only specimens of 
this ancient costume. A flask of claret, which our forefathers 
drank without duty, cannot now escape the tax to the crown ; and 
the illicit prowler from the hills, who formerly stole into the town 
under the cloud of night with his poney and his kegs, has become 
a productive labourer of the soil, and no longer contends with the 
exciseman. Brokers have been increasing, the bane of the poor, 
who may prefer their cordial to their family. City vices no doubt 
prevail to a great extent ; but, on the whole, there is a buoyant spirit 
of intelligence, enterprise, assiduous labour, and successful specula - 
tion, as will be seen when we come now to the department of In- 
dustry.

Dundee and Broughty Ferry, are generally good, and let at the 
highest rents. The south banks of Duntrune, Drumgeith, and 
Baldovie estates, on the north-east side of the parish, are of o-ood 
deep soil. But Pitkerro, which adjoins these lands, and is almost 
on the same level with the two last, is dry and thin. Claypots a

Live Stock. — There are no sheep bred or fattened for sale within 
the parish. The Dundee fleshers purchase their sheep fat in the 
north country markets, and keep them till they have occasion for 
them in grass parks in the neighbourhood in summer, and feed 
them with turnips in winter. There are few cattle but milch cows 
kept. Those kept in the town are of all kinds ; those belonging 
to the farmer are selected with care. None of the short-horned 
breed, however, have yet been introduced, their superior qualities 
being httle known in this part of the country. 

Husbandry. — The farm-buildings are pretty good. The greater 
part of them are built of stone and lime, and slated. They are of 
a square form generally,the space within being used as a straw- 
yard for cattle. The fences are stone dikes, with a few hedges ; 
but httle attention is paid to fences near the town, where there is 
no pasturage. At a distance, particularly at Craigie, Pitkerro, and 
Duntrune, where the fields are let for pasture, the fences are in the 
best state. The dikes are substantially built of stone, from four to 
five feet high, and cost for building about 10s. per rood. 

The ordinary length of the lease of a farm is nineteen years. 
The rent is paid in money; but sometimes estimated in grain, as 
well as in money, converted according to the fiars of the year. The 
terms of payment are Candlemas and Lammas for the half years 
preceding these terms respectively. 

The land under tillage may be said to be in a very improved 
state, no labour nor expense being spared to render it highly pro- 
ductive; and there are no particular obstacles to improvement.

The materials for these manufactures are obtained from Russia, 
Prussia, Holland, and Brabant, chiefly from the two first ; and the 
conveyance of them employs a great number of ships and seamen.

Thirty years ago almost all the hnen 


yarns used 


in the 


manu- 



factures here were hand-spun, — some of them in town, and the re- 
mainder in the country adjacent. At that time the expense of spin- 
ning alone was about equal to that of the yarn at present ; while the 
quahty of the article was very inferior to what is now made. The in- 
troduction of machinery for spinning hnen yarn has been the com- 
mencement of a new era in our manufactures,— the starting post 
from which all our improvements in trade and commerce have 
rapidly advanced. Unless steam power had been successfully ap- 
plied to the production of a better article, and a more adequate 
supply than ever the distaff or the spinning-wheel could have pro- 
duced, the hnen trade had never been carried on to any great ex- 
tent, nor had we been able to cope successfully, either in the home 
or foreign markets, with countries where provisions and wages are 
lower, and less expense is incurred on the raw material.

In 1811, there were only four spinning-milb in Dundee driven 
by steam-engines, making altogether about sixty-one horse-power ; 
converting into yarns about one and a-half tons of flax per day, or 
468 tons annually, and producing about 224,640 spindles of yarn 
The whole capital then invested in machinery m Dundee did 
not exceed L. 22,000, and the whole flax imported into the whole 
of Scotland was then about 7000 tons. At present 1832 there 
are upwards of thirty flax spinning-mills in Dundee and the im- 
mediate neighbourhood, driven by a steam P07«Vaa nnn 
horses, consuming 15,600 tons of flax, and producing 7,488,000 
spindles of yarn per annum, while the sum invested niachinery 
has been estimated at L. 240,000. In these mills about 3000 
persons are daily employed. Of these there are under eighteen years 
of age, 1073 individuals ; under fourteen, 600 ; some under twe ve, 
and even from six to seven years of age. The number of manufac- 
turers is by last census, 363 ; and the number of famihes employed 
in the different departments of the linen trade is 6828; to whidi 
wages to theamountof L. 156,000 a-year are understood to be paid 
More than one-half of those employed in the mills are boys and 
girls from ten to eighteen years of age; the remamder are partly 
men and partly women of all ages. 

The time of labour daily in the mills at present is twelve and a- 
half hours, exclusive of the time allowed for meals ; which is half 
an hour for breakfast, and the same time for dinner. The work 
commences at about half-past five o'clock in the morning, and 

closes at seven in the evening. • i ,,1.. 

The following are the average wages at present paid at the 
mills, and generally in the linen manufacture D-e'  
flax-dressers from 10s. to 12s. weekly ; girls and boys, 3s. to 6s 
women, 5s. to 8s.; weavers, 7s. to 10s.; mill-wrights, 14s. to 

hese wages, though much lower than they once were, owing 
to the altered state of the prices of goods, as well as of the 
ate of wages in the country, yet, from the generally moderate rate 
of provisions in Dundee, the economy and prudence used in the 
m'ilies of the operatives, and their having f 
are understood to afford to the persons engaged - f 
nufacture here, as many comforts as are -.17..

tives of Ireland, who, from the low rate of wages they are accus- 
tomed to at home, are supposed to have contributed to the reduc- 
tion of the wages of labour here much below their proper level. 

The yarns are generally sent from the mills to the bleachfield, 
or to the plash-mill, to be washed or whitened and prepared for 
the loom. No running water being found in the immediate vici- 
nity of the town suitable for these purposes, the operations of 
cleansing and whitening are carried on at the distance of two or 
three miles in the beautiful vale of the Dighty. Some of the 
merchants import their own flax, spin their own yarns, manufac- 
ture them into cloth, and export the cloth to the various foreign 
markets. But more frequently the spinners sell their yarns to the 
manufacturers, who either have looms of their own, or employ 
others who have looms in their own houses. Some kinds of cloth 
require more conveniences than others, and for these factories are 
erected, and looms of a particular construction prepared. The 
loom used generally is the common one with the fly-shuttle. 
Some very broad looms are employed for weaving floor-cloths for 
painting, for waggon-covers, and other purposes. Power-looms 
have not been employed here, or at least not to any advantage, 
and they are understood to be entirely laid aside. 

In weaving sail-cloth and other heavy goods, men only are em- 
ployed. Biit the women are employed in the lighter fabrics, and 
perform their work as well as the men. Formerly the women 
were employed in spinning only, and some of the very coarsest ma- 
terial is still hand-spun. But the general use of machinery has 
almost wholly superseded that of the spinning-wheel, and sent the 
females to a less appropriate labour for their support. Old men 
and old women no longer able to undergo the labour of the loom, 
and young persons of both sexes not yet strong enough for that 
work, are employed in winding for the warper and the weaver, 
and thereby contribute something to the general funds of the fa- 
mily. 

The following extract from the books of the custom-house, 
contaming the returns connected with our staple for the quarter 
endng the 5th January 1832, may serve to give to persons at a 
distance a not unfavourable specimen of the state of the Hnen ma- 
nufacture m Dundee at the present time.

fited. But it is extremely difficult to legislate betwixt master and 
servant in all cases ; and it will be found, on inquiry, that the wants 
of the parents, more than any desire on the part of their employers, 
have crowded our manufacturing establishments with very young 
persons ; while an avidity for higher wages than the manufacturers 
could afford to give for a shorter period, has induced them some- 
times to protract their labour beyond what is good for their health. 
After every drawback, however, persons visiting the mills and ma- 
nufactories will see with pleasure the appearances of health and 
cheerfulness every where exhibited. In health, every precaution 
is taken to guard against disease ; and when any epidemic prevails, 
every attention is paid to such as are overtaken by it, and all due 
means used for their recovery. 

As to the influence of our manufactures on morals, it is to be 
regretted that wherever multitudes of human beings congregate, 
good morals are endangered. In almost all our public works there 
are dissolute .parents, and consequently neglected children, whose 
bad example acts on the mind and the heart as a tainted atmo- 
sphere does on the body. But there is nothing in the hnen trade 
less friendly to good principles and good conduct than in works of 
a similar kind ; and it is due to the mill-masters to state, that most 
if not all of them have estabHshed schools for the instruction of 
their servants, and that some of them devote not a little time and 
attention personally to the education of those who are employed in 
their works. 

One other remark connected with this subject suggests itself 
here. It is well known that not a year passes by without accidents 
occurring to both old and young persons employed about machi- 
nery; and these accidents are often so severe, as not only to lay 
aside those who receive them from working for a long time, but 
even to maim them for ever after, and thereby to disqualify them 
from earning their livelihood. Might not a method be devised to 
meet such exigencies as these  If a weekly contribution from each 
of the operatives, at the rate of one penny for every crown earned, 
and an annual assessment on the masters proportioned either to the 
steam power, or to the number of hands employed by them, were 
thrown into one fund, and well managed, it would not only meet 
these cases as they occur, but in a little time would form such a 
fund as would render weekly payments unnecessary.

a considerable share of the commerce of Scotland, as, indeed, 
might be expected from the great advantages of its situation in 
1569, perhaps the remotest period to which authentic records o 
the state of the shipping here reach, we find that the principal par 
of the fleet sent in pursuit of the worthless Bothwell consisted of 
three ships supplied by Dundee. In 1651, when the town was sur- 
prised and sacked by General Monck, one hundred ships, as before 
stated, were found to belong to it, of which sixty were loaded w th 
booty captured by the besiegers. It is not improbable, how .r 
that some vessels from other parts had taken refuge --o.ihe 
onlY strong-hold that had hitherto successfully resisted the gold or 
tWprowess of the invaders. From the year 1652 the progressive 
ncrease of the trade and commerce of Dundee showed the e asti- 
city of the national character, not easily nor permanently subdued 
Y Jt it was not until the middle of the following century, when the 
people of Scotland began to prize and to take advantage of then 
L7nection with alarger, better cultivated, and -her -n 
our trade and commerce showed signs not only of hfe, but also ot 
health and vigour.

It was only in 1816 that the first great impulse was given to

for investing the management of it for a term of years in distinct 
commissioners. These commissioners were selected partly from 
the magistrates, and partly from other public bodies of the town. 
Much pains were taken to procure the most approved plans ; and 
after all preliminaries had been settled, the work was begun, and 
carried on with extraordinary spirit ; every thing was done in the 
most substantial manner ; and yet long within the time contem- 
plated, the present harbour, consisting of a wet dock of about six 
acres, — a tide harbour of much greater extent, — a graving-dock 
capable of containing at once three of the largest class of mer- 
chant vessels frequenting the Tay,— extensive carpenters' and other 
yards for ship-building, &amp;c.,— wide and spacious quays, affording 
birthage for about thirty vessels to load or discharge at the same 
time,— was happily completed. From the moment this superior ac- 
commodation was begun to be provided, the number and tonnage 
of our ships increased, and, of course, the extent of the trade and 
commerce of the port was greatly enlarged. 

Works so extensive, and from their nature so difficult to erect, 
necessarily created a very great expense ; but that expense has 
been incurred judiciously, and to great advantage, both to the trust 
and to the public. From 1815, the date of the commencement

When the plan for the new harbour was adopted m 181o, t 
was considered to be so extensive, especially when compared w,th 
Xt preceded it, that it was generally believed that Ae acconv- 
modation it promised would exceed the necessities of the trade of 
Sundee for very many years to come. It was soon discovered, 
however, that this opinion was not correct, Severa years since, 
ie wan of sufficieiU birthage was matter of complaint; and mea- 
surer were taken as soon as possible for having the ground of ,s

provements rendered necessary by the daily increasing trade and 
commerce of the town. This work is already begun ; and from 
the arrangements made already, and the well-known activity of 
those concerned, it is expected to afford the necessary accommo- 
dation to the shipping in a very short time.

There are several le-fishing companies, which have

any very formidable opposition. The only thing likely to inter- 
fere with a monopoly, of which there is no complaint on the part 
of the public, will be an attempt to establish a conveyance by steam 
betwixt Dundee and London, which the present company will pro- 
bably anticipate. The smacks belonging to Dundee are not ex- 
celled by any of their class anywhere, nor can vessels be better 
found, or more skilfully navigated; yet such is the preference 
given to the steam-packets, that many who were wont to go to Lon- 
don by the Dundee smacks now find their way thither by Leith 
or Aberdeen.  

In 1830, the Dundee, Perth, and London shipping-company 
purchased the vessels in the trade between Dundee and Leith, and 
added that to their other business. At present they employ alto- 
gether twenty-five vessels; and sail one or more of them twice 
a-week regularly to London, Leith, and Glasgow, and every alter- 
nate day to Perth. The smacks in the London trade are from 150 
to 200 tons burden ; the others of different sizes, are adapted to the 
trade in which they are employed. Those intended for the accom- 
modation of passengers are elegantly fitted up. 

In describing the state of our navigation, the passage-boats on 
the river betwixt Dundee and Newport must not be overlooked. 
Prior to the estabhshment of steam-boats on this passage, the 
small saihng-boats were both unpleasant and often dangerous. 
Smce the establishment of the present conveyance, the public have 
reaped the greatest benefit from it. There are two steam vessels, 
consistmg of twm boats of sufficient size, and worked each of them 
by two sufficiently powerful engines. The thoroughfare is great, 
and would be much increased, provided the Pettycur passage was 
better. As it is, more than 90,000 persons have passed this ferry 
in twelve months, besides horses, carriages, and many cattle. 
Uwing to causes which are not generally understood, the funds of 
this ferry are said to be not in the most prosperous state,-an evil

'° H irr_ln noticing othlr branches our industry we 
must not omit the state of om horticulture. Dundee has been 
Zg rlus for its vegetables: so plentiful ieap are th y 
that even the poorest of the people may eas.ly obtam them, »hle 
e rkh hive access to the finer and more expensrve product.ors 
of t e garden, and even of the hot-house, on very reasonable 

rms mr: are about eighty acres occupied hb 
hood of the town in raising vegetables for the Dundee marke , 
bu great quantities are brought from a i''--  
supply is good and ample. The average annual value of garden 
3s raised for sale within the parish does not exceed L 2000 

the netghbourhood of Dundee has long been drstmgurshed for 
its ruL In August, September, and October, large quantrt.es 
 d in the opi market from the orchards and gardens m the 
of G riTstrathmore, &amp;c. and in some of the frmt-shops

t offruH so d rOundei is not less than L.3000; tlrere bemg

OnrUrs a considerable addition has been made to our imr- 

serLounds ; one establishment alone occupies about fifteen acres, 



DUNDEE.

forty-five millions of plants of various kinds, making an average of 
four and a-half millions annually. 

In gardening, as in most other things, what is necessary and pro- 
fitable, rather than what is more ornamental and pleasing, is first 
studied. But the one generally follows the other at its proper 
distance ; and while other places have, in the progress of their 
improvement, exhibited these in beautiful combination, Dundee 
has not been regardless of what has been doing elsewhere. In- 
deed, the taste for the fairer and more admired productions of the 
parterre and the green-house, which prevails in our neighbourhood, 
has been rapidly increasing, and has been greatly encouraged and 
promoted by the formation of a district horticultural society. This 
society was estabhshed in 1824, and numbers among its members 
most of the nobility and gentry in the neighbourhood. It holds 
Its meetings at least twice a-year, and at its competitions the va- 
riety, excellence, and abundance of the fruits, roots, flowers, and 
vegetables exhibited, have justly called forth expressions of ad- 
miration. In every department this society has been of use ; in 
ornamental gardening it has been eminently useful. It has awak- 
ened an attachment to the loveliest objects of cultivated nature ; 
given a taste and elegance to minds that otherwise had been en- 
grossed by very different scenes; and diffused a spirit of simplicity, 
of purity, and of benevolence, inseparable from the study of na- 
ture in her most lovely forms. The collections of some of the 
amateur members are truly admirable, and may compare with any 
m Scotland. From the garden of one of the friends of this so- 
ciety originated the justly admired double varieties of the Ayrshire 
rose Rosa arvensis, or single white rambling rose. In the space 
of a few falls of ground this gentleman, who marks his attachment 
to the queen of flowers by calling his dwelling-place by her name, 
possesses a collection of roses and other flowers rarely met with. 
Havmg gathered the berries of the common Ayrshire rose, he 
reared from them a number of plants, some of which have produ- 
ced flowers equalling in beauty some of the dwarf garden roses. 
Others have successfully followed this example, and thus has been 
propagated a new species of double climbing roses, which in a few 
years may exhibit an endless series of rich and beautiful varieties. 

Tropical exotics are rare here. There are, however, some tole- 
rable collections of Cape, Australasian, and other green-house 
plants, and also a great variety of hardy ornamental exotics. One 
gentleman has some of the finest varieties of the Auricula:, Felar- 



38 FORFARSHIRE. 

gonia, and Georcjince, with various other elegant plants. Another 
gentleman has from twenty to thirty vaneties of the Camelha, and 
a select assortment of other tender exotics, m a green-house of 
only a few feet in extent, the back part of which is occupied by 
an Liary ; the whole superintended by himsel in the in ervaW 
active life,-an example most worthy of imitation. In all the 
nurseries good collections are kept of hardy ornamental trees and 
"border flowers, roses, eglantine, &amp;c. In the open air the 

which scarcely resist the severity of the winter in he vie nity ot 
London, remlin here almost uninjured; as do myrtles and i. 
sL, V rUnas, and some other Australasian plants when planted 
out against wa Is and protected against the severest frosts of win er 
7Sl-n,.-There was once a number of tanners m Dundee; but 
there are not more than two considerable works now,-employing 
but a very few hands. The supply of native hides is good ; bark 
is brought from England and the contment, an dij.d hi in

In the above sum the amount actually paid in Dundee is noted. 
The tax on tea, &amp;c. is paid in London and elsewhere, and would 
add greatly to the above. The taxes on candles, beer, and hides 
have been abolished; while those on glass, soap, &amp;c. have not 
been received, — there being, as formerly stated, no works of those 
kinds in Dundee at present. Although the tax continues to be 
paid on the whole of these articles consumed in the parish, the last 
item in the preceding statement is calculated on an average of the 
present population with that of 1792, and the average is taken at 
not more than two-thirds of the probable amount, — makino- the 
whole paid in cess and taxes for the town and parish at least 
L. 196,392, 5s. Id. Sterling.

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market Towws.— Dundee is the market town not only of the pa- 
rish, but the district. The market days are Tuesday and Friday ; 



40 



FORFARSHIRE. 



on the former, manufactures of all kinds are sold, together with ar- 
ticles of provision ; on the latter, in addition to these, grain. From 
the fertile district of the Carse of Gowrie, the upland parishes on 
the north, the rich tract that lies to the eastward, and from Fife, a 
plentiful supply of provisions and grain is at all times brought to 
the town. The fish-market is well and cheaply supplied ; haddock, 
cod, ling, flounders, skate, and sometimes turbot, are caught at the 
mouth oi the Tay ; fish from the south coast of Fife are sometimes 
conveyed to the town in carts, and women from Achmithie carry 
crabs, lobsters, and dried fish to Dundee,— a distance of twenty-four 
miles, and return with the price in the evening. These women are 
particularly strong and active. The Tay is also supplied with sal- 
mon in its season. The markets for provisions in Dundee, whe- 
ther as regards the quality or cheapness of the articles, are not 
excelled by any in the kingdom. 

The villages of Lochee and Broughty Ferry are partly in tlie 
parish of Dundee; the former being about two miles distant, the 

latter about four. . 

Means of Communication.— Bundee, from its situation, has am- 
ple means of communication with other places, both by land and 
water. The coast road to Aberdeen passes through the town, and 
there are turnpike roads to Cupar Angus, Forfar, and Brechin 
The mail and other coaches to Aberdeen pass and repass daily. A 
coach starts in the morning direct for Glasgow, and the intercouie 
through Fife by means of several coaches connects Dundee inti- 
mately with Edinburgh. In addition to these, there are conveyan- 
ces which in summer minister to the health and pleasure of the in- 
habitants. Arumbhng, though capacious vehicle has hitherto phed 
betwixt Dundee and Broughty Ferry for the benefit of sea-bathers. 
The steam-boats to Perth invite passengers at an easy fare to a 
trip up the Tay, affording a prospect of uncommon beauty ; and of 
late the experiment has been tried, though not successfully, through 
the summer months, of plying a steam-boat betwixt Dundee and 

'fail-road.-ln 1825 a rail-road was projected to connect Dun- 
dee with Newtyle, and in 1826 was begun to be constructed, it i. 
now completely opened, and coaches and waggons are emploj- 
d to ca'ry passengers and goods. The ength of the i.i -oad 

is eleven miles, and the cost "l-". L' oO

it is carried through a tunnel 340 yards in length, to the north side 
of the Law of Dundee. There are other two inclined planes be- 
fore reaching Newtyle. Up these planes the carriages are drawn 
by means of fixed steam engines. This rail-road will be of great 
importance in connecting the fertile district of Strathmore with Dun- 
dee and the navigation of the Tay. Goods are already carried on 
it at one-third the expense formerly paid on the turnpike. The 
carriages are now impelled by locomotive engines. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The early ecclesiastical state of Dundee is 
covered with much obscurity. The principal church in former 
times was St Clement's, dedicated to the tutelar saint of the town. 
It stood on the site of the present town-house. In the neighbour- 
hood of this place stone coffins and other remains of a burial ground 
have of late years been discovered. 

The church that has been used as the parish church since the 
Reformation was called St Mary's. It was built towards the end 
of the twelfth century by David Earl of Huntingdon and Garioch, 
brother of William I. Returning, it is said, from the Holy Land, 
he was overtaken by a tempest at sea, and when in danger of ship- 
wreck, vowed that, if spared, he would erect a church to the mother 
of our Lord on the spot where he reached the shore. Having en- 
tered the Tay in safety, and gained the land, he was not unmind- 
ful of his vow; for his danger and deliverance, together with the 
pious purpose which he formed, are all commemorated by the re- 
mains of the edifice, which, with its splendid tower, still graces our 
town. 

Tradition says that this church was destroyed by Edward 1. If 
so, it was again destroyed in the time of Edward VI. by the Eng- 
lish, who were in possession of Broughty Castle. In 1588, the 
cross part of the building, which seems to have been in ruins, was 
roofed m ; and what is now called the South Church, was used, 
along with .the old church, the choir of the original building, as 
a place of worship. In 1759, the part which is now occupied bv 
the Cross Church was fitted up as a Chapel of Ease, and a cate- 
chist appointed. In 1789, the Steeple Church was built, and this 
and the Cross which has been rebuilt in 1829 erected into 
churches. After the Reformation, there seems to have been two 
mmisters who officiated in the Old and South Churches. To these 

since riTor ''''' '"' a"-angement has continued 
since. In 1789 two more were added by the erection of the Cross 



42 FORFARSHIIIE. 

and Steeple Churches,— there being four churches and five mi- 
nisters in the same edifice. 

The appearance of these churches, with their lofty, massy, and 
time-worn tower, is on the whole imposing. From their situation 
they are highly ornamental, and they are convenient, too, as places 
of worship. The tower which adjoins their western end is 156 feet 
in height. The top is surrounded with a battlemented stone rail, 
and on the summit stands a small house, which disfigures the,beauty 
of the structure. The use or object of this house it is idle to con- 
jecture. 

In 1823, St David's Church, in North Tay Street, was erected. 
Built by the Independents in 1800, and used by them for several 
years, it is now an Established church, handsomely fitted up, con- 
taining nearly 2000 sitters, and most convenient for the population 
on thf north-west of the town. By the constitution of this church, 
the town-council became bound to erect an additional church, when 
the three incumbents then in the Old and South Churches should 
be removed, the New Church to be supphed by one of their suc- 
cessors. By this arrangement every minister wdl have m time his 
own church and congregation. i , 

Dundee has three chapels of ease,— St Andrew s Chapel, built 
in 1772 by the kirk-session and trades, and still under their ma- 
nagement; the Chapelshade Chapel, built in 1789 by a Relief 
congregation, and now in connection with the Church of Scotland ; 
and a small Gaelic Chapel, in which our Highland population hear 
the ffospel preached in their mountain tongue. _ 

The minister of the first charge of Dundee has a stipend of 
twenty chalders, which, by the fiars of 1831, produce about 
L. 309; he has also L. 10 in money; a glebe of five and a-half 
acres, worth, for cultivation, about L. 5 an acre ;-m aU about 
L 347. _ and lately he has obtained a substantial manse. 
The stipends of the other five ministers are L. 275 each In bt 
Andrews and Chapelshade Chapels the stipends are about L.200. 
In the former an assistant is employed, in consequence of the men- 
• tal affliction of the incumbent. The Gaelic minister, in addition 
to htother emoluments, has hitherto enjoyed L. 10 a-year from 
the Society for the Diffusion of Christian Knowledge. 

Though possessing eight churches and cliapels, an nine nii- 
nisters connected with the estabhshment, Dundee is as yet one 
;S;\nd the discipline and poors' md are f; 
neral s'ession, containing at present, in addition to ministers,

upwards of 100 elders. This is no doubt an anomaly in paro- 
chial legislation ; but, though attempts have been made to obtain 
a change of system, the majority have hitherto declared that, in 
this particular, matters shall remain as they are. 

Until lately there were only four seceding congregations in Dun- 
dee, — two belonging to the United Secession Church ; one to the 
Associate Synod of Original Burghers ; and one to the Associate 
Synod of Original Seceders. In consequence, however, of a division in 
electing a minister to the chapel in School Wynd, a party formerly be- 
longing to its congregation are at present building a place of worship 
in Tay Square. The number belonging to each of these chapels may 
be from 700 to 1200. There is also a new and handsome chapel in 
connection with the Congregational Union of Scotland, containing 
about 1200 ; a small meeting of Scotch Independents ; a Relief 
chapel, attended by about 400; a Methodist chapel, with about 500 ; 
an old Scotch Baptist meeting, attended by 300 ; two other Baptist 
parties, averaging from 30 to 50 each ; and a pretty large con- 
gregation of Glassites, formed originally by Mr John Glass on his 
being deposed from the charge of Tealing. The ministers of 
these chapels with the exception of those whose principles prevent 
them receiving stipend are paid by the seat rents, and contribu- 
tions from their hearers. 

Dundee possesses two Episcopalian Chapels, — St Paul's, with 
two clergymen, and from 400 to 500 hearers ; and the New 
Chapel, a secession from the former, with one clergyman and 
about 100 hearers. There is a Roman Catholic chapel, with 
a congregation of about 300, chiefly of the Irish population. The 
bishop resides in Edinburgh. 

There are about 10,000 communicants in the Established Church, 
—a greater number fully than there are sittings in the churches 
and chapels. Only a very few free seats are provided for the poor. 
A great number of families are, no doubt, most regular, attentive, and 
exemplary in waiting upon the public worship of God, and support- 
ing every religious and benevolent institution; but at the same 
time, from the nature of the population, it must be admitted, that 
there are also many who, from their deficiencies in these respects, 
scarcely entitle us now to the honourable name which the holy zeal 
of the inhabitants procured for the town at the time of the Refor- 
mation. 

Religious Societies.— About two years ago, a City Missionary So- 
ciety was formed. L. 160 has been raised during the last year, by 



44 FORFARSHIllE. 

subscriptions and collections, for its support ; and four missionaries 
are employed daily in going from house to house, among the poorer 
and more ignorant of the people. At present there is a plan form- 
ing to obtain another society in connection with the Church of Scot- 
land, so as to employ, if possible, a missionary in the district of each 
of the established ministers. . . . 

The average amount of contributions by religious societies in 
Dundee including the city mission is about L. 550. The ex- 
traordinary collections for charitable and religious purposes in the 
churches and chapels of all denominations may amount to about 

Education.-The whole number of schools in Dundee is 80, 
at which, by the nearest calculation, 3700 children are ijeceiving 
education. There is no parochial school, properly so called ; but 
a Sessional School, conducted on Mr Wood's plan, has late y been 
estabhshed for poor children. It is attended at present by 16o 
children ; and the salary of the teacher is L. 80.  In the Royal 
Orphan Institution, in addition to eighteen orphans who reside in 
the house, 116 scholars receive education at Is a quarter the 
funds providing books, &amp;c. A seminary in Tay Square, built by 
privateindividuals, and superintended by three teachers, has a pre- 
Lt about 230 scholars, and is successful In the private schoo s 
there is no salary, and the fees for reading, winting, d arithmet, 
average 4s. 6d. a quarter. There are also several boarding-schools 
for young ladies, of very great and deserved respectabili y. 

In the grammar-school, there are two njasters for Lat n and 
Greek. Their fees, 10s. 6d. a quarter, producing to each L. 60 a 
vear and their salaries L. 50 each. The pubhc English school 
ClClo masters, one for English, the other for writing and 
aShmetic. Their fees, 6s. a quarter yielding to each

are L. 80 to the first teacher, L. 50 to the second, L. 35 to the 
French, and L. 35 to the drawing-master. Their corresponding- 
fees, according to the arrangement made at the last appointment 
of a teacher, are L. 178, L. 140, L. 70, and L. 35. 

The building for the public schools having long been unsuitable 
for the town, new seminaries are in the course of being erected. 
They are to cost, it is supposed, about L. 8000, three-fourths of 
which has already been procured, partly from subscriptions, and 
partly from a tax on beer. In order to encourage subscriptions, 
the magistrates have divided the patronage with the public. A 
plan by Mr Angus of Edinburgh having been adopted, and a site 
procured at the meadows, in the very centre of the town, the 
ground is to be laid out by Mr Brewster, architect, and a handsome 
edifice already raises its head soon to receive our generous youth, 
and form a splendid termination to the new street which has just 
been opened in front of the Town-House. When the building is 
finished, the classes of the academy and of the grammar-school will 
all be taught under its roof. 

Five schools have lately been opened in connection yvith several 
of our spinning-mills, the rooms provided, and the teachers paid, 
by the masters of the works. The branches taught are reading, 
writing, arithmetic, and sometimes geography; the number at pre- 
sent attending is about 500 ; and it is no unusual thing to see the 
masters of the works kindly assisting their teachers, after the 
business of the day, in instructing this hitherto much neglected 
class of children. 

The system of infant schools was introduced into the town about 
three years ago, by a committee of enlightened and benevolent 
ladies. They have a school at the Hawk Hill, and another at the 
Wallace Feus with which is connected a school for instructing o-irls 
in plam work under their direction. A third has lately been esta- 
blished at the Hill Town, under the management of gentlemen. 

Ihese institutions have been supported by subscription, and at 
one time they received L.178, from a sale of ladies' work, origi- 
nated by the ladies, who are interested in their success. The 
habits of attention and subordination produced in the children by 
this method of instruction are highly beneficial, and the religious 
knowledge which is communicated must be useful. The number 
at ending at present is 400. A school has also been opened lately 

chfot ' 7'-king-classes, at which those who leave the infant 
■schools are preferred. It is attended by sixty-five. 



45 PORFARSHIKK. 

The Dundee Sabbath School Society has thirty schools under its 
superintendence, which are attended by 1500 children. There 
are other schools not in connection with the society, affording in- 
struction to about 250,-in all 1750 scholars. In these schools 
the Bible and catechism are taught, and a number of pious and be- 
nevolent individuals give their labour as teachers, gratuitously, on 
the evening of the Lord's day. 

On the whole, the people seem alive to the importance ot edu- 
cation. It does not consist with the knowledge of the writer 
that there are many between six and fifteen years of age who 
are unable in some measure to read; and he has only met with 
two above twenty years of age who could not read at all ; and one 
of them was a native of the Highlands, and the other of Edinburgh. 
The same statement, however, cannot be made as to writing ; many 
in our public works are entirely ignorant of it ; but the means em- 
ployed of late, and those yet to be introduced, may remedy the 
evil On the whole, much has been done by the wealthier classes, 
to produce and encourage a greater attention to the instruction 
of the young ; and it is to be hoped the effect may be to make 
the rising generation better than their fathers. , 

ii&amp;ran-L-Thetowniswellsupphed with libraries. Acol ection 
of books in the vestry of the Old Church, evidently belongs to Ro- 
man Catholic times,-but of its commencement or design there is 
no history. The subscription library contains 6000 volumes and 
"ceted lately from government 69 folio volumes of tli. naUoi 
ecords. There are also district libraries connected with St 
David's Church and St, Andrew's Chapel, contaimng about 1000 
volumes each. Some of the seceding congregations have similar

stitution for instructing- young tradesmen and others in art and 
science, — that, Hke him whose name it bears, they might be stimu- 
lated to pursue the honourable course of improvement. A liberal 
subscription having been obtained, two lecturers procured, appara- 
tus provided, and a library formed, the institution was opened in Ja- 
nuary 1826. The session extended to six months, and 460 persons, 
paying a small fee, enrolled their names. In subsequent years the 
number attending has much decreased. A conversation class, how- 
ever, among the students, has begun ; and though the funds do not 
allow of a regular lecturer, a number of learned and benevolent 
individuals are accustomed to give instruction through the winter. 
The average number of students during last session was 30 ; that 
of annual members, 110. The library is now large, and seems well 
used ; and the tickets sold defray the expenses of the institution, 
exclusive of the purchase of books. 

An Artisans' Reading-Room was established in 1831 by seve - 
ral members of the Watt Institution. It is provided with news- 
papers and other periodicals, and has at present 200 members. 

Temperance Society.— An association of this name commenced 
here in 1829, and was regularly organized in 1830. Its great cham- 
pion and most indefatigable advocate was William Cruickshank, a 
coal carter in the place, who devoted himself with uncommon ener- 
gy to the cause. He delivered several lectures to crowded audien- 
ces, consisting of all classes in the town. Possessed of considerable 
readmg, a strong and ready memory, great command of lana-uag-e 
variety and force of illustration, he produced at the time a very 
powerful impression. The society now contains upwards of 1000 
members. That drunkenness is an evil of wide and increasino- 
prevalence, admits of no manner of doubt. Whether temperance 
societies, restricting the number of licenses to venders of whisky 
a tax upon ardent spirits, or whether a moral remedy is to be 
looked for to effect a cure, we cannot tell ; but that some measure 
IS necessary, few who have reflected on the subject will be dis- 
posed to deny. The able advocate of the society here, whom we 
have mentionec has himself exhibited the practical benefits of 
emperance. After receiving and accepting invitations to plead 

ince left h.s original employment, and has lately been appointed 
a preacher to a meeting of Wesleyan Methodists'at Leedf

A reading-room has been provided by Messrs J. and W. Brown, 
for the work-people in their spinning-mills. 

Neiospapers, -c— Two newspapers are published weekly m the 
town,— the Advertiser and Constitutional,— the former on Friday, 
and the latter on Tuesday. There is also at present a monthly pub- 
lication called the Presbyterian Magazine. 

Infirmarv.-ln 1782, the late Dr Small and Mr Stewart, sur- 
geon, established a Dispensary. The success of this, and the in- 
creasing wants of the population, led to the erection of the pre- 
sent infirmary. Subscriptions and collections for this purpose were 
obtained in Dundee and the neighbouring parishes. The founda- 
tion stone was laid in 1794, and the house opened for the recep- 
tion of patients in 1798. In this good work, great exertions were 
made by the late Mr David Jobson of Haugh-head. The mfir- 
mary receives at present thirty patients, besides those mfever; the 
patients being of all country parishes which make an annual collec- 
tion for its support; and many of the poor in Dundee receive me- 
dical attendance and medicines in their houses. The expenses of 
the house are upwards of L. 1000 a-year, and are made up by sub- 
scriptions, collections, and occasional legacies. 

Lunatic Asyhm.-The success of the infirmary gave rise to the 
lunatic asylum. Several benevolent- individuals began by solicit- 
ing subscr ptions,-the first name on the list being tha of Lord 
Panmure, the then member for the county. The foundation stone 
was laid in 1812, in an airy and commanding situation to the north- 
la" o the town. The house was opened for the reception of pa- 
tients in 1820, and upwards of 120 are at present coined .athm 
walk. In the erection and management of this asylum, the ex- 
ertions of Mr David Blair of Cookstone deserve to be recorded 
Is a tribute to his services, a subscription was raised m 1830, a.jd

with their early associations. So convinced were the directors of 
the benefit arising from the measure, that they have appointed a 
regular chaplain, a preacher of the Church of Scotland, who con 
ducts the seiTice every Lord's day. The average number of 100 
dunng the year have attended his ministrations. 

Savings Bank.— K bank for savings was established in June 1815 
In November 1831, the deposits amounted to X. 8312, 7s 8d and 
the number of depositors to 1217. During that year, L. 6384 
19s. 9d. was received, and L. 6254, 8s. 7d. withdrawn. The in- 
terest paid is three per cent. ; and any sum is received, from Is. to 
L. 9. The persons who lodge money in this bank are generally

Three benevolent societies distribute to the poor, yearly, as follows : 
The Indigent Sick Society, L. 160; the Female Society, L. 190; 
and the Clothing- Society, L. 40. Notwithstanding of all these and 
other resources, such as Grieve's mortification, which maintains a 
patient in the lunatic asylum and much private charity, and not- 
withstanding, too, that employment is at present readily procured, 
the assessment for the year ending February 1833 is L. 2500 ; 
and for the year ending February 1834, it has advanced to L. 4000.' 

The whole sum given annually, at present, for charitable purposes 
m Dundee, arising from assessment, collections, dues, subscrip- 
tions, mortifications, and corporations, exclusive of what is expend- 
ed by religious societies, does not amount to less than L. 11,000. 

In addition to the endowments already-mentioned, it may be re- 
corded, that Mrs Gibson of Edinburgh has this year placed L. 100 
in the hands of the magistrates; the interest to be applied for the 
preachmg of a sermon yearly against cruelty to the brute creation. 

Jail— The Jail of Dundee is, and has been for many years, al- 
together madequate to the wants of the town. It forms part of 
the present Town- House ; and has room neither for the classifica- 
tion of prisoners, nor the insuring of their health. It will not do 
to allow the means we employ to correct vice to become nurseries 
tor It. The administration of the law ought to be for the moral im- 
provement of the people ; and the personal comfort even of the most 
worthless is not to be unnecessarily destroyed. At present there 
are sixty-three persons in confinement, besides children; eiffht for 
debt and the rest for crime. A new jail, however, we have no 
doubt, will soon be built. The magistrates, who have the superin- 
tendence, have been accustomed to do every thing in their power 
«ent with safety to promote the health Sf the piW

flowers over the ashes of those she deplores. The example of 
this ought to influence those in other parishes who allow the rest- 
ing-place of the departed to remain covered with a desolation which 
is loathsome and sickening to the imagination and the heart. 
Why should they who believe in the immortality of the soul and 
the resurrection of the body, be rebuked in this respect even by 
the savage, and not love and honour the place where the ashes of 
their dead repose  

In concluding this account of the parish of Dundee, it seems un- 
necessary to add any farther remarks of our own. To draw a compa- 
rison betwixt what it is now, and what it was forty years ago, when 
the last Report was published, would almost be to repeat what we 
have written. Its population has been more than doubled ; its cha- 
rities have risen from L. 1900 to L. 7000; its shipping has increas- 
ed fourfold; and its linen trade been almost entirely called into ex- 
istence. But the reverse side of the picture must not be conceal- 
ed. The assessment for the poor has advanced tenfold. In 1791 
it was L. 400 ; it is now L. 4000. This, perhaps, is an evil inse- 
parable from prosperous communities. The poor generally flock 
to, or are rapidly increased in them ; and where multitudes are ga- 
thered together at various employments, example does not always 
favour economy, industry, and virtue. Nor is it easy, amidst the 
spirit of enterprise which is abroad, to suggest any improvement for 
the town, which is not in the course of being attempted. A new Jail 
and Bridewell, or perhaps House of Refuge, a supply of water, and a 
new burying-ground — the present one being fearfully over-crowded, 
— are generally beUeved to be indispensably necessary ; and measures, 
as before intimated, are in progress to procure them. In population, 
manufactures, and trade ; in the luxury and comfort which prevail, 
Dundee has perhaps advanced faster than any similar town in the 
kingdom. There are men alive in it who remember when its po- 
pulation was only one-Jifth of what it is now ; when its harbour 
was a crooked wall, often inclosing but a few fishing or smuggling 
craft ; when its spinning-mills were things unknown and unthought 
of ; and its trade hardly worthy of the name. And curious would it 
be could we anticipate the future, and tell what will be its state, 
when another generation shall have passed away, and other hands 
shall perhaps be called to prepare a record of its progress or decline.

THE REV. DAVID CANNAN, D. D. MINISTER. 



L — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Boundaries, c. — The original name of Mains was Strath- 
dighty ; and no name could have been more descriptive, the parish 
being in the form of a valley or strath, and the rivulet of Dighty 
running through its whole length, and dividing it into nearly two 
equal parts. It appears to have been afterwards called the Mams 
of Fintry, the castle of that name being the principal object in the 
parish. The church and manse adjoining were considered perti- 
nents, and were designated accordingly. For a number of years 
past, the parish has been called by the name of Mains. 

It is not very clear how the name of Strathmartine came to be 
apphed to the other parish. There is an erect stone on the north 
side of it called Martin's Stone ; and there is a traditionary story 
that this was erected in memory of a hero of the name of Mar- 
tin, who killed a dragon which had devoured nine maidens. It is 
probable that the whole parish derived its name from this person- 
age, and was called Martin's Valley or Strath. 

The united parish is six miles long, and from one to three broad, 
and contains about twelve square miles. A part of the parish of 
Murroes is said to belong to it quoad sacra; but it is probable that 
no other annexation took place than that the people preferred to 
attend the church of Mains, as more convenient for them in respect 
of distance than their own. 

The parish is bounded by Dundee on the south, Liff and Auch- 
terhouse on the west, Tealing on the north, and Murroes and 

Dundee on the east. 

Topogra.pUcal Appearances.— The rising grounds on eacAi side 
are nearly all cultivated; they scarcely deserve the name of hills, 



MAINS AND STIIATHMARTINE. 



55 



and are not 400 feet above the level of the sea. The valley has al- 
ways been considered a pleasant spot, affording a diversified land- 
scape of considerable richness and beauty. 

Climate. — As the valley extends to the sea, it is subject to 
easterly winds and fogs, and the harvest is not so early, nor is 
the chmate so genial, as in some of the inland parts of the country. 
The Dighty, being the most considerable stream of water in the 
vicinity of Dundee, is used as a powerful engine in different ma-, 
nufactures ; but since pubhc works have been erected in the parish, 
the picture of pastoral life has been withdrawn, and the eye of the 
spectator is presented with a busy scene of human industry, and of 
the arts brought into practical operation for the benefit of man. 
There are few improvements that are not accompanied with some 
mixture of evil; volumes of smoke are now seen issuing from en- 
gines along the whole line of the valley ; the bleachfields have ren- 
dered the water unfit for the use of cattle and for domestic purposes; 
the fish have disappeared ; the fumes emitted from the works are 
offensive to travellers, but still more to those residing on the spot, 
whose first sensation in the morning when they awake is that of the 
dilation of their lungs from a mixture of muriatic acid and chlorine 
gas. The health of the inhabitants, however, does not seem to be 
impaired ; nor are they peculiarly subject to fever or any other 
disease. 

Hydrography. — The Dighty, the only stream of water in the 
parish, rises from two lakes in the parish of Lundie, and running 
with somewhat of a uniform declivity, falls into the sea, near the 
bar of the River Tay, in the parish of Monifieth ; its whole course 
not exceeding fifteen miles. It seldom overflows its banks, nor does 
it fall so low in dry weather as many streams of greater magnitude.' 

As the branches or small rivulets that run into the Dighty are 
often dry in summer, and the water in the river itself adulterat- 
ed, and rendered unfit for ordinary use, pit wells have become ne- 
cessary, not only for the accommodation of houses and farms, but 
frequently for the benefit of grass-fields. 

There were formerly some bogs and marshes in the parish; but 
they have now all been drained, and only a few traces of them can 
be distinguished. There is only one spring that claims to be no- 
ticed. It is called Sinavey, and issues from the crevice of a perpen- 
dicular rock at the castle of Mains. It fills the whole aperture 
even m the driest weather, and consequently suffers no diminution. 
The water is considered in the neighbourhood as peculiarly sweet 



56 



FORFARSHIRE. 



and salubrious. It has not as yet been analyzed with any correct- 
ness. 

Geology. — The greater part of the parish abounds with strata 
of gray slate ; the direction of which is chiefly to the north-west, 
and the dip an angle from 20° to 25° with the horizon. Beds of 
trap, however, are frequently interspersed, and the different knolls 
on the elevated situations are composed of that rock. The sod is 
almost entirely black loam, incumbent on rock, gravel, or clay. It 
abounds in alluvial deposits ; and there are numerous ridges ad- 
joining the Dighty which are masses of gravel or pure sand. 

The land is of ordinary fertihty, and its situation near the har- 
bour and town of Dundee affords the means of high cultivation. 
With the exception of some pieces of moor and rocky knolls, which 
are generally planted, it is all under the plough ; and few oppor- 
tunities remain of observing what plants are indigenous to the 
soil. 

II. — Civil History. 
Historical Notices.— T\\e union of the parishes of Mains and 
Strathmartine took place in the year 1799. The object of uniting 
these parishes was to lessen the pressure of the parochial burdens 
to the heritors, and to augment the living of the clergyman. A 
central church and manse was built soon after the union was effect- 
ed ; and adjoining them a piece of land was allotted to the minis- 
ter' in lieu of the former glebes; and though the two schoolmasters 
continue, and there be now three burying-grounds, in all other 
respects the parishes are regarded as one. 

There are few historical events connected with the parish that 
have been preserved, and probably few that, if recorded, would be of 
much interest to the general reader. The present proprietors have 
acquired their lands in recent times; and any events that might be 
memorable in the lives of their forefathers, will fall to be recorded 
elsewhere. The chief proprietor for some centuries was Graham of 
Fintry. He was originally a cadet of the house of Montrose, and ac- 
quired his property in this parish and county by his marriage with 
a daughter of the Earl of Angus. His lands in this parish are now 
held by Mr Erskine of Linlathen, and the mausoleum in the 
church-yard is the only vestige of the ancient possessor. It may 
not be improper to mention, that Claverhouse, the residence of 
Lord Dundee, is likewise situate in this parish, and that an edi- 
fice, in the form of a ruin, has lately been erected on the site ot 



MAINS AND STRATHMARTINE.

his mansion, by his lineal male descendant, Mr Webster, former- 
ly Graham of Balmuir. 

Two obelisks, and some vestiges of a Roman camp, are the on- 
ly objects that excite the curiosity of the antiquary. 

Parochial Register. — The register of Strathmartine does not ex- 
tend farther back than the year 1783. The school-house having 
accidentally caught fire at that time, the p/irish records were con- 
sumed. The parish register of Mains commences with the year 
1633, and for a considerable time all the miscellaneous transac- 
tions of cash, as well as baptisms and marriages, and the nume- 
rous cases of discipline, which were carefully taken up and minutely 
examined at that period, are recorded promiscuously, as the events 
occurred, in one volume. From the nature of the offences that 
were subjected to pubhc censure, and the examination of the wit- 
nesses, much information may be obtained concerning the mo- 
rals, habits, and customs of the people. Incidental information is 
likewise procured concerning the state of agriculture. It may be 
true, that parochial discipline has relaxed as the people have be- 
come more refined ; but the cases reported in this register do not 
give us a favourable view of the morals of the seventeenth century. 

III. — Population. 

In 1801, the population of the united parishes amounted to - 1442 

1811, 1738 

1821, 1779 

1831, 2011 

If the register of baptisms has been correctly kept, and there is 
evidence that it has not been neglected, we may calculate pretty 
nearly what has been the population of Mains for the space of 
two centuries. The number of baptisms in 1636 amounted to 
24; in 1685, to 33; in 1734, to 31 ; in 1783, to 19; and in 1832, 
to 31. It is probable that the parish, after the middle of the se- 
venteenth century, reached to its present amount of population ; 
and that, after the middle of the eighteenth century, it reached its 
lowest point of depression. It is admitted, that, after the Union, 
Scotland did not flourish for more than half a century. The ca- 
pital engaged in trade was of trifling amount, and, by the suppres- 
sion of the Scottish Parliament, no small proportion of the rental 
of the kingdom being spent in England, labourers were thrown out 
of employment, and the spirit of improvement was restrained. 
When commerce began to flourish, agriculture revived; farms 
were enlarged ; cottagers, finding that higher wages could be ob- 



58 FORrARSHlRE. 

tained in manufacturing labour, removed into towns, and the di- 
vision of labour effected a more complete separation between our 
town and country population. 

The yearly average of births in the united parish for the last 
seven years is 50 ; of deaths, 17 ; of marriages, 27. The average 
number of persons under fifteen years of age is 766; upwards of 
seventy, 41. 

The number of unmarried men, bachelors and widowers, up- 
wards of fifty years of age, is 13 ; and of unmarried women upwards 
of forty-five, 6. The number of children in each family is from 
4 to 5. There are two insane persons in confinement. There is 
also one fatuous, and one blind. 

The number of famihes in the parish is 354; whereol 89 are 
chiefly employed in agriculture, and 204 in trade, manufactures, 

and handicraft. „ , , , i 

Land-oioners.—The number of proprietors of land of the yearly 
value of L. 50 is ten. Only Sir John Ogilvy, Baronet, of Inverquha- 
rity and Mr Laird of Strathmartine, have mansion-houses in the 
parish; and at the present time there is not a resident proprietor 
Character, Manners, 8fc. of the People.- A considerable im- 
provement has taken place in the language of the people within the 
last forty years. Many Scottish phrases are becoming obsolete; and 
a number of trades-people speak Enghsh with considerable propriety. 
The low price of cotton and other stuffs has enabled the people to 
effect a great improvement in their dress. Their houses, with few 
exceptions, are white-washed in the inside, once and many of them 
twice a-year ; and there is an appearance of comfort wherever there 
are habits of industry or virtuous conduct. It would have been satis-, 
factory to add, that there was also an improvement m morals, and 
in the discharge of religious duties ; but, while there are many in- 
stances of zeal and real piety among the labouring classes, it must 
be admitted, that there is also much coldness and neglect. 

The introduction of bothies, or apartments where servants are 
lodged by themselves, though advantageous in an economica pom 
of liew, has an opposite effect in regard to moil and iiitellectual 
improvement. The natural intercourse that subsists between the 
Members of the same family ought to be very cautiously interfered 
w'tror the young will inevitably suffer. A boy, when traming to 
The abour o'f hubandry, and lodged in the same  
others of riper years, has often to hsten to conversation which is 
but an indili-ent substitute for parental instruction, prudent d.s- 



MAINS AND STRATHMABTINE, 



59 



cipline, and affectionate reproof. In bothies attached to manufac- 
turing establishments, the evil is felt more severely, as the number 
of inmates is greater ; and, being assembled from a greater dis- 
tance, their modes of Ufe are more varied, and bad example is 
more forcible and pernicious. 

The food of the male servants engaged in husbandry is a vkeek- 
ly allowance of milk and oatmeal ; while, among tradesmen, fish, 
butcher-meat, pork of their own rearing, sugar, and tea, are in con- 
stant use. No article of food has increased so much in consump- 
tion as potatoes, which now constitute the chief sustenance of the 
poorer classes for one-half of the year. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — The whole extent of land 
in the parish is about 7063 imperial acres. Of moor, rocky knolls, 
and steep banks that cannot be ploughed, there are 144 acres. 
A considerable part of the latter might no doubt be cultivated, 
but the capital at present would not be profitably laid out. There 
is scarcely any natural wood in the parish ; but the number of 
acres planted is 436. A considerable proportion of this wood is 
fir and oak, planted on ground unfit for tillage ; and the thin- 
ning of the firs as they advance in growth is certainly too much 
neglected. The extent of ground occupied by roads, water-cour- 
ses, houses, gardens, fences, plantations, moor, &amp;c. is about 880 
acres, — so that the amount of acres in actual cultivation is 6183. 

The parish is well-wooded ; hedge-rows are generally found on 
the boundaries of fields ; and the gentlemen's seats are adorned 
with thriving plantations. On moors of inferior soils the larch is 
not found to live above thirty or forty years. All the ordinary 
sorts of forest trees have been planted. The easterly winds, how- 
ever, seem rather adverse to their growth. At one glance it can 
be observed that the beech is the most prosperous. There is a 
beech on an eminence at the castle of Mains seventeen feet in 
girth, a foot and a-half above the level of the ground, and, when 
m foliage, the appearance of its head is truly majestic. The 
names of numerous visitors are cut out on its trunk and branches. 
Its age is unknown. It is probable, however, that it has withstood 
the blasts and hurricanes of nearly two centuries. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of cultivated land is nearly 
L.2, 10s. per acre ; but in this calculation is included a considerable 
extent of moorish ground, which has not been a long time in cul- 



60 



FORFARSIIIIIE. 



tivation. The old infield is let at L. 3, 5s ; but there are fields 
which, if let by themselves, would not yield more than 12s. or 14s. 
per acre, and obviously do not pay the expenses of their improve- 
ment. 

Rate of Wages, §-c.— The average rate of wages during the year 
for males employed in husbandry is L. 12 ; for females L. 6, inclusive 
of board. Labourers, without victuals, receive Is. 8d. per day in 
summer, and Is. 6d. in winter: Masons, carpenters, &amp;c. 2s. 6d. m 
summer, and 2s. in winter. Artisans, however, are now seldom 
paid by the day, but contract for different pieces of work. A plough 
will cost L. 3, 3s., a cart L. 14, the shoeing of a farm-horse for a 
year 12s. 

Husbandry.— The usual period of a lease is now only nmeteen 
years. The character of the husbandry of the parish is derived 
from its vicinity to the populous town of Dundee, where abun- 
dance of manure can be procured, and where a ready sale is found 
for grass, turnips, and potatoes. The crop that yields the highest 
price is the most extensively cultivated, though the rules of good 
husbandry should be for a while suspended. A rotation of, 1. 
oats ; 2. turnips or potatoes ; 3. barley or wheat ; 4. grass— was for 
sometime commonly adopted. This rotation is now abandoned, 
and the land allowed either to remain above one year m grass, or 
the cropping is otherwise extended, so as to prevent the necessity 
of sowing with grass every fourth year. Some of the farmers, in- 
stead of seUing their crops to the Dundee cow-feeders, have ex- 
tensive dairies themselves ; and several persons reside in the parish 
who have no land, but keep a number of cows, and are every day 
busily employed in conveying the crops they have purchased from 
the neighbouring farmers to their abodes, and again, in disposing 
of the produce of their dairies among the inhabitants of Dundee. 

A large extent of waste ground has been reclaimed withm the 
last sixty years. About the year 1772, Mr Graham of Finti-y 
beaan to improve an extensive waste m the neighbourhood of 
Dundee ; and in 1790, Admiral Laird was actively employed in 
various improvements on the estate of Strathii« a.id the 
plantations which he reared, particularly on the -g-   
enrich the landscape, improve the climate, and affoid a u.efu 
upply of timber for agricultural purposes. The .igncidture o 
JVarish remains very much in the same state to  "

be said to be all drained; and yet a httle is still done m this

way every year, to render the operation more complete. Most of 
the fields are inclosed with stone dikes and hedges ; and the farm- 
buildinos are in tolerable repair; but it cannot be said, that in the 
last twenty years either houses or fences have been in any respect 
improved. 

The parish, however, has not suffered so much by the fall in 
the price of grain as many others. The great increase and pros- 
perity of the town of Dundee has afforded a ready market for 
green crops ; and there has not. been a failure among the tenants 
during the existing leases. 

Quarries. — Perhaps there is no part of the country better sup- 
plied with stone for every useful purpose than this district. Quar- 
ries abound everywhere, furnishing stones well adapted for every 
kind of building and inclosure ; and if the roads be not in excel- 
lent repair, it is not from the want of the best materials. 

In stating the gross amount of the raw produce raised in the 
parish, it is not easy to approach to anything like exactness. 
The quantity of produce, the price, and mode of cropping, vary in 
different years. The following statement, however, may give a 
general view of the subject to the reader : —

Manufactures. — It has already been remarked, that the water 
of the Dighty is employed as a powerful auxiliary in the Dundee 
manufactures. Every fall that it affords is occupied with ma- 
chinery; and three-fourths of the population of the parish are 
employed in works that have been established on its banks. There 
are four bleachfields, two of which are of great extent, and four 
flax spinning-mills; and the machinery of the whole of these 
works is partly driven by steam. Besides the yarn that is clean- 
ed at the bleachfield, there are other five mills of inferior con- 
struction, where yarn is washed and prepared for.the loom. There 



02 FORFARSHIRE. 

are two flour-mills, one of which, built two years ago by the Baker 
Corporation of Dundee, is of large dimensions, and in which steam 
is used in aid of the water-power. Several of the oatmeal-mills 
were displaced to make way for these manufacturing establish- 
ments ; five of them, however, yet remain, which, being better 
constructed than formerly, are quite sufficient for manufacturing all 
the oatmeal consumed in the neighbourhood. A saw-mill, and 
several of the thrashing-mills are likewise driven by water. 

The hours of labour in the spinning-mills are from six in the 
morning to eight in the evening : the hours at the bleachfields 
are from six in the morning to seven in the evening ; and in both 
cases two intervals during the day are allowed for meals. The 
work at the bleachfields cannot be considered as very heavy, as 
the materials to be moved are light, and the labour, in general, 
performed in the open air. There are, however, sometimes extra 
hours of working; but the wages are increased in proportion to the 
time employed ; and while this labour is optional, it is expected 
that only the strong and healthy will engage in it. 

Though the wages given at the public works furnish the means 
of procuring the necessaries of life, and employment to those who 
may not be engaged in agricultural labour,— though a ready mar- 
ket be thus afforded for the produce of the soil, and the wealth 
of the country be greatly increased,— it is very questionable whe- 
ther these advantages be not counterbalanced by greater and very 
obvious evils. The Irish and Highlanders that are sometimes 
employed at the bleachfields are not of such habits as to improve 
public morals. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market Town.— As the parish reaches to the outskirts of Dun- 
dee, it is conveniently situate in regard to a market town. It is 
to Dundee that all the produce of the parish is carried for sale; 
and it is there that all the articles required by the parishioners are 
purchased. Besides the two market days, Tuesday and Friday, 
there is an intercourse every day with the town. The articles ol ma- 
nufacture are constantly passing from the one place to the other ; 
labourers from Dundee are employed every day at pubhc works ; 
children from the parish attend the seminaries m tosm ; and coun- 
try lodgings in this parish were at one time eagerly sought after by 
the inhabitants of the town during the summer months.

the parish, in length nearly eight and a half miles. On the one, 
leading from Dundee to Forfar, there are several public coaches. 
There is likewise a railway from Dundee to the fertile vale of 
Strathmore, undertaken in the memorable year 1825, and since 
executed at an expense of nearly L. 100,000. At present it ter- 
minates on its entrance into the Strath ; and, as there is no trade 
in the district to which it reaches, it is not supposed that it can be 
a profitable concern until branches be formed to the nearest towns. 
In the meantime, it has opened up some excellent quarries, which 
supply the town and neighbourhood with stones at a cheaper rate 
than formerly. There are nine bridges over the Dighty, all of 
which are of small dimensions. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is conveniently situate near 
the centre of the parish, and none of the inhabitants are distant 
fromitabove three miles- It wasbuiltin the year 1800 ; and contains 
900 sitters. There are twenty-eight free sittings in it. When it 
was built, it was thought to be too large for the parish, and some 
space was left unoccupied. Seats to accommodate 100 persons 
have been lately erected by the kirk-session ; and are let annually 
at the rate of two shillings to each sitter. The manse was built 
in 1801, is commodious, and kept in a good state of repair. 

The new glebe consists of twenty-two acres imperial, and might 
let for L. .3 per acre. 

The stipend consists of 3 b. 2 f. 1 p. 2| lip. wheat ; 63 b. 2 f. 1 p. 
barley ; 106 b. 1 f. 1 p. 2 lip. meal ; L. 72, Os. 2/3d. ; and the teinds 
are exhausted. The total yearly amount of stipend, on an average 
of the last seven years, converted to money, is L. 251 Sterling. 

There is only one place of worship in the parish. Many of 
the labourers at the pubhc works have no fixed residence, and 
spend the Sundays with their friends in Dundee or elsewhere. 
The number of families belonging to the Established Church is 
328, and of Dissenters 32. Two of these Dissenters are Irishmen, 
who have married natives of the parish, and are Roman Catholics. 
There are no Episcopalians at present. The parish church has 
hitherto been well attended, and the average number of communi- 
cants is 720. 

There is an annual collection for the Dundee Infirmary, which 
gives free admission to all the sick-poor of the parish. There is 
also an annual collection for religious purposes. The amount of 
such collections is generally about L. 10 a-year. 

Educa.timi.~ThQVQ are two parochial schools; and two parochial 



64 F0RFA.RSIII11E. 

schoolmasters, who have all the emoluments and accommodations 
which the law requires. Practical mathematics, Latin, and some- 
times French and Greek, are taught. Each of the schoolmasters 
has the maximum salary, L. 34, 4s. 4- d., and handsome dwelling- 
houses of two stories, lately built. 

The average amount of school fees received by the schoolmaster 
at Strathmartine is L. 30 ; at Mains, L. 40 a-year. The yearly 
expense of a scholar for learning merely to read is 10s. ; when 
writing is added, the expense is 14s. ; with the addition of arith- 
metic it is L. 1. The charge for Latin is L. 1, 10s. 

There are no persons belonging to the parish that cannot read, 
and few that cannot write ; but there are about sixteen children 
employed in the spinning-mills, some of whom have not been 
taught, and others can read very imperfectly. There is also a 
female school endowed by Dowager Lady Ogilvy, and two others, 
chiefly for sewing, taught by females. A subscription school m the 
parish of Dundee accommodates a few children who are farthest 
distant from the school of Mains ; but, in general, the distance 
from the schools is attended with little inconvenience. 

Poo'.— The average number of persons receiving parochial aid 
is 28 • but the greater number of them have families. The al- 
lowances vary from L. 2 to L. 10 yearly. Four orphan children 
receive L. 22, 2s. besides clothes. L. 16 is paid yearly to the 
Dundee Lunatic Asylum.

There is certainly less aversion in the public mind to receive 
pubhc aid than there was fifty years ago. With many, howevei-, the 
spirit of independence is not yet broken, and some are ready to 
submit cheerfully to much inconvenience, rather than endure the 
degradation of receiving pubhc charity. In this parish some coals 
are supplied gratis to the poor at the new year. 

Fairs.-Theve are two fairs held in the parish: one on the 
26th of August, the other on the 15th of September. Sheep, 
cattle, and horses, are exposed at these fairs; and servants are en» 
gaged. The dues of one of the fairs belong to the town of Dundee ;

the dues of the other to Lord Douglas j and disputes are settled 
by persons appointed by his Lordship. 

Alehouses. — There are six small alehouses in the parish, three 
of which are toll-houses. They are felt as a great nuisance to the 
sober and industrious part of the population. 

Fuel. — Coals from Sunderland, imported at Dundee, are the 
only fuel used in the parish ; and the carriage by water is not a 
heavy addition to the expense. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Since the last Statistical Account was written, many changes of 
much importance have taken place in the parish. The increase of 
population has been in the manufacturing, and not in the agricul- 
tural class. By the introduction of machinery and improved im- 
plements, the manual labour employed in husbandry is gradually 
diminishing ; and, notwithstanding the extent of ground that has 
been reclaimed from barrenness, perhaps the number of agricul- 
tural labourers was never smaller than at the present moment. 

It is said in the last Statistical Account of Mains, that the 
erection of the first spinning-mill was then scarcely completed. 
Its history is not one of continued prosperity. Great profits 
were occasionally realized, cherishing sanguine hopes, which were 
blasted by sudden and extensive losses. The property has fre- 
quently changed owners; and about twelve years ago, the works 
were diverted from their original purposes, and now constitute a 
part of the premises of the Claverhouse Bleaching Company. The 
mdls that were erected at a later period have undergone similar 
changes. In the course of the last ten years, however, the linen 
trade has been greatly increased; improved machinery has been in- 
troduced; a much greater quantity of work has been performed • 
experience has taught us how former errors may be avoided • the 
mills have been greatly enlarged, and have been actively, and for the 
most part profitably, employed. 

The bleachfields have hkewise been greatly increased and im- 
proved. Not only has the linen trade been much extended ; but 
a finer fabric of cloth is now manufactured. Improved modes of 
bleaching have been adopted; and this branch of business is now 
m such a flourishing state, that new works would be erected if they

vl of fl. n ""' '' "lore within the

had done during the whole period that, has elapsed since any of 
our race settled on its banks. 

The progress in agriculture has not been nearly so distuiguish- 
ed ; but here also the improvements have been many and valuable. 
It is in this period that thrashing-mills have been mtroduced ; that 
the land has been drained ; that the alternate husbandry has been 
practised; that wheat has been regularly cultivated; and there can 
be no doubt that the culture of potatoes has increased from 70 to 
80 per cent. Many of the inhabitants of Dundee take a piece ot 
o-round from the farmers annually, plant, hoe, and take up their 
potatoes themselves; and the exercise is considered to be salutary 
to those who are used to sedentary employments. It was former- 
ly the custom, particularly among small farmers, to raise a quanti- 
ty of flax annually, which the females were employed in spinmng 
durino- the winter months; and the cloth when manufactured, and 
not ued for household purposes, was sold and constituted oiie of 
the items of profit or of rent. The spmning-mills have abolished 
this practice,-the sound of the wheel is no longer heard in the fai- 
S dwelli;g,-foi- this good reason, that the cloth can b« 
at a cheaper rate than the former expense of spinning, which has 
been reduced from 2s. to 2d. per spindle. Females who formerly 
JZelthen livelihood by spinning, have now taken to weavmg, 
Ind under certain restrictions, they do not suffer from the change 

'SlXaTbe no doubt that our agriculture is susceptible of 
n Jh imprvement. The great evil under which this parish is nov 
suffeino is the frequent repetition of the same crop on the same 
oil Xe is a steady demand in Dundee for turnips, potatoes 
and .rass; and these crops, particularly the grass, have become 
detien f on. frequent repetition. Indeed clover is now so cmn- 
monTy a failure, that tares are not unfrequently sown as a substi- 
Tu ' Tu nips potatoes, and sown grasses, have been mtroduced 
f n'rornmratively recent period. The appearance of the whole 
fJeT:ClIs thus been changed; and the value of the pro- 
duce of the soil has increased to an extent that cannot be well con- 
ceived. " .

PRESBYTERY OF ARBROATH, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. DAVID TRAIL, D. D. MINISTER. 



I- — Topography and Natural History. 
Name and Boundaries.—TiiE name of the parish is evidently 
connected with St Bridget; and it is more than probable that the 
prefix Pmi is derived, not from the Latin word fanum, a church, 
as has been supposed by some, but from the Celtic word palUn or 
dalh7i, signifying a town or hamlet. The historian Buchanan 
accordmgly calls the parish Balbride, which signifies St Bride's 
town. 

The parish is fully more than five miles long in the direction of 
north-west to south-east, by about two broad. It is bounded by 
the sea on the south ; by the parishes of Barry and Monikie on 
the west; by Carmylie on the north; by Arbiriot on the north-east; 
and by a detached part of St Vigeans on the south-east. 

ropographical Appearances.-The general appearance of the 
parish and immediate neighbourhood is rather flat than hilly; but 
there is a considerable declivity for some miles from the north to 
the sou h throughout the whole line of country between Dundee 
and Arbroath. The sea shore, which bounds the parish, is flat 
and very rocky, with a considerable accumulation of -ravel along

58 FORFAllSHIUE. 

Throudiout the parish the soil varies considerably: it is light 
and sandy on the coast: loam, and in some places approaching 
to clay in the middle : and moorish, with a tdl bottom m the 

northern extremity. , u i i , 

HydToqraphy.-'Thex is one mineral sprmg of the chalybeate 
kind in the parish, which might easily be formed u.to a well : but 
Uttle attention is paid to it; and it has never been much frequent- 
ed, unless by persons in the immediate neighbourhood. 

Two small streams run through the parish, and unite about a 
mile from the sea. In various places along their course, these ri- 
vulets are bounded by pretty high rocks, from 25 to 50 feet, nearly 

Gr/tm-The range of the strata in the rocks above alluded to 
is from N. W. to S. E. The rocks in this place, as well as those 
on the sea-shore, are composed of soft sandstone, intermixed mth 
masses of very hard compact limestone. These are -y durable 
and the weather seems to make no impression on them. Towaids 
the head of the parish, within the woods of Panmure, there is a 
quarry of good hard freestone, which is fit for any purpose of ma- 
sonry and of a fine colour. At a little distance, slates and pave- 
menl may also be got. It should be added, that the limestone is 
not in such quantities as to render it worth quarrying ; and that it 
not TDure, yielding anly about 75 per cent. 
X-The double flowering Geum, which I believe is a very- 
rare plant in most parts of Scotland, I have sometimes met with 
on the banks of the rivulets which run through the parish. The 
,relt part of the more showy wild flowers whidi formerly adorn- 
d our fields have almost entirely disappeared. This is a proof that 
he soil is now better cultivated, and cleared of fosep ants and 
weeds which formed near half its produce about the middle of last 
lentury, except on a few farms where the improved system of hus- 
bandry had been introduced.

several generations proprietors of the barony of Panbnde ; , nd t at

One of the most ancient families of Angus is that of Panmure, 
to which the whole property of this parish belongs. Galfred de 
Maule appears to have held all the lands of Panmure by a charter 
from Edgar King of Scotland, signed and sealed in the year 
1072. 

Parochial Registers. — These commence in the year 1693, and 
are regularly kept. 

Modern Buildings. — In the N. E. of the parish stands the spa- 
cious and massy house of Panmure, — the principal seat of the no- 
bleman to whom it belongs. It is built in an elevated situation, 
surrounded by extensive enclosures and plantations, and commands 
a -fine prospect, especially to the south and east. — At a little 
distance, are still to be seen the vaults and foundations of the old 
castle of Panmure, long the residence of the Earls of that name, 

III. — Population. 

In 1801 the population amounted to 1383 
1811 - - . 1412 

1821 - . . 1275 

1831 - . . 1268 

The decrease has been owing to the removal of some villages, 
and to the uniting of a few small farms into one. 

The average number of baptisms yearly for the last seven years 
is 32 ; of marriages, 13 ; of deaths, 22. 

The number of families in the parish is 300 ; whereof 88 are 
chiefly employed in agriculture; 103 in trade, manufactures, and 
handicraft; and 109 not comprised in the two preceding classes 

Character and Habits of the People—The people in general are 
sober and moral in their habits; and regular in their attendance 
on public ordinances. They are also, as might be expected, in- 
dustrious and frugal; and are altogether a very respectable por- 
tion ot the community.  

The ordinary food of the peasantry consists chiefly of potatoes, 
and of he various preparations of oatmeal; with occasionally a 
httle butcher-meat, generally pork, at dinner. Tea is in universal 
use, from the highest to the lowest. On the whole, though many 
are liable to participate in the occasional depressions of trade it

Rate of af/es.— Farm-servants' wages may be stated at i.. ii 
per annum ; with 6 bolls meal rated at L. 6; and three choppms 
of milk for one-half of the year, and two for the other halt, 
which may amomit to L. 3. A certain quantity of potatoes, as 
may be agreed on, is frequently given; and, if married, the ser- 
vants generally have a house and small garden m addition La-

4.&amp;anrfry.-The improved system of husbandry is generally, 
almost universally adopted. The fields are well cultivated, and 
kept in good order. Draining and lime are the two great means 
of improvement in this quarter: Common dikes and thorn hedges 
the usual fence. Common black cattle are best for this part of 

'p''jlThe average gross amount and value of raw produce 
yearly raised in the parish, so far as can be ascertamed, is as fol- 
lows : — 

11,000 bolls of grain, at 25s. per boll, on an average  each Hnd, L. 13 750 0 0

In the proper season, which is between the beginning of Febru- 
ary and end of May, lobsters are caught in great quantities for the 
London market, and carried up alive in vessels fitted for the pur- 
pose with what are called wells, which freely admit the sea-water 
during their passage. Sea-weed is also put into the wells, on which 
the lobsters may feed. Such as are caught before the arrival of the 
smacks, which come along the coast every two weeks, are put into a 
large chest fixed among the rocks, within flood-mark, with their 
claws tied with small cord, so as to prevent their destroying one 

another; and in this state they remain until they reach the Thames. 

Crabs are also got in abundance, but they are all disposed of in 
the neighbourhood.— Cod, in winter, is often caught in great 
quantities, and salted in casks for exportation. Haddocks, hke- 
wise, are abundant, and form the principal part of our fishery, fur- 
nishing an ample supply for the surrounding country, especially for 
Dundee and Forfar, where they find a ready market. Indeed, the 
fishery on this part of the coast is of great advantage to the whole 
neighbourhood, as it produces a very considerable supply of whole- 
some food for all classes of the inhabitants. 

Manufactures.—Theve is only one mill,— a flax-spinning one, in 
the parish. It is on a very limited scale ; but, limited as it is, it is 
qmte sufiicient to show the demoralizing eff-ects which such esta- 
bhshments have on those who are engaged in them. Hitherto in 
these establishments a great proportion of the rising generation has 
been trained up in ignorance, profligacy, and vice, and afterwards 
sent abroad into the world to corrupt and contaminate all who come 
into contact with them. It is to be hoped that these abuses will 
now be corrected by legislative enactments.

a Sabbath school regularly kept. The means of elementary in- 
struction are thus sufficiently provided to the parish, and there are 
no persons in the parish betwixt 6 and 15 years of age unable to 
read. 

Lihranj. — There is a parish library, consisting almost entirely 
of religious publications. 

Poor. — The number of poor on the roll varies from twelve to 
eighteen ; and they are all maintained in their own houses. But 
besides these, there is a considerable number of householders in 
indigent circumstances, who receive each a boll of coals from the 
poors' funds. The poors' funds, bearing interest, amount only to 
L. 73 ; but a considerable sum arises from the mortcloth and 
hearse fees, and the rent of one of the galleries in the church, 
which belongs to the session ; and also from the back seats in 
the Panmure loft, which Lord Panmure has for some years past 
permitted to be let for behoof of the poor. The average yearly 
amount of collections in the church for the last seven years is 
L. 37, 1 Is. lOid. There are no assessments for the ordinary poor. 
But there are three lunatic paupers connected with this parish, in 
different asylums, the expense of whose board is L. 50 ; of this sum 
the heritor pays one-half, and the tenants the other. 

Alehouses. — Of these there are five in this parish, and two of 
them might well be spared. It is, I think, the remark of Kotze- 
bue, in his Travels through Russia, that wherever he came to the 
neighbourhood of a public house, he uniformly found the morals 
of the people corrupted, and their character debased ; and perhaps 
the same observation will hold good in every part of the world, 
where such haunts of idleness and profligacy are to be met with.

Name and Boundaries.-TuE ancient name of the parish was 
Aberbrothock, of which Arbroath is a corruption. Amongst the 
peasantry in many parts ofthe counties of Forfar and Kuicardme 
it is pronounced Arbroad. The original name is descriptive of 
the situation at the mouth of the Brothock, a small river, which 
here discharges itself into the German Ocean, and which, m the 
Gaehc language, is said to signify the 'f™- 

The parish is about three miles in length, varying m breadth 
from one to ten furlongs. Its extent may be estimated at 820 
English acres, and in shape it may be said to bear some resem- 
blance to a boot. , ■,. • ,1 J -1  
Topographical Appearances.-W.thm the limits thus described 

there is nothing approaching in elevation to a hill Tlie ground 
rises gradually as it recedes from the shore till at the farther ex- 
tremity of the parish it attains to a height of about 160 feet above 
the level of the sea. The extent of coast is nearly a mile and 
a half The shore is flat, with a rocky bottom, and forms the ter- 
mination of the level coast, which extends eastward from the mouth 
of the river Tay. In the adjoining parish of St Vigeans, it as- 
sumes a very bold appearance, presenting a line of elevated rocks, 
with numerous caves and fissures.

to. About two miles from the town there was formerly a small 
lake, which has been drained these many years. It still retains 
the name of Bishop's Loch. The only stream in the parish, with 
the exception of a small burn which falls into it, is the Brothock. 
Unless when flooded after rain, it discharges a very inconsiderable 
quantity of water into the sea. It takes its rise in the parish of 
St Vigeans, and, after a course of about six miles, enters the pa- 
rish of Arbroath, through which it flows about a quarter of a mile, 
when it falls into the ocean. As the source whence the stream is 
gathered which drives a considerable number of spinning-mills, it 
is of no little value to the place. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The country part of the parish be- 
mg a narrow strip of land, is distinguished by no peculiarity under 
this head which may not be described with more propriety in the 
account of the adjoining parishes of Arbirlot and St Vigeans. At 
the farther extremity, where the ground is from 140 to 160 feet 
above the level of the sea, the soil is thin, with a clay bottom ; 
nearer the town of Arbroath it is black loam ; and along the coast 
it is light and sandy. 

Zoology. — The zoologist will find none of the more rare species 
of animals in the parish. In the neighbouring ocean is to be had 
an abundant supply of fish, consisting chiefly of the haddock, the 
cod, and the flounder, with herring and mackerel in their season. 
Stake-nets were erected a few years ago, in the hope of establish- 
ing a salmon fishery, but the success has not been such as to de- 
fray the expense. Shell-fish, viz. crabs and lobsters, are procured 
in great plenty. 

IL— Ci viL History. 
Illustrative of this department, there do not appear to be any 
ancient or modern accounts of the parish in print or manuscript, 
with the exception of a series of brief notices in the Arbroath Ma- 
zme,— a pubHcation which was begun and ended in the year 1800 
The only other historical or descriptive statements regarding Ar- 
broath, are those to be met with in works which refer to Scotland 
m general A « Description of the Abbey of Arbroath, by James 
Ihomson, was published at Arbroath in 1829, which contains 
a good deal of interesting, and, seemingly, correct, information, in 
a condensed form. 

Historical Events.— In ancient times, one of the most important 
oi these was the celebrated Assembly of the Estates of Scotland, 



FOIIFARSIIIKE. 



held m the Abbey in 1320, when a declaration was drawn up and 
signed, asserting the independence of the Scottish Church and 
kingdom, in language to which the Roman pontiff was not much 
accustomed in these days. In 1445, in consequence of a dispute 
about the election of a bailie of regahty, a battle was fought near 
the town between the families of Lindsay and Ogilvie, in which 
the leaders of both houses fell, with about 500 of their followers. 
The next event of importance known to have taken place was the 
destruction of the buildings of the Abbey in the sixteenth century. 
The particulars have not been fully ascertained ; only, the demo- 
lition appears to have taken place before the Reformation. Tra- 
dition says, it was accomphshed by Ochterlony of Kelly, a pro- 
prietor in the neighbourhood, who had quarrelled with the monks, 
and had recourse to this method of avenging himself. In more 
recent times the town acquired a sort of notoriety, in consequence 
of a visit from one Captain Fall, commander of a French privateer, 
who appeared in sight with his vessel on the 23d May 1781, a.:d 
commenced firing on the place. Having thus exhibited a speci- 
men of his intentions, he sent several of his men, with a flag oi 
truce, on shore, demanding L. 30,000 Sterling as the ransom of 
the town, and six of the principal inhabitants as hostages till the 
sum should be paid. Considerable alarm followed. But at last, 
after a variety of proposals had been made, a few of the townsmen 
presented themselves on the beach with such fire-arms as con d be 
most readily procured, and bade defiance to the threats of he 
privateer. After expending some more of his shot durmg the 
nicht, and finding next morning that he had done httle or no 
damage, the captain made off in all haste, and found an oppor- 
tunity of gratifying his desire of plunder, by making prizes of se- 
veral sloops that fell in his way. A battery was afterwards erec ed 
in front of the harbour as a means of defence, but was dismantled 

after the last general peace. 

Maps, PZa7Z5.-No separate map of the parish is known to exi t. 
A plan of the town, including the suburbs in the parish of St Vi- 
geans, was drawn, and published by Wood in 1822. 

Letters, Papers, c.-Oi these, m the possession of resident in- 
dividuals, and tending to illustrate the biography, history, or anti- 
quities of the parish, there appear to be none. The ancient e- 
cords of the burgh have been lost. Several papers, however . - 
lating to the Abbey of Arbroath, which are the property of Loid 



ARBROATH. 



77 



Panniure, have of late been intrusted to the care of the magistrates, 
and are preserved among the existing records of the town. Amongst 
the documents in the possession of the kirk-session is a roll, beau- 
tifully written on parchment, dated 1445, exhibiting a statement 
of the dues payable from several crofts in the town and its immediate 
vicinity, for upholding lights in the Lady Chapel, which appears 
to have stood near to the present harbour. In this document the 
following streets and crofts are enumerated, viz. Neugate, Seygate, 
Neumarcatgate, Marcatgate, Grymysby, Mylgate, Lortburngate, 
■ Appylgate, Ratonraw, and Cobgate. These are all now built upon 
as streets, with the exception of Newgate, which is only partially 
occupied with houses. Grimsby was built upon during the latter 
part of the last century. To what extent the other places men- 
tioned in the roll were built upon in the fifteenth century, we have 
no means of determining. In ancient times, Cobgate was the name 
given to that part of the High Street which is below, and Raton- 
raw to that part of it which is above, the present parish church. 

Eminent Characters. — We are not aware of any distinguished 
warrior, statesman, or author, connected with the parish, either by 
birth or residence. It is the burial-place, however, of one of the 
kings of Scotland ; William the Lion having been interred in the 
Abbey, which he founded. 

Land-oioners. — The superiority of the property is vested in the 
corporation of Arbroath. 

Parochial Registers.— These consist of the kirk-session minutes, 
whose earhest date is 1669 ; and of the records of births and bap- 
tisms, and of marriage-contracts and marriages, which commence 
m 1659. They are in general in a good state of preservation. 
The entries of marriages are defective in 1659, 1661, 1696, 1697, 
1698, and 1700; and of births and baptisms in 1660, 1661, 1696, 
1697, 1698, 1699, and 1700; and the volume or volumes contain- 
ing both, from 1735 to 1748 inclusive, have been lost. There is 
no record of the proceedings of the kirk-session from 1684 to 1732, 
nor from 1735 to 1748. 

 Antiquities.— Under the head of antiquities Arbroath has been 
long celebrated for the ruins of its abbey. This edifice was 
tounded by King William the Lion in 1178, and dedicated to the 
memory of Thomas a Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury. The 
precincts of the abbey were inclosed with a stone wall from 20 to 
4 ieet m height; and formed an area 1150 feet in length from 



78 FORFARSIIlllE. 

north to south, and in breadth 70G Ceet at the north, an4 484 at 
the south end. At the north-west corner there is a tower, stiil 
entire, 24 feet square and 70 feet high, formerly used as the Re- 
gahty prison. The ground-flat is now converted into a butcher's 
shop. Another tower, somewhat smaller, stood at the south-west 
corner of the inclosure ; which, with the addition of a slated spire, 
served for many years as a steeple to the present parish church. 
Having become ruinous, it was taken down in 1830, and a remark- 
ably handsome spire, 152 feet in height, has been erected in its 
place. The main entry to the area was by a stately porch on the 
north side. If it had not been that, a few years ago, the vaulting 
was taken down under an apprehension of insecurity, this would 
have been entire, 'or defence it appears to have been furnished 
with a portcullis, which now forms the armorial bearings of the 
town of Arbroath. There was another entry, but far inferior in 
architectural display, at the south-east corner, known by the name 
of the Darncjate. A considerable portion of the north side of the 
inclosure was occupied by the abbey church. The dimensions of 
this building were,— length, 270 feet; length of transept, 132 
feet; of the nave, 148 feet; and of the choir, 76 1 feet; breadth 
of transept, 45, feet; of the central aisle, 35 feet; and of each 
of the side aisles, 16 feet. From marks, visible on the walls, the 
height from the pavement to the roof appears to have been 67 
feet. The building is now in a state of ruin. All that remams 
is the south wall, with part of the east and west ends. A por- 
tion of the two western towers still exists in a very mutdated 
condition. The great entrance at the west end of the church is 
entire, with indications of a circular window above. A similar 
window, on a smaller scale, is to be seen in the upper part of the 
wall of the south transept. The other windows which remain are 
in the early-pointed or lancet-shaped style. The pillars which 
supported the roof of the church are all demolished; but then- 
foundations may be traced without difficulty. Adjommg to the 
south transept, on the east, is a building, said to have been the 
charter-house of the abbey. It consists of two vaulted apart- 
ments, the one above the other, in a state of good repair. Imme- 
diately in front of this, and of the south transept, appear to have 
been the cloisters ; and at a short distance from the south wal of 
■ the nave, are the remains of the abbot's house, whicli is still inha- 
bited as a private mansion. On the whole, the buddings, although,

when entire, they must have had an imposing aspect, were infe- 
rior, in point of magnificence, to some others of which Scotland 
could boast. Little is known respecting the history of the abbey, 
although it was much celebrated in its day. The monks were 
brought from Kelso, and were of the Tyronensian order. The 
abbot exercised episcopal jurisdiction within his precincts, and had 
a seat in Parliament. Of those invested with this dignity, two 
may be mentioned as distinguished, — Gawin Douglas, who was 
afterwards bishop of Dunkeld; and Cardinal Beaton, who held this 
along with his other dignities, and who appears, during his incum- 
bency, to have alienated part of the property of the abbey. After 
the Reformation, the revenues and unalienated possessions of this 
wealthy establishment were erected into a temporal lordship in fa- 
vour of Lord Claude Hamilton, third son of the Duke of Chatel- 
herault. Lord Arbroath is one of the present titles of the Duke 
of Hamilton. These revenues afterwards came to the Earl of 
Dysart, from whom Patrick, first Earl of Panmure, in 1642, pur- 
chased them, including the patronage of thirty-four parish churches. 
In Thomson's account of the abbey the following statements are 
given of the revenues at the time of the reformation. " At the 
visitation of the monasteries in the years 1561 and 1562, by the 
commissioners appointed by the privy-council, the revenue of this 
establishment, as registered in the various books of the commis- 
sioners, were found in money and in kind to be :— 1, By the Re- 
gister of the Collectors of the third of the ecclesiastical benefices,

tions, which was returned soon after 1561, gives, in addition to the 
salmon, three barrels of Z...r. grilses and the valuation of the 
churches of Abernethy, Tannadice, and Monifieth thus :- Abei-

books, both of surplus and annexation of the third of the ecclesias- 
tical benefices, give L.2594 as the money revenue; and m all the J 
other articles they agree with the registers of the -Hectoi. and of | 
assumptions, except in the single article salmon. In 1530 the 1 
ordrissued for the yearly provision for the abbey was, to purchase 
itZZi 180 oxL, 11 barrels of salmon 1200 dried cod fish, 
82 chalders of malt, 30 of wheat, and 40 of meal, m addition to 
the rent in kind paid by the tenants. This may seem extraordi 
nary, inasmuch as the number of monks was only twen y-five But 
it is accounted for when we consider that visitors of all ranks, in- 
cluding at times the king himself, with a retinue of nobles, weie 
lit'ously entertained in such estabhshments.

ance of either. Only it deserves to be noticed that the spire of 
the church, which was rebuilt in 1831, is one of the most elegant 
structures of the kind to be seen in Scotland, and reflects much 
credit on the architect, Mr Henderson of Edinburgh. It is in what 
is commonly designated the Gothic style, and was erected at the 
expense of L. 1300, a considerable part of which was raised by 
voluntary subscription. The Episcopal chapel has a plain exterior, 
but is neatly fitted up within. The dissenting meeting-houses are 
of a very homely aspect, but most of them, nevertheless, are groan- 
ing under a load of debt. The Town-house is a handsome build- 
ing, erected in 1806. Besides the great hall, which is an elegant 
room, it contains an office for the use of the town-clerk, and apart- 
ments for the meeting of the town-council and the small-debt court. 
In the upper part of the building is the prison, which is now made 
secure, and is kept in excellent order. The Guild-hall is a plain 
unostentatious edifice. The Trades-hall was -erected in 1814, 
at an expense, the weight of which is still felt by the incorpora- 
tions. The academy, built partly by private subscription in 
1821, has a chaste appearance. In front is an excellent play- 
ground for the scholars. Amongst the public buildings in the pa- 
rish may be mentioned the Signal-tower for communicating with 
the Bell-Rock hght-house, which is twelve miles distant, on a rock 
m the ocean. Several of these structures are built of stone brought 
from the shores of the Firth of Forth, whilst others are composed 
ot a red sandstone from quarries in the immediate neighbourhood. 
Ut this last kind of stone most of the houses in Arbroath are built. 
I he colour, however, does not appear to be a favourite one, as 
many of the proprietors have lately painted the outside of their 
houses, so as to give them the appearance of a light gray. The 
town, as a whole, cannot be called handsome. Part of the High 

although elegant houses are to be met with in most quarters of the 

cZ'.f ' f " ''' ''''y appearance; and, in the 
cross streets, many of the houses are only one storey in height.

much more attended to than it was thirty or forty years ago. The 
shibboleth, by which a native of Arbroath may be detected most 
readily, is his pronunciation of any word in which the letters o and 
i are found in conjunction, as in the words oil, spoil, anoint, point, 
&amp;c. It is impossible to exhibit on paper the sound which a na- 
tive of Arbroath gives to these words; but a stranger who has 
once heard it, will never forget it. 

In regard to the general habits of the population, if it be asked 
whether the working-classes are cleanly or otherwise, the reply 
must be in the affirmative, when compared with the appearance of 
the same classes in some of the larger towns. And if the question 
be put, whether the people in general enjoy, in a reasonable de- 
gree, the comforts and advantages of society, it may be stated, 
that most of the old men and women belonging to the class of 
operatives are very poor, in consequence of the difficulty of finding 
employment in that particular department of work, viz. winding 
yarn, and spinning at the wheel, by which they were enabled, some 
years ago, to earn a living. Many also in the same class, who 
have not passed the vigour of mature age, are in very straitened 
circumstances, — especially weavers, whose wages are extremely 
low. This is particularly the case where there is a family of young 
children who have not arrived at an age to be able to do any thing 
for themselves. In a great many, however, of those cases where 
extreme poverty is observable, the people are the main cause of 
their own wretchedness. The head of the family frequents the 
tippling-house, where he spends no inconsiderable portion of his 
earnings ; and thus the wife and children are left in misery. In 
connection with this, and as accounting for much of the prevailing 
poverty, it may be noticed, that comparatively few young men or 
women in the operative class, while they remain unmarried, ever 
think of saving any part of their wages ; and that most of them 
enter into the married state without any previous provision for the 
probable expenses even of a humble family establishment. Nine- 
tenths of the distress to be found in Arbroath may be traced to 
these sources. And if potatoes, with a sprinkling of salt, have in 
many instances been almost the only species of food attainable in 
families, it becomes a serious question, involving a high moral re- 
sponsibility, how far absence from the tippling-house, combined 
with previous habits of economy, might have elevated such fami- 
lies above the necessity of subsisting on such scanty fare. The 
evil, however, exists already; and it is no easy matter to cure it, 



86 FORFARSHIRE, 



especially as a great majority of the sufferers seem to thmk, or at 
least wish it to be understood, that they are not themselves blame- 
able. All their evils, they conceive, are to be ascribed to the go- 
vernment of the country 5 and they look, with a delusive hope to 
a reformed parliament as a cure for their every sorrow  A the 
same time, it is not to be conceived that these apparently condem- 
natory remarks are universally applicable. Amongst the operative 
class of society in Arbroath, we have found a numerous body ot 
men and women whose habits are alike industrious and frugal,- 
who are exemplary in a discharge of the duties of morality and re- 
lio-ion,-and have evinced a commendable patience in the endur- 
ance of that adversity which may have fallen to then- lot. ISot a 
little of the theological attainment. Christian practice, and evan- 
gelical zeal existing in the parish, is to be found in this rank of 
life Several of the most enlightened and efficient of the Sabbath- 
school teachers in the place belong to the same class ; and the ex- 
ample they have given of a well-ordered conversation has been 
blessed to many around them. «.  j 

The state of society in Arbroath has, we be ieve been affected 
considerably by the great number of bankruptcies wh.ch took place 
in the yearsL. In that memorable year several ot the most .n- 
d„ r ous and honest men in the town, .ho had reahzed what wa. 
t them an ample fortune, were ruined; but, on e other- 
many of the failures were altogether mexcusable,-ldie bankrupt 
ZZg scarcely ever had a penny which they could legally call 
thdr own. Not a few of this latter class have been dnven, appa- 
ent y for ever, from the circle in which they once affected to move, 
but kto which they ought never to have been admitted. In conse- 
auen 1 both the commercial and the moral atmosphere of the town 
toe b en in some degree purified. These would-be-gen lemen 
toe shrunk back to their original obscurity; or, . any of them 
arTstill occasionally heard of, it is only as the rallymg pornt o

As illustrative of the general character of the population, it is 
worthy of notice, that, considering the limited extent of means, 
subscriptions for any public or benevolent purpose, which of late 
have been frequent, have, in almost every instance, met with dis- 
tinguished success. In proof, also, of an improved tone of senti- 
ment, it may be observed, that the smuggling of gin from the con- 
tinent, which, thirty or forty years ago, was in such repute as to 
enable smugglers from the coast of Kent to aspire after matrimo- 
nial alliances with respectable families in the town, would now sub- 
ject the man who was known to engage in traffic of this kind to 
public scorn. 

One great source of demoralization in large towns has not yet 
found a place in Arbroath, viz. paion-hroking establishments ; — al- 
though we regret to be under the necessity of stating, that in some 
■ of the low public houses, articles of wearing apparel, and even bed- 
clothes, are taken as a pledge for payment of the Hquor consumed. 

From the foregoing remarks it will be seen, that, as is the case 
in other communities of the same extent, there is a mixture of 
good and evil in the society of Arbroath; — whilst some of the 
particulars here noticed may serve to indicate where and how the 
application of moral means may be used with a view to the cure of 
existing evils. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy.— The whole of the land in the 
parish is in a state of cultivation ; and the only portion of it appa- 
rently which has never been under the plough, is a common of 
twenty-six acres, which is in pasture. The ordinary rotation of 
crops is, \st, grass; 2f, oats; Qd, green crop, viz. potatoes or tur- 
nip ; and, m, barley. The rent of land is L. 6 per acre near to 
the town,— gradually diminishing as the distance is greater, till, 
at the farther extremity of the parish, it is only L. 1, 10s. per acre. 
The average rent of land throughout the parish may be stated at 
L. 2. 10s. per acre. Farm-servants, viz. males, are hired per half- 
year at L. 5 or L. 6; and female labourers are hired, for the day, 
at from 6d. to 8d. ' 

Manufactures.— The principal manufactures carried on in Ar- 
broath are those of yarn spun from flax and tow,— canvas, brown and 
bleached linen, leather, cast-iron, bone-dust, tallow-candles, &amp;c. 

lixclusive of those in the suburbs, the number of mills in the 



88 FORFARSHIRE. 

parish for spinning yarn is four, at which are employed 159 men 
and boys, and 234 women and girls, in all 393. The workmg 
hours are 12 per day; and the average weekly wages are, for 
men, from 10s. 6d. to 15s. 6d., and for boys 3s. 3d. ; for women, 
from 4s. 6d. to 5s. 3d., and for girls 3s. 6d. The number of can- 
vas weavers employed by persons residing in the parish is 316. 
Their working hours are 12 per day, and their weekly wages 7s. 6d. 
The following is the number of persons employed by residenters in 
the parish, connected with the linen manufacture ; viz. 1173 wea- 
vers, who, at 14 working hours per day, may earn each, on an ave- 
rage, 6s. of wages per week ; the number of women employed as 
winders is 372, whose weekly wages may be stated at 3s. ; 25jBen 
employed aswarpersat 12s. each per week; 31 starchers at 10s. 6d.; 
and 25 lappers and overseers at 15s. per week. . , , 

Navigation.- ks a sea-port, Arbroath has kept pace with the 
increasing population of the place. In 1781, there be onged to 
the harbour 18 vessels, registering 900 tons. In 1791, there were 
32 vessels, registering 1704 tons. At present, the number ol ves- 
sels belonging to the harbour is 77, registering 6700 tons, in 
1831, the number of arrivals from foreign ports was 66, and ot 
coasting arrivals 543. In 1832, the arrivals from foreign ports 
amounted to 60, and coasting arrivals to 538.

cupies its whole extent, with the exception of the small croft of Barn 
Green, and the streets within the former precincts of the Abbey. 
In 1831, the population of the country part of the royalty was 
319, and of the town part 5485; leaving 1139 as the population 
of the district which is without the royalty. But, in order to show 
the actual extent of the town and its connected suburbs, it is ne- 
cessary to include that portion of the latter which is situated in the 
adjoining parish of St Vigeans. The population, at different pe- 
riods, will then appear as follows :

The date of the erection of Arbroath into a royal burgh cannot 
now be ascertained. The most ancient charter extant is one grant- 
ed by James VI. in the year 1599; wherein the town is recogniz- 
ed as having previously enjoyed similar privileges. It has been 
pretended that these privileges were originally bestowed by Kinff 
Wilham the Lion, the founder of the abbey. But, in point of 
fact, before the Reformation, Arbroath appears to have been 
merely the abbot's burgh ; one of the two bailies, by whom the 
town was governed, having been chosen by the abbot. The head 
of the Airly famdy is said to have been heritable baihe of regality, 
or acknowledged as such, for many years. According to the seS 
ot the burgh, the magistrates and town-council must not consist of 
more than nineteen, nor of fewer than seventeen, persons ; and the 
number must be made up of a provost, two bailies; a dean of gu Id 
and treasurer, with the addition of the convener of the incorpo- 
rated trad and two trades councilIors,-the other nine or eleven

Prior to the vvnion of the kingdoms, Arbroath sent a represen- 
tative to the Scottish Parliament. Afterwards, it was jomed with 
Montrose, Brechin, Bervie, and Aberdeen m iturning a member 
to the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Under the provisions 
of the Reform Bill, Forfar has been substituted for Aberdeen 
The number of voters within the new boundaries marked off for 
Lroath is 472, amongst a population of 11,446. In the burgi 
proper, or that part of the town under the jurisdiction of the ma- 
gistratL, containing a population of 5804, the number of dwelling- 
houses valued at L. 10 of Y-ly -"t euid upwanls, is 135 viz.

any tax imposed for paving and lighting the streets. This has 
been done hitherto at the expense of the corporation of the burgh. 
There is, at the same time, a great want of public wells for sup- 
plying the inhabitants with water. Attached to most of the houses, 
indeed, there is a pump or draw-well in the back court. But the 
water to be had from these is generally hard, and not adapted to 
some of the uses to which such a commodity is applied. 

Means of Communication enjoyed hy the Parish. — Of these, the 
post-office is one of the most important. The mail passes through 
Arbroath from the north every evening at half-past eight o'clock, 
and from the south every morning at half-past two. The only 
ground of complaint in regard to the carrying of letters is the 
want of a cross post to Forfar. 

The length of turnpike roads in the parish, without including 
that part of the road which forms the boundary of the parish, is 
almost two miles. The length of streets in that part of the town 
of Arbroath which is within the parish is 8913 yards. Including 
the suburbs in St Vigeans' parish, the total length of streets 
within the connected buildings, which may be said to constitute 
the town, is 15,622 yards. The streets, with the houses and gar- 
p dens attached to them, in both parishes, cover an extent of 201 
English acres, of which 107 are in the parish of Arbroath. 

In addition to the mail-coach, there are several stage-coaches, 
which either start from Arbroath, or pass through it, and thus fa- 
cihtate the means of communication with other parts of the coun- 
try. Such are the New Times from Aberdeen to Perth, the 
Highlander from Montrose to Dundee, and the Commercial Tra- 
veller from Arbroath to Dundee, every lawful day; together with 
a coach from Arbroath to Forfar, generally once a-week, on Wed- 
nesdays. The principal inn or hotel, kept by Seaton, affords 
ample and excellent accommodation for travellers. There is a 
second inn likewise, where the lodging and entertainment are con- 
sidered good. 

There is neither canal nor rail-road in the parish, although sur- 
veys have been made, with a view either to the one or the other 
between Arbroath and Forfar. 

As a means of communication between those parts of the town

merits attention. The first intimation on record of such a conve- 
nience is an agreement between the abbot and the mhabitants o 
the town in the year 1394, by which the contracting parties bound 
themselves to erect a pier for the accommodation of such vessels 
as might resort to the place. The abbot submitted to bear the 
greater share of the expense, in consideration of a certam yearly 
duty to be paid to him out of every rood of land withm the burgh 
This pier, which was of wood, having been found msufficient it 
was resolved, in the year 1725, to remove the harbour from the 
foot of the East Causeway or High Street, where it had hitherto 
been, to the west side of the Brothock. The principal part of th 
new erection, which is faced with stone, consists of a basm about 
124 yards long by 80 broad. The entrance from the sea is at the 
south-west corner, where it is contracted to the widh of 3 feet 
and defended, when necessary, against the swell of he o ean by 
means of fourteen or fifteen beams of wood, which can be let down 
in a few minutes into a groove on each side and secu 
the top by bars of iron. It is still farther defended from the sea 
n stormy' by an outer bulwark of stone. The harbour is 
dry at Jw water. At its entrance, there is at spring .des a depth 
of 15 or 16 feet of water ; and at neap tides, of 9 or 10 feet. But 
there is a bax of rock at a short distance from its mouth, which pre- 
eni: vessels of large burthen from entering it. Arbroath . 
considered merely as a creek belonging to the port of Montrose 
and shipmasters laboured under the inconvenience of being ob hged 
to trave'l all that distance before their vessels could be c eai-ed oi t

St Abb's Head. When the tides are neap, the rock is scarcely 
uncovered at low water. But at spring tides, when the ebb is great- 
est, that part of the rock which is exposed to view at low water, 
measures about 427 feet in length by 230 feet in breadth ; and at 
this state of the tide, its average height above the surface of the 
sea may be stated at four feet. From the higher part of the rock 
a reef extends, in a south-western direction, about 1000 feet. At 
high water the rock is wholly covered, to the depth of from ten to 
twelve feet. The light-house is of a circular form. The two first 
courses of the masonry are sunk into the rock ; and the stones of 
all the courses are of dove-tailed work. The ground-course is 42 
feet in diameter ; and the building gradually diminishes, till, as it 
rises to the top of the parapet wall of the light-room, it is only 13 
feet in diameter. The total height of the masonry is 100 feet ; 
but, including the light-room, the height is 115 feet. From the 
foundation, the edifice is solid to the height of 30 feet. Here is 
the entry, to which there is an ascent by means of a rope-ladder 
with wooden steps. At the door the walls are seven feet thick ; 
but gradually diminish, till, at the parapet wall of the light, the' 
thickness is only one foot. The light-room, which is 15 feet in 
height by 12 in breadth, is of an octagonal form. The windows 
have cast-iron frames, with plates of polished glass a quarter of an 
mch thick. The light, which in clear weather is visible at sea at 
the distance of eighteen miles, is from oil, with argand burners 
placed in the focus of silver-plated reflectors, of the form of a pa- 
rabohc curve, and of the diameter of two feet. The light revolves 
turning on its axis once in six minutes, in the course of which a 
bright and a dark-red light are alternately exhibited. Two laiw 
bells attached to the light-house are tolled in foggy weather, by 
means of the machinery which moves the lights. At Arbroath a 
suit of buildings has been erected, where each light-keeper has 
three apartments for the accommodation of his family. Three of 
the hght-keepers are always at the light-house, where they remain 
SIX weeks at a time, after which they are a fortnight on shore with 
then- families. Connected with the apartments for their accom- 
modation, a signal-tower has been erected, about fifty feet in heio-ht 
to communicate with the keepers at the rock. The total expanse

soon after the Reformation. At first the parish was viewed as con- 
sisting only of the burgh; but afterwards, the grounds inclosed 
within the walls of the abbey garden, with the croft of Barn-green, 
were also considered as belonging to it. The parish church is si- 
tuated near the centre of that part of the town which is on the east 
side of the Brothock. There are no means, apparently, oi ascer- 
taining the date of its foundation. In the year 1764, it was con- 
siderably enlarged by removing the south wall eight feet back and 
bY adding to the accommodation in the aisle on the "orth s de of 
the church. In each end, and in the aisle, there is a double tier 
of galleries. By recent measurement, it has been found to contain 
1412 sittings, allowing eighteen inches to each. Some of the seats 
in the galleries are very inconvenient, bemg so near to the ceding 
that it Is difficult for a man of ordinary size to stand in them up- 
right. There are no free seats for the poor ; the whole being the 
property either of individuals, or of corporate bodies, vho t' ge- 
nerally to the highest bidder, the sittings not required for their 
immediate use. This has often proved a very serious evil, 
and has been justly complained of. 

The minister of the parish has neither manse nor glebe. In 
the year 1701, the arable ground and grass withm the abbey gar- 
den which had been bestowed on the Bishop of Brechm dunng 
the reign of protestant episcopacy, and -"''' 
at the Revolution, were granted - -se-hold to Mr Fergusson

There is also a permanent assistant minister in the parish, who 
I officiates as a colleague, and has the charge of one of the two dis- 
tricts into which the parish is divided. His stipend arises partly 
from the proceeds of an endowment of L. 790, the commencement 
.of which was a bequest of L. 565 by a Convener Mill in 1776. 
The scanty income which this could afford was made up by the 
people, at first to L. 50, and afterwards to L. 60 or L. 70. A large 
portion of the emoluments of the session clerkship has since been 
added, and the sum given by the people greatly increased ; so that, 
durmg the last year of the incumbency of the writer of this, the 
proceeds amounted to L. 180. ' 

The patronage of the parish belonged formerly to the Earl of 
Panmure, but was forfeited to the Crown in 1715. The patronage 
oi the office of assistant-minister of the parish is vested in the kirk- 
session. 

The population of the parish having greatly increased, a chapel 
of ease was erected m 1797, in the north-east corner of the abbey 

 grounds, under the name of the Abbey Chapel. It accommodates 
1268 persons, allowing eighteen inches to each sitter. As in the 

iparish church, so here also the seats are private property. No

supper, and baptize the children of those parishioners who are

members of the Established church, provided they are sitters in 
the chapel. His stipend is L. 102, arising from a rate nnposed 
on the seats or pews, according to their valuation at the time when 
the chapel was built. The patronage is vested m those ot the 
proprietors of pews who are members of the Established chuich. 
But it is not necessary, in order to qualify a proprietor to vote, 
that he should be a sitter in the chapel. In fact, it cannot be 
said that the congregation have the choice of their Por i5y 
the constitution it is provided, that a majority of the committee of 
management must be members of the kirk-session of the Paush 

Arbroath is the seat of a presbytery consisting of eleven pa- 
rishes, vithin the bounds of the synod of Angus and Mearns 
From the presbytery, two ministers and a ruling elder are sent 
to the General Assembly of Church of Scotland. 

As ilht be expected, there are several dissenting meeting- 
houses, viz. one Episcopal, containing 381 sittings; two belong- 
tg to the United Secession Synod, the first of which has accom 
mdation for 780, and the latter for 600 sitters ; one:' • 
M for 400 • and one Congregational or Independent, with 4UU 
ittil; be'sides smaller plfcesf meeting for Glassites, Bereans, 
ai d Baitists. The church accommodation for all classes of di.- 
Itel mTbe stated at 2700 sitti while that withm the pa e 
of he EsYabhshed church is 2680 sittings. In the suburbs m 
L tariS of St Vigeans, there is a Wesleyan Methodist meeting- 
tuse which will Accommodate 300 ; and one belonging to the 
house, wnicii will cxv. ,  e onn Vnr tVip town and

profess to allow to their minister the same sum, without a house 
and garden. However it may be at present, a few years ago the 
members were unable, or unwilling, to raise that sum ; and the 
minister, who is since dead, having obtained a grant of any collec- 
tions which might be made at an evening service, was supported, 
m a great measure, by the voluntary contributions of members of 
the Established church, who attended that service and pitied his 
case. The Relief minister is understood to have L. 60 per an- 
num allowed to him ; whilst all that can be said of the emoluments 
of the Congregational or Independent minister is, that they must 
be miserably poor. Amongst the Glassites, Bereans, and Baptists, 
the ministerial service is gratuitously performed. From the fore- 
gomg statement it will be seen, that none of the livings, whether 
in or out of the Establishment, are great. And it may be noticed 
in passing, that, within the period of a very few years, three dis- 
senting ministers have been literally starved out of the town by 
their congregations.

Divine service in the Established church is in general well at- 
tended. There is evening service in the parish church durino- five 
months m the year, commencing in the month of April. Such a 
service,-even if it were continued all the year round,— may be 
deemed almost necessary, as, in many families, circumstances, often 
unavoidable, occur, which prevent some of the inmates from getting 
out to church during the day. Yet it is to be feared that the lau- 
dable object for which " the exercise,' as it is familiarly termed 
was ongmally established, has come to be abused. Many of those 
who attend might be better employed in instructing their children 
at home. Among the dissenters, with whom such services are 
common, the evening is accounted the grand diet. The best pre- 
pared discourse is reserved till then, and seats are provided fo all 

keepmg up the money concerns of the meeting-house. Amidst the 
good which might result from evening services in Arbroath, if at 
i ended only by those for whom they are necessary, this e;il has 
arisen, that they have tended to add to the number of thos be

Deputations from most of the leading religious institutions in 
the united kingdom visit Arbroath in the course of the season. A 
few years ago, when it was presumed that a Catholic spirit pervaded 
the several bodies of Dissenters, the collections, made up chiefly 
of what was given by members of the EstabHshed church, were in 
general liberal. But they have fallen much off since the Dissen- 
ters began to exhibit a spirit of sectarian virulence against the Es- 
tablishment. In the parish church and chapel of ease, collections 
have been made from time to time in aid of the Scottish Mission- 
ary, the Bible and the Gaehc school societies, as well as the Ge- 
neral Assembly's schools, and the General Assembly's mission to 
India. No record, apparently, has been kept of these collections, 
so that the amount cannot be exhibited. On the whole, however, 
the total amount subscribed and collected annually in the parish 
for religious purposes may be stated at about L. 130 or L. 140.

In the foregoing table, are included, as unable to read or write, 
those only, who, by their own confession, or that of their parents 
 gLdi U hve'never been taught even the first pnnc,pes of 
reading or writing. But those are not included, whose nability to 
read or write has been occasioned by blindness, insanity, or any 
other physical detect. It may likewise be stated, that many of 
tho who have left school, and who profess to be able to read or 
write can do so very imperfectly. We have not, however, the 
of distinguishing sLch from others who have so profited by 
their education as to enjoy the advantages arising from . . 

In the parish there are in all twenty-four schools four ot 
wh h, connected with an establishment which as of late been 
termed the Arbroath Academy, are under one root. These four 
are endowed,-and may be viewed as having come in place ot what 
was orTgrnally the parochial schooh The other schools m the 
pSsh are unendowed. One ot them is supported by an associa- 
Uon termed the Arbroath Female Benevolent Society for the in- 
, .tT„r™tuitou«ly, of poor children. The school-house was 
1 "ottnl ised'by subscription. An infant school was 
es atTshed in 1831,-and is supported partly by subscription, and 
par by means oJ school fees. Besides these, there are two 
Sools tor the instruction ot young ladies in e useful and ele- 
InTbranches of female education. And, m addition to these,

When the erection of the academy was contemplated, in 1820, the 
magistrates, with a view to obtain the assistance of the public, pro- 
posed that every person, subscribing L. 10, or upwards, to the in- 
tended building, should be a director for Hfe, and have a vote in 
the appointment of the masters, with the exception of the rector 
the nomination of whom remains with the magistrates and the pa- 
rish minister as before. In the unendowed schools in the parish, 
taught by males, the average fees, per quarter, are, — English 4s. ; 
do. with writing, 5s. ; do. do. with arithmetic, 6s. 6d. The fees at 
schools taught by elderly women, are, commonly, three half-pence

ever, there is an improvement in this respect.-There is a pubhc 
library, the property of which is vested in the shareholders ihe 
purchase money is L. 3, besides half a guinea of annual subscrip- 
tion. The number of volumes in the library is upwards of 4000, 
of which one-fourth consists of novels and romances, and one- 
eighth of voyages and travels. It contains the leading montlily

ter and Kirk-session ; and, in addition to this, a sum annually to 
twenty poor householders, which at present yields about L. 3, 10s. 
to each. 

A Destitute Sick Society was instituted in 1812. Several sums 
have been bequeathed to it since that period, which will have the 
effect of rendering it permanent ; but it depends for support chiefly 
on voluntary contribution. The sums distributed weekly to each 
patient, vary from one shilling to half-a-crown ; — the average may 
be stated at eighteen pence. The average annual expenditure is 
about L. 73. That during the year 1831, was L. 75, 15s. 

There have been several Friendly Societies connected with the 
parish, some of which have failed in consequence of the inaccuracy 
of the calculations made at the outset. The Glovers' Friendly 
Society, which was instituted in 1802, has since been remodelled 
on approved principles. Another, styled the Arbroath and . St 
Vigeans' Friendly Society, was estabhshed in 1830, on principles 
which bid fair to enable it to succeed.

there are accounts kept in the name of individuals for behoof of 
temporary societies, consisting of from 50 to 80 mdividuals, who 
pay each sixpence or a shilling weekly, which accumulates till a 
term, when it is uphfted for the purpose of paying rents, &amp;c. bince 
1830, two societies have been formed in the village of Auchmithie, 
in the adjoining parish of St Vigeans, among the fishermen each 
consisting of 25 members, who pay sixpence weekly, and deposit 
the amount in the savings bank. Thus, the ramifications of the 
institution are much farther spread than the number of depositors 
would at first sight appear to indicate.

secured, and every means observed for preserving the health, and 
promoting the comfort, of the prisoners. The jailor is under the 
superintendence of one of the bailies of the town by turns. The 
number of persons confined in the jail, during the year 1831, was 
55, of whom 46 were imprisoned for debt, 6 for theft, and 3 for 
desertion of service. 

Fairs. — Of these there are two held in the parish. Whatever 
may have been the business transacted at them formerly, the whole 
is now confined to the sale chiefly of ready-made shoes, sweet- 
meats, &amp;c. ; while, in the evening, the public houses are crowded 
with the idle and intemperate. 

Inns and Alehouses. — Of these there were, in 1832, within the 
royalty, 85 ; in the parish, without the royalty, 10 ; total within the 
parish 95. Thus there is in the parish, on an average, one public 
house, or place where spirituous hquors are sold, to every 18 fa- 
milies, or to every 40 individuals, of the population of both sexes, 
above 20 years. We have already said that a very large portion 
of the misery which afflicts the labouring classes may be traced to 
habits of intemperance. And one of the causes of the prevalence 
of this vice may fairly be ascribed to the number of public houses 
which are Kcensed. 

Fuel. — The fuel made use of in the parish is coal, imported 
by sea from the counties of Durham and Northumberland. Coal 
is likewise imported from the Firth of Forth, chiefly for the use of 
large manufacturing establishments, where steam is employed as 
the moving power.

PRESBYTERY OF BRECHIN, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEAENS. 

THE REV. HENRY BREWSTER, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, Sfc. — The name of this parish was ancient- 
ly written Fernell, afterwards Fernwall or Farmoall ; but now com- 
monly Farnell. Fernell is said to be of Gaelic origin,— 
signifying a den, and nell a swan ; from which it would appear that 
the name had been taken from a den near the church, which may 
once have been the abode of swans. 

The parish of Kinnaird was disjoined from Farnell, and formed 
into a separate parish, about the year 1633; but was again an- 
nexed all except a small part, which fell into the parish of Bre- 
chin, in 1787. The parish is about three Enghsh miles long, by 
two broad, and consequently contains about six square miles. 
This, however, is exclusive of a large plantation or forest which 
is attached to it, of 1500 or 1600 acres, in a moor called Mon- 
teith-mont Muir : and the property in this parish holds, along 
with others, a right over au extensive undivided common, lying on 
the south, called Rossie muir. 

It is bounded on the east by the parish of Marytown ; on the 
south by Rossie muir ; on the west by the parishes of Kinnell and 
Brechin; and on the north by the parish of Brechin and the 
river South Esk. 

Topographical Appearance and Soil— The lands are generally 
flat,— rising towards the north and along the south side of the 
parish. Extending into the parishes of Marytown and Craig, there 
IS a ridge of hills, but of no considerable height. In these higher 
grounds, as well as in the western district, which has been more 
lately brought under culture, the soil is of an inferior quality, con- 
sisting chiefly of light black earth. The rest of the parish is of

a very rich clay and loamy soil, much resembling that in the 
Carse of Gowrie, between Perth and Dundee ; and is admirably 
adapted for carrying heavy crops of wheat. 

Hydroqraphy.-The South Esk is the only river of any con- 
sequence connected with the parish. It takes its rise among the 
Grampian mountains,-runs close by the south side of the town 
of Brechin, and, after meandering beautifully through the strath, 
discharges itself into the basin formed by the reflux of the sea on 
the west side of Montrose. The part of it which separates Far- 
nell from Brechin is particularly beautiful. The banks are taste- 
fullY wooded ; and there is a pleasure drive along them, which 
opens up at several places into views highly pleasmg and pic- 
turesque. Near the church, also, there is a small rivulet, which, 
though inconsiderable in its ordinary state, swells in ramy seasons 
to an amazing height, overflowing the banks, and laymg the ad- 
ioining fields under water. Means, however, have been recently 
taken for keeping it within its channel, and thus preventing the 
injury which it was apt to occasion. 

IL_CiviL History. 
Land-Owner.-T\.. whole parish is the property of Sir James 
Carnegie, Baronet, of Southesk. A plan of his estates is in the 
course of being formed, every farm being surveyed and msei-ted 
Tthe letting o'f a new lease. That part which lies withm this 
oarish is already almost completed. 

 Parochial Bisters.-These extend back to the year 1699, a 
full and distinct, and apparently kept with great regdanty. But 
those of Knnaird, while it existed as a separate parish, have been 
altogether lost; and no trace or history of them can be ound. 

XL-.-..-On the north side of the church, -l 
circled by the den from which the parish is supposed to take 
name stands an old castle, once the property and residence of the 
O.T;ief of Airly. It is kept in good repair, and part of i is al-

scale of magnificence hardly exceeded, if equalled, by any in this 
part of the country. 

The are two ijieal and two saw-mills in the parish, but no ma- 
nufactories or other mills. One of these saw-mills is occasionally 
employed between twenty and thirty circular saws being fixed 
upon the same axis, at a little distance from each other, for cut- 
ting into dust the jaw bones of whales to make manure for land, 
especially for raising turnip crops.

In 1800 the population amounted to 576 
1811 - - - 382 
 1821 - • s - 599

The population has of late been rather on the decrease, owing 
principally to the uniting of farms, by which the number of tenants 
and labourers and residing families is necessarily diminished.

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy.— Theve are about 3325 acres 
of cultivated land in the parish; and 562 under wood, besides the 
forest of 1500 or 1600 acres, already alluded to. There are about 
600 acres in undivided common, which fall to be divided among 
the parishes of Farnell, Kinnell, Marytown, and Craig. About 
50 of these, m the parish of Farnell, are supposed to be capable 
of being profitably improved. Waste ground is hardly to be seen 
in the parish. 

The wood is planted, and the management as to pruning, &amp;c 
IS judicious. Scotch and larch firs seem to be the species of trees 
best adapted for the soil, and of these chiefly the plantations consist: 
but the different kinds of hard-wood might also be cultivated with 
success as appears from some large old trees about the policies 

Kinnaird, as well as from the thriving state of such as have been 



112 FORFARSHmE. 

more recently planted. The average rent of arable land is about 

40s. per acre.  , . , f ■ „ 

Rate of Wages.-The rate of wages for different kinds of faim- 
labourers and country artisans is, per day, from Is. 4d. to Is. ba. 
in winter ; and from Is. 6d. to 2s. in summer. 

i7..W.y.-Husbandry is in a highly advanced state ; and much 
especially hs been done in the way of draimng. The leases are 
in all ordinary cases for ninetecB years, and are considered favour- 
able to the tenant. The farm-houses and other buildmgs and en- 
closures are in general excellent; and every encouragemen seems 
re g ir L industry and spirit for improvement which exists 
longst the farmers. The ordinary kinds of farm stock are rear- 
ed wifh great success ; and of the prizes given for such by the Fo - 
farshh-e Agricultural Association, the produce of this parish has for 
many Years carried off a distinguished share. 

7rIduce.-The average gross amount and value of raw produce 
yearly raised in the parish may be as follows :

330 sitters. 

The manse was built at different periods ; but all of it since the 
year 1794. It is in good repair. 

There are about seven acres of glebe, valued at L. 18 or L. 20 
a-year. The stipend, since 1811, when it was last augmented, 
has been 134 bolls, 1| pecks meal; 32 bolls potatoe-oats ; and 
97 bolls, 3 firlots, 3| pecks barley ; besides the usual allowance of 
L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. 

There are twelve grown up persons in this parish who attend 
worship at Dissenting chapels in Brechin ; two families, both nu- 
merous, comprising about fourteen members in all, commonly re- 
siding in this parish, attend Episcopahan chapels. The rest of the 
population belongs to the Established church ; and divine service 
is in general well attended. The average number of communicants 
at the Established church for some years past has been about 275. 

An annual church collection is made for religious purposes ; 
which, after deducting the average collection for the poor, has 
hitherto amounted to L. 9 or L. 10 a-year. 

Education.— Besides the parish school, there are two schools 
taught by females for young children, and for the branches pecu- 
liar to girls. These are supported by school fees, and the teachers 
have each a salary and free house allowed by the family of South- 
esk; there are also two Sabbath schools, both numerously attended. 

The salary of the parochial teacher is L.30; the amount of 
school fees received probably from L.20 to L.24 a-year. He has 
the legal accommodations. The school fees per quarter are 2s. 6d 
for readmg; and 6d. additional, either for writing or arithmetic; and 
Is. for both. It is behoved that all persons in the parish above 
SIX years of age are able to read. 

Lib7-a7y.— There is a parish library, consisting of religious books; 
1 and a tan- proportion of readers resorts to it. 

• f'''''I7' '"" """" P'''°" receiving parochial aid 
IS trom hiteen to twenty ; and the average allowance to each is from 
three to six shillings per month ; though in some instances consider-

money which is distributed for purchasing coals.

PRESBYTERY OF BRECHIN, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. ANDREW FERGUSSON, MINISTER. 



I- — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Boundaries, -c— The name of Marytown was probably 
given to this parish in honour of the Virgin Mary,— a well on the 
border of the parish still retaining the name of Marywell. The 
parish is bounded by the river South Esk, and the basin commonly 
called the back sands, of Montrose on the north; by the parish 
of Craig on the east; by the sea and the parish of Lunan on the 
south ; and by the parish of Farnell on the west. 

Its extent from east to west is about a mile and a-half ; and from 
north to south three miles. 

Topographical Appearances.— K small ridge of hills run through 
It from east to west, dividing it into two estates,— Old Montrose 
and Dysart. The sea coast, which forms the boundary of the latter 
consists of very high rocks, which afford shelter to a variety of sea 
towl. Marytown Laio, which forms a part of that ridge, is a con- 
siderable emmence founded on a rock 300 or 400 feet above the 
level of the sea. It is evidently artificial, and probably in old times 
was ei her an alarm-post, as it commands aVery expensive Z] 
both of sea and land ; or a place where the great family of Mon 
trose admimstered justice to its vassals. The top ofit affords

ZooZoW.-In the river South Esk, «hich forms the northern 
boundaf/of the parUh, there is abundance oJ 
trout, &amp;c. In the month of May, a great 'P-y .'" 
small trout called smouts make their appearance. It is a,d thatthey 
ir he salmon fry spawned the preceding autumn and are then go- 
Z down from the rLr to the sea, where they arnve at maturity. A

mains. The other estate, Dysart, belongs to David Carnegy, Esq. 
of Craigo. Neither of the heritors reside in the parish. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial register begins in 1738, 
and has been regularly kept since that time ; and part of a previ- 
ous register remains. 

HI. — Population. 

By Dr Webster's report in 1755, the population was - 633 

By last Statistical Account in 1793, - - 529 

By the census in 1801, - - _ . 595 

in 1821, - - - . 451 

in 1831, - - _ _ 429 

A decrease of 177 thus appears to have taken place in the last 
thirty years. It may be remarked, however, that, when the census 
was taken last year, there were twenty men employed at an em- 
bankment of the river South Esk, who will remain in this parish 
no longer than while employed at that work; so that the real popu- 
lation of the parish at present is not more than 400, being a de- 
crease of 200, or one-third of the whole population, since the be- 
gmnmg of the present century. The cause of that decrease is evi- 
dently the enlargement of the farms, and the consequent removal 
of the cottagers. Thirty years ago, the number of farmers resid- 
mg m the parish was fourteen. At present the whole land is occu- 
pied by seven, of whom only four reside in the parish.

six acres of good land. The stipend is L. 85, 6s. lid. Sterling, 
including communion element money ; 124 bolls meal and barley, 
one-half each, and 1 boll 2 firlots oats, being the whole teinds 
of the parish, amounting at an average to L. 200. The Crown is 
patron. 

Education. — At the parochial school, the usual branches of edu- 
cation, besides Latin, are taught. The schoolmaster's salary is 
L. 30, and the other emoluments of his office may amount to 
L. 15. He is provided with a dwelling-house, which was lately re- 
paired at a considerable expense, and with a garden of nearly the 
extent required by law. All persons in the parish upwards of 6 
years of age can read. 

Sunday schools were established in this parish many years ago. 
At present there are two, which are attended by sixty scholars. 
The best scholars at the week-day-school are always to be found 
among those who have attended a Sunday school. 

Libraries. — Parish libraries have become general, and have been 
productive of beneficial effects. There was one estabhshed here 
several years ago, which consists of more than 200 volumes, be- 
sides nearly 100 pamphlets. There are not a few of the people 
who shew a laudable desire for these books, and avail themselves 
of them. 

Poor. — The number on the poors' roll receiving parochial aid 
monthly, is 12 ; and the average sum allowed to each is 3s. 
9d. ; but besides the monthly allowance, there are occasional dis- 
tributions to the most indigent. The poors' funds arise from 
the interest at five per cent, of a stock of L. 400, lodged with 
the principal heritor, and the collections at the church, amounting 
to L. 18 or L. 20 a-year,— together with a small perquisite for the 
use of the mortcloth. The demand upon the funds is in some re- 
spects greater than it was some years ago. In consequence of the 
introduction of machinery to a great extent in manufactories, fe- 
males in the country can find little or no employment, except 
when hired to the field for a short time in summer and harvest. 
Spmnmg, which formeriy afforded them employment throughout the 
year, now brings no return, and the wheel has therefore been un- 
wilhngly laid aside. Nevertheless, the poor are not discontented ; 
they thankfully receive from the kirk-session the sum allotted to 
them, and they strictly apply it to their subsistence. There are 
no beggars belonging to this parish; but the parish is much infest- 



122 



FORFARSHIRE. 



ed with beggars and vagrants from other quarters, who consume not 
a httle of what should go to the support of the parochial poor. 

Alehouses, There is much reason to comp am of the num- 
ber of houses licensed for selUng spirits on the public roads, though 
there is only one house of that description in this parish : it is on 
the highway leading from Montrose to Arbroath. 

Fuel -The fuel chiefly used is coals, brought from the harbours 
of Montrose and Old Montrose, which cost Ud. or 15d. the English 
barrel weighing nine stones odds. But coals are now sold at 
Montrose by the standard barrel of one and a-half hundred weight, 
which on trial has been found to contain from seven to fourteen 
pounds, according to the quality of the coal more than the former 
heaped measure of two imperial bushels. Wood arismg from the 
thinning and pruning of the forest-trees in the neighbourhood can 
also be purchased at a reasonable rate.

THE REV. JOHN EADIE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, Sj-c. — The name Dwi seems to be taken 
from that of the proprietor, who was called Dun of that Hk. It is 
said that a person named Erskine married the heiress. But at what 
time that happened, it is difficult to say ; as it is known only by fa- 
mily tradition. Others derive the name from the Gaelic Dunis, 
which signifies a hill or rising ground ; and it is, indeed, on a ground 
pretty much elevated above the river South Esk, or South Water; 
for Esk is said in Gaelic to signify water. Its greatest extent is 
about four miles in length, and as much in breadth ; but as it runs 
out into narrow points to the north-west and south-east, it does 
not contain more than twelve square miles. There is a small part 
separated from the rest of the parish by the basin or estuary at 
Montrose, called the Fort-hill, the land at the end of the bridge, 
and several houses which belong to Montrose quoad sacra. It is 
bounded on the west by the parish of Brechin ; on the east by that 
of Montrose ; on the north by the parishes of Strickathrow and 
Logie Pert; and on the south by the parishes of Marytown and 
Kmnaird, which last is now united to Farnell. 

Topographical Appearance.~lis figure is very irregular. The 
low lands by the river side, and towards the basin, where the water 
IS kept off by dikes, are clayey and very productive; along the side 
of the basin by Broomley, Gilrivie, and Tayocks, the land rises 
more abruptly, and the soil is hght and sandy. Leaving the fields 
along the river and basin, and going north, the land rises gradually 
into rich fields of black earth, on the farm of Balwyllo and Mains 
ot Dun,— the grass parks about Dun and Langley Park, and the 
iarm. of Well-hill, having a southern exposure. In the middle are 
the farmsof Balnillo, Leys of Dun Fordis, Tetherewe, Glenskenno, 
and Higham, which are good land. To the north of these the 



124 FORFARSHIRE. 

land becomes flattened, wet, and miry, and, except the farm of 
North Mains and several small places, the greater part oi it is 
under wood. On the north of Balnillo Wood is Dun s Dish, a 
lake covering about forty acres of land, collected from the adjoin- 
ing fields and springs for the use of mills. 

IL— Civil Histoby. 

There is no history of the parish printed or in manuscript; nor 
are there any historical occurrences worthy of notice. 

Land-owners.-T\xe chief land-owners are the most noble Mar- 
quis of Ailsa; James Cruickshank, Esq. of Langley Park ; David 
Carnegy, Esq. of Craigo; and Patrick Cruickshank, Esq. of Glens- 

Tarochial Iiegisters.-T\.e date of the earliest entry on the pa- 
rochial register of births and baptisms is the 10th July 1642; of 
marriages, the Uth September 1646. There are three vo- 
lumes of these registers, but they do not appear to have been very 
regularly kept, and the first is scarcely legible. Thei is also a 
register of burials in the parish, begun m the year 1777, and 
continued to the year 1793; but from that time it has been very 
irregularly kept. The records of the kirk-session begin on the 
19th July 1702, and consist of four volumes. 

HI. — Population.

1811, - - 680 

1821. - - 605 



And in 1831, - " 

The recent decrease is said to be owing to a number of cottar- 
houses, and several other houses that had a few acres of land attach- 
ed to them, having been taken down. There is no town or village m 
the parish.

present ; but there are in the parish four proprietors of land up- 
wards of L. 50 in yearly value. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — There are about 2600 stand- 
ard imperial acres under cultivation in the parish; besides 230 
acres around the houses of Dun and Langley Park, which have 
been a number of years in grass, and rent from 30s. to 80s. per 
acre. There are about 550 acres under wood, and about 100 
acres of uncultivated moor. There is also a large track of ground 
covered by the tides that might be embanked ; but it is doubtful 
whether it would yield a fair return. 

Husbandry. — Several different rotations are practised, accord- 
ing to the quality of the soil. Upon the wet strong low-lying 
land, a six-shift rotation, namely, \st, fallow ; 2 J, wheat ; Qd, pease 
or beans; Ath, barley sown down with grass seeds; bth, grass 
generally cut for hay ; 6th, oats. Upon a drier class of strong 
land, likewise a six-shift, 1st, potatoes, or drilled pease or beans ; 
2c, wheat; Sd, turnips; Ath, barley; bth, grass, either cut or pas- 
tured ; Qth, oats. A small part is cropped in a four-shift, 1st, fal- 
low or drilled crop; '2d, a corn crop, sown down with grass seeds; 
Qd, grass ; Ath, oats. A considerable extent of the upper part of 
the parish is the five-shift, \st, fallow or drilled green crop ; 2d, 
a corn crop, sown down with grass seeds ; M and Ath, grass, ge- 
nerally pastured both years ; bth, oats. The farm-houses and 
steadings are generally in a good state of repair, being chiefly 
erected by the proprietors. The general duration of leases is for 
nmeteen years; and the proprietors are liberal and kind to their 
tenantiy. 

Breeds of Live Stock.~The cattle reared are chiefly of the 
black dodded Angus breed, somewhat resembling the Galloway 
cattle. They are considered to be of a good kind, growing to a 
great weight, and in general good feeders. 

Rate of Wages.— UBons' and carpenters' wages durino- the 
summer, are from 2s. to 2s. 6d. per day ; and stout labourers'from 
Is. 6d. to Is. lOd.,— all without victuals. Farm-servants are 
engaged generally for twelve months, at from L. 10 to L 12 
with 6 i bolls meal yearly, and a Scotch pint of sweet milk pei- 
Clay tor unmarried men, who are accommodated in hothies. The 
marned men with families get nearly the same, with an addition 
ot a house and garden on the farm, and some potatoes. Women- 



126 



FORFAllSHIRE. 



servants, for house-work, get from L. 5 to L. 6 per annum. Wo- 
men employed at out-door work get 8d. per day, without victuals. 
The crop is generally cut by the threave ; wheat at 4d. per threave ; 
and other kinds of grain at 3d. , . i. 

Fisheries.— These are the fishing upon the river, as stated m the 
former Statistical Account, and the fishing on the sands of the ba- 
sin for mussels for bait. The yearly rent of the former is nearly 
L. 100, and of the latter is upwards of L. 100. 

Produce.—The average gross amount and value of raw produce 
yearly raised in the parish, as far as can be ascertained, is as fol- 
lows : — 



700 quarters wheat at 53s. . - - 

350 quarters pease and beans at 30s. 
2450 quarters oats at 21s. 

1500 quarters barley at 30s. - - " 

180 acres hay at 200 stones per acre, at Gd. per stone, 
140 acres potatoes at L. 8, - - "

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Ecclesiastical State.— The church is situated within the Mar- 
quis of Ailsa's enclosures, is very convenient for the greater part 
of the population, and about two or three miles from the extremi- 
ties of the parish. It is said to have been a chapel belongmg 
to the family of Dun, the mansion-house of the family having 
been built very near to the churchyard. The roof and ceil- 
ing is so much decayed, that it is proposed at present to have 
the church renewed. It affords accommodation to nearly 400 
persons. There are no free sittings; but there are several pews, 
belonging to the session, let yearly for a very small sum. 

It is not known when the oldest part of the manse was built; 
but an addition of two rooms was made to it about fourteen years 
ago. Some repairs in the manse and offices, and also some addi- 
tions to the offices, were made in 1828. 

The extent of the glebe is betwixt five and six acres of very good 
land, which may be valued at L. 20 a-year. The amount of stipend 
is L. 150 yearly, including L. 33, 8s. 5d. from Government. There 
are about 100 families, and 260 persons, attending the Established

church. There are 8 persons attending the nearest chapels of 
Dissenters and Seceders ; 6 attending the Episcopalian chapel 
in Montrose. Divine service at the Established church is generally 
well attended. The average niunber of communicants at the Esta- 
blished church is 225. 

Education. — The total number of schools in the parish is three, 
— one parochial and two unendoved. The salary of the parochial 
schoolmaster is the maximum, and the school-fees amount to about 
L. 12 yearly. The parochial schoolmaster has the legal accom- 
modation. The general expense of education is 3s. per quarter 
for reading ; 4s. for reading and writing ; and 5s. for reading, writ- 
ing, and arithmetic. There are no persons above six years of 
age who cannot either read or write. The people in general 
are very much alive to the benefits of education, and are very 
anxious to have their children well instructed in all the useful 
branches. 

Library. — There is a small parochial library, mostly of religious 
books, of which the people are very fond. 

Savings Bank. — There is a savings bank in the parish, which 
was instituted on the 8th June 1818. The average amount depo- 
sited yearly, from 1818 to 1830, is L. 50, 14s. 4|d., and withdrawn, 
L.38, Is. 5|d. The investments are generally made by the la- 
bouring class of people. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is eleven, and the average sum allotted to 
each, yearly, is nearly L. 3. There are also various sums given 
to persons who are occasionally in difficulty, before they are placed 
regularly upon the poors' roll. The heritors, according to their 
valued rent, pay for the keeping of a lunatic, belongingto the parish, 
in the Montrose asylum, at the rate of L. 12 ; and for another per- 
son at the rate of L. 10 yearly. The average amount from collec- 
tions at the church is L. 26; interest of money, L. 11 ; seat-rents, 
mortcloth, &amp;c/ L. 2. There is little disposition among the poor to 
refrain from seeking parochial rehef, and they do not consider it de- 
grading. 

Fairs.— Tvio fairs used to be held in the parish on Dun's Muir, 
—the first in May, on the Tuesday before the first Wednesday 
old style; the second in June, third Wednesday. But last season 
they were removed to a piece of waste ground about a mile to the 
north, on the side of the Strickathrow road on the estate of Dun 
and m the parish of Logie Pert. '

W &amp;-c.-Theve is on the turnpike road a toll-house and an 
alehouse, where spirituous hquors are sold; they are frequented 
chiefly by the people travelling the turnpike road, but very seldom 
bv the people of this parish. . ,t . e 

,,Z.-Enghsh coal, procured at the shore m Montrose, from 
Is. to Is. 3d. per barrel, is the fuel generally used.

PRESBYTERY OF BRECHIN, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. JAMES BURNS, A. M. 1 

THE REV. GEORGE WHITSON, } MINISTERS. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Boundaries, c— The name Brechin is derived from a 
Gaelic term, signifying a brae; and is descriptive of the sloping 
bank beside the river South Esk, on which the town is situated. The 
parish extends m length from east to west about seven English 
miles, and m breadth from north to south about six. It consists 
of 24f square miles. It is bounded by the parish of Dun on the 
east; by Carriston on the west; by Strickathrow and Menmuir on 
the north; and by Farnell on the south; while on the south-west 
It marches with Aberlemno. It is not of a very regular shape, al- 
though no part of it extends much above three miles in each di- 
rection from the burgh. The Grampian mountains are seen at 
no great distance to the north; but there is no eminence which 
can be called a mountain within the parish, excepting Burghill, or 
Burke as it is usually pronounced, which lies on the so'uth ide 
of he town The greater part of the parish is level, or diversi- 
fied by gently slopmg grounds. 

The dimate is justly reckoned temperate and salubrious. From 

comp a nt of ague, which were common in former times. No pre- 
valent distemper can be said to exist in the district.

sand, reposing on a gray sandstone. In the northern part of 
the parish there are several quarries in operation, which exhibit a 
fine section of the gray sandstone. This rock is well adapted for 
building, being susceptible of a high polish, and being of great du- 
rability, as the tower and spire attached to the cathedral which have 
stood for 800 years without decomposition or decay, abundantly 
prove. The position of the sandstone is nearly horizontal. No 
metals have been discovered in any part of the parish, so far as is 
known. 

Botani/.— There are no native plants peculiar to this parish. 

The Linnea borealis, which is very rare, is found in the woods of 

Kinnaird, lying partly in this and the neighbouring parish of Far- 

nell. The insects which are most injurious to fruit trees are the 

white American bugs imported from the London nurseries about 

thirty years ago, and now very prevalent in gardens around the town. 

They attack only apples. The various means for destroying them 

are wahmg with the refuse of gas-works, with black soap, whale 

oil, and with scaldmg-water, especially if potatoes have been boiled 
witli it. 

II. — Civil History. 
A map of the town and suburbs was published by Mr John 
Wood a few years ago, which seems sufficiently accurate and de- 
scnptive. 

Brechin Castle was, before the invention of artillery, a place of 
considerable strength, being romantically situated on the top of a 
preapice. A ravine of considerable depth separates it on the east 
and north from the town; while the South Esk, here formed into a 
fane sheet of water, washes its southern base. Access to the for- 
was attained only through the gate in a wall, which was built to 
detend it on the western quarter. The brave Sir Thomas Maule

after which they are complete to the present date. In the register 
of baptisms, the earliest entry is in 1612; from which time the re- 
gister is continued without any interruption to 1725, when it be- 
comes imperfect, and consists of occasional entries made on de- 
tached leaves, or folded sheets, till the year 1753; from which time 
it is continued to the present. The register of marriages, or rather 
of proclamatious, commences in 1700, and continues for a few 
years ; but downwards to 1784 it is very defective. There are some 
proclamations recorded betwixt 1749 and 1781; but for many years 
prior to 1749 there is no record existing. 

Antiquities. — There are in the upper part of the town ruins of 
the ancient chapel of Maison Dieu, an alm's-house connected with 
the cathedral, now covered with a roof, and used for the humble 
purpose of a stable. The round-tower adjoining the cathedral, 
complete and well built, probably of Pictish origin, has been often 
and long admired, while the purposes for which it has been erect- 
ed have been matter of various conjecture. Two bells, formerly 
placed within it, have been of late years transferred to the square 
tower beside it, which contains another large bell and a good clock. 
The west end of the cathedral, repaired upwards of twenty years 
ago, and forming a handsome parish church, was originally built 
by King David I. in the eleventh century. It has two rows of pil- 
lars, with Gothic arches, and a large and elegant window on the 
west. The eastern part or choir, in which some special rites 
of the church of Rome were performed, was thrown down at. the 
time of the Reformation. There is a burial place at the eastern 
extremity of the parish, which receives the name of Magdalene's 
Chapel, although no traces of a place of worship now remain. 

Modern Buildings.— Towards the north end of the town, near 
the old chapel in Maison Dieu Wynd, there is a chapel for the 
use of the Scottish Episcopalians, built about twenty years ago, and 
enlarged and beautified last year, particularly on the west end, 
which is neatly finished with two minarets on each side of the cross 
m the centre. There are four Presbyterian meeting-houses, which 
are plain, commodious edifices ;— one of them was till lately used as 
an English Episcopal chapel. The town-house, in the middle of 
the town, near the cross or market-place, was almost wholly rebuilt 
about thirty years ago, and is now a respectable edifice. It con- 
tains an excellent guild-hall on the seco.id floor, with two smaller 
rooms for the meeting of council, and a court-room and prison be- 
- llie public school-rooms, three in number, built by sub-

of the town, being surrounded by a neat belfry and dial-p ate. i here 
are threshing and spinning-mills, named East and Meikle Mdl, ad- 
joining the town; and one at Arrat's Mill, towards the eastern ex- 
tremity of the parish.

The only nobleman who resides in this parish is Lord Panmure 
at Brechin Castle. Few of the other chief hei-itors have residences 
in the parish. All of them are proprietors of land of L oO a-year 
and upwards, excepting the feuars at Little Brechm, who possess 
and occupy a few acres each taken from what was lately the com- 

aTmL and Habits of the People.-ot much can be said in 
favour of the habits of the ordinary class of inhabitants, as to clean- 
liness in their persons and habitations. There are, however, many 
honou able exceptions. The usual food of the peasantry is milk 
anTmeal, and potatoes. The poorer people m use as 

, y much of the same articles as they can procure. Now and then 

little butcher-meat is added.

theolooy. Their moral and religious character is fully equal to 
that of their neighbours in the adjacent towns and villages ; and 
though there are instances of intemperance and dishonesty, it 
will bear a comparison with that of most towns in Scotland. In 
former times it was remarked, that the Sabbath was better observ- 
ed here than in some other places of equal or greater extent. But 
the increase of inhabitants has been attended with no improvement 
in the manner of keeping that sacred day. Poaching in the river 
is sometimes practised. Smuggling is almost unheard of since the 
legal distilleries were established.

The kinds of trees generally planted on moors are Scotch firs, 
with sometimes a mixture of larch and spruce, sometimes larch 
alone. In belts of planting, and in gentlemen's policies, and where 
there is depth of soil, there is no more soft wood planted than is 
necessary for shelter to the hard-wood of different kinds. The soft 
wood is cut out after a few years. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of land maybe about L. 1, 7s. 
per imperial acre. Land in grass is generally let for the season at 
from 20s. to 35s. per imperial acre. The real rent of the parish is 
about L. 13,000. 

Rate of Wages. — Labourers for draining and other farm work, 
receive about 9s. per week for the year ; women for out-of-door 
work, 4s. The rate of wages for masons runs from 12s. to l4s. 
per week, according to the season of the year; that of carpenters 
is 2s. per day. 

Breeds of Live Stock.— The breed of sheep is in general the 
black-faced; but few of this description of animals are kept. The 
breed of cattle is mostly that of the county of Angus ; but of late  
years there is a mixture of the short-horned or Tees-water breed, 
and a few Ayrshire cows. 

Hushand.rg.~T\\Q management of cattle is well understood and

attended to ; so also is draining of land. No irrigation, and but 
bttle embankment, is required. The length of leases is generally 
nineteen years,— leases of this duration being considered as more 
favourable than those for a shorter period. The state of farm-build- 
ings and enclosures is good, the buildings being usually of stone and 
lime, and slated. Improvements have been general throughout the 
parish during the last twenty or thirty years. Defective leases and 
insufficient accommodation are unknown. From the fifth to the 
sixth part of the farms is sown with turnips, or planted with pota- 
toes, unless when they are adapted for wheat, in which case a pro- 
portion is fallowed. Very few beet or cabbages are cultivated. No 
meadow hay is raised in the parish. Of flax there are only a few 
acres for domestic purposes. Land in pasture is let at a eertam 
rate per head of cattle, or by the acre,— from 20s. to 25s. per im- 
perial acre, and sometimes as high as 45s. and even 60s., according 
to the soil and situation. 

Agricultural Sociehj.— The Eastern Forfarshire Farming Asso- 
ciation was instituted here in 1814, under the patronage of the 
Honourable William Maule, now Lord Panmure, who is its per- 
petual president. The Association holds two shows annually on the 
Trinity Muir, in the immediate neighbourhood of the town, the 
one in spring, the other in autumn, at which premiums are award- 
ed for cattle of different ages and breeds ; for fat cattle of the best 
symmetry and weight; for brood mares and breeding cows ; for 
stallions and young horses of various ages, and occasionally for im- 
proved agricultural implements. The average number of members 
who pay one guinea or upwards yearly to the funds is about 160. 
The institution has all along continued to prosper under the aus- 
pices of its munificent patron and president, and has been very be- 
neficial to the interests of agriculture in the eastern part of For- 
farshire. 

Manufactures.— The branches of manufacture are hecklmg, 
spinning, weaving, and bleaching. There may be employed in 
heckhng about 30 men and women; in spinning 200; in weavui " 
from 1000 to 1500 ; in bleaching from 40 to 50. The hours of la 
hour are twelve each day for those employed in the spinning an 
bleaching works. The wages paid them may be considered as a 
pretty fair remuneration. Those employed in the above branches 
are in general healthy. Some of the young people attendmg the 
mill receive week-day and Sabbath evening instruction at school: 
but education is on the whole not much attended to; and instances

of immorality now and then occur. Besides the above branches of 
manufacture, two distilleries for spirits from malt have been for 
some time erected in the immediate neighbourhood of the town, 
and are in full operation. 

Qiiarries. — There are three lime-works at present in full opera- 
tion, and several freestone quarries of excellent quality. 

Nurseries. — There are three nurseries in the neighbourhood of 
the town, consisting of about twenty-five imperial acres, and sup- 
plying a large district with forest trees of all kinds, as also fruit 
trees, ornamental shrubs, and bushes, &amp;c. All of these are in full 
employment, and kept in the best order. 

The principal green crop is turnips, but a considerable extent 
of land is planted with potatoes for domestic purposes, and feeding 
cattle ; very few potatoes are raised for exportation. Wheat is 
generally sown after the potatoe crop. 

Produce. — The average gross amount and value of raw produce 
yearly raised in the parish may be as follows.

Market-Town.-Bvechin is the only market-town in this district, 
and serves for several miles of the country adjacent. The trade 
here is mostly that of weavers, besides the usual handicrafts. There 
IS no great estabhshment of police,-there being only three town- 
officers and three men for sweeping the streets; besides a body of 
constables, consistmg of the younger part of the inhabitants. 

Means of Comrmmication.—Theve is a regular daily post. The 
postman arrives on foot from Montrose about eight in the morn-

Edinburgh and Aberdeen, passing through the town. There is 
also a noddy to and from Montrose, and a caravan to and from 
Arbroath on Tuesday, which is market-day. There is an ancien 
bridge at the lower part of the town, or tenements on the old roads 
to Arbroath and Forfar, necessary for the adjoining country to the 
outh;-and a new one lately erected at Sta-achy ford, whi 
intended to serve for a line of road just now begun, both for Dun.

there is no priest nearer than Dundee. 

The number of families attending the Established church is 
about 900 ; of families attending the chapels of Dissenters about 
400; of families attending the chapel of Episcopalians about 60. 

The average number of communicants at the parish church is 
about 1400 each time the communion is dispensed. 

There is a Bible and missionary society in the town. The ave- 
rage amount of their subscriptions and donations is about L. 50 
a-year, nearly the half of that sum being contributed by each, be- 
sides occasional collections. These last vary from L. 10 to L.20 
annually. 

Education. — There are nine schools in the parish, besides three 
or four for females only. Two of the former in the town, and one 
of the latter have each a salary. Two in the country are supported 
partly by the kirk-session ; one of them from a small sum mortified 
by Mr J ohnston, minister here, about sixty years ago. There is one 
parochial school ; in which the branches of education taught are, 
reading English, writing, arithmetic, English grammar, geography, 
Greek, Latin, French, book-keeping, and practical mathematics. 
The same are taught, more or less, in the other schools. The pa- 
rochial schoolmaster's salary is L. 34, 4s. 4d. The amount of school 
fees for some years has been about L. 70. No house or garden is 
given by the heritors. In lieu of the parochial school accommo- 
dation an allowance of L. 10 a-year is granted by the magistrates 
from the funds of the burgh, agreeably to a stipulation entered in- 
to betwixt them and the heritors in the year 1808, when a regu- 
lar parish school was first estabhshed. The yearly expense of 
education, m reading only, is 10s.; in reading and writing, 16s. • 
when arithmetic is added, it is 18s.; and with Latin, it is L. 1, 4s. 

A vacancy having lately occurred in one of the pubHc schools, 
steps are m the course of being taken, before filling up the vacancy, 
to remodel the system of education that has hitherto prevailed in 
this place, and to put the schools on a more efficient footing, by 
adoptmg the modern plan of dividing the branches among three

Seldom does so mud. ignorance appear as sometimes did twenty 
or thirty years ago. Yet morals cannot be said to have improved 
in proportion to the means of instruction. 

LL»r,.-There is a parish library, consisting » 'Aonl WO 
books of a useful and religious kind : and each of our Iwo bookse - 
lers has a circulating library. There .s -"f J P""- 
room • and a printing press has lately been established. 

CkaM istiJiL-Tbere is here an mstitufon called the 
Hospital of Maison Dieu, which gives small weekly -- 
poor residenters, widows, and children of burghers. There ,s also 
a public dispensary, established several years ago, eluefly by means

subscription from some of the heritors and other inhabitants, 
s very useful The patients average 73 m n™ber for the la 
eiJht years. There are several friendly societies, both tor male 
Z females in distress; but most of them are expmng .m w. 
of encouragement, or from wrong calculations. They surely tend 
to create a spirit of independence and oi Irugality.

The prison is tolerably well secured. An attempt was made about 
two years ago to escape by the ceiling, but. was discovered in time 
to prevent it. To promote a current of air, an iron door with 
grating has been lately erected. Two apartments have each a 
window ; the black hole has a small opening only to let in air, and 
a feeble light. The superintendence is in the hands of the ma- 
gistrates. 

Fairs, Sc. — There are several fairs or markets in the parish. The 
celebrated Trinity Muir market is held at a mile's distance from 
the town, four times in the year. The one held in the month of 
June is by far the best attended. At the terms of Whitsunday and 
Martinmas there are very considerable markets held on the streets 
for the hiring of servants, as well as for the sale of merchants' 
goods. Markets for horses and cattle are held for several weeks in 
winter and spring every Tuesday, which is the weekly market day ; 
but butcher-meat of the best quality, and especially mutton, can 
be had at any time in abundance. 

Inns.-~Th.eTe are by far too many inns and other public houses, — 
upwards of sixty in the town and tenements, — besides three or four 
in the country part of the parish. Their effects on morals are 
in many cases very bad. 

Fuel. — The chief fuel is coal brought by land-carriage from 
Montrose. An ordinary cart-load costs 5s. in addition to the 
price of the coals at the shore. Some wood is got in the neigh- 
bourhood, on which the poor depend much for fuel. It is not al- 
ways honestly come by. There are no peats nearer than Arnhall 
in the Mearns ; of course they are but little made use of. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
There are striking changes, both in the personal appearance of 
the people and in places, within the last thirty years. Much bet- 
ter houses are built, both in the town and country. Far more 
hedges are planted; and other kinds of fences are more complete, 
rhe alteration in the dress of both sexes is very remarkable, 
lionnets and plaids, then common, are now almost exploded. The 
desire of knowledge is increasing, and a love of reading is pretty ge- 
neral. On the whole, the people have many advantages of which 
It IS to be hoped not a few of them are sensible.

PRESBYTERY OF FOREAR, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. JAMES HEADRICK, MINISTER. 



I _ToPOGRAPHY AND NaTURAL HiSTORY. 

Name and Boundaries.-Sou difference of opinion exists con- 
cerning the origin of the name Dunnichen. Most people derive it 
from Nechtan, a Pictish chieftain, who is said to have resided in the 
parish. But although it has been the uniform practice ot the aei 
to name persons from their place of residence they ner named 
places from persons. I am, therefore, disposed to think that Dun- 
nichen is a corruption of Dun-Achan, the hill or fort of the val- 
ley. This is exactly descriptive of the hill of Dunnichen, which, 
on the north, looks down on the lochs of Rescobie and Balgaies; 
towards the east, upon the whole valley of the Lunan ; towards the 
west, upon Forfar and its contiguous loch, and through Strathmore, 
until the view is bounded by Shehallien and the Perthshire Gram- 
pians. From the west of this hill the water flows down through 
Strathmore, and from the east it flows towards the Lunan and 
Lunan Bay. From the south side of the hill a low shoulder is 
projected, on which there once stood a fort built with dry stone, 
without any cement. It is agreed at all hands that the parish de- 
rived its name from this fort or castle. The foundation of a si- 
milar fort is still visible on the hill of Dunbarrow, a detached 

The ptircTnsists of three estates or properties, detached from 
each other ; and in whole contains 4024 Scotch acres 

Topographical Appear ances.-Theve are no elevations in ths 
parish which can claim the name of mountains. The hill o 
Dunnichen is the most elevated part; its highest pmnacle .a 
ascertained to be 800 feet above the level of the sea. Tin 
hill, with a few exceptions, is covered with sod, and is p anted o 
cuUivated to its summit. The hill of Dunbarrow may be about 
700 feet above the sea. Dunnichen House, situated near the

foot of the southern slope of Dunnichen Hill, is the most northern 
house of the parish, and was ascertained to be 400 feet above the 
sea, and distant from the sea, at Arbroath, about ten miles. The 
medium elevation of the whole parish may be about 360 feet above 
the sea level. The lands of Dunnichen consist of gentle undula- 
tions or ridges running from west to east, their greatest and most 
rapid descent being towards Vinney Water on the south. The 
lands of Tulloes have a very gentle rise from Vinney Water to 
the summit of the ridge which separates them from Carmyllie on 
the south ; and this ridge may be about 600 feet above the sea. 
The lands of Dunbarrow rise in all directions towards the hill, 
their steepest acclivity being towards the north-west. 

Meteorology. — In general, the climate is very similar to that 
which prevails over a great part of the east of Scotland. The 
trees, where fully exposed, lean somewhat towards the north-east, 
showing the prevailing winds to be from the south-west. ''During 
spring, and sometimes even in summer, chilling blasts from the 
east and north-east prevail, with their usual injurious effects : and 
they are often accompanied by hazy mist, here named eastern 
haar. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — Excepting where they have been 
laid open by quarries, and a few juttings of whinstone rocks, the 
strata are uniformly covered by a considerable depth of soil. 
Sandstone, or freestone, constitutes the great body of our solid 
strata. These are sometimes seen to alternate with beds of indu- 
rated clay, which consist of thin plates of a whitish gray, reddish, 
or bluish colour, here known by the name of cam-stone, because 
they are used for writing on slates, and, when pounded, are used 
for whitening hearths, stairs, &amp;c. These clay strata are some- 
times penetrated by the roots of plants, of a blackish colour ; and 
sometimes impressions of plants, and of their leaves, are seen 
upon the surfaces of their plates. Numerous fragments of what 
appears to have been rushes, of a bluish-green colour, appear in 
some of these indurated clay strata. Some of the freestone beds 
are subdivisible into plates of various thickness, the surfaces of 
which exhibit woody fibres, and have a striking resemblance to 
pohshed boards of wainscot. Although our sandstone beds be in- 
tersected by numerous fissures, which subdivide them into masses 
which more or less affect a parallelepiped form, having two opposite 
angles acute, and the other two obtuse ; they are nowhere seen 
to be intersected by veins of trap or whinstone, or of any other

material. I once picked up a fexv fragments of heavy spar, some 
of which were tinged with a green colour from copper, on the 
southern declivity of the highest pinnacle of Dunnichen Hill, 
which must have come from a vein of that material which is con- 
cealed by the soil. But the greatest metallic repositories in 
the world have been discovered by accident or exposed to view 
by streams of water. For this purpose, in Cornwall and other 
places, they conduct streams of water artificially across the dech- 

vitv of the mountains. . 

The sandstone in the castle quarry of Dunnichen dips to the 
north about five feet in twenty-four, making an angle with the ho- 
rizon of 12°. This quarry furnishes excellent mill-stones tor 
ffrindinff corn. It also furnishes stones of large dimensions, which 
L be easily dressed and pohshed immediately after they are 
raised, but if allowed to remain some time, no tool can penetrate 
them. ' In some of its beds there are rounded pebbles of jasper, 
quartz and agate, interspersed. The sandstone of Tulloes dips 
to the south-east four feet eight inches m twenty-four, mak- 
ing an angle with the horizon of 11°. Our sandstone, or free- 
stone, is gLerally of a grayish-white colour. Some of it mchnes 

Where the trap or whinstone rocks jut above the surface, they 
appear to be a confused mass, without any stratification or regular 
arrangement of parts. But where they have been dug nto, they are 
Tnd to be as rW t-tified as the sandstone on .. 
rest, and by which they are covered towards the dip. On the 
south rn face of the hill of Dunnichen, there are a few jutting rocks 
of trap, some of which is fatiscent, as it decomposes in concentric 
s ales Other parts have numerous particles of steatites, o a dir y 
::ish-white'colour, interspersed, and, from the -enabhmce to 
Lt animal, have obtained the name oad-s 7. On h 
of Pinkerton, there is a confused very porous stratum of tiap co er 
ng a freesto;e quarry. On the farm of Broadlea, ;s -od - 
juLg rock of that species of trap which is called PJ 
rock has of late been much quarried for stones to -- t -/ 
is found to be composed of sevei;al vei-y regular  -ta,; 
which is made up of blocks of various dimensions, of which som 
affect the rude columnar form. These strata dip to the no 
east at the rate of nine feet in twenty-four, -1 - a gl 

with the horizon of 21°. All the visible rocks of the hill of Dum

barrow are trap ; and these include nil the visible trap rocks in 
this parish. 

A thin siHcious incrustation sometunes intersects our trap 
rocks. In other cases there are hollows lined with a silicious in- 
crustation, from which beautiful rock crystals project towards the 
centre of the hollow. 

On the summit and sides of the hill of Dunnichen there are seve- 
ral large loose masses of mica-slate and granite. Large granite 
stones, which interrupted the plough, were dug up some years ago, 
on the farm of Broadlea. A large mass of granite was lately 
blasted to the north of Letham ; and many stones of these kinds 
occur, or have been discovered, in various parts of the parish, all 
more or less rounded by attrition. There being no rock of these 
stones nearer than the Grampians, we are puzzled to account for 
their getting into their present position. In the beautiful mass of 
granite that was blasted near Letham, I observed fragments of dark- 
blue whinstone interspersed in the body of the stone. 

The quality of our soils may be inferred from that of the rocks 
which they cover, and from whose decomposition they have been 
formed. A large sheet of good soil slopes from the south side of 
Dunnichen Hill. In the upper part, this soil is too shallow, and 
too near the rock. It deepens as it descends, and may be de- 
scribed as a friable loam, in which sand predominates. It seems 
to have been made up of particles washed down from the hill 
above. In the different ridges of the parish, where the soil is 
primary the subsoil is always tenacious, or impervious to mois- 
ture. Of course it is apt to throw up rushes, Sphagnum pains- 
tre, and other moss-plants. This sort of soil prevails on the 
smnmit of those ridges of which the estate of Dunnichen is com- 
posed. The only exception is that of soils formed from the decom- 
position of trap-rocks, which are always fertile, provided they be of 
sufficient depth. On the estate of TuUoes, the lower pari is an 
dluvial haugh soil, and becomes less fertile as you advance o the 
higher grounds The same observation applies to h 1 1 ' f 
Dumbarrow, which is least fertile -at the higher parts, where the 
sod IS primary, but becomes deeper and more'fertile as JeZj 
In a word the soils of this parish may be ranked under two class" 
--friable loams, in which sand predominates; and friable cTy ' 
wth a retentive subsoil. Most of the stones 4ich were niin'iW

were constructed every way similar to the former. They contain- 
ed human bones, which seem to have been crammed together 
.without much regard to arrangement. The urns with theirshes 
were every way similar to the former. The neck-bones of some 
Mitli stiins of beads. These were of a beautiful 
glossy black colour, neatly perforated longitudinally, and strung 
together by the fibres of animals. They were of an oval figure; 
large and small ones were arranged alternately ; the large ones 
flat on the two opposite surfaces, the small ones round." They 
seemed to consist of ebony, or of some fine-grained species of wood 
which had been charred, and then finely polished. On keeping 
them some tune, they split into plates, and the woody fibres sepa- 
rated. The bones also, and the urns, mouldered into dust. In 
some of these graves rusty daggers were found, which fell in pieces 
by handhng. It appears the bodies had been first burnt, as the 
ashes contamed numerous particles of charcoal of wood 

Land-oioners,~The parish, as formerly stated, is divided into 
three properties, namely, Dunnichen, TuUoes, and Dumbarrow. 
James Hawkm Esq. advocate, is heir-apparent to the estate of 
Dunnichen. He resides at Dunnichen House, and is the only re- 
siding heritor Tulloes belongs to John Oughterlony, Esq. of 
Wnd. Dumbarrow belongs to Alexander Lyall, Esq. of Gardyne 
..... P..... The only person of eminence le ever tlZ 
of connected with the parish, is the late George Dempster, Esq 
who was many years member of Parliament for the Forfar  ndee' 
&amp;c district of burghs ; but his character and conduc re we U 
known to require any illustration.

ternate, which consists of interposing a green crop, or naked fallow, 
between every two corn crops. At first breaking up from lea, oats 
are sown ; then turnips and potatoes drilled ; next barley, with rye- 
grass and clover ; next pasture, for one or more years. Sometimes, 
when the land is in very good heart, two or more crops of oats are 
taken at first breaking up. Sometimes wheat is sown after pota- 
toes, and sometimes on clover-lea, with addition of manure : if 
after potatoes, or naked fallow, the grass seeds are always sown 
along with it. But for some years past the seasons have been so 
unfavourable at the critical time of flowering and fructifying, and 
the wheat has been so much destroyed by the fly, that the culti- 
vation of this grain has been almost abandoned, and barley substi- 
tuted in its place. Formerly wheat was always sown after naked 
fallow ; and a part sometimes after potatoes or clover lea. Now, 
with wheat, the extent of naked fallow is very much reduced, and 
barley is sown upon the potatoe and turnip land, which receives all 
the manure. Of late the turnip husbandry has been extended by 
bone dust, which raises a good crop on light sandy ground, but 
does not seem to succeed so well on stiff clays. The store-masters 
of the Grampians send down their flocks of sheep to feed on 
these turnips during winter, and they are confined to three drills 
at a time by means of flakes. They prefer these wooden flakes to 
•nets, because the sheep being of the horned black-faced breed, 
their horns might get entangled in the nets, and tear them in 
pieces. The kinds of turnips cultivated here are the globe, the 
green and red-tops, or rather a mixture of all. A portion of the 
yellow turnip is in every field; but, unless the seeds themselves 
were to be raised, they seldom can be got unmixed. Every farmer 
has also a few drills of curly kail in liis turnip field. The grains 
cultivated are the potatoe -oat, of which they frequently change 
the seed ; the two-rowed barley; the white Essex wheat, of which 
they receive, frequent change of seed from London or the Carse of 
Gowrie; gray peas in some places,— drilled beans having been tried, 
but not found to succeed. Some farmers also sow portions of 
vetches, as green fodder for their live stock. Various kinds of 
potatoes have prevailed here at diff-erent times ; but the kinds most 
m vogue at present are the large globular red, and the small Ame- 
rican of a white colour.

monly applied in compost with earth and dung to turnips or to

The ploughmen here are very expert, and some of them havebeen 
carried to Ireland, and other distant places. Some of them are mar- 
ried, and hve in cottages annexed to the farm-house. But most ot 
them are unmarried, and live in what are called contiguous 
to the farm-house. Each receives a certain allowance of meal and 
milk, potatoes and other articles, besides wages, which vary from 
L 10 to L 15 or L. 20, according to circumstances. The reap- 
in'o- is mostly performed by threaving, but partly by the scythe. 
Much of the estate of Dunnichen is but one step removed from 
the runrig, or rig and rennel system, which still prevads in some 
parts of The Highlands. However, as leases fall, it is now in the 
course of being lotting into separate farms, and commodious larm- 

offices are building. . 

The two-horse plough, of Small's construction, is universally in use. 
The cattle, and spmetimes also the horses, are fed on turmps during 
winter, along, with straw or other fodder. Sometimes, also they 
get a feed of yams or other potatoes; but the surplus of potatoes 

generally goes to feed pigs. 

There are two corn-mills upon the estate of Dunnichen, at Craichy 
and Letham; the latter also fabricates pot-barley. There is 
. also a corn-mill at Dumbarrow. There are four thrashmg-ma- 
chines at Dumbarrow, two of which are moved by water, one by 
horses, and one by wind. There are two on the estate of TuUoes, 
one moved by horses, the other by water. On the estate of Dun- 
nichen there are seven thrashing-machines, one moved by water, 
the rest by horses,— in all thirteen m the parish. 

Breeds of Live SocA.-There are no sheep kept in the parish. 
The kind of cattle which most generally prevails is the Galloway 
breed, sometimes here called Wze., because they have no hor

Produce. — The average gross amount and value of raw produce 
raised yearly, on an average of the last five years, is as follows : — 

1240 acres of corn and other grains of all kinds, valued at an average of L. 7 per 
Scotch acre, . - - - - L. 8680 0 0

Manufactures. — The principal, indeed the only staple manufac- 
ture of the parish, is the weaving of coarse linens, called Osna- 
burghs. Along with this, some occasional work is done in sheeting 
and shirting, but chiefly for private use. Many of the families en- 
gaged in this work have small farms, held either in lease or feu, 
which they cultivate at their leisure hours. There is a spinning- 
mill in the Den of Letham, moved by the water of Vinney, for 
spinning lint and tow into yarn. This mill is furnished with a steam- 
engine to move the machinery when the water is deficient. But I 
understand they have had no occasion to have recourse to steam 
these several years past. Formerly, spinning was the peculiar 
province of the women. But since the spinning-mills have become 
so numerous, they have betaken themselves to weaving, and there 
are nearly as many women now employed at the loom as men. Al- 
though some attempts have been made to introduce power-looms, 
they have not been found to answer for the coarse fabrics of this 
district. All weaving is done by the piece. At present, every 
person who is willing to work finds employment. There is, how- 
ever, a general complaint of the lowness of wages, although none 
of the highness of provisions. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Towns, §-c.— The principal village in the parish is Le- 
tham, which, with its adjuncts, contains upwards of 900 souls. It 
was laid out on a very regular plan by the late Mr Dempster, and 
IS yearly uicreasing. There are two markets here for all kinds of 



152 FORFAIISHIRE. 

bestial, hiring of servants, &amp;c. There is a linen-hall in this vil- 
lage, which is now converted into a school-room. 

North of Letham there is a long stragghng village called Drum- 
mietermon, chiefly inhabited by small farmers, most of whom are 
weavers. There are also small villages at Bounefad, at Craichy, 
Cotton of Lownie, and Kirkton of Dunnichen. 

To the west of Dunnichen there is another stragghng village, 
called Cotton of Lownie, chiefly inhabited by small farmers, most 

of whom are also weavers. i .i,- i 

In the Kirkton of Dunnichen an annual fair is held on the third 
Wednesday of March, Old Style. This is said to have been a 
great market in former times, and was held with contmuation of 
days. Now very little business is done there ; and only a few idle 
people assemble at it for amusement. 

Means of Communicatio7i.-The old roads of this parish are ge- 
nerally very ill contrived. The principal road upon the estate ol 
Dunnichen is too narrow, and is always miry in wet weather. A 
new toll road from Dundee to Brechin has long been in contempla- 
tion, which will pass through Letham. This road has been com- 
pleted in some places to the northward, and has been already formed 
in so far as it passes through the estate of Dunnichen. It cannot 
fail to be of great advantage to this district, by opening an easy 
communication with the distinguished port of Dundee. There are 
only four bridges in the parish, each of one arch. 

Ecclesiastical State.-The earhest place of wx,rship m the parish 
was situated in the shallow lake, or Mire of Dunnichen on what 
has some appearance of having been an 'fif 
which some of the foundations are still visible. A deep ditch had 
rled it from the solid land; and the ditch seems to have ben 
crossed by a draw-bridge. Thisplace obtamed the name of St Co - 
land's Chapel. After William the Lion had grantedallthe lands - 
nexed to Red Castle, and many others, to the monastery of A - 
bro'th of which he was the founder, it appears tkit this fraterni  
:t'ted Cowsland's Chapel into a parish church, and co.ti- 
ed all their lands in this quarter mto a parish -"-f J

The present church is situated on a rising ground at the lower 
part of the kirk-town of Dunnichen. It is on the outside of the 
parish, — there being only three inhabited houses, of which the 
mansion-house of Dunnichen is one, near to it on the north. This 
church was built from the foundation in 1802, but in a very im- 
perfect manner. It is in a damp situation, was covered with heavy 
sand-stone flags, and the cupples, being of young unseasoned wood, 
were so completely rotten, that in 1817, it became necessary to 
furnish it with a new roof, covered with blue slates. It can accom- 
modate about 500 sitters, and is lotted into three divisions, corre- 
sponding to the valuation in the county books of the three estates 
in4;he parish. Each proprietor subdivides his portion of the church 
among his tenants. Since the people of Kirkden have got a spa- 
cious and elegant new church in the neighbourhood of Letham, 
most of these people have got accommodation there. There are 
no free sittings in the church ; and the number of communicants 
always somewhat exceeds 500. 

The old manse was situated immediately under the church-yard, 
which overtopped its eaves. After a long and expensive Htigation 
before the Court of Session, a new manse and offices were built in 
a dry and well-aired situation in 1814-15; but, as the cheapest 
estimate was accepted, and no proper inspector was appointed, 
every thing was done in the most insufficient manner, and the un- 
dertakers were discharged before the work was finished. A more 
effectual repair of the offices was agreed upon last spring; but it 
has been delayed from various causes, until they are in danger of 
falhng down, ° 

There were two adjudications of a glebe by the presbytery. Tlie 
hrst allotted four acres of arable or tilled land, with two acres of 
meadow pasture, besides the garden and stance of manse and offices, 
which are half an acre. There were included some patches which 
never had been tilled, but which have since been trenched and 

times. Forty-eight bolls of oats, payable to the parson of Dunnichen, were after 
wd. exchanged for 19 bolls of meal. Tins shows that black oats w" e U n cuh '

he is in quest of a person of his own sentiments, to be estabhshed in 
it as a settled minister. In this he has not yet succeeded. . 

Upon the whole, however, the parish church is very well attended. 
The number of persons frequenting the chapel of the Congrega- 
tionalists, and who reside in this parish, amounts to 20. Of Se- 
ceders, there are probably about 60 individuals in the parish. — 
All the rest of the parishioners adhere to the established church. 

Education. — The parochial school is situated at Craichy. The 
original object of placing it there was to accommodate the people 
on the estate of Tulloes. But these people being mostly removed, 
there are few children within reach of the school. The teacher 
has enjoyed a complete university education, and is well qualified in 
classical literature, in arithmetic, algebra, and the higher branches 
of calculation ; also in mathematics, and their apphcation to prac- 
tical purposes. He sometimes has a scholar or two in Latin, but 
seldom has any demand for the higher branches of education 
The dwelling-house consists of only two apartments, and the 
school-room has a cold damp floor, which is very uncomfortable 
for chddren m wmter. The number of scholars is sometimes about 
30, but IS often below that number. The salary is the maximum.' 
Ihe fees are the lowest allowed in country schools, namely, 2s 6d 
a quarter for beginners; 3s. for those advanced to writing; and 4s 
for those learnmg arithmetic. The amount of school fees actual- 
ly received is very various, and in a course of years may ave- 
rage from L. 5 to L. 6 per annum. The teacher is also session- 
clerk, at a salary of L. 2, 7s. : but he gives L. 2 of that to the 
precentor, and receives only such perquisites as accrue. He is

PKESBYTEUY Or EOKFAR, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEAKNS. 

THE REV. THOMAS EASTON, D. D. MINISTER. 



I _T0P0GRAPHY AND NATURAL HiSTOBY. 

Name, Bomidarie., 4-c.-K.En10.uiR lies at the north side of 
the extensive and fertile valley of Strathmore, m the coun y of 
Angus, and is about eighteen miles from Dundee, t™n'y from 
Arbrolth, and as many from Montrose. The name .s by some 
supposed to be mnpounded of two words, Corne-,nor, tlu: h,ye 
iJL or deu; by others, it is said to be a Ce t,c --f'- 
means the " large quarter or StetJ' The pos,t.on of the tovu, 
on the side of a ravine or den, which extends nearly a m.le m 
length, and is upwards of 100 feet in depth, supports the fornier 
derivation; whik the latter may be supposed to have refe,-ence to. 
the great extent of country which the parish embraces. 

The parish is divided into two considerable d.str,c.s, wh.ch a e 
separated from each other by part of the pansh of Kurgoldrum . 
he one, the northern, usually called Glenprosen, .s ch.efly 
pastor" , -the other, the southern, is agricultural and manufactur- 
ing The southern division is nearly square m tt. orrn, bemg, 
according to Mr Blackadder, about five m.les m each d.reet.on 
and conLs about 16,000 imperial acres. The 'o''--,

authority, from two to four miles in breadth. It contains abou

■while the southern division is chiefly level, the northern division is 
nearly all mountainous. ' 

In viewing the southern division of the parish from the hill 
of Kirriemuir, from which it is nearly all visible, we find that for 
about a mile to the north of the parishes of Forfar and Glam- 
mis it is nearly level ; and that then it rises gently, forming al- 
most one continued sloping bank, till within a few hundred yards 
of the town, which stands nearly in the centre, and is separated 
from this bank by a deep hollow or " den," to which we have 
already alluded. To the east and west of the town the parish 
is nearly flat ; to the north it is almost level, till we reach the 
braes of Inverquharity, the summits of which are covered with 
thriving plantations, which contribute greatly to their beauty. 

The northern division of the parish may be described as consist- 
ing of a large glen along the Prosen, flanked by lofty mountains 
which rise on either side, but which are intersected by numerous 
small glens and openings. 

The most remarkable mountain in the parish is Catlaw, part 
of which is in the parish of Kirriemuir, and part in the parish of 
Kingoldrum. This mountain forms the foremost of the Grampian 
ridge, which extends in an uninterrupted chain from the German 
Ocean to the Atlantic, and is by some supposed to be the Mons 
Grampius of Tacitus. It is 2264 feet above the level of the sea. 

The braes of Inverquharity, and the hill of Kirriemuir, the only 
eminences of any consequence in the southern division of the pa- 
rish, are under cultivation up to their summit ; but the mountains 
of Glenprosen are in general covered with heath, interspersed 
with patches of grass, produced or cherished by the many rills of 
water which run down their sides. 

Meteorologij—Climate.—The climate of the parish varies consi- 
derably,— the lower part being milder and more temperate than the 
higher, except in the middle of summer, when, owing to the reflexion 
of the sun's rays from the hills, the latter is perhaps warmer than the 
foi-mer. About the boundaries of the parishes of Forfar and Glam- 
mis, the air is milder than near the town, and to the northward of 
It. Upon the whole, the climate of the southern division of the 
parish may be described especially since the ground has been so 
much drained, as more dry than moist, more clear than foggy, and 
more salubrious than otherwise; and the sun is often to be seen 
shining on Kirriemuir while the low parishes in the Strath are 
enveloped ,n mist. Many persons of both seies arrive at the r 



age

of three-score and ten and even fourscore years. In the district 
of Glenprosen, the population of which amounts to 295, there are 
ten persons above eighty years of age ; and some time ago I noticed 
four persons conversing together on the street whose umted ages 
amounted to 333. In 1833 the deaths amounted to 1 in 62-ot 
which 34 averaged 73, and 13, 80. There is an mstance of a 
married couple who have lived together 64 years. One of their 
daughters has had twenty children. , t u 

The heaviest rains come from the east and south-east, i be- 
lieve that as much rain falls in Kirriemuir as in most of the parishes 
on the west coast of Scotland; but we have more of it at a time 
than they have who get more or less of it every day. I understand 
that the smallest quantity of rain falls in some of the western isles, 
the inhabitants of which seldom see the sun, from its bemg enve- 
loped in a continual fog. The weather with us has been observed 
for many years to continue steadily of the same kind for certain pe- 

riods of time. , .... ■ .i

to some distance on its south side, and contracting into very 
narrow limits, when it approaches the South Esk, and still con- 
tinuing along the banks of the latter to the east side of the 
parish. This species of soil is not confined to the flat haughs on 
the sides of the waters, which are of no great extent, but stretches 
over most of the elevated grounds within the above limits ; and in 
the lowest portion of the parish, on the south-west, there is an 
extensive flat tract, about two miles long and one mile broad, of 
a similar description. The whole of the remainder, forming the 
centre of this division of the parish, is incumbent on a thick bed 
of clay, intermixed with stones, provincially termed mortar. Upon 
many of the heights this deposit is of little depth, but it is rarely 
.altogether awanting, and in few cases does the subjacent rock reach 
to . the sod. This deposit consists of a heterogeneous mixture 
ot clay, sand, and stones of all sizes, from those of many tons 
weight down to the smallest pebble ; and is in its nature imper- 
vious to water. The soil on it is therefore more or less damp, 
unless when possessed of considerable depth, which is frequently 
the case on the face of sloping grounds, on moderate elevations, 
or in flats and hollows, where there is an alluvial deposit. In 
such situations, the richest soil of the parish is found, consisting

Johnston,— levelling eminences, and filling up excavations ; and, 
in the course of three years, he found that the whole moss had 
subsided about three feet, and, in consequence, had become more 
compact and dry. Having divided the moss into fields, he began 
at the lower end by trenching the ground; the peats he laid aside 
for sale ; but that part of the moss which was of no value he 
levelled,— covering the whole with a tramp of clay taken from the 
bottom, so that the whole of what has been treated in this way 
presents a regular surface. For the last seventeen years, the 
value of peats sold has amounted annually to a sum from L. 100 to 
L.150 Sterhng; and the ground from which the peats are duo-, 
amountmg now to twenty or thirty acres, formerly of no use, has 
already produced good crops of grass and corn. Such moss lands 
should be allowed to lie long in grass; and, before beino- broken 
up, they should be pared and burned,-a small quantity of lime,

when the fit of running or leaping comes on, nothing was found 
tending to abate the violence of the disease, so much as allowing 
the patient to exercise himself till nature was exhausted. There 
is only one person in the parish who is known to me as at present 
now liable to be afflicted with this singular disease. 

Hydrography — Rivers. — The only streams in the parish are the 
South Esk, the Prosen, the Carity, and the Garie. The South 
Esk takes its rise round the mountains of Clova ; and after receiv- 
ing many tributary streams in its progress, falls into the sea at 
Montrose. The Prosen has its source in the north-west extre- 
mity of the northern division of the parish, and runs through the 
whole of Glenprosen. It is fed by the rivulets of Lednathy, 
Glenoig, Glenlogy, and many others, and falls into the South 
Esk, near Inverquharity. The Carity fises at Balintore, in the 
parish of Lintrathen, and is lost in the South Esk, near Inverquha- 
rity. The Garie has its source in the Loch of Kinnordy, and 
falls into the Dean a little to the eastward of Glammis Castle. 
Before the loch was drained the Garie was a considerable stream ; 
but it is now so small that often in summer it is scarcely suffi- 
cient to turn a mill. 

Loch of Kinnordy,— The only lake or loch of considerable ex- 
tent in the parish is the Loch of Kinnordy. It was drained in 1 740 
and 1741 by Sir John Ogilvy, for the sake of the marl. It is about 
a mile in length, and half a mile in breadth, and abounded, as the 
Rev. George Ogilvy assures us, in pike, perch, and the large 
silver-coloured eel. This lake being but imperfectly drained at 
first, Mr Jobson, when proprietor of the lands of Balfour in Kin- 
goldrum, undertook to drain it completely; but after he had ex- 
pended a great deal of money in the attempt, he desisted. In its 
present state it is both unsightly and unhealthy; and it certainly 
should either be drained effectually, or restored to its pristine con- 
dition, by allowing the water once more to cover it. This last 
alternative could easily be accomplished; and it is a matter for 
consideration whether the value of the water, as a reservoir for 
he mills on the Garie, might not compensate for the loss of the 
marl, the demand for which has become of late very limited 

Zooloyy.-Yvom the extent of the parish, and from the great va- 
riety of soil and climate which it embraces, it possesses perhaps as 
.nany varieties in zoology as most others in the kingdom. No per- 
-n IS better acquainted with this branch of natural history than John

wren M. regulus, the least of all European birds; Mr Kinloch 
says it is tolerably plentiful in the forest moor and Logie, and is 
generally to be seen on the largest trees. The land-rail or corn- 
crake {Ralliis crex. The water-rail {R. aquaticiis is sometimes 
to be seen in the marshes on the estates of Kinnordy and Logie. 
The spotted rail R.porzana is very rarely seen. The king-fisher

in winter; but has never heard of their breeding there. The bit- 
tern {Ardea stellaris; Mr Kinloch has heard of their frequenting 
the marshes of Strathmore before they were drained; but they have 
not been seen for many years. 

The woodcock {Scolopax rusticola is common. The goodwit 
{Limosa melanura, and the red-shank or pool-snipe  7oa«MS cali- 
dris, have both been shot at Logie and Kinnordy. The water- 
hen {Fulica chloropus is to be found in all the marshes and 
ditches with reeds in them; Mr Kinloch has seen the coot 
{F. atra in a marsh to the eastward of Logie. The wild swan 
IArim cygnus ferus ; the wild goose {A. anser ferus ; and the 
white fronted goose {A. albifrons, all visit us in the course of their 
migrations. The teal {A. crecca and the wild duck {A. boschas, 
are common in the Loch of Kinnordy. The spotted flycatcher  Mus- 
cipula grisola breeds at Logie, and is not generally known. I 
need scarcely mention, that the different kinds of swallows, the 
chnnney-swallow, the window-swallow, the sand-martin, and the 
iswilt, are common. 

The goatsucker {Caprimulgus EuropcEus has been shot at 
Logie and Kmnordy. The pheasant {Phasianus colchicus is oc- 
casionally to be seen. Black-cock {Tetrao tetrix is common in - 
Glenprosen and in the forest moor. The ptarmigan  T. lagopus 
IS common in Glenprosen. The red-grouse or muirfowl 
ScoUcus IS nowhere more abundant than in- Glenprosen. The 
quai {Perdx cotumix is an occasional visitant to L corn-fields

C. pyri. This insect is very common on the fruit trees of the 
garden walls of Kinnordy, and does great damage. The gardener 
informs me, that in summer he is obliged to hunt them with candle 
light, as they do not make their appearance during the dav. 
'. The caterpillar. — The larvae of various species of butterfly commit 
great devastation on the leaves of gooseberry bushes, white and 
red currant bushes, and on cabbages. I have never seen them 
attack the black currant. The eggs are laid with great regularity 
on the under part of the leaf ; and I know of no remedy so effec- 
tual as picking off" the leaves as soon as the eggs are observed on 
them. Mr Donn remarks, that the larvae of Musca fumetarius 
and M.frit are sometimes injurious; the one to wheat, and the 
other to barley. What is provincially called the wire-worm is the 
larva of the Tipula oleracea, a long-legged large fly, common 
about meadows, and also sometimes the larvae of the T. crocata. 
This grub sometimes does much mischief to oats, after grass, par- 
ticularly old grass. The Limax agrestis, or what is commonly cal- 
led the grub, does much injury in some quarters in eating up the 
young wheat in spring, and also the oats in the month of May. Vari- 
ous plans have been tried for their destruction; but none have been 
effectual. The most common is to roll the ground at night with a 
heavy roller, which crushes them, and puts a stop to their work of 
destruction. Papilio napi is often destructive to the braird of 
turnips, and I am acquainted with no remedy. 

But no insect has of late years been more destructive to the fruits 
of the earth than Tipida tritici, or the wheat-fly,-an account of 
which IS to be found in the Transactions of the Linnean Society by 
the Rev. Mr Kirby, and in the 8th Number of the Quarterly Journal 
of Agriculture by Mr Archibald Gorrie. This last gentleman es- 
timates the loss sustained by the farming interest in the carse and 
braes of Gowrie to exceed L. 90,000 Sterling. Like others of the 
msec tribe the wheat-fly in winter is in a' state of larva; and 
abou the beginning of June, having assumed the shape of flies, 
hey begin to appear in those fields where wheat has been grow-

and commence laying their eggs. In the years 1827, 1828, and .

and Mr George Ogilvy remarks, that, in his time, the roots of them 
were dug up in the moor by people casting peat and turf. This 
wood belonged of old to the Earls of Crawford, who set a forester 
over it. It afterwards belonged to the Earl of Strathmore, one of 
whose titles was Heritable Forester of the Forest of Plater. It 
now belongs to Charles Lyell, Esq. of Kinnordy. One of the 
maxims of war, which was bequeathed by King Robert Bruce as 
a legacy to his countrymen, was " Let wood for walls be." There 
is a tradition, accordingly, and it is countenanced by Fordoun, 
that Sir Andrew Moray, the friend of Wallace, and .the Regent 
of Scotland, on a memorable occasion, having been pressed by the 
English, had recourse to the forest of Plater, where he concealed 
himself for the winter, and from which he issued and marched 
straight to Panmure, when a bloody battle was fought, and when 
a distinguished victory was obtained, — 4000 men, among whom 
was Lord Henry Mountfort, having been left dead on the spot.  
The natural timber in the parish is now very hmited in quantity, 
being confined chiefly to birch, alder, hazel, black-thorn, and willows, 
on the sides of the waters at the northern extremity of the parish, and 
in Glenprosen. On dry ground, though bare, there is no tree that 
thrives better than the larch; but for wet land the Scotch fir is to 
be preferred. The best situations for the growth of most kinds of 
trees are found by experience to be the steep banks of dens, and 
the sloping sides of hills. It has been remarked, that oak thrives 
better than any other kind of hard-wood in inferior soils. In low 
moors, where the soil is thin, and the subsoil retentive, trees seldom 
come to any considerable size; but when the subsoil is porous the case 
IS otherwise. Mr Chalmers, who has had great experience as a fo- 
rester, havmg planted nearly 1000 acres on the estate of Kinnordy 

15 an advocate for thin planting,-a practice which he justifies by 
many arguments. There are around Inverquharity Castle a few- 
old chestnut trees, not so remarkable for their size as for their 
age. Ihere are here also many very fine ash-trees, some of 
which are supposed to contain upwards of 100 cubic feet of wood 
of the best quality. I measured an ash-tree, which is upwards of 

16 teet in circumference, and an elm, which is nearly 12 feet. But 
the largest trees in the parish are to be found around the mansion- 
house of Logie. The periphery of the great ash-tree is neariy

have been a severe stroke to Kirriemuir. 

The Cathei-ines. — At no very remote period it was not accounted 
dishonourable for polite clans to commit depredations on each other. 
It was usual for the Highlanders beyond the Grampians to put 
themselves under the command of some warlike chieftain, to form 
themselves into bands of Catherines, as they were called, and to 
levy from all the farmers in their neighbourhood a contribution, 
under the name of black-mail, to secure their forbearance or pro- 
. tection. The fine country of Strathmore could not escape their 
depredations, and many a tale is told of their incursions. We are 
informed, that, even so early as 1392, three chiefs of the name of 
Donnechy, instigated or commanded by Duncan Stewart, a natural 
son of the turbulent Earl of Buchan, came down to ravage this district ; 
and that a bloody battle took place in the Stormonth, in which Sir 
John Ogilvy, of this parish, was slain, with many of his followers. 

Feud between Forfar and Kirriemuir. — At one time feuds were 
not uncommon between rival towns, as well as between rival fami- 
lies. The feud between Perth and Dundee is alluded to by Dr 
Small in his Statistical Account of the latter of these towns. 
There was one equally bitter, though not equally important, be- 
tween the royal burgh of Forfar and the baronial burgh of Kirrie- 
muir. The origin of this feud was trifling,— a dispute respecting 
a piece of ground, called the Muir Moss, which was claimed by 
both parishes, but which was of little value to either. The con- 
test was exceedingly violent. There is a humorous story connect- 
ed with this feud, which is found recorded in the brief biographi- 
cal notice of Drummond the poet, the friend of Johnson and 
Shakspeare, prefixed to the folio edition of his works.  

• In the year 1645, when the plague was raging in Scotland, this eminent person 
came accidentally to Forfar, but was not allowed to enter any house, or to get lodg- 
ing m the town ; which forced him, though it was very late, to direct his bourse to 
K:rriemmr where he was well received and kindly entertained. Being informed of 

letter to I P "'''L'r""''' '•P''" " he wrote a 

letter to the Provost of Forfar, to be communicated to the town-council in haste. It 
was unagmed that this letter came from the Estates, then sitting at St Andrews. The 
common council was summoned with all expedition, and the minister was sent for to

Emznen P.r.on.-i'ar/Zy ./0.y•fo3/o/rZv/.- Hie noble family 
of Airly is descended from Gilbert, a near relation of GUchnst, Earl 
of Angus, a gentleman of high distinction in the reign of Wdham the 
Lion, who succeeded to the crown of Scotland in 1165. He ob- 
tained from that prince a charter to the hds of Powne, Ogilvy, 
and Lintrathen ; and he took the name, Ogilvy, from his barony, as 
was customary in these days. Sir James Ogilvy was so highly es- 
teemed by King James IV. and his court, that he was crea ed 
a peer by the title of Lord Ogilvy of Airly, and sat in his Parha- 
ment in 1491. The eighth Lord Ogilvy, from his great ment and 
eminent services done to King Charles I. -d for the great lojalty 
and fidelity of his ancestors, was farther dignified with the title ot 
Earl of Airly in 1639. David, the then Earl of Airly, had two sons, 
James and John; of whom James, the eldest son, Lord Og, 
having engaged in the rebelhon of 1715, was attainted of high trea- 
son : but his estate was saved by being in his father's person, who 
was then alive. He was afterwards pardon.d ; but died without 
issue. He was succeeded by his brother John, the fourth Earl of 
Airlv. His son. Lord Ogilvy, having engaged m the rebelhon ot 
1745, was attainted of high treason, and escaped into France 
whei4 he had the command of a Scotch regiment called Ogih7 s 
Reffiment. The title was for some time in abeyance ; but was re- 
S n 826 to David, the present Earl, to the satisfaction of 
the whole county, and the enthusiastic joy of Kirriemuir and its 

""'tI' Wy has produced many individuals, no less eminent for 
their patriotism than for their loyalty to their sovereigns ; of these 
none were so distinguished as the first Earl and kis two gallai t 
sons. It was against this noble family that the Marqms of A - 
gy" had orders'to proceed ; and 5000 men were levied for ha 
purpose. Airly, in possession of Lord Ogilvy, and Forthar, the r 
C p incipal sLs, were destroyed, and the tenantry inglonously 
plundered of their corn and cattle. Though the Marquis was ap- 
parently only the instrument, he was the secret mover of this e-

tradition, having taken a hammer, and assisted in the demolition of 
the doorways and hewing of the stone-work till he was overcome 
with fatigue. 

The Earl of Airly, now referred to, was eminent as a soldier, and 
distinguished himself in Montrose's campaigns, in particular at the 
battle of Kilsyth. Nimmo, in his History of Stirlingshire, informs us, 
that a body of 1 000 Highlanders in Montrose's army, without orders, 
marched up the hill to attack the enemy. That consummate general 
sent a strong detachment, under the command of the Earl of Airly, 
to their assistance, whose arrival not only preserved this resolute 
corps from being overpowered by a superior force, with which they 
were going to engage, but turned the balance against their anta- 
gonists, who were obliged to retreat. This was the most complete 
victory which Montrose ever gained. The loss on his side was 
small, — only seven or eight persons having been slain, three of 
whom were named Ogilvy, being relations of the noble family of 
Airly. 

Family of Ogilvy of Inverquharity:— This family, according to 
Douglas, traces its origin to the third son of the deceased Walter 
Ogilvy of Auchterhouse, by name Sir John, who received from his 
brother the lands and barony of Inverquharity in 1420. This fa- 
mily was ever held in the highest estimation,— its members hold- 
ing the highest civil and military appointments. It is not always 
easy, however, to distinguish their exploits from those of the 
house of Airly, to which they were allied. Alexander, second 
son of Sir John, was a youth of extraordinary parts, according to 
Guthrie in his Memoirs of Montrose,— valiant above his age, and 
of a fervent and daring spirit. He joined that distinguished war- 
rior; was taken prisoner in the battle of Philiphaugh; and, for his 
firm adherence to the Royal cause, was executed at Glasgow in the 
tiower of his age, in 1646. 

The song " It was a' for our rightful King," is said to have 
been the production of Captain Ogilvy, son of Sir David Ogilvy of 
Inverquharity. He was along with King James at the battle of the 
Boyne, and afterwards fell in an engagement on the Rhine. It is 
said tliat he was one of the hundred gentlemen who volunteered to 
:tttend their royal master in his exile. The present representative 
of this ancient family is Sir John Ogilvy, an officer in the Guards.

dlestone, in kis learned notes to his edition of Toland, objects to 
this appellation, in as much as no two rocking-stones are to be 
found together. It is singular, however, that there are two a little 
to the north-west of the hill of Kirriemuir, within a few yards of each 
other. The one of them is a block of whinstone, nearly oval, and 
is three feet three inches in height, nine feet in length, and four 
feet ten inches in breadth. The other, of Lintrathen porphyry, 
is two feet in height, eight feet in length, and five feet in breadth. 
The purpose for which these stones were erected is involved in 
mystery. 

Standing-stones. — Of these, the most early of all monuments, 
there are several in Kirriemuir, none of which have inscriptions of any 
kind. The most remarkable in this parish is the " Standing-stone" in 
the hill of Kirriemuir, which has been evidently at some period split 
into two ; one part of it is still standing, the other is lying. The 
standing part is nine feet in height above the surface of the ground. 
At the base it is six feet and six inches in breadth, and at the top 
It IS four feet and six inches; it cannot be less than three or four 
feet m the ground ; and in the memory of man it tapered towards 
the top, but the projecting part has been knocked off. The lying 
part of the stone is twelve feet and nine inches in length. Tra- 
dition is silent as to the purpose for which it was erected. 

Cawe.— Tacitus observes, in his account of the manners of the 
Germans, that it was their custom to dig caves in the earth, where 
they laid up their grain and hved in winter ; and that in these caves 
they would find shelter from their enemies. Of such caves several 
have been discovered in Kirriemuir. The most remarkable is the 

Weems Hole," on the top of the hill of the Mearns,-built, as 

thtl ' r d above 

with large unpolished stones about six feet wide. The entry lies 
towards the south ; and its course may betraced the length  
or seventy yards. The stones now cov;ring the cav are o

The increase of population is supposed to be owing to the policy 
which has of late prevailed, of converting small farms into large 
ones. The surplus population of country parishes being obliged 
m consequence to congregate in towns, Kirriemuir has receiv- 
ed its full share of this emigration, from the increased facility for 
bmldmg, occasioned by the division of a commonty long in dispute, 
and the prospect of employment which the thriving state of the 
hnen manufacture held out. The number of the population re- 
sidmg m the town, including the suburbs, is 4014 ,• residing in the 
villages of Marytown and Ellenertown, 236 ; and residin/in the

dissenting meeting in the town, except a Scots Episcopalian one ; 
since then the people have had their share of those jarrings and 
unchristian resentments which always accompany the introduction 
of new opinions. The Dissenters, who have been some time esta- 
blished here, live on a friendly footing with their neighbours ; and 
the members of the Established Church, the Episcopalians, and 
Seceders, do not look upon one another as of different species, be- 
cause they happen to differ in opinion. I may add, that while 
ignorance and vice still abound, my parishioners are in general 
remarkably well-informed; and many of them are distinguished 
for the benevolence of their dispositions, their piety towards God, 
and the strictest integrity, sobriety, and temperance. For many 
years there has scarcely been a prosecution for poaching in game, 
or in the salmon fishing in the Esk. Smugghng has entirely dis- 
appeared. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural EconomT/.— The number of acres stand- 
ard imperial measure in the lower division of the parish, which 
are either cultivated or occasionally in tillage, according to Mr 
Blackadder, is 11,000; and in the higher division there are of 
arable mtersected with meadow and fine pasture, 2000 acres. The 
number of acres which never have been cultivated, and which re- 
main constantly waste, or in pasture, in the lower part of the pa- 
rish, is 2500, and in the higher part of the parish 15,500. The 
number of acres that might with a profitable application of capital 
be added to the cultivated land of the parish is extremely small. 
1 here IS no part of the parish in a state of undivided common. 
In the ower division of the parish there are 2000 imperial acres 
m plantations, and m the higher there are 500. The waste sur- 
iace of roads, houses, water, &amp;c. may be estimated at 500 imperial

Irrigation is practised in several parts of the parish, but espe- 
cially at Logie, the residence of John Kinloch Esq. of Kdry 
Thenclosures are flooded by the Garje :n November, and 
are continued so till the beginning of Apnl. These enclo- 
sures have been in grass since 1770; and - consequen e of 
the above practice, says the Rev. Thomas Ogdvy m 1792 
 hey are now the earliest and best grass fields m the country, and 
there's not perhaps any in Scotland superior to Jf-e 
the above period," continues he, " they let at from 10s. to 12s the 
totl acrbut las season from 60s. to 90s per acre." Mr Peat 
adds that n 1801 the rent had increased to L. 5 Sterhng per acre. 
The first six or seven years of watering promised no great advan- 
tage, but perseverance has increased their value ten tm.es, and 
that,' too, at a trifling expense. 

In 1830, these fields, after being fifty years m grass, were let for 
a course o cropping, some of them as high as L. 9 5s per Scotch 
acre Last season was wet, but some of the fields produced 
14 bolls of 6 bushels per acre. The advantage of my ton . 
thus demonstrated not only in improvmg the grass, but also m 
aneliorating the soil. I only add, farther, that giss fostered by 
rTX - f-nd to be better adapted for cattle than fo sheep 
The general duration of leases is mneteen years. The state o 
farxt-houses is in general good. A considerable part of the pansl 
s™ closed; partly with hedges, but chiefly with stone wall . The 
greatt pari o'f the' parish is in the hands of mdustnous tenants, 
who follow the most approved methods of husbandry.

brown linen, introduced into the country after the RebelHon in 1745. 
It is supposed that not fewer than 3000 individuals are engaged 
in it, and that the number of webs woven may be 52,000 per an- 
num, containing 6,760,000 yards. This trade has increased three- 
fold since the beginning of the century. From November 1798 to 
November 1799, there were stamped 1,814,874 yards, and from 
November 1799 to November 1800, 1,846,516 yards. There is 
fio peculiarity in the mode of conducting this manufacture ; the 
manufacturers being all practical tradesmen, are well qualified to 
judge of the work when executed ; and the fabrics being few- in 
number, the work is both well and expeditiously done. This ma- 
nufacture, when flourishing, has certainly afforded a fair remune- 
ration and support to those engaged in it, but for several years past 
it has not done so to those who have pursued it on a small scale. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Toion. — The only market-town is Kirriemuir; from which 
the parish takes its name. It is a burgh of royalty of great anti- 
quity, whose baron, the Lord Douglas, the representative of a fa-' 
mily long the most powerful in Scotland, enjoys a fixed jurisdic- 
tion, both civil and criminal, which he may exercise by himself 
or his deputy. Before the abolition of hereditary jurisdiction in 
Scotland, his powers were exceedingly extensive, in virtue of 
which, " per fossam et furcam," that is, drowning in a ditch or 
pool, or by suspending on a gallows, he could punish all per- 
sons guilty of certain crimes, from the Law of Dundee to the 
Grampian mountains. If he imposed fines on criminals, he was. 
allowed to appropriate them to himself. Mr Wood is said to 
have been the last deputy who exercised the power of life and 
death. For some goods stolen, he condemned and executed two 
mdividuals. Walker and Rob by name, and seized on their pro- 
perty ; and it is generally said, that avarice influenced him as much 
as a sense of justice. The functionaries who succeeded Mr Wood 
seem to have conducted themselves with propriety,— the most of 
them keeping « brevvseats;" and, as there is « more law in good 
ale than m any in Westminster-hall," the lieges were accustomed, 
under their auspices, to make up their disputes under a quaich of 
their favourite beverage. Since 1748, the bailie can judge in no 
civil actions where the debt or damage exceeds forty shillings Ster- 
"ng; and m cases of assault, battery, and minor oflbnces, he can 
'mpose a fine not exceeding twenty shillings Sterling, or set the de-

linquent in the stocks in the day time, for not more than three hours. 
The fine is to be levied by poinding the delinquent s goods, and m 
default of these, by imprisonment for a period not exceeding one 
month. The restrictions lying upon the baron are now so heavy, 
that Mr Erskine says, they amount nearly to a prohibition oi the 

. a He.a, a„a peasant ... 

ed to resemble an anchor. The view fron. the lower part of .t « 
bou' ded by the southern brow of the Den; from the h,gher part 
is seen nearly the whole extent of the magmfioent valley of Strath- . 
o e But'the most extensive view in the parish ts fK,m the h,U 
Tf Kirriemuir,-the summit of which is a place of cons.derable ex- 
tent, terminated by a bold and precipitous front on the south but 
descending in eve other direction with a gentle mchnat.on. Here 
h spectator has inly to turn his eyes towards e east where e 
hills of the Mearns present themselves washed by die German 
ocean ; from the top of which hills blazed of old " the baleful fire 
Zi g the inhabitants of the district of the approach of dang .. 
In thisdirection, too, are seen the picturesque heights o F n-

his part of the prospect, the spectator may '™

hills around whose summits "the stormy mist gathers, reacli- 
Tn ' the confines of dark Lochnagar " with its steep frowning

Tnd " high Dunsinnan hill," rich with classical associations, and hal-

1X01 hand, as far as the eye can reach, the glorious valley of 
S«hm"e presents itself, with its hundred towns, its churches 
casdes villas, plantations, lakes, and streams, bounded by the 
sTcnaws, who esides are either clothed with woods or enncli d 
with tenriant crops of corn; in short, there ,s nothing wantnig

Several years ago, G. L. Meason, Esq. of Lindertis feued two 
parts of his property, which have now swelled into villages, — the 
one, Marytown, containing 136 inhabitants; and the other, Elli- 
norton, the inhabitants of which amount to 108. 

Means of Communication. — The north mail arrives at Kirrie- 
muir every morning. About fifty years ago, the revenue from the 
post-office amounted in one year, after paying the necessary ex- 
pense, to no more than 8d. ; it now amounts to L. 360 per an- 



num. 



There is only one turnpike-road at present in the parish, and 
it does not extend to more than three miles. The most import- 
ant bridge is at Shielhill, over the Esk. The bridge over the Pro ■ 
sen was widened lately at the sole expense of the Earl of Airly. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is conveniently situated 
for the lower part of the parish ; and no part of the population of 
this district is distant above three or four miles from it. The pa- 
rish church was built in 1 787, and is in an excellent state of re- 
pair. It is seated for 1260. There are no free sittings. 

The manse was built in 1774, but so insufficiently, that it was 
repaired in 1787. It was again repaired in 1802. This year it 
will undergo a thorough repair. 

The glebe consists of four acres and one rood. The minister 
is allowed L. 20 Scots, in lieu of a grass glebe. The teinds of 
the parish were valued in 1634. The stipend, as modified in 1812 
by the court of teinds, amounts to 191 bolls of grain,— two-thirds 
meal and one-third barley,— and L. 72 Sterling, inculding L. 8, 
6s. 8d. for communion elements. ' 

There are no chapels of ease attached to the Established Church • 
but there is a missionary minister on the Royal Bounty, who officiates 
alternately m Clova, one of the united parishes of Clova and Cor- 
tachy, and m Glenprosen, connected with Kirriemuir. There is 
one meeting-house in connection with the Original Constitutional 
feynod; another in connection with the United Secession Church- 
and a third in connection with the Relief. There is also a small 
congregation of Independents, who meet in the afternoon of the 
iord s day for worship and mutual edification. The ministers are 
respectably supported by the contributions of their hearers . The 



186 FORFARSHIRE. 

Rev. Mr Aitken, and his colleague, the Rev. Mr Anderson, have 
each L. 60 per annum. There is also an Episcopalian chail. 

The great body of the people, however, is attached to the Esta- 
blished Church, and the number of Dissenters and Episcopalians 
cannotbeestimated at more than one-seventh part of the population. 
About 300 1831 attend the meeting in connection with the Ori- 
ginal Constitutional Synod, 200 of whom are communicants; fully 
more attend the meeting in connection with the United Secession 
church; 220 are communicants, 13 of whom come from adjommg 

The concregation in connection with the Relief is only forming, 
and the communicants 1831 are not above 40. There are now 
upwards of 200 communicants. The Independents consist only of a 
few families. The Episcopalians are not numerous. 

Divine service at the Estabhshed Church, and, I understand, 
also at the several chapels, is generally well attended. The com- 
municants in connection with the Established Church are not fewer 
than 2500. In 1830, the number of actual commumcants was 
2021, and in the chapel at Glenprosen, 189 ; in all, 2210. 

Scietiesfir Religious Purposes.-Vhe.e are several societies for 
reltious purposes estabhshed in the parish. 1. Bible Society, auxi- 
ia y to the Bible Society of Edinburgh; 2. Missionary Society, 
auiliary to the Missionary Society of Edinburgh ; 3. Ladies S - 
c ety foi promoting the Education of Females in India ; 4. Sabbath

Heniys Mortification. — Mr Henry of Kensington, a native of 
Kirriemuir, bequeathed in trust the sum of L. 1400 to the mini- 
ster and elders ; the interest of L. 1200 to be laid out in educat- 
ing and furnishing with school-books, pens, ink, and paper, twelve 
boys, or as many more as the money would educate ; and the inte- 
rest of the remaining L. 200 to be paid to the parochial school- 
master for keeping the accounts. In consequence of some diffi- 
culties which had arisen respecting some part of Mr Henry's pro- 
perty, the whole matter came before the Lord Chancellor, who 
settled it in the following manner : The capital having been placed 
in the funds at an advantageous time, his Lordship found to be 
L.2192, 33. 6d. 3 per cent, with L. 394, 12s. Sterling of accu- 
mulated interest: he determined L. 50 Sterling of this interest to 
purchase ground for building a school-house, and L. 100 Sterling 
to be expended on the building; the interest of L. 200 Sterling 
was allotted to the schoolmaster, and the interest of the remaining 
sum was to be applied to the education of as many boys at the pa- 
rochial school as could be admitted on it, at the rate paid for the 
education of other boys. The bays are entitled to remain at school 
four years, and on completing that period, they are entitled to re- 
ceive a Bible. They are treated in all respects as other scholars, 
and in case of a competition for admission, a preference is given 
to boys of the name of Henry. They are taught the common 
branches of education. On this fund, there are educated about 
50 boys. 

The Webster Bequest— John Webster, Esq. writer, and agent 
for a branch of the British Linen Company, in 1829, left by his 
will the whole of his property, amounting to upwards of L. 8000, 
to Charles Lyell, Esq. of Kinnordy, to the minister and elders of 
the parish, and the officiating baron-bailie of Kirriemuir, for insti- 
tuting, erecting, perpetually endowing, and for regulating a school 
m the-town of Kirriemuir, at which the youth of the town and pa- 
nsh might be instructed in the arts and sciences, or in such branches 
ot education as his trustees might think most suitable. The trus- 
tees are at present engaged in collecting the money, which thev 
are secunng in the funds ; and, as soon as the amount is ascertain- 
ed, they will erect suitable buildings, and endow schools, in terms 
0 the will. As they are anxious that the poor should receive in 



188 FOIIFARSUIIIE. M 

the meantime benefit from the bequest, they have agreed to pay | 
the parish schoolmaster for the education of twenty boys at the . 
same rate as for the boys who are educated on Henry s mortifica- 
tion They have also erected a female school for educatmg fifty 
poor girls in such branches of education as are suitable to their 
years and sex. Both of these plans are temporary, and may at any 
time be altered or superseded. . 

The parochial teacher's salary is L. 36, 7s. 2d. includmg 
L. 2, 2s. 9|d. in lieu of garden-ground ; and the amount of school 
fees received may be L. 100. The salary of the schoohms ress 
on the Webster bequest is L. 40 per annum, including L. o lor 
rent of school-room and for coals. 

The parochial teacher has the legal accommodations. ihe 
number of the young betwixt six and fifteen years of age who are 
not receiving instruction in reading and writing is small. Ihe 
number of persons upwards of fifteen years of age who cannot read 
or write is not one to a thousand. The people through the whole , 
parish are alive to the benefits of education ; and there can be no 
douUUat avisible change maybe observed in the conduct and 
nioral of the people since the facilities of education have been in-

terest on stock, L. 2 ; in all, L. 224, 7s. 3d. There is no other 
regular mode of procuring funds for the poor besides that of church 
collections. There has hitherto been a strong disposition among 
the poor in general to refrain from seeking parochial relief, but I 
regret to observe it is fast declining. 

Prison. — There is a lock-up place of considerable strength, 
chiefly employed for confining vagrants till they are brought to 
justice. 

iaiVs.— There are two great annual fairs held on the hill of 
Kirriemuir, the one in July, and the other m October, for sheep, 
cattle, and horses ; there are two smaller ones held at the same 
place, the one in June, and the other in December, for the same 
purpose. 

Inns, r.— Ihere are in the parish 6 brewers, 1 maltman, 1 
chandler, 1 tobacco-manufacturer, 52 dealers in tea, 48 in to- 
bacco, 4 m vinegar, 31 in beer, 31 in spirits, and 7 in wine The 
effects of the number of spirit-sellers on the morals of the people 
are obvious.  

iM,Z._ The fuel commonly used is coals from Dundee, peats 
from the mosses in the neighbourhood, and wood from Glammis, 
Lindertis, and Kinnordy.

I- — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Boundaries, c— The parish of Lochlee ' derives its 
name from a lake in the west end of the parish. Its extent from 
east to west is about 15 miles, and its mean breadth 7 miles;— but 
the inhabited part does not extend above 8 miles in length and 3 
miles in breadth. Its superBcial extent is upwards of 100 square 
miles It IS bounded on the north by the parishes of Birse, Aboyne 
and Glenmuick, in Aberdeenshire; on the west by Cortachie and 
Clova; on the south by the united parishes of Lethnot and Navar- 
and on the east by Edzell. Its form is a parallelogram. It is 
situate among the Grampian mountains, the highest range of 
which separates it from Aberdeenshire. The elevation of Mount 
Keen, the summitof whichforms thedivision between the twocoun- 
les on the north-west, is about 4000 feet; and Mount Bat- 
the w T T'' '-' -«-tains on

Zoology. — The foxes in the parish have been very destructive 
to lambs; but by hunting, and other means used for their de- 
struction, their number has of late been greatly diminished. Many 
badgers and wild cats are found among the rocks and cairns ; but 
they seldom do hurt to the sheep. Foxes and wild cats destroy a 
great number of grouse, which in a favourable season are plenti- 
ful on the moors. The Alpine hare abounds on the hills ; and 
deer and roebucks traverse the glens. The high inaccessible rocks 
• are frequented by large eagles and hawks. There are a few com- 
mon hares and partridges on the low grounds. Vipers or adders, 
some of very large size, are numerous in the parish ; and lizards 
abound in all the moors. Wild geese and swans visit the loch 
sometimes in winter. 

The breed of cattle, sheep, and horses is the same as in the low 
country ; but the cattle never attain to the same weight. A small 
flying insect during the evenings of August and September is 
very troublesome to the people from its bite ; but the least breath 
of wind makes it disappear. 

Botany.— An immense quantity of bog-myrtle abounds in the 
marshy ground ; and foxglove and other plants of various kinds 
are found on the hills and in the valleys. 

There are several acres of natural birch wood of the very best 
kind growing on the sides of the hills ; there are also a few ash- 
trees, mountain-ash, alders, or Scotch mahogany. Several of the 
hills are well adapted for Scotch fir ; and larches in particular, 
though at present there are no plantations of these in the parish,' 
would thrive remarkably well, if the sheep were kept from hurtinff 
them.  

II- — Civil History. 
Emmmt Men.~lt may be worth while to record, that Alexan- 
der Ross, A.M. parochial schoolmaster, and author of the For- 
tunate Shepherdess, a pastoral poem of considerable merit, was 
interred in this parish. He died forty-eight years ago, at the ad- 
vanced age of eighty-four. 

Land-oioner.~The Right Honourable Lord Panmure is sole 
proprietor of the parish.

kept. The ago and diseases if known of all persons dying are 

carefully recorded. , , i j W 

AmLities.- tumuli occur upon the low barren ground 
of the parish. One of these was opened some time ago by a black- 
smith, who found in it the head of a battle-axe, which he did not 
scruple to make into hob-nails. , . t i 

The only building of antiquity is the old castle of Invermark, 
situate opposite to the manse. It was built in 1526. It was long 
the residence of the Lindsays, the proprietors of the parish. The 
roof was taken off forty years ago: but the walls, which are up- 
wards of three feet thick, and remarkably strong, may stand tor 
other three centuries. i 

HI. — Population. \ 
The population has varied little for the last hundred years. At 
present it is rather less than at the census of 1821 in consequence 
of the stop that has been put to smuggling within the last four 
years. In 1821, the population was 572; m 1831, it was 553. 
There are no villages in the parish.

Character and Halits of the People.-ln general, the people 
are remarkably cleanly in their houses and persons ; as also in their 
f od, which I plain ind substantial They enjoy all the neces- 
a ies, and many of the comforts, of life. Kindness to strangers 
s one of their distinguishing characteristics ; and, being content- 
ed with the lot which Providence has assigned them, they can feelj 
for the distresses of others; their hospitable doors are ever open,4 
and the beggar is not sent empty-handed away. They are pos- 
sessed of mSh natural shrewdness, which many of them have im- 
proved by extensive reading; and they attend punctually to thj 
ordinances of religion. 1 

IV. — Industry. \ 
Agriodture and Rural Ecy.-The arable land is .o 
scattered throughout the parish, that the number of .m, er,al ac s 
ann be veryLuratel, ascertained, except b, actual me.u  
meT Probably 1400 acres may be very near the gross amount. 



LOCIILEE.

while there are upwards of 60,000 acres that have never been under 
tillage, 200 of which might be reclaimed at an expense of from 
L. 12 to L. 16 per acre. There are about 100 acres of natural 
wood, consisting almost entirely of birch, with a few ash, alder, and 
rowan-tree or mountain-ash. 

Rent of Land. — When the arable land bears so small a propor- 
tion to the waste, it is impossible to say what the average rent of 
the former is ; but it is generally considered not worth more than 
15s. per acre, the hill pasture in many small farms being given 
along with it. 

Rate of Wages. — Labourers, besides victuals, get from lOd. to 
Is. per day during winter, and from Is. to Is. 3d. per day during 
summer; — carpenters, masons, &amp;c. generally receiving about twice 
as much. Farm-servants and shepherds get from L. 5 to L. 7 
during the half year; and female servants, during the same period, 
from L. 2 to L. 3, 10s., exclusive of victuals. 

Breeds of Lwe-Stock.—M.uch. attention has of late been paid 
to the breeding of cattle, horses, and sheep. The two former are 
of the Angus breed, but the cattle are small ; the latter, principally 
black-faced, are bought in the south country when lambs, at from L. 5 
to L. 7 and L. 8 the clad score. About 3000 lambs are reared 
from ewes within the parish. To encourage the rearing of sheep 
within the parish, or the importation from the south country, Lord 
Panmure has, with his usual liberality, established an annual show 
at Millden, where he gives prizes to those of his tenants who brinff 
forward the best samples of sheep. 

_ Hushandry.—Most of the farmers observe a rotation of six years 
in croppmg, viz. a white, a green, two white, and two grass crops. 
All the new leases are for nineteen years ; but there are still a few 
hferenters in the parish. There are a very few enclosures; and, in 
general, the farm-houses and steadings are in good repair, and are 
upheld by the tenants. Great improvements have of late years 
been made by many individuals in trenching baulks, &amp;c. and in 
making close fields. 

Produce.—The average annual value of raw produce raised in 
le parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows :—

receives from L. 10 to L. 12 yearly in fees. 

There are no persons in the parish above six years of age who 
cannot read, and very few who cannot write. 

Library. — There is a parochial library containing upwards of 
130 volumes, principally of a religious nature. 

Poor. — The average number of persons receiving parochial aid 
is from 8 to 10; and they receive from Is. to Is. 6d. per week. 
The total amount yearly distributed among the poor may be about 
L. 24 ; of which L. 2 is the interest of mortified money, and the 
remainder from church collections. 

Inns, Sj-c. — There is one licensed alehouse in the parish, which 
is too much frequented, especially during winter. 

Fuel. — Peat and turf is the fuel on which the inhabitants prin- 
cipally depend. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The yearly rent of the whole parish in 1714, amounted to 
L.284, 4s. 6|d. Sterling: in 1792 it was L. 385, 12s.: in 1832 
it was L. 984 Sterling. A number of the farms which have been 
lately let have been raised to 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 times the former 
rent. Some of them let within these twelve years are from 10 to 
25 per cent, above the real value, considering that the price of 
cattle, wool, and sheep, has fallen more than one-half since that 
time.

PRESBYTERY OF FORPAR, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. J. BUIST, MINISTER. 



I Topography and Natural History. 

Name and Boundaries.— The name of this parish was formerly 
spelt Tannadyse ; but in more modern times it is spelt Tannadice. 
Both are obviously resolvable into Taijnatas, a Gaelic word, which 
signifies " a low warm green plat upon the water." A better de- 
scription could not be given in any number of words, of the low shel- 
tered bottom, situated on the South Esk, on which the church, 
manse, and kirk-town or village stand. But although peculiarly ap- 
plicable to these, it is not so to much of the rest of the parish, 
which is in the form of an obtuse-angled triangle; the side sub- 
tending the obtuse angle, which is from 11 to 12 miles long, 
separating on the E. and N. E. the parish of Tannadice from those 
of Careston, Fern, and Navar; and the sides which contain the 
obtuse angle, separating Tannadice on the S. E., S. W. and N. 
W from the parishes of Aberlemno, Oathlaw, Kirriemuir, and Uor- 
tachy The boundary lines contain not less than 60 square miles 
of surface, or 38,400 imperial acres. The longitude of the parish 
is about two degrees east, and its latitude forty degrees north. 

Topographical Appearances.— Yvom the S. E. point ol the 
triangle, the surface of the parish gradually rises in undulating 
ridges to the foot of the Grampians. Of these, the most eleva- 
ted is called St Arnold's seat, which is nearly 500 feet higher than 
the parish church, and not less than 800 above the level of the 
sea Nothing of the history of this saint is known, nor is any rea- 
son assigned for his resting on this lofty eminence, surmounted by 
a large cairn. The view from this height extends to the Scottish 
capital,-having the Pentland and Lammermuir hills m the back 
ground, with much varied and interesting scenery intervening. 

Hydrography.-'Theve are two beautiful streams m the parish, 
the one called the South Esk, the other, the Noran, on whose 
banks a showy house and court of offices were lately erected, and 



TANNADICE.

from their situation called Noranside. The former of these arises 
from Loch Esk, in the parish of Clova, about twenty miles above 
the kirk of Tannadice ; within which parish the latter also arises ; 
and both unite at the south-east angle of theparishr The course 
and quantity of water of the former are treble that of the latter. 
Both afford excellent amusement to anglers; but it is only in the 
Esk that salmon is found, and that in quantities so inconsiderable 
that no one has appropriated them. Mussels may be found in the 
Esk ; but neither so numerous nor valuable as they are reported 
to have formerly been, when many of them were annually collect- 
ed for sake of the pearls of uncommon size which they contained. 

Geology. — -A dike of whinstone rock runs from east to west the 
whole breadth of the parish. No other stone appears on the south 
of this dike ; but close to it, and on the north, there lies a reddish 
coarse sandstone, which is quarried at various places, and fit for 
different purposes, particularly for building dikes. This stone gra- 
dually grows darker in the colour, till it reaches nearly the summit 
of the lower Grampian ridge, where blue slates are found ; but 
these are small, and considerably warped, — circumstances which, 
together with the ease and abundance with which gray slates can 
be got, prevent the blue from being much quarried. This vein 
appears to be a continuation of that which originates at Johnshaven, 
in the Mearns, and terminates at Easdale, in Argyleshire, and is 
advantageously quarried in the neighbourhood of Dunkeld, Nevv- 
tyle, and other places. 

n. — Civil History. 
Antiquities.— Three conical tumuli called Laws have in this pa- 
rish been levelled, and the ground on which they stood cultivated 
within these few years. In these tumuli, coarse earthen pots or 
urns were found, protected and surrounded by six flat square 
stones, and containing a quantity of black ashes, probably the re- 
mains of the illustrious dead ; while the remains of the less eminent 
seem to have been deposited in, and covered by the same number of 
stones, called coffins, but without any urns or ashes, or accumula-

still, the castles of Cortachy and Innerquharity, with their policies 
of aged vood, the South Esk winding amongst them its dark, 
troubled, and noisy way to the ocean.-About two miles farther 
down the stream, stands the house of Inshewan, very lately built 
by its present worthy occupant, John Ogilvy, Esq. who constantly 
resides there with his family. On the north of this house is a 
moor lately planted, which promises soon to become a gre  
ment, and to afford much shelter.- About four miles still farther 
down, stands the house of Tannadice, built about thirty years ago 
by Charles Ogilvy, Esq. who acted about twenty years as a sur- 
gLn in the East India Company's Service It has m front, he 
Esk, with a bridge over it of three arches, and the castle and hiU ot 
Finhaven, and is surrounded by young planting of the proprietor s 
own raising.-Nearly opposite, and on the other side of the wate , 

is the house of Whitewell, the property of Gemmel, E q. 

which he inherits from a paternal grandfather. There are also 
the houses of Easter Ogle and Wester Ogle, and Glenqmech 
and on Wester Markhouse, Major Swinburn has just built a hand- 
some dwelling in the style of the Enghsh cottage. _

III.— Population. 
On a map, engraven about fifty years ago froiB a ' 
county made by Mr Ainslie, the population of tins parish is sUt 
ed to be 2000. Bv the census of 1801, the population is nearly 



TANNADICE. 



201 



1300. At the former of these periods, there were many small 
holdings in Glenquiech, and more particularly in Glen Ogle, the 
dwellings on which have been demolished, their patches of plough- 
ed land and gardens converted into pasture, and the whole let as 
sheep-farms. From these circumstances the decrease of popula- 
tion may be easily and satisfactorily accounted for. By the cen- 
sus of 1831, the population was 1560. This increase may be ac- 
counted for from several feus having been granted, and good houses 
erected on them, and from a number of new houses having been 
built by one proprietor, in the village. The spinning and plash- 
mills have also tended to increase the population. 

The number of families in the parish is . . - - 294 

of families chiefly employed in agriculture, - - 120 

in trade, manufactures, or handicraft, 72 

Nine licensed ale and whisky-houses, spinning and plash-mills, 
bothies, and a heckling-house, contribute nothing to improve the 
morals of the population. Nevertheless, the people are generally 
moral in their conduct, and regular in attending public worship. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — There are 106 holdings of land in the parish di- 
rect from the proprietors; but of these more than a half are under 
forty acres ; some of them not exceeding four or five. The re- 
mainder are divided into farms, extending from 100 to 400 acres 
of arable land, the greater part of which are enclosed with dikes of 
reddish sandstone. The soil is so various that the produce may 
be calculated at from three to four times as many bolls per Scot- 
tish acre. 

Rent of Land. — The maximum of rent is about L. 3, 10s. per 
Scottish acre. 

Husbandry. — Alternate husbandry is universal. The rotation 
varies from four to seven years; and small slight two-horse ploughs, 
some of them of iron, and more of them of wood, are exclusively 
used. On almost every farm, and indeed on several pendicles, the 
gram is separated from the straw by mills driven by water or horse. 
The offices and farm-houses are constructed of stone and lime, and 
covered with slate, and all of them are comfortable and commo- 
dious. 

The hills or lower part of the Grampians, comprehending up- 
wards of two-thirds of the surface of the parish, are pastured by 
about 2400 sheep, which, when lambs, were brought from Lin- 
ton at nearly double the price which they would have cost four 
years ago. During the two or three years they are kept, they yield 



202 



FORFARSIIIIIE. 



from two to three pounds per fleece of very indifferent wool yearly. 
The carcases, when fattened on the hill, as they sometimes are, 
weigh from eight to ten pounds per quarter of well-flavoured mut- 
ton. But the far greater part, when rising three or four years old, 
are sold in October, to be fed off with turnips,— when they in- 
crease generally to about fifteen per cent, both in weight and value. 

Cattle and Horses.— Many black-cattle are raised, and when ris- 
ing three years old are stall-fed to the weight of from thirty to 
sixty stones of excellent beef, much of which is sent to Glasgow 
or London. The breed of horses is good, and few are used of an 
inferior description. 

Spinning Mills, -c— There are two spinning, and twice as 
many plash-mills,— the former of which may each throw off from 
1300 or 1400 spindles weekly. No flax produced in this parish 
is spun at the mills, which are supplied from Dundee and Montrose. 
Much yarn is brought from the same places to be cleaned, where 
water and water-power are abundant; and opportunities are not 
wanting in Forfar and Kirriemuir of converting the yarn mto 
cloth, in which form it is returned to the ports already mentioned. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication.— -Oi the great thoroughfare by Dun- 
dee to the north, there are about three miles in this parish, viz. 
from the bridge over the Esk at Finhaven, to that over the No- 
ran at Nether Careston. This piece of turnpike, on which there 
is a toll-bar, is both nearly straight and level, and is easily kept 
in excellent order. There are two principal lines in the parish 
that lead to this turnpike; these, from the great number of very 
heavy loaded carriages daily, almost hourly, traversing them with 
coals, grain, flax, yarn, &amp;c. are expensively kept up, and are now m 
indifferent repair. The other lines of road are numerous and long, 
and are barely passable in winter. There are four stone bridges 
over the Esk,— one of them with an arch of 105 feet span, being 
wholly, and the other three partially, in this parish. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The Archbishop of St Andrews had been 
in use to let the teinds ; and the tacksmen levied the ipsa corpora. 
St Mary's College having become titulars, continued the former 
practice of uplifting the teind till the year 1718, when the whole 
annual value of the parish was, upon oath, ascertained to be 
15,000 merks Scots, of which a fifth, or 3000 merks, became 
teind; of this, the College allowed a third to the officiating resi- 
dent clergyman : of the remaining two-thirds, they were finally 



TANNADICE. 203 



relieved, by a decreet of augmentation obtained thirty years ago. 
Still the living is very inadequate to the charge. The glebe, ex- 
clusive of garden, &amp;c. consists of eight Scotch acres, and if valued 
at the same rate as a few additional acres which the incumbent 
rents, would be worth L. 28 Sterling. The church has had a choir 
and an oriel window, — indications of a Roman Catholic origin. 
It is in a tolerable state of repair, but otherwise very inconvenient 
and uncomfortable. The manse was built in 1797, and has since 
received an addition, and, as a whole, is substantial, comfortable, 
and most delightfully situated. The other accommodations are 
of later erection than the manse, and are spacious and substantial. 

The parish church, which is but indifferently seated, may 
contain 650 persons. The communicants are about 570, besides 
about 100 who annually communicate at Cortachy ; in all, nearly 
700. Three of the heritors are of the Episcopalian persuasion, 
and two are Presbyterians. There are three women and one man 
who attend the Secession. An Episcopalian minister officiated in 
the parish church till the year 1716; but, being favourable to the 
rebellion, he was dismissed, and his son was hanged. The people 
then elected and got a Presbyterian minister ordained and admit- 
ted; but in the course of six years he became so unpopular, and 
was so grossly slandered, as to be deposed ; but upon a review of 
the sentence, it was found so iniquitous that it was cancelled in a 
few years ; yet the poor man had neither opportunity nor encou- 
ragement to exercise his restored privileges, as another had in the 
meantime been installed in his place. Nor did the latter long en- 
joy his situation. On his death, St Mary's College wished to fill 
up the vacancy, but the person they recommended being rejected, 
another was popularly elected. At next vacancy the patrons exer- 
 cised then- right, and after going more than once the round of all 
the church courts, made it good. If the three former incumben- 
cies were stormy, this was a hurricane, terminated only by death, the 
• settler of all controversies, and leaving a large debt for law expenses. 

Jducatton.~The parochial schoolmaster has an excellent dwell- 
ing-house, and teaching-room apart,— both beautifully situated. 
; His accommodations are good, and his salary the maximum. 
1 1 here are other three male teachers in the parish,-one of whom 
 depends nearly altogether upon school-fees; but besides fees, the 
otner two have teaching-rooms, dwelling-houses, and gardens, free.

of these, one has a beautiful cottage, and well kept garden, some 
bolls of meal yearly, and a supply of milk daily, all from the gene- 
rosity of Lady Airly. The reading of Enghsh, the various uses oi 
the needle, French, and music, are taught in this female seminary, . 
where boarders are kept. The two first branches only are taught  
in the other schools, and the mistresses have no sources of support | 
except the fees. About 200 children receive instruction in the A 
elementary and higher branches of education. There are also two 
Sabbath schools, one of them taught gratuitously by some mem- 
bers of the minister's family, and other well-disposed mdividuals. 

All persons in the parish above seven years of age can read, and 
there are but very few who have not made some additional hte- 

rary attainments. . 

Libraries.— We have two parochial libraries, viz. one in the vil- 
lage kept by the parochial schoolmaster; the other in Glen Ogle, 
kept by the schoolmaster in that district. The latter consists prin- 
cipally of moral and religious books and tracts, with a few historical 
works ; the former consists of all these, with not a few fictitious 
compositions. 

Poor and Parochial izncZs.- Nearly a century ago, there ap- 
pears to have been, during several years, a parochial assessment 
for the support of the poor, which was found to be not only trouble- 
some and expensive, but also demoralizing. There being a small 
sum, or parochial fund, belonging to the poor, it was raised by 
donations and collections, until in the year 1796 it amounted to 
L 210 Sterling. This stock, though reduced by the four very se- 
vere seasons of 1799, 1800, 1816, and 1822, amounts at present 
to L.318 SterSng, bearing four per cent, interest on good security. 
The interest, with the weekly collections made in the church, mor - 
cloth money, and occasional donations, amounts m all, according to 
the annual balance-sheets of the three last years, to from L. /. to 
L 78 annually. This sum is distributed amongst four famdies and 
eio-ht individuals, whose allowances range from 2s 6d. to 10s.

not known, or not considered, as paupers.

The latter always draw out on the certain prospect of marriage; and 
the former, when any situation of independence casts up. The in- 
terest is a comfortable addition to the incomes of many. 

Fuel. — Everything capable of ignition is used as fuel, viz. whins, 
broom, brushwood, turf, peats, and coals; the last can be pur- 
chased at Montrose for Is. Id., or a little more per barrel, of 10 
stones English weight, or 160 pounds. The upper part of the 
parish, to which coals were almost inaccessible, can now be as 
easily supplied from the depot at Newtyle by the rail-road, as the 
lower from Montrose. There are thirteen taxable carriages at pre- 
sent running in the parish, some of them with four, and others with 
two wheels. Forty years ago there was not one of either descrip- 
tion. Few of the roads, indeed, were suitable for such vehicles. 
Miscellaneous Observations. 

The principal improvements within the last forty years have 
been already mentioned. It may be added, that, if we may judge 
by the longevity of many, the parish is very healthy. A few years 
ago seven men and a maiden lady died in one year, all upwards 
of eighty years of age : and last winter, a man, who had been at 
the battle of CuUoden, died at the age of 104, and another only 
twelve years younger. There are at present upwards of ten persons 
alive about eighty years of age; and three nearly ninety.

X Topography and Natural History. 

:ame —This parish appears to have derived its name from the 
Gaehc word Kinnettles, signifying " the head of the bog." The 
following circumstances probably gave rise to it. The bottom of 
the extensive vale of Strathmore, which comprehends the nor hern 
part of the parish, appears, from several iiiternal and external evi- 
dences, to have formed, at a remote period, the bed of a large river 
or lake, which, finding a pretty level passage mto a small valley 
among the Siedlaw hills, formed a kind of bay or bason,-which, 
when the water was diverted into another channel formed a bog 
or marsh : at the head of that bog, a church was built probably m 
le twelfth century,-which gave the name of Kmnettles to the pa- 

and Boundaries.-The parish is about 2 imperial miles 
in fencth, 2 in breadth, and, comprehending 3078 imperial acres 
CO tais about 4| imperial square miles.  " f, 
west by the parish of Glammis ; on the north by the Pf" s ot 
Glammis and Forfar; on the east by the parisies of Forfar and 
Inverarity ; and on the south by the parish of Inverarity Its fi- 
gure is nearly a square.

stdlaw hilk. In consequence of this oblong h.ll rrsmg nearly m th 

 r„ he Barish, the surface of the ground is generally far from

hill of Brigfon, and sometimes the hill of Kinnettles, because it is 
divided betwixt the proprietors of those two estates. This hill, 
whose form approaches to that of an ellipsis, whose flattish top 
rises about 356 feet above the level of the sea, and whose attractive 
appearance strikes the eye of every beholder, especially when 
viewed from the south, instead of disfiguring, adds considerable 
beauty to the parish. Its beauty arises chiefly from its gentle 
acclivity, from its great fertility, and from its being all arable and 
under various agricultural crops, except a very few acres on its brow, 
which, being very steep, somewhat rocky, and not easily approach- 
ed by the plough, are closely covered with various kinds of thriv- 
ing wood. The view on all sides is grand and extensive. 

Meteorology, cr. — This parish, owing to its vicinity to the German 
Ocean, and the situation, at least of nearly the one-half of it, among 
the Siedlaw hills, has an atmosphere of considerable humidity. 

Among the prognostics of weather, it may be noticed that a 
small acquaintance with physiological botany, finds in the economy 
of some plants several satisfactory indications of the state of the 
weather. Thus, the Convolvulus arvensis, Anagallis arvemis. Ca- 
lendula pluvialis, shut up their flowers against the approach of 
rain; whence the anagallis has been called the poor man's weather- 
glass There is, in the parish, a species of soft gray sandstone, 
which, when built in the wall of a dwelling-house, and not coated 
on the inside with lime or clay, indicates rain, by becoming gloomy 
and moist before rain. f &amp; j- 

This parish enjoys a variety of climate, corresponding to the variety 
of Its elevations and exposures. Those parts of it which are little 
elevated above the valleys, have a mild and genial chmate ; whereas 
those that are more elevated on the north, east, and west sides of the 
hill ot Kinnettles, and on the north side of the hill of Kincaldrum 
whose summit, and part of whose base, are situated in the parishf 
Inverarity, enjoy a purer and colder climate. But, as the highest 
grounds m the parish have only a moderate elevation above tie 
evel of the sea the climate is, on the whole, justly entitl d 
he character of good and salubrious. It was not so, however 
wt'thrin T" \ considerable portion of the parish

German Ocean, and with the hoar-frosts to which the lower parts 
of the parish are more exposed than the higher, is remarkably pure 
and healthful. In proof of this, we have no diseases that can be 
said to be local. Agues, which were prevalent before drainage 
commenced, are now unknown; fevers of every kind occasionally 
make their appearance, yet they are not epidemical. Consump- I 
tion, scrofula, hooping-cough, croup, measles, inflammation, and 
typhus fever, may be said to be our most prevalent diseases. 

Hydrography.-T\.s parish is generally well supphed with water 
by means of the numerous springs in which it abounds. Ihese 
springs are partly perennial, and partly periodical. The perennial 
springs appear all to flow from sandstone rocks, and probably from 
the rocks composing the basis of the southern range of the Siedlaw 
hills Their water is pure and soft. Their temperature generally 
corresponds to that of the atmosphere; and they have no peculia- 
rities worthy of remark. There is one perennial spring, however, 
at the Kirktown, that justly deserves observation, not so much 
on account of the quality of its water, which is excellent, as on 
account of the quantity which it discharges. To convey some 
idea of its uncommon strength, it was found, on pretty accurate 
measurement, to discharge no less a quantity than 25 imperial gal- 
lons per minute, 1500 per hour, and 36,000 per day. In some 
parts of the parish, particularly the more elevated, there are a few 
periodical springs, which flow during winter and spring, and then 
cease to flow till the return of winter. Their water is, compara- 
lively, much inferior in quahty to that of the perenmal sprmgs. 
Being chiefly the offspring of surface-water imbibed by the earth 
it is impure, hard, and strongly impregnated with the properties o 
the media through which it is conveyed. Besides the wo kinds 
of springs already mentioned, there are several mmeral springs, 
generally distinguished by the name of chalybeate, because they 
Ltain a portion of iron in solution Their waters are exceed- 
in.ly hard, unpleasant, and ill adapted for washing and bleaching 
clothes, and for culinary purposes. There are  - be 
mineral springs from copper ore, the waters of which thougl e 
hibiting a ghstening surface, are extremely impure, of an often.ne 

smell, and a disagreeable taste. hpontifuUv

Dean, then with the Isla, and finally with the Tay; and after fol- 
lowing- a most circujtous and somewhat elliptical course of seventy- 
two miles, it falls into the German Ocean, about ten miles to the 
southward of its source. It is a gentle flowing stream, about 20 feet 
in breadth, 2 feet in depth, and flows with a velocity of one mile per 
sixty-six minutes. It drives a multitude of mills, abounds in large and 
excellent trout, and affords much sport to anglers, with whom its 
winding banks are sometimes thickly planted, during the spi'ing and 
summer months. It is naturally pacific : but after a great fall of 
rain, or an effectual thaw of a winter storm, when the melted snow 
and ice run down in torrents from the hills, it swells to an almost 
incredible extent, and lays hundreds of acres of arable and meadow 
ground under water. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The rocks, which enter into the com- 
position of the hill and of the inclined planes of the parish, are 
whinstone, sandstone, and slate. The whinstone rock makes its 
appearance under the varieties of pure whinstone, trap, and basalt, 
in three distinct parts of the parish. But although it thus appears 
in a detached state, it is in all probability related to the Siedlaw 
range, where a zone of whinstone strata seems to be formed, run- 
ning, with occasional interruptions, from S. W. to N. E. Its ex- 
tent is considerable, particularly in the hill of Kinnettles, where it 
shows itself almost uninterruptedly from the one end of the hill 
to the other, whose length is not less than three-fourths of a mile. 
Although its depth is very considerable, varying from 40 to 100 
feet, yet the thickness of its strata is not great. In consequence 
of Its numerous intersections, the blocks of which it is composed 
are generally small, and very irregular. The three varieties of this 
rock are worked in the parish. Two of these, situated in the north- 
ern district, furnish stones of a dark blue colour; and the third 
situated in the southern district, furnishes stones of a paler colour 
on the fracture, and externally muddy, resembling the colour of a 
toad. In all the three the rock is very difficult to work, and the 
stones which they furnish, being extremely hard in their texture, 
ot small size, and irregular in their shape, are useful only as road- 
metal, and for filling drains. The sandstone or freestone rock. 
Whose colour is partly gray and partly tinged with red, is very con- 
siderable in Its extent. It not only forms the base of the hill which 
ises in the centre of the parish, but traces, at a certain depth, its 
unbrok rangeof freestoncwhich per- 

vade, the whole chain of the Siedlaw hills. This rock is stratified to 



210 FORFARSHIRE. 



the very surface, has four strata of puddingstone regularly mtersper- 
sed among the strata, and detached yolks imbedded m the pure 
strata. It furnishes stones of very large dimensions. Its strata 
towards the surface are thin, but, thickening downwards, they be- 
come so massy that they cannot be raised without the assistance of 
gunpowder. The slate-rock, which is a species of fine gray sand- 
Lne, and the only rock of the kind yet discovered and opened in 
L parish, does not appear to be very extensive It . situad on 
the north bank of the rivulet, and appears to form pait of that 
slaty range which extends, with several interruptions from riie 
commencement to the termination of the Siedlaw hills. It f u - 
nishes slates, but particularly flags, of good quality, of considerable 

size, and of a dark gray colour. . . f i.u. 

From a minute examination of the component parts of our globe, 
geologists and mineralogists have been led to conclude, that its 
structure has been formed by the junction of various formations. 
In support of this conclusion, all the rocks in this parish discover 
eviderit marks of stratification and seams of distinct _ concretions. 
The strata and beds of the whinstone rocks have a direction from 
E to W., an inclination of 7° 12' to the W., and a dip of 9 45 
to' the N The strata and beds of the sandstone rock have a di- 
rection from E. to W. nearly, an inclination of 1 1° 45' to the S W., 
and a dip of 15° 30' to the N. W. The strata and beds o the 
slate-rock have a direction from E. to W., an mclination of 15 28 
to the W., and a dip of 18° 10' to the N. W. In the three spe- 
cies of rock which have just been described, numerous veins are qmte 
discernible. They frequently cut across the strata, and occasion- 
ally derange their structure. But while tlejeins, which cut the 
whinstone strata in all directions, are generally filled wi h a ferru- 
ginous cement, those which ramify in the freestone and slate strata 
are generally filled with clay, and sometimeswith camstone,-which 
'applies more particularly to the veins of the slaty strata. 

In the different species of rock already mentioned, various ores 
are to be found. The sandstone contains copper imbedded, and 
lead disseminated in veins; but the quantity is so small, that it 
would not pay the expense of extraction. The whmstone, parU- 
cularly that species of it called basalt, abounds m manganese, dis- 
seminated in veins, but is not worth working. 

The freestone rocks contain various minerals,-such as garnet, 
mica, calc-spar, quartz, lime-spar. 

The solid rocks of whinstone, sandstone, and slate, which com

pose the interior parts of the area of the parish, are covered, al- 
most universally, with a coating of various materials, which con- 
ceals them, with a very few exceptions of basalt, from our view. 
That coating, whether thick or thin, as it varies from one foot to 
six feet, is composed of alluvial deposits, generally imposed in 
layers. The lowermost layer generally consists of reddish sand 
or gravel ; and the uppermost is composed sometimes of sandy 
loam, and sometimes of loam mixed with clay. 

Soil. — To the agriculturist, variety of soil, corresponding to the 
variety of crop which he grows, must be extremely useful. Accord- 
ingly, this parish fortunately enjoys the various soils which are 
suited to the purposes not only of the agriculturist, but also of the 
horticulturist, the botanist, the florist, and the nurseryman. These 
soils are the clayey, loamy, sandy, gravelly, and mossy. However 
diversified may be the strata of the subsoil, they all, with the ex- 
ception of the mossy, appear to rest, at various depths, on sand- 
stone or freestone. Their adjunctsand concomitants may be stated 
as follows : — 

Snik Extent in Varying depth  ,  , 

imp. acres. in inches. Wetness or dryness. Productiveness. 



Clayey, 434 From 12 to 36 Dampish. Most productive. 

Loamy, 1881 10 to 18 Moderately dry. Nearly as productive. 

 \ Iqo '■y- Less productive. 

Gravelly, 339 6 to 3 Generally dry. Still less productive. 

Mossy, 172 14 to 48 Wettish. Least productive. 

From the stratifications discernible in all these soils, it appears 
highly probable that they have been transported. That this has 
been the case with regard to the sandy, gravelly, and mossy soils 
m particular, must be obvious to every intelligent geologist. In 
former times, when the superficial area of the parish presented 
one contmuous field, without dike or ditch, and when it was par- 
tially cultivated by a great number of small tenants, who tilled 
their parcels in alternate ridges, depositing all the stones which 
they collected on the cultivated ridge, on the intermediate uncul- 
tivated one, boulders prevailed to a great extent in the several 
soils ; but, as soon as the spirit of cultivation began to operate 
with new energy, and on a more extended and efficient plan, many 
ot the most manageable of these boulders were either blasted with 
gunpowder and carted away, or trailed off the ground by means of a 
strong sledge, drawn by oxen and horses. And, now that agriculture 
nas reached a degree of perfection unknown to our forefathers, few 
comparatively, of these stones are to be seen on the surface of the 



212

ground. A few of tliem, indeed, are still to be met with m the 
p-round; but when they are found, they are either blasted, or sunk 
into the earth beyond the reach of the plougl. Being frequently 
of great magnitude, some of them of two or three tons weight, the 
removing of them was often a task of Herculean labour. As some 
of them are granites, some mica-schists, some porphyries, and some 
globular masses of quartz or silicious spar, they appear to demon 
Late that they are not natives of the place,-and that, by means 
of attrition, they have been rounded and diminished in size, in pro- 
portion to the distance they have travelled.

Although several springs in the parish strongly mdioate the 
presence of iron and copper ores, there is not a mine of any de- 
Liption worked. In an inclined plane, on the north-west base

seventy years ago, the supposition became generally so stiong, that

fake their departure about the end of September. The heron, 
however, is frequently to be seen in winter on the banks of the 
Kerbit. 

In regard to their live-stock in general, the farmers in this pa- 
rish, though generally more disposed to graze and feed than to 
breed and rear, are equalled by few, and surpassed by none in the 
county. Whether they breed and rear, which they do to a con- 
siderable extent, or whether they purchase to supply the deficiency, 
which they often do, but always with the greatest care, they gene- 
rally make a point of keeping a live-stock of superior quality, 
large size, and great value; and thus, since the introduction of en- 
closures, turnips, potatoes, and sown grasses, there has been a re- 
markable improvement of every species of live-stock. The cattle, 
formerly of small, are now of large size ; and when well fed on 
turnips, potatoes, or grass,— a practice extensively followed in the 
parish,— they are much esteemed in the Edinburgh and Glasgow 
markets, where they bring high prices. Nor are the farmers less 
conspicuous for the superior stock of horses which they keep. 
Whether they breed find rear their own horses, which they gene- 
rally do in a great measure, or whether they make purchases from 
the south and west country dealers to make up the deficiency of 
rearing, which they occasionally do, but with the utmost caution 
and nicest selection, they never fail to keep up a choice stock. 
The case was different in former times. When roads were bad, 
and when most carriages were performed on horseback, and when 
the plough and wain were drawn chiefly by oxen, the breed of 
horses was comparatively small. But the native breed has been 
improved, both in size and shape, in proportion as they have been 
regularly worked well fed, and amply provided with winter pro- 
vender. To such perfection have they been brought, that a pair 
are now sufficient for the cart or plough; and, in d awing the'e 
rniplements, they perform more work, and to better purpofe, in a 
g ven time than six oxen, preceded by two horses, did in the days 
of our fathers; and in such estimation are the horses that have

tapering snout. They feed to eighteen or twenty stones, mipenal 
weiaht, and, when well fed, make excellent pork; but the small 
Chinese breed abounds most, and feeds from eight to ten stones, 
imperial weight. Those who keep a stock of hogs generally keep 
them in good condition, and feed them highly. 

Every species of corn grown in the parish is less or more ex- 
posed to the depredations of insects. Wheat suffers from slugs; 
but the greatest eneny that has yet assailed it, is a fly that was 
introduced in 1826, and that made its appearance m 1827. ihis 
insect inserts into the ear its ova, which, soon becoming small 
worms injure it very much. In consequence of the rapid and ex- 
tensive depredations of this insect, wheat has been almost banished 
from the parish for the last six years. Fortunately, however, the 
last crop has suffered but little from its ravages, and hopes are en- 
tertained that it will soon disappear from this quarter. 

11. — Civil History. 
The ancient history of this parish appears to be involved in great 
obscurity Although the old church and tower, which stood in the 
present churchyard, and which were taken down in 1812, exhi- 
bited strong presumptive evidence of their having been erected in 
the twelfth century, yet no authentic account of the parish can be 
traced beyond the era of the Reformation. At that period, and 
for about 200 years after, its extent was much less than it is at 
present; then, the Bishop of Dunkeld was proprietor of about 
200 Scotch acres of land, which, though locally situated in the 
parish of Caputh, lay conterminous with the southern extrem.tjof 
the parish, and were held on lease by a tenant called Alexander 
Pvott From his principles and practices, Pyott appears to have 
been a discerning, selfish, staunch, papist. Alarmed at the pro- 
gress of the Reformation, he repaired to Dunkeld, in order to hold 
an interview with his bishop concerning the state of public affairs. 
The bishop received him most cordially : and on Pyott's assuring 
him that he would strain every nerve to resist the progress of the 
Reformation, he immediately wrote out a disposition of the said 
lands in Pyott's favour. On receiving this document, Pyott, exult- 
ing at the success of his visit, returned home with his new acquisi- 
tion; and, without loss of time, he repaired to his holiness at Rome, 
and got the deed of conveyance confirmed by a Popish bul ,--m 
Virtue' of which it is held at the present day. The last Popish p. "

Eminent Men. — Only two eminent men seem to have been con- 
nected with this parish for the last 100 years. The first is Colonel 
William Patterson, son of a gardener to Mr Douglas of Brig- 
ton, about the middle of the last century. Honoured with the 
patronage of Lady Mary Lyon of Glammis, he rose to the dignified 
station which he filled during the greatest part of his remarkably 
diversified life. He was connected with the parish by birth, as well 
as by residence in his early years.  

The other eminent character alluded to is John Inglis Harvey, 
Esq. of Kinnettles. He was born and resided in this parish till 
he attained the age of sixteen years. After receiving a classical 
education in his father's house, he was sent to one of the English 
universities, where he was instructed in general literature and 
science, but in the law department in particular, and where he car- 
ried several prizes. Having thus qualified himself for some con- 
spicuous station, he, about twelve years ago, obtained an appoint- 
ment to a very honourable and distinguished office in the East In- 
dies ; and afterwards ascended the bench as a civil judge in that 
country. 

Land-owners. — The land-owners in the parish are, the Earl of 
Strathmore ; Robert Douglas, Esq. of Brigton ; John Inglis Har- 
vey, Esq. of Kinnettles; Captain John Lauren son of Invereighty ; 
and Mr John Wighton of Muiryknows.

volumes of old parochial registers, comprising entries of the pro- 
clamation of the banns of marriage, baptisms, deaths, discipline, 
collections, and disbursements. These entries, however, are ex- 
ceedino-ly irregular, intermixed, and imperfect; and marriages, 
births,''and burials, are entirely omitted; but in 1806 the mode of 
entry was altered, and a new arrangement adopted. A new set of 
registers, six in number, neatly bound and titled, were mtroduced 
in 1820. Vol. 1. contains an entry of the proclamation of the banns 
of marriage, and of the marriage itself; vol. 2. births and baptisms; 
vol. 3. deaths and burials; vol 4. income; vol. 5. expenditure; 
vol. 6. discipline. All the volumes, twelve in number, mcluding 
old and new, are carefully and regularly kept. 

Antiquities, §-c.— In the churchyard are to be found some tomb- 
stones of considerable antiquity. One is distinctly dated 1626, 
another 1630. A few, from the quahty of the stone, the form 
of the letters, and the strange figures engraven on them, ap- 
pear to be somewhat older ; but the inscriptions which they bear 
are nearly eflfaced. There are also a few stones exhibiting un- 
known characters, apparently very old: and there are two other mo- 
numents, somewhat of a colossal kind, designed with much taste, 
and executed in a masterly style. But of all the sepulchral mo- 
numents, those erected in 1814, by and for the famihes of Brig- 
ton, Kinnettles, and Invereighty, are by far the largest, and 
the most substantial.-Not many yards distant from the south 
bank of the rivulet, stands a rising ground, somewhat conically 
shaped, which, from its having been, time immemorial, called 
Kirkhill, is generally supposed to have been at some remote 
period the site of a religious house.-After the l-- 
was filled with Protestants, the proprietor of Foffarty, aided by 
the Papists in the neighbourhood, set about building a popish 
chapel on his property, and appointed a priest to conduct the 
Romish service, to whom he gave a manse, offices, gaiden, 
debe and salary. That chapel was erected on the margin ot 
fden at the foot of Kincaldrum hill. It was burnt by a par- 
ty of royal dragoons in 1745, and remained roofless and iinous 
r man'y years' The area of the building .id a « " 

tion of the walls, were distinctly visible so late as 1816. Then the 
rls we dug up from the very foundation, and earned a..y 
fiU UTD drains Mr Bower of Kincaldrum, a Roman Catholic, to 
gethe'r wTthe male part of his family, removed the stone whicl 
held the holy water, as a precious relict, to his own premises, where

it is Still to be seen. The glebe, which belonged to the priest, 
and which consisted of four Scotch acres, lay at no great distance 
from the chapel. It remained for many years unclaimed by any 
person, after the chapel had been burnt and deserted. Even after 
the Earl of Strathmore had purchased the lands of FolFarty, he 
did not venture, for a considerable time, to break ground upon it, 
although it lay a kind of waste in the midst of his cultivated fields. 
At last, however, he did take possession of it, and bring it into cul- 
tivation. But as it was locally situated, with the other lands of 
Foffarty, in the parish of Caputh, the present minister of that pa- 
rish advanced his claim to it, once and again, between twenty and 
thirty years ago ; but lost it in the Court from the want of a charter, 
and from the want of occupancy. The whole lands of Foffarty 
being church lands, pay no minister's stipend, but hold cum deci- 
mis inclusis. But although the chapel above described had been 
long burnt and deserted, the late Mr Bower of Kincaldrum did 
not renounce, but stedfastly adhered to, the Roman Catholic reli- 
gion : and he converted one of the rooms in the old mansion- 
house of Kinnettles of which he was then proprietor into a cha- 
pel, — erecting an altar in it, and employing the Catholic priest of 
Dundee to officiate at stated times, when he himself, his family, 
and a few scattered Papists in the neighbourhood, attended wor- 
ship, and celebrated mass. — In 1833, one of the ploughs in a grass- 
field, dug up in a pretty entire state of preservation, what an anti- 
quarian would be disposed to consider a great curiosity in this part 
of the kingdom, an " upper millstone of a hand-mill." It is 25 
inches in diameter, 1 inch thick, nearly quite circular, neatly 
hewn with the chisel, and displays the nicest workmanship around 
the small circular opening in the centre. The stone of which it 
is composed is mica-schist, has a leaden colour, contains a mixture 
of silicious spar, and is thickly studded with small garnets. It is 
probably of great antiquity. The mortar appears to have been 
the earliest mstrument that was used in combination with the pes- 
tle, for grinding corn. But as this proces was very laborious, at- 
tended with little execution, and productive of the coarsest manu- 
iacture, it was probably soon superseded by the invention of the 
mola manuaria, or hand-mill, which was for ages worked by bond- 
men and bondwomen. As this mill was more effective, and fur- 
nished meal of better quality than that produced by the mortar

and the pestle, it was probably invented in the earliest ages. But, 
being originally imperfect and susceptible of improvement, it was 
gradually improved as the sphere of mechanical knowledge was 
enlarged. With a view to abridge maimal labour, it came in pro- 
cess of time to be so constructed as to be worked by oxen and 
horses. This improved form of it appears to have existed at an 
early period ; for we find that moU jumentariB were employed trom 
the very origin of the Roman republic. And as Strabo, Vitruvius, 
and Palladius inform us, that water-mills were introduced m the 
reiffn of Julius Csesar, hand-mills were probably laid aside about 
the bea-inning of the Christian era ; and, of course, the millstone 
above described, may be 1600 or 2000 years old. 

Modern huildmgs.-Uoi of the buildings in the parish are of 
modern erection. The church was built in 1812, of stone and hme, 
and roofed with blue slate. With the exception of the old man- 
sion-house of Kinnettles, a part of the large mansion-house of Brig- 
ton, the mansion-house of one of the farmers of Inghston the man- 
sion-house and mill of Invereighty, and the mill of Kinnettles, 
which was greatly enlarged and repaired in 1830,-all the man 
sion-houses in the parish have been built within these fif y years. 
While those mansion-houses which were built upwards of fifty years 
ao-o are generally built of stone and clay, and covered partly with 
gay slates and partly with thatch; those that have been built since 
L generally of stone and lime, and covered partly with gray 
slates and partly with blue. But the mansion-houses of all the 
;t;r;e rs and of some of the farmers are covered with blue s ates. 
The large and spacious spinning-mill at Douglastown four stories 
gh, and of proportionate length and breadth, was built of stone 
and lime towards the end of the last century, and covered with 
blue slate.

Customs, Character of the People.— The dress of the people if 
not the same as that of the English, must be allowed to be a very 
close imitation ofit; and no class is so poor as not to have an abun- 
dance of plam, wholesome food. The people generally live in 
commodious houses, follow agreeable occupations, enjoy a compe- 
tency of the means of subsistence, live on friendly terms, and main- 
tain a reciprocal exchange of good offices. They bear generally 
a fair moral character; nor are they inattentive to the duties 
of religion. The best proofs which they can give of the esti- 
mation m which they hold the Bible, and the character wh h 
It IS calculated to form, are, their acquaintance with the Holy 
bcnptures, their observance of the Sabbath, their celebration of 
the seahng ordmances of the Gospel, and their earnest end a'our 
to conform their temper and conduct to the example of Christ 
roaching m game, and purchasing contraband spirits from 'the

This parish affords but little scope for the husbandry of 
sheep. About 320, however, are generally kept throughout the 
year by gentlemen and farmers, who keep them partly for do- 
mestic purposes, but chiefly for enriching their fields. The kinds 
kept are various. The proprietors of the parish usually keep 
m their lawns a small mixed flock of the Linton, South Down, 
and Mermo breeds, which in summer are subsisted on grass 
and in winter, partly on grass, and partly on turnips, hay, and 
straw; and from the excellent shelter afforded them, they thrive 
uncommonly well, and are generally very productive. Some 
of the farmers keeping sheep, particularly in winter, more for 

market than for family use, generally keep the LiLton, Che- 
ot and Leicester breeds. In summer, such as keep them, 
graze them in their enclosures; and in winter, when the great

to let it lie in the ploughed state till the swardy furrows have rot- 
ted, next to cross plough it, and then to finish the process by break- 
ing and pulverizing it by the action of the harrow. — Irrigation, 
which in many cases meliorates the soil, is not attempted in the 
parish, because there is not a sufficiency of water convenient for 
the purpose, and because, though there were a sufficiency, the wa- 
ter, owing to the intersected state of the fields by covered drains, 
would not extend, as was found by experiment in 1826, but sink 
down into the first intersection. — The only specimens of embank- 
ing in the parish are those raised on the banks of the Kerbit, to 
protect the adjacent flat fields from the violence of its destructive 
inundations ; and they have the desired effect. 

In former times, when the land in the parish was far behind in 
cultivation, and when it required a considerable outlay on the part 
of the occupant to bring it into a proper productive state, the pro- 
prietors were accustomed to grant long-leases, generally thirty-nine 
years, with the lifetime of the occupant after the years specified in 
his lease had expired. But as soon as the cultivation of their pro- 
perties had attained to a considerable degree of perfection, they, from 
a desire of regulating the progressive rise of rent by the progres- 
sive improvement of the times, abandoned this system of leases, 
first, by lopping off the lifetime period after the stipulated number 
of years, and then by abridging the length of the lease to twenty-one 
years. At the last general letting in the parish, the period was re- 
duced to nmeteen years, which is now the duration of almost every 
lease m the parish, there being no liferenter in it since 1831. 

The complaint brought by many farmers in other districts of the 
county, agamst the backwardness of their landlords in aff-ording 
them the necessary accommodations in respect of dwelling-houses 
and steadings, cannot with propriety be brought against the pro- 
prietors of this parish. On all their farms, exceeding ten imperial 
acres commodious and substantial dwelling-houses and steadings 
have been ei-ected. But although all the farm-steadings may be 
hus reported to be in a good state of repair, the same Lourable 
report cannot be made of the farm-enclosures. The great bulk of 
he parish, indeed, is well enclosed with substantial stone-dikes;

support to those engaged in them, may be ascertained from the 
following statement : — The average rate of weaving a web of osna- 
burgs, 150 yards long, 8s.,- of hessians, 124 yards long, 8s. ;"of 
bleached sheetings, 110 yards long, I4s. ; of brown sheetings, 104 
yards long, lis. Thus it appears, that, when provisions are mode- 
rate in price, the manufacturer, by receiving 2s. 9d. per day for his 
highest manufacture, which he weaves in five days, and is. 7d. for 
the lowest, is comparatively pretty well remunerated for his labour ; 
and, since the males employed in the said spinning-mill receive 
each on an average 2s. 3d. per day, and the females 4s. 6d. per 
week, they are enabled to live in a tolerably comfortable state. 

' Mill-spinning and weaving, from the long daily confinement at- 
tending them, the imperfect ventilation of manufacturing houses, 

and noxious flaxen dust inhaled into the lungs in respiration, 

seldom fail to produce bad effects on the constitution ; disposing 
those that are exposed to them to assume prematurely the pale 
emaciated countenance, and to contract asthmatical and dropsical 
diseases, which not unfrequently adhere to them through life. 
Spinning-mills and manufacturing shops, in which many young of 
both sexes are frequently blended together, have, at the same time, 
not always the best effect on the morals of youth.

■ Market-Town.~.T\ie nearest market-town is Glammis, where 
three cattle and sheep-markets are periodically held in the course 
of the year. At Forfar, the county-town, distant about three miles 
seven or eight markets are periodically held during the year, for 
cattle, horses and sheep. Besides, a cattle-market, commonly called 
the crafts,,, held on every Wednesday from Martinmas to the mid-

Villaffcs.-There are two villages in the parish. Douglastown 
so called from the late Mr Douglas of BrigtL, was erected by tS 
gentleman and his partners, at a great expense, in 1792, chiefl'y fo 
the accommodation of the hands employed at the sp nninc-n, 1,

Means of Communication.-The means of communication en- 
ioved by the parish are various. 1. Although it has no post-office, 
yet letters, nevvspapers, and parcels are regularly brought to and car- 
ried from the inn at. Douglastown by the post, vhlch runs dady be- 
twixt Forfar and Glammis. 2. The Strathmore turnpike-road 
passes, upwards of two miles, nearly through the centre of the parish; 
and the turnpike-road betwixt Dundee and Forfar passes nearly 
a mile, through the eastern parts of the parish. 3. The Defiance 
coach, which runs between Edinburgh and Aberdeen, travels every 
lawful day on the Strathmore turnpike-road, and also the Glasgow 
carrier once a-week; and on the turnpike-road betwixt Dundee 
and Forfar, travel, every lawful day, the Union and Sir Henj 
Parnell coaches, betwixt Edinburgh and Aberdeen via Fife; be- 
sides other pubhc carriages betwixt Dundee and Forfar on stated 
days of the week. 4. There are, in different parts of the parish 
five arched and parapeted bridges, built with stone and lime and 
one chain-bridge across the Kerbit at the Kirktown. The hand- 
some stone bridge across the Kerbit at Douglastown, and consist- 
ing of three arches, was erected in 1770 : two of one arch each, 
and two consisting of two arches each, across the Spittle-burn, were 
built neatly and substantially towards the end of the last century. 
These bridges are in good condition.-The fences, partly thorn- 
hedges, but chiefly dry-stone dikes, are generally in good con- 

lesiasticaJ State.-O.ing to the'hill of Brigton and Kinnettles 
rising nearly in the centre of the parish, it was judged by our fore- 
fathfrs to i inexpedient to build the vfffJ 
place; but, although it stands at the south-west side of the hiU, and 
c nsequen tly nearo the western extremity of the parish, it is no 
nconenieiJfor any part of the population, being nearlyce 
between the northern and southern extremities of the paih and 
not exceeding two miles from the remotest cornei, while that d s- 
tance is considerably diminished by means of a kirk-road along the 

CcWh was built in 1812, solely at the expense of the heri- 
tors, the parishioners contributing not so much as a single carriage 
Towlrds iJs erection. From its havmg been - recently buiU, a_ 
that, too, in a neat, commodious, and substantial style, it i at pie 
sent in a state of tolerably good repair. 

The church, galleried upon the principles o ein a antec 
ture, affords accommodation for 420 sitters. The free sitting, are, 



KINNETTLES. 



227 



the front seat of all the galleries, accommodating thirty-six sitters, 
and reserved by the heritors for themselves and their families ; one 
seat, on the ground floor, for the minister's family, accommodating 
six sitters ; and one seat, also on the groimd floor, for the elders, 
accommodating six sitters. All the other seats are let annually at 
2s. per sitter. The communion-table, which is neat and commo- 
dious, extends, with the exception of the east and west passages, 
the whole length of the church, and accommodates fifty communi- 
cants at each service. 

The manse was built in 1801 ; repaired in 1807 and 1811 ; and, 
owing to its small size and superficial workmanship, cannot be said 
to be in a good state of repair at present. But, from the disposi- 
tion of the heritors to grant comfortable accommodation, hopes are 
entertained of its being enlarged and repaired in the course of the 
season. 

The glebe contains 8 J imperial acres, and is now all arable. Its 
annual value is not easily ascertained. Consisting of various kinds 
of soil, and containing two acres of poor gravel, it cannot be esti- 
mated at more than L. 12, 15s. per annum, which is at the rate 
of L, 1, 10s. per acre. Hence the glebe, though an accommoda- 
tion, is by no means a profit to the incumbent. 

As the teinds of the parish were at different periods all valued 
in money at a very low rate, they fell short of the minimum stipend 
by L. 30, Is. yearly ; but the deficiency is made up by the Govern- 
ment bounty. 

The number of families attending the Established church is 102: 
the number of persons of all ages attending the Established church,' 
o30 ; the number attending the chapels of Dissenters and Sece- 
ders, 2; of Episcopalians, 16. Divine service at the Established 
church IS generally well attended. The average number of com- 
municants at the Established church, 240. The average amount of 

f oo '"o'""' '"" charitable objects, 

Li. 22, 7s. od. 

Education.-Theve are two schools in the parish, the parochial 
and a sewing school. The branches of instruction taught in the 
parochial school are, English reading, writing, arithmetic, book- 
Keeping, the elements of algebra and mathematics, English 
grammar, geography, Latin, and French. The branches taught 

ot needle and fancy work. The salary of the schoolmaster i. 



228 



FORFARSHIRE. 



L. 34, 4s. 4id. As the school is always well attended, the school- 
fees amount, on an average, to L. 50 a-year, which, with the salary 
and perquisites, realize an income of about L. 84, 4s. 4-d. per an- 
num, and, of course, afford a pretty fair remimeration for the ar- 
duous labour of teaching a parochial school. The income of the 
schoolmistress, however, is disproportionate. She has, indeed, a 
free house and garden, but no salary. With the exception of her 
house and garden, which she holds by grant from the benevolent 
family of Kinnettles, she is left entirely to depend on her preca- 
rious school-fees. But, by her attention and accomplishments, 
she has hitherto been enabled to earn a tolerably comfortable live- 
lihood. . 

The parochial teacher has the legal accommodations. He has 
a well-finished two-story dwelhng-house, an excellent school-room, 
and two bolls of "oatmeal in lieu of a garden. 

The four rates of school-fees, fixed about thirty years ago by 
the competent judges, are, per quarter, 2s. 6d. for beginners; 3s. 
for reading and writing; 4s. for arithmetic ; and 5s. for the learned 
languages ; but, as teachers in general have the practice of mul- 
tiplying books in the hands of their scholars, the quarter fees sel- 
dom amount to much more than one-half of the total expense of 
education per quarter. 

All young persons in the parish betwixt six and fifteen years ot 
ao-e can read, and nearjy all write also; and the number of per- 
sons in the parish, upwards of fifteen years of age, who can neither 
read nor write, is only 1. The people, in general, are alive to the 
benefits of education; and parents, in particular, make great ex- 
ertions to have their children well educated. The total number 
of scholars at school in the parish is 1 12. _ 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— VnhXic begging is unknown in the 
parish. Its paupers are all supported by the parish funds; and 
the average number of persons receiving parochial aid is 6. The 
average sum allotted to the first is 3s. per month; to the second, 
3s 6d • to the third, 4s.; to the fourth, 5s.; to the fifth, 10s.; 
to'the sixth, L. 1, Is. 8d. The whole monthly expenditure, L. 2, 
7s od • yearly, L. 28, 6s. The contributions to the parochial funds 
arise from various sources ; as follows: The annual average amount 
of church collections, L. 22, 7s. 3d. ; mortcloth dues, L. 1, 7s. lOd. ; 
civil penalties, L. 1, 5s. Bid. ; marriage proclamations, 6s. 2d. ;- 
amount of annual income, L.25,6s. Ufd. But, as the expenditure 



KINNETTLES. 



229 



exceeds the income, the deficiency is made up, sometimes by draw- 
ing on a small fund created in better times, and sometimes by oc- 
casional extraordinary collections at the church. Besides, the late 
Mr James Maxwell, mill-wright, who was born, and lived in the 
parish till within a few years of his death, bequeathed, in a most 
charitable and exemplary manner, about four years ago, L. 50, 
subject to the legacy-duty, to be distributed, within a specific pe- 
riod, in coals, among the poor of the parish ; and from this bequest, 
the poor have derived, and will continue for several years to de- 
rive, inuch comfort and relief during the inclemency of winter. By 
a judicious application of these resources, the managers of the poor 
have as yet been enabled to go on without allowing any parochial 
begging, and without calling in the aid of an assessment. 

In former times, the Scottish spirit, generally, could not brook 
the idea of seeking parochial relief ; but this spirit of independ- 
ence has now been greatly and generally abated. 

Inns and Alehouses. — Prior to Martinmas 1833, there was one inn 
and one alehouse in the parish, both situated on the Strathmore 
turnpike-road ; but the alehouse has since been abolished. 

Fuel. — For ages, peat and wood, whin and broom, constituted 
the fuel of the parish ; but now, that the neighbouring peat-mosses 
are nearly exhausted, and whins and broom nearly exterminated, 
the ordinary fuel is wood and coal in summer, and coal, with 
a small proportion of wood, in winter. Both English and Scotch 
coals are used; but the English chiefly. These coals are pro- 
cured at Dundee, twelve miles distant ; the English at from 4s. 
to 6s. per 6 cwt. or 1 boll of 42 imperial stones ; and the Scotch 
at from 4s. 8d. to 6s. 8d. per 6 cwt. or 1 boll of 42 imperial 
stones. The ordinary price of driving 6 cwt. or ] boll of coals 
from Dundee to the parish is 3s. Hence the necessity of a ca- 
nal, or efficient railway, from some of the sea-port towns into the 
interior of the country. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
In 1792, the best arable land in the parish was rented at L. 1, 5s. 
per Scottish acre; but now it is rented at L. 2, 1 Is. 5d.— a fact which 
shows that the value of land is still more than double of what it 
was at the publication of the last Statistical Account. In 1792, 
a male-servant's yearly wages, including L.8 in money, and L. g', 
lis. 5d. the estimated value of maintenance was L. 14, 1 Is. 5d • but 
now, including L. 10, 15s. in money, and L. 9, 15s. lOd., the'esti-

mated value of maintenance, it is L.20, 10s. lOd. In 1792, a fe- 
male-servant's yearly wage, including L. 3 in money, and L. 4, 6s. 
8d. the estimated value of maintenance, was L. 7, 6s 8d. ; now 
it is, including L. 5, 15s. in money, and L.6, 8s.2id. the estimat- 
es, uiciuui ' T 19 2id In 1792, the wages

of a day-labourer per day, without victuals, were Is. Id. ; ot a car- 
penter. Is. 4d. and of a mason. Is. 6d. ; now the wages of a day- 
labom-er, without victuals, are Is. lOd. ; of a carpenter, 2s.; and 
of a mason 2s. 6d. Comparing the fiars prices of gr-H'-yf 
at Forfar for crop 1833, with the prices of gram m 1792, 1 is 
found that wheat, barley, and oats, are as low-priced at present as 
thev were forty years ago. 

The general aspect °f T ' 

unquestionably been much improved mthin the last forty years. 
Man, parts of it which were then-wet have been drained; many 
wastes reclaimed, and at least 300 acres brought from a state of 
nature into a state ot cultivation, while about 20 acres have been 
added to the plantations. Farming, in all its branches, is conducted 
upon the most approved priuciples, by a body of men -o are gene 
r lly enlightened practical farmers. Formerly the rotat.ons of 
cropping prescribed to the tenants were often found to be d.sad- 
vLtLeou ; but now the farmers enjoy a more liberal system of 
crong, and are tied down by no rotations that are hurtful either 
0 themfelves or their farms. Formerly, flax, pease, and beans 
were cultivated to great extent, but the first being found to be a 
scourging crop, and the two last to encourage foulness have 
been almost completely laid aside. By adoptmg the system of 
alternate husbandry in corn crop, green crop, and g-- - bj 
applying lime and marl, with a proportionate tjuanft, of dung, 
the farmers have generally put the arable land in excellent con- 
dMon. Hence there is not only a greater extent put unde 
cn rop, green crop, and artificial grasses, but the same extent 
Xlds a produce very much superior, both in quantity euid quality 
r he produce of foLer times. Indeed, it may witi safety be said 
that he produce of grain and green-crop is about double of what 
Twa in 1792. SinL that period, the progress of agriculture lias

the arrangement ot the former enclosures has been gieatly alter 



KINNETTLES,

ed ; many new fences have been erected, and the whole system of 
enclosing, so far as it goes, has been very much improved. Within 
these twenty years, the cottages and village-houses, many of which 
have a but and a hen, have in general been made comfortable to their 
inhabitants, and let at rents ranging from L. 1, 5s. to L.2, 10s. per 
house and garden. Within the same period the farm-houses, with 
the offices thereto attached, have been generally put in excellent 
order, and are found to afford ample and commodious accommodation. 
Forty years ago, personal services were exacted and performed in 
the parish. Occupiers of a house and garden, or of a house and 
garden with one or two acres of land, performed some days work 
occasionally, as the proprietor might happen to require them in the 
course of the year. Such tenants as possessed ground sufficient to 
enable them to keep a horse, besides the above services, were bound 
to perform two horseback carriages in the course of the year, as 
far as Dundee, which is distant about twelve miles, or to a similar 
distance. Greater tenants were bound to convey a certain number 
of bolls of coals from Dundee to the proprietors' houses, which re- 
quired two or three days' work of their men, horses, and carts. 
They were likewise bound to give a day's work of all their reapers, 
commonly called a honage, for cutting down the proprietor's corns. 
Besides, they were bound to give annually so many spindles of yarn, 
so many poultry, called hain, and were restricted to particular meal- 
mills, where they were obliged to pay heavy multures, and to per- 
form mill services. From these rigorous remains of feudal slavery, 

the mhabitants of the parish are now happily set at liberty About 

twenty years ago, females were chiefly employed in workino- the 
spmmng-wheel : but this useful and congenial employment has 
now been completely stopped. On the introduction, however of 
the spinning-mill, which banished from the parish at least 250 
spmning-wheels, females betook themselves, some to the easier 
parts of agriculture, some to the yarn-mill, some to the spinning-

wear. With the exception of some parcels of oats sold to the 
home millers, the whole disposable grain of the parish is driven, 
partly to Arbroath, but chiefly to Dundee, whence all the coal, 
lime, foreign wood, salt, iron, flax, seeds, and groceries, which the 
parish requires, are transported with carts. These grievances 
would have been completely redressed, had the canal between Ar- 
broath and Forfar, projected, surveyed, and estimated by the town- 
councils of these boroughs in 1817, been carried into execQtion. 
But this practicable and useful scheme of inland navigation was 
completely overruled, at a county-meeting, by a number of gen- 
I tlemen who, with a view to promote the trade of Dundee, proposed 
the plan of the railway between Dundee and Newtyle, which is now 
 open and in full operation. But, in consequence of its being opened 
i towards the western extremity of the county, it is of no benefit what- 
1 ever to this parish. Of this defect the trustees on that road are aware ; 
I and, with a view to supply it, are proposing to extend the railway 
through Strathmore to Glammis. But although this proposal 
were executed, the railway would still be of little benefit to the 
parish, because its circuitousness would render the road very lono-, 
and, consequently, would increase the rate of carriage so much' 
that there would be little difference between drivingto and from 
Dundee with carts and the railway waggons. If, on the contrary, 
the canal above-mentioned, or a railway between Arbroath and 
Forfar, had been executed, they would, on account of their easy 
extension to Cupar- Angus, have afforded increased facilities of tra- 
velhng, and have brought many commercial advantages to all the 
neighbounng districts.

wooded hills, such as Fothringliam, Kincaldrum, Lawrence, and 
Carrot, — ascending gently from the valley, and terminating the 
landscape as it recedes to the horizon. From its natural position, 
this parish contains no small portion of low flat land, admitting of 
the best divisions for agricultural convenience and ornamental land- 
scape. 

Climate, — The atmosphere, from the neighbourhood of the 
parish to the coast, and its comparatively low situation, is in spring 
and autumn often foggy ; but during the other seasons is mild and 
dry. The east . wind, blowing almost directly from the sea, pre- 
vails in the early part of the year, and, towards evening, fre- 
quently during summer. 

Freestone and gray-slate quarries abound here, and are con- 
verted to the most useful purposes. The soil is various, — prin- 
cipally clay, — in many parts alluvial, and rests upon beds of freestone 
or slate ; and in the more elevated districts, a dark loam, on sand- 
coloured freestone. 

Roe-deer abound in the parish, and find a ready shelter in the 
numerous young plantations. The birds mentioned in the former 
Account, such as dotterel, rails, wood and black-cock, still visit, 
and abound in, the parish. The small squirrel, not noticed in the 
former Account, is found on Fothringham hill. 

Botany. — There are many plants here, though not of a kind 
peculiar to the place. On Fothringham Trientalis Eiiropcea, 
Oxalis acetosella, Vaccinium Vitis Idea. In other parts of the 
parish, Erica tetralix, Veronica beccabunga, Ranunculus, Menij- 
antJies trifoliata, Parnassia palustris, &amp;c. There has been a very 
great increase of plantations since the last account of the parish 
was written. The property of Fothringham is ornamented with 
extensive and varied plantations, consisting of oak, beech, plane, 
spruce, ash, larch, and Scots fir. Near the house of Fothrino-- 
ham are several beech trees of very large size; and the approadi 
to It from the south, through a winding den, presents clumps of 
spruce trees of distinguished beauty. On the other properties, the 
greatest attention has been paid to the improvement of waste land, 
and to the ornamenting of enclosures and fields, by plantations, 
and with handsome trees. In this respect, Colonel Lawrenson, 
ot Invenghty, has earned a just claim to distinction in this district 
tor his judicious and successful disposal of such trees, of consider- 
able size, as are both suited to the soil, and an ornament to the 
neighbourhood. The soil, indeed, seems well fitted for trees in

II._CiviL History. 

Eminent 3f».-Am„ng those «ho -e -fle,ed h„ 
this the place of their birth, we may mention James Webster, 
E n sindent of the Inner Temple, fifth son of the Rev. John 
Webster Snister of this parish. After discovering great acute- 
nts d ardr, and secnrfng the highest ophiion of "-'- 
in the proseontion of his academical '"f- " "  
young gentleman, with a view to practise at th English Bar be 
lok hiinself to his studies at the Innei- Temple Te pous in, 
oressions of his earliest life afterwards prompted him to pay a 
vk o the countries of the east. With this object he travell d 
r.ht continent ; visited Egypt, and parts of Turkey ; and, with 

Lreas ns ardour, at last, set off for Mount Sinai, and ascended 
irmemorable heights. The effect of this fatiguing expedition, 
h~ on his relirn to Cairo, was a fever, wdiich, in a few days,

ham Robert S. Graham, Esq., and Captam Lawrenson.

therefore called the Lord of Redcastle. 

About a mile north-east from Ethie House, the seat of the 
Earl of Northesk and near the sea, stand the remains of a church 
with an enclosed burying-ground around it. It is called St Mur- 
doch's chapel. A considerable part of the walls is still standing. 
It is said to have been a parish church. Ethie House was built 
by Cardinal Beaton, and was his residence. At a place called 
Chapelton, nearly three miles west from the church, there are the 
remains of a chapelry of Quytefield, now the burying-ground of the 
family of Boysack. 

Modern Buildmgs. — There are five spinning mills in the parish 
driven by water, and partly by steam. They manufacture flax 
, brought from the Baltic at a cheaper rate than it can be grown in 
this country. Their hours of working are regulated by the late act 
of Parliament. 

in. — Population. 
In Dr Webster's report, the amount of the population is 1286 : 
but It has since increased, as agricultural improvements advanced ; 
for at the period of the former Statistical Account, the number 
was 1747, and in the year 1821 it was 1785. But the amount by 
the census of 1831 is only 1655, showing a decrease of 130. The 
accidental absence of a few famiUes may account for the diminu- 
tion in part, but the principal cause appears to be the tendency in 
all agricultural populations to fall off, in consequence of agricul- 
tural improvements. Besides, the old lint-mills on the Lunan 
which formerly gave employment to numbers, are now very little 
employed. Nor does spinning with the hand or weaving af- 
ford sufficient encouragement to the many who are thrown upon 
that resource, to continue in the country, at a distance from the 
advantages they have in a town. Of late, too, it has become cus- 
tomary, as a precaution against pauperism, to take down every 
house not necessary for carrying on the operations of the farni

situated a little from the south end of Lunan bay, among the rocks. 
But it is now seldom that a boat can go out to fish, as the old men 
- are afraid to venture, and the young men seek employment where 
there is greater encouragement. There is a salmon-fishing in the 
sands of Lunan bay by a stake-net ; and one has been lately com- 
menced in the sea belonging to the estate of Ethie by a suspension 
net, as the rocky shore will not admit of stakes. The rents of 
these are about L. 140. 

Produce.— The yearly amount of wheat, barley, and oats, is 
about 18,000 bolls. The produce of potatoes, turnips, and all 
green crops cultivated for food is about L. 5,400 ; of hay and 
sown grass, no meadow hay, about L. 3,600 ; of land in pasture 
there may be about 2500 acres. The annual thinning of woods 
may bring about L. 100. 

Quarrt/.— There is at LeysmiH, in this parish, a quarry for

PRESBYTERY OF BRECHIN, SYNOD OF ANGUS ANE MEARNS. 

THE REV. JAMES BREWSTER, MINISTER. 



1. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, -c. — The parish of Craig comprehends two distinct ti- 
tularities, viz. Inchbrayock or Craig, and St Skeoch or Dunni- 
nald ; which were united in the year 1618, and appear from that 
period to have received the common name of Craig. Inchbrayock, 
or Inclibroyocli, a word of GaeHc origin, is supposed to signify 
" the island of trouts and the greater part of the fishing ground 
on this island is still called " the trout-shot :" or, accordino- to 
another etymology, " Inis-Breic, the church or chapel island," 
as the church formerly stood on this island, and the spot is still 
occupied as the parish burial-place. St Skeoch, or St Skay, as it 
is usually pronounced, appears to have received its name from some 
of the northern saints.  A very picturesque spot on the coast is 
usually called the Chapel of St Skay ; but no ruins remain to 
mark the existence of any former edifice. A small burying-place 
is preserved around the spot, which is occasionally used for inter- 
ments ; and the site of the manse is still pointed out in an adjoin- 
ing field. An annual payment of L. 40 Scots also is still paid as 
rent of the glebe tothe Earl of Strathmore, as superior of Res- 
tennet. 

Craig was formerly the name of one of the principal properties 
in the parish, « the barony of Craig ;" and may have originated 
in the circumstance of a succession of rocky strata extending along 
the whole of the sea coast, and occurring also throughout the in- 
terior, very near the surface of the ground. 

Extent and Boundaries.— The parish extends about 6 miles in 
length, and nearly 2 at its greatest breadth ; comprising a sur- 

SWpo'W ° fishermen found a boat at sea with the narae, « St 
thetimn tie stern, which 1 personally examined and noted at

face of 6| square miles. Its figure bears some resemblance to 1 
that of a battledore; the broader part of winch forms a sor of 
promontory between the river Southesk on the north, and the bay 
of Lunan on the south ; while the other extremity, resembhng the 
handle, runs straight towards the west, and mtersects the adjom- : 
ing par'ish of Marytown in its course. The r.ver Southes W . 
flows through a basin about 9 miles m cn-cumference, filled by 
tltide at high water, separates the parish from the town and 
Wbour of Mo'ntrose on the north ; while the whole o he eaern 
and part of the southern, boundary is washed by the German 

Topographical Appearances.-The greater part of the parish | 
towards the east forms a sort of table-land, gradually nsmg from 
the north and east towards the south-west, till it reaches an eleva- 
tion of 400 feet above the level of the sea. Dunmnald is the highest . 
ground on the south coast ; Govan hill, in the middle ; Pitarris 
hill and Mountboy towards the west. , , c i 

The extent of coast washed by the sea is not less than five miles. 
The shore is very rocky; and towards the sonth is q™'« P' 
tons. The bays and headlands are, Montrose bay and Montrose 
ness on the north, and Lnnan bay and Boddin point on the south 
Climate, Disease, Src.-The climate is more than usually healthy, 
compared with the adjoining districts. The most common te- 
eases are rheumatism, fevers, consumption, dysenteries. A sin- 
gular distemper, called the Imping ague, has sometimes made  
Lpearance in this parish. The patients, when f 
the appearance of madness, and their bodies are va lousl, d- 
orted They run, when they find opportunity, with amaz ng 
sness, and'over dangerous passes; and, when confined to the 
house they iump and climb in an astonishing manner, till then

ual remedy." Former Account. One case of more recent date

forms a part of the boundary with the parishes of Marytown and 
Lunan, in that direction. 
Soil and Bocks. — Towards the eastern extremity of the parish the 
. soil is of a sandy description ; towards the west, rather moorish ; 
and in the middle, which is by far the largest portion, it is a strong 
rich loam. The whole rests upon a mountain-mass of amygda- 
loidal trap rock, in which is imbedded a great variety of beautiful 
agates or pebbles. In many parts of the precipitous rocks along 
the southern boundary, little streams of water issue out and trickle 
down the face of the rocks, and which are found to be strongly im- 
pregnated with the carbonate of lime. 

The rocks in this parish are old red sandstone and hmestone, 
intermingled with various trap rocks, as amygdaloid, greenstone, 
&amp;c. 

Zoology. — Besides the ordinary wild animals of the country, 
such as the fox, weazel, hedgehog, &amp;c. there are occasionally 
found in the parish the roebuck, the polecat, and the ermine. 
Seals are frequently seen among the rocks on the eastern coast ; 
and the otter regularly breeds in a cave at St Skay rock. 

Many birds of prey are natives and visitors of the parish. The 
osprey or sea-eagle, common buzzard-hawk, moor buzzard-hawk, 
goshawk, sparrowhawk, merlin, or kestril ; which last builds in 
the tower of the parish church. The long-eared, short-eared, and 
tawny owls build in Mountboy wood, and the white owl at the 
rock of St Skay. The great ash-coloured butcher-bird is found 
at Mountboy wood; the raven and jackdaw at St Skay; the car- 
rion-crow, hooded-crow, and rook at Rossie. The magpie, jay, 
starling, blackbird, fieldfare, redwing, throstle thrush, and cuckoo. 
The great-spotted woodpecker, and the creeper; the greenfinch, 
bulfinch, bunting, yellow bunting, black-headed bunting, and 
snow-bunting. The house-sparrow, chaffinch, mountain-finch, 
go dfanch, siskm, canary-finch, gray linnet, red hnnet ; the sky-

the sea-shore and to maritime cliffs, as well as those found on the 
banks of rivers, and in hilly, woody, and marshy places. The 
principal habitats of the rare plants are the steep banks close to 
the sea at Dunninald and Usan, the woods of Dunninald, Rossie, 
Mountboy, Fullarton,  and the loch at Holemill. 

On the sea shore, and in the marshy places near it, besides 
various species of Atriplex, Arenaria, Salicornia, Glaux, Erodium, 
Caldle, and Aster, we have in abundance the Scirpus maritimus, 
Triglochin maritimum, Sagina maritima, Ligusticum Scoticum, 
•Lithospermum maritimum, and the Elymus arenarius ; which last, 
along with the Triticum junceum, Ammophila arundinacea, Carex 
vulpina and arenaria, is useful in binding together the loose sand 
along the coast. 

On the sloping rocky banks and the red sandstone cliffs at 
Dunninald and Usan, we meet with many rare plants. Among 
these may be enumerated the Astragalus glycyphyllus, Carlina vul- 
garis, Campanula glomerata, and Artemisia maritima, which are 
all very abundant. In the same situation are found the fragrant 
Origanum or marjoram, and the aromatic Clinopodium, the Solidago 
virgaurea, the Oxytropis uralensis, the Gentiana campestris, the 
beautiful blue Geranium pratense, the fine blood-red Geranium 
sanguineum, and, not far from the Dunninald cliffs, the elegant 
Campanula rapunculoides. 

 In the woods, fields, and by the road-sides generally, in addi- 
tion to the usual plants, we find the Chelidonium majus, Pyrethrum 
Parthenium, Radiola millegrana, Pyrola media, Solanum did- 
camara, V irlascum Thapsiis, Anchusa sempervirens, Cynoglossum 
offichiale, Echium vulgare, Dipsacus sijlvestris, Doronicum Parda- 
lianches ; various species of mallow, especially the Malva moschata ; 
several Gnaplialia, and the Dianthus deltoides, which is met with 
in great abundance on the porphyry rocks. In a glqn f borderino- 
on the parish, there is a profusion of the Atropa belladonna, the 
dark-purple shming berries of which, from their attractive ap- 
pearance, have so often proved fatal to children. 

In the lakes and marshes, the chief plants deserving notice are, 
the beautiful white water-lily, or Nymplma alba; the yellow spe- 
cies or the Nuphar lutea; the Menyanthes trifoliata, or elegant 
tuck-bean; the Potamogeton pusillus, gramineus, and pectinatus ;

lingua, Tijpha latifolia, Hydrocotyle vulgaris, Parnassia palustris, 
Comarum palustre, Hippuris vulgaris, Utricularia vulgaris, and 
various species of Orchis."  

The principal woods in the parish are, Govan hill, extending 
to about forty imperial acres; Mountboy wood, covering about 154 
acres ; and Dunninald dean about six acres. The two former are 
situated inland towards the western extremity of the parish, and 
consist chiefly of the Scotch and larch firs; the latter is close to 
the sea-shore on the south side of the parish, and consists rather 
of what are called the hard-woods, ash, beech, elm, and plane-tree. 
The silver fir is also found to thrive better on the coast than the 
Scotch fir. 

II. — Civil History. 
Correct plans of the different properties in the parish have been 
drawn very recently by surveyors ; and a map of the whole parish 
was prepared for the former Statistical Account by Colonel Colqu- 
houn, nephew of the late Mr Ross of Rossie, and at that time a 
young officer in the army. This map appears to have been co- 
pied in a map lately published of the basin of the Tay; and ex- 
cept that a new manse has been built in the vicinity of the church, 
and the villa of Inchbrayock on the site of the old manse, besides 
a few changes made on the lines of road, it still presents a very 
correct view of the localities. 

Eminent men.— Among the eminent characters connected with 
the parish, may be mentioned the truly eminent and excellent 
Archbishop Leighton, who was descended from a family of consi- 
derable celebrity in former times, proprietors of the lands of Usan, 
but whose immediate relationship cannot now be traced with any 
degree of certainty ; Andrew Melville, who was born at Baldovie, 
in the north corner of the parish, and whose life by Dr M'Cne, 
has rendered his name and character familiar to the readers of 
Scottish history; David Scott, Esq. of Dunninald, who, for a long 
period, acted a distinguished part in the direction of the East In- 
dia Company's affairs, was born and brought up in the parish ; 
and his nephew, David Scott, Esq. not less distingmshed by his 

. The above notices respecting the botany of the parish of Craig lYjrnJfon

services in the Indian Empire, and to whose memory a monument 
■ has been erected by the Supreme Government in India, was the 
second son of Arcliibald Scott, Esq. of Usan, A brief memoir of 
his life has been pubhshed at Calcutta, by Major White, author 
of " Considerations on the state of British India." 

Land-oioners. — The present land-owners are, Horatio Ross, 
Esq. M. P., proprietor of Rossie, 2471 imperial acres; Patrick 
Arkley, Esq. a minor, proprietor of Dunninald, 721 ; George 
Keith, Esq. proprietor of Usan, 862 ; Sir James Carnegie, Bart, 
proprietor of Baldovie, 98; and also of Pittarris, 60; undivided 
common, about 757. 

Parochial Registers. — The kirk-session records commence in 
the year 1653 ; and, though not voluminous, are regularly kept 
from that period, with the exception of a blank between 1694 and 
1714. 

Antiquities. — The ancient kings of Scotland possessed a right 
to a cadger road, from the shore of Usan to the cross of Forfar, 
the breadth of which was to be the length of a mill wand ; and 
about seventy years ago the proprietor of Usan claimed a part of 
Monrithmont moor, equivalent to the extent of the said cadger 
road through that moor. A stripe of land, of about 30 acres along 
the shore of Usan, is said by tradition to have been the residence 
of the king's cadger. Craig, or Rossie, appears to have been an 
ancient feudal barony, as a field behind the house is still called 
Lawfield ; and as an adjoining farm-steading is still called Balgove, 
that is, the loithie, or prison-house ; and a rising ground on the pro- 
perty, Govanhill, the tvithie-Jiill, or place of execution. 

The castle of Craig, on the northern side of the parish, fre- 
quently mentioned in the chronicles of Scotland, appears to have 
been a place of considerable strength. A part of the building, 
still occupied as a dwelling-house, bears the date of 1634; but a 
square tower and gateway, still standing in a very compact condi- 
tion, bear the aspect of great antiquity. Li the immediate vicini- 
ty ot Boddin, on the south coast, may be seen the remains, or ra- 
ther the site of an old castle, which still retains the name of Black 
Jack, supposed to have been so named in comparison with Red- 
castle on the opposite side of the bay.-« At the extremity of the 
parish, to the east, where the Southesk lills into the sea, there

were to be seen, about twenty years ago, the remains of an earthen 
fort, in the form of a square, each side of which was about 50 feet ; 
the walls 16 feet thick, and formerly as high or higher than a 
man's head. Within it there was a house tor the purpose o af- 
fording shelter to the men, and holding stores and ammunition, 
wl'u t square, and facing the mouth of the nver there was 
a breast-work of earth, where cannon had been planted tc. defend 
the entrance of the river. Tradition reports that it had been 
made u of in Oliver Cromwell's time ; but whether erected by 
Tm or in more ancient times, cannot now be ascertamed. At 
this fort some cannon were placed so late as the year 174o.

villa of Inchbrayock in 1813. 

These are all constructed, as to the mass of the walls, of a stone  
found in the parish, called scurdy-stone ; but the fronts and more 
ornamental parts are built with freestone from quarries m the vi- 
cinity of Brechin, or in the county of Fife.

The population in 1801, amounted to  13g

There has been rather a dimhmtion of the population in the 
leZiZi parts ot the parish, in consequence of tte demoh- 
rion 0 many c ttages and hamlets; and tt .s pnncpally m the 
«T- JmL that the increase has taken place. Several of

There is nothing remarkable in the personal qualities of the 
people. 

The number of insane is 2 ; fatuous, 3 ; blind, 2 ; deaf and 
dumb none. 

In their general character the people are intelligent and moral, 
and attentive to the public ordinances of religion. About thirty 
■years ago, and even to a later period, the smuggling of gin and 
brandy from Holland prevailed to a great extent ; and great quan- 
tities of Highland whisky were brought into the parish by ilHcit 
traders. But the establishment of the coast guard has completely 
prevented the former practice ; and, since the smaller stills have 
improved the quality of their spirits, the latter has been almost en- 
tirely abolished.

to L. 12, with an allowance of two pecks of oat-meal per week, and 
one Scotch pint of new milk per day ; for married ploughmen from 
L 1 1 to L 13, with the same allowance of milk and meal, a house, 
and commonly a small piece of garden ground, a cart-load of coals, 

and two bolls of potatoes. • i • .v, 

Hushandry.-T\ve common breed of sheep n. the pansh is the 
Highland or black-faced; and of cattle, the Angus-shn-e black, with- 
out horns. The land, in general, may be said to be in a high 
state of cultivation, and managed according to the most approved 
system of husbandry. The duration of leases is almost universally 
for the period of nineteen years ; and their terms, in most cases, are 
fuffidently favourable to the occupiers. The farm-buildmgs are 
commodious in general ; and, in many instances, are of a vei supe- 
rior description. A considerable portion of the land is also well 
inclosed The principal improvements have been made in the 
draining of the lands, the application of manures, and the rotation 

tod Mines.-ln various parts of the parish, there are 
quarries of the amygdaloidal trap-rock, mentioned under the bead 
of rocks, called by the country people scurc y-s one, and co n 
monly employed in building, but not suitable for facnig the dooi 
Z windows of dwelling-houses. There was a considerable bodj 
oHime tone, forming a' promontory or headland, at the southern 
extremity of the parish, about 12 or 13 acres m superficial extent, 

eS up n a soft sandstone ; both of which have been of subse- 
qtr'formation to the amygdaloidal trap-rock m the yicinity This 
hmestone is said to have been wrought so early as the year 1696 

and supposed to have been the fi.t lime burnt - Ang- ; 

40 000 bolls of it have been made and sold in one year. But, attei 

ti. a considerable revenue to the different proprietors of Dun- 
■ is now nearly exhausted. The remaining portion, ex- 

Tpt at very C water is almost constantly covered by the sea ; 

and thUnieased expense of working it, occasioned its being aban- 

ormeriy very P™ 7;;. ,t since the year 1781. they have

about L. 3, 3s, ; and the fresh salmon for 2s. per Dutch stone : 
but of late the prices have increased to near double."  These 
fisheries became still more valuable during the period that stake- 
nets were employed in the river ; and at times the Rossie fishings 
have been let at L. 800. More recently these have only brought 
an annual rent of L. 650 ; and the fishing nearer the river mouth 
belonging to the estate of Usan, only about L. 50. In the year 
1822, a salmon fishery was established on the sea-coast close to 
the Boddin point, by the proprietor of Dunninald, which has proved 
remarkably successful, and has brought a rent of nearly L. 400 
per annum. The greater part of the salmon taken in this parish 
is packed in ice, and shipped for the London and Edinburgh mar- 
kets, and it is not easy to ascertain here the prices procured through- 
out the season. Those which are sold in this neighbourhood cost 
in the earlier part of the season, from 2s. to 2s. 6d. per lb. ; and 
at other times from 8d. to lOd. 

The white or sea-fishing is carried on by the inhabitants of two 
villages, Ferryden and Usan, f to a very great extent. The for- 
mer contains a population of 679, and the latter of 142, the greater 
part of whom are employed in the fishing, — in the one, 85 families, 
or 590 souls ; in the other, 16 families, or 85 souls. In Ferryden 
25 boats are regularly employed ; 18 of these, of a larger size, car- 
rying 6 men each ; 2 of a medium size, carrying 5 ; 3 of a smal- 
ler size, carrying 5 or 4. In Usan 6 boats, at an average, are em- 
ployed throughout the year, carrying 6 men each. 

In the winter season, during calm frosty weather, these boats go 
from eight to ten miles from land, nearly due east from the Bell- 
rock ; but in stormy weather, they rarely venture more than three 
or four miles from land. In summer, they go to a much greater 
distance, and fish upon two banks called the north and south shold; 
the first about eighteen, and the second twenty miles from land' 
Four of the larger boats in Ferryden, and the same number in 
Usan, use m summer what are called the great lines, and some- 
times go thirty miles to sea. The boats with the great lines take 
principally, halibut, skate, cod and ling; the other boats, cod and 
haddocks. The halibut is in best season from April to July, and 
the skate during the same period. The ling is best during the 
summer months, and the cod during winter, or from November to

Manufactures. — In the manufacturing line, there is nothing car- 
ried on here to any great extent. The reason may be, that the 
gi'eat object of pursuit in this district is agriculture ; and that the 
situation of the parish, much elevated and remote from rivers, does 
not furnish the water that would be requisite for extensive bleach- 
fields, and for the operation of mills." There are, however, thirty- 
six males employed in manufacture in the parish. 

Several years ago, small quantities of kelp were manufactured on 
the coast, but the process has for some time past been entirely dis- 
continued. 

Navigation. — Several inhabitants of the parish are joint proprie- 
tors of ships sailing from the port of Montrose, but there are no 
vessels which can be said to belong to the place. Many of the re- 
sidents in Ferryden and its vicinity are employed as seamen in na- 
vigating the Montrose shipping, and especially in the vessels en- 
gaged in the north-sea whale-fishing. Recently, however, the 
greater proportion of the crews of the whalers are taken on board 
from Shetland, where the hands required are easily procured at lower 
wages ; but our fishermen are ready to ascribe to this plan the di- 
minished success of the whale ships from this quarter, in conse- 
quence of the inferiority, as they allege, of the Shetlanders to our 
fishers, as vigorous and adventurous boatmen. 

The only navigable river is the South Esk, which separates the 
parish irom the town and harbour of Montrose. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

The nearest market-town is Montrose, which js separated from 
the northern boundary of the parish only by the river South Esk 
and to which there is access by a magnificent suspension bridge.

ceders. It may also happen occasionally that some of the crew 
of the coast guard are Episcopalians, — but even in that case they 
usually attend the parish church. A few families have returned 
from the Secession to the Established Church within the last 
twenty years. Divine service is generally well attended, both at 
the parish church and at the Sabbath evening lectures in the fish- 
ing villages. The average number of communicants is nearly 500. 

An Association for religious purposes has existed for many years 
in the parish, chiefly under the direction of the ladies residing 
within its bounds ; but it is at present in contemplation to connect 
this association more immediately with the missions and other re- 
ligious institutions under the direction of the Established Church. 

The average amount of the yearly contributions of said Associa- 
tion may be estimated at L. 10. The amount of church collec- 
tions for similar purposes, at the same sum. 

Education.— The number of schools in the parish at present is 
4. Of parochial schools, 1 ; of unendowed schools, 2 ; supported 
by individuals, 1.  

In the parish school are taught, English, writing, arithmetic, 
geography, navigation, mathematics, Latin, and Greek. In one 
of the other schools, English, writing, and arithmetic; and in the 
remaining two, which are taught by females, the only branch of ■ 
education is English reading, with sewing and knitting. 
 The salary of the parochial schoolmaster is L. 34 ; the amount 
of fees actually drawn, L.17; The amount of session fees, &amp;c 
L. 13. The parochial teacher has the legal accommodations ; and 
the dvvelhng-house is of a superior description to those usually pro- 
vided in the country. 

I am not aware of there being any individual in the parish who 
IS altogether unable to read ; but many of the females, especially 
in the fishmg villages, are unable to write. The people are very 
much ahve to the benefits of education, and make great exertions 
to procure it for their children. No additional schools are required, 
except a female teacher for very young children at Usan. The

be remarked, that, besides the private benefactions of residing 
heritors to the poor, they derive much benefit fi-om the circum- 
stance of such famihes being of our own communion, and attend- 
ing the Established church, which has generally been the case for 
a century past. During forty years and upwards, no poor have 
had occasion to beg, — the parish being both able and willing to 
maintain its own poor. Many, however, are apt to give liberally 
to strolling vagrants or sturdy beggars, who infest this district and 
the neighbourhood, — an evil severely felt, and which stands much 
in need of an effectual remedy." This description is still strictly 
applicable to the state of the poor in this parish. 

The average annual amount of contributions for their relief is 
about L. 136 ; arising from church collections, L. 70, 13s. ; from 
donations, L. 22 ; from interest of poor's funds, L. 43, 7s.  

These funds are ordinarily sufficient for the stated supply of the 
poor in the parish ; and when any peculiar case of distress occurs, 
or any general pressure upon the more necessitous arises, which 
the kirk-session are unable to relieve, an extraordinary collection 
in the church, a subscription through the parish, or application to 
the heritors, never fails to procure the required supply. 

There is gradually less appearance of unwillingness among the 
poor to seek parochial relief, but in general they do not apply with- 
out necessity ; and several instances do still occasionally occur of 
great reluctance to accept of it, even when offered. One remark- 
able instance recently occurred, of a person living by his labour 
wishing to make some repayment of what his mother and sister had 
received from the poor-funds. 

Alehouses.— Theve is an undue proportion of alehouses in the 
parish, there being not less than thirteen already licensed, and 
two additional in preparation, which allows one alehouse to every 
twenty-four families in the parish. Their influence is most perni- 
cious in every respect ; and it is truly lamentable to perceive the in- 
sensibility so generally manifested by the more influential classes to 
the rapidly increasing evils among the lower orders of the commu- 
nity, which so obviously proceed from this fertile source of corrup- 
tion.  

FuelThe fuel generally used is coal, brought by sea from the 
iinghsh coast and the Firth of Forth,-the former at the rate of 
IS. 2cl. per barrel, or about 12s. for a one-horse cart load,-and

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since the last Statistical Account, the real rental ot the parish 
has been more than doubled, having increased from L. 4000 to 
L 9500. The population has received an addition ot more than 
300 souls. The poor's fund, or principal at interest, has been 
increased by donations and bequests from L. 200 to L. 850 : tbe 
number of weekly pensioners has, at the same time, become more 
than double. The number of Dissenters from the Established 
■ church has decreased from 20 to 5. The church, manse, and 
school, all the mansions of the proprietors, and all the farm-houses 
except two, have been rebuilt. The population m the villages has 
become greater in proportion to that in the country part of the pa- 
rish, in consequence of many cottages having been thrown down, 
and several pendicles of land added to the larger farms. There 
is, especially, a greater increase of the fishing population who 
form, indeed, a most valuable class of the commumty both pro- 
curing their own bread, and providing an abundant supply of whole- 
some food for others, at the daily peril of their lives, without trou- 
bling the pubhc about rise of wages, or demands for employment. 
They are well treated in this parish by their immediate landlords ; 
but they still labour under some old feudal burdens, and are not 
so generally appreciated and encouraged as they deserve. 

There is a greater shifting of the agricultural populatioii at the 
usual terms, especially among the unmarried servants, and a con- 
sequent deterioration of their morals, as they rarely 
enough in the same parish to be properly brought under pastoial 
inspection and instruction, and seem to become less anxious to main- 
tain a good character in places where they are comparativeb 
strangers, and from which they are likely so soon to -n-- Thi. 
evil appears to be owing, in no small degree, to the O 
inc. the unmarried men-servants apart from the mas ei . fam , 
bdged in out-houses called S.Af.., making their own food,and;h - 
ngf during their unemployed hours, much at their own discretioi .

portion, perhaps, of one to every ten famihes of the agricultural 
labourers, would present a powerful stimulus to these labourers 
to save a little fund for the purpose of renting such a possession ; 
and though only one out of ten could thus succeed in his aim, yet, 
as all would be encouraged to cherish such a hope, all might feel 
an inducement to sobriety and mdustry, which, in present circum- 
stances, is greatly wanted. 

Another great benefit to country parishes, subsidiary, if not pre- 
paratory, to the last mentioned, would be the adoption of some 
systematic measures for diminishing the number of alehouses, and 
discouraging the use of ardent spirits, — an object which, on every 
consideration, moral and poHtical, loudly demands the constant 
and united endeavours of the members of government, the gen- 
tlemen of the country, and the ministers of religion.

PRESBYTERY OF BRECHIN, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. THOMAS HILL, MINISTER. 



I- — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Boundaries, 'c— The parish of Logie, or Logie- Mon- 
trose, as it was formerly called, was annexed to the parish of Pert 
about the year 1610 or 1615. The word Logie which is very 
common throughout Scotland is said to be of Gaelic origin, and 
to signify " a flat or low situation," which certainly corresponds 
to that of the old church of Logie, the remains of which are still 
romantically situated in a hollow or low ground close by the North 
il.sk river. Pert is of uncertain origin. The old church of Pert 
IS no less beautifully situated on the banks of the North Esk, near 
to the old North-water bridge, and three miles up the river from 
iogie The united parish extends from east to west nearly 5 
English miles, aixl from north to south 3 miles. Its boundaries 
are on the north, the river North Esk; on the south, the parish 

:e::fs;in:o:."'°

iBeans regular. The lower part lies along the banks of the North 
Esk, which, by a beautiful curve, divides it, towards the north and 
east, from the adjoining parishes of Marykirk and St Cyrus, fhe 
upper part is pretty high,-generally, however, bending with a 
gentle declivity to the river, and commanding a noble and exten- 
sive view of the Grampians and Mearns. In the lower part, the 
soil is a fine deep loam, while in the upper it is generally a black 
soil on a clay bottom. The temperature is in general keen, and 
apparently not unfavourable to longevity, although at times, par- 
ticularly in 1787-8, there have prevailed fevers highly infectious 
and epidemical. The other distempers most common amongst 
us are, the gravel, rheumatism, and consumptions. It is said that 

the plague raged here in 1648. • i k , 

Hydrography, c.-There are several sprmgs m the parish, but 
none of them of great celebrity. There was one in the old church- 
yard of Logic, formerly much resorted to for medicinal purposes, 
which is now completely dry. Another is situated near the spot 
where the old manse of Pert stood, and still yields a quantity of 
excellent water. The only river is the North Esk, aeady-men 
tioned, more commonly called the North-water, which divide 
the two counties of Angus and Mearns. It takes its nse from tl e 
mountain torrents, and, after issuing from a small lake in the parii 
of Lochlee, falls into the sea about three miles north of Montrose, 
bv the South Esk, which also rises among the Grampians, an 
falls into an inland bay called the Basin of Montrose. 

The North-water produces in abundance excellent trout and sal- 
mon,-the fishing of which yields a considerable revenue to the 
different proprietors. The parish abounds with the usua sorts 
game; and, of late years, the pheasant, formerly a rare bird, has 
become very common. 

IL_CiviL History. 

There are no historical events worthy of notice.

order of their valued rents: David Carnegy, Esq. of Craigo Jmn

Antiquities. — The only antiquities in the parish are the three 
tumuli, on three laws of Craigo, mentioned in the former Statisti- 
cal Account, and situated nearly a mile west of the house of Craio-o 
Two of these tumuli have been opened, and in one of them was 
found a stone coffin, containing a human skeleton almost entire, 
—the bones of an extraordinary size, of a deep-yellow colour, and 
very brittle. In the other tumulus opened, there were found, about 
a foot from the surface, four human skeletons of gigantic propor- 
tions, and near to these, a beautiful black ring like ebony, of a fine 
polish, and in perfect preservation. The ring was 12 inches in 
circumference, and 4 in diameter, flat in the inside, rounded with- 
out, and capable of fitting a large wrist. In the same tumulus was 
found an urn full of ashes. From the discovery of these skeletons 
of extraordinary size, both here and in other parts of Scotland, 
some confirmation would seem to be given to the ancient tradition, 
that at one time there was a race of giants in this country. 

III. — Population. 
_ There is no written record from which the state of the popula- 
tion can be exactly ascertained previous to 1791, when the amount 
was 999. In 1801 it had decreased about 100, in consequence of 
the junction of farms, and the demolition of cottar houses ; but 
smce then it has gradually increased, and in 1831 it was 1360 — 
an increase, doubtless, owing principally to the flourishing state of 
the two manufacturing establishments in the parish, which of late 
years have been greatly enlarged, and in the immediate vicinity of 
which consequently, a great part, we may say about one-half; of 
the whole population is congregated.

also, there is a freestone quarry of excellent quality, but attended

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 
the parish annually, as nearly as can be ascertained, may be stated 
as follows : 

440 quarters wheat, at L. 2, lOs, - . L. 1100 0 0

It may here be added, that a very productive source of income 
to many famihes is the dairy produce which is consumed in the pa- 
rish, and weekly, or oftener, sent to Montrose, amounting, it is be- 
lieved, to not less than several hundred pounds annually. 

Manufactures.— There are, as already mentioned, two great ma- 
nufacturing establishments in the parish, namely, those at Logie 
and Craigo. They are both situated on the banks of the North 
Esk, about half a mile distant from each other. The Logie works, 
which comprise a bleachfield and flax spinning-mill, belong to a 
company in Montrose. The bleachfield has been in existence 
nearly seventy years. At present, it is employed solely in bleach- 
ing hnen yarns, which are afterwards manufactured into various 
kinds of cloth for the home and foreign markets. The number 
of hands employed varies from 40 to 50, consisting of men, women 
and boys, the boys earning from 4s. to 6s., the women from 5s. to 
6s., and the men from 10s. to 12s. weekly. The average work- 
ing time ,s eleven hours per day. The flax spinning-mill was 
erected upwards of thirty years ago, and has been lally much 
enlarged It employs about 130 hands, consisting of men, women 
and ch dren. None are employed under ten, and but' w 
de twelve years of age, the wages vary from 3s. to 20s. and up-

munion elements. All the families in the parish belong to the 
Establishment, except 15, of whom 5 are Episcopalians, and the 
rest attend neighbouring Dissenting meeting-houses. When the 
weather permits, attendance on Divine service is generally very 
regular and good. For the last five years, the average number 
of communicants has been 500. There are no societies for reli- 
gious purposes in the parish. But the people, when appealed to 
publicly, as they frequently are, in behalf of such purposes as the 
Assembly's Highland Schools and Indian Mission, seldom fail to 
respond in a very Uberal manner, and for the last three years the 
average amount of church collections yearly, for special religious 
and charitable purposes, has exceeded L. 10. 

Education. — Besides the parochial, there are two unendowed 
schools, recently built, one at each of the mills, and also three smal- 
ler ones, taught by females, in different parts of the parish. The 
usual elementary branches are taught in them all. The parochial 
teacher's salary is the maximum, and his school fees amount to 
about L. 10. He is provided with all the legal accommodations. 
With the exception of the blind boy, and the two fatuous persons 
formerly mentioned, it is believed there are none in the parish 
above six years of age who cannot read or write. The people in 
general are much alive to the benefits of education, and exert 
themselves to procure for their children the best teaching in their 
power. The total number of scholars attending all the schools in 
the parish is about 200. '

PRESBYTERY OF BRECHIN, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. ROBERT SMITH, 1 MINISTERS

I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — In a charter of Renovation and Confirmation, 23d 
David II. dated Scone, 6th of March, and in another, 14th Ro- 
bert IL, dated Mouros, 2d February,— a charter believed to be 
by David I. to the burgesses of Montrose is engrossed, and- al- 
though, from the tenor of that charter, it appears that Montrose 
was a burgh even before, it is the earliest now known to exist, in 
which it is acknowledged as such. As that charter is rather a curi - 
osity m Itself, and as it is not pubHshed in the public records of 
Scotland, it is given below. 

In conformity with that charter, the ancient name of the town 
IS said to have been Celurca or Salorky. The derivation of its 
present name from Mons Rosarum is evidently fanciful It re 
quires some stretch of imagination, to regard its site as a mountain- 
neither, from its soil and climate, can it be supposed to have at any' 
time been distinguished for its roses. To this derivation, however,

the motto on the town's seal refers, mare ditat, rosa decorat. The 
name in ancient charters, and which is still in common speech ap- 
plied to it, is Momoss— Ross signifying a promontory, and Mon 
or Moinh the buck : these two names are certainly descriptive of 
its situation at the back or more distant part of the promontory. 

Boundaries, Extent. — It is bounded on the east by the Ger- 
man Ocean ; on the north and south by the North and South 
Esk,— the latter separating it from the parish of Craig, and the 
former from the parish of St Cyrus. The North Esk is also 
the boundary of the counties of Forfar and Kincardine. On the 
west this parish is bounded by those of Dun and Logie Pert. Its 
length between the two rivers is about 3 miles ; its extreme breadth, 

about the same. 

Topographical Appearances.— Tovfards the south, the parish 
narrows to a peninsula of about a mile in width, formed between 
the.sea and the basin. On the west side of that peninsula the town 
is built. Above the bridge, which is nearly a mile from the sea, 
the river expands into what is called the Basin of Montrose, which 
at high water presents the appearance of a lake of about nine miles 
in circumference,— a circumstance which not only adds greatly to 
the beauty of the scenery, but is highly valuable in a commercial 
point of view, as the quantity of water carried to and from the sea 
every tide prevents the formation of a bar at the mouth of the 
river, thus rendering the harbour accessible, at all times of tide, to 
all except the largest class of vessels. The lower part of the pa- 
rish is level ; towards the north-west there is a gradual ascent nearly 
to its junction with the parishes of Dun and Logie. And although 
the greatest height is inconsiderable, yet, from that part of the pa- 
rish the view is rich and varied. 

Diseases.— There are no diseases that can be considered ende- 
mic in the parish, though it certainly has its due share of catarrhs, 
rheumatisms, sore throats, and all the common epidemics. In the 
summer of 1833 we had a very gentle visitation of mahgnant cholera. 
Sporadic cases of typhous fever are of frequent occurrence both in 
the town and neighbourhood ; but this disease has not prevailed to 
any extent, nor assumed a malignant type since 1819, when the 
mortality attending it was very great. It has been remarked, that 
genuine Phthisis pulmonalis is less frequent here than in various 
other parts of the country, though the other forms of scrofula are 
by no means uncommon. Calculous disorders seem also to be com- 
paratively rare. Upon the whole, the parish must be considered 



MONTROSE.

healthy, — an inestimable advantage, for which it is probably in a great 
measure indebted to the dryness of its soil 

Geology. — The lower part of the parish is sand to a great depth, 
and as that sand is mixed with sea shells, it is highly probable that 
the basin has at one time been a bay. The lower part is separated 
from the upper for the space of upwards of a mile, by a low mound 
running nearly parallel with the sea, formed of round water-worn 
stones or bowls ; whether this mound has been left in its present 
state by the retiring of the sea, or whether it is not in a great de- 
gree artificial, affords room for doubt. The north road is carried 
along it, and a considerable portion of it has been removed for 
metal to the roads. Although it is only a few yards in breadth, the 
soil on the west side of it is of a totally different nature from that 
on the east, part of it being black loam with a clay bottom, part 
of it lighter with a gravel bottom. On the estate of Hedderwick 
there is a limestone quarry, and a great part of the higher grounds 
m the parish probably rests upon lime. The want of stone in the 
neighbourhood is, in an economical point of view, a great disadvan- 
tage to the town. The stones used in building have to be brought 
from Brechin, a distance of eight miles, or from other quarries 
about the same distance. Lately a considerable quantity of stone 
has been brought from the south coast of Fife by sea, and the dif- 
ference in price between these and what is brought by land is not 
material. 

There is a mineral well in the parish still resorted to by people 
in Its immediate neighbourhood : but its reputation does not stand 
high. 

Zoology— UnAev this head, there is little deserving particular 
notice. The principal varieties of birds that frequent the basin 
are enumerated in the account of the parish of Craig, and it is 
unnecessary to repeat them here. The salmon-fishings in the ri- 
vers which bound the parish, and in stake-nets along the coast, are 
valuable. The market is abundantly supplied with white fish, 
chiefly cod and haddocks, also ling, whitings, halibut, turbot, 
flounders &amp;c. The families employed in the fishing reside chiefi; 
in Ferryden and Usan, villages in the parish of Craig. From the 
same quarter, a great many fish are carted for the supply of the in- 
land parts of the country.

cipal proprietors and some of the fiirm-steadings, constitute almost 
the whole of the wood in the parish, — so that, upon the whole, it 
is but scantily supplied with this important article in rural scenery. 

II. — Civil History. 

Land-oioners. — A considerable portion of the land in the im- 
mediate neighbourhood of the town is in small properties or feus, 
extending from two to six or eight acres. The principal proprie- 
tors in the parish, with their valued rents, are George Fullerton 
Carnegy of Charlton and Kinaber, L. 489, 16s. 4d. ; Alexander 
Renny Tailyour of Borrowfield and Newmanswalls, L.733, 6s. 8d.,- 
John Duncan of Rosemount, L. 406, 4s. ; James Cruickshank of 
Newbigging, L. 169, lis. 8d. ; George Robertson Scott of Hed- 
derwick, L. 501, Is. 4d. ; total valued rent, L. 2300. The real 
rent of the whole parish, as ascertained by a valuation made about 
four years ago, is, of the burgh, L. 18,700; of the landward part, 
L. 6656 ; total, L. 25,326. 

Parochial Registers.— The proceedings of the kirk-session are 
recorded in seven volumes: \st, From 1633 to 1651; 2d, from 
1686 to 1691 ; 37, from 1696 to 1724; m, from 1724 to 1734; 
bth, from 1734 to 1787; Qth, from 1787 to 1815; Ith, from' 
1815, &amp;c. 

Historical Notices.— Thexe are no printed histories of Montrose, 
except such as are to be- found in Encyclopaedias, Gazetteers, &amp;c 
" 1296. This year, John Comyn, Lord of Strathbolgie, basely and 
traitorously, contrary to his faith, delivered King John Baliol to 
Edward King of England, at the Castle of Montrois in Angus 
in the fourth year of John's reign, and there he surrendered his 
crown." The crown was snatched from his head,— the ermine torn 
from his mantle,— the sceptre wrested from his hand,— and every 
thing taken from him, belonging to the state and dio-nity of a 
king. Dressed only in his shirt and drawers, and holding a white 
rod in his hand after the fashion of penitents, he confessed that, 
by evil and false counsel, and through his own simplicity, he had 
grievously offended his liege-lord, recapitulated all the late trans- 
actions, and acknowledged himself to be deservedly deprived of his 
Kingdom.  c

It was from the port of Montrose that Lord James Douglas at- 
tended with a numerous retinue of knights and esquires, set sad m 
the spring of 1330, in execution of the last charge committed to 
his care by his deceased master. King Robert Bruce to carry his 
heart to Jerusalem to be deposited in the Holy Sepulchre. 

John Erskine, Laird of Dun, and grandfather to the associate 
of John Knox in promoting the Reformation in Scotland, treated 
the inhabitants of Montrose in the most tyrannical and arbitrary 
manner. The oppressions of him and of his family at length be- 
came so insupportable, that the town apphed to the king for re- 
dress, and in the subjoined Royal warrant, issued m consequence 
of that apphcation, we have a striking and interesting illustration 
of the state of the country in feudal times.

In the year 1648, the town was visited by tlie plague, as appears 
from the following entry in the session record. " Because of ane 
fearfuU prevailing pestilence entered into the city, enlarging and 
spreading itself, dailie destroying and cutting down many, which 
occasioned ane scattering and outgoing of all the members of ses- 
sion to landward, for their refuge and saiftie, therefore there was 
no session nor collection in this our church of Montrose betwixt 
the last of May 1648, and the 1st of Februarii 1649." 

In February 1716, James, the first pretender, sailed from Mon- 
trose, a vessel having been prepared to carry him off, and the prin- 
cipal part of his chieftains. At eight o'clock at night, having 
ordered his horse to the door of the house where he lodged, with 
all his guards mounted in the usual manner, he went from his lodg- 
ings by a back door to those of the Earl of Mar, and thence, in 
company with the Earl and one domestic, by a private footpath, to 
the water side, where a boat was in waiting, which carried them 
aboard the Maria Teresa of St Maloes.

found who understood the management of pumps in coal- works : 
this was John Young, a citizen of Montrose, who had been sent over 
to Holland by the magistrates, for the purpose of learning the most 
improved modes of constructing and using wmdmills. 

Eminent ikTew.— James Graham, Marquis of Montrose, who 
makes so distinguished a figure in the civil wars of the seventeenth 
century, first as the champion of the covenant, and afterwards m 
the service of the king, was born at Montrose in 1612. 

In 1534, John Erskine of Dun, afterwards superintendant of 
Angus, brought from the continent a Frenchman of the name of 
Marsilliers, capable of teaching the Greek language, and establish- 
ed him in Montrose, which is believed to have been the first place 
in Scotland where this noble tongue, previously almost unknown in 
the country, and an acquaintance with which was deemed to imply 
a tendency to heresy, was taught. 

Andrew Melville, who has been styled the Father of Presbytery 
in Scotland, born in the neighbouring parish of Craig, was educat- 
ed in Montrose; and when, in his fourteenth year he was removed 
to the University of St Andrew's, he surprised his teachers by his 
knowledge of Greek, with which they were wholly unacquainted. 
Here also James Melville, the nephew of Andrew, attended school, 
and gives, in his Diary, a very interesting account of the manner in 
which his education was conducted, and also of the kindness he ex- 
perienced from the then minister of Montrose. 

HI. — Population.

ISl: - - - - 12°- 

In the last census sailors were not included. Their number may 
be from 700 to 800. Since 1831 the population has still conti- 
nued to increase. In 1833 the proclamations were 89 ; baptisms 
registered, 140 ; burials, 293. The proclamations and burials are 
correct, but the baptisms are not nearly one-half of the actual 
number baptised,-a circumstance which shows clearly the neces- 
sity of a legislative enactment rendering it imperative upon parents 
to attend to this important matter. Besides the families employed 
in trade, manufactures, &amp;c. there are considerable nmi.bers who, 
from various causes, have chosen Montrose as their residence; and 
hence there is in it a class of society superior to what is to be found 
in many country towns of like size.

Language, Customs, S-c. — One great peculiarity which strikes a 
stranger from the south, in the language of the common people 
in this county, and in the neighbouring counties on the north, is 
the use of / for wh, as fan, far, &amp;c. for lohen, where, &amp;c. Except 
by the better classes, the lowland Scotch is universally spoken 
with a strong provincial accent. 

Amusements. — Golf playing, a pleasant and healthy exercise, for 
which the links afford one of the best grounds in Scotland, is much 
practised by all ranks and all ages. Cricket has also of late years 
been introduced. The theatre and horse-racing may be numbered 
among the things that loere in Montrose, — the building for the 
former having been converted into dwelling-houses, and the race- 
course not having for a number of years been applied to its original 
purpose. Players, however, still occasionally visit the town, and per- 
form in places of temporary accommodation,— little, it is believed, 
either for their own profit, or the improvement of their audience.' 

Habits and Character of the People.—Whexi, a few years ago, 
cholera threatened the town, great exertions were made to promote 
among the lower ranks attention to cleanliness, the want of which 
was then ascertained to exist to an extent of which previously 
many had no idea; and, although some may have been thus brought 
to see and to feel its advantages, yet there is still considerable room 
for improvement in this respect. The general abundance and 
consequent cheapness of fish, while it is an advantage to all the 
mhabitants, is peculiarly so to the poorer classes, as compared 
with those who live in more inland districts. 

There are very few grown up persons who cannot read; and 
although here as elsewhere, different opinions are entertained in 
regard to cml and ecclesiastical matters, these have not occa- 
sioned such asperities, nor so marred the pleasures of social inter- 
course, as in some other places; nor, upon occasions which bring 
the people together, and upon which their conflicting opinions ar 
riot n t f ""f -"duct, has any of that tendency to 
noting, of which we hear elsewhere, been manifested by them.

Navigation, Trade, and Commerce. — Montrose is a port of the 
Custom-house, and, as such, comprehends within its bounds from 
the lights of Tay on the south, to the Todhead on the north, and 
consequently includes Arbroath, &amp;c. The account of shipping for 
the whole district amounts to 187 ships, 18,200 tons, of which there 
belong to Montrose 108 ships, 11,000 tons. The principal fo- 
reign imports into Montrose during the year ending 5th January 
1834 are as follows : 

Flax, - 2496 tons. ]5cwt. Oak, - 194 loads. 

Hemp, - 43 17 Oak plank, - 81 

Tallow, - 38 3 Battens and bat-

Whale oil, - 399 tons of 252 gal. Deal and deal ends, 7 0 21 
Fir timber, - 1324 loads. 

There are few or no exports to foreign ports from Montrose, the 
manufactured goods being sent coastwise to London, Glasgow, 
Dundee, &amp;c. for exportation. 

The bonded system has for several years past been extended to 
Montrose, so that, besides the direct imports mentioned above, al- 
most all the wines and foreign spirits consumed in the district are 
brought coastwise to the bonded warehouses, and pay the duties at 
the custom-house when taken out for consumption.

Burnh.-Monlvose is a royal burgh. The town-council consists 
of 19 members. Along with Forfar, Brechin, Arbroath and Ber- 
vie, it sends a member to Parhament. The number of voters m 
the Parliamentary burgh is 476. The population of the burgh is 
11 500 The revenue of the town from land in the parish, teu- 
du'ties,'and shore dues, is nearly L. 3000. The town is hghted 
with gas, and well supplied with water conducted by pipes a distance 
of about three miles from the parish of Dun. The inhabitants 
have availed themselves of the general Pohce Act for burghs, pas- 
sed a few years ago. Since then, very great improvements have 
been made in the paving and cleaning of the streets. 

Public Buildings.-The church, situated m the middle of the 
town, and about three miles from the extremity of the parish was 
built in 1791. It is a large plain building, being 98 feet by 65 over 
walls, has two tier of galleries, is seated for 2500, and can contain 
nearly 3000. There are no free sittings, and the greater part ot it 
is private property. When the church was renewed, the old steeple 
was allowed to stand, till about three years ago when, having been 
condemned as dangerous, it was taken down A new steeple is just 
completed from a design by Mr Gillespie Graham, architect I 
consists of an elegant and massy Gothic tower, upwards of 100 feet 
high, surmounted by a spire nearly of the same height. 

In 1829, a chapel of ease now St John's Church was open-

•wooden bridge, the channel of the stream was greatly contracted. 
The effect of this unnatural confinement of so violent and rapid a 
stream was to deepen the channel not less than five or six feet in 
many parts; so that the original bottom having been carried away 
the foundations on which the pier rested were in danger of being 
undermined. To prevent this result, wooden piers were driven in, 
■which served as a sort of wall to repel the current. This was found 
to be ineffectual, and it was accordingly determined a few years ago 
to remove the wooden structure altogether, and to supply its place 
by a suspension bridge. Such a bridge has been erected after a 
design by Captain Samuel Brown of the Royal Navy. The foun- 
dation stone was laid on the 18th September 1828; and the whole 
was completed by the 12th December 1829. 

The distance between the towers at the two extremities of the 
bridge, measured from the centre of each, is 482 feet. The height 
of each tower is 71 feet; namely, 23 from the foundation to the 
roadway, 44 feet from the roadway to the top of the cornice and 
3J forming the entablature. The breadth of each tower at the 
termination -of the cut-water is 40 feet, and 39 at the roadway. 
The archway by which each is perforated is 16 feet in width, by 
18 feet in height. The four counter abutments for securino- the 
chains are respectively 115 feet distant from the towers reckon- 
ing from the centre of the tower to the face of the farthest wall of 
the chambers, and consist each of an arched chamber, a strong 
counter fort or abutment, a tunnel, and lying spandrel arch. The 
width of the bridge is 26 feet within the suspending rods. The 
bars of which the main chains consist measure 8 feet 10 inches 
from centre to centre of the bolt holes, 5 inches broad between the 
shoulders, and 1 inch thick throughout. All the main links or 
bars are of the same thickness, except those in the towers, which 
are Jth of an inch thicker, and of length to suit the curve of the 
cast-n-on saddles. Each main suspending chain— of which there 
are two on each side of the bridge, one over the other, placed one 
toot apart— consists of four lines of chain bars. The joints of the 
upper main chains are over the middle long bar in the lower chains ; 
and the suspending rods which support the beams on which the 
roadway ,s laid are 5 feet distant from each other. The chains 
are of wrought cable iron ; the beams are of cast iron, formed with 
open spaces 26 feet 8 inches long, 10 inches deep at the neck of 
the tenons, and 1 inch thick in every part between the flanges. 
1 he whole cost has been a little above L. 20,000. There is a pon- 
tage levied at the bridge, which amounts to about L. 1300a-year 



284 FORFARSHIRli. 

The centre of the arch of the stone bridge which crosses the 
southern channel was at the same time taken down and a revolv- 
ing drawbridge erected in its stead, by which vessels are allowed 
to pass up and down the basin. The communication across the 
Esk at Montrose may, therefore, now be considered to be as per- 
fpft as it can be rendered or desired.

from the teinds, is 19 chalders, half meal and half barley, the va- 
lue of which, according to the fiars prices of the county, upon an 
average of the last seven years, is L. 295, 5s. lOd., with L. 10 for 
communion elements. The stipend in the second charge is paid 
from an annuity raised in terms of an act of the Scottish Parlia- 
ment, 1690. The act authorizes five per cent, upon the rents of 
all houses in the burgh ; but, from the increase of the town, it has 
not for some time past been necessary to levy to that amount. A 
few years ago, the incumbent, and the magistrates who levy the as- 
sessment, not being able to agree as to the amount of stipend, an 
action was raised before the Court of Session, who fixed it at 
L. 340; and the assessment required to realize that sum, including 
the expenses of collection, is 2 per cent. The minister in the 
second charge has neither manse nor glebe. The stipend of the 
minister in the chapel of ease is L. 150, with L. 12, at each of the 
sacraments, for copimunion elements. The only funds are the 
seat rents, and twelve collections allowed to be made yearly. 

There are two Episcopalian chapels in the town, one not in con- 
nection with the Episcopal church in Scotland, the other under 
the Bishop. There are two congregations in connection with 
the United Associate Synod, one of Methodists, one of Baptists, one 
of Glassites, and one of Independents. The greater part of these 

congregationsaresmall,andaproportionoftheirmemberscomefrom

congregations are regular in their attendance upon their respective 
places ot worship.

In the country part of the parish, there is a school under the ma- 
nagement of the kirk-session, the teacher of wuch has a school- 
room, a dwelling-house and garden, with L. 2 of salary. The 
nurTber attending it is about 80. There is a free school from a

den' In these two schools, the pupils pay no fees Two years ago 
the trades erected a school of two departments, one for Engli h the

found to be very beneficial, — many of the young people who work 
at the mills attending these schools after working hours. The 
teachers of the free schools are bound to teach on Sabbath evening, 
and, besides these, there is a number of other Sabbath schools. 

The total number of children attending school is 1634 — after 
deducting 40 who attend both teachers of the Trades' School 

Libraries. — A public Library was established in 1785, and con- 
tains, along with many ephemeral publications, a fair collection of 
standard works in divinity, history, and literature. The subscrip- 
tion is a guinea a year; the number of subscribers is upwards of 100 ; 
and the number of volumes about 7000. There is a library belong- 
ing to the Montrose Reading Society, the subscription to which is 
4s. 4d. annually, and which contains a pretty extensive collection of 
books. The session has a parish Library, consisting chiefly of re- 
ligious books ; and there is one of the same kind connected with 
the chapel. 

Lunatic Asylum, Infirmary, and Dispensary. ~ln I779, the at- 
tention of the magistrates and of the influential persons of the town 
and neighbourhood was directed towards the importance of having 
a proper place for the confinement of lunatics, and for the reception 
of sick and diseased persons, in indigent circumstances. Contribu- 
tions were raised, and a building erected for the accomplishment of 
these purposes. The building having been repeatedly enlarged 
since then, is now extensive and commodious, and stands in a healthy 
and well-aired situation. In 181 1 a Royal charter was obtained for 
the institution. Its aff-airs are conducted by 50 managers Th, 
provost and first bailie, and the two parish ministers, are ex offici 
managers. Of the others, thirty are required to be inhabitants of th 
burgh, eleven landed proprietors, and five clergymen of parish 
m the neighbourhood. Besides a keeper and matron, there is n. 
the house a resident medical superintendent. In connection with 
he Infirmary and Dispensary, the town is divided into six districts

From the above statement, it will be seen that the ordinary ex- 
penditure of the session greatly exceeds its income. The de- 
mands upon the funds have of late been' rapidly increasing. In 
order to meet them, and, if possible, to ivoid the necessity of hav- 
ing recourse to a compulsory assessment, — an evil to be deprecated 
in any case, and which may eventually be rendered altogether un- 
necessary, when the prospects there are of considerable additions 
to the funds for the support of the poor in this place shall be rea- 
lized — the inhabitants have with great propriety agreed to a vo- 
luntary assessment, for the present year, of sevenpence a-pound 
upon the house rents. By the sum which this, if levied, will amount 
to, the session will be enabled to meet the demands upon it without 
increasing its debt. One great cause of the increase of pauperism 
in towns is the shortness of the time requisite for acquiring a legal 
settlement. Many men, with their families, after they are unable 
for the heavy work in the country, come to the town, and contrive, 
as day-labourers, to support themselves for a few years, when they 
find it necessary to apply for parochial aid. The dissolution of 
the Friendly Societies already referred to, and the unnecessary in- 
crease of public-houses, have also tended to increase the demands 
upon the session funds. 

Besides the funds under the management of the session, there is 
the Hospital Fund, consisting of certain lands and teinds granted 
to the town of Montrose by King James VI., 1587, out of church 
lands annexed to the Crown. From that fund; which is under the 
management of the town-council, monthly pensions are paid to a 
number of poor people. The sum divided last year was L. 160. 
From the guildry funds small collections are "made to decayed bur- 
gesses, and to the widows of such. 

Mortifications.— The family of Hedderwick mortified a small 
sum to the poor at large, both in the town and country parish, and 
another to purchase for the poor in the country parish Bibles and 
New Testaments. 

There are several sums of mortified money, the interest of 
which IS annually divided by the trustees, who are generally some - 
ot the magistrates and the ministers :— Miss Stratton's fund, the 
interest of L. 900 to 10 poor gentlewomen ; Mrs Innes' do. the 
interest of L. 1000 to 10 poor widows; Mr White's do. the inte- 
rest of L. 800 to 20 householders ; Bailie Auchterlony's do. the 
interest of L. 560 to the poor in general ; Miss Mill's do. the in-

his will, dated October 1786, the sum of L. 2000, the annualrent 
of which was to be apphed, by trustees named by hun, for the be- 
nefit of ten poor families, with three children each ; and also the 
sum of L. 3000, the annualrent of which, after paymg L. oO to 
an additional teacher in the grammar-school of Montrose, was to 
be divided among ight poor boys, who hac lost one or both then 
parents, to attend said school. In 1801, the trustees laid out the 
above sum in the purchase of land,-a transaction which has proved 
hiffhly advantageous to the charity. Last year, after paying the 
L 50 to the teacher, each of the eight boys upon the chanty re- 
ceived L. 17, 4s., and each of the ten families L. 12, 12s. ihe 
male heirs of the testator are patrons. 

7.zr,5.-There is one good Inn in the town. The number of 
persons licensed to sell spirits is about 130 ; and here as elsewhere 
L have often cause to complain of the demoralizing effects which 
the facility of procuring ardent spirits has upon the people; much

General Observations. 
Since last report of the parish, the population has been doubled ; 
while the church accommodation, even then too scanty has been 
increased only about one-half; the tonnage of the shipping has 
been more than trebled ; the exports and imports have increased ui 
a still greater ratio; the manufactures have been almost entirelj 
created ; the income of the Session is about twice and a-half, and 
its expenditure four times and a-half the amount of what they were 
tlien "n the country part of the parish, the agriculture has been 
marked by those progressive improvements by which the count, v 
general is distinguished.

PRESBYTERY OF FORFAR, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. ANDREW CROMAR, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name and Boundaries. — This parish appears to have been for- 
merly known under the name of Finhaven. In the acts of the Par- 
liament of Scotland, and in other old records, it is variously spel- 
led, Fynnevin, Ffinheaven, and Phinheaven. The name is evi- 
dently compotmded of two Gaelic words, Fi7i, signifying white or 
clear, and Avon or Ave7i, signifying a water or a river. At what time, 
or for what reason, the change of designation from Finhaven to 
Oathlaw took place, no very distinct trace can now be discovered. 
From some circumstances, however, it would appear that there had 
at one time been two churches within the parish. The founda- 
tions of an old church, called the church of Aikenhauld, are still 
visible on a beautiful point of land, a little below the Castle of Fin- 
haven, at the junction of the Esk and the Lemno. From its situa- 
tion in the immediate neighbourhood of the castle, this would ap- 
pear to have been the original parish church ; and the present church 
of Oathlaw, which is two miles distant from it, may have been at 
first, perhaps, a chapelry belonging to it. In the Retour of Service 
granted in favour of Lord Kinnoull, 16th May 1635, amono- other 
properties and rights belonging to the barony of Finhaven, there is 
mention made of the " Villa de Othlaw,"_« cum advocations 
ecclesi de Phinheaven vocatae Oathlaw." The probability, there- 
fores, that when the old church near the castle fell into decay, 
the church of Oathlaw became the parish church. In the Session 
records which commence only in the year 1716, the parish is cal- 
led Oathlaw, and spelled " Outhlaw." It may be remarked, that 
at present there is no particular hill in the parish bearing this name, 
an , therefore when itis considered that the barony of Finhavencon- 
t tutes four-fifths of the parish, and that the Hill of Finhaven, with 
Its celebrated vitrified fort, and the Castle of Finhaven, so cons i- 



292 FORFARSIIIUE. 



cuous in the history of Scotland as the residence of the Earl of 
Lindsav and Crawford, are the most prominent objects m it -it must 
be admkted that the ancient name of Finhaven is by far the best 
and the most characteristic. On these accounts, it is the wish of 
the present chief proprietor and patron of the parish, the Earl of 
Abovne, to have the old name Finaven restored. 

Extent-Boundaries.-T\.s parish hes about four mdes north 
from Forfar, on the south bank of the South Esk, which in some 
places forms the boundary hne. From east to west, its longest 
direction, it extends about 6 miles, not being anywhere above 3 
„,iles broad. It is bounded on the north by the parish of Tan- 
nadice, which chiefly lies on the opposite bank of the Esk; on 
the east, by the parish of Aberlemno. The parishes of Rescobie 
and Aberlemno bound it on the south; and the parish of Kirrie- 
muir lies on the west. 

Meteorology and Hydrography. -The chmate of this parish was 
formerly very damp, owing principally to the retentive nature of 
the soif, which occasioned much stagnant water, and consequently 
x.,ade the atmosphere very cold and moist. But since the exten- 
sive agricultural improvements, especially in draining, which were 
carried on in the parish during the time fat Mr Ford was pro- 
prietor of Finhaven, and more recently under the direction of M 
Hillocks, factor to the Earl of Aboyne,-there is now little stagnan 
water left, and the chmate has in consequence been of late yeais 

very much improved. . 

The Rber Esk runs along the parish, nitersectmg .t m seme 
mrts. It is here about 140 feet broad, and in more than one place 
Teasil, fordable. Its hanks in this neighbourhood, and foseve- 
ral miles to the eastward, are in general low ; '"s » co " 

sequence, suffer considerably from the vvmter floods Jhe 8'

small rivulet called the Lemno, which takes its rise on the south 
side of Finhaven Hill, in the parish of Aberlemno. This small 
stream, having made a circuit of twelve or thirteen miles round 
the Hill of Finhaven, empties itself into the Esk, about a mile 
due north from its source. It runs beneath the walls of the 
Castle of Finhaven, and joins the Esk at the point of land 
where the foundations of the old church are still visible. There 
is a very powerful spring of excellent water at the east end of 
the parish, which comes up through the borings made some years 
ago by the late proprietor of Finhaven, Mr Ford, when in search 
of coal. These borings were carried down about 160 feet, and no 
coal having been found at that depth, the work was abandoned. 
The borings still remain, and, from their great depth, the water 
rushes up with considerable force, and in great abundance. This 
spring, however, is not now visible. Being in the midst of a corn- 
field, and the tenant being much annoyed by people coming from 
curiosity to view it, the water has been conducted into a drain, and 
the whole closed up from sight. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The parish may be said to be flat, 
and as there are few rocks or cliffs in it, it presents no very strik- 
ing or interesting feature to the geologist or mineralogist. The 
Hill of P'inhaven is the only eminence worthy of notice. It skirts 
the southern boundary of the parish, and runs in a direction from 
east to west about ten miles. It consists of a kind of sandstone, 
very thickly imbedded with water-worn pebbles, presenting the 
appearance of conglomerate. On the north side, which belongs to 
the parish, it rises with a gentle sweep to the height of about 1500 
feet above the level of the surrounding country. On this side the 
rock is very little exposed, as the soil covers the whole. It is cul- 
tivated almost to the summit, which is covered with a thriving plan- 
tation of larch and Scotch fir. On the south side, which belongs 
to the parishes of Aberlemno and Rescobie, there are some steep 
cliffs, covered with a kind of grayish moss. Near the top, there 
is very good pasture for cattle. 

The soil of the parish is in general of a clayey retaining nature, 
having what is commonly termed a " pan " bottom. Marl, which 
is obtained from the neighbouring parish of Rescobie, has been 
used, but is not found equal to lime. The distance from the latter 
article forms a considerable drawback to cultivation here. Much 
of the surface-water has been removed by draining, and the soil is 



294 FOUFAIISHIRE. 

in consequence improved; but were lime more easily obtained, a 
still greater improvement would be effected. 

Mr Ford, the late proprietor of Finhaven, made an unsuccessful 
attempt several years ago to find coal in the parish It has already 
been mentioned, that in the east end of the parish a bornig was 
executed to the depth of 160 feet, but that it faded. This attempt 
cost about L. 150. But even this was not without its advantages. 
A quarry of excellent freestone was thereby discovered m the neigh- 
bourhood, which is now regularly wrought, and which wiU prove ol 
very essential benefit to the lands of Finhaven. Major Wilkie has 
also opened a quarry near to this on his property of Newbarns, 
vhich will also be very advantageous to him m the improvements 

he is now carrying on. 

Botam, —There is an old tradition, and I believe it to be pei- 
fectly correct, that a great part of the parish was at one time co- 
vered with a forest, called the Forest of Platon, which extended 
from Finhaven Castle to Kirriemuir. It was prooably a royal 
hunting forest. The names of some of the farms in the parish 
seem to indicate this ; « King's Seat," « Forester's Seat Birk- 
enbush," " Drakemire," " Wolf-law." The forest has long smce 
disappeared; but the roots of hard-wood trees have been dug up 
lately in several places where the forest is supposed to have been. 
Within the last forty years, plantations have been executed on a 
very considerable scale, to the extent of 700 acres. These consist 
principally of larch, spruce, and Scotch fir, and are m part distri- 
buted in belts, and give to the parish a rich and covered appeal- 

'This parish was at one time celebrated for containing the larg- 
est tree in Scotland. This was a chestnut that grew beside he 
old Castle of Finhaven. It was killed by the severe frost m the 
winter of 1740 ; but for twenty years, up to 1760, a great part of 
its trunk and branches remained standing. It was measured m the 
presence of some Justices of the Peace in 1745, and an attested 
Tpy o its measurement taken. When it was cut dcnvn, the late 
Mr Skene of Carraldstone caused a table to be made of the wood of 
the tree, on which there is an engraved plate of brass containing 
the following inscription and statements of its dimensions : 

« ThI able is made out of the chestnut tree which grew at Fm- 
. .n n Anus-shire, whose dimensions, as taken and attested bv 
of Srf the peace of that county on the .0th April

1 745, were as follow, although at that time the tree was mostly divest- 
ed of its bark, — being killed by the severe frost in the winter of 1 740 : 
" Root end of the trunk half a foot above ground, 42 feet, 8 in- 
ches ; middle of the trunk, 30 feet, 7 inches ; top of the trunk where 
the branches broke out, 35 feet, 9 inches ; the biggest branch, 
23 feet, 9 inches ; the smallest branch, 13 feet, 2 inches." From 
these measurements the tree would appear to have been upwards 
of 500 years old — most probably "planted at the time of the building 
of the castle — and, therefore, in truth, one of its " contemporary 
trees." The roots of it are still to be seen in the court-yard of 
the castle. The table is now in the possession of the Earl of Aboyne 
at Aboyne Castle. 

II. — Civil History. 

Antiquities. — This parish seems to have been a place of consi- 
derable importance in the earlier and later periods of the history 
of Scotland. Judging from the extent and magnitude of those 
military works, — Caledonian and Roman, — the remains of which 
are still visible in the parish, it must in early times have been the 
residence of some very powerful tribes. These works always bear 
a proportion to the strength and resources of the people among 
whom they are situated ; and not only this parish, but the whole 
neighbourhood for many miles round, is rich with the traces of 
these ancient monuments of their power. 

Vitrified Forts.— The earliest and most conspicuous of these in 
the parish, is the celebrated vitrified fort, on the Hill of Finhaven. 
This hill, as has already been mentioned, rises to the height of about 
1500 feet above the level of the surrounding country, and com- 
mands a very rich and extensive prospect. The top of it is com- 
pletely occupied by a work evidently constructed upon military 
principles, so as completely to command all the points of access, 
and nowhere to permit the enemy to approach under cover. It is 
in the form of a parallelogram, extending from east to west by 
recent accurate measurement about 476 feet. At the east end the 
breadth is about 83 feet, and as the ascent is here easier than at 
other points, it is at the end defended by a sort of outwork ajjout 
52 feet distant from the wall. At about half the length of the 
whole, it widens considerably, and there are here the slight vesti- 
ges of an inner wall. Towards the west end, which is somewhat 
lower down the hill, the breadth is about 125 feet, and at this end 
there are the distinct traces of a well, which must have been made 



296 FOHFAllSHIUE. 



for the use of the garrison. It is now impossible to ascertmn the 
exact height and thickness of the walls, owing to the rubbish, both 
on the outer and inner sides, being covered with a thick crustnig 
of moss and turf. Even in their present state, however, they are 
in many places upwards of ten feet high above the ground. 

The masonry of these walls is now exposed m comparatively 
few places, owing to that covering of turf which has already been 
aotic'ed. But enough is visible to demonstrate that they rnust 
have been subjected to the action of a very powerful fire Indeed 
a stranger that knew nothing about the place, carefully looking at 
it, andlalking over it, could hardly fail to be struck with the ver 
different and unusual sound which the stones have under the feet. 
It is exactly the sound produced on walking over a heap of large 
cinders Large pieces of the walls, consisting of stones of different 
varieties, run together in a kind of imperfect -tHfication may he 
seen lying about. Some parts are more or less vitrified thai 
others, and several of the stones have been comparatively httle af- 
fected by the fire. Amongthese, mineralogists have discoveredseven 
or eight varieties of stone, which are not to be found on the hill 
at all and which must have been brought together for this purpose. 
The most fusible stones are placed indiscriminately m the wall 
with others, in order to bind them together. Jmieson s aes 
that the stones are placed in regular /l "J.,' 
they have been very irregularly affected by the fire. This, how- 
Z cannot be very distinctly ascertained m its l-se-t rmn u 
condition, when so much of it is completely concealed from the 

"t\as been maintained by some, that these vitrifications are 
merely the results of the great beacon fires, which were wont o 
be ighted up on the summits of those hills, to alarm the surround- 
inVtdbes, in the time of danger and invasion. It is hardly possi- 
bl however, to look at a work of such magnitude as d.e present 
on'the Hill of Finhaven, and hold this opinion. To suppose 
L a work of such extent as that which we have now described 
erected merely for the purpose of a

outworks for their defence, with a well for their use, and capable 
of resisting not only a sudden attack, but a lengthened siege. That 
it is one of the forts or strongholds of those early tribes, who in- 
habited the county about the time of the invasion of the Romans, 
seems to be put beyond all doubt. 

Analogous methods of building walls of great strength by the action 
of fire, among tribes as rude as they, have been discovered in Tartary 
and in India. The present is evidently one of a chain of forts, erect- 
ed in the heart of a rich and fertile territory for the defence of its 
inhabitants. From the walls of this fort may be seen, at a glance, 
the two strong fortresses on the Caterthun, lying to the north-east. 
To the west there is the fort on the Seedlay Hills, called Denoon 
Castle, about five miles beyond Forfar, along with the Barry Hill, 
in the parish of Meigle. These fortresses must be regarded as 
the strongholds of the population that dwelt in the rich vales be- 
low, and were, perhaps, the means of defending them, not only 
from foreign invasion, but also from the attacks and invasions of 
each other. 

Roman Camp.— In farther proof that such places as the pre- 
sent on the Hill of Finhaven were not mere signal stations, but 
the forts and strongholds of the early tribes, it may be men- 
tioned, that in the immediate neighbourhood of such, there is 
generally found a Roman camp of proportionate strength, placed 
so as to watch, to check, and to overawe them. This holds good 
here. On the low grounds, about two miles and a-half to the 
north-west, on the sloping banks of the Lemno, there are the re- 
mains of a Roman camp of very considerable magnitude. This is 
called the camp of Battledykes. The mean length of it is about 
2970 feet,— its mean breadth about 1850 feet. It encloses a space 
of about 80 acres, and is now the site of a well-cultivated farm 
called the farm of Battledykes. The prsetorium is the only part 
of It now visible ; and in trenching over some part of it lately, there 
were found some small urns, which are now in the possession of 
Mr Hillocks, factor on the estate of Finhaven. A coffin of stone 
was also found : and in the possession of the present incumbent 
there IS an iron instrument resembling the flourish of a flint or steel, 
which was found there on the same occasion. 

Judging from its size, this camp must have been a place of o-reat 
strength. The celebrated camp at Ardoch is not much above a 
third ot Its extent ; and, if the estimate be correct, that it was ca- 



l.-OllFARSlllllE. 

„aWe of contiiiuing 20,000 men, the camp at Battledykes must 
have contaiueJ more than Jouble that numbe,-. The stat.on here 
U indeed one of great importanee. It is situated at the entrance 
of the great valley of Strathmore, commanding the whole of the 
lowlands beneath the base of the Grampians ; and at the same 
time it guardsthepassesof the Highlands through the netghbourmg 
vallevs of Glen Isla, Glen Prosen, and Glen Clova. Th.s camp 
at Battledykes communicated with the camp at A'doch, by means 
of the Roman Iter, which passed through the parish 
no traces of this Iter now to be seen here. In Mattland s H.sto 
of Scotland, it is stated, that, about a hundred years ago, John 
Webster, L farmer of Battledykes, turned up with the plough 
the foundation of the road in divers parts in its course through the 
'In " Passing through the camp, the Iter contmued ,ts progress 
hZoni eleven miles in an east-north-east directiou on the south 
si of the Esk, under the fort of the hill of Fmhaven, and across 
the moor of Brechin, till it came to another camp at Wardyke . 
This latter camp was so placed as to command he tor of Gate - 
Ihun The camp at Battledykes communicated also by a sma - 
ler Iter with another camp at Haerfanlds, about eight miles distant, 
which commanded the whole entrance of Forfarshire

lonstan ly must they have' been reminded of the presence of the,

fully situated on a bank of the south side of the Lemno, which 
runs immediately at the foot of the castle. There is now remain- 
ing of it little more than the two sides of a high square tower, 
much rent and shattered. It does not appear to have been at any 
time of great extent. The period of its erection is quite uncer- 
tain. No dates are anywhere visible on its walls, but it most pro- 
bably belongs to the twelfth century. 

This castle is chiefly conspicuous in the history of our country, 
as the residence of that Earl of Crawford who took such an active 
part in the conspiracies which were formed during the turbulent 
reign of James II., and who, from his ferocity, was commonly cal- 
led the " Tiger Earl." The iron spokes on which he used to 
hang his prisoners are still to be seen on the castle walls. In the 
year 1445, during the lifetime of the old Earl, his father, he was 
engaged in a desperate feud with the Ogilvies of Inverquharity, — a 
family belonging to the neighbouring parish. He had held for 
some time the office of Justiciar or High Bailie of the Abbey of Ar- 
broath ; but the peaceful monks having found the " Tiger" some- 
what obstreperous in his conduct, deposed him, and elected Ogilvy 
of Inverquharity Justiciar in his stead. This was the occasion 
of the quarrel. The Ogilvies were joined by the Earl of Huntly, 
who, being at that time on a visit at Inverquharity, was obliged to 
take part with his host, in conformity to an old law of Scottish 
hospitality, which obliged every visitor to do so as long as his last 
meal was undigested in his stomach. The two clans of the Lind- 
says and Ogilvies accordingly encountered near Arbroath. The 
old Earl of Crawford, wishing even at that late hour to avert the 
strife, galloped up between the lines to confer with the opposing 
party, but was accidentally slain by a soldier, who did not know 
him, and who was enraged at any one thus meddling to mar the 
combat. The Crawfords, now infuriated at the death of the Earl, 
fell upon the Ogilvies with increased desperation, broke their 
ranks, and scattered them in great disorder. The latter resisted 
so strongly that they were almost cut to pieces, and 600 men, in- 
cluding many of the Barons of Angus, were left dead upon the 
held. The Crawfords afterwards pillaged the lands of the Ogil- 
vies, burned their castle, and took captive their women and chHd- 

ran

In the year 1447, the Tiger Earl joined in a league with the 
n-aris ot Douglas and Ross, with the intention of opposing the

Earl of Huntly, at that time commander of the royal army, on 
his passage over the Grampians. They met in an engagement 
near Brechin, where the Earl and his party were completely de- 
feated. The principal cause of the defeat was the desertion of 
the laird of Balnamoon with 300 men, dm-ing the eat of the con- 
test The Earl was hotly pursued to the Castle of Fmhaven, 
where, when he entered, he gave vent to his rage and mortifica-

years' torment to have gained the honour, which had that day fal- 
len to his old enemy the Earl of Huntly. . • i 

The Castle of Finhaven was afterwards the scene of a singular 
snectacle which, in its mixture of meanness and magnificence, is 
/e y cSalristic of the times. Being completely humbled by 
the battle of Brechin, the Tiger Earl thought it best to submit o 
h s sovereign, and to sue for reconcihation. With a view of strik- 
ing terror into the hearts of the Earl and the other turbulent nobles 
and barons in this quarter, James II. came with the royal army into 
Angus-shire. Accompanied by several noblemen aiid gentlemen, 
the once proud Earl came forth from the Castle of Finhaven, bare- 
headed, and clad in sackcloth, like one guilty of a geat crime, and 
in this flight threw himself on the road before the Kmg falling on 
hi knees: weeping and beseeching him to forgive him his offence 
alns b m. The old historian, Lindsay of Pitscottie has put a 
lo'Tspeech in his mouth, recounting all that his family had for- 
Lfly done for the state. The historian adds that when the Ea.l 
Tad ended, the noblemen and gentlemen of Angus he d up the 
hands to the King, most solemnly crymg for mercy, till, as he 
Lys n hi old quSnt graphic language, " their sobbing and sigh- 
ng cuttedtheir'words so sore, that almost their very prayers could 
not be understood." The consequence of all this piece of p ge- 
an try, for such it was on both sides, was, that the King absolved 
hh7f om his crime of lese-majesty, and restored him to his dignity. 
The King was then brought by the Earl to the Castle of Finhaven, 
and was there « banquetted right magnificently. 

TL castle was on another occasion the scene of g-at festivity.

Land-owners, S-c. — The estate of Finhaven has passed out of 
the family altogether. In the year 1635, we find a retour grant- 
ed in favour of Lord KinnouU, making over to him the whole of 
the lands and barony of Finhaven. From a notice in the acts of the 
Parliament of Scotland, of the year 1686, we find it at that time 
in the possession of Sir James Carnegie, a branch of the North- 
esk family. In the year 1 728, James Carnegie, then Laird of Fin- 
haven, was indicted for the murder of the Earl of Strathmore, and 
as in this trial, through the manly confidence and overpowering 
eloquence of Dundas of Arniston, counsel for the prisoner, jury- 
men for the first time shook off their timidity, and emancipated 
themselves from the intimidation then exercised by government, 
I may be pardoned for mentioning the circumstances of the case. 
On the 9th May 1728, the Earl of Strathmore, Mr Carnegie of 
Finhaven, and Mr Lyon of Brigton, happened to be present at a 
funeral in Forfar, and as in those days intemperance in drinking 
was very common even on such occasions, these gentlemen with 
some others had indulged rather freely in liquor before the inter- 
ment, and after the ceremony adjourned to a tavern. Here Mr 
Lyon of Brigton abused and insulted Carnegie with the most im- 
pertinent language, and after coming to the street, pushed him into 
the kennel. On recovering himself, Carnegie drew his sword, with 
the intention of taking immediate vengeance on the Laird of Brig- 
ton, and was in the act of aiming a thrust at him, when the Earl of 
Strathmore, stepping in between them, received the sword of Car- 
negie in his body, and died in the course of forty-nine hours. 

Previous to this trial, the verdicts of jurymen had uniformly been 
proven or not proven ; but now they found Carnegie not guilty, by 
a majority of twelve to three. This same James Carnegie, laird of 
Finhaven, appears afterwards to have been out with Prince Charles 
in 1745, and, notwithstanding these crimes, he kept possession of 
the estate till his death. The last laird of this name died atXisbon 
m 1775, and the estate was purchased at a judicial sale in Edin- 
burgh by the Earl of Aboyne, for the sum of L. 19,500. It was 
sold by one of this family in 1805, to Mr Ford for L. 45,000. It 
was again purchased in 1815, by the present Earl of Aboyne, for 
the sum of L. 65,000. 

Major Wilkie, H. E. I. C. of Newbarns, being the only resi- 
dent landed proprietor in the parish, may next be noticed. This 
property at one time belonged to the Honourable Thomas Lyon, a 



3Q2 FORFARSHIRE. 

branch of tl,o SU athmore family. It was then called Auchinday; 
when purchased by the present proprietor's father, the name was , 
chan.,ed to Newbarns. It has undergone very considerable rm- 
' o ements since it became the property of Mr W,lk.e, and the 
TreLnt spirited proprietor shows an excellent taste for carrying out 
Te tpro— o his property. Besides these two landowners 
there are five others who have property .n the pansh:--Mr Lyall

stated to have be'en nearly the same for several years past. At that 
time it stood thus : males, 217 ; females, 213; total, 430. From 
the year 1805 to 1815, the population decreased, principally owing 
to Mr Ford, at that time proprietor of Finhaven, taking the farms 
into his own hand for the purposes of improvement. Since that 
time, however, it has been on the increase, partly in consequence 
of the establishment of a spinning manufactory in the parish. 
The present population is 533, and may be stated thus : —

There is only one heritor of independent fortune resident in the 
parish, viz. Major Wilkie, H. E. I. C. of Newbarns. There are 
six proprietors of land of the yearly value of L. 50 and upwards. 

Character of the People.— In the appendix to the last Statistical 
Report, Mr Raiker, the latest incumbent but one, who was minister 
of the parish for sixty-three years, describes the people as being 
sober, frugal, and laborious. He states, " We have neither 
brewers nor beggars, nor bastards, nor bankrupts, nor idlers, nor 
drunkards; every family brews their own beer; no sectaries." 
The character of the people is still sober, frugal, and laborious ; 
but, with respect to the other statements of the reverend gentle- 
man, I cannot say that they all hold good at the present day. It 
may be added, however, that there is no poaching, nor smuggling, 
nor pawnbroking. The people, in general, are cleanly ; and, with 
respect to most of the comforts of life, they have partaken in that 
progressive improvement which is now so general over the land. 
They are better clothed, better lodged, and better fed, than for- 
merly. Their fare is the common fare in this quarter of the 
country ; — the different preparations of oatmeal, sometimes flour-

bread, potatoes, and butcher-meat occasionally. On the whole, 
they seem contented and happy with their lot. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Econoviy.—The number of acres in the 
parish, either cultivated or occasionally in tillage, is 2850. The 
land under wood may amount to about 900 acres, besides which 
there are about 120 lying in a state of waste. The total number 
of acres in the parish thus amounts to 3870. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of arable land is about L, 1, 
3s. per acre. The average rent of grazing joer ox or cow is L. 1, 
12s. ; per ewe or full-grown sheep, 8s. 

Rate of Wages.— The yearly wages of farm-servants is from 
L. 10 to L. 12, with their meal and milk. Daily wages, winter 
and summer, about Is. 7d. 

Price of Raw Produce, 4.— The average price of wheat for the 
last seven years has been L. 2, 16s. 6d. ; of barley, L. 1, 10s., and 
oats L. 1, 3s.,. all per imperial quarter; potatoes, per boll, 32 
stones 9s. ; hay per stone, 6d. ; butter per lb. 7id. ; cheese 
per stone, 5s. ; eggs per dozen, 5d. ; mason work per rood, all 
materials supplied, L. 1, 12s. ; carpenter work per day, 2s. 3d. 

Live-Stock.—ThQ common breed of cattle in this parish is the 
black Angus-shire. There are but few sheep, and these of the 
common black-face, with a few of the Cheviot, Leicester, and 

South Down breeds. 

Husbandry.— The general character of the husbandry m this 
parish is now excellent,— the tenants being all bound to a rotation 
to suit the quality of the land. All the waste land, in any respect 
fit for tillage, is improved; and all the arable land is properly 
drained, or in process of being drained, by sewers, not less than 
five feet deep, and by open ditches of a proper depth, to tate off 
the water from the covered drains. There are about three or four 
miles of embankments on the Rivers Esk and Lemno, to prevent 
them overflowing the adjacent grounds. The general duration of 
leases is nineteen years, and this is supposed to be the most favour- 
able term for the tenant. Farming, on the whole, is carried on in 
the parish after the most approved plan. Since 1 805, few parishes 
have made a more visible improvement in husbandry than Oath- 
law, and previous to this few were more backward. 

Improvements.— Withm the last thirty years, much waste land 
has been reclaimed, and a great deal of draining has been execut- 



OATHLAW OR FINAVON. 305 

ed under the encouragement of the principal proprietor. The 
state of farm-buildings and enclosures is now very good. The en- 
closures chiefly consist of thorn hedges, which are calculated to 
be of not less than 75 miles in extent upon the estate of Fin- 
haven ; and Major Wilkie, on his property of Newbarns, pays 
equal attention to this kind of ornamental enclosures. During 
the time that the estate of Finhaven was in the possession of Mr 
Ford, it underwent very considerable improvement both on the 
arable and the waste lands. Many ornamental belts of wood were 
then made on waste lands, and the present proprietor, the Earl of 
Aboyne, has followed up these improvements, of draining and 
planting, under the personal superintendence of Mr Hillocks, for 
many years his Lordship's factor, — he having planted upwards of 
80,000 trees, so that now there are upwards of 750 acres of plan- 
tations on the estate. 

The principal obstacle to improvement in the parish is the great 
distance from lime and manure; — Montrose, the nearest sea port 
town, being 16 miles distant. Every encouragement to improve- 
ment has been offered by the Earl of Aboyne, by giving both lime 
and manure to many of his tenants during the first six or seven 
years of their leases, — by binding himself to open up drains where 
necessary, — and by enclosing with paling those fields where the 
hedges do not form a sufficient fence. And, it may be remarked, 
that he has built excellent houses and steadings for the comfort 
and advantage of his tenantry, — the tenants in such cases being 
only required to make good the carriages. 

Quarries. — Another circumstance which has contributed to the 
improvement of the parish has been the opening up of that quar- 
ry of freestone which has been already alluded to. Until this was 
discovered, the parish was but ill supplied with building stones,— 
the nearest quarries at that time being at Forfar and Kirriemuir. 
This has greatly tended to make the houses and steadings in the 
parish more substantial, comfortable, and neat in their appearance 
than they formerly weVe. 

Fisheries.— There are no fisheries in the parish. The Esk for- 
merly abounded with salmon in this part : but, as is stated in the 
old Statistical Account, there are now few to be found. A very 
few are now and then killed with the rod. 

Spinninff-MilL—Wkhm the last few years a spinning-mill has 
been erected in the parish, which employs about 60 hands. In 



306 FORFARSHIRE. 

reference to the number of hours, and other particulars, they - are 
of course under the operation of the late Act of Tarhament. The 
health of those employed in them is hx general good, and the wages 
which they receive are quite sufficient to secure them the comforts 
of life, if they were managed with proper care. It is, however, a 
matter of regret that famihes who receive so much for their labour 
should make such a bad use of it. It is melancholy to see the 
misery that often is amongst them, arising from habits of intempe- 
rance and prodigality, with all the other evils that proceed from 
these sources, such as husbands deserting their wives and families 
There is certainly no necessary connection between this kind ot 
labour and habits of intemperance and mismanagement, and it is 
to be hoped that, in the course of time, a progressive improvement 
will be witnessed amongst them. 

Produce.— Ayevage gross amount of raw produce raised in the 
parish, as nearly as can be ascertained : — / 

Wheat, 493 qrs. at L. 2, 16s. 6d. - - o 

Barley, 13361 qrs. at L. 1, 10s. - - IJ

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Towns.— There is at present no market or market-town 
in the parish. In the acts of the Parliament of Scotland 1686, 
there is a warrant granted to Sir James Carnegie of Fmhaven, to 
hold two free fairs at the Kirk town of Finhaven, yearly, together 
with a weekly market there. These seem to have fallen mto dis- 
use, as there is now nothing of the kind in the parish. The near- 
est market-town- is Forfar, distant rather more than four mdes. 

Means of Communication.— There is no post-office here, but a 
daily runner from Forfar to Brechin passes through the parish. 
There are three public coaches that pass and repass during the 
dav There are four miles of turnpike road in the parish m ex- 
cellent order. There is one bridge over the Esk, and there are 
five small bridges over the Lemno, all in good condition, and exe- 
cuted within the last twenty-five years. 

Ecclesiastical State.-The parish church is a neat modern build- 



OATHLAW OR FINAVON. 307 



ing with a tower, situated ahnost in the centre of the parish: it is very 
conveniently placed for all parts of the population, the furthest ex- 
tremity of the parish not being much above three miles distant. It 
was built in 1815, and, save that the walls are in some places rather 
leaky, it is otherwise in very good repair. It contains accommo- 
dation for upwards of 200 sittings. There are no seats set apart for 
the poor, — indeed the whole is too small for the population. A pe- 
tition was presented to the session about six months ago, signed 
by forty individuals, requesting accommodation in the church, and 
the Earl of Aboyne has given his consent to have a gallery erect- 
ed at the west end, which it is expected will be accomplished this 



spring 



The manse was built in 1814, and received an enlargement in 
1833. The glebe was formerly about seven acres and a half in 
extent, arable land. When a commonty was divided many years 
ap-o in the west extremity of the parish, a portion of this was set 
■ for the minister, amounting to about eight acres. As this 
i., 'onsiderable distance, it was comparatively of little value 
to any mc . bent. An arrangement has, however, been lately made, 
by which this portion of commonty belonging to the minister has 
been excambed for a portion of arable land, amounting to two 
acres and a half, and adjoining the rest of the glebe. The glebe 
is, therefore, now about ten acres of arable land. The amount of 
the stipend is L. 155, 7s. 6d. in money, including the sum given 
for communion elements, and 6 bolls, 3 firlots meal, and 2 pecks 
I lippy barley. ' 

Divine service is on the whole well attended ; and when the ad- 
dition of a gallery is made, it will conduce much to the comfort of 
the parishioners, and take away that excuse which some are apt to 
make, that they cannot attend public worship, as they have no 
seat in church. The number of famihes attending the Establish- 
ed church may be stated to be 40; persons , of all ages, 200; and 
the average number of communicants about 200; of Dissenting 
mdmduals there are in the parish, 2; Seceders, 5; Episcopalian 
•J; and Roman Catholics, 4. r r 

tlof on IZT" March 1833, the parish received a benefac-

parish to be called " Hanton's Bequest;" the interest of the mo-

In the old Statistical Account of the parish, Mr Raiker has 
stated, that the average number of poor in the parish at that time 
was 2. This- statement seems to have been doubted in some 
quarter, for in the Appendix, Vol. xxi. p. 58, he says, " To satisfy 
you concerning the number of our paupers, — that we have no more 
than two receiving charity, is a certain fact, both old women and 
widows : and what is still more, one of these does not properly be- 
long to us, but to a neighbouring parish, and came to reside with 
a daughter married to a labouring man here." , He adds the rea- 
son for this, which we have quoted above ; and continues, " We 
have a family or two with a number of young children that we 
occasionally relieve with small sums, and it is sometimes with 
difficulty that they can be prevailed upon to accept of them, but 
no longer than they can do for themselves, which is often at a very 
early age." 

We cannot help stating, that it is matter of high satisfaction to 
find that the same disposition not to be burdensome to the parish 
stdl prevails. As a proof of this honourable trait in the people's 
character, it may be mentioned, that one man, several years aao 
bemg under the necessity of removing to Dundee to undergo the 
operation of lithotomy, the parish contributed several pounds to 
assist him; and the operation having been successful, he, after re- 
suming work, repaid the whole into the funds, though, from its hav- 
ing been bestowed as a gift, this was neither wished nor expected. 

Alehouse An alehouse has been established in the parish since 
the date of the former Account. The tenant and his whole fa- 
mily are among the most sober, quiet, and industrious individuals in 
the parish; but this much I am bound to notice, that all such houses 
m the neighbourhood of spinning-mills or large works of any l.d 
tend to keep up and cherish those habits of intemperance I h 
may have been previously formed in towns and larg communis: 
I s also a general observation, that all such houses are too highly 
rented, especially if there be land attached to them; and thk is 
by no means conducive to their regularity, or to the benefit so- 
cietj in their neighbourhood. 

Although peat is found in abundance in the neighbour- 
ng parishes, there is comparatively little here. The moss o B

Miscellaneous Observations. 
In the present depressed state of agriculture, the farmers hav- 
ing great difficulty in paying their rents, the Earl of Ahoyne at 
the last collection, being for crop and year 1833, was pleased to 
accept of the rents according to the fiars prices of the gram, by 
which means the tenantry received a reduction in their money

PRESBYTERY OF BRECHIN, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. DAVID HARRIS, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name.— The word Fearn or Fern is said to signify in Gaelic 
ihe alder tree. 

Extent, 4-c.—The parish is situated on the western extremity 
of the presbytery of Brechin, at almost a central distance of eight 
Hides from Brechin, Forfar, and Kirriemuir. Its form is nearly 
elliptic, and the extent may be estimated at 7 miles by the longer 
axis, and 3 by the shorter. On the south-west, it is bounded 
throughout, by the parish of Tannadice ; on the north, by the 
united parish of Lethnot and Navar ; and on the east, by Men- 
muir and Careston, 

Topographical Appearances, 8fc.— As viewed from the south the 
parish exhibits a south-westerly exposure of one spacious slope, 
rising from the valley of Strathmore to the first summit of the 
Grampians, with little variation of surface ; but as we enter upon 
an actua survey, we discover this apparent uniformity to arise from 
two parallel ridges, the one rising above the other, and embosom- 
ing two tracts of valley ground, the first, generally adapted to the 
purposes of agriculture, and the second, or most northerly, to pas- 
turage. The Cruik, which collects its waters immediate'y under 
the sumnnt of the Grampians, issues into the lower grounds by a 
break in the uppermost of the two subordinate ridges, and flows 
th. ughout Its tame and monotonous course, without Lost a shrub

lions, it would be hazardous to offer a conjecture on the tempera- 
ture or humidity of the atmosphere. It may be noticed, however, 
that, from the disposition of the high grounds m the adjacent coun- 
try, the proportion of rain is rather less than what alls in any of 
the neighbouring districts. This is often specia ly observable 
at times when the atmosphere is charged with electric clouds. 
Du i: and the vernal months, the wind blows frequent y 
cold and stormy from the north. From the configuration of the 
mountainous region, and the great deficiency of wood, the parish is 
Tceergly exposed to these squalls; but otherwise the climate 
is very agLeatle. Little or no inconvenience is felt from hoar- 
frosts or mildew, and the population is equally exempted from 
such complaints as are connected with a stagnant and putrid at- 

Geology and Miner alogy.-H has been already observed, that 
the true topography of the parish is strongly marked by two ridges 
running parallel to the great chain of the Grampians. To assign 
300 fet for the elevation of the first, 700 for the second and 
1400 for the Grampian summits on the north, is thought to be an 
estimate sufficiently correct. The southern slope of the first ridge 
under a variable depth of rich and productive soil, is composed of 
sandstone dipping to the north at an angle of forty degrees, inter- 
pet d with' sometimes in nodules, and sometimes e.- 
hib L a slight appearance of stratification From the summit 
o tS-idge, a to the middle of the opposite slope, 

o what is p operly called the Brae of Fearn, there mtervenes an 
immense body of argillaceous rock of a deep ferruginous colour, 
IxS ng U appearance of stratification, and extendmg many 
ttZ and we'st. This species of rock is known m the couivry 
Ty he name of kalm. It is generally decomposed by an expo u 
of a few months, and converted into a free and rich mould. As we 
ascend the second ridge, another sandstone appears, coarsely gra- 
M dipping reversely to the southern mass, at an angle vary- 
Tntl fifty to fifteen degrees, and regularly diminishing its dip 

breast-work before a mountainous range of clay-slate. i ne i 
i us slate has been repeatedly tried, but therto  
be unprofitable. It is not known that, throughout all this s.nei

of minerals, any vestige of organic remains has ever been dis- 
covered. 

Zoology. — No quadruped or bird is known to belong to the pa- 
rish, which is not common. Grouse abounds in the hills, and 
black-cock also, in one particular district. A breed of pheasants 
was introduced not long ago, but it is thought to be now nearly 
extinct. A solitary specimen of the Bohemian chatterer, as was 
believed, appeared some years ago in the depth of winter; and as 
soon as seen was shot and transmitted to Kinnaird, for preservation. 

Similar observations are applicable to the botanical field. We 
know of nothing in any of these departments which we can call

Lajid-oioners.— Among ive heritors, the proprietor of the Barony 
of Fearn holds pre-eminent rank, as possessing at least four-fifths 
of the whole parish. One small farm is the property of the Riffht 
Honourable the Earl of Fife.  

Mansion-houses—These properties have no mansion-houses. 
Ihe other three proprietors are in possession of substantial 
and suitable mansions. On one of these Auchnacree the

tility may soon be expected to spring up out of a bleak and rugged 
solitude. Another Deuchar in possession of higher natural ad- 
vantages has been judiciously laid out, and begins to appear or- 
namental to the neighbourhood. The third Noranside seems

suitable reward for his services. The Earl rather unseasonably 
declined, and history informs us that Crawford's defeat, and the 
subsequent fall of his party, were chiefly attributable to CoUessie's 
desertion upon that account. 

Family of Deuchar. — Few families can establish such pretensions 
to antiquity as belong to the Deuchars, late of that Ilk. It might be 
almost regularly ascertained that the family inheritance had passed 
through a succession of lineal heirs, without increase or diminution, 
throughout a period of more than five hundred years. One of the 
ancestors of this family fell at Harlaw, and, as a proof that he was 
not untouched with the spirit which marked the character of that 
bloody field, his sword was so firmly grasped in death, that it was 
necessary to cut away the hand before it could be severed from 
the sword. The sword, as a relique, is still in possession of the 
representative of the family, but the patrimony was alienated about 
eighteen years ago. 

Families of Gillies and Tytler. — As allied to the talented fami- 
lies of the Gillies and Ty tiers, we cannot allow our connection with the 
learned world to be undervalued. The ancestor of the Gillies ap- 
pears to have emerged into public life by the friendship of Mr Wemyss 
of this parish, was domiciled two years in the parish, and afterwards 
became minister of Careston. Of Mr Tytler's family, two inheri- 
ted their father's taste for literary acquirements. Henry, the young- 
est of these, was much distinguished for his classical knowledge, 
and can be mentioned as the first of the Scottish school who ventu- 
red to give to the public a metrical version of a Greek ode. It would 
be difficult to name that branch of literature or science with which 
James, the oldest, had not made himself acquainted. Of this, he 
gave the most ample evidence in his diversified labours for the 
second edition of the British Encyclopaedia. In that work, it is 
believed that no hand was more largely engaged lhan his, and 
that, too, m almost every department. From the self-denying 
habits of the man, and many disastrous occurrences in his life, his 
talents were nearly unprofitable to himself, and he died an exile 
in Massachussets. 

rpi . Ill- — Population. 

Ihe parish, lying chiefly on the verge of the inland country, at a 
great distance from any great market-town, and without an inter- 
mediate village, the habits of the population may be regarded as com- 
pie eiy rural, rhe only places of common resort are the parish church 
ana school. We have no tavern, no news-room, no lodge, no clubs 



316 FORFARSHIRE. 

and no special association, civil, social, or religious, which we can 
call our own. The farmer, temperate and industrious in his habits, 
is commonly a-stir by the early hour of four during the" summer 
months, and both takes and allows a short relaxation about noon. 
His board is generally served from the produce of his farm. The 
cottar, if a spademan, is a day-labourer at Is. 8d. per day, without 
maintenance, and has a preference of his master's work ; if a horse- 
man, he is engaged by the year, on terms varying from L. 10 to 
L. 12, with his house, garden, and maintenance, viz. L. 8 or two 
pecks 'of oatmeal per week, with a liberal allowance of milk. Bo- 
thies, which at one time were common, are now little known. In 
winter, female industry is almost unavailable. From the commence- 
ment of spring until in-gathering time is ended, all hands are at work. 

That the population has decreased, within the last century, to the 
extent of nearly two-thirds, is attested by a few old parishioners, 
and visibly confirmed in many instances by vestiges of ruined cot- 
tages, overgrown with nettles and briers, and in others by one so- 
litary plane, or by clusters of aged as-h trees disposed in square or- 
der, with which the corn- fields are still interspersed. The cause of 
decrease cannot be matter of doubt. It is attributable only to the 
progress of husbandry ; and to the eye which strictly is directed to the 
practical result, it must be visible that, in the transition from one 
extreme, there is a dangerous tendency to the other. The extensive 
farmer may be the more ostensible man abroad ; but, at home, his 
less aspiring neighbour does his work with more economy, main- 
tains a better feeUng, and diffuses better habits throughout his 
whole establishment, moves progressively on, with more personal 
comfort, and in a surer path, and ultimately reaps a more sohd ad- 
vantage. 

The great disproportion of births to deaths is rather remark- 
able, but can be very satisfactorily accounted for. Eleven per an- 
num is rather an under statement for births, while the deaths are 
overrated at eight. Young married men are generally preferred 
for horse- work; and when deprived by age of the requisite ac 
tivity, they migrate with their families in quest of more suitable 
employment. The proportion is also aflFected by the demand for 
term servants being greater than the parochial population can sup- 
ply. Of marriages no average can be given.

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — After setting apart 170 acres as a full complement 
for plantations and woodlands of every description, the parish at pre- 
sent is parcelled out into 16 farms, varying from 50 to 300 acres of 
arable surface, with their several proportions of moor, hill, or open 
pasture. L. 2 Sterling may be stated as the common rent of ordi- 
nary soils. The quality of the open pasture is so variable, that 
its value is commonly determined in cumulo. No vestige of an 
ancient village is to be seen in the parish, nor any thing to warrant 
anticipations of such an erection for a long time to come. Near- 
ly the whole population may, therefore, be comprised under the 
limited classification of farmer and cottar. 

In the face of many difficulties, the farmers still maintain the 
credit of that respectable order of men, and prosecute their work 
with great perseverance, and much aptness to avail themselves of 
every improvement which their own experience may suggest, or 
which may be gathered from the experience of others. The soil, 
consisting generally of a free rich loam, is well adapted to the 
turnip husbandry ; and with the combined advantages of their open 
pastures, and the early and plentiful herbage which belongs to 
this species of agriculture, they devote much of their attention to the 
rearing of live-stock, and bringing it to market in full condition. 
To estimate one-third of the farmer's means as depending on this 
branch of his resources, is not overrating its value. Were he to 
limit himself entirely to his own rearing, the aggregate of the pa- 
rish would then furnish, as nearly as a general estimate can de- 
termine, 210 bestial 34 stone each, and 330 sheep all in high 
condition for the butcher. The introduction, of late years, of bone- 
dust manure, has contributed greatly to promote this branch of 
husbandry, and bids fair to afford still more extensive advantages. 
It can scarcely be said that horses are reared for the market. The 
stock maintained for the farmer's use, though not of the heaviest 
description, is active and well adapted for his work. 

Wheat, barley, and oats, are almost the only kinds of grain 
ever sown. Rye is very rarely to be seen. Of the pulse crops, 
beans have been very little proved, and pease of all kinds are es 
teemed unprofitable. On account of the heavy carriage, potatoes 
can scarcely be said to be cultivated for the market. 



318 



FORFABSIIIRE. 



In the management of the arable soil, according to the present 
usage, the most experienced farmer approves of seven years for a 
full rotation, three in grass, followed by two grain crops, com- 
monly oats in succession, a turnip crop, and then barley, with 
which the field is again sown down for grass, with two bushels of 
rye-grass seed, six pounds of red clover seed, and two of white. 
After a full allowance for seed, meal, and horse-corn, the free 
marketable product of the whole parish may be estimated at three 
thousand quarters, one-eighth wheat, three eighths barley, and the 
remainder oats. 

Within the last twenty-five years, the buildings of the parish 
have undergone a complete change, and the means of domestic 
comfort have been thereby greatly increased. Nearly one-half of 
the farmers were then lodged in low houses, with an earthen or some- 
times a stone floor, and these not always provided with a third 
apartment; or if the means had been found by others of raismg 
their houses to the elevation of a second story, the elevation was 
so small, and the construction so defective, as to leave little for 
their neighbours to envy, who felt themselves obliged to live con- 
tented on terra firma. Their out-houses were of course in the 
same mean and rude condition. The change has been so com- 
plete, that, almost without an exception, every farmer is now in the 
possession of a comfortable dwelUng-house and a steading or court 
of offices, adequate to every purpose of rural convenience ; and in 
place of a hovel of stone and feal, no inconsiderable proportion 
of the cottars are already in the possession of a slated cottag, 
which, within the time referred to, might have been an ob- 
iect of desire to tenants responsible for a rent of several hundreds 
a year. It is agreeable to add, that this improvement on the cot- 
tar's abode has been marked with a corresponding improvement m 

his habits of life. . 

Beside a large allowance to be made for the more elevated lo- 
calities, there is a considerable proportion of waste ground in tlie 
middle district of the parish, and chiefly on what is called the 15a- 
ronv of Fearn. Whether these and similar wastes, spread out tar 
and wide over the country, ought to remain in their peseiU un- 
cultivated state, the framer of this Account presumes not to hazard 
an opinion,-farless to discuss the general but important ques on 
whether the hardy and industrious population vl.lch engr 
vear to year from their native land in quest of foreign settlement., 
Tight not, under due encouragement, find a resting-place at

home, atonce more to their own comfort and the best interests of the 
community. Some miles to the eastward, and upon a waste by no 
means inviting, a system of colonization has been adopted by Sir 
James Carnegy of Southesk, upon a liberal principle, which, it is 
believed, works well, and already begins amply to remunerate the 
proprietor. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication. — No line of turnpike passes through 
the parish, and the same may be said with regard to stage -coaches. 
Here it may be observed, that what usage makes familiar is no 
hardship, otherwise our pubUc roads would soon undergo a 
thorough reformation. The old tracks, to be sure, have undergone 
some alterations and nominal repairs, and these, sometimes for the 
better and sometimes for the worse. Did not the fact stand pro- 
minently forth, the assertion might be discredited, that on our 
southern line of communication with Brechin, on a distance of six 
miles, the two highest pinnacles in the country round must be re- 
gularly ascended and descended, and reversely, before we can go 
and return from our nearest post-town. The multitude of heavy 
carriages which are daily passing and repassing, the facility with 
which an eligible line of road might be found, and the moderate 
expense at which it might be executed, and the incalculable be- 
nefit which might be derived from the alteration, not merely as 
matter of local accommodation, but as beneficial to many neigh- 
bouring districts, — may well create surprise that a change so ne- 
cessary and advantageous should have been so long overlooked. 

Whins and broom are now in such overflowing abundance, and 
appear to be of such spontaneous growth, that we must take it for 
granted, that what we now see of these, our forefathers must al- 
ways have seen. If the following account can be trusted, the case 
must have been different. Some old men in the parish concur in 
asserting, that they can remember the time when neither a plant 
of the one nor of the other was to be met with, over the whole ex- 
panse of our moors, with the exception of one patch on the west- 
ern extremity of Drummer. A tradition is current in the neigh- 
bourhood, that a large herd of cattle, accompanying Graham of 
Dundee upon one of his expeditions from the south, rested for a 
night upon that spot, and that about three or four years after- 
wards, plants of both these kinds, formerly unknown on the Braes 
of Angus, were observed springing up. 

Ecclesiastical State and Education.— The parish church and

school stand nearly in the centre of the population, and are of easy 
access to almost every family. Together with all the other public 
buildings, they are comparatively of recent erection, and, with the 
exception of the church, in very tolerable repair. The minister's 
stipend may be stated in round numbers at 85 bolls of victual, 
and L. 85 SterUng, and the extent of the glebe at 10 acres. The 
schoolmaster's salary is modified at L. 28, with the legal house and 
garden. An old provision of 8 bolls of oatmeal is suspected to be 
irrecoverably lost. A mortification of 2 bolls continues to be 
paid, and is very available in cases of partial necessity. As the 
means of pubhc instruction may be considered to be fully ade- 
quate, it is thought sufficient to state generally, that the young, 
without exception, have the benefit of a good school education; 
and that the number of communicants for upwards of thirty years 
past has averaged 180.

wliat abruptly, forming afterwards a more gentle acclivity, till it 
reaches the extreme northern boundary of the parish, when the height 
above the level of the sea is 400 feet. On viewing the parish from the 
south, in passing Lunan Bay, the beholder is forcibly struck with 
its fine southern aspect, while he feels disappointment in the almost 
total want of trees, or even hedge-rows, to relieA'e the uninterrupted 
succession of cultivated fields. 

Along its eastern boundary, lie about a mile and a-half of sea- 
coast, forming part of Lunan Bay. The shore is sandy, with an 
occasional brake of small stones, among which are to be found, par- 
ticularly after a storm, or equinoctial tide, several beautiful varieties 
of sea shells, and some good specimens of onyx, pebble, and jas- 
per. The bay is one of the finest and most romantic in Scotland, 
forming a segment of about five miles ; at each extremity of which, 
there is about a mile of bold, rugged, and perpendicular rocks, ris- 
ing occasionally in pyramid-shaped columns of 100 or 150 feet. 
The intermediate three miles is a low sandy beach, bounded with 
hillocks overgrown with bent. 

The bay is deep and safe; the rocks on either side extending 
only a little way from the coast, and the surrounding lands being 
high, form a very sheltered, safe, and commodious retreat for the 
" sea-beaten bark," during all storms but those from the east. 

To the north and east of the parish, and forming its boundary in 
these directions, lies a beautifully romantic den, called Buckie Den. 
It extends about half a mile in length, and, sloping towards the sea 
It deepens rapidly as it advances. A small rapid rivulet runs along its 
bottom, which forms a number of small cataracts, varying in height 
from 20 to 30 feet. The sides of the den are, in some places, almost 
perpendicular, and covered with a variety of wild plants, particular- 
ly the cowslip and polyanthus in their season. 

Climate.— The climate of Lunan, if it were not for the cold 
evening breeze, which sets in from the sea, would, from its situation, 
be milder, perhaps, than that of most parts of the surrounding coun- 
try. As a proof of this, we have only to go a little farther up the 
river where the effects of the sea-breeze are not felt, and we find 
the climate so much improved, that harvest generally commences 
there about eight or ten days earlier than in almost any other part 
ol the county. '■

ing some miles up the country, which, however, do not appear to 
be prejudicial to health, or injurious to vegetable produce. 

11. — Civil History. 
Eminent Men.— It may here be interesting to record, that among 
the first who threw ofF the yoke of Popery, and espoused the doc- 
trines of the Reformation, we find the distinguished name of Mr 
Walter Mill, or, as he is commonly called. Sir Walter Mill, who, 
for forty years, discharged the pastoral duties of the parish of Lu- 
nan. Since the death of this martyr had a great moral influence 
in bringing about a decided change in the religious feelings and 
habits of the people of Scotland, it cannot be but interesting to 
trace his conduct, as far as history afl'ords us any intimations regard- 
ing it. His crime was the renunciation of the errors of Popery, 
more especially the mass. For this grievous offence, he was con- 
demned by Cardinal Beaton, along with Mr John Petrie, parish 
priest of the neighbouring parish of Inverkeilor, to suffer the pu- 
nishment that might be awarded to his crime, whenever he should 
be taken. Being at last apprehended, and brought into the pre- 
sence of the Bishop of St Andrews, the good old man, though en- 
feebled by age and oppression, yet maintained the utmost compo- 
sure and magnanimity. He addressed the Bishop with so much 
boldness, that his enemies were amazed. " I served the cure," 
said he, " twenty years before the Cardinal's time, with the appro- 
bation of all the parishioners ; but when the furious Cardinal perse- 
cuted me and many others for the preaching of God's word, I was 
constrained to keep myself quiet. I went about reproving vices, 
and instructing the people in the grounds of rehgion, for which 
cause I am now taken." 

As no one could be found to act in the capacity of judge in 
the case of this venerable personage, and as it seemed necessary to 
maintain, at least, a shew of justice, he was kept in confinement 
two days longer. The Bishop was at length reduced to the ne- 
cessity of ordering one of his own servants to perform this office, 
who, acting under the advice of his master, found him guilty of he- 
resy, and sentenced him to the flames. It is reported, that the ropes 
with which he was bound were taken from the Bishop's parlour ; 
the popular feeling being so strongly excited in his behalf, that no 
one could be found in the town who would sell ropes for that 
purpose. He ascended the pile with a cheerful countenance, and 
while the flames were closing around him, exclaimed, " ] trusUn 
God I shall be the last that shall suffer death in this land for this 



LUNAN. 



323 



cause." He died at the advanced age of eighty-two years ; and 
he was the last person who suffered martyrdom in Scotland for 
the cause of the Reformation. 

At the sight of this venerable martyr for the faith expiring in 
the flames, the popular feeling vented itself in bitter lamentations. 
The people were exceedingly moved by his unshaken fortitude and 
pious addresses. His martyrdom was the very death of Popery in 
the nation ; for the minds of men were so greatly inflamed, that, 
resolving openly to profess the truth, they solemnly bound them- 
selves by promises, subscriptions, and oaths, that if, henceforth, 
any one should be called in question for his religion, they should 
rise, as one man, and take arms in defence of their brethren 
against the tyrannous persecuting bishops. A monument has been 
erected to his memory in the church of Lunan. 
■ Another of the ministers of this parish, Mr Alexander Peddie, 
who died in 1713, bequeathed some plate for the communion ser- 
vice in the church of Lunan, on this very singular condition, that 
any Episcopal congregation, within seven miles of the parish, should 
have the use of the plate when they required it. It is said, that 
he wasamong the last surviving clergymen of the Episcopalian per- 
suasion in this part of the country, who refused to take the oaths 
of allegiance to the new Government; nevertheless, along with others 
in similar circumstances, he was allowed to remain in his charge 
without molestation. He was much respected by the Jacobite fa- 
milies in the neighbourhood, who came from various quarters to at- 
tend upon his ministry ; and it is handed down by tradition, that on 
the Sabbath day, a long line of carriages would have been seen ap- 
proaching the humble church of Lunan. It is, at least, certain, that, 
for several years, as appears from the presbytery records, the 
people, countenanced by the heritors, unanimously resisted the in- 
troduction of a Presbyterian clergyman, till strong measures were 
taken to eff"ect the settlement of a Mr Irvine, afterwards minister 
of Maryton. There is a marble monument erected in the church 
to the memory of Mr Peddie ; for upholding which, his widow left 
an annuity of L. 4 Scots, payable to the kirk-session by the town of 
Arbroath. 

The maternal ancestors of the Marquis of Breadalbane, from 
whom that nobleman inherits the valuable estate of Langton in Ber- 
wickshire, were originally natives of this parish. The place is still 
pointed out, where the grandfather of the present Marquis was 



324 



FORFARSHIRE. 



born ; and some memorials of the family are in possession of the 
minister. 

Land-owners.— The heritors of the parish are, the Right Ho- 
nourable the Earl of Northesk; William Taylor Imry, Esq. of 
Lunan ; and James Mudie, Esq. of Pitmuies, proprietor of the 
lands of Arbikie. The Earl of Northesk has about three- fifths of 
the valued rental of the parish; while the other two proprietors di- 
vide the remaining two-fifths between them, in nearly equal propor- 
tions,— the whole valued rent being L. 1550 Scots. 

By authentic documents of very ancient date, we find, that the 
lands presently in the possession of William Taylor Imry, Esq. 
were originally called the kirk lands of Inverlunan, and belonged 
to the Abbey of Arbroath. By charter, bearing date 21st July 
1544, these lands were given in feu by the Commendator and 
Chapter of the Abbey of Arbroath to John Lord Innermeath, and 
Elizabeth Beaton, his spouse, upon payment of a specified yearly 
feu-duty. By the Annexation Act 1587, these lands were annexed 
to the Crown. The feu-duties were afterwards, with other lands 
that belonged to the Abbey of Arbroath, erected into a temporal 
Lordship, in favour of James Marquis of Hamilton, from whom they 
passed into the possession of the Earls of Panmure ; they were 
forfeited in 1715,— purchased by the York Buildings Company,— 
repurchased by the late Earl of Panmure,— and finally disponed 
to the late William Imry, Esq. in 1767. 

It also appears, from the chartulary of the abbey, that the whole 
lands in the parish were originally abbey lands, the rental of which 
in the fifteenth century was follows :

Parochial Rec/isters.— The parochial registers commence in 
1654, on the admission of the Rev. Robert Bruce ; and, with some 
exceptions, have been kept with tolerable accuracy since that pe- 
riod It would appear from these records, that, in the early periods of 
our church, the kirk-sessions exercised a far more extensive control 
over the morals and habits of the people, than might be thought 
either expedient or beneficial in the present state of society. At 
the same time, it must be acknowledged, that it is chiefly owing

to their unwearied exertions in promoting the moral and religious 
improvement of those under their charge, that we are to attribute 
the distinguished character of the Scottish nation for piety and 
virtue. 

Antiquities. — At the influx of the Lunan into the German Ocean, 
and upon a small eminence on its southern bank, stand the ancient 
ruins of Redcastle, which, though not situated in this parish, may 
with propriety, be noticed, as evidently accounting for the names 
given to several places within the parish. William the Lion, who 
built the Abbey of Aberbrothock, and whose favourite daughter 
was married to Gilchrist, commonly called Lord Conan, whose es- 
tate lay in the neighbourhood, has been uniformly pointed out by 
tradition as the builder of this castle. Its dimensions are small, 
its walls thick and compactly built, and surrounded by a strong 
rampart of considerable height. As this castle is situated almost 
in the centre, and commands the whole of the bay of Lunan, it 
has naturally been supposed that King William had built it to 
prevent the incursions of the Danes, who frequently landed in the 
bay ; and an artificial mound of earth on the west side of the bay, 
called " the Corbie's Knowe," has been conjectured to have been the 
place where the sacred ensign of the Danes, distinguished by the 
emblem of a raven Scottice, corbie, was stationed ; or it may have 
superseded a Danish fort, for the eminence in question bears evi - 
dent marks of having been a fort long previous to the erection of 
the castle. Another tradition is, that it had been one of the King's 
hunting seats. It might have been both. All, however, agree, 
that it was a royal residence. And this tradition is fully borne out, 
not only by several charters from that monarch, in which one Berk- 
ley, a favourite of William, and who designates himself Lord 
Redcastle, subscribes as a witness, but also by the names of 
many of the surrounding places. We have in this parish Hawk- 
hill, where King William kept his hawks; Courthill, where his 
courts had been held; Cothill, where he kept his cattle; the Tom- 
au-raoid, the foundations of which were entire within these few 
years, and still recognized under the name of « Knap o' Castle," 
i. e. " the Castle Knap," where the prison or warding-place was si- 
tuated. And in the neighbouring parish of Inverkeilor, about 300 
yards south of the Tom- au- moid, we have the Gallowhill, still en- 
tire and complete; Ironshill, where the chains with which the cri- 
mmals were bound had been forged. 

Another remarkable feature in the antiquities of Lunan is the 



326 FORFARSHIllE. 

number of knaps which formerly existed in it, but which, owing to 
the superior cultivation of the ground, have now almost entirely 
disappeared. " Knap" is a Scoto-Gothic word signifying round 
or globe-shaped, and hence the name came to be applied to a 
round hillock. Until of late, a long line of these knaps could be dis- 
tinctly traced, running along from the sea to the highest point in 
the parish. Besides Knap o' Castle, there is Cotton Knap, Knap 
of Cothill, the two Knaps of Newton, Dale's Knap vulgarly cal- 
led Deil's Knap, and some others. In fact, almost every eminence 
seems to have had its knap. These knaps, so universal through- 
out Scotland, had been evidently used as beacons or signal posts, 
to give notice of alarm on the approach of an enemy. For 
this purpose, large fires were lighted up, and a line of k-naps in 
the direction of the enemy were, in a few hours, seen to blaze. 
That this was the use to which they were appropriated, tradition 
amply testifies; and it is farther proved by the large quantity of 
ashes which are found when any of them are demolished. It is 
difficult, however, to account for the knaps in this parish being all 
so near to each other. Almost every farm had its knap. It was 
a very ancient practice throughout the whole of Scotland and, in 
many places, it is still kept up, for the relations of the dead, the 
day after the funeral, to carry the chaff and bed-straw on which 
the person had died, to some hillock or knap in the neighbourhood 
of the house, and there burn them. It is probable, that these knaps 
had been used for that purpose, which would account for almost 
every farm town having its knap. 

The only other place in the parish which we shall mention, as 
connected with any antiquity, is Arbikie, which - 
west extremity of the parish. The name seems to be deiived 
from Alicco'n, tke Jgh little summit. A little to the west o 
th°s accordingly, there is a small conical artificial mount, wi h 
Ih th s onne'ct'jd a dorsum or ridge, about seven yards in breadth 
Ihich can be traced to the distance of 120 yards. A range of 
Httlf tluli, at equal distances, succeed. These - - th 
line with the ridge or dorsum, and extend about 800 yards. A 
t e behind, and'exactly opposite the termination of the dorsum 
another artificial cone, somewhat larger than the 
name of a small loch, at a little distance, called Cathie Loch,- 
thTGLlicword Catk signifying a battle, -if/J-P 
or which these had been formed. It appears, then, that a batUe 
had once been fought here, and that these tumuli and ridges we.e

the burying-places of the slain,— the greater mount with the tu- 
muli containing the dead of the conquerors ; and the lesser mount 
with the dorsum, the dead of the conquered; for, iu all cases, the 
victors paid more attention to the bur/ing of their own dead than 
those of the enemy.

Tliere is no public-liouse in the parish, — a circumstance upon 
which we have good grounds to congratulate ourselves, if we consi- 
der the demoralizing eflfects which low ale-houses uniformly produce 
in other quarters. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is situated at the south-eastern 
extremity of the parish, and would be very inconvenient for the 
great majority of the population, if the parish were not a small one. 
None of the parishioners, however, are more than two miles from the 
church. This fabric is very ancient. There is no authentic account 
of its date. The manse was built in 1783, and repaired and enlarged in 
1827. It stands on an elevated situation, about a mile to the north- 
east of the church. The extent of the glebe is 8.25 imperial acres. 
Its value may be estimated at L. 15 per annum. The stipend is 90.25 
bolls of grain, L. 35, 7s. lid. in money, and this being one of the 
small livings L. 44, 10s. 3d. from Government. There is only one 
Dissenter in the parish. The number of heads of families attending 
the parish church is 43, and the average number of communicants 
is 158; but nearly 30 of these are from the neighbouring parishes. 

The amount of collections yearly, on an average of the last se- 
ven years, isL. 18, 4s. ild. and for religious and charitable objects 
about L. 3,— a sum by no means small, considering the number and 
the nature of the population, which is entirely agricultural. 

Education.~The parish school has been found quite sufficient 
for the education of the parish, and is, at present, filled by a very 
efficient teacher. It is attended by about 60 scholars The 
branches of education are those usually taught in parish schools; 
and the fees for reading are 10s. ; reading and writing, 12s.; and 
when arithmetic is combined, 16s.: the languages or mathematics 
Li. I per annum. 

The salary of the schoolmaster is L. 31, including an allowance 
for a garden, and the school fees may amount to about L. 25 an- 
nually. It IS behoved that there are none in the parish above nine 
years of age who cannot read and write with more or less accuracy. 

David Jamieson, a farmer in the parish, bequeathed, many 
years ago, 2000 merks Scots, one-half of the interest of which to 
go to the poor's funds, and the other half to the schoolmaster, for 
the education of six poor children.

Poor and Parochial Funds.-The number of individua s at pre- 
sent on the poor's roll is 10, and the average sum allotted to each 
is L. 3, 5s. yearly. There are also others who receive occasional 
supplies. The church collections, interest of money, seat rents, 
and mortcloth dues, have hitherto been found adequate to supply 
the wants of the poor. The church collections, as before stated, 

amount to L. 18, 4s lid. 

M1SCELI.ANE0US Observations. 
The rapid improvements in agriculture that have taken place, 
within the last forty years, have considerably changed the aspect 

of the country. . , , 

The long serpentine, high crowned ridges, so universal under 
the ancient mode of husbandry, have entirely given place to the 
straight, level, and well-formed ridge of modern agriculture. 1 he 
old system of knoll and natural pasture, so hostile to the grass 
crop, and ruinous to the land, is nowhere to be met with but m 
the hape of noxious weeds torn up with the harrow, and laid out 
to rot for the purpose of manure. In the days of our fathers, rye- 
grass and clover were almost unknown; and even when they came 
VL used, it was some time before the old P-Ju ce - favour 
the natural grass would allow the farmer to make trial of them, it 
s on" within the last forty or fifty years, that the change has been 

ncrriculture, so that it may be said »ith truth, the present .s the 
a« " where two blades of grass have been made to grew where 
olv oneTrew before." And it surel, affords no sma l proof 
0 the raVd imprcement in tins branch of hnman mdustry to know 
that wMe the value of agricultural produce is, at present much 
he same as it was forty years ago, the farmers hve m a style o 
com ort unknown to their forefathers, and that the finest field n 
Tpalh have, within that period, increased the.r rental ftom 15s. 

° Bf Se such has been the univeal improvement in agricul- 
tur nd' we mayadd, of society in general, it -J-'

cottages, with roses and evergreens encircling their doors and win- 
dows, with the small but tasteful cottage garden in front, which is 
often to be met with, and so universally admired in England. And 
why should this be the case  It is generally, though very errone- 
ously, ascribed to the habits and tastes of the Scottish peasantry. 
It is urged, that, although they had cottages not inferior to those 
in England, they have neither the taste nor the inclination to keep 
them in proper order. From experience we can contradict the 
truth of this statement, and we think it hard to cast a stigma up- 
on a whole nation, and ungenerous to pass this sweeping condem- 
nation, without giving them a fair trial. It were surely but justice 
to give them cottages neat and comfortable, and then to wait for 
the issue. The cottages, at present, are, in general, incapable of 
being rendered either comfortable for the cottager, or a pleasing 
spectacle to the beholder ; nor can we hope for any great improve- 
ment, till the proprietors of land begin to take some interest in 
the matter. Of late years, our farm-houses have been very much 
improved, and farm steadings have been rendered commodious and 
useful, and in many instances, have been finished with much ele- 
gance and taste. But, amid improvements so general and useful, 
the cottage of the poor man has hitherto, with few exceptions, re- 
mained in its pristine state of wretchedness and want of comfort. 
Would it not be for the mutual benefit of the proprietor and far- 
mer, as it would mightily add to the comfort and happiness of the 
cottager, were the proprietor to build two or three neat, commo- 
dious cottages upon every large farm, with a small portion of gar- 
den ground attached to each— the farmer to hold them in pos- 
session, and to keep them in repair during the currency of his lease, 
and pay the proprietor a small per centage for the outlay of capi- 
tal, which would amount to very little. Three good subtantial cot- 
tages the farmer to drive the carriages might be built for some- 
what less than L. 100. This sum laid out on each extensive farm, 
and gradually till the whole were completed, would be no great 
sacrifice to the landlord, while it would give a degree of comfort 
to our cottage peasantry, which it seldom falls to their lot to ex- 
perience. The cottages in Scotland have ever been proverbial for 
want of neatness and comfort. It is hoped that this stigma will 
not much longer rest upon our country.

PRESBYTERY OF ARBROATH, SYNOD OE ANGUS AND MEARNS, 

THE REV. THOMAS GUTHRIE, MINISTER. 



I Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Extent, §-c.— Arbirlot seems to be a contraction of 
Aberelliot, the ancient name of this parish, which refers to the 
circumstance, that the river Elliot here enters the sea. The pa- 
rish is about 4 miles long and 3 broad, and is bounded on the 
south by the sea ; on the east by the parish of Arbroath ; on the 
west by the parish of Panbride ; and on the north by the parish- 
es of St Vigeans and Carmyllie. 

TopoqrapUcal Appearances.— k considerable portion of the pa- 
rish consists of what may be called flat land, and the rest has a 
gradual elevation, not attaining such an altitude as to deserve 
being called hilly. The extent of sea coast is between two and 
three miles, and along its whQle length, the shore is flat and 
sandy, affording excellent bathing ground to considerable numbers, 
who come here during the bathing season. 

Hydroqrapliy.-Thexe is a chalybeate spring in the parish, ot 
some little celebrity, though it is not now so much frequented as 
formerly. The Elliot is a stream which rises m Dilty Moss in 
the parish of Carmyllie; from thence it pursues a south-easterly 
course, and after being joined by two or three smaller streams, it 
falls into the sea in the east part of the parish. 

Mmeralogy, c.-The strata dip to the south ; the rocks are red 
sandstone and trap, containing considerable quantities o rock- 
crvstal. The soil, though on some farms clayey, generally con- 
sists of a light rich loam lying on gravel; this applies to the lo.r 
parts of the parish. In the higher and iKrthern parts again th 
L is wet and moorish; and on the borders of Car-yH- -hid 
bounds the parish on the north, there is a considerable extent at 

land still in a state of muir. 

Since tl,e e,-ec.io„ of some dam dikes, almost no sa mon tae

are common river trouts, and, tlioiigh these are not numerous, they 
are large. 

Plantations. — There is very little wood in the parish. The 
grounds of Kelly, which were at one time so highly ornamented 
with beautiful trees, are now almost bare. There is one splendid 
tree still remaining beside the old castle ; it is a plain-leafed holly 
of great size, and believed to be of great age. 

II. — Civil History. 
Land-oioner. — Lord Panmure is sole proprietor of the parish. 
Parochial Registers. — The oldest parochial register begins about 
the year 1640, 

Antiquities. — The castle of Kelly, which stands upon a high rock 
that rises from the bed of the Elliot, had been at one time a place of 
considerable strength, and is a very ancient building. It is now un- 
inhabited, though it cannot be said to be in a state of ruin. Before 
it came into the possession of the Panmure family, it belonged to 
the Irvines of Drum. These Irvines succeeded a family of the name 
of Ochterlony, and, according to tradition, it was by one of the 
Ochterlonies, a proprietor of Kelly, that the ancient abbey of Ar- 
broath was burned at some period prior to the Reformation. 

Arrow heads made of flint,— or elf-arrows, as they are called, 
have been found, in considerable numbers, in the parish. 

Modern Buildings. — The only mansion-house in the parish is 
the modern house of Kelly, which stands near to the old castle. 

On the Elliot, there are three meal mills, and one on a stream 
which is the boundary between Arbirlot and Panbride, There is 
also a flax mill upon the Elliot, and close by the mouth of this 
stream, at a place called Wormy-hills, there is a work for bleach- 
ing yarns. 

in. — Population. 

In the year 1755, the population was 865 
90, . . . 1055 
182], . . . J062 
183], . . . 1026 

Of these 1026, there were 62 males engaged in weaving, and 
perhaps as many females. 

There is one blind person in the parish. 

Character of the People.— On this head, it is enough to observe, 
that there are few country parishes where the Sabbath is so well, 
and none, to the writer's knowledge, where it is better, observed. 
Poaching does not prevail. Many years ago, smuggling of foreian 
goods was carried on to a considerable extent, but now there 



334

no such thing. It is said that the foreign merchants did not receive 
very regular remittances, and that this, with the low price of whisky, 
and establishment of the coast guard, stopped the trade of smug- 
glino- on the east coast of Scotland. 

During the last three years there were two illegitimate births m 
the parish. 

IV. — Industry. 
Jgriculture.— In this parish there are about 4200 acres either 
cultivated or occasionally under tillage ; about 800 acres which 
have never been cultivated, and altogether about 50 acres under 

wood. ,11 

Bent of Land.— The average rent of arable land per acre is 
about 18s. ; of grazing per ox for the year, L. 3 ; of pasture for 
sheep, 10s. The rate of labour for farm-servants per year is about 
L. 2o'; for day-labourers, men, Is. 6d., and women, 8d.; for arti- 
sans per day, 2s. 

The general duration of leases is nineteen years. About one- 
third of the leases are still for life, as they all were at one time. 
These liferents account for the low average rent of land in this 

parish • j • 

Produce.— The average gross amount of raw produce raised m

 About 2000 boUs of wheat, . 3000

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-town, Means of Communication, -c— Arbroath, the 
suburbs of which reach almost to the east end of the parish, is the 
market-town. There are two small villages in the parish, one of 
them at the church, the other called Bonnyton, about two miles 
west of it. In this parish there are four or five miles of turnpike 
road between Arbroath and Dundee, on which three or four coaches 

'""tlliastical State.-The situation of the parish church, which 
is a very handsome building, is convenient for the greater part 
of the parishioners. The church was rebuilt about three years ago, 
when neat ly 200 additional sittings were provided. It aftords ac 
commodation for 639 people, but contains no free sittings. 1 he

old church was seated at the expense of the farmers, and its seats 
being used for the new one, the farmers consider themselves pro- 
prietors of the seats, and entitled to charge rent for the same ; and 
rents some of them do charge. The aisle, which contains most of 
the additional sittings mentioned above, was built at the expense 
of the kirk-session, who have found in it a very profitable invest- 
ment of their money. 

The manse is more than a hundred years old, and is in a very 
bad state ; but steps have been taken towards the erection of a 
new one. The number of acres in the glebe is 4, and the mini- 
ster receives L. 20 Scots in lieu of two acres of grass. The sti- 
pend, when grain is L. 1 per boll, is about L. 197, of which there 
is more than L. 150 of money. 

All the families in the parish belong to the Established Church 
with the exception of 2 ; and there are only 9 communicants in 
the parish who belong to dissenting bodies. The services in the 
Established Church are well attended. The inhabitants are a 
church-going people ; and the average number communicating, each 
year, is fully 500; of this number, between 40 and 50 belong to a 
district of the parish of St Vigeans, the inhabitants of which attend 
the church of Arbirlot, being separated by this parish from their 



own. 



Though there was at one time a society for religious purposes 
in the parish, there is none at present ; but steps have been taken 
by the presbytery of Arbroath to establish such in all the parishes 
withm its bounds. 

Education.— There are 3 schools in the parish ;— one of these 
the parochial school ; and the other two, unendowed schools, 
one of which is kept by a female. 

The parochial teacher has the maximum salary, and 8 bolls of 
meal, and the interest of L. 100 in addition. He has a good gar- 
len and an excellent house containing five rooms. His fees may 
amount to L. 15 a year.  

There are 2 married men a«d 1 woman in the parish who can- 
not read; none of them are natives of this parish.

it is kept in the manse, contains between 400 and 500 volumes, 
and is supported by nearly 100 subscribers, who pay Is. 6d. or 2s. 

yearly. . , i 

Savings Bank.— About two years ago, a Savmgs bank was esta- 
blished. Four respectable farmers are directors, along with the 
minister, who is the manager. Last year the deposits amounted to 
above L.230, and they have increased fully L. 100 m the course

receiving parochial aid is 16, and the average sum allotted to each 
is between 4s. and 5s. The annual amount of contributions for 
their relief, taking the average of the last five years, is L. 55 from 
church collections, and L. 24 from other sources, such as seat rents 
of the aisle, interest of capital, payments for mortcloth, &amp;c. 
There is no other mode of procuring funds for the poor than those 
mentioned, and no other is needed ; for L. 15 or L 20 have been 
saved yearly for some few years back. The poor's fund is the last 
shift with the poor ; and nothing but hard necessity makes them 

go upon it. . . X -fl- 

Fairs.— There is a fair held in the parish, but it is a very trifling 

one. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
At the time of the former Statistical Account 1791, when the 
population was fully larger than at present, the yearly amount 
of funds for the poor was about L. 35 ; and now it is about 
L 80. At the time of the former Statistical Account, there was only 
1 school in the parish, and now there are 3 week-day and 4 Sab- 
bath day schools. At the time of the former Statistical Account, 
there were 4 houses in the parish where ale and spirits were sold, 
and now there is only 1.

PRESBYTERY OF FORFAR, AND SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. JAMES LYON, D. D. MINISTER.  



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name seems to be descriptive of the most striking 
natural feature of the parish. A burn flows in a ravine down its 
centre, for some miles, and crosses a ridge of high grounds imme- 
diately above the village, through a very deep and romantic rocky 
gorge, in which there is a waterfall ; and thereafter, the ravine con- 
tinues rough and rocky, and the rush of water along its bottom, 
particularly in winter, makes a murmuring sound. In somewhat 
similar situations, where there are ravines in the district, the af- 
fix iss, yss, eis, which signifies an obstruction or barrier, is common 
in the names of places, with some descriptive prefix ; and in this 
case Glamm, noise ov sound, seems to be so applicable, that no rea- 
sonable doubt need be entertained on the point, although etymo- 
logists have hitherto been at a loss about the derivation of the name. 

The parish constitutes a portion of the southern side of Strath- 
more, or great plain, situated at the foot of the Grampians, and re- 
markable for its extent and fertility,— and stretches from the centre 
of that strath to the summit of the Seidlaw hills, which bound it 
along the southern side. 

Topographical Appearances.— In respect to the configuration of 
Its surface, it presents three general divisions. The northern 
side of the parish, extending from near the town of Forfar, westerly 
along the centre of the strath, for about five miles and one in 
breadth, is comparatively flat,-for although undulated into nu- 
merous gentle swells and hollows, yet all the summits of the swells 
are much upon the same level ,• and this quarter ranges between 
160 and 250 feet above the level of the sea. The central por- 
tion stretches along the northern face of smooth and gently upris- 
ing grounds, from the water of Dean in the bottom of the strath ; the 
summits ot some of which attain an elevation of from 500 to 700

feet, and are about four miles in length from east to west, and one 
in breadth,— beyond which, the surface is subdivided into the two 
nearly parallel glens, that of Ogilvie on the east, and Denoon on 
the west, terminating, at their southern end, in the highest summits 
of the Seidlaw hills, which here range from 1000 to about loOO 
feet in height. The length of this portion is, from north to south, 
about four miles, and varies from two to four in breadth. 

The shape of the whole parish is irregular ; but its extreme 
length from east to west may be stated at 10 miles, and its breadth 
from north to south at 5 ; and it contains, of arable, 8062 impe- 
rial acres ; pasture, 4422 ; woodland, 1 566 ; roads, waters, &amp;c. &amp;c. 

559 ; total 14,609. 

SoMncZanes.— It is bounded, on the south, by the parishes ot i Ba- 
ling, Auchterhouse, and Newtyle; on the west, by Nevay and Es- 
sie; on the north, by Airlie and Kirriemuir ; and on the east, by 
Forfar and Kinnettles. . 

The climate is now dry and early, over all the lower portions of 
the parish,— the extensive drainage of the swamps and mosses which 
has taken place, of late years, having had a great effect m its im- 
provement. Agues, which formerly prevailed, and other complaints 
attendant upon a damp moist atmosphere, have now disappeared; 
and the harvest is within a few days of being as early as along the 

coast side. . . , •  • v, „„j 

Hvdrography.-'\- Loch of Forfar is withm the parish, and 
once extended to nearly 200 imperial acres, but was reduced, sixty 
years ago, by drainage, to about one-half the extent. It is supplied 
chiefly by powerful springs, contiguous,, and partly withm itself, 
and forms the head of the water of Dean, which flows westerly, 
draining Strathmore into the river Isla, and thence into the Tay ; it 
is the principal water in this quarter of the district, and is joined by 
three tributaries within the parish, first by Ballandarg burn, from 
Kirriemuir on the north ; second, by the Kerbet water, from Kin- 
nettles on the south-east; and third, by the Glammiss burn, from 
Seidlaw on the south, which flows down its centre. But the Ue- 
noon burn, also within the parish for some distance, leaves it be- 
fore it junction on the west. The united waters form a deep slug- 
gish striam, from twenty to thirty feet in width, and from one to 
5x in deDth,— much of it being nearly stagnant. 

le m n ral wells are merely some weak chalybeates, and none 
of any celebrity. The soil along the flat division of the par. 
the north side of the water of Dean, consists chiefly of light gra 



GLAMMISS. 



339 



velly and sandy loams, with a few portions of clay and a consider- 
able quantity of moss in the hollows surrounding the sandy and gra- 
velly swells, — the greater part of this division being of indifferent 
quality, notwithstanding its fine locality in the centre of the strath. 
Along the side of the Kerbet water, and after its junction with the 
Dean, westerly along the south side of the latter, there is some 
breadth of flat and deep alluvial brown loam of fine quality ; and 
within the middle division, forming the rising grounds southerly, 
there is a considerable extent of good soil along its centre, — being 
black and brown loams incumbent on an absorbent bottom, and part- 
ly of very fine quality, but also intermixed, both above and below 
this central stripe, with damp inferior sands, and a mixture of clay, 
provincially called mortar. 

Along the bottoms of the glens of Ogilvie and Denoon, there 
is also a fair proportion of sharp gravelly loams of good quality, 
but defective in climate ; the hills are mostly all of a moorish cast, 
and covered with heath, unless some grassy swamps. 

The bestsoils contiguous to the village rent, in parks, at therateof 
L. 3 per imperial acre, and downwards to L. 1. The average rent 
of farms runs from L. 1 to L. 1, 10s. for the arable land ; but the 
rent of many of them varies according to the fiars prices of grain. 

The size of farms ranges between 50 and 600 acres of arable 
land, with numerous possessions, chiefly from six to ten, held by 
manufacturers and labourers. 

The woodlands, which are extensive, have been all planted ; 
none are natural; the greater proportion are of larch, spruce, and 
Scotch fir, of seventy years and under. The park timber around 
the castle is a century older, and is chiefly ash and elm, with some 
oak, birch, and other varieties. Some of the ash trees measure 
15 feet in girth, and contain 200 cubic feet of timber. 

Much of the largest of the larch and spruce have been of late cut 
away, for the behoof of the hard-wood. Some of them measured 
60 and 70 cubic feet of timber, and a few of that size still remain. 

Ihe chief natural production of the lower portion of the parish, 
•where the soil is n.ievlov, and not under cultivation, is broom with 
heath ; and in the mosses there is heath with a mixture of 
coarse aquatic grasses ; the wood found in them is birch, al- 
der, and hazel, with some oak, but no fir, or very little Along 
the higher grounds at the foot of the glens, there is at places a 
considerable mixture of whins amongst the broom, which stretch 
upon the flanks of the Seidlaw, the higher summits of which are

covered with heath, and very httle mixture of grass, unless in 
swamps and sides of burns. The wild raspberry is common, but 
the bramble is very rare, although common in some other quar- 
ters of Strathmore. 

Botamj.— Although there is no particularly rare plant havmg 
its locality in the parish, yet the dens and ravines afford a very 
rich and varied display of flowers during the season, in particular 
of the avens, geranium, anemonies, &amp;c. &amp;c ; and the marshes along 
the Dean, of the yellow water-lily and others. Among the more 
rare plants, may be noticed the Orobus sylvaticus. 

Mineralogij— The minerals consist chiefly of diff'erent beds of 
the oldest sandstone formation which flanks the Grampians,— the 
lowest of which are of a gray colour, and underlie all the southern 
side of the parish, from a line crossing it a short distance north- 
wards of the village, and form the Seidlaw range. 

Their direction is from the north-east to the south-west, and 
they dip very uniformly to the north-west, usually at an angle be- 
tween ten and twenty degrees. 

Along the northern side, in the centre of the strath, they are over- 
laid with beds of a dark brownish-red colour, having a conform- 
able direction and dip ; they are the newest beds in Strathmore, but 
yet much older than the coal, and hence there is none of that use- 
ful mineral in the district; neither is there any limestone, beyond 
occasional nodules, within the sandstone and vems of calcareous 

The grey beds of sandstone are occasionally overlaid with trap 
or whinstone, forming the summits of the rising grounds, and at 
others much disrupted with dikes and veins of it, having great va- 
riety in their mineral character, but not productive of agates; and 
such as are to be found are very coarse. There are, however, occa- 
sionally beautiful quartz crystals in these rocks, in the Seidlaw 

district. . „ 

The mineral character of the sandstone beds varies from coarse 
conglomerate or puddingstone, through the intermediate stages 
down to calmstone, which consists of impalpable powder, and when 
exposed to the weather, decomposes into clay. 

The pebbles and grains are not crystallized, but are water-woi-n 
and conglutinated together by a paste of calcareo-ferrugmated mat- 
Tev, and are of great variety, the most abundant bemg browmsh-red 
quIrU, and a species of hornstone. Porphyry, jasper, Lydianstone,

are also to be found, and occasionally serpentine ; but granite and 
other compound rocks of the immediate Grampians are very rare. 

The conglomerate beds, as also those of calm, are turned to no 
practical use; and when they occur in the quarries, are thrown aside 
as rubbish. The intermediate beds afford valuable building mate- 
rials of all descriptions, as well as pavement and slates, and are ex- 
tensively wrought for these purposes. There is one quarry close 
upon the village, long known for the excellent millstones it pro- 
duces, some of which are exported : the stone having also the quality 
of withstanding the effects of fire, is in much request in Dundee 
and elsewhere, for oven soles. 

The beds of slate, which are thin grey flags, are in the Seidlaw 
district, and have at some very remote period been very extensive- 
ly wrought, both in this and the adjoining parishes, much beyond 
what the wants of the immediate country, inclusive of Dundee, could 
have required ; it has therefore been suggested, that the old town 
of Edinburgh and others in the Lothians might have had, at that 
period, a supply from this quarter. These beds, by being now 
wrought deeper, produce the pavement so well known by the name 
of Dundee or Arbroath pavement. 

The whinstone affords excellent materials for roads, and is ex- 
tensively wrought for that purpose. 

Some veins of lead ore were wrought about sixty years back, but 
were abandoned as not being worth the expense. The mines are close 
upon the east end of the village, where the remains of them are still 
to ;;be seen ; the veins cross the burn, and traverse the grey sand- 
stone, andare accompanied with sulphate of barytes. Traces of car- 
bonate of copper are also occasionally to be met with in the trap 
rocks of Seidlaw, but to no great extent. 

Shell marl is found along the northern side of the parish, with- 
m some of the mosses, and particularly in great abundance in 
the loch of Forfar, which was partially drained for the purpose sixty 
years ago. The drained portions having been very much exhausted, 
it has for many years been dredged up from below the water, by an 
apparatus attached to a boat, and many thousands of pounds of this 
useful manure have been obtained out of this loch. Of late years, 
however, it has been much less in request, partly owing to the 
greater part of the lands having been repeatedly marled, and 
partly from the depressed state of agriculture. 

Among the grey sandstone beds, impressions of plants and scales

of fishes have been long observed ; ahd of late years, two entire 
specimens of a non-descript fish, besides various imperfect portions, 
have been obtained ; one out of the millstone quarry, and another 
out of the quarry a short distance to the eastward of it, at Thorn- 
ton. They have always been enveloped in the solid portion of the 
rock, and not in the fissures. Similar fishes have been found m other 
quarries in the district, but are very rare, and none of them so per- 
fect specimens as the two found here. The first one was got at 
Thornton upon the sphtting up a block mto two rybats m 1831, 
when a section of a fish was exposed in each of them, from the nose 
to the tail, along the centre of the back bone, as if it had been cut 
up purposely by a lapidary's wheel. The block was taken out of 
the bottom of the quarry, thirty feet down in solid rock. 

The second was found, two years afterwards, in the millstone 
quarry, and was entire, the stony envelope having been removed 
off its back in the breaking of a block. 

They were each about six inches in length, having a very large 
head in the shape of a shield, with the eyes close together near the 
centre, on the crown of it. 

Specimens of this curious fossil fish, which proves to be a spe- 
cies of a new genus, named by Agassiz, from the peculiar shape 
of its head, Cephalaspis, were, we are informed, many years ago, 
sent to Professor Jameson, and by him shown to the Wernenan 
Society of Edinburgh. Mr Lyell, Junior, of Kinordy, has also in- 
terested himself very much in bringing together specimens of the 
Cephalaspis, and M. Agassiz, we understand, intends figuring the 
Forfarshire animal from drawings of Professor Jameson's specimens, 
under the name Cephalaspis Lyelli, in compliment to Mr Lyell, for 
the eminent services he has rendered to geological science, i he im- 
pressions of plants are most numerous in the pavement beds, hav- 
ing the appearance of reeds and a clustered fruit, the points being 
star-shaped, something similar to that of the equisetacea when 
pressed flat. Similar impressions, we understand, are not untre- 
quently met with in the same formation in other parts of Scotland, 
and will be figured b Brongniart's great work on Fossd Plants, at 
present in the course of pubhcation. 

There is also an impression frequently to be met with on the 
pavement, very like to that of an unshod colt's foot and is proba- 
bly the impression of something organic. Naturalists, however, 



GLAMMISS. 343 

have been unable to come to any conclusion about it, although it 
is also common in some parts of England. 

The whole of these organic remains are confined to the oldest 
or the grey beds of sandstone. No traces as yet have been found in 
the red beds, which are newer. Neither is there any in the clays 
or gravels which immediately overly the rocks, and underly the 
marl and moss ; but in both the latter, very large antlers of the red- 
deer are sometimes found, also tusks of the wild boar, and very 
large skulls and horn flints of the ox, and numerous shells of the 
fresh water testacea,— among which is the pearl mussel, also 
common in the Dean Water. All the sandstones and pebbles of the 
clays and gravels are referable to the rocks of the district, or to the 
contiguous range of the Grampians. None have been transported 
further, since the deposition of the conglomerate beds. But va- 
rious of the pebbles of the conglomerate beds, or rocks, are not 
to be found m any other locality, and do not belong either to the 
district or to the Grampian range. 

Zoologi/.—The wild animals found in the parish are the roe-deer 
hares, and rabbits. The latter, at one period, were plentiful, and, 
atter having been extirpated out of the district for many years, 
are now beginning again to appear. Foxes are also numerous. 
1 he badger occurs occasionally; and otters are common at the 
Dean Water. Some pine-martins have also been killed, but 
they are rare ; polecats and weasels are common ; squirrels also 
are plentiful, though rare ten years ago. 

Among the feathered tribe, the cross-bill may be noticed as hav- 
ing appeared here since the introduction of the larch woods, upon 
the seeds of which they live. Black-cock are also becoming com- 
mon in Seidlaw, of late years. Grouse are not common ; partridge 
occurs in abundance, and pheasants occasionally. Jays are still 
very numerous,, and the drainage of swamps has in a great degree 
banished the wild goose, which seventy years ago was very com 
mon along the Dean in winter.  
Pike of very large size and perch are found in the loch of Forfar 

femed"fo. t. T' "V' have been long 

tamed for their fine quality; but it is remarkable that salmon do not 

nver. It may here be mentioned, however, that, fifty or s xty years 
ago, a solitary salmon was killed in the Dean.  "

lie pile of building, is situate about one mile north from the vil- 
laoe, on the flat grounds at the confluence of the Glammiss Burn 
and the Dean. There is a print of it given by Slezer in Charles 
II.'s reign,— by which it appears to have been anciently much 
more extensive, being a large quadrangular mass of buildings, 
havino- two courts in front, with a tower in each, and gateway 
throuoh below them ; and on the northern side, was the principal 
tower,'' which now constitutes the central portion of the present 
castle, upwards of 100 feet in height. The building received the 
addition of a tower' in one of its angles, for a spiral staircase from 
bottom to top, and of numerous small turrets on its top, with coni- 
cal roofs. The wings were added, at the same time, by Patrick 
Earl of Strathmore, who repaired and modernized the structure, 
under the direction of Inigo Jones. One of the wings has been 
renovated within the last forty years, and other additions made, 
but not in harmony with Earl Patrick's repairs. 

There is also a secret room in it, only known to two or at most 
three individuals, at the same time, who are bound not to reveal it, 
unless to their successors in the secret. It has been frequently the 
object of search with the inquisitive, but the search has been m 
vain. There are no records of the castle prior to the tenth cen- 
tury, when it is first noticed in connection with the death of Mal- 
colm II in 1034. Tradition says that he was murdered in this 
castle, and in a room which is still pointed out, in the centre of 
the principal tower; and that the murderers lost their way m the 
darkness of the night, and by the breaking of the ice, were drown- 
ed in the loch of Forfar. Fordun's account is, however, some- 
what different and more probable. He states that the King was 
mortally wounded in a skirmish, in the neighbourhood, by some of 
the adherents of Kenneth V. ; accordingly, to the eastward of 
the village, within a wood near Thornton, there is a large cairn 
of stones'' surrounding an ancient obelisk, bearing similar charac- 
ters with the one near to the church, and which is called King 
Malcolm's grave-stone. Now, although he was buried at lona, 
it appears probable that these stones mark the spot where the 
battle had taken place, and where the king fell. 

King Malcolm's Grave-stone. -Withiu a few yards of the manse, 
is to be seen an obelisk or large stone of rude design, erected as is 
generally supposed, in memory of the murder of Malcolm II. King 
of Scotland. The perpetrators of that horrid deed fled with pre- 
cipitation eastward, during night, and when the fields were covered

with snow. By mistake, they directed their flight across the loch 
of Forfar, where they perished. On one side of the monument 
there are the figures of two men, who, by their attitude, seem to 
be forming the bloody conspiracy. A lion and a centaur on the 
upper part represent, as is supposed, the shocking barbarity of the 
crime. On the reverse of the monument, several sorts of fishes 
are engraven as a symbolical representation of the loch in which 
the assassins were drowned. 

St Orland's Stone. — At the distance of about a mile north-east 
from the castle, near a place called Cossins, there stands an obe- 
lisk not less curious than the two already mentioned. It is vulgar- 
ly called St Orland's Stone. No probable conjecture has been 
formed, as to the object of it. On one side, is a cross rudely 
flowered and checkered ; on the other side, four men on horse- 
back appear to be making the utmost dispatch. One of the 
horses is trampling under foot a wild boar ; and on the lower part 
of the stone, there is the figure of an animal resembling a dragon. 
It has been supposed by some, that these symbols represent officers 
of justice in pursuit of Malcolm's murderers. 

Glammiss was given to the present family, by a grant of Robert 
II. in 1372 to John Lyon, his secretary, who afterwards married 
the King's daughter, and got the barony of Kinghorn as her dower. 
At the time the castle was renovated by Earl Patrick, he also 
planted the present old timber around it in the ancient style of 
rows and avenues. The principal avenue, upwards of one mile in 
length between the castle and the village, and forming an approach 
m which there were three antique gateways,— was almost entirely 
destroyed, m the course of a few hours, by a hurricane in 1772 
About sixty years ago, in Earl John's time, the grounds were 
turned mto one park, which is yet called the « Angles," from the 
angular shape of the old enclosures, and rows of trees along them • 
and the gateways were removed. The avenues were also much 
mutilated. The gateways were rebuilt at the three different en- 
trances into the present park, and are still kept up in repair. 

There were also three other castles within the parish, but they 
are now wholly razed; one at Cossins, belonging to the same fa- 
mily; another in the glen of Ogilvie, which belonged to the family 
ot that name, now the property of Lord Douglas; and the third 
in the glen of Denoon. In the latter glen there are also the re- 
mains of an ancient fort, upon the top of an isolated basaltic hill 
rising up in the bottom of the glen, and to such a height as to com-

mand an extensive view of Stratlimore. It presents a precipitous front 
of rocks to the south and south-west. On the other side, although 
steep, it is covered with a most vivid green sward, forming a re- 
markable contrast with the heath-clad hills of Seidlaw, which ad- 
join it. Its top is surrounded with a high wall of earth and 
stones, supposed to have been 27 feet high and 20 broad ; it 
contains within it upwards of one acre, and has been a place of 
great strength. An ancient toft close by its side still retains the 
name of;" Pict's Mill." On the top of Hayston hill, an arm of 
the Seidlaw, on the east side of the parish, there is a small cir- 
cular moat surrounded with a clay dike, which was probably a 
Roman station for observation. There is another moat exactly 
similar on the Glammiss property, in the adjoining parish of 
Airlie. 

When the Loch of Forfar was drained, some Roman camp- 
kettles of brass were found, and an iron battle-axe, now preserved 
in the castle. Other Roman weapons have been found in the

In 200; but since that time a great improvement has taken place, 
by draining, subdivision of the lands by stone-dikes, and a better- 
mode of agriculture, all tending to counteract the disadvantages 
of a late climate. A few plantations have also been recently made 
on this glen. It was anciently the property of the Ogilvies of 
Powrie, who had their residence in a castle, now totally demolish- 
ed. It afterwards became the property of Graham of Claverhouse. 
The last of his family fell, in the Rebellion, at the battle of Kil- 
licrankie, and the estate was forfeited; and as it did not hold of 
the Crown, it reverted to the Douglas family, who were the su- 
periors. 

Forty years ago, the rental of Rochel-hill was about L. 75,— since 
which time great improvements have also taken place on it, in 
building houses, dikes, and drains; and, since March 1833, three 
acres of it have been feued at the rate of L. 8 per acre, and fifty 
houses built. The village is called Charleston.

with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. The glebe and 
garden contain nearly 7 acres Scots. The last augmentation was 
settled in 1824. The teinds are not exhausted. The present in- 
cumbent was ordained in 1780. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of paupers who re- 
ceive regular parochial aid is 25, exclusive of occasional paupers. 
One old woman, who is bed-ridden, costs the kirk-session 5s. per 
week. Another, who is deranged, is boarded at the rate of L. 12 
per annum. Some receive from 2s. 6d. to 10s. monthly; and 
others from Is. 6d. to 2s. 6d. weekly, according to circumstances. 
The amount paid out by the kirk- session in 1834, was L. 136, 
5s. 6|d. The poor's funds of the parish being exhausted, the 
heritors, wishing as long as possible to avoid a general assessment, 
have agreed to advance what is necessary for the support of the 
mdigent. The church collections and the money received for iDar- 
riage proclamations, the use of the mort cloth and hearse, in 1834, 
amounted to L. 77, 19s. 5jd. 

Friendly Societies.— There are two friendly societies in the pa- 
rish, namely, those of the Masons and the Gardeners. Some years 
ago they erected a handsome building in the village, where they 
hold their meetings. It consists of two large halls, and some smaller 
apartments. There are about 200 members in each society. Each 
member of the Masons' Society pays Is., and of the Gardeners 
1 s. 6d. per quarter. When any of the members are in distress and 
unable to work, they have a weekly allowance for their support. The 
widows of masons are allowed L. 1, 10s. yearly, and their children 
under seven years of age are allowed 10s. each per annum. Their 
orphans have 10s. yearly, till they are ten years old. The widows 
of gardeners are allowed L. 1 per annum, and their children under 
ten years of age are allowed 10s. each yearly. The stock of the 
Mason Lodge amounts to L.350; and that of the Gardeners to 
about L. 300 

Library. In 1828, a subscription library was formed in the vil- 
lage ot Glamraiss, and now contains from 600 to 700 volumes 
managed by a committee of the members. The annual subscript 
tion IS 4s.; entry-money, 5s. Various donations of books have 
been given by individuals in the neighbourhood. 

Education.~Besk\es the parochial school, there are three pri 
vate unendowed schools in the parish. The salary of the paro- 
chial schoolmaster is the maximum, with a good house and garden 
Ihe average number of his scholars is about 70. His fees miy

amount to L. 25 per annum. The other teachers depend on the 
school fees. One of them is allowed, by the farmers in his district, 
a few bolls of meal yearly. The number of their scholars may 
amount to 100 or 120. 

There are four Sabbath schools in the parish, generally well at- 
tended. An infant school was opened in the village of Glammiss 
at Whitsunday last, and is very flourishing. It is attended by 
about 60 scholars, who pay Id. each per week. The school- 
mistress has a salary of L. 25 per annum, which is paid by a sub- 
scription in the parish and neighbourhood. The Trustees of the 
late Earl of Strathmore have generously allowed the teacher a house 
and garden, with play-ground, and have fitted up the school in the 
best manner for the purpose ; and they and the other heritors are 
now about to erect a new parochial school at Glammiss, the pre- 
sent one being found much too small and inconvenient. Mr Ja- 
mieson Willis, the minister's assistant, besides his other labours, 
has regular classes through the week in different parts of the pa- 
rish, for instructing the young people in the knowledge of the great 
truths of the Gospel.

PRESBYTERY OF ARBROATH, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. WILLIAM ROBERTSON, MINISTER. 



I, Topography and Natural History. 

2ae._CARMYLiE, originally, was not the name of a parish, but 
of a castle or stronghold, which had long been the residence of the 
proprietors of certain lands in its neighbourhood. The name is 
probably of Celtic origin, and is said to signify in that language, 
« the top of a high rocky or bare place," and is sufficiently descrip- 
tive of the place where the castle stood, as its foundations are still 
to be traced by the farm-house, which retains the name, towards 
the summit of one of the highest grounds in the parish. 

Extent, Bomdaries.-i:\ medium length of the parish, from

south-west to north-east, in a straight line, is about 4 miles, and its 
medium breadth about 3 miles. It contains, therefore, about 12 
square miles. 

It is situated in the county of Forfar, in the synod of Angus 
and Mearns, and Presbytery of Aberbrothock, is of an oblong 
form, and is bounded by parts of eight parishes, viz. of Panbride 
Monikie, detached parts of Guthrie and Dunnichen, and by parts 
of Kirkden, Inverkeilor, St Vigeans, and Arbirlot. 

Topographical Appearances. — It forms part of the south-eastern 
branch of the Seidlaw hills, and consists chiefly of a series of high 
grounds scarcely approaching to hills, with their intervening val- 
lies, running somewhat in a crescent like-form, from south-west to 
east nearly ; and being all of a rounded form and of gentle accli- 
vity, they are, with one exception, cultivated to their summits, and 
the greater part of the intervening vallies has more recently been 
brought under the plough. They are of nearly equal elevation, 
and are at least 200 feet above the lowest part or plane of the 
parish, which may be considered as a kind of table-land, there 
being a gradual declivity from it for several miles in all directions, 
excepting towards the south-west. Their greatest elevation above 
the level of the sea, has not been very accurately ascertained, but 
it may be stated at not less than 580 feet, — commanding a most 
extensive prospect, on the one hand, of the German Ocean, and 
of the coast of Fife from St Andrews to Fifeness, and in a clear day 
of the range of the Lammermuir hills ; and on the other, of the 
Grampian mountains, from Schehallion nearly to their eastern 
termination. 

Meteorology.— As the parish is situated towards the eastern de- 
clivity of the Seidlaw hills, and without shelter from the north 
and east, our climate is considerably colder than that of the sur- 
rounding parishes. When the highest point of these hills, which 
IS visible from the parish, is seen caped with clouds or mist, it is 
reckoned a sure presage of rain. Their long range attracts the 
floating clouds, and condenses them on the soil, which is thereby 
chilled,— a stiff retentive subsoil preventing the absorption of the 
waters, and the surrounding air is kept loaded with moisture. 

As Mr Headrick remarks, in reference to the climate of the ma- 
ritime district, from our vicinity to the sea and our high situation, 

"ZhTr f "«™P'"ent A. «. 139, near Carbuddo, probably, as he thinks 

'till lo be " """- '' °f

FORFARSHIRE. 



" in spring and summer, there is often an alternation of land and sea 
breezes ; and raw cold winds occasionally set in towards the even- 
ing, frequently accompanied with thick haze called the easternhaar, 
which spreads over the low grounds." As might be expected in 
these circumstances, rheumatic, catarrhal, and inflammatory com- 
plaints are those of most frequent occurrence ; yet the parishion- 
ers, on the whole, are healthy and vigorous. 

Hydrograpluj. — Considering the extent of the parish, its springs 
are not numerous, nor, with the exception of a pretty strong cha- 
lybeate in the den of Guynd, are they remarkable for any pecu- 
liar quality. Carmylie well, issuing from the south side of the hill 
of that name, and reckoned one of the best in the parish, has a 
mean annual temperature of 46°. G. That of Monk Mudie's well, 
at the foot of the hill, is nearly the same. 

A few small rivulets constitute the only streams in the parish, the 
most considerable of which is the Elot. Its banks towards Guynd, 
the residence of the second heritor, exhibit a good deal of beauti- 
ful and romantic scenery ; of which, advantage has been taken by 
the proprietor, in the disposal of his pleasure grounds. It has its 
source in the parish, and joins the sea at Aber-elot, now Arbirlot, 
about eight miles distant from its source, which flows from the east 
end of a peat bog called Dilty moss. 

A small rivulet flows from the west end of the moss in a con- 
trary direction, and reaches the German Ocean by a very circui- 
tous course, descending through the adjoining parishes by the 
Dean and the Isla to the Tay. 

Geologij and Mineralogy.— The elevated parts of the parish 
seem to be composed of masses of sandstone, chiefly of a reddish 
grey colour ; their summits are in several instances coped with a 
dark-coloured whinstone, called scurdy. Sandstone rocks of great 
thickness are also found a little below the level of the parish, at its 
eastern extremity. 

The general bearing of the strata is the same as that of the strata 
which compose the Seidlaw hills, of which the parish forms a part, 
viz from south-west to north-east. They abound in fissures, partly 
transverse, but chiefly in the direction of their dip, which is to- 
wards the south-east, at the rate of 1 foot in 6 feet nearly of hori- 
zontal distance. . 

« Mr Headrick states Survey, page 36, that, on sinking a pit 
in quest of limestone at Coiiansy, in this parish, only a few de- 
tached masses of sparry limestone were found, but a great bodj

of steatite was intersected, some of which is red, and would make 
beautiful porcelain ware ; much of it is red, of various intensity, 
with numerous white veins interspersed." 

In the direction above-mentioned, and commencing nearly at one 
of the most elevated parts of the parish, and extending with a gra- 
dual declivity to 1 mile in length, by  mile in extreme breadth, 
there is a range of strata, which, from the scales of mica which 
abound in their composition, can be raised in flags of various di- 
mensions, the thicker forming excellent pavement, while the thin- 
ner are used for slates. 

Strata of slate- clay or caumstane, as it is called, of a bluish 
colour, and of various thickness, alternate with the pavement strata. 

A tunnel now in progress, upwards of forty feet below the sur- 
face, for the purpose of drawing off the water from the principal 
quarry, is intersecting a stratum of hard sandstone of a reddish- 
gray colour, in which rounded pebbles are found imbedded. 

In the caumstane strata, it is not uncommon to meet with im- 
pressions apparently of rushes or marsh-reeds, and also of what 
appears to have been the seed-vessels of some unknown plant re- 
sembling the strawberry. 

Impressions also of vegetables resembling ferns, and of a red 
colour, are sometimes found in the pavement strata. Hollows re- 
sembling the foot-prints of animals sometimes occur, and are cal- 
led the kelpie's foot. Impressions resembling a confused mass of 
pieces of wood, of various dimensions and colours, are also met within 
the pavement strata, at a considerable distance below the surface. 
In a pavement stratum of a bluish colour, at the depth of 20 feet, 
the superincumbent strata, consisting of clay, scurdy, reddish sand- 
stone and caum, there was lately discovered a distinct impression 
of a small cartilaginous fish. The specimen happened to be muti- 
lated by the workman in raising it ; but another specimen more 
recently discovered, of what appears to have been the same species, 
has been more fortunate. 

I beg to subjoin the following statement as to the alterna- 
tion and depth of the strata in the principal quarries, which I late- 
ly received from one of the workmen.

Our soil is various. Along the declivities of some of our high 
grounds, there is a proportion of dry light-coloured friable soil, 
and of fine deep alluvial soil in the hollows along the banks of 
our small streams. But the most prevalent is a dark-coloured soil, 
having the appearance of fine black vegetable mould, but which 
ovfes its colour partly to its moist state, and partly to its mossy 
nature. It is wet and spongy from the causes already noticed, — 
and, in rainy seasons, apt to get into a mortar-like state, and, from 
its long retention of the moisture, is favourable to the growth of 
moss-plan ts.-f 

About one-fifth of that which is now in cultivation is stated as 
infield or old cultivated land, in a plan drawn about sixty years 
ago. It is in some places from H to 2 feet deep, from the level- 
ling of the old ridges, while in others it is little more than the 
depth of an ordinary furrow. The average depth may be stated at 

7 inches. 

Boulder-stones of the primitive rocks are occasionally found 
in the course of cultivation. They are most numerous on the 
north-west side of Boath-hill, and are of considerable size, and of 
various kinds, such as gray granite, micaceous schistus, &amp;c. 

Zoology. — The animals and plants to be met with in the parish, 
are such as are common to the Seidlaw district ; and these are so 
minutely enumerated and scientifically arranged by the late in- 
genious Mr Don of Forfar, in the appendix to Mr Headrick's Sur- 
vey of the county, as to render any account of them unnecessary in 
this place.' I may mention, however, that the species of plover called 
dotterel, that alights on our highest grounds in spring and autumn, in 
migrating to and from the Grampians, is now rarely seen in such 
numbers as formerly. A few pheasants and a few roe-deer have, 
of late years, taken up their abode in the woods of Guynd.

Botany. — The plants used in this quarter for cuhnary purposes, 
are those in common use, all over the country. 

The forest trees chiefly planted are the larch, the spruce, and 
Scots firs, the oak, ash, elm, birch, and plane, all of which seem 
to be in a thriving state. The oak must have flourished here in 
former ages, from the massy remains of that tree which have been 
dug up in different quarters of the parish. 

II. —  Civil History. 

The lands of Carmylie, at an early period, were the jproperty of 
the Abbey of Aberbrothock, but were not erected into a parochial 
charge till after the Reformation. Previous to that time, there 
was a chapel, where the church now stands, dedicated to the Vir- 
gin Mary, and mentioned in some old records as " our lady's cha- 
pel of Carmylie," where the monks from the Abbey of Aberbro- 
thock performed divine service. 

In 1609, an act of Parliament was passed, which had been pre- 
ceded, it would appear, by decrees of the church courts, ratifying 
and approving the erection of the kirk of Carmylie into a paro- 
chial charge, and ordaining " the territory to be designed by the 
presbytery, to repair thereto in all time coming." 

The parochial territory designed by the presbytery, in addition 
to the lands of Carmylie, consisted of certain portions of the pa- 
rishes of Panbride, St Vigeans, and Inverkeilor, which lay remote 
from their own parish churches, but contiguous to Carmylie. All 
these parishes belonged to the Abbey of Aberbrothock, as ap- 
pears from a copy of the rent roll of that abbey as it stood in the 
early part of the sixteenth century, in which the several portions 
annexed to Carmylie are stated as situated in one or other of the 
said parishes. 

The lands of Carmylie seem to have come into the possession 
of the family of Panmure, nearly two centuries ago. 

In 1549, and upon the eve of the Reformation, James Beatton, 
the Abbot of Aberbrothock, granted a charter of the lands of 

Z t'PPn'i' to John Connell's Treatise on the Law of Parishes, No. ix, the 
said act of Parliament is thus quoted : « Act anent the kirk of Carmylie, 1609. Our 
Sovereign Lord with the advice of the Estates of Parliament, ratifies and approves 
rSaTf of the kirk of Carmylie in ane parish kirk, conform to the acts of the kirk 
made thereanen t ; like as his highness, by advice aforesaid, of new erects the said kirk 
in ane parish kirk, and ordains the same to enjoy and bruik all the privileges and 
kini""' f-usly belonging to ane parish kirk, by the law and con'suet ile of t is

Guynd, the portion annexed to Carmylie from the parish of St 
Vigeans, in favour of John Beatton of Balquharry, for services per- 
formed by him, and amongst others, " the defence of the monas- 
tery against the invaders of the church hberties in these times 
when the Lutherans are endeavouring to invade the same." 
. In 1559, these lands came into the possession of James Beat- 
ton, Archbishop of Glasgow; and in 1597 of John Beatton of 
Balfour, as nearest of kin to the archbishop.f 

In 1634 a contract respecting the feu -duties payable out of these 
lands was executed between James Marquis of Hamilton, the 
Lord of iErection, and John Ouchterlony of Guynd, ancestor of 
the present proprietor.§ 

Accordino- to the custom in former times, among families ot dis- 
tinction, of taking their surnames from their estates, the surname 
of Carnegie was assumed from the lands and barony of Carnegie,t 
the portion annexed to Carmylie from the parish of Panbride. 

The barony of Carnegie continued in the possession of the fa- 
mily of Southesk, until about seventy or eighty years ago, when 
it was included in an excambion of lands which took place about 
that time, with the family of Panmure.j 

Eminent Men.-The late Dr Small, one of the ministers of Dun - 
dee, and author of a work in astronomy, entitled " Kepler s Dis- 
coveries," was a native of this parish. 

Land-oioners.-'Vhe lands belonging to the Right Honourable 
Lord Panmure constitute the greater part of the parish, the valu- 
ed rent of them being about three-fourths of the whole valued rent 
of the parish. The second heritor is John Ouchterlony, Esq of 
Guynd ; and the third is Alexander Smart, Esq. of Coiiansythe.

ending January 1681. There is another register of baptisms, &amp;c. 
commencing 1684, very regularly kept, and ending 1709. The 
next register commences in 1720,  and, with the exception of a 
blank in the register of marriages, from 1745 to 1779, has been 
pretty regularly kept to the present time. 

Antiquities. — There was a chapel in the time of popery, on the 
farm of Back-boath, that part of the parish which was cut off from 
the parish of Inverkeilor. Some of the hewn work of it is still to 
be seen in the walls of the farm-steading ; and the spot where it 
stood is still pointed out in an adjoining field, still called the cha- 
pel shed. 

Upon the top of an eminence called Boath-hill, on said farm, 
there were, not many years ago, several large upright stones cal- 
led the kemple or temple stanes, which were believed to have been 
a Druidical temple ; but it happened here, as in many other parts of 
the country, that, in the progress of improvement, no regard was 
paid to these interesting remains, and the kemple stanes have now 
disappeared. 

There were several sepulchral cairns in the parish, almost all of 
which are now cleared away. The largest of this kind was on the 
high ground of the farm of Skichen, and extended over one-fourth 
of an acre. Hundreds of cart loads of stones for drains, &amp;c were 
obtained from it. Several stone coffins containing urns were found 
in different parts of the cairn, about six feet below the surface, and 
each of the urns contained some fragments of bones. Two of the 
urns were got out whole, one of which is said to be in the posses- 
sion of the Society of Antiquaries in Edinburo-h 

In a small sandy hillock, on the same farm," there was discover- 
ed a few years ago, another coffin of a similar description, about 
Uiree eet below the surface containingan urn of the rudesl wo k-

Near the summit of Carmylie hill is a barrow or tumulus, which, 
in olden times, was believed to be a favourite haunt of the fames, 
where they held their nightly revels, and which is still called the 
Fairy or Fair-folk hillock." Their dwelling of late years has 
been very unceremoniously entered, and yet no evil has befallen 
the intruders. Part of the tumulus has been thrown down, and 
some frao-ments of bones and of charcoal were discovered, not far be- 
low the surface; and among these, a small brass ring was found about 
two inchesin diameter, and about two-eighths of an inch in thickness. 

At the den of Guynd, there are some vestiges of what appears 
to have been an encampment or stronghold called Dunhead, situ- 
ated upon an eminence formed by the junction of two ravmes cal- 
led the Black den and the Den of Guynd. It is of a triangular 
form, and is precipitous on two- sides, and has been defended on 
the other by a ditch and rough wall or dike. From its name, it is 
probable that it was originally a Caledonian fort, though it may 
afterwards have been occupied by the Danes or Norwegians, dur- 
ing some of their incursions upon the coast. 

Modern Buildinc/s.-The only modern buildings of note m the 
parish are the elegant mansion-houses of Guynd and Conansythe, 
built of the sandstone found in the neighbourhood. Tie former 
is pleasantly situated on the west bank of the Elot or Ellio , and 
surrounded with plantations very tastefully disposed; the latter, 
though placed on high ground, is well sheltered and considerably 
ornamented with some thriving wood, and commands a very exten- 
sive prospect, particularly of the beautiful vales of the Lunan and 
the Brothock. 

III.— Population. j .t, , 

It would appear from the earliest of our parochial records, that 
the population of the parish at the time to which it refers, w con- 
siderable,-the annual average of baptisms from 1667 to 1680, m 
elusive, being 23. The succeeding register shows a gradual in- 
crease from 1686 to 1699, the annual average for that time bemg 
25 After this period, the population seems to have undergo- a 
gradual decrease, the annual average of baptisms from 1720 to 

" tices a rther decrease as stated in Dr Web 
ster's Enumeration in 1755; and the population seems to hae 



CARMYLIE. 359 

reached its minimum about thirty-five or forty years ago, being 
then about 700. Since that period, the annual average of bap- 
tisms, and the population returns, shevf a gradual increase. 

It is difficult to account for so large a population as the above 
averages seem to imply, during the latter part of the seventeenth 
century, in a part of the country, which, at that time, must have 
been indifferently cultivated, and where trade and manufactures 
had no existence. But it is well known that the cottar system pre- 
vailed much in those days ; and the wants of the people, being then but 
few, were easily supplied. The convenience of procuring fuel from 
an extensive moss in the parish might have been an inducement 
then, as it is at present, for the poorer classes to congregate in its 
neighbourhood. 

The decrease which afterwards took place may have been ow- 
ing, m some degree, to the forfeiture, which took place, in 1715, of 
the lands constituting the greater part of the parish; to the diffe- 
rent management of them which must then have succeeded; and 
to the various inconveniences thence arising to the tenantry. 

The decrease which took place at a later period, was probably 
occasioned by the breaking up of the cottar system, and the en- 
largement of the farms at the commencement of the agricultural 
improvements of the parish. 

The gradual increase of the last forty years, especially since the 
beginnmgof thepresent century, seems owing principally to the in- 
troduction of the manufacture of coarse linens, a considerable num- 
ber of the population being employed in weaving that article; and 
also to the employment afforded by the slate and pavement quar- 
ries in the parish, which are now wrought to a much greater ex- 
tent than formerly.  

But there are also other causes which ought to be taken into ac- 

Zt. f VT'"''" P""' °f importance 

for he farmer to have an ample supply of labourers at command, 
part cularly m the time of harvest, and various cottages have been 
bui t wi h this view ; and when we add to this, the flhties afford- 
ed for this purpose by the abundance of building materials, especi- 
 m he neighbourhood of the quarries, from thich they areca . 
.ed out as rubbish ; and also the custom of early marries, now

taken place in the population of the parish.

pulation respectively of 75, 51, and 48, amounting in all to 174; 
consequently, 979 of the population are scattered over the other 

districts of the parish. 

The annual average of births for the last seven years may be stated 
at 30 ; of marriages, 1 1. The annual average of deaths cannot be 
very accurately stated, as there is no register of deaths kept here ; 
iudging, however, from the amount of dues received for the use of 
the mortcloth, the annual average of burials, for the above period, 

may be stated at 13.

good morals or to virtuous independence of spirit. Christmas and 
Nevi- Year's days, old style, are still kept as holidays by the gene- 
rality of the people, and convivial meetings are then held among 
friends and neighbours. The young men sometimes amuse them- 
selves with a wad or prize-shooting, on one or other of these days. 
Sometimes raffles take place of small articles. A few fires are still 
lighted on the Hallowe'en by the young people ; and some of the 
ancient spells are still practised at that time, not from any belief 
in their potency, but merely for the sake of amusement. The farm 
festival of harvest-home, or maiden play, as it is called, is still ob- 
served by some of the farmers at the close of their harvest labours. 

While the people of the more fertile and wealthy districts in the 
neighbourhood, were advancing in the career of improvement every 
way, the inhabitants of Carmylie, in their habits and dresses, re- 
mained, it should seem, like their soil, very much in the primitive 
state, and were, in consequence, superciliously denominated by their 
more polished neighbours, " the bodies of Carmylie." Now, how- 
ever, all such peculiarities have disappeared, and all have partaken of 
the general improvement of the country. The hodden dresses of 
home manufacture are now exchanged for English cloths and cot- 
ton manufactures. A few blue bonnets of goodly extent among 
the old men, and a few tartan and scarlet plaids among the old 
women, are the only relics now to be seen of the holiday dresses 
of the last generation. 

A considerable change has taken place in the ordinary food, as 
well as in the clothing of all classes of the community. The use 
of tea and of wheaten bread is now common. About sixty years 
 ago, there were, it is said, only two tea-kettles in the parish : now 
there is not, perhaps, a single house in it without one. Within the 
memory of some of the present generation, swine were kept only at 
mills, and an antipathy to swine's flesh was common : now there is 
scarcely a family without their pigs and bacon. Potatoes were 
then but little cultivated, now they form a considerable part of the 
maintenance of the labouring classes. Their usual food for break- 
fast IS oatmeal porridge and milk ; sometimes tea, with oat-cakes 
and butter. Dinner frequently consists of pork and potatoes, 
sometimes fish, or preparations of milk ; and among the poorer clas- 
ses, sometimes potatoes chiefly. Tea in the afternoon is common 
and potatoes for supper; but little small beer is used— the common 
beverage is water. The practice of tea drinking may refresh the 
weaned labourer at the close of the day ; but setting aside the ex- 



302 FORFARSHIRE. 

pense, it certainly does not tend to strengthen liini for liis labours, 
like the home-brewed beer, formerly in use. 

The farm-servants who receive an allowance of meal and milk, 
and who are lodged in apartments separate from the farm-house, 
called bothies, cook their own victuals, winch usually coiis tof 
milk-brose for breakfast, dinner, and supper. Tins bothie ystem, 
so common at one time in the lowlands of this county, is but - 
tle prevalent in this parish ; and happily for the morals and man- 
ners'of a numerous and important class of the commumty, seems 

■"/S  — ial dish, and especial vourite of our 
forefathers " the kail-brose of auld Scotland" is now in a great 
measure unknown among the younger generation ; and very proba- 
blY the brose-bicker disappeared with the gudeman from the table- 
head, when, in the progress of refinement, he ceased to preside at 
the family board, around which the whole household used to as- 
semble at meals, and where his presence and conversation produ- 
ced the most beneficial effects on the manners and morals ot the 

domestics. , • i • a 

The greater number of the agricultural population, bemg under 
an indulgent and liberal landlord, and various of them occupying 
under old leases, they enjoy in consequence a reasonable share of the 
comforts and advantages of society, and generally speakmg, are con- 
tented with their situation and circumstances ; and if there be any ot 
theparishioners less so, theyareto be found chiefly amongstthema- 
nufacturing classes, who are exposed to the Ps 
their line of employment; and yet these are far less felt m thi 
quarter than in many other places, for several of the weavers rent 
small possessions of land; others, when times are unfavourable to 
them, engage in farm labours ; and from there bemg always a con- 
siderable demand for labour at the quarries, those who are able 
and willing to work, seldom want employment. 

Though the division of labour commonly observed among the 
agricultural part of the population, the unvarying task of the wea- 
vers and the hard labour of the quarriers, be but httle favourable 
to the acquisition of knowledge, and though our distance from the 
colleges, and our vicinity to manufacturing towns, give but little 
taste fo classical learning, yet the parishioners ha.e all received 
an education suitable to their condition in life, and are on the who 
as intelligent as their neighbours, and as can be reasonably ex- 
pected inheir circumstances ; and considering their exemplary at-

tendance on the public ordinances of religion, and their peaceable, 
industrious, and orderly conduct in privat&amp;life, they may be justly 
characterized in general, as a moral and religious people ; and al- 
though it may not be affirmed that they are more so than their 
forefathers, yet there can be no doubt that they are less supersti- 
tious. Little credence is now given to stories of fairies, ghosts, 
witches, and water-kelpies. Such legends have almost entirely dis- 
appeared. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — According to the statement of the occupiers of 
the lands, there are in the parish, either cultivated or occasionally 
in tillage, 41 59 acres Scots, exclusive of gardens. There are 734 
acres Scots which remain constantly waste or in pasture, exclusive 
of a moss supposed to contain 200 acres, and of the ground occu- 
pied by farm-steadings. About 200 acres might be added to the 
cultivated land of the parish, though not much more than the half 
of that number could be improved to any considerable advantage. 
Besides the moss alluded to, there are belonging to the principal 
heritor tracks of moor not annexed to any farm : their extent may 
be stated at. not less than 100 acres ; and being connected with ex- 
tensive moors in neighbouring parishes, they are sometimes used for 
wintering sheep from the Grampians. There are 335 acres of 
planted wood, consisting chiefly of larch, Scots, and spruce firs, 
with a proportion of the common kinds of hard-wood. 

Jlent of Land. — The average rent of arable land in the parish is 
about 15s. ld. per acre.f Nearly 1700 arable acres are occupied 

 In 1743, a reputed wizard was, consulted by people in this parish as to the reco- 
■ very of stolen goods ; and so prevalent were such applications at that time in this 
neighbourhood, that the clergy thought it necessary to draw out an address on the 

subject, which was appointed to be read in all the churches of the bounds Session 

and Presbytery records. 

t In a copy of the chartulary of the abbey of Aberbrothock, which is in the li- 
brary at Panmure, it is stated, that, in 1485, a lease of the teinds of lands of the ba- 
rony of Carmylie, was granted to Robert Strachan and Janet his spouse, for the 
yearly payment of twenty raerks Scots ; and that in 1 499, the lease was renewed to 
David Strachaii for twenty-three merks Scots. Besides the money rent, some ser- 
vices were required from the tenant, as appears from the following extract from his 
lease : " Volumus autem quod dictus Robertiis ubique locorura infia regnum Sco- 
ti£e m nostra curia et in curiis succcssorum nostrorum equitet honeste ut decet in 
tempore quando ad hoc premonitus fuerit per nos aut successores nostros omnibus 
fraude et dolo et delatione post positis." " Assedatio Garbarum Decimalium Do- 
minu de Carmylie." 

From the copy of the abbey rental formerly mentioned, it appears that, in the six- 
teenth century, the annual rent of the several lands now constituting the parish, 
amounted to CO bolls of bear or barley, 160 bolls of oatmeal, 80 bolls of horse corn, 
and the temds of the lands of Carmylie, amounting to L. 26, 1 3s. 4d. ; Guynd pro fir- 
mis, L. 4, 6s. fid,; pro rynmart, 5s. ; total, 31, 5s. 8d. besides some poultry and car- 
nages, ''

under long leases, let upwards of fifty years ago. A full-grown ox 
or cow may be grazed for the summer at L. 1, lOs., and may be 
kept for the winter at L. 2, 10s. or at L. 4 for the year. 

fyages.—T\\e wages of farm-servants are from L. 10 to L. 15 
a-year ; of best servants from L. 14 to L. 16 a year, exclusive 
if they lodge in bothies of 6i bolls of oat-meal, a Scots pint of un- 
skimmed milk, sometimes a pint and a-half per day from the com- 
mencement of the seed-time till the end of harvest 3 bolls of po- 
tatoes, 16 stones Dutch per boll, and a certain allowance of fuel. 
But unmarried farm-servants frequently, and female servants com- 
monly, are boarded and lodged in their master's house, and receive 
only money wages. Married men are generally preferred, who oc- 
cupy, at a certain rent, a house and kail-yard, and sometimes a few 
acres of land, the tillage of which is undertaken by their masters; 
the house rent and expense of labour being reckoned as part of 
their wages. Female servants receive from L. 5 to L. 6 a year 
a few h7, who are bound to assist at the lighter kinds of farm- 
work, such as turnips-hoeing, hay-making, &amp;c. f 

There is a rent-roll at Panmure of the " Lairdship of Carrnylie » and of other

seated atT. 7 per boll. A cottage aad kail-yard were then rented at 1 dozen chick- 
ens a year, and some cottages pakl only 8 chickens a year. A small farm, which 
was let a few years ago at L. 26 a year, was then rented at a sum now equal to L. 4,

The usual hire of a plough of two horses and ploughman is Is. 
per hour employed, or 5s. per yoking of five hours. The mode 
of reaping  now commonly adopted in the parish is called ihreav- 
ing. The farmer's cottars are bound to labour on these occasions : 
other hands are obtained ifa the parish, and sometimes from a dis- 
tance. They receive 3d. per threave of 24 sheaves, of a certain 
girth, for oats and barley, and 3d. per threave for wheat of 28 
sheaves, and sometimes an allowance in addition of milk and po- 
tatoes. An additional halfpenny per threave is allowed for bind- 
ing and stooking; but these operations are commonly performed by 
separate labourers, at 2s. per day with victuals, or 2s. 6d. without 
victuals. 

As thrashing-mills are not numerous in the parish, a good deal 
of our grain is thrashed by labourers, called barn-men, engaged for 
the season, who receive the twenty-fifth boll or part of whatever 
kind of grain is threshed, and two meals a day, when employed; or 
the twenty-first boll or part without victuals. 

We have only two corn-mills in the parish ; the seventeenth peck 
is paid for drying, grinding, and sifting. 

Common labourers and quarriers receive from Is. 6d. to Is. 8d. 
per day in summer, and from Is. 4d. to Is. 6d. per day in winter, 
without victuals. Labourers engaged for the year on days wages, 
receive about 9s. per week, without victuals female labourers at 
turnip-hoeing, &amp;c. receive 9d. per day without victuals. A wright 
receives 2s. a day besides victuals. \ A mason from 2s. 4d. to 2s. 
6d. without victuals; a tailor Is. 2d. a day besides victuals; a wea- 
ver makes at present about Is. 6d. a day ; a journeyman smith's 
wages are 14s. a week without victuals, or from L. 12 to L. 14 a 
year, besides victuals. 

Ditches and drains are generally done at a certain rate per rood 
of thirty-six running ells, according to their dimensions. Stone- 
dikers receive from 10s. to lis. per rood of thirty-six square ells.

Live-Stoch—Beiove the green crop system of husbandry was in- 
troduced here, almost every farmer had a flock of sheep ; but this prac- 
tice hasbeendiscontinued for manyyears, and though the attentionof 
the farmer is now much directed to the raising of crops, it is nearly 
as much so to the rearing and grazing of cattle-as in ordinary 
vears he depends for his profits as much upon the latter as upon 
the former. Every farmer rears a certain number annually, to 
keep up his permanent stock, and buys in whatever flying stock he 
may require to consume his pasture and turnips Grass feeding of 
cattle is but little practised : numbers are sold off" annually o be fed 
on richer pastures. The native breed of the county, so well known 
throughout the country, is most common. Considerab e a ten- 

ion has been paid, of late years, to improvmg the breed of the live- 
stock of the district, by the Eastern Forfarshire Agricultural As- 

mra«"/-I«Pro-«""t in agriculture did not commence 
here so early as in the adjoining districts; but since the beginning 
of the present century, these have made rapid progress, and the 
mode of acriculture now generally followed m the parish is not in-

ferior to that of the most improved districts, in consequence of 
which, and of the introduction of the earUer kinds of grain, our 
harvest is considered as, in ordinary years, about eight or ten days 
earher than formerly. 

In the earher stages of improvement, the application of marl 
was much practised ; but lime is now generally applied, which is 
procured from the Frith of Forth, and partly from Sunderland. 
Bone dust ha been lately introduced in small quantities, for raising 
turnips, and with good effect. Owing to the nature of the sub- 
soil, the throwing down of the old ridges has not, in all cases, 
been an improvement. More draining is required, and much of the 
old soil is buried out of reach of the plough, and some fields, in con- 
sequence, have scarcely recovered their former fertility. Great at- 
tention is paid, to lay the ridges so as not to retain the surface 
water, and to cut furrows in the hollows to carry it off. A regu- 
lar rotation of cropping is observed, so far as soil and season will 
permit. The usual rotation is as follows : 1. oats from ley ; 2. 
turnips and potatoes, and sometimes part fallow, with lime or dung 
or compost applied ; 3. barley or oats, with grass seeds, and wheat 
on the fallow where the soil answers, with grass seeds harrowed or 
rolled in in the spring ; 4. grass, part made into hay, and part in pas- 
ture ; 5. pasture. Oats form the most prevaihng crop in the pa- 
rish. Formerly a species called shiocks, or black-oats, was much 
sown, and more lately what is called common oats; but now the po- 
tato oat has supplanted every kind. About 1 boll is sown into 
the acre, and, in ordinary years, the boll yields about 17 pecks of 
meal. 

Considerable quantities of bear, here called Chester, and of the 
coarser kinds of barley called branded and white barley, were for- 
merly sown; and from their ripening earher, and thriving on the 
poorer soils, they seem better suited to the parish than theEnglish 
barley, now generally sown, which never attains the weight of the 
barley raised in the more fertile districts, seldom exceeding 52 lb. 
imperial per bushel. About a boll is sown into the acre. Though 
the soil in several quarters appears to be well adapted for the culture 
of wheat, yet there is not much sown in the parish, as it seldom 
comes to great perfection. 

The average afmual produce of the grain sown in the parish, is 
about 5,1 bolls per acre; but the average quality is so inferior, 
that, in ordinary years, the price obtained for a boll of Carmylie 
wheat falls under the fiar price, about 3s. ; for a boll of barley about

2s. 6d. ; for a boll of oats Is. 6d. ; — a reduction which the new and 
certainly equitable plan lately introduced into our corn nnarket, of 
buying by weight instead of measure, must tend still further to in- 
crease. A considerable extent of potatoes is planted, as they 
form a large proportion of the food of the labouring classes : pota- 
toes are also given to cows and horses, and a part is consumed by 
the pigs and the poultry. The culture of potatoes is well understood, 
and great pains are taken in pulverizing the clods, and in loosen- 
ing the soil around the plants when springing, with a three prong- 
ed instrument, called a clatt. The kinds commonly planted are 
the white and red kidney, a large round red kind, and the small 
American for the table. The quality is generally excellent. 
Tuinips are raised in considerable quantity. The white top, 
the red -top, and the globe, are- the most common kinds. The 
Aberdeenshire yellow is also in general use, and is much esteemed. 

As the second crop of clover is now rarely so good as it was 
after the first application of lime, or marl, a proportion of tares or 
vetches is sown to supply its place, in the autumn. The farmers 
usually supply themselves with rye-grass seeds. From 1 to 2 
bushels of it, with from 4 to 6 pounds red, and from 2 to 4 pounds 
white clover, are sown into the acre. Flax was formerly raised 
here in great quantities, -as the soil in many places is thought to 
be well adapted to it ; but as this article can be procured by im- 
portation, at a cheaper rate, the sowing of it is now quite given up. 

The rents of the farms occupied under the old leases are paid 
partly in grain, and partly in money ; but the usual duration of the 
leases now granted is nineteen years, for a money rent only. And 
the rents under the modern leases are very moderate, and favour- 
able to improvement; yet they who occupy under the old leases, 
have in general carried their improvements farther than they either 
would or could have done, had they been less favourably situated. 

Farm Buildings.— Yvoxa. the abundance of stones and slates in 
the parish, the farm buildings are, in most instances, substantially 
built and covered with slates ; and not less than 1400 acres are 
inclosed and subdivided with stone fences, besides various other 
inclosures with whin hedge and ditch. 

Previous to 1770, various farms in the parish were, from the 
nature of the soil, " thought to be better adapted for pasture than 
for grain, and were occupied by farmers in the neighbouring pa- 
rishes, as grazing farms called out-rooms for their cattle in the 
sunimpr ; but ever since that time, the proprietors have obliged the 



CARMYLIE. 



369 



tenants to reside in them." An improved system of husbandry 
seems to have commenced about that time, so that the " grain 
produced was increased fourfold in the course of twenty- six years 
thereafter." 

During the last thirty years, great additions have been made 
to the cultivated land of the parish, by cultivating wastes, drain- 
ing mosses, marshes, &amp;c. ; the enclosures mentioned have been 
made, and almost all the wood has been planted. 

From the plan alluded to, of Lord Panmure's part of the pa- 
rish, it appears that, from 800 to 900 acres have been added since 
1770 to the cultivated land, upon that part; and there is every 
reason to believe that, on the other parts of the parish, the acces- 
sion has been proportionably great. And while the parish in ge- 
neral, from the nature of its subsoil, requires much draining, it for- 
tunately abounds in the most suitable materials for this purpose ; 
an advantage which the tenantry have not failed to improve ; by 
which means, not only is its produce considerably increased, but 
its climate also is materially improved. The productiveness of its 
soil might indeed be still further increased, were it in the vicinity 
of a town where a supply of street manure could be procured ; but 
the price of that article in Arbroath the nearest town is so high, 
and the distance so considerable, that though this plan has been 
attempted, it is not likely to be followed out to any extent, or that 
It would be attended with any advantage sufficiently remunerat- 
mg. 

' But improved as the parish is, and might still further be, in its 
soil, climate and productiveness, it must still continue, as is the 
case at present, inferior in these respects to most of the adjacent 
districts, owmg to certain obstacles arising, not from any want of 
encouragement on the part of the landlord, nor of capital or skill 
on the part of the tenant, but from its high and exposed situation, 
and from its cold and retentive subsoil. Hence our spring opera- 
tions are retarded-the young grass is apt to be thrown out-vege- 
tation IS late in commencing, never making much progress till to- 
wards the end of Jane : our harvest in general is about a fortnight 
later and therefore more precarious, and the quahty of our grain, 
particu arly of our wheat and barley, thereby considerably dete- 
riorated. 

Q«arm.._ Various quarries of excellent materials for common 
purposes, are worked in the parish ; but, so far as has yet been dis- 
covered, the strata affording pavement and slates do not extend 



370 FORFARSHIRE. 



beyond the range already mentioned, with the exception of soime 
towards tlie north-western extremity of the parish. Though these ■ 
have been quarried, for slates, for many years, yet it is only with- 
in the last thirty years that they have been worked for pavement 
to any extent.  About sixty labourers are employed in them for 
the season. They are worked in the common way : as the seams 
which lay nearest the surface consisted chiefly of slates, they have 
been mostly worked out. The best pavement and slate strata can be 
split into plates of from 1 inch to 14 inches in thickness, for pave- 
ment, and of any portable dimensions, and of 1 inch to 1 inch m 
thickness for slates. The pavement is squared in the quarry. The 
slates are used in the neighbouring country. Upwards of thirty 
carts are employed in carrying the pavement to Arbroath, at the 
rate of from 4s. to 6s. per 100 superficial feet, where it is ship- 
ped for Leith, London, Glasgow, Aberdeen, and various other 
places ; that which is so well known by the name oi Arbroath pave- 
ment being chiefly from this parish. The sales have increased 
considerably since the coast duty was taken off". Pavement 
rock of a fine grain and of a bluish-colour, with a shade mchnmg 
to green, is found of sufficient thickness for stair steps of any 
size. It is also suitable for columns, balusters, and other archi- 
tectural ornaments. A stratum of light-coloured pavement is oc- 
casionally found, which is finely variegated with dark cloudy spots 
and veins, which, when pohshed and varnished, has a beautiha 
appearance, resembling dark-coloured marble, and answers well 
for chimney jambs, lobby tables, &amp;c. The pumps required for 
drawing off" the water from the quarries, are driven by wmdmills, 
with moveable wooden frames.f . .

Manufactures. — There are no spinning-mills in the parish. A 
considerable number of the population are employed in the weav- 
ing of coarse linens, on account of merchants and mill-spinners in 
Arbroath and Dundee, from whom the yarns are obtained by car- 
riers weekly. Many families are supported, chiefly by this branch 
of manufacture. As the pavement quarries are not worked in win- 
ter, a few slates only being there raised when the weather permits, 
several of the quarriers having been bred to the loom, resume that 
employment, during that season. 

Since the year 1820 the spinning of flax by machinery has ra- 
pidly mcreased in the neighbouring towns, and many oftheyouno- 
women have, in consequence, betaken themselves to weaving 
This new employment for young women cannot be so conducive 
to health, as the ordinary labours of female servants; and, in the 
event of their becoming wives, forms no good training for their 
management of household aff"airs. From the increased number of 
hands employed in weaving, one very beneficial effect results, in the 
employment thus aff-orded to various old women in filling pirns — 
the only work now left for them, since the improvements in machi- 
nery have rendered the gains at hard spinning, so very trifling

Means of Communication.— The nearest market-town is Ar- ' 
broatli, which is about seven miles distant from the centre of the 
parish. The nearest post-office is at Muirdrum, a small village in 
the parish of Panbride, about four miles distant ; but our commu- 
nication is chiefly with Arbroath. There is no turnpike road in 
the parish. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church, though not in the cen- 
tre of the parish, is yet sufliciently convenient for the greater part 
of the population. It is about 3| miles distant from the north- 
east extremity of the parish, and about 3 miles from the south-west 
extremity ; about 3 miles from the western, and from the south- 
eastern extremities about 1 mile ; but the greater number of the 
population are only from 1 to 2 miles distant from the church. It 
was built, probably soon after the erection of the parish ; but no date 
is to be seen. It is a substantial building of ashler work,-|- is in 
good repair and decently fitted up. It affords accommodation for 
600 sitters, but requires to be enlarged, as, from the increased po- 
pulation, there has been a considerable deficiency of church-room 
for some time past. The manse was built in 1820, and is substan- 
tial and commodious. The glebe, including the garden and site 
of manse and offices, and a mortification of about 7 acres, contains 
about 16 acres Scots. It is difficult to state the value of it very 
correctly, but I should think it not less than L. 30 annually. The 
stipend is one of the lowest class, and receives an addition of 
L. 31, 9s. 9d. Sterling, from the Exchequer, to make it up to L. 150 
per annum, exclusive of L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion eleme.nts.§ 

• The amount of the population in these parts of the parish, which are more than 
two miles distant from the parish church, is under 240.

in modern times : the principal heritor at that time hecame bankrupt, it is said, m 
consequence of his great exertions to have his parish church built m a superioripan-

All the families of the parish, with the exception of two, attend 
the Established Church ; and nearly all, the parish church. There 
are 5 members of the United Associate Synod ; 3 independents ; 
1 Baptist, and 1 Episcopalian. Divine service is well attended, 
and the regularity of ihe parishioners in this respect is very ex- 
emplary. The annual average number of communicants is 500, in- 
cluding about 35 from neighbouring parishes, who are remote from 
their parish churches. 

Owing to the depressed state of the poor's funds for many years, 
and the consequent difficulty of meeting the demands for parochial 
relief, without having recourse to compulsory assessments, there 
have been but few collections in the church for extra-parochial 
purposes, either religious or charitable ; and the annual average of 
which for the ten years preceding 1831, may be stated at L. 2. 

Education. — Besides the parochial school, there is a private 
school, built by subscription, situated in the south-west part of the 
parish, f The branches of education generally taught in the pa- 
rish school are, English, reading, and grammar, writing, arithme- 
tic, and Latin ; and in the private school, reading, writing, and 
arithmetic. The yearly salary of the parochial teacher is the maxi- 
mum, L. 34, 4s., and the annual average amount of school fees, in- 
cluding payment for some articles of stationery is from L. 1 8 to L. J 9. 
The teacher of the private school has his school-room rent free, 
but has no salary. The number of scholars, and consequently the 
amount of fees, vary with the teacher for the time. The present 
teacher states the annual average of his school fees for the last two 
years, at about L. 20. The parochial teacher has the legal accom- 
modations. 

I am not aware of any young persons between six and fifteen 
years of age, who have not received or are not now receiving instruc- 
tions in reading;— nor of any persons in the parish upwards of fifteen 
years of age who cannot read. There may be many of the latter

class who Ccinnot write ; but there is reason to behave that nearly 
all the young people who have attended school of late years have 
received instructions in writing. 

The number of scholars present at the annual examination of the 
parish school for the three years preceding 1831, averaged 61 ; 
the number, on the roll, 64. The greatest number attending school 
in 1831 amounted to 124, of whom 60 attended the parish school ; 
40 the private school ; and the remainder, a private school adjoin- 
ing a remote part of the parish. The distance of that part, con- 
taining a population of about 100, is such as to prevent the at- 
tendance of the children at the parish school, more especially as 
the young are now sent to school at an earlier age than was usual 
in fotmer days. There was a private school in that quarter, which 
has been discontinued of late, and no additional school seems to 
be required for their accommodation, as a parish school, and the 
private school alluded to, are in their neighbourhood. 

Though the number now attending school  be not so great as 
could be wished, it is yet greater in proportion to the population 
than the number stated as attending in my predecessor's time, when 
the population was 700, — a fact which seems to imply an increase of 
intelligence on the part of the parents, in appreciating more highly 
the benefits of education; and, so far as I have had an opportunity 
of judging, I am inchned to think, that an increase of intelligence 
has become visible, particularly amongst the young, within the last 
twelve or fifteen years. 

Literature. — A parochial library was instituted here in 1828, 
and is under the management of the kirk-session. The readers pay 
Is. per annum, for the purpose of keeping the books in repair, and 
of purchasing a few additional volumes. It is hoped that this in- 
stitution, while it tends to increase the intelligence, will also tend 
to promote the religious and moral improvement of the people. 

There is another library in the parish, which was instituted se- 
veral years ago, by an ingenious young man, who taught at that 
time a private school in that quarter. It is managed and supported 
by the people in that part of the parish, and, so far as I can learn, 
is in a prosperous state, and likely to prove conducive to their im- 
provement. 

Charitable and other Institutions.— A. Friendly Society was in- 

» This number, I am glad to find, is increasing, for the number of scliolars in 
February 1833, attending the parish school, and the private schools mentioned snice 
last census, amounts to 147,— while the population since last census has increased 
about 12.

stituted here in 1816, and consisted of about 200 members, be- 
longing to this and to some of the neighbouring parishes. It appear- 
ed to be in a very prosperous state ; but dedining to adopt the re- 
gulations contained in a late Act of Parliament, regarding such 
societies, it was, in 1830, dissolved by mutual consent, and the 
funds divided among the members. I hoped that a new society, 
founded on more correct principles, would have succeeded it; but 
many of these to whom such associations would prove most bene- 
ficial, seem now less inclined than formerly to enter into them. 

There is no savings-bank in the parish, and the nearest of this 
description is at Arbroath, instituted a considerable time ago.  

Poor and Parochial Fu7ids.—T\ie annual average number of 
persons receivmg parochial aid for the last seven years is 16; and 
the annual average sum allotted to each is L.2, 16s. Sd f 'xhe 
annual average of contributions for their rehef, for the'above years 
is, 1. ordmary and extraordinary collections at church, L. 43 4s 
•9d.; 2. proclamation dues, 18s. 8d.; 3. mortcloth dues, L l' Os.

larmyhe market, 2s.; 8. donations, 7s. 3d.; total L. 59 lOs 7d 
The only other regular mode adopted in the parish, for procur- 
ing funds for the poor, besides that of church collections, is bv let 
tmg annually certain sittings in the church, which were erected 
nany years ago, by the kirk-session from the poor's funds, for be- 
half of the parish poor; and from the rents received, a small but 
permanent surplus fund has been obtained for some years pas 
Thei. IS another mode occasionally had recourse to, for'the relf 
of individual distress or misfortune. A written statement of the 
case IS sent round among the wealthier parishioners, and recom 
mended to their notice by the kirk-session. Such recoml X 

raised in this way, are generally such as to afford to the individual

It is much.to be regretted that the virtuous aversion to depen- 
dence upon parish charity, so common informer times, is now but 
seldom met with in this quarter, and that there is, generally speak- 
ing, but little disposition among the poor to refrain from seeking pa- 

"'S-There is an annual market, chiefly for cattle, held in 
the narish about the end of April. 

iZ -There are three publichouses in the parish ; two of them 
are on the principal roads that intersect the parish, and one in the 
nelhbourhood of the quarries. Though sorne such houses of re 
Sment may be necessary in this as in other parishes, for the 
accommodation of the public, yet I should not like to see their 
number increased in this quarter. 

Before sea-borne coals came mto use in this quarter, the 
nantry on Lord Panmure's lands are said to have procured their 
uel f-m the moss already mentioned ; and though it be now much 
finished in extent, it still affords many of the poorer classes m 
its neighbourhood their principal supply of that article. But Eng

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The present state of the parish is, in many /P' 
ent from that which existed at the time when the last Statistical Ac

ed as consisting in its increased population and rental, and m its

rleswere then worked chiefly for slates; they are now worked chiefly 
for pavement, and to a much greater extent, — the annual amount 
of sales from them exceeding the yearly rental of the land. Many 
enclosures have been made, more substantial than the fences at 
that time, — great improvements have been made in all the imple- 
ments of husbandry, — and in the management of land, an extend- 
ed and much improved cultivation of the soil has taken place, — 
not only supplying food in greater quantity, but of a more whole- 
some and nourishing quality than had been enjoyed in former 
times; and I am inclined to think, that, owing to this and to the great 
extent to which draining has been carried in the parish, a great im- 
provement has taken place in the salubrity of its climate, and in 
the health of its inhabitants. Great improvements also in point 
of comfort, accommodation, and cleanliness, have taken place in 
the houses of all classes, and there can be no doubt that, general- 
ly speaking, they are far better fed, clothed, and lodged than 
their forefathers. Farm-steadings also are much better construct- 
ed, and more substantially built. In some instances, cultivation 
has been extended too far in reclaiming soils of very inferior qua- 
lity, which, though they gave a tolerable return when the prices of 
grain were high, and upon the first application of lime or marl, 
now show a strong tendency to revert to their original state of 
whins or broom, — which vvould be far more agreeable to the eye 
than the bleak appearance which they now exhibit, and might be 
■more profitable than the miserable crops or scanty herbage which 
they now produce. 

Considering the high and exposed situation of the parish, plan- 
tations of wood are much wanted, both for ornament and shelter— 
and though there is much done in both these respects on the 
estate of Guynd, and a good deal also upon the Conansythe estate, 
yet the greater part of the parish has no protection from the north 
or east winds, and, though containing but a small proportion of un- 
cultivated land, has rather a bleak appearance from the want of 
woods and of hedge-rows. Besides the wastes alluded to, a pro- 
portion of the land in cultivation on almost every farm might be 
more profitably occupied with plantations of wood,— which, if ju- 
diciously laid out, would greatly improve the climate of the parish, 
and the productiveness of the soil, and, if properly attended to, 
would, besides gradually meliorating the soil, give a far greater re- 
turn than can possibly arise from it in any other way. 

Some years ago a new line of road was projected from the pa-

rish, to the village of East Ha'en on the coast ; and were It execut- 
ed, it would be of great benefit to the parish, in shortening the car- 
riage of lime and coals. 

The principal road which intersects the parish from south to 
north, and its branch leading to Arbroath, are much improved and 
kept in good repair ; but the bye-roads in general stand much in 
need of improvement.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNDEE, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. DAVID B. MELLIS, MINISTER. 



I. Topography and Natural History. 

]Jame.—Tu appellation " Tealing" is said to be of Gaelic ex- 
traction, and is understood to denote a " country of brooks or wa- 
ters." The parish lies along the southern slope of the Sidlaw 
hills. The greater part of Craig Owl, the highest of the Sidlaw 
range, is situated in the parish of Tealing. A line drawn nearly 
along the summits of the hills which have been mentioned, would 
divide the parish of Tealing from that of Glammis on the north. 
The Fithie, a considerable burn, separates it from the united pa- 
rishes of Mains and Strathmartine ; on the south, and towards the 
east and west, it is bounded by the parishes of Murroes and Auch- 
terhouse. From the south-west to the north-east extremity of the 
parish, the distance is about seven miles, and its mean or average 
breadth may be estimated at about two miles. 

Geology. The geological phenomena which the district exhi- 
bits, are of a very common-place character. In the more elevat- 
ed parts of the parish, the rocks in general present a grey and some- ■ 
what slaty appearance and structure ; in lower situations, freestone 
would seem to predominate; and there are occasional indications of 
that kind of whinstone which may be advantageously applied to the 

formation of roads. 

In descending from the hills, the higher portions of the amb e 
part of the parish are seen to be composed of a comparatively

light gravelly soil ; but when the descent has been continued, and 
the general character of the land been examined, clay and a dark 
loam blended in various proportions, and sometimes occurring al- 
most without any intermixture, are found to be the prevailing in- 
gredients. The depth of the soil may be said to range from one 
to three feet, and the substratum is hard and cold, being either 
rock or till. 

From the description which has been given, it might be infer- 
red that the soil and climate would be naturally somewhat cold 
and humid ; and in former times, a cold humidity seems to have 
been a distinguishing characteristic of both. But the practice of 
drammg having been for many years carried on very extensively, 
and with much judiciousness, the general character both of the soil 
and climate has been greatly amehorated. 

In some of the more elevated and remote districts of the pa- 
rish, grouse, black-cock, and deer may be found. 

II. — Civil History. 

Mr Glass, the founder of the " Glassites," was minister of the 
parish of Tealing, at the time of his deposition ; and another clergy- 
man, while in that situation, evinced a decided attachment to the 
views of the Independents ; but, notwithstanding, there are now 
only one Glassite and one Independent in the parish. 

Land-oioners.— The chief land-owners are, Mr Scrymseour of 
Tealing, and Lord Douglas. There are four farms which belong 
to four other heritors. 

III. — Population. 

Population in 1811, . 779 
1821, . 725 
1831, . 766 

In former times, the population seems to have been rather more 
numerous than at present. Any change which has occurred in 
this respect may be ascribed to the enlarging of farms, and to the 
tendency which the improved mode of manufacturing certain 
kinds of cloth unquestionably has to attract individuals to our 
populous towns. 

There are in the parish four or five hamlets, the united popu- 
lation of which may be estimated at 270; and the remainino- 500 
inhabitants occupy the flirm-houses, or reside in the cottages 

The yearly average of births for the last seven years may be 
said to be about 17 ; deaths, 8 ; and marriages, 5.

The family of Mr Scrymseour, of Tealing, is the only one of in- 
fluence or importance, resident in the parish. 
. There are six proprietors of land of the yearly value of L. 50 

and upwards. ,  -i • r 

The average number of children m each family is 5. There 

is one fatuous person in the parish.

Larch and Scotch firs are the prevailing kinds of trees : but the 
management as to yearly thinning, periodical felhng, prunmg, and 
the like, does not seem to be deserving of commendation. 

Bent of Land.— The average rent of arable land per bcotch 
acre in the parish, is L. 1, 15s. The average rent of grazing is at 
the rate of L. 3 for an ox or cow grazed for the year. 
. ffTages — A common country labourer receives at the rate ot iOs. 
in summer, and 9s. in winter per week. A common farm-servant 
receives about L. 10, 10s. of yearly wages, 6 bolls of oatmeal, 
and 1 Scotch pint of milk per day. 

• Live Stock, §-c.-The Angus-shire breed of cattle is m common 
•use • and although other breeds have been occasionally introduced, 
a preference has been, in general, ultimately evinced for the Angus- 

In 'former times, the water which descended from the hills, was al- 
lowed to diffuse itself over the surface of the ground, and the practice 
of irrigation was to a considerable extent carried on; but the water 
is now confined to rivulets or enclosed in drains; and this change 
has been productive of important advantages, with reference to the 
soil, and also in regard to the mode of thrashing the corn. Ihe 
ground is now in general comparatively dry, and there are about 
thirteen thrashing-machines in the parish, driven by water As to 
cropping, the prevaihng mode is to subject any one field to the 
following rotation : green crop, barley with grass, hay crop, pas- 

tnre and afterwards oats. 

The distance from Dundee being only five or s,x mrte, a ready 
and e itle market is obtained for all kinds of agncultural pro- 
duce, and, on the other hand, the transportat.on of manure fiom 
the town to the country is carried on to a great extent.

As to the state of farm-buildings and enclosures in the parish, a 
favourable report may be given. The general duration of leases 
is nineteen years, and a yearly money rent is, by the existing leases, 
payable. 

There are some quarries in the parish, from which a good deal 
of pavement is extracted, and conveyed to Dundee.

There are employed in the parish, in carrying on agricultural 
operations, about 140 work-horses. And there are maintained 
about 280 milk cows, whose produce is very advantageously dis- 
posed of to the large and rapidly increasing population of Dun- 
dee. But the annual value thereof is of course intended to be in- 
cluded in the value which has been assigned to the produce on, 
which the cows subsist. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

The nearest market-town is Dundee, and the distance to it, as 
has been incidentally stated, is five or six miles. 

Means of Communication. —The turnpike road from Dundee to 
Aberdeen by Forfar intersects the eastern extremity of the parish, 
and the rail-road from Dundee to Newtyle passes'through a por- 
tion of the parish near its south-west boundary. The parish roads 
have been of late much improved, but they are still very suscep- 
tible of improvement. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church and the manse are 
nearly in the centre of the parish, and whether distance or popu- 
lation be considered, a more eligible situation for them could not 
have been chosen. The church was built about the year 1806— 
IS m excellent condition, and contains sittings for 700 individuals. 
The manse was built about the year 1803, and has undergone 
such alterations, and received such repairs, as make it very comfort- 
able. The extent of the glebe is 5 acres, and its annual value 
may be estimated at L. 14. As to the stipend, it is 10 chalders, 
and L. 30. There is not any place for public worship in the pa- 
rish except the Established Church, and all the inhabitants of the 



382 



FORPARSIIIRE. 



parish, with the exception of four or five individuals, adhere to the 
establishment. Divine service at the Established Church is well 
attended. The average number of communicants is about 450. 
The average amount of church collections yearly for religious and 
charitable objects, is about L. 50. 

Education.— There are 5 schools in the parish, namely, 1 pa- 
rochial school, and 4 schools in detached situations, for compara- 
tively young children. The parochial schoolmaster has the maxi- 
mum salary, and his house and the school-room are in good con- 
dition. 

The general expense of education per month or year is so rea- 
sonable as to place it within the reach of almost all. The very 
few children whose parents cannot afford to pay for their educa- 
tion, have their school fees paid from those funds which are un- 
der the control of the session. All the inhabitants above six or 
eight years of age can read, and a great majority of them are qualifi- 
ed to write. The people in general are adequately alive to the 
benefits of education. There is one parochial library, which is re- 
garded by the inhabitants with a lively interest, and is flourishing 
accordingly. 

Poor.— The average number of persons receiving parochial aid 
is 10, and the average sum allotted to each per month is 5s. or 6s. ; 
but, besides those persons who receive statedly parochial aid, there 
are some to whom money, according to their circumstances, is oc- 
casionally given ; and a considerable sum is annually expended on 
fuel and clothing. 

The ordinary collections made in the church for the support of 
the poor, amount to about L. 30 per annum. The other sources 
of revenue are the interest of money, mortcloth dues, &amp;c. There 
has not been remarked any tendency in individuals to throw them- 
selves unwarrantably on the parochial funds, nor has there on the 
other hand been observed any particular delicacy in accepting aid 
from these funds, when it has been actually needed. There are 
in the parish one inn and two ale-houses, but they do not appear 
to have produced to any considerable extent, a deteriorating effect 
on the morals of the people. 

Fuel— Coals chiefly English .brought fi'om Dundee, are m 
common use ; but in certain districts of the parish, the quantities 
of broom and furze, which may be easily procured, tend to lessen 
considerably the annual expenditure of the people for fuel.

PRESBYTEEY OF ARBROATH, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. DAVID CARRUTHERS, MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — This parish, which is landward, was anciently called 
Idvie, owing to the glebe being situated in the barony of Idvies, — 
with the etymology of which vocable we are not acquainted. Its 
modern name, however, is Kirkden — evidently derived from the 
fact of the church being placed in a sort of dell or valley, which 
depressions are termed dens in this quarter. 

Extent and Boundaries. — In length from east to west, it mea- 
sures nearly 7 miles ; its greatest breadth is not more than 2 ; at 
one part, within a mile east of the church, it does not exceed a 
stone-cast in width ; and its whole superficies is nearly 7 square 
miles. It is bounded on the north, by Rescobie and Guthrie ; on 
the south, by Carmylie ; by Kinnell and Inverkeillor, on the east; 
and by Dunnichen, on the west. 

Topographical Appearances. — The parish is of an irregular fi- 
gure, but its surface, though gently undulated, is comparatively 
level, with the exception of a considerable ascent towards the 
south, formed by the termination of the Sidlaw Hills. From this 
elevation, the eye ranges over a rich and extensive panorama. Im- 
mediately around, are the mansions, woods, and lawns of many of 
the country gentlemen ; to the west, is the fertile and picturesque 
valley of Strathmore, on the back ground of which are the aspir- 
ing summits and grand rugged passes of the Grampian mountains; 
and to the east, are the towns, and bays, and headlands, along the 
coast. 

Meteorology, Sc. — The prevailing wind is from the east, which, 
during the months of spring, carries dense aqueous vapours, here 
termed eastern haars, exhaled from the German Ocean. No par- 
ticular disease can be said to prevail.

Hydrography. — At the junction of the parishes of Kirkden and 
Dunnichen, is a perennial well of a chalybeate nature, to which 
there seems to have been assigned extraordinary virtues in the 
curing of swellings and ulcers, even " after the applications of se- 
veral physicians had proved ineffectual." The small river Vinny, 
rising in the marsh or mire of Lower, in the parish and neighbour- 
hood of Forfar, washes the northern boundary of this parish for 
more than four miles ; it then enters the parish, and is shortly af- 
terwards joined by the Lunan, when they form together a consider- 
able stream called Lunan Water, which falls into the bay of that 
name near Redhead. From the marshy nature of the Vinny's 
origin and course, an immense body of water is accumulated in 
rainy weather, and poured down like a mountain torrent, inundat- 
ing the lower lands through which it flows. Both the Vinny and 
Lunan are excellent trouting streams, and the latter contains pike, 
owing to the circumstance of its rising out of the loch of Resten- 
net, and communicating with the lakes of Rescobie and Balgayies, 
which abound with that species of fish ; a few salmon ascend it in 
the spawning season, which commences in the middle of Septem- 
ber, and ends about a month thereafter. 

Geology md Mineralogy — The greater part of this parish rests 
upon a hard grey sandstone formation, similar to that which stretches 
through the valley of Strathmore. It seldom, however, presents 
itself in this neighbourhood, unless where artificial excavations or 
ravines, formed by the action of water, have laid it open. Hard 
masses of indurated clay are found to alternate ; but I am not 
aware that any remains of the animal or vegetable kmgdoms have 
been discovered in these strata, although several indistinct impres- 
sions of the latter kind are occasionally manifested. Trap rocks 
exist in the southern extremity of the parish, which are evidently 
a continuation of the Sidlaw Hills ; and, as the plains of the ad- 
jacent sandstone strata possess a coinciding direction, so it seems 
highly probable that both received their present dip and position 
from the same internal convulsion. These strata vary in their 
dip from 10° to 20°, inclining to the east and south-east. 

Boulders.— lrregn\av masses of primitive rocks of large dimen- 
sions are frequently met with in the recently cultivated portions of 
the parish. These chiefly consist of mica- slate, greenstone, gra-

nite, and gneiss. Tliey are all considerably attriturated, and whe- 
ther their transportation to their present locality is to be attributed 
to the Noachian deluge, or to whatever cause, the agency must 
have been tremendous. They are fully twenty miles distant from 
the Grampians, where they abound in situ, and in the interval 
there are very bold acclivities, which could not fail to impede 
their transference thither. There are very distinct traces of gla- 
cier action throughout the valleys of the Vinny and the Lunan. 
The moraines are exceedingly well marked. 

Soil, Sfc. — The soil being the debris resulting from the disinte- 
gration of our rocks, is chiefly a friable clay, sometimes mixed 
with gravel and arenaceous deposits. It is naturally cold and 
shallow, but owing to judicious tillage, and the importation of marl, 
which is abundant in the neighbouring lakes, it has of late been 
greatly improved, and is now capable of bearing every sort of cropi 

Quarries. — There are two excellent freestone quarries wrought,, 
as occasion requires, — which afford employment to a considerable 
number of men. 

Botany. — There is abundance of plantation in many parts of 
this parish, but little or no natural wood. The soil, when left 
uncultivated, seems disposed to produce whins, broom, fern, and 
heather. That extensive natural forests, at one time, however 
waved over this county, is abundantly vouched for by tradition. 

Among the plants seemingly indigenous, or now spontaneously 
produced by the soil, we find, besides the more ordinary kinds, 
the Orobus sylvaticus, Solanum Dulcamara, Eadiola millegrana, 
Chelidonium majus, Dipsacus sylvestris, Veronica Beccabunga, 
Cistus helianthemum, Trifolium ornithopodioides, T. striatum, Ti 
campestre, the latter often mistaken for T. pratense. Among' thd 
habitats of marshy districts and woods, are hundi— Menyanthes tri 
foliata, Nuphar lutea, and occasionally NymphcBu alba, Cicuta 
virosa, Subularia aquatica, Typha latifolia, kc. besides three spe- 
cies of Orchis, viz. viridis, albida, and conopsea. The poisonous 
Atropa Belladonna and Digitalis purpurea are abundant; and 
Flora at the proper season unfolds on the banks of rivulets and 
ravines, a rich display of varied garniture of the classes geranium, 
avens, anemonies, &amp;c. Wild mustard, Sinapis arvensis, is plentiful 
onthe cultivated lands, and proves highly pernicious to the crops; 

A.oology.—T\e breed of cattle reared here is superior, namely, 
tlie txalloway or polled kind ; although many people, not know, 
"g whence the aborigines were imported, ignorantly denominate 
mem the Angus breed. 



386 FOUFAUSHIRE. 

It cannot be said that we have any variety of birds or quadru- 
peds peculiar to this district. 

n. — Civil Histouy. 

Land-owners.— The only heritors of the parish are, Henry Bax- 
ter, Esq. of Idvies ;  Thomas Gardyne, Esq. of Middleton ;t 
Alexander Lyell, Esq. of Gardyne ; James Mudie, Esq. of Pit- 
muies; and John Watt, Esq. of Kinneries. The second and 
third mentioned gentlemen are natives of the parish, and dwell 
here ; the fourth'also resides in it ; and the first did so occasion- 
ally, at a handsome cottage erected on his estate. 

Parochial Begisters.— k register of parochial matters, from the 
year 1650 to 1690, after having been lost for a long while, was 
accidentally discovered by the predecessor of the present incum- 
bent ; one of the leaves having been casually sent from a shop in 
the neighbourhood. From the latter date to 1735, no records are 
known °to exist ; but they have since been regularly preserved to 

the present time. 

nizoMzYfes.— Opposite the mansion-house of Pitmuies, close by 
the turnpike road, there is an obelisk which has obviously been 
shortened by violence, or the abrasive influence of time, but is yet 
five feet high, with some mutilated hieroglyphics on it. It is nich- 
ed into a large stone, and is supposed to have been erected in the 
vear 1010, by Malcolm II. upon the defeat of the Danes. About 
fifty years ago, a tumulus was opened in the immediate vicinity of 
the stone in question, and several urns containmg ashes of the 
dead were discovered; and in the plain adjoining, nearly a score 
of stone coffins, placed laterally, were dug up, each containing an 
entire human skeleton. Stone coffins were recently discovered in 
the farm of BractuUo, containing human bones, with strings ot 
beads apparently made of charred wood. 

There are, in the parish, two artificial mounds of a conical h- 
ffure termed laws, from the circumstance of criminals having been 
Lecuted there during the feudal times. Both are ft present 
beautifully ornamented with trees. One of them "aojed BracUiUo 
Bractie law is on the estate of Idvies; the other, called the Gal- 
lows-hill, is on the lands of Gardyne. 

Anci:nt Buildings.-Th. Castle of Gardyne is a very fine spe- 
cimen of an old baronial residence, resembling in its style of ar-

chitecture the famous Castle of Glammis. It is luxuriantly em- 
bosomed in trees, on the precipitous bank of a beautiful ravine, 
which is enlivened by a murmuring stream of water. 

Modern Buildings. — The mansion-houses of Pitmuies and Mid- 
dleton are comparatively modern structures. They are situated 
on a plain near the banks of the Vinny, and the surrounding woods 
and lawns are as tastefully disposed as the equality of the ground 
will admit of.

Causes of increase — The chief cause of augmentation is evi- 
dently the increasing speculation in manufactures, which has re- 
cently induced operatives to feu houses, at a cheap rate, on the 
estate of Middleton. The village, called Friockheim, has, in con- 
sequence, a population of 803. 

Exclusive of hamlets, or cottons cot-towns, according to the 
orthography of the district, this is the only village in the parish ; 
hence, when its complement of inhabitants is deducted from the 
total population, the remaining 537 may be said to reside in the 
rural parts. 

The births for the last twelve years averaged 32 annually. 
There is no register of deaths kept; but the marriages during that 
time have been at the rate of 1 1 yearly.

There are no individuals or families in this parish who can pro- 
perly be said to be of independent fortune, except the heritors for- 
merly mentioned, all of whom are proprietors of land to the year- 
ly value of L.-200 and upwards. 

The number of bachelors and of widowers above fifty years of 
age, IS about 16; and of unmarried women upwards of 45, 21.

of children in each family is from 4 to 5. There are no houses 
uninhabited, with the exception of a few which are in a ruinous 
state, and some others in the course of being built. 

The unmarried agricultural male servants live together in small 
bouses, called bothies, or sheds of one apartment each, where they 
cook their own victuals, and act in every respect as their own ser- 
vants. The bad effects of this kind of residence on the ntiorals of 
the class of the people here alluded to, are justly described in other 

parts of this work. 

The people in general are very inoffensive, honest, and mdus- 
trious, and seem tolerably contented with their circumstances. 
They possess minds of native vigour and sagacity. They are 
punctual in attending church, and pay great respect to the ordi- 
nances of religion. 

Poaching is practised to some extent; but smuggling is now en- 
tirely abandoned. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Econormj.— The superficial contents of 
the parish are about 4514 imperial acres ; and all are under culti- 
vation excepting 1402, the greater part of which is planted, ihe 
remainder, consisting of 95 acres or thereby, is unworthy of cultiva- 
tion, and lies constantly waste or in pasture. The kinds of trees 
planted are, oak, ash, elm, plane, and beech, with arch, spruce, 
and occasionally silver firs to nurse. One-fourth of the whole is 
hard-wood. Great attention is paid to these plantations, by scien- 
tific thinning and pruning, &amp;c. The eastern division of the pa- 
rish is richly ornamented with trees of various sorts, some of which 
have attained a considerable magnitude and age ; and the fields 
on the estate of Idvies, to the west, are individually fringed with 
rows of trees, and in many places embellished with clumps of thriv- 
ing plantations, which, notwithstanding the presence of stone en- 
closures, impart a highly tasteful aspect. _ 

Rent ofLand.-The land has been greatly improved of ate, 
and its vilue has proportionally increased. This is e-dent frorn 
the fact of 15s. per acre having been the average rate at which 
the Ground was let in lease, not more than forty years ago, where- 
• as the average rate is fully twice that sum now. The grazing of 
an ox or cow costs about L.2 for the season. 

Hushandry,-The agriculturists of this parish and of the who 
of Wus have long been famous for their superior notions of _til- 
agt 'a hough it Sere perhaps difBcult to determine the special.

ties wherein they excel. The four or five shift rotation is employ- 
ed, and every species of crop is raised to good advantage. The 
estate of Idvies has, within the last forty years, been entirely re- 
claimed, from a bleak moor, to a warm and fertile condition, by 
judicious draining and planting, &amp;c. Leases commonly extend 
to nineteen years. The farm-buildings are in general very good, 
and the fences, which are of stone, are not bad ; but the paucity of 
hedges, notwithstanding trees are seldom absent, greatly impedes 
that luxuriance and warmth which the country would otherwise 
assume. The farmers, however, prefer the stone dikes, not only 
because they are more cheaply and expeditiously brought to per- 
fection, on account of their easy access to material ; but because 
hedges harbour birds, which destroy the crops. 

Baw Produce. — The following is a general estimate of the gross 
amount of raw produce raised in the parish. Of course it fluctuates

Manufactures— parish contains about 789 manufacturing 
operatives, employed in spinning flax and weaving Osnaburgh cloth, 
two-thirds of whom are females, and of these nearly four-fifths are 
weavers on the hand-loom. This resource makes female farm, 
servants very independent in their own eyes, because the equally 
lucrative employment of the loom or mill is at their acceptance.

Market-Towns, c-c— Arbroath and Forfar, the nearest market- 
places, are respectively five miles distant from the eastern and 
western extremities of the parish. 

The nearest Post- Offices are those of Forfar and Arbroath. 
Application was made to Government a few years ago, to establish 
a etter-carrier between Forfar and Arbroath via Letham, but the 
solicitation was rejected; although in all likelihood, no loss would 
fiave been sustained thereby; as a person has, for a number of 
years, made a very good livelihood by undertaking on his own 
account the post between Forfar and Letham.

Roads.— There are no toll roads in this parish, except near the 
middle, where the Arbroath and Forfar one occurs for about two 
miles and a-half. The road is a superior one, and is very conve- 
nient for a considerable portion of the parish. Roads, however, 
are numerous but not very good ; one of them connects Dundee 
and Brechin, and another Forfar and Arbroath. 

Rail-roads.— A railway, which intersects the eastern division ot 
this parish, was lately opened between Forfar and Arbroath, a dis- 
tance of fifteen miles. It communicates with another, which was 
opened about the same time betwixt the last-mentioned town and 
Dundee, and proceeds thence over the Sidlaw Hills and along 
Strathmore to Glammis, within five miles of Forfar. 

Ecclesiastical State.-The form of the parish is not unlike that 
of a pair of spectacles : and the church is placed in the least po- 
pulous division, and within 100 yards of its boundary. 

The large and growing village of Friockheim is m the other di- 
vision, and fully five miles distant. Under these circumstances, 
the Presbytery, aided by the Church Extension Committee, erect- 
ed a church about four years ago, for the convenience of the above 
village and neighbourhood, and the General Assembly granted a 
consltution, and provided that a section of the parish of Kirkden 
be disjoined, quoad spiritualia, and assigned to the new church as 
a parish ecclesiastical. The number of sittings in the church is 
397  eicrhteen inches each ; but as the accommodation is not ade- 
quate tohe demand, it is to be hoped that means may soon be 
taken to correct this. The sittings are let to parishioners, with 
Se exception of ten set apart, rent free, for the poor of the is- 
trict. The prices at which they are let are as follows : 25 at 2s. , 
240 at Is. 6d., and 122 at Is per annum.  , u 

The total population of the district attached to the church 
amounts to 1020: of these, by far the greater proportion resides 
[n the village, and none are farther removed than three mdes. 
A manse has also been erected for the clergyman. 
ThTpresent parish church of Kirkden was bui t on the site of 
the o d one in 1825, shortly after the induction of the present m 
cumbent. It affords accommodation for 525 sitters, allowing each 
ZTn inches Thirty individual sittings are set apart for the 
r . fi of the poor. At the same date, the manse was renovated 

. The church has since been enlarged, so as to accommodate about 500 s.tters.

stone and lime wall for espalier fruit trees, and the whole is well 
stored with every variety of garden produce. 

The glebe, consisting of about 7 acres, is chiefly loamy, and 
lies around the manse, which is close by the church. It has been 
much improved of late, — neatly enclosed, by the present incum- 
bent, with stone fences, and might be let at L.24 per annum. 

The stipend is one of those requiring aid from Government, the 
teinds being exhausted. The whole amount of what the heritors 
pay in money is L.718, 6s. 3|d. Scots, besides in victual, 32 bollsi 
3 firlots, 3 pecks, 1 lippie meal ; and 5 bolls, 3i lippies bear; and 
L.l Sterling, in lieu of a moor which is planted. From the above 
is deducted L.8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. Thus in order 
to make up the stipend to L.l 50 per annum, the sum of L.67, 1 Is. 
lOd. Sterling is annually received from the Exchequer. 

A catechetical meeting is held by the clergyman every Sabbath 
evening in the school-room, and is well attended both by young 
and old. He has been also in the habit of holding prayer and 
missionary meetings weekly in the same place. 

All the people in the parish belong to the Established Church, 
excepting fifty of several Dissenting denominations. The church 
is well attended, not only by the parishioners but by a number of 
the inhabitants of Letham, who, owing to proximity, prefer it to 
their own parish church. Owing, however, to the parish of 
Friockheim having been entirely taken from this, the church of 
Kirkden is perhaps now unnecessarily large, the population being 
reduced to about 500, and several families being still four miles 
distant. Prior to the division of this parish, the communicants 
averaged upwards of 400 on every occasion of a sacrament; and 
the annual collections L.30; of course both are now proportion- 
ally decreased. 

Education. — Besides the parish- school, there is one supported 
by subscription in the village of Friockheim. All the branches 
usually taught in parish schools are taught in both, if requested, 
by able and experienced teachers. The parochial schoolmaster 
has the legal accommodation, which is certainly very paltry, and 
receives an annual salary of L. 25, 13s. lOd., besides about L. 6 
per annum for officiating as session-clerk. 

The amount of fees is trifling, owing to the school being situat- 
ed in the most awkward corner of the parish that could have been 
chosen for the convenience of pupils. The parish, however, is 
sufficiently accommodated in respect of education, by the various 



392 



FORFARSHIRE. 



schools in the neighbouring parishes. Notwithstanding the low 
rate of fees, it cannot be said that the people are sufficiently alive 
to the benefits of education. As soon as the majority of the ope- 
ratives can speak of manufacture, and speculate on parliamentary 
proceedings, they have attained their acme of intellectual cultiva- 
tion. The father allows his children to attend school until they 
can read the Bible ; but an ordinary acquaintance with the ele- 
ments of arithmetic, &amp;c. is a luxury to be classed with the study 
of the dead languages, and is chiefly confined to the sons of the 
wealthy and comparatively independent. 

Literature. — There is a parochial library, which owes its com- 
mencement to James Douglas, Esq. of Cavers, who presented 72 
volumes for that purpose in 1827. It was some years ago in- 
creased by James Mudie, Esq. of Pitmuies. Its management is 
vested in the kirk-session, and the books are eagerly sought after 
by the parishioners. It is chiefly composed of religious books. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — At present, the number of pau- 
pers is 13, besides those who get occasional relief. Each at an 
average gets an allowance of L.5, 2s. annually. There are week- 
ly collections at church, each averaging 1 Is. Gd., which go to- 
wards their support. Besides, there belongs to them a sum of 
L.260, which is at interest ; and they have the proceeds of a few 
seat rents in the church. It is but right to mention that Miss 
Gardyne of Middleton, at her decease in 1831, beqeathed L.14 
to the poor's fund, and her sister, Miss Grizel, left L.20 to the 
same charity. 

Inns, Alehouses, Sc. — The number of alehouses is six, but it 
cannot be said that the parishioners are at all addicted to ine- 
briety. All the alehouses are in the quoad sacra parish of Friock- 
heim. 

Fuel — Newcastle coal is the chief fuel used in this quarter ; 
and Arbroath is the nearest harbour whence it can be procured. 
It usually costs about 1 4s. the cart-load of twelve barrels, exclu- 
sive of carriage ; which latter will no doubt be considerably re- 
duced by the opening of the railway formerly mentioned. 
Miscellaneous Observations. 

Since the date of the last Statistical Account, the appearance 
of this parish has been entirely changed. Old plantations have 
been cut away, and houses and fields of grain occupy their locali- 

• This sum has been greatly drawn upon, and diminished of late years, by the in- 
creasing demands of an increasing pauperism.

ties : and thriving forests are now waving, where forty years ago 
there was nothing but heath and marshes. The state of agricul- 
ture has greatly advanced, although it is an indubitable fact that 
the hind might be rendered still more productive by a more 
thorough draining and fencing. The treatment of the estate of 
Idvies in the west end of the parish has proved this to a demon- 
stration. 

Shelter is especially wanted in the centre of the parish, and 
were the fields regularly enclosed with hedge-rows, and forest 
trees planted, they would prove of signal benefit to the land. 
When the last Statistical report was written, there were compa- 
ratively few manufacturing operatives in this parish. The large 
village of Friockheim has since sprung up, and is almost entirely 
occupied by weavers and mill-spinners. 

That agriculture and manufactures have greatly progressed can- 
not be denied, but whether the permanent position which the lat- 
ter now occupies has redounded to the moral and religious well- 
being of the district, may be justly questioned.

PRESBYTERY OF ARBROATH, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS, 

THE REV. GEORGE WALKER, MINISTER. 



I- — Topography and Natural History. 

Name.—Tn word " Kinnell," if, as is most probable, it signi- 
fies « Bankhead" in the Gaelic language, is descriptive of the si- 
tuation of the church ; for the hillock on which the church stands 
is about forty feet higher than the adjacent haugh, and slopes more 
or less abruptly on three sides, down to the level of the river Lu- 
nan, and its subsidiary streamlet the Whauk burn. 

Extent, Sfc— The surface of the parish may be equal to about 
 square miles. The ground rises gradually from the south and 
west, and more abruptly from the north, so as to form the hill of 
Bolshan, and thence proceeds eastward, after a few alternate de- 
pressions and elevations, through Rossy moor, to the higher hill of 
Kmnoul, in the parish of Craig. 



394 FORFARSHIRE. 

The parish is bounded on the north, by the parishes of Far- 
nell and Marytown ; on the east, by the parishes of Craig, Lu- 
nan, and Inverkeilor ; on the south, by the parish of Inverkeilor ; 
and on the west, by the parishes of Kirkden, Guthrie, and Aber- 
lemno. Those parts of the parishes of Kirkden and Inverkeilor 
which are adjacent to the south-west corner of this parish were 
erected bv the General Assenably in 1836, into the new parochial 
district of Friockheim ; and in the beginning of the following year, 
Mr Thomas Wilson was ordained to the charge of the district by 
the Presbytery of Arbroath. 

Hydrography. — The river Lunan flows through the southern 
part of the parish for nearly two miles, and, after a farther course 
of about five miles, falls into Lunan Bay. In passing through 
the parish, it drives two spinning-mills, two meal and barley mills, 
and two thrashing-mills, with other machinery for the accommo- 
dation of a farm-steading. 

The Gighty burn, which separates this parish from Inverkei- 
lor on the east, falls into the Lunan, after driving three spinning- 
mills and two thrashing-mills in this parish ; while a similar extent 
of waterfall yet remains unoccupied on the Inverkeilor side. But 
the scarcity of water in the summer greatly diminishes the value 
of the falls. 

In Monthrewmont moor there is a large forest belonging to Sir 
James Carnegie. The greater part of what is within the bounds 
of this parish has been planted since 1820. The Scotch firs 
thrive best, ani more of them have been planted than of all the 
others reckoned together. And of these last, the order as to 
numbers is, larch, spruce, oak, ash, plane, elm, birch. Anciently 
there was a keeper of Monthrewmont moor, who was also proprie- 
tor of the lands of Muirmills in this parish. He had a right to 
4d. Scots for every ox, or other quadruped pasturing within the 
bounds of the moor, and to the same sum for every spade that cut 
turf in it for a day. And while he prevented the encroachments ot 
others, he could himself occupy and labour such parts as he 
thouoht proper, and erect the necessary accommodation of houses. 
About fifty years ago, the moor was divided among the contermi- 
nous proprietors, and such others as had aright of commonty, ac- 
cording to their several interests. 

Civil History. 
At present, the parish is divided into four properties or estates ; 
-Bolshan, belonging to Sir James Carnegie, Bart, of Southeskr 



I.: 



KIN.VUI.L. 



395 



Wester Braky, belonging to the Right Honourable Lord Panmure; 
Easter Braky, belonging to the heirs of the late Colin Alison, 
Esq. ; and Rinmure, belonging to the heirs of the late John Laing, 
Esq. The valued rents of these estates, according to the valuation 
of 1682, are, respectively, L.1600, L.500, L.300, and L.300 
Scotch. 

Bolshan, anciently Balishan, is said to have been gifted to the 
abbey of Arbroath, about 1178, by Donald, Abbot of Brechin, 
and the gift was confirmed by King William the Lion, under the 
name of Ballegillegrand. In the latter half of the following cen- 
tury, the monks feued it for six merks of annual feu-duty, and 
afterwards they consigned the feu-duty, with half a merk more from 
another source, to the Bishop and chapter of Brechin, for sup- 
porting a chaplain in the church of Brechin, and upholding a 
bridge over the Esk. Before the middle of the fourteenth century, 
Margaret de Abernethy, the Countess-Dowager of Angus, gave 
Brakko to the abbey of Arbroath for a daily mass at the altar of 
St Catharine, in behalf of her husband's soul and her own, and 
the souls of their progenitors and heirs. In 1443, Sir John Ogilvy 
of Lentrathen and Airly was proprietor both of Bolshan and Brak- 
ko ; the latter of which Abbot Walter had sold to him for an an- 
nual feu-duty of eight merks that same year, under the pretence 
that the intricacy and uncertainty of the marches boded future 
detriment to the interests of the abbey. In 1528, Lord Ogilvy 
resigned both of them into the hands of the Abbot, and received 
a new charter. In 1634, Bolshan was sold to David, the first 
Earl of Southesk, of whom Arthur Johnston, the celebrated 
translator of the Psalms into Latin elegiac verse, says, 

" Nec numero clauduntur opes, nec limite rura, 
Carnegi: servat mens tamen alta modum." 

And so great was the power of the two houses of Airly and South- 
esk at that time, that they would have been able to keep Forfar- 
shn-e in its allegiance to Charles L if they had not been over- 
powered from without. In 1716, on the attainder of the fifth 
Larl Bolshan fell to the Crown. In 1720, ft was sold to the 
York Buildings' Company; and in 1764, on the bankruptcy of 
the company, it was bought by Sir James Carnegie of Pittarrow, 
grandfather of the present proprietor, and representative of the 
ancient Earls of Southesk. 

. Sir Simon Eraser, heir, and, after his uncle's death, possessor 
01 the chieftamship of his clan, is said to have been rewarded by 



396 



FORFAIISIIIIIE. 



King Robert Bruce with the barony of Kinnell, for gallant con- 
duct in the battle of Bannockburn, and to have been thence called 
Knight of Kinnell, during his uncle's lifetime. 

In 1407, Hugh Eraser of Lovat and Kinnell granted to his 
cousin, Peter de Striveline, a charter of the lands ofEaster Braky, 
in the barony of Kinnell. The Strivelines have had various suc- 
cessors in the seventeenth century. Sir James Ogilvy of New- 
grange, and his son, Sir Francis; in the eighteenth, Messrs Piper, 
Cooper, Gavin, great grandfather of the Marquis of Breadalbane, 
and Baird of Newbyth ; and in 1810, Messrs Alison and I.aing, 
by whom the estate was divided into two equal parts, — East Braky 
and Rinmure. 

In 1642, Thomas Fraser, a descendant of Thomas, the third 
Lord Lovat, was proprietor of West Braky ; and soon afterwards, 
Patrick Gray, and his son of the same name. Catholics, whom 
neither Presbytery nor Episcopacy could constrain to attend the 
Protestant worship. After these came Douglas of Brigford, and 
then three generations of Carnegies, who were descended from 
the house of Northesk ; and from them it passed by purchase, 
about 1740, to the late Earl of Panmure, who entailed it along 
with his other estates, and transmitted it to his grandnephew, the 
present proprietor. 

In 1659, the lands of Muirmills, along with the keepership of 
Monthrewmont Moor, belonged to Archibald Wood of Hilton, 
and soon afterwards merged in the estate of Bolshan. 

In the castle of West Braky there exists a memorial of the Era- 
sers,— a coat-of arms with the date 1581. The blazon of the 
arms is azure, three cinquefoils argent,— the cognizance of Eraser. 
Impaled with quarterly, first and fourth, gules three crescents of 
the second,— the arms of Pierrepont ; second and third, three mul- 
lets of the second,— the arms of Murray. There is no crest. 
Above the shield are the letters t. f. ; and over the letters is the 
motto, " Soli Deo confido." 

The foundation of the castle of Whitehills, which stood on the 
south side of the Lunan, and considerably higher up than the 
farm-steading of Kinnell's Mill, was dug up by the tenant, whose 
lease, after a°n occupancy of forty-three years, terminated in 1811. 
But it was a ruin in the seventeenth century, and furnished the 
materials for building what was called the Stone house, in the 
Kirktown of Kinnell, where a chamberlain or baronial officer re- 

3 



KINNELI.. 



397 



sided, witli the name of provost, in old time ; and latterly, the 
tenant of the Kirktown, with the same appellation. 

The castle of Bolshan, which, as Monipenny's Scottish Chro- 
nicles tell us in 1612, was Lord Ogilvy's special residence, has 
passed away with the other monuments of feudal grandeur. The 
cemetery and site of the chapel were subjected to the plough be- 
fore 1767. The last remains of the castle were removed soon 
after. And now, for a long while, there has been no other remem- 
brancer of the ancient glory of the place, than the peculiar appear- 
ance of the soil, a little to the westward of the present farm-house. 

The Ogilvies, as proprietors, perhaps, of Bolshan, seem to have 
had a sort of heritable claim to the bailiary of the abbey of Ar- 
broath. In the minority of Sir John Ogilvy, the Master of 
Crawfurd, availing himself of the distractions which prevailed over 
all Scotland, in consequence of the similar minority of King 
James II., obtained possession of the office. But his insolence 
and oppression soon disgusted the monks ; and the Ogilvies, un- 
der the conduct of Sir Alexander Ogilvy of Inverwharity, tutor of 
the claimant, took up arms to assert their right. The Earl of 
Crawford, who had hasted from Dundee to attempt a reconcilia- 
tion between the contending parties, was recklessly slain as he 
went forward to hold a conference with Sir Alexander. His 
death was the signal for a general engagement, and victory de- 
clared on the side of his son. About 500 of the Ogilvies were 
slam, and among them Sir John Oliphant of Aberdalgay, and five 
lesser barons. Sir Alexander Ogilvy was taken, and carried to 
the castle of his rival at Finhaven, where, in a few days, he died 
of grief and wounds; and the Earl of Huntly, who, having been 
accidentally Sir Alexander's guest, chose to partake of his quarrel 
as well as his hospitality, escaped only by the swiftness of his horse 
About 100 fell on the side of the victors. The battle was fought 
on the 24th January 1445-6, in the neighbourhood of Arbroafh • 
and men did not fail to remark the speedy punishment which over 
took the leaders of the two clans, and which they were unwittingly 

.th the Earl of Douglas, who had greatly increased the distrac- 
feonsof the times, they had been jointly engaged in plunder n. 
he vassals of the Bishop of St Andrews and, indeed,ere iu 
recently returned from Fife with their spoils. In memory of the 
battle, a spur and boot, which had belonged to one of the slain 

• Boetlui Hist. Lib. 18, fol. .365. Par. 1574.

chieftains, were hung up in the south aisle of Kinnell Church. 
After the aisle was unroofed, and excluded from the church in ■ 
1766, the boot speedily fell to decay ; but the spur still exists, 
measuring 8 inches in length, and 4 in breadth, and having a 
rowel as Targe as a crown piece. And the verses in which the 
feats of the combatants were sung, have not yet altogether passed 
awav from the remembrance of the people. 

In 1790 and 1805, there was found between Hatton and Hatton- 
mill in the face of the bank above the Lunan, a considerable 
number of silver pennies and halfpennies, which the owners had 
probably concealed in troublous times, and afterwards, through 
death or other accident, found no opportunity o bringing forth 
again for the purposes of hfe. In both cases, the earthen pots 
which contained them were but slightly sunk into the gravelly 
bank- and, what is remarkable, they were in both cases discover- 
ed by boys going to school, and those boys were brothers. It is 
said that there was no specimen of any rare com among them ; 
and accordingly, instead of passing into the cabinets of the curious 
thev were almost all of them melted down; and a portion of the 
atter finding still exists not far from the spot where they were 
ound, in an\rticle of convivial utility, a ladle for a punch bowl. 
A halfpenny, however, still remains of John Baliol, having on one 
de head"crowned in proBle and looking to the right, and a 
ceptre surmounted with a lily before it, with the legend, Jo- 
nXes Dei Gra and on the other side, a cross with a spur re.

Emperor Imperator by the army and senate; nineteen times 
invested with the tribunitian power ; and four times with the con- 
sulship." And consequently it refers to the year 156 of the 
Christian era. This emperor fixed the northern boundary of the 
Roman empire to the Forth and Clyde ; and though it does not 
appear that any province was erected permanently farther north, 
yet the transactions of commerce and war were sufficient to con- 
vey the Roman coin beyond the frontiers ; and we know, that, in 
the beginning of the following century, the Emperor Severus lost 
many thousands in pursuit of the natives along the whole line of 
the eastern coast of Scotland. 

On the top of the Wuddy-law, the highest point in the parish, 
there was a large tumulus or barrow, the diameter of which was 
about 45 yards, and the height 4. It was composed of alternate 
layers of stones and earth ; and while the stones were removed 
during a course of several years for the fiUing of drains, earthen 
vessels containing a black fattish mould were occasionally disco- 
vered. And not far off, are the Gallow-law and Pit, where, if we 
may believe tradition, capital punishments were inflicted in an- 
cient times. Above fifty years ago, a tenant cut across the top of 
this law, in the hope of falling in with hidden treasure, but he 
found nothing save some urns and half-burnt bones. 

• In 1835, on Westfield of Hattonmill, at the removal of a cairn 
about 15 yards in diameter, a grave was discovered, built of rude 
stones, and about five feet in length, lying north and south, and 
sunk two or three feet below tlie surface of the hillock on which 
the cairn stood. The bones which the grave contained, seemed 
large, and the skull had best resisted the work of decay. But the 
whole of them speedily crumbled down. Between the cairn and 
the original surface of the hillock, there was a flooring or coating 
of three or four inches of clay. . The grave was not in the middle 
of the cairn — At the Glesterlaw and other places, also, urns and 
bones have been discovered. 

• In the Battle Drum Wood, on the north-west of the parish, 
there are many cairns or circular heaps of moor stones. They lie 
chiefly in two lines, which are parallel to the Drum or ridge of 
the hill on the north, and to the Battle Burn on the south ; and 
they might be inclosed within two acres of ground. A little far- 
ther east, but not in this parish, there are also the Battle Cairn, 
and the Battle Well, additional memorials of an event which has 
now no other record than those names and appearances. Tradi-

tion calls it a battle between the Picts and the Romans, — perhaps 
because the comntion name of the moor is Monrommi, although . 
most probably that name is a corruption of Monthrewmont, and 
consequently of much later date than the cairns. The Battle 
Burn issaid to have flowed with blood as far as Fithy; and the 
herdsmen when they drank out of the well, used to throw into it a 
bit of their bread, lest the water should turn to blood,— a rem- 
nant, perhaps, of a very ancient superstition, which, peopling every

Parochial Registers.— The parochial registers commence about 
1657. But there are several chasms ; and indeed the records fre- 
quently contain nothing but the collections and disbursements for 
the poor. The average collection for one Sunday in the summer 
season, was, in 1657, lOd. Sterling; in 1701, 2s. 4id.; in 1710, 
Is. 4d.; in 1750, Is. lid. The collection on the communion 
Sunday, in 1657, was 14s. Sd. ; in 1701, L.3, 7s.2id.; in 1710, 
L.2, Os. 3d.; in 1750, L.2, 5s. lid. And in these two last sums 
are included the collections on the other three sacramental days. 
Down to 1701, there was no other week-day service connected 
with the communion than the preparation service on Saturday at 
two o'clock. The last Episcopal incumbent died in the following 
year; and under the present ecclesiastical establishment, no com- 
munion was administered till 1710, when the fast-day and thanks- 
giving day also make their appearance. Previously to 1702, there 
were on the communion Sabbath three several services, those of 
the morning, forenoon, and afternoon. The minister generally 
had two assistants. One of them preached the sermon m the 
morning, and the other the " thanhsgivinf sermon m the after- 
noon. The first of these services began very early, probably not 
later than seven or eight o'clock. In 1660, the people were ap- 
pointed to keep the communion, one-half at six o'clock m the 
morning, and the other half at eleven o'clock, and all to be pre- 
sent at the " Doctrine of Tlianksgivinf at four o'clock m the af- 
ternoon Of the collections on the communion Sunday, by far 
the greater part, probably more than two-thirds, were collected 
not at the doors, but at the tables ; and it was not till after 1729 
that the practice of collecting at the tables was discontmued. 

Of all the original parochial churches within the Presbytery ot 
Arbroath, two only, those on Kinnell and Kirkden, contmued to. 
be rectories or parsonages at the.time of the Reformation. Barrv

had been gifted to the Abbey of Balraeriuo ; Giithry was itself 
become a kind of conventual establishment; and the other churches 
were in the hands of the Abbey of Arbroath. The lands of the 
parish, at one time at least, seem to have been partly within the 
regality of Arbroath and partly within the barony of Kinnell. 
And both under the Papal and under the Episcopal polity, Kin- 
nell, as well as all the parishes of the Presbytery, save Guthry, 
Panbride, and a part of Carmylie, was in the diocese of St An- 
drews. 

The following list of the ministers of Kinnell ascends almost to 
the time of the Reformation : 

Arthur Fethy was presented to Kinnell by James VI. in 1587, 
and translated to Inverkeilor in 1598. 

John Guthrie, reader in Arbroath, was presented to Kinnell in 
1599, translated to Arbirlot in 1603, to Perth in 1610, to Edin- 
burgh in 1620; consecrated Bishop of Murray in 1623; depriv- 
ed, along with the other Scottish Bishops, in 1638; and expelled 
'from the Episcopal castle of Spynie in 1640. According to 
Keith, he was a venerable, worthy, and hospitable prelate ; and 
having encountered the storm, from which such of the bishops, as 
did not submit to Presbytery, fled for refuge into England, he re- 
tired to his own house of Guthrie in Forfarshire, and died, says 
Middleton, exercising his charity amongst the poor in the time of 
the civil wars. His brother and his son John were ministers of 
Arbroath and DufFus. 

William Kinnear, reader in Arbroath, was presented to Kinnell 
in 1603, and died in 1612. 

. Henry Futhie was admitted by the Archbishop of St Andrews 
with assistants in J 612, and translated to Fowlis and Lundie. 

James Guthrie was translated to Arbirlot in 1625. 

David Kinnear died in 1638. 

James Thomson, Senior, died after May 1681. 

James Thomson, Junior, having received ordination from the 
Archbishop, and institution from the Archdeacon, Dean, was 
admitted by the Presbytery to be conjunct minister with his father 
in 1675, and died in his father's lifetime in 1681. 

David Thomson was admitted conjunct minister with his father 
in 1681, and died in 1702, the last Episcopal incumbent. 
■ Alexander Dallas, the first Presbyterian minister of Kinnell 
under the present ecclesiastical establishment, was ordained by 
Ihe united Presbytery of Brechin and Arbroath in 1703, and

died in 1705. At the Revolution of 1688, the number of Presby- 
terian ministers in this part of Scotland was so small, that the old - 
Presbyteries of Brechin, Fordun, and Arbroath, were obliged for 
some time to associate in one Presbytery; and it was not till 1704 
that the Presbytery of Arbroath was again disjoined, and erected 
into a separate Presbytery by the Synod of Angus and Mearns.

William Moncrieff, 1725-1742. 

James Murison, minister of Edzel, was translated to Kinnell in 
1743; admitted Principal of St Mary's College, St Andrews, and 
demitted the ministry at Kinnell in 1747. 

George Cruikshanks, minister of Arbroath, was translated to 
Kinnell in 1748, and died in 1753. 

Alexander Chaplin was ordained in 1754, and died in 1813 in 
the ninety- fifth year of his age. His successor, the present in- 
cumbent, was ordained the 23d September 1813. 

III. — Population. 
Though the introduction of spinning-mills, and the more exten- 
sive cultivation of the moor lands, have tended to the increase 
of the population, it is probable that the inhabitants are not more 
numerous at present than they were in ancient times. Several 
farms have wholly disappeared, which once had each of them a 
resident population of tenants and cottagers. The very names of 
other farms are now generally forgotten ; and in some cases, where 
writings have preserved the names, the sites can no longer be dis- 
covered. Of such farms as still exist, several are here and there 
united under one tenant. The high state of cultivation to which, 
the land has been brought, renders fewer labourers necessary than 
before ; and the demand for manual labour is still farther dimi- 
nished by the machinery and improved implements which the mo- 
dern husbandry has called to her aid. 

During 6 years, from 1657 to 1662, both inclusive, the yearly 
average of deaths was 17. During 44 years, from 1657 to 1700, 
both inclusive, the yearly average of marriages, where either both 
parties or the bride belonged to the parish, was 6-'. During forty- 
two years, from 1657 to 1698, both inclusive, the yearly average of 
baptisms was 225't. For the seven years immediately preceding 1838, 
the yearly average of births was 23f ; of deaths, 10; and of mar- 
riages, where either both parties or the bride belonged to the pa- 
rish, 6. The deaths of 1837, though only equalling the births.

exceeded the amount of the deaths of the five preceding years, 
and were more than double the deaths of 1831.

Of this last census, 385 were males, and 444 were females, and 
the number of families was 165. 

The disproportion of males and females in the preceding cen- 
sus is not only reversed, but is greater than accords with any ratio 
of difference,— a circumstance which is to be accounted for by the 
employment of more females than males in the spinning-mills, and 
at the loom at home, while the young men, chiefly from the Muir- 
side, are more extensively known as excellent farm-servants in the 
neighbouring parishes. Of 125 looms, which are at work in the 
parish, 78 are occupied by female weavers, and 47 by males ; and 
of the whole number of looms in the parish, 90 are in the Muir- 
side of Kinnell among 80 families. Thirty years ago, there were 
only three or four female weavers in the parish ; and their num- 
ber did not greatly increase till 1821, when the withdrawal of a 
great part of the Muirside lands, along with other circumstances, 
taught them to seek a readier and more convenient employment 
at the loom than in the distant fields of the farmers. The de- 
scription of linen cloth which the weavers weave here at present 
IS chiefly Osnaburg and sheeting; and it must also be remarked, 
that eight or ten looms at present unoccupied in the Muirside be- 
long to men who find a more congenial work in the construction 
ot a railroad between Arbroath and Forfar. 

There is no residence in the parish for any of the proprietors 
of the four estates; but, as almost all the estate of East Braky is 
at present not under lease, the proprietors of that estate avail 
hemselves of the circumstance, by residing in the parish during 
the summer months. ° 

No families reside within the parish but such as are connected 
with Its agnculturing or manufacturing operations 

Two men, now elderly, are more or less fatuous. In one fa- 
tn.ly, there are two children deaf and dumb. If the kirk-ses- 
sion should send them to Edinburgh for education, they can ex-

pect to accomplish their object only through the benevolent aid of 

Sir James Carnegie. 

Of late years, bothies have been provided for unmarried female 
servants also ; for the farmers, finding it difficult to induce women 
to leave the loom for the working of the green crop, have been con- 
strained to bring workers from the northern counties. The en- 
aacrement of these workers is generally for a certam period, at 
about 8d. or yd. a day till harvest, when higher wages are neces- 

AboTrthirty years ago, smuggling in gin and brandy and other 
articles prevailed to a considerable extent at various points of the 
adjacent coast; and, till a later period, the whisky, which was 
Jnerally used, was chiefly from illicit distillation m the north 
But a subsequent alteration of the law, by improving the spirits ot 
the larger distilleries, and reducing the price, almost suppressed 
illegal distillation ; and, if an increase of drunkenness was the im- 
mediate result of the reduction of price, in that evil also there has 
been a great abatement. It must be added, however, that there 
is still a coast-guard for the prevention of foreign smugghng. 

IV. — Industry. ,• - i j 

The surface of the parish, exclusive of portions of an undivided 
commonty, and of a large forest in Monthrewmont -/bout 
4014 Scotch acres, whereof about 3492 are arable, about 49 are 
wood, and about 513 are waste, moor pasture, and roads. In the 
last item are included about 306 acres in Monthrewmont moor, 
belonging to the estates of West Braky, East Braky, and Rm- 
mu e That part of the moor, which, at the division abot fifty 
years ago, fell to the estate of Bolshan, has been either plan ed or 
brought ito cultivation. The three acres which were allotted to 
the glebe in place of the minister's right to feal and divot, were 
under crop for the first time in 1834. 

Rossv moor, the undivided commonty, extends to about 60U 
acres, and belongs to the parishes of Kinnell, Farnell, Marytown, 

nJhS the lands of the parish as are still waste and unculti- 
vated seem to have been intended by nature rather for the bear- 
ing of od than of corn. A few acres of moor m the south-we. 
corner of the parish are perhaps destined, by their locality, for 
cuUivation ; and, if the increasing population of the neighbouring

Village of Friocklieim tlo not suggest tiie idea of feuing, a iDode of 
improvement may be adopted similar to that in whicli the lands 
adjacent to the muirside of Kinnell have been brought into culti- 
vation since 1820. In the latter case, the moor was divided into 
sections of about four acres. Thirty bolls of lime were furnished 
by the proprietor for the improving of each acre of ground, with 
the farther inducement of stone, wood, and lime for the erection 
of houses, and a lease of nineteen years without any other rent 
than the payment of a few cane hens. It was expected that this 
mode of improving the moor, and increasing the population, would 
furnish a good supply of hands for working the green crops of the 
larger farmers. But the loom affords a more independent, though 
not a healthier, occupation ; and, if expectation has been disap- 
pointed in the case of tenants, it is not more likely to be gratified 
in the case of feuars, whose destination still more is naturally the 
loom, and such professions as are carried on within doors. The 
natural mode of supplying a sufficiency of labourers would be to 
increase the population of the several farms, by the building of 
additional cottages, and the employing of married servants to a 
greater extent. 

The improving of the moor, in sections of about four acres each, 
was effected not only by introducing new colonists, but by remov- 
ing the greater part of the old pendiclers nearer to the scene of 
improvement. And the whole of their old land having been laid 
out m regular fields, according to a better system of husbandry, 
the greater part of them was annexed to the farm of Bolshan. Con- 
sequently their houses have been almost all rebuilt since 1820, 
and are much more comfortable than those were which the pro' 
gress of agricultural improvement required to be removed. And 
as with a greater population, they have less of the profits of agri- 
culture, weavmg is carried on among them to a much greater ex- 
tent than before. Numerically, however, they have more acres 
than formerly. For, instead of the 180 acres withdrawn from them, 
270 acres of moor have been brought into cultivation by the united 
labours of the old and new colonists ; so that at present, the muir- 
side lands extend to 450 acres under the occupancy of 80 families 
In 820, the number of families was 53, and the old muirside 
lands were estimated at L.615 of annual value. 

The ordinary duration of leases is nineteen years ; and the ave- 
rage rent of a Scotch acre of arable land is about L.l, 5s. Un- 
der two leases, which commenced in 1768, and continue all the

lifetime of the present tenant, about 547 acres on the estate of 
West Braky, which are all arable save about 23, pay only L.108 
of money, with 40 bolls of meal and 12 quarters of barley to the 
proprietor  In 1767, the farm of Bolshan was let for fifty-seven 
vears for L.82 ; in 1794, it was sublet for L.503 ; and afterwards, 
in 1807, for the remainder of the original lease, for the same an- 
nual rent, with a grassum of L.IOOO. In 1805, the muirside 
lands were let to 29 tenants for fifteen years, at an average rent of 
L.l, 13s. the acre, and some of them as high as L.3. 

The rental of the whole parish, as far as can be ascertained, 
was as follows at the three following dates : in 1736, L.135 Ster- 
lintT, 227| quarters of barley, and 718 bolls of oatmeal ; in 1792, 
L.1334 Sterling, 98 quarters of barley, and 184 bolls of oatmeal; 
in 1837, L.3795 Sterling, 922 quarters of barley, and 169 bolls of 
oatmeal. In the rental of 1837, a suitable value is put on such 
land as is in the hands of the proprietors, and the surplus rents 
which arise from subletting are excluded. 

The largest quantity of land held in lease by one tenant is 817 
Scotch acres, all arable save about 23, and comprizes four farms. 
The largest single holding is the farm of Bolshan, which contains 
573 Scotch acres, all arable.f 

The road money, or commutation for the statute labour, is at 
present L.33, 3s., and is paid by forty-four tenants. Fourteen 
smaller tenants either pay no road money, or pay it through the 

landlord. , • i .   „ 

There is a good set of draught horses in the parish; but tew 
are reared in it. The breed of black-cattle also is good. Of late 
there have been two large herds of swine ; and there is also a 
flock of about 200 sheep, which occasionally range over the waste 
land of the parish. Of late also, sheep have been flaked, and fed 
off with the turnips upon light ground, but not to a great extent. 
In the woods on Monthrewmont moor, there are roe deer and phea- 

About a dozen of vears ago, bone-dust was introduced as a ma-

there is generally no need of any additional dunging for the sub- 
sequent crop of barley. 

There are thirteen thrashing-mills in the parish, — one moved by 
a steam-engine of eight horse power, previously by wind, and ori- 
ginally by horses ; seven moved by water ; two by horses ; and 
three by either horse or water. The oldest, that of Hatton-mill, 
dates from 1794. 

There is also a mill for the manufacturing of potato-flour. It 
is moved by a steam-engine of three horse power.

as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows :

There are four spinning-mills, all on the farm of Hattonden, 
besides a fifth, which has only one frame, and is on the farm of 
Newbigging. Hatton spinning-mill, which is the largest, and 
began to work in 1807, contains 15 frames, of 30 spindles each, 
for flax and tow, in about equal proportions with suitable prepar- 
ing machinery, and throws off" weekly about 1800 spindles of yarn, 
which, as to quality, is from 3 lbs. to 5 lbs. per spindle. The 
three smaller mills will together throw off" about 1200 spindles of 
flax yarn ; for they have no tow machinery. At none of the mills 
is there any such quantity of fine yarn spun as to deserve particu- 
lar notice. The deficiency of water in summer is supplied in the 
case of the largest mill, by a steam-engine of seven and a-half 
horse power. Two of the others also, those of Gighty burn and 
Hattonden, have smaller engines for the same reason. The mill 
at Gighty burn is the. oldest of all the mills, having begun to 
work in 1796, and came in place of a bleachfield. Hattonden 
spinnmg-mill began in 1819; and the Haugh spinning-mill in

Ecclesiastical State. — The church stands in the southern part of 
the parish, and a few families on the estate of Rinmure may be 
three and a half miles distant. It was repaired, or rather was al- 
most rebuilt in 1766. The additional masonry and the roof was 
furnished by the heritors, and the tenants and kirk-session fitted 
up the seats ; the former, far fewer sittings than could conveni- 
ently accommodate their families, and the latter, whatever other 
sittings were necessary to complete the work. Hence, about a 
third of the sittings, erected at an expense of about L.27, became 
the property of the session, and brought immediately L. 2, 17s., and 
latterly L.7, 10s. annually for the behoof of the poor. The church 
was covered with new slates in 1836, and is in a state of good repair. 
But it is damp and dark, and, as may be supposed from the date 
of the rebuilding, it is not in accordance with the comfortable ac- 
commodation which the proprietors have provided for the pa- 
rishioners at home. In consequence of the peculiar circumstances 
of the parishes of Kirkden and Inverkeilor, the demand for sittings 
was too great to allow of any of them being free. But, by the 
erection of the church of Friockheim, the sittings of the church 
of Kinnell are now all available to the accommodation of the pa- 
rishioners ; and the young, whom the extra parochial worshippers 
formerly excluded to a considerable extent, are now coming up in 
greater numbers to public worship. It necessarily happens, also, 
that, as there is now no competition from extra-parochial worship- 
pers, the rents of the kirk-session's seats, low as they were, can- 
not be kept up ; and the parishioners are disposed lo claim what 
they consider the privileges of an establishment, — free sittings in 
the parochial church. 

The manse and offices were rebuilt in 1814. 

The glebe, including the yards, the site of the buildings, the 
arable glebe, and the allowance for grass, is about seven acres ; 
and the ground which was allotted to the minister in compensation 
of his right to feal and divot in Monthrewmont moor, and which 
is now in cultivation, three acres : in all, about ten Scotch acres. 
The moorish part has hitherto borne good crops, in consequence 
of the fallowing, dunging, and liming that it had previously un-

dergone. But doubts have been expressed whether the vegetable 
powers of such land can be maintained in great activity for a great 
length of time. The old glebe may be valued at L.2 per acre, a 
sum which is above the average of the best farms in the parish. 
The rotation of cropping is,-l. oats ; 2. potatoes and turnips ; 
3. barley; 4. hay; 5. pasture. If wheat be substituted for barley 
after the potatoes, all the subsequent crops- are greatly deterio- 
rated. 

The stipend being the whole teind of the parish, and, conse- 
quently, including the allowance for communion elements, is 
L.165, 19s. lljd. Sterling of money, 17.1371 imperial quarters 
of barley, 5.7124 imperial quarters of bear, and 408 imperial stones 
of oatmeal. 

Of the heads of families, only one the father is a Dissenter, 
while the mother and the oldest daughter are communicants in 
the Established Church. Among the young people at the spin- 
ning-mills, there are occasionally a few Episcopalians, Seceders, 
and Independents from the neighbouring towns. 

Divine service is generally well attended. The average num- 
ber of communicants for eleven years immediately preceding 1836, 
was 427 ; whereof 305 were parochial, and 122 exira-parochial. 
The extra-parochial communicants were chiefly from the parishes 
of Kirkden and Inverkeilor. In 1833, there were 103 commu- 
nicants from the former, and, in 1820, there were 79 from the 
latter. In 1836, the extra-parochial communicants almost entirely 
withdrew from the communion of Kinnell to the communion of 
their own church in the new parochial district of Friockheim ; 
and, notwithstanding the withdrawal of so many strangers, the 
church of Kinnell, at the time of the communion, has been still 
full throughout, — a proof, that in former years, there was great 
discomfort to all, and danger to the aged and infirm, when a house, 
which has only 392 sittings, was sometimes crowded with 450 
communicants, independently of other worshippers. In the latter 
case, the young were necessarily excluded ; and all opportunity 
denied to parents of showing their children an ordinance which it 
is the duty of one generation to teach and transmit to another. 
And, moreover, it ought ever to be remembered, that, as commu- 
nicants are seldom under eighteen years of age, there are neces- 
sarily many younger persons, who, having the ordinance specially

in view, desire previously to viait on the instructions with which 
its celebration is accompanied. A few of the parishioners, for the 
sake of convenience, communicate in the churches of the neigh- 
bouring parishes. They are not included in the preceding ac- 
count, and their number cannot be stated. The average number 
of young communicants for the last thirteen years was fifteen. 

In 1835, it was ascertained, for the information of the House 
of Commons, that the parishioners, above twelve years of age, 
were 69 per cent, of the whole population ; and, in the same 
year, such male heads of families as were communicants, amounted 
to 127. 

The collections in the church for eight years immediately pre- 
ceding 1838, amounted to L.267, 19s. lid., whereof L.235, Is. 
2d. were for the poor, and L.32, 18s. 9d. for extraordinary pur- 
poses, such as the propagation of the Gospel, the infirmary of 
Montrose, and the relief of the destitute Highlanders. In 1834, 
when subscriptions were commenced, under the auspices of the 
presbytery of Arbroath, for establishing a church at Friockheim, 
the parish of Kinnell contributed above L.82, and, of that sum, 
L.50 were from Sir James Carnegie. 

Education. — The parochial is the only school. The salary is 
L.31, and the annual average amount of school fees is about L.15, 
and the master has the legal accommodations. 

There is a parochial library, under the care of the kirk-session. 
Poor. — The number of persons who received parochial aid in 
1837, was 15, and the disbursements consisted of monthly allow-

monthly allowance at present is 4s. the highest, 10s. But more 
than L.l has been given monthly, besides allowances for particular 
articles ; and the amount of allowance depends on the weakness, 
destitution, or fatuity of the pauper, and the degree of aid which 
may be afforded by kindred or neighbours.

In 1801, a pauper, who had lived in the utmost misery, dis- 
closed his treasures on his death-bed to an elder, and gave thera

Markets. — Four markets, for the sale of cattle, are held yearly at 
the Glesterlaw, on the estate of Bolshan, on the last Wednesday of 
April, the fourth Wednesday of June, the third Wednesday of 
August, and the Wednesday immediately after the 12th of Octo- 
ber. The market is said to have been held originally at Glester, 
m the parish of Carmylie, and to have been translated to its pre- 
sent place on an excambion of lands between the proprietors of 
Panmure and Southesk. The Eastern Forfarshire Agricultural 
Association hold their Lammas meeting at the Glesterlaw, for 
the show of horse, cattle, and other animals, and of improved or 
newly invented implements of husbandry. 

Inns, 5fc. — There is no ale-house in the parish save one,— the 
toll-house, on the turnpike road, of the same date with the toll, 
viz. 1831. 

Fuel~T\\Q fuel is coal from Arbroath, English, at about Is. 
3d. per barrel of twelve imperial stones, and Scotch at about 9s. 
6d. per boll of eighty imperial stones. Occasionally, there are 
sales of the thinnings, prunings, and back-going trees of the neigh- 
bourinof woods. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The difference between the present state of the parish, and 
that which existed in 1792, the date of the last Statistical Ac- 
count, IS very great. The parish is now almost wholly laid out in 
proper fields. Far more food is now produced for the support of 
animal hfe; and if in some cases there may have been weiahtier 
crops of oats, there are now more extensive fields of wheat. Be- 
sides what has been done in all parts of the parish, the improve- 
ments in Monthrewmont moor have added considerably to the 
arable acres to the increase of population, and the extension of 
weaving. And nothing in that district so grievously offends the

eye of those who frequent the Glesterlaw market, as the adjacent 
waste belonging to the estate of West Braky. The enlargement 
of farms still goes on. Bowhouse, which in old time was of con- 
siderable extent, was finally annexed, along with the better part 
of the muirside lands, to the farm of Bolshan, in 1824; and not 
a stone now stands upon another, either of the dwelling-house or 
steading. There are also, three cases of junction, comprehend- 
ing in all eight farms, whose dwelling-houses and steadings yet 
exist more or less perfect. The number of bothies is increased ; 
and thev are now provided for female workers also who come from 
the northern counties in search of more advantageous employment 
than can be found at home, in a country without manufactures. 
The eighteen larger tenants of 1792 have now decreased to nine 
or ten. But the fifty smaller ones have increased their number, 
so that one of the principal objections against large farms is not 
applicable here, — that, however faithful and industrious a servant 
may be, he is doomed to a state of perpetual vassalage, inasmuch 
as his savings can never enable him to lease a farm for himself, 
in a country where there are no farms of small extent. 

But spinning-mills are the most striking feature of difference 
between the present state of the parish and that of 1792. They 
have not only lowered the prices of spinning, and utterly abolish- 
ed it as a species of domestic employment and profit to females ; 
but they have furnished a work in which the young are of no small 
consequence in the manual labour of mankind. While women 
have necessarily betaken themselves in great numbers since 1820 
to the loom, children are become of considerable value to the pa- 
rent in a pecuniary point of view : and the means of giving them 
a good education are greatly increased, while the opportunity is 
diminished ; and the years that are best fitted for instilling reli- 
gious knowledge into the youthful mind, will pass away unimprov- 
ed, unless teaching be provided at the mill, in the room of that 
which they were wont to receive at the parochial school.

PRESBYTERY OF MEIGLE, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. PATRICK BARTY, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name and Boundaries. — In old records, we find the name of this 
parish spelled Ruthvance, and Ruthvens ; it is now always written 
Ruthven, and prononnced Riven. The parish is nearly a square 
of two miles, pleasantly situated on the north side of Strathmore; 
bounded on the west and north by the parish of Alyth ; and on 
the south and east, by the parish of Airlie. 

Topographical Appearances. — The general appearance of the 
parish is pleasant, having a gentle slope towards the south, varied 
by some inequalities. One of the eminences is called the Gal- 
low's hill, being the spot where the barons of Ruthven erected the 
gibbet, in feudal times. A small field adjoining is still known by 
the name of the hangman's acres. 

Soil and Climate. — The soil in general is a light loam, on a 
gravelly bottom. The climate is dry and temperate, and the si- 
tuation healthy. 

Plantations.— The inferior grounds are well clothed with thriv- 
ing plantations of larch and Scotch firs; and on the banks of the 
Islais a considerable extent of oak copse, which is both profitable 
and highly ornamental. It is worthy of remark, that while woods 
of this description, oak copse, are so abundant west of this, none 
are to be found farther east on the south front of the Grampians 
Hydrography.— The river Isla, after forming the boundary on 
the north, turns suddenly in the direction from north-west to south- 
east, leavmg the largest portion of the parish on the east side 
1 he bed of the Isla here is rocky, the banks bold, and covered 
with natural coppice and plantations. The scenery in many 
places is very beautiful. This parish is well watered, there beina 
besides the Isla, a considerable stream, many excellent springs of 
water, sonrie of which are strongly impregnated with the oxide of 
"on. feuch names of places as Brigton, Bridgend, Milton, Craio-y-

lin, Fountaiiiblow, Barberswells, and even Drylocb, Indicate no 
want of water. There is a bridge of two arches over the Isla, on , 
the road from Blairgowrie to Kirriemuir. The date of its erec- 
tion is not known ; but from its narrowness, its being onginally 
without parapets, as well as its large central p.er, it is supposed 
to be very ancient. After passing the bridge the nver runs over 
several ledges of broken rock, and then falls into a deep and 
broad pool, which, becoming more shallow towards the south, di- 
vides into two streams, forming a small island o about six acres. 

The Isla is well stocked with small trout and par, but salmon 
seldom make their appearance till the month of September, when 
they come up to spawn. In this state, the fish frequent the shal- 
lows for the purpose of depositing their roe, and, from being in a 
languid and unhealthy state, are easily killed by night with spears 
and" torch light. Fortunately, the recent enactments with regard 
to salmon-fishing are so well enforced, that the barbarous sport of 
killing fish in this state is completely put a stop to. I may here 
mention, that the oldest people in the neighbourhood are of opi- 
• nion, that the Isla shrinks much more now during the summer 
xnon hs, than it did many years ago. Perhaps the drainage and 
Tperio; cultivation of the glens and higher districts of country 
through which the river runs, may account for this

be found on the banks of the Isla, a little above the manse, pro- 
bably the most southern spot in the course of the river, where this 
humble mountain beauty makes its appearance. 

Geology. — The geological structure is very simple, being well 
shown by the section of the Isla. It is altogether situated within 
the old red sandstone beds, the newest in Strathmore, and which 
extend for some distance both to the south and north of the pa- 
rish. Their strike is from the north-east to the south-west, and 
they dip gently to the north-west, becoming altogether flat at the 
northern side of the parish, beyond which they assume the reverse 
dip, — the synclinal line of Strathmore running along here. These 
beds are of a brownish red colour, and occasionally mottled with 
white spots, particularly towards the synclinal line. Some few 
quartz pebbles are occasionally to be found in them, but otherwise 
they present little variety in iheir mineralogical structure, further 
than that some beds are coarse and others fine in the grain. Some 
slight traces of organic remains have been observed in them, of a 
similar nature to those of Clashbennie in the Carse of Gowrie. 
No other rocks have been observed in this parish ; trap dikes, so 
common in the district, have not been detected. The immediate 
cover of the rocks is a mixture of stones and clay, provincially 
called mortar, and which, protruding to the surface, forms the 
highest portion of the parish. A little lower down, there is a large 
accumulation of gravel and sand above the mortar, forming suc- 
cessive level benches down to the margin of the river. These 
gravels, as well as the mortar, consist almost wholly of the debris 
of the Grampians, intermixed a little with that of the subjacent 
beds. The sandstone beds afford good building materials, and 
the gravels are extensively used for the roads. 

II- — Civil History. 

The parish of Ruthven was long in possession of a branch of 
the ancient and illustrious family of Crichton ; but that family 
having become extinct, in 1742, the remaining part of their es- 
tates was purchased, in the year 1744, by Thomas Ogilvy of 
eoul, and is now in possession of Peter Wedderburn Ogilvy, 
Esq. a cadet of the family of Wedderburn of Blackness ; who 
married, in 181 1, the grand-daughter of the said Thomas Ogilvy, 
and only child of the late James Ogilvy of Ruthven. 

The Castle of Ruthven, being ruinous, was pulled down many 

M; of thispans., indebted to tny fViend.

years ago. Ruthven House is pleasantly situated near where the 
castle stood, and is the usual residence of the family,— a family , 
equally distinguished for their kindness to the poor, and their at- 
tachment to their tenantry. 

Parochial Registers.— The session records have been very ill 
kept, and go no farther back than the year 1744. Those which 
remain, give very full details of some parochial transactions. Cases 
of scandal especially are given with uncalled-for minuteness, and 
this is, perhaps, the reason why in this and many other parishes 
the session records have gone amissing. No one chooses to have 
the iniquities of his fathers handed down from generation to gene- 
ration, nor is it for the edification of their posterity that they should 
be so circumstantially recorded. Much more interesting are any 
notices throwing light on the history of the times, as for example 
the following intimation : " Ruthven, 1745, August 20, this day, 
the minister intimated from the pulpit, that, by reason of the pre- 
sent public troubles and confusions, and the distractions and divi- 
sions among people, he was obliged to defer the celebration of the 
sacrament of the Supper for this year." We find also, that, on 
the 20th of July 174G, " Thomas Crichton, at the Mill of Ruth- 
ven, was rebuked before the congregation for his great sin and 
scandal, as having been engaged in the late wicked and unnatural 
rebellion." 

III. — Population. 
In consequence of the introduction of manufactures, the popu- 
lation of this parish is increasing. In 1755, according to Dr 
Webster's report, the population was 280. In 1792, owing to the 
enlarcrement of the farms, it had decreased to 220. In the pre- 
sent year, it is 425. The following table shows the state of the 
population and the various denominations to which they belong:

According to the Government census for 1841, the population 
of this parish is 471, but this included about 40 individuals who 
weie employed in cutting an oak coppice, and did not belong to 

the parish. . . , 

The proportion of females being so great is owing to the mills 
in the parish, where females are more employed than males. 1 he

Roman Catholics are chiefly Irish, and are solely employed at the 
mills. Some of them attend the Established Church ; and they 
are always happy to see the clergyman of the parish in their houses, 
whether he is led there in the time of family distress, or in the 
course of his parochial visitations. 

There are two brothers deaf and dumb. The oldest person in 
the parish was born in the year 1746.

The soil being in general a light loam, on a gravelly bottom, 
is well adapted for sheep and turnip husbandry, and its value 
has been much increased of late years by the introduction of bone 
manure. Much of this manure is now used, and is found to suc- 
ceed admirably well. Excellent crops of turnip are thus raised, 
more or less of which, in proportion to the weight of the crop, are 

e remainder are eaten off the ground 
■ with sheep. About 20 bushels of bone-dust are allowed for an 
acre ; and no small advantage resulting from the introduction of 

this manure is its superseding to a great extent the use of marl; 

by the too frequent and injudicious application of which,, much of 
the ground in this neighbourhood has been materially injured. 
After the turnip crop, barley is generally sown, for which grain 
the soil is well adapted. There is very little wheat sown in the 
parish. The usual rotation of crops is, two years grass, oats, green 
crop, including potatoes and turnips ; barley, sown out with grass. 

The general duration of leases is for nineteen years. The 
■farm-steadings are mostly new, and in good condition. Great en- 
couragement to enclosing and draining has been afforded by the 
landlord. 

From an old document, it appears that the rental of the parish 
in 1742 was L,230. When the last Statistical report was publish- 
ed, It was L,630. It is now about L.1600. This is exclusive of wood, 
the annual value of which, taking an average of the last thirty 
years is about L.200. The la.t four cuttings of the oak copse

is described as an advantageous situation for machinery : " Its 
centrical situation to the manufacturing villages of Cupar Angus, , 
Alyth, and Kirriemuir; its ttioderate distance from the flourish- 
ing town of Dundee,-an excellent freestone quarry,-the plea- 
santness and fertility of the country, and the reasonable price of 
provisions, added to the waterfalls on the Isla, seein to concur in 
pointing out this little parish as a desirable spot for machmery 
and manufactures. Something of the kind is much wanted to 
quicken the industry of the tenants, and give a ready marke 
to many articles of farm produce at present of httle value It 
is to be hoped that these natural advantages will not always 
be overlooked, and that an observing and industrious age will 
at length avail itself of circumstances so strikingly favourab e. 
These iadicious predictions have been in some measure fu fi - 
led. A manufacturing age soon began to appreciate such falls 
of water as those on the Isla, the value of which ,s now greatly 
enhanced by the completion of the Dundee and Nevvtyle Railway, 
which in a manner diminishes by two-thirds their distance frorn 
Dundee, the principal seat of the linen manufactures. Although 
the falls of the Isla have not been turned to so good account as 
those on the Ericht at Blairgowrie, seven miles west of this, yet 
they have not been altogether overlooked. Upon the space of a 
quarter of a mile of the Isla, we have two mdls for thrashmg corn, 
a meal-mill, a flour-mill, a saw-mill, and also two mills for spmning 
flax. One of these spinning-mills was erected about twenty-six, 
the other eight years ago. The number of work people, young 
'rlrmtroduced intthe parish by these spinning-miUs is abou 
180, who, upon a fair computation, earn as wages L.200 per 
nionth, not including managers' salaries, grater pan of 
which is spent in the parish, m the purchase of beef, meal, mi k, 
butter, and potatoes, thus affording " a ready market for these ar- 
t; s f farm' produce, and quickening the industry of the tenants. 

Much has been said and written of late about the demorahzmg 
effects of factories, and it has been too much the fashion to de- 
She the mill-spinning population as the victims of oppression f 
disease and of ice. Such may be the case at large work, in 
1 " towns; but in a retired country parish like this, .t must be 
large town , proprietors and overseers of 

r  mjntlt — y to  

hit Their work people are not as exemplary m iheir conduct as 
: otr inhabitants of the parish. The welfare of those em- 



RUTHVEN. 



4|9 



ployed at the mills here, I deem it but fair to state, is well consi- 
dered by their employers. All worthless characters, as soon as 
discovered, are turned off, while the steady and well-behaved 
meet with every encouragement to continue. After the best op- 
portunities of becoming acquainted with them, afforded by paro- 
chial visitations and the like, I am not prepared generally to ad- 
mit that they are inferior to the average of those in the same grade 
of society in the parish, whether viewed in reference to health, 
morals, or religion. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State. — Of the ancient ecclesiastical history of this 
small parish, nothing certain is known. It would seem to have 
been originally an offset from the large parish of Alyth. Tradi- 
tion says, that the church was first erected by the Earl of Craw- 
ford, proprietor of the barony of Inverquiech, in the parish of 
Alyth, as a chapel for the accommodation of his tenants, some of 
whom had been killed in a quarrel with the Rollos of Balloch, in 
going to their parish church. Afterwards, the proprietor of Ruthven 
had influence enough to get his property erected into a separate pa- 
rish, of which the chapel of the Earl of Crawford became the parish 
church, and 22 acres of land adjoining were set apart as a glebe. 
Several circumstances combine to render this account not impro- 
bable. Indeed, this is the only reason we can see for the anomalous 
position of the church and manse, these being situated near Inver- 
quiech, and, according to some accounts, not in the parish of Ruth- 
ven and county of Forfar, but in the parish of Alyth and county 
of Perth. Nor in any other way, can we account for a right claim- 
ed by the ministers of Ruthven to dig turf and to pasture their 
cattle on the barony of Inverquiech, in the parish of Alyth. 

If the parish of Ruthven is small, the stipend, till augmented by 
Government, was also small,— being only 26 bolls of barley and 
26 bolls of meal. About L.114 is now paid by the Exchequer 
Before this augmentation from Government, the" glebe of 22 acres 
must have been an important item in the minister's income ; and it 
was a wise motto, which an ingenious predecessor adopted, and 
which IS still preserved on a pane of glass in the parlour win- 
dow of the manse, « Aut cole, aut parce, aut abi." The re- 
verend gentleman tried all of these,— he farmed well, lived fru- 
gally, but nevertheless took his departure, and died minister of 
Guthrie. A schoolmaster from Ruthven seems to have followed 
him to Guthrie, for, in the churchyard here, a stone, erected to 



420 FORFAUSHIUE. 

the memory of some of his family, after a somewhat brief epitaph, 
concludes by inforpiing the reader, that " Uie other half of this 
stone stands in the churchyard of Guthrie." 

Education.— The salary of the parochial teacher is L.30 ; his 
school fees amount to about L. 1 5 per annum. He is also session- 
clerk and precentor, for which he receives a salary of L.4. There 
is occasionally a private school, in the summer evenings, for the 
benefit of the young people at the mills ; and, during eight months 
of the year, a Sabbath school is held in the church, under the 
superintendence of the minister. At present, there are about 50 
young people attending this school, including the children of pa- 
rents of every denomination. In connection with the Sunday 
school, there is a collection of small religious publications, which 
are kept in constant circulation, and are eagerly read by the young 

people in the parish. 

Poor —There are few regular paupers, but a good many who 
receive occasional supply. There is a sum of L.80 in the heritor's 
hands, for which he pays the highest . interest. The average 
amount of collections for the last twelve years for behool ot the 
poor is L.'2Q per annum. This flourishing state of the poors 
funds is chiefly to be attributed to the circumstance of there being 
only one heritor, and that heritor residing almost constantly in the 

't-/ioMse.— The only ale-house in the parish was put down by 
the heritors some years ago ; and it is probably as much ovving to 
this circumstance, as to the institution of a Total Abstinence Socie- 
tv, that cases of drunkenness seldom occur in the parish. 
' Iuel—A good deal of wood is used in the parish; but coals, 
brought from the railway dep6t at Newtyle, five miles distant, are 

the common fuel. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

The labouring classes may be said to be in a prosperous state, 
and enioy comforts unknown to their fathers. But if they are 
better fed, better clothed, and have more comfortable houses than 
their fathers had, they are unfortunately less provident. FoUoNving 
the fashion of the present time, they are too apt to live up to their 
incomes. They are, however, very charitable, and, when cases 
of poverty and distress occur, are always ready to give accord- 
ing to their ability. In general, they are mtelhgent and indus- 
trious, exemplary in their moral conduct, and regular in their at 
tendance on the ordinances of religion.

PRESBYTERy OF MEIGLE, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. JAMES WATT, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — This parish occupies the vale or ien through which 
flows the river Isla, until it leaves its native mountains, — a cir- 
cumstance from which it has obviously taken its name. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish is of an irregular form, 
of which the extreme length, in a straight line, is 18 miles, and 
the extreme breadth 6, and contains about 62.15 square miles, or 
39,776 square acres. It is bounded on the north, by the parishes 
of Crathie, and Clova united to Cortachy ; on the east, by Kir- 
riemuir, Lintrathen, and Airlie ; on the south, by Alyth; and on 
the west, by Alyth and Kirkmichael. 

Topographical Appearances. — Glenisla is terminated on the 
north by that part of the mountain-barrier which separates Aber- 
deenshire from Forfarshire, at the extreme north-west corner of 
the latter county. From thence proceed southwards two loftv 
ranges, which form for a short way, with intervening mountains, 
the small pastoral vales of Glenbrichty, Caanlochan, and Dalchal- 
lie. These mountain ranges afterwards proceed in a nearly 
southern direction, and bound the parish on the east and west, 
until within a very short distance of its southern extremity. The 
hill of Kilry divides it into two districts of nearly equal size. 
It stretches across it from its western boundary in an eastern di- 
rection, leaving only a narrow defile, by which the Isla debouches 
on the east. From the north side of this hill, the mountain-chain, 
already mentioned as determining the eastern boundary, is be- 
held resolving itself for a few miles into three massy ranges, 
parallel to each other, and forming the two narrow pastoral 
districts drained by the burns of Pitlochrie and Glenmarkie. 
From the opposite side of the Kilry Hill is seen a chain of hills 
stretching westwards, bounding the vale of Kilry on the south, 
and forming the southern extremity of the parish. A narrovv

Stripe of the parish extends from the eastern termination of this 
chain of hills down to Airlie Castle. This stripe of land is bounded 
on the north by the Isla, and on the south by a small rivulet which 
separates the shires of Forfar and Perth. The lowest of the 
mountain-ranges of Glenisla is about 1400 feet above sea-level. 
From the foot to the centre of the parish, they are bleak and tm- 
interesting in their character. Northward from thence, they gra- 
dually assume the attributes of real alpine scenery, and termmate 
in the Glassmile,— a mountain which is upwards of 3000 feet 
above the level of the sea. 

Mount Blair, from its isolated position, is the most conspicuous 
hill in the parish. It belongs to the western bounding range, 
which is indented on the north and south sides of this mountam 
by narrow passes leading into Glenshee and the district of Black- 
water. Mount Blair is of large circumference, and elevated above 
the level of the sea about 2260 feet. On the east and west it is of 
moderate acclivity, and is often ascended by strangers for its com- 
manding view. On the other sides, it is steep and broken. It 
has twosummits ;-the lower one flat and of a longitudmal form; 
the other one precipitous, and crowning its southern verge. On 
gainin. the top of this precipitous summit, the toils of his ascent 
are, in clear and serene weather, immediately forgotten by the 
tourist, from the extensive and varied views which present them- 
selves His eye ranges with delight over the rich and beautiful 
districts intervening between him and the German Ocean, the 
Lammermoor, Pentland, and Ochil Hills, which bound the pros- 
pect on the east and south,-while he beholds, in the opposite di- 
rections, Shichallion, Ben-Mac-Dui, Ben-A'an, and Lochnagar, 
raisino- their mighty forms amidst an ocean of mountains. 

ffydrographj.-Theve are several perennial springs in the pa- 
rish of great magnitude and purity. Of these the Lady Well, 
close by the manse, and the Well of Coryvannoch, near the base ot 
Mount Blair, are the most noted. The temperature of the former 
is 48°, that of the latter 46°. The Coryvannoch Well, although not 
a chalybeate, was, in former times, much resorted to by the people 
of the district on the first Sabbath morning of May. It was then 
considered to be particularly efficacious to sickly cbld-n n o 
especially about day-break. The parents of such faded not, in

consequence, to have them conveyed thither at a very early hour. 
Trinkets of various sorts were thrown into the well by those who 
had used its waters, either as thank-offerings or with the view of 
preserving its sanatory virtues. These qualities, however, it seems 
to be regarded as having now-a-days lost, as it is seldom drunk of 
but by the passing shepherd, or those whom curiosity, arising from 
its former reputation, induces to pay it a visit. 

Some of the springs are a slight chalybeate ; but in general thev 
are without any traces of mineral impregnation. 

The Isla is the principal river in the parish. It takes its rise 
in the wilds of Caanlochan, and runs, in general, in a south-east- 
erly direction, until it join the Melgum at the bottom of the pa- 
rish, and immediately behind Airlie Castle. The average breadth, 
depth, velocity, and body of water of the Isla,. in so far as it is 
connected with the parish, are as follows : breadth in feet, 47 ; 
depth in feet, 1.2; velocity in feet per minute, 116.28; flow in 
cubic feet per minute, 8248.5 ; flow in gallons per minute, 5 141.22. 
To the admirers of wild and romantic scenery the Isla, as it ap- 
proaches the lower extremity of the parish, has many objects of 
peculiar attraction. From the Bridge of Milna- Craig downwards, 
the bed and banks of the river assume an entirely new character, 
and every spot is interesting, either from the beauty of its foliage,' 
or the hugeness of its crags, or the fearful struggling of its wa- 
ters. The cataract of the Reekie-Linn, a short way below the 
bridge just mentioned, is undoubtedly one of the most splendid 
and remarkable features of our Scottish rivers. Here the Isla, 
having an average flow of about 11,000 cubic feet, is suddenly 
opposed by projecting barriers of rock, unless at a narrow goro-e 
whence it dashes from a height of 60, and almost immediately tf' 
ter from another height of 20 feet. In both cases, it throws the 
whole weight of its waters upon serrated masses of rock in the gulf 
below, thus creating reverberation that seems to shake the solid bar- 
riers, 120 feet in height, which surround it, and sending up a spray 
that shrouds them in perpetual mist, and rises to the height of 
the beautiful sylvan scenery which crowns their summits. 

The rocks, the falls, and « the deep placid pool below" are 
seen to great advantage from a rustic bower, erected by John Hill 
isq. the proprietor, on the south bank of the river. 

Nearly two miles further down the Isla are the SI nag of Auch 
rannie. The upper one is the most deserving of notice. Here 
the river is suddenly contracted by stupendous cliflFs into a space

scarcely exceeding three yards in breadth. Through tliis frightful 
chasm the deep boiUng flood forces itself with tremendous power, 
and, in curling wreaths of foara, thunders down a steep broken 
channel, of considerable length, into a gloomy but spacious ravine, 
walled by rocks quite perpendicular and of great altitude. These 
are surmounted by a profusion of trees, exceedingly rich and va- 
ried in their foliage, which the hand of man never planted, and many 
of which he will never dare to approach. Altogether, the scenery of 
this remarkable spot, whether viewed from the head of the Slug, 
or the summits of the lofty banks of the river, is extremely grand 
and imposing. 

Oeologij.—The parish extends over a surface which takes ui a 
part of the primitive, the whole of the transition rocks, and a por- 
tion of the secondary or old red sandstone series. From its ex- 
treme northern boundary south to below Mount Blair, the rocks 
are gneiss and mica-slate, the latter being the most prevalent. 
The strata dip very rapidly, chiefly towards the north-west. These 
rocks are accompanied by large masses of quartz, and are thickly 
studded with crystals of the common garnet, of considerable beau- 
ty, but of no economic value. At the base of Mount Blair and in 
its' neighbourhood, some beds of limestone also prevail, but in ra- 
ther inconsiderable masses. It is of a bluish-gray colour, and is 
wrought for burning. The kilns used for that purpose are gene- 
rally small, ill-constructed, and inefficient. The lime is broken 
in small pieces like road-metal, and burned with peats. This pro- 
cess of calcination, although feeble and expensive, is now generally 
adopted by the farmers of the district, and the manure thereby 
obtained produces very powerful eff-ects. The limestone itself 
contains a considerable proportion of siliceous matter, with, how- 
ever very few other impurities. South of Mount Blair, the grey- 
wacke series begins. Nearly opposite the manse, it first makes 
its appearance in masses near the river. It is here a conglome- 
rate having a dirty ochrey hue, unless where frost-broken. Ue- 
scendincr the glen, about half-way to Lintrathen, the character o 
this rock becomes totally changed. It here assumes the aspect o 
fine-rained sandstone, and furnishes very perfect eples of 
srevwacke slate. Fine crystals of brown spar are found imbedded 
in the rock. At Kilry is found a thin bed of transition clay-slate. 
It i. the same which cuts across Scotland from sea to sea, and fur- 
nishes the slates of the Stoimont, Newtyle &amp;c. The whole mass 
of «trata is here about 40 feet thick, and dips to the north-west at 

4

an angle of about 70°. The plates, however, could not be obtain- 
ed in great breadth, nor cut up s6 thin as to make them be much 
sought after for the purpose of roofing. A short way down from 
this is the burn of Kilry, where porphyry appears, and where jas- 
per is found of such excellent qualities as to be much prized by 
the lapidary. Pursuing the line of the Isla, we find the stratifica- 
tion very complicated and irregular. Near the bridge of Milna- 
Craig, conglomerate of the old red sandstone appears. At the 
bridge itself, it dips at an angle of about 7 ' north. At the fall, 200 
yards below the bridge, the dip suddenly changes from this to one 
of about 73° south. This sudden change in the stratification seems 
to have occasioned the splendid cataract of the Reekie Linn al- 
ready noticed. Half a mile lower down, an enormous mass of fel- 
spar porphyry makes its appearance. The scenery here, in a pic- 
turesque point of view, is very magnificent. A massy vein of black 
basalt crosses the river still lower down ; and at the Slug of Auch- 
rannie, conglomerate prevails. Soon after this, old red sandstone 
is visible, dipping at first towards the north at an angle of 70°, but 
suddenly changing as it approaches the line of the Barry-hill of 
Alyth, at the extreme south-east corner of the parish, it dips south 
at an angle of 60°. The sandstone makes an excellent building 
stone. The alluvial matter in the parish consists chiefly of ir- 
regular deposits of till and of water-worn gravel. The latter, 
along with moss, enters largely into the composition of the soils 
in the upper district. These are in consequence generally 
loose and friable, but when well wrought and manured, yield, 
pretty abundantly, most of the different species" of cultivated 
plants. In the lower district, the rocks are covered by a thick 
deposit of clayey till. The soil is hence tenacious and unfertile 
until well-drained, when it produces, especially when manured 
with hme, heavy crops of grass and all kinds of grain. 

Zoologij.~Oi the rarer species of animals we have the following-

nix, the hooded crow, chiefly on the higher mountains. Scolopax 
arquata, curlew, and Charadrius pluvialis, golden plover, breed on 
the hills. Tetrao tetrix, the blackcock. Birds of this species 
had become pretty numerous until the winter of last year, when 
many of them were destroyed by the severity of the storm. Tetrao 
Lagopus, the ptarmigan, in the highest mountains of the parish ; T. 
attagen or Scoticus, red grouse or moorfowl. This species is found 
in all seasons of the year as far south as the hill of Kilry, although 
in largest numbers towards the head of the parish. Falco peregrinus, 
peregrine falcon. Birds of this species frequent the rocks of Auch- 
rannie, also the cliffs at the entrance of Caanlochan. Laceria 
agilis, the nimble lizard ; L. vulgaris, common lizard. 

The salmon is not found in the Isla above the slug of Auch- 
rannie. Common trouts are abundant in all the streams of the 
parish, but are rather inconsiderable in size. 

Botamj.—The Glenisla district abounds in alpine plants, more 
particularly Caanlochan, the small valley already mentioned as si- 
tuated at the head of the parish, and where the mountains attain 
an elevation of upwards of 3000 feet. To this part of the glen 
the attention of botanists has been more especially directed, and 
here it is that they have met with the rarest species in Britain, 
and even with plants which are peculiar to this station alone. 1 he 
vegetation on all the elevated hills of the glen is simdarto thatot 
other mountainous districts in Scotland. The following list, with 
which I have been kindly favoured by Professor Balfour of Uas- 
aow, will prove interesting to the botanist. It enumerates plants 
which are of rare occurrence on our Scottish Alps, but which grow 
in considerable abundance in Caanlochan, viz. Thalictrum alpi- 
num; Thlaspi alpestre, a plant found nowhere in Scotland except 
in Caanlochan. Lychnis alpina, a species for which the only 
Briti'h station is on little Gilrannoch, near the head of Glenisla, 
Ppteniillaulpestris, Dryas octopetala, Cherleria sedoides, Cerastium 
alpinum, Saxifraga nivalis, Erigeron alpinus, Saussurea alpina; 
Sonchus alpinus, one of the rarest British plants found in three or 
four stations in Caanlochan. Azalea procumbens, Pyrola rotundi- 
folia, Gentiana nivalis, a plant, the only British stations for wli.ch 
are Caanlochan and Ben Lawers. Veronica alpina and saxatdts, 
Salix reticulata, lanata, arbutifoUa, Juncus trijidus and castaneus, 
Carex atrata, phcostachya, rarijlora.nd aquatihs, Alopecurus al- 
pinus, Phleum alpinum, and Aira alpma.

On the lower grounds in the jarish there are no plants pecu' 
liarly worthy of notice, except Rumex aquaticus, which occurs in 
some places pretty abundantly. 

II. — Civil History. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners are, taking them in order, 
according to the value of their lands, the Earl of Airlie ; James 
Rattray, Esq. of Kirkhillocks ; John Smyth, Esq. of Balharry ; 
and Sir James Ramsay, Bart, of Bamff. 

Parochial Registers. — The oldest volume of the parish registers 
commences in the beginning of the year 1704, and ends in 17'23. 
The next volume commences 1741, and ends 1806. The last 
commences in November 1806, and contains the records from 
that period until the present year. These registers are -pretty 
well kept, but none of them appear to be complete. 

Antiquities. — The Castle of Fortar, as an object of antiquity, 
and as identified in history with the troubles of Scotland," is de- 
serving of notice. It is situated at the head of the principal part 
of the glen, which it has evidently been constructed with the view 
of commanding, along with the adjoining passes leading to Glen- 
shee and Braemar. A part of the walls is yet almost entire, from 
which, with others in a ruinous condition, it appears to have been 
a place of considerable size and strength. This castle was a 
mountain-keep of the Ogilvies of Airlie, and was frequently oc- 
cupied by them until the year 1640, when it was plundered and 
destroyed by the Earl, afterwards Marquis of Argyle. In the in- 
dictment of the Marquis in 1661, special allusion is made to that 
eveint. And the following quaint narrative of it is given by Spald- 
ing in his " History of the Troubles, &amp;c. of Scotland."f " Now the 
Committee of Estates finding no contentment in this expedition " 
—an expedition directed by the Earls of Montrose and Kinghoni 
against the house of Airlie,— "and hearing how their friends of 
the name of Forbes and others in the country were daily injured 
and opprest by Highland lymmars broken out of Lochaber, clan 
Gregor out of Brae of Atholl, Brae of Mar, and divers other 
places, therefore they give order to the Earl of Argyle to raise 
men out of his own country, and first to go to Airly and Furtour, 
two of the Earl of Airly's principal houses, and to take in and de- 
stroy the same, and next to go upon the lymmars and punish them. 
Likeas conform to his order, he raises an army of about 5000 men

and marches towards Airly ; but the Lord Ogilvie, hearing of his 
coming with such irresistible force, resolves to flee and leave the 
house manless : and so for their safety they wisely fled ; but Ar- 
gyle most cruelly and inhumanly enters the house of Airly, and 
beats the same to the ground, and right sua he does to Furtour; 
syne spoiled all within both houses, and such as could not be car- 
ried they masterfully brake down and destroyed. Thereafter they 
fell to his ground, plundered, robbed, and took away from him- 
self his men, tenants, and servants, their haill goods and gear, 
corns, and cattle whatsomever that they could get, and left nothing 
but bare bounds of sic as they could carry away with them, and 
what could not be destroyed they despitefuUy burnt up by fire." 

In the course of last year a silver coin or medal, of Anselm Ca- 
simir, Elector Archbishop of Men tz, was turned up by the plough 
in one of the fields of Bellaty, in this parish. It is of the size 
and nearly the weight of a crown piece, and is in an excellent 
state of preservation. On the one side is a half-length figure of 
a venerable-looking old man, with the inscription anselmvs : ca- 
siMiRVS : D : G : archiepi +. On the reverse is an escutcheon, 
complete in all its details, and surmounted by a mitre and cross, 
with the legend : s : rom : imp : per : ger : arch : ca : p : e : 
MOG. The date of this curious relic may be pretty accurately con- 
iectured, when it is stated that Anselm Casimir was Arch-Chan- 
cellor of the German empire, and Archbishop of Mentz, Mogun- 
tium, in the year 163 J, when that city was surrendered to Gus- 
tavus Adolphus, Schiller's Thirty Years' War, Moir's Trans 
Vol ii pp. 32-36. A silver coin, apparently ot the reign ot 
James I. of Scotland, and one of Queen Elizabeth, bearing the 
date of 1594, have also been found on the same farm. It may be 
remarked, as tending in some measure to account for these disco- 
veries, that Bellaty is in the immediate neighbourhood ot the re- 
mains of Newton Castle. That castle is said to have belonged to 
the family of Airlie; but the vestiges of it are now so slight, that 
they can hardly be traced. 

III.— Population. 
The population of the parish has decreased very considerably 
since the return to Dr Webster in 1755, which was 1852. This 
decrease may,, in a great measure, be attributed to the converting 
of several contiguous pendicles of land into one possession, a prac- 
tice which has been occasionally adopted since the middle of lat 
century ; and more especially to the abohtion of townships, by the

assignation of the allotments of each to one or two separate te- 
nants. The numbers at each census are as follows : —

1811, . 1209 
I82I, .1144 

1831, . 1129, viz. 566 males, and 563 females. 
1841, . 1134. 

The yearly average of births is . . 27

The number of persons at present under 15 yearS of age is 377 

betwixt 15 and 30, 284 

30 and 50, 258 

50 and 70, 139 

upwards of 70, 36 

From this last statement it appears, that, since 1831, there has 
been a decrease of population of 35, — a circumstance owing chiefly 
to the removal of several families to the neighbouring parish of 
Alyth. 

There are twenty-one proprietors of land of the yearly value 
of L.50 and upwards ; twelve of these reside in the parish, and 
nine are non-resident. 

Of unmarried men, bachelors, and widowers, upwards of 50 years of age, the 
number is . . . . . 7 29 

The number of unmarried women upwards of 45, is . . .34 

There is one fatuous person, a male; and four deaf and dumb, 
one male and three females. 

A few of the families, originally from Kirkmichael parish, usu- 
ally converse together in the Gaelic tongue ; but the language 
generally spoken is the dialect peculiar to Angus-shire, with\ 
slight approach, in the upper district, to the Gaelic accent. 

Character of the People.— In their general character, the 
people are sober, obliging, and industrious; much attached to 
their native glen, and to one another; attentive and hospitable 
to strangers, and charitable to' the wandering poor. They 
are regular in observing the public ordinances of religion, and 
the attendance of late, both at the week and Sabbath day- 
schools, evmces that they are manifesting an increasing anxiety 
tor the moral and religious improvement of the young. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture,— The number of cultivated imperial acres in the 
parish IS about 3960, and of uncultivated upwards of 30,000. Of 
these a portion, equal to one-seventh of the present arable acres, 
might be profitably added to the cultivated land. The number of 
acres in a state of undivided common is about 4500, and the num. 
Der under wood, natural and planted, may be 500. The planta- 



430 FOllFARSHmE. 

tions are, for the most part, young, and consist chiefly of larch and 
Scotch fir, to which sorts of timber the soil appears most congenial. , 

Rent of Land— The average rent of arable land per imperial 
acre may be estimated at L.l. To the arable, however, is com- 
monly annexed a portion of hill ground, or the privilege of mountam 
pasture. The charge for grazing is, in the lower district, at the 
rate of L.2 per ox or cow, and in the upper district, on hdl and . 
boa pasture, from VSs. to 14s. ; for a full-grown sheep, Is. 6d. 

/.zue-SifflcA.— The numbers of cattle, sheep, and horses are 
nearly as follows, viz. 231 horses, 1785 cattle, and 9680 sheep. 
The cattle are of the Angus and Highland breeds. The sheep 
are of the black- faced breed, and, are brought, for the most part 
when young, from the Linton and Lanark markets. 

ilushandry.— 1\\e rotation of cropping generally observed 
throuo-hout the parish is that of six years, viz. 1. fallow; 2. corn 
sown out with grass seeds ; 3. and 4. grass ; 5. and 6. corn. This 
mode of cropping is, however, in many instances, about to give way 
to a rotation of seven years. The land will thus remain three 
years in grass,— a period of rest which seems necessary in order 
to keep it" in a favourable state of production. 

The general duration of leases is fourteen years,— a term which 
is obviously less fevourable than one of nineteen to an active and 

industrious tenant. . , -, r 

Twenty-two of the proprietors fiirm their own lands. The farms 
vary in size from 8 to 200 acres and upwards, exclusive ot untilled 
ground. Great attention is now paid to their drainage and cul- 
Ture In the southern district especially, they are well laid out. 
Much has yet to be done in the way of fencing, although, in re- 
gard to a few of the larger farms, the fields are well enclosed 
The farm-buildings are in general suitable to the possessions, and 
in tolerable repair. Several of them are of recent erection, and 
are at once substantial and commodious. , , f

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication.— The nearest post-office is at Mei- 
gle. There is, however, a sub-office at Alyth, which is the near- 
est market-town, and about eight miles from the church of 
Glenisla. Two lines of ro.ad are kept in repair by the Statute 
Labour Assessment, — the one leading to Alyth, the other 
communicating with Kirriemuir and Castletown of Braemar 
by the Spittal of Glenshee. The former of these is about eight 
and a half miles in length, the latter six. The other roads are, 
for the most part, imperfectly formed, and prove very indifferent 
means of communication. The bridges are four in number, of 
which two are of stone, one of iron, and one of wood. The two 
latter are intended chiefly for foot-passeno-ers. 

Ecclesiastical State.-The church is centrically situated [for the 
population; but, from the great length of the parish, and its moun- 
tainous nature scarcely more than one-half of the inhabitants are 
wuhin four miles of it. It was built in 1821, is in a good state of 
repair and affords accommodation for 700 persons. The seats 
are allotted to the people according to the valued rent of the pro- 
per les on which they reside. The manse was built in 1813, and 
sua ,n good condition. The glebe consists of about eight acres.

ian Knowledge, and the other is unendowed. The parochial 
teacher has the legal accommodation and the medium salary. 
His salary, with school-fees, is about L.40 per annum. The m- 
fome of the Society school teacher is L.20 ; and that of the un 
endowed teacher about L.18. The average rate o school-fees is 
2s 6d. per quarter. The branches commonly taught are reading 
wHting, arithmetic, grammar, and geography. There are none of 
the Younc betwixt six and fifteen years of age who cannot read 
Of persons upwards of fifteen, there are 3 who can n-ther read 
nor write. The schools are conveniently situated for the bulk of 
Z population. The young, who reap not the f u 1 benefit of them 
elide near the extremities of the parish, or in detached district . 
These parts are so thinly inhabited, that the erection of schools 
in them' s hardly to be expected. During the winter season the 
el ools are well attended. In summer the attendance is compa- 
advely small, a great proportion of the young being employed in

Te poorer children are taught gratis. An endowment for the 
school in the Burn of Kilry district is much wanted. Nearly two- 
fifths of the young are within a reasonable distance of it ; and a 
Moderate endowment, while it would reduce the price of education 
rfhe poor, would also secure permanently the services of an effi- 
rPnt teacher for that populous part of the parish.

ing, the poor consider public aid as degrading, and are reluctant 
to apply for parochial relief. 

Fairs — There are two annual fairs. One of these, at which 
a few horses are offered for sale, is held on the 1st Wednesday of 
March, O, S. The other is held on the 1st Wednesday of Au-

mosses, at the expense of making and carriage. 

Miscellaneous Observations, 
Smce the date of the last Statistical Account, smuggling has 
been entirely suppressed ; the statute labour has been converted 
mto money, a change of system the good effects of which are every 
year becommg more apparent by the improved state of the roads • 
a stone and an iron suspension bridge have been thrown across the 
Isia ; occupancy by runrig has, with a single exception, been 
abandoned; and one-third at .least has been added to the culti- 
vated land of the parish. 

The reduction of the duty on ardent spirits, whatever bad con- 
sequences may have resulted from it elsewhere, has been produc- 
tive of the best effects here, both in respect of the morals and in- 
dustry of thepopulation. By putting an end to illicit distillation, 
It has been the means of directing the efiorts of the people towards 
extensive agncultural improvements. And the consequences are, 
hat wh e formerly, to use the words of the last Statistical Ac 
count, the gram produced in this district was not sufficient for 
the consumption of the mhabitants," several thousand bolls of it are 
now un ess m very unfavourable seasons, annually sent to the market 
Whde formerly most of the families laboured in a vocation aj 
once dishonourable, debasing, and yielding them at best a preca 
no s means of subsistence, they are now actively engaged in pur 
u.ts which tend to enhance their own comfort in fvfry poiiftTf

mon. Several of these allotments in the lower district are already 
covered with thriving plantations. This is one of the good ef- 
fects of the division of commons, which, it is to be hoped will m a 
few years be more generally observed in the parish : wh.le the im- 
provement of live-stock, and an additional quantity of land under 
tillage, are other results from the same cause, which may pretty 
confidently be anticipated. , , • • 

It is matter of regret that neither the advantages of their m- 
dustrv, nor the benefits of public worship, have, hitherto been sut- 
ficienUy enjoyed by the people here, from the want of a proper 
line of road to connect the upper and the lower distric s with each 
other The present line, which crosses the hill of Kilry, is, from 
its st'eepness, always inconvenient, and in winter storms, from its 
great elevation, frequently impassable. It was lately Foposed to 
abandon this road for one that should communicate with Strath- 
more by the eastern base of Kilry, and be connected by a bridge, 
near the church, with the road from Kirriemuir to Braemar, al- 
ready noticed in this report. With respect to the economy and 
industry of the parish, this would be an improvement of the great- 
est consequence, while, by rendering Glenisla an eJ « 
communication between Newtyle and the north of Scothind, it 
would, in a public point of view, be of no small importance.

south to its northern extremity, is about 10 miles in length; to- 
wards the south, where it is bounded by the junction of the South 
Esk and Prosen rivers, it is narrow, and in the form of an acute- 
angle. Its mean breadth is about 4 miles ; its superficial area is 
upwards of 37 square miles, or 23,680 English acres. It is bound- 
ed on the south and south-west, by the parishes of Kirriemuir and 
Kingoldrum ; on the east, by Tannadice ; on the north-east, by a 
range of the Grampian mountains, which separates it from the pa- 
rish of Lochlee ; and on the north-west, by Clova. Clova is about 
10 miles in length and 4 in breadth ; the inhabited or arable part 
of it is about 4 miles in length, and half a mile in breadth. It is 
bounded on the south-west, by Glenprosen, a district of the pa- 
rish of Kirriemuir; on the west, by Glenisla ; and on the north- 
east, by the parishes of Glenmuick and Lochlee. 

Topographical Appearances.— The general appearance of the 
parish is mountainous. On the south-east part of Cortachy, the 
surface is greatly and beautifully diversified. Of late years the 
grounds have been highly improved, and are either under various 
agricultural crops or adorned with young and thriving plantations. 
Ihis portion of the parish is composed partly of level, but for the 
greater part of rising grounds,-the latter, forming the commence- 
ment of one of the ranges of the Grampian mountains, decline on 
the south and south-west to the river Prosen, and on the east and 
north-east to the Southesk river. The above mountain-range ex- 
tends in an irregular form nearly the whole length of the parish, 
forming its boundary on the south-west. Opposite to this is a simi- 
lar range of mountains, but in general of greater elevation ; extend- 
ing the who length of the united parish, and forming its boundary

west direction ; from these defiles, the appearance of the sur- 
rounding mountains, for height and grandeur, can scarcely be sur- 
passed by any mountain scenery in the Highlands of Scotland. 

The temperature of the atmosphere, owing to the surrounding 
high mountains, is frequently of considerable humidity, especially 
in the northern district of the parish. 

Hydrography.— The united parish is most abundantly supplied 
with springs. Of these, some are intermittent, but the greater 
number are perennial. Some of their waters are strongly chaly- 
beate, the rest are pure and of excellent quality. There are three 
lakes or lochs in the united parish, namely, Wharral, Brany, and 
Esk Loch Wharral is situated in the bosom of the mountam 
range, which forms the north-east boundary of the parish, about 
seven miles to the north of the church of Cortachy, and upwards 
of 1000 feet above the level of the valley of the Esk. It is fully 
a mile in circumference. In several parts, its depth is very consi- 
derable. It is surrounded by mountainous summits, exception the 
south side, where its superabundant waters descend mto the river 
Esk Loch Brany in Clova is situated about two miles to the 
north-west of Loch Wharral, on the side of the same mountam 
range, and about the same elevation. It is about a mile and a- 
half in circumference, and of great depth in several places. T e 
lofty summits of the surrounding mountains, with their rocky and 
dangerous precipices, give to the whole landscape a wild and er- 
rific'appearancel Loch Esk is situated amongst tl- -ount n 
about six miles to the north-west of the valley of Clova I 
about half a mile in circumference. It is in no part ot great 
depth. The surrounding mountain-scenery, although very exten- 
sive has httle in it very striking or grand. The only river m he 
mited parish is the South Esk. Although Loch Esk is generally 
HetLd to be its source, and affords it a orli; 
water there are several mountain streams from a still higher eit 
X and considerably larger than that from the loch, particu- 
Lrly the stream of Falfearnie, which may be properly regarded 
as tie source of this river. The watei-s of the Esk have a rad 
descent from the mountains over a rocky channel, unt .ty reach 
i valley of Clova, where they are joined by the White Water, 
1' ery considerable stream, formed amongst the -oun ains u-

through the parish is upwards of twenty miles in length, and it 
falls into the German Ocean at Montrose. 

Cascade. — The only waterfall on the Southesk river deserving 
of notice may be seen about a mile to the southward of Lochesk, 
near to the shooting-lodge of Bachnagairn. The fall is upwards 
of 60 feet. The narrow channel of the river beside it, formed by 
high perpendicular rocks, and the surrounding grounds covered 
with trees, partly indigenous and partly planted, give to the place 
a truly picturesque appearance. 

Geology. — The rocks consist of red sandstone and pudding- 
stone, serpentine, whinstone, mica-schist, gneiss, clay-slate, quartz, 
and granite. Serpentine is well seen at the bridge of Cortachy, 
where it crosses the Esk, and cuts through a portion of the old 
red sandstone formations, in the same manner as the many trap 
dikes of this county. Its course is north-east and south-west. It 
is seen again in a ravine on the cavity, near the farm of the Bal- 
loch, where its relation to the red sandstone, and a pudding-stone 
containing quartz pebbles, are still more clearly exhibited. The 
serpentine is sometimes of an olive-green, sometimes of a dark- 
green or blue colour, and traversed by innumerable veins of asbes- 
tus. The surface has generally a glazed appearance. In some 
places much greenish bronze-coloured diallage is intermixed. The 
whole mass of serpentine is not stratified, but is schistose on the 
great scale, dividing with some degree of regularity into slabs or 
flattish masses, which are parallel to the sides of the dike. These 
slabs have wedge-shaped terminations. The dip of the red and 
gray sandstone is generally to the south. A remarkable exception 
occurs, however, at a short distance above the bridge of Cortachy, 
where the beds dip to the north ; but in this case they form part 
of a mass of which the stratification in general is vertical. Lime- 
stone has also been found in various places, particularly in Clova, 
on the side of the mountain towards the south-east part of the 
valley. This limestone is subordinate to the mica-schistic forma- 
tion, and is similarly stratified. Some of the limestone has been 
quarried, burnt with peat, and used as manure. Although part 
of It when burnt was found to contain a considerable quantity of 
sand, yet other portions of it, taken from a greater depth in the 
rock, when burnt, proved to be of good quality. The burning of 
limestone here has hitherto been very partially attempted, the dif- 
ficulty of access to the quarry, and the labour and expense attend-

ant on procuring the necessary quantities of peat or coal, seem to 
be the chief hinderances to its being more generally prepared, 
both for building and manure. Towards the south part of Cor- 
tachy, near to the base of the Milehill, there is a large vein of 
blue slate. It has been partially wrought ; but the slates are so 
small and brittle, as not to be considered of sufficient value to de- 
fray the expense of working. It is not unlikely thai greater exer- 
tions than have hitherto been made in this parish to procure good 
slate, may yet be attended with the wished-for success. 

Soils.— T\\eve are various kinds of soil in the united parish. A 
considerable portion of the arable lands consists of a sharp gravel, 
inclining in several places to a fine gravelly loam, and in other 
parts to a thin, hard, and stony soil, or to sand. In the southern 
district of the parish, the soil has a considerable quantity of clay 
in its composition, incumbent on a till or mortar subsoil. On the 
bases of the hills, a corfsiderable portion of the soil is fine and 
deep, other parts of it are thin, hard, and stony, or contain large 
quantities of moss. In the valleys of Wateresk and Clova there 
is a great quantity of alluvial soil formed from the sediment of the 
waters; it is rather inclined to sand, with particles of moss m its 
composition, giving it a dark brown colour. In comparison with 
the other soils, it may be termed a deep sandy loam. Most ot 
the lands where this soil prevails have been cultivated and, in or- 
dinary dry seasons, yield excellent crops of various kinds When 
the summers are rainy, the crops are apt to be more or less injur- 
ed by the overflowing of the waters of the Esk. This injury to 
whidi the crops are exposed has, of late years, been very much 
diminished, by the numerous drains which have been formed at 
great expense, for carrying off the stagnant waters, as soon as the 
channel of the river can receive them. Those parts of the above 
soil which remain uncultivated, produce abundant crops of grass, 
fit either for pasture or hay. 

Boulders, many of them of large size, are to be found in the se- 
veral soils. These are easily accounted for, from their nearness 
to the rocks on the sides of the mountains from which they have

Adders and lizards are frequently seen on the mountains, and 
some of them of large size. 

Fishes. — The three lochs in the parish contain trout. Trout 
are numerous in that portion of the river Esk which passes through 
Clova and Cortachy ; many of them are large in size, and of good 
quality. The largest get the name of loch trout, known from their 
colour and shape to have come from Loch Esk. Sea trout are 
often caught in the river here during summer. Very few salmon 
are seen before the middle of September, when the fisheries in the 
lower parts of the river close ; towards the end of September, and 
in October, several of them come up for spawning on the banks of 
gravel along the channel of the river, and return to the sea in No- 
vember and December. 

The pearl muscle is to be found in various places along the 
channel of the river, but it is seldom sought after, the pearl it 
contains being small in size, and of little value. 

Botany. — The mountains of the united parish, especially those 
of Clova, are highly celebrated for the great number and variety 
of plants which they produce. On them, almost all those plants 
which are common to such districts are not only found, but also 
many of the rarer species, and several which have not been disco- 
vered as far as is known in any other district of Scotland. 
There are few places to which the botanist can repair in summer 
with more hope and delight, in pursuit of his favourite science, 
than to the glen of the Doll, on the south-west of the valley of 
Clova. There, on every side, he readily meets with some rare 
and blooming treasure. The late Mr George Don of Forfar 
seems to have been one of the first eminent botanists who took a 
particular interest in finding out the botanical treasures of Clova. 
For this purpose he spent not only a few days, but some weeks 
for several successive summers, amid the flowers and the solitude 
of the glens. Since Mr Don's death, the mountains of Clova have 
been visited by many of the most distinguished botanists of Britain. 
They were frequently visited by the late Mr Drummond of Forfar, 
who discovered some new plants there. They have been frequently 
visited by Dr Graham, Professor of Botany in the University of 
Edinburgh, and by many young gentlemen, botanical students, 
who accompanied him. They have been visited by Sir W. J. 
Hooker, Professor of Botany in the University of Glasgow ; by 
Dr R. K. Greville, Edinburgh, and by Mr Macnab of the Royal 
Botanic Gardens, Edinburgh, &amp;c.

Grasses on the pasture grounds : Where the land is good and dry, 
the prevailing grasses are, Anthoxanihum odoratum, different species 
of the Poa, Festuca, Aira, and Agrostis. Where the land is wet, the 
prevailing grasses are, Nardus stricta, different species Juncus 
and Carex. On the mossy grounds, there is a considerable quan- 
titv of Scirpus ccespitosus, Eriophorum vaginatum, and angustifo- 
Uum. Hgpnum, Lychnis, and Carex are common on the tops of 

the mountains . . 

Plantations.-Theve are several plantations m the united pa- 
rish, which have been for the most part formed in the course ot 
the last twenty-seven years. Some of these plantations are m 
r.iountainous districts. One of the largest thus situated contains 
about 500 acres, and another about 150 acres. The other planta- 
tions are generally situated in the lower grounds, particularly along 
the banks of the South Esk and Prosen rivers. These planta- 
tions are all thriving very well. They are already useful in many 
respects, and give a new and highly improved appearance to the 
rnr-l scenery. The trees which have been planted in the iiioun- 
Is districts are larch, spruce, and Scotch fir. The lower 
grounds are planted with oak and various other kmds of hard-wood, 
fog ther with a mixture of larch and other firs. In the grounds 
arLnd the Castle of Cortachy, there are a great many fine t 1 
t "es, upwards of one hundred years old, consisting of various kinds,

as ash, elm, plane, larch, beech, spruce, limes, Scotch fir, and 
chestnuts. 

The followinjr is the measurement of a few of the trees : —

5. A lime, .62 7 

6. A common fir, .47 6 

7. A chestnut, . 45 8 

In the neighbourhood of the castle, there is a very fine old hol- 
ly hedge, nearly 400 yards in length, and from 12 to 20 feet in 
height. There is also a great variety of evergreens and shrubs, 
most of which have been planted in the 'course of the last twenty 
years. They are thriving remarkably well, and give a fine ap- 
pearance to the pleasure grounds ; which have of late years been 
greatly enlarged, and highly improved. In the mountainous dis- 
trict near to Lochesk, in Clova, several acres of land were plant- 
ed, about fourteen years ago, with larch, spruce, and Scotch firs. 
Although the situation is high, exposed, and cold, yet the greater 
proportion of the larch and spruce trees have already attained a 
considerable height, and answer the purpose for which they were 
intended, as shelter for deer, — the above plantation forming part 
of an extensive forest for deer, in the upper districts of Clova and 
Glenisla, belonging to the Earl of Airlie, and Colonel the Ho- 
nourable Donald Ogilvy of Clova. 

Many large old trees, chiefly ash and plane, are to be seen 
here and there throughout the united parish ; also natural birch, 
alder, mountain-ash, and hazel. 

The quantities of old wood found in the mossy and marshy 
grounds tend to show, that, in former times, trees had not only 
been common, but many of them of large size throughout the pa- 
rish. For many years, it has been known that a large oak was 
imbedded in a marsh near the side of the river Esk, about 
one mile north from Cortachy Castle. The marsh having been 
recently drained, has permitted the tree to be dug out. Mr 
Blackadder, land-surveyor, Glammis, having been requested to 
examme it, reports that it is not entire, the root end of the 
trunk, apparently to the extent of one-third of its length, hav- 
ing been destroyed by fire, which had also penetrated up through 
it heart to the forks, where the principal limbs branch of; two 
ot which were found lying in the position as they had fallen, and 
were broken over at that point. Some portions which had been 
most deeply submerged are in a fresh state, particularly the greater

part of the largest limb, which may be cut up into planks. The 
trunk is the most decayed part, it having been a very long period 
since it was partially uncovered by the digging away of the peats, 
during which it has been exposed to the alternate action of the 
air and moisture. The portion of the trunk yet remaining is 13 
feet in length, and girths 25 feet at its top end, and 18 at the 
other, which, from the direction of the fibres, appears to have 
been the smallest part of the bole. The two limbs are each 20 
feet in length,— the one girths 6, and the other 9 feet; exhibit- 
ing in whole the skeleton of nearly 600 cubic feet of timber. But 
from the rotten state of the trunk, it is obvious that it is now much 
reduced in its girths ; and, as is the case with such trees, the butt- 
end, which is burned off, girths always considerably more than any 
other part of them. Therefore, taking that portion of the bole still 
remaining as not containing more than two-thirds of its original 
quantity of timber, and making an allowance for the smaller limbs 
proportioned to the average of such trees, which, although not 
now to be seen, have evidently existed to some extent, and may 
have been wasted away, or perhaps destroyed by the fire, or car- 
ried off at its originaf discovery, it is not improbable that it may 
have contained at one period fully 1000 cubic feet of timber. 
Such a tree, like some of the kind still existing in a growing state 
in England, may have been 1000 years old before it was burned 
down,°and may have been long previously rotten and hollow in the 
heart near the ground, and have occasionally afforded shelter 
to the hunter or wanderer, and at last been destroyed by their 
fires kindled within it, as indicated by the charred portions being 
up through its heart, and none on its exterior. But whether this, 
and the other inferences as to its original size, be just or not, the 
visible remains excite much interest; for although there have been 
and still are various oaks much larger in England, yet the remains 
of this show it to have been the largest oak tree hitherto general- 
ly known to have grown in Scotland, and afford an additional 
proof to a few others, of the gigantic size which the native oaks 
had formerly attained amongst the Grampian glens,— in some of 
the more eastern of which, as actually obtains in this particular glen, 
not a shrub of them is now to be found in a growing state, the 
whole of the existing species having been planted.

In the mossy ground on the farm of Rottal, about five miles to 
the north of the castle of Cortach}', the trunk of an oak tree was 
dug out in 1833. It measured 43 feet in length, and 3 feet in 
diameter. It was considerably decayed about the middle. The 
two ends were sound, and each measured about 1.' feet in length. 
The wood was thoroughly dried, and portions of it were made into 
beautiful pieces of furniture. 

II. — Civil History. 

Eminent Characters. — Family of Airlie. — Many persons belong- 
ing to the Noble family of Airlie, who took an active part in the 
public transactions of the times in which they lived, as legislators 
and warriors, were connected with Cortachy by birth, i-esidence, or 
burial. An account of the genealogy of this Noble family, and of 
such persons belonging to it as held a prominent position in public 
affairs, is considered particularly deserving of notice in a Statistical 
Account of this parish. The following short account has been 
furnished to the writer by a gentleman who was possessed of the 
best means now attainable for acquiring correct information in re- 
ference to the genealogy and history of this Noble family, and 
whose attention has been particularly directed to these matters : 

Few names claiming a Gaelic origin can be so distinctly traced 
to a remote period as the Noble name of Ogilvy, now represented 
by David, Earl of Airlie, the twenty-first in direct descent from 
Gilbert, third son to Gillebrede, Maormar of Angus, who assum- 
ed the surname of Ogilvy on obtaining, from King William the 
Lion, the lands so designated soon after 1165, and who witnessed 
the donation of the church of Monyfode to the Abbey of Aber- 
brothwick, by his brother, Gille Chriosda, the servant of Christ, 
Gilchrist Maormar, or Earl of Angus, in or before 1207. 

Chalmers, in Caledonia, traces the progenitors of Gillebrede as 
Maormars of Angus prior to 939. Gillebrede was a hostage for 
the release of William the Lion, so called from substituting the 
Lion for the dragon as the national arms, in 1174, and died in 
1180, leaving issue by a daughter of Cospatricus Comes, ancestor 
of the noble house of Dunbar and March, inter alios, three sons, 
Is, Gilchrist, Earl of Angus, whose male heirs failed in 1225; 
'2.d, Magnus, Earl of Caithness, whose male heirs failed in 1330; 
d, Gilbert de Ogilvy, in whose direct heir, now Earl of Airlie, 
IS vested the male representation of these two ancient titles. Gil- 
bert's descendant in the fourth generation. Sir Patrick de Ogilvie, 
in 1309, adhered steadily to King Robert L The lands and ba' 
rony of Cortachy were acquired in 1369-70. Sixth generation,

Sir Walter Ogilvy, sheriff of Angus, fell at Gaskclune in 1394. 
Seventh generation, Sir Walter was High Treasurer of Scotland in 
1425, and Treasurer of James l.'s household in 1431. Eighth 
generation, Sir John obtained from the Crown, the lands, barony, 
and castle of Eroly, now Airlie, in 1458-9. Ninth generation, 
from Sir James, ambassador to Denmark, created Lord Ogilvy of 
Airlie in 1491, descended James, sixth Lord, a faithful servant to 
Queen Mary, and ambassador from King James VI. to Christiern 
IV. of Denmark, in 1596. His grandson James, Lord Ogilvy of 
Airlie, of whom a portrait is extant in plate armour, was created 
in 1639, Earl of Airlie, Baron Ogilvie of Alyth and Lintrathen, 
by King Charles 1. in reward for his loyalty. In 1640, his cas- 
tles of Airlie and Forter in Glenisla were pillaged and burnt by 
Argyle and 5000 of his followers. In 1644, the Earl and his 
three sons, one of whom fell at Inverlochy, joined his cousin- 
german Montrose, aided materially in gaining the battle of Kil- 
syth, and remained true to the King and his lieutenant to the last. 
His son, James, second Earl, after the Restoration, was a Privy- 
councillor, and commanded a body of cavalry ; in 1688, joined the 
Viscount of Dundee, in an offer to King James, to oppose the ad- 
vance of the Prince of Orange, and died at an advanced age soon 
after 1693, when Earl David, his son, succeeded. His eldest son, 
James, Lord Ogilvie, being attainted for joining the Chevalier de 
St George in 1715, the peerage was dormant from Earl David's 
death in°1717, till Lord Ogilvy's demise in 1731, when it devolv- 
ed to his only brother, John, Earl of Airlie. His eldest son, Da- 
vid, Lord Ogilvy, in the generous enthusiasm of youth, joined the 
Chevalier at°Edinburgh, in October 1745, with a regiment of 600 
men, and continued true and loyal to his cause. He afterwards 
entered the French service, in which he obtained the rank of a 
lieutenant-general, was colonel of a regiment, and a knight of St 
Louis in 1778. His Majesty George III. was pleased to restore 
him to his country and estates. He was a man of great integrity ; 
he died atCortachy Castle, 3d March 1803, aged 78. David 
Lord Ogilvy being attainted for joining Prince Charles in 1745, 
the peerage was again dormant from the demise of his father. Earl 
John in 1761, till the death of the Master of Airlie, Lord Ogil- 
vy's only son, in 1812. The Honourable Walter Ogilvy of Clova, 
then of Airlie, assumed the peerage, and after a long life of acti- 
vity and usefulness, died at Cortachy Castle, the 16th of April 
1819 aged 86, as full of honour as of years, being succeeded by 
his son the present Earl. The two lapses in the succession to the

peerage, having placed Earl Walter''s family, as to their rank, in 
an undefined position, King George IV., in 1826, graciously 
amended it, by causing Parliament, as an act of justice, to reverse 
the attainders of James and David, Lords Ogilvy ; but the act to 
relieve all the family of Earl Walter " from certain civil disabili- 
' ties" did not profess to be an act of restoration, the peerage never 
having been forfeited by Act of Parliament. 

Land-oioners. — The Right Honourable the Earl of Airlie, Lord 
Lieutenant of the county of Forfar, and one of the representative 
peers of Scotland, is sole proprietor of Cortachy, and patron of 
the churches of the united parish. His Lordship's brother, 
Colonel the Honourable Donald Ogilvy, is sole proprietor of 
Clova. 

Parochial Registers. — There are four volumes of old parochial 
records. The date of their earliest entry is November 1659, and 
they are brought down to 1732, with the exception of the years 
from 1687 to 1697. They appear to have been regularly kept. 
They contain registers of contract of marriages, of births and bap- 
tisms, and give a particular account of the proceedings of the 
kirk-session. From these records it appears, that, at the periods 
when they were written, the lands of the united parish were divid- 
ed amongst several proprietors. There are another four volumes 
of parochial registers, beginning in 1747, and continued down to 
the present time, in reference to sessional proceedings and con- 
tracts of marriage. They appear to have been pretty regularly 
kept. The only irregularity seems to have arisen from the negli- 
gence of parents, in registering the births and baptisms of their 
children. This is a duty, to the performance of which, many pa- 
rents are still inattentive. 

Antiquities — In the church-yard of Cortachy there are some 
tombstones of considerable antiquity. Two of these were placed 
inside the former church, and though their position was unavoida- 
bly altered when the church was rebuilt, they have been properly 
cared for : one of them, having inscribed on it various figures and 
letters, bears date 1616; the other, of fine stone, and\he work 
on it better executed, appears to be of older date. It has several 
figures finely engraven on it, but the inscription has become il- 
legible. 

The ruins of a religious house, called the chapel of Lethnot, are 
still to be seen, about four miles to the north of the church of Cor- 
tachy. About half a mile to the west of the church of Clova 



446 FOUFAllSHIRE. 

part of an old building, called the castle of Ciova, still remains. 
Inside the wall which is standing, there are some steps of a stair. ' 
The wall is upwards of 25 feet in height, and more than 4 feet 
thick, and the cement of lime with which it has been built is as 
hard as the stones which it keeps together. No proper account 
of its history is known. The traditionary report is, that it was de- 
stroyed in the time of Oliver Cromwell. From the site of the rums 
there is an extensive view of the valley, and of the sides of the 
surrounding mountains. About 200 yards to the north of the 
church of Clova there was a mansion-house, where the proprietor 
of Clova occasionally resided. It has been completely removed. 
The boundary of the garden, which was connected with it, is mark- 
ed out by a row of fine old trees by which the ground is surround- 

Mansion-house.— The only mansion-house in the united parish 
is the Castle of Cortachy, which has been long a favourite place 
of residence for the Noble family of Airlie. It is placed in a low 
and beautiful situation on the south side of the river Esk, and to- 
wards the southern extremity of Cortachy. It is not ascertained 
when, by whom, or for what purpose the castle was originally built. 
A portion of it bears the marks of great antiquity. Additions have 
been made to it at different times ; the latest, and one of the largest 
of these, was made in 1820-21, which has tended greatly to its 
convenience and ornament. It is a magnificent building, and af- 
fords ample accommodation for a large establishment. The pub- 
lic rooms of the castle contain many excellent paintings; also many 
fine portraits. Among these, several portraits of former and pre- 
sent members of the noble family. 

Modern Buildings.— Thee are the church of Cortachy, some 
farm-houses, some farm-steadings, two corn-mills, and several very 
neat cottages. The houses are built of stone and lime, and co- 
vered with blue slates. 

In addition to the above buildings, there is a finely-built ceme- 
tery, belonging to the Noble family of Airlie, adjoining the church 
of Cortachy, which was erected at the same time that the present 
church was built, the family burying-ground being inside the for- 
mer church. In this cemetery, the bodies of several of the departed 
members of the family have been interred. Amongst others, Da- 
vid fifth Earl of Airlie; Walter, sixth Earl of Airlie; also Jane, 
his'countess, who died on the 11th of June 1818, aged 56 ; and 
also Clementina, late Countess of Airhe, whose memory will be

long held in grateful remembrance, who died at London, 1st Sep- 
tember 1835, in the 41st year of her age. 

Handsome monumental tablets of marble, with appropriate in- 
scriptions, have been placed on the walls around their graves.

The yearly thinning and pruning of the woods are particularly 
attended to, and under excellent management. A report on the 
planting of lands on the Airlie estates, to the extent of 3000 acre , 
in Forfarshire and Perthshire, under the management of Mr Wil- 
liam Anderson, was submitted to the Highland Society of Scot- 
land in 1330 ; and the Society's gold medal was adjudged to the 
Earl of Airlie. In no other parish has there yet been such an 
extent of land planted as in the parish of Cortachy, on the estates 

of Airlie. , . , . ,

of the Angus breed. They are of middling size thrive very well

have, for the greater part, been reared in the parish. They a e 
of the ordinary size, well-shaped, and durable. Owing to the 
lat extent of mountainous pasture, the farmers att.nd particu- 
farlv toX rearing of sheep. There are two kinds of sheep rear- 
ed tbe bkck-faced and the Cheviot breeds. Some Ivundreds o 
former are annually bred here, but the greater number of both

four, yet they are generally disposed of when three years old ; and 
many of them fail not to bring the highest prices in the markets. 

The farmers prefer the black-faced sheep for rearing. They 
stand the storms of winter better, and are not so expensive to 
keep as the Cheviots. 

Husbandnj.—The rotation of cropping generally adopted ex- 
tends to five or seven years, and is as follows :— For five years 
oats after grass, green crop, barley or oats with grass-seeds, gra4 
cut, grass pastured. For seven years ; two crops of corn after 
grass, green crop, barley or oats, with grass-seeds, and three 
years m grass, cut the first year, and pastured the two followino- 
years. The state of husbandry has of late years been very much 
improved. Many acres of land, formerly uncultivated, have been 
brought under the plough, and now yield excellent crops. Drain- 
ing on many of the farms has been particularly attended to. Sur- 
face-drain.ng which has been carried on to a considerable extent, 
has been followed with the best effects on the pastures. Irria- 
tion, where practicable, has been partially adopted, and its advaiv 
tages have been experienced, in destroying the heath and improv- 
ing the grasses. Strong embankments, and of considerable extent, 
have been lormed along the banks of the Esk, near to the south- 
ern extremity of Cortachy. Deepening the channel of the river 
in certam places, straightening its course, and forming proper em 
bankments, would no doubt be attended with good effects to the" 

whetU: I -f"' "' very doubtfu 

whether the expenses which would be incurred in completing such 

an undertaking would not exceed the profits which could le ex- 
pected to result from it. 

The general duration of leases in the united parish is 
fourteen years. On many properties such a limited period mi' 1 
e considered unfavourable to the occupiers, and unfavourable'  
he improvement of their farms. Here it is attended with no in-

portion of the parish, great attention has been paid to enclosures 



450 FORFARSHIUK. 

These consist generally of stone-dikes, or of hedges conaposed of 
beech and thorn. Several substantial stone-dikes have recently 
been erected throughout the parish, for enclosing fields, and se- 
parating the arable from the pasture grounds. Many such fen- 
ces are still required. 

The great distance from markets, and from hme or marl, are 
the chief obstacles to agricultural improvement which the farmers 
in the upper districts of the parish have to contend with ; besides, 
the crops of corn, before they are suffieiently ripened, are apt to be 
occasionally injured by the autumnal evening frosts which are so 
common in upland districts. 

Whilst the farmers are, in general, particularly attentive to the 
proper management of their sheep and cattle, as a body they are 
no less attentive to the proper management of the lands, which 
they have under a regular rotation of cropping, by draining, by 
enclosing, by an application of lime or marl, and an observance of 
that mode of farming which is considered most suitable to the dis- 
trict They receive the greatest encouragement for the improve- 
ment of their farms, and of their live-stock, from the Noble and 
honourable proprietors of the parish. 

Produce.— The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 
the united parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows:— 

In Cortachy. 

Oats, 2036 quarters, at L.l , 2s, per quarter. 
Barley, 354 quarters, at L.l, 7s. per quarter,

the, people in the southern part of the parish about four miles, and 
from those in the northern part of it about eighteen miles. The 
means of communication are, the post-office at Kirriemuir, and 
the roads none of which are turnpike leading in different direc- 
tions to and from the parish. The alteration of the direction 
of some of the lines of road is a great improvement, which has 
been effected in the course of the last twenty years. The roads 
in general are of a proper breadth. They have been well form- 
ed, and are kept in a proper state of repair. The line of road 
leading to Strathmore extends the whole length of the inhabited 
portion of the united parish. Several miles of this road are now 
in excellent order, and the improvements which have recently been 
made on it will doubtless, from the good effects resulting from 
them, afford encouragement to all parties concerned to use their 
endeavours to render this road good, even to its northern bound- 
ary. There is no carriage road from Clova across the mountains 
to Deeside. A survey was made some years ago of a line of road 
to extend over the Cappel Mount. This line, to carry which into 
effect, has been considered, by an experienced surpeyor, quite 
practicable, would afford the means of easy communication be- 
tween the people in this county and those in the upper districts 
of Aberdeenshire. 

Bridffes.—The two principal bridges connected with the parish 
are those across the Southesk and Prosen rivers,— the former, near 
to the church of Cortachy, has only one arch. It is narrow, like 
most old bridges, of excellent workmanship, and romantically situ- 
ated. The latter crosses the Prosen, on the line of road leading 
to Strathmore. It was widened some years ago, and has been 
substantially built. There are several smaller bridges on different 
hnes of road throughout the parish, which are in good repair. 
There is also a neat suspension bridge across the Southesk river, 
opposite to the church of Clova, for foot-passengers, and also for 
horses when the ford below becomes impassable. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church of Cortachy is placed nearly 
at the southern extremity of the parish, and consequently is not 
conveniently situated for the greater part of the population. It 
was bu.lt in 1828-29, on the site of the former church. It is an 
elegant building. The internal work has been very tastefully exe- 
cuted. It IS sufficiently large, affording accommodation for 550 
persons and it is delightfully situated. It was built at the expense 
ot the harl of Airlie, and cost considerably upwards of L 2000 



452 FORFARSHIRE. 



The sittings in the church are all free, that is, the heritors receive 
no money for them ; they are divided amongst the farmers and the 
other householders in the parish. The manse was built in 1796 ; 
it was partially repaired a few years ago. It is sufficiently large 
and comfortable. The extent of the glebe is about ten acres, and 
its annual value about L.15. The amount of the stipend is 15 
chalders, the one-half oatmeal, the other barley, and L.8, 6s. 8d. 
for communion elements. 

The church of Clova is about ten miles distant from the church 
of Cortachy. It is not known when it was built. There was a 
gallery erected in the west end of it in 1731 ; but, from the ap- 
pearance of the building, and from statements contained in the pa- 
rochial registers, it is probable that the church had been long built 
before the gallery was erected. The seats in the church of Clova 
were lately renewed, and the church is in good repair. It is con- 
veniently situated for the population of Clova, and of the northern 
district of Cortachv. It affords accommodation for about 250 
persons. The sittings are all free, with the exception of those in 
the gallery, which are let for the benefit of the poor. 

There was a suitable and comfortable house erected in Clova 
about twenty-four years ago by the Noble family of Airlie, for the 
accommodation of a missionary minister on the Royal Bounty. 
That house is still kept in good repair by the present honourable 
proprietor of Clova. In addition to the mission house, the minis- 
ter receives as much arable land, free of rent, as enables him to 
keep a cow and pony, summer and winter. The farmers within the 
bounds of the mission plough his land and drive his fuel. _ The 
minister officiates alternately in the church of Clova, and in the 
chapel of Glenprosen, connected with the parish of Kirriemuir, 
besides performing among the people within the bounds of the 
mission all the other duties connected with the office of the holy 
ministry. He receives annually L. 30 from the Committee 
on the Royal Bounty, L.30 from the people connected with he 
mission, and 20 guineas from the Earl of Airlie All the families 
in the united parish belong to the Established Church, with the 
exception of the Noble family of Airlie, the members of which aie 
Episcopalians. There are three individuals belonging to o 
families who are also Episcopalians. Dmne service at the cl urches 
of Cortachy and Clova is generally very well attended. The ave 
rase number of communicants is about 530 ; of these about 180

Education. — There are four schools in the parish at the present 
time ; the parochial, and three unendowed schools. The num- 
ber of scholars attending them is 130. There are, besides, about 
20 girls, who attend a female school, which, although not in the 
parish, is in its immediate neighbourhood. The unendowed schools 
are kept only during the winter season ; one of them is placed 
beside the mission house in Clova, and is taught by a young man, 
who is engaged and directed in his mode of teaching by the mi- 
nister. The number of scholars is 48, and the branches taught 
are, reading, writing, and arithmetic ; the other two unendowed 
schools in Cortachy are supported by the parents, or other rela- 
tives of the young persons who attend them. The teachers re- 
ceive a certain allowance in money for the time they are engaged, 
besides board and lodging. The number of scholars at these 
schools is 46 ; they are taught the ordinary branches of instruc- 
tion. The parochial school, which is situated near to the south- 
ern extremity of the parish, is attended by 38 scholars. The 
branches generally taught are, reading, writing, arithmetic, Eng- 
lish grammar, book-keeping, geography, and Latin, The salary 
IS the maximum,-L.34, 4s. 4d. The annual amount of school 
fees IS about L.IO. 

Library.~T\xere is one parochial library, which contains up- 
wards of 200 volumes. With the exception of some volumes of 
history, geography, and travels, the books consist chiefly of reli- 
gious publications. The library has been in a great measure sup- 
ported by donations of books, and of money with which to pur- 
chase books, from the Noble family of Airlie. Several of the 
books were selected and given by the late Countess of Airlie, who 
took a great interest in promoting the temporal and spiritual good 
hood '"" "''" generation in this parish and neighbour- 

Poor and Parochial Funds.-.The average number of persons 
receiving regular parochial aid is, 11 in Cortachy and 2 in Clova • 
the sum allotted to each varies from 3s. to 12s. per month. The 
collections made at the church of Clova are sufficient for the re- 
lief of the poor in that portion of the united parish. The annual 
expenditure for the poor in Cortachy is about L.42. The

and mortcloth dues, L.42, 16s. ; interest of money in the banlc, 
L4, 10s.; interest of mortified money, LA. The amount of 
mortified money is L.lOO, which was left by the late Mr Alex- 
ander Robie at Inveriskandy, who was a native of, and a farmer 
in, this parish ; the interest of this sum, accordmg to du-ections 
left by the donor, is annually distributed amongst the poor be- 
longino- to a certain district of the parish ; the minister and elders 
of thearish, and the heads of families in the specified district 
are appointed trustees. The wants and comfort of the poor are 
particularly attended to by the Noble family of Airlie. The dis- 
position among the poor in general to refrain from seeking paro- 
chial relief is very powerful. „ . n 

Pairs —There are two sheep-markets held annually at Uor- 
tachy, commonly called the CoUow markets, as they are held in 
the immediate neighbourhood of a farm of that name. 1 he fii-st 
established of these markets is held on the fourth Monday of Oc- 
tober, and has become one of the best sheep markets in the north 
of Scotland, both for the number and quality of the sheep which 
are there exposed ; the number being on an average from 8000 
to 12 000. The sheep brought to this market are generally three 
or four years old, and are purchased by proprietors or farmers in 
this and the adjoining counties, who feed them off during the 

.inter with turnips and hay or straw .' Jt',"' Thl Itoct 
these markets is held on the last Friday of April. The stock 
:hibited consists chiefly of hogs, or one year old sheep, and as it is 
uch approved of by the store-farmers in this district, it has been, 
and w 11 doubtless, continue to be, well supported. The groun s 
where the above markets are held, are not only most eonven.ently 
situated for the flocks as they descend from tl- mountains ht 
ample space is afforded for their convenience, and for preventing 
them, when properly attended to, from mixing together. 

InU AleLses.There is a convenient and well kept inn at 
Clova, which was erected only a few years ago, and which is much 
frequented by travellers in summer. There are five ale-houses 
hCor achy; to reduce their number might be injurious to he 
supporTof those who keep them ; but it could not fail to be be- 
xieficial to the morals of some of the people. 

Fuel-Peai and turf are commonly used as fuel by the fami les 
i„ fhe northern districts of the parish. Peat is obtained from the 
Issv ounds in the hollows, either on the sides, or towards the 
Tn mit of the mountains. In these hollows, the moss is almost

mi 
an

inexhaustible, and of superior quality. Much time and labour 
are employed by the people in summer, in cutting, drying, and 
conveying the peat to their several dwelling-places, which are ge- 
nerally from two to six miles distant from the mosses. Peat and 
turf are partially used by most of the families in the southern part 
of the parish ; they also use quantities of brushwood, which are 
obtained by purchase, from the woods in the parish and neigh- 
bourhood. Some of the families, in this part of the parish, make 
use of coals chiefly for fuel. The coals are brought either from 
Dundee, or from the depot connected with the railway at Newtyle. 
Several of the farmers have been in the practice, for some years 
past, of bringing home a certain quantity of coals during summer, 
to be used as fuel in winter. This is a wise provision, although, 
in ordinary dry seasons, peat may be safely got home, and makes 
very good fuel ; yet, when the summers are unusually rainy, it is 
not sufficiently dried to be fit for burning, which is the cause of 
no ordinary suffering to those families which depend entirely on 
peat for fuel during the winter. It is highly probable, that coals 
will soon be more generally used for fuel than they have hitherto 
been in the parish.

THE REV. THOMAS IRVINE, MINISTER. 



LuNDiE and Fowlis have long been united into one parish. In 
the former Statistical report, the union is said to have been effect- 
ed by decree of the High Commission in 1618. But as they are 
situated in different counties, as each maintains its church, its 
own school, and its own poor, and as they are in the hands of dif- 
ferent proprietors, and differ much in their situation and aspect, 
It may be advisable, to a certain extent, to describe them sepa- 
rately.

and is bounded on the north by the Sidlaw hills, which divide it 
from Kettins and Newtyle ; on the east, by Auchterhouse ; and 
on the south and west by Fowlis. It is about 3 miles in length, 
and 2 in breadth. On the west, north, and east, it is encompas- 
sed by hills, and the boundary line runs along the ridge, except 
the f.u-m of Ledcrielf, the property of Lord D. G Hal yburtou, 
which lies to the north, and runs down to the valley of Strath- 
more The centre of the parish, however, is not hilly, though it 
swells out into beautiful undulations; and it is diversified by se- 
veral lakes There is still a want of wood, and were this sup- 
phed, the natural features of the district, which are excellent 
lould appear to much more advantage. The cultivated part o 
the parish averages 550 feet above the sea, from which is distant 
sixteen miles, and from the Frith of Tay seven miles. The Sid- 
law hills rise about 300 feet higher, and at their base is a chain 
of four lakes, still of considerable extent, though much lessened by 
draining, from which the Dighty water takes its rise in two streams, 
■hich unite in the parish of Auchterhouse, three miles below. The 
hole of the parish is arable, except the sides of the Sidlaw hdls 
hich are healthy pasture. The climate is still moist, though 
Zy much improved of late by draining. The quantity of rain is 
vather above the average from the proximity of the hUls which a - 
tract the clouds, from the large valley that lies beyond The heat 
comparatively great in summer in reference to the elevation, in 
consequence of reflection from the higher ground, which also 
erves to defend the valley from the currents of air. The winter 
s necessarily cold, but the air is pure, and generally free from 
hoar frost, L th inhabitants are healthy, and several instances 
occur of their attaining great age. 

The four lochs above-mentioned abound in perch, pike, and

various. For the most part, however, it is a deep, free, black soil, 
capable of raising all kinds of crop, though, from the elevation, 
wheat is sown but sparingly. On the higher grounds, it is thin 
and sharp, and in the low grounds large tracts of marshy land, 
formerly a nuisance, and now of great value, have latelv been re- 
claimed by draining. This has had the double effect of adding con- 
siderably to the extent of cultivation, and of improving the surround- 
ing district by its favourable influence on the climate, which is thus 
rendered earlier, and less liable to mildew. Few parishes have made 
more rapid progress than this during the last twenty years, and, 
in point of draining, enclosing, and farm-steadings,— these great 
essentials in agriculture,— it will compare advantageously with dis- 
tricts more favoured by nature. At least 100 acres more will ere 
long be put with profit under the plough. 

Mineralogy.— The district affords nothing particularly attrac- 
tive to the mineralogist. In the lower part, the common gray 
freestone prevails, and the surrounding hills are mostly trap, 
resting od freestone, confirming the idea generally adopted,' 
that they have been thrown up from beneath by the action 
of fire.—The zoologist will find all the animals common to such 
a district, with one addition somewhat rare, namely, a beauti- 
ful and powerful game hawk that frequents the Crag of Lundie, 
and breeds there. This splendid bird, however, is not likely to' 
be long a denizen, as he is sadly out of favour with the game- 
keepers. 

II.— Civil Hi STORY. 

Land-owners.—The whole parish belongs to the ancient family 
of Duncan of Lundie, now the noble family of Camperdown, ex- 
cept one small farm— LedcriefF, lying to the north of the Sidlaw 
hills, which belongs to Lord Douglas Gordon Hallyburton, M P 
for the county, and brother of the present Marquis of Huntly  

Emment Men.- Admiral Lord Viscount Duncan.— The name 
of this eminent individual is familiar to every reader of British 
History, and his connexion with the parish of Lundie is, that his 
parents generally resided at Lundie Castle, in the parish ; that 
during his life he was almost sole proprietor, and that he is buri- 
ed in the family burying place in this church-yard. He was born 
m Dundee on the 14th July 1731. His father was Alexander 
iuncan, Esq. of Lundie. His mother was the heiress of Glen- 

le MrquifrnrtTy''' John Frederick Gordon, third son of

eagles, in Perthshire, Uneally descended from Dancan Earl of 
Lennox, and in consequence of this connection, the valuaWe 
estates of the Gleneagles family now belong to the Earl of Carn- 
perdown. Admiral Dunc-an entered the naval service ""der Cap- 
Lin Robert Haldane, his relative, but was soon removed to the 
hip of Captain, afterwards Lord Keppel, un er whom he ros 
snip ui vdpt , .,f.,in to which rank he was promoted 

nal Ire h wr„„uni:a, unde. Rod„e, at Cape St V,„ee,„, 
a ,d unde, Lerd Howe in 1782, where in the Blenhe™ of n.nety 
tuns he led the larboard divisions of the fleet aga.nst the contbrn- 
S fleets of France and Spain, he was promoted to the rank of 
Rear Idnriral of the Bine in 1787 ; and on the break.ng out of the 
Kevolntionary war in 1794, he was appointed b, Earl Spencer to 
the command of the North Sea fleet. „ . . 

At this period, a large Dutch fleet was collected m the Texel 
for the purpose of co-operating with General Hoche, who was 
w it „te first opportunity of invading Ireland with 40 000 men. 
During the arduous and anxious service of watchmg the mot,ons 
of this'formidable armament, the mutiny of the Nore occurred 
and gave rise to what will long be remembered as -"St nt,- 
cal period of British naval history. Though surrounded wth a 
Teneral spirit of determined insubordination, wh.ch first commen- 
S -:the channel fleet at Spithead Admiral Dnncan hy h.s pe - 
sonal intrepidity, combined with the influence of his character

p n the fleet except the Adamant, adopted the faring btUsu - 
"ce stui expedient of blockading the passage from the Texel w ,h 
Ae two ships, practising, from time to time, the r,-« ofmaking sig- 
nal as f hi fleet had been in sight, instead of lying ingloriously 
nacti" in the power of mutineers. This stratagem could not 
havelasted long but it served hispurposetiUsome ofhismisgmd- 
.d flee ioined him ; and it was his determined and declared reso- 
utiu iv toquithis post,- nor permit the Dutch fleet to pass the 
na ow channel which he occupied, without the -ost determined 

Z\Zle. On one occasion, information was brought to the Ad-

plied, " Then when they have sunk us, my flag will still fly." 
It would be difficult to estimate sufficiently the effect of such 
steady and intrepid conduct on the part of the admiral of the fleet, 
or of the dignified composure with which he bore a misfortune 
such as had never befallen a British Admiral in the sight of an 
enemy. At length the deluded men returned to their duty, and 
not long after, an opportunity was afforded them of wiping off the 
memory of their defection, in the triumphant battle of Cam- 
perdown. 

The Admiral's ship had been eighteen weeks at sea, and 
several others had suffered much from recent gales, and were 
also in need of provisions and repairs. Thus circumstanced, the 
Admiral put into Yarmouth roads on the 3d October 1797, tore- 
fit and revictual, leaving a squadron of observation on the Dutch 
coast. On the 9th, information reached him that the enemy's 
fleet, was at sea. On the 1 1th, at noon, he brought them to close 
action, off Camperdown, as they were seeking to regain the port, 
and of the sixteen sail of the Hne with which the Dutch Admiral 
began the fight, nine, including the Admiral and Vice-Admiral's 
ships, and two frigates, became the reward of a very gallant and 
hard-fought action on a lee shore and an enemy's coast, and with 
a fleet, every ship of which, except two, had lately been in open 
mutiny. 

This important and seasonable victory was duly appreciated by 
the Sovereign and the nation. A patent of Baron of the United 
Kingdom had already been made out, though not signed, for his 
intrepid conduct, and eminent services during the mutiny at the 
Nore ; but his title was now changed to that of Viscount, and he 
received the thanks of both Houses of Parliament, and presents 
and addresses from many places, amongst others the freedom of 
the city of London, and a sword of two hundred guineas value 
and, with expressed reference to this victory, his son was raised to 
the rank of Earl, under the title of Camperdown, at the corona- 
tion of William IV., who was an intimate acquaintance and great 
admirer of Admiral Lord Duncan. 

After the victory he survived nearly seven years, and died sud- 
denly on the 4th August 1804, at Cornhill, on his way to Scot- 
land. His remains are interred in this churchyard, in the family 
burying-plaoe, and the spot is, at his own request, marked by a 
plain marble slab, bearing this inscription, written by himself, 

Adam, first Viscount Duncan, Admiral of the White Squadron

of his Majesty King George the Third's fleet, born 14tli July 
1731, and died 4th August 1804." His Lordship married Hen- ' 
rietta, dau-hter of the Lord President Dundas, by whom he had a 
large family, and his estates and honours are inherited by his son, 
Robert, the present Earl of Camperdown, who, as already men- 
tioned, is almost sole proprietor of the parish, under whose judi- 
cious management it is rapidly increasing in value and beauty 

In a handsome mausoleum adjoining the church are also inter- 
red Sir William Duncan, Bart., M. D., a cadet of the Lundie fa- 
milY and Lady Mary Tufton, daughter of Sackville, Earl of 
Thanet, his wife. Sir William was bred a physician, and prac- 
tised for some time in London, where he captivated the affections 
of the lady who afterwards became his wife. Soo" er their 
marriage, they went to the East Indies, where Sir William realiz- 
ed a large fortune, with which he returned to London and lived in 
great sptendour, and enjoyed the honorary distinction of Physician 
to the King. On his death, which occurred in « 789, Lady 
Moiy caused the mausoleum to be built for him here and left 
Z Z her own remains being laid beside her husband, she 
survived him several years, but they left no family.

The pari;h of Fowlis, sometimes called Fowlis Easter, to distin-

of the Brae of he Carse of Gowrie, and sloping gently downward

and what remains of the Castle of Fowlis, their former residence, 
is now in a ruinous state, and inhabited by a few families of the 
poorest description. 

The parish contains 2348 acres, of which 1493 are arable, 160 
wood, 260 good pasture, 264 moorland, the rest gardens, roads, 
&amp;c. It is better supplied with hedge-row trees than Lundie, 
there is still a want of wood, though the land is admirably adapted 
for the growth of it, in proof of which it may be mentioned, that, 
a few years ago, four ash trees that stood near the old castle, sold 
by public sale for more than L.80. 

There is only one hill in the parish, the Blacklaw, and that 
scarcely worth mentioning for its elevation, though it commands 
a beautiful and very extensive prospect. 

Formerly, there was a lake in the upper part of the parish, of 
considerable extent, called the Piper dam, from a traditionary story 
that a piper was drowned in it. But it was drained for the sake 
of marl more than sixty years ago, and nearly all that remains of 
it is now a reedy marsh, famous for the quantity of wild water fowl 
that frequent it at all seasons of the year, more especially in the 
winter. It still, however, serves as a reservoir for regulating the 
supply of water for a meal-mill, a wool-mill, and several thrashing- 
mills on the small stream that issues from it, and falls into the 
Frith of Tay at Invergowrie. 

Since the prices of grain have so much declined, a considerable 
quantity of land formerly under the plough has been thrown into 
grass, and, under present circumstances, there is little prospect of 
Its bemg taken up, as it affords profitable pasturage, being well 
watered and enclosed. 

The climate of Fowlis is excellent. The quantity of rain is ra- 
ther below the average, owing to the showers from the west beino- 
attracted from it by the Sidlaw hills on the north, and the Frith" 
of Tay on the south. The district is very healthy, and presents 
many mstances of persons attaining a great age. The whole pa 
rish abounds with gray freestone of the very best quality for every 
purpose, but affords few other mineralogical specimens. The den 
of Fowhs, a beautiful and romantic wooded ravine stretchino- 
southwards, a mile from the church, is a favourite resort of bo- 
tanists, not that it is known to afford any specimens nowhere else 
to be found, but because it presents many that are rather rare in 
great perfection ; and affords a greater variety than is usually found 
in so limited a spot.

We shall now notice the two districts of the parish jointly. 
III. — Population. 

The population of the united parish, though wholly agricultu- 
ral, has fluctuated considerably, both in its amount, and in the 
lative proportions of the districts.

LUNDIE AND FOWLIS, 463 

a while, has ftillen off. But both the one and the other can 
be satisfactorily accounted for. Both districts of the parish are 
wholly agricultural, and the fluctuation in the population depends 
on the greater or smaller number employed on the cultivation of 
the soil. Now Fowlis was one of those places where agricultural 
improvements took place at an early period, and it was long what 
is termed a grain district, requiring, of course, at all seasons of 
the year, many labourers. Of late the fall in the price of grain, 
and the comparative increase in the price of cattle, have caused a 
change in the mode of management, and a much greater propor- 
tion of grass, and thus considerably fewer hands work the farms, 
and the labourers, no longer employed, have removed elsewhere,' 
and hence the decrease. 

In Lundie, again, from the extensive existence of liferent leases 
and other causes at an earlier period, improvement was late iri 
commencmg. Recently, it has gone on with much spirit ;-a great 
demand has existed for manual labour, and hence the population 
has mcreased. 

Like most districts of Scotland, where the population is wholly 
agricultural, the people are quiet, orderly, and religious, generally 
contented with their situation and circumstances, which are steadi'- 
ly improving, and happily free to a great extent from the spirit of 
discontent, and the habits of low debauchery which threaten to 
uproot society in most of our large towns and manufacturino- vil- 
lages. In many instances the inhabitants show .a strong attach- 
ment to the place ; and some families, both of farmers and cot-

of the elevation. Oats and barley thrive well; and both districts 
yield the most abundant green crops, which are largely cultivated 
to the entire exclusion of summer fallow, which is now scarcely 
seen. There is, however, on account of the elevation of Lundie, 
a difference of about six days in the time of commencing harvest. 
Formerly it was much more; but drainage, improved general farm- 
ing, and better seed have done much to lessen it. 

The usual rotation of cropping is what is called fives, that is, 
oats, green crop, wheat, barley, or oats, according to circumstan- 
ces, and two years grass, the first year partly cut for hay. 

It has been already stated, that the parish is wholly agricultu- 
ral, and of course it includes only the tradesmen necessary for the 
service of the inhabitants. Of these it has a fair supply. Nor is 
it necessary to make an exception of the very few who act as la- 
bourers during the summer, and employ the winter in weaving for 
the Dundee manufacturers ; or of the females, who have a loom in 
their cottage, to which they betake themselves when out-door 
labour is scarce. This is on so limited a scale, that it is not 
worthy of farther notice. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
There is no market-town, and not even a village in the parish. 
The nearest is Cupar- Angus, distant six miles. But Dundee, 
though distant from Lundie nine miles, and from Fowlis six miles,' 
IS the market-town, both for buying and selling; and for eithei' 
purpose It IS one of the best in the kingdom. The Dundee and 
Cupar- Angus turnpike intersects the parish, and affords an excel- 
lent communication with both towns ; and Fowlis is approached 
on the south by the Carse of Gowrie turnpike, from which it is 
a little more than a mile distant. The parish roads are deserving 
of no commendation. They are by far too numerous, especially 
m Lundie, and the lines not well chosen; but Lord Camperdown 
and his tenants have for some years subscribed liberally for their 
improvement, and they will soon be in a better condition. No- 
ttung, however, has yet been done to supply the want of a post- 
ottice. Dundee is the post-town, and a distance of nine miles is 
a great inconvenience. 

Ecclesiastical Stofe-Contrary to the custom in lowland, and 
more especially, in small parishes, there are two churches in this 
each very conveniently situated for the district of the parish where 
U stands, and from which it takes its name, but neither of them 
convenient for serving the whole parish. They are distant from 
one another four miles, and in them the incumbent preaches

very comfortable church, capable of being made to accommodate 
between 300 and 400. 

The manse, which is at Lundie, was built in 1797, and is small 
and inconvenient. An excellent set of offices was built in 1830. The 
glebe contains six acres of good land. The teinds are valued and 
exhausted ; and the stipend, L.200, is all paid in money. The Earl 
of Camperdown is sole patron. There are very few Dissenters in the 
parish, — not more than 30 when the census was taken last winter ; 
and the attendance at church is very good, especially when the 
distance to be travelled once a fortnight by a considerable propor- 
tion is taken into account. The average number of communicants, 
280; and in all extraordinary collections, whether for the Dundee 
Infirmary or for the schemes of Christian philanthropy now con- 
ducted by the General Assembly, the parish is noted for its libe- 
rality. These annual collections seldom fall under L.9, and often 
exceed it. 

Education. — There are two public schools in the parish, one at 
Lundie and another at Fowhs, at which all the ordinary branches 
of education are taught, each having a good dwelling-house and 
school-house, and a rood of land, with L. 30 of salary, and the 
school-fees may average L. 25 a-year more. The schools are 
duly prized and well attended ; and, except one adult, who cannot 
read, and will not learn, it is not known that any are uneducated; 
nor are there any so situated that they cannot profit by the means 
of education. There are also two Sabbath-schools in the parish, 
which are very well attended, not only by mere children, but by 
young persons, even years after they have become communicants. 
The means of education are at present as complete as there is 
reason to expect in a parish of this description, and the heritors 
show every disposition to encourage it. Prizes are given at both 
schools at the annual examination ; and in addition to the usual 
ones, a splendid quarto Bible is given to the best male and the 
best female scholar at the school of Lundie. 

Library.— There is a subscription library in Fowlis, of which 
the schoolmaster has the charge, containing 600 volumes, tolerably 
well chosen. The subscribers are not restricted to the parish. 
Perhaps nearly the half of them belong to the neighbouring pa- 
rishes. It is making considerable progress, though the subscrip- 

inans nnw' ''"" as written, tins church has been beautifully fitted up with-

tion is so low as 2s. a-year. The present number of subscribers 

is 50. , 11 • 

Poor— There is no assessment for the poor, the collections m 
the church and mortcloth dues, with a voluntary contribution from 
the heritors, sufficing. The church collections average about 
L. 30, pretty equally divided between the two districts of the 
parish; and the number of poor receiving constant aliment fluc- 
tuates between three and four in each. Besides these how- 
ever, several receive occasional relief. The pittance that is 
given is thankfully received ; and, happdy, the good old Scottish 
feehn.. of independence still lingers here, as in most agricultural 
districts at a distance from towns or manufacturing villages. 

Fairs -There are two fairs in Lundie for the sale of stock, one 
in June, the other in August. They are not numerously attend- 
ed, and do not seem to be on the increase. There is one ale- 
house in the parish at Lundie ; and the toll-keeper at Lundie toll 
generally has a license. The toll-house is sometimes a nuisance. 
Fortunately, the other is not much frequented. 

ir„,Z._Coal is the sole fuel, generally brought from Dundee. 
About a fourth part of the quantity consumed is Scotch coa im- 
ported from the south coast of Fife, the rest from Newcastle or 
Sunderland. The expense is of course considerable, ihe tar- 
mers drive their own and their cottars, and thus to the poor the 
expense of carriage is saved. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
It is stated in the former statistical notice, as well as in the 
present, that Fowlis was one of the V. j X; 
cultural improvements, and therefore the change is not so great 
th re as in Lundie, where they were late in being introduced. 
The produce of the latter, however, has at least been trip ed with- 
al the' last forty years. The tenantry are active intelligent, 
industrious, and' thriving ; sober, church-going, and warmly a 
tached to the National Church. The comforts eioyed by he 
loTer classes are steadily increasing; and of the parish generally, 
it may be said that it is in a highly prosperous condition.

PRESBYTERY OF ARBROATH, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. GEOEGE AllKLAY, MINISTER. 



I Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, 8fc. — No satisfactory account can be given 
of the name Guthrie. It is the name of the family in which is 
vested the patronage of the parish, and which has been a name of 
distinction in Scotland as far back as the records of the country 
extend. The parish consists of two portions, the one of which 
Kirkbuddo is separated from the other where the parish church 
is situated by an interval of not less than seven miles. 

It appears from the records of the Abbey of Arbroath, that 
the kirk of Guthrie had been a chapel belonging to the abbey. 
It was purchased from the abbey by Sir David Guthrie, the an- 
cestor of the present patron of the parish, who founded and en- 
dowed a collegiate church at Guthrie, for a provost and three 
prebends. This deed of foundation was confirmed by a bull from 
Pope Sextus IV. of date 14th June 1479. To this foundation at 
Guthrie, Kirbuddo or Carbuddo was attached as a rectory. The 
rectory has been incorporated with Guthrie as an integral part of 
the same parish, since the Reformation. 

The northern portion of the parish, in which the church stands, 
IS bounded on the south by the parishes of Kirkden and Resco- 
bie; on the west, by the parishes of Rescobie and Aberlemno; 
on the north, by the parish of Aberlemno ; and on the east, by the 
parish of Kinnell. The southern, or Carbuddo portion, is bound- 
ed, on the north, by the parish of Dunnichen ; on the west, by 
that of Inverarity; on the south, by the parishes of Inverarity 
and Monikie ; and on the east, by the parish of Carmylie. 

Topographical Appearance and Soil—The appearance of the 
northern portion of the parish somewhat resembles the ridge on 
■which the old town of Edinburgh stands, with the castle rock at 
the western extremity. Guthrie Hill, a round-backed mass of

trap, stands at the western boundary, and the ground declines 
from this in a ridge to the eastward, which slopes down to the 
north and south into irregularly defined valleys. A small stream 
called the Lunan, flows through the valley on the south, and 
forms the boundary line of the parish in that du-ection. The 
land to the south of the ridge above referred to is generally of 
good quality, being chiefly a black loam, underneath which is a 
thick stratum of clay, which is strongly retentive of water. i he 
soil, it is believed, might be rendered much more productive by 
draining, which is greatly needed ; and also the subsoil-plough, 
invented by Mr Smith of Deanston, by means of which, in tins 
neighbourhood, very beneficial results have been produced, i he 
remainder of the land, in this northern division, is of inferior qua- 
lity • almost all of it is much in need of draining ; and, in regard 
to a considerable portion, perhaps a fourth part of it, such is the 
inherent poverty of the soil, that a great outlay of capital and la- 
bour must take place before it could be rendered moderately pro- 
ductive ; and even then, the returns would be no adequate reward 
for the pains bestowed. The southern, or Carbuddo portion of 
the parish is generally level, with the exception of the locality 
on which the mansion-house of Carbuddo is placed, which is 
slightly elevated above the surrounding land. The remarks made 
as to the qualities of the soil, in the northern division of the pa- 
rish, are generally applicable to this, the southern portion ot it ; 
with this modification, that the quantity of good land is consider- 
ably less than in the Guthrie portion of the parish ; and the need 
for draining, and agricultural improvements generally, is much 
greater. Around Guthrie Castle, particularly, and also at Kirk- 
buddo House, there is much wood ; a considerable portion ot 
which is old and full-grown. In both divisions of the pansh ako 
there are plantations and stripes of thrivmg timber, which tend 
to beautify and enliven the face of the country. 

II. — Civil History. 
Land.owners.--i:\o whole parish, which consists of about sis 
square miles, whereof nearly four belong to the Guthrie or north- 
ern portion, is divided among three proprietors v.z. John Guthrie,

Parochial Registers. — These extend back to the beginning of 
the seventeenth century ; but there are many gaps in the records, 
and nothing like a continued narrative of parochial matters from 
the above date to the present. The portions that do exist, espe- 
cially those towards the beginning, are very explicit and full, and, 
in many cases, very quaint and interesting. 

Antiquities. — Guthrie Castle, one of the residences of the chief 
of the family of that name, stands within a quarter of a mile of 
the parish church, and is of considerable antiquity. Sir David 
Guthrie, already mentioned, obtained warrant under the Great 
Seal to build this castle in 1468. It is still in great preservation, 
and must formerly, when surrounded by water, have been a place of 
considerable strength. Its bold massive tower, surmounted by cas- 
tellated ornaments, shooting up into the sky from amid the umbra- 
geous woods, conveys a strong impression of beauty and grandeur. 
It is worthy of remark, that, in 1299, when Sir William Wallace 
had resigned the guardianship of Scotland, and retired to France, 
the northern lairds of Scotland sent Squire Guthrie to request his 
return, in order to assist in opposing the English ; and that, from 
that remote period down to the present time, the domain of Guthrie 
has been transmitted in the same name, unfettered by any deed 
of entail. It is believed that the family of Guthrie of Guthrie is 
the most ancient of the county of Angus. It is matter of un- 
doubted fact, that they were men of rank and property long before 
the time of James II. of Scotland, and that many of the house 
were distinguished by their enterprise and valour. Sir Alexander 
Guthne, with one of his sons and three brothers-in-law, fell at 
riodden Field. 

There is, in the southern division of the parish, a Roman camp. 
1 his camp IS about five miles south-east from Forfar. It is one 
of the most entire of any of the Roman temporary camps that 
have been discovered. It is more narrow and rV longe'r tht 
the small camps usually are, being about 2280 feet by 1080 

111' T}'""' f"'' " situated on the' 

highest ground, whence all the rest of the camp is seen. Thi.

472 FORFARSHIRE. 

About three years ago, there were found, at the south-east 
corner of the northern division of the parish, on the banks of the 
Lunan, two utensils of earthenware; one shaped somewhat m the 
form of a kettle ; the other, a rude resemblance of a Roman am- 
phora. Both, unfortunately, were broken in bemg dug up from 
a gravel pit, where they were deposited about three or four feet 
below the surface. They bore no marks or inscription by which 
their age could be traced. It seems sufficiently probable that 
thev had been left in the course of the movements, either ot the 
Roman or of the Danish armies ; the course of both of which lay 
in this direction. But it would be useless to prosecute conjecture 
farther, in the absence of all light and evidence whereby to guide it. 

There is one meal-mill in the parish, but no mills of any other 
description, nor manufactories of any kind. The largest cluster 
of houses in the parish is the Kirktown, containing in a 1 nine a- 
milies. Among these there are, a baker, a brewer, a blacksmith, 
a shoemaker, and a merchant, by which designation is meant one 
■ho unites in his own person the character of grocer, clotlrier 
hatter, haberdasher, toyman, ironmonger, druggist, &amp;c. ihe 
Kirktown of Guthrie thus supplies all the necessaries, and not a 
few of the luxuries of life, to the neighbourhood for several miles 
around. 

III. — Population. 

In 1801, the population amounted to 556 

The population of late has been rather on the decrease, owing 
chiefly to the uniting of farms, and also in part to the removal of 
some families to manufacturing districts in quest of employment.

risli generally is draining : attention has been roused to the im- 
portance of this; and elforts are used to introduce it in good 
earnest. The value of the subsoil plough, also, it is hoped, will 
be generally appreciated, and its use become common. It seems 
to be the opinion of those most competent to judge of this matter, 
that its adoption would loosen the retentive subsoil which so ge- 
nerally prevails throughout the whole parish, and permit the water 
to escape downwards. With the modification now explained, 
husbandry is conducted skilfully and industriously ; and though a 
niggardly and ungrateful soil, and, to some extent, an ungenial 
climate, in many cases but ill requite the labours of the husband- 
man ; yet continued industry and perseverance are, in many in- 
stances, well rewarded. The leases are generally of fourteen or 
nineteen years' duration. The farm-houses and offices are gene- 
rally convenient. There is great want, however, of good fences. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town, — Means of Communication. — As already stated, 
the parish contains neither town nor village. The nearest post- 
town is Forfar, distant seven miles from the church ; but the town 
with which the chief communication takes place, is Arbroath, 
which is distant eight miles. The Arbroath and Forfar turnpike 
road, and the railway between these two towns, both pass along 
within a quarter of a mile from the parish church. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church is situated within about 100 
yards of the centre of the southern boundary of the northern di- 
vision of the parish. Its situation is convenient enough for this 
section of the parish, though sadly otherwise for the other division. 
The church and manse are very pleasantly situated, being on the 
verge of a declivity, sloping down into the valley through which 
the small stream, the Lunan, already mentioned, prettily winds 
Its course. The locality, indeed, where the church and manse 
stand, is the most eligible for natural beauty and prospect of any 
between Forfar and Arbroath. The church is a plain building, 
but very substantial and comfortable. It was erected in 1826: 
It IS capable of accommodating 306, at the legal allowance of 
eighteen inches to each sitter. 

The manse received a large addition about fourteen years affo, 
and IS in good repair. 

There are about five acres of glebe, besides three acres of 
moorland, in name of grass-glebe. The stipend is one of the 
small livings," receiving an augmentation from Government. 



474 FOFFARSIIIRH. 

The southern or Carbuddo division of the parish labours under 
great disadvantages in respect of church accommodation,-the 
average distances of that part of the parish being e.ght mi es from 
the parish church. There is no place of worship in that ocahty, 
nor has there been for very many years. It is hoped that this ' 
evil may soon be so far remedied, by the erection of a school of such 
a form as to be easily convertible into a preaching station In the 
meantime, with the view of doing something for the supply of Di- 
vine ordinances to this section of the parish, it is the practice ex- 
cept during the winter months, to preach there in a small school- 
house, at In interval of two or three weeks, besides the usual mi- 
nisterial visitations among the different famihes. It may be sta ed 
that, though the families in this section of the parish be far from 
thei; parish church, they are not farther, in any case, than three 
miles from some of the contiguous parish churches. 

With the exception of twelve persons, the whole population of 
the parish belongs to the Established Church ; and Divine service 
is generally well attended. The average number of communicants I 
for some years past has been about 235. , i . rn

THE REV. JAMES FLOWERDEW, MINISTER. 



• — Topography and Natural History. 

Boundaries, §-c.— These united parishes are bounded on the 
east and south, by Glammis; on the south-west, by Newtyle ; 
and, on the west and north, by Meigle and Airly. They are 
about 4 miles long and 3 broad, and contain an area of 8 square 
miles. The Deane forms the northern boundary of Eassie. This 
stream, as its name is said to import, is of considerable depth, and 
has a scarcely perceptible current. On the south side, it is strongly 
embanked ; but, owing to the sudden and frequent bends in its 
course, it often, in winter, breaks through the embankment and 
inundates the neighbouring fields. 

Mineralogy and Botamj.—The mineralogy and botany of these 
parishes are so similar to those of the adjoining parish of Glam 
mis, that any description of them would only be a repetition of 
the observations of the scientific gentleman who furnished the mi- 
neralogical and botanical portion of the account of that parish 
No specimens, however, of the fossil and organic remains, thai 
have been found in it at various times, have ever been discovered 
m this parish. The rocks are of the same old sandstone forma- 
tion ; the colours being gray and brownish-red. The dip of the 
beds IS to the north-west ; and the character of the rocks varies from 
conglomerate, through the usual gradations, down to calmstone

II._CiviL History. 
Antintdties.- Shoui a mile from the old church of Eassie there 
is a large circular mound, on which the farm-house of Castle 

Nairne is built. . 

The ground, to a considerable extent around, is quite flat, bi- 
milar remains of antiquity are found in various parts not only o. 
Scotland, but England and Ireland, and "f 
upon them by a recent and very curious book entitled the Doc- 
tHne of the Deluge," by the Rev. Vernon Harcourt, son of the 
Archbishop of York. He connects them with that great fact 
o" ture history, and calls them " Memorials of Ark.te 
Worship " He observes, " These Arkite memorials abound 
aloncr the Grampians, for the Arkite worship clung most te- 
naciously to islands and mountains." To this ongm he traces, 
and upon this principle he explains, other antiquities o the 
country Those curious cells under ground, of which there 
a e specimens in the parish of Tealing and elsewhere and which 
are generally supposed to be Pictish, he pronounces to be Ar- 
k te cells for penance and purification." They were so sma 1

pillars. Of all the antiquities of a neighbourhood monumental 
obelisks are perhaps the most interesting. They are histories in 
stone of the age in which they were erected. They tell little, in- 
deed, and that little obscurely, of the usages, the events, and the 
men of those distant times. But they tell us nearly all we yet 
know, or perhaps ever shall. Rising as many of them did long 
antecedent to the dawn of authentic history, they were almost an- 
tiquities to the earliest annalists, who, if theynotice them at all, 
speak of them as relics of a far older time than their own. Many 
of them have already disappeared. " Mors etiam saxis nomini- 
busque venit." Those that still stand are often the only surviving 
records of ages and generations long since passed away. They 
were designed by each successive age that left them behind it to 
transmit its memory and usages to posterity. The old name of a 
monumental pillar perhaps indicates its use. It was " Amad," sig- 
nifying in Hebrew the lips or words of the people  the people of 
former generations thus speaking to those who are to come after 
them. To this origin may be traced many of the popular tradi 
tions connected with those remarkable stones, termed " speaking- 
stones." 

In Pembrokeshire there is one called Lich Lavar {lapis lo- 
quax, the tradition being that it called out when a dead body was 
placed upon it. In the history of Waterford there is the account 
of another, so called from having contradicted a person who swore 
falsely by it,— the Irish name signifying a speaking-stone. Com- 
mon tradition regards many of them as once animated beings. Thus 
Stonehenge is called the Dance of the Giants; and Staunton 
Drew, in Somersetshire, the « Weddings." These are the fancies 
of popular superstition. But there is perhaps a soberer and truer 
interpretation of those sculptured records. They furnish us with 
notices of antiquity that are not to be found in the written annals of 
our country. The beautiful execution of the devices and characters 
engraven on them attest the skill to which the people had already 
attamed m the difficult art of sculpturing stone ; and the characters 
still stand out as bold and clear as when they first came from the 
hands of the sculptor. The obelisks south of the Frith of Forth 
are not indeed of this description ; but every where to the north 
of It the obelisks are covered with emblematical devices ; and those 
of the northern counties especially are remarkable for their ela 
borate and exquisite workmanship. Now our oldest annals tell us 
only of turbulent times and barbarous tribes. They could neither 



47S FORFARSHIRE. 

have executed nor even understood the beautiful sculpture on 
those pillars. The age, whatever it was, that produced them, 
must have been one of comparative civilization and peace. They 
are the works of men and times of which there is no other existing 
record; and thus a strong light is thrown upon remote antiquity 
by these carved obelisks ; and from them alone we gather this im- 
portant fact in the history of our race, that, at remoter periods 
than the historian has been able to reach, civilized communities 
already existed. 

It has been supposed that there is some unaccountable atlinity 
between the sculpture of these monuments and Egyptian symbols. 
In many of them the serpent is a very conspicuous figure; and of 
every superstition in every age of the world, serpent worship ap- 
pears to have formed a part. In the magic of Chaldea, m the 
philosophy of Egypt, in the Brahmanism of Hindostan, and in the 
Druidism of Britain, it is distinctly to be traced. This universa- 
lity of serpent worship can be explained only by supposing it to 
have one common origin everywhere, and that it is to be found in 
the Scripture history of the fall of man. It is one of those frag- 
ments of early revelation that have been broken off from the sys- 
tem of which they form a part, and carried down the streana of 
time after their object and purpose had been forgotten. The 
serpent in Paradise is the origin of serpent-worship everywhere; 
and thus an idolatrous symbol on an ancient obelisk becomes an 
argument at once for the antiquity and truth of the Old Testa- 
ment Scriptures. It is gratifying to find thus enlisted in the cause 
of Christianity the memorials of those very superstitions which 
were at one time the greatest barriers to its progress, and the most 
formidable rivals to its claim upon the affection and veneration of 
former ages. 

Another striking feature in the sculpture of these stones is t be 
frequent representation of hunting scenes. The chase was the 
national amusement of Scotland from a very remote period; and 
in such estimation was it held by the nobility and gentry, that, m 
the eleventh century, by the forest laws of Canute the Great, no 
person under the rank of a gentleman was allowed to keep a grey- 
hound It is in commemoration of this favourite pastime that the 
figures of deer-hounds and wolf-dogs are so prominently represent- 
ed on these old obelisks. But the most remarkable figure on these 
sculptured stones is that of the cross. It was perhaps intended o 
commemorate the introduction of Christianity mto Caledonia, and 



EASSIE AND NEVAY. 4/9 

was probably borrowed from the missals of those missionaries from 
Rome who first brought the religion of the cross to its benighted 
inhabitants. But the sculpture of the stone in this parish is re- 
markable for the union of Pagan and Christian symbols. An or- 
namental cross is blended with the symbols and ceremonies of an- 
cient superstition. In looking back to the dawn of religion in a 
country, it is difficult to mark with precision the line where the 
darkness of mythology ends and the light of revelation begins. 
But the union of idolatrous and evangelical symbols would indi- 
cate, that Scotland was at the time passing from superstition to 
Christianity. In that state of transition, the people had partially 
abjured the one and partially embraced the other; and they have 
recorded their lingering attachment to the superstition of their fa- 
thers, by blending on these monuments its still sacred symbols 
with those of the new faith j and thus we have an interesting re- 
cord of the expiring struggle between the superstition of the na- 
tive and the religion of the missionary. 

At what time, and by what people, were these monuments 
erected  With regard to the first of these questions, it would be 
mere conjecture to fix the date precisely to a century, as it must ever 
be with all those " undated relics whose birth tradition notes not." 
But they bear internal evidence of very high antiquity. Allusion 
has already been made to the elaborate sculpture with which they 
are ornamented, carrying us back to times of which there is no 
other existmg and authentic record. The union also of Pagan 
and Christian symbols furnishes a clue to guide us to the period 
of their erection. The Romans abandoned Britain early in the 
fifth century. The inhabitants of the south of Scotland were 
converted to Christianity about this period, but the northern pro- 
vmces had not embraced it till near the close of the sixth It 
must therefore have been at some period subsequent to this that 
the pillars with crosses and other Christian symbols engraven on 
them, were erected. The Pictish period of Scottish history is 
from 414 to 84.3; and although Pinkerton is disposed to assign 
the period from 843 to 1056 for engraven obelisks, still there is 
strong probability that they were executed some lime between the 
seventh and the ninth century, and before the close of the Pictish 
period. 

With regard to the second question, by " what people they 
were erected "-it is supposed by some that they are Danish"

the great-grandson of Kenneth IV., ascended the throne of Scot- 
land, and fell in battle at Eassie, in 1057, defending his claim 
against Malcolm, Duncan's eldest son. But this Eassie is in 
Strathbogie, and the similarity of the name accounts for the tra- 
dition referred to. Whether this pillar tells a national or domes- 
tic tale, — whether it marks a grave or commemorates a battle, — 
whether it represents a usage of the country, or a rite in religion', 
are points on which different opinions will still continue to be 
formed. 

Land-owners. — They are, the Right Honourable Lord Wharn- 
cliflFe ; David Nairne, Esq. of Drumkilbo ; the Trustees of the late 
Lord Strathmore; James L'Aray, Esq. of Dunkenny ; and Colin 
Symers, Esq. of Eassie. The two largest proprietors are Lord 
Wharncliffe and Mr Nairne. His Lordship possesses the whole 
parish of Nevay. The extent of cultivated land in it is upwards of 
1400 imperial acres; of uncultivated, including 33 acres of 
woods, there are about 540 acres. The arable land on the es- 
tate of Mr Nairne in this parish extends to between 700 or 800 
acres. The whole: pasture land does not exceed 35 acres; the 
plantations on both estates may measure about 235 acres, princi- 
pally of larch and Scotch fir, of no great age, and as yet of little 
value. There is no resident heritor. 

HI. — Population. 
The extent of the population has varied little for a century past 
It was, in 1721, 657; in 1821, 664; and, according to the last 
census, it was 732. The increase in 1841 is rather apparent than 
real, for the difference was owing to the strangers that happened 
to be at work at the time the census was taken. The plan adopt- 
ed of including in the population list of a parish all who slept 
in the parish on the night preceding the day on which the names 
were taken up, while it may give accurately the whole population of 
the country, gives in some instances more, and in others less, than

want of comfort and cleanliness, is ruinous to the domestic habits

• tween Scotland and Norway. The bothy system prevails there as 
well as here, but on how different a footing will appear from the 
followmg extract from Mr Laing's recent work on Norway: 
« There is a bothy here, as in Scotland, called a  Bortstue,'— a se-

dwelhng-houses of many respectable formers in Aberdeenshire and

lighted room, with four windows, a good stove or fire-place a 
wooden floor, with benches, chairs, and a table. At the end is a 
kitchen, m which their victuals are cooked by a servant, whose

PKKSJBYTERY OF DUNDEE, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. JAMES MILLER, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name.— It is supposed that the name Monikie is Gaelic, and 
composed of Monah, signifying an upland moss or moor, and Ceo, 
mist or fog, and so descriptive of the higher district of the parish, 
where the church and manse are situated. 

Extent, The greatest extent of the parish from north-west 
to south-east is about 7 miles, and its breadth something more 
than 5. It is bounded on the south by the parishes of Barry and Mo- 
mfieth ; on the vrest, by Murroes and Inverarity ; on the north, by 
Guthrie and Carmylie ; and on the east by Pan bride. Two ranges 
of hdls, crossing the parish from east to west, divide it into three 
districts, very different as to soil and climate. The first district, 
which lies to the south of the Downie hills, and slopes towards the 
estuary of the river Tay, is composed of a rich and productive 
soil lying upon gravel, or scurdy rock; and yields early crops of all 
kinds, and especially of wheat and barley. The middle district 

chiefly of thm black loam on a bed of cold, wet till, very difficult 
to cultivate in season, and producing inferior crops of everything 

thel T V ""t d l-t 800 feet above the level of 
the sea, hechmateofthis district is cold and damp during a great 
par of the year. The third district, at an elevation of abouf 400 
tee , forms a swampy and moorish tract, extending along the 

r"' '" '"-bited, aifd cultivated 
only in a very few places, and to very little advantage. 

a beSl'L .•'P'' °f he Downie hills is composed of 

Lki ro .'"•"• dP building or 

making roads. 1 he range terminates on the west, in a quarry of ex

estate of Kinblethmont, extends in a southerly direction, by Car- 
mvlie, Smithfield, Wellbank, and Duntrune. Beautiful speci- 
mens of agate, jasper, and spar, the produce of the trap, are found 
on the Downie hills, the tops of which are also ornamented with 

a great variety of plants.

extremity of the parish, called the Hair Cairn, similar to others 
.■hich are supposed to have been raised to commemorate some 
hostile encounLr in former times. An ornamented stone pi a

may be stated al 4448. But what may be the annual produce, or 
value of the produce, either on an average, or in any given year, 
it would be very difficult to determine with any degree of accu- 
racy. About 500 acres are under wood, chiefly fir, but not 
thriving; and probably more than 1000 acres are in a state fit 
for being planted with advantage, but ought not to be attempted 
to be cultivated, especially in the present times. The best land 
in this parish is held by industrious and opulent tenants, on life- 
rent leases, and at very low rents, and the very liberal proprietor, 
Lord Panmure, generally relets these farms, as they fall to the re- 
spectable sons of the former tenants, on very moderate terms. 
The inferior land of the parish is generally let on twenty-one year 
leases, at a rent of from 5s. to L. 1 per acre. The tenantry, in 
general, are industrious and enterprising ; and of late years have 
considerably improved both their farms and their fortunes, by fol- 
lowing extensively the dairy system, and selling the milk and but- 
ter in the Dundee market. The great demand for potatoes from 
the same quarter has encouraged the farmers in this district to 
cultivate this crop more extensively than usual. 

v.— Pa ROCHIAL Economy. 
Ecclesiastical State. — The church is inconveniently situated 
within half a mile of the eastern boundary of the parish ; built in 
1812, and seated to hold about 900 persons. It is in good re- 
pair, and comfortable, and generally well filled in ordinary wea- 
ther. The average number of communicants may be taken at 
600. The manse was built in 1794, and repaired and enlarged 
in 1827. It is a good house. The glebe consists of 6 acres of 
excellent land; and the stipend of 16 chalders of victual, half 
meal and half barley, and payable at the highest fiar's prices of 
the county. 

There has been in the south-west corner of this parish for many 
years a Dissenting chapel, belonging to the United Associate Sy- 
nod of Seceders, and supported by a congregation collected chiefly 
from the outskirts of this, and of the neighbouring parishes. The 
mmister's nominal salary is about L.80, paid partly by the seat 
rents, and partly by the contributions of the members of the con- 
gregation. The members of the Established Church and the 
Dissenters have cordially united for several years in supporting a 
iible and Missionary Society, which distributes annually about 
L.20 for the propagation of the Gospel at home and abroad. 

Education,-.ThQXQ are three schools in the parish, in which 



488 



FORFAUSIIIUE. 



the ordinary branches of education are well tauglit; and attended, 
respectively, by an average of 60, 50, and 40 scholars during the • 
winter. The parochial schoolmaster has the maximum salary, and 
the usual legal accommodations. The school-fees and other emo- 
laments may amount to about L.30, making his income nearly 
L.65 a year, on an average. One of the other teachers has a 
small endowment. 

The people are not only alive to the benefits of education for 
their children, but have established three public libraries in the 
parish for their own improvement. Their general character may 
be described as sober, industrious, intelligent, and regular in at- 
tending the ordinances of religion, A lawsuit among them is a 
thing scarcely ever heard of. 

Poor.— The average number of persons receiving parochial aid 
may be reckoned at between 12 and 15, according to the state of 
trade and employment. They are supported at a yearly expense 
of somewhat more than L.80, arising from the ordinary sources of 
collections, seat-rents, &amp;c. There are besides, at present, two 
lunatic paupers in the Dundee Asylum, who are mamtamed by the 
heritors assessing themselves for that purpose. The poor, m ge- 
neral, are well attended to, and no begging is allowed in the parish. 
It is of a piece with Lord Panmure's ordinary generous attention 
to the interests of his tenantry, that no person holding land of 
him is allowed to become a burden on the poor's funds. His Lord- 
ship's tenants have testified their grateful approbation of hiskmd- 
ness and generosity as a landlord, by erecting the « live and let 
live" testimonial on the hill of Cambustane, ornamenting the dis- 
trict, and publishing to at least six counties, their own comfort as 
associated with their master's honour. 

Alehouses.— Three small public-houses are kept open for the 
accommodation of travellers passing through the parish; but few 
of the parishioners are found to frequent them. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
There is reason to believe that in the last mentioned and m other 
respects considerable improvements have taken place since the writ- 
in/of thelast Statistical Account of this parish. The land is cer- 
tatnlv in a hiaher state of cultivation : new and improved modes of 
husbandry h°ave been introduced ; farm-houses and steadings are 
larger and more commodious; and the value of farm sacking has 
considerably increased, particularly by greater attention to the 
breed of horses and cattle, since the establishment of agricultural

societies. The farmers are wisely giving up the pernicious and 
demorahzing system of bothies, and returning to the old and bet- 
ter practice of employing respectable and industrious cottars, who 
take a greater interest in promoting their master's benefit, and so 
securing their own comfort. 

The general improvement in the arts is very sensibly observed in 
this district. Articles of manufacture are better constructed, and 
the workman is better remunerated for his skill and labour. In 
short, the general state of society seems to be growing better. 
The people, we hope, are advancing in intelligence, industrious 
habits, and moral discipline. And it is not unreasonable to ex- 
pect, that, by the blessing of God on the present improved means 
of education, especially as, respects religion, the young will be 
trained up to greater respectability and usefulness, and to higher 
Christian attainments ; and that the general population will gradu- 
ally become more distinguished for " whatsoever things are pure, 
and praiseworthy, and lovely, and of good report."

PRESBYTERY OF ARBROATH, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. JOHN MUIR, MINISTER. 



I- — Topography and Natural History. 
V The parish of St Vigeans is here considered as comprehend- 
ing the ecclesiastical districts of St Vigeans proper ; 2. Inver- 
brothock; 3. a third part of Ladyloan. 

Anciently this parish extended over the whole barony of Aber- 
brothock. It is in the abbey chartulary named indiscriminately 
Aberbrothock, Arbroith, or St Vigeans, the two first from the 
stream Brothock passing through the parish, and the last from the 
saint to which the church was dedicated. St Vigean was a monk 
and famed preacher in, the end of the tenth century.f His origi- 

inJ ,f-'''"'"'°'hock vas originally not the name of a town, but of a district sifrniPv

nal chapel and hermitage were at Grange of Conan, where there 
are a small grove and foundations of a chapel, and also a mostco- ' 
pious fountain, which preserves his name. Three or four acres of 
land contiguous to these are by tradition held as belongmg to the 
chapel. Not far from this place, there was a baronial castle, named 
Gory or Gregory, which perhaps afforded protection to him ; and 
a Druidical circle, on another eminence not very distant, laid a 
foundation for the rude population conveniently assembling and 
being converted to a new faith by former local associations. 

Extent —The greatest length of the parish from east to west is 
83 miles, and its greatest breadth 41 There are two detached 
estates, Inverpeff-er and Hospitalfield, the former lying to the south- 
west of Arbirlot, and the parish of Arbroath separating the latter. 
Including these two estates, the extent of the whole parish is 22 
square miles. 

The form of it is not very different from that of two nght-angled 
triangles raised upon the Brothock as a common base, the western 
triangle being somewhat more northerly than the eastern. The 
stream of the Brothock flows through the parish for four miles in 
a direction straight south, passing through the middle of Arbroath, 
and entering the sea at its harbour. 

Boundaries.— The parish is bounded on the north and on the 
east by Inverkeilor; on the south, by the German Ocean for 6ve 
miles ; and on the west, by Arbroath, Arbirlot, and Carmylie. 
Originally it included the parish of Arbroath, disjoined at the Re- 
formation, and the estates of Guynd, Crofts, and Milton of Co- 
nan, now in the parish of Carmylie, disjoined in 1606. ihe ec- 
clesiastical district of Inverbrothock was disjoined by the Presby- 
tery in 1829; and part of that latter district was agam disjoined 
and taken to constitute part of Ladyloan in 1837. Inverbrothock 
and Ladyloan districts include the whole suburbs of Arbroath, 
with about 100 acres of land on the east side, and 110 on the 
west side of the town.t c r.f 

Topographical Appearances. -The form of the surface of the 
narish may be understood, by conceiving three declivities in dit. 
Lent aspects, with an intervening valley. The ridge, commen- 
cing at the Red-head, in the parish of Inverkeilor, at a height of 

. Ladyloan consists of that part of St Vigeans to the south of Kepty Street, and 
'''inLX'tSaT&amp;oath, by Wilson, shows the present parishes most dis- 
tinotlv.

about 200 feet above the level of the sea, continues gradually ris- 
ing in a southerly direction, for four miles, to Dichmountlaw Cairn, 
where it is about 250 above the sea level, and from that eminence 
slopes equably south-west to Arbroath, about a mile and a-half 
distant. The eastern and western declivities of this ridge form 
the eastern triangle of the parish. Again, at the very western 
angle of the parish, Cairn Conan rises 550 feet above the sea 
level, at a distance of five and a-half miles from it; and from that 
eminence, from which there is a beautiful prospect in every direc- 
tion, there is an equable south-eastern declivity to the Brothock 
and to the sea. Between the declivities of these two eminences 
of Dickmountlaw and Cairn Conan, lies the valley of the Brothock, 
running from Arbroath towards Brechin, and forming one of the 
transverse valleys to those of Strathmore and the Lunan. The 
declivity towards the sea, in the eastern part of the parish, termi- 
nates in a mural precipice at the shore. This precipice, with the 
exception of two small bays, where the shore retires a little, con- 
tinues from the Red-head to within a mile of Arbroath, at Whit- 
ing Ness, where Mr Lyell, in his Elements of Geology, com- 
mences his engraved section of the strata in this part of Forfar- 
shire. Although, in general, on this part of the coast, the sea 
washes the foot of the abrupt precipice, a person of activity, 
during low water at spring-tides, may pass along between the sea 
and the rock for a distance of upwards of four miles, from a penin- 
sular rock, called Lud Castle, to St- Murdoch's Chapel, in the 
parish of Inverkeilor. In the face of the precipices, between 
Whiting Ness and Auchmiihie, there are a number of caves and 
arches, perforated by the action of the waves in the softer parts, 
and in the veins and crevices of the red sandstone. In calm wea- 
ther, some of these may be passed through in boats, and others 
on foot. They are visited by strangers, on account of their pic- 
turesque aspects; but their former inhabitants, the seals, have 
now abandoned them. There is one particularly accessible, where 
the masonic arcana were formerly gone through ; sombre enough, 
no doubt, while closed from the day, and lighted only by the 
flambeau below the lurid sides and roof of the sandstone. This 
cave extends 200 feet, with a strong calcareous spring at the far- 
ther end It is evident, when this was excavated, as well as many 
ot the others, that the relative levels of land and sea were different •

never enters it. There are also arches and excavations high up 
the precipices, far above the reach of the present tides. 

There is one remarkable perforation, about a mile south from 
Auchmithie, called the Geary Pot, probably named from the gy- 
ration of the sea at the bottom of the hollow, which terminates 
the natural arch, extending from the sea for 200 yards. This 
has evidently been excavated, through successive ages, by the  
wasting away, originally, of several veins of sulphate of baryta. 
The depth of this ravine is about 120 feet, and the descent to the 
bottom of it is practicable, though not easy. Besides the three 
miles of rocky shore, there is one mile, to the east of Arbroath, 
of a sandy shore, where the bank retires about 100 yards ; and 
on the Inverpeflfer estate, to the west of Arbroath, there is another 
mile and a-half of sandy shore, with a large space of links and 
sand hillocks, through which the Dundee and Arbroath Railway 

The temperature of the atmosphere of this parish is lower on 
an average than what its height above the sea level would indicate. 
The cross valley in which it lies, affording an easy passage to cur- 
rents of air between the ocean and the Grampians partakes some- 
what of the moisture of the one, and of the cold winds from the 
other There is a marked difference between this climate and 
similar situations on the coast of the Frith of Forth ; for instance 
about Musselburgh. From simultaneous observations made at 
fo h plls, it wfs found that, in clear nights, the thermometer 
falls Lch lower in the latter place than it does here ; while, on 
d7ys"f niuch sun, the temperature at Musselburgi rises much 
Sher. Here the maximum temperature of the day occurs at 
abcHit half-past twelve ; after that, in sunny days it rapidly sinks ; 
the ea breeze setting in with chilly damp, causing the afternoons 
to be far less agreeable, than in more inland situations, even of 
ForLhire. Our fruits and harvest are at least a fortnight later 
th" fields and gardens towards Dundee. A haze seen at the 
mouth of the Tay, or a particular brilliancy of the Bell Rock 
lip-hts are both accounted signs of approaching rain.

results. The temperature was taken also at eight o'clock a. m., 
and it differed only from the medium of maximum and minimum, 
on one year's average, about one-tenth of a degree, and, on ano- 
ther, three-tenths; so that this district differs much in its daily 
curve of temperature from Leith Fort, as ascertained by Sir David 
Brewster.

It may be remarked, however, that these four years have been 
everywhere of lower temperature than usual. 

In the parish, there are only two springs of very equable tem- 
perature, varying only about half a degree throughout the whole 
year. These give the average temperature, 47.4. One of these 
is at the inmost corner of the mason's cave, on the level of the 
sea, and about 90 feet below the surface of the ground, the other 
about 100 feet above the sea level, on the side of the road leading 
to Montrose, about a mile east from Arbroath, which latter throws 
np large quantities of carbonic acid gas, and atmospheric air. An - ' 
other copious spring near the manse, which varies about 4°, accord- 
ing to the season, gives the average temperature for 1841, 47.2°. 
The Brothock stream, which originally appears to have 'been J 
chain of small lakes, is mostly fed by .springs, and therefore not so 
speedily frozen as streams usually are of a similar size. It con- 
tains no fish, but some small pike and eels, the bleaching-works 
01 Its banks having completely banished the trout formerly found 
m It.

The second kind, or variegated sandstone, although it has oc- 
casionally where lime enters into its composition, hard seams ex- 
tending through its beds, is of a texture softer, and quite dif- 
ferent from the former more red-coloured sandstone. This 
commences where the rocky shore ends, at Whitingness, near 
where St Nmian's chapel and burying-ground were, and, takino- 
a bearmg north-west for two miles to Tarry mill, in the interior 
of the country, then bends westward, and serves for a foundation 
along the coast side for all that plain which passes throuah the 
panshes of Arbirlot, Panbride, and Barry. It appears conspicu- 
ously m all the small streams of the district which have cut it 
deeply, exposmg its mouldering surface to sun and frost, which 
reduce it speedily to sandy mould. But over all its extent there 
IS a comparatively level surface, which forms a beautiful platform 
for an exhibition of the art of agriculture ; and the opportunity 
has nowhere been better improved than here, for four or five 
handsome independent fortunes have been peacefully and honour- 
ably earned by the labours and care of the farmer. It would ap-

running from north to south, with a slight curve to the eas

on the conspicuous end of one of them on the east bank, and 
KeptY hill is the most prominent termination of another on the 
west bank of the streL. This latter is about 40 eet high 
These ridges consist of boulders, gravel, sand, and clay strata. 
What might have been the original agent in their formation, can- 
Jot be inferred with certainty; but they all exhibit such an ap- 
pearance, as if a great debacle from the north sea, in rushing past 
S igh land to L northward, had, in turning up the valley of 
he Br'othock, deposited in the eddies of its more shallow par 
its burden of stones and gravel swept from other surfaces ; nd

ganic fossils have been found in these alluvial strata, excepting 
petrified reeds. In the quarries from which the pavement is taken, 
which is a lower branch of the red sandstone, berry-like marks, 
fossilized joints of reeds, and leaves of rushes or grass are occa- 
sionally found deeply situated in the rock. 

Between the soil and the subsoil, on a great part of the western 
triangle of the parish, there is often a cake of a substance like bog- 
iron ore, called pan, evidently formed not from the iron in the 
 decay of the vegetation, but from the carbonaceous matter of the 
roots through successive ages, combining with the oxide of iron by 
which the red diluvial clay below is impregnated and coloured. 
This cake is very pernicious to the fertility of the soil, retaining 
the moisture in winter, and subjecting it to parching drought in 
summer. 

IT. — Civil History. 
Parochial Registers.— The oldest register in this parish com- 
mences with the settlement of Mr Patrick Strachan in 1665, and 
was kept by him fov thirty years, recording collections and church 
discipline, and texts of his sermons promiscuously. The baptisms 
and marriages were recorded at the end of the volume in the same 
manner. This volume is succeeded by an interval of thirty years 
without any record. Subsequent to 1727, a record Js re- 
gularly kept of all parochial matters, excepting funerals. For a 
few years after 1727, the sacrament of the Lord's Supper was 
not dispensed, under a superstitious notion, from the circum 
stance of the minister committing suicide, that the church was 

nm ul  " surrounding hollow, if that ordi- 
nance should be administered.

III. — PorULATION. 

The population of this parish has been, for the last 100 years, 
continually on the increase. According to Dr Webster's report, 
the population was then 1592. Since 1780, the increase has been 
rapid in the neighbourhood and suburbs of Arbroath. In 1754, 
there were but 12 families on the lands contiguous to the royalty, 
containing then, in all likelihood, 60 individuals. In 1793, only 
1369 persons of all ages, 669 males and 700 females, were there. 
There are now in the same limits, within the Parliamentary boun- 
darv, 1004 famihes, consisting of 6037 individuals. By the 
census of 1841, there were found in the parish, coniprehendmg 
the three ecclesiastical districts, 8780 ind.v.dua s, of which 2743 
resided in the country, including the country villages of Auchmi. 
thie, Marywell, and Gowansbank. Auchmithie -ntained abou 
980 - the village of Marywell, 170; and Gowansbank 120 Jii 
the town of Arbroath there resided, as above, 6037 mdividuals 
belonging to the Inverbrothock and Ladyloan districts 

The number of illegitimate births during the last three years 
vithin the three ecclesiastical districts has been in all 42, or one. , 
annually for every 670 of the population. 

The inhabitants of this parish are kind towards one another, 
and particularly interested in each others health and welfare. 
Though the operatives are not . highly educated, they are intelli- 
gent and sober. It is, however, to be lamented that many of 
fhe Lm-servants, having been bred from their boyish days in 
bothies, are but coarse and clownish in their manners. The com- 
petU and the consequent high rents, -.pel man 

nf he masters to exact from their servants severe and rough toil 
n al lund weather; and it must be evident, that such exer- 
Ls a scarcely consistent with much refinement of manners or 
Tch int Besides, the universal habit m arm- 

Ztuis of frequently changing their abode, is not favourable to 
their religious improvement and demeanour.

Within these few years, an occupation has been taken up in Ar- 
broath which is threatening to change the habits of part of the 
population ; it is that of brokers who afford ready accommodation 
to the inconsiderate to part with their necessaries, and thus in- 
crease their misery. Forty years ago, few females were employed 
at the loom ; now, on the lighter fabrics, they are employed in 
numbers, as stated particularly in the account in this paper of 
" Manufactures" by Mr Canning.

_ Bent of Land, The rental of land in this parish is exceed- 
ingly various,— pendicles near Arbroath paying about L.6 per im- 
penal acre, and an extensive farm paying only at the rate of 5s.,— 
the latter on an old lease. There are now onl/three extensive farms 
on old leases, all the rest of the parish being fully if not over-rent- 
ed. 1 here is now no undivided common. The woods in the pa- 
rish consist mostly of larch, with a mixture of Scotch fir, beech, 
and elm. L.ke most of the soil of the east coast, the soil is no 
particularly favourable for the growth of wood.

MatmfacturesJ — In no part of the county of Forfar, Dundee 
alone excepted, has the rapid increase in manufactures been more 
strikingly exemplified, than in that portion of St Vigeans which 
constitutes the suburbs of Arbroath. In the year 1808, there was 
only one spinning-mill in the parish,t namely, Inchmill, driven by 
a steam-engine of sixteen horse power, of which only a very small 
portion was then employed in the spinning of yarns, the remainder 
having been used as a flour-mill. About seven years after this, 
the whole was converted into a flax and tow-mill. It is now an 
extensive work, employed in driving flax and tow machinery, a 
chemical bleaching work, and plash and beating-mills. 

Arbroath and its vicinity had long been famous for the manu- 
facture of several descriptions of coarse linens and canvas ; but it 
was not till machinery had superseded the spinning-wheel, that 
the portion of the town lying in the parish of St Vigeans became 
the busy haunt of manufacturing industry. 

Intersected by the river Brothock, it was soon found to offer 
all the advantages requisite for an extensive system of factory 
spinning. A large piece of land, consisting of about thirty-five 
imperial acres, called Almerieclose, lying in the very suburbs of 
Arbroath, and on both sides of the river, was at once given off" by 
Its proprietor in feus ; and, in an incredibly short space of time, 
immense factories, with their towering stalks, and whole streets 
of dwelhng-houses were seen to rear their heads, where, only a 
short time before, the waving corn and the smiling orchard at- 
tracted the eye. 

The period embraced between the years 1820 and 1826, may 
be considered as the halcyon era of the linen manufactures in this 

+ .''"""'cated by George Canning, Esq,

quarter. It was during this comparatively brief space that by 
far the largest proportion of the buildings referred to was con- 
structed ; and although occasional seasons of prosperity have since 
occurred, to give a further impetus to this, the staple trade of the 
district, the live years referred to may, with safety, be mentioned 
as the period during which it was prosecuted with more uninter- 
rupted success than has ever since been the case. 

But this very prosperity, in the end, proved the fruitful source 
of wide-spread calamity. To meet the increasing trade of the 
town and suburbs, a native bank was established in Arbroath, con- 
temporaneous with which, an agency, from an Edinburgh bank, 
was opened, which, added to the two previously existing, presented 
the formidable number of four banks to a population, including 
the environs, of about 10,000 souls. Naturally anxious to do bu- 
siness, and to participate in the profits of such apparently unex- 
ampled prosperity, as that which everywhere met the eye, the 
xitmost facility and accommodation were afforded by the banks to 
alm6st every class of customers,— an unhappy feature, during 
prosperous times, of the banking system of the country in general, 
and which has not unfrequently led to the most disastrous results. 
The consequences were, in this place as elsewhere, that a number 
of individuals, destitute of capital, embarked in trade to an un- 
warrantable extent; and towards the close of 1825 and beginnmg 
of 1826, when the memorable panic in London convulsed the 
whole commercial community, its effects were experienced here 
with overwhelming severity, engulphing in one common ruin, not 
merely the speculator and adventurer, but many who for years 
had deservedly borne a character of unquestioned respectability, 
_a melancholy illustration of the instability of a commercial life, 
and a dear-bought warning to one and all, to avoid the fatal effects 
of over-trading. 

Nor has the warning been unavailing. The recollection of that 
disastrous period has never ceased to retain and to exhibit its sa- 
lutary effects, as well in the administration of the banking business 
of the district as on the whole body of merchants and manufac- 
turers ; and hence it is that, during the last four or five years, 
while the neighbouring town of Dundee has been a prey to the 
baneful effects of a system similar to that which, in 1826, pro- 

• It is here deservin- of remark that, while in 1825-26 there were four banks to 
a popilati'n ofrt 10,000, there are at present, and .-n srnce the last.non- 
tioned year, only three banks to a population now increased to lo,000.

strated Arbroath, the latter has been distinguished by a raodera- 
tion which has enabled its merchants and manufacturers to bear 
up against a series of bad trade, unparalleled in point of duration 
since the application of steam to manufactures. 

At the present time January 1842, there are in that portion 
of Arbroath comprehended within the parish of St Vigeans, fifteen 
mills or factories for spinning flax and tow into various sizes of 
yarns, from Hlb. per spindle upwards. These are driven by 20 
steam-engines of 250 horse-powei-, and give employment direct to 
1240 persons. Of these, 275 males are employed in the hackling 
or dressing of the raw material, about four-fifths of whom are 
adults, the remainder being apprentices of from fourteen to eigh- 
teen years of age. The persons who constitute the remaining 
number of workers are employed exclusively withinthe factories, 
properly so called, in the proportion of 250 males to 715 females 
Of these about 110 are men employed as millwrights, foremen, 
overseers, &amp;c.; about 250 are women twenty-one years of age and 
upwards, and the remainder young persons of both sexes from 
thirteen to twenty-one. 

The quantity of flax consumed in these mills may be estimated 
at 6500 tons per annum, of the average aggregate value of about 
L.200,000. The value of the yarns spun therefrom, and from the 
tow which is thrown offin the process of hackling, maybe calculated 
at about L.264,000. The largest proportion of the flax thus con- 
sumed IS imported direct from Russia, the port of Riga furnishino- the 
greatest quantity and the kind held in the highest estimation, both 
on account of its quality and colour. From St Petersburg there 
are also considerable supplies occasionally derived, but the quality 
of ate years has been falling off, and the article is consequentW 
in ess repute Some of the Prussian ports, chiefly Memel and 
Pillau, furnish a certain portion. A small quantity is also import- 
ed fron. Ire and, but the flax of that country is in general too high- 
priced for this market.  

With regard to the morals of the persons employed in these 
works, we have no hesitation in pronouncing it as our decided 
conviction, that they are not only not more lax than any other 
numerous body placed in similar circumstances of unavoidable 
Juxt.q.osit.on, but we have reason to believe that they are pon 

on h::;h"'" """"r'  their general walk and conversa- 
t on than those in any other place of equal extent within the ma 
-facturing districts. The health of the people thus employe t

also unquestionably above the average of those devoted to similar 
pursuits elsewhere. Dr Arrott, a highly respectable medical prac- 
titioner of forty years' standing, whose residence is contiguous to 
one of the principal factories, and who has had ample opportuni- 
ties of ascertaining the fact, assures us, that the health of the mill 
people here is, on the whole, good ; that, notwithstanding the re- 
duced wacres of late years, and consequent lack of nourishing food, 
cases of Typhus have been comparatively few, and that epidemics 
are not more prevalent or more fatal amongst them than any other 
individuals confined to in-door occupations. 

This gratifying state of things we attribute to the operation ot 
several causes. And first we may notice the favourable position 
of he town, and the description of houses appropriated to the re- 
sidence of the u'orking classes. Lying partly along the shore of 
the German Ocean, and extending thence up the valley of the 
Brothock, from which the streets rise and recede on both sides, 
there is, as it were, a natural capability for cleanliness ; and assist- 
ed as this is by an active police, ever busy in tha work of improve- 
ment, Arbroath, including much of the suburbs, may be safely 
pronounced as decidedly the cleanest manufacturing town in ocot- 
land. But besides this, it is happily recommended by an entire 
absence of those huge buildings, Scotice lands, in which, in some 
of the larger towns, the humbler classes are ccingregatea together 
in dense masses, producing a physical as well as moral miasma at 
once pestilential and fatal. Here whole streets are composed of 
small tenements of one storey, where the weaver hackler, or other 
artisan, enjoys his self-contained house, with his l;ttle piece of 
earden-ground behind. The advantages of such a system of do- 
niiciliation are observable in habits of cleanliness and self-respect 
rarely to be met with in those abodes of wretchedness to -.hich 
we have alluded. The health is obviously far less liable to be 
impaired, and a higher standard of morality amongst the inma es 
Z, as : necessary corollary, be inferred. To the dry and salu- 
ZL situation of the town and suburbs then, and to the favour- 
able construction of the dwellings occupied by the -rking-classe , 
in conjunction with the active exertions of the Sabbath-sch ol 
eache s, and other means of religious and moral -truction else- 
Itere referred to, do we ascribe the comparative good health and 
n oLo.A:.i which, in the midst of much privation, charac- 
t e, generally speaking, the factory workers in tb- quarter

the friends of temperance be passed over without special notice 
and commendation. In some of the mills there are many good 
and pious men active in the cause of promoting sobriety amongst 
their fellow-workmen ; and the writer, of this has great pleasure in 
bearing his grateful testimony to the growing improvement visible 
in the habits of the men in his own employment, traceable entirely 
to the power and influence of the Total Abstinence Society, whose 
principles are progressing gradually, and which are destined ere 
long, we firmly believe, to work a moral reformation in the man- 
ners and habits of the industrial classes, which cannot fail to be 
productive of the most beneficial results. 

To the improvements consequent on the introduction of the 
Factory Act, some good is also to be attributed, and in nothing 
more than the necessity which it imposes on all mill-owners to 
observe the same stated hours for working. In this respect, and 
the restraint caused by the medical certificates, and the visits of 
the inspectors, against the employment, whether from the cupidity 
of parents or the avariciousness of masters, of children of a tender 
age mere than a given number of hours daily, the act is doubtless 
beneficial. The hours of labour which it prescribes are twelve 
for each of the first five days of the week, and nine on Saturday, 
three-quarters of an hour being allowed for breakfast, and a simi- 
lar time for dinner. Six holidays are allowed in the course of the 
year. Children between the age of nine and thirteen are not per- 
mitted to work above eight hours per day, but of these none are 
employed in the factories here. Ample time is thus allowed for 
education before entering the mills ; and from the excellent semi- 
nary recently opened in connection with the church of Inverbro- 
thock, and other means of instruction, we would fondly hope, 
though in the present state of trade it is almost too much to ex- 
pect, that the day is not far distant when no young person will be 
found within the factories of this place, who has not received the 
elements at least of a plain education. Low as the fees are, how- 
ever, of the schools, it is not to be questioned that many well-in- 
tentioned parents are totally unable to contribute for any length 
of time even the small sum requisite for the education of their 
children. We refer more particularly to the children of weavers ; 
a class respecting whose condition we shall have occasion in the 
sequel to advert. With all the advantages, therefore, enjoyed by 
Ihis locality, as compared with many of the seats of manufac- 
tures, we doubt of anything short of a national system of educa- 



306 FORFARSHIRE. 

tiou being sufficient to check the crying evil of the children 
of the poor being cast on the world without religious or even se- , 
cular instruction. In the larger towns there is, there cannot be 
any other means of grappling with the demon of ignorance ; and 
while the Legislature, by wholesome laws, is bound, as far as prac- 
ticable, to alleviate the physical sufferings of the people, it is not 
less called upon to attend to their moral and religious training. 
The Government or Parliament which neglects both incurs a 
fearful responsibility. 

With respect to the wages of those employed in the factories 
here, though considerably lower than they have been, we should 
say, that, looking to age and the preponderance of females, they 
are perhaps the best paid class employed in the linen trade, with 
the exception of hacklers. Spinners, who are all girls of fifteen to 
about twenty-five years of age, earn from 5s. 4d. to 6s. 6d. per week ; 
reelers, from 5s. to 6s. ; and those in the preparing departments, 
from 3s. to Gs., according to the nature of the work assigned to 
each. The department requiring early and indispensable previous 
training is the spinning. It consists in expertness and facility in 
uniting broken threads, and which can only be efficiently acquired 
by the young. In the present improved state of machinery, the 
labour is by no means irksome ; and hence it is that it is no un- 
common thing, in passing through the spinning-flat of a well-con- 
ducted mill, to find many of the girls employed in reading. 
Spreaders, feeders, and reelers have a more laborious work to 
perform ; but the persons employed in these capacities are, for the 
most part, full-grown women ; and, generally speaking, they are 
allowed a longer time for meals and relaxation than the rest of the 
hands. The whole of the workers, men, women, and children, 
are at liberty to leave their employment on giving four weeks' 
jjotice,— in some cases even one week being held sufficient. Hack- 
lers are paid at the rate of 2s. for every hundred weight of rough 
flax which they dress ; and it is no unusual thing for a steady 
hand, with the assistance of an apprentice, whom he allows 3s. 6d. 
to 5s'. 6d., to earn L.l, 4s. per week. The average wages, how- 
ever,' of this class, including those who have no apprentices, does 
not perhaps exceed from 1 Os. to 12s. per week.

visions are cheap, contingencies which rarely fail to coexist, the 
wages of persons employed in these factories, with the exception 
of the boys and young girls in the preparing departnaents, may be 
considered as sufficient to maintain them, house-rents being here 
comparatively moderate, and fish abundant and cheap; but in 
periods of bad trade, such as has been experienced during the last 
four or five years, when wages are low, and bread high, the remu- 
neration is often inadequate to supply more than the necessaries 
of life; and the parents of many of the children being in such 
times either entirely idle, or only partially employed, it is obvious 
that no small amount of destitution and sufFering must unavoid- 
ably ensue. Such, indeed, is unhappily the case,"to some extent, 
at the present moment; and this brings us to speak of the hand- 
loom weavers, and here there are none other, than whom we 
know of no class whose labour, even when full employment can be 
got, is so scantily remunerated. 

In explanation of this, it seems necessary to take a brief review 
of the causes which have led to a state of things so deeply to be 
deplored, and, in a social as well as political point of view, so 
pregnant with matter for serious consideration. In the earlier 
stage of the application of steam to manufactures, and even up to 
a period, as regards the linen trade, comparatively recent the 
whole of the yarns spun in the factories were manufactured into 
cloth at home. This in prosperous times required a great num- 
ber of hands, and, from the facility with which the weaving of or- 
dmary fabrics can be acquired, :the demand was soon supplied 
more especially in winter, when masons and other out-door han- 
dicrafts, unable to pursue their usual callings, betake themselves 
to the loom An immense number of weavers being thus thrown 

ZTfT r' '' P-'' hat any derange- 

ment of the ordinary course of business, independent altogether of 
mere temporary stagnations, would seriously afi'ect this numerous 
body Such a derangement has at length occurred, in the shape 
of an extensive and daily-increasing exportation of yarns. It is- 

accou T th 'T:''' " 'h" ' 'ken into 

mUls hav b ' VP"'"g °f this new market, no additional 

mills have been erected to supply the deficiency thus occasioned

508 FORFARSHIRE. 

in the home manufactory, it is self-evident that the quantity of 
cloth produced must have suffered a corresponding diminution. , 
Here, then, is at once a solution of the partial or non-employment 
of hand-loom weavers, and, when employed, their low scale of 
remuneration. 

At first sight, it is apt to occur to those unconversant with the 
matter, that, from the facts just mentioned, the value of the linens 
manufactured at home would be materially enhanced by reason of 
the diminished supply. This is not the case. It is well known 
that some fabrics, at one time the staple of the place, are no longer 
souMit for ; the demand for others is gradually declining. It would 
appear, indeed, that the demand for manufactured goods is falling 
off in a'ratio corresponding to the amount of yarns exported. The 
situation of the manufacturer is thus daily becoming more preca- 
rious. It is undeniable, in short, that a change, slow, and it may 
be to some imperceptible, but not less sure and irresistible, is gra- 
dually shutting out the manufacturer from markets at one time 
exclusively his own ; the consequences of which except to the 
wealthy capitalist, who is better prepared a little longer to resist 
the sto'rm, cannot be other than a few short years of struggling 
and privation, ending in bankruptcy and ruin. But the mill-owner, 
it may be said, must at all events be profiting by this additional 
market for his yarns. The deterioration in value of this species 
of property of late years unhappily disproves the inference. The 
principal advantage, in the meantime, arising out of the foreign 
demand seems to consist in the ability which it gives to the mill- 
owner of keeping his factory going, which he would otherwise have 
been totally unable to do, except at an enormous sacrifice. Low 
prices can alone enable him to command the custom of the to- 
reicner, who has heavy charges to pay before the article reaches 
its destination. To save these, he will doubtless ere long have fac- 
tories of his own ; and the time is probably not far distant when the 
spinning trade will fly our shores as the weaving already in a great 
measure has done. The cure for these alarming evils it would be 
alien to our purpose to propound; but this much we cannot avoid 
saving, that any attempt to a'dminister palliatives to alleviate he 
condition of the present chief and most numerous victims of the 
revolution to which our staple manufactures are now being sub- 
iected, will, however philanthropic the intention assuredly end m

Here, as elsewhere, the privations of this class are sufficiently 
distressing, and would be much worse, were it not for the employ- 
ment given to their children in the factories. By this meanp,'"and 
owing to the local advantages already referred to, they contrive to 
subsist; but when disease and old age supervene, cases of suffer- 
ing, in its most aggravated form, must and do occasionally occur. 
The wages paid for the weaving of a piece of linen, which, in 
1825, were 17s. 6d., are now 9s. 6d. The fall in the price of 
canvas-weaving since 1836 has been 20 per cent. At present, a 
first-class weaver, working fourteen hours daily, cannot earn more 
than 8s. lid., and a second-class 7s. Id. per week. 

At the present time, the number of duck-houses, or shops for 
the weaving of canvas, is twenty, containing 242 looms, with the 
usual proportion of starching births. These shops are, generally 
speaking, low, damp, and ill-aired, which, combined with the long 
hours the inmates are obliged to work, in order to earn even mo- 
derate wages, can scarcely fail, with inadequate nourishment, to be 
prejudicial to health, and hence the squalid appearance of many 
of the weavers of sailcloth. The linen weavers are differently si- 
tuated,— these, for the most part, having each his loom in his own 
house, or m a small shop adjoining, where the air is less impure, 
and altogether a greater degree of comfort is found ; but they la- 
bour under the disadvantage of having to provide and uphold their 
own looms, or to pay rent if belonging to others, which is not the 
case with the duck-house weavers. There are two items of ex- 
pense, however, common to both, namely, for winding and light, 
and when these are deducted from their scanty and hard-won 
wages, the pittance that remains is poor indeed. Of canvas- 
weavers the number at present is about 450, of whom 40 or there- 
about are women ; linen-weavers, 732, of whom nearly one-third 
are females. These are exclusive of starchers, warpers, and fore- 
men besides a considerable number of aged women employed in 
wmding the yarns. P'"y«u m

subjected to the action of fire in a series of shallow pans, by which 
means it is calcined and converted into an alkali of no great strength, 
but which serves as an economical substitute for potash. The of- 
fensive vapours arising from this process are rendered innocuous by 
means of a chimney 150 feet high, which scatters to the winds what 
would otherwise prove an intolerable nuisance. In these works 
the number of persons at present employed is very inconsiderable.  
The average number is about 15 men and 25 women,— the wages 
of the former being from 10s. to 14s. per week, and of the latter 
from 5s. 6d. to 6s. 6d. Besides these there is another bleachmg 
work in the parish, of which it may be proper to take notice here. 
It is named Waukmills, and is situated on the Brothock, three 
miles from the harbour of Arbroath. Being intersected by the 
railway to Forfar it enjoys all the advantages of a cheap and ex- 
peditious means of communication with the town. It gives em- 
ployment to about five men and ten women. Here also is a mill 
for grinding bones, &amp;c. for manure. 

Next to the bleaching works may be mentionedthe plash-mills 
for milling brown yarns, and beating-mills for beating or softening 
the yarnsused for"weft. There are altogether three sets of plash 
and beating mills,— one of them driven by water power, consist- 
ing of a slight fall in the mill-lead, which, descending from nearly 
opposite the manse to the dam of Wardmill, belonging to the 
community of Arbroath, and thence to the southern extremity of 
Inchmill property, there returns its waters to the Brothock. This 
mill-race, running through the premises of the bleachers and yarn 
millers, affords an excellent supply of water for washing the yarns 
and other operations. 

When canvas or linens are about to be shipped either for the 
home market or exportation, they are generally calendered, that 
is, passed between and around the cylinders of a powerful engme 
of cast metal, called a callender, which smooths and gives a gloss 
to the cloth, similar to the household mangle, but of course much 
more ponderous and effective. By the lever-power attached to this 
machine, the cloth passing through it can be stretched in a greater 
or less degree as required. In connection with these public cal- 
enders, there is invariably found the hydraulic press, which isera- 
ploved to compress into compact bales of different sizes and shapes 
the cloth and yarns intended for shipment,— the saving in freight 
from being thus tightly pressed being considerable, especially when 
the goods are destined for far distant countries. These callenders

and presses are all worked by steam, giving employment to about 
15 men. 

In a place thus abounding with factories and other works, it may 
be inferred, that the services of raill-wrights and machine-makers 
must be constantly in requisition. The number of these, however, 
apart from the mills, is not considerable. In each factory there 
■ is a shop containing all the implements requisite for repairing the 
various machinery, and a set of mechanics, regularly bred as mill- 
wrights and machinists, forms a part of every establishment. Be- 
sides these, there are two works appropriated exclusively to the 
making and repairing of driving geer and mill machinery of every 
description, with the exception of steam-engines. The average 
number of men employed therein is about 25, whose wages run 
from 13s. to 17s. per week, with seven apprentices from 4s. to 
7s. 6d. 

There is only one foundry in the district. It is on a large scale, 
giving employment to 32 men and boys. The castings consist 
chiefly of stoves and other articles for the use of the settlers in 
Canada, to which country an extensive supply is annually export- 
ed. Attached to this work is a set of furnaces for making coke 
for the locomotive engines on the Dundee and Forfar Railways. 

In a previous paragraph, the Wardmill was incidentally referred 
to. It consists of a building of some extent, with the requisite 
appendages for grinding wheat and oats. It is driven by a water- 
wheel, the water being supplied from the dam formerly mentioned 
assisted in seasons of drought by a steam-engine of six-horse 
power. This property, though, like the rest of the parish, situ- 
ated without the royalty, belongs to the town corporation of Ar- 
broath The present rental is L.231 per annum. On the'east 
side of the dam was, and still in part is, a hill consisting of 
sand and clay, the former of which is being constantly taken 
away for ship s ballast and other purposes. A brick-work has been 
formed of the latter. In the course of a few years, the entire hill 
will be demolished, when a plain of considerable extent will be 
,rmed, and thus will be converted into a valuable piece of ground,

small scale, and employing few bands, it does not seem necessary 
to give any particular account of them. In the village of Mary- 
well, at CoUieston, and other small hamlets, as well as detached , 
cottages throughout the parish, weaving, in brisk times is carried 
on to a considerable extent; but, latterly, there has been a sad 
lack of employment, and many of the poor people have now little 
to support them, except the produce of their cow and a small pen- 
dicle of land, whose scanty crops have been rendered still more 
scanty of late years, by a succession of bad harvests 

Before concluding this rapid sketch of the manufactures of St 
Vigeans, it may be proper to warn those unacquainted with the 
locality, and its peculiar relation to the burgh of Arbroath, that 
the whole extent of the manufactures of that town is not to be 
considered as comprised within the preceding statistical details. 
It so happens, that the parish of St Vigeans runs mto the roya ty 
of Arbroath, in a manner so very remarkable, as almost to defy 
the sagest antiquarians of the district to point out, in some parts 
the precise line of demarcation between them In one quarter of 
Z town, namely. West Port, there is a house of two storeys, which 
enioys tie pecuhar distinction of being situated, one-half m the 
par sh of Arbroath, and the other half in the parish of St Vigeans 
There is also one in Guthrie Port, in a similar situation The 
nam irbroath, however, is common to the whole conUnuous 
ZZ of buildings, whether in the one parish or the other; bu 
n some important respects, they are very widely disunited. All 
hose for eLmple, whose property or dwelhng-houses happen o 
be wkh n the iU-d fined boundaries of the royalty, are entitled to

miles, about one mile of which runs through that detached portion 
of this parish which lies along the coast to the westward of Elliot 
water, in the parish of Arbirlot. Another line of railway was 
opened in January 1839, connecting Arbroath with the county 
town of Forfar, distant fifteen and a-quarter miles. The depot, 
at the Arbroath terminus of this railway, is situated in the parish 
of St Vigeans, which it intersects for a distance of nearly four 
miles. These great works are destined to confer inestimable ad- 
vantages, not merely on the towns with which they are more im- 
mediately connected, but on the county generally.' The number 
of passengers annually conveyed along them is much beyond the 
calculations of their most sanguine projectors ; and for the con- 
veyance of flax, yarns, cloth, coals, lime, agricultural produce, 
pavement, and other articles, they are found to offer such obvious 
advantages, that they now command the exclusive traffic for these 
and almost all other goods and merchandize. 

The present harbour of Arbroath having been found quite in- 
sufficient for the increasing shipping and trade of the place, an act 
of Parliament was obtained in 1840, for the improvement and en- 
largement thereof. A new harbour is, accordingly, now in the 
course of erection; and, when completed, cannot fail, in connec- 
tion with the railways, to increase and extend the commercial im- 
portance of the town, and its populous and industrious suburb, St 
Vigeans. 

_ Fisheries.-.'Ihe only fishery worth mentioning in this parish 
IS he sea fishing, carried on by the villagers of Auchmithie. 
Salmon-fishing has been tried on the shore by stake and bag nets, 
but never so successfully as to clear the expenses. In the white 
hshery, there are twelve boats employed, containing five men 
each. It would be difficult to ascertain the weight of fish 
taken by each. The cod are taken by contractors, at prices from 
5d to 7id. for each of full length, that is, seventeen inches fro.

vnerly, as stated in last Statistical Account, great numbers of lob- 
sters taken and shipped to London 16,000 in a season ; but 
the breed bas been much exhausted, as now, not 1000 are got 
durinc. a-year. Haddocks are taken in great plenty and are either 
smoked and taken to the Dundee market, or sold resh m Ar- 
broath and through the country. Their price for full s.ze, var.es 
from lOd. to Is. 6d. per dozen. Skate and halibut are also taken , 
the latter are sold by weight, at Id per pound. Almost the .o le 
boats annually depart to the north, on the second week of July, 
to the herring-fishing, where they remain for about sa weeks , 
and each boat contracts for 200 crans, at prices varying between 
9s and 13s. per cran, with two bottles of spirits to each man 
weekly ; and most of the boats, for a number of years, have made 
up theii' number of crans. Their bait for white-fishing is dragged 
for in the mouth of the Tay, or purchased from the lessees in the 
mouth of the Eden, and deposited among the rocks near their own 

villase, till required. , 

The fishers are a stout, healthy, and generally sober people. 
The pilotage of the entrance to the Tay, however, threatens to 
introduce the employment of their money with less.economy and 
sobriety than formerly.

The church of Inverbrothock was built in 1828, and opened in 
October 1829. It cost about L.2000, and is seated for 1230 sit- 
ters. The principal heritors and the town- council of Arbroath 
were the principal subscribers to it. The stipend secured to its 
minister is L.150, with L.20 for communion elements. The mi- 
nister of this church and his session have the superintendence of 
the poor within their district. The proprietor of each pew has a 
vote in the election of a minister, but the leet proposed to them 
is selected by the five managers. 

The church of Ladyloan is in Arbroath parish, but there are 
842 persons of the district allocated to that church within the pa- 
rish of St Vigeans. 

Within the parish there are only two Dissenting meeting- 
houses ; one belonging to the Original Constitutional Seceders, 
and another to the Methodists. The village of Auchmithie and 
neighbourhood employ a preacher of the Established Church in 
;i small chapel there. The late Countess of Northesk being de- 
sirous of more effectual means of spiritual improvement, and of 
the accommodation of the villagers, built this chapel in 1829. 
On account, however, of some hesitation of connecting it wholly 
with the Established Church, it was not opened till 1834. At 
that time, worship continued in it regularly on the Lord's day "for 
nine months, when it was again shut, and only opened for the pa- 
rish minister at such times as he could officiate. This continued 
till December 1840, when the villagers obtained a preacher to of- 
ficiate in their schoolroom, who, after some time, was admitted to 
the chapel, with the understanding that the privilege should only 
be from week to week during the pleasure of the proprietor.

The average numbers who communicate at any one time in the 
parish church and in Inverbrothock are about 800 in each ; but m 
St Vigeans district, there are, besides, about 245 communicants, 
who communicate in seven neighbouring parishes. J 

The stipend of the parish minister was augmented and modihed 
in 1819, and is 17 chalders, old measure; or 5 quarters, 5 bushels, 
3 pecks, 1 gallon, wheat; 12 quarters, 1 peck 1 gallon bear; 
84 quarters, 5 bushels, and 1 gallon barlej ; and 130 bo Is, 1 fir- 
lot, 2 pecks oatmeal, with L. 10 for communion elements ; 
amounting on an average of late years, by the fiars prices of the 
county, to about L. 260. 

The manse, offices, and garden wall were bmlt in 1817, at an 
expense of L.700, and are every way suitable for the accommoda- 
tion of a minister. The glebe, which was described by a prede- 
cessor as one of the worst of the county, contains about seven and 
a- half acres imperial, and, iu general, is not unproductive 

Education.-Thex are seven schools in the parish, five being 
.vithin the St Vigeans district, two in Inverbrothock, and one in 
Ladyloan. One of these, though in St V.geans, was budt for 
tverbrothock by subscription, and by aid from Governme 
during last season, and is large and handsome. The parish 
schoolmaster's salary is the maximum. He enjoys, besides, a mor- 
tification of L. 20 annually, for teaching five poor scholars ac- 
cording to a bequest from Mr Colville, late town-clerk of Arbroat . 
The fL may amount to L.40, and his emoluments as session- 
clerk to as much. He has, besides, a commodious house and gar- 
den the former of which was built about twenty years ago.

Poor and Parochial Funds. — For some years at the end of the 
last, and at the beginning of the present century, an assessment 
for the maintenance of the poor became necessary, by the exhaus- 
tion of the usual charities. It was, however, only about 1812 that 
assessments became constant. The annual expenditure on the 
poor on an average of three years, was then L.258, 12s. of which 
sum, L.93, 3s. was raised by assessment. From that time to the 
present, the amount of assessments has gradually increased, and the 
average of the last three years is as follows : Raised by assess- 
ment, L.508, 14s. 5d. ; church collections, L.138, 18s,; mortifi- 
ed sums or legacies, L.18, 18s. 5d.; seat rents, proclamations, 
mortcloths, L.30, lis. 7id.; paupers' effects, L.6, lis. 5d. ; total 
expenditure on the poor, L.698, 13s. lOd. 

The assessment has hitherto been raised on the landed proper- 
ty alone, according to the old valued rent. The number of pen- 
sions paid to the regular poor and to the occasional is as follows : 
To the regular poor on the roll, 163; occasionally receiving pa- 
rochial aid, 30. The sum expended on the former amounts to 
L,647, 16s. 6d. ; so that each pension on ,an average is L.3, 19s. 
7d.; the sum expended on the latter was, L.50, 17s. 4d. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since the last Statistical Account was written, the population 
has nearly doubled, the landed rental tripled, the staple manufac- 
ture of the suburbs of Arbroath,— the spinning of flax yarn by ma- 
chinery—has been created, the thrashing-mills are tenfold in num- 
ber and power, the turnip and potato husbandry immeasurably 
extended, the fishing boats of Auchmithie doubled. No proprie- 
tor then kept a four-wheeled carriage ; now seven do so. The 
dress, food, and accommodation of all classes are much superior ; 
what were foreign luxuries then, have now become necessaries. 
1 he funds for the support of the poor were then L.70, now they 
are L.700 ; the former sum was then accepted with humble thanks, 
the latter sum is craved with murmuring. Loyalty, according 
to the writer of that day, was fresh and vigorous, now the suspi- 
cion of all power lies deep and rankling. Parents then supported

I Topography and Natural History. 

a, Sr'c —Many centuries before the erectioh of this parish, 
the lands of which it consists are said to have taken their natne 
from Carald, a Danish leader, who, in his flight from the battle 
of Aberlemno, was slain, not far from the present tarm-house of 
Nether-Careston ; and, in order to perpetuate the memory of this 
achievement, his victors raised over his place o sepulture a bar- 

ow, and on it erected an obelisk, named from him Carald-stane, 
or Carald's-stone, contracted afterwards into the more modern 
term Careston. The obeUsk has long since been removed, but 
the barrow yet remains. Others derive the name of this parish 
f,om the ancient but now disused Celtic word carakl which at one 

L denoted the quality red, as being the colour of the rock w id. 
forms the middle portion of the subsoil of this parish. But if so 

should the compound word "--/Jnorn 
the Gaelic and Saxon languages instead of that of the former 
alone and then it would thus- have been expressed Fearn-carald

bore the name of Fuirdstone, or Fordstone, from the number of

Boundaries, Figure, and Extent. — This parish is bounded by 
those of Menmore, on the north ; Brechin, on the east ; Aber- 
lemno, on the south ; and Tannadice, together with Fearn, on 
the west. 

In figure, it forms an irregular oblong, stretching out in length 
to about 3 miles from north to south, by 1 in breadth from east 
to west. On two sides, the boundaries are pretty regular and 
straight, but on the two ends of the oblong, the limits are more 
irregular, more especially to the south, where, in two different 
places, they pass beyond the river Southesk. The parish con- 
tains a surface of nearly 3 square miles. Agreeably toa mea- 
surement made, about eight years ago, by Mr William Corsar, 
land-surveyor, this parish contains upwards of 2056 acres sta- 
tute measure. Formerly, it contained perhaps about 100 impe- 
rial acres more, now belonging to the farms of Balnabriech and 
Craigend, which farms, though they both belong to the estate " 
of Careston, are yet situated in the parish of Brechin ; conse- 
quently, whatever ground was lost to Careston parish by the 
straightening of the marches of these farms, was so much added 
to that of Brechin, where this latter parish unites with Careston. 

From the Southesk river, which, for a small way, forms the 
southern limits of this parish, it rises with a gentle undulating 
swell to near its northern termination, and then begins to decline 
as it stretches farther north to its termination with the lands of 
Balhall, in Menmore parish. Here, the boundary is by no means 
distinct, which it might easily have been made by following the 
course of the small rivulet of Wiras westward as far as the parish 
extends in that quarter; a,s this same streamlet, where it leaves 
the parish on the east, forms the parochial boundary on the 
north-east. 

The climate is on the whole good, the air being, for the most 
part, pure and salubrious.

Hi/droffraphij.—rhere are several small brooks in this parish, 
all of which take their rise in it from copious fountains of excel- 
lent water. Some of our springs are chalybeate ; and two large 
ones, in the northern part of the parish, in a slight degree partake 
of carburetted hydrogen gas, which is indicated by large and nume- 
rous air-bubbles rushing up in the fountain along with the water. 
Everywhere we have plenty of good spring water for domestic use 
The pure streams of the Noran and the South Esk flow through 
and unite together in this parish. The water of the former is 
so peculiarly limpid, that there is yet a tradition that one of our 
queens, in olden time, washed her curtch or cap in its stream, near 
the place where the farm-house of Nether Careston is now situ- 
ated, and pronounced the Noran to be the clearest stream in Scot- 
land The South Esk, too, is a clear water, sparkling with a 
mild cerulean tint, yet it cannot vie with the stream of the singu- 
larly pellucid Noran. Both, for a great way of their course, flow 
over a bed of either rock or gravel, and hence the purity of their 
several waters. The South Esk requires a good deal of labour 
annually to retain its water within its channel, and prevent it from 
overflowing and injuring the adjoining haugh lands. 

There were formerly many small lakes, or rather ponds m this 
parish, some of which yet remain undrained; in particular, there 
is still a pretty considerable lake in the upper part of the parish, 
which might nearly be converted into arable ground ; at least about 
forty acres might be thus reclaimed. Indeed, it appears highly 
probable, from the general show of the ground itself, that a large 
portion of the haugh land on the side of the Esk had,  one time, 
' constituted a lake of considerable magtntude. 

Geoloayand Mineralogy.- h\rnost the only rock here is the 
old sandstone, of a pretty dark-red colour, and tolerably hard and 
solid in its texture. A rock of frequent occurrence is by some 
considered to be lias. It forms a considerable part of the sub- 
soil of the middle portion of the parish ; that to the north of 
it being till or diluvium ; whereas in the more southerly district, the 
subsoil is generally gravel mixed with sand. In the till the gravel 
is commonly mixed with coarse clay or mortar, and is very reten- 
tlve of moisture ; but the case is quite different in this respect m 
the south end of the parish. There, in the haugh land, the sub-

soil consists almost of gravel only, which is easily accounted for, 
from the very frequent changes of the river, — in so much, that, at 
one time or another, the Esk must have passed over the whole of 
the adjacent valley. Considerably above the haugh land, and 
near the middle part of the parish, moss prevails, under a thick 
sward of coarse grass, to no small extent in low places, especially 
in a western direction. 

About thirty years ago, the present incumbent, in trenching a 
small part of the glebe that had never before been cultivated, 
found a piece of shell-marl, about the size of a man's head, ii 
the bottom of the trench, under a thick covering of sand, rather 
more than three feet in thickness; but no more was met with 
there, nor, as far as he could learn, in any other part of this 
parish; although some nodules of rock-marl may occasionally be 
found by digging pretty deeply. In the small piece of the glebe 
that he then trenched, he met with three different subsoils: to 
the north, moss about 2 inches in thickness; in the middle, 
pure dark-red clay, of considerable thickness ; and on the south, 
a thick bed of sand, where the marl was detected. 

The soil of the parish, where not moorland, of which there is 
but little, is generally of a black loam, especially in its northern 
portion ; but, as before observed, resting on till; this subsoil being 
very retentive of moisture, renders the incumbent soil far less pro- 
ductive than it otherwise would be; yet, still, when judiciously 
managed, it not only produces good green crops, but oats and 
barley too, in their proper rotation. On the north-west corner 
of the upper land of the parish, as the black loam rests mostly on 
sand, and the loam itself is thick and of good consistency ; there, 
good crops may in general be more depended on than in the same 
northern quarter farther eastward. Were, however, surface- 
draining, by the help of tiles, or even divots, used, as is now judi- 
ciously done in the middle part of the parish, then a very great 
improvement in the agriculture of our northern farms would, 
doubtless, be effected, especially on each side of every ridge, now 
saturated with moisture. In the middle portion of this parish, the 
soil is still black; and lower down, it inclines somewhat to a red- 
dish colour, and has a subsoil something like the former, only 
there is far less clay mixed with the gravel and sand, and, of con- 
sequence, less retentive of moisture. Still, however, even here, 
the tile-draining, or that by divots, a far cheaper mode of drying 
land from surface-water, must be productive of much good. Be- 



522 



FOllFARSHlllE. 



neath the latter subsoil, the lias-rock is often found. Farther 
south, the rock wholly disappears ; and there the subsoil consists 
of a very thick bed of gravel and sand ; and as the land here is 
far drier, the less draining is requisite. Here, too, the soil be- ' 
comes of a yet more red hue, and this is especially the case with 
the haugh-land. In that quarter, the soil is often but thin, and 
occasionally intermixed with hirsts of gravel, or gravel and sand ; 
here, also, the ground, in dry seasons, yields but a stinted crop, 
being parched, and sometimes quite burnt up by the drought ; 
and, in general, the haugh-land is far less productive than the ad- 
joining upper ground, which is still more friable, and, for the 
most part, rests on a bed of gravel only. 

In the upper part of the parish, large blocks of trap have been 
found amongst the till, together with considerable boulders of 
granite, gneiss, micaceous schistus, basalt, and greenstone; as 
also trap-tufa, either alone or mixed with specks of limestone ; 
likewise, either along with these boulders, or alone, there are 
to be met with much smaller fragments of quartz, jasper, por- 
phyry, serpentine, and trap and slate, all less or more round- 
ed by the action of water in very ancient ages. By digguig 
pretty deep, also some nodules of limestone have been brought 
into view, but no bed of it has been found. Sometnnes the 
nodules of the limestone have been detected mtermixed vvith 
the lias, and wherever this is the case, they then render the has 
of a much harder consistency. In the lias, too, clusters of rock- 
crystals may occasionally be detected; sometimes, too, pebbles pt 
chalcedony, veined with white carnelian, and' intermixed with 
quartz, have occasionally been found ; but generally they are very 
coarse, and of no value. The direction of the dip of the rock, 
in this parish, is towards the north. Many years ago, quarries 
were opened in different places, for stone fences ; yet none have 
been wrought here, for upwards of forty years, for the above pur- 
pose ; and when stones for building houses have been required, 
then recourse has been had to a quarry, on this estate, in our im- 
mediate vicinity, but situated in Brechin parish. There the rock 
is very hard, and requires not a little gunpowder to blast it.

 It may here be mentioned, that a pair of wild geese formed an association with" 
a flock of tame geese belonging to Mr Skene, who caused great care to be taken 
ot them, msomuch, that they were regularly fed and housed, along with their domes- 
tic associates; with these they wintered for several years, and as regularly departed 
during the breeding season, and again returned to their former companions by the 
end ot autumn, but unaccompanied with their young. 

On the other hand, some tame ducks belonging to" the farm of Nether Careston, 
on being repeatedly seared from the poultry house by dogs, first grew timid, and at 
last becanie quite wild, and flew away altogether. Afterwards, they were repeatedly 
observed flying about in the air like ordinary wild ducks ; and at no great distance, 
some ducks quite light-coloured, like tame ones, have been sprung from marshy 
ground in the midst of a covey of wild ones.

Ivsects, Worms, Testacea.— Oi this numerous, diversified, and 
destructive race, we have many kinds, which it is quite unnecessary 
to specify. Itmav, however, be observed that of betles, we possess 
a great variety ;— from the Scaraheus melolontha, the cockchaffer, 
down to the Curcidio granarius, or weevil, so destructive in grana- 
ries. Among these, it may, however, be noticed concerning the Coc 
cinellcB, or lady-bird kind, that the juice of these insects, when 
crushed and applied to a carious tooth, is said to give relief, if not to 
cure the toothach. It also may be stated, that the Cimex America- 
nus or the American bug, has lately come, or rather been brought, in 
some occult wav, to the gardens at the house of Careston, and there 
proved most injurious to the fruit trees. Both in gardens, and even 
in our fields, we are at times annoyed not a little by different kinds 
of slugs, Limaces, more especially by the Umax agrestis, the small 
gray one, and by the Limaxjlavus, the amber-coloured slug. Among 
the Vermes or worms, we have that rather uncommon one, the

Gordius aquaticus, or hair-eel, found in fountains and ditches. 
Some time ago, we had the Hirudu sanguiswja medicinal leech, 
in two of our small lakes or rather pools, but the creature has 
since disappeared. Of the Bivalve shells, we have yet the Mya 
Margaritifera, or fresh-water mussel, in which pearls of some 
size are occasionally found ; and in some of our pools and stream- 
lets, there is to be met with the Turbo fontinalis, or fresh-water 
wilk, whose shells form a great portion of shell marl. The sub- 
stance of the Julus terrestris, or nillipede, of which we have great 
plenty, is considered to be of service, when taken inwardly, as a re- 
medy for jaundice.

cluding the article of Botany, it may be stated that the Ge- 
ranium pyrenaicum is said to be a sovereign remedy for the 
disorder St Anthony's fire, it being used both outwardly and in- 
wardly ; and that Senecio vulgaris, mixed with Anthemis arvensis, 
and boiled either in milk or in water, is then to be used as a 
lotion for removing a dead lump : Also that an equal mix- 
ture of Diffitalis purpurea and Conium maculaium, boiled to the 
consistency of a liniment, to which a proyer quantity of hog's-lard 
is to be added, is said to prove a good remedy for a cut, or even 
an ulcer • Also, that a mixture of Clielidonium majus, with a very 
little Hyoscyamus niger, and the root of the Polygonum amcu- 
lare, boiled in a quart of water, along with the whites of a few 
effffs, and a very little white vitriol, and then strained, may, 
after being cooled, be beneficially applied to sore or weak eyes. 
The Highlanders are said to use the Orobus tuberosus, under the 
notion of averting the pain of hunger ; also the root of the lmda

It may be here further noticed, that, towards the close of last 
century, a small piece of ground being trenched, adjoinino- to 

he castle, but remote from the garden, of itself spontaneous- 
ly produced a U.ick crop of curly, or German green plants. 
Before this, the above ground had been uncultivated time out of 
ni.nd, so that the seed of these plants must have remained a very 
long period dormant in the earth.

formedinto a new parish, thereafter named Careston, In favour of Sir 
Alexander Carneggy, the proprietor of the above lands at that time. 

Some years thereafter, when this same baronet had made a 
purchase of the farms of Craigend and Balnabreich, both m the 
parish of Brechin, and immediately eastward of that of Careston, 
he same King executed an additional grant of the temds of these 
last farms in favour of Sir Alexander hkewise ; but, although 
this new grant was corroborated by the sanction of the Scot- 
sh Parliament, it seems never to have been put in force,- 
p bab rcon;eciuence of the troubles of the latter part of the 
Kind's reicn, or, if these farms were then for a short season 
xmited to the parish of Careston, of which there is now no proof, 
" they soon were again reunited to that of Brechin on the 
Ltoration of Episcopacy; and thus Careston, after this revo- 
lution in ecclesiastical polity, continued as a parish, agreeable to 
the state of its original formation. 

Channes of Proprietors who held Careston Estate.-Some cen- 
turr ago, L eftate formed a small part of the very extensive 
domain of the Earl of Crawford, who, for a time was one of 
the most potent amongst the Scottish nobihty ; besides many 
different properties in the south of Scotland, now belonging o the 
Duke 0 Buccleuch, and others, and the 1-ge districts of Loch 
aber and Badenoch, lately forming a part of tbe Dukedom o 
G don in the north,.the Earl held not a few valuable estates 
Wh in Aneus and Fifeshires. In the former of. these he had 
th t uee not far distant residences of Edzel, Careston and 
Finh en ; and, when in the south, he occupied Lindsay's Tower 
 C IS le Crawford, in the large barony of that same name in 
lon. ;hence he had his title f-Lid"'™

of his near alliance to the blood-royal, he was permitted to as- 
sume the royal arms of Scotland, as yet appears by their em- 
bossment above the mantel-piece of the chief room in the Castle 
of Careston. Things continued much in the same condition 
for two generations, till David, who was surnamed the Tiger 
Earl, or Earl Beardie, having dared to unite in a rebellious league 
with the Earls of Douglas and Ross against the interest" of 
Kmg James II.,- his estate was forfeited. Still he ventured his 
fortune in battle with his sovereign's lieutenant, Earl Huntly, at 
Huntlawhill, in the neighbourhood of the town of Brechin. 
Here he was overcome, and was so far humbled as to be con- 
stramed to sue to his conqueror to intercede with the King 
to reverse his forfeiture, and repone him in his estates. This 
Huntly undertook, and successfully accomplished, on the hard 
conditions of his granting to Huntly precedence in dignity, the 
shenfFship of Inverness county, and the lands of Lochaber and 
Badenoch therem situated. Very long afterwards, during the 
reign of King James VI., another Earl of Crawford fell into a 
situation similar to that of his predecessor, Earl Beardie ; to extri- 
cate himself out of which, he had to yield a similar sacrifice to 
Mongo Carneggy, Esq. the father of the before-mentioned Sir 
Alexander Carneggy, and a most eminent lawyer of his day; by 
the happy exerc.se of whose legal acumen Earl Crawford escaped 

te7Z 7r ''''' 'u- " P-- «f P-ting with 

the lands of Careston, which thus passed into the family o the 
Carneggys of Balnamoon. 

 About the commencement of last century, Carneggy of Bal- 
namoon and Careston sold this latter estate t Sir Job f sLa 
Bart, of Grandtully, who, after having been some years in 

lifetime. appear at Court during all Robert II.'s

possession, during which he made considerable exertions in 
the way of ornamenting the manor-place, resold this estate unto 
Major Skene, a cadet of the family of Skene of Skene. 

On the death of Major Skene, this estate next passed mto the 
possession of the Laird of Skene of that Ilk, and the twelfth of 
the chieftains of the Skene family, who, from father to son, bore 
the pronomen of George. Mr Skene acquired this valuable pro- 
perty in the following singular manner : Major Skene had wo 
daughters, the elder of whom was married to the above laird of 
Skene, and her younger sister to Sir John Forbes of Foveran. 
Both ladies were married at the same time, when their father de- 
clared, that he would bequeath his estate to either of his daugh- 
ters who should first have a son. In due time, Mrs Skene bore 
the heir to this property, which he thus inherited in right of his 
mother, as, in that of his father, he enjoyed, from a long paternal 
line of ancestors, the estate of Skene. 

Eminent M.«.-The three last Messrs George Skenes were al 
eminent for their skill in music. They were also men of great 
mental endowments ; in consequence of which, and the high 
status which they deservedly occupied in the counties o Aber- 
deen and Forfar, they took a leading part in all the public con- 
c ns of these Shires. The son of that Mr Skene who was 
married to Major Skene's daughter was a great improver 
rWs estate. In his time, a better mode of agriculture came 
nt usf uch as the cleaning of the ground before cropping, 
as well as the application of marl or lime ; a new and be ter ro- 
tbu of crops, a'nd the raising of esculent plants, were all begun 
to be attended to as most requisite branches of husbandry.

school, liberal in his views and conduct, and most steady 
to his party. He was indeed a generous and humane man, and 
took much pleasure in doing good to his fellow-creatures, by pa- 
tronizing the deserving, befriending the friendless, and relieving 
tlie needy. 

Three of the grandsons of the Rev. Mr John Gillies, the first 
Presbyterian minister here after he Revolution, and sons of Mr 
Robert Gillies, merchant in Brechin, all attained to eminence in 
different departments and professions. The oldest son, Dr John 
Gilhes, wrote the History of Greece and other historical works 
of merit, for which he had the honour to be appointed Royal 
Historiographer. His younger brother, Colin Gillies, Esq. be- 
sides being a good agriculturist, became eminent as a general 
merchant and manufacturer. In advanced life, he became Pro- 
vost of Brechin, and tilled the chief magistrate's chair with be- 
coming dignity. 

The present Lord Gillies, the youngest, attained to much emi- 
nence as a lawyer, and is now a Judge of high note in the Court 
or bession. 

Mr David Henry, of Ardrossan, in Ayrshire, is distinguished 
as a civil-engmeer. He is a native of this parish; and attended 
Mr Brown, the late parochial schoolmaster here. In his profesion 
as an engineer, Mr Henry was much employed both in England 
and the south of Scotland; and when the locks of the Aberdeen- 
shire canal, on repeated trials, were found insufficient, he was 
brought from a distance to superintend their reconstruction.

and in a more business-like manner. 

Antiquities.— \i is thought by some antiquarians that the Ro- 
man Castra stativa .sica, or a camp on the Esk, and distant 
from that on the Tay thirteen Roman miles, equal to twenty- 
one English, was situated in this parish, near the mflux of 
the Noran into the Esk, so as to command a ford over this latter 
stream ; and perhaps the farm of Gateside took its name from the 
Roman station sica, as forming a gate or port to and from the 
river; and there is yet in the vicinity, a house named Ward-end, 
which might possibly refer to some lesser fort connected with the 

former one. , . . if 

As already stated, there is, on the field adjoining the farm- 
house of Nether- Careston, a barrow, which is believed to have 
been thrown up to perpetuate the slaughter and burial of the 
Danish chief Carald, from whom this estate and the parish long 
afterwards took its name. 

Under this head, may be mentioned the Castle of Careston, 
the main part of which building was erected, about 440 years ago, 
by the Earl of Crawford. The same nobleman, according to 
tradition, was also the builder of Fi.nhaven, his chief residence, 
vhen in this part of the country. The west wing, which is evi- 
dently the oldest, is said to have been built by one of the Carneg- 
gy family, and most likely vhen they came mto the posses- 
ion of the property of Careston. The east wing is though to 
have been built by Major Skene, soon after he acquired the estate 
Both wings project to a good distance from the main body of the 
house, but are connected together by a long lobby in front. 
Abov; the mantel-piece of what is now termed the o d drawings

On each side of the arms and the above inscription, are two 
naked men, nearly full size, each riding on a lamia, and each hold- 
ing a double military trophy, supported on a lance, with a flag 
at top, and on either flag are the letters S, p, q, n. And above 
the heads of these riding figures, are those of a naked man 
and woman, holding in the right hand of the one, and the left of 
the other, two cornucopias, festooned, and united in the middle by 
a Pan's head. 

In the present dining-room, above the mantel-piece, are the 
Earl of Airlys arms, with the motto, A Faine. On each side of 
the arms, are two antiquated urns on pedestals, each supported by 
a naked man, holding the urn in his arms. On the top of each 
urn, are two entire twined serpents, resting on their tails. Below 
the pedestals, at some distance, and quite detached, are two very 
full human faces. Much lower down, on each flank of the pro- 
jecting fire-place, are two satyrs, a male on the right side, and a 
female on the left, each in a state of complete nudity. 

Above what was at one time the grand entrance "'to the castle, 
on the north side of the adjoining low buildings, are the arms of 
Carneggy of Balnamoon. 

On the front of the castle, and the middle of the main buildino- 
are the Gan-ntully arms. The date above these arms is 1714 
Inside the west wing, on the second story, and facing that 
which appears, at the time when the wing was built, to have been 
the prmcipal stair, is a group of arms in oval shields, nine in num- 
ber, and all arranged in the like oval form. In the centre are the 
Jjarneggy arms, as already described. On the dexter side, \sL

the motto above, - Deeds show." Exclusive of the arms, there are

also here two men in robes, on each side of the arms, and on tlieir 
flanks two others in armour, in the Highland costume, wuh helmets 
and coats of mail, with their hands folded. 

In the western bed-room, are the arms of the Earl of Haddu.g- 
ton, with the motto above, " Praesto et Presto." 

In the bed-room, west wing, are the arms of Balthayock, w.th 
the motto above, " Virtute Tutus." . 

In another bed-room is the figure of a piper playing on his m- 
strument, the Highland bagpipe, instead of a coat of arms, above 
the mantel-piece. And in the same situation, m another bed-room 
there are the figures of two peasants dressed m short tunics, each 
with a flail in his hand, two sheaves of corn laid across one another, 
and rakes and corn forks beside the men. 

Although the Castle of Careston cannot boast much of orna- 
n.ent in its construction, it is, on the whole, a stately edifice 
and carries in its appearance an aspect of grandeur, well suited 
to a baronial residence. 

III. — Population. 
The earliest accurate statement of the population of this parish 
is the return made to Dr Webster, about the middle of last cen- 
turv, when the number of its inhabitants was 269.

There are two thrashing-machines in the parish : one of these, 
on the farm of Nether Careston, was erected forty years ago, and 
is driven by water ; the other, on the farm of Hillhead, is quite 
new, and is moved by horses.

About 40 acres imperial, now nearly unproductive, might be re- 
claimed by judicious draining. 

On the above 280 acres of woodland, which, about eight years 
ago, were estimated at about L.6000, a great deal of wood has "since 
been blown down by repeated storms, and not a little cut down by 
thinning. 

The woods generally consist of pine and larch, several of which 
last description have attained to a great size ; the soil seeming 
to be well adapted to them.

but would probably suffer nothing by being still farther thinned. 

Rent.—T\iQ average of rent for arable land may run from L,l, 
5s. to L. 1, 15s. per imperial acre. Some of the best land may be 
rated ac fully L.3, lOs. per acre, while some of the inferior ground 
will bring more than lOs. the imperial acre. 

In the course of this season, several pretty large farms belong- 
' ing to this estate, have been relet at nearly triple their former 
I rent; thus, one of them which formerly rented at L.80 Sterling 
I and 16 bolls of oatmeal, is now let at L.300 Sterling per annum

Live-Stock.—E.arA\y any sheep are kept in the parish. A good , 
set of horses is maintained for agriculture. They are partly reared 
in the parish, and partly brought from the west ; and the Angus 
breed of cattle prevails.

poultry, L.3, 18s. • i • u 

About 3000 imperial lbs. of butter may be made m the parish, 
which at lOd. per lb. will yield L. 125. About 350 stones of 
cheese may be sold at a low price, or from 4s. to 6s. per stone, 
sav 5s., average L.87, 10s. There may likewise be sold about 
200 dozen of eggs, which, on an average of 9d. per dozen, will give 

L.7, 10s.  ' , ... 

Improvements, Sfc.-A considerable part of the haugh land was 
recovered about twenty years ago. The general duration of leases 
is about nineteen years. But some inclosures of grass-land have 
been lately let for cropping for a course of five years, and, at the 
end of this short lease must be sown out. The farm-buildings are, 
in general, in an ordinary state of repair, and the mclosures are 
some good, others indifferent. Part of the land is inclosed with 
stone dikes, part with thorn hedges, and another portion conti- 

nues still open. , • .i i 

Fishings.— Some salmon are fished by the rod in the Esk, 
and trout taken in the same manner in the Noran ; but there is no 
regular fishing for salmon with the net. 

V. Parochial Economy. 

Market-Toions, §-c.— Our nearest market-town is Brechin, dis- 
tant four miles. t-, \ • a 
One daily coach for the use of passengers between Breclun and 
Forfar, passes here daily. There is likewise a statute-labour road 
between Brechin and Kirriemuir that passes through the upper 
pan of this parish, kept in tolerable order. There is a bridge con- 
sisting of one flat low arch over the Noran.

Ecclesiaatical State.— The parish church is conveiiiently situated 
for the population ; its site being centrical, and not more than a 
mile distant from the remotest dwelling-house. 

The church was built on the erection of the parish in 1636 ; 
and had a tolerable repair in 1808. 

At the erection of the parish, the patron mortified a sum of 
money, the interest of which was especially for the behoof of the 
clergyman serving the cure in all time coming. This sum was 
4000 merks Scots, or L.222, 4s. 5d. Sterling, and the interest 
arising therefrom is L.ll, 2s. 2id., which is now considered as 
forming a portion of the present money stipend. Likewise, during 
the present minister's incumbency, L.250 were bequeathed by 
the late David Skene, Esq., merchant in London, and brother 
to the late George Skene, Esq, in aid of the funds of the kirk-ses- 
sion. 

The church of Careston would afford ample accommodation 
for all the parishioners, were they considerably more numerous 
than they are, as the sittings have been constructed for about 
200 hearers, and all the seats are free. The kirk-session formerly 
was considered as having a right to two seats in the church, and, 
as proprietors, drew rent for them ; but no rent has been exacted 
since the incumbency of the present minister. 

The manse was built in the year 1802, just two years after the 
present minister entered on this charge. It received a small ad- 
dition about three years ago. The offices were well repaired in 
the autumn 1842. The glebe consists of about ten statute acres, 
and may be considered worth about L.l, 5s. per acre. 

The stipend is one of those termed the small livings, being 
L. 150 Sterling. It is, however, a little more, as part of it is paid 
in grain. It consists as follows : 37 bolls, 3 firlots, and 2 pecks 
of oatmeal ; 23 bolls and 2| pecks of bear or big, or equal to 61 
bolls and 3 lippies of grain. Money stipend from the Careston 
estate, L.24, 14s. 3d. ; from the Exchequer, L.8-2, 19s. 2d. ; 
total of money stipend, L.107, 13s. 5d. 

Besides the above stipend, there are also paid to the incumbent 
4 bushels and 2 pecks of barley from the lands of Balhall, an es- 
tate in the adjoining parish of Menmore, as an equivalent for a 
servitude over a piece of moor ground. This, like the victual sti- 
pend, being converted at the fiar prices of the county, varies con- 
siderably.

with the exception of two or three Dissenters and one Roman 
Catholic. There is, in general, a good attendance on Divine ser- 
vice. The average number of communicants falls little short of . 
100. 

Education.— The school is well taught. The teacher has 
the legal accommodations, and the maximum salary, viz. L.3i, 4s. 
4d. pe°r annum; school fees, L.18 annually on an average ; emo- 
lument of the session clerkship on an average, L.2 ; total, L.54, 
4s. 4d. There is also a private school taught by a female, 
in which instruction is afforded in reading English, needle-work, 
and knitting. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The whole annual amount of con- 
tributions for the relief of the poor, is about L.21 ; of which, 
about L. 8, 10s. is collected in the church ; the remainder con- 
sists of the savings of former times, together with the interest of 
a sum of money bequeathed to the session, as before-mentioned, 
by the late David Skene, Esq. In all, the sessional fund amounts 
to L. 330 Sterling. 

The average number of persons receiving parochial aid is from 
six to seven ; and the sums allotted vary from L. 2, 2s. to L. 4, 
10s. ; besides which, small sums are frequently given, when requi- 
site. Independent of the above assistance afforded to ordinary pa- 
rochial paupers, and of L. 3 annually to a blind man who has a 
legal claim on this parish, of late the session has to pay L. 6 an- 
nually as board for a foundling. There is also commonly raised 
yearly, in the way of extraordinary contribution, from L.3 to L.4 in 
aid of some charitable or religious institution.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNDEE, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. SAMUEL MILLER, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Boundaries, Sfc. — Monifieth, anciently wi-itten Monie- 
fuith, Monefuit, and Monefut, is a word of Celtic origin, signify- 
ing " the moss of the stag." This name must have been descrip- 
tive in former times ; for though there is now no " moss," the 
sandy links along the frith cover a deep stratum of it, in which 
deer's horns have been dug up in considerable numbers: and 
here, according to tradition, David 1. had a favourite hunting-seat. 

The parish is of an irregular oblong shape, stretching from 
south to north— the length being about 5 miles, and the breadth 
varying from to 3| ; and containing about 9 square miles. It 
is bounded on the south by the Frith of Tay ; on the east, by the 
parishes of Barry and Monikie ; on the north, by Monikie ; and 
on the west, by Murroes and Dundee. The parish slopes g'radu- 
; ally up from the Tay to its northern extremity, being intersected 
I in the middle by a range of inconsiderable eminences, partly cul- 
' tivated and partly planted. The highest eminence is at the 
northern extremity, 500 feet above the level of the sea. The 
I extent of coast is about 3i miles ; it is low and sandy, and the sea 
IS, year by year, making inroads upon it, owing to the double ef- 
I feet of the winds blowing away the sand and raising the tide. 

Climate, 4-c.— The climate towards the south is so mild and 
uniform as to be considered one of the most agreeable in Forfar- 
shire ; and the earhness of the crops is always conspicuous. This 
district IS also peculiarly healthful. Epidemic diseases seldom rage 
in It, and many of the inhabitants attain to very advanced age. 
Ihe climate of the northern district is much colder, owing to its 
greater elevation and the nature of the soil. The stream of the 
iighty, after intersecting the parish towards the west, disembogues 
into the Tay. Although of no great size, it is valuable on account

of the mills and works on it. Salmon formerly frequented it; but 
the bleaching ley has effectually scared them away, as well as 
greatly thinned the numbers and deteriorated the quality of the ■ 
excellent trout in which it previously abounded. 

Soil.— Ri&amp;wg somewhat abruptly from the links on the south, 
and extending to the eminences in the middle of the parish, lies a 
tract of land of the richest description, and highly cultivated, pro- 
ducing heavy crops of every kind, and drawing rents equally heavy. 
The northern district labours under the disadvantage of a cold and 
tilly subsoil ; but extensive draining is ameliorating both soil and 
climate, so that the crops produced yield a fair average return to 
the cultivator. 

Mineralogy. — Towards the south, a whinstone rock prevails ; 
but along the northern boundary, runs an excellent seam of pave- 
ment, obviously the same as that which appears at Auchterhouse, 
Carmyllie, Turin, Kinblethmont, &amp;c. One quarry of it is wrought 
in this parish, with much advantage, on the estate of Well-bank, 
and two others might probably be opened, — one on the estate of 
Omachie, the other on the estate of Kingennie. The Well-bank 
or Legsland quarry must have been in operation for nearly 300 
years, as appears from the following entry in the sessional record : 
" 3d June 1574, Donald Robartsone in Laigislande fand ye Lard 
of Umoquhy cation, yt, gif ye witnesses convicks hym, he sail pay 
ane thousande sklaittis." 

Zoology. — During particular seasons swans, eider-ducks, great 
northern divers, and other rare aquatic birds visit our coast. Se- 
veral pairs of that beautiful bird, the stock-gannet, yearly build on 
the links. Quail also used formerly to be plentiful there, but 
have now totally disappeared. The starling in the south, and the 
goat-sucker in the woods towards the north, are not uncommon. 
It is worthy of remark, that, about ten years before the publica- 
tion of the former Statistical Account, haddocks began to leave 
this coast, till at last they totally deserted it ; but now all kinds 
of white fish are caught in abundance. Herrings used to be 
plentiful in the frith ; but, for a series of years, they also have 
deserted it. They, however, seem to be returning, as great num- 
bers have been caught upon the coast this season. During neap- 
tides, at the proper season, a small but excellent crab is gathered 
among some shelving rocks in the river, opposite the village of 
Monitieth ; and, on a bank at the mouth of the estuary, called 
" Drumley sands," a coarse shell- tish, named " Drumley buckies,

is abundant. It is eaten by some, but chiefly used by fishermen 
as bait. Porpoises and seals are common. 

II. — Civil History. 
Heritors. — The heritors of the parish are twelve in number, of 
whom the chief are Lord Panmure, Mr Erskine of Linlathen, Sir 
James Ramsay, &amp;c. 

Monifieth was originally a seat of the Culdees ; and, when the 
old church was pulled down in 1812, and the foundations of the 
present house excavated, some remains of the Culdee edifice were 
discovered. Towards the end of the tvtelfth century, Gilbert, 
third Earl of Angus, gifted the church of Monifieth with those of 
Murroes, Kirrymuir, and Strathdichty, to the Abbey of Arbroath. 
The Culdees of Monifieth seem to have resisted this annexation 
for a time; for in the year 1225, we find Malcolm fifth Earl of 
Angus and his daughter Matilda repeating the grant. The Coun- 
tess Matilda also added, apparently as an alms-gift of her own, 
the whole land on the south side of the church, which, during the 
lifetime of her father, was held by the Culdees. Thereafter Moni- 
fieth continued to be a dependent church of the abbey till the Re- 
formation. Indeed, a large yearly revenue was drawn from it ; for 
the rent-roll of the abbey's book of assumptions states the valua- 
tion of the church to have been in the year 1531 as follows: 
Money, 23 lib. 13s. 4d. ; wheat, 5 chalders ; bear, 11 chalders, 
11 bolls; meal, 15 dhalders, 11 bolls; salmon, 14 barrels. At 
the visitation of the monasteries, however, in 1.501-2, by the com- 
missioners of Privy- Council, the revenues from Monifieth are 
stated thus : wheat, 4 chalders, 12 bolls ; bear, 12 chalders, 9 bolls ; 
meal, 15 chalders, 10 bolls. 

In the flourishing days of the Papacy, the parish consisted of 
: four distinct chapelries ; 1. Monifieth, where the present church 
is situated. 2. Broughty, where the remains of the chapel are 
still visible on the boundary between this parish and that of Dun- 
dee. Within the memory of man, a considerable part of the fa- 
I bnc remained ; but the stones having been found useful for build- 
I ing gradually disappeared, so that little more is now left besides 
the foundation. The circumjacent cemetery, however, is still in 
"se. .3. Eglhmonichtxj of which the etymology seems to be ec~ 
c/ma monlis Dkhty, situated on a crag above the river Dichty 
■ nearly opposite the Mill of Balmossie. This chapel, long previ' 
I ously ruinous, was razed about eighty years ago-the mill just no- 
ticed built out of the materials, the cemetery ploughed up the 
oones buried, and a circle of trees eradicated, with the exception

of one vcMierable plane, which still marks the site. It seems pro- 
bable that this was the church of Strathdichty granted with Mo- 
nifieth to Arbroath by Gilbert, Earl of Angus, as above-men- 
tioned ; and if so, it is doubtless the same as appears on the Ab- 
bey's roll of dependent churches under the designation of the pa- 
rish of Strathechtin.—4. Kxngennie, in the northern district of the 
presentparish, is also mentioned in the same roll as oneof the thirty- 
four churches belonging to the Abbey. The ruinous remains of 
it were removed about twelve years ago, during repairs made on 
the farm steading and stackyard now occupying its site. To these 
four might be added a fifth, once situated in a field at Ethie- 
beatou, known by the name of " Chapel Dockie." Perhaps, how- 
ever, this may have been only a private place of worship attached 
to the castle which anciently stood here, and which tradition con- 
nects with the name of Cardinal Beaton. When these four re- 
lioious houses were united into one parish, has not been ascer- 
tained, further than that it must have been before the Reformation 

in 1560. , 

. Parochial Registers.— The parochial registers have, with some 
exceptions, been regularly kept for a period of 282 years ;-.n 
short, thev commence at the date of the Reformation. They con- 
sist of twelve large volumes,-one containing the sessional records 
of about twenty years near the beginning of last century, having 
been lost, though referred to in another volntne as extant in 1/by. 
It is lo be regretted that the oldest volume is considerably da- 
maged in some places, and several leaves are wantmg. 1 he ear- 
liest separate register of births and marriages begins m July 164 J. 
Betrl this period, baptisms and marriages are regularly engrossed 
in the weekly record of sessional proceedings. 

This curious archive commences with a title which is mucli tat- 
tered ; but the first entry is partly legible, as follows : In Ap.-yl 
ye VI day, 1560, The qlk day, it is appyntit yt our assembl of 

ye kyrk of Monefut Sonday at twa efternnn at ve k,k 

It prayer unto God for his assistans \° ''''I 

be fordrans to his gloir, and subpressing of Satan and . . • • • • 
will be observed, that the tenor of this entry is simiU. to that 
th bond executed at Perth in the previous year by the re or.- 
ino congregations of Perth, Fife, Angus, and Mearns,-an o«g 
r will be remembered, that the congregations m and about 
n ;1 .re Specially mentioned by historians. It would appear 
" t the zrofhe people hal been directed against the edi- 



MONIFIETH. 543 



fice of the Popish church here, and that it had undergone a dis- 
manthng similar to that which overtlirew more stately fabrics ; for 
the second entry is to this effect : ' Ye quhylk day it is thoicht 
necesser be us yat he hous of prayer be mendit in haist, yat God 
may be glorafeit yair, — ye expensis to be tayn uquolie of ye assem- 
blie." Two circumstances seem to account for the people of this 
parish embracing the Reformation so heartily and so early ; Isif, 
The proximity of Monifieth to Dundee, in and around which 
George Wishart preached much and successfully ; 2d, Durham 
of Grange, the most influential individual in the district, and living 
on the spot, was a zealous Protestant, and a near relation of the 
celebrated superintendent of Angus,— John Erskine of Dun. 
Erskine, indeed, lived frequently at Grange; and, according to 
tradition, had, at one time, a narrow escape there from Govern- 
ment emissaries sent to capture him. We may infer, therefore, 
that, during these visits, this zealous reformer organized the con- 
gregation of Monifieth, and that Durham was his hearty assistant 
in the work. And we know farther, that John Knox lived much 
with Erskine at this period, visiting and confirming with him those 
who were favourably inclined to Protestantism ,• so that it is not 
unreasonable to suppose, that Papacy was overthrown in Moni- 
fieih by the master hand of the Reformer himself. 

Though some leaves are wanting near the beginning of the re- 
cord, we find tht a Protestant minister officiated statedly here be- 
fore the end of the year 1562 ; nor was the parish vacant for any 
length of time as many others were from that date to this. The 
present incumbent is the fifteenth in regular succession from the

From 1570, down tbrougb at least a century, sucb entries as the

In 1668, the session exercised a civil power, by taking a precognition 
on a case of child murder, and prosecuted the woman " befor the 
bailzie of Kerrimure, the parioch of Monifuith being wtin that 
regalitie, and did put a guard upon her till she was fitte to be 
transported there." In 1705, a similar authority was exercised; 
but, in this latter case, the culprit was sent to Edinburgh. Such 
entries as the ensuing are very common : " 12th July 1640, He- 
len Scott ordeanit and actit for her oflPence of sclander, to keip 
ye preiching dayly ; to sitt dayly in ane visible pairt, qr ye minr

paroche, if ever she beis fund to sclaunder any of her nio-hbours 
heirefter, or to flytt with thame." The following appears more 
salutary than practicable: 5th Apryll 1646, It is actit, that 
whosoevir hen-efter sail be fund to drink in aill-houses, bying or 
selhng, to remaine longer nor a pynt aill or chapin aiU the hand 
sail pay twa dolors." In 1649, we find Thomas Crawford, quar- 
ter- master to the General's Life-Guard, after much contumacy, 
obliged to undergo a severe discipline, for challenging the Laird 
of Omachie to single combat. In December 1649, an individual 
was subjected to double discipline, for coming " to ye place of re- 
pentance wt his sword about, and putting on his bonnett." 

Perhaps the most interesting entry of all unfortunately much 
torn ,s a long account of the " subscryving" of the Solemn Leaaue 
and Covenant in 1648. Indeed, the whole record, and the oldest 
volume m especial, is full of amusing and curious information, be- 
sides throwmg much valuable light on the history of the district, 
he manners of the people, the state of wealth, the value of la- 
hour, &amp;c. &amp;c. 

Antiquities -\J,on the hill of Laws, near the middle of the 
 parish, are the remains of an ancient vitrified fort. A low wall f 
■ seems to have encircled the whole top of the hill, which is flat, 
' 1-0 yards m length, by 66 in breath. The hill itself is a green 
cone, terminating a long ridge. At the bottom of this cone, 
spear-heads of n-on, with bones of men and horses, have latel

been dwr up. Abdut fifty years ago, two workmen came upon 
the foundation of a building, at the bottom of the cone, and found 
a considerable treasure of gold coin. They concealed their pme, , 
svent to London, and sold it as bullion. The circumstance after- 
wards came to hght by the jealousy of one of the hnders, who ac 
cnsed his comrade of cheating him, as he had received only L.oO 
as his share of the booty, whereas he had on inquiry, discovered 
that the moietv was far more valuable. Of course it .s not known 
that any of the coins were preserved. A mile to the west of La vs 
is the GallowhiU of Ethiebeaton, where it is said that feudal jus- 
tice was executed in former times. Tumuli, rude stone-coffins 
Ind human bones, have been found around .t. A ltle north 
from Linlathen is a large heap of stones called " Cairn Greg. 
A local chieftain, famous in ancient Scottish story, is said to have 
fallen in battle here. His name was Greg or Gregory ; and the 
place of his residence, near CoUiston, in the parish of St Vi- 
geans, is still known by the name of " Castle Gory.' _ Numerous 
other cairns within the circuit of a mile around the principal one 
,nark the burial-place of the other slain. On the top o a smaU 
knoll near Kingennie, is an interesting relic of antiquity cal ed 
« St Bride's ring." It consists of a circle of stones large blocks 
formino- the outer rim, and smaller boulders the inner, about 60 
feet in°diameter. On the eastern side is an entrance several feet 
in width, having somewhat the appearance of regular masonry; 
but the blocks are wholly unchiselled. It seems to have been  
place of worship ; but who St Bride was is not known ; only it is 
thought that the neighbouring parish of Panbnde received its name 
from the same saint. A few yards north of the g ebe, lies a huge 
block of stone, supposed four' tons weight, having a square 
excavation in the middle, in which formerly stood a kind 
of obelisk.' This shaft was broken at a remote period. Af- 
terwards, it was brought down to the church, to replace h. 
lintel of the « queer" door, and, by this means, was mutilated 
still more to bring it into shape. It is now built into the fron 
wall of the new church. No trace of its origin or object can be 
discovered. The side now exposed to view is covered with human 
tures rudely carved in low relief, of which the most entire is 
kvid pLving' on the harp. Attached to the old queer above- 
mentioned, was an elegant mauso eum of Durham o P k r 
..argentarius" to James VI. All the stones of it on which t e 
was any inscription, are built into the present church. Beside.

this, a great part of the present cliiircli is built of the materials of 
the old abbey of Balmerino. That ediKee was dismantled, and 
the stones shipped down the Tay, by the second Lord Balmerino, 
for the purpose of repairing the old church of MoniHeth; his ob- 
ject being to save expense, as he was the chief heritor in the pa- 
rish. 

Broughty Castle, situated on a point of rock projecting into 
the Tay, near the western boundary of the parish, is an ancient 
place of strength, well adapted for commanding the river, which 
is here only a mile broad, but stretches out to a much greater 
width both above and below it. The ruins spread over a consi- 
derable extent; but the only part of the building now remainino- 
IS a large square keep, at present used as a signal tower by the 
coast-guard. Boece mentions the existence of this stronghold 
in 1492 ; but the date of its erection is not-known. After the 
victory at Musselburgh, 10th September 1547, the English gar- 
risoned this castle, as the key of the Tay. In a short time, the 
Regent Arran besieged it; but, after much loss, durino- three 
months' ineffectual effort, abandoned the attempt, leavin" James 
Hahburton, the youthful and brave provost of Dundee, °to keep 
watch, and prevent provisions being carried to the aarrison Next 
vear the Earl of Argyle made a desperate but fruitless assault on 
the place. Thereafter, Monsieur D'Essy, who commanded the 
Scottish army, made a third attempt at its reduction, with similar 
ill success ; and it was not till the beginning of 1550, that it was 
stormed and carried by De Thermes, commander of the allied 
army of Scotch, French, and Germans. The fortification was 
immediately dismantled; but we find that, towards the end of the

eentury, the Master of Gray inhabited the castle as a dwelhng 
house. After the death of Lady Gray, who lived in it for a con- 
siderable period, it was altogether abandoned. On Fort-Inll, about 
half a mile north-west from Broughty Castle, was a ort erected 
bv the English after Arran's siege in 1548, as a flanking post of 
their principal garrison, which it was w-ell f J. 
eount of its commanding situation. The works of this fortificaUon 
were also demolished in 1550. Not more than sixty years ago 
according to the testimony of old residenters, the wall remained 
in some places twelve feet high ; but, within these twenty years 
the nloughshare has passed over the site More lately a de p 
draw-well was discovered on the top of the hill, and several bullets, 
• pieces of cannon, &amp;c. were found at the bottom Ihe camp, on 
he same ridge as Fort-hill, and rather more than a quaver o a 
mile east from it, seems either to have been an outpost of the 
castle or an encampment of the besiegers. Few traces of its in-

The rapid increase during late years is doubtless owing to the 
recent springing into existence of the village of Broughty Ferry, 
and to the extension into the country of the trade of Dundee; and 
from both causes it may be inferred, that the increase will still 
proceed in a large ratio. For, in addition to the public works 
which have of late been set in operation, others have been con- 
templated should trade revive ; while the railroad from Dundee 
to Arbroath, which passes through the whole breadth of the pa- 
rish, promises to increase the traffic of the district, and the num- 
ber of houses along the line. Indeed, Lord Panmure has begun 
to grant ninety-nine years building leases on the links of Barn- 
hill, which begin already to increase the population. And, should 
commerce improve, doubtless many of the citizens of Dundee will 
be glad to exchange the smoke and bustle of the town for the 
freshness and retirement of a country villa, from which the rail- 
road will transport them, at almost every hour, to their business 
and counting-rooms in fifteen minutes. The situation, the cli- 
mate, the abundance of excellent springs, the comparative cheap- 
ness of the soil, and the many facilities of the locality, conspire 
to render almost certain the anticipation, that a large and respec- 
table population will soon be set down on what is at present only 
a sheep-walk and a rabbit-warren. 

The population is at present thus divided ; in Broughty Ferry, 
1980; in Monifieth, 250; in Drumsturdy, 190; and in the coun- 
try, 1041. 

Average births per annum, 75; average marriages per do. 27. 

On the whole, the inhabitants are a moral and industrious 
people; and, though in some instances the public works have in- 
troduced their attendant evils of profligacy and drunkenness, the 
contagious example has not spread among' the rest of the parish- 
ioners. Few have come to years without an ordinary education; 
intellectual attainment is obviously prized and advancino-. The

smuggling of foreign liquors, tobacco, &amp;c. along the coast was un- 
fortunately too common within these thirty years past, but is now 
vholly unknown. Surer and honester methods of acquirmg a live- ' 
lihood are now adopted, as much from choice as from necessity; 
so that a competency is enjoyed by most, and even nches, ac- 
cording to their station, have been amassed by many of the m- 

babitants. , mi i

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture.— The number of imperial acres in the parish is 
6054. Of these there are, , 

Under cultivation, . 4574 acres. 
Pasture chiefly links, 926' 
. Wood planted, . 554 

The rent of the best land may be stated at L.3, 10s. per acre, 
though some is let at above L.4 ; that of the worst at L.l per 
acre. The valued rent, extracted from the valuation roll of the 
county, published in 1823, is L.5941, 13s. 4d.; but the actual 
rent may be about L.9500. The sessional record mentions, that, 
in 1633, an assessment being made for the reparation of the kwk, 
the number of ploughs in the parish was 48. Every thing consi- 
dered, this shows that not much more than one-third of the land 
now cultivated was at that time under the plough. 

The whole of the reclaimable land in the parish is now under 
tillage, all the rest being either planted, or sandy links, which can 
hardly be improved. The large farms on nineteen years leases 
vary from 100 to 300 acres. There are, besides two or three 
smaller farms, numerous pendicles of from five to fifteen acres. 
The possessors of these in some instances pursue other trades, or 
employ the spare power of their horses in cartage, &amp;c. tor hire. 
Thev generally keep a number of cows out of proportion to their 
lands, by buying in grass, turnips, and fodder; and they find con- 
siderable profit from the sale of milk, butter, and cheese in Dun- 
dee or among their manufacturing neighbours who can keep no 
dair'y. Several of the large farmers also find it advantageous o 
keep extensive dairies for the supply of the Dundee market, send- 
in/the milk, either sweet or skimmed, into town once a daj m 
summer, and twice a week in winter. Less stock is thus reared 
in the parish than might be expected, and sheep  is al 

most unknown. Monifieth has long been famous for its po a oe , 
and there is a considerable trade in planting them earl lor

Fisheries. — All along the coast salmon-fishing is pursued. The 
value of the fishings have much decreased of late years, owing 
chiefly to the judicial prevention of stake-nets and sole-nets. 
Common-haul or cobble-nets only can now be legally used. About 
thirty hands are employed ; and, though the season opens in the 
beginning of February, little is done till the beginning of April. 
About twenty years ago, the rent of the fishings was L,1500, when 
729 fish have been known to be got during a tide at one station. 
The rent at last letting was L.325, and the above number of fish 
will hardly be got at one station during the whole season. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce annually 
raised in the parish is as follows : —

Manufactures.— "Neymg is carried on to a considerable extent 
m the parish, it being a kind of trade with some to bring the yarn 
from Dundee, apportion it to the weavers around, receive back 
the webs, and carry them to Dundee. 

There is a large spinning-mill at the mouth of the Dio-hty dri- 
ven partly by water and partly by steam. When in full operation 
Jt employs 130 hands. Half a mile farther up the river is an ex. 
tensive bleachmg work, giving employment at present to 90 work 
people; but, when enlarged according to the present intention of 
the proprietors, it will employ double that number. A smaller 
bleaching work on the river stands idle and unfinished ; and besides 
the.se other works are talked of, which, if trade prosper, will as- 
suredly go on. r r J

active operation. About 100 hands are employed. The business 
carried on is chiefly the making of machinery for spinning-mills. 
The village has also a cart and plough manufactory, of long es- 
tablished repute. 

In Broughty Ferry an establishment for curing cod prepares 
400 fish per week for exportation, when the season is favourable. 
Here also are two roperies, and a foundry, besides breweries, bake- 
houses, &amp;c. and the several manufactories common in a large 
village. 

Several tanneries, a fulling-mill, a lintseed-oil-mill, a bleach- 
field on the old system, and a thread-mill, which were in opera- 
tion during last century, have been discontinued for upwards of 
forty vears. 

Navigation.— Ye have no regular harbour in this parish ; but 
coal and lime vessels of small tonnage deliver their cargoes all 
along the coast,— the receding tide leaving them dry on the slop- 
ing sandy beach. Small vessels are occasionally built at Broughty 
Ferry, where the nature of the shore permits them to be launched 
at once into deep water. Indeed, on account of the depth of wa- 
ter, and the natural shelter which would be afforded for shipping, 
the' construction of a harbour there, for the larger vessels engag- 
ed in the Dundee trade, has often been spoken of as easy, desir- 
able, and likely to be gone into at no distant period. And as the 
rallwav passes along the very brink of the river, perhaps this may 
be a cause of the speedy effectuation, of the project. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
The market-town is Dundee, from which the remotest part of 

the parish is not distMt more than seven miles. A half-yearly 
' market for cattle, horses, &amp;c. used to be held at Monifieth, and 

the semblance of it is still kept up. Within these thirty years it 

was of considerable importance; but of late it has dwindled into 

nothing. . . . n , oonn 

Broughty-Ferry is a large village, containing m all nearly 2200 

inhabitants, situated chiefly in this parish, though a small part be- 
longs to the parish of Dundee. Fifty years ago it consisted of 
about half-a-dozen fishermen's huts; but the proprietor having 
beoun to feu about the year 1790, it started at once into a consi- 
derable town, and is still rapidly increasing It presents a c ean 
and neat appearance ; and from the river the view of the vil age 
in front, with the villas of the more wealthy on the sloping back- 
ground is very picturesque. The streets, most unaccountably, 



MONIFIETH. 



553 



are neitlier paved nor Macadamized, so that the blowing of the 
line sand on which the village is built, is very disagreeable in dry 
weather. This place is much resorted to in the summer months 
as bathing-quarters; indeed, the population, during three months 
in the year, is greatly increased from this cause; and many of the 
inhabitants, who have rooms or flats to let, mainly depend on this 
for their support. Dundee is chiefly supplied with white fish from 
Broughty Ferry. Thirteen boats, having each at an average six 
men for a crew, are statedly employed in this branch of industry ; 
but during summer, the number of boats employed is considerably 
greater. Upwards of fifty families depend for support on the white- 
tishing. Haddock, cod, ling, flounders, soles, whiting, plaice, 
skate, and turbot, are the fish commonly or occasionally caught; 
but for two months in summer, most of the fishermen, in larger 
boats for the purpose, are engaged in the herring fishery on the 
northern coasts of Scotland. In the Dundee Police Act, there is 
a provision for a police to Broughty Ferry ; but as yet it has never 
been acted on, though there is good reason for some establishment 
oi' the kind. For instance, steam-boats, during the summer months, 
bring down an inundation of the worst population of Dundee on 
the Sabbath day. Hence drunkenness and riot, in spite of all 
moral exertions to put a stop to the evil, are too common on a 
day set apart for holy rest ; and that, too, in a locality where the 
inhabitants, in general, respect and prize Divine ordinances. There 
is a penny-post from Dundee to Broughty Ferry. It is carried by 
a foot-runner, who goes twice a-day, the distance being four miles 
The turnpike road from Dundee to Arbroath transects the pa- 
risli towards its southern extremity. On this road one mail passes 
south and another north every day. Three other coaches used 
to run on this road, but the opening of the railway some years 
since has put a stop to them all. The public road from Dundee to 
Brechin skirts the north-western boundary of the parish ; and about 
twenty miles of parish roads some of which are very indifi"erently 
kept facilitate communication throughout the district. As already 
alluded to, the railway from Dundee to Arbroath passes through, 
this parish coastwise for nearly three miles. On account of the 
level nature of the line, the facilities granted by the extensive- 
proprietor, through whose estate it chiefly passes, and for other 
reasons unnecessary to be detailed, it is supposed this is the 
cheapest railway in Britain, as assuredly it is of the utmost 



654 



FORFARSHIRE. 



advantage to the interests of the country. By it an additional mail 
is carried south and north daily. 

Ecclesiastical Stae.— The parish church stands on the brink of 
the Tay, at the southern extremity of the parish, and is conse- 
quently rather inconveniently situated for a considerable proper- 
tion of the population ; but it is well set down for the contemplated 
increase along the line of the railway. It was built in 1813, is in 
good repair, is seated for 1 100 hearers, but will contain 1200 with 
ease. Now that 2000 of the population have been taken away by 
the Broughty Ferry chapel, it is much too large for the parish ; 
and yet it is believed that, in a few years, it will be found small 
enough; for, exclusive of the Ferry district, the population of the 
original parish has increased upwards of 400 since that chapel was 
erected fifteen years ago. In the old church, what was called " the 
common loft" belonged to the session, in lieu of which several pews 
have been given to the session in the new church. All the rest are the 
property of the heritors, and given by them to their tenants. The 
manse is a commodious house, and was built in 1 829. The glebe 
consists of four and a-half acres of excellent land. The stipend 
amounts to 17 chalders of victual half meal, half barley, with 
L 10 for communion elements. The only benefaction now extant 
is a mortification of L.lOO Scots yearly, payable from Grange 
partly as a bursary for poor scholars, and partly for the behoof of 

the poor's funds. 

As hinted above, the village of Broughty Ferry, with a small 
landward territory around it, was, in 1834, erected into a parish 
ecclesiastical, having been previously the district attached to the 
chapel of ease there. This chapel was built in 182G, and a mi- 
nister was ordained to the charge in 1827. The election of the 
minister is vested in " the male sitters, being communicants A 
bond, given to the Presbytery, secures L. 120 of annual sti- 
pend to the minister. But when the debt is liquidated this will be 
increased. The sources whence the stipend is derived are, the 
seat-rents, and six annual collections made at the church door in 
behalf of the funds of the institution. The chapel is seated for 
720 ■ but 300 more seats would be required to meet the wants ot 
the population. For several months in summer, especially when 
the village is filled with sea-bathers, the want of church accommo- 
dation is very painfullv felt. No manse, glebe, or endowment ot 
any kind is attached t this church. The Rev. Dav.d Davidson 
is the present incumbent.

There is a Dissenting chapel in Broughty Ferry. It was built 
by Mr Haldane, but is now the property of Mr Erskiue of Lin- 
lathen, and given by him to be used as a place of worship in con- 
nection with the United Associate Synod of the Secession Church. 
There is, however, no fixed pastor at present ; nor has there been 
for some time. 

The distribution of the population among the various Christian 
denominations is as follows :

and the number of communicants in connection with the Establish- 
ment is about 1300. 

A parochial Bible and Missionary Society, established many 
years ago, has some years since been cut down into two, — one in 
Monifieth, and one in Broughty Ferry, — by which the schemes in 
which the Church of Scotland has embarked are specially supported. 

Education. — The total number of schools in the parish worth 
mentioning, Sabbath schools not included, is eight; viz. one 
parochial ; three supported wholly by Mr Erskine of Linlathen 
two female schools in the parish of Monifieth, the other, an infant 
school in Broughty Ferry ; two partially endowed, the others on 
the teachers' own adventure. There is besides an excellent school 
in connection with the church of Broughty Ferry ; but it is situated 
just beyond the boundary of the civil parish of Monifieth. The ave,- 
rage number of scholars yearly is 490 ; and it may be said ge- 
nerally, that most of the children who ought to be at school are 
sent to it, and that the benefits of education are known and appre- 
ciated. The parochial schoolmaster has the legal accommodations 
on a very comfortable scale. His salary is L.25, ISs. 4d. per an- 
num, and his school-fees average about L.35 more. 

It is important to notice the exertions made by the Church of 
Scotland in behalf of education during all her history, but especi- 
ally before schools were endowed by the authority of Government 
in every parish. The sessional record gives some interesting in- 
formation on this head, regarding what was done in Monifieth.

The parish appears to have had a "reidar" from the period of 
the Reformation ; and though it is not expressly said, some entries 
would lead us to infer that ho acted in the capacity of schoolmas- 
ter also. At any rate, on the 18th November 1599, " Mr Tho- 
mas Zouno- was electit schoolmaister w cosent of ye hadl assem- 
blie •" and, on the 16th March 1600, the following provision was 
made for bis maintenance icw, becaus ye guid restan of ye

either an inadequate aliment, or it was ill paid ; for, as a result of 
tbe act of Privy- Council in 1616 whicb, unfortunately, was never 
properly implemented, ordaining every parish to maintain a scbool- 
Lster, we find the following:-" 14 Dec. 1617. The sessione

A regular schoolroom, however, was not erected till 16a6, ti e 
Presbvterv of Dundee having previously perambulated tbe parish, 
and fixed upon a central site for it. When the school was remov- 
ed to tbe most uncentral locality of tbe village of Monifietb, where 
it now is,-is not known. A dwelling-bouse for tbe schoolmaster 
was not built till 1691. Indeed, until 1696, when parochial 
cbools were finally establisbed by tbe Legislature, those who held 
tbe office of teacber in the parisb appear to have been very inade- 
quately remunerated. One person resigned on the ground that

Literature. — Two parochial libraries are in operation. "I'liat 
iu Brouglity Ferry was instituted in 182, and contains upwards 
of 500 volumes ; that in Monifieth was instituted in 18S6, and 
contains upwards of 600 volumes. The readers in each are not 
so numerous as they ought to be and once were. 

There is no friendly society in the parish. ' One was attempted 
among the fishermen of Broughty Ferry ; but after a short and 
sickly existence, it has been broken up. Two savings banks one 
in Monifieth and the other in Broughty Ferry on the National 
Security system are succeeding more prosperously. In the 
Broughty Ferry branch there are L. 600 ; in Monifiethj L. 200. 

Poor.-lihe average number of persons regularly receiving pa- 
rochial aid is 40, besides occasional paupers ; and the average 
amount of supply to each is 6s. per month. The collections 
available for the poor, made at the doors of the two churches, 
average L. 80 per annum. A trifle more is realized from hearse 
and mortcloth dues ; but hitherto this income has been found in- 
adequate to meet the expenditure, so that the heritors have volun- 
tarily assessed themselves in order to defray it. It is to be lament- 
ed, that the independent spirit which formerly instigated many 
of the industrious poor to disdain parochial relief is fast wear- 



mg out. 



Inns. — In the Monifieth district of the parish there are five li- 
censed ale-houses ; but in the Broughty Ferry district, there are 
one hotel and twenty alehouses. 

Fuel. — The fuel used is sea-borne coal and brushwood ; for 
which last " birns," or the scorched stems of burnt furze, is a com- 
mon substitute among the poorer classes. Peats of an excellent 
quality used to be dug out of the links by " tirring" the sand to 
the depth of from four to eight feet. This was less laborious than 
might be imagined, as the stratum of moss when arrived at is often 
" twelve peats deep." This mode of obtaining fuel, however, was 
some time ago put a stop to by the proprietor, on account of the 
blowingof the loosened sand, and consequent destruction of the pas- 
ture which it occasioned. On a late occasion, in cutting a deep 
dram through the links, a canoe was discovered deeply imbedded 
in this stratum of moss, at least a mile from the shore; giving 
proof that the whole of the links from Monifieth to West-haven", 
forming an isosceles triangle, of which the base is five miles, and 
the perpendicular from the vertex to the base three miles, were 
at one time under water, and constituted part of the estuary of the

Tay. The etymology of the names of the places, situated on the 
steep brink rising above the links, unequivocally corroborates the 
same supposition.

PRESBYTERY OF MEIGLE, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. JOHN MOON, MINISTER. 



L_ Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Boundaries, §-c.— The name of the parish in old re- 
cords is Newtyld. Conjecture only is offered, that it may have 
originated from the gray slates, tyle, or tyld, as they may have 
beln called, found in hills in the parish ; a conjecture strength- 
ened by the fact of a place near Dunkeld, where slate-quarries 
are, having also the name of Newtyle. The parish is bounded 
on the south, by Lundie ; on the south-east and east, by Auch- 
terhouse and Nevay, of the united parishes of Eassie and Nevay ; 
on the north and west, by Meigle and Kettins parishes. 

Topographical Appearance.— The parish is a convenient one ui 
its locai arrangement, being rather more than two miles in direct 
line from south to north, and nearly the same extent from east 
to west On the south, it is hilly. The hills are named Kil- 
purnie, Hatton, Newtyle, Keillor, &amp;c., and range chiefly from east 
to west. They are not of great altitude, but verdant to their 
tops, producing good pasture, and forming valuable sheep-walks. 
The entrance to and outlet from Strathmore the great strath or 
valley in this direction, lies between the hills of Hatton and New- 
tyle commonly called the Glack of Newtyle. There is nothing 
in the pass itself particularly calculated to arrest the attention; 
but in coming northwards, the lover of landscape will be de- 
lighted with the view, suddenly bursting open before him, of 
the great and beautiful valley stretching far and wide below. 
From the northern base of the hilly part of the parish on the 
uth to its boundaries on the north, the general aspect is ol flat

There is a peat-moss in the south of the parish, which formerly 
lay in a swampy state, but is now in process of drainage. 

II. — Civil History. 
Antiquities. — Local names, such as Cliesterpark, probably from 
castra, seem to designate posts or stations of Roman troops, during 
their invasion of the country. There is a field so called on the 
high ground, near the village of Hill of Keillor. Tradition points 
out, in the north-west of the parish, Grahiime's Knowe, and 
King's Well, marking, it is said, the route of the usurper Mac- 
beth from his fortress on Dunsinane Hill northwards, before the 
Thane of Fife, and countenancing the legend respecting the mo- 
numental remains within the policies of Belmont Castle, in the 
parish of Meigle. Near Auchtertyre, a small village in the parish, 
there is a well, commonly called the Crew Well, and adjoining it, 
there are the evident remains of a camp, of square form, and of 
no great dimensions. In the Old Statistical Account, this en- 
campment is said to have been one of Montrose's army, during 
the civil wars. In a recent History of the Highlands and High- 
land Clans, notice is taken of the Earl of Crawford and his fol- 
lowers from Fife, having been in arms in the parish, which makes it 
questionable whether the entrenchment may not have been one of 
that body of troops. To the south of Auchtertyre, there was dis- 
covered, within the last forty years, one of those artificial subter- 
ranean caverns, supposed of Pictish construction. 

The Castle of Hatton, Halltoun, now in ruins, was built by 
Lawrence Lord Oliphant, 1575. It is finely situated on the north- 
west base of the Hill of Hatton, in the opening of the Glack 
which It commands, and affords a very extensive view of the 
strath. It appears to have been a fortified residence of very sub- 
: stantial workmanship. A short distance onwards, to the south, 
there ,s said to have been a castle, Baleraig, scarcely any traces 
of which now remam. About its site, some urns in a broken 
state were turned up by the plough, not many years ago. At a 
• short distance to the west of the village of Hill of Keillor, there 
.s a tumulus with a large standing-stone in it, evidently of great 
antiquity but concerning which tradition is silent. The stone 
has rude hieroglyphics on it. 

strJctur'' f" the Kirkton, there are two mounds of artificial 
' Z n"' "'"'''' butts.-monuments of olden 

FoaFAR ' considerably impaired.

has no more to count for of collections at Haltoun, save seven 
pounds, three shillings, and ten pennies," Scots money. 

The last mention made of the Bishop is of date 28th May 1710, 
stating his having preached the action sermon of that day on Ro- 
mans viii. 9. and the collection made to be L.I 1, 10s. Scots money. 
It is not, however, till I2th September 1719, that, after judicial 
procedure, we find the Presbyterian minister of the parish, as the 
record shows, granting receipt for the records, registers, church 
utensils, &amp;c., as being then given up to him and the kirk-session. 

In the beginning of the volume commencing 1717, there is an 
account given of occurrences during the blank period in the re- 
cords, from which it appears that, in the Rebellion of 1715, the 
minister of the parish was prevented by armed interference from 
preaching in the church, his house outrageously entered by sol- 
diers, himself threatened, and forced to " abscond" for a time. 

La7id- owners.— The Right Honourable Lord Wharncliffe is the 
principal heritor, and proprietor of nearly the whole of the parish. 
His residence, when in the country, is Belmont Castle, in the pa- 
rish of Meigle, Andrew Whitton, Esq. of Couston, and Patrick 
Miller, Esq. of Davidston, are the only other heritors. There 
is no resident heritor in the parish. Ballantyne or Bannatyne 
House, near the Kirkton, seems to have been, at no very remote 
period, occupied as a mansion-house. The plan on which this 
building was erected, appears not to have been completed.

1841, 612, 631, = 1263 

The increase of population has arisen from the erection of a 
new village in the parish. In 1832, a field of arable ground of 
about 15 imperial acres, the property of the Right Honourable 
I Lord Wharncliffe, was laid out on a regular plan, to be let in lots 
ior building, on leases for ninety-nine years. The railway from 
Dundee terminated, at the time, in this field. The site for the 
new village appeared an eligible one ; a number of building stances 
were disposed of in lots, consisting of from about 19 to 27 poles, 



5i2 



FORFAUSllIllE. 



at rates varying from about Is. 3cl. to 2s. per pole, and a neat vlL 
lage of considerable size soon arose, which now contains a popula- 
tion of 505 souls. 

Of the above population, 123 are householders, o these 79 
are niarried persons, 6 widowers, and 16 widows. Eighteen resi- 
dent leaseholders, included in the above number, now live in the 

''"of'the said householders, 96 belong to the Established Church, 
about 10 to the United Secession, 3 are Episcopalian, 2 Baptists, 
1 Glassite 1 Christian Union Church, 1 Roman Catholic; the 
remainder,' consisting of adults and heads of famihes,are not at pre- 
sert in communion with any church. There are 166 commum- 
cants of the Established Church in the village. 

The inhabitants of the village are chiefly agricultural labourers, 
iTianv of whom also work as weavers when circumstances require. 

A chapel of the United Secession connexion was bmlt and 
opened in the village in 1835, the minister of which is resident. 
A suvp-eon also resides in the village. 

The village of Newbiggingf, now rather old-lookmg, is next 
in size to the new village, and consists of sixty dwelling-houses 
containinaa population of 115 males, and 114 females, in all, 229 
.ouls In this village, 32 heads of families now possess pendicles 
of from 3 to about°15 acres. In the hill of Keillor, Kirkton, 
Denend, Burnside, and the Pitnapies, villages in the parish, pen- 
dicles are also similarly held by heads of families. The careful 
cultivation of these pendicles affords employment to the villagers, 
and rewards their industry by yielding them milk, mea , potatoes, 
and other necessaries for the bringing up of their families

village, may be stated as under :—

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture, 8fc. — From a measurement of the property of the 
principal heritor, supposed correct, and said to be of the year 
1815, and from information given as to the other properties in the 
parish, the land of the parish seems to be laid out as follows : 

Arable. Pasture. Wood. Roads. Acres.

Since 1815 much has been done in draining and bringing under 
the plough all improvable land on the estate of the principal heri- 
tor, so that at this date a very considerable extent of what was then 
pasture is now arable ground. But little now remains uncultivated 
which is capable of being profitably brought under cultivation. The 
Hill of Hatton is ploughed almost to its summit ; on the north of 
the parish, where standing water, marsh, and morass were, corn 
fields now are; and on the south, the hand of industry has been 
equally at work, especially on the estate of Couston, farmed by itr. 
proprietor, whose improvements are of a very marked character. 

Woods — The parish, upon the whole, has but a small e.Ktent of 
ground under plantation, which consists chiefly of larch and 
Scotch firs, intermixed in some places with different kinds of 
hard-wood trees. These plantations appear to thrive well. Towards 
the north of the parish, along the roads and in hedge-rows 
forming divisions of fields, trees have been planted, which are 
now of considerable age, and agreeably diversify the aspect of the 
country. There is a small copse of natural birch wood on ihe 



554 FonFAiisiiitlE. 

north decl'ivlty of the hill of Newtyle, which has a very pleasing 
appearance. 

Soil.— The soil on the hilly part of the parish is generally ot a 
iio-ht sharp productive quality, consisting of black earth or clay, 
with mixture of sand and gravel on rock, mortar, or clay. On 
the north, the soil is of a similar, but. in some places, richer 
quality, with subsoil of sand, gravel, clay, and marl. 

Husbandnj.— The usual term of a lease is for nmeteen years. 
Farming is conducted on the most approved systems. The ave- 
rao-e produce of grain may be between five and six quarters per 
ac"re. Oats and barley are the chief grain crops grown in the pa- 
rish. Much attention is paid to the rearing and feeding of cattle 
by the farmers, several of whom also buy in sheep-stock for eat- 
ing off winter turnip, and dispose of the sheep, when fatted, in the 
enduing sprints. A permanent stock of Southdown sheep is kept 
tipby the tenant  of the farm of Auchtertyre. The farm-houses 
and steadings are generally commodious and suitable. At Auch- 
tertvre and Couston, farm-offices have lately been built of the 
most substantial kind. There are 13 thrashing- mills in the parish ; 
7 of these are wrought bv horses, 5 by water, and 1 at Auchter- 
tyre by steam-engine power. There are five farms above L.200 
•md under L.700 each of rent; eleven above L.50 and under 
L 200 • and forty- nine small farms and pendicles varying in rent 
•from L.3 up towards L.50 a-year. There are two bothies in the 

parish. , i i j ■ r 

Rent of Land.— The average rent of arable land, in as tar as 
can be ascertained, mav be stated to be between L.l, 10s. and 
L 1 15s per acre. Some of the land is rented at L.3 per acre. 
We'have no data to determine as to the rent of land in pasture. 
It may be understood, however, as included in the above average 
of rent per acre. Farmers above a L.50 rent, on the estate ot 
the principal heritor, under current leases, pay a grain rent accord- 
\ng to the fiars prices. The rental, of course, of the great bulk 
of" the parish varies according to the fiars prices. 

Quarries — There are several quarries in the parish, containing 
vast abundance of excellent freestone, well adapted for build-ng.

slating for liouscs. Wliinstone is also found in abundance, and 

used for road metal. 

Rental. — The gross rental of the parish may be between L.4000 

and L.5000 ; but, as already stated, a great proportion of the rent 
of the parish is fluctuating in amount. 

Manufactures. — The staple manufacture of the parish at pre- 
sent is Sacking and Hessian sheetings. Coarse linens called Os- 
naburghs are also wrought, and occasionally sheeting and shirtings 
for private use. Since the spinning-wheel gave place to the spin- 
ning-mill, females have betaken themselves to weaving, and there 
are now nearly as many women employed at the loom as men. 
Weaving is done and paid by the piece. Complaints are gene- 
ral as to the lowness of wages ; but employment continues to be 
afforded to those willing to work. There are two meal-mills and 
two saw-mills driven by water. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town. — There is no fair or public market held in the 
parish. Butcher-meat is brought into the new village twice a- 
week from the neighbourhood. 

Means of Communication. — A turnpike road from Dundee passes 
northward between the Kirkton and new village, eleven miles dis- 
tan t from Dundee,— which is kept in excellent repair. Several 
other county or statute- labour roads cross and intersect the pa- 
rish. The railroad from Dundee enters the parish on the souih, 
close upon the turnpike road, and passes at a short distance along- 
side of it, onwards to the northern extremity of the parish, where, 
branching off east and west to Glammis and Cupar Angus, the 
turnpike is crossed over by the branch leading to Cupar Angus on 
the west. The Dundee and Newtyle, the Newtyle and Cupar 
Angus, the Newtyle and Glammis, are separate railway concerns. 

The Dundee and Newtyle Railway was begun at both ends of 
the line in 1826, and opened in 1832. The length of the line 
between Newtyle and Dundee is 10 miles, and has cost, it is 
said, about L. 100,000. The Hatton inclined plane in this pa- 
rish is three-quarters of a mile long, has an ascent of one in twelve. 



and 



IS wrought by a fixed engine. After the opening of th. 
Dundee and Newtyle Railway, the line was extended, as before 
stated, with a gentle declivity sufficient to carry on carriages to 
a distance of from one and a half to two miles, towards the Cupar 



506 FOIIFARSHIRE. 

Angus and Glammis stations. These lines are otherwise wrought 
by horse power. 

The line of railway from Dundee to Newtyle was amongst - 
the earliest undertakings of the kind in the country. Its summit 
level is said to be upwards of 420 feet high. The undertakmg was 
at least a bold one. ., . , • • 

Ecclesiastical State.-Th church was built in 1767, and is m 
good condition. It holds about 500 sitters, is conveniently si- 
tuated A few sittings are reserved freefor the poor. Thereare about 
100 seats for letting, disposed of at a small annual payment, ap- 
propriated in behoof of the poor's fund. The manse was built in 
1771 It does not appear to have been originally a well bmlt and 
finished house, and is not in good condition. Commodious and 
well-built office-houses were erected in 1833. The statutory ex- 
tent of the glebe is six Scotch acres. It is of light soil ; in rent 
value not exceeding L.l, lOs. per acre. The stipend consists of 
77 bolls, 1 peck, I lippie of barley ; 75 bolls, 1 firlot, 1 peck, f hp- 
pie of meal, 1 peck i lippie oats; and L.32, lis. 5,.d. Sterling 

"Son—A new parochial school was lately built, of hand- 
some structure, and sufficient accommodation for 150 scholars. 
The salary of the schoolmaster is the maximum, with a free house 
and garden. The fees vary from 2s. to 7s. per quarter,-the 
latter charge including education in all the higher branches taught 
in the school. The amount of fees actually paid in the year may 
be about L.50 ; and from session-clerk dues and other sources, 
from L.5 to L.IO may be realized. There is a school on private 
adventure taught in the parish ; also two or three taught by fe- 

males. . , - i 

Sunday schools have, for a long time past, been in the parbti. 
There are at present two in connexion with the Establishment, 
having an average attendance of upwards of 100 scholars; and 
one in connexion with the United Secession. 

Libraries.— khoxM twenty years ago, a library, consisting chiefiy 
of religious books, was established in the parish. A marked inte- 
rest in it was evinced by the people, till the books about 130 vo- 
lumes, had been very generally read by them  Ilg\ty-f«"';,°; 
lumes selected from the London Sunday School Union's excellent 
collection, have been lately procured, and added to the library. 

Savings A branch savings bank of the Dundee m 

tional Security Savings Bank, was opened m the parish m ISJy.

The deposits in August 1841 amounted to L. 145, 19s. 3d.; in 
May 1842 to L. 1.39, 12s. Id. 

Poor. — The average number of persons receiving parochial aid 
is about 15. Of this number some have families. There is sel- 
dom less given to any pauper than Is., and seldom more to any 
than 2s. 6d. per week, unless in the case of v'idows with young 
families, or of orphan children. Donations are occasionally given 
in a private manner to meritorious persons known to be in distres- 
sed circumstances, and who may have a reluctance openly to ap- 
ply for relief. Such persons seldom fail to evince gratitude for 
the respect shown to their wants. A pauper has been for about 
twenty years past in the Dundee Lunatic Asylum. The annual 
average of collections, contributions, &amp;c. on behoof of the poor for 
the three years preceding 1st July 1841 was L.72, 14s. 7d.; dis- 
tributed, L.64, 83. Id. ; to which is to be added expenditure for 
salaries of kirk-officer, session-clerk, and precentor, &amp;c. L.8, 15s.

contribution by the principal heritor, L.30; total, L.73, 10s. 3d. 
There is still a laudable disinclination among the people to 
come upon the poor's fund.

from the North British or Pictish vorrf, U,aflood or inundation 
On what account, this name should have been apphed to a tract 
of country, having in it nothing that deserves the name of a nver ; 
and consi;ting chiefly of sloping-elevated ground, as secure as pes- 
sible from all risk of inundation, it is not easy to conjecture. 

Benvie, some suppose to be of Celtic derivation-from Ben. 
B.iahe"-signifying the Yellow Hill or Movnt

LIFF AND BENVIE, 509 

is properly termed the parish of Liff and Benvie, to which, with 
that part of the quoad acra'parishjof Lochee, which formerly be- 
longed to Liff, the following observations have reference. 

Extent and Boundaries. — This parish is situated at the south- 
west corner of the county of Forfar, being bounded on the west, 
by the parishes of Fowlis Easter and Longforgan both in Perth- 
shire ; on the south, by the river Tay ; on the east, by Dundee 
and the united parish of Mains and Strathmartine ; and on the 
north, by the Dighty, a small river which divides it from the pa- 
rishes of Auchterhouse and Lundie. The extent is about 6 miles 
from east to west, and 4 miles from north to south. The land 
rises with a gentle slope from the Tay for nearly three miles, till 
it reaches an elevation of about 400 feet. The remaini:ig part 
has a northern aspect. The turnpike road from Perth to Dundee 
passes near the south boundary for the space of one mile, and the 
road from Dundee to Meigle and Cupar- Angus traverses the pa- 
rish for three miles, near its eastern limit. 

Hi/drography.—Theve is no river in the parish. Several small 
streams flowing from the west, and joined, within less than a mile 
of the Tay, by the rivulet running through Lochee from the east, 
are then called the Burn of Invergowrie, which, after passing Bul- 
lion bleachfield, and a little further down furnishing a sufficient 
water-power for the flour-mills of Invergowrie, falls into the bay of 
that name.f 

Near the village of Benvie is a spring strongly impregnated 
with iron. It was formerly in great repute as a tonic, and was ap- 
phed externally in cutaneous disorders, but is now entirely ne- 
glected. 

Geology.-The geology of this parish has of late attracted con- 
siderable attention, in consequence of a variety of fossil organic 
remains very recently discovered in the den of Balruddery, by Mr 
Webster, the proprietor ; having, with one exception, been declared 
by Professor Agassiz to belong to entirely new species; and also 
m consequence of very considerable difference of opinion hav-

ing arisen, amongst geologists, as to the precise formation 
to which the strata they occur in are to be held as belong, 
ing It may, therefore, be desirable to state the conclusions ' 
to which a careful examination of this very interesting locality 
and the district around would seem to give rise. But, as in 
examining a particular locality, it is necessary, m order to form 
any conclusion as to its geological character, not only carefully to 
examine that locality, but also as much of the district around as 
shall be necessary to determine its relative position, with regard 
to'the strata connected with it;-so, therefore, it will here be ne- 
cessary, in order to point out the particular character of the strata 
in this' parish, to make some remarks on the nature of the strata 
of the district around, and to state the conclusions drawn from a 
careful examination of them. 

The stratified rocks of this parish are of two kinds,— red sand- 
stone and gray sandstone. There are but few localities at which 
their precise point of contact can be traced with much distinct- 
ness. and there has, therefore, been some doubt as to which of 
them is superimposed on the other. Fleming states, that the 
gray sandstones overlie the red, Cheek's Edin. Journal, Feb. 
1831, whilst Mr Lyell in his Elements of Geology , s ates, 
that the red sandstones overlie the gray. But these localities 
. combined with an attentive observation of the general position ot 
the strata, afford conclusive grounds on which to determine this 
fact, from which it distinctly appears that the red sandstone over 
lies the gray. The general line of direction, or crop of the stiata 
t'ere they' appear to be free from the immediate influence of 
Trap rocks is 'from south-east to north-west, the dip, therefor , 
being towards the south-west. The strata along the high groun 
.hich forms the northern boundary of the 
almost entirely occupied by gray sandstone, whilst the led sand 
stone is generally found occupying the low ground and appaie y 
contained within the limits of the gray sandstone, where the s ra , 
rornTchange of dip, assume a somewhat basined form, which oc- 
curTat d ffefent places in the neighbourhood and also, m soine 
T l in the Carse of Gowrie. These sandstones vary consi- 
1 ; in hara:;:: and internal structure at different pou. 
The general character of the gray sandstone is,-finely gra u e , 
compL, of a dullish-gray colour, var.ii in   
schist, to compact sandstone in deep beds, well - fo di g

proaching in character to a conglomerate. Towards the upper 
part of the series, it chiefly assumes a schistose character, some- 
times of considerable tenuity, and, at other limes, forming excel- 
lent pavement, precisely similar in character and appearance to 
the well known Arbroath pavement of Carmylie Quarry, and ge- 
nerally intermingled with beds of slate clay, locally termed calm. 
This schistus deposit is of considerable depth. Its position and 
character are well seen in the den of Balruddery, in the den of 
Fowlis, and near Liff. The gray sandstone, forming the lower 
part of the series, is evidently of enormous depth, and is quarried 
to a great extent at Millfield, on the banks of the Tay, and at 
Lochee, at which places blocks of immense size can be cut. The 
red sandstone varies from a brownish-red-coloured stone, some- 
what similar in texture to the gray sandstone, to that of a deep 
brick-red-coloured stone of softer texture, having, in many in- 
stances, yellow spots or nuclei interspersed through it, similar to 
those which occur in the red sandstone of Clashbinnie Quarry, 
near the west or upper end of the Carse. One of the most fa- 
vourable localities for observing the point of contact, and, there- 
fore, order of superposition of the sandstones, is in the den of 
Balruddery, where the red sandstone is found superimposed on 
the gray sandstone schists, and contains yellow spots precisely si- 
milar to those of Clashbinnie. The transition from gray to red 
is more or less gradual in different localities. This transition may 
be distinctly traced near Liff Church. The organic remains of 
the red sandstone have been found in the deep brick-red coloured 
sandstone of Clashbinnie, whilst those of the gray sandstone de- 
posit have been found in the slate-clay of the den of Balruddery. 

In examining these strata, it is necessary to attend to the effect 
produced on them by the trap rocks, which, in some instances, 
alter both their position and appearance very considerably. These 
trap rocks consist chiefly of greenstone, as at Castle Huntly, in 
the Carse of Gowrie, and in the Sidlaw range of hills, but, in 
many instances, also of porphyritic rocks of reddish colour, and 
also of porphyritic greenstone. Thus, in the den of Balruddery, 
which is a very important point for observation, considerable diffi- 
culty occurs in tracing the continuous character and position of 
the gray sandstone schists, in consequence of the occurrence of 
Igneous rocks, of a porphyritic nature, in several places in the 
torm of dikes, which break through the strata, and give them a 
red colour and altered appearance when near the point of contact 



572 FOUFARSHIUE. 

In order to observe the precise character and position of these 
strata, it is necessary, as they dip towards the south, to trace their 
connection with rocks of an older date, to the northward , 

The Carse of Gowrie is bounded on the north by the Sidlaw 
ranae of hills, chiefly composed of trap rocks, which separates it 
from Strathmore. On crossing these hills, the gray sandstone is 
aaain found reclining on the north side of them, dipping to the 
north. And in traversing Strathmore, we find the central part of 
it is chiefly occupied by red sandstone as at Cupar Angus, these 
sandstones being in every way precisely simdar to those of he 
Carse of Gowrie. But on approaching the northern side ot Strath- 
more, towards Blair-Gowrie, the red sandstone begins to assume 
the character of a conglomerate, which, on tracmg it along the 
beds of the streams which intersect the high ground to the nortli 
of Strathmore, becomes a coarse red conglomerate, having all the 
characteristics of the old red sandstone conglomerate On tra- 
cing it still farther north, as in the bed of the Encht to the north 
of Craighall House, it passes into a coarse gray conglomerate 
mized at some points with finer grained portions in a some w a 
stratified position, which is at once recognized as belonging to the 
gi-evwacke series. The colour of this cong bmerate is remarka- 
blyimilar to that of the gray sandstones of Strathmore and the 
cL-se of Gowrie, and the finer portions of it are remarkably sum- 
lar to many of the gray sandstone strata. 

Thus then, »e find these sandstone strata occupymg the vale,, 
of StvatLc e and the Ca, se of Gowrie, and that as we approach the 
borde otthe Grampian range, the, assume the eharacterof con- 
Momer Ues. There seems no reason for cons.dermg these conglc

stone generally. But as the recent discovery of fossil organic re- 
mains of a new species in them has created considerable interest 
it may perhaps be desirable to state shortly the results of a parti- 
cular examination of them. The opinion expressed by Dr Thom- 
son in his Chemistry and Mineralogy, and by Mr Witham in his 
paper on the Red Sandstone of Berwickshire, published in the 
Transactions of the Natural History Society of Newcastle, Vol. i. 
p. 173, as to the existence of a new red sandstone in Forfarshire, 
now distinctly appears to be altogether erroneous; the localities to 
which Mr Witham refers are not pointed out with such distinctness 
as to enable the observer to examine into the fact ; but undoubted- 
ly more recent examinations of this county clearly tend to prove 
that new red sandstone does not occur in any part of it. And, on 
the other hand, it has since been clearly shown that the sandstones 
alluded to by Dr Thomson underlie the coal formation of Fife, 
thus entirely excluding the supposition that they can belong to the 
new red sandstone series. It may therefore be held, that the red 
sandstones of this district belong to the old red sandstone forma- 
tion, and the point now to be observed is their precise position 
with regard to the strata of the surrounding district. The gray 
sandstone has been stated by Dr Fleming as was previously men- 
tioned to overlie the red, whilst Mr Lyell states that they occur 
in the reverse order, and the result of an examination of them, as 
will have been observed, coincides with the latter view. In a re- 
cent treatise on the old red sandstone, Mr Millar makes a very 
ingenious subdivision of the old red sandstone of the north of Scot- 
land, based on views drawn from a consideration of the fossil or- 
ganic remains which occur in the various strata, and by compari- 
son of them with the better known old red sandstones of England, 
and undoubtedly fossil organic remains of a somewhat similar cha- 
racter, have been found to be common to each of them but there 
scarcely seems sufficient information as yet to have been obtained 
regarding the old red sandstones of Scodand, to lead to any con- 
clusive arrangement of them, based on an examination of their fos- 
sil organic remains alone. It is indeed but very recently that they 
were known to contain the organic remains of any animals what- 
ever, and but a very indistinct conclusion, indeed, can be drawn 
from the fact of particular species having been found to occur in 
certain strata, while they have not been found to do so in others 
which may be more or less similar to them in mineral character or 
appearance, for indeed very much depends on the nature of the 



574 FORFARSHIRE. 

Strata in which they occur. Thus the organic remains of Balrud- 
dery are found in the slate clay of the gray sandstone, whilst those 
of the red sandstone of Clashbinnie quarry are imbedded in sili- , 
ceous matter. Mr Miller subdivides the old red sandstone de- 
posits into three distinct classes, and apparently from the circum- 
stance of the red and gray sandstones of this district havmg an or- 
ganism of one particular species, viz. the Cephelaspis common to 
both, he classes them as belonging to the second or mtermediate 
division; but it is scarcely enough to say, that because particular 
fossil organic remains have not been found to occur throughout 
the various beds of a great deposit, such as the old red sandstone 
series, therefore they do not belong simply to one general deposit, 
or thit a special and invariable subdivision may be inferred from 
it or that any distinct ground of comparison of them wdl thereby 
arise with similar deposits of a different locality or country. This 
is a well known circumstance with regard to other deposits, though 
perhaps on a smaller scale, as in the mountain hmestone, or in the 
coal formation generally, where particular fossils are found to oc- 
cur in some deposits, whilst they are totally awanting, or of partial 
occurrence merely in others, and reappear again without any as- 
signable order whatever, so that whilst sufficient grounds may be 
afforded for the comparison of the formation or deposit generally, 
,.ith those of a similar character which occur at diffei-ent and d.s- 
tant localities, still they can by no means be held sufficient for as- 
signing any rule or order of occurrence. The mineral character 
and contents of the deposit also give rise to very considerable and 
important effects, as from the effect pointed out by Lyell, by th 
presence of oxide of iron in greater or less quantity, which must 
in many instances account for the absence of organic remains 
,.hich might otherwise have occurred in them. The beauti ul 
state of preservation in which the organic remains of Balruddery, 
although mostly of a very delicate texture, occur, in consequence 
o the'total absence, or nearly so, of iron in the slate clay in which 
thev are found, is a remarkable instance. And it is an undoubt 
ed fact that there is a great irregularity in the character and oc 
currence of the old red sandstones of Scotland and e sewhere. 

T he appear, indeed, to be many satisfactory groun s or fornjing 
a conclusion regarding the strata of this district, both fn. thei 
relative position and internal structure, although, of - , - 
must always be taken not to place too much rehaice on this latte

server. Although the examination of this district be attended 
with considerable difficulty, still it affords a rather favourable op- 
portunity of ascertaining the geological character of the strata 
which occur in it. These, as has been mentioned, are limited to 
the red and gray sandstones, and, therefore, some of the strata al- 
luded to by Mr Miller must of course be awanting ; still the parti- 
cular position affords a great advantage in investigating their na- 
ture, and their particular character and position appears to be 
this, — that the gray and red conglomerates which occur on the 
high ground to the north of Strathmore are the equivalents of the 
gray and red sandstones of Strathmore and the Carse of Gowrie, 
and that, therefore, the former belongs to the grayvvacke, and the 
latter to the old red sandstone series, which is simply an instance 
of by no means unusual occurrence, of the old red sandstone pas- 
sing into the graywacke beneath, as in Pembrokeshire and else- 
where. The position of the strata of this district coincides almost 
precisely with the section given by Mr Lyell, in his Elements of 
Geology, page 99, with the exception of the gray sandstone there 
laid down as occurring below the red, being merely looked upon 
as belonging to the graywacke series. The position of these strata 
in the ascending order is therefore this, 1st, the graywacke, 2/, the 
old red sandstone, 3c, the yellow sandstone of Fifeshire, 4th, the 
coal formation of Fifeshire. 

A.S was previously mentioned, the fossil organic remains disco- 
vered by Mr Webster in the den of Balruddery have been exa- 
mmed by Professor Agassiz, and it is therefore hoped that correct 
drawings and descriptions of them will be published by that emi- 
nent naturalist. A few of the principal specimens may here be 
mentioned, as consisting of various specimens of the Ce'phelaspis, 
portions of a crustaceous animal in a beautiful state of preserva- 
I tion, stated by Professor Agassiz to have belonged to a gigantic 
i lobster ; a variety of ichthyodorulites, fins, and spines, and various 
beautifully marked delicate portions of crustaceous animals ; but 
of these fossils, enough is not yet known to give any correct de- 
tailed description of them. 
Boulders — On the road to Liff, about a mile from the Tay, 
' stands a very large boulder of gneiss, perfectly isolated, vulgarly 
termed the " Paddock Stane ;" and two more of the same sort

Botany.— 'VhQ romantic, dells and glens which abound m this 
neighbourhood are, in the season, richly clothed with the most 
beattiful plants and flowers, yet there is nothing very peculiar or 
rare in the botany of this parish. , „ , j , r , 

It may be mentioned, that in the Den of Balruddery, referred 
to above, the ViolaUrta and the 5r«aZ«./yw//«s are to be 
found, both stated by Hooker to be "rare in Scotland, although 
a more extensive ob'servation has proved that they scarcely merit 
this honour. A more curious and a much rarer plant is also to be 
found in this locality, viz. the Tragopocjon. This plant is inte- 
resting from its extreme sensibility to the " skiey influences. If 
the weather is fair, its flowers open at early dawn, and shut again 
.about ten o'clock in the morning ; so that, if the oloserver wishes 
to see its large vellow corolla expanded, he must bestir himself, 
and watch his opportunity. Its roots seem at one time to have 
been used as an esculent. Old Gerarde describes them as in 
" delicate taste farre surpassing either parsenep or carrot. 1 he 
Samhucus ebulus grows in the old bnrying-ground at Invergowrie 
From the fact of its being found occasionally in such situations, it 
is probable that the ecclesiastics in other days grew it for its me- 
dilal properties. The Veronica anagallis, which is far trom com- 
Ln in this part of the country, will be found in the burn of Benvie. 

Plantations.-T\ns parish and the surrounding district are well- 
wooded. On the lands of Camperdown are very extensive plan- 
tations, all of which, with the exception of young larch trees are 
very thriving, and contribute greatly to the beauty of the land- 
scape, as well as the improvement of the climate and temperature. 

The estate of Gray abounds with fine timber of various kinds, 
and of considerable age,-elm, plane, ash, beech, oak, and fir trees

Mansion Houses.— The House of Gray Is an imposing and ve- 
nerable structure. It is of the manor style of architecture, with 
turrets; was built in 1716; is quite entire, and in good repair. It 
stands in a fine park of 200 acres, interspersed with old trees. 

Camperdown House is an elegant modern building, of the 
Grecian style. The entrance on the east is adorned with a hand- 
some portico, supported by eight massive columns of the lonie 
order. It is built of white Killala sandstone. The interior ar- 
rangements correspond with the external appearance, combining 
in a high degree elegance with comfort. The saloon is very mag 
nificent, lighted by a cupola. 

But the most appropriate and interesting embellishment of this 
noble mansion is a splended painting, by Sir John Copley, of the 
scene on board the Venerable, immediately after the hatth of 
Camperdown. De Winter is in the act of delivering up his sword 
to the British Admiral. The air of dejection which marks his 
handsome countenance tells how deeply he felt his unfortunate 
position; while the athletic form, and noble attitude and bearing 
ot Admiral Duncan exhibit the very personification of a British 
hero. The other figures which comprise the group, it is said, are

real likenesses of the gallant men who bore aconspicuous part in 
the achievement of that ever me«iovable day. 

A large addition has lately been made to the njansion-house of 
Inveraowrie, the seat of Alexander Clayhills, Esq. 1 he plan 
was furnished by Mr Burn, architect, and reflects great credit on 
his taste The house is delightfully situated on a slopmg bank 
adjoining the Tay, and commands a beautiful view of the bay o 
Invergowrie, of the course of the river for several rmles, and of 
the rich and fertile district of the Carse of Gowne, lymg imme- 
diately to the westward.  . , j 

Balruddery House Robert Webster, Esq. is a handsome mo- 
dern building. It stands on an eminence sufficiently elevated to 
afford a rich, extensive, and varied prospect. The finely wooded 
dells by which it is surrounded are well known for theu; beautiful 

and romantic scenery.  . 

Mills — Within the last sixteen or seventeen years, three spin- 
oino'-mills have been erected in the village of Lochee, and one at 
Denmiln, in this parish. Whatever advantages may accrue from 
these establishments, they have a very unfortunate effect on the 
morals and pauperism of the community. At Bullion, near In- 
vereowrie, an extensive work for bleaching and dyeing yarn and 
clofh has been lately established. The necessary erections have 
been made with great care, and at very considerable expense 
There is on the premises a water-wheel of 14 horses poweI and 
a steam-engine of 6. A gasometer has been fitted up solely for 

the use of the work. jninqq

Eminent Characters. — In the number of distinguished charac- 
ters connected with the parish, by residence, though not by birth, 
may be mentioned the late Admiral Viscount Duncan. During 
the intervals of professional service, he resided at the family seat in 
this parish ; and in the intercourse of private life, the benevolence 
of his disposition and urbanity of his manners conciliated the re- 
spect and affection of all classes. He was a staunch friend of the 
Established Church, and occasionally officiated as an elder. 

The late Professor John Playfair of Edinburgh was born at 
Benvie on the lOth of March 1748. He succeeded his father as 
minister of the united parish in August 1773; but the bent of his 
mind being decidedly towards scientific pursuits, he resigned the 
pastoral office in 1782, and became tutor to Mr Fergusson of 
Raith and his brother Sir Ronald Fergusson. He taught for se- 
veral years the mathematical class in the University of Edinburgh, 
and was afterwards appointed Professor of Natural Philosophy, both 
which situations he filled with distinguished honour and ability. 
The works he has left behind him establish his claim to the cha- 
racter of an eminent scholar and elegant writer. This parish was 
also the birth-place of his brother, William, author of many excel- 
lent works on history and antiquities. 

Antiquities.— Druidical Temple.— The Druidical temple men- 
tioned in the former account of the parish, consisting of nine laro-e 
rude stones, is still to be seen. The enclosed space is circular, 
about ten feet in diameter. ' 

Boman Camp.— Of the Roman camp, described by Maitland 
m his History of Scotland, and called " Catter Milly," or guatuor 
' millia, alluding, it is supposed, to the number of troops assembled 
m the fortress, or the distance of the encampment from some other 
station, no trace remains. 

Pitalpie.-V\ia\\e, or Pit of Alpin, lies on the confines of the 
parish to the east. A few cottages on the farm of Dryburoh bore 
the name of Pitalpie. They are now removed, and the space 
» whereon they stood is within the plantations of the Earl of Cam- 
I perdown. The name is considered as referring to " the scene of 
an engagement, in the ninth century, between the Picts and Scots 
n which the latter were routed, and Alpin, their king, with man 
nobles, was slain. The kings head, after the battle, beina fast- 
ened to a pole, was carried by the victors to Abernethy, at that

to the east of Pitalpie. It has a hole in the middle about a foot 
deep, in which,-it is supposed, the royal standard was planted dur- 

ino- the battle. , . , , , ... 

Hurly Hawhin.-The site of a castle, said to have been built 
by Alexander 1., King of Scotland, and known by the name of 
HurW Hawkin, may be easily traced in an enclosure opposite to 
the churchyard of Liff, to the west. It is a projecting point or 
iomue of land. The apex or point and two of the sides are sur- 
rounded by a deep ravine. There is no access but from the north 
on which side there might have been a ditch or fosse, though 
all traces of it, and even of any building on the spot, are almost 
obliterated.f

Subterraneous Caves and Buildings, — In the loimer Account of 
this parish, a full and interesting description is given oF a subter- 
raneous building, discovered, it is said, a few years before, near 
Lundie House now Camperdown. The following is the account 
given of it, somewhat abridged : 

" The discovery was made in consequence of the frequent in- 
terruptions experienced in ploughing the field. Upon a search 
being made, flat stones were found of a surprising breadth, which 
were employed to cover certain artificial recesses which then ap- 
peared. One was larger than the rest, being 6 feet in breadth, 
12 in length, and o in height. The walls and floor were of stone. 
This communicated with other smaller apartments by a passage 
about 2 or 2 feet wide. The building stood on the shelving side 
of a rock. On the compartments being first opened, all of them 
were filled with a rich black mould, on removing which, the re- 
mains of some burnt matter were found, and fragments of bones, 
but so small, as rendered it impossible to ascertain whether they 
belonged to the human body or not. There were likewise found 
some querns or hand-mills, about 14 inches diameter, much worn, 
supposed to have been used in grinding corn. In the centre of 
some of these querns, a small bit of iron was fastened, showing 
the handle to have been of that metal." Before this building was 
closed, we are told, it was minutely inspected by the late Sir Da- 
vid Dalrymple, Lord Hailes. On the farm of Balgartno, near the 
Tay, the plough is still frequently interrupted by stone coffins, as 
they are termed, of very rude construction. They abound parti- 
cularly in the vicinity of the large boulder above noticed. 

Church of Inverf/owrie.—Vndev this head must be noticed the 
remains of the church of Invergowrie, believed to be the most an- 
cient place of Christian worship to the north of the Tay. The 
walls, however, which are standing, and are very entire, are of the 
planiest masonry, and bear no marks of antiquity. They cannot

possibly have belonged to the first edifice, erected by Boniface, a 
leaate or missionary, who landed at that place from Home, during 
the seventh century. On this point reference is made in the for- ' 
mer account to Boeth. Hist., Archbishop Spott.swood and For- 
bes on Tithes. The space enclosed within the walls ot the 
church has, for generations, been appropriated as the burying- 
place of the families of Invergowrie and Mylnefield. The church- 
yard is often washed by the Tay. 

III. — Population. 
From the former Statistical Account, it appears that, by Dr 
Webster's report, the number of inhabitants at that time was 131 1. 

The viUacre of Kirktown of Liff is said to have contained in 1650 
one-third at'' least of the whole inhabitants ; the number of the 
whole, according to a report made by the minister about that tune 
to the Presbytery of Dundee, amounting to 400 and upwards. 

Several of'the feus having been, about the beginning of the last 
century, purchased by Lord Gray, and taken into his pleasure- 
grounds, as was also "the glebe of Liff, the village was restricted 
to its present limits. It contains at present 26 families. 

By decreet of annexation for Liff and Benvie, dated August 
1753, the examinable persons, or those above ten years of age, 
were reported to be 650; the examinable persons in Benvie, 150; 

total, 800. , , f 

By a survey of the inhabitants in January 1792, the number of 
examinable persons amounted to 1451. By the census of 1831, 
the whole population is stated to be 4217 ; the increase chiefly 
in the village of Lochee. That village being now politically con- 
nected with Dundee, or within the Parliamentary boundary, the 
population at last census June 1841 was taken in connection 
with Dundee, and not with this parish. On that account, the 
precise amount of the inhabitants of Lochee is not known to me , 
but it cannot be under 3000 souls.

census is . • ' " _ 304

The number of illegitimate children born within the parish within 
the last three years is 7. In most of these cases, the parents were 
afterwards married. 

In the Lunatic A.sylum, Dundee, there are 3 patients belong- 
ing to this parish. One fatuous person is taken care of in a pri- 
vate family, at the expense of the kirk-session ; and 5 by their re- 
lations, aided by the session. There are 2 persons, a brother and 
sister, deaf and dumb. 

Character of the People. — The people, generally speaking, are 
peaceable and industrious, and, with a few marked exceptions, so- 
ber. It may be here remarked, that the bothie system, which is 
considered so injurious to the religious and moral character of an 
important class of our population, is by no means general in this 
parish. By far the greater number of farm-servants are married 
men. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — There is a considerable variety of soil in the pa- 
rish. In general, that of the higher grounds is light, mixed with 
sand, upon a subsoil of rock or mortar. The lower grounds are 
either of a black soil, inclining to loam, or of clay. Being in the 
hands of skilful, sober, and industrious tenants,' and at a short 
distance from Dundee, where all kinds of manure can be had, the 
lands are rendered very productive. Grain of all the ordinary 
kmds, wheat, barley, oats, pease, and beans, are in general culti- 
vation. 

The raising of green crop is an object of particular attention, 
wilhm three or four miles of Dundee. The average price of 
grass of the firsi year, for green cutting, is about L.12 per acre. 
An acre of turnips will bring as much, and often more. 

Potatoes are cultivated to a considerable extent. On some of 
the larger farms, from twenty to thirty acres are sometimes ap- 
propnated to this species of produce. Forty bolls per acre is con- 
sidered a fair return. The average selling price varies from 8s. 
Dutch  sometimes rises to I5s. per boll of thirty-two stones. 

It is a common practice for the farmers to let a field in smaU 
lots, tor a potato crop, at the rate of Is. per pole, or L.I 0 per 
acre, to cottars or villagers, who provide seed, assist in planting.

hand-hoe and lift the crop', while the farnr»er furnishes manure, 
the use of his plough for the requisite drillings, and of his carts 

to lodge the produce. 

For some years past, dairy husbandry has been gauiuig ground. 
On each of two farms in the parish, about forty cows, chiefly of 
the Ayrshire breed, are kept, and almost all the tenants adopt the 
system to a certain extent. 

The North Highland sheep and Angus cattle are most com- 
mon in this district, but no attention is paid to the breeding of 

The rotation of cropping most commonly followed for there 
are exceptions is that of five, viz. two years grass succeeded by 
oats and then potatoes and turnip: vheat is most frequently sown 
after potatoes, and barley after turnip ; grass seeds being joined 

with both. „. , t e 

Farm-buildings, both in regard to dwelling-houses and tarni- 
offices, are, in general, sufficiently large and commodious. Land- 
lords are desirous to furnish their tenants with suitable accommo- 
dation, of which the following fact is a sufficient proof, that, within 
the last six or seven years, two steadings have been entirely re- 
built, and four more partially rebuilt, and thoroughly repaired and 
enlarged. 

The ordinary duration of leases is nineteen years. 

The only garden in the parish which merits particular notice 
is that at Camperdown, situated on a sloping bank, within a quarter 
of a mile of the house. It contains about two Scots acres within 
the walls, which are from fourteen to fifteen feet in height. Agains 
the north wall stands a magnificent range of hot-houses, 2o0 feet 
in length, containing 6800 square feet of glass. The range con- 
sists of five vineries, three peach-houses, with conserva ory, &amp;c. 
all in the best condition. The garden and surrounding shrubbery 
embrace an area of about sixteen acres, and the whole extent of 
olass is about 8400 square feet. • i , . 

• In the glen to the east of Balruddery, above-mentioned, about 
nine acres are laid out as orchard and garden, well Rocked wuh 
ruit trees, &amp;c. having a fine stream of water running through the 

Ttnvie, there is an orchard, containing three acres which 
.af oHLl attached to the manse, a part of - ui dni 
til remains, and forms a section of the Jwe hnghous n 
fa m of Benzie. The autumn pear, generally known in thi. part

of the country by the name of the Benvie Pear, is a native of this 
spot. A very ancient tree of this sort, probably the original\ 
after being laid prostrate for many years, and still continuing to 
bear, was lately removed. 

Quarries. — Quarries of excellent freestone abound in this parish. 
At Lochee are several, which have been wrought for a long period. 
From one of these, the materials for that magnificent work, the 
Dundee Harbour, were, for several years, chiefly obtained. Lat- 
terly, the trustees have had recourse to a quarry at Pyot Dikes, 
five miles from Dundee, where blocks of hard stone, of almost 
any size, may be had. 

According to the best information to which" have access, the number of imperial 
acres, cultivated, may be stated at . . . 4400 

Imperial acres in pasture, . ,  - 60

Rental of the parish, about L. 11,000. 

Manufactures.— chief, almost the sole, branch of manu 
facture earned on in this parish, is the weaving of coarse linen 
cloth prmc.pally for exportation. This has almost entirely su- 
perseded the weaving of household linen, as hand-spinning has 
been almost wholly given up since the introduction of machinery 
by means of which, this part of the work is performed with greal 
accuracy, loung persons, of both se.xes, are early trained to the 
loom ; but many of them have recourse to out-door-work, and find 
employment m agricultural operations during spring and harvest 
and many labourers apply themselves to the loom durino- winter  

istunatrng the population of that part of the village of Lochee 
connected vvuh this parish, at 3000, it cannot be\r from he 
truth, to consider two-thirds of that number, both male and fe-

FORFAUSIIIRE. 



male, as employed in manufacture, and the remaining third, as 
consisting of labourers, masons, mechanics, carters, &amp;c. 

The depressed state of the linen trade, for some time past, has 
been severely felt by the operatives in this quarter. Many fa- 
milies have, in consequence, been brought to a state of uidigence 
and destitution. 

V. Parochial Economy. 

Market-Town.— The market-town to which the people of this 
parish resort is Dundee, where they find a ready sale for all 

country produce. 

nUages.— Excepting the village of Lochee, there is scarcely 
another that deserves the name. There are twenty-six families 
in the Kirktown of Liff, about twenty in Denhead and Denmiln, 
and thirty-five in BirkhiU Feus. The last may, in process of 
time, attain to a considerable population. The ground, which 
belongs to Mr Wedderburn of BirkhiU, is feued in small portions, 
and at a low rate, and being situated on the turnpike road from 
Dundee to Meigle and Cupar- Angus, at the distance of from four 
to five miles from Dundee, an opportunity is afforded to weavers, 
or persons of small capital, to establish themselves m a convenient 
locality for carrying on their respective trades and occupations. 

Ecclesiastical State.-The parish church is new, having been 
finished in December 1831. It stands in a beautiful and com- 
manding situation,-Lord Gray having, with his accustomed li- 
berahtv, made over to the heritors, as a grant, a sufficient space 
in his fine park, for the site of the church, and suitable precincts. 
The building is of the early English style of Gothic architecture; 
the body of the church is of a plain rectangular figure. 1 he 
bell tower, at the east end of the building, measures, from the 
base to the top of the battlements, 60 feet, and is surmounted by 
a stone spire, 48 feet in height, making the whole height from 
the base of the church to the top of the vane, 108 feet. At the 
top of the battlements, there are introduced eight ornamented 
pinnacles, and four flying buttresses resting upon the corners ot 
the spire. The effect thus produced, contrasted with the plain 
soliditv of the whole structure, is very pleasing. The plan was 
furnished by Mr William M'Kenzie, architect, Perth. 

The estimate for the building, exclusive of the spire, was nearly 
L.1900, but the actual expense exceeded L.2200. It is seated 
for 750, and is capable of containing 100 more if necessary he 
number of communicants is about 600. The heritors, as .s usual 



I,IFF AND BENVIE. 



587 



in like cases, divided the area of the church among themselves, in 
proportion to their respective valued rents, and allotted certain 
seats to particular farms and pendicles, from whence it happens, 
that, in certain cases, more accommodation is allotted than there 
are persons to occupy ; while the claims of those who do not rent 
land, or who reside on the estate of a proprietor who has a small 
valued rent in comparison of his people, are rather overlooked. 
The best method of obviating such inconvenience seems to be, 
by placing a reasonable portion of the church seats under the 
management of the kirk-session, so as to enable them to provide 
for any particular exigency. The sittings may be said to be all 
free. 

The greater part of the manse is old. It is said to have been 
built for a lady connected with the family of Gray, who died be- 
fore it was completed. After remaining in an unfinished state 
for several years, it was fitted up as a manse for Mr Playffiir, 
when, upon the demise of Mr Donaldson, minister of Liflp, he was 
admitted to the charge of the united parish, and removed his re- 
sidence from Benvie to Lift'. 

During the last twenty years, the manse has received various 
repairs and additions. 

The office-houses were built in 1822, and are very substantial 
and commodious. 

The present glebe was given in exchange for the glebes of 
Benvie and Lift", and contains, including the garden, about ten 
acres of dry, sharp land, producing fair crops of grain and other 
farm produce. It might rent for about L..3 per acre. 

The stipend is eighteen chalders of barley and oatmeal, in equal 
proportions. The allowance for communion elements is L.IO. 
The minister of Benvie is superior of the Lady Well in Dundee. 

In the parish of Liff" proper the number of Dissenting families 
amounts to six ; Episcopalian families, two ; Roman Catholics, 
none. 

Lochee Church.— khoxxi ten years ago, a large and JGmmodious 
church or chapel, in connection with the Establishment, was erect- 
■ ed, which cost the sum of L.2000. It was opened for Divine ser- 
' vice in February 1830, and, in the month of April 1832, the pre- 
sent incumbent was ordained and admitted to the charge of the 
quoad sacra parish. The church is seated for nearly 1200. There 
are 100 free sittings. The income of the minister arises wholly 
irom seat-rents, and six collections in the course of the year. At 



588 FORFAIISIIIIIE. 

the commencement, as might be supposed, a considerable debt lay 
upon this church ; but it deserves to be mentioned, as a fact cre- 
ditable to the managers, the people, and all concerned, that, in 
the course of a few years, a large portion of the debt was liquidat- 
ed, and a considerable addition made to the income of the minis- 
ter. In the village of Lochee, there are 120 Dissenting families ; 
3 or 4 Episcopalian do. ; and 12 Roman Catholic do. The last 
are strangers, chiefly from Ireland, who come in quest of employ- 
ment at the spinning-mills and other works. There is a Seces- 
sion Church in Lochee, containing 650 sittings. 

Prefixed to one of the parochial registers is a list of the minis- 
ters of Liflf from an early period, of which the following is a copy, 
with a few additions, which bring down the line of succession to 
the present time : Mr James.Duncan, date of admission not known ; 
Mr Andrew Wedderburn, admitted 29th July 1646 : Mr William 
Skinner, 19th August 1664; Mr John Chrystison, 30th July 
1673- Mr Alexander Scott, 16th August 1704; Mr Thomas 
Donaldson, 5th April 1726 ; Mr James Playfair, 19th November 
1758; Mr John Playfair, August 1773, resigned in 1782, after 
which a vacancy occurred of about three years, in consequence of 
a law-suit between the families of Lauderdale and Gray, respect- 
ing the right of presentation to Benvie ; Mr Thomas Constable 
12th May 1785; the present incumbent, 5th September 1817. 

Education.— parochial school and schoolmaster's house 
were rebuilt about twelve years ago, when the situation was chang- 
ed from Denmiln, at all times inconvenient, and, in winter, almost 
inaccessible for children, to the present spot, having the advantage 
of good roads in all directions, and being, in every respect, pre- 
ferable The accommodation is ample and excellent. Ihe 
lwelling-house consists of two stories. The school-room is large 
and lofty. The salary, the maximum. The school fees may 
amount to about L.40 per annum. The schoolmaster is also ses- 

sion-clerk. , . ti i • r T ;ff 

There \S a private or subscription school in Backmuii ot Litr.

past, and promises to be of great use to young females. It is vi-

supported by subscription and very moderate fees from the scholars. 

3. There are several other schools in the parish, supported en- 
tirely by fees from the scholars attending them. The number at 
school in the parish, in April last, was 501. 

Poor. — In consequence of the poor of the village of Lochee be- 
ing under the care of the kirk-session of Liff, and owing farther 
to the great increase of population in that village, and a propor- 
tional increase of pauperism, it has become necessary to have re- 
course to the legal mode of provision by assessment, which was 
first imposed during the last year 1841. Matters being in a 
transition state, in reference to the management of the poor, it 
may be sufficient to state the following particulars : 

The number presently receiving parochial aid is 49; the ave- 
rage sum allotted to each is 7s. per month ; temporary or occa- 
sional aid during the past year, L.25, 7s, 6d. ; house-rents dur- 
ing do. L,21, 7s. lOd. ; three patients in the Dundee Lunatic 
Asylum, and one boarded in the country, from L.60 to L.70. 

The amount of collections at the church, L.52, 8s.; assess- 
ment, L.250; dues from hearses, mortcloth, &amp;c. L.3I, lis. 6d. ; 
from the managers of Lochee church, L.15. 

There may still be found, lingering in the minds of some, a 
feelmg of reluctance to have recourse to parochial aid; but such 
cases have become rare. On the contrary, there is a great desire 
among the poor, generally, to get upon the roll, and that effected, 
the great struggle is, who shall get most. 

Connected with this subject, there is one fact that deserves no- 
tice, viz. the frequent desertion of families by one or both of the 
parents. The kirk-session of this parish has, at present, the chil- 
clren of five families thus cast upon them. And although, in some 
instances, it is perfectly known that the father is earning good 
wages at no great distance, such is the existing state of the law,

hint is perhaps conveyed to him of what is go.ng on, and ho re- 
moves to a different county, or plunges into one of our large com- 
mercial towns, where it becomes almost impossible, or, at "1 events, 
very troublesome and expensive to trace h.m i n,somuch that the 
session is induced rather to provide for the deserted fam, than 
Z expend money in a fruitless search after the parent. Even ,f 
he is discovered and subjected to a short ,mpr,sonment, h,s mam- 
tenance during his confinement, in add.fon to that of h,s family 
all on tt parish ; and no sooner is he set at hberty than, n, al 
p"lbility,he again decamps, setting at defiance the claims of 
humanity and justice, and the terrors of the law 

Weldently of the additional burden thus unfairly imposed on 
the poor's fund, there is something so revolting to every right feei- 
ng fn thus tra;pling upon the most sacred ties that hind together 
the social system, That the evil for it is a serious and growing 
evH calls loudly for the consideration of those who may have it m 
their power to provide a remedy. 

Fairs -There are no fairs held within this parish

PRESBYTERY OF DUNDEE, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. JOHN CURRIE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, §-e. — This parish was formerly called Muir- 
house, — a name indicative, it should seem, of the waste and un- 
cultivated state of a large proportion of the land, in ancient times. 
It is now universally known by the name of Murroes, which is 
doubtless an abbreviation of Muirhouse. 

It is irregular in figure ; 3 miles in length, and generally some- 
what more than 2 miles in breadth. The parishes of Dundee 
and Mains form its boundary on the south ; Mains and Tealing, 
on the west; Inverarity and Monikie, on the north; and Moni- 
fieth, on the east. 

Topographical Appearances. — The land almost invariably as- 
sumes an undulating appearance, and the acclivity, especially to- 
wards the northern boundary, is not inconsiderable. The greater 
part of the parish has a highly cultivated and pleasing aspect. 

Hydrography. — There are two rivulets connected with the pa- 
rish, which joins the Dighty at no great distance from its influx 
into the Tay. They serve to put in motion several thrashing and 
corn-mills, and a small one erected some years ago for spinning 
flax. 

Geology. — This parish possesses few attractions for the geolo- 
gist. There is, it may be mentioned, a plentiful supply of excel- 
lent freestone, of which the strata range nearly from east to west 
and beds of whinstone rock or the trap family are extensively dif- 
fused. — No plants of the rarer species have been noticed. 

There is no great diversity of soil. Black loam, incumbent 
upon rock, gravel, or clay, predominates. A considerable portion 
IS deep, active, and fertile ; the remainder is light, and much less 
productive.

II. — Civil Histoiiy. 
Eminent Persons.— \i would scarcely be proper to pass in si- 
lence the name of Mr Robert Edward, who was Episcopal mi- - 
nister here in the reign of Charles II., though a high rank can- 
not be claimed for him among men of eminence. He was a 
man of merit, and well versed in classical literature. In the 
year 1678, he pubhshed a succinct history of Angus, written 
in pure and elegant Latin, in which we are presented with an 
account of the leading families of the county, and a description of 
various places of note within its precincts. In the descriptive part 
of this curious and unique performance, he discovers great vivacity 
of fancy, and a marked and amusing partiality to his native county, 
which he praises with unsparing liberality. 

Land-oioners.—T\iQ number of proprietors is five : Thomas Fre- 
derick Scrymsoure Fothringhara a minor of Powrie; John Guth- 
rie, Esq. of Guthrie ; Frederick Lewis Scrymgeour Wedderburn, 
Esq. of Wedderburn and Birkbill ; John Millar, Esq. of Bal- 
lumbie ; and George Ogilvy Ramsay a minor of Westhall. 

Parochial Begisters.— The register of births and baptisms com- 
mences in 1746, and that of marriages so late as 1808. The re- 
cords of the kirk-session extend back to the 30th March 1698, 
on which day Mr James Marr, the first Presbyterian minister af- 
ter the Revolution, was inducted to the pastoral care of this parish. 
They appear to be kept with tolerable distinctness and regularity. 
The cases of discipline, it may be remarked, which were pretty nu- 
merous in the earlier part of the last century, are set down with a 
needless and offensive particularity. The morals of the people 
in those days were not so pure and irreprehensible as some « lau- 
datores temporis acti" are willing to believe. 

In the eventful year 1715, the leading heritor of the parish, as 
appears from the records, made a bold and extravagant display of 
attachment to the ill-starred House of Stuart, and predilection for 
Prelacy. The parochial minister having refused, as was to be expect- 
ed publicly to pray for the Pretender as the legitimate sovereign of 
these realms, and to recognize King George in his capacity of Elec- 
tor of Hanover, only drew down upon himself the high displeasureol 
this flaming partizan, who resolved to make him feel the effects ot 
his resentment. He despatched, accordingly, a body of armed men, 
,by whom the refractory minister was excluded from his church, ana 
a clergyman of the Episcopal persuasion introduced into his pulpit, 



MURROES.

who conducted Divine service for several Sundays in succession, 
to the no small annoyance of the bulk of the parishioners. The 
discomfiture of the insurgents at Sherilfmuir put an end to this 
bold intrusion. 

Antiquities. — The only memorials of the feudal times are the 
remains of three old castles, which, however, present no remark- 
able peculiarities either in structure or situation. Powrie is the 
property, and was long the residence, of the ancient family of Fo- 
theringham. Wedderburn, which is nearly levelled with the dust, 
is said, at a remote period, to have been the residence of the 
Gilchrists,— the powerful Thanes of Angus. And Ballumbie was 
the seat of a ftimily of Anglo-Norman extraction of the name of 
Lovel, which has long been extinct. 

A tradition prevails that Catherine Douglas, a personage of 
great celebrity in ancient Scottish story, was espoused to the heir- 
apparent of the last-mentioned family, and dwelt in the castle. 
This lady merited and has obtained unqualified applause for the 
bold and magnanimous though unavailing resistance she offered 
to the conspirators who assassinated the ablest and most estimable 
of the Stuarts, King James I. of Scotland, in the Blackfriars mo- 
nastery at Perth. Gagie is a secluded, sombre, and pleasing old 
place, amply shaded with trees. It belongs to Mr Guthrie of 
Guthrie, a gentleman of ancient descent, who occasionally passes a 
few days there. The house was built so long ago as the year 1614. 

Modern Buildings.— The House of Ballumbie, the residence of 
Mr Mdlar, is substantial and commodious. It stands in an agree- 
able and well-sheltered situation, and commands a fine prospect 
towards the south.

The increase of the population is, no doubt, mainly to be as- 
cribed to the miprovements in agriculture, which have been pro- 
secuted on rather an extended scale for a series of years, and the 
steady employment afforded to labourers at several valuable free 
stone quarries, which have been opened in the neighbourhood at 
a comparatively recent period.

niand for every species of farm produce, and a pleiiliful supply of 
every thing requisite for agricultural and domestic purposes. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is a plain and old-fashioned 
building. It stands on a pleasant spot, encompassed with lofty 
trees, in the south-east part of the parish, and at the distance of 
three miles from its western extremity. It is supposed to have 
been built prior to the Reformation, but the date of its erection is 
unknown. The aisle seems to have been added to the original 
building in the year 1642. The church is in tolerable repair, 
well-seated, and affords accommodation for about 400 people. 

The seats occupied by the tenantry and their families are gene 
rally annexed to the lands which they possess. A few pews be- 
long to the kirk-session; and one of the galleries, with the consent 
of the heritors, is let for the benefit of the poor; and the proprie- 
tor of Powrie allows the rent of some unappropriated pews in the 
aisle, which is his exclusive property, to be applied to the same be- 
nevolent purpose. The average number of communicants is 280, 
and divine service is generally well attended. There are few sec- 
taries in the parish. 

The manse, which was built in 1811, and repaired in 1832, is 
now sufficiently comfortable and commodious. 

The glebe rather exceeds five acres of good land, which nhay 
be estimated at L.15 a year. There is an allowance of L.l, 1 3s. 
4d. m lieu of pasture, which the present incumbent has not hither- 
to claimed. The stipend is, of money, L.106, 14s. 8d. ; of wheat, 
3 bolls 1 firlot ; of barley, 28 bolls 3 firlots ; of meal, 45 bolls 3 
pecks. The average amount of stipend for the last seven years, 
converted to money, is L.l 80 a year. The Crown is patron. 

Education. — The parochial school is generally well attended. 
All the ordinary branches of education, also the Greek and Latin 
languages, are taught very successfully. The salary of the school- 
master IS L.34, 4s. 4d. ; the fees and his emoluments as session- 
clerk may probably amount to L.26 annually. He is provided with 
more than the legal accommodations. There are no persons in 
the parish above six years of age unable to read. The people, ge- 
nerally speaking, are alive to the benefits of education, and show 
a laudable anxiety to have their children instructed in every es- 
sential branch. 

Poor. — The number of persons at present receiving parochial 
aid IS 6. The average allowance to each is 4s. monthly ; besides,

tliey receive occasional supplies in cases of emergency, and al- 
ways an annual sum for coals. It may be added, that the kirk_ 
session is extremely willing to lend a helping hand to deserving 
individuals or families involved in temporary difficulties. The 
poor certainly discover much less disinclination to seek for paro- 
chial relief than in former times. Still the spirit of mdependence 
is not wholly extinct. There are no assessments for the ordinary 
poor The" heritors defray the expense of supporting an msane 
man who lives with a private femily. They also contribute L. 10 
Sterlino- yearly towards the payment of the board of a pauper lu- 
natic in the asylum at Dundee. The deficiency is supplied from 
the ordinary funds. Annual amount of collections for the benefit 
of the poor, L.27 ; dues of morcloth, L.3, 10s.; seat rents, L.7, 
1 Is. ; interest of a capital of L.lOO, L.4; total L.42, Is. 

Alehouse.— The parishioners, generally speaking, show no dis- 
position to encourage the multiplication of public houses. There 
are only two in the parish, which are frequented chiefly by wayfar- 

ing people. . j x 

Vue/.— The fuel principally in use is English coals, imported at 

Dundee or Broughty Ferry.

I_ToPOGBAPHY AND NaTURAL HiSTORY. 

Name.—Tn name of the parish is of uncertain origin. It is 
sometimes spelled Roscobie. In former days it seems to have 
been called Rescolpyne, or Rescolbyne,t and Roscolpin. t 

Extent— The parish lies from east and by south, to west and 
by north. It is about 9 miles long, and from H to 2 broad, 
it contains perhaps about 17 square miles. 

Boundaries.-lt has the parish of Forfar on the west, Kirne

miiir on the north-west corner; Oathlaw or Finhaven and Aber- 
lemno on the north; Aberlemno, and Guthrie, and Kirkden on 
the east ; and Kirkden, and Dunnichen and Forfar on the south. 
The figure of the parish is very irregular. 

There are four hills connected with, though not wholly situated 
in the parish, — the hill of Dunnichen or Burnside, the top of 
which forms a part of its southern boundary; the Green hill of 
Burnside, to the north of the mansion-house ; the hill of Carse, 
in the north-west quarter of the parish •, and the Double hill, 
whose base is about half a mile to the north of the lake, called, 
on the east part, the hill of Turin, and on the west, the hill of 
Pitscandly. From the top of this hill, especially the east top, 
where it is called the hill of Turin, there is one of the finest and 
most extensive views, both of sea and land, any where to be had. 

The hills of Dunnichen and of Turin are said to rise about 600 
feet above the lakes ; and the lakes are said to be 186 feet 9 inches 
above high water at Arbroath. 

Hydrography.— TUe lake or loch of Rescobie, which intersects 
that part of the parish which lies between Dunnichen and Turin 
hills, is more than a mile long, and more than the third of a mile 
in breadth, where widest. The depth is very variable, being from 
2 to 20 feet. It is of ordinary temperature. 

The Lunan water, which has its source in the north-west part 
of Restenet Moss, runs through the lake of Rescobie from west to 
east, then through the lake of Balgavies, and, after a course of 
about ten miles farther, falls into the sea at Lunan Bay; and 
there is a streamlet or burn, called the Lerana, that takes its rise 
in the neighbouring parish of Aberlemno, giving, probably, that 
parish a part of its name, and running west through the lands of 
Carse, forms for some space the boundary betwixt this parish and 
Forfar on the south ; skirts the west side of this parish, forming 
there also the boundary between the parishes of Forflir and Res- 
cobie ; turns to the east, at the north-west boundary of the parish, 
where it bounds this parish from Kirriemuir; and running for four 
or five miles in an easterly direction, through the southern part of 
the parish of Oathlaw or Finhaven, discharges itself near Finhaven 
Castle, mto the Esk, nearly opposite to, or almost directly north 
of, its own source in Aberlemno. 

Geology and Mineralogy.— C\mx\es Lyell, Esq., Junior, of Kiu- 
nordy, has, in his Elements of Geology, given a section of twenty 
miles of Forfarshire, from north-west to south-east, from the foo"t 



FOUFARSIIIKE. 

of ll,e Grampians to ll,e sea at ArbroatU, in whicl. l.e clescribe, 
Turin Hill ; and this distrnguisl.ed geologist has most obhgmgly 
honoured the writer of this with a communieation eoneernmg the 
strata and rocks of Turin and Pitscandl, H.lls, wheretn he says 
" R scobie forms one of a great line of lakes and marshes wh.ch 
e. ends through Strathmore to the loch of Forfar, and from hence 
o tunan Bay Like most of these lochs, ,t ,s surrounded by h,l- 
ocks  d ridges of sand and gravel, containn,g boulders of many

fo mations, such as occur in the immedrate ne.ghbourhood

is 627 feet above the loch of Rescobie, and 814 above the sea, 
coSIt If the gray paving-stone "-tratified wrth cong— 
or pudding-stone ; the whole formmg one of the oldest members 
of the old red sandstone formation. 

" The dip of the beds in the Wemyss quarry, m the hdl ot Pus 
candly, is rather to the westward of north, and at an angle of 
about 16° ; it is more than forty feet thick, and .s covered by a 
mt of puddingstone about thirty feet in thickness. In the Ml 
Tt Turin-there Jre two cliffs, one above the other, facng to the 
south, in both of which freestone and conglomerate appear. 

" On the farm of Baldardie, the pebbles in the conglomerate con- 
sist not only of white quartz, chlorite slate, trap, and other cys- 
i, e and igneous rolks, but aUo of well-rounded masses of a 
ed ::ndstoufw,th quartz pebbles. This fact deserves not.ce a 
showing, that in this region, a more anc.ent red stone had been 
rm d consolidated, broken up, and rounded by water before one 
of the ddest portions of the old red of F"-'- .""f "''J/,

Tliis fault, which is about a foot wide at the surface, widens as it 
descends to nine feet, below which it has not been worked. The 
materials with which the rent has been filled are composed of the 
ruins of the pavement beds. 

" Boulders and Erratics. — Over the surface of the hills of Pits- 
candly and Turin, especially on the northern slope, at consider- 
able heights, are scattered many blocks, both rounded and angu- 
lar, of rocks which must have been transported from great dis- 
tances. They are mingled confusedly with fragments which have 
been derived from the contiguous hills. Some of the erratics are 
of hornblende-slate ; others of mica-slate. One of these last, 
measuring three feet in its longest diameter, occurs within fifty 
feet of the summit of Turin Hill ; but the example most worthy 
of notice is to be seen about fifty feet below the top of the hill 
of Pitscandly, about 500 yards north-west of the farm of Baldar- 
die. The block consists of mica-slate, of a hard and durable 
kind, in which the quartz predominates, and in which the laminae 
are much bent and zig-zaged. This kind of rock is seen in situ 
on the northern extremity of the Creigh Hill, north of the lake 
of Lintrathen ; and this is one of the nearest points in the Gram- 
pians, from which the block in question could have been trans- 
ported. The fragment is angular, and measures 13 feet in length 
by 7 in breadth, and stands 7 feet high above ground : close to 
it, are four other angular pieces of the same kind of rock, from 
three to six feet in diameter. Few geologists, of the present day, 
will be disposed to deny, that this huge fragment must have been 
carried into its present position by the agency of ice; although a 
great difference of opinion may exist, respecting the manner in 
which it and its companions were conveyed from the Grampians, 
across the intervening hollow of Strathmore, and lodged in what 
may be considered as the flanks of the Sidlaw hills. 

" Organic Remains. — The only ones hitherto met with, occur in 
the pavement of Quarry Park, and appear to be vegetable impres- 
sions. The same have been met with in Fife, and have been 
called fucoidal. One of them consists of an assemblage of small 
hexagonal plates, first noticed by the Rev. Dr Fleming, in a si- 
milar stone, and of the same age, near Flisk, in Fife." 

Thus far the learned professor. The writer hereof may only 
add, that in the upper Wemyss quarry, or quarry north of Wemyss 
farm-house, a fossil tree is stated to have been found imbedded 
in a stratum of calmstone ; and that the trunk, the branches, and

even the leaves were distinctly visible. James Powrie, Esq. of 
Reswallle, has in his possession a portion of it that had been ap- 
parently near the root. 

There are five quarries on the south side of Pitscandly and 
Turin hills : one of them not wrought at present. In the four 
that are wrought, the point and amount of dip of the strata were 
taken by the minister and schoolmaster of the parish, and are as 
follow :— In the Quarry Park, the .point of dip is from 30° to 40" 
east of the magnetic north, that is, from more than half a point 
to rather more than a point to the east of true north, and the 
amount of dip is from 6 to 6| inches on a yard ; that is, forming 
an angle of about 10°. In the Turin Hill quarry, the dip points 
exactly to the magnetic north ; and the amount of dip is nine 
inches on a yard ; that is, the angle of dip is 14°. In Wemyss 
upper quarry, the point of dip is also the magnetic north, and the 
amount of dip is 8i inches on a yard ; thus forming an angle of 
dip of nearly 13° ; and in Wemyss lower quarry," the pomt of dip 
is also to the magnetic north ; and ihe amount of dip or inclina- 
tion is 9f inches on a yard ; or at an angle of rather more than 
15°. 

It is evident from the preceding statements that the point of dip 
of the Quarry Park alone is a little to the east of true north. In 
the other three quarries, it is to the west of the true north, just as 
far as the declination or variation of the compass, that is, about 
two'points west of true north. It is to be observed also, that the 
amount of dip is different in all the quarries. In the Park Quarry, 
it was a little different in different places. And between the upper 
and lower Wemyss quarries, there is the difference of an mch and 
a half upon a yard, although the two quarries do not seem to be 
much above aliundred yards distant from one another. 

The way in which the conglomerate repeatedly alternates m 
some of these quarries with the paving-stone is truly astonishuig. 
It may be stated also, that all the workmen that have been at the 
different quarries in the county, attest that, north of Vmey water 
the dip of the strata is to the north, and that to the south of that 
water it is to the south. The same also plainly appears from Pro- 
fessor Lyell's section of Forfarshire in his Elements of Geology. 

In the loch of Rescobie, there is still a considerable quantity ol 
m.rl There are in many places two beds or deposits,-the up- 
per bed consists of fine shell marl, though at times intermixed 



TlESCOBlfi.

with clay, sand, moss, and other extraneous substances; the lower 
bed is of inferior quality, of a sandy colour, and has but few shells. 
The marl in the loch was dragged till of late years, and used as a 
manure, especially in compost. And the fiirmers of Drimmie and 
Turin, that are liferenters, have still a right by their leases to 
drag marl yearly for their respective farms ; and they had for 
many years a boat for the purpose. This privilege, however, for 
some time past, has not been exercised. 

The soils in the parish are very various. Some fields are of a 
thin moorish soil. Some are gravelly sharp land, and bear a 
heavy boll. Some are clayey, and some loamy. There is not 
unfrequeutly a considerable variety of soil, not only on the 
same fiu-m, but in the same field. On a good part of the estate 
of Carse, and also of the estate of Pitscandly, the soil is, for this 
part of the country, particularly fertile. 

Zoology. — The writer knows of no very rare species of animals 
in the parish. The roebuck, Cervus capreolus, is now and then 
seen in the woods of Burnside. Falco ceruginosus, moor-buzzard, 
was seen by Mr Don on the hills of Turin and Pitscandly. The 
wild swan. Anas cygnus, has occasionally visited our lake, but very 
seldom. Anas Strepera, the gadwall or grey duck, and A. penehpey 
or wigeon, are visitors of it. Ardea stellaris, the bittern, a rare 
bird, is sometimes to be seen in the lake of Rescobie. Tetrao te- 
trix, the blackcock, two of which Mr Don of Forfar mentions 
were shot at Turin hill in the winter of 1794, is now not uncom- 
mon. It is seen occasionally in the eastern quarter of the parish. 
Emberiza Sckceniclus, reed-bunting, i« common near the lake. Mo- 
tacilla salicaria, reed-sparrow, is seen among the reeds by the 
side of the lake, but it is not very common. 

The loch of Rescobie would abound, were it not for the nume- 
rous fishers from Forfar, in pike, and perch, and eel ; but there is 
no trout. Pike has occasionally been taken out of the lake, of a 
large size. The largest that the writer has himself seen, was about 
17 or 18 pound weight, and about a feet long; but considerably 
larger are said to have been caught. Of worms, of the order In- 
testina, the following, Planaria jusca and lactea, are found in the 
lake of Rescobie. 

Botany.— m Don, in his « Account of the native plants in the 
county of Forfar," says, Helvdla spatlmlata, and Clavaria mili- 
aris, are to be found in General Hunter's woods at Burnside, be- 
sides a great many others. I may also add the Boletus perennis, 



CD2 FORFAUSIIIRE. 

versicolor, abietirius, siiherosm, and igniarlus : the latter is called 
touch-wood, being used for tinder. Also the Riccia fructiculosa, 
with Jungermannia scalaris, albicans, ovata, trichomanis, and ex- 
cisa. 

"When the botanist traverses the marshes, and examines the 
lakes, he will find his trouble amply repaid. In the lakes of For- 
far, Rescobie, and Balgavies, he will meet with the Typlia latifo- 
lia ; this is also in a rivulet not far from Pilmuies, by the side of 
the'turnpike road that leads from Forfar to Arbroath. In the lakes 
of Rescobie and Balgavies, are likewise to be found NymphcBa lu- 
tea and alba, and Ceratophyllum demersum ; and on their margins, 
Lysimachia thyrsiflora ; the latter plant, though rare in other 
parts of Britain, is not uncommon in Angus-shire. Potamogeton 
perfoliatum, lucens, crispum, pectinaium, compressum, graminewn, 
pusillum, likewise occur in these lakes. Cicuta virosa, which is 
one of the most virulent of all ;the vegetable poisons, grows on 
their margins. Cattle, when allowed to browse by the sides of the 
lakes in the winter months, are sometimes deceived, by its smell 
being very weak at that season ; and when once they have eaten it, 
it generally proves fatal in two or three hours. When the summer 
is I little advanced, the odour of the plant warns the cattle, and 
then they carefully avoid it. The Scirpus lacustris, the well known 
rush so much used for making rush-bottomed chairs, is common. 

The more remarkable plants in the parish are the following: 
Dianthus Armeria, discovered on fields near the seat of Charles 
Gray, Esq. of Carse, the only place where Mr Don had seen it 
in Scotland, Crepis pulchra, among the debris of the rocks of the 
bills of Turin and Pitscandly, but very rare,-and one ot the 
Zoophyta, the connecting link between the vegetable and animal 
kingdom, called the Spongia lacustris, observed by Mr Don in the 

lake of Rescobie. , • • a o 

Plantations.— l\iexe are several thriving plantations in the pa- 
rish, though of no great extent. They consist chiefly of common 
larch, and spruce fir, though frequently intermixed with ash, and 
oak, and birch, and elm. There are soils congenial to every sort 
of timber. 

n. — Civil History. 
Rescobie seems, in times long since gone by, to have been a 
place of considerable consequence. It once had its castle hke 
other places of importance ; but not a vestige of it now remain. 
The place where it stood cannot with certainty be pointed out, 



RESCOBIE. 



603- 



accurately ascertained. Tradition bears that the name of the 
castle was Bairnsdale, or Barnsdale, perhaps a corruption of Banes- 
dale, and that the foundations of the castle are still to be seen in 
the loch in a clear day. It is evident from the kirk-session re- 
cords, that Rescobie once had its kirk-town ; but this town also has 
disappeared. 

Rescobie is said to have been a considerable burgh of barony. 
It seems to have formed a part of the archdeaconry of St Andrews, 
and it gave name to a barony within the regality of St Andrews. 
In 1557, the Archdeacon of St Andrews, with the permission of 
the Archbishop and chapter, granted to Richard Shoreswood a 
charter of the lands of Wilkieston in Fife, and of the brewlands 
and alehouse of Rescobie, 

In 1561, at the general assumption of the rents of ecclesiastical 
benefices, the spirituality of the kirk of Rescobie is stated as a part 
of the benefice of the archdeacon. And in the Archbishop's tax 
roll of 1630, Pitscandly, Carsebank, Carse, Balmadies, and mill 
of Rescobie, appear among the lands which held of the archiepis- 
copal see. 

Eminent Characters. — King Dofnald, or Donald the seventh, 
called by some Donald Bane, the brother of Malcolm Canmore,f 
is said to have died in confinement at Rescobie, anno 1097. After 
being defeated and taken prisoner, his eyes were put out by the or- 
ders of his nephew, King Edgar, according to the cruel policy of 
a barbarous age. The " Chronicon Elegiacum," a monkish poem, 
alluding to these things, says, 

" Rursus Dofnaldus, Duncano rege perempto, 
Ternis rex annis regia sceptra tenet. 
Captus ab Edgaro vita pi ivatus. At ille 
Rescolpyne obiit : ossaque lona tenet. "J 

For Rescolpyne there is given as a various reading in the mar- 
gin, Rescolbyne. It has been doubted whether the expression in 
the third line, " vita privatus," means that King Donald was re- 
duced to, and lived in a private condition, or that he was put to 
death by Edgar. But the words that follow seem plainly to re- 
strict the expression to the first of these interpretations. Of this 
illustrious but unfortunate personage, it is said again, « Donald 
Mac-Donachat regnavit iii. annis. Hie captus est ab Edgar Mac-

Valued Rent— The valued rent of the parish is now thought to 
be L.2586 Scots. In the tables attached to Mr Headrick's sur- 
vey of the county, the valued rent is said to be L.'2615, 16s. 8d. 
Scots When Mr Headrick's tables were drawn up, the real rent 
of the parish is stated to have been L.1800 Sterling. It would 
now be, if all the liferent leases were expired, considerably upwards 
of L.rjOOO. 

Land-oioners.— The land-owners of the parish are, Charles 
Gray, Esq. of Carse, who has of valued rent in this parish L.580, 
13s 4d Scots; John Farquhar, Esq. of Pitscandly, L. 566, 13s.

L 188 13s. 4d., and no valued rent at all, so far as can be seen, for 
the lands of Turin, lying in this parish ; James Anderson, Esq. of

There are two other proprietors, the proprietor of Dunnicben, 
and the proprietor of Guthrie, who have some acres of land, and 
each of them a house in the parish, but who are liable to no pub- 
lic burdens whatever. 

Parochial Registers.-The date of the earliest entry i" the pa- 
rochial register is 23d December 1677. The register of diciplme, 
and of receipt and expenditure of poor's funds, p.-ev,ous to the or- 
dination of the present incumbent, consists of three volumes. 
There are several chasms or blanks between the dates in some 
,nrts The third volume is not filled up beyond December 1/85. 
Since the admission of the present minister, two new volumes have 
b e commenced and continued,-one for minutes of discqol.ne, 
and another for receipt and expenditure of the poors funds. 
There at, besides, a register of baptisms or births, and another 
fnr nroclamation of bans. .

RESCODIE. 605 



to this date, November 1840, there have been seven ministers of 
Rescobie, namely, Mr Patrick Lyon, who succeeded Mr David 
Lindsay, and was ordained 23d December 1677, and died in Au- 
gust 1703. Mr John Dougall, who was admitted 22d March 
1704, and died 1st December 1723. Mr John Dougall, said to 
be son of the preceding, who was admitted 15th September 1725, 
and deposed about May 1748. Mr Robert Trail, who was ad- 
mitted on the 21st July. 17-9, and translated to Panbride, Octo- 
ber 1763. Mr William Key, who was admitted April 26th 1764, 
and died September 1776. Mr Thomas Wright, who was admit- 
ted on 3d April 1777, and died on 9ih April 1808; and Mr 
William Rogers, who was admitted on the lOth May 1809. 

From the session records it appears also, that there was a Mr 
William Arthur presented to the parish, but not ordained. On 
Sd July 1748, an intimation is given of a meeting of Presby- 
tery " to be held at Rescobie the 14th instant, and then to offer 
Mr William Arthur, the patron's presentee, to the parish." On the 
14th, the Presbytery met according to appointment, but it is not 
said what was done. The presentee, however, seems never to have 
been accepted of, or admitted; for on the 8th January 1749, an- 
other meeting of Presbytery is intimated to be held on the 19th, 
to make an offer of Mr Trail to the parish to be their minister. 

Dunng the period already mentioned, namelv, from 1687 to 
1840, it appears that there were 27 schoolmasters in this parish 
For a considerable time, they are spoken of as admitted to the of- 
fice of reader and schoolmaster. And it appears that the Pres- 
bytery were then accustomed sometimes to delegate their power 
of deposition of schoolmasters to kirk-sessions; for, in a minute 
of session, dated 2d February 1735, a Mr Walker is, accordina to 
an act passed by the Presbytery to that effect, deposed by die 
minister and session in the Presbytery's name. 

Antiquities.—Theve are two stones at Blackgate of Pitscandly 
concerning which there have been various conjectures. Some have 
imagined them to be rude monuments of distinguished chiefs that 
fell there ,n battle. Now Buchanan informs us that there was a 
very bloody battle fought at Restenet betwixt the Picts and the 
Scots, when Feredeth, King of the Picts, was slain. This battle 
took place about the year 831, when Alpin was King of the Scots 
Buchanan says, - cruentissima pugna usque ad noctem incerta 
victoria confl,xerunt.- Restenet is near to Pitscandly, which is 

 Rerum Scoticarum Histoiia, Lib. v. cap. 57. 



G06 FOUFAIISHIRE. 

sai.l to mean the grave of the multitude. I.ideed, in early clajs,= 
the mansion-house of Pitscandly was on the northern border of the 
lake of Restenet, where it is not improbable the battle mentioned 
by Buchanan, took place. The learned and Rev. Mr Headr.ck 
of Dunnichen, however, seems to think these stones the remains 
of a Druidical circle, and states that it is the only one he has 
seen in the county of Angus. He speaks of some of the stones 
having been " demolished, so that the circle is not now complete. 
This may be the true state of the case. It is not impossible that 
the large stone, which is more than ten feet high and more than 
six feet broad, marks the place where Feredeth, King of the P.cts, 
fell, or was buried ; and that the other stone is in memory of some 
other inferior but also distinguished chief. Many of high rank 
fell at the same time with the King. Buchanan says, " cum flore 
nobilitatis una interiit." t. • .1 a 

There is also a ruin on the top of Turm Hill. It is thus de- 
scribed by Mr Wright in his Statistical Account : " It has evi- 
dently been anciently a stronghold, or place of defence, consisting 
of various extensive contiguous buildings, with a circular citadel of 
Ibout forty yards in diameter. The situation has been wel cho- 
sen, being secured by an impregnable rock in front, much like he 
T.l nf Salisbury Crags, and of difficult access all around. It is 
trc alS Castle." The Rev. Mr Headr. 

takes no notice of this ruin; but it is evident from what he aj 
tith regard to others, that he would class it among the hiU-for ts 
Tha w fe very skilfully built of rude stones without any cement. 
And he thinki that their original object was to protect particular 
ttbes 41st the violence of their neighbours, with whom they ex-

IS still visible; but the fort is entirely demolished, only one or two 
of the foundation stones remaining, and these almost wholly cover- 
ed over with grass. 

The Castle of Rescobie has been already mentioned. There 
were, till lately, the ruins of another place called Weems or 
Weniyss Castle, — a little to the north-east of the farm of West- 
mains of Turin. It is said to have been possessed by one Lind- 
say, who was a relative of another of the same name at Balgavies 
in the parish of Aberlemno, and where the ruins of a castle are 
still distinctly visible. These two Lindsays, it is said, united their 
forces, and beat off Kemp, the possessor of the stronghold on the 
top of the Hill of Turin, and compelled him to retire to another 
castle that he had at Dunnottar. The ruins of this castle or fort 
were, a few years ago, completely removed. 

There is a place on the farm of Rescobie, belonging to Mr 
Anderson of Clacksbriggs, which was formerly called the Bloody 
Butts. Perhaps this is a corruption of Blood-witts, which was a 
fine paid to the superior in cases of manslaughter, on account of 
the proprietor losing so much of his property or live-stock, — for so 
the common people were once accounted, being viewed as adscripf.i 
glebcE. This portion of land, then, may have once been paid as a 
compensation for blood that had been shed. 

When the railroad was forming, the workmen came upon 
one of those subterraneous buildings called weems, probably from 
the Gaelic wumb, a cave. It was on the farm of Wemyss of Pits- 
candly, in the third field from the farm-house, and near to where 
the bridge is, that crosses the railroad. There was an ancient 
hand-mill, called a quern, found in it, and a good deal of ashes 
towards the inner end. Some think that these subterraneous build- 
ings were hiding-holes, formed by the ancient inhabitants, for the 
purpose of concealing both their persons and property, during sea- 
sons of danger. Others, again, have supposed that they were 
winter habitations of the rude natives. 

There is on the estate of Balmadies, or Ochterlonv, and farm 
of Chapelton, a cemetery, called the chapel-yard. In that bury- 
ing-ground, there are 18 stones, 15 of which are in a row, belong- 
ing to the Pearsons of Balmadies. The oldest date which can be 
discovered on the stones is 9th June 1625, and the latest 10th 
November 177 J. It is probable that this had been a Roman 
Catholic erection.

with a mixture here and there of the Durham. 

Manufactures. — The only manufacture in the parish is that of 
coarse white linen. The number employed in weaving it, is 29 
males and 26 females. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Toxon. — The nearest market-town is Forfar, distant 
rather more than three miles from the parish church. There is 
no village in the parish, and only four or five hamlets. 

Means of Commvnication. — There is no post-office. There 
are two turnpike roads that extend through the pai-ish from west 
to east, one from Forfar, running on the south side of the loch to 
Arbroath, and another from Forfar, on the north side of the loch, 
to Montrose. And there is the turnpike road from Forfar to 
Brechin, that extends through the west and north-west end of the 
parish. There is also the Auldbar turnpike from Brechin, which 
skirts a small part of the east side of the parish. The length of 
all these in the parish, cannot be less than nine or ten miles. 
The state of the bridges and fences in the parish is good. 

The railroad betwixt Forfar and Arbroath was opened in De- 
cember 1838, constructed for conveying passengers and goods. 
It has hitherto succeeded beyond expectation, especially in the 
number of passengers conveyed since it was opened. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church is centrically placed. It 
was built in 1820, is in good repair, and abundantly large for the 
population. It affords accommodation for 560 persons with ease. 

The manse was built in the summer of 1837, is a substantial 
house, and has a neat appearance in front. The church and 
manse are beautifully situated on the north side of the lake. 

The extent of the glebe is betwixt eight and nine Scotch acres, 
or about eleven acres imperial. Some part of the glebe is well 
worth L.2 an acre, and some of it scarcely worth L.l. 

The amount of the stipend is L.l 30, 12s. Sd. Sterling, and 
68 bolls, 1 firlot, 3i lippies of meal, and 28 bolls, 3 firlots, and 
3| lippies of barley. 

The number of families attending the Established Church is 
132; the number of communicants 350. 

The number of families of Dissenters, is, one family of Inde- 
pendents, three of Episcopalians, seven of the United Associate 
5ynod, and one family of no religious profession. 

The number of communicants, belonging to these Dissenter« 



GIO FORFARSHIRE. 

is, of Independents, 3 ; of Episcopalians, 11 ; of the United As- 
sociate Synod, 16. There is, besides, one servant woman, an 
Anabaptist, and another a Roman Catholic, in the parish In , 
one or two cases, the heads of families are Dissenters, and the 
families themselves belong to the Established Church In some 
other cases, there is a servant a Dissenter, dst the heads and 
all the rest of the family belong to the Established Church. 

Eclacation.-i:hev is no school at present in the parish, except 
the parochial ; and in it the ordinary branches of education are 
tau-ht The fees are very moderate. The salary of the school- 
master is L.31. The average amount of school fees per annum 
is L.10, or L.ll. The schoolmaster has the legal accommoda- 

'zifirar/.— There is a parochial library in the parish, conducted 
by a committee of managers. 
. Poor and Parochial Funds.- V'e number of poor at present on 
the roll or receiving parochial aid, is 12. The number varies from 
8 to 12 or 13. Besides the regular monthly allowance, there are 
sums paid for house-rents, coals, clothes, funeral expenses, &amp;c. 
amounting to about L.12 a year for the last seven years The 
average yearly amount of church collections for the last seven 
years is L.26, 8s. 3id. The yearly average amount of other funds 
for the same period is L.9, 1 Is. 8|d. As w have, for a number 
of years, been expending more than we have been receiving, the 
heritors have kindly and wisely come forward and contribute a 
sum every half-year in order to prevent the funds we have 
from being wholly swept away. The disposition among the 
poor to refrain from seeking parochial relief is still exhibited m 
some few instances ; but it is fast disappearing. 

Favrs.-T\Bxe are no fairs held now in the parish. In former 
days, but very long ago, there was one held near the manse. 1 ra- 
dition calls it St Triduane's, commonly pronounced St irod 
lin's. It is now held at Forfar ; but there i. a stone still standing 
near the kirk-stile, where, it is said, the superior of the fair, Lord 
Strathmore, or his deputy, held, on fair days his court. 
Alehouses.-'V\Bxe are three alehouses in the parish. 
iMeZ.-The principal fuel used in the parish is coal, procurea 
usually from Arbroath.

PRESBYTERY OF MEIGLE, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. JAMES OGILVY HALDANE, MINISTER, 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Sfc. — The parish is said to have derived its name from 
three GaeHc words, signifying the head or junction of the burn of 
the Drums. 

Extent, Sfc. — The figure of the parish being very irregular, only 
an approximation to its extent can be given. It may be said to . 
contain about 20 imperial square miles. It is bounded by the pa- 
rishes of Kirriemuir and Cortachy on the north and east; by 
Airiie, on the south ; and by Lintrathen, on the west. The sur- 
face of the ground everywhere presents an undulating appearance. 
Considerable tracts of level land intervene between ridges of low 
hills, which are themselves frequently indented. The banks of 
Baldovie, Balfour, and Meikle Kenny present a very agreeable 
appearance; while those adjoining to Pearsie, though less exten- 
sive, are not inferior in beauty. The parish is situated in the 
braes of Angus. Catlaw, the highest hill, rises to the height of 
2264 feet above the level of the sea, from which may be had one 
of the most extensive prospects in Scotland. The German Ocean, 
from Montrose round to the Frith of Forth, great part of the 
coast of Fife, the Bell-rock Lighthouse, Berwick Law, Arthur 
Seat, together with some of the highest mountains in the Western 
Highlands, are discernible. To the north may be observed some 
of the loftiest mountains of the Grampian range. 

Meteorology. — The lower division of the parish is elevated about 
600 feet above the level of the sea, from which it is about twenty- 
four miles distant. The atmosphere is exceedingly dry and pure, 
except in the neighbourhood of morasses, of which there are still 
a few. 

Hydrography. — The parish is everywhere abundantly supplied 
with water. The principal streams are the Prosen, Melgum or 



Q12 FOllFARSHIUE. 



r...ivr«»..  

Melgund, and Carrity. They all afford excellent fishing for small i 
tFout. Salmon seldom frequent them, except at the spawning 
season The Burn of Crombie may also be mentioned. It passes , 
the village of Kingoldrum, and, after forming a sort of sernicircle , 
falls into tbe Melgum. There are several sprmgs m different 
parts of the parish, the waters of which are cha ybeate. Ihere is 
a cascade, or rather a series of waterfalls, called the Loops of 
Kenny The river Melgum suddenly enters a narrow, deep, and 
tortuous channel, in passing through which it is precipitated at 
short intervals from a very considerable he.ght. The scenery 

here is much admired. i, i • j 

Q,,loar,.—The parish is characterized by several parallel ndges, 
which run from east to south-west. The lowest of these, namely, 
the Kaimes of Airlie, is composed of the great conglomerate. 
On the top of the ridge the imbedded pebbles are very numerous; 
but where the ridge falls to the north and south, tbe sands one 
greatly predominates, and is here used for building. The dip is 
Lous.' The next ridge is that of the KirktonhiU Schurroc 
&amp;c. It is trap, or rather conglomerate composed of vanous 
Trap rocks. To the north of this ridge, in the valley vvhich 
ntervenes betwixt it and the next, occurs a/il-of -rpenUne the 
features of which are very interesting, and which are veiy fully 
des 1 bed by Mr Lyell, in Vol. iii. of the Edinburgh Journal of 
Sc ence. Ait occurs at the West Balloch, in the parish of Kirrie. 
uir this dike is very remarkable, and well worthy of minute inspec. 
r ' " After leaving the West Balloch," says Mr Lyell, « .first

• n ihe Darish of Kingoldrum. The small burn in who e

yard and Catlaw, immediately north of the last-mentioned strata, 
are composed of greywacke, clay-slate, and mica slate. A bed 
of blue slate is found to run tiirough these hills; but it is not sup- 
posed that it would be profitable to open it up. Boulders of the 
primitive rocks, bearing the action of water, or some hard sub- 
stance, are to be found in all parts of the parish. The distribu- 
tion of the ground, especially on the property of Pearsie, is highly 
favourable to the glacier theory. Tlie numerous mounds of gra- 
vel, &amp;c. of every variety of position, size and form, are evidently 
the detritus of the neighbouring hills. These have been quoted 
by Mr Lyell in confirmation of his late opinions in reference 
to such deposits. Part of the Loch of Kinnordy is in the parish, 
and the marl procured from it has been much used by the farmer 
for the improvement of grass lands. Peat mosses are very com- 
mon. Oak trees have been found in them of much greater size 
than any that grow at the present day. On the top of Catlaw is 
a moss of considerable extent. On the north shoulder of the 
wester Schurroch, and betwixt that and the river Melgum, occurs 
a bed of a variety of porcelain clay. The soil resting on the 
great conglomerate is partly of a sandy nature, partly moorish 
and partly of a mortary till. That on the trap formation is a rich 
loam : this forms the best land in the parish. To the north of 
the church there are about fifty acres of clay soil, lying on a bed of 
moss, which has been formed by water. The land in the north- 
ern part of the parish is composed partly of black earth, intermix- 
ed with a sandy soil, and some parts are very moorish. 

Botany. — The plants distributed over the parish are such as 
are generally found in upland and subalpine situations. The fol- 
lowing, being of local or less frequent occurrence, may be men- 
tioned : —

The following species are occasionally to be met with in the 
neighbourhood of houses : Anchusa sempervirens, Verhascum thap- 
svs, Agrimonia eupatoria, Chelidonium majus. Viola palustris is 
found on Catlavv, at about 1500 feet above the level of the sea. 
Echium vulfjare sometimes appears in cultivated fields. Lych- 
nis viscaria grows in great abundance on rocks on the banks of the 
Melgum. Cerastium arvense is pretty common on gravelly soil. ; 
Acinos vulgaris is very abundant on light ground having a south- 
ern exposure. Listera cordata is not unusal in woods. Lemna 
trisulca may be more particularly noticed. This singular plant 
is found along the course of a spring that rises in the swampy 
ground below the hill of Landhead, and is associated with Vera- 
nica scutellata and Myosotis palustris. We are not aware that 
this plant has been found in a more northern habitat. 

The plantations are principally composed of larch and Scotch 
fir Some old Scotch fir at Balnathrash, on the estate of Pearsie, 
is very superior. Though it has a cold northern exposure, the 
trees have attained a great size, and are considered nearly equal 
in qualitv to those which grow in the forests of Braemar. Ihe 
larch planted within the last thirty years is not in a thriving con- 
dition. The trees become infected with canker, and gradually 
decay There is a good deal of natural wood around and near 
the house of Pearsie, composed of birch, oak, and alder copse. 

II. — Civil History. . 
The chartulary of Aberbrothock, which is preserved in the Li- 
brary of the Faculty of Advocates, contains the only authentic re- 
cords which throw any light upon the early history of the parish. 
These records are, so far as they are connected with the pansb 
particular in their details, and embrace the period betwixt 1253 
and 1500. They are presented to us in a form somewhat repul- 
sive, but convey much information, particularly interesting to the 
antiquarian. By a foundation charter of William the Lion, the 
whole lands are made over to the abbey of Aberbrothock. Ihis 
grant is confirmed by Alexander III., and afterwards by Robert 
Bruce. The words of the charter are, " Kyncoldrum cum sua 
tota skyra," &amp;c. and again " totam terram suam et nemora mea 
de Kyngoldrum schyr in forestam." From this, Tytler m h 
History of Scotland remarks, that the term shire was ancientlj 
given to districts of much smaller extent than the «;"ffsh.ps of 
the present day. Tliere is a proclamation of Alexander IH. pro- 
hibi ingany one from cutting wood or hunting in the fo.est ot 



KINGOLDRUM. 



615 



Kingoldrum, without the consent of the abbots " Quare proliibeo 
firmiter nequis in eis," &amp;c. Three perambulations made at dif- 
ferent periods by the abbots and monks distinctly mark out the 
boundaries of the parish. It is not a little remarkable, that the 
names then given to the several farms and hamlets 600 years ago 
are the same as at the present time. What portion of the parish 
was covered by the royal forest it would now be difficult to say, 
as no traces of it can be discovered. Flint arrow-heads have been 
picked up in the fields to the eastward of the church. Perliaps 
these may have been used in the pursuit of the chase. 

Eminent Characters. — Scott, an eminent judge in Toronto in 
Upper Canada, was the son of a minister of that name in this 
parish. 

Land-oioners. — The landed proprietors in order of their valued 
rent are : Thomas Farquharson, Esq. of Baldovie ; David Wed- 
derburn, Esq. of Pearsie ; The Right Honourable The Earl of 
Airlie; the Heirs of the late Alexander Stormont, Esq. of Kin- 
clune; The Honourable Colonel Ogilvy of Clova; Mrs Colonel 
Young of Ascreavie. 

Peter Wedderburn Ogilvy, Esq. of Ruthven, possesses a small 
part called the Mill and Mill lands of Auld Allan ; but for some 
reason unknown, he has never been reckoned as an heritor. 

Parochial Registers. — There are six volumes belonging to the 
kirk-session. They have been accurately kept, save during the 
incumbency of one clerk of session. Parents are very negligent 
in registering the births of their children. 

Antiquities.—The Castle of Balfour, built by Cardinal Beaton, 
is the only building of antiquity. It has long been dismantled, 
and a ruin, but must originally have been a place of consi- 
derable strength. The structure is in the Gothic style. The 
family of Balfour has long ago sunk into that of Fotheringham 
of Powrie. Mr Farquharson of Baldovie, the present proprietor, 
lately caused two wings of the castle to be taken down, to afford 
materials for the erection of a farm-house. The beauty of the 
old ruin has been, in consequence, in a great measure destroyed. 

There were on the hill called Schurroch, at three different 
places equally distant from each other, several large stones, erect- 
ed in a circular form called Druidical temples. One of these 
has been removed. Upon the top of the hill, Catlaw, there is a 
large cairn of stones ; but whether these stones be the ruin of 
some rude building, or a place of observation from whence sig- 



610 FORFARSHIRE. 

nals might be. given on the approach of an enemy, is uncertain. 
Stone coffins have occasionally been found in the fields. On tak- 
ino- down the old church, various stones, on which singular devices 
had been cut, were discovered imbedded in the building. Two 
stones on which crosses are finely carved, with accompanying 
hieroglyphics, may be particularly mentioned. These stones it is 
probable had their origin about the time of the introduction of 
Christianity into our country, and would seem to be a connecting 
link betwixt Pagan mythology and Christian worship Severa 
rude relics which may have been esteemed precious in the time of 
Romish supremacy were likewise found. . 

Mansion-Houses.— The mansion-house of Baldovie occupies a 
hiffhlY agreeable and well sheltered situation. It is ornamented 
by wood, and a great part of the land in its neighbourhood is of 
the richest description. The house of Pearsie is still more plea- 
santly 'situated and ornamented. The farm-houses that have been 
erected within the last twenty years have been greatly improved 
in appearance and accommodation. 

HI. — Population. 
The population of the parish has very much decreased in 
amount. Several small villages have entirely disappeared, and the 
sites of cottages to about the number of fifty, once the residence 
of a hardy, industrious, and attached peasantry, can now with dif- 
ficulty be traced.

more convenient to the neighbourhood, than ornamental to his 
property. 

Habits of the People, 5"C.— The people, generally speaking, are 
obliging, hospitable, and affable. They are peaceable and inoffen- 
sive in their dealings, generally moral in their behaviour, attentive 
to the ordinances of religion, regular in their attendance in the ,pa- 
l ish church, and in the observance of the Christian Sabbath. 

Poaching in the salmon fisheries formerly prevailed ; but this 
has been completely checked. 

IV. — Industry. 

The parish may be said to be completely agricultural. There 
are scarcely any families who are not in some measure connected 
with the operations of husbandry. 

The number of imperial acres, cultivated or occasionally in tillage, 

may be stated at, . . • 3500 

Number of acres which never have been cultivated, . 7000 

which might be improved so as to undergo a regu- 
lar rotation of cropping, . 800

12800 

Rent of Land. — The average rental of land may be stated at 
abo\it L.l, 3s. per acre. 

Rental — The real rental of the parish is about L.4123. 

Live-Stock. — The number of sheep kept is from 1200 to 1500. 
They are principally of the black-faced breed, but crosses have 
been lately introduced. 

The Angus-shire black cattle are the most common. In gene- 
ral, the stock purchased for grazing and feeding cannot be sur- 
passed in any other district of the country. They are generally 
sold to dealers for the London, Edinburgh, and Glasgow markets. 
The general rotation of cropping is what is termed the sixth, that 
is, three years in grass, two grain crops, and one green crop, or 
clean fallow. A very considerable improvement has taken place 
of late years in respect to husbandry. Much waste land has been 
reclaimed, and furrow-draining has been very successfully intro- 
duced. The general duration of leases is nineteen years. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town, 8fc. — Kirriemuir, distant four miles, is the near- 
est market-town, at which, at convenient seasons, markets for 
sheep, horses, and cattle are held. The only village, properly so 
called, is in the neighbourhood of the church. The parish is 
conveniently intersected by roads, but they are kept in a bad state 



618 FORFARSHIRE. 

of repair. This arises partly from the insufficiency of the voad- 
money, though principally from a most imperfect mode of manage- 
ment. It is to be hoped that measures will soon be adopted to 
remedy an evil universally complained of. The bridges are not 
so numerous as they require to be, and several are very insecure. 
The fences are partly of thorn, and partly of dry stone. They 
are imperfectly kept, and deficient in number. 

Ecclesiastical State.— ThQ parish church is centrically situated, 
and as convenient as could be for the greater part of the popula- 
tion. Its distance from the farthest extremity of the parish is five 
miles. The date of its erection is 1840. It is built almost on 
the same site as the former church was, which must have been 
erected previous to the era of the Reformation, and which had be- 
come ruinous and unsafe. It is a plain building, but neat and 
comfortable. The church-yard walls have been rebuilt, and the 
whole ground suitably laid out. The church affords accommoda- 
tion for 240. There are no free sittings, the whole area being di- 
vided among the heritors and their tenants. The manse was 
built in 1792. An addition was lately made to it, and it under- 
went a very thorough repair. It is now in every respect commo- 
dious and comfortable. The glebe is about 4 acres. From the 
excellency of the soil, it is of considerable value. A grass glebe of 
12 L imperial acres was lately designed to the minister, from 
church lands in the neighbourhood of the manse. The decreet of 
the Presbytery, however, has been opposed by the heritors, and the 
matter is at present in dependence before the Court of Session. 
The amount of the stipend is L.157 of money, and 6 bolls, 3 
pecks. Of lippy of bear. L.l, 8s. Id. was formerly paid in name 
of grass money. The church was originally a parsonage be- 
longing to the abbey of Arbroath. After the erection of the ab- 
be5°into a temporal lordship, the burden of the stipend devolved 
upon the titular of the tithes,-the consequence of which was that, 
bv the decreet of provisions dated in the year 1635, a considera- 
ble part of the stipend was allocated upon abbey lands, in the 
neihbourhood of Arbroath, from which it continues to be payable. 
Au'the inhabitants, with the exception of the families oUhe ts'o 
resident heritors, who are Episcopalians, belong to the Estabhsli- 
ed church. The average number of commumcants is about .W. 

Educaton.-T\e•e is no other save the parochial school in t le 
parish. The branches of education are those which are usually 
aught.  The salary of the schoolmaster is L.23 in money and 



KINGOI-DRUM. 



619 



6| bolls of oats, payable in kind, the collection of which is felt to 
be a grievance by the teacher. This method of payment being, 
in the opinion of eminent counsel, contrary to the statute, ought 
to be abolished, and the value, as ascertained by the Exchequer, 
added to the money salary. The schoolmaster has lately been 
provided with a comfortable house. He is not in possession of 
the legal quantity of garden-ground. Generally the people are 
alive to the benefits of education ; though the real end and de- 
sign thereof is often defeated by mistaken views of the method 
of its attainment. The district of Pearsie, where at present the 
greatest number of children are, is too distant from the parish 
school. It is desirable that a teacher were permanently settled 
there. 

Library. — There is a circulating library in the parish com- 
posed of religious books. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of paupers 
receiving parochial aid may be stated at from 3 to 4. In times 
of distress, a few are temporarily relieved ; by which means they 
are prevented from falling as a regular and permanent burden on 
the parish funds. From Is. to 6s. is given weekly to those re- 
ceiving aid as regular pensioners. The average of the last seven 
years' collections made in the church for behoof of the poor is 
L.12, 13s.; interest arising from capital annually, L.IO; mort- 
cloth dues, 15s. Sd. ; total, L.23, 8s. 8|d. Although the pa- 
rish has never enjoyed any other method of obtaining funds for 
support of the poor, save by collections in the church ; yet it has 
been enabled to provide for their wants by this method alone. 
Besides accomplishing that object, a small capital has been accu- 
mulated. The disposition of independence, so long and so warmly 
cherished by the Scottish peasantry, is on the decline. 

The parish being divided into large farms, the practice of 
keeping bothies is almost universal. This may be advantageous 
to the farmer, but is certainly most adverse to the morals of the 
labouring population. 

Fuel. — Peat and wood constitute the principal fuel. Scotch 
and English coals are, however, becoming every year more com- 
mon. The latter are obtained from the Newtyle, Glammis, and 
Forfar railway depots. 

Miscellaneous Obsebvations. 
In the last Statistical Account, the number of arable acres is 
stated to have been between 3000 and 4000. The number of acres 



620 FORFAllSliHlR. 

in that state at present we have stated at 3500. As a great quantity 
of land, however, has been improved and brought into a state of cul- 
tivation within the last forty years, niuch of the inferior land, for- 
merly arable, is at present allowed to lie as permanent pasture. 
Owing to the high prices realized from cattle, this is not thought 
disadvantageous to the farmer ; but undoubtedly a very great 
deal of land in all parts of the parish could profitably be culti- 
vated, provided the necessary expenses of improvement were in 
part defrayed by the proprietor. • , , , 

The real rental, at the date of the last Account, is stated 
to be L.1600; the present rental is about L.412.3. Thus, while 
the number of arable acres has ostensibly remained nearly the 
same, the rent of land has increased nearly 300 per cent. Though 
this i's partly owing to the profits of the grazier, it is chiefly to be 
accounted for by the introduction of a superior mode of husbandry, 
and by increased industry and enterprise on the part of the te- 

nantry. „ , 

For the last six years, owing to the unfavourable nature ot the 
seasons, the farmer has sustained a very considerable loss by his 
grain crops. The high price of cattle has alone enabled him to 
retain his independence and hold his lease. Should this source 
of profit fall much in value, proprietors will certainly not realize 
their present rents. The climate of the parish might be much 
improved, and the value of many fields greatly increased by the 
shelter afforded by planting. The conveyance of farm produce 
micrht be greatly facilitated, and an advantage might be got ol ta- 
vourable markets by a better mode of managing the roads, which, 
in winter especially, are almost impassable.  , ,• 

The number of cottages should be much increased, and a tew 
acres of inferior land annexed to them. Examples might be pro- 
duced to show that, by an outlay of about L.30 on the buildingof 
the necessary houses, a rent of about L.6 might be obtained from 
six acres of land, the value of which at present is very small.

PRESBYTERY OF BRECHIN, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. ROBERT INGLIS, MINISTER. 



I — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The name is written Edzell or Edzel, and in the old 
records, often Edziel. It is pronounced Aigle or Eagle. It is 
supposed to be a Gaelic word signifying .Me cleft, or dividing of 
the loaters. 

The main body of the parish is a peninsula, betwixt the two 
branches of the North Esk, here named the North and West 
Waters, which unite at the bottom of the parish. 

Edzell forms the north-east point of Forfarshire, the lower part 
bounded by Fettercairn and Strackathrow ; the middle by Lethnot 
on the west ; and the part in Kincardineshire bounded by 
Fettercairn on the east; the upper or water side by Lochlee, on 
the west ; and the north, by Strachan and Birse in Kincar- 
dineshire. 

The peninsula is about three miles long, by two wide. Above 
that, the parish swells into about four miles in width. Beyond, 
the parish stretches up the north water, on both sides, six or 
seven miles. The form is very irregular. 

II. — Civil History. 

Lindsay or Lindesay of Edzell was proprietor of six-sevenths of 
the parish. The family were powerful, and appear to have.acfed 
under their kmsmen, the Earls of Crawfurd. To Lindsay be 
longed Edzell, Lethnot, and Lochlee, with domains towards Fin- 
haven, upon the one hand, and Brechin upon the other; which 
seem to have been parted with, before the final breaking up of the 
family. As a proof of pristine superiority, the lands of Edzell are 
at this day exempted from paying custom at the great Trinity June 
iair of Brechin.

the builtliug. Tradition reports, that this lower was built and in- 
habited by a family oF the name of Stirling, from whom it descend- 
ed by marriage to the Lindsays of Glenesk. The round tower 
on the north, and the other parts of the castle, appear to have been 
built at different periods after it came into the Lindsay family." 

Edzell was one of the mansions or castles which Oliver Crom- 
well, in 1651, occupied with a garrison. It ceased to be a resi- 
dence in 1714 or 1715, when its owner left it. It was partially 
occupied in March or April 1746, by Colonel John Campbell, 
then a very young man afterwards the late venerable John Duke 
of Argyle, whose duty it was to skirt along the braes with the 
Argyle Highlanders, while Duke William marched north through 
the heart of the country. 

At Colmellie, on the base of Mount Battock, are two so-called 
Druidical circles, one with a portico or entrance, enclosing an 
area of 45 feet by 36, the other less. At Dalbog there was 
another circle, of which only one stone is now standing. 

III. — Population. 

The population in 1791 was 963 

1801, , 1012 

1811, . 1057 

1821, 1043 

1831, . 974 

1841, . 1076 

Towards the end of the seventeenth century, the population 
would seem to have been much as now. In 1684, and several 
years after, the baptisms appear to be regularly inserted, and the 
number was much as it is now, — 24 per annum. 

Proprietors. — There are two proprietors, neither of them resi- 
dent: Lord Panmure, who has six-sevenths, and John Gladstone, 
Esq. of Fasque, who has one-seventh, being that part of the pa- 
rish in Kincardineshire, formerly a parish by itself, called New 
Dosk, and to which a burying-ground is still attached. 

IV. — Industry. 

Planting.— \Jnev wood there are about 200 acres imperial. 
About 90 acres, chiefly larch, was planted about forty-two years 
ago, and is now yielding profit. 

About 1060 imperial acres are waste, yielding little pasture. 
Perhaps one-third is improveable. There are about forty- six 
square miles of hill, all within this parish, chiefly brown heath, 
with occasional more kindly patches from water s'prings, or allu- 
vial soil.

There is also a piece of moor given about fifty-two years ago 
to the minister in property, in exchange for a servitude for turf, 
of which the present incumbent has reclaimed about seven acres, 
by ploughing, draining, and inclosing. 

Education — .The parish school at the village of Edzell is well 
attended, and the intellectual system has been pursued in it for the 
last ten years. The schoolmaster has the maximum salary, L.34, 
4s, 4id. and a very commodious school and schoolmaster's house 
were erected in 1841. The fees are moderate, and may amount 
to L.24 : the session clerkship yields him L.4. There has also 
been built in the part of the parish in Kincardineshire, a new 
school and school-house by John Gladstone, Esq. of Fasque, to 
which is attached a small endowment of L. 10, which, together 
with the school-fees, may make an income to the teacher of about 
L.24 per annum. There is also another school at Killock, six 
miles from the parish school, taught upon the teacher's own ad- 
venture, and pretty well attended, especially during winter. 

Religious instruction is well attended to in all the schools, and 
the parish teacher has taught a Sabbath evening school for the 
last two years, which is often thronged, and in which the present 
minister gives his assistance. 

There are three in the year : one in August, lono- 
estabhshed, now on the wane ; two established some years since 
by Lord Panmure, for sheep and cattle, the one on first Monday

Extent. — This parish occupies a large portion ; not less, per- 
haps, than eighteen square miles of a hilly district lying towards 
the south of Strathmore. Some of the higher portions being ra- 
ther bleak, are covered with broom and heath ; but the lower parts 
are generally fertile. One of these, extending several miles along 
the south bank of the Esk, is subject io occasional inundations 
from the overflowing of the river. The hills are not of great 
height, Turin hill, the highest of them, is 800 feet above the le- 
vel of the sea, and 600 above the adjacent lakes, so that the ele- 
vation of the lower parts of the parish is not more than 200 feet 
above the level of the sea. The temperature is consequently mo- 
derate, and the climate healthy. There are no diseases peculiar 
to the district. 

Hydrography. — The only lake in the parish is that of Balgavies, 
close to the Auldbar-road station of the Arbroath and Forfar Rail- 
way, which is situated on the southern border of the parish. The 
lake furnishes to the angler a tolerable supply of pike and perch. 
Marl was at one time dredged from the bottom, and used for ma- 
nure; but this is now discontinued. 

Rocks. — The south-west part of the parish abounds with excellent 
freestone, of a greyish colour. Several quarries are at present 
in operation, yielding not only stones fitted for the ordinary pur- 
poses of building, but paving stones also, of superior size and qua- 
lity, and a durable though somewhat heavy gray slate for roofing. 

Woods. — Ip the middle and on the north side of the parish, there 
is a great deficiency of wood. In the south-east, however, on the 
estate of Auldbar, and in the west, on the slope of Turin hill, there 
are considerable plantations of fir; but the most thriving wood, 
apparently, is the hard-wood of various kinds planted around and 
near to the houses of Auldbar, Turin, and Balgavies. 

II. — Cjvii, History. 

Land-owners.-— The landed proprietors of this parish and their 
estates are, the Right Honourable Earl Minto, Melgund ; Pa- 
trick Chalmers, Esq., Auldbar and Pitkennedy ; Lieutenant-Co- 
lonel Dalgairns, Balgavies; Patrick Rickard, Esq., Balglassie ; 
Charles Gray, Esq., of Carse, Carsegownie ; Rev. Dr Buist, 
Tillywhandland and Kirkton ; R. A. Watson Carnegy, Turin ; 
James Webster, Esq., Flemmington ; William Morgan, Esq., 
Balbinnie ; William Smith, Esq., M. D., Damside. 

Rent.~T\\e valued rent is L. 4233, 6s. 8d. Scots. 

Mr Chalmers and Mr Morgan are, at present, the only resident he- 



628 fORFARSIllRE. 

ritors. Nearly one-half of the parish belongs to the Earl Mintcr, in 
consequence of his Lordship's grandfather, Sir Gilbert Elhot havn.g 
niarried Agnes Murray Kynynmound, heiress of Melgund whose 
son,thefather of the present Earl, after having filled the h.gh offices, 
first of Viceroy of Corsica, and next of Governor-General of Ben- 
gal, was, in 1813, created Viscount Melgund and Earl of M.nto. 
The oldest son of Lord Minto is accordingly designated by cour- 
tpsv tlip Viscount Melgund. , , 

T el a local tradition, that the Castle of Melgund «sb„ t 
by the celebrated Cardinal Beaten, and that it was a favour, e 
country residence et that ambitious prelate, to wb.ch he frequently 
resorted for ether purposes, says the same unwritten chronicle less 
creditable to the cardinal's character, and less consistent with his 
vow of celibacy, than a mere love of retirement or of relaxation 
from the fatigues of public business. The remains of this caslle 
are still extensive, and indicate no inconsiderable degree of strength 
and of magnificence. The banqueting-hall has been a spacious 
Lartmentrand, in its dimensions, exceedingly well-proportioned. 
Th preset noble proprietor, with a taste well befitting his nmne 
and rank, has alike forbidden the dilapidation of the castle, and 
he ".ttig down of the fine old trees with which ;t..s -rrounde . 

The Castle of AuWbar, the residence of Patrick Chataer, 
Esq., lately, and until his health obliged him to resign, Memb 
of Parliament for the Forfarshire burghs, is another of those 
ncient strongholds, which, in feudal times - 'ullart 
unhappily so necessary in these parts. The Castle of Auldbar is 
To only habitable, but is also inhabited by its respected owner, 
r „ part modernized, and thus exhibits, at one view, the rernark- 
ah e ontrast of ancient strength and statelmess with modern tas e, 
etement, and comfort. This parish has 
in former times, its full complement of these border f»"«=='' ' » 
Inch they may be called, as standing in the gap between the 
Bra r nand the Lowlanders. The now antiquated but liosp. 
table mansion-house of Balgavies is only the comparatively modern 

mentioned; and now in a gi  „f itc nnoe loou-ho e- 

hold appearance, by the recent enlargement of Us once loo

looking windows. But a more perfect specimen is the Castle of 
Flemmington, about a furlong to the east of the church, being- 
strong, stately, and dungeon-like. It is not many years since it 
was occupied' by the proprietor, and is still inhabited by the farm- 
servants. 

From the ancient character of the names of most places in the 
parish, it is evident that there have been few changes in the 
boundaries of estates ; few breakings up of the larger, or combi- 
nations of the smaller farms, for many ages past. There are few 
mere conventional names of places ; but most of them have allu- 
sion to some historical fact, or are descriptive of the locality, or 
commemorative of the persons to whom they originally belonged. 
Such is the farm of Wander's Hill, properly the Wanderer's Knoll ; 
such is the hamlet of the Crosston, being near to a monumental 
stone, ornamented with the figure of a cross ; and such is a con- 
siderable number of dwelling-houses and farms, the names of 
which begin with Bal, signifying " a town or dwelling-place ge- 
nerally," as Balgavies, Balbinnie, Balglassie, Balnocake, and Bal- 
garrock. While some of these names tell us that they were the 
abodes, in days long gone by, of persons who, like some spoken 
of in the Scriptures, called their houses by their names, thai they 
might perpetuate their memorial in the earth ; others of them, 
as Balgarrock, which is said to signify the house on the moss, 
describe the nature of their locality ; and all of them tell us that 
their designations were not of yesterday. 

Parochial Registers. — The earliest of the existing parochial re- 
gisters bears the date of 1706, and extends to 1716. There is 
then a break in the register, which may have been occasioned by 
the fact, that the Rev. John Ochterlonny proprietor of the neigh- 
bouring estate of Flemmington, was the last Episcopal minis- 
ter of this parish, and so managed as to keep possession of the 
cure long after the date of his formal ejection. About the time 
when the foresaid record closes, Mr Thomas Mitchell was or- 
dained to the work of the ministry in this parish by the presbytery 
of Dundee ; but the register does not appear to have been re-- 
sumed until the year 1722, when one of the first entries is a re- 
solution of the session to demand from Mr Ochterlonny the poor's 
box and the mortcloths, with a list of the persons for whose inters 
ment they had been used during the eight previous years. The 
communion plate became a future subject of demand by the ses- 
sion, Mr Ochterlonny having retained it also, by what he probably 



630 FOUFARSllIUl':. 

considered his right to do so, having himself presented it, as ap- 
pears from the following inscription on the only cup which was 
recovered, and which is still in use This cup is g.fted by Mr 
John Ochterlonny, minister of Aberlemno, for the celebration of 
the Lord's Supper in the said church, 1683." From the above 
it is evident that the Presbyterian ministry was not fully resumed 
in this parish until the year 1722 ; and even then, and for some tune 
thereafter, a considerable number of the parishioners a tended 
Mr Ochterlonny's ministry in his own house, the Cast e of Flem- 
.nington. From about the year 1715, the office of the ministry 
in this parish has been held by the above-named 1 homas M.tchel 
and his descendants, by father, son, and grandson, the last ot 
whom died in May 1841. From 1722 to the present time, there 
is continuous record of the transactions of the session, also ot 
births and marriages, with an imperfect one of deaths. 

Antiquities,-Y\ces of sepulture have been found m several par s 
of the parish. Cairns of stones, and rude stone coffins, evidently 
put together in haste, mark in various places the ancient battle- 
field. It is evident that the neighbourhood of the church has 
either been the scene of a succession of sanguinary confi.cts, or 
else some great and protracted struggle has rolled hither and 
thither, its tide of death, over the adjoining fields. In removing 
the stones from a tumulus some years ago, on the farm ot Uarse- 
gownie, a stone coffin was found in the centre with an urn ; also, 
all around the circumference of the cairn, there was a continua- 
tion of similar coffins, but of ruder construction, pomting out, m 
all probability, the spot where a chief had fallen, and where his 
followers, in defending him, had fallen with him: where, having 
met with a common death, they found also a common grave, yet 
«,arked with a difference similar to that which had distinguished 
them in life. A few hundred yards to the north of the church, 
there is a monumental stone, about 8 feet in height ornaniented 
on one side with a cross, richly carved, and with two female hgures 
in the garb and attitude of mourning. The other side is sculp- 
tured in -relievo, with men, some on horseback, and others on 
foot, intermingled with dogs. Near to this one are two sma er 
stones, which.also have been ornamented, but the hand of time 

has ffreatlv defaced them. • i • ;„

cross in bold relievo, and entirely covered with flowered orna- 
ments. On the reverse, towards the upper part of the stone, is 
another ornament, having no obvious meaning, but apparently in- 
tended for ornament only. Beneath it, there are some figures of 
men on horseback, armed cap-a-pee, with helmets. Two of these 
seem to be flying, but a third appears as if he were stopt in his 
flight by three men on foot, the first of which bears in his hand a 
weapon of a round form, the second has the same sort of weapon 
in his left hand, and in his right a spear which he is pointing at 
the man on horseback. The third figure is nearly obliterated. 
Below these, there are two other equestrian figures, one of which 
holds a baton in his right hand, while the other appears to be 
in the attitude of encountering him. 

It seems not improbable that these " cross stones of Aberlem- 
no" commemorate the defeat of one section of a powerful army, 
which Sueno, a Danish prince, sent into Scotland about the be- 
ginning of the eleventh century, to revenge the destruction of a 
previous army, and the death of his two generals, Eneck and Olave. 
Having landed at the Red-head, and being, near Panbride, de- 
feated by the Scottish army under Malcolm il., part of the fugi- 
tives were overtaken, and with Camus, the leader of the expe- 
dition, destroyed near the village of Carnoustie, where Camiston 
cross still bears the name, and commemorates the defeat of the 
unfortunate chief. Another division betook themselves to their 
ships, and escaped ; but a third division, in endeavouring to reach 
the mountains, with the design of passing into Moray, made good 
their retreat for a while, but were at length overtaken and cut off", 
says Buchanan, near the town of Brechin. From this town the 
cross stones of Aberlemno are distant only six miles; and they 
most probably indicate the scene of the event referred to by the 
historian. 

A stone of a somewhat similar appearance to those already de- 
scribed, and from the style of its sculpture, evidently belonging to 
the same rude era of Scottish art, is at present in the vestibule of 
the House of Auldbar, liaving been brought thither from the 
ruins of a contiguous ancient chapel. It belongs, however, to an- 
entirely different class of subjects, and is thus described by Pinker- 
ton : " It is well known thai there exist in various parts of Scot- 
land, but chiefly on the east side, from the river Tay, singular 
erect stones, generally with crosses on one side, and upon the 
other sculptures, not ill executed for a barbarous age. Tiiree are

found at Aberlemno. That at the chapel of Auldbar is singular, 
as, instead of horsemen and spears, there are two persons sitting, 
probably religious, and beneath them, a man seemingly tearing out 
a lion's tongue— perhaps Samson, and opposite to him a curious 
figure of an antique harp, and under these a man on horseback, a 
lamb, and other animals/' It is most probable that this was either 
an altar piece, or that it was intended in some way to ornament 
the sacred edifice whence it was taken. The subject is evident- 
ly a scriptural one, although, from the introduction of the harp, it 
is most probable that it was David and not Samson, whom the 
sculptor designed to represent as achieving a victory over some 

beast of prey. • c rr. 

In the south-west of the parish, and on the very summit ot lu- 
rin hill, are the remains of an ancient fort, called at the present 
day Camp Castle. The space occupied by it is considerable, and 
has been fortified with a double rampart. The interior enclosure 
is circular, through the very centre of which there passes a mo- 
dern dike, dividing the camp into equal portions, between the pa- 
rishes of Aberlemno and Rescobie. The view from this fort is 
very extensive, and must have been admirably fitted for a watch- 
tower, overlooking the valley of the Lunan water on the one hand, 
and the pass from Forfar to Brechin on the other. It has been 
constructed with dry stones, and bears the character, seemingly 
of a castra Estiva summer camp, of the Romans; while another 
fortification, two miles farther north, just beyond the confines of this 
parish, and overlooking the valley of the Esk, has more of the 
character of a castra stativa or permanent camp, the stones hav- 
incrbeen fused and cemented by the action of fire.

The constant shifting of farm-servants is a gceat bar in the 
way of external improvement, with one class of cottages : and even 
in another class more permanently occupied, the indifferent state 
of many of the houses, both internally and externally, affords but 
little encouragement to the cottager to adorn his dwelling. On 
some of the estates, however, the cottages begin to be better con- 
structed, and might be beautified at small cost and pains, by the 
planting of a few shrubs and flowers, by laying a little pavement 
near the door, and by removing the dung heap a little farther from 
it. In their manners, the people are peaceable, obliging, and con 
tented. 

IV — Industry. 

The Inhabitants of the parish are, for the most part, en- 
gaged in farming occupations. Besides the few who are em- 
ployed in weaving and quarrying, there are just so many car- 
penters, masons, smiths, tailors, and sboemakers as are necessary 
to supply the local demand. There are four meal and barley- 
mills within the bounds of the parish, driven by water. All the 
large farms have thrashing-mills, so that there is very little work 
done with the flail. The farmers, who are, as a body, a most re- 
spectable and intelligent class of men, rear considerable stocks of 
cattle ; and some of them export largely to the London market 
both of cattle and potatoes. Bondage, or the obligation to assist 
in the field-work of the farmer on whose land the cottager has his 
dwelling, still exists here to a certain extent.

and stacking peats; ploughing, harrowing, &amp;c. ; cutting and lead- , 
ing the laird's corn and hay ; giving so many days' work when re- 
quired, and various others. 

A letter of the time 1753 states that the rents had not been 
raised for forty years past, and that they might be doubled without 
distressing the tenants.

hens. Yarn— 60 hasps. 1 swine, 1 wether. 

The multures of two mills are not included in either rental, and 
their value is unknown. The laird upheld nearly all the machi- 
nery of the mills. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
IVlarhet-Towns.—ThQ nearest market-towns are Forfar and 
Brechin, from each of which the manse is distant six miles. 
These are also the nearest post-towns; and the want of one near- 
er, or of a more regular transmission of letters than exists, is felt 
to be a great inconvenience. 

Means of Communication.— k good turnpike-road passes through 
the parish, called the Auldbar road, joining the railway station of 
tint name with Brechin, and which was designed and earned 
throueh, at a very considerable expense, by Patrick Chalmers, 
Esq of Auldbar. About two miles of the turnpike-road from 
Forfar to Montrose pass through the south side of the parish. 
A road, maintained at the parochial expense, from Forfar to Bre- 
chin, passes through the extreme length of the parish, in a north- 
easterly direction. . 

Ecclesiastical State—The situation of the church is not cen- 
tral but could not be improved, without opening up new and ex- 
tensive lines of road, and planting it in a bleak and barren moor. 
The nave of the church stands on the original, and, no doubt, 
Roman Catholic, foundation ; but the walls, from about three feet 
above the ground, and an aisle, in the north centre, were built in 
1799 It is capable of containing about 450 sitters; and is di- 
vided among the heritors for the use of their tenants. It is incon- 
"emently lo'w in the roof, and very uncomfortably seated Ihe

milies and two individuals are Episcopalian. Three families are 
Seceders, and as many attend the Relief. The average number 
of communicants in the Established Church is about 339. 

Education. — There- is only one school in the parish, the paro- 
chial. Another is much needed in the district of Balgavies, and 
means are being used to obtain it. The schoolmaster has the 
maximum salary. 

Library. — There is a parish library, consisting chiefly of histo- 
rical, biographical, and religious works. 

Poor. — The average number of impotent persons receiving pa- 
rochial relief is about 18. They receive, except in a few instances 
where more is given, Is. per week. Orphans, and other deserted 
or neglected children, add greatly to the burdens of the parish ; 
for the discharge of which the session receives the average Sunday 
collection of 10s., the collections of two annual communions, and 
a voluntary assessment from the heritors of L.84. With those who 
have been brought up in the parish, or resided in it any considerable 
length of time, there is in general a praiseworthy reluctance to 
receive parochial charity ; but with some who are in the actual re- 
ceipt of it, and especially with those who have been but a short 
time in the parish, and with all those who care little for religious

the Scottish nation.

1»RESBYTERY OF MEIGLE, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. FRANCIS CANNAN, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

]sfame. — The word Lintrathen is evidently of Gaelic origin. 
It signifies rapid lynn, — a term which is meant to apply to the 
waterfall near the church. 

Extent. — This parish is ten miles in length : its greatest breadth 
five. In shape it resembles a triangle. It adjoins Airlie, on 
the south ; Glenisla, on the west ; Kirriemuir, on the north ; and 
Kingoldrum, on the east. 

Topographical Appearances. — The lower division of the parish 
consists of gentle slopes, the middle of valleys, separated by infe- 
rior ranges of hills, and the upper portion is composed of masses 
of mountains, that form part of the inferior range of the Gram- 
pians. The district in which this parish is situated, is generally 
termed the Braes of Angus, and may be described as that part of 
the county of Angus which lies between the Grampian range, and 
the valley of Strathmore. The climate, upon the whole, may be 
said to be favourable to health. 

Hydrography. — The Loch of Lintrathen, which lies within a 
quarter of a mile of the church, is the only loch in this parish. 
In shape it is nearly circular. Its circumference measures two 
miles and a half. The water is remarkably pure. Some years 
ago, a plan was proposed for carrying it in pipes to Dundee, for 
domestic purposes. Owing to the expense of the undertaking, and 
the present depressed state of trade, it is not probable that the 
matter will proceed farther. The appearance of the loch is highly 
picturesque. The Knock of Formal, which rises at the west end 
to the height of 1300 feet, is covered with wood to the top. The 
ground on north and south sides is elevated several hundred feet 
above the surface of the water, and is also planted. In a calm

summer clay, the view of this lake, sleeping in the bosom of its 
wooded banks, is productive of very agreeable emotions. The 
beauty of the scene is much increased, when there is a play of 
light and shade on its waters. 

The Isia divides the parish on the west side from Glen- 
isla. For two miles, it is hemmed in by rocky banks, rising 
precipitously to the height of more than 100 feet. The beauty 
of this part of the river is increased by two waterfalls. The 
first is the Reeky Lynn. There the water tumbles over a pre- 
cipice of considerable height, and falls with such force upon the 
projecting rocks at the bottom, that the spray is often driven up in 
clouds many feet above the level of the waters. Hence the name. 
Below the fall, the channel of the river is broken by rocks jutting 
out from the bottom that threaten to arrest the progress of the 
waters. A large perpendicular mass of bare roek on the north side 
meets the eye, and contrasts strangely with the woods that clothe 
the opposite bank. The banks preserve the same varied character 
for several hundred yards. The numerous walks that are cut out 
furnish many excellent points of view. 

The Slug of Achrannie is the name of the other fall. There 
the water is not thrown from such a height, but it is compressed 
within narrower bounds at the point of its descent. 

The most singular feature, however, in this scene is the appear- 
ance of the river after its fall. The place where it is received, is 
a cavity walled round with rock, and altogether disproportionate 
to such a body of water. Here the torrent, from the force with 
which it is thrown down, as well as from the difficulty it finds 
of getting otit, writhes and rages as if in a heated cauldron. 
The dark shadows of the surrounding rocks, and the depth of the 
pool impart a black hue to the waters, which tends to increase the 
gloomy nature of the scene. 

The rocks on both sides of the river for half-a-mile are thrown 
into the most picturesque varieties of shape and form. 

The Melgam is the only other stream in the parish. It rises 
amongst the mountains, and flows through the middle of the pa- 
rish. Until it reaches the village, its course is smooth. Its bed 
then becomes rocky, and, although from that point to its junc- 
tion with the Isla, the distance is not more than three miles, yet 
there are six cascades in its course, several of which are well en- 
titled to a place in the album of every admirer of the picturesque 
scenery of Scotland.

Wood— Except on the banks of the rivers, there is no natural 
wood. Within the last thirty years, plantations have been kid 
out to the extent of 1200 acres. These consist principally of 
larch and Scots fir; oak, ash, beech, and plane trees have also 
been planted in considerable numbers. There has hitherto been 
little ornamental planting, and, except on two farms, there are no 
trees along the sides of the fields. 

II —Civil History. 

Parochial Reffisters.— The session records commence in 1604. 
They do not appear at all times to have been kept with much 

accuracy. t-. i p a • v tvt 

Land- owners.— The land-owners are, the Earl of Airhe ; Mr 

Lyell of Kinnordy ; Mr Smyth of Balhary ; and Mr Ogilvy of 
Ruthven. The valued rent, L. 1628, 13s. 4d.. The real rent 
is between L. 3000 and L. 4000, and has hitherto been well 
paid. 

Eminent Men.— The only individual of any note that ever was 
connected with the parish was Sir Allan Durward, who made a 
conspicuous figure in the reign of Alexander III. The greater 
part of the parish appears to have belonged to him. His castle is 
now entirely demolished, but the moat that surrounded it is partly 
visible. Vestiges of the wall which once lined his deer-park may 
also be noticed. 

HI. — Population. 

Amount of population in 1821, . 941 
1831, . 998

The decrease in the population since 1831 is, in a great mea- 
sure, to be ascribed to the discontinuance of improvements in agri- 
culture, and to the ruinous condition of the houses of the pea- 
santry. Emigration has not prevailed to any extent.

There is only one person deaf and dumb in this parish. No 
cases of insanity have occurred for a considerable time. 

In the course of the last seven years, the number of illegitimate 
births in the parish was 7. 

 IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — The soil in this parish is generally of a deep blacV 
loam, and is under an excellent system of culture. The imple- 
ments of husbandry and the work-horses are in general as good as 
those that are met with in any part of the county. Owing to the 
severity of the winter, wheat is raised in small quantities, but oats 
and barley are produced on every farm. Although the average 
produce of an acre of these kinds of grain may not be more than 
sLx bolls, yet the quantity of straw is very large in proportion. 
This circumstance is of very great advantage to the farmer, for it 
enables him to turn his turnips to good account in the fattening of 
cattle. Turnips are sown to a considerable extent on every farm. 
They thrive uncommonly well. From twenty to thirty cattle 
are fed by many farmers in the winter season, and in spring, 
when brought to market, they yield, on an average, L.14 each. 
The cattle that are generally selected for stall feeding are of the 
black Angus polled breed, and, in most cases, they are reared on 
the farm where they are fed. A few beasts ofhe Teeswater 
breed have been tried ; but it is not likely that they will come into, 
general use. 

There are about 3000 acres of land under cultivation. 
Produce.— The following table exhibits the value of the annual 
produce of the parish. 

Oats, 900 acres at L.6 per acre, . L.5400 0 0

Husbandry.— The land is generally worked in six divisions: 
i-irst year, cutting grass,— two following years, pasture,— fourth 
year, oats,— fifth year, turnips or potatoes,— sixth year, oats or 
barley. Draming has been carried on to a considerable extent, 
i he system that is generally adopted is wedge-draining. Most of 
the land is enclosed chiefly with stone fences. Two farms have

Rentof Land— Grnzwg an ox, L.3, 10s.; a cow, L.3; ahorse,

great, that there is at least a third more cultivated land than there 
was then. Draining, the application of lime and bone-dust, have 
also increased the capabilities of the land that was previously til- 
led The produce of the parish may be said to be triple ot 
what it was at the commencement of the century. The rents of 
many of the farms have also increased in the same degree. Ihe 
Earl of Airlie aud the other heritors have given every encourage- 
ment to their tenants to prosecute agricultural improvements. 

The farm-steadings throughout the parish, in general, are mfe- 
rior to none in the county. The dwelling-houses of the farmers 
are plain, but substantial. 

v.— Parochial Economy. 
Village.— The village is situated near the church. There are 
no public buildings in it. The houses are very ruinous ; but it is 

likely they will soon be rebuilt. ■ 

Market-To2on.—K\rnemmr is the market-town for part ot the 
produce Forfar and Dundee are, however, frequently resorted 
to These places are respectively seven, twelve, and twenty-ojie 
miles distant; but the journey to Dundee is facihtated by the 

Newtyle Railway. j • ,i „ 

Means of Communication.Theve are no turnpike roads in the 
parish. The roads are maintained by Statute Labour, and are 
every year receiving a decided improvement. 

Ecclesiastical State.-The parish church is not conveniently sir 
tuated It is eight miles and a-half from the northern extremity ot 
the parish, and only one and-a-half from the soiithern boundary 
It was built in 1802, and may accommodate 450 people, ihe 
manse was erected much about the same time. It has since received 
a large addition. In architectural beauty, it is strikingly deficient. 
There is only one Dissenter in the parish. The attendance t 
church is very good. The number of -""J'f "fj.f  
The stipend consists of L.121, 12s. 8d., and 44 bolls of grain. 

Education.-Theve are three schools in the parish ; one pare- 
chial and two private. The teacher has a salary of L. 29, 
Sd • the legal accommodations and his school fees may anioui. 
to ta ly L.30 per annum. The average number of scholars 
undert charg 'may be 80. The other teachers have no other 
source of income than the fees of the scholars.

Poor and Parochial Funds. — L. 330 from collections at church, 
dues on mortcloths, &amp;c. L.85, 15s. lOid. from heritors, constitute 
the amount of money distributed amongst the poor during the last 
ten years. The number of regular paupers is 14. 

Inns — There are three public-houses in the parish ; and very 
few instances of disorderly conduct have occurred in any of them. 

Fuel. — Peats are the common fuel, but in the course of a few 
years most of the mosses will be exhausted.

PRESBYTERY OF MEIGLE, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. JOHN ROSS MACDUFF, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Extent and Situation. — Part of the parish is situated in Perth- 
shire, but the greater part in the western district of Forfarshire, 
on the south side of the valley of Strathmore, and on the northern 
declivity of the Sidlaw h'lUs. ,The length from east to west is 4 
miles , the breadth from south to north is 3, exclusive of Bandir- 
ran, which is detached. 

There are six small villages in the parish, of which Kettins is 
the largest. It is delightfully 'situated on a little stream, which, 
after passing through Cupar- Angus, falls into the Isla. It is ge- 
nerally admired by strangers as a picture of rural simplicity and 
beauty. The neatly kept cottages and gardens — the village green, 
situated in the centre, watered by the rivulet, and the mag- 
nificent wood in which the whole is embosomed, give it much the 
appearance of the beautiful hamlets in the southern counties of 
England. The mansion-houses of Newhall, Beech wood, and 
Hallyburton are in the immediate vicinity. 

Soil— The soil is various. Part of the low parish, and the 
greater part of the higher grounds have rather a light thin soil, 
and the hills are partly covered with heathy pasture. But nearly 

 From notes furnished by Mr James Gibb, Parochial Schoolmaster of Kettins. 



ti,42 FORFARSHIRE. 



all the hills, together with the least productive portion of the low 
grounds, are planted with wood of various kinds, chiefly larch and 
pine. The late Lord D. G. Hallyburton, by planting and other 
improvements, very much enhanced the value of his estate, and  
beautified not the parish only, but the scenery of the surrounding 
district. In many places, a strong red clay or mortar prevails, and 
in some it is wet and spongy. The greater part of the parish 
however, is tolerably fertile, the soil consisting of a friable black 
mould or silicious loam, generally resting on a subsoil of loose red- 
dish till or earthy gravel. When this till is close and retentive, 
th- land is wet. The underlying rocks are the old red or grey 
sandstone, as is generally the case in Strathmore  except on the 
southern part of the parish, towards the ridge of the Sidlaw hills, 
where the trap rocks shoot up and intermix with the sandstone. 
There are quarries of this sandstone in several places in the pa- 
rish The stone is very durable, and makes excellent bmlding- 
stone, but in some of the Pitcur quarries it is hard and d.fhcult 
to cut No fossils of fishes or other organic remains have been 
observed in any of these quarries, such as have been found at 
Clashbinnie and Den of Balruddrie, on the south of the Sidla. 
The coarse conglomerate or base of the red sandstone-formation 
in Strathmore lies along the southern base of the Granjpians, and 
generally reclines on greywacke, or on the schists and gneiss o 
fhese primary mountains, composing some of the smaller hills next 
the trath. Where this conglomerate is cut by rivers, it generally 
rm g and and picturesque scenery, from the perpendicularity of 
t c il and chasms, as at Craighall, Airlie Castle Cortachy 
Gannochy Bridge, Fordun, and other places. The finer rock of 
S fo mation eftends southwards, and is covered by the coal-fie ds 
of Fife, with their accompanying yellow and white calciferous sa d- 
ione hale, &amp;c. :-the trap-rock of the Sidlaw and Ochil hil , 
and others of less eminence interrupting the strata m various places, 
and ffivinff them different dips.

II. — Civil History. 

The family of Haliburton were very active in bringing abou 
the Reformation of the Church of Scotland, and had an extensive 
property in this county. The castle of Pitcur, a mile south of 
the church, and now in ruins, gave title to the ancient and ho- 
nourable family of Haliburton, the chief of that name. 

The church of Kettins prior to the Reformation belonged to 
the ministry of the Red Friars at Peebles ; and it appears, from 
a charter dated 24th May 1585, confirming one dated 15tb No- 
vember 1558, granted at Holyrood the eighteenth year of the 
reign of James VI., that the kirk lands of Kettins, now called 
Newhall, were disponed by Friar Gilbert Brown, minister of the 
church of the Holy Cross of Peebles, to James Small of Kettins 
and Elizabeth Bair, his wife. The church of Kettins anciently 
had six chapels dependent on it, viz. one at a village called Peatie, 
another at South Corston, a third at Pitcur, a fourth at Muiry- 
faulds, a fifth at Denhead, and a sixth on the south side of the 
village of Kettins. Most of these were within small enclosures 
used as burying places. None of them now remain. 

Antiquities. — Some tumuli were found in this parish about fifty 
years ago. One at Pitcur contained at least 1000 loads of stones. 
In the centre of this cairn, a few flat unwrought stones, and with- 
out date or characters, contained some human bones. A cairn of 
a very small size was found a mile farther south. In the centre 
an urn was found full of bones. At Camp-muir, there are still 
visible the outlines of a camp, supposed to be Roman. At Bal- 
dowrie there is an erect Danish monument, six feet high. It 
contains some figures, but they are almost entirely defaced.— The 
Castle of Dores stood on the summit of the hill, south from Pit- 
cur. Tradition reports it to have been for some time the resi- 
dence of Macbeth. 

A cave or weem, about 50 feet in length, was discovered about 
tliree years ago on the highest part of a field east of Lintrose. 
1 He breadth at the inner end was about seven or eight feet, and 
lie height five feet : it gradually narrowed to three feet at the en- 
trance, which winded half round. The floor was paved, and the

walls built witli large rude stones, the upper courses projecting 
inwards. These caves were used by the ancient mhabitants of 
the country, either as hiding-holes, as Chalmers thinks, or, as 
others suppose, as winter quarters. „ , . . 

Parochial Registers.-Theve are registers of baptisms from 
1650; of marriages, from 1685, wanting from 1726 to 1772; of 
deaths, from 1685, wanting from 1716 to 1750. Kirk-session re- 
cords commence in 1618.

very equitable. After ascertaining how many bolls a Scots acre 
will produce, the proportion to be paid as rent is found by divid- 
ing the produce of an acre by 20. Thus four boll land will pay 
.2 = two-tenths, or .2 = one-fifth of the produce, five boll land, 
.25, or one-quarter of the produce for rent. A table may be 
thus formed for the rents of lands : 

Produce Prop, of pro- Prod. X prop. Rent per ao. Money rent at 

per acre. duce for rent. for rent. in bolls oats. 15s. per boll. 

4 bolls. 5 =.2 4 X .2 = 0.8  15s. = L.O 12 0 

5 do. a = .25 5 X .25 = 1.25® do. = 0 18 9 

6 do. fy= .8 6 X .3 = 1.8  do. = 17 0 

7 do. = .35 7 X .35 = 2.45  do. = 116 9 
,  \ = -4 8 X .4 = 3.2  do- = 2 8 0 

9 do. 5 = .45 9 X .45 = 4.05  do. = 3 0 9 

10 do. = .5 10 X .5 = 5-  do. = 3 15 0 

It is thus seen that the rent increases as the square of the pro- 
duce; so that land that produces twice the number of bolls per 
acre that another does, is worth four timesthe rent: and if eight boll 
land be worth L.2, 8s. per acre, six boll land is worth L.l, 7s., be- 
ing as S' : 6 or as 64 : 36 : : 48s. : 27s. There is as much 
required for seed and labour of bad land as of good, although 
there is less loss from the failure of a crop ; therefore the tenant 
requires a greater proportion of the produce of bad than of good 
land, to repay him for seed and labour, and consequently leaves a 
less proportion for rent; and when land produces only what will 
pay for seed and labour, it is worth nothing as cultivated land, 
and must be either pastured or planted, or allowed to lie waste. . 

Agricultural Improvements — Upwards of 50 acres of good land 
have been trenched, and brought under cultivation on the hills of 
BaJdowrie by the proprietor. The wet lands on the different 
estates have been drained. 

The different kinds of live-stock have lately been much improv- 
ed. The kind of cattle consists mostly of the Angus or polled 
breed, Teeswater or short-horned, with a few of the Ayrshire 
breed and crosses. The sheep grazed on the cultivated lands are 
mostly the Leicesters, or the South Downs, with crosses; but the 
black-faced Highland breed are brought in to assist in eating off 
the turmps m winter. Hugh Watson, Esq. an extensive farmer 
111 this district, has been long famed as a breeder, particularly of 
the Angus breed. There are local Associations in the district for 
encouraging the.se improvements, by giving premiums for the best 
stock. 

An Association was formed for improving agriculture, so far 
back as 1757, consisting of most of the landed proprietors in the 
fi'stnct, and some at a distance.

He continued an Episcopalian till 1716, when the following entry j 
occurs in the kirk-session records : " March II, No sermon, the 
minister being taken a prisoner, by order of George Duncan, 
bis cousin, one of the lieutenants of the shire, and advised by him 
not to preach." James Gray, ordained 1718; John Kerr, 1744.

the poor of the parish of Kettins.—Causeyend purchased in 1730, 
and Butressbank in 1788, by the minister and kirk-session, as 
trustees for the poor. About three-quarters of an acre at Kettins 
were disponed by the Honourable James Hallyburton of Pitcur, to 
the schoolmaster and heritors, in lieu of 500 merks, given by 
George Hallyburton of Banchory, a branch of the Pitcur family, 
for which a feu of 4s. 8d. is paid, and four scholars educated. 

Alexander Geekie, a surgeon in London, instituted a bursary 
in 1713, of L.5 per annum, for educating boys at the school of 
Kettins; and by his latter will, dated 17th May 1724, and proved 
at London 15th July 1727, he bequeathed to his brother, William, 
at Easter Keillor, L.lOO, the interest of which was to be paid for 
this end, or to any other charitable use which he shall judge most 
proper. James Taylor bequeathed to the parish of Kettins, by 
his will, dated 16th August 1788, and proved at London 28th No-

PRESBYTERY OE DUNDEE, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. GEORGE WINEHOUSE, MINISTER. 



I. Topography and Natural History. 

jfame.— Tn name of this parish is supposed to be derived 
either from the Gaelic word Achter, « the high ground on which 
the church, the House of God, stands," or from Achadh Torr, 
pronounced Ach-tor, " the house with the tower in the field," 
which is descriptive of a ruin near the manor-house of Auchter- 

house. 1 a . f 

Boundaries.— parish is bounded on the east by that ot 
Tealing; on the south-east, by Mains and Strathmartine ; on 
the south, by Liff ; on the west and south-west, by Lundie and 
Foulis; on the north-west, by Newtyle ; and on the north and 

north-east, by Glammis. • i • . f 

Figure and Elevation.-The figure of the parish is that of a 
triangle, the base of which forms its south boundary, and rests on 
the narrow valley through which Dighty water runs; and the two 
sides, indented in several places, rise to a bend in a hill-stream, 
on the north side of the south ridge of the Hill of Sidla, by which 
it is separated from Strathmore. Its exposure is to the south, 
and its surface is varied by undulating acclivities, which point east 
and west, and increase in elevation and steepness from south to 
north The acclivities to the south of the church, and that on 
which the church stands, are accessible, and ""der cultivation ; 
but that to the north of the church, which forms the Hill of bidla, 
is precipitous, and available only for pasturage and P";'"f 
The elevation of the summit of the south acclivity is 500 feet, 
that on which the church stands is 800 feet ; and that of the 
White Sheets of Sidla, which is the highest ground in the parish, 
is 1400 feet above the level of high water mark at Dundee. 

Extent and GeoJ.ogJ.■-The superficial extent of this pansh s 
about &amp;h square miles, or 5448 imperial acres. Of that extent. 



AUCHTERHOUSE. 



649 



8567 acres are under cultivation, 1406 under wood, and 475 are 
hill pasture. 

The cultivated land is in general a black mould, mixed in some 
places with sand, over a stratum of till or clay, or a bed of marl, 
and 'incumbent on rock. Under judicious management, it pro- 
duces good crops of turnips and potatoes, and oats and barley ; 
but wheat has been found, for several years, not to afford an ade- 
quate remuneration, and has, on that account, not been exten- 
sively sown. 

The uncultivated ground is, with the exception of a few small 
patches, a thin surface of moorland over a bed of retentive till, 
resting on rock ; but, to the elevation of about 900 feet, some 
kinds of forest trees grow on it very freely, and to a considerable 
size. Scotch fir and spruce thrive well on this soil ; but larch, 
from some cause not yet well ascertained, has, for several years, 
been found subject to disease and decay, within a few years after 
being planted on it. 

Sandstone rock lies at or near the surface of almost the whole 
extent of this parish, and is raised and prepared for several useful 
purposes at a moderate expense. The Hill of Sidla is a mass of 
the oldest series of sandstone, intersected in some places with trap 
dikes, and in others overlaid with trap. In some places, the sand- 
stone is in thick beds, and of gross texture, with a dip to the west 
of about one foot in six, and affords durable materials for building; 
in other places, it is in thin beds, and of fine texture, and is 
formed into pavement and coarse slates. In these thin beds are 
found wedges of calm, and impressions of organic remains of the 
vegetable kingdom. 

Rivulets, — The rivulets in this parish have their sources in the 
lochs of Lundie, on the west, and in the springs near the base'of 
Sidla, on the north. One of these rivulets runs five miles from 
west to east, along the whole line of the south border of the pa- 
rish, and is called, for part of its course, the Burn of Dronly ; 
but, at the village of Dronly, where it receives the Burn of Auch- 
terhouse from the north-west, it assumes the name of Dighty 
Water for the rest of its course eastward through the parishes of 
Mains and Strathmartine, and Monifieth, till it falls into the Tay, 
near the influx of that river into the German Ocean. The Burn 
of Dronly, before its junction with that of Auchterhouse, is the 
moving power of one yan washing-mill ; and the Burn of Auch- 
terhouse, before its junction with that of Dronly, is the moving 



650 



FORFARSHIRE, 



power of two corn-raiDs and one yarn washing-mill. The nume- 
rous springs, which rise in all parts of the parish, afford, in ordi- 
nary seasons, an adequate provision of excellent water for all do- 
mestic and agricultural purposes. f 

Climate.— The climate of this parish is particularly healthy. 
On the low grounds, it has of' late years been greatly improved, 
by extensive and judicious draining, which has purified the air of 
miasma and miUdews ; and, on the high grounds, though sharp, 
it is generally dry and cool, and bracing. The temperature is 
moderate and equable, the thermometer in the house seldom rising 
in summer above 80°, or falling in winter below 45°, The baro- 
meter, at an. elevation of 800 feet, generally ranges from 28i to 
30°. 

11. — Civil History. 
Parochial Registers.— The parish registers are, ist, a very old 
one, recording texts and acts of church discipline, commencing 
with May 1645, and closing with May 1692, much mutilated, 
and almost illegible ; 2d, a cash-book, in good preservation, ex- 
tending from December 1722 to December 1740; 3d, a cash- 
book and records from December 1740 to August 1804; Ath, 
baptismal registers from 1707 to the present time; bth, a cash- 
book, with some minutes of session from 1804 to the present time ; 
6ih, a sessional record from 1818 to the present time. 

Manor-Houses and Antiquities.— The House of Auchterhouse 
is the only manor-house in this parish. It is an old building, the 
property of the Earl of Airlie, and inhabited by Lady Helen 
Wedderburn and familv ; and, with its orchards almost close to it, 
is the best specimen now in this part of the country, of an old ba- 
ronial residence. Near it is a ruin, from which, it is the opinion 
of some people, that the parish takes its name. It is a square 
tower, of great thickness of wall, part of a strong buildmg, whicli, 
when entire, had occupied a much larger space than the present 
house. It is called Wallace Tower, and that name had perhaps 
been given it, on purpose to perpetuate the remembrance of a visit 
paid by the great Scottish patriot to his contemporary and particular 
friend, Sir John Ramsay, the proprietor at that time of the barony 
of Auchterhouse. That Sir William Wallace did visit Sir John 
Ramsay at Auchterhouse, there can be no doubt ; for it is partP- 
cularly recorded, that, on landing at Montrose with bis French 
auxiliaries, for the recovery of his nativexountry from the English,

■Good Sir John Ramsay, and the Ruthven true, 
Barclay and Bisset, with men not a few, 
Do Wallace meet, — all canty, keen, and crouse, 
And with three hundred march to Ochterhouse. 

At no great distance from the House of Auchterhouse, and in 
other parts of the parish, some of those subterraneous abodes, 
called iceems, have been found, one of which contained the stones 
of a hand-mill and some bones, and a brass ring, and another the 
bones of some animal, and a parcel of the ashes of burned wood .; 
and near the bottom of the south declivity of the Hill of Sidla, 
stands a Druidical altar in a very entire state. On a farm in the 
south-east district of the parish, several traces of a battle have 
been recently discovered. In one place, the spade and mattock 
were opposed by a strong plate of vitrified stones. The stones 
were of the same kind with those on the surface of the contiguous 
corn-Geld. The plate was of a circular figure, of four yards dia- 
meter, and on it lay a bed two inches thick, of nearly decomposed 
human bones, covered by a surface of the ashes of burned wood ; 
and, in other places, stone- coffins, containing human bones, have 
been disinterred in the prosecution of agricultural improvements- 
May we suppose that these human bones and ashes of human 
bones are part of the sad remains of the last sanguinary struggle 
betwixt the Scottish and Pictish nations for the ascendency in 
.Scotland, which coaimenced at Restenet, and closed at Pitalpie  

Proprietors and Rent. — No landed proprietor resides in this pa- 
rish. The proprietors are, the Earl of Airlie ; the Earl of Cam-

ries from about 500 to 100 acres ; and the rent from L.l, 5s. to L.2 
per acre for cultivated land ; and all the tenantry are reputed to , 
be in easy circumstances, and some of them to be wealthy. 

III. — Population. 
The population of this parish was, in 1831, 715, and in 1841, 
769, showing an increase of 54 in ten years. Of that population 
200 live in three hamlets, 100 in the Kirktown,60 in Dronly, and 
40 in Bonitown ; and in the parish there are 2 corn-millers, 2 yarn- 
millers, 2 shoemakers, 1 tailor, 2 blacksmiths, 2 carpenters and 
cart and plough-wrights, 6 quarriers, 30 male and female weavers, 
3 keepers of public-houses, one of whom is a toll-keeper ; the rest 
of the population belong to the agricultural class, or are dikers,or 
ditchers, or day-labourers. 

IV. — Industry. 
Value of Produce.— The extent of the cultivated land in this parish 
has already been stated to be 3567 imperial acres. The follow- 
ing is given as an approximation to the value of its produce, when 
the land is cropped, as it now generally is, accordmg to a rotation 
of five years :

Improvements-AW the farms are inclosed and subdivided by 
stoTnees; and the farmers' houses and farm steadu,gs, U 
ery few exceptions, are nearly new, -d s„bs.an.,al, and comm - 
dious. And, in proof of the liberality of the landlords, and of the n 
IZv and enterprise of the tenantry, it may be stated, that o the

years duration. And in prosecuting these improvements on damp 
thin soils, incumbent on a tilly bottom, the till-plough is now 
used, and Smith of Deanston's system of furrow-draining is prac- 
tised, with the best effect. The sickle and scythe are generally 
employed for cutting down the grain crops, but on one farm, Bell's 
reaping-machine has been used for several years. When propel- 
led by two horses, it cuts and lays in lines neatly and regularly at 
the rate of an acre per hour, — but it is not adapted to uneven 
surfaces, nor to crops much laid down. 

Planting. — The Earl of Airlie and the Earl of Camperdown 
have planted on their estates in this parish to a great extent. The 
Earl of Airlie has planted on Sidla hill, nearly 800 acres; and 
the Earl of Camperdown, on the moors of Dronly and Adamstown, 
nearly 300 ; the plants were of larch, spruce, Scotch fir, rowan, 
elm, ash, plane, beech, on the hills and moors ; but of these only 
the spruce and Scotch fiE promise to do well ; in hedge-rows and 
for ornamental plantations, plane, ash, elm, beech, chestnut, and 
lime have been planted and are growing rapidly. 

Mining. — For several years previous to 1839, and after the 
railway to Dundee was opened, mining in three different places 
on the barony of Auchterhouse was actively prosecuted, and yield- 
ed above L.lOO of rent annually to the proprietor, and gave con- 
stant employment to fifty masons and labourers. But for the last 
three years, all operations in these three quarries have been suspend- 
ed, in consequence of the demand for building materials being 
nearly extinguished by the pressure of the times. At present only 
one quarry, on the estate of Scotstown, gives a little employment 
to five or six men, at a rent of from L.30 to L.35. But the ex- 
pense of working can hardly be provided for by the value of its pro- 
duce. Under circumstances, however, that might give encourage- 
ment to building, the prosecution of mining, with the facilities for 
conveyance to Dundee, which the railway affords, would prove a 
source of considerable revenue to the proprietors, and give em- 
ployment to many industrious labourers. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town, §-c.— Dundee is the nearest market-town to this 
parish. Easy access is obtained to it, either by the Dundee and 
• Newtyie turnpike road, or by the Dundee and Newtyle Railway, 
The turnpike road takes a direction for about four miles from the 
south to the north extremities of the parish ; it crosses two streams - 
\ by good bridges, and is always kept in the best state of repair.

FOKFAKSHIRE. 



The railway, after crossing Dighty Water on the south-east, pur- 
sues its course for four miles to the north-west extremity of the 
parish. It has a depot, for the accommodation of the neighbour- 
hood, established near the MiUtown of Auchterhouse, and affords 
conveyance for 2500 tons of goods and 3000 passengers annually 

to and from Dundee. 

Ecclesiastical State.-The church of this parish was erected in 
1775; the architecture is partly new and partly old. On the west 
end of it, is a bell-house in the form of a steeple, and on the east 
end is a cemetery of very old but very entire workmanship, in the 
vault of which lie the remains of some members of the family of 
Buchan, of the family of Strathmore, and of the family of Airlie, 
the proprietors in succession of the barony of Auchterhouse. If 
repaired, and more regularly seated, and better lighted, the church 
would be a very comfortable place of worship, adequate to the ac- 
commodation of the parish. The number of communicants varies 
from 370 to 400, and there are no seats let by the landed proprie- 
tors, and only a few by the kirk-session for very small sums in aid 

of the poor's fund. . 

The stipend of this parish, which was augmented in 1831, is 
111 bolls 3 tirlots, 1 lippie of meal; 104 bolls, 3 firlots, 1 peck, 
" 2 lippies barley, 3 bolls wheat ; and L.45, Os. 4d. of money. The 
manse which was repaired in 1827 and 1828, is a commodious and 
comfortable house ; and the glebe, which, besides a small garden 
' and- the stance of houses, is about seven acres in extent has been 
valued at L.15. The Earl of Airlie is patron of the church, and 
titular of the teinds of the parish. , „  

There is one Roman Catholic family, and one Roman La- 
tholic individual, one Episcopalian family, and two individuals o 
the Independent Congregational persuasion in the parish; but all 
the rest of the people belong to the Established Church, and are 
in general attentive to religious observances, and devout in their 
deportment in the house of prayer. They fear God and honour 
their sovereign, and meddle not with those that are given to change. 

The estate of Balbeuchly is held by the proprietor cum dectmis 
inclusis a trunco nunquam separatis, and has no righ t to church accom- 
modation in this parish. It is said to have been part of the church 
lands belonging to the Bishop of Dunkeld, and to have been alien- 
ated from him and attached about the middle of the eleventh cen- 
ry by a Pope's bull to the parish of Caputh, at ten or twelve 
miles distance. Pastoral services, however, have been, and are per-

formed for the people resident on it by the ministers of Auchter- 
house. 

Education, — The parochial school-house was erected in 1789, 
and has been frequently repaired since that time, and is a well- 
lighted and well-furnished teaching-room. The schoolmaster's sa- 
lary is L.34, 4s. 4d. subject during the present teacher's time to 
a deduction for payment of a precentor ; his dwelling-house is com- 
modious, and his garden not less than the legal extent. Hi fees 
amount to about L.20 per annum. The schoolmaster is session- 
clerk, and receives L.2 of salary and L.2, 6s. 8d. of perquisites for 
the duties of that office. Besides the parochial school, there is 
another in the parish. The school-house of this school is paid for 
by subscription, and the schoolmaster receives the school-fees, 
amounting to L.20, in remuneration of his services. 

Poor.— The capital of the poor's fund amounts to L.440, and 
is formed entirely of savings of collections, and of interest of capi- 
tal, and of small sums obtained for the use of the mortcloth, and 
by the letting of a few seats in the aisle of the church. Bank in- 
terest is obtained for L.300, and 4 per cent, for L.140. The ave- 
rage of weekly collections is 4s. 6d. The highest sum given to a 
pauper is 16s., the lowest 5s. per month ; and there are, at pre- 
sent, eight paupers on the roll, besides a lunatic patient for whom 
6d. per day is paid. For a provision for these, small as that pro- 
vision IS, large draughts, in addition to the weekly collections and 
contmgencies, must be frequently made on the capital of the fund, 
by which, m the course of a few years, it must be exhausted, and 
then there wdl be no alternative for the support of the poor but the 
imposition of an assessment, which never fails of extinguishing be- 
nevolence on the part of the giver, and gratitude on the part of the 
receiver.

Parochial Begisters.-The oldest parochial register of Men- 
Jr commences on the 15th September 1622 The week 
transactions of the kirk-session are regularly det.led m it Fr 
this register it appears that, for some years befoie and atte 
cormencement much disorder and poverty prevailed u. 
the oarish ; but Presbyterian principles began to gam the as 
td'ent 1 salutary diJciphne was introduced, and ChrstU- 
lanthropY kept pace with reformation in morals. On die 6th May 
1638 the following fact is recorded : " This day the Confessioun

sworne vnto, be the haill congregatioune of this paroche of Men-

the poor rose rapidly from 3d. to 3s. and upwards. But the c vii 
lars'which ensued, blasted the growing prosperity, increase 
number of indigent, and dried up their sources of relief. In t e

seiiibling for public worship in the parish'cliurcl, from the begin- 
ning of April to the end of September 1647. 

These calamities, and the troubled state of the country after- 
wards, account for the fact that, at the Restoration, the collec- 
tions for the poor averaged only Is. a week ; at the Revolution 
they had risen to about 2s ; but by the time of the Union, they 
had fellen to lOd. a week. 

Then came the rebellions of 1715 and 1745, followed by their 
disastrous eifeets, so that it was not till after the accession of 
George III. that the collections averaged more than Is. 3d. per 
week. At the close of the American war, the average was 3s. 2d., 
and they continued gradually to improve until 1812, when they 
reached about lis. per week. 

Many instances occur of baptisms being recorded in the old re- 
gister of the transactions of the kirk-session ; but it was not until 
1711, that baptisms were regularly recorded. Part of the baptis- 
mal register from 1733 to 1758 is wanting: it may have either 
been lost or destroyed. With this exception, the record is com- 
plete, and the baptisms seem to have been duly registered until 
about 1627. Since that time, the number of baptisms registered 
has continued to decrease, so that now it is rarely that either the 
birth or baptism of a child is recorded.

Antiquities.— On the top of a hill called Caterthun, there are 
the remains of a remarkable fortress, particularly noticed in the 
old Account. It is supposed to have belonged to the Danes or 
Picts, There is also a cluster of burrows about a mile to the 
north of the church, believed, by the common people, to be the 
graves of Danes or Picts killed in battle. 

Lately, when the old dike of the church-yard was pulled down, 
there were found in it two sculptured stones of rude workmanship ; 
—on the one are carved two equestrian figures armed with spears 
and round shields ; behind, is the figure of a man on foot, holding

THE REV. JAMES LUMSDEN, MINISTER. 



I- — Topography and Natural History. 
Extent and Boimdaries.—T ms parish is computed to extend 
about 3 miles from east to wesU and 4 from north to south. It 
is bounded on the north, by Monikie ; on the south, by Monikie 
and Monifieth; on the west, by Panbride; on the east, by the 
German Occean and the Frith of Tay. « A high verdant bank, 
which seems once to have formed a steep shore of the ocean, 
runs through the whole, from east to west, giving to the 
northern division the appearance of a great regular terrace, 
elevated about fifty feet above the southern part. The soil 
IS various. The lower division is composed of a thirsty down, 
which barely suffices for the grazing of a few flocks of shep and 
of young cattle, interspersed with some acres of arable land, which, 
in showery seasons, yield a moderate crop of grain. The upper 
division IS partly light loam, partly generous gravel, and a few 
fields approach to a deep black soil. The mould, though in no 
respect rich, favoured by enclosure in many parts, and aided in 
general by an enlightened husbandry, produces crops of wheat 
Parley, oats, peas, turnip, flax, clover, potatoes, little inferior in 
quantity and quality to the growth of the same extent of land in dis- 
tricts distinguished bya valuable soil."_01d Statistical Account. 
n. — Civil History. 
Parochial Registers. -The parochial registers consist of the 
minutes of the kirk-session, and the register of births and mar- 
riages. The kirk-session record commences at 22d February 
1704; but, from 1779 to 1824, no minutes appear to have been 
kept. Since 1824, they have been regularly and accurately kept, 
ine register of births and marriages commences in 1704, and, with 
the exception of nine years, vi from 1807 to 1816, it has been 
regularly kept.

L. 43, 6s. 8d. ; Miss Johnstone of Watery Butts, L. 12, 10s. 

dntiquities.-Theve is no mansion-house in the parish of any im- 
nortance. The parish is destitute also of antiquities. It seems, how- 
ever to have been the scene of a Danish battle. The foUowmg state- 
ment in the old Statistical Account describes appearances now no 
longer existing. " On the eastern boundary of the parish many tumuU 
appear. The traces of a camp in their immediate neighbourhood, 
Carnoustie, i. e. ' The Cairn of Heroes,' the name of an adjom- 
incr estate, the vicinity of a brook, which is said to have run three 
da°ys with blood, proclaim these tumuli the graves of those north- 
era marauders who fell in the desperate engagement which, aC 
cording to Buchanan B. vi. Chap. 1., took place near Panbride, 
between the Danish troops commanded by Camus, and the Scotch 

army under Malcolm H." 

III. — Population. 
There are no towns in the parish. In the village of Carnoustie 
there are about 1200 inhabitants ; and in the village of Barne, 
about 150. The entire population, according to last census, is 
2124. 

IV. — Industry. 

It is impossible to state precisely the number of acres that are 
cultivated or occasionally in tillage. They amount probably to 
2250. There are nearly as many which have never been cult - 
vated, on account of the light and sandy nature of the sod O 
these, however, there is a considerable proportion that is uselu 
frpLture. It is difficult to say whether there is any portion o 
this land that could profitably be taken into cultivation. Th 
is no part of the parish in a state of undivided common. A ery 
small proportion-between 30 and 40 acres-is under wood. o 
Te 1 nks, which occupy one half of the parish, extending over i 

holfbreadth, about'J50 acres are cultivated - av. re 
of probably 15s. per acre. The better land, most o  nc' 
onsidrab y elevated above the links, may average L; 2 pe. acr

great extent. The great bulk of the population, male and female, 
are more or less engaged in it, being employed chiefly by the ma- 
nufacturers of Dundee and Arbroath. 

The only fishing carried on is that of salmon. There are five 
stations belonging to three different proprietors. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Ecclesiastical State. — In the Barrie district of the parish, there 
are 172 families belonging to the Established Church, and 23 be- 
longing to Dissenting or Seceding communions. In the quoad 
sacra parish of Carnoustie, there are 236 families belonging tothe 
Established Church ; 83 to Dissenting and Seceding communions ; 
three to the Episcopal Church ; and one to the Papists. 

The stipend is estimated at L. 143, 12s. 4d. There are L. 4, 
3s. 8d. of unexhausted teinds ; the glebe contains about five acres 
worth about L. 1 per acre. No one can tell when the manse was 
built. It was repaired after a litigation with the heritors in 1828. 
In its present condition, it is damp, open, and uncomfortable. 

Education. — Besides the parish school of Barrie, there is a 
sessional school recently erected in Carnoustie, to which the 
Privy-Council Committee on Education granted L. 100. It is 
at present vested in the hands of the kirk- session ; but it is expressly 
provided, that, in the event of the apprehended disruption of the 
present Established Church, the school shall belong to the non- 
intrusion party. Besides this school there is another in Carnoustie, 
of long standing, constituted so that any individual, without respect 
to character, residence, or sex, who pays 4s., has a right to vote in 
all matters connected with its manae'eraent. The workino- of such 
a constitution naturally led to results out of which sprung the above- 
mentioned school, expressly designed for the education of the young 
on Scriptural principles. There are at present two additional ad- 
venture schools in Carnoustie, one of them beinof for ffirls. 

The yearly amount of the parochial schoolmaster's salary is 
L. 32. The number of scholars varies at different seasons of the 
year. During winter it often amounts to 100. 

Savings Bank. — There is a Savings Bank in Carnoustie, in- 
tended for this parish and the parish of Panbride. The following 
abstract shows its present state ; The amount of deposits at pre- 
sent is L.1286, 2s. 5d. which belongs to 74 males, 75 females, 
and 6 societies. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — For six years preceding the pre- 
sent, the average number of persons receiving parochial aid has 
been 25. The average sum allotted to each of these persons pee

month is 5s. The church collections have been gradually dimi- 
nishing for many years. The refusal of the heritors to enlarge the 
church some seven or eight years ago, induced many of the people to 
withhold their weekly contributions, and eventually led in 1 B37-8 to \ 
the erection of the quoad sacra church of Carnoustie by voluntary 
subscription. The opening of this church, situated as it is m the 
most populous part of the parish, necessarily caused a still farther 
diminution, so that, in 1839, the whole amount of church-doot 
collections was only L. 28, 1 Is. Sd. ; in 1840, L. 28, 7s. lOid. ; 
and in 1841, L. 26, 3s. 9d. 

From circumstances unnecessary to be here noticed, the amount 
of the church-door collections now rarely reaches the sum of 3s. 
There has been hitherto no legal assessment. The heritors vo- 
luntarily contributed in 1839, L. 75, 6s.; in 1840, L. 47, 8s.; 
and in 1841, L. 39, 14s. Oftener than once, a contribution has 
been received from the congregation of the quoad sacra church of 
Carnoustie, and in addition to what they have contributed to the 
poor's fund, they have occasionally made special collections, and 
distributed them amongst the poor in their district.

PRESBYTEUY OF BRECHIN, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. WILLIAM GERARD, MINISTER. 



L— Topography and Natural History. • 
Name.— This parish originally consisted of two distinct parishes, 
Strlckathrow and Dunlappie, which were united in 1612. Ac- 
eordino- to a recent writer, Strickathrow or Stracathro, {Strath- 
cath-ra, signifies either « the Battle in the Strath," or " the 
Valley of the Forts ;" and is supposed to have been so called from 
a battle which was fought in its neighbourhood, not far from the 
celebrated hills Cater-thun, in 1130, between King David and 
Angus Earl of Moray, grandson of Lulach, the son of Gruocb, 
grand-daughter of Kenneth IV. The name, which is evidently a 
Celtic compound, signifies, according to others, the " strath of 
valley where the King fought." 

• Knox's Topography of the Basin of the Tay, p. 95. 



STRICKATIIIIOW. 



003 



Dunlappie from Dujiy a hill ; and Lappie, water, is very ap- 
propriately named, — the upper part of the district being occupied 
by the Hill of Lundie and the Dye, or West water, flowing along 
its base on two sides and part of a third ; while the lower grounds 
are intersected by numerous streamlets. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The extreme length of the united pa- 
rish from south-east to north-west, is about 6| miles ; the breadth 
is very unequal, but averages about 1 mile ; presenting a super- 
ficies of 3440 imperial acres, or 8 square miles. It is bounded 
by the parishes of Dun, Brechin, Menmuir, Lethnot, Edzell, Fet- 
tercairn, Marykirk, and Logie-Pert. A small portion of the 
parish and county, comprising 36 acres of arable land, and 36 
acres of beach and gravel, is severed from the rest, apparently 
from a change in the channel of the river North Esk, the old bed of 
which is still distinctly visible. This part of the parish is deserv- 
ing of notice, as it is supposed to be the site of the Roman station 
of Tina ; but the supposition has not been confirmed by the dis- 
covery of any vestiges of a camp or other antiquities. There are, 
indeed, about a mile to the north-west, the remains of an exten- 
sive encampment, but evidently not of Roman construction. It is 
of an oblong form. The ramparts are composed of large stones 
piled upon one another ; and at the end, bordering on the bank 
of the Esk, are the foundations of what appears to have been a 
round tower. It would seem that the Dye or West-water, has for 
a long time past been gradually encroaching upon this parish and 
enlarging that of Edzel. Within the memory of man, the en- 
croachment has been above 70 feet, involving the destruction of a 
village called Portsoy ; and that, at one time, it had joined the 
Esk about a mile above its present embouchure, is evident, both 
from the appearance of the ground, and from the name of the 
farm-house, near which the original channel is still very observa- 
ble ; " Invereskandy," i. e. the junction of the Esk and Dye. 

Topographical Appearances.— The parish is naturally -divided 
into three parts. The south-east is occupied by the hill of Stra- 
cathrow, a table-land, elevated about 400 feet above the level of 
Strathmore, and stretching into the neighbouring parishes of Lo- 
gic, Dun, and Brechin. A great part of it is under wood, which, 
though mdifferently managed, has attained a considerable size; 
but the arable land is mostly poor, and lies on a cold clay subsoil. 

From the brow of the hill, the view is very fine, embracing the 

 Knox's Topography of the Basin of the Tay, p. 95. 



064 forfahshire. 

Strath through thirty miles in length, and from four to teh in 
breadth ; the back ground being formed by the Cater-thuns and 
other ranges of the Grampians ; whilst directly in front of the 
spectator, is the entrance to Glenesk, shut in by Mount Battock, 
which rises upwards of 2000 feet above the level of the sea. This 
division is for the most part in a high state of cultivation ; and is 
finely diversified with wood and water. A nearer inspection, how- 
ever, produces rather a feeling of disappointment; for though a 
considerable portion of the soil is good, it is interspersed with much 
thin poor land ; and the woods, which, at a distance, add so much 
to the beauty of the landscape, are found to consist, for the most 
part of diminutive stunted trees, completely overgrown with lichens, 
and'consequently in a very unthriving condition. The third di- 
vision, comprehending Lundie Hill and its environs, is almost in a 
state of nature, and has very much of a wild Highland aspect. It 
is almost destitute of wood ; although tradition says, it formerly 
supplied oak rafters for the old cathedral of Brechm ; and there 
are 800 acres on the hill well adapted for planting. The bed of 
the Cruik is the most depressed part of the parish. From thence 
the ground has a gradual ascent, with few undulations, until it 
blends with Stracathro hill on the south-east, and Ln.e hill 
on the north-west. Along the banks of the North-Esk and Cruik 
the natural scenery is very fine; and in some places, where the 
.effect is heightened by judicious planting, it may be pronounced 

quite romantic. 

The climate is, on the whole, salubrious. , . , 

Hydrography.-l\ parish is abundantly supplied with water 
from springs nvulets, and rivers. The North Esk is the princi- 
pal stream ; it traverses the parish for somewhat more than a mile 
The salmon-fishing upon it used to let for L. 25 a-year ; but sin e 
the introduction of stake-nets, the expense of fe-- 
.eeds the profit. The next river of importance is the West-water 
which separates Strickathrow from Lethnot and Edzell A third 
Ttream is the Cruik, an inconsiderable rill in summer, but, owing 
to thTgreat declivity of its channel, a formidable torrent in ramy 

'mneralogy and GeoJoyy.-T.e hill of Stracathro seems to be 
composed principally of limestone, underlying a stratum of very 

'irntr-s at onetime yieldedaprofitofL.500a-year,

and might still be wrought to advantage, were proper means used 
for draining off the water. 

The kind of stone which prevails through the rest of the parish 
is a red sandstone, which stands the action of the weather very ill, 
unless taken from a considerable depth below the bed of the rivers. 
Tile angle of inclination of the strata is very irregular. In general 
it dips towards the north ; the declivity varying from 1 foot in 6 
to 1 foot in 9. 

Botany, §t. — This parish affords small scope for the pur- 
suits of the botanist, zoologist, and mineralogist. Among the 
trees that thrive best the principal is the beech, — which is also 
much used for ornamental fences. In some places the ash, 
American spruce, and lime have attained a noble size. The 
Cruik abounds in trout, — one species of which appears to be pe- 
culiar to it. In size and appearance they very much resemble the 
fry of the salmon ; but in flavour they are far superior. 

II. — Civil History. 

This parish seems to have given birth to no character of distin- 
guished genius or eminence, except the late celebrated Sir George 
Rose, whose father, an Episcopal clergyman, long resided at 
Woodside of Dunlappie. 

Jntiquities. — On the farm of Ballownie, about J 100 yards west 
from the church, were lately discovered in a mound, which 
named the Lousy-hillock, some relics of antiquity, which seem- 
ed to indicate that it had been used as a place of sacrifice 
by the Druids. The mound is about 40 yards in diameter, 
and rises about 9 feet above the level of the adjacent field. Some 
years ago, on removing the turf, it was found to be fenced with a 
dike or rampart of loose stones, which, no doubt, had been con- 
tinued around the whole circle ; but on the south and east sides 
these have entirely disappeared ; having, in all probability, been 
taken away for useful purposes. On removing the rampart, the in- 
terior of the mound was found to consist of good black mould, in- 
terspersed with masses of a very dark unctuous-looking substance. 
On penetrating a few yards farther, the workmen encountered a 
large block of whinstone, 4 feet long, 2 feet broad, and 18 inches 
thick. Underneath this was a flat slab, and below it, a grave or 
box, 24 inches long, 13 inches wide, and 18 inches deep. It was 
formed of square stones placed on edge, was filled with about half 
a bushel of bones in a very broken and decomposed state ; and

amona: these were found three flint arrow-heads. It has been con- 
jectured, that the strange looking earth surrounding the cavity 
may be earth saturated with the blood of victims. About 300 
yards east of the church, were dug up, a few years ago, a number 
of stone coffins, none of them exceeding 4 feet long. A little to 
the south of the mound just-mentioned, is an artificial hillock, cor- 
responding to one about a mile distant on the hill of Stracathro. 
They have been called cairns ; but, from their commanding situ- 
ation, embracing a great range of country in all directions, it is 
more likely they were used as signal stations. 

Parochial Registers. — The records of the kirk-session commence 
in the year 1709, and appear to have been kept with tolerable re- 
gularity, with the exception of one hiatus, which occurs between 
1713 and 1716. This was occasioned by the disorders consequent 
upon the rebellion ; at which period, as appears from the records, 
the manse was rifled, and the minister expelled. The register of 
baptisms commences in 1709, and of marriages in 1764. The en- 
tries appear not to be very regular. Tradition says, that the crown 
was surrendered by Baliol in the church-yard of Strickathrow ; but 
the neighbouring parishes of Montrose and Fettercairn claim the 
same distinction. It seems not improbable, that the surrender ori- 
ginally took place in this part of the country, and that it was after- 
wards formally confirmed at Berwick. 

Mansion-Houses. — The principal mansions are: Stracathro 
House, the seat of Alexander Cruikshank, Esq., of Stracathro, 
—a splendid building of the Grecian order ; Auchenreoch, the re- 
sidence of Archibald Gibson, Esq.,— a very commodious family 
house; Newtonmill, an old-fashioned, but comfortable "mansion, 
belonging to the heirs of the late Sir George Ogilvy, of Barras, 
which title is now extinct.

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture.-The total number of acres in the parish is 5440, 
which may be thus divided: arable, 3103 acres; pasture, 1539 
acres; wood, 491 ; roads, houses, water, gravel, &amp;c. 307. There 
are only a few acres of waste land remaining, to the reclaiming of 
which capital could be profitably applied ; while much has been 
brought into cultivation that scarcely repays the expense of tillage. 
There are many farms, however, where tile-draining would be of 
the greatest advantage. In a few instances, it has been adopted ; 
but want of capital, and the low price of grain and cattle for some 
years past, must prevent its being carried so far as would be de- 
sirable. The proprietors would require to take the matter into 
their own hands. The number of farms at present is fifteen, vary- 
ing in extent from 60 to 400 acres ; also five or six crofts, none 
of them exceeding 8 acres. The average rent of land is about 
L.l, which, in the present times, is much too high. Average rent 
of grazing for an ox, about L.2, lOs. ; the keep of a milch cow 
throughout the year, about L.6. 

The system of husbandry pursued is, in general, rather superior 
The plan of cropping varies from a four to a seven-course shift, 
according to the terms of the lease and the quality of the soil. 
The five-shift seems to be the favourite, viz. one grain crop, tur- 
nips and potatoes, barley or oats, hay or pasture, and one year 
pasture. Bone-dust has of late been much used here for raising 
turnips ; and Guano and other newly -introduced manures are com- 
ing into vogue. Liming seems to have been first had recourse to 
soon after the last Statistical Account was published, when it was 
carried to by far too great an extent.

Villages.— There is no place in ihe parish that deserves the 
name of a village, except Inchbare, which consists of about a 
dozen of scattered houses ; and where there are a smith, carpenter, 
a tailor, two shoemakers, a grocer's shop, and two public-houses, 
vhich are happily little frequented except by passing travellers 

Means of Communication.-Boih the old and new turnpike roads 
between Aberdeen and Perth traverse the parish for about two 
miles. Along the latter, the Defiance coach passes and repasses 
every lawful day. There is also a carrier to Brechm twice, and to 
Montrose once a-week. The commutation roads are amply sul- 
ficient for the accommodation of the population, intersecting tlie 
parish in all directions. Some years ago, they were in a most mi- 
Lrable state. Latterly, they have been brought into excellent 
order, having been placed under the management of five of the 

nrincipal rate-payers. , a r 

Ecclesiastical Stafe.-There are two glebes altached to the hv- 
\m; that of Dunlappie, which contains nearlj three acres ; and 
of Stracathro, about seven and a half arable acres; and two occu 
pied b, houses, shrubs, and plantat.ons. I he fP 
averages about L.170; the annual value of the glebes, L.12. The 
wSpopulation, with the exception of sixteen persons, are nem- 
bers of the Established Church. Divme service ,s generally well

emoluments of the two sessional teachers are entirely derived from 
private contributions and school-fees. To each of them are allot- 
ted a rent-free house, school-room, and garden, but their means 
of subsistence are miserably inadequate, so that it is very difficult 
to procure or to retain good teachers. 

Library. — There is a parish library, consisting of upwards of 300 
volumesof religious works and tracts, and miscellaneous literature. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of names upon the 
poor's roll is, at present, 20 : but, including children and relations 
entirely dependent upon paupers, they amount to 33, being about 
one-seventeenth of the entire population. The allowance gene- 
rally given varies from 5s. to 15s. per quarter. There is also 
a regular distribution of coals and meal to the most necessitous of 
the population, whether upon the poor's roll or not, twice during 
winter. Tt is, for the most part, with great reluctance that paro- 
chial aid is applied for. The sources from which the funds are 
derived are as follows : Colled ions at church, fines exacted from 
delinquents, and mortcloth dues, about L.24 per annum ; dona- 
tions from the heritors, about L.58 ; interest on stock of L.276, 
and on bank account-current, L.ll. To this has to be added the 
interest of a legacy of L.30 from the late George Cooper, mer- 
chant in Slateford. The interest of this sum, aided by contribu- 
tions from the resident heritors, and other benevolent individuals, 
is appropriated for the purchase of winter-coals and meal, shoes, 
and any other little articles of clothing that may be required. Upon 
the whole, the poor are well provided for, and, in general, very 
contented.

THE REV. DAVID WHITE, MINISTER. 



I. Topography and Natural History. 

Name.— The name of this parish occurs in ancient documents 
in the various forms of ErroUy, Eroly, Iroly, Airlie, the last of 
which has been revived by the present Earl, in preference to the 
modern spelling, Airly. The etymology is uncertain. It has been 
suggested that the name may have been originally An-dly, from 
thrOaelic Aird, which is used to denote the extremity of a ndge, 
particularly where it terminates abruptly, and which is exactly de- 
scriptive of the locality of Airlie Castle. The ancient milntown 
of the barony is called Dillavaird or Dalnavaird, which is inter- 
preted, " a flat piece of ground by the side of a river, at or near 

the Aird." . . j • i 

Boundaries and Extent— The parish of Airlie is situated in the 
western part of the county, and borders upon Perthshire. It is 
bounded on the north by the parishes of Lintrathen and Kingold- 
rum ; on the east, by Kirriemuir and Glammiss ; on the south, by 
Essie and Meigle ; and on the west, by Alyth and Ruthven. Part 
of the line of boundary is formed by the river Isla," and Us tributa- 
ries, the Melgum and Dean. The extreme length of the parish 
from east to west is six miles, and its breadth varies from half a 
mile to four miles, making a surface of 8600 acres, or between 
thirteen and fourteen square miles. , 

General Description.— The southern part of the parish lies in 
the bottom or « howe" of Strathmore, from which it gradually rises 
in a series of undulating parallel ridges, forming a portion of the 
braes of Angus. These ridges, descending from higher shoulders 
gn the east, sink towards the west into comparatively low grounds ; 
with the exception of the principal one, which stretches along the

north side of the parish, and terminates in a deep rocky gorge, 
through which the Isla pours its waters from the high into the low 
country. At AirHe Castle, this ravine separates into two, which 
respectively form the channels of the Isla and the Melgum, The 
Den of Airlie, which extends for above a mile below the junction 
of these streams, is justly celebrated for its romantic beauty. The 
clear stream of the Isla, hurrying far below over its rocky chan- 
nel, and the lofty and precipitous braes, clothed with every variety 
of natural brushwood, compose one of the finest pieces of river sce- 
nery to be found in this part of the country. The Kirktown is 
pleasantly situated about a mile and a half south-east from the 
castle, and rather less than a mile to the east of the river. The 
elevation of this parish ranges from below 150 to upwards of 500 
feet above the level of the sea. 

Geology. — With the exception of a trap-dike, which crosses the 
channel of the Isla towards the foot of the gorge at Airlie Castle, 
and appears again about half a mile to the north-east on the farm 
of Brae of Airlie, the mineral strata in this parish belong entirely 
to the old red sandstone formation. The strike or run of the basset 
edges of the different beds is from north-east to south-west. The 
synclinal line of Strathmore crosses the parish from its north-east 
point to Dillavaird on the Isla. On the south of the line the strata 
dip gently to the south-west, but on the north of it their inclina- 
tion is towards the south-east. On this side, they curve more ra- 
pidly upwards, and attain within a short distance of the synclinal 
line very high elevations, so as to become nearly vertical along 
the submit of' the Airlie ridge. The sandstone is here of the 
brownish-red colour, and, in the upper beds, is frequently found 
intermixed with small portions of a whitish colour, called calmstone, 
and sometimes interstratified with beds of that species. Many of 
these upper beds are unfit for any useful purpose, being apt to 
crumble by the action of the atmosphere. The lower beds, how- 
ever, are of a more durable texture, and, where they admit of being 
quarried, those of finer grain are applicable to all the different pur- 
poses of architecture, while those of coarser grain are extensively 
used for drystone dikes and ordinary rubble buildings. In several, 
there is a mixture of conglomerate ; and some of the lowest beds 
as in the gorge at Airlie Castle, become an entire mass of conglo- 
merated pebbles, none of them exceeding a few inches in diame- 
ter, and consisting chiefly of rounded portions of quartz, with a 
mixture of other minerals. The cementing substance of these neb-

bles, which also forms the cement of the grains or particles of the 
finer sandstones, is of a ferro-calcareous nature, and occurs in some 
of the beds of the latter in a pure calcareous state, in the form of 
nodules varying from one to four inches in diameter, and occasion- 
ally larger Thus whole portions of the rock become nearly cal- 
careous, good examples of which are exhibited in the section of the 
Meleum The largest mass of this nature, however, occurred on 
the opposite side of the line, on the farm of Reedie. It was for- 
merly wrought for lime, but all the portions available for this pur- 
pose are understood to be now exhausted. Traces of fossd fishes, 
similar to those found in the red sandstone of the Carse of Gow- 
rie at Clashbennie, have been observed at the Grange of Airlie, 
in a quarry of the mottled sandstone ; and it is probable that, by 
more careful investigation, more perfect specimens may be dis- 
covered, both there, and in other quarries of the same description. 

Throughout great part of this parish, the rocks are under cover 
of debris, of various depth and composition. Where the cover is 
thin, it consists almost entirely of abraded portions of the subja-J 
cent rock. In the flat grounds and hollows, where it is deeper, iH 
is composed partly of the same materials, and partly of debris frod 
the higher grounds, consisting of a mixture of sand, gravel, and 
Grampian boulders of various sizes, mingled without regular layers, 
and impermeable to water. This impervious debris, or till, is in 
this part of the country provincially termed mortar, from one kind 
of it having been formerly much used as a cement in budding. 

The rock and till, throughout two-thirds of the parish, are over- 
spread by sands and gravels. These commence at the mouth of 
the gorge below Airlie Castle, and spread out in great breadth to 
the east along the hollow towards the Kirktown, and to the south 
across the western face of the Liodertis ridge, covering almost the 
whole of the flat bottom on the south. At the place where these 
gravels leave the course of the Isla, that river takes a sudden bend 
to the west, and is margined by a similar band of gravels but not 
nearly to the same breadth as those which diverge from the course 
of the river, and keep right forward over the high grounds in front. 
Covers of this nature havo recently excited great interest. 1 Hey 
are held bv some geologists to have originated from the action o 
glaciers ; and, by whatever cause they may have been Produced •t 
must evidently have been one much more powerful than any at pre-

locks, of different shapes, presenting a very irregular undulating 
surface of swells and hollows. Many of the latter are landlocked, 
and are usually filled up to some extent with peat-moss or earthy 
marsh. Several contain depositions of shell-marl, under a surface 
of peat. These deposits were at one time numerous, but several 
of the smaller are now exhausted, having been dug out for manure. 

The largest deposits in this parish were in the mosses of Cook- 
stone and Baikie, particularly in the latter, which is one of the 
most extensive in Strathmore, and the most interesting in a geolo- 
gical point of view. A very luminous and complete account of it 
has been drawn up by C. Lyell, Esq. and published in the Tran- 
sactions of the Geological Society, to which the scientific reader 
IS referred. One of the most remarkable features in this deposit 
IS the occurrence of portions of it, sometimes a foot in thickness, 
m the form of solid compact limestone, the shells contained in 
them remaining unaltered. The same peculiarity is observed at 
Cookstone, but not so perfectly. The deposit of marl at Baikie 
extended at one time to forty acres, with a depth varying from one 
to SIX or seven yards. Antlers of deer, sometimes of a very large 
size, and horns of oxen, have been frequently found in the mots, 
and, a few years ago, a human skeleton was discovered in it. 
Soil—The soil varies in quality according to the nature of the 
• subsoil on which it rests. Where it lies immediately upon the 
rock, It consists in general of fine brownish-red and black loams, 
particularly suitable for the growth of turnips, grass, and barley. 
Un the till bottoms, where some permeable earthy matter is inter- 
posed between the till and the surface soil, as at Brydieston and 
Cardean, there is a considerable extent of loams of fine quality, 
and of a darker colour; but where this is absent, wh.V.h is gene- 
rally the case on the till bottoms in the northern part of the parish 
the soil IS thin and barren, though susceptible of great improve- 
men by furrow-draining and subsoil ploughing/ Part of the 
Strathmore clays at the foot of the parish are also so impermeable 
as to require furrow-draining, but where elevated on the swells 
hey are of a more mellow character, with a fine fertile soil. On 
the gravels, particularly where they are intermixed with sharp 
sand, there are also tracts of good black loam, but in many places 
especial y where the bottom is of a soft dead nature, the soil il 
iare and indifferent ; and although the poorest land in the parish 
I that which lies on the impervious till on the north-east, there is 
also a considerable tract of inferior soil on the sands and gravel

along the southern side. The whole of this, however, from the 
advantages of situation which it enjoys, is now kept regularly un- 
der tillage. When allowed to remain in grass above a few years, 
it becomes completely overspread with broom, which prevails here 
to a great extent, and speedily makes its appearance on neglected 
grounds. 

A margin of deep alluvial loam, extendmg m some places to 
upwards of 300 yards in breadth, stretches, with few interruptions, 
along the whole course of the Dean. It is very productive ; but 
the western parts of it, with the rising ground immediately conti- 
guous, are extremely subject to mildew. The greater part of the 
mosses and marshy grounds have now been brought under cultiva- 
tion, and bear good crops, particularly where shell marl is found. 

Botamj.—The vegetation of the parish is geologically associated 
with the old red sandstone formation, which, as has been already 
mentioned, assumes a conglomerate character in the Den of Air-  
lie, a locality rich in interest, not only to the botanist, but to the  
admirer of romantic scenery, and the lover of old Scottish story. | 
To the botanical student it is classic ground, as a favourite resort 
of the elder Don, and the scene of some of his earliest discoveries. 

There are few places where so great a variety of rare or inte- 
resting plants are to be found within a space so limited in extent, 
and so easy of inspection. The Bihes petrceum or rock-currant, 
a rare plant, originally discovered by G. Don, is to be found a lit- 
tie below the Low Garden. The Orohus niger, ongmally dis- 
covered by Drummond, grows immediately behind the castle. 1 his, 
too, is a rare plant, though it is a mistake to suppose it pecuha 
to Forfarshire, as stated in Watson's Geographical Distribution 
of British Plants, p. 89. We know certainly that it is to be found 
in Perthshire, and we believe likewise in Inverness-shire. Ihe 
curious Paris quadrifolia, rare in Strathmore, may be gathered 
on a projecting ridge of rock by the side of the Isla, a short d.s- 
tance below the Low Garden ; and, in the same vicinity, the Lis- 
tera ovata, and the still more interesting Nidus-avis. 1 he Un- 
.allaria majalis the liUy of the valley, we hope "t-ly jn'ge- 
nous," occurs on the side of the upper walk. The Vcasyhatca

and associated with these along- the margin of the river, the Alche- 
milla alpina and Gallium boreale, foreigners to the soil, and plainly 
migrants from a more elevated region, transported by the torrents 
of winter. The showy Epilobiurn angusti folium grows at the con- 
fluence of the Melgum and Isla. The gray walls of Airlie Castle 
are adorned by the Clieirantlius Cheiri wallflower, which finds a 
secure abode in their crevices, and, in recompense for the shelter 
which they afford it, sheds around them its beauty and its perfume. 

In other parts of the parish there are plants worthy of notice. 
The JEtumex aquaticus, supposed till lately to be rare, may be ga- 
thered in abundance near the manse. The beautiful Orubus syl- 
vaticus grows sparingly on the side of the road leading along the 
Kaims of Airlie ; and the Astragalus glycyphyllns may be disco- 
vered on the banks of the Melgum, The Trientalis EuropP.a, 
CerastiJim arvense abundant in Strathmore, though apparently 
having a very local distribution; Viola palustris and Cardamine 
amara are likewise to be found in the parish ; and the Plantago 
maritima var. /S. afar from the sea, or any elevated ridge of 
mountains, in which situation it seems to have been supposed that 
it exclusively rejoices. The above catalogue must not be regarded 
as complete. One or two plants are mentioned by Don as grow- 
ing near Airlie Castle see his list of Forfarshire plants in Head- 
rick's Agricultural Report of the County, which we have not 
been able to detect, and which, while undiscovered, ought to sti- 
mulate the researches of the botanical student. It is to be hoped, 
however, that, in pursuing his researches on the banks of the Isla, 
he will not imitate the example of some who have preceded him, 
in uprooting the plants, or, at least, that he will spare the rarer 
species, several of which, from this improper practice, are in dan- 
ger of disappearing altogether. 

The natural brushwood in the Den of Airlie consists chiefly of 
oak, with an intermixture of other trees, and is remarkable as con- 
taining, with a similar stool at Ruthven, a few miles down the river, 
■the most easterly remains of natural oak wood on the southern- face 
of the Grampians. 

Zoology.— i:\\e Isla, Melgum, and Dean, are all good sporting 
■streams. Besides being well supplied with trout, the two former 
are also frequented by salmon, which are prevented from ascend- 
ing much beyond the limits of this parish by rapids and waterfalls. 
From some natural cause, salmon do not usually enter the Dean; 

" These remarks on the botany of the parish have been communicated bv the

but, besides the ordinary white trout, it has a variety of a red co- 
lour, similar to that of Lochleven, from which the breed is said 
to have been introduced. The freshwater muscle {Mytilus cyyiuus 
is common in the Dean, and is sometimes also to be met with in 
Baikie moss. It is frequently mistaken for the pearl oyster {Mya 
margaritifera, which is common in the South Esk. The wild goose 
has forsaken its usual winter haunts along the bottom ol the parish 
since the draining of the marshes. The Isla and Dean are occa- 
sionally visited by various rare migratory birds, of which may be 
noticed the golden-eve {Anas dangula, the moriUon the young I 
of the golden-eye, the tufted duck {Anasfaliijula, the Dun-di-l 
ver supposed to be the female or young of the goosander {Mergus 
merganser. The kingfisher {Alcedo ispida has now become more 
Hire than formerly. The wild swan {Anas cygnus, has also been 
occasionally seen in severe winters, and a flock of cranes {Ardea 
grus visited us a few years ago. 

There is a falcons nest on a high crag on the western side of 
the river, a little above the boundary of this parish, but belonging 
by ancient right to the Earl of Airlie. It has been frequented 
ivom time immemorial. The young are still sometimes taken out 
and trained for hawking. Pheasants have been introduced mto 
the parish, and the ordinary kinds of game are plentiful. Uoej 
deer are found in the woodlands. Rabbits, after a long disappear- 
ance, have of late years become a nuisance, owing to the small 
beasts of prey being kept down for the sake of the game. Besides 
the weasel, polecat, &amp;c. the Mustela martes or wood martin, a very 
rare animal in Britain, has been sometimes found. A very fane 
one was shot by the Earl of Airlie in 1814 in the woods adjoining 
the castle. Squirrels have also made their appearance from the 
west within the last twenty years, and are now very common. 

II.— Civil History. 
The onlv historical event of any general interest connected 
with this parish is the destruction of Airlie Castle, celebrated m 
the fine old ballad of the « Bonnie House of Airhe. The bal- 
lad, however, is not to be relied on as containing a strictly faithtu 
narrative of the occurrence. The following particulars are chiefly 
taken from Spalding's « History of the Troubles in England and 
Scotland." The Earl of Airlie at that period was peculiarly ob 
noxious to the ruling party, as one of the d's.nguished aid 
inflexible champions of the roya cause. I" l'  f 
parts of Scotland were put under his command by King Ch rie. 
in the year 1640, in the absence of the Earl, who had fle4

into England to avoid the necessity of subscribing the Covenant, 
the Earl of Argyle, a hereditary enemy of the Ogilvies, obtained 
authority from the Committee of Estates to take and destroy the 
Castle of Airlie, and that of Forter in Glenisla, which was also 
one of the seats of the Airlie femily. He accordingly raised a 
body of 5000 men of his own clan, and proceeded, in the month 
of July, to execute his commission. Lord Ogilvy, who had been 
left in charge of the castle, perceiving resistance to be hopeless, 
abandoned it to the assailants, who plundered it of everything 
that could be carried away, and burned it to the ground. Argyle 
is said to have shown himself so extremely earnest in the work 
of demolition, that, according to James Gordon, parson of Ro- 
thiemay Hist, of Scot. Affairs, " He was seen taking a 
hammer in his hand and knocking down the hewed work of 
the doors and windows till he did sweat for heat at his work." 
There is a tradition among the people of Rattray, that the men 
who burned Airlie Castle halted for the night on the haughs at 
that village ; which agrees with the statement in the ballad, that 
" they came down by the back of Dunkeld." 

The Castle of Forter was demolished in the same manner, ex- 
cept that, if local tradition may be credited, the Campbells kept 
possession of it for several months before they destroyed and aban- 
doned it. The Lady Ogilvy, who was then residing at Forter, 
is said to have been treated with the greatest cruelty by Argyle, 
who not only would not allow her, although far advanced in preg- 
nancy, to remain at Forter till she was brought to bed, but even 
refused to grant permission to her grandmother and his own kins- 
woman, the Lady Drimmie, toreceive her into her house of Kelly. 
Gordon, Vol. iii. p. 165. The House of Craig, in Glenisla, 
although not included in Argyle's commission, was destroyed at 
the same time. This part of the transaction is thus related by 
Gordon : « At such time as Argyle was making havoc of Airlie's 
lands, he was not forgetful to remember old quarrels to Sir John 
Ogilvy of Craig, cousin to Airlie j therefore he directs one Ser- 
geant Campbell to Sir John Ogilvy's house, and gives him war- 
rant to sleight it. The sergeant coming thither, found a sick 
gentlewoman there and some servants, and looking upon the house 
•with a full survey, returned without doing anything, telling Ar- 
gyle what he had seen, and that Sir John Ogilvy's house was no 
strength at all, and therefore he conceived that it fell not within 
■his orders to cast it down. Argyle fell in some chafe with the 



678 l-OUFAUSIllUE. 

sergeant, telling him that it was his part to have obeyed his or- 
det-s, and instantly commanded him back again, and caused him 
deface and s'poil the house." 

It is remarkable that, a very short time before the destruction 
of Airlie Castle, an unsuccessful attempt had been made upon it 
■by the Earl of Montrose, then a champion of the Covenant, of 
vvhom, in the latter part of his career, the Earl of Airlie was the 
most devoted adherent The feud between the famihes of Argyle 
and Airlie had been of long standing. In Pitcairn's Trials, we 
find James Lord Ogilvy complaining, on the 2lst October lo91, 
that a body of Argyle's men had attacked him when residing 
peaceably in Glenisla, killed several of his people, ravaged the 
country, and compelled himself and his lady to flee for their lives. 
The burning of the Bonnie House of Airlie was, in 1645, re- 
venged by the destruction of the Castle of Gloom, near Dollar, 
one'of the residences of the Earl of Argyle, which still remains 

in ruins. • , , • • u 

The noble family of Ogilvy became connected with this iarish 
in the year 1458, when Sir John Ogilvy of Lintrathen received 
a grant of the castle and barony from James II. The chivalrous 
lovalty by which the Airlie family has always been distinguished 
and the prominent and gallant part taken by its successive repre- 
sentatives in the commotions of the seventeenth and eighteenth 
centuries, are familiar to every reader of Scottish history. A tuU 
account of the genealogy of the family, with notices of its most 
eminent members, has already been given in the account ot the 
■.parish of Cortachv, which renders it unnecessary to enter into the 
subject here. One important particular, however, has been omit- 
ted ; the marriage of Gilchrist, Maormar of Angus, with the 
Princess Matilda, sister of William the Lion. This illustrious 
alliance is very obviously designated in the armorial bearings as- 
signed to his descendants. The arms of the neighbouring family 
of Strathmore are also commemorative of a similar matrimonial 
connection ; their founder, two centuries later, having married a 
sister of Robert IL In both these cases, the object is to exhibit 
an analogy to, and a difference from, the royal insignia. This .s 
attained, in the former, by representing the hon in a different at- 
titude from that in which he appears in the national arms, being, 
in heraldic phrase, "passant, gardant," mstead of a-P- ' 
while the allusion intended is sufficiently intimated by the additn 
of the royal crown placed upon his head. In the latter, the de-

sign of the royal arms is exactly copied, while the colours are dif- 
ferent ; " argent" and " azure" being substituted for " or" and 
" gules." 

Antiquilies. — Near Cardean, there are the remains of a Roman 
camp, which, though partially obliterated by agricultural opera- 
tions, can still be distinctly traced. The natural position is very 
strong. It is protected on the north by the Isla, which comes 
nearly close to it, and on the south by the Dean, which there 
flows through a deep gorge ; and the flat grounds contiguous to 
both seem to have been swamps. Some remains of the great 
Roman road, which ran east from this encampment along the 
hollow of Strathmore, are also still visible. There are about 300 
yards of it, in good preservation, in the eastern part of this parish, 
commencing in a plantation on the farm of Reidie, and stretching 
along some moor ground on the lands of Auchindory. About a 
mile to the westward, in the old fir-wood of Landerick, on the 
Glammiss property, there is a small earthen tumulus, surrounded 
by a circular fosse. It appears to have been used as a station of 
observation, as tumuli of the same kind are to be met with in 
other parts of the county, near the remains of Roman military 
works. 

Two caverns, formed within dry knolls, which probably served 
as retreats to the ancient inhabitants in time of danger, have been 
discovered in this parish ; one about half-way between the castle 
and the Kirktown, and the other about a mile to the south. They 
are separated by a deep hollow, but are within view of each other. 
They seem to have been from four to six feet in width, from twenty 
to thirty in length, and about six feet in height, and were constructed 
with dry stone walls on the sides, and roofed over with very large 
long stones, with a covering of earth. The entrances had been 
concealed by thickets of broom. The stone covers, which are of 
•red sandstone, have been obtained near the spot, but evidently 
quarried with considerable care and labour. In several places, on 
the dry knolls, stone coffins have been found, some of them con- 
taming urns of coarse earthenware. In diff-erent parts of the pa- 
rish there are remains of Druidical circles, some of which are to- 
lerably perfect. 

The old Castle of Airlie occupied a commanding position on 
the rocky promontory, formed by the confluence of the Melgum 
with the Isla. From the natural advantages of the situation,°and 
the massive strength of the building, it must have been almost, 



j80 FORFARSHIRE. 



if not entirely, impregnable be'fore the introduction of artillery. 
In its original state, it exhibited the form of an oblong quadrangle, 
occupying the whole summit of the promontory, with the excep- 
tion of a small space at the extremity, which is traditionally said 
to have been used for exercising the horses. Some remains of 
the northern part of the castle have been incorporated with the 
present modern building. The high and massive exterior wall 
which protected the castle on the eastern and most accessible 
cide with the portcullis entry, still remains nearly in its original 
state The wall has been sufficiently repaired to remedy and 
prevent the injuries of time, but without impairing its antique 
character. The fosse, also, is still distinct, but has been partially 
filled up, to render the place accessible to carriages. These 
scanty remains are all that is now left to attest the original strength 
of the castle, and carry the imagination back to the days of feud 
and foray, when Airlie Castle reared its head proudly amidst the 
noblest baronial fortresses of the land. 

The ruins of Baikie Castle, situated on a rounded knoll which 
iuts out into the moss, were still visible at the date of the las 
Statistical Account ; but every vestige of them is now gone. 

In the west gable of the parish church, there is a Bgure, whic 
is obviously intended as a representation in basso relievo oi bt 
John the Baptist, to whom the church was originally dedicated. 
This saint seems to have been an object of special veneration to 
the family of Strathmore, in whom the patronage of this parish is 
vested A 6gure of similar design, but of smaller size, was fished 
UP off Inchkeith, formerly the property of that family, and is now 
deposited in the Edinburgh College Museum. A statue very, 
rudely sculptured, and a good deal defaced by exposure to the 
weather, formerly stood in the avenue at Airlie Castle, and is now 
placed in one of the apertures of the old wall. In its present 
state it is difficult to determine whether it was designed as a re- 
presentation of St John, or of one of the savages common as sup- 
porters in Scottish heraldry, as the hirsute appearance which it 
presents is equally consistent with either suppotion ; but as one 
of the arms appears to be supporting somedimg before he breast, 
° h eh may have been a cross, we are perhaps -arranged in con- 
lid rhig it'as a rude image of the Baptist Besides the gure f

the Passion, and which probably served in Roman Catholic times 
as a repository for some of the baptismal apparatus. 

Modern Seats. — The modern house at Airlie Castle, which was 
originally intended merely as an occasional summer resort, has 
been subsequently so much improved, as to render it a commo- 
dious residence. It is now occupied by the Honourable Captain 
W. Ogilvy, who retired here at the termination of the war, and 
has contributed much to the improvement of the district, both by 
what he has himself done, and by the influence of his example. 
J.indertis House was almost entirely rebuilt, in 1813, by the late 
proprietor, Mr Laing Meason, from a design by Elliot of Edin- 
burgh, in the castellated style. It is well wooded, and finely si- 
tuated, commanding an extensive view of the richest part of Strath- 
more. Baikie House is a small plain building, in a low hollow 
situation, and was also erected by the late proprietor. It is now 
the property of Mr Murray of Simprim. 

Proprietors. — The parish is now divided among six proprietors ; 
the Earls of Airlie and Strathmore ; Sir Thomas Monro, Bart 
of Lindertis the son of the late distinguished Major- General Sir 
Thomas Monro ; Patrick Murray, Esq. of Simprim ; P. Wed- 

derburn Ogilvy, Esq. of Ruthven ; Fothringham, Esq. ; and 

G. B. C. Henderson, Esq. The Strathmore family formerly 
possessed a much greater extent of land in the parish. The lands 
of Auchindory, belonging to the Earl of Airlie, were originally 
held in feu from the Abbey of Cupar- Angus, to which the Ogilvy 
family appear to have been benefactors to a considerable extent, 
and of which they held the office of heritable baillie down to the 
year 1748. 

Parochial Registers. —The parochial records consist of registers 
of births and marriages, minutes of session, and accounts of the 
poor's funds. They have been in general regularly kept. The 
earliest entry in the session books is dated May 28, 1682. 

HI. — Population. 

The population of this parish has been nearly stationary since 
the date of the former Statistical Account. It amounted at that 
-period to 865 ; in 1831, to 860 ; and, in 1841, to 868, of whom 
430 were males, and 438 females. The number under twelve 
years of age was 227. There are 179 houses, including 19 bo- 
thies. " 

Of this population, 520 are supported by agriculture, 103 by 
manufactures, and 245 by other occupations. The number of

FORFARSHIRE. 



•men engaged as farm-servants is 85 ; as shepherds, 5 ; and lu 
feeding cattle, &amp;C. 12. There are 75 looms in the parish, and 
the same number of weavers, of whom 21 are at present out ot 

employment. , , , • 

The number of marriages during the last twelve months is 
stated at 7 ; of deaths, 6 ; and of births, 20. Eight illegitimate 
children have been born within the last three years. 

There are 54 cottar families, with houses and yards only; 15 
persons who occupy two or three acres of ground, enabling them 
to keep a cow ; and 19 who keep single cows without land 

Only one of the heritors is occasionally resident. All their 

rentals exceed L.50 a-year. , • . ,r . 

The people are in general moral, industrious, and intelligent; 
and with the exception of those employed in weaving, who, from 
the'lowness of their wages and the scarcity of work, are often re- 
duced to great distress, they are, for the most part, in circum- 
Stances of comfort, and contented. 

IV. — Industry. j 
Anricidture.-The parish contains 6848 imperial acres under 
cultivation, 1365 in wood, and 387 in pasture, waste, roads, &amp;c. 
The valued rent amounts to L.3310. The present real rent, aj 
..•eat part of which depends upon the fiars' prices o S-m, ave 
Les above L.7000, including the value of the grounds around th 
sei of the proprietors. The farms range m size from 600 acres 
of arable land to pendicles of two or three acres -ted by wea- 
vers and tradesmen. The rents vary from 10s. to L.l, 10s pe 
acre, tbe average being reduced by the great quantity of mfenor 
Innd recently brought under tillage. • „ • ' 

The state of agriculture iu this parish has been matenall, m- 
pjel ince the com«encement of the century. At that per.o 
le o the Airlie tenants were among the first u, Strathn,„re to 
Uhe xample of an in,proved .node of husludry ;_and the. str 
ces r stiU maintain a high place among the agriculturists of J»

plain or naked fallow, once so general, is now seldom to be seen,- 
except for some very particular reason ; and the old practice of 
taking two white crops in succession after old grass is almost en- 
tirely disused. Most of the deep and expensive drains and levels 
were made prior to 1820, when the damp and marshy grounds 
■were first brought under cultivation. Furrow draining, both by 
tiles and stones, has since been introduced to complete the process 
of improvement. The arid soils are generally kept in heart by 
means of turnips raised with bone-dust, and eaten off by sheep. -It 
may be mentioned, as an instance of the progress of rural improve-' 
ment, that the young stock of sheep from the Grampians, which 
were formerly brought down to be wintered in this parish on the 
natural grass and broom, are now sent to the higher pastures nearer 
the coast, and, on their return in spring, are frequently put, in 
order to improve their condition, upon turnips grown on the very 
same grounds from which they formerly cropped a scanty herbage. 

Shell-marl is still in use as a manure, but not to the same ex- 
tent as formerly. From twenty-five to thirty bolls is a common 
dressing to an imperial acre. It is much used for making com- 
posts with moss and dung, and is considered as very good for 
grass, but not equal to lime in producing grain, although it yields 
a great quantity of straw. During the war, it usually sold at one • 
shilling per boll of eight cubic feet, the expense of taking it out 
being from twopence to threepence. The price is at present nine- 
pence. It is now usually sold to go farther up the country. Bone- 
dust, rape-cake, and the whole host of modern manures, are more 
or less in use. The first, especially, has been extensively employ- 
ed for more than twenty years. An occasional supply of town- 
manure is obtained from Dundee, to which a decided preference 
is given by the tenantry above every other description of manure. 
The best mode of applying it is found to be by mixing it with the 
dung of the farm-yard. 

The practice of paying the reaper by the threave, instead of by 
days' wages, now generally adopted in this and the adjoining coun- 
ties, originated about forty years ago in this parish, on the farm of 
Linross, then occupied by Mr George Kirkcaldy. While, by this 
mode, the corn is more carefully and economically cut down, it is 
at the same time fairer to the labourer, whose gains are propor- 
tioned to his exertions ; and it is peculiarly advantageous to those' 
who are necessarily engaged at home during part of the day. The 
usual rate of payment has long been threepence per threave for 



6S4 



rORFAIlSHIRE. 



aats and barley, and fourpence for wheat, the wheat-threave con- 
taining four sheaves more. About twenty-eight threaves per im- 
perial acre is a. common quantity. Ten threave per day, and some- 
times more, may be cut, bound, and set up by a good reaper. 

The farm-houses and offices are, in general, substantial and 
commodious, and usually cost, exclusive of carriages, from two to 
three years rent. Almost all the fields are inclosed, either with 
hedges, or with dry-stone dikes. The former, with the interspersed 
woodlands, give to a great part of the parish a warm, clothed ap. 
pearance. 

Live-StocL— It is not above twenty or thirty years since almost 
the only sheep to be seen in the low country pastures during the 
summer months were a few on the lawns round the houses of the 
proprietors, and these were exclusively of the black-faced breed. 
Regular stocks of the Leicester breed are now kept, and through- 
out the district, the thinner soils are usually depastured with sheep. 
At the same period, all the cattle were of the native Angus breed, 
partly horned, but generally polled or « dodded ;" a very fine de 
scription of stock, but less profitable on good soils than the Tees 
water, which is now taking their place on the larger farms. A cros 
between the two is becoming very common in the southern part of 
this parish, where very superior stock of both descriptions is rear- 
ed, capable of competing with any similar stock in the country. 
Formerly, all the fat sheep and cattle, beyond what was required 
for home consumption, or for the supply of the neighbouring towns, 
were sent partly to Edinburgh, but chiefly to Glasgow. Smce the 
introduction of steam-navigation, a considerable proportion of both, 
and particularly of the best cattle of the native breed, is sent to 
London, where they bring the highest prices.  

PlarUations.--The plantations on the Lindertis and Glammiss 
estates were commenced between 1770 and 1780, and consist of 
larch, spruce, and Scotch fir, with an intermixture of hard-wood 
in some places. Many of the larch and spruce trees grew to a 
large size, but most of the fine timber has been cut down for the 
benefit of the hard wood. Considerable additions have been made 
within the last thirty years to the Lindertis plantations, and also 
to those on the lands of Airlie and Cardean. 

It is to be regretted that the larch cannot now be depended 
upon as formerly, from its liability to various destructive diseases 
Z the woods of Lindertis, it was observed at a very early per d 
to be subject, when planted on dry gravelly soils, to a rot m

heart, proceeding from the root upwards ; but this affection was 
merely local. Those plantations, however, which have been made 
within the last forty years, have become more and more liable to 
an external canker or blister, in many cases to such a degree as 
entirely to destroy the trees, and sometimes to occasion serious 
ioss to the proprietor. The larch appears to have been always 
subject to this disease, but not, till lately, to an alarming extent. 
But the woodlands have been visited within the last few years by 
a much more serious and wide-spread calamity: a great proportion 
of the younger, and some of the very oldest trees, having been 
destroyed by blight. The decay commences in the top-shoot, and 
thence extends downwards, sometimes killing the tree within a 
single year, and seldom permitting it to survive the third. The 
disease has become so general, that the planting of larch, unless 
as a mixture, is in the meantime suspended; a consequence deeply 
to be lamented, as no other tree is so well adapted for high eleva- 
tions; and such must now remain in their present nakedness till 
a remedy or a substitute is discovered. As the Scotch fir has 
partially sufTered in the same manner in some localities, hopes are 
entertained that the affection may have arisen from some atmo- 
spheric circumstances of unfrequent occurrence ; but this, of 
course, remains to be decided by future experience. The silver fir 
has also been affected ; but the spruce, during the prevalence of 
the disease among its kindred species, has been fully as vigorous 
as usual. The blight appears to have come from the east, having 
attacked the woodlands in the counties of Aberdeen, Kincardine, 
and Forfar, much about the same time. It has subsequently spread 
over Fife and Perthshire, to their western extremities, and has been 
recently observed in the south-western counties, where, however, 
it is as yet very partial. 

Mills.— There are two flour-mills in the parish ; one at Cook- 
stone on the Dean, and the other at Cardean, by the side of the 
Isla, but deriving its power from the Baikie drain ; at both of 
■which a considerable business is carried on ; and two meal-mills, 
one on the Dean, at Brydeston, and the other on the Isla at Dal- 
lavaird. 

There are no manufacturing establishments, but a considerable 
number of the inhabitants are engaged in weaving coarse linens 
for the Dundee trade. 

Wages — The wages of farm-servants at present may be stated 
at from L. 10 to L.13, according to capability; those of foremen 



686 FORFAUSHIIIE. 

at from L. 14 to L. 16, besides meal and milk. Ordinary labour- 
ers, last summer, received from ls.4d. to Is.tJd.; and, during the 
winter, from Is. 2d. to Is. 4d. ; better labourers, as dikers and 
ditchers, obtaining 2d. more. Weavers, in the present depressed 
state of trade, do not make on the average above 7d. per day. 

The expense of keeping a cow, without land, is stated at L.3 
to L.4 in summer, and L.2, 10s. to L.3 in winter. The food in 
winter is straw and turnips. Those who have no land m general 
buy corn and fodder, and get the farmers to grow turnips for them, 
providing th6 manure. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication.— Sewera\ of the leading thoroughfares 
• of the district run through this parish from east to west, and also 
from the south to the high country, but none of them are turnpike. 
There are in all 16 miles of principal lines, besides 12 miles of 
less resort ; all supported by the statute labour funds. Some of 
the roads were frequently in a very bad state, but they are now 
much improved. The funds amount to L.82, 1 Is. annually. The 
railway from Newtyle to Glammiss, which is a continuation of the 
Dundee and Newtyle line, runs along the confines of the parish 
ou the south. Kirriemuir is the post-town. , , , 

Ecclesiastical State.-The stipend is 74| bolls barley, 149 bolls 
meal, and'L. 33, 3s. 5d. money. The glebe consists of 9 im- 
perial acres, 8 of which are arable. The church was rebuilt in 
1783 and the manse in 1792. Both are still sufficiently commo- 
dious, and in good repair ; and the situation, although not exactly 
in the centre of the parish, is perhaps, in other respects, the most 
eligible that could have been chosen. There is no other place of 
worship. There are only three families of Dissenters all the 
rest of the population being professedly connected with the Esta- 

blished Church. 

Education.-The parish school is attended by about 30 in sum- 
mer, and 36 in winter. The fees are, for reading, 2s. 6d. per quaver ; 
do. and writing, 3s. ; do. and arithmetic, 8s. 6d. ; Latm, 3s. 6d. , 
mathematics and book-keeping, 4s. Theschoolmaster has the maxi- 
mum salary of L. 34, 4s. 4id., with the statutory accommodations

LETHNOT AND NAVAR. t87 

All are taught reading and writing, but some from the short time 
they remain at school imperfectly. 

Poor's Funds. — The average number of paupers for the last 
three years has been 17; in 1842 it amounted to 21. They are 
all permanent. The ordinary weekly allowance is Is. 6d. ; high- 
est, 5s. ; but so much as 7s. has been given when an attendant had 
to be provided. The collections at the church door were, in 1840, 
L.24, 10s. 7d.; in 1841, L.22, 17s..4d.; in 1842, L.SI, Is. 7|d. ; 
the excess of the sum collected in the last, above those of the two 
former years, being attributed to there having been an additional 
sacrament that year, and to part of the Lindertis family residing 
in summer. The other sums appropriated to the support of the 
poor during the current year are, contributions by the heritors in 
proportion to their valued rent to the amount of L.60, and L.2, 5s. 
of hearse and mortcloth money. The expenses of management 
are about L.6 per annum. Although it has been found necessary 
to mtroduce a system of voluntary assessment, pauperism does not 
seem to have made so rapid progress in this as in many other pa- 
rishes. At the date of the old Statistical Account, there had been 
so many as nine regular paupers on the roll at one time, besides a 
considerable number receiving occasional supply. 

iae/._An extensive peat-moss on the north-east march of the 
parish still supplies the neighbourhood with fuel. Elsewhere, the 
peat and broom, which were the only kinds of fuel used by the 
poorer classes in this district down to a comparatively recent pe- 
riod, have been replaced by seaborne coal, and the refuse of the 
woodlands.

As in similar localities the soil in the lower parts of the valley 
is composed of the debris of the neighbouring hills brought down 
by streams, rains, and the action of the atmosphere. It is pretty 
deep in some places, and is partly of a clayey and partly of a sandy 
nature, but the clay seems to prevail. The soil on the higher 
grounds is much thinner, and of a gravelly nature.

PRESBYTERY OF FORFAR, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. W. CLUGSTON, A. M., MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Nome — The name of this parish in the deeds relative to the 
patronage, is Forfar Restennet. In the " Estate and order of ihe 
Presbyteries" in May 1 586, as recorded in the Booke of the Uni- 
versal Kirk, Forfar and Restennet are inserted as separate pa- 
rishes, and it seems, therefore, to have been intended to constitute 
them two distinct parishes, — an intention which was not followed 
out : or Forfar Restennet may be a united parish, though no evi- 
dence as to the period and circumstances of the annexation has 
been discovered. No satisfactory account can be given of the ety- 
mology of the name Forfar; but a conjecture to be afterwards 
mentioned has been hazarded relative to the name Restennet. 

Extent, Boundaries. — The extent of the parish is about 6 miles 
from north to south, and about 5 from east to west. The 
parishes by which that of Forfar is bounded are, Rescobie on the 
east and north ; Dunnichen and Inverarity on the south ; Kinnet- 
tles on the south and west ; Glammiss on the west ; and Kirriemuir 
on the west and north. 

The parish is situated on the south side of the valley of Strath- 
more. A chain of lochs at one period extended through the val- 
ley, and three of them were within the bounds of this parish, viz. 
Forfar, Restennet, and Fithie. One of these lochs, viz. Restennet 
has been drained. By cutting a drain to the west, and conduct- 
ing it to the river Dean, which falls into the river Isla, the loch of 
Forfar has been greatly reduced in its limits. This loch, though it 
IS contiguous to the town of Forfar, and at one period bounded it 
on the west and north, is generally understood to be in the parish 
of Glammiss. The loch, with the land acquired by draining, and 
which has been brought under cultivation, is part of the estate of 
the Earls of Strathmore. 

The parish includes the royal burgh of Forfar, and embraces a 
considerable landward district. The form of the parish and its 



m 



surfaoo ar= extremely irregular. Tl.e ground « "Incl, U.e low . 
staidB and Aat in its immediate vidnil,, very une.en, cons.st-

vulsion in which water had been a prmcipal agent, or ha he

r .Jfland rises The hill of Balmashanar, near the town, and 
roL wer 11 e southern boundary of the parish, are the on- 
tlenres "ill may properly be designated hills. On Bataa- 
sirar Craignathro, the town's property on the east of he D m.

ta-castrensis not foiind any where else in Britain. In the lake of 
Forfar are found the Typha latifolia, Stratiotes aloicles, Lcmna 
trisulca. In loch Fithie is to be found the Tsoetes lucustris, gene- 
rally supposed to be found only in alpine lakes. At the east end 
of the lake of Forfar, in small pools, is to be found Utricularia 
vulgaris and minor, both beautiful plants and of rare occurrence. 
The Chara hispida grows in pools in the moss of Restennet. The 
beautiful plant Dianthus deltoides grows on the north bank of 
the loch of Forfar, as also on dry ground near the west corner of 
the lake." 

In Loch Fithie, no marl has been found. The Loch of Res- 
tennet was drained at considerable expense, principally for the 
purpose of obtaining the marl which it furnished. The Loch of 
Forfar was for a long time dragged for the same purpose ; and, 
from these sources, the proprietors derived a large annual revenue. 
But the use of marl, as a manure, is very much discontinued, 
lime being substituted. The marl found in these lochs is what is 
denominated shell marl, and is formed from the exuviae of several 
kinds of shell-fish, with which these lakes abound. The marl has 
been dug to the depth of fifty feet. The Loch of Forfar is fed by 
powerful springs emptying from its bottom and from its eastern ex- 
tremity; that of Restennet, by powerful springs at its western extre- 
mity. Formerly, the Loch of Restennet was, and now the springs 
conducted by the drain through the moss constitute the head 
source of Lunan Water, which discharges itself into the sea at 
Lunan Bay. 

II. — Civil History. 

The town of Forfar has been from time immemorial the head 
burgh of the county, and it was also the sole seat of the sheriff- 
court until within the last few years, when a. sheriff-substitute 
was appointed for Dundee and its immediate neighbourhood. 

In the earliest notices that exist relative to Forfar, its castle is 
described as a royal residence ; and in the accounts of the Cham- 
berlain of the Royal Household in the reign of Alexander III. 
and of some preceding monarchs, a charge is entered for the King's 
gardeners at Forfar. It is probable that the castle, the occasional 
residence of the monarch, and the residence of the sheriff of the 
county, gave rise to the fame of Forfar, and undoubtedly these 
circumstances secured to it its privileges as a royal burgh. No- 
thing is known of the date of its original charter. 

Antiquities, — In the vicinity of Forfar, there are remains of two 



694 FOUFAUSHIRE. 

Roman camps, the one at Black Dykes, or Battle Dykes in the 
parish of Oathlaw, the other at Haerfaulds, in the Moor of Lover, 
in the parish of Inverarity. Between these two camps, there was 
a causeway, the greatest part of which ran through the par.sh of 
Forfar ; and some indications of this road may yet be traced where 
the land has not been cultivated. Nearly at an equal d.s ance 
between these two camps, the remams of \-"P ;„f 

tinctly visible. This camp is about a mde and a-half east from 
Forfa- Tnd is of very considerable extent. By some it is alleged 
Cis L remlins not of a Roman ut of a P.ct.h ca.p 
A fosse evidentlv extended from the Loch of Forfar to that of 
Res tennet, and t is stated in a paper published by the late Dr 
amieson, author of the Scot. Diet., and who at one tune wasa 
Seceder minister in Forfar, in reference to thvs camp, « tha he 
ditch and the rampart had been cast by the P.cts under Feredith, 
fo guarding their camp against the attack from the Scots under 
A pin, before the battle of Restennet." Occasionally corns, urns 
td p eces of armour have been found in the rums where the camp 
" t mentioned is situated ; but none of them has ever come under 
the notice of the writer of this article  

At Restennet there are the lums oi a jh'j- • • u

Xll surrounded b, water, and must have been approached by

ciation by the Prior of Restennet, Maister George Fletcher, Advocat 
to the King, 29th April 1624, it appears that the Chapel of Dun- 
nynald and the Kirk of Aberlemno, with their fruits, profits, and 
emoluments, were dependencies on Restennet. From the Prior 
of Restennet, the magistrates and town- council of Forfar pur- 
chased the right of patronage to Forfar Restennet in 1652, for 
the sum of 2250 marks Scotts. 

On the north side of the Loch of Forfar, there is a peninsula 
called the Inch. It has obviously been artificially formed, and 
some of the oak piles on which it rests are to be seen. It is said 
that Margaret, Queen of Malcolm Canmore, had a residence upon 
it. The ruins of walls of considerable thickness were recently to 
be traced upon it. In a south-west direction from the Inch, there 
runs in the loch a paved road or causeway, which extends for some 
length, and may be seen from the margin when the water is low. 

The Castle of Forfar stood on a round hill to the north of the 
town, and must have been surrounded with water. The castle 
was destroyed in 1307. In that year King Robert Bruce pro- 
ceeded from Aberdeen to Angus, and here new success awaited 
him in the capture of the Castle of Forfar, at this time strongly 
garrisoned by the English. It was taken by escalade during the 
night by a soldier named Philip the Forester of Platen, who put 
all the English to the sword, and the King, according to his usual 
policy, instantly commanded the fortifications to be destroyed. 

Many of those unhappy individuals who were charged with witch- 
craft were brought to trial in Forfar, by a special commission ap- 
pointed by the Crown in 1661. The record of these trials was 
preserved, and contained many curious statements ; but it has re- 
cently been amissing. The following fact is duly entered in the 
council minutes : that John Ford, a witch-pricker, was sent for to 
prick witches at Forfar, and was admitted as a burgess on the same 
day with Lord Kinghorn. The bridle which was placed in the 
mouths of the witches condemned to be burned, and with whicb 
they were fastened to the stake, is preserved in the burgh. 

It has already been stated, that the date of the original charter 
of the burgh is unknown, but it was a burgh before the reign of 
Robert Bruce, as the authorities of Forfar gave evidence during 
his reign that Dundee was a royal burgh, and had right of guildry 
and trade. The original charter of the burgh was lost in 1657 

 The spire of the priory, and part of the walls of the priory and of the chapel ara 
still standing. 



696 FOUFAUSIIIRE.  

In that year Dundee was taken by the English, and a detachment 
was sent to Forfar, who broke open the prison, pillaged the town, 
and burned all its charters and records. In 1665, a charter of 
7iovodamus was granted by Charles II. And honourable mention 
is made, in enumerating the privileges conferred on the burgh, of 
the conduct of Provost Strang in protesting in Parliament, m 1647, 
against the delivery of the King's person to the English. The 
records of the town-council, which are preserved, begin with the 

year 1660. . . 

Mansion Houses.— The only mansion-house in the parish is 
Lower. It was built by one of the Earls of Northesk ; and the 
present family of Carnegie of Lower and Turin are descendants 
from him. 

Land-Oioners.— These, with their respective valuations, are as

Parochial Registers.— The parochial registers consist, Ut, of 
the register of baptisms. It begins in 1659, and continues till 17 15. 
2d, Minutes of session, beginning 1691, and continuing to 1715. 
In 1717, registers of both descriptions just noticed are begun, and 
continued to the present time.  n . a ■ 

Public Buildings.— There is a town and county-hall situated in 
the centre of the town, and in the same building, for the present, 
is the iail for both civil and criminal prisoners, which has been 
declared wholly inadequate and unsuitable for carrying into opera- 
tion the new system of prison discipline. Not many years ago, 
the proprietors' in the county applied for and obtained an act of 
Parliament for erecting a sherift-court-house, sheriff clerks of- 
fices, record and jury-rooms, &amp;c. which were erected at an expense 
of nearly L 5000. They are commodious and handsome. 1 hey 
are situated in the centre of the town. Ground has been purchased 
for the erection of a new prison, a little to the north of the to.n, 
on the property belonging to the burgh, and the work is com- 
menced.

Of this number, 7363 reside in tlie old parish, and 2224 in the 
quoad sacra parish of St James. In the old parish, the number 
of families is 1044; in St James's parish, 272. 

IV. — Industry. 
The great proportion of the population of Forfar is employed 
in the linen manufacture trade. The fabrics generally made in 
Forfar are, sheetings, Osnaburghs, and dowlas. About 3000 in- 
dividuals are employed in weaving. The number of webs wrought 
in the week is about 2000. The present depressed wages are, 
for sheetings, 8s. per web ; Osnaburghs, 79. ; dowlas, 8s. Out 
of this sum the weaver has to pay about Is. 6d. for winding. 

V. — Pakochial Economy. 

Town The town of Forfar consists of two principal streets, 

the one proceeding from east to west, and the other from the cross 
to the north. The great road from Perth to Aberdeen passes 
through the town, entering at the west and passing out by the 
north. There are several smaller streets, and the town was ra- 
pidly increasing in population and extent until the depression in 
the staple trade of the district, which has continued for some years, 
has checked the progress of building. Within the last forty years 
the aspect of the town has much improved. Before that time the 
general appearance of the buildings was mean, many of them being 
covered with thatch, and outside stairs and other projections upon 
the streets were numerous. But now, the houses are substantially 
built, and there are many of a superior description ; and the streets 
are open, and all projections into them removed. 

Railway, — The greatest recent improvement connected with 
Forfar and its neighbourhood has been the construction of the 
railway between Forfar and Arbroath. The terminus at Forfar is 
at the north of the town, about five minutes' walk from the cross. 
It proceeds through the parishes of Forfar, Rescobie, Guthrie, 
and St Vigeans, to Arbroath. The whole length of the line is 
15 miles, 2 furlongs, and 38 yards. The work was completed 
and opened for the conveyance of goods and passengers on the 
3d of January 1 839. 

 The inclination on the line is 196 feet, the terminus at Forfar being thus much 
above the terminus at Arbroath,

The foregoing extract is from the last annual statement issued 
by the company. This abstract comprehends the stock account 
down to the date of the balance, and the traffic account for the 
year, from the 15th of April 1840 to the 15th of Aprd 1841. The 
outlay of every description on the railway and works, and machi- 
nery, amounts to L.131,644, I6s. 6d. The revenue, from the 
traffic, for the past year, amounts to L.9,190, 9s. exclusive of 
L191 5s Ud. received for rents, &amp;c. The gross expenditure, 
connected with the traffic and management, is L-4,272, 12s. 8d., 
and the feu-duties and interest on debts amount to L.2,405, 12s. 
'4d leaving a net surplus revenue or profit of L.2,703, 9s. Sd. 
The whole expenses incurred in repairs of engines, waggons, and 
machinery, having been charged amongst the current expenditure, 
the reserved fund at last balance, which was L.1,144, 18s. 5d., is 
carried to surplus revenue, and the surplus revenue, now undivided, 
is, therefore, L.3,848, 7s. 8d. The guaranteed dividend of 5 per 
cent, on the new stock paid up, must first be provided for It 
amounts to L.628, 6s. 7d. ; and, this sum being deducted, there 
will remain L.3,220, Is. Id. to be divided among the holders of 
the original stock,-equal to a dividend of ful y 5 l-v cent Th 
directors mean to propose, that a dividend shall be declared at 
t rati of Sk per cent, and that the balance be earned to reve- 
nue account, as a reserved fund.

noint of view to the shareholders, it is a work which has been al-

Forfar and Kirriemuir has been rendered comfortable, and a wide 
Highland district thereby opened up. 

Ecclesiastical 5tae.— The church of the old parish is situated 
in the town of Forfar, and is rather inore than four miles from the 
most distartt houses in the parish. It was built in 1791 to accom- 
modate 2000 sitters. It was altered in the interior in 1836. By 
this alteration, the number of sittings was reduced to about 1800, 
but a great improvement was effected as to the facility of hearing. 
The church is a substantial building, though plain. In the interior 
it is commodious and elegant. It has a steeple, which was erected 
in 1814. The steeple is a well-proportioned and handsome struc- 
ture, and forms one of the principal ornaments of the town. It 
•has three bells, all of them the gift of a Mr Strang, merchant in 
Stockholm, about the year 1650, a native of Forfar. 

The church of St James was erected in 1836, at an expense of 
about L. 1200. It is seated for 1100 hearers. It is a neat and 
comfortable church. A district as a quoad sacra parish was allo- 
cated to it by the Presbytery of Forfar. 

The present Episcopal chapel was erected in 1824. It is un- 
der the superintendence of the Bishop of Dunkeld. It accommo- 
dates 380 sitters. 

. The United Secession meeting-house was erected about the 
year 1780. It accommodates 400. 

There is an Independent chapel in the town, which accommo- 
dates 400. It was erected in 1836. 

The old Mason Hall was recently purchased by some parties 
not resident in Forfar of the Roman Catholic communion, and 
there is occasional worship in it. 

The stipend of Forfar is 21 chalders of victual, half meal and 
half barley. The glebe was valued by the Ecclesiastical Commis- 
sioners at L.20. The present manse is a modern building. It 
is a large and commodious house.' 

Education. — There are 14 schools in the parish ; being 1 
parochial school, 3 burgh schools, and 10 private schools. There 
is a deficiency in the means of education for the children 
■of the labouring-classes. Their earnings are such as to prevent 
them, in many cases, from paying for the education of their chil- 
■dren, even low as the fees are. The magistrates and town-council 
have had this important subject under their consideration, and have 
purchased a site for the erection of a school in the west end of 



IX2 FORFARSHIRE.  

the town, a locality where it will prove highly convenient and be 



neficial 



The parochial schoolmaster has the maximuni salary, with L.8 
in lieu of a dwelling-house. One of the burgh teachers has a sa-  
lary of L.40. The other two have school-rooms free 6f rent, but 

' W:'\o the year 1840, the poor's funds of the burgh 
and those of the landward parish were under separate manage- 
ment : but in that year an assessment having become indispen- 
sable for the relief of the poor of the parish, the distinction for- 
merly recognized and acted on was discontinued on the opinion ot 
eminent counsel, who were consulted on the point P-v.ous to 
that vear, the poor bad been supported by te col ections at the 
church dors, rent of land mortified for the behoof of the poor, 
and voluntary subscriptions from the landward heritors for he 
poor of the landward part of the parish. The assessment for the 
first year was L.350. Last year it was L.700, and there is reason 
to believe it will go on increasing, in consequence of the depressed 
condition of trade. The assessment would have been imposed in 
this parish before the period referred to, had not the revenue from 
the iLd purchased by money mortified about 1650,  
merchant, Stockholm, afforded a considerable income for the relief 

Lrte Ue'individuals or families on the monthly roll, wo 
receive on an average 4s. per month. There are 19 on the weekly 
Xreceiving on an average 2s. per week. There are 14 inmates 

in the poor's house. rr.

PRESBYTERY OF FORDOUN, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEAllNS. 

THE REV. JOHN GLEGG, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — This parish takes its name from the small river that 
runs along its north-east boundary ; and, according to Chalmers, 
in his Caledonia, the water of Bervie derives its name from the 
British Be7-u to flow, Berw, Berwy, a boiling or ebullition. This 
etymology corresponds exactly with the character of the stream. 
A distinction between the name of the parish and the burgh may 
be marked by the Gaelic word Inver, which indicates the situa- 
tion of the town by its signification, and ought to be applied to the 
burgh only. 

Extent, Sfc. — The extent of the parish in length is about 2 miles, 
and in breadth about 1. Its figure is quadrilateral. It is bound- 
ed towards the south and south-west, by the parish of Benholme ; 
the north-west, by the parish of Garvock; the north and north- 
east, by the parish of Arbuthnott ; the east, by the parish of Kin- 
neff ; and its boundary on the south-east is the German Ocean. 

Topographical Appearances. — The parish has a gradual ascent 
from east to west, with two ranges of hill running nearly parallel. 
There is a considerable extent of flat land towards the south and 
east boundaries of this parish. There is a small fertile valley 
along the eastern boundary, through which the water of Bervie 
runs to the sea. The ground on either side is high, and presents 
a variety of surface. The extent of the coast is about a mile and 
a-half, being the breadth of the parish ; and it appears rocky, ex- 
cepting that part of it immediately opposite the town. The rocks 
are not high, being nearly all covered at high water. It would 
seem that the sea had receded considerably from the high land 
towards the south-east boundary of the parish, as there are several 
projecting rocky eminences of considerable height, which evident- 
ly appear to have at one time been washed by the ocean. There

is a conspicuous land-mark, called Bervie Brow, which is seen by 
mariners at a great distance. Although it is in the parish of Kin- 
neff, it may be noticed here ; and it is also called the rock of 
Craiff David, by the circumstance of that monarch's landing near 
the spot. The hill called Gourdon Hill, in the parish of Bervie, 
is also seen by mariners at a great distance. 

Meteor ologij.—T\\Q winds that generally prevail are the north 
and north-east winds in winter; the south and south-east in the 
spring ; the south, south-west, and north-west generally in summer 
and autumn. The climate is good ; and, as a proof of its salubrious 
nature, it may be mentioned, that there are few prevailing distem- 
pers in the district. Influenza, however, has been very severe in 
this parish during the winter. Twenty persons belonging to the place 
died of it in the course of a fortnight, and nearly the half of the 
population were more or less aff"ected, and confined to bed, by the 
malady. But, as it has been general in town and country through- 
out Scotland, the prevalence of the disease here cannot be regard- 
ed as any proof of the climate's being unfavourable to health in 
general. 

m/droffraphi/.— There are many excellent perennial springs m 
the parish. The water for the supply of the town, after running 
so far in a covered drain, is conveyed by leaden pipes to a cis- 
tern, and thence to small wells of cast metal in the burgh, 
which afford the inhabitants a regular supply of the very best 
water. The only river near the parish is the Water of Ber- 
vie, which has its source among the Grampians, in the upper 
district of the parish of Glenbervie. It has a course of nearly 
twelve miles, and winds in beautiful curves as it" runs on. Its 
banks, as it passes through the parish of Arbuthnott, are here and 
there diversified with fine thriving plantations, and enclosed fertile 
fields and pastures, belonging to the Viscount of Arbuthnott; 
and it runs into the sea at the eastern extremity of the parish of 
Bervie. There is also a small burn, the Burn of Peattie, whose 
water collects about the north-west boundary of the parish, and 
runs in a short course from west to east into the Water of Bervie. 
This little stream is found of great service to the tenants who have 
their farms near it, as it aff-ords a constant supply of water to their 

Geology and Mineralogtj.— The soil of the low lands of the 
parish is deservedly reckoned the most fertile in the comity. It is 
a fine loam of considerable depth, resting on a bed of gravel, easily 



BERVIE.

pervious by water. The gravel is superincumbent on a coarse 
sandstone conglomerate, and, with the exception of a few patches 
of trap, provincially called scurdy, this sandstone prevails through- 
out the whole parish. Where seen exposed, as within flood-mark 
of the sea, and in one or two sections inland, where it has been 
quarried for building, it presents alternate layers of rounded blocks 
of various sizes. In some layers the sandstone produces durable 
materials for building ; and it may be obtained at little expense, 
and separated into blocks of good size. Within flood-mark one 
or two veins of trap, of a ferruginous colour, have been observed ; 
but it is not very apparent that these produce much disruption of 
the beds, or much alteration of the inclination of the strata, which 
may be stated as generally to north-west, with a dip of 15° or 25°, 
and having, with slight variation, a direction from south -west to 
north-east. The veins alluded to are of a porphyritic structure, 
and not more, at most, than two feet ,in thickness. Boiilders of 
various sizes, from a foot in diameter to seven feet, are seen within 
flood-mark ; the largest of these is a block of quartz rock. The 
others are of granite, gneiss, mica slate, &amp;c. These boulders, 
however, are not numerous, excepting near the village of Gour- 
don. The beach consists of a considerable mass of small pebbles 
of jasper, porphyry, slate, agate, &amp;c. Beautiful agates are occa- 
sionally found in the loose soil on the higher grounds, as well as 
on the .beach ; and in the Den of Peattie, through which the little 
stream above alluded to, runs to the water, a large crystal of topaz 
was found. It is to be observed, that on the highest part of the 
parish adjoining to Benholme, which forms a hill of perhaps 400 
feet and upwards in height, and which rises from the margin of 
the sea, little soil is to be found, and the puddingstone appears 
at the summit. The haugh lands adjoining the sea, which had 
at one time been overflowed by it, are composed entirely of a mass 
of small pebbles, mixed with black earth : the pebbles form the 
greatest portion of the mass. These lands are very fertile ; 'rent 
at about L. 5 per acre ; and it is said, that if these pebbles were 
removed, the land would be rendered unproductive. 

It may be here observed, that part of the upper fields in the 
parish is composed of a strong soil upon a clay bottom. 

Zoology. — This parish abounds with hares. The birds within 
it are neither numerous in species, nor rare ; a few may be set 
down as inhabitants or occasional visitors. Horn-owl, screech-owl, 
common owl, common crow, hooded-crow, rook, jackdaw, magpie

KINCARDINESHIRE. 



song-thi'usli, blackbird, water-ouzel, stonecliat, redbreast, white 
wagtail, field-lark, several species of titmouse, yellow-hammer, 
corn-bunting, green-finch, house sparrow, chaffinch, common hn- 
net, window-swallow, black martin, ring-dove or cushat, par- 
tridge, common heron, corncrake, common snipe, wdd duck, 
cuckoo. 

The birds which may be reckoned visitors are sea-fowl m im- 
mense numbers, such as gulls, terns, and wild geese, wild swans, 
two beautiful white swans were shot a few years ago at the mouth 
of the river, the starling, curlew, rock-pigeon, woodcock, pheasant, 
kite or glead, blue hawk, raven, fieldfare, snow-bunting, bullfinch, 
goldfinch. The water of Bervie is fidl of fine trout ; and salmon 
frequent it. Crabs and lobsters abound among the rocks near 
the bay, and shrimps are likewise got among the sands. 

In i 826 the beautiful king'sfisher, Alcedo ispida, the famed 
halcyon of antiquity, was frequently seen sporting among the 
rocks at the mouth of the river, its plumage glittering in the 
sunbeams. 

The horses in this parish are of good size, and hardy, and ex- 
cellent for draught. The cows are excellent milkers ; their calves 
grow large, and readily meet a good market. The fat cattle, 
which the farmers feed with turnips, bring always good prices. 
Very few sheep are reared in the parish. 

Botany— Among the rare plants in this parish, may be noted 
the following : DiantJncs deltoides, Hordeum murinum and Pul- 
monaria maritima. All the common seeds of plants and herbs for 
culinary purposes,— such as cabbages, carrots, brocoli, cauliflower, 
sallad, lettuce, cress, parsley, spinage, mustard, peas, beans, leeks, 
onions, raddish; and also some of the sweet and physica herb 
seeds, such as marjoram, marigold, rosemary, thyme, &amp;c. do well 
in the gardens. Seeds for agricultural purposes, such as clover, 
rye-grass, rib-grass, tares, turnip, carrot, &amp;c. thrive welhn the fields. 
And the perennial herbaceous plants, such as primrose, polyan- 
thus, pinks, rocket, rhubarb, sweet William, violet, wallflower, 
tulips, &amp;c. are seen in the gardens in all their variety of colours. 
And fruit trees, such as the Keswick codling, Ribston pippm, the 
moorfowlegg, and Jargonelle pear, the May Duke and blackheart 
cherry bear well in the little gardens, as well as the rasp and 
gooseberry bushes, the currants and strawberries. 

The more remarkable native plants in the vale of Bervie are

eiuunerated in the Account of the adjQinuig parish of Arbulhnott, 
to which the reader is referred. 

The crreatest elevation, Bervie Hill, is about 400 feet; but the 
parish embraces part of the sea coast, and enjoys a temperature 
superior to that of the inland districts on the same parallel of latitude. 
In a very warm hollow near Gourdon is found Hordeiim murinum. 
It was seen there in 1824 by Mr Murray, and it is the first lo- 
cality north of the Forth. The beautiful Pulmonaria maritima 
abounds on the low stony beach. Various species of Carex, and 
occasionally several plants from the upland districts, Vicia sylva- 
tica, &amp;c. are brought down by the river .floods ; Conium maculatum 
spotted hemlock used in medicine, abounds in the rich rank soil of 
waste Corners and lanes of the burgh, although rare in inland 
country parishes ; Carduus tenuiflorus occurs on road sides. 
The warm arable lands contain the pretty scarlet pimpernel ; and 
Scandix pecten, Saxifraga granulata, Dinnthus deltoides, Allium 
vineale, Eupatorhtm Cannabinum, Ligusticum Scoticum, Silene mari- 
tima, and Bromus pinnatus, are found in the recesses of the rocks 
on the north bank of the river in Kinneff. Chara vulgaris occurs 
in some pools ; and in the muddy shores of the neighbouring parish 
of Benholme, Aster Tripolium. 

There are some thriving plantations, which consist of ash, elm, 
beech, birch, firs, Scotch, silver, spruce, and pine, hazel, oak, 
larch, &amp;c. The trees are not yet of large size, as it is not many 
years since they were planted. The ash, oak, and other trees in 
the dens are doing well. Those that are planted in more exposed 
situations, and where there is less soil, appear not so vigorous. 

II. — Civil History. 

The events worthy of notice connected with this parish are few. 
The landing of David II. in 1342, — the passing of the Duke of 
Cumberland in 1745 on his way to the north, — and the gallantry 
of a small body of volunteers belonging to Bervie, during the French 
war, may not be uninteresting to readers. King David Bruce, by 
the violence of a storm, was forced to land at the mouth of the 
water of Bervie. He met with very kind treatment from the in- 
habitants, which so gratified and pleased him, that he granted a 
charter to Bervie, conferring many privileges on its inhabitants. 
This charter was renewed by James VI. in 1595. 

At the time of the Rebellion in 1745, an occurrence took place, 
which greatly alarmed the inhabitants of this parish, and led the 
minister, Mr Dow, to use his influence for the protection of their 



6 



KINCAIIDINESHIRE. 



persons and property. Mr Dow, upon learning that the troops un- 
der the command of His Royal Highness the Duke of Cumber- 
land could not be restrained from burning the boats of the fisher- 
men, plundering and destroying the neighouring village of Johns- 
haven, in the parish of Benholme, on account of some of the m- 
habitants being suspected of sending out provisions in boats to 
some of the Pretender's troops that were passing by sea, set out on 
foot to meet His Royal Highness, for the purpose of mediating 
in behalf of his parishioners. It is said that he met the army, 
headed by the Royal equipage at the'Bridge of Benholme, about 
three miles from Bervie ; that he was taken into the Duke's coach, 
conveyed to his own door, and honoured with His Royal High- 
ness, as his guest for the night. This interview afforded the mi- 
nister an opportunity of assuring his distinguished guest, that the 
inhabitants of Bervie were well affected to His Majesty's govern- 
ment, and it was the means of saving them from the rough treat- 
ment of the soldiers, who, otherwise, might have treated them as 
they did their neighbours in Johnshaven, upon groundless suspi- 
cions of disaffection in these disturbed times. 

In the year 1800, a French sloop of war appeared one day on 
the coast of Bervie, and pursued several merchant vessels that were 
within her reach, till they took shelter in the mouth of the water, 
and in the port at Gourdon. This privateer would, unquestion- 
ably, have made them her prizes ; the crew might have landed, 
destroyed and plundered the town, and carried off a great deal of 
property ; had it not been that the presence and gallantry of a 
small body of volunteers, belonging to the parish, quite intimidat- 
ed them. The volunteers were immediately called to arms by the 
provost of the burgh, Mr Hudson, and marched in two divisions 
to the beach, to face the enemy. The one party took the one side 
of the water, and the other went in the direction of the old Castle 
of Hallgreen. The guns of the privateer were pointed in the 
direction of those who had gone to the beach, and taken up then- 
position among the rocks, and soon began to discharge then- balls 
in all directions among them, but happily without doing any mis- 
chief. Several rounds of musketry were tired by the volunteers, 
till the crew of the privateer began to suspect, that a heavy fire 
was about to be opened upon them by the party who had gone in 
the direction of the Castle of Hallgreen, whom they believed to be 
a body of artillerymen belonging to that castle, which commands 
the bay, and has much the appearance of a fort. But, be thi as 



BERVIE.

it may, it is related by those who were among the vohmteers on 
that occasion, that no sooner were they seen marching to the 
heights near the castle, than the ship-of-war put up all sail, and 

hastened out of sight. 

Plans and surveys of this parish are in the possession of the 
proprietors, or their factors and surveyors. 

Land-oioners.—T\iQ chief land-owners are, the Viscount of Ar- 
buthnott, and James Farquhar, Esq. 

Parochial Registers.— T\vq parochial registers, which are m a 
state of good preservation, have no earlier entries than in 1742 in 
the Book of Discipline, and 1766 in the Cash-book. There were 
lately found among some old papers, session records with entries 
in 1657, but they are so mutilated as scarcely to be legible. The 
books which contain the present records of the session are two 
volumes,— the one with the cash entries and distributions for be- 
hoof of the poor, and the other containing the minutes connected 
with the usual business of the session, and the registers of mar- 
riages and baptisms. These books are very ; accurately kept by 
Mr Paterson, the schoolmaster of the parish, who is session -clerk. 

Antiquities.— Theve is a market- cross in the burgh near the 
town-house. It consists of a column of stone about 14 feet high, 
with a ball on the top of it, and it is surrounded at the base by a 
flight of steps. It is apparently of considerable antiquity. There 
had formerly been a religious house here, belonging to a body of 
friars, as there are in the possession of the feuars, charters, with 
such words as Friars Dubbs, &amp;c. 

The discovery of graves by the workmen employed, when the 
turnpike road was in making, is a further evidence of the existence 
of such an establishment, for it was near the place still known by 
the name of Friars Dubbs; and it is conjectured that these graves 
mark the spot where the friars had their burying-ground. 

There are on the top of a hill, in this parish, three circles of 
earth and stone near one another, which are evidently of antiquity. 
It would be vain to speculate about the purpose for which they 
may have been originally formed. It may have been for religious 
ceremonies, or, what is more likely, these circles may be the ves- 
tiges of a Roman camp. 

The old Castle of Hallgreen is situated at the southmost point 
of the Parliamentary boundary of the burgh, on an eminence near 
the sea, and is a large building. A date appears on the west front 
of it, considerably effaced, but supposed to be 1376. Its walls are 



8 



KINCARDINESHIRE. 



very thick, and full of arrow-holes, and the stones in many parts 
appear much worn by the lapse of ages. There is every appear- 
ance of its having been surrounded by a moat, over which there 
had been a drawbridge with a portcullis near the outer gate of 
the court. Several additions appear to have been made to this 
castle at different periods. Above a door in the court, there is the 
date 1687, with the initials of a proprietor, Mr Raitt, who then 
occupied this mansion, and had made a considerable addition to 
it ; and there is in one of the principal rooms, on the stucco-ceil- 
ing, a coat-of-arms, with the words spero meliora, and the date 
1683. There are also some paintings on the old wainscots which 
lines the walls, which look like Dutch paintings, viz. two landscapes 
and a flower-piece. The modern part of this building is habitable, 
and is presently occupied by a family. 

It may not be improper to notice here some other evidences of 
the antiquity and consequence of the burgh of Inverbervie, such 
as the existence of a spacious mansion, surrounded by a high wall, 
having an arched gateway, in front, of fine workmanship. This 
edifice, it is said, originally belonged to the Marischal family, and 
latterly became the property and was the town residence of the 
noble family of Arbuthnott. No part of the building now remains. 
It was taken down, and the foundation cleared out, about twenty 
years ago, to make way for feuing and other improvements. There 
are several other old buildings pointed out as the town residences 
of the neighbouring lairds. All these circumstances shew that 
this place had attracted early notice, and had been a favourite place 
of resort for the gentry. 

The town-house is a building of two storeys. There are two 
dates above the door, the one is 1569, and the other 1720, with 
the word below it rebuilt. It consists of a hall and small council- 
room in the upper floor, and the lower contains the flesh and 
meal-market, to which there is attached a small arched vault, vul- 
garly called the Black Hole. This place is quite unfit for the re- 
gular confinement of prisoners, but is found sometimes very con- 
venient when vagrants become troublesome, and give annoyance 
to the inhabitants, for they are shut up in it for a few hours by 
order of the magistrates. There is a handsome belfry on the town- 
house, containing a bell, which is rung four times a-day for the 
benefit of the public, viz. at six and nine o'clock m the morning, 
at two in the afternoon, and at nine at night. 

Modern Buildivgs.—The new parish church, which was opened 



BERVlli:. 



9 



for public worship on the 1st of Januai-y 1837, is particularly de- 
serving of notice. It is an elegant edifice, built in the Gothic 
style, with a square tower rising to the height of upwards of 100 feet, 
and ornamented with carved minarets. The main entrance to the 
church is by a splendid vestibule in the tower. It is enclosed on 
the west, north, and east, by substantial walls, built of stone and 
lime, with a coping of hewn work, and towards the south-east by 
an elegant metal railing, in which there is a fine gate, with beau- 
tiful pillars of hewn work. The small elevation of the building, 
at a little distance from the street, gives it a fine effect. . The tower 
is seen to great advantage in all directions, and gives an air of or- 
nament and grandeur to the burgh which it had not before. The 
entire building does great credit to the architect, to the undertaker, 
and the workmen, and is much admired. It will stand as a monu- 
ment to perpetuate to future generations the remembrance of the 
piety and zeal of the heritors of this parish, for the glory of God 
and the spiritual welfare and comfort of the people. 

The manse, which immediately adjoins the church, is a house 
of two storeys fronting the street, and is sufficiently comfortable 
and commodious. The school-house, which is situated at the 
east corner of the town, is a small building of two storeys, com- 
manding a fine view of the sea, but much exposed. The head 
inn stands at the north-east entrance to the burgh, and commands 
a fine view of the scenery above the bridge, where the old castle of 
Allardice, in the parish of Arbuthnott, appears in the distance on 
an elevation, surrounded with trees and shrubbery. 

The bridge thrown across the water at the approach to the 
town on the north-east is a fine structure, consisting of one beau- 
tiful arch of a large span. The height of the bridge from the bed of 
the river cannot be less than 80 feet. The place fixed on for 
building it was found to be well adapted for the undertaking, as 
thebanks on either side are high, and composed of rock. Experience 
has proved the substantial nature of the foundation. The bridge 
has never been injured by the greatest floods which have happen- 
ed, while the houses on the haughs have been often damaged, and 
sometimes in danger of being swept away by the swelling of the 
water, and the force of the current. If easy access could be got to 
the doors of the large apartments at the end of this bridge, they 
might be converted to some useful purpose. They have occasionally 
been used as coal-sheds, but they are at present quite empty. 

There is a meal and barley mill on the haugh below the bridge,

KINCARDINESHIRE. 



and beside it a small spinning-mill. There is, on the upper side 
of the bridge, a spinning-mill of three stories, which was the 
first that was established in Scotland for the spinning of yarn and 
thread. This mill is at present undergoing a thorough repair, and 
considerable additions are making to it, and, when completed, it will 
employ a good many more additional hands. All the machinery 
at these mills is moved by water. 

III. — Population. 
This parish was originally a part of that of Kinneff. It was se- 
parated from it about the time of the Reformation, when the Lords 
of the Congregation were deeply interesting themselves in the 
plantation of kirks, and in securing the Protestant worship through- 
out Scotland, after Presbyterian church government had been es- 
tablished by an act of Legislature. The early state of the popu- 
lation cannot be distinctly traced. By the Government census 
taken at different times, it would appear that there has been for 
some time past a gradual increase. This may be accounted for 
in a great measure by the introduction of spinning-mills, and the 
encouragement given to weavers in the establishment of different 
manufactures, employing a good many hands at the loom for va- 
rious fabrics, such as linen, canvass, weaving, &amp;c.

Character of the People.— The inhabitants of this parish are of 
cleanly habits in general, and always study to appear in good 
clothes They seem to be comfortable and contented, with very 
few exceptions. The station in which they are placed under Pro- 
vidence does not admit of their devoting much time to the im- 
provement of intellect, or advances in science, but they are, ge-- 
nerally speaking, a moral and religious people, who pay a becom- 
ing regard to the sanctity of the Sabbath, and to gospel ordi- 
nances ; and but very few among them have ever ben found gu 
of grossly transgressing the laws of the land, established foi the 



BERVIE.

good order of society. Poacliing in game, and in salmon, and 
smuggling prevailed, it is said, to a considerable extent amongst 
the people of this parish in former years. But there is now no 
such thing heard of as smuggling, and the cases of poaching are 
very rare. The iniquitous practice is sufficiently infamous, of itself, 
to stamp the mark of shame on every poacher, and no one who 
has a regard for his character will ever engage in it. It may be 
mentioned here, as one distinguishing trait in the character of the 
inhabitants of Bervie, that they are always alive to the calls of 
humanity, and ready to give aid, according to their circumstances, 
to alleviate the sufferings of their fellow-creatures. And this is, 
surely, one grand effect which the gospel has produced, as it is 
the benign spirit of Christianity which can awaken and keep alive 
in our hearts a fellow-feeling for the distresses and wants of others. 

IV. — Industry. 

There are about 50 persons, including farmers and' their male 
servants, employed in agriculture in this parish. 

When the spinning-mill, Avhich is at present under repair, is set 
a-going, there may be about 14 males, including masters and boys, 
engaged at both mills. 

The number of workmen employed at the dowlas linen weaving, 
including agents, may be about 1 12. 

There are 8 shopkeepers, 7 shoemakers, 3 tailors, 5 house- 
carpenters, 5 blacksmiths, 1 cart and plough-wright, 3 masons, 
1 watch and clock-maker, 1 cooper, 2 slaters, 1 plasterer, 1 flax- 
dresser, 1 saddle and harness-maker, 1 boat-builder, being in all 
40 masters, who employ occasionally several hands, according to 
their extent of business. There are also 3 carriers, and several 
carters, 5 meal sellers, and 2 fleshers. 

The number of males employed in the fisheries, as nearly as can 
be ascertained, is 70. 

Agriculture. — 

The number of standard imperial acres cultivated in the parish is about J 222 

acres uncultivated, including roads, is fully . 500 

acres which might be profitably added to the cultivated land is 

about . , 

acres under planted wood is about . . 70 

Rent of Land.~T\xe average rent of arable land in the parish 
IS about L. 2, 10s. per acre. The rent varies from L. 6 to L. 1. 
The rent of grazing, as charged by the burgh, per cow is L. 1 ; 
and the rent per ewe, as charged by the farmer for hill pasture' 
is about 6d. each. '

KINCAUUINKSHIRE. 



Wages.— The general rate of a ploughman's wages exclusive of 
two pecks of meal per week, and a pint of milk daily, is per year 
about L. 12 ; females, L. 4, L. 5, and L. 6. The wages of out- 
door females per day, 7d. The rate of an artisan's labour per 
day is in summer 2s., and in winter Is. 6d. The rate for mason- 
work may vary, per week, from 12s. to 20s. The rate of car- 
penter work is' also various ; in general it is about 2s. per day. 

Prices of Provisions.— The price of butter per imperial pound 
varies from 5d. to lOd. ; the price of eggs per dozen, from4d.to7d. ; 
the price of meal per stone, Is. 6d. to 2s. 2d ; the price of milk 
per Scotch pint, 2d. to 3d. ; cheese per stone, 6s. to 8s. ; butcher- 
meat 4d. to 5d. per pound. 

Live-StocL— The cattle in the parish are generally of the An- 
gus breed. Those that are reared in it are very fine beasts, but 
they are but few in number, as the farms are principally grain 
farms, and are not generally employed in pasturage. 

Husbandnj.— The husbandry is excellent, and the fields, which 
are tastefully laid off from one another, produce the most abun- 
dant crops of all kinds of grain, such as wheat, beans and peas, 
oats, barley, potatoes, turnips, &amp;c. and no better mode of farm- 
ing than that which is presently followed could be devised. Waste 
land to a considerable extent has been reclaimed, durmg the last 
twelve years, by draining, &amp;c. 

Leases.— The duration of leases in the parish is nmeteen years, 
with the exception of the burgh lands, which have been for some 
time past let at no longer a lease than that of ten years. A lease 
for nineteen years is considered sufficiently favourable, when a farm 
is entirely improved ; but a longer lease would be considered more 
advantageous to the tenant where much land has to be reclaimed. 
In this parish, the farmers seem to be well satisfied with the com- 
mon nineteen years lease. 

The farm-buildings are in a state of good order, and are cover- 
ed for the most part with slates or tiles. The proprietors give 
every encouragement to their tenants, and have never been known 
to refuse a reasonable request, the tenants are most respectable 
and industrious. They have great advantages which those m in- 
land parishes cannot possibly enjoy; such as the genial nature of 
the climate, the superior quality of the soil, the large supply of 
sea weed for manure, the grain market established m the burgh 
and the shipping port of Gourdon in the parish, where they get 



CERVIE. 



13 



liine and coals at little expense, and where they deliver their 
grain, &amp;c. 

Quarries. — There are at present several open quarries of sand- 
stone in the parish, which afford large blocks of excellent materials. 
They might be turned to good account, if building were to go on 
extensively in the neighbourhood. The most of the new build- 
ings in this and the neighbouring parishes have been supplied with 
stones from these quarries. The greater part of the stones for the 
new parish church was got from them. 

Fisheries. — Of these there are several kinds; the salmon, cod 
and ling, and haddock fisheries. The salmon-fishing is carried on 
in the bay. The salmon is taken by stake-nets placed in the rocks 
near the mouth of the water, and by floating nets in the bay ; and 
is acknowledged to be of a superior quality. It is high priced at 
the commencement of the fishing, and is sent principally to the 
London market. The fishing begins on the '2d of February, and 
ends on the 14th of September. It rents yearly at L. 130. The 
price of the salmon when purchased at the fishing station varies 
from 2s. 6d. to 2s., Is. 6d., Is., lOd., 8d., and 6d., per pound, 
according to the season, the grilse and trout being proportionally 
cheaper. 

The cod and ling fishery is kept up by a fish-curer, who engages 
a good many of the fishermen in the parish, during the season, 
and employs an experienced person to dress and salt the cod and 
ling for the London market. The number prepared for exporta- 
tion yearly may be about 97 barrels, containing each 3 cwt. ; and 
they are sent to Montrose to be there shipped for London. This 
fishery commences on the 1st October, and closes on the 15th 
July. A trade in summer is carried on by the same person in the 
drying of cod, for home consumption. 

The haddock-fishing is also carried on to a considerable extent, 
and, till lately, the consumption was chiefly home consumption. 
In the course of last year, a few individuals formed themselves into 
a company for haddock curing, and made an engagement with the 
fishermen to supply them daily. They have hitherto been carry- 
ing on a very successful trade in dressing, smoking, and barrelling 
the haddocks for distant markets, such as those of London and 
Glasgow, where they have found a great demand and ready sale 
for them ; and they are likely to have, at the proper season, suffi- 
cient encouragement to enable them to keep up this establish- 
ment. This undertaking affords many advantages to the fisher- 



14 



KINCARDINESHIRE. 



men ; — they are saved the trouble of sending the bulk of their fish 
inland, — they are encouraged to industry by the nature of their 
engagement with the curers, and by punctual payments on the 
spot ; and besides, there are a good many hands employed at this 
work, in cleaning, smoking the fish, &amp;c. who get their weekly 
wages regularly paid. All persons seem to be much interested in 
the success of this fishery. 

A turbot and skate fishery is also actively carried on from 1st 
May to 15th July, all for home consumption. There are six boats 
generally engaged. 

There was formerly a herring fishery in this parish, which was 
carried on successfully for several years. The herrings having 
gone off this coast, the fish-curers were reluctantly obliged to 
abandon the station. Some of them, however, are again to try it 
this year ; and for that purpose several boats htive been engaged 
for the ensuing season. Success in this fishery would be of vast 
importance to the place, and a rich source of emolument to all en- 
gaged in it. 

Produce. — The amount of raw produce, as nearly as can be as- 
certained, may be as follows : 

Potatoes, 50 acres, . L. 500 0 0 

Turnips, 110 acres, . 700 0 0 

Hay, 40 acres, . . 200 0 0 

Grazing, cattle and sheep, . 63 0 0 

Fisheries, . . 2500 0 0 

Grain, . . 3710 0 0 

Quarries, . . ' 30 0 0 

Miscellaneous produce, . 700 0 0 

L. 8403 0 0 

Manufactures. — The duck and dowlas linen weaving is carried 
on to a considerable extent in the town. It is kept up by mer- 
chants in Aberdeen, Dundee, and Arbroath, who employ a good 
many weavers under the direction of agents. 

The men, women, boys, and girls who are employed at the 
spinning-mills, work twelve hours five days in the week, and on 
Saturday only nine hours. The mill-master, who now rents both the 
mills for flax-spinning, had some time ago such a demand for yarn, 
as to be induced to carry on his work during the whole night as 
well as the day ; and for that purpose, he engaged spinners for the 
night work. But while this was found for a time advantageous 
to the manufacturer in point of profit, it proved peculiarly unfa- 
vourable to the health and morals of those employed at the mill, 
and it was ultimately given up ; and no man, who really wishes the 



BERVIE. 



15 



spiritual welfare and temporal comfort of his fellow-creatures, can 
ever desire to see the mills in operation during the hours design- 
ed by a gracious Providence for repose and rest. 

A sail-cloth manufacture once existed in this parish, and was 
carried on for a good many years ; and a branch of kelp manu- 
facture was also conducted on the beach, near the rocks, success- 
fully, for a considerable time. It was given up a few years ago, 
when the duty on the barilla was repealed. There was also a 
bleachfield on the haughs above the bridge, where bleaching 
formed part of the trade carried on in the parish. This has also 
been abandoned. 

Navigation. — There are but few vessels belonging to the port 
of Gourdon in this parish. They are not chartered here, but have 
to clear out at the custom-house in Montrose. There are two 
shipping companies connected with the place, who generally em- 
ploy two schooners and three or four sloops in the lime and coal 
trade. A good many ships come from other ports, bringing coals, 
lime, pavement, tiles, slates, wood, and occasionally cattle and 
ponies from Orkney and Shetland ; and they leave the port either 
in ballast or with grain, which at present is the only export trade 
of the parish of Bervie. The harbour dues are exceedingly mo- 
derate. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Burgh of Inverbervie. — There is no other town in the parish 
but the burgh, of which the principal trade is the manufacture of 
linen, commonly called duck and doiolas. The retail trade carried 
on by merchants for the supply of the inhabitants consists of gro- 
cery goods, clothiery, hardware, earthen-ware, &amp;c. A grain mar- 
ket was established here a few years ago, and it has been ever since 
carried on with the greatest success. It is frequented by corn-mer- 
chants from Montrose, Brechin, and Stonehaven ; and by farmers 
and millers from all the neighbouring parishes. It commences 
about the close of harvest, and holds every Wednesday thereafter 
for six months. A great deal of business is transacted. As far as 
can be ascertained, about 40,000 quarters of grain are purchased 
yearly, and the greater part of it delivered and shipped at Gourdon. 

This place has hitherto been well governed by a provost, three 
bailies, a dean of guild, nine councillors, a treasurer, and clerk. 
In testimony of which, it may be stated, that the magistrates of 
this burgh received the unanimous approbation of His Majesty's 
Commissioners, appointed to examine into the state of the diffe- 



IG KINCAIIDINESIIIIIE. 

rent burghs in Scothuid, and were applauded by them for their ju- 
dicious management of the funds, and the correct state of public 
accounts. Inverbervie now joins with Montrose, Brechin, Ar- 
broath, and Forfar, in returning a Member to Parliament. By the 
enactments in the new Municipal Bill, this, as well as other burghs, 
will experience a great change ; and time will only shew its work- . 
ing, either for good or evil. If the successors of the present ma- 
gistrates, who will, no doubt, come into office in the course of 
another year, strive to imitate their predecessors in that unanimity, 
fidelity, and zeal for the public good, which have distingmshed all 
their proceedings under the old Burgh Bill, there may be yet hope 
for the public weal under the new regulations. The present re- 
venue of the burgh is about L. 120. 

The Fishing Village of Gourdon.— is the only village in the 
parish, and it contained, when the census was taken in 1831, a po- 
pulation of 238 souls. It is situated at the southmost point of the 
parish, and is rather more than a mile distant from the burgh. It 
is a place rising daily into importance, by the success of the fish- 
eries and the increase of the grain trade. Several large and ex- 
cellent granaries have been erected in it, during the last eight or 
ten years, containing extensive sheds on the ground floors for lime, 
coal' &amp;c. The granaries are capable of holding 4570 quarters 
grain, the lime sheds, 3200 bolls, and the coal sheds, 12,700 bar- 
rels During the course of the last three or four years, the grain 
shipped at the port of Gourdon may be computed at nearly 30,000 
quarters yearly, two-thirds being barley and bear, and one-third 

beans, pease, and oats. 

There are seven small boats belonging to the village, which are 
generally employed in the haddock and cod fishery, and manned 
Lmmonly by six or seven men. There are ten larger boats, which 
the fishermen employ during the season for herring fishing, and 
manned, each, by five able bodied men, who go to the herring sta- 
tions about the middle of July yearly, and continue at the fishing 
for six weeks or two months. The yearly income of every mdus- 
trious fisherman in Gourdon may be betwixt L. 40 and L 50 

The water, at high-tide, rises 17 feet m the harbour of Gour- 
don at the point of the quay; and slnps, drawiiig 1 feet wa e, 
can enter at low tide, and he at anchor unUl it mak . It im 
contemplation to improve this harbour, which is capable of great 
rpHents. In its present state, eight or nine small vessels can 
be moored in it; and if the proposed improvements go on, they 



BERVIE. 



ir 



will be followed by great advantages to the shipping interest, to the 
inhabitants of the place, and surrounding country. 

The quarrying of stones, which for some time past has been car- 
ried on a little way to the eastward of the pier, is considered by 
sea-faring people if it be continued as likely to interfere with the 
protection of the shipping, as the rocks, at the place, are the na- 
tural barriers which check the waves from the east, and ought not, 
on any account, to be removed. 

Other means of communication are, the post-office in the burgh, 
the turnpike road passing direct across the parish, and two daily 
coaches, viz. the Royal Mail from Aberdeen to Edinburgh, and the 
Times, from Aberdeen to Perth, which change horses at the head 
inn near the post-office. These are conveniences which the in- 
habitants of inland parishes cannot possibly possess to such an ex- 
tent. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church, which has been al- 
ready noticed in a preceding part of this report, is situated on the 
north side of the burgh, and is very convenient for the greater 
part of the people. It is a new building, which was completed in 
1836, and seated for 900 persons. There are upwards of fifty 
free sittings set apart for the poor, besides a seat for baptisms, and 
pews for the minister, the elders, the schoolmaster, and a choir. 
The agricultural tenants, by the nature of their leases, have seats 
free of rent. The feuars and others pay a very low rate for seats, 
varying from 2s. to Is. only. The manse underwent a thorough 
repair about forty years ago, and a small addition was made to it 
last year. 

The extent of the glebe is under five acres Scotch measure. 
It contains very productive land, and if its value were to be calcu- 
lated by the average rent which small fields bring in the neigh- 
bourhood of the town, it may be rated at per acre nearly L. 4. 
The stipend is paid in money and grain by the heritors, out of the 
parish teinds. The money stipend, including communion elements, 
IS L. 41, 5s. lld. The grain stipend in bear and meal is 114 
bolls, 1 firlot, 2 pecks. 

There is a dissenting chapel in tHe burgh of the Independent 
persuasion. Its members belonging to this parish do not exceed 
five. This meeting has been in existence for about thirty years. 
The members, by collections and seat-rents, make up a sum of about 
L. 25 to the minister, who has from some other sources a small 
remuneration for his trouble in itinerating and preaching in various 

KINCARDINE. n

parishes during a few weeks in summer. The whole amount of his 
yearly income may be between L. 45 and L. 50. He is a very qmet 
and inoffensive man, and has an earnest desire to do good. Were 
all ministers of his persuasion of equally peaceful habits, there 
would be much less discord in many parishes between churchman 
and dissenter, than what generally prevails. His chapel is gene- 
rally well filled on Sunday evenings by the members ot the Jista- 

blished Church. „ i, i i 

Divine service at the parish church is generally well attended. 
There are a good many persons residing in Gourdon, and in the 
burgh who had no accommodation in the old church, and had no 
desire to dissent. By the habit of non-attendance, they lost, in a 
great measure,, a due sense of the sacred duty of joining in public 
worship ; but they are now happily coming up to the new church, 
where there is excellent accommodatioix for all in the parish, who 
sincerely wish to obey the divine command, and to profit by the 
public ordinances of the gospel. The number of communicants 
is about 470, being the average of several years. , . , , , 
The average yearly amount of the collections made in the old 
church for the poor was L. 30. An yearly collection, varying from 
L 4 to L. 5, is made for the Aberdeen Infirmary, and occasiona 
collections are made for religious purposes, such as the General 
Assembly's schemes, &amp;c. _ . 

£rf«caion.-There are, at present, six schools in the parish, viz. 
one parochial school, and five private schools unendowed 1 he 
branches of education taught at the parish school are, English 
reading, writing, arithmetic, English grammar, mathematics, Latin 
and GLek, &amp;c The teacher is a hcentiate of the Church of 
Scotland. The first private school is also taught by a licensed 
preacher of the gospel, who has an estabhshment for boardei., 
Ld teaches the same branches of education as those taught at he 
parochial school. The other private schools are all conducted 
ly females, and they are entirely for beginners learning to read. 
The salary of the parochial teacher is L.29, 18s. 9d. He has in 
lieu of garden, L. 2, 2s. 9d. The amount of his school fees vanes 
from L. 15 to L. 20. The rate of fees at the parochial school is as 
under: English reading, 3s. per quarter ; f-l'l;;, 
grammar, 5s. ; arithmetic, 4s. 6d. ; mathematics, , Latin os. , 
Greek, 5s. The terms of board and education at the prute s - 
minary are, for young gentlemen under ten years of age, L. 16 to 
L. 21 ; under fourteen, L. 22 to L. 25.

As far as is known, all boys and girls betwixt six and fifteen years 
of age, and all persons upwards of fifteen, are learning to read or can 
read, and a great proportion of them can write. 

The people in this parish would, no doubt, be more alive to the 
benefits of education afforded at the parish school, were an endow- 
ment to be procured for an assistant, so as to divide the labours 
between two teachers, the one to take charge of the elementary, 
and the other the more advanced classes. In such a place as the 
parish of Bervie, the extension of the school in this way would, 
unquestionably, be followed by most beneficial results ; parents' 
prejudices would be removed ; the teachers, by a full attendance 
of scholars, would be more encouraged to prosecute their arduous 
labours, and the interests of education, in every department of use- 
ful and religious knowledge, would prosper. 

Charitable Institutions.-— K Friendly Society was instituted here 
in 1799, for the benefit of widows and sick members. It has been 
productive of much good to the parish, by promoting industry, by 
supplying the wants of its members under sickness and old age, 
and by affording a small yearly aliment to widows. The number 
of persons belonging to this society is at present 110. The funds 
are under the management of a committee of members who meet 
quarterly. There is an annual meeting of the whole members. 
The rate of entry-money varies according to age, from 5s., 7s. 6d. 
10s., 15s. to 17s. 6d. The yearly rate is 4s. Id. The pre- 
sent yearly allowance to widows is L. 1, 4s. ; to superannuated 
members, L. 1, 7s. ; sick members receive weekly, 2s. 6d. The 
funds of this institution have been most judiciously managed; and, 
although now considerably diminished by the increase of widows, 
&amp;c. still amount to L. 461, 14s. Id. 

In consequence of the unfortunate loss of a boat's crew belong- 
ing to Gourdon in January 1815, five widows and thirteen children 
were left in the most destitute state. A sum of L. 240 was raised 
by subscription in different parishes for their relief. It was placed 
under the management of persons belonging to Bervie principally, 
who became responsible to the public for its proper appropriation. 
A committee was formed, and the money placed in a fund, to be 
managed to the greatest advantage ; -and, by a well-regulated dis- 
tribution, the widows on this fund were kept comfortable till their 
families grew up. Those of them who survive are at present in 
independence, and there is a balance in the hands of the treasurer 
of L. 50, to be applied in the time of need.

KINCARDINESIllUE. 



A Society, called the Benevolent Society of Odd Fellows, was 
instituted a few years ago, having the same laudable object in view 
as the Friendly Society. As it is but in infancy, its full benefits 
cannot yet be known. 

There is no savings bank in this parish. The nearest is that of 
the parish of Kinneff, about two miles and a-half distant from In- 
verbervie. It is understood to be prospering, and small sums are 
'sent to it from this place. 

Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons on the poor's 
roll is 15; and each receives, monthly, an allowance, varying, ac- 
cording to circumstances, from 8s. to 3s. and 2s. 6d. 

There are a good many dependent families and individuals who 
do not wish to be put on the roll. They accordingly receive from 
the parochial funds occasional supplies in the time of their need. 

The proportion of the fund which arises from church collections 
is annually about L. 30 ; the interest of legacies is about L. 30 ; 
and there are occasional donations given by the heritors of the pa- 
rish and others for immediate distribution, varying from L. 50 to 
L. 5. There is not at present a single pauper in the parish that 
is subjected to the demoralizing practice of begging from door to 
door. The poor, therefore, belonging to this place, have great reason 
to be grateful to God for such an ample provision to their temporal 
wants, and to rest satisfied and contented in their humble sphere 
under His kind providence. The princely benefaction of L. 500, by 
the will of the late James Farquhar, Esq. of Inverbervie, to the kirk- 
session for behoof of the poor of the parish ; and the gift of L, 50 
from the late Mrs Croll, to be added to the fund, place the poor 
under all ordinary circumstances beyond the reach of want. 

Fairs.— i:viO fairs are held annually on a common belonging 
to the town. They were established many years ago. The one 
always holds in May, on the Thursday before the 19th of that 
month, and the other on the Thursday before the 19th of Sep- 
tember. The first is well attended, and considered an excellent 
cattle market. The other, in September, is not so favourable for 
business, as it generally interferes with the harvest. In 1834, the 
magistrates of Bervie, with the sanction of the heritors of the pa- 
rish and the neighbourhood, established three additional markets 
in the burgh, for the feeing of servants, and for the sale of fat and 
other cattle. They fixed on the Wednesday before the 22d of No- 
vember as a market for the feeing of servan ts and the sale of cattle ; 
the Wednesday before Christmas, old style, and the Wednesday 



mulviE. 



21 



before the 13th February, in each year, for tlie sale of fat and 
other cattle. To escourage their success, the magistrates agreed 
to dispense with custom for the first three years. If these markets 
succeed, they will be of great advantage to many persons, both in 
town and country. 

Inns. — There are two inns in the burgh where good entertain- 
ments are furnished on the shortest notice. At the King's Armsy 
which is the head inn, a p'ost-chaise and gig are kept for hiring. 
There are other smaller inns and ale-houses hcensed for retailing 
spirits, ales, &amp;c. both in the town and the village of Gourdon ; and, 
however respectable the keepers of them may be, it is allowed by 
all who see the evils of intemperance, that there are too many in 
this parish, and that the licensing of more than what are necessary, 
is prejudicial in general to human character in every place. 

Fuel. — The fuel used by the inhabitants is English coals brought 
from Sunderland, and Scotch coals from ports on the Forth to the 
harbour of Gourdon, and sold at Is. per barrel when taken from the 
ship ; a little more is demanded, when taken from the sheds. The 
expense of carriage to the inhabitants charged by the carters is Igd 
per barrel. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

The present state of this parish, as compared with that which 
existed at the time of the last Statistical Account, exhibits a va- 
riety of improvements, such as the building of the bridge which 
was then only contemplated, excellent roads, reclaimed land by 
draining, neat and comfortable new houses, a weekly grain mar- 
ket, and an abundant supply of excellent water, in the town as 
well as in the village of Gourdon. The system of husbandry is 
now of the most improved kind. The farmers are all experienced 
agriculturists ; and in a very few years all the improvable land in 
the parish will be under cropping. 

There are three extensive farms in the parish of Bervie, Silly- 
flatt, Hallgreen, and Peattie,oneach of which there are four ploughs. 
There are four Threewells, Hill-head, Muslepool, and the Inn- 
farm, on which there is one each. There are two Newbigging 
and Dendoldrum on which there are two. The small ftu-ms and 
crofts are laboured by hiring. There are thrashing-mills driven 
by water on the largest farms ; and the grain on the lesser ones 
is thrashed by flails. 

Rent. — The rent of land, varies from L. 6 to L. 1 per acre. 

The boundary line between the burgh and the county, fixed by 



22 KINCARDINESHIRE. 

his Majesty's Commissioners after the passing of the Reform Bill, 
in 1832, is as follows : — 

« From the point on the east of the town at which the Bervie 
Water joins the sea, up the Bervie Water to the point at which the 
same is met by the boundary of the parish of Arbuthnott, to the 
point near Dendoldrum, at which the same meets the boundary, 
which separates the town lands from the property of Mr Farquhar, 
thence in a straight line to the point at which the several bounda- 
ries of the glebe land, the land of the towh's muir, and the pro- 
perty of Mr Farquhar meet ; thence in a straight line through the 
south-western corner of the old Castle of Hallgreen to the sea- 
shore ; thence along the sea-shore to the point first described."

PRESBYTERY OF EORDOUN, SYNOD OE ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. JOHN CHARLES, MINISTER. 



I. Topography and Natural History. 

ame —In the former Statistical Account of thisparish, the name 
Garvock is said to be " originally Gaelic, and to signify the rugged 
hilP'—consequently derived from the two Gaelic words Gatrabh 
and moc. But, as the hill of Garvock is by no means particular- 
ly rugged, it is much more probable that Garvock is derived from 
the two Gaelic words Gairabh andpoMC, signifyingthe roughMarsh 
or Meadow ; a name which is still very descriptive of the uncu - 
tivated part of the parish : and must have been originally highly 

applicable to the whole. 

Extent and Boundaries.— The extreme length of the parish, 
from N. E. to S. W. is fully seven miles ; and its extreme breadth 
from N. W. to S. E. is about four miles. Its boundary line is 
very irregular, so that its contents do not much exceed 13 square 
miles It is bounded on the N. E. by the parish of Arbuthnott ; 
on the S E. bv the parishes of Benholme and St Cyrus; on the 
S. W. by the parish of Marykirk ; and on. N. W. by the parish 

of Laurencekirk. . 

Tonographical Appearances.- k considerable portion of thispa- 
rish consists of a large hollow plain, containing about 3500 impe- 
rial acres. This hollow plain or basin,— situated nearly m th o 



OARVOCK. 



23 



centre of the parish, is surrounded by rising grounds, on all sides, 
except a narrow opening towards S. E., where tlie romantic ravine 
of Den Fennel takes its rise, and by which the Howe of Garvock 
sends its superfluous waters to the German Ocean, through the 
parish of St Cyrus. The rest of the parish, immediately surround- 
ing this basin, is considerably but gently undulated. A very little 
beyond this basin, the ground declines gently toward N. E. ; and 
on this side of the parish, there are two dens or ravines, through 
which two small streams run into the water of Bervie ; but these 
streams are nearly dry for some time in summer. One of these 
ravines, called Den of Davo, or Woodburn Den, is of considerable 
depth and romantic appearance in some places, and part of it has 
been, in good taste, planted by Alexander Wood, Esq. on whose 
property it lies. 

There is one continued range of hill, partially covered with 
heath, which runs along the N. W. side of the whole parish, rising 
gently at the east end of the parish, and ending abruptly at the 
west end— called the Hill of Garvock, the altitude of which is up- 
wards of 750 feet ; and the lowest part of the parish is about 250 
feet above the level of the sea. This hill rises gently from the 
basin already mentioned ; but descends rather rapidly on the op- 
posite side, forming about a mile of pretty steep ascent from the 
Howe of the Mearns. It is the highest point of land on the east 
coast of Scotland, within three miles of the sea. About three- 
fourths of the parish lie on the S. E. side ; and one-fourth on the 
N. W. side of this hill. 

From the top of the hill of Garvock, the spectator has spread out 
before him, it is believed, a more extensive, delightful, and splen- 
did view, than is to be seen anywhere else in Scotland. From 
this he sees at once a considerable portion of the great valley of 
Strathmore, which runs nearly the whole breadth of Scotland, par- 
ticularly the eastern part of it, always distinguished by the name 
of the Howe of the Mearns. The whole charming and beautiful- 
ly cultivated vale of the Howe of the Mearns — about 16 miles long, 
by nearly 6 where broadest — extending through the parishes of 
Glenbervie, part of Arbuthnott, the whole of Fordoun, Laurence- 
kirk, Marykirk, and Fettercairn, studded with mansion-hpuses, vil- 
lages, fruitful fields, and thriving plantations, lies like an illumi- 
nated map at the feet of the spectator. What adds to the rich and 



 This Den takes its name from having been tlie retreat of Fcnella, after ihc mur.

KINCARDINESHIRE. 



picturesque appearance of a part of this vale is, that about forty 
years ago, James Macdonald, Esq. then factor for the property of 
the Earl of Kintore, which is pretty extensive in this quarter, at 
the renewal of every lease, set apart a quarter or half an acre close 
by the farm-stead, which he planted with hard-wood, larch, or 
spruce, most of which succeeded, and are now grown up. 

From this station, it is pleasant to see the extensive inroads 
which cultivation has made, on the steep and barren territories of 
the little prince of Garvock on the one side, and on those of the 
Grampian sovereigns on the other. Besides the extent, beauty, and 
variety of the landscape presented to the view of the spectator, 
many places famous in the history of our land, or rendered remark- 
able from their having been the residence of celebrated indivi- 
duals, may be seen from a single staition on this hill. The follow- 
ing are a few of the more noted and prominent : From north-east 
to south-west, the visible horizon is bounded by the dark and heath- 
covered Grampians, towering over one another like rival sovereigns 
of the wilderness. Along' this line, beginning from north, the 
most conspicuous points and their elevations, are Cairnmanearn, 
1020 feet ; Kerloak, 1S90 feet ; Cloachnahein, 2370 feet ; on 
the very top of this last, stands a huge rock, between 80 and 100 
feet high, appearing at ten or twelve miles' distance like a ruined 
fortress ; Mount Battock, 3465 feet ; on the top of this, the three 
counties of Aberdeen, Kincardine, and Forfar, meet; Mount Keen, 
3010 feet; Lochnagair, 3800 feet, sixty miles distant in Aberdeen- 
shire, whose elevated locks are more or less trimmed with snow, even 
in the summer months. From Lochnagair, the German Ocean, from 
the Frith of Forth to the Murray Frith, may be seen. In the fore- 
ground of these, you see Strath Fennella Hill ; Cairn o' Mount 
and Caterthun in Angus-shire. This last is crowned with a vast 
circle of stones, inclosing nearly two acres, the ruins of a fortress 
or camp, the work of the days of other years, and which serves as 
a kind of weather-glass to the people in the Howe of the Mearns, 
from the colour it assumes from the reflecting clouds. Farther on, 
you observe the dark-blue mountains of Angus and Perth grouped 
together like the swelling waves of the ocean, till, with the lofty 
top of Benlomond, you lose them in the far-distant sky. 

Turning your eye again towards the north, and lowering it to 
the vale, you see more cheerful objects. The first I shall men- 
tion is Falside, the mansion-house of a small property belonging 
to General Forbes, about four miles from Stonehaven. Straight 



GARVOCK. 



25 



from this, through the middle of the vale, westward, you see just 
the tops of the trees at the village of Drumllthie, belonging to 

Gordon Esq. of Avochie ; Monboddo, the seat of Captain 

Eurnet. Here was born his grandfather, the celebrated Lord Mon- 
boddo. Redhall, the seat of Carnegie of Pitarrow, where stood 
the mansion-house, in which the amiable, learned, and pious 
George Wishart was born ; who, for his pious exertions in pro- 
moting the Reformation, was treacherously seized, and dragged 
to the stake, at St Andrews, by the cruel and licentious Cardinal 
Beaton in 1546. The old wood of Halkerton, where lonsf stood 
the mansion-house of the Barons Falconer, the ancestors of the 
present Earl of Kintore. They took the sirname of Falconer, 
from their ancestors having had the charge of the hawks and 
falcons of King William the Lion, about 1200; hence, too, the 
name Hawkerstown, contracted now into Halkerton, Thornton 
Castle, the seat of the Rev. Dr Crombie. Upwards of a century 
ago, this belonged to the Strachans, and from it Admiral Sir R. 
Strachan took his title. 

Raising now your eye towards the east end of Strath Ferinella 
Hill, you have a partial view of the village of Auchinblae, belong- 
ing to the Earl of Kintore ; and of Fordoun, the Presbytery seat, 
with its handsome and cathedral-looking church. This is the 
birth-place of John of Fordoun, the father of Scottish history, and 
author of the Scotichronicon. It was also the residence of St Pal- 
ladius, the opponent of the Pelagian heresy, and his chapel, which 
still stands in the churchyard, was, in the days of Popery, the resort 
of numerous pilgrims. In a western direction, along the foot of 
the Grampians, you see Phesdo, a handsome seat of Dr Crom- 
bie— the site of the castle and capital of Kincardineshire, where 
not only the Sheriff-court was held, till removed to Stonehaven 
by James VL, but the royal court was sometimes held, about 
600 years ago. It was here where Baliol surrendered to Edward L 
in 1296; and the farm on which this now "deserted village" 
lies, is called Castletown of Kincardine. The princely mansion of 
Fasque, long the seat of the Baronets of Balmain, now the seat of 

Gladstone, Esq. A little below this you see the woods which 

conceal Fettercairn House, the seat of Sir J. Forbes. And hard 
by stand the village and church of Fettercairn. Somewhere here 
It was, according to Buchanan, that Fenella, daughter of the Thane 
of Angus, had her delightfully situated castle, in which she m 
dered Keneth III. as he was passing on a pilgrimage to the shr

KINCAUDINESIIIRE. 



of Palladius at Fordoun in 994, Near this village you see the 
small property of Balnakettle, belonging to Lord Arbuthnott, 
where on a certain field much native iron has been found, of which 
not only coarse articles, but also knives and razors have been ma- 
nufactured. It still, however, remains an unsolved problem, how 
the iron came there. The apparently neat and ancient mansion 
of Balbegno, the property of the Honourable D. Ogilvie of Clova. 
Beyond this you see the thriving woods surrounding the splendid 
mansion of the Burn, built by Lord Adam Gordon, who in 1780 
purchased the property, consisting of 300 acres, for L. 300, the 
whole rental of which was then only L. 5, 11. Ud. and high 
enough, being one continued barren surface of rock, gravel, and 
heath, without the vestige of a tree or shrub within its boundaries. 
But with such skill, rapidity, and success, did his Lordship culti- 
vate and improve, that one of the rooms in the house of the Burn, 
was, in 1804, floored with larch which he had planted, on this bar- 
ren spot, 1782. And now the whole has become an Arcadian 
grove. From this, descending along the bank of the North 
Esk, the boundary between Angus and Mearns, you see the 
woods of Arnhall, the property of Shand, Esq. who is like- 

wise proprietor of the Burn : the extensive woods of Liglismal- 
die, where stands an ancient mansion, a seat of the Earl of Kintore, 
long inhabited by his ancestor, Baron Falconer of Halkerton. 
Here you see the North Esk in his silvery stream beautifully 
meandering towards the German Ocean. 

Moving your eye now towards your own station, you see just 
below you the neat village and burgh of barony, Laurencekirk, 
which was begun by Lord Gardenston in 1 765, and has now a 
population of 1391. It is beautifully surrounded by plantations 
and numerous hedge-rows. From it, about half-way up to your 
station, stands the handsome mansion of Johnston Lodge, the 
seat of A. Gibbon, Esq., to whom the village and surrounding lands 
belong. 

Now reversing your position, and directing your eye towards 
the north-east, you see beyond this parish, the gently undulating 
hills of the parish of Arbuthnott. The first mansion there which 

catches your eye is Kair, the seat of Kinloch, Esq. From 

it, straight towards the sea, you have a partial view of Arbuthnott 
House, the seat of the Right Honourable Viscount Arbuthnott, 
'the very patriotic Lord Lieutenant and chief Sheriff of Kincar- 
dineshire. Immediately below this, you see the high point of 



GAUVOCK.

land called Bervie Brow or Craig David, commonly pronounced 
Craig-evie, said to derive its name from its being the place where 
David II. with his Queen landed from France to reclaim the 
Scottish crown in 1341. Its elevation is 421 feet, and is a land- 
mark from sea in this quarter. 

From this, directing your eye along the coast toward the south, 
you have a partial view of Benholme House, the seat of the late 
R. Scott, Esq. A little below this is very conspicuous the farm- 
steading of Knox, the property of Fitzmorice, Esq. ; the 

neat church of Benholme ; the neat farm-steading of Stone of 
Benholme, the property of J. Scott, Esq. of Brotherton. Then 
the rising ground between Garvock and Benholme covers the 
coast side till you come to the village and neat-spired church of 
St Cyrus. The first object in Angus-shire is the town and royal 
burgh of Montrose, with its spacious bay at the mouth of the 
South Esk. On the other side of this river, you see the church 
of Craig, surrounded by a finely cultivated country, beautified 
with plantations and numerous hedge-rows, for several miles up the 
right bank towards Breehin. Next, along the coast, you see Lu- " 
nan-Bay, the Red-Head, Bell-Rock tower. Isle of May, the Bass 
in the mouth of the Frith of Forth, North Berwick- Law in East 
Lothian, Lammermuir- Hills, St Abb's Head in Berwickshire, and 
the Cheviot- Hills in Northumberland. All these, with a very 
few exceptions, may be seen from one station, — the Tower of 
Johnston. 

Along the top of the hill of Garvock, where it is of some 
breadth, there are several alternate ridges and valleys, the paral- 
lelism of which, from one end of the hill to the other, perhaps, 
mark,s the diluvial current. The direction of these, likewise, ex- 
actly corresponds with that indicated in other parts of Scotland, be- 
ing from north-east to south-west. 

Climate. — Garvock had long the misfortune to be reckoned the 
native land of fogs, and mists, and rains, and, consequently, the 
most inhospitable spot of the whole surrounding district. Its un- 
cultivated surfece being spongy, had a strong tendency to retain 
the water which fell upon it ; and its impervious subsoil prevented 
the water from sinking; so that having no open ditches nor water- 
courses, a constant evaporation was going on, and consequently 
there was a constant state of cold and humid atmosphere, with fre- 
quent rains, which never failed to bring with them their conco 
mitant diseases, particularly ague, from which very few had the 



28

good fortune to escape. To these were frequently added the chil- 
ling haars from the German Ocean. 

The appearance, which these aqueous meteors put on, is 
sometimes pleasing and even sublime. Grand majestic banks of 
fog, particularly in harvest, a little before sunrise, appear movmg 
slowly along the Hill of Garvock, or passing it from the east, are 
seen stretching in a vast and beautiful level plain, from Garvock 
all the wav to the Grampians, completely concealing from the 
view the whole Howe of the Mearns, while the tops of the moun- 
tains alone are visible, and appear like numerous islands scattered 
over a smooth and silvery sea. But the first rays of the sun have 
scarcely touched this delusive ocean, when, as if charmed by the 
magician's wand, the whole scene suddenly disappears, and a new 
and no less splendid vision occupies its place, — the rich and luxu- 
riant valley of the Mearns  

But the dark, cold, wet, and dreary days, which were formerly 
almost the constant portion of Garvock, have now in a good mea- 
sure passed away. Its cUmate, indeed, is still often cold and moist, 
but within the last forty, nay, within the last twenty, years, it has 
been wonderfully meliorated, by draining and the reclaiming of 
waste land. 

Hydrography. — There are many perennial springs in this parish 
of excellent, cool, and transparent water, generally springing from 
sandstone rocks. Several of these spring not from the bottom, but 
drip from the face of the rock, particularly an excellent one close 
by the manse, called St James' well, which supplies the family with 
plenty of pure and excellent water, both summer and winter. There 
is a spring near the bottom of the hill of Garvock, on the north- 
west side, possessed of mineral quahties, and which has of late years 
been taken notice of by several persons in the neighbourhood, as 
beneficial to those affected with scorbutic and gravel complaints. 
It has never yet been chemically examined ; but, as it seems to be 
pretty strongly impregnated with some mineral substance, it may 
eventually turn out to be valuable. 

The only river connected with this parish is Bervie Water, 
which forms part of the north-east boundary. It rises in the pa- 
rish of Glenbervie ; and after a winding course of about sixteen 
miles, passing the mansions of Glenbervie, Whiteriggs, Arbuth- 
nott, and Allardice, it falls into the sea at Bervie. It is an excel- 
lent trouting stream, and has a small salmon-fishing at its mouth. 

Geology.— ooks of regularly stratified red and gray coloured 



GARVOCK. 29 

sandstone seem to run the whole length of the joarish ; — the di- 
rection south-west and dip north-west at various angles from near- 
ly a horizontal position to 20°. The strata are of various thick- 
ness to upwards of twenty feet ; and alternate, when seen near the 
surface, with pudding-stone or conglomerate. This sandstone, 
where most uniform in structure, often contains small rounded 
blocks of foreign rocks, as granite, jasper, &amp;c. In some places, 
the strata near the surface are soft, and when exposed to the air 
soon moulder into sand ; but where in contact with conglomerate, 
- they are very hard. Over the surface of these rocks, where they 
present an upright face, is seen a covering of scurdy or unstratified 
trap, which, by long exposure to the air, has a friable appearance. 
The highest points in the parish are generally covered with this. 
In the valleys, strata of hard gravel are found of great thickness. 
Over almost the whole parish, are found water-worn or rolled blocks 
of granite, quartz, jasper, &amp;c. in such abundance, as that when a 
few inches of the surface are removed for the first time, the ground 
seems actually paved with them. Boulder stones of granite or 
gneiss, &amp;c. occur in several places, but none above three feet in dia- 
meter. Masses of mica slate, containing garnets, are met with, 
but rarely. There is a considerable bed of limestone in the south- 
west corner of the parish, in the steep face of the Hill of Gar- 
vock, which seems to run into the parish of Marykirk, where it 
again appears at a short distance, and just opposite. The part in 
this parish was wrought some years ago ; but, on account of the 
steep and difficult access, and the stone being found to contain a 
considerable quantity of sand, it has been discontinued. A quarry 
of excellent building red sandstone has been occasionally wrought 
in the north-east end of the parish, in the Den of Davo ; and a 
stratum equally good, if not superior, was discovered about four 
years ago near the top and centre of the Hill of Garvock, but 
being found only about five feet in thickness, and dipping imme- 
diately under the hill, it has for some time been discontinued, on 
account of the expense in tirring. 

Peat-Moss.— In this parish, there had formerly been several 
mosses, from which peats and sods had been cut ; and several 
tenants from neighbouring parishes had a right, from their pro- 
prietor being an heritor of Garvock, of coming for peats and sods. 
These are now almost all entirely exhausted except one, and even 
on It, the plough has made, and is still making, great encroach- 
ments. Some of the others are already converted into corn-land, 



30 



KINCARDINESHIRE. 



and one tenant occasionally opens a pit in his corn land to cut out 
peats from some small pari of a remaining bank. 

Soil— The lower grounds frequently appear to be conjposedof 
alluvial deposits, where several thin strata of sand and gravel, often 
considerably mixed with loamy clay, are found over a stratum of 
moss; in which last there are commonly abundant remains of 
wood, which is likewise sometimes found imbedded in the higher 
grounds. The soils are generally, on the higher grounds, light 
and gravelly, or sandy ; on the lower, loamy ; but all originally 
very moist, abounding in rushes and sprots, till drains are open- 
ed ; for the filling of which, there is everywhere plenty of excel- 
lent material,— water-worn stones, of which every reclaimed field 
annually yields a plentiful crop for many years,— which, although 
sometimes a little troublesome, is indeed one of the advantages of 
Garvock, for without the aid of these stones, its naturally wet and 
cold surface would remain a waste and barren spot, whereas, by 
the judicious use of these, it can be rendered a kindly and very 
productive soil ; so that before it be fully drained, the shrewd 
saying of an old tenant here will probably be found quite correct, 
" there is not a useless bowl in Garvock." 

Zoolonv.-Undev this branch, there is nothing very particular 
to remark. It may suffice, therefore, to mention a few of our 
rarer species of quadrupeds and birds. Tradition says that this pa- 
rish formerly abounded in deer. But after it was stripped of its 
natural wood, with which it then was covered, deer have been ba- 
nished for many generations. Of late, however, since our planta- 
tions began to raise their heads and afford some cover, Cervus ca- 
preolus, the roe, has visited his former place of abode, and made 
his appearance again in Garvock. Canis vulpes, the fox, and Mns- 
tela putorius, the polecat or fumart, have nearly disappeared. 
Mustela vulgaris, the weasel, is often seen, and Erinaceus Eu7-opcBUS, 
the hedgehog, is sometimes to be met with. Lepus timidus, the 
hare, by our absurd game laws, has become very destructive to our 
voung wheat and turnip fields. Lepus cuniculus, the rabbit, a still 
Lre destructive nuisance to our corn fields, where it commits ter- 
rible havoc, is fast multiplying on the borders of the parish 

During the severe winter of 1823, several specimens of Tetrao 
laqopus I ptarmigan, were seen here. This bird is rare even in 
fe alpine egions of Braemar. Tetrao tetrlr, the black grous, is 
0 be met with in the wopds of Johnston. Tetrao Scotcus, or moor- 
fowl, was, till lately, to be seen here. Three or four coveys oi fa-

milies of these used to be hatched annually on the eastern part of 
• the Hill of Garvopk. But about two years ago, some blood-thirsty 
sportsmen persecuted them, with such persevering cruelty, that 
they ceased not till the last individual was brought down. Vanellus 
a'istatus, the lapwing or twet, and Vanellus griseus, the grey plover, 
are still numerous, but much reduced in number, particularly the 
lapwing, by our increase of cultivation. Scohpax Gallinago, the 
common snipe, of two varieties, is more numerous here than in any 
surrounding parishes. Emberiza nivalis, the snow-bunting or snow- 
flake, and Sturnus vulgaris, the starling, are occasional visitors. 

When Garvock was a forest, as tradition relates, no doubt her 
woods abounded with singing birds ; but when denuded of her na- 
tural wood, during her bare and barren and uncultivated state, all 
the feathered songsters, except the linnet and the lark, were long 
banished from her soil. But now, since a few plantations have be- 
gun to afford shelter and cover, many of the songsters of the grove 
have returned ; such as Turdus musiciis, the thrush ; Turdus me- 
rula, the blackbird ; Motacilla rubecula, the redbreast. And the 
little wood, which a former and the present incumbent have plant- 
ed about the manse, has procured for its inhabitants, the pleasure of 
hearing the song of the mavis and the blackbird in their season, and 
the more slender, but sweet and melodious pipe of little robin, in 
the fall of the year; so that they can now join with Milton and 
say with delight, 

" Sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet, 
With charm of earliest birds." 

Fringilla ccelebs, the chaffinch, is numerous ; Motacilla troglodytes, 
the wren, is frequently to be met with. Coliimha palumbus, the 
ring-dove or wood-pigeon, is frequently heard cooing close by the 
manse. One solitary pair of Corvus pica, the magpie, have resided 
close by the manse for the last twelve years, during all which time 
the only overt acts of felony proved against them are, that during 
their nursing season, when the hen-house door was left open, they 
sometimes stept in and helped themselves to an egg. And once 
they killed a httle chicken, of that species which go almost quite 
naked for several weeks, looking very like raw flesh, and very 
temptmg to a carnivorous propensity. One year, when some rude 
boys had repeatedly annoyed them in the wood, they came and 
built m a thorn tree, the remains of an old hedge, little more than 
twenty yards from the manse door; and brought up their family as 
usual. Every year about the beginning of winter, thev send off

their young family to colonize some other quarter, and remani 
themselves a solitary pair as before. 

Botani/.—\Jndev this head, only a few of our rarer plants shall 
be mentioned. Parnassia pnlustris, grass of Parnassus ; Trollius 
Europmis, lucken gowan ; Asphodelus, king's spear. These three 
adorn the sloping sides of the Hill of Garvock, here and there, 
in beautiful patches. The first by its neat, large, and delightful, 
white and striated cup; the second, by its beautiful large and yel- 
low nodding globe ; and the third, by its handsome spike of golden- 
coloured flowers. The following hkewise are found in a few places : 
Drosera rotundifolia, sun-dew ; Digitalis purpurea, foxglove ; 
Jne7none nemorosa, wood anemone ; Geraniinn sanguineum, bloody 
crane's bill ; Genista anglica, carhn's spurs ; Hypericum pukhrum, 
St John's wort ; Antirrhinum repens, creeping toad-flax ; Iris pseu- 
dacorus, yellow flag ; Geum rivale, herb Bennet ; Trifolium pra- 
tense and repeiis, red and white trefoil. This is supposed to im- 
part that pecuhar richness of flavour, for which Garvock butter is 
noted, although Garvock cheese has no favourable character. All 
that remains olf its natural wood, now to be found growing in the pa- 
rish, consists in a few stunted hazels, sloes, and willows in two or 
three places. The small extent of wood hitherto planted in the pa- 
rish, consists principally of larch, spruce, and Scots firs, although 
the few trees of hard-wood, as ash, beech, and plane, which have 
been occasionally planted in the lower grounds, seem to thrive pret- 
ty well. Of the firs, the spruce seems to thrive best ; mdeed, the 
Scots fir, and particularly the larch, very often fail here, owing, 
perhaps, to one or more of three causes,— want of shelter, too much 
moisture, or, in shallow ground, the roots being cankered by salt 
of iron. Slight draining may cure the second, and trenching or mak- 
ing pretty large pits, and exposing the soil for six or twelve months 
before planting, may cure the last. 

11. — Civil History. 
Uniform- tradition says, that this parish was a forest or huntmg- 
park, and part of the wide extended property of Earl Marischal, 
of whom it is said, that he could travel from Berwick to John- 
o' Groat's, breakfast and dine every day, and sup and sleep every

night, on his own property ; and that about the place where the 
church now stands, he had a small house for his accommodation, 
when hunting. That the Keith family had been some way con- 
nected with this parish, appears probable fi-om this, that at the 
east end of the old church, within, was erected a funeral monu- 
ment, at the bottom of which are the initials and date R. 1666, K. ; 
above this, is a shield or coat-of-arms, surmounted by a crest, being 
a hand holding a burning torch, over which is a motto usta, but 
the second word is defaced. Over this, is the date 1679, sur- 
mounted by a cherub. The stones composing this monument have 
been built into the east gable wall of the new church, but so 
absurdly as to be above the ceiling. It is highly probable that this 
pointed out the burying-ground of some branch of the Keith or 
Marischal family, whose honours and lands were forfeited in 1715 
only. Whether all the land of Garvock ever belonged to the fa- 
mily of Arbuthnott, the writer is not certain ; but it is certain from 
Crawford's Peerage, that Hugh Arbuthenoth, Le Blond, Laird of 
Arbuthnott, in 1282, bestowed the patronage of Garvock on the 
Abbey of Arbroath, "for the safety of his soul," which patronage, 
with many others, in consequence of the Reformation, fell into 
the hands of the King. The particulars of the gift are these : — 
" To the Abbot and Convent of Aberbrothock, in pure and perpe- 
tual alms of one oxengate of land, lying adjacent to the church of 
Garvock, with the right of patronage of the said church, and pas- 
turage for 100 sheep, 4 horses, 10 oxen, and 20 cows— Aberbro- 
thock, 4to nonas Aug. 1282." 

Land-owners. — The whole property of the parish is divided 
among eight heritors, which are, according to their valued rents, 
The Earl of Kintore ; R. Taylor, Esq. of Kirktonhill ; J. Scott, 
Esq. of Brotherton; Dr Badenach, Esq. of Arthurhouse ; Alex- 
ander Wood, Esq. of Davo or Woodburnden ; Alexander Forrest, 
Esq. of Tullochs ; Viscount Arbuthnott ; and Alexander Gibbon, 
Esq. of Johnston. 

Parochial Registers.— It appears from a minute of session, July 
22, 1743, that when the Rev. Mr Muirson resigned his charge to 
his assistant and successor, Mr Smith, he gave up a register of 
the time of his predecessor, Mr Milne, declaring that he never 
saw any register of the time of Mr Auchterlaunie ; that he likewise-- 
gave up three volumes of register of his own time. But, owing to 
the carelessness of succeeding clerks, or their bad accommodation, 
the greater part of these are now lost, and the oldest fragments 
which remain are dated 1717. At that time, they seem to have been

written in a neat old hand, accurately kept, and strict discipline 
observed. No separate cash-book was used till February 1762 ; 
but collections and disbursements were entered in words at length 
on the same page with minutes, and accounts kept in Scottish mo- 
ney till January 5, 1772.  . 

Antiquities.— That Garvock had, at a former period, been a 
forest or hunting-park well stocked with deer, as tradition has con- 
stantly handed down, appears highly probable ; for the remains of 
a substantial fence along the north-west side of the parish, called 
the Deer-dyke, are well remembered by old people ; although they 
have now nearly all disappeared under the plough. 

In a hollow on the east side of the parish, is said to be the place 
where the sheriff was boiled. The tradition is this, and affords a 
sad specimen of the barbarity of the times of James I., about 1420. 
Melville, the laird of Glenbervie, and sheriff of the Mearns, had, 
by a strict exercise of his authority, rendered himself obnoxious to 
the surrounding barons, who having teased the King by repeated 
■ complaints against him,— at last, in a fit of impalience, the King 
said to Barclay, laird of Mathers, who had come with another com- 
plaint, " Sorroic gin that sheriff were sodden and supped in brie." — 
« As your Majesty pleases," said Barclay, and immediately with- 
drew—went and assembled his neighbours, the lairds of Lauriston, 
Arbuthnott, Pitarrow, and Halkerton— appointed a great hunting 
match in the forest of Garvock, to which they kindly invited the 
devoted Melville. And having privately got ready a large kettle 
of boiling water in a retired place, they decoyed unsuspect-

ing Melville to the fatal spot, knocked him down, stripped him, 
and threw him into the boiling kettle. And after he was boiled 
or sodden for some time, they took each a spoonful of the soup. To 
screen himself from royal justice, Barclay built that fortress in the 
parish of St Cyrus, called the Kaim- of Mathers, on a perpendi- 
cular and peninsular rock, sixty feet above the sea, where, in those 
days, he lived quite secure. The laird of Arbuthnott claimed and 
obtained the benefit of the law of clan Macduff, which, in case of 
homicide, allowed a pardon to any one within the ninth degree of 
kindred to Macduff, Thane of Fife, who should flee to his cross, 
which then stood near Lindores, on the march between Fife and 
Strathern, and pay a fine. The pardon is still extant in Arbuth- 
nott House. On the fate of the other conspirators, the voice of 
tradition has died away. The field, where this horrid deed hap- 
pened, still retains the name of Brownie's Leys ; because from the 
murderous deed then perpetrated, it was long supposed to be 
haunted by the sprites called Brownies. 

On the summit of the Hill of Garvock, there are two large 
cairns, the relics of Druidism, about a mile asunder. The larger 
is fifty yards in diameter, and must have been a magnificent struc- 
ture in its day. It had been carefully surrounded by a ring of 
large blocks of freestone, which are now covered by the stones of 
the cairn falling down and over them. On these, the Druids or 
heathen priests lighted great fires at certain seasons, in honour of 
their god Beil, the sun, the same as the Scripture Baal ; and 
whom they worshipped likewise, in groves, as well as on these high 
places, just as did the idolatrous Moabites, Philistines, Canaan- 
ites, and Chaldeans j and into this sin the children of Israel often 
fell, Judges c. ii. v. 11 and 13, and c. iii. v. 7, and c. x. v. 6. These 
fires were lighted and assemblies held at the cairns, both for reli- 
gious and judicial purposes; for the Druids Csar, 1. 6. c. xiii. 
were the supreme judges in all matters, civil as well as religious, 
allowing supremacy to the king or chief only in trifles and outward 
show, as permitting him to have seven colours in his mantle, while 
they used only six, but allowed only four to the nobility. These 
fires were lighted particularly on their two great festivals. The 
first was La Beiltin, the day of Beil's fire, i. e. the 1st of May 
the begmnmg of their year, when great rejoicings were held for 
the return of the new year, and to implore a blessing on the pro- 
duce of the year. Among other ceremonies, putting part of a mix 
ture of meal, milk, and eggs, &amp;c. on a piece of bread, they threw 
It over the left shoulder, saying each time, « This is to you, O mists

and storms, spare our pastures and our corn ; this is to thee, O 
eagle, spare our lambs and our kids ; this is to you, O fox and fal- 
con, spare our poultry," &amp;c. The second was LaSamh'in, the day of 
the fire of peace, i. e. the 1st of November. This was the most 
solemn of all their festivals, vhen the Druids Caesar, 1. 6. c. xiii. 
met at the most centrical cairn to hold rejoicing for finishing the 
harvest, and to maintain the peace by adjusting every dispute and 
deciding every controversy. Then, too, all were obliged to ex- 
tinguish their fires on the preceding evening, and come for a sup- 
ply of the consecrated fire on the cairn. But of this, no person who 
had failed in duty, could obtain any share, till he had made every 
' reparation required by the Druids. If he was refractory, the sen- 
tence of excommunication was pronounced against him, which was 
worse than death. None durst afford him shelter, or fire, or food, 
or any office of humanity, under pain of the same sentence being 
passed upon themselves. Here the Druids showed their wisdom 
or cunning, in fixingtheir assizes to this season, when every man's own 
feehngs prompted him to submission ; and this secured their power 
and the public peace, better than all our modern courts of justice. 

On these two occasions, the Druids offered bloody sacrifices, and 
that their victims consisted not only of beasts but of men, is clear 
from Caesar, 1. 6, c. xvi., Tacitus, Annal. 1. 14, c. v., and Pliny, 
Nat. Hist. 1. 30, c. i. Two fires being kindled from one another, 
says Toland, the men and beasts to be sacrificed were made to 
pass between these fires, by way of consecration. Hence the Gae- 
lic proverb,— the jeopardy of Beil, or between Bed's two fires, i. e. 
the most dreadful danger, from which escape would be miraculous. 
Hence our bonfires, &amp;c. at May- day and Halloweven. Hence, 
too, our rejoicing at harvest home, as in many places of Scotland 
called the Mm, a corruption of cairn. Sometimes it is called 
Clayock, a corruption of Cailoch, the Gaelic of carlin ov old wife. 

Bloody sacrifices had their origin from Divine appointment, im- 
mediately after the fall, as a memorial of sin, and a type of that all- 
sufficient sacrifice of the Cross, which was to do it away. And the 
covering which God gave to our first parents, taken from their vic- 
tims slain in sacrifice, was a striking emblem of that righteousness 
to be wrought out by Christ, which would cover the moral naked- 
ness of every true penitent. But although the fear of punishment 
from a sense of sin remained, yet fallen and depraved nature soon 
corrupted this solemn and expressive rite by the most shockmg 
crimes. Indeed, history proves that almost every nation under 
Heaven, in their uncivilized state, at one time ofi'ered human sacri- 



GARVOCK.

fices. So common was the practice among the surrounding na- 
tions, that God's chosen people, although warned and strictly pro- 
hibited, Deut. c. xviii. v. 9, 10, yet were ensnared and often join- 
ed in this shocking crime, Psal. cvi. v. 37, 38. 

The only names for Whitsunday and Halloweven in Gaelic, 
are La Beiltin and La Samli'in ; nay the writer of this has repeat- 
edly heard old people, even in the Mearns, use the name Beiltin 
for Whitsunday, quite ignorant of its meaning or origin. 

On the larger of the two cairns mentioned above, the late J. Far- 
quhar, Esq. of Johnston, on whose property itlies,erecteda neat hol- 
low tower of substantial mason-work, about thirty feet high, with a 
winding stair inside to the top, from which there is a most exten- 
sive and charming view. 

About seven years ago, there was a cairn on a knap or knoll in 
the lower part of the parish, on the farm of Upper Tulloch, from 
time immemorial called the Priest's Cairn. In the progress of Gar- 
vock improvements, this cairn was converted into road metal, and 
a distinct Druidical circle, consisting of twelve large stones, was 
found under it, and within the circle a stone coffin, composed of 
slabs of freestone, not deposited in a pit or grave, but simply set 
upon the surface of the ground and covered by the cairn. In the 
coffin, nothing was found but unctuous black earth, and four little 
white substances exactly resembling human teeth, but so soft as to 
write on a slate like pencil. It is not easy now to conjecture why the 
circle contained a coffin and was covered by a cairn, for a circle of 
upright stones, consisting of seven, twelve, or nineteen, referring to 
the days of the week, the months in the year, or the cycle of the 
moon, with all which the Druids were acquainted, Caesar, 1. 6. c. 
14, was the ordinary place of Druidical worship, as the cairn was 
on more solemn occasions. The circle or common Druidical 
temple was erected in a grove, commonly of oaks. The cairn 
was erected on high places. Indeed, it is clear from Scripture, 
the best of all evidences, that these or something like these were 
the plain and simple places of worship in the earliest ages. In 
Gen. xxviii. 18, you find Jacob set up a pillar as a place of wor- 
ship at Bethel. In Exod. xxiv. 4, you find Moses, before he had 
received any command concerning the tabernacle, which was af- 
terwards the place of worship, built an altar and surrounded it 
with twelve stone pillars ; and during the separation of the ark 
and tabernacle in the days of Samuel, Saul, and David, worship 
of the true God in high places was permitted, 2 Chron. i. 3. 
1 Sam. ix. 19. But when these places had been desecrated by 



38 



KINCARDlNESHIRi;. 



the worship of Baal and other idols, and the shocking crime of 
human sacrifices by the Canaanites, the children of Israel were 
commanded to destroy them ; ' Numb, xxxiii. 52. Deut. xii. 2, 3 ; 
to break down their altars and pillars in high places, and to burn 
their groves with fire. 

On the north end of the hill of Garvock, there is another Drui- 
dical cairn on the farm of Sootywells, about the half of which was 
removed some years ago ; but nothing remarkable found. About 
half a mile farther on, there is another of the same kind on the 
farm of Arthurhouse, but much larger, and which in its day had 
been equal in magnificence to the cairn of Johnston. Some years 
ago, about three-fourths of it was removed, and converted into 
metal for the roads. It was then found that, similar to the cairn 
of Johnston, it was surrounded by a ring of large stones set close 
together on edge, from two to three feet high ; but which were 
quite covered by the stones of the cairn falling down and over 
them, so that the cairn extended about four feet beyond the ring, 
which was composed chiefly of blocks of granite. On one side, 
there was found a stone coffin composed of freestone slabs within 
the ring, but quite close to it on the surface, containing nothing 
but a kind of fine impalpable earth. At one place, on the outside 
of the ring, were found among the stones upwards of twenty coins, 
seemingly silver, but many of them so worn or corroded, that the 
workmen broke several of them between their fingers. There was 
one pretty well preserved of Alexander I., dated 1107, and an- 
other of Robert Bruce I. about 1320. They were all given to 
Dr Badenach, the proprietor, who handsomely rewarded the work- 
men. There was likewise found a silver broach of ancient work- 
manship in the cairn. The part of the cairn which Dr Badenach 
caused to be reserved is about 20 feet diameter ; and his tenant, 
Mr Milne, voluntarily gave upwards of half an acre round it, which 
being enclosed and planted adds much to the beauty of the place, 
and will preserve this relic of Druidism untouched to future ge- 
nerations. 

" On the east side of the parish, on the farm of Nether Tul- 
loch, the present tenant, having observed near the bottom of a 
sloping field, which had been long in cultivation before his time, 
three hillocks, forming a triangle whose sides were about 40, 
50, and 60 yards, more gravelly and always yielding a more 
slender crop than the rest, was induced a few years ago to ex- 
amine the cause, and had not gone above two feet deep till he 
came to a stone coffin in each of the hillocks. Each coffin, which 



GARVOCK. 



39 



was about four feet long, two broad and two deep, contained an 
urn of baked red clay standing at the head or west end, containing 
only a little black earth. Two of the coffins contained nothing 
else ; but the third, besides the urn, contained a complete human 
skeleton, with the leg, thigh, and arm-bones, all parallel to the 
spine, the knees having been folded up to the breast on account 
of the shortness of the coffin. Now, as we know that all the 
heathen nations of Europe, the Greeks, Romans, and Celts, 
burned their dead, reserving their ashes in an urn placed in the 
sepulchre, but when converted to Christianity, they abhorred the 
practice and interred the body entire, — is it not probable, that this 
had been the skeleton of a Christian, deposited in the grave and 
coffin of an heathen ancestor  

On the next farm. Forth, about a quarter of a mile distant, 
there was, till a few years ago, a cairn about 12 yards diameter, 
surrounded by a fosse or ditch even then about four feet deep, 
giving it somewhat the appearance of a little fort ; and hence, 
probably, the name of the farm, Forth, a little corrupted. When 
this cairn was removed by the present tenant, a stone coffin was 
found in it composed of slabs of freestone set upon the surface of 
the ground and covered only by the cairn. It contained nothing 
but an urn similar to those found on the neighbouring farm, and 
containing only a little black earth. The site of this cairn, as 
well as that on Upper Tulloch, is now converted into corn land. 
It is worthy of remark, that all the coffins found here, both under 
ground and under cairns, were placed directly east and west, as 
our graves are at the present day. 

Since this parish, in the time of Druidism, had its high places 
so well furnished with sacred cairns, the more solemn places of 
worship, it cannot be doubted, but that it had been equally well 
provided with its circular temples for ordinary worship in sacred 
groves. But they, being quite ready and convenient for building 
stones, have all long since been removed, as the' cairns too in pro- 
cess of time may be. A steep bank or brae on the face of the 
hill of Garvock, about half a mile from the church, from time im- 
memorial, has been called the Galloiobank, probably from being 
the spot where the gallows stood in feudal times, when every baron 
had the power of pot and gallows in his own lands. 

That the Celts or Gael inhabited this part of Scotland is evi- 
dent from the names of many farms in this parish, clearly Gaelic : 
e. g. Davo Tighe-hho the cattle-house; Tulloch Tuilich 
the hillock; Balhagarty  Bal-na-tagart  the priest's town 



40 



KINCARDINESHIRE. 



Culairdo f Cul-ard-dhu J the back of the black height ; Shells, 
f Shealing, a temporary house still common in some parts of the 
Highlands, erected for the dairymaid and herds, when the cows 
were sent to pasture at a distance from the farm-stead for some 
months in summer. Hence the expressive Scottish name for a 
house not very wind nor water tight, a cauld sheil. Indeed, the 
Gaelic language, though long since banished to the Highland 
glens and mountains of the west of Scotland, was the court lan- 
guage in the reign of Malcolm HI. who died 1093, and spoken 
in a parliament held at Ardchattan in the reign of Robert Bruce 
L, who died 1329. 

On the hill of Garvock, close by the stance of the annual fair, 
there is an oblong cairn, neatly surrounded by an edging of turf, 
which, tradition says, marks the graves of two merchants who quar- 
relled, fought and killed one another, and were buried in the spot 
where they fell upwards of a century ago. There are likewise, on 
the very top of this hill, in one or two places, now quite covered 
with heath, small fields which had been under the cultivation of 
the plough, and that for a considerable length of time, the ridges 
being raised high by the old plan of constant gathering. This may, 
however, have been when the lower grounds were covered with wood 
and marshes. 

There is no manufactory in the parish, and only one meal mill, 
which is situated on the water of Bervie, at the N. E. point of the 
parish. 

HI. — Population. 
When this parish was a forest or hunting-park, its population, 
if any, must have been small. The earliest census on record is 
that ascertained by Dr Webster, when preparing his calculations 
for the Widows' Scheme of the Church of Scotland in 1755. From 
that time, the population has stood as follows. 

In the year 1755, the population was 735 
1791, 460 
1801, 468 
1811, 485, 
1821, 430 
1831, 473 

The great decrease of 282 seems to be chiefly owing to two 
causes : Firsts the throwing of two or more small farms into one. 
Secondly, the great farmers banishing their cottars, by taking from 
them their little croft and cow. But the want of these cottars 
is now often felt in the time of turnip-hoeing, and in hay and 
grain harvest, there being no town nor village in this parish ; and 
several farmers again erecting cottages for their married servants,

seems to be one cause of the increasing population for the last for- 
ty years.

From the above, it appears that the female births very conside- 
rably exceed those of the males. This seems contradictory of the 
generally acknowledged fact, that, as men are engaged in more 
hazardous employments -than women. Providence balances this by 
the more numerous births of the former. But this may in some 
measure be accounted for, by the almost constant shifting of mar- 
ried farm-servants. 

The average number of deaths in this parish, for the last seven 
years, is about 3. It is rather a curious fact, that, for the first 
eighteen months after the writer was • settled, there was no grave 
opened in the church-yard of Garvock.

KINCARDINESHIRE. 



This parish can boast of no family of noble blood within its 
boundaries, not even of a residing heritor ; nor is there any dwel- 
ling commonly called a mansion-house in it. The whole eight 
proprietors are each possessed of land of the yearly value of L. 50 
and upwards. 

Character of the People. — In their general character, the people 
are quiet, industrious, and regular in attendance on divine ordinan- 
ces and they pay much more attention to cleanliness and neat- 
ness in their persons and dwellings, than formerly. Although 
there be nothing foolishly showy, yet the outward appearance of 
the congregation, on a Sabbath, forms a striking, pleasing, and re- 
spectable contrast to what it was forty years ago. Now the la- 
bouring classes, both males and females, appear in church as neat- 
ly and respectably dressed, as the laird's or minister's family did 
then. Indeed this is often carried too far. Comparatively few 
young men or women of the labouring classes, while they remain 
unmarried, ever think of saving any part of their wages ; and, 
therefore, enter on house-keeping without any previous provision 
for the probable expenses of their humble establishment. Hence 
that poverty but too generally prevails, which might, in a good 
measure, be prevented, by prudently laying up, in the Savings 
Bank, a small moiety at every term. 

Neither poaching nor smuggling is known among the parish- 
ioners ; but the Hill of Garvock is often infested with poachers 
from other quarters. 

That vile and demoralizing system of banishing male servants 
from the ha' hoard to bothies, or apartments where they must eat 
as well as sleep by themselves, has unfortunately found its way in- 
to this sequestered parish. ■ It may be advantageous in a present 
or economical point of view ; but is most disadvantageous for mo- 
ral, intellectual, and religious improvement. In fact, many of 
them are really hot-beds of irreligion, immorality, and vice ; and, 
consequently, of mischief and ruin not only to the rising genera- 
tion, but to society in general.

Agriculture, — The whole contents of this parish amount to 
8466 imperial acres, which may be classed as follows : —

The little wood which is in the parish, as has been already no- 
ticed, is all planted, and great part of it being yet young, yields 
but little annual income. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of cultivated land through 
the parish is about L. 1 per imperial acre. No cattle or sheep 
grazed in this parish by the season all pasture grass being con 
sumed by the cattle reared and fed by the occupiers of land, ex- 
cept those who hare some extent of hill -pasture, which is com- 
monly let for three or four months from Martinmas to April, for 
sheep from the Grampians, not by the acre, but by the piece, as 
parties can agree, according to the extent and quality of the pas- 
ture. 

Rate of Wages. — The average rate of wages for unmarried ser- 
vants employed in agriculture, by the half-year, is, for a man L. 5, 
10s., for a boy, L. 1, 15s., both summer and winter ; for a woman 
L. 3 in summer, and L. 2 in winter, with victuals, or 2 pecks of 
meal a week for a man, and \ peck for a boy, with one pint of 
sweet milk daily. Married men get L. 6 in money, 6g bolls meal, 
one pint of sweet milk daily, a house and kail-yard for a year. In 
harvest, a man gets L. 2, 10s., a woman L. 2, with bed and board ; 
reapers 3d. or 3d. a threave. But it has become quite common 
now to cut down the crop with the scythe at 10s. per acre. A 
labourer gets Is. 8d. in summer, and Is. 3d. in winter; a woman 
gets 8d. in summer, and 6d. in winter, without victuals ; masons 
2s. in summer, and Is. lOd. in winter; carpenters much the same, 
both without victuals. Such has been the average of wages for 
some time past, but now that manufactures and railroads have 
started so briskly, wages are fast advancing. A plough costs L. 3 ; 
a cart L. 15 ; a pair of harrows L. 2 ; a gang of horse-shoes 3s. 

Live-Stock. — Farm or work-horses are generally bought in the 
west country, but of late years a great part have been reared at 
home. The long-horned cattle, so common formerly, are now 
completely banished, and few are to be seen but the black dodded 
Angus, with a mixture of Aberdeenshire breed. If calves begin to 
show horns, they are cut when about six weeks old, which prevents 
all after-growth. Black, or brown, or branded, are the most esteem- 
ed colours. Indeed, cattle is the staple commodity here, and is 



44 



KlNCAllDINESIlIllK 



equal, perhaps, to fully one-third of all the other produce of the 
farm. Within the last thirty years, much attention has been paid 
to improve the breed, both of horses and cattle ; and towards this, 
agricultural associations have aided much. The convenience of 
sending marketable live-stock to London by steam-vessels is look- 
ed forward to vith much pleasure. No sheep are reared in this 
parish. 

Husbandry. — The convertible system of husbandry is universal- 
ly followed. The four, five, six, and seven shifts are tried, but the 
five and six are the most common, i. e. two years grass, one year 
oats, one year turnips, one year barley with grass seeds ; or two 
years grass, two years oats, one year turnips, one year barley with 
grass seeds. Oats, Chester, and barley, or bear, are the grains com- 
monly raised, and a change of seed every fourth year is found very 
beneficial. Wheat and pease do not generally succeed. Beans are 
beginning to be tried, and seem to do pretty well. A considerable 
breadth of potatoes is now always planted. The purple and the 
speckled, or large American as it is called, are found generally the 
best and most profitable crop. A few partial failures of the pota- 
toe crop have happened within these two years, but not from seed 
raised in the parish. A few tares are commonly sown for green 
fodder for horses and cows, towards the end of the year. 

The agricultural part of operations is, in general, conducted with 
much skill and neatness. Lime, until peace prices with war rents 
took place, was plentifully applied, which in most cases answered 
well, particularly with newly reclaimed land and sown grass, but 
is now much more sparingly used. Bone-dust is becoming gene- 
rally used in part for turnips, which seems to answer pretty well 
with them, but a half dunging is found necessary for the next crop 
with grass seeds. The usual duration of leases is nineteen years. 
The tenant is bound to the rules of good husbandry, but is gene- 
rally allowed to consult his own advantage, unless where some very 
unfair dealing appears. Farm-buildings, with a few exceptions, 
are but very indifferent ; and there are hardly any inclosures in the 
parish, except temporary ones of paling, which have now become 
common, and are found to be more advantageous in every respect, 
than to have the corn eaten, and the cattle constantly driven about 
by a careless and merciless boy. 

An active spirit of improvement has prevailed here particularly for 
the last twenty years, and much waste ground has been reclaimed and 
brouo-ht into full cropping during that time. To some farms, from 



GARVOCK. 



45 



twenty to thirty acres have been added, witliin the last fifteen years, 
by tenants. Two or three farms, being retained for sometime 
in the proprietor's own hand, have been considerably improved ; 
but tenants have done, and are still doing, much. There is ample 
scope for improvement here ; and the want of capital, and of en- 
couragement by proprietors in aiding to drain and lime, are the 
reasons why so much ground, quite capable of profitable improve- 
ment, still lies waste. Viscount Arbuthnott, to whom a small cor- 
ner of this parish belongs, has given good encouragement to his 
tenant ; and it appears not only in the improved face of the farm, 
but in the increased quantity and quality of its produce. 

Produce, — In stating the amount of the raw produce, exactness 
and accuracy can hardly be attained. The utmost to be expected 
is only an approximation. A general view of it may be stated as 
follows, taking the sixth shift as an average :

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Town. — No town nor village in the parish. The near- 
est principal market-town is Montrose, distant from the centre qf 
the parish about eleven miles, to which most of the grain and daii-y 
produce of this parish is carried for sale. But of late, a regular 
grain market has been established at the royal burgh of Bervie, 
distant only about five miles, where a good deal of grain from this 
parish is sold, and frequently shipped at Gourdon, a small fishing 
village near Bervie. 

Means of Communication. — The post-office nearest to this pa- 
rish is Laurencekirk, where a foot-post arrives every morning from 
Montrose, and departs for the same every afternoon. It is distant 
about two and a-half miles from the centre of this parish. The 
access to and through this parish was long difficult, both on ac- 
count of the steepness of its surface and the wetness of its soil, and 
therefore long retarded all improvement. The only roads through 
the parish, about fifty years ago, were literally cart-roads ; the only 
operation of forming they had ever undergone, having been that of 



46 



KINCARDINESHIRE. 



the horses' feet and the cart wheels. But some years ago, two 
commutation roads have been made to intersect the parish breadth- 
ways ; the one coming from the turnpike in the village of Laurence- 
kirk, and the other coming from the same turnpike about four miles 
further east, and both leading down to the coast-side turnpike, 
which has opened up a direct and comparatively easy communica- 
tion between the Howe of the Mearns and the coast side through 
this parish. Besides these, several other cross roads have been 
made through the parish, so that our principal bar to improvement 
has, in a good measure, been removed ; and, to the credit of the 
tenants in Garvock, the surface clearly proves that they have not 
neglected the opportunity afforded them. 

Ecclesiastical State. — Concerning the early history of the church 
of Garvock, tradition is silent. In the churchyard, which contains 
about three-fourths of an acre, the ground in Garvock, when it 
was set apart, not being so valuable as it is now, the oldest grave- 
stone is dated 1643, " In memory of WilHam Greig" a smith, 
" ane famous honest man." The church is nearly centrical. The 
present house was built in 1778, neatly seated, with two galleries, 
and ceiled, and can accommodate about 300 sitters. No seats let, 
the whole, having been divided among the heritors according to 
their valued rents, and by them divided among their tenants. The 
roof has undergone various reparations, and is at present in a pretty 
good state. A stone in the wall, taken from her predecessor, bearing 
the date of 1678, shows that she had stood just one hundred years. 

The manse, although no date on it, is fixed by a traditionary 
story to have been built about 1745. A tenant of the name of 
Strachan in the parish, an Episcopalian, or non-jurant, as they were 
then called, and whose son was bred an Episcopal clergyman, is 
said to have frequently called on the masons then building the 
manse, and interested himself much in the arrangement of the 
workmanship, as thinking himself quite sure, that should the Pre- 
tender, then in the field, prove victorious, this manse would become 
the habitation of his own son. But the battle of CuUoden de- 
termined matters otherwise. The manse and offices have under- 
gone frequent repairs ; the last was in 1822, and they are at present 
in a tolerable good state. 

The glebe contains nearly 6 acres arable, which most conve- 
niently surround the church, manse, and offices on three sides, 
and about 2 acres pasture, which shut up the fourth or north-east 
side. Most of the arable part consists of a good deep black loamy 

4 



GAUVOCK. 



47 



soil. The pasture lies in a den close by, and watered by a small 
stream. A very few ash and plane trees, planted by a former in- 
cumbent about eighty years ago, having been cut down in 1804, 
there was not a tree to be seen within miles of the manse, till the 
next incumbent planted a narrow belt, principally of larch, along 
the north-east side of the pasture, which added much to the shelter 
and beauty of the place. And the present incumbent has freely 
added his mite towards the improvement of the glebe and em- 
bellishment of the place, by planting larch, spruce, and hard-wood 
in the den about the manse and church-yard, which is rendering 
the place a paradise compared to what it was thirty years ago. The 
glebe may be valued at L. 10 yearly. 

Besides the glebe, there is a triangular piece of ground, of about 
two acres in extent, a few hundred yards from the glebe, and sur- 
rounded by land belonging to others, which has been in the pos- 
session of the minister time out of mind, called the Minister's 
Moss. As a moss it was long since exhausted, and laid bare to 
the very bones, and for many years has been of hardly any value 
even as pasture ; but the present incumbent, after putting about 
160 roods of drains into it, has turned it into arable land, and has 
at present an excellent crop of wheat upon it for his first crop. 

The stipend, by last augmentation in 1820, amounts to L. 159, 
2s. 43d. in money ; 19 bolls, 2 firlots, 3 pecks, 3| lippies, meal ; 
3 bolls, 3 firlots, 1 peck, i lippy, bear. Average amount for the 
last seven years about L. 178. The teinds are exhausted. There 
is only one place of worship in the parish. The number of fami- 
lies belonging to the Establishment is 92. One family, consist- 
ing of an old man and his daughter, attend the Berean meeting 
in Laurencekirk. There is one Episcopalian, a female, whose 
husband attends the parish church ; and one man with his wife at- 
tend the Seceding meeting in Johnshaven, but his children were 
sent as young communicants last year to join the Established 
Church,— so that, in the soil of Garvock, dissenterism does not 
thrive. The parish church is generally well attended, considerino- 
the distance of the extremities of the parish ; and the average numt 
ber of communicants is 200. 

Some years ago, there was a small Penny-a-week Association 
in this parish for missions, schools, and tracts, the annual income 
of which never exceeded L. 2, 10s., which was paid to the So- 
ciety for the same purpose in Montrose; but, unfortunately, both 
have dwindled away. ''

Education. — There are two schools in the parish, one parochial 
and the other on chance. In the parochial school, are taught, 
English reading, writing, arithmetic, English grammar, Latin, and 
•mensuration. In the other, are taught, English reading, writing, 
and arithmetic. The parochial schoolmaster's salary is L. 31, with 
allowance for garden, L. 2, 2s. His fees are, for reading, 2s. 6d. ; 
writing, 3s. 6d. ; arithmetic, 4s. ; English grammar, 5s. ; Latin, 
5s. ; and may amount annually to L. 20. He is also session-clerk 
at a salary of L. 2 ; and his perquisites for proclamations, &amp;c. may 
be about L. 3. He has just the legal accommodation of two apart- 
ments, and a separate school- room ; has hitherto been a popular 
teacher, and musters between 50 and 60 at his public examina- 
tions by the presbytery, several of whom are from neighbouring 
parishes. The parochial school is pretty centrical, — about half a 
mile north from the church, and, from its elevated situation, 
serves for a sea-mark. The other school is at the most dis- 
tant point of the parish, so that neither interferes with the other. 
The people in general are quite alive to the benefits of education, 
and send their children to school at an early age. It is believed 
that there is not one in the parish above six years of age who can- 
not read. 

Savings Bank. — A bank for savings, for the benefit of servants, 
labourers, and mechanics, was opened by the minister January 
28th 1831, who remits the deposits to the Dundee Union Bank 
branch Montrose, and draws when required, at his own risk. Any 
sum from Is. to L. 10 is taken in, and interest paid yearly at 
March 31st. But the deposits have not yet reached far above 
L. 100, This is owing to two causes. First, the low rate of in- 
terest, only 3 per cent. Secondly, the improvident habits of young 
unmarried persons, who seldom think of saving a penny of their 
wages. The consequence is, that they begin their house-keeping 
and a life of poverty at the same time ; whereas, were they careful 
to lay up in the savings bank, a small sum at every term, they 
would then, with the blessing of Providence on their future indus- 
try, be prepared to begin their house-keeping in full prospect of 
comparative comfort and happiness. However, several females have 
done well. A httle girl who began, four years ago, with 5s. has now 
L. 5 ; a second has L. 17 ; and a third has L. 35. The different 
balances have been as follows : —

Lihrar7j.—K parish library was instituted in June 1835, which 



GARVOCK. 



49 



consists already of 330 volumes, all purchased, except a few do- 
nations, with the proceeds of a single sermon, which the minis- 
ter published by subscription for that purpose. They consist 
chiefly of religious, but include several good moral and historical 
books. And it is hoped aud earnestly wished, that it may prove a 
great and lasting benefit to the parish. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — About fifteen years ago, the num- 
ber of persons receiving regular aid from the poor's funds was not 
above 2. But the number soon rapidly increased ; so that, four years 
ago, there were no less than 14 on the roll getting regular or occasional 
supply. This arose from two causes. First, old age, sickness, widow- 
hood, and orphanism. Secondly, the rapid disappearance of that 
honest pride and spirit of independence which used to make our 
people struggle hard and long with poverty, before they would ap- 
ply to the kirk-session. The number on the roll is now consider- 
ably reduced by deaths and growing up of orphans. Regular pau- 
pers get from 2s. 6d. to 6s. a month. The whole fund arises from 
three sources. First, church collections, amounting to about L. 12, 
10s. annually; secondly, occasional donations from some of the 
heritors ; and thirdly, from interest of former savings, which two 
last fluctuate, — in all about L. 27 only ; and consequently, as the 
heritors would not all join to keep up our funds, by the pressure of 
late years they have been reduced nearly L. 50. There has been 
as yet no assessment here, and long may it be so ; for although 
the poor must and ought to be supported, yet legal assessments are 
always attended with pernicious and demoralizing effects. They 
have a strong tendency to diminish the industrious habits of the 
lower classes, and to banish from their minds all proper feelings of 
independence, gratitude, and contentment. 

Fairs. — There is only one fair in this parish, held annually in 
July, on the summit of the Hill of Garvock, about half a mile from 
the church, called St James' fair. It was formerly one of the most 
frequented in the county, being a general feeing market; but 
since markets for the sole purpose of feeing were instituted, just 
at the terms of Whitsunday and Martinmas, St James' fair is much 
reduced. It begins on third Tuesday O. S. July, for sheep ; on 
Wednesday for home made linen, which, being now superseded by 
the manufactory, that day is vacant; on Thursday for cattle and 
engaging harvest shearers; on Friday for horses; but little busi- 
ness is now done on that day. The ground on which it stands be-

longs to the Earl of Kintore ; but the custom or duty belongs to 
another. 

Inns and Alehouses. — In this parish, there is not one inn, ale- 
house, or tippling-house of any description ; and long may these 
poisonous pests of society be kept at a distance from Garvock  
Upwards of forty years ago, an attempt was made to introduce this 
nuisance among the quiet and well disposed people of this parish ; 
but such were their temperate habits and good sense, that, after 
foolishly persevering to pay his license for a few years, the man 
was obliged to give it up, without making his pZac/t a babee, as he 
candidly acknowledged. 

Fuel. — For fuel, the people here depend principally on coals, 
which they procure at the ports of Gourdon, Johnshaven, or Mon- 
trose, at from Is. to Is. 2d. per barrel of 9 stones, small coal; and 
at IDs. per boll of 72 stones, great coal; to which the expense of 
carriage is to be added. Turf cut on the hill, peats and sods cut 
in what moss yet remains, form a considerable part still of the la- 
bourer's fuel. The tenants on Lord Kintore's property have a 
right to cut peats and turfs on a certain part of the Grampians, 
but the distance is almost equal to a prohibition. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Since the time of the former Statistical Account, few parishes have 
made such marked progress in improvement. Indeed, the face of 
the parish, since that time, has been quite changed, by the great 
extent of waste ground which has been reclaimed, and by the good 
roads which have been made, intersecting the parish in different 
directions. Much certainly has been done in both these respects, 
within the last forty years; but much still remains to be done. In 
many parts of the parish, a want of roads is still much felt, and 
much more waste ground may yet be profitably reclaimed. In 
fact, little waste ground is to be met with any where else, where the 
plough can draw such a deep and strong furrow, and where such 
plenty of excellent material for draining is to be found. The in- 
dustrious tenants in Garvock want only proper encouragement and 
moderate aid from their proprietors ; and what they have already 
done is a pledge that their activity, exertion, and enterprize would 
soon repay the assistance aflforded them. 

The chief obstacles to improvement still remaining are, want of 
enclosures, with open drains, plantations for shelter as well as or- 
nament, and sufficient and substantial farm-buildings. If the pro- 
prietors would lend their helping hand to remove these obstacles, 



BENHOLME. 



51 



the Howe of Garvock, this originally rouffh meadoio, would soon 
outrival the Howe of the Mearns, and repay with interest any pru- 
dent outlay. To add to the lease of nineteen from three to se- 
ven years, according to the extent of waste ground to be reclaim- 
ed on a farm, would encourage improvement, and would eventual- 
ly be profitable to all parties. 

As, in this thinly peopled parish, a scarcity of hands is always 
felt in time of turnip-hoeing, hay and grain harvest, to feu out a 
limited number of cottages, in a convenient spot near the centre 
of the parish, with a strict prohibition of all tippling-houses, might 
be very advantageous. The inhabitants of these cottages would 
find plenty of employment ; and the farmers would enjoy much 
convenience from having labourers so near. And if all this were 
done, the proprietors themselves would find much pleasure in see- 
ing the improved state of their lands, and reap much real profit in 
their increased rentals ; and all, from the highest to the lowest, 
would be much benefited from breathing the wholesome and invi- 
gorating air of an improved and meliorated climate.

PRESBYTERY OF FORDOUN, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEAIINS. 

THE REV. JAMES GLEN, A. M. MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The etymology of the name is sufficiently obvious, — 
Ben a hill, and holme a piece of low~lying level ground. This de- 
rivation suggests the idea of a diversified surface of hill and dale ; 
and this is not undescriptive of the general aspect of the parish. 

Extent, 8fc. — The length and breadth of the parish are nearly 
equal, as it extends about 3 miles from north to south, and the 
same distance from east to west : consequently it may contain 
about 9 square miles. It is bounded on the south-west, by the pa- 
rish of St Cyrus ; on the north-west, by that of Garvock ; on the 
north-east, by that of Bervie ; and on the south-east, by the Ger- 
man Ocean. The parish forms nearly a square, and is thus re- 
markably compact.

KINCAUDINESIIIRE. 



Tojjofj/raphical Appearcmces. — There is nothing in the parish 
that deserves the name either of mountain or hill, with the excep- 
tion of Gourdon Hill, which rises to the height of about 400 feet, 
at the boundary between this parish and that of Bervie. The 
whole parish, when viewed from the German Ocean, seems to as- 
cend gradually from the sea shore till it join the high-lying lands 
of Garvock. Along the shore, is a plain that extends the whole 
length of the parish. This plain varies much in breadth. In some 
places, it is not much more than a hundred yards broad ; in others, 
its extent is much greater, and at one point it reaches inland fully 
a quarter of a mile. This low-lying plain is bounded by an accli- 
vity of equal length with itself, at some places abrupt and steep, 
at others rising with a moie gradual slope. The surface of this 
acclivity is frequently furrowed with high ridges across the slope, 
and there cannot be a doubt that it formed the ancient boundary 
of the German Ocean. From the top of this bank, whose height 
may vary from 70 to 100 feet, the ground, with considerable va- 
riety of surface, gradually rises in elevation, till it reach, as above 
stated, the lands of Garvock. 

There is one cave in the parish, in the face of the acchvity just 
referred to. It is of no great size or extent, not being above 8 
feet in height at the entrance, and as many feet broad, and does 
not reach inland above 40 feet, becoming narrower and lower to- 
wards its extremity. Whether it is artificial or was hollowed out by 
the force of the waves when it was within the range of their ope- 
ration, does not seem to be ascertained. The mouth of the cave 
may be from fifty to sixty feet above the level of the sea. 

The sea coast of the parish may be about three miles in length. 
It possesses little interest, being overlooked by no chflFs or head- 
lands. It is in general rough and rocky, without much sand, ex- 
cept at two places ; and there, to a very limited extent. It is there- 
fore unfavourable for bathing. The rocks, which generally form 
the shore, are little elevated above the level of the sea, whilst be- 
tween them and the cultivated ground, is at most places a barren 
tract of large boulders, forming, perhaps, the most remarkable fea- 
ture of the whole coast. These boulders are of many different 
rocks ; but quartz seems to predominate. Granite is not unfre- 
quent. 

The coast is indented by two small bays, that of Johnshaven, 
and that of the Haughs of Nether Benholme. 

Meteorolopj.— The west or south-west may be called the pre-

vailing wind during tlie year. The writer has often been struck 
with a circumstance, which appeared to him peculiar to the winds 
in this district. The morning is frequently calm and serene. As 
the forenoon advances, the sky is overcast ; and before eleven, a 
strong breeze springs up from the west or south-west, and blows 
without intermission till sunset, when it generally subsides, occa- 
sionalhj in the course of a few seconds, at other times more gra- 
dually. 

Climate.— Th.Q climate, is upon the wiole, harsh and ungenial, 
particularly during the prevalence of east winds in spring. While 
these prevail in the beginning of summer, we have frequent dense 
fogs from the ocean, especially towards the end of May, and dur- 
ing the whole month of June. These fogs are reckoned very un- 
wholesome both to animal and vegetable life. Sometimes they 
are accompanied with a sharp sea breeze, and the effects of the 
pestiferous gale are soon visible. Flowers and fruit-blossoms are 
shrivelled and destroyed, and the foliage of trees in exposed situ- 
ations scorched and withered as if blighted by lightning. At no 
season of summer is there that genial warmth, those balmy and re- 
freshing breezes that prevail in the inland parts of Scotland, or 
on the western coast, with the exception of a few days at most, or 
more frequently only of a few hours, of particular days ; — a damp, 
chilly air coming on almost universally in the evening. I do not 
remember any exception to this observation during my residence 
on this coast, but in the summer of 1826. In that extraordinary 
season alone, have I remarked the warm dry air to continue dur- 
ing the evening, for a succession of days. 

Hydrography. — There are three small streams in the parish. 
One of these rises in the higher grounds towards the north-west 
side of the parish, and runs in an easterly direction. Another rises 
in the north-east side of the parish, and runs towards the south- 
west. These two meet a few hundred yards below the church, 
at the corner of the manse garden, and the united stream, after a 
course of little more than a quarter of a mile, falls into the Ger- 
man Ocean. The third stream is to the south of these ; it flows 
eastward close by the House of Brotherton. During heavy rains, 
these rivulets swell to impetuous torrents, and on some occasions 
with amazing rapidity, which the drainage of the lands has of late 
years greatly increased. They then overflow their banks to the 
injury of the adjoining fields, and to the danger of some families, 
whose dwellings are within the range of the water in high floods. 



54 



kincaudineshihe. 



All of these streams are remarkable for the deep and narrow hol- 
lows, provincially dens, in which they flow. The sides of the hol- 
lows are sometimes formed of rock and sometimes of diluvium. 
The diluvium, often very deep, is acted upon with great ease by 
the current; and in floods, incredible quantities of boulders are 
hurried along, immense beds of which are deposited in level places 
on the banks of the stream. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The prevailing rocks are old red 
sandstone, and old red sandstone conglomerate. The dip is 
a little to the west of south, and scarcely varies throughout the 
parish, being preserved with scarcely any disturbance even in 
the immediate vicinity of trap rocks. These occur to a consider- 
able extent, chiefly in the higher parts of the parish. Dikes of 
trap rock also cut the sandstone strata in directions somewhat va- 
rious, but chiefly east and west. These dikes, probably from the 
greater hardness and durability of their materials, sometimes stand 
out a little above the surface of the sandstone. Some such may 
be sen in the neighbourhood of the harbour at Johnshaven. The 
breadth of these dikes is very various ; some are so small as to be 
mere veins, whilst one or two are many yards in breadth. The 
same dike does not always preserve the same breadth, throughout 
its whole course. The nature of the rocks composing them is also 
various ; some are porphyritic ; others, of small size, are very hard, 
compact, and homogeneous, with an appearance resembling that 
of matter suddenly cooled from a state of fusion. 

Th'fe prevailing trap rock seems to be a kind of porphyry, whose 
basis is wacke ; but greenstone also occurs, and at some places 
an amygdaloid, whose cavities are chiefly filled with green earth. 

The sandstone and conglomerate strata are of almost all possible 
varieties, in respect of compactness and coarseness. Sometimes 
the conglomerates are almost entirely formed of rolled pieces or 
boulders of large size, very loosely united by an arenaceous ce- 
ment. Sometimes the cement is exceedingly firm, and the boul- 
ders are with difficulty detached,— other strata are of sandstone, 
so fine, that the particles can scarcely be detected by the eye ; 
but through almost all the sandstone strata, small pebbles of jasper 
are scattered. The jasper thus occurring is sometimes fine, and 
susceptible of a good polish. The strata are of very various thick- 
ness ; but, in general, they seem to extend a considerable way with- 
out changing their character, and seldom run into one another. 
At one place, the conglomerate may be seen in juxta-position 



IJENHOLME. 



65 



with the trap, — the trap seeming to have overflowed and rested 
upon the uneven surface of the conglomerate. 

The contents of the conglomerate in some places are chiefly 
silicious, quartz, jasper, &amp;c. usually coarse : in other places, varie- 
ties of trap rock prevail. Boulders of granite, greywacke, and of 
many other rocks may also be observed. 

'I'he trap rock is not known to contain any minerals worthy of 
notice except agates, which have been found in different parts of 
the parish. 

But, except along the shore, which is wholly composed of sand- 
stone and conglomerate strata, intersected by dikes, comparative- 
ly little rock can be seen. This renders the determination of the 
relative extent of different kinds of rock exceedingly difficult, — 
impossible, if minute accuracy were required. The streams which 
intersect the parish expose, in their course, the different kinds of 
rock; but elsewhere, rock is rarely visible. A deep diluvial de- 
posit covers almost the whole parish. Sometimes this deposit is 
many yards in depth. It is filled with innumerable boulders of 
various sizes, which may be seen where it is cut by streams, and 
which strew, in vast quantities, the surfaces of fields. These boul- 
ders are of very various kinds, some of quartz, some of granite, 
some of greywacke, and some of trap rocks. 

The soil, throughout the parish, is of almost every variety. Per- 
haps the prevailing kind of soil is a heavy clay. Other parts are 
. composed of fine loam. Others are light and sandy ; but, fortu- 
nately, little of the soil in the parish seems to have been formed 
from the disintegration of old red sandstone, which in other dis- 
tricts is so barren and unproductive. In the higher districts, a cold 
wet clay prevails, with a slight intermixture of peat-moss in some 
parts. 

There are some fields along the shore that present a very bar- 
ren aspect, when newly sown out in spring. Nothing then appears 
but a plain, densely studded with boulders, which completely con- 
ceal the substratum of soil. In ordinary seasons, however, or ra- 
ther when there are copious showers at convenient intervals, these 
fields produce excellent crops. The proprietor has lately reclaim- 
ed and improved a considerable tract of the above description, by 
transporting soil from the adjoining fields. 

Botany. — Lying along an eastern shore, this parish is unfa- 
vourable to the growth of plantations. Trees within the influence 
of the sea breeze have a stunted and unhealthy appearance. Near 



56 



KINCARDINESHIRE. 



the mansion-house of Benholme, however, which is in a sheltered 
situation, and more than a mile from the sea-coast, the woods are 
more vigorous and thriving. There is a tradition, that the upper 
part of the parish was once a forest of oak, — and large trunks of 
that wood are occasionally dug up in the mossy parts of the soil. 
There is also a tradition, that the roof of the old parish church, 
which was entirely of oak, was the product of this forest. 

It may be mentioned as a curious fact, that the garden of Bro- 
therton, which is within a very few hundred yards of the sea, is 
remarkable for its productiveness, and for the fine quality and fla- 
vour both of the large and small fruits. This must be accounted 
for, in a great measure, from the height of the garden walls, which 
protect the various productions from the direct influence of the 
. sea breeze. 

The Aspidium aculeatum may be mentioned as a fern, plentiful 
in moist dens, — and the Saxifraga gramdata, as one of the most 
abundant plants in the parish. Geranium sanguineum, Vicia syl- 
vatica, and Liiliospermum maritimum, are also plentiful. 

II. — Civil History. 

Land-moners. — The sole land-owners are, James Scott, Esq. of 
Brotherton ; Mrs R. Scott of Benholme ; and James Fitzmaurice 
Scott, Esq. of Knox. 

Parochial Registers. — The date of the earhest entry in the parish 
cash-book is 30th April 1684; and from that time the parochial 
registers have been regularly kept. 

Antiquities. — The only ancient building now remaining in the 
parish is the Tower of Benholme. This, at one time, had been a 
place of considerable strength. The date of its foundation is un- 
known. It is a high and massive square building of sandstone, still 
in a state of complete preservation. It seems at one time to have 
stood on a' peninsula, formed by one of the streams above-mention- 
ed on the east and south sides, and by a deep trench or moat on 
the west. A passage was formed over this moat by the late pro- 
prietor, G. R. Scott, Esq., in opening a new approach to the man- 
sion-house. 

The church, which was taken down in 1832, was of conside- 
rable antiquity. There is no record, nor even tradition, as to 
the time when it was founded. It had obviously been, at one 
period, used as a place of worship by the Papists, as it was furnish- 
ed with a font for holy water, with an incense altar, and with a 
niche or small press in the wall, which is conjectured to have been 
the receptacle of sacred relics. This conjecture is the more pro- 



BENHOLME. 



57 



bable, as the niche had obviously been carefully enclosed by a dooi:, 
and had the resemblance of human bones carved on the inside. 
The workmen employed in taking down the old church discovered 
two human skeletons, in a state of tolerable preservation, among 
the ruins of a part of the north wall which had been overturned by 
gunpowder. The precise position in which they had reclined could 
not be ascertained, but they seemed to have been laid side by side, 
with the heads towards the east. It appeared that they had rest- 
ed on a flat stone, built into the wall, six or seven feet above the 
ground. The under side of this stone was quite rough, while the 
upper side had been hewn; and near the one extremity, had been cut 
a circle of a foot diameter, enclosing three or four shapeless gravings 
near the circumference. From the circle proceeded two parallel 
lines, about three inches apart, extending to the other extremity, 
where was a circle similar to the former, but adorned with some 
additional gravings. There was no trace of any inscription or date. 
Of course, the period when the stone, with its sepulchral accom- 
paniments, was introduced into the wall, must remain a secret. 
A portion of the stone had been broken off, a number of years ago, 
when the church received some repairs, and was found built into 
the belfry. If any bones were then discovered, the circumstance 
probably excited little attention, and is now quite forgotten. In 
the burying aisle of the old church, were two monuments, now built 
into the wall of the present church. 

 On one of these, the following verses are inscribed : 

" Vix lustrum vixit. mirabere plurima vixit 

LongEeva ilia mihi. quaa bene vixit. erit 
Foelix vita, obitus foelicior. ultima vox hsec 

Cum Christo ut vivam. nunc mihi dulce mori 
Vera igitur Maria es. Marthfe mundjina relinquis 
Cum Maria semper vive. fruare Deo." 
And on a stone, formerly belonging to the same monument, is an inscription which 
points out the individusl to whom it refers : 

" Hie . jacet . Domina . Maria . Keyth . charissima . filia . noliilissimi . commi- 
tis . illustrissimique . Domini . Georgii . comitis . Marescalli . Domini . Keyth . ct . 
Altrie . &amp;c . et . nobilissimiEe . clarissimasque . Dominaj . Dna2 . Margar . Ogilvy . 
Marescalli . comitissse . qua . fcelix . in . Domino . obiit . 14 . Octob . Anno . Do- 
mini . 1620 . jEtatis . sua; . 5"." 

A curious circumstance connected with this parish is recorded by Chambers in his 
Biographical Dictionary. The party principally concerned was Margaret Ogilvy, 
widow of the celebrated founder of Marischal College, Aberdeen,— the fifth Earl Ma- 
rischal. She, with her then husband, « Sir Alexander Strauchane of Thornetoun, 
Knight," and " Roljert Strauchan, Doctor in Physic," were accused 3d Match 16'24 
of plundering the place of Benholm, belonging to the Earl Marischal, a short time 
before his decease. At the same time, James Keith of Benholme, probably the Earl's 
steward, was accused of the same crime. The inventory of articles stolen proves the 
Earl's great wealth. " Of Portugal ducats, and other species of foreign gold, to the 
avail of 26,000 pounds or thereby ; 36 dozen gold buttons ; a rich jewel set with dia- 
monds, which the deceased Earl received as a gift when he was ambassador in Den- 
mark, worth GOOO merks ; the Queen of Denmark's picture in gold, set about with

• On the farm of Boghead, a quantity of human bones have been 
dug up, the coffins containing which were formed of unhewn stones. 
It is remarkable that these remains should have been found, not 
only in one spot, but scattered over a space of nearly a mile in 
length. A number of flint arrow-heads were found in the same 
vicinity; and tradition speaks vaguely of a battle fought here. 

III. — Population. 

I do not find any authentic statement of the population of this 
parish, prior to the year 1753. It then amounted to 1351. It 
seems, with some fluctuations, gradually to have increased till the 
year 1773, when it amounted to 1715. From that time it seems 
to have slowly declined; and in 1793, it was reduced to 1557. 

The amount of the population in 1831 was 1484. The de- 
crease of the population may be ascribed in a great measure to the 
union of small farms into larger ones in the country part of the pa- 
rish, and to the influence of press-gangs during the late wars in the 
village of Johnshaven. The press-gangs not only carried off" many 
of the most able men, but rendered the village an unpleasant resi- 
dence for others, who, therefore, sought every opportunity of leav- 



ing it. 

Population in 1831 residing in the village of Johnshaven, was - 1027

rich diamonds, estimated at 5000 merks; a jasper stone for stemming of Hood, esti- 
mated at 500 French crowns ; a chain of ' equall perle,' wherein were 400 pearls, 
great and small ; two chains of gold, worth iJOOO merks ; a great pair of bracelets, all 
set with diamonds, price thereof 500 crowns ; the other pair of gold bracelets at 600 
pounds the pair; a turquois ring worth 10 French crowns; a diamond set in a ring, 
worth 28 French crowns, with a number of other small rings set with diamonds and 
other rich stones in gold, worth 300 French crowns ; also 1 e;000 merks of silver and 
gold, ready coined, which was within a green coffer ; together with the whole tapes- 
try, silver-work, bedding, goods, gear, and plenishing, within the said place." Whe- 
ther any further steps were taken in this matter does not appear. It rather seems that 
it was compromised, and that the prosecution was allowed to drop. 
Another monument bears the following : 

" PisB memoria; justisque meritis patris et mariti optimi, Robert Scott a Benholm, 
qui mortalitatis cceno relicto, in immortalitatis sedem sublatus est, atatis suse anno

There are 6 persons insane and fatuous ; none blind, nor deaf

Illegitimate births in the course of the last three years, 9. 

Only one individual of independent fortune resides in the parish. 
The property of each of the land-owners affords a rent far above 
the sum of L. 50. 

The great body of the people may be described as moral in their 
habits. Although there is a general and, I trust, a growing 
respect for religion on the part of many, yet I cannot say from per- 
sonal observation that there are many people of eminent piety. 
Experimental religion, I fear, is but little known in this part of the 
country. But by means of evangelical preaching, of parish libra- 
ries, and of Sabbath schools, it is hoped, that, by the blessirrg 
of God, the religious character of the people will speedily im- 
prove. 

It is to their credit that poaching is but little pi'actised, and 
smuggling altogether unknown. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — There are in this parish about 4000 acres of cul- 
tivated land, and about 1064 acres of land uncultivated, of which 
about 160 might be profitably improved and brought into cultiva- 
tion. There is no undivided common in the parish. There are 
about 325 acres under wood. 

With the exception of some about Benholme and Broth- 
erton, the wood is mostly young. The trees planted are chief- 
ly fir, ash, beech, and oak. Of all kinds, larch seems to 
thrive best, but is said not to thrive for more than about forty 
years, when its top begins to wither and die, probably from the 
roots meeting with something unfavourable in the soil. Many 
of the trees are covered with lichens, chiefly of the genera Ramar 
Ima and Usnea, to an extent which seems prejudicial to vegetation, 
and mdicates perhaps an unsuitable climate. The trees in the plan- 
tations are in general thinned annually. 

Rent.—T\\e average rent of arable land may be from L. 1, 12s. 
to L. 1, 13s. per imperial acre. 

Leases.— The general duration of leases is for nineteen years.

KINCARDINESHIRE. 



The fcirm-buildings are generally in a good state, and sufficient 
for the respective farms. Husbandry is in a state of high improve- 
ment, the land carefully drained, and more or less of the waste 
land is reclaimed every year. Many of the farmers deserve much 
credit for their enterprising spirit in cultivating waste lands. Many 
places which were a perfect wilderness twelve years ago, are now 
drained, and producing excellent crops. Mr Scott of Brotherton 
retains several farms in his own hands, and has brought them into 
a state of high cultivation.  

The greater part of the land is unenclosed with permanent 
fences, except on the coast, where some hundreds of acres are in- 
closed with substantial stone dikes, about four or four and a-half feet 
high ; but the farmers frequently enclose portions of the lands with 
wooden railings for one or two years, and the proprietors are ac- 
customed to let grass fields to a considerable extent for summer 
pasture, which bring good rents, varying from L. 1, 10s. to L. 4 per 
acre, according to the quality of the land. 

■ There are in the parish eleven farms provided with thrashing- 
machines, more than half of which are driven by water. 

Qiiarries. — There is only one quarry of any importance in the 
parish, which is at Benholme. The rock is a sandstone, not very 
fine grained. 

Fishings. — The sea-fishing at Johnshaven was formerly much 
more extensive than at present. Its decline is, in great part, at- 
tributed to the system of impressment pursued during the war. 
The fish caught are chiefly cod, haddocks, and turbot, with some 
species of inferior importance. At the distance of several miles 
from the shore, large fish, both cod and ling, are plentiful. The 
fish caught are partly sold in the parish, chiefly to fish-curers, 
partly carried inland to Laurencekirk, Fordoun, &amp;c. Some are 
also carried to Montrose. An attempt has been made for two years 
to estabhsh a salmon-fishery in this parish, but with little suc- 
cess. The coast being rocky is not favourable for stake-nets. 

Manufactures. — The only branch of manufacture in the parish 
is linen manufacture, in which about 230 hands are employed. 
The weavers usually work about sixteen hours a day. 

Navigation. — Three sloops belong to Johnshaven, chiefly em- 
ployed in the coal trade, and sometimes in exporting grain. The 
tonnage altogether amounts to 150 tons. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Town.— ThQie is no market-town in the parish, and 

4 



BENHOLME. 



61 



the inhabitants resort to Montrose, distant about ten miles from 
the centre of the parish, and to Bervie, distant about three miles. 
Till within these seven years, Montrose was the nearest market- 
town. Within that time, a grain market has been established in 
Bervie, and is now much frequented. The grain is shipped at 
Gourdon, a small sea port in the parish of Bervie. 

Means of Communication. — The only village in the parish is 
Johnshaven. The turnpike road from Aberdeen to Dundee runs 
through the parish ; and the roads to inland parts of the county 
are improving gradually. The length of turnpike road within 
the parish, is about three miles. There is no post-office in the 
parish, the post-town being Bervie, The Royal Mail between 
Edinburgh and Aberdeen passes through the parish, and the New 
Times stage-coach between Dundee and Aberdeen. These run 
all the year, and occasionally there is a light coach between Mon- 
trose and Aberdeen. There are two beautiful bridges of consi- 
derable span and height on the present turnpike road, and two on 
the old post-road, which are still in pretty good repair. 

Harbour. — The harbour of Johnshaven, the only one in the 
parish, is very small. Were this enlarged and improved, it is sup- 
posed that the trade of Johnshaven might be greatly increased. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is not far from the centre of 
the parish, but, being a mile and a half from Johnshaven, it can- 
not be said to be very well situated for the bulk of the popula- 
tion. A person may walk from the church to the most distant 
house in the parish, in little more than half an hour. The parish 
is therefore of a very convenient size. The present church was 
built in 1832; it is a plain but neat structure, and in excellent or- 
der. It is seated for 768 persons, sixteen inches having been al- 
lowed for a sitting ; but this allowance has been found too small, 
so that pews let for six or eight will not hold so many grown-up 
people. There are no free sittings. 

The manse was built in 1826. The glebe consists of six acres, 
and lets for L. 12, 10s. The stipend amounts to 16 chalders. 
There is no chapel of ease, missionary, nor catechist in the parish. 
The only place of worship besides the parish church belongs to 
the United Associate Synod. The minister, I believe, is paid 
chiefly by seat-rents, and by the offering at the church door. His 
stipend altogether must be under L. 100. 

The number of families attending the parish church is 314; of 
individuals, 1280. This, according to the common calculation, 



62 



KINCARDINESHmE, 



should give an average attendance of 640, and in summer the 
average is above this. The number of famihes belonging to the 
United Associate Synod is 45; of individuals, 163. Fifteen fa- 
milies are not attached to any body of Christians. The number 
of individuals attached to no body is 32. There are 2 Bereans, 
4 Old Independents, 2 individuals belonging to the Associate 
Synod of Original Seceders, and 1 Episcopalian. There is no 
Papist in the parish. 

In good weather, divine service is well attended in the parish 
church ; but the church, being situated at the distance of fully a 
mile and a-half from the great body of the population, the con- 
gregation is sometimes small in very stormy weather. I have heard 
that the dissenting chapel is never full, except at the evening ser- 
mon, once a fortnight, when many connected with the Established 
Church attend. The average number of communicants at the 
Established Church, is about 570. The only religious society 
connected with the Establishment is an association for furthering 
the four great schemes of the General Assembly, — the Highland 
Schools, the East India Mission, the Colonial Churches of North 
America, and Church Extension. The subscription amounts to a 
very limited sum. The average amount of church collections yearly 
for religious objects is about L. 15. 

Education. — There are altogether seven schools in the parish, 
— one parochial, six unendowed. None of them are supported 
by societies, nor by individual subscription. Five of them are taught 
by females. In two of the schools, English reading, writing, arithme- 
tic, book-keeping, and navigation are taught. In the parish school, 
besides the above branches of education, Enghsh grammar is taught, 
and Latin. In the schools taught by females, English reading is prin- 
cipally taught ; some of the schoolmistresses also teach knitting 
and sewing. 

The parish schoolmaster's salary is the maximum. He has the 
legal accommodation. The school fees vary. In the parish school 
and in one other, they graduate from 2s. to 4s. a quarter. In the 
female schools, they seldom exceed 2s. 6d. Some poor people 
pay weekly ld. or 2d. according to circumstances. 

I should think there cannot be above ten or twelve persons be- 

• Some of these are people belonging to the coast-guard service, and nominally 
belong to the Church of England, but generally attend the parish church or dissent- 
ing meeting-house.

tween six and fifteen years of age, who cannot read or write. Of 
persons above fifteen, there are not more than three or four who 
cannot read. The people, in general, are fully alive to the be- 
nefits of education. There are a few families so distant from any 
school that children cannot be sent to school except in summer, 
and even then they cannot attend till they be seven or eight years 
of age. 

The parish is, however, fully supplied with schools ; and last 
year, in spring, a seventh part of the population was attending 
school. 

Libraries.— There is a parish library, consisting of upwards of 
500 volumes of religious books ; and a juvenile library, consisting of 
nearly 400 small volumes. The parish library is highly valued by 
the people ; and at present upwards of 300 individuals read from 
it. The books thus find their way to more than 200 families. 

Friendly Societies. — There are two friendly societies amongst 
the people of Johnshaven, one of which has a stock of L. 600, and 
gives out L. 60 a year. The other is upon a more hmited scale. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — About 40 individuals receive pa- 
rochial aid. The rates are from Is. 6d. to 8s. a-month. The 
average rate may be 4s. 6d. or 5s. a-month. The annual amount 
of contributions for the relief of the poor is about L. 108, arising 
from the following sources: — Collections in the church, L. 60, 
10s. ; seat-rents, L. 20, 10s. ; interest of money, L. 22, 10s. ; pro- 
clamation of banns, L. 1, 10s. ; mortcloths, L. 3. Whatever is 
given away above this is supplied by voluntary donations. 

There is certainly a strong disposition among many of the poor 
to refrain from asking parochial relief. Many instances of this 
kind have come to the writer's knowledge, and he does all in his 
power to encourage this spirit of independence. 

Alehouses. — There are ten alehouses or spirit-shops. I have no 
hesitation in saying, that their effect upon the morals of the people 
is most pernicious. 

Fuel. — There is no fuel obtained in the parish except a little 
firewood ; and the inhabitants are supplied with coals chiefly from 
England. One sloop, laden with Scotch coal, arrives at Johnshaven 
annually. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
There must have been great improvements in farming, in the 
course of the last forty years. Much waste land has been reclaim- 
ed during that time, and the quantity of grain produced must be 



64 



KINCARDINESHIRE. 



much greater than at the above period. It does not appear that 
any improvement has taken place in the circumstances of the people 
in Johnshaven. On the contrary, it is the testimony of old residen- 
ters, that poverty is gradually gaining ground. It is reported that 
forty or fifty years ago, there were many in that village in easy cir- 
cumstances ; now, the greater part of the families are nearly on a 
level ; and comparatively few are able to assist their neighbours to 
any extent, ia times of affliction and bereavement. This may be ac- 
counted for in various ways. Trade was, for many years, in a very 
depressed state, — the weavers got into difficulties, — nothing more 
could be earned than was sufficient to provide a scanty subsistence 
for themselves and famiUes, — respectable furniture and comfort- 
able clothing could not be procured, and in many instances debt 
was contracted. And when employment became more plentiful 
with a better remuneration, it was a long time before those who 
were sunk in the lowest state of poverty could rise above their dif- 
ficulties ; and lately, when some of the more industrious were be- 
ginning to surmount the harassments of poverty and destitution, 
trade again became depressed, and the labouring classes must re- 
new their struggles with hard toil and inadequate remuneration. 

The seafaring people in the meantime had not been in more fa- 
vourable circumstances than their neighbours. For several years, 
the fishing on the coast has been more precarious than usual, and 
the herring-fishing often a complete failure. In these circum- 
stances, not only were time and labour consumed to no purpose, but 
debt was incurred in providing nets and sea stores. Many families 
of the seafaring people have therefore been reduced to nearly the 
lowest state of poverty. And, in truth, I know not any village of 
like size, where there are so many poor people as in Johnshaven. 

It does not appear to me that this parish is susceptible of much 
improvement in the system of husbandry, as the farmers seem to 
keep pace with the improvements of the age. It is my decided 
opinion, however, that an improvement in the system of education 
would be of essential benefit both in a temporal and spiritual point 
of view. Did all the young people receive a thoroughly scriptural 
education, and were they kept at school so long as to enable them 
not only to read the Scriptures with facihty, but so as to enable 
them to read and understand any ordinary English author, then the 
parish library and the preaching of the gospel would be tenfold 
more beneficial than at present. It is no slander upon my people 
to assert, that many of them have been so imperfectly educated as 



BENHOLME.

not to be able to read intelligently books either of history or of 
practical divinity ; and consequently they cannot be expected to 
follow and appreciate a connected discourse from the pulpit. The 
defective state of education is deeply to be deplored. And I see 
not how it can be remedied till parents are more faithful, and pains- 
taking in the discharge of the vows which they take upon them- 
selves at the baptism of their children. The teachers of youth may 
labour as they please, but if there is no training at home, their la- 
bours will be comparatively fruitless. Were parents to be regular 
and persevering in giving instructions to their children, on the after- 
noon and evening of the Lord's day, it is incalculable not only what 
progress would be made in scholarship, but, by the blessing of 
God, what moral improvement would take place. The want of 
piety and practical godliness lies at the root of all the evils that 
abound amongst us. Could people be made pious, then, as a mat- 
ter of course, they would become frugal and industrious, and, as a 
general rule, they would improve in worldly comforts, in proportion 
to the growth of grace in the soul. Were the money that is spent 
in the alehouse devoted to its proper objects, the comfort of many 
families would be greatly increased, and the children who are at 
present neglected might receive a suitable education.

PRESBYTERY OF FORDOUN, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. JAMES LESLIE, D. D. MINISTER. 



L-|- — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — " Fordoun or Fordun, as it was anciently written, is 
said to be a Gaelic word, signifying ' the anterior or prominent 
hill,' and is very descriptive of the situation of the village and 
church of Fordoun, which are placed on the brow or declivity of 
Finella Hill, the most prominent hill in that quarter. This hill 
is completely separated from the Grampians, which lie behind it, 
by a strath, to which the name of Strath Finella properly belongs, 
although the term has of late years been applied to the hill itself. 
Finella is the hill ichich rises from Strath Finella. This parish 
was known by the name of Fordoun as far back as can be traced ; 
but it, or at least a district of it near to the church, was at one time 
called also Palladius or Paldy Parish, in consequence of a chapel 
which still stands in the church-yard, and was dedicated to St 
Palladius. Several of the parishes in this neighbourhood had two 
names, the one more general, and which applied to the whole pa- 
rish, the other taken from some Romish saint to whom a chapel 
had been erected, and under whose patronage the Catholic Church 
was anxious to have it believed that the parish was placed,— thus 
Conveth alias Laurencekirk, Aberluthnott alias St Mary's or 
Marykirk. There is no certainty as to the period when St Pal- 
ladius' Chapel was first erected. Although the tradition is, that 
Palladius lived and died at Fordoun, it is more probable, that 
amidst that inundation of monks which came early from Italy into 
Scotland, some of them, attracted by the beauty of the place, 
fixed their residence at Fordoun, and built there a chapel to their 
favourite saint, pretending, no doubt, that they had brought some

of his bones and other relics along with them. Tliese were pro- 
bably placed in a humble chest at first, but, as the fame of the 
saint increased, and, consequently, also the pilgrimages to his 
chapel, it was thought necessary to remove them from their first 
humble resting-place to a silver shrine, a present from the Arch- 
bishop of St Andrews. 

" Fordoun was a vicarage belonging to the Archbishop of St 
Andrews, and was called a Mensal Church, the teinds of the parish 
being allotted for the support of the archbishop's table. Forbes 
or Tytler says, it was called ' The Mother Church of the Mearns.' 
Although the period when St Palladius' Chapel was built cannot 
now be ascertained, yet we are certain the chapel is of great an- 
tiquity. This is not only evident from the appearance of the 
foundations, but also from the universal declaration of the early 
Scotch historians, that Kenneth the Third, who was killed by Fi- 
nella near Kincardine Castle or Palace in this parish, had come 
to Kincardine, in order to make a pilgrimage to St Palladius' 
Chapel. Kenneth ascended the throne in 970, and was murder- 
ed in 994 ; and from the circumstance of his making a pilgrimage 
to the chapel at Fordoun, it must have been a place of noted 
sanctity before that period. There is a well in the minister's 
ground, called St Palladius' Well, from whence the monks who 
had charge of the shrine and the pilgrims were probably furnished 
with water. An old house which stood at the entry into the 
church-yard, and was pulled down within these few years, in order 
to enlarge the burying-groiind, went formerly by the name of the 
Manse, and perhaps was the habitation of the monks. A market, 
one of the largest in the Mearns, which at one time stood at no 
great distance from the chapel, but which was afterwards removed 
some miles in consequence of an exchange or sale of land, went 
by the name of Palladius or Paldy-Fair, a name which it still re- 
tains." 

Extent. — The mean length of the parish, extending from south- 
west to north-east, or from Nether Craigniston to Mondynes, may 
be about 8 miles ; and its mean breadth, from south-east to north- 
west, that is, from Pittarrow to the summit of the Grampians above

Drumtoclity, aboutSi miles,— tbus making its superficial contents 
about 44 square miles. 

Boundaries.— The parish of Fordoun is of a quadrangular form, 
and is bounded on the south-west, by Fettercairn ; on the south 
and sou th-east, by the parishes of Marykirk, Laurencekirk, and 
Arbuthnott ; on the north-east, by Glenbervie ; and on the 
north-west, by Strachan, which it joins on the summit of the 
Grampians. The parish extends along the south side of the 
Grampians, and on the north side of the valley of Strathmore, or 
rather of that division of it familiarly known by the name of the 
'« Hoio o' the Mearns," which comprehends the parishes of Fet- 
tercairn, Marykirk, Laurencekirk, and Fordoun. 

The mean length of the " How o' the Mearns," from the 
North Esk at Dalladies to the Bervie at Mohdynes, may be near- 
ly 12 miles ; the breadth, from the top of the Hill of Garvoek to - 
the summit of the Grampians, 7 miles,— the extent of the « How" 
being thus about 90 square miles. The distance from the centre 
of the parish, or rather from the church of Fordoun, to Stone- 
haven, the county town, is about eleven miles; to Bervie, ten; and 
to Montrose, fifteen. The disposable produce is carried to one 
or other of these places, to all of which there is easy access by 

excellent roads. ' . 

Topoc/raphical Appearances.— The general slope of the parish is 

towards the south-east, and the aspect is agreeably diversified by a 
succession of hill and dale. It is divided into two districts, viz. the 
Hoio district, comprehending the level part lying in the bottom ot 
the valley of Strathmore, and the Brae district, \ymg on the south 
side of the Grampians. This last district is subdivided by the 
streams which take their rise in the Grampians, and by the small 
fflens or valleys formed by these streams, into three or four smaller 
districts, such as the Brae of Glenfarqichar, Kinkell, and Mon- 
dynes, the Brae of Craignisfon, and the well-known Brae of For- 
doun. Several of these glens or valleys, having their sides more or 
less covered by plantations, give a rich and pleasing appearance 
to the parish. On the sides of the hills, cultivation has been car- 
ried to a considerable elevation, sometimes farther than is profit- 
able either to landlord or tenant. a r .i 

From Laurencekirk or the Hill of Garvoek, on the south of the 
valley, the parish of Fordoun, on the opposite side, presents a rich 
and highly cultivated appearance, rendered more pleasing by the 
colour of the soil, which is either a brown gravelly loam, or red

ferruginous clay ; and, from the waste or uncultivated part of the 
parish being mostly confined to the summits of the mountains, the 
appearance of the How, as well as the sloping grounds along the 
sides of the hills, is one unbroken extent of rich cultivation. This 
is still farther improved ,by the neat appearance of the farm-stead- 
ings, which are, for the most part, substantially built of stone and 
lime, slated, and white-washed. The plantations on Hunter's Hill, 
Strathfinella, and the enclosures of Kincardine, Phesdo, and Mon- 
boddo, enrich and shelter the lower part of the parish. In a beau- 
tiful glen, on the east end of Strathfinella, and on the top of a pre- 
cipitous bank overhanging the Luther, stand the church, manse, 
and village inn of Fordoun ; and on the other side of the valley, 
gently sloping to the south, the village of Auchinblae. Few si- 
tuations are more happily chosen than that of the church and manse 
of Fordoun. Embosomed among fine old trees, with Strathfinella 
hill on the right, and the Grampians in the distance, and overlook- 
ing the Luther meandering down the narrow but beautiful valley, 
the sides of which are richly covered with wood, it forms a scene 
of picturesque beauty, which all must admire. This valley is said 
to have formed the scene so feelingly described in Dr Beattie's 
poem. Retirement. 

Mountains. — The principal mountains are the range of Grampians, 
which form the north boundary of the parish. These mountains are 
tame in the outline, and do not here attain the elevation they do to- 
wards the west coast of Scotland, — the average height of the ridge not 
exceeding 1400 or 1500 feet. There are two subordinate ridges or 
spurs, which project out from the main ridge nearly at right angles, 
viz. the Knock Hill behind Kinkell and Mondynes, and the Hill of 
Arnbarrow, and its more southerly termination of Hunter's Hill. 
The hill of Strathfinella is, however, by far the most prominent 
feature in the parish. It is one entire mass of sandstone, and is per- 
fectly isolated, being separated from the Grampians by the narrow 
valley of Strathfinella, in some places scarcely 100 yards wide ; 
its extreme length or base is about four miles, its breadth about 
a mile and a quarter. The outline is tame and unbroken, and 
its elevation above the sea does not exceed 1000 or 1200 feet, the 
height above the How being perhaps 700 or 800, while the How 
or bottom of the valley of Strathmore is here, upon an average, not 
more than 260 above high water mark. 

Meteor ologij. —The temperature of Fordoun is perhaps higher 
than that of any parish in the county, with the exception of Mary-

kirk and Fettercairn, and certainly of Upper Banchory ; but, as 
no correct register has been kept of the range of either the baro- 
,meter or thermometer, it is impossible to institute a comparison 
between the temperature of the parish and that of any other in the 
county or in Scotland. It is the general belief, that the winters 
are more mild, in this part of Scotland at least, than formerly. 
Since the severe winter of 1822-23, and pretty heavy falls of snow, 
which kept the ground for a few weeks in 1827, and 1829-30, 
snow has scarcely, at any one time, fallen to the depth of two 
inches; and for several winters, scarcely so much has fallen as to 
whiten the ground. On the other hand, the spring months are 
colder than tradition reports them to have formerly been. The 
autumn months, in this part of the island, are invariably fine ; and 
perhaps no months in the year yield so much enjoyment out of 
doors as September and October. The temperature is now more 
equable, during the whole season, than formerly, the winter less 
severe and protracted, the summer less sultry, and the spring more 
tardy and gradual in its approach. This may partly be accounted 
for by the general drainage which has taken place over the whole 
island, and by the judicious disposition of the plantations, which, 
instead of forming, as on the continent, immense forests, here only 
serve the purposes of ornament and shelter, without preventing the 
free circulation of air, or the gradual eva'poration which takes place 
in an open and dry country. 

The climate may be described as dry ; and, towards the upper 
part of the parish, it is no doubt cold, particularly in the spring 
months, but it is highly favourable to health and longevity. About 
fifty years ago, before the marshy grounds were drained, the lower 
part of the parish was subject to hoar frosts and mildews, which, 
occurring during the month of August, when the corn was in a 
milky state, often blighted the most promising crops, and blasted 
the hopes and prospects of the farmer. At this period, the dry 
gravelly soils, lying at a considerable elevation above the How,

below the freezing point, about 8 a. m. that morning, and contniued so for nearly two 
hours The air out of doors was calm, but excessively keen and piercing. I'lere

rose to 1 8° ; nd before 10 r. m. it was 30°. The thaw that night was most rapid. 

The hiffhest Doint that the thermometer was observed to reach at the Manse of l-or- 
doun waf one very hot day in July, betwixt 1807 and 1810, the year cannot now be 
exactly recollected. The thermometer in the shade was about 2 r. i. , in the 
open air it rose to above 90°.— Notes by Dr Leslie.

were the object of the farmer's ambition, being safe from the fogs 
and hoar-frost which infested the lower grounds; and the harvests 
beino- generally early and always safe, the grain from the Brae of 
Fordoun was in constant demand for seed-corn, and generally 
fetched a high price; thus, what produced bankruptcy and ruin to 
the How farmer, at that period, brought wealth and independence 
to Mm of the Braes. Times are altered. Draining is now under- 
stood, and has been so successfully practised, that not a bog, loch, 
or swamp, remains in the parish. Deep strong clays are in de- 
mand ; their value is understood ; and, by the judicious application 
of lime and other manures, their powers of production are com- 
pletely developed. At the period alluded to, agues were common, 
but such a disease is now scarcely known. There cannot be said 
to be any prevailing distempers.

Of the 258 persons who have died in the parish during the last 
seven years, 107 were of the age of 70 or above it, and more than 
half of the whole number was 60 or above that age. One woman, 
who died in 1834, was mafried fifty-five years. Her husband and all 
iier family, four in number, are still alive. One of the persons who 
died in 1834 was 98, another 93, and the third 92 years of age. 

Rivers. — Two or three small streams take their rise in the 
Grampian district. The most westerly of these is the burn of 
Craigniston, which forms, for some distance, the west boundary of 
the parish, and divides it from Fettercairn. It is a mere rivulet, 
and can be stept across at any point before it leaves the parish. 
The next stream to the eastward is the Ferdun. This stream or 
rivulet rises in the Grampians, and is formed by two small burns 
that unite at Clattering Briggs. After running along the west side 
of Strathfinella hill, it continues in a southerly direction, until it 
falls into the Luther below Thornton. Luther Water takes its rise

KlNCAllDINESHIllE, 



on the hills behind Drumtochty. It runs through the bold and 
romantic grounds on the west and south of Drumtochty Castle, 
and at Auchinblae receives a small stream from the hills of Glen- 
farquhar. From this it takes a south-easterly direction, passing 
along the base of the beautifully wooded banks at the manse of For- 
doun. At Fordoun House it turns in a south-westerly direction, 
and ultimately enters the parish of Laurencekirk below Pittarrow. 
The Bervie water also rises in the hills of Glenfarquhar, in this 
parish. For a considerable distance, it runs in a south-easterly di- 
rection, until it passes Glenbervie House, winding round the Knock 
hill ; it afterwards takes a south-west course to Leithfield ; from 
thence it runs in a south-east direction through the grounds and 
plantations of Arbuthnott House, and falls into the sea at Bervie. 
None of these streams are of great size ; they are consequently of 
little value as fishing streams. The Luther is thought to afford 
good sport for the angler, but the trouts are small, seldom exceed- 
ing six or eight inches in length. Salmon are occasionally got in 
the Bervie, but it can only be considered as a trouting stream. 
Both these streams, with the tributary burns, afford, however, ex- 
cellent spawning-ground for the salmon, which are often found as 
far up as the very base of the Grampians. 

Geology and Mineralogy.  — The geology of this parish may 
illustrate that of many similarly situated along the southern decli- 
vity of the Grampian range. It embraces two parts, a mountain- 
ous and a level portion ; the former extends to the summit of the 
chain, which it skirts for a considerable distance ; the latter forms 
a share of what is called the ' How' or valley ' of the Mearns,' 
a remarkably level tract, extending for many miles in a direction 
pretty nearly north-east and south-west. This how or valley is 
to be considered rather as formed by contiguous parallel ranges 
of hills the Grampians and the low range of Garvock ex- 
tended into Forfarshire, and forming the valley of Strathmore 
by their continuation in the Sidlaw range, than as an im- 
mediate effect, either of elevating or excavating agency. Ac- 
cordingly, we find the strata nearly horizontal, and, where expos- 
ed, but little disturbed. These strata are of new red sandstone, 
and remarkably follow the southern base of the Grampian chain 
throughout a great part of its length, conducing to the formation 
of some highly picturesque scenery. The upper strata are thin, 
soft, and much variegated by white spots ; the lower ones, which

rise towards tlie Grampians, assume the conglomerate character, 
and contain pebbles from the older rocks of great variety of size. 
This conglomerate, the trap dikes which occur in it, and the man- 
ner in which it reposes on the transition series, have been minute- 
ly described by Colonel Imrie in the section of Glenesk, a few . 
miles west of the parish of Fordoun, and which is published in the 
Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. A general simila- 
rity of character is observable at different points of the chain, but the 
section in Fordoun parish is less detailed, whilst at the same time it 
offers some peculiarities. The most ample view is obtained in the 
course of the Ferdun Burn, which passes the House of Phesdo. We 
are first struck by the rapid rise of the sandstone strata, for which, 
however, we soon find an adequate cause in the appearance of a 
very remarkable trap dike, which has obviously had a most mate- 
rial share in this effect, and which leaves us in some doubt as to 
how far the elevation of the great range was concerned in it. It 
is a remarkable fact, that in the section here described, the sand- 
stone strata are nctually thrown back, or dip to the north, in con- 
sequence of this intrusive rock. Nor does the cause seem merely 
local. There is perhaps not much doubt that this is the same mass 
which appears in Colonel Imrie's section through the grounds of 
the Buryi. The mineralogical character is similar ; and we have 
succeeded in tracing the particular dike in question, for a very con- 
siderable distance on each side of the Ferdun Burn, just above the an- 
cient British fortress called the Green Castle, where it was first noticed. 
To the westward, it may be recognized in the bed of the Craigniston 
burn, a little above the farm of Bogindollo ; — to the eastward, it is 
exposed in a ravine in the side of the hill of Strathfinella, where it 
plunges under an immense bed of gravel. By a careful search we 
have, however, detected it, not far from the church of Fordoun 
several miles to the eastward, close to the road leading to the 
mansion of Drumtochty. One circumstance which renders it more 
easily discoverable is a remarkable one. The sandstone in its vi- 
cinity is so much hardened as to improve it greatly as a building- 
stone, consequently it is quarried at several points along the line 
of trap. Indeed, we find the sandstone modified within a few feet 
from a loose bed not deserving the name of rock to a quartzy 
consistence. The trap is a well-characterized greenstone, con- 
taining amethyst ; and its manner of insinuation between the sand- 
stone strata, sometimes giving the appearance of interstratifica-

tion, is exceedingly curious, but could not be explained without 
figures. The sandstone below the trap or nearer the axis of the 
chain soon disappears, and we find another remarkable trap for- 
mation, probably connected with the transition rocks which imme- 
diately succeed it, and which perhaps finds its counterpart in the 
claystone porphyry of Colonel Imrie. It is a dai-k purple felspar- 
rock, and has the remarkable appearance of a conglomerate, with- 
out being so, properly speaking ; for we find invariably, that the 
apparent pebbles are composed of the same material with the 
basis or ground in which they are contained. Immediately suc- 
ceeding this rock, we find transition clay-slate of various shades, 
from purple to green, and containing a bed of limestone, which, 
from the rarity of that mineral in this county, has been worked 
under great disadvantages on the Fettercairn property at Clatter- 
ing Briggs. Of -this bed we also find the counterpart in Colonel 
Imrie's section, a little above the jasper rocks, which latter are, 
however, almost, if not entirely, awanting in this more eastern part 
of the chain. It is, in all probability, the same limestone bed which 
occurs behind the Mains of Drumtochty. At Clattering- Briggs 
the ravine divides into two, and to get a complete view we should 
examine both. We first find the clay-slate, which contains the 
limestone, intersected by several dikes of highly crystalline red 
felspar. The slate afterwards passes into something like chlorite- 
slate, or what Colonel Imrie has called, ' primitive aggregate 
rock,' and finally into mica-slate. One of the felspar beds in this 
part of the section is interesting, as containing red jasper in dots, 
which may possibly have somewhat of a common origin with that 
so beautifully exposed in Glenesk. The left hand ravine carries 
us towards the Cairn-o'- Mount; and in its course, these beds are 
well exposed ; but to perceive the structure of the higher part of 
the chain, we should follow the right hand rivulet, which descends 
from the summit of the ridge mica-slate by a ravine of consi- 
derable depth, though little conspicuous at a distance, called the 
Slack of Birnie. This gives us a full view of extensive formations 
of red felspar connected with the slate, and an explanation of the 
origin of the vast quantities of this rock distributed in boulders 
over the low country. 

In the eastern part of the parish, the slope of the range is less 
considerable, and the sandstone is more extended. Hence there

metrical, and partly barometrical, by the author of this notice, is 1514 feet. The

are fewer sections, nor, so far as we know, do they present much 
of novelty. In this portion of the range, the geographical direc- 
tion of the hills does exactly correspond with its mineral character, 
the strata having a more northerly direction than the line of ele- 
vation. The thickness of the strata is as has already been hinted 
at considerably variable. At the Church and Braes of Fordoun, 
the height of the sandstone is greater, though the strata remain 
nearly horizontal. 

Alluvial Deposits. — The alluvial deposits are not extensive, 
neither do they materially affect the original nature of the soil ; 
these deposits are chiefly on Mains of Fordoun and Pittarrow, 
and on the low grounds below Kincardine, which may rather be 
distinguished as clay loams than alluvial or haugh-land. A con- 
siderable extent of pure gravel, occasionally interspersed with 
patches of clay loam, occurs on the farm of Castleton of Kincar- 
dine, where it would appear the Ferdun, a rapid mountain stream, 
has not only carried off the clay, depositing it lower down in the 
Uoto, but brought down and lodged vast quantities of stones and 
pure gravel, of which this part of Castleton is composed, in place 
of the original soil, carried to a lower level. 

Many deposits of gravel have been formed by the different 
mountain torrents, which serve the purposes of building, and for 
repairing the public roads ; a very fine bank of gravel lies to the 
south of the manse, on the side of the public road, on the east 
end of Strath finella hill. Many others of a similar description 
might, if necessary, be pointed out. 

The whole summit of the Grampian ridge is covered with peat 
moss of different depths, but almost invariably adapted for fuel. 
There are now no mosses in the lower part of the parish, these, 
which were never of great extent as well as the bogs and swamps, 
having been converted into arable land. 

Soils. — The soil is highly favourable for agricultural purposes; 
in the lower or How district, it is composed of a ferruginous clay, of 
moderate fertility, but seldom so tenacious as to render it unfit for 
the cultivation of turnip and other green crops. A deep rich loam 
runs along the base of the hills, from one extremity of the parish 
to the other, and the rising grounds are uniformly a brown gravelly 
loam, well adapted for the grass and turnip husbandry, which is 
invariably followed. Some detached portions on the borders of 
the larger farms, consist of a black moorish soil, on a cold clav 
subsoil, and towards the hills of Glenfarquhar the land is eithei- 



76 



KINCAIIDINESIIIUK. 



of a pale yellowish colour, or black moorish soil, often on a re- 
tentive bottom. 

Zoology. — The different varieties of birds are not so numerous 
as in the south of Scotland ; but Fordoun certainly is frequented 
by as many as any other parish in the county. In the hills are 
grouse, and occasionally, but seldom, black game ; lower down, 
the woodcock is often to be met with. The snipe, plover, teal, 
and wild duck are common; but, from the want of lakes and 
marshes, these are not so plentiful as formerly. Hawks and kites 
are abundant, as also the raven, and carrion or hooded crow ; the 
common rook in myriads. Numbers of wood pigeons infest the 
district, and in winter do much injury to the turnip crops. The 
common owl and bat are frequently seen in the evenings. The 
magpie is common ; the jack-daw and jay less so. The thrush, 
blackbird, chaffinch, lark, linnet, bunting lark, with the robin and 
wren, form the principal birds of song ; the goldfinch and bull- 
finch being by no means plentiful. The stone and whin-chat are 
also to be found in the parish. The missel-thrush, fieldfare, 
snow-flake, and snow-bunting appear. in winter ; the swift, swallow, 
martin, lapwing, land-rail, and cuckoo, are the summer birds of 
passage ; the heron frequents the burns, and numbers of gulls 
may be seen at all times, particularly during the seed time. Phea- 
sants were introduced some years ago. They are not plentiful, but 
are still visible at Drumtochty, and occasionally in other parts of 
the parish. Partridges are abundant everywhere. 

Sometimes in summer, a stray roebuck may be observed on its 
passage from the sea to the highlands. The alpine or white hare 
is occasionally to be met with on the Grampians ; the common 
hare is abundant, and rabbits far too much so. Rabbits were in- 
troduced into the county about twenty years ago, and now cause 
more destruction to the crops than all other descriptions of game 
in the county. To extinguish them seems hopeless, and the calls 
for compensation by the tenantry for the injury caused by them 
are neither infrequent nor unjust. The fox still subsists by ra- 
pine, but his prey is rather rabbits than poultry, — the hen roosts 
being now far too well secured to be entered by stealth as for- 
merly. The otter is seen, though but rarely, stealing along the 
banks of a stagnant pool ; and the polecat is known rather from 
his depredations than by ocular demonstration. The hedgehog 
and weasel are occasionally met with, but the badger is supposed

extinct. Moles are kept under by one or two active and well- 
employed mole-catchers. 

Owing to the smallness of the rivers, they are only frequented 
by the trout usually found in similar streams. As mentioned 
before, the trouts are of no great size, never exceeding a few inches 
in length, and seldom a pound in weight. A stray salmon or sea- 
trout is occasionally got in the Bervie ; but trout is the general 
pursuit of the angler. 

Botany — "Among the native vegetable productions, nothing has 
been met with having great claim to notice, except LinncBa ho- 
realis, which was found in 1834 in this parish.f This plant, in- 
deed, was first discovered to be a native of Britain at Inglismaldie, 
in a neighbouring parish, and though the progress of observation 
has proved it to be more common, particularly in the northern 
counties, than was atone time supposed, botanists continue to attach 
no slio-ht interest to the two-flowered Linnsea. Most of the other 
species are of the most ordinary description, so that none of them 
deserve to be ranked among plants which are in any degree rare 
or curious, except perhaps the few that follow : Cardamine impa- 
tiens, narrow-leaved cardamine ; Circcea alpina, mountain enchant- 
er's nightshade ; Ruhus chamcemorus, cloud-berry ; Trientalis 
Europcea, European chick-weed winter-green ; Pyrola rotundi- 
folia, round-leaved winter-green ; Pyrola minor, lesser winter- 
green ; Arbutus uva-ursi, bear- berry; Vaccinium vitis-Idcea, cran- 
berry ; Hypericum pulclirum, small St John's wort ; and Parnassia 
palustris, grass of Parnassus. It ought, however, to be added, that 
it is probable Fordoun possesses botanical treasures of greater value, 
as the native plants of the parish have never, as far as is known, 
been examined with adequate attention." 

Plantations. — There are no forests or indeed plantations ex- 
ceeding the age of seventy years. The oldest plantations are per- 
haps the wood of Drumsleed, and the remains of the Garret or 
Garrold wood, on the north flank of Strath finella hill, opposite 
Drumtpchty Castle. These consist chiefly of Scotch fir and larch, 
with a few deciduous trees where the soil is favourable. There is 
some natural birch and oak coppice-wood behind Drumtochty Castle, 
and in the ravines west of it; but, with these exceptions, the whole 
plantations in the parish have been planted within the last sixty 
years. A few old trees still exist in the old village or rather coun-

ty town of Kincardine. Several respectable trees also ornament 
the old houses of Monboddo and Castleton, and in the plantations 
of Drumtochty, trees, venerable for their age and size, tower far 
above the saplings around them. There are likewise a few fine 
beeches at Phesdo ; and a considerable quantity of full-grown ash, 
birch, elm, &amp;c. shelter and adorn the church, parsonage, and vil- 
lage inn at Fordoun. During the last fifty years, a considerable 
part of the Kincardine estate, belonging to Sir John Stuart Forbes, 
Bart, has been enclosed, and many belts and plantations formed 
for ornament and shelter. At Phesdo, much was done by the late 
lamented and spirited proprietor, in planting and adorning his pro- 
perty. Many plantations of larch and Scotch fir were formed 
by the Carnegies, late proprietors of Pittarrow, which shelter and 
relieve the tameness of the surface in that part of the parish. 
Belts of larch and Scotch fir, with deciduous trees intermixed, 
were also planted by the late Mrs Burnett of Monboddo, and 
there are likewise some plantations, although of no great extent, 
around the house of Castleton. Mr Drummond, while proprietor 
of Drumtochty, planted extensively both with resinous and deci- 
duous plants, and the whole are in the most thriving state imagin- 
able. Lord Arbuthnott has lately planted about 200 acres of the 
front of Strathfinella hill, and proposes extending his operations 
so as to cover the whole front of the hill. There is thus a con- 
siderable extent of woodland in the parish ; still, from its being dis- 
posed in masses, and from the want of hedges, and particularly of 
hedge-rows, the landscape has not that rich and wooded appear- 
ance, which a more judicious disposition of the plantations would 
have produced. It may, under this head, be remarked, that both 
soil and climate are favourable to all kinds of forest trees. Oak, 
■which formerly was rather a reluctant grower, now takes freely, 
and all other kinds of deciduous trees, when judiciously planted, 
make a fair progress. Scots firs thrive well, but larches, although 
rapid growers, are observed to be short-lived, and to decay soon. 
It is, likewise, observed that forest trees of all descriptions thrive 
better with a north or north-west aspect, than with a south expo- 
sure. This is very perceptible in the glen behind Strathfinella 
hill, and in other situations, and is perhaps owing to the soil on 
the north side of the hills being generally deeper, and the plants 
being protected from the sharp sea-breezes that come from the 
south-east quarters.

II. — Civil History. 

Some notices regarding the history and antiquities of Fordouii 
may be found in the Transactions of the Society of Scottish Anti- 
quaries, in LordHailes' Annals of Scotland, in the Beauties of Scot- 
land, in Chalmers's Caledonia, in Robertson's agricultural survey 
of the county of Kincardine, and in Chalmers' Gazetteer of Scot- 
land ; but the most detailed account of the parish is the former Sta- 
tistical Report, drawn up by the late Rev. Alexander Leslie, fa- 
ther of the present incumbent. 

Traditions. — " The most remarkable are those connected with 
the residence of King Kenneth III. at Kincardine Castle, in this 
parish ; his murder, and the death of Finella. It is agreed upon 
by almost all the Scotch historians, that Kenneth was murdered by 
Finella, at or near to Kincardine Castle. The most probable ac- 
count is, that the King having put to death Finella's son, who had 
been engaged in an insurrection against him, his mother, Finella, 
who was of the royal family, and who is still spoken of in the 
Mearns as a Queen, vowed vengeance against Kenneth. Her 
castle f or residence, the site of which is still pointed out, lay 
near to the royal palace of Kincardine, and on the south end of 
the hill which is still known by her name. Near to the palace, and 
consequently near to her residence, was a large park or forest, the 
enclosures of which can still be traced in many places, and which 
even now, at this distance of time, goes by the name of the King's 
Deer or Hunting- Park. During the residence of Kenneth at 
Kincardine, who had come there on his pilgrimage to the chapel 
of St Palladius, he is said to have gone one day to hunt in this 
park or forest, and that Finella, having got the opportunity she so 
much wished for, caused two assassins to way-lay and murder him. 
She knew that suspicion would fall upon her, and attempted there- 
upon to make her escape through a forest which lay betwixt her 
house and the sea, to some place of safety on the coast ; but she 
was overtaken near to the coast, in a place called ever since Den- 
finella, where she was put to death. In corroboration of the above 
account of the murder of Kenneth, it may be mentioned that there 
was discovered under the pulpit of the old church of Fordoun, a 
large piece of freestone, 5 feet 1 inch in length, by 2 feet 11 
inches in width. On this stone are represented three figures on 
horseback, placed in a line, one behind the other, and each arm-

ed with a spear. The dress and the horses of the first and third 
mark them to be of inferior rank. The one in the middle is placed 
in a separate square, his horse is covered with a cloth, and his dress 
far superior to that of the others. At his feet, lies what may be con- 
sidered as a sceptre, or at any rate ah ornamented spear. To- 
wards one side of the stone is the figure of a hound, and at the 
other that of a boar, an animal said to have abounded at that time 
in the Scotch forests. Now, connecting this stone and the 
ficTures with the traditions respecting the murder of Kenneth, it is 
surely not improbable that it was intended to commemorate that 
event. It was natural to place such a commemorative stone in St 
Palladius' Chapel, the place to which Kenneth had either lately 
made, or was about to make a pilgrimage, when he was assassinat- 
ed ; and when the chapel was about to be stript of its furniture at 
the time of the Reformation, it was not improbable that it was then 
pushed under the pulpit of the church for preservation. In the 
Chanel there still remains a hollow stone in the wall, which proba- 
bly held the holy-water; the niche within which the statue of St 
Palladius was placed, and before which incense was burned, and a 
square place in the wall near to it, which probably enclosed the silver 
shrine with the supposed relicsof the saint. In Vol. ii.. Part 2, of the 
Transactions of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, there is a 
particular account of the stone above alluded to, drawn up by the 
late Professor Stuart of Marischal College, Aberdeen, who was 
well acquainted with the antiquities of the north of Scotland ; and 
a most accurate drawing of the stone taken by the Rev. Mr Spen- 
cer, schoolmaster, Fordoun. The monks, who had thecharge of 
the chapel, had probably been buried in it, as late y when open- 
ing up a part of the floor, it was found to be filled with bones 
placed under regular arches. There is, besides, a vault at some 

depth under ground." . • j :„ 

Maps.- Amost accurate delineation of this parish is contained in 
a map of the county, made from actual survey, by the late Mr Gar- 
den in 1774, on which are exhibited not only the natural features 
of tL county, the position and direction «f ' /.f ' 
boundaries of parishes, but with the most minute detad, the out- 
line of the diffirent estates and commons, and likewise the extent 
o the arable, pasture, and wood land. It is by far the most ac 
curate and best executed county map yet published. Most f not 
all the estates have been more recently surveyed and mapped, to 
which reference has been made in drawing up this Repo.t.

 " When the old mansion-house of Pittarrow was pulled 
down in 1802, there were discovered on the plaster of the 
great hall, to which access was had by a flight of steps, some 
paintings in a state of high preservation, the walls having been 
wainscotted, at what period is not known. The air and dust hav- 
ing thus been excluded, the colours in the paintings were as vivid 
as if they had been done only a year before. The only one of the 
paintings that may be noticed here, was that which represented 
the city of Rome, and a grand procession going to St Peter's. The 
Pope, adorned with the tiara, in his full robes of state, and mount- 
ed on a horse or mule, led by some person of distinction, was at- 
tended by a large company of cardinals, all richly dressed, and 
all uncovered. At a little distance, near to where the procession 
was to pass, and nearly in front of it, stood a white palfrey, fine- 
ly caparisoned, held by some person, also dressed and uncovered. 
Beyond this was the' magnificent Cathedral of St Peter, the 
doors of which seemed to be open to receive the procession. Be- 
low the picture was written the following lines : — 

"In Papam 

Laus tua, non tua fraus : virtus non gloria rerum, 
Scandere te fecit hoc decus eximium ; 
Pauperibus sua dat gratis, nec munera curat 
Curia Papalis, quod more percipimus. 
HsBc carmina potius legenda cancros imitando." 

The then proprietor of Pittarrow was totally ignorant of these 
paintings, when he gave orders to pull down the house." 

" Eminent Characters. — John of Fordoun, the historian, was 
either a native of the parish, or resided in it when he wrote his his- 
tory of Scotland. He is called by Bede ' venerabilis vir Domi- 
nus Joannes Fordun, Presbyter.' Although the biographical dic- 
tionaries give very little information about him, yet it is generally 
believed that he was a priest in the church of Fordoun in 1377, 
because he dedicated his history to Cardinal Wardlaw, who at that 
time was Archbishop of Glasgow. The time of his death is un- 
known. There are MS. Latin copies of his history in the Bodleian 
Library, in the British Museum, and in the Advocates' Library, 
Edinburgh. It is said that all the convents in Scotland, and some 
in England, had transcribed copies of it, in such high estimation 
was it held.

by Cardinal Beaton, , on the lat of March 1546, was a younger son 
of Wishart of Pittarrow. The Wisharts were an ancient and re- 
spectable family in the parish of Fordoun in 1399 ; how much 
earlier is not known, and they possessed that property till after the 
commencement of the last century. It is unnecessary to give any 
detail of George Wishart's life, opinions, steady and exemplary 
faith, and heroic Christian patience under the cruel sufferings and 
barbarous death so shamefully inflicted on him, as all these are 
fully detailed in the histories of that period ; but it may be observ- 
ed, that his example was not lost on his own family, for they ap- 
pear to have, soon after, thrown off the yoke of the Church of Rome, 
and embraced the doctrines of the glorious Reformation. 

" The Honourable James Burnett, Lord Monboddo, one of the 
Judges in the Court of Session, was a native of and a proprietor in 
the parish of Fordoun, and one of the first who turned his atten- 
tion to the modern improvements in agriculture. He went hand 
.in hand with Mr Barclay of Ury in this important work, and by 
his example, his perseverance, his unwearied exhortations and ad- 
vices to the farmers around him, and the attention he paid them, 
he soon made a great change on his own farm and estate, and on 
the farms and estates around him. As an affectionate husband 
and father, as a liberal and encouraging landlord, as a warm and 
steady friend to the British Constitution, as an able and faithtul 
judo-e, and a man of science, as an excellent classical scholar, as a 
grammarian, and intimately acquainted with the literature and 
philosophy of Greece and Rome, he was not excelled by any m the 
last age. His work on the Origin and Progress of Language, the 
first volume of which was published in 1771, the second m 1773, 
and the third in 1 776, has placed him high in the rank of the emi- 
nent literati of the last century. He was born in 17 14, married in 
.1760, was deprived of his lady by death in 1766, was raised to the 
Bench in 1767, and died in 1 799. His beautiful and accomplish- 
ed daughter. Miss Eliza Burnett, the constant nurse and compa- 
nion of her parent, whose sweetness of manners, benevolence ot 
heart, excellent principles, and religious feelings, justly gamed her 
universal admiration, died of a consumption at the age of twenty- 
five Her affectionate parent, whose life was bound up in hers, 
rapidly declined after her death ; and he often declared that nothing 
but those glorious hopes of immortal life through Christ, which the 
Gospel sets before us, could have supported him under the heavy

" Dr Beattie was for several j'ears schoolmaster at Fordoun, before 
he removed to Aberdeen. At Fordoun, many of his smaller poems 
were composed. See an excellent life of Dr Beattie, drawn up by

Professor Beattie, born at Fordoun 16th April 1767, son of 
David Beattie, elder brother of Dr James Beattie, author of the 
Minstrel, — was educated at the school of Laurencekirk, and 
entered Marischal College, Aberdeen, November 1780, and be- 
came A. M. in April 1784. He studied theology till 1787-8, when 
he taught the classical department of the second class in Marischal 
College, as assistant to Dr George Skene ; and was appointed Pro- 
fessor of Civil and Natural History in that College, and inducted 22d 
October 1 788. Professor Beattie taught twenty-one sessions with 
great applause, and was a most effective and enthusiastic teacher, 
to whom good pupils were greatly attached. He died on Thursday 
4th October 1810. A monument was erected to his memory, in 
1813, by a subscription among his pupils. 

Alexander Crombie, Esq. of Phesdo, one of the eminent cha- 
racters of whom this parish can boast, is mentioned particularly 
afterwards. 

Land-owners. — The land-oveners or proprietors in this parish 
are, The Earl of Kintore ; Viscount Arbuthnott ; Sir John Stuart 
Forbes of Pitsligo and Fettercairn, Baronet; Dr Crombie of 
Phesdo; Mr Burnett of Monboddo ; Mr Mitchell Nicolson of 
Glenbervie : Mr Gammel of Drumtochty ; Mr Forbes of Castle-

Kinloch of Kair. The feuars of Auchinblae hold of Lord Kintore 
and Mr Burnett of Monboddo. 

Parochial Registers. — The earliest entry in the baptism regis- 
ter is dated June 4, 1693; in the session-register, September 9, 
1747. The parish registers have been regularly kept since then. 

Antiquities, f — " On the farm of Castleton of Kincardine, be- 
longing to Sir John Stuart Forbes of Pitsligo and Fettercairn, 
Bart., stand the ruins of the Castle or Royal Palace of Kincar- 
dine. This castle either gave its name to the county, or took its 
name from the county in which it is placed. There are no re- 
cords stating the period when this castle was built, or when it was 
last occupied. It was a royal palace previous to the death of

Kenneth III. in 994, for it was occcupied by that monarch at the 
time of his murder by Finella. This palace or castle seems to 
have been a place of considerable strength. A morass surround- 
ed it, a great part of which has been drained within the last thirty 
years. It stands on the termination of a small ridge, at an eleva- 
tion of about sixty or eighty feet above the adjoining meadows, 
and has a very commanding view of the most beautiful part of the 
How o' the Mearns. It appears to have been of a quadrangular 
shape, of which little now remains except the foundations of some 
walls, built with all the solidity common in former ages. It was 
in Kincardine Palace, as Lord Hailes says, Note, Vol. i. of his 
Annals, page 293, 3d edition, that John Baliol resigned his 
crown to Edward I. of England, July 2, 1296; and he quotes the 
record of this in Rhymer's Foedera, Tom. ii. page 718. As this 
is the last event of importance on record connected with the his- 
tory of this palace, it is not improbable that it was destroyed in the 
wars betwixt the Scotch and English which followed that event. 
The village of Kincardine, now diminished to a few houses, once 
extended from the ground at the foot of the castle to near Fetter- 
cairn House. It was the county town, and the residence of the 
sheriff, who held his court there until the reign of James VI., 
when it was removed to Stonehaven. The village had its chapel, 
and its burying-ground near the chapel, its west-port, and its east- 
port, and its cross, the site of which is still marked near to where 
the chapel stood. The cross was removed to the market-place of 
Fettercairn about a century ago. The names of the fields con- 
tiguous to the castle or palace still retain an allusion to a royal re- 
sidence. One park is called « The King's Park," in which, some- 
time ago, a falcon's head was found. Another, as tradition says, 
was called " The Chancellor's Park ;" and a large tract of ground, 
extending from near the castle to the Grampians, and part of the 
enclosures of which is still visible from the road which leads to 
the top of the Cairn o' Mount, is known by the name of i he 
Royal,' or ' King's Deer,' or ' Hunting-Park,' and probably 
was the park in which Kenneth was assassinated. Opposite to 
the Castle of Kincardine, and at the distance of a few hundred 
yards only from it, is the farm of ' Gallowhill,' commonly called 
 Gallowhill Stone,' from a large stone which is said to mark 
the place where criminals were executed. A road lay from the 
castle across the morass to this place ; and in enlarging the roads 
throuo-h that farm, several stone chests have been found, of coarse

workmanship, but coiitainino- the skeletons of bodies laid out at 
full length, and the bones untouched." 

On the opposite side of the valley, on the west flank of Strath- 
finella Hill, near the Mill of Kincardine, and overlooking the 
Ferdun, stands as tradition reports Finella Castle or Green 
Castle, which gave name to the hill, on the slope of which it is 
situated. It is placed on the top of the east bank of the Ferdun. 
Above the average height of this brae or bank, and on a distinct 
platform of mould earth, a circular basin is raised to the height of 
30 or 40 feet, being in all 80 or 100 feet above the river. The 
interior of the castle forms an enclosure of perhaps nearly one- 
fourth of an acre in extent ; and is surrounded by a green mound, 
of from 20 to 25 feet in height : the opening is towards the north- 
east. 

. -f- " Near Fordoun House is part of a camp or Roman station ; it 
is about 90 yards long by 50 wide. Of this camp nothing now 
remains except the prsetorium ; but in the younger days of the 
present clergyman, he found old people who could trace to him 
a considerable part of the outlines of the camp, which were most 
extensive, and had been defended by triangular forts, at the diffe- 
rent corners, by outposts, and by a deep morass at the lower ex- 
tremity. It was capable of containing a large army. These out- 
works have now been levelled, and the morass has been turned 
into a dry and very productive field. In trenching that morass, 
the heads of several Roman spears were found, one of which is 
now in the possession of John Carnegie, Esq. Redhall. A gold 
ring, similar to what we are told the Roman knights wore, was 
also found ; and a number of bones have been dug up in various 
places near and at a greater distance from the camp. Part of 
these were enclosed in rough unhewn stone chests, and fell to dust 
when they were exposed to the air, — part of them buried under 
cairns, and severals were laid in the open fields, and were acci- 
dentally turned up by the plough. In those urns which were found 
entire, there were generally a considerable quantity of calcined or 
half-burnt bones. The urns themselves were of clay, of very rough 

 From the circular shape of this artificial inoiuid and its material, it has been 
doubted whether it ever was a residence, as here stated, but rather one of those Pict- 
ish or British forts, commonly called rings, and found in similar situations in other 
parts of Scotland. To accommodate this theoiy to our historical accounts, a pro- 
bable site may be found for Finella's Castle in the remains of a vitrified structure 
near Balbegno, in the adjoining parish.

manufacture, but retaining the marks of the strings with which 
they had been bound round, probably when forming.  

" In a retired glen, called Friars Glen, above Drumtochty, and 
closs to Finella hill, there are the foundations of a small friary. 
The lands were granted by charter to the Carmelites by James 
Fraser of Friendraught, 1st May 1402, and this charter was con- 
firmed by King Robert, 12th October 1403. A more secluded and 
retired situation for a friary could not have been chosen. A small 
green hill was on one side, and a similar one on the other ; the 
Grampians to the north and Finella hill to the south. A beauti- 
ful, clear stream of water ran past the friary, and there was room 
in the glen for a garden, and pasture on the hills for a few sheep. 
The feu-duty of this glen was made over by Earl Marischal to 
the Marischal College of Aberdeen, and sold within the last thirty 
years to the proprietor of Drumtochty. 

" On the hill above Newlands, there are the remains of what is 
commonly called a Druidical Temple, and a similar one in a clump 
of trees near Castleton, on the estate of William Forbes, Esq. 

" On the farm of Mondynes, in the east end of this parish, or 
Monethynes, as that farm was originally called, there is a large 
stone erected in a conspicuous part of a field, evidently intended 
to commemorate some remarkable event. This stone, in the 
younger days of the tenant of West Mondynes, was called the 
• King's stone,' and a field, near the farm-house, is still known by 
the name of ' Duncan's shade' or ' field.' Professor Stuart, already 
alluded to, has, in the above-mentioned volume of Transactions, 
shewn, by a number of circumstances therein stated, that that stone, 
in all probability, commemorates the death of King Duncan II. 
who is said to have been murdered by the Earl or Thane of the 
Mearns. 

" A few old coins of our James's, both copper and silver, have 
been dug up in different places of the parish, but none of them of 
any value." 

Modern Buildings. — There is no mansion-house on the estate 
of Kincardine, the proprietor. Sir John Stuart Forbes, Bart, 
residing at Fettercairn House, in the adjoining parish ; but much 
was done for the improvement of the estate by the late Sir John 
Stuart, Baronet, and after him by the late Sir William Forbes of 

 Means have now been adopted by the noble proprietor to preserve this Roman 
camp from being farther encroached upon by the plough, not the least persevering 
of innovators.

Pitsligo, Bart, who erected a splendid mansion in the old English 
style, on that part of the estate situate in Fettercairn parish, in the 
Slatistical Account of which parish it naturally falls to be noticed. 

Phesdo.— This estate, with that of Pitnamoon, in this parish, 
and Thornton, in the parish of Marykirk, was purchased, about 
thirty years ago, by the late public spirited proprietor, Alexander 
Crombie, Esq. Advocate in Aberdeen, who employed his occasion- 
al intervals of relaxation from the pursuit of a lucrative and labo- 
rious profession, in improving and embellishing it in every way that 
wealth, guided by taste, could direct. Possessed of a sound judg- 
ment, a retentive memory, invariable sweetness of temper, and un- 
wearied application to business, few have led a more useful and 
honourable hfe, or died more respected and lamented than Mr 
Crombie. The friend of the rich and powerful, who confided in 
his judgment and integrity, and were directed by his counsel, 
he was no less the friend of the poor and afflicted. To him the 
humble always had access, were invariably received with kindness, 
obtained assistance, advice and protection. None ever were known 
in anger to leave him, and few but retired happier than when they 
entered his presence. Hours were daily employed by him in set- 
tling differences, adjusting disputes, and in transacting gratuitously 
the business of those, who could not pay a fee to others for doing 
it. Upon completing his purchase, Mr Crombie found the only 
shelter to his old and ruinous mansion was a few old firs, and about 
a dozen of beech trees, at a considerable distance from the house. 
Marshes covered with rushes, and an undivided common approach- 
ed within a few yards of his door. To drain, to plant, and build was 
his delight for the last thirty years of his life, and under his hand, 
not only the mansion-house and grounds around it, but the whole 
estate assumed a different aspect, and Phesdo is now not only one 
of the most elegant houses, but the grounds are among the most 
ornamented and best sheltered in the county. The house erect- 
ed by Mr Crombie, at great expense, is a most substantial fabric. 
It is built of granite, brought from Aberdeen, a distance of thirty- 
miles, and is a plain Grecian building, with a fluted Doric portico. 
It stands on a small knoll, at the base of Strathfinella Hill, sur- 
rounded by plantations, tastefully disposed, commanding a fine pros- 
.pect of the Grampians on the right, and a rich and extensive view 
of Strathmore in front. The approach, garden, and offices are 
judiciously laid out, and complete in every respect. In addition 
to this, the whole of the waste land on the estate has been reclaim-

ed or planted. Many plantations and roads have been formed or 
improved, the burns and water-courses straighted, and the farm- 
houses, cottages, and steadings rebuilt or repaired, so as to be su- 
perior to most in the county. 

On Pittarrow there is now no mansion-house. A fine old tower, 
which formed a prominent object in the " How," was pulled down 
a few years ago. 

Fordoun House, Viscount Arbuthnott's, is a better sort of farm- 
house ; it is in tolerable repair, and, with a moderate outlay, might 
be made a pleasant residence, as the situation is most eligible. 
The house with the farm is let to a tenant. 

Monboddo is an old house, but in tolerable repair. The situa- 
tion is good, and the plantations judiciously laid out, and in a 
thriving state. This place derives importance, from having been 
the birth place and patrimonial estate of the late Lord Monboddo, 
His daughter, the late proprietrix, Mrs Burnett, did much in im- 
proving the estate, which now belongs to her son, who resides at 
Monboddo. 

Castleton, William Forbes, Esq. although a mere farm-house, 
yet from the disposition of the garden, and a few remaining plan- 
tations, this place still retains something of the appearance of a 
mansion. It is occupied, along with the farm, by a tenant. 

The only remaining mansion to be noticed is Drumtochty 
Castle, which, although the last described, is certainly the first in 
importance. The small property of Drumtochty formerly belong- 
ed to Mrs Mackenzie, who inhabited a snug and unpretending 
cottage, on the site of which the present mansion stands. Situated 
on a steep bank, on the north side of a narrow valley, enveloped 
by plantations of considerable extent, in which the graceful birch 
predominates, and surrounded by lofty mountains, it may be 
questioned if the view of the present lordly mansion ever gave 
half the pleasure to one possessor of sound judgment and taste, 
which the former humble cottage afforded. The cottage seemed 
just adapted for the size of the glen, and the place it occupied, 
and was then well known to all as the abode of worth and un- 
pretending hospitality. The estate was purchased about thirty 
years ago by George Harley Drummond, Esq. of the well known 
banking-house in Charing Cross, who laid out vast sums on build- 
ing, in planting, and enclosing the estate. Under his direction, a 
house was erected in the style of castellated Gothic, from designs 



POKDOUN, 



89 



by Mr Gillespie Graham, architect, at an expense, it is said, of 
L. 30,000. Plantations were formed with much taste, skirting the 
glens, and covering the sides of the mountains, bogs drained, ap- 
proaches made, and porter-lodges erected ; walks, many miles in 
extent, were carried through the plantations, and the greater part 
of the estate substantially enclosed with stone fences and hedges. 
A residence was thus formed of a peculiar character. The house 
stands a few feet above the Luther, here a brawling stream, on a 
small platform, scooped out of a steep, indeed nearly a perpendi- 
cular hill, covered with wood. Below is a meadow extending along 
and filling the whole bottom of the glen for a couple of miles. In 
front, is Strath Finella Hill, the base of which is clothed with 
thriving plantations, rising to the height of 700 or 800 feet above 
the narrow valley. Behind the castle is a bank, which rises almost 
perpendicularly, and is covered with copse and full-grown trees, 
and beyond this, at a very little distance, are the Grampians, the 
sides of which, as well as the different ravines, formed by the 
mountain streams, are finely fringed with natural birch. The house 
and grounds are much visited by strangers, being, strictly speak- 
ing, the only show place in the parish, and, excepting the " Burn" 
in the county. The estate now belongs to Mr Gammell, who is 
seldom resident. 

Spinning -Mill. — There is only one spinning-mill in the parish, 
viz. for flax, at Auchinblae. This mill was erected about forty 
years ago, by a much respected and public-spirited individual, the 
late Mr Kinnear. 

The materials used for building are freestone, generally of a 
reddish colour, with which the parish is plentifully supplied from 
quarries in different parts of it. The freestone obtained is only 
adapted for ruble work, — most of the stones for rybats, lintels, &amp;c. 
being brought from Woodston or Laurieston, on the coast-side. 
Drumtochty Castle is veneered or faced up, on the outside, with a 
beautiful blue schist, found on Dallavaird, in Glenbervie parish ; 
but there can be little doubt but the same vein runs along the 
base of the Grampians through this parish. 

III. — Population. 
A return of the population appears to have been made by Dr 
Webster in 1755, another by Mr Garden, when constructing his 
valuable map of the county in 1774, and another by the Rev. 
Alexander Leslie, the former incumbent, in 179L

No great increase or decrease has taken place in the population 
of this parish. Being, until lately, purely agricultural, any varia- 
tion that occurred must have been occasioned by the enlarged size 
of the farms, and the decrease of the cot-towns, more particularly 
of Kincardine. The reduction thus caused in the agricultural po- 
pulation has been more than compensated by the extension or ra- 
ther creation of the village of Auchinblae, the only village in the 
parish. But although the greater part of the inhabitants of this 
village are employed in trade or manufactures, still many of them 
occupy crofts or village acres, and may be considered as belong- 
ing to the agricultural population, which, it would thus appear, 
has not materially been diminished by converting the small farms 
into larger ones.

Two noblemen, viz. the Earl of Kintore and Viscount Arbuth-

making the proprietors of land amount to 1 1. The rental of each 
greatly exceeds L. 50 yearly. The only heritors or individuals of 
fortune resident are, Dr Crombie of Phesdo ; Mr Burnett of Mon- 
boddo ; Mr Carnegie of Redhall ; and occasionally Captain Gam- 
mell of Drumtochty. Two mansions, viz. Fordoun House and 
Whiteriggs, are let to farmers.

but can read and speak a little. 

Character of the People. — The people are in general regular in 
their religious duties, and orderly in their conduct. They are 
cleanly in their persons, and dress well, — indeed, it is a common 
observation, made by strangers, that nowhere is a more respectable, 
better-looking or better dressed congregation to be seen in a 
country church, than in that of Fordoun. Considerable amend- 
ment has taken place in the cleanliness and economy of both farm- 
houses and cottages, but as to ornament there is still much room 
for improvement. The tenantry are a highly respectable class, 
and their manner of living is similar to that of the better sort of 
farmers in other parts of Scotland. 

Amongst the agricultural labourers, marriages are not contract- 
ed at a very early period. There is a general desire to save some- 
thing to procure " providing" for the bride, and to enable the 
bridegroom to furnish his cottage in a tolerably comfortable man- 
ner. In endeavouring to do this, and to postpone their union un- 
til prudence should sanction it, passion sometimes gets the better 
of principle, and the consequjsnces are obvious. The average 
number of illegitimate children, born yearly in the parish, is 4, 
exclusive of those who are rendered legitimate by the subsequent 
union of their parents. 

The people are regular and decorous in their religious duties, 
and generally moral in their conduct ; and although that keenness 
for disputation on religious subjects, so common in the west and 
south of Scotland, does not prevail here, still their sense of reli- 
gion, and its influence in promoting our happiness here, and its 
necessity to our salvation hereafter, is not less sensibly felt or de- 

• It is customary in this parish, and indeed in the district, to designate farmers 
not by their Christian names, but by the names of the farms they occupy, or contrac- 
tions of them. Thus the tenant of Pitnamoon is familiarly known hy the name of 
Pitnamoon or Prime of Westmoston by that of WysU; Odmiston, CarnbeKg, 
Drumtochty, Drumsleed, &amp;c. respectively by Oddie, Cirnic, Drums and Drummic. 
The practice of designating proprietors by the names of their estates is likewise com- 
mon in the northern counties of Scotland. ««-vi,i. com-

voutly acknowledted. Their respect and regard for their pastor 
is unbounded. During the long period that the former clergy- 
man, and, since his death, the present incumbent have been minis- 
ters of Fordoun, they have reason to be proud of the support re- 
ceived from all classes in the discharge of their duties, and, as a 
proof of their success, it may here be stated, that in 1801, there 
were 257 Dissenters in the parish, — at present the whole Dis- 
senters of every description are reduced to 89, of whom only 8 
are Seceders. 

A marked alteration has taken place in the reading habits of 
the people. For the histories of Wallace and Bruce, of Robin 
Hood and Little John, George Buchanan, Jack the Giant-killer, 
Leper the Tailor, and many other worthies that formerly amused 
the inmates of the smithy, the cottage and farm-kitchen, books of 
history, travels, voyages, biography, agriculture, and, above all, 
books on religious subjects, are now substituted. The parish li- 
brary furnishes an ample store of these, and the number of readers 
who apply for books, especially in the winter season, is very great. 

Smuggling is now happily unknown, nor, as in some other dis- 
tricts, has poaching been substituted for it.

Agriculture. — Table showing the extent and disposition of 
lands iA the parish. 

Uncultivated 
Arable. Wood. ground. Total. 
Imperial acres, . . 11,330 2159 14,246 27,735 

The undivided common land may amount to about 200 acres ; 
of the waste land, capital could not be profitably employed, in 
bringing much into cultivation, — probably not more than 300 
or 400 acres in the parish would pay the expense of improve- 
ment. 

In forming plantations, larch, Scots fir, and spruce are gene- 
rally planted, either for nurses, or for a crop ; when planted as 
nurses, the plantation is generally filled up with oak, ash, elm, 
beech, birch, sycamore, &amp;c. ; little regard being paid how far the 
soil may be adapted to their growth. As the deciduous trees 
grow up, the resinous trees are thinned out to make room for 
them, but invariably too little attention is paid to pruning the 
trees intended to form the crop. The value of thinnings, and of 
wood cut down and sold in the parish, does not exceed L. 180 
yearly. 

Rent, Sfc. — The valued rent of Fordoun is L. 7129, 5s. 4d. Scots. 
The real rent, taking into account the rise that will be obtained, in 
two orthree years, upon the expiry ofsome leases of fifty-seven years' 
duration, will not be less than L. 11,420 Sterling; butupon this rental 
no great increase can be anticipated for many years. A moderate 
deduction being made from the gross rental for the sheep pasture 
in the Grampians, the rent per imperial acre of the arable land 
will be about 19s. 6d. 

Few or no cattle or sheep are taken in for grazing by the head, 
grass fields being usually taken for that purpose ; but the main- 
tenance of a cow is estimated to be worth L. 6, 10s. yearly, of 
which L.3, 10s. may be the proportion for the summer six months. 
The summer grazing of an ox or bullock may be L. 2, 5s. ; and for 
the whole year, L. 4. A full-grown sheep may be grazed for the 
whole year for 2s. 6d. in the Grampians ; but in enclosed lands, 
the maintenance for the year will vary from 6s. to 10s. ; but if fed

off on turnips, a greater remuneration will be expected. It is, how- 
ever, difficult to state with precision the expense of grazing or main- 
tenance of any kind of bestial, as farmers are in the practice either 
of rearing or purchasing the stock for their farms ; and much must 
depend upon the way in which bestial are bought or reared, and 
the state of the markets when they are sold. 

Wages. — The rate of labour may be as under : half-yearly ser- 
vants : unmarried ploughmen from L. 6 to L. 8, 10s., with two 
pecks of oatmeal weekly, and an allowance of milk and potatoes, 
with lodging and fuel, generally in a bothie. Unmarried half-year 
labourers are from L. 5 to L. 6; boys from L. 1, 10s. to L. 3, with 
the usual allowance of meal and milk in the bothie. Married men- 
servants are engaged by the year. They generally get a house and 
garden, maintenance for a cow, and L. 8 to L. 10 of wages, with 
six and a-half bolls of oatmeal ; they also get an allowance of po- . 
tatoes or ground for raising them, with a few barrels of coals and 
brushwood for fuel. Women servants for farm-work, if engaged 
for six months, get in summer from L. 8 to L. 4, 10s., and in win- 
ter about L. 2, with victuals in the kitchen ; and if engaged by the 
day for farm-work, 8d. in winter, and lOd. in summer, but without 
victuals or lodging. 

Harvest work is very often let by the acre, at from 7s. to 10s. 
for cutting, binding, and stooking when cut by the hand ; and from 
5s. to 7s. when cut by the scythe ; and when cut by the threave, 
about 3d. In none of these cases do the labourers get victuals. 
When shearers are engaged for the harvest, the wages for men is 
about L. -2, 5s. ; and for women, L. I, 15s., with victuals and beer. 
In addition to cutting the grain crop, they are usually bound to 
assist in taking up the potatoe crop. 

Farm-labourers per day, in winter, Is. 2d.; in summer. Is. 8d. ; 
and dykers, ditchers, hedgers, quarriers, &amp;c. from Is. 6d. to 2s. 6d. 
according to the season of the year and the activity of the labourer. 

There are few or no home manufacturers in this parish. Little 
linen is made, and that not for the market; neither are any coarse 
woollen cloths manufactured. Strong cotton cloth or Irish linen 
is used for shirts by the ploughman, and his jacket and trowsers 
consist of velvet or west of England cloth, his great-coat only be- 
ing of Scotch manufacture. 

The prices of raw produce may be as under : flax, of which little 
is raised for sale, costs per stone of 141b. 7s. ; wool, from 7s. to

Rate of Labour and Mechanical Work. — Masons per day in sum- 
mer, 2s. 6d. to 3s. ; in winter, Is. lOd. ; carpenters, in summer, 
2s. 3d. in winter Is. 8d., all without victuals. Plasterers and slaters 
generally work by the piece. Ruble mason-work, when carriages 
and price of materials are included, generally costs per rood of 36 
ells, from L. 6, 10.s. to L. 7, 10s. When materials and carriages 
are afforded, the price of labour per rood is from L. 1, 10s. to 
L. 1, 16s., with an additional charge for hewn work, levelling the 
walls, &amp;c. 

A double horse cart costs from L. 10, 10s. to L. 12; a plough, 
L. 3 to L. 3, 10s. ; and a pair of harrows, L. 1, 2s. 

Live-Stock. — The horses employed in husbandry approach nearly 
to the Clydesdale breed, andmuch pains havelately been taken to im- 
prove them, both in strength and symmetry, by the introduction of 
prize stallions from the west of Scotland. The prevailing colour is 
black, but many pairs of bay horses may be seen in the parish, and 
occasionally a chestnut or strong grey of the old German extrac- 
tion. Ploughs are invariably drawn by two horses, and double 
horse carts still are used, although carts drawn by one horse are 
more frequent than formerly. 

The breed of cattle is the pure Angus or Aberdeen polled 
breed, — the principal points of both being nearly the same. Great 
care has of late been taken to improve this breed ; and nowhere 
in Scotland are finer cattle to be seen than here, — all crosses or 
mixture with the Galloway, the short-horned, or any other breed, 
being carefully avoided, and, with the exception of the stock be- 
longing to one individual, there are no cross-bred cattle in the pa- 
rish. In regard to the exception alluded to, the cross is between 
a short-horned bull and the Aberdeen or Angus cows,— they are 
reared under favourable circumstances, and the produce is entirely 
fed and sold by the breeder, so that there is little danger of the 



96 



KINCARDINESHIRE. 



cross being extended to a remote degree. Many objections are 
urged against the general introduction, into the north of Scotland, 
of the Durham or short-horned breed of cattle. They no doubt, 
upon " good keep," rise to a greater weight, and feed at an earher 
age ; but they do require this, and they cannot travel any distance 
to market, either in a lean or fat condition. In the London mar- 
ket they sell at least Id. per lb. below the Aberdeen or Angus ox, 
and in a dull market, they remain in the hands of the salesman at 
least until his Angus fat are disposed of. Care must also be taken 
to preserve the purity of the breed, as the produce of a cross is ge- 
nerally the most coarse and unshapely animal possible. On the 
other hand, the Aberdeen and Angus cattlepossess almost every good 
property. Their temper is nearly equal to that of the Durham ox ; 
if well kept from their infancy, they rise to a great size, and will 
fatten when rising only three years old, although, it must be ad- 
mitted, not with the same facility as the pure short-horned breed or 
first cross from it. When fat, they will travel a great distance to 
market, to Edinburgh and Glasgow, at least 100 miles, and when 
sold for the road, their first halt is usually in Leicestershire. The 
practice, now become common, of sending fat cattle to London by 
steam vessels, has already materially influenced the cattle trade in 
this district. Instead of the greater part of the growth of the pa- 
rish being bought up by dealers in the spring or mid-summer mar- 
kets, and carried up to England to be grazed and fed off, many of 
the farmers now feed all the cattle they rear. The best of them are 
carried to London by sea, where they fetch a high price, the re- 
mainder being bought up for the Glasgow and Edinburgh markets, 
where they also find a ready sale. In Glasgow, particularly, the 
Angus cattle form the prime fat in the market. , 
The sheep are entirely confined to the Grampian range; they 
are generally of the black-faced or mountain breed, and the usual 
care is taken to improve the stock by purchasing lambs or year- 
lings at the Linton and Lanark fairs. About 600 black-faced 
wedders are bought in by the farmers, and fed off on turnips, and 
this practice is yearly extending; they are, as in other districts 
fed on turnip, to which bone manure has been applied. About 
690 of different descriptions are bought in and grazed, par t y m 
the glens and partly in enclosed land, during summer and these 
are sold either as fat to the butcher, or to farmers to be fed in wuvr 
Of late, some of the Cheviot breed have been introduced, the value 
of the wool being now an object to the breeder.

Pig-s form a very considerable article of produce, and the breed 
is excellent. Fat pigs are sold to the pork-curers in Montrose and 
Stonehaven. By them the pork is pickled, and generally sent to 
the London market. 

Husbandry. — The rotation usually followed is the five-shift course, 
viz. 1. turnip and potatoes, &amp;c. ; 2. barley ; 3. grass ; 4. grass ; and 
5. oats. Where the strength of the land warrants, the four-shift 
course is adopted, and on some farms the seven-shift course is pre- 
ferred, viz. turnip, barley, pasture three years, and followed by 
two successive white crops ; but these rotations are only exceptions, . 
the five-shift course being that generally followed. A small pro- 
portion of the break, intended for fallow and green crop, is allot- 
ted for potatoes, the remainder being generally turnips. When 
the quantity of dung on the farm is insufficient to manure the 
break, the deficiency is supplied by the application of bone manure, 
almost the greatest ixiodern discovery in agriculture. The turnips 
raised by bone manure are fed off by sheep. Barley, it will be 
seen, is thus extensively grown, wheat and beans not entering into 
the rotation ; and flax can scarcely be said to be cultivated. All 
the lighter operations of farm work, such as hoeing, raking, reap- 
ing, spreading dung, assisting in the barn, are performed by fe- 
males, whose ruddy appearance indicates the healthy nature of 
their employment. 

The crop is partly cut down by the sickle and partly by the 
scythe, the last method of cutting, in consequence of the difficulty 
of procuring reapers, becoming yearly more prevalent. Although 
the appearance of the crop, both in stook and stack, is rather 
rough and slovenly, still those who have made trial of both me- 
thods affirm that both grain and straw are taken up as well, in 
every respect, by mowing as by the sickle, and owing to its being 
less compressed in the sheaf, is ready for the stack in much less time 
than grain cut by the hand. Ten people accustomed to the 
work will cut down, take up and stook, on an average, five impe- 
rial acres daily. 

Improvements, — Although no improvements, on agreat scale, have 
been executed in this parish lately, still, for the last thirty years, the 
progress of draining the wet land, and reclaiming the waste ground, 
has been pursued with much ardour, and in this laudable under- 
taking, both landlord and tenant have been unremitting in their 
exertions. Lime was formerly more liberally applied than at pre- 
sent; perhaps the difficulties with which the agricultural interest 

KINCARDINE. 



98 



KINCARDINESHIRE. 



has had to contend for some years past, may have prevented the 
application of so expensive a stimulant, and probably it may, m 
some measure, be superseded by the application of bone manure. 
Both are most favourable to the production of grass, but the bone 
manure at the same time secures a crop of turnip, which lime 
does not. 

Leases. — The general duration of leases is nineteen years, and, 
to the credit of both landlord and tenant, they are generally re- 
newed between the parties. 

Farm-Buildings.— "V\\e farm-buildings may be considered as 
substantial, and nearly sufficient for the accommodation of the 
farms. The farm-houses are generally two stories high, with a 
kitchen attached ; others are in the cottage style, and only one 
storey : they are almost invariably well finished and slated, and 
furnished in a style conducive to comfort. The steadings are 
also slated, or partly so ; and perhaps in no parish of the same ex- 
tent, has the comfort and convenience of the tenants been more 
attended to. 

Obstacles to Improvement.— The greatest obstacles to improvement 
are the want of enclosures, and the want of shelter ; and although 
around the proprietors' residences, there is a considerable extent of 
planting and of enclosed ground, still the parish may be considered 
as deficient in this respect. Thorn hedges have not succeeded well ; 
perhaps the soil is not sufficiently strong to rear them, so as to form 
complete fences, but it is to be apprehended that the mode of treat- 
ment has been far from judicious. As a substitute for thorns, 
whin hedges have been partially introduced. Several enclosures 
have been formed by stone dikes ; but these are very limited, as 
there is a deficiency of field stones for erecting fences, and even 
for the necessary purposes of drainage; and most of the freestone 
quarries are on the sides of the ditFerent ridges that project out 
from the Grampian range, and at a considerable distance from 
many parts of the parish. Both stone dikes and thorn hedges 
form very expensive fences, altogether beyond a tenant's means, 
and often that of the landlord. Thorns require to be constantly 
cleaned and pruned, and to be protected for a period of years by 
paling Whins form a cheap and a pretty effectual fence ; but 
objections are made to them, particularly on account of the ten- 
dency they have to spread and overrun the grass-fields btrong 
belts and hedge-rows for the purpose of shelter are much wanted, 



l-'ORDOUN, 



99 



for protecting the fields from the gales that blow from the Gram- 
pians, and from the sharp easterly sea-breezes. 

As the whole of Fordoun parish is tolerably well watered,— the 
soil well adapted for grazing, there cannot be a doubt that its 
productive qualities would be greatly increased by enclosing'nd 
planting in a judicious manner. To do this, however, on a great 
scale, the combined efforts of landlords and tenants are requisite, 
and the stone-dike, the thorn, and whin hedge should be resorted 
to as circumstances required. On a lease of nineteen years, the 
enclosing and planting ought to be done at the landlords' expense, 
the tenant paying a certain rate of interest. If the lease is ex- 
tended to twenty-seven or thirty years, the tenant might contribute 
his share of the expense. If the fence is of stone, the tenant 
might perform the carriage, — if of thorns with ditch and dike, he 
ought, at least, to clean, prune, and partly to protect, and if an 
earthen dike, with whins on the summit, the tenant undoubtedly 
should take charge of the fence after the landlord has completed it. 

There being a scarcity of stones for draining, tiles might be 
advantageously used. The proprietor should pay the prime cost 
of the tiles, the tenant paying the interest, besides cutting the 
drain, carrying and laying the tiles, and covering in the surface. 

In general, farm-buildings are erected at the landlord's expense, 
the tenant contributing as his share only the carriage of materials, 
or the expense thereof ; but on one or two estates, a good deal 
more than this is left to be done by the tenant, a practice which 
cannot be too much reprobated, as withdrawing a part of the te- 
nant's capital from its more legitimate purpose, — the improve- 
ment of his land. 

There are several quarries of freestone in the parish, whicli are 
fully adequate to supply materials for its architectural purposes, 
particularly for ruble work. It is difficult to say what the yearly 
produce of these quarries may amount to, as they are in the hands 
of the proprietors, who only dispose of the surplus produce after 
supplying the necessary demands of their estates ; perhaps the 
whole amount obtained for stones actually sold does not exceed 
L, 120 or L. 140 yearly. 

There are no fisheries in the parish, the rivers being only of 
value in so far as they serve for spawning-ground for the salmon.

This may appear a small sum applicable for rent, expense of

that the tenant's family, servants, horses, &amp;c. are maintained, and 
seed-corn, &amp;c. taken from the undisposed produce. 

Manufactures.— T\ie manufactures are confined to spinning of 
flax into yarn, and its manufacture into brown linen. The only 
spinning mill is that at Auchinblae, originally erected by Mr Kin- 
near, and how belonging to Farquharson and Company, where about 
60 people are employed, who work about eleven hours and a half 
daily. The hands employed are 16 men, from 8s. to L. 1 per 
week; 6 boys from 2s. to 7s. per week; 38 women and girls from 
2s. to 5s. 6d. per week.

In addition to this, a number of hands are employed as weavers 
in Auchinblae, of whom some are natives of the parish, but many 
come from other parts of the country, and do not generally re- 
main long in one place. By these, about 29,700 spmdles are 
made into 117,680 yards of hnen, the value of the yarn being 



about L. 37 12,' and of the linen L. 4640. The price paid for 
weaving averages Id. to Ifd. per yard. 

Corn-Mz7/s.- There are five corn-mills, situated m dilierent 
parts, of the parish, with drying kilns attached. At none of these

is wheat made into flour. Ahnost every farm, of the extent of 100 
acres and upwards, is accommodated with a thrashing-mill. They 
are driven either by water or horses, according to circumstances. 

FettercairnClub. — The Fettercairn Club, for the improvement of 
the breed of live stock, includes amongst its members a great propor- 
tion of the proprietors of the county, and most respectable tenantry 
of the district. The club is open to members from any part of the 
country, but stock can only be exhibited which has been bred by agri- 
culturists in the parishes of Fettercairn, Fordoun, Laurencekirk, and 
Marykirk, members of the club. This club has been in existence 
for several years, and is conducted with the greatest spirit and una- 
nimity. Since its formation, a most marked improvement is per- 
ceptible in the quality of stock, particularly of the native breed of 
cattle ; and at the annual show, which takes place in August, the 
stock exhibited attracts the admiration of every amateur present. 
In corroboration of what is stated, it may be mentioned, that at the 
Highland Society's general show, which took place at Aberdeen 
in October 1834, which was open to all Scotland, but more par- 
ticularly to the counties of Forfar, Aberdeen, Banff, Moray, and 
Kincardine, one- sixth of the whole prizes were carried off by mem- 
bers of this club ; and, what is more remarkable, these premiums 
amounted to nearly one-third of the value of the whole premiums 
given by the Society. It may also be remarked, that of about fif- 
ty-four premiums given for stock at the general show alluded to, 
twenty were gained by competitors from Kincardineshire, a suffi- 
cient proof of the great attention paid to this branch of rural eco- 
nomy in the county. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Villages. — The Kirkton of Fordoun can scarcely be called a vil- 
lage, for, beside the manse and school-house, it can boast of only the 
neat and rural " Fordoun Inn" and two or three additional cottages. 
Auchinblae, the only village in the parish, stands on the opposite 
side of the valley, on a gently rising ground. It contains many 
substantial houses, and is altogether a clean and thriving place. 
The government is vested in a bailie, appointed by the Earl of 
Kintore, who is the superior, and the population amounts to 550 
persons, partly employed in manufacturing linen and linen yarn, in 
the retail trade, and as artisans and occupiers of the croft land ad- 
joining the village. Its distance from Stonehaven is 11 miles; 
from the port of Gourdon, 8 ; and from Montrose, 16j to which 
places the comniunicatiou is easy, either by turnpike or good com-

mutation roads. Aiicliinblae enjoys tlie advantage of a daily post, 
with runners both to Stonehaven and Montrose. Commutation 
roads are carried in all directions through the parish ; and the ex- 
tent of roads of this description cannot be less than forty miles. 
Much attention is bestowed by the trustees in keeping them in re- 
pair, each being desirous of obtaining as large a share of highway 
and bridge money as possible for his own district, and no less de- 
sirous of expending it in the most judicious and economical man- 
ner. Bridges are thrown across the different streams where neces- 
sary, and are always kept in good repair. The turnpike road from 
Aberdeen to Edinburgh through Strathmore runs through the 
lower part of the parish for about three miles, along which two 
coaches, " the Defiance" and " Union," convey the natives daily, 
either to Edinburgh or Aberdeen, with the greatest ease, safety, 
and dispatch. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church stands in the most beautiful 
spot in the parish ; and, although in as centrical a situation as could 
have been selected, still several of the parishioners have from four 
to six miles to travel in order to attend divine worship at their own 
parish church. The church is a handsome edifice, erected in 
1828-29, at an expense of not less than L. 3000. It is in the 
Gothic style, from designs by Mr Smith, architect, Aberdeen, and 
consists of a nave but without side aisles, with a Gothic tower on 
the west end, rising to the height of ninety-three feet, forming a 
striking object from all quarters. The church is finished in a neat 
and even elegant manner, superior to most parochial churches in 
Scotland. It is seated for 1230, and is fully equal to the accom- 
modation of the parish. The church with the burying-ground 
is surrounded by a wall of substantial masonry, and is approached 
by an elegant gateway. 

The manse was repaired in 1809. It affords considerable ac- 
commodation, though not in .the modern style. The situation of 
both church and manse have been already described. 

The glebe contains about the statutory number of arable acres, 
viz. four Scots, or five imperial acres. The soil is excellent, but 
there is no grass glebe attached to it. Its yearly value may be 
about L. 10 or L. 12. 

The whole teinds of the parish are bishops' teinds, and former- 
ly belonged to the Archbishop of St Andrews. They are now the 
property of the Crown, of whom they are held by the different pro- 
prietors of the landj either on lease, or by tacit relocation. The

present stipend, by decree of moditication dated 4th December 
1833, amounts to 130 bolls, 9 stones, lOlbs. meal; 95 quarters, 
'2 bulls, 3 pecks, 2 gallons, barley, imperial weight and measure, 
and L. 10 for communion elements; or 136 bolls meal, and 136 
bolls barley, Linlithgow weight and measure, and L. 10 for com- 
munion elements. There is still a considerable amount of unex- 
hausted teind in the parish, the teinds of only one estate having 
been surrendered. The whole of the parish is supposed to come 
under the denomination of church lands. 

The number of Dissenters in Fordoun is very limited. They con- 
sist chiefly of a few families attached to the doctrines of the Epis- 
copal Church. There are neither chapels of ease, dissenting cha- 
pels, nor government churches in the parish, the great body of the 
people being members of the Estabhshed Church.

The number of communicants belonging to the Established 
Church in 1834 was 1234. 

There are no societies for rehgious purposes established, the 
annual examinations and periodical visitations of the clergyman 
being deemed, and justly deemed, sufficient for the purposes'of re- 
ligious instruction. These examinations are numerously and punc- 
tually attended, and the visitations are looked forward to as the 
means of cementing and promoting that intercourse and good feel- 
ing which ought always to subsist between a clergyman and his pa- 
rishioners. 

Education.— Theve are- six schools in the parish, viz. the paro- 
chial school, and five others taught by individuals, who have only 
to trust to the fees they receive as a remuneration for their trouble, 
there being no endowment, or even annual subscriptions made for 
that purpose. Besides these, there are two schools taught by fe- 
males, where girls are instructed in reading, writing, and needle- 
work. The branches of instruction taught at the parish school 
are, readmg, writmg and arithmetic, mathematics and Latin, and 
if required, Greek; the branches taught at the other schools are 
reading, writing, and arithmetic. The school salary at Fordoun 
IS L. o5, 12s. 1 Id., and the amount of fees is annually about L 15«

KINCAIIDINESHIIIE. 



The schoolmaster is besides session-clerk, the emoluments of whicli 
office amount to about L. 8 yearly. 

The number of scholars educated at the different schools 
amounted, in March 1834, to 312, of whom 184 were boys, and 
128 girls. The schools are best attended from November to 
May. During summer the attendance is not numerous. The 
parish schoolmaster has also a Sunday evening school for six months 
in the year ; it is attended by about 70 scholars. The parish 
school-house, as well as the schoolmaster's house, are large and com • 
modious, and considerably exceed what is considered as the legal 
accommodation. 

There are few, if any natives of the parish, and residing in it, who 
have reached the age of fifteen, who cannot read. The greater 
part who have reached that age have been taught to write. 

Literature. — A parish library was instituted in 1827. It now 
consists of about GIO volumes, chiefly religious, but including also 
books on history, biography, voyages, travels, &amp;c. The number 
of readers is considerable, and yearly increasing. They amount 
in the winter season to about 200, who read gratis. The school- 
master acts as librarian. Besides the parish library, there is also 
a small Sunday school library. 

Although Fordoun cannot boast of any public reading-room, 
or news-room, yet newspapers often of doubtful principles are 
easily obtained and eagerly read ; there is consequently no lack of 
poUticians sufficiently liberal in their principles, and irregular in 
their practice. 

Charitable Institutions. — There are none ; but there are two 
Friendly Societies, viz. The Ploughman Society, consisting of 
about 200 members, and the Weavers' Society of 70. The mem- 
bers of both societies contribute Is. per quarter. They give allow- 
ance to sick, and to aged and decayed members. 

Fordoun parish bank, instituted in May 1815, is limited to male 
and female servants, crofters, labourers, tradesmen, including weav- 
ers and mill-spinners. It is managed by twelve directors, a treasurer, 
and a clerk. The minister acts as treasurer, and the schoolmas- 
ter as clerk. Depositors are obliged to withdraw their money, and 
place it in the British Linen Co. when the sum reaches L. 20. 
Formerly it was limited to L. 10. The books and vouchers are 
examined annually, and attested by an auditor chosen by the di- 
rectors.

January 1, 1835. — The balance in the Bank amounted to 
about L. 2650 : the number of depositors at present is 280. A 
considerable part of the sums repaid were transferred to the public 
bank, — and the vouchers for L. 1000 of these sums were left till 
January 1835, in the hands of the treasurer of the parish bank, 
who gave his receipt for them, and drew the interest on the 1st 
January every year, and paid it to the depositors, along with the 
interest on deposits in the parish bank, — but the treasurer finding 
he had now fully enough to do with the parish bank matters, the 
greater part of these vouchers were delivered up, January 1 835, to 
their owners, it being understood that the Treasurer of the parish 
bank would assist them in drawing the interest on the sums de- 
posited in the public bank, when it became due. 

Poor and Parochial funds. — These consist of a fixed invest- 
ment in feu-duties, bearing five and a half per cent, interest of 
about L. 600, and of L. 400 lodged in the bank, or laid out 
at interest. The late Alexander Crombie, Esq. of Phesdo, 
was most anxious about the support and comfort of the poor. 
Observing the increase of the poor, and the diminution in the 
means of their support, from the fall of the interest of the capital 
in the hands of the kirk-session, he, at the loss of L. 150, part- 
ed with the above-mentioned feu-duties, in order to form a per- 
manent and steady fund for the support of the poor, and also be-

queathed L. 100 at his death, to be added to said fund. Collec- 
tions for the poor in 1834, L. 90, 9s. 5-d. — Donations received 
during the last ten years from heritors and others, of from L. 1 to 
L. 12, L. 185 ; legacies to the session within same period, 
L. 190: in whole, L. 375, or L. 37, 10s. yearly. 

These include Mr Crombie's legacy of L. 100, and L. 50 from 
the late Mrs Valentine BogendoUo, who was born, and resided 
during the greater part of her lifetime, in the parish of Fordoun, 
and L. 50 of legacy from the late Mrs Burnett of Monboddo, 
received in April 1835. The whole sum at the disposal of the 
kirk-session, arising from donations, legacies, collections at church- 
doors, feu-duties and interest of money, thus amounts to about 
L. 170 yearly. The ordinary number of poor on the monthly roll 
is 48 : these receive an allowance from 2s. to 5s. according 
to their necessities. The extraordinary poor amount to 40. 
These get occasional relief as circumstances warrant. The annual 
distribution to the poor amounts to about L. 160. The session 
have had to pay, for the last three years, above L. 25 annually 
for the support of lunatics. Collection in 1834 for the general 
Assembly's Mission to India L. 6, 7s. Collection in 1833 for the 
General Assembly's Schools in the Highlands, L. 7, 73. 6d. 
There is a public collection once a year for religious purposes, 
and an annual collection for the Aberdeen Infirmary. The 
amount of this last averages L. 10 yearly, which secures to patients 
from this parish, admission on favourable terms. 

It is a matter of daily observation and regret, that the repug- 
nance felt by the poor of Scotland, to receive charity in any shape, 
is by no means so strong as formerly. It is still considered as 
degrading to a certain extent, in this parish, and few, it may be 
said none, ever apply for aid, who are not fit objects of charity. 

Prisons. — There are no prisons or lock-up houses in the parish ; 
all prisoners,, when apprehended by the constable, being either 
carried to the nearest Justice of Peace, or before the Procurator- 
fiscal in Stonehaven. To its credit, there have only, during the 
last seven years, been apprehended in the parish, 2 ; committed 
for trial, 2 ; convicted, 2 ; both were tor assaults. Neither of 
the culprits were natives of the parish. 

Fairs, Si'c. — Paldy fair is the most considerable market ; it is held 
on a moor, about two miles north from Auchinblae, at the foot of 
the Grampians, in the month of July, for the sale of cattle, sheep, 
and horses. Of late, this market has been on the decline. Ano- 



FORDOUN.

tlier market, also for the sale of horses and cattle, has been lately 
established, or rather revived, in the west end of the parish, viz. 
Lammas-muir, This is likewise held in J uly, and the day appears 
judiciously chosen, as being one of a series of fairs, held on suc- 
cessive days, commencing in Aberdeenshire, and terminating at 
Kinross. Two fairs are held in Auchinblae, viz. Pasch market 
in April, and May-day on 2'2d May, and term markets for en- 
gaging servants on 26th May and 22d November. These are nu- 
merously attended. Weekly markets or crofts, as they are called, 
for the sale of cattle and grain, also in Auchinblae, are held every 
Friday during winter. They begin in November, and end in April. 
There are two small fairs or cattle-markets about the middle of 
June and July on Camack muir, on the lower part of the parish ; 
— they are but indifferently attended. 

Inns or Alehouses. — There is one inn at the Kirkton of Fordoun ; 
and tive in the village of Auchinblae. This number is certainly 
too great. Auchinblae also boasts of one spirit -dealer. In the 
country parish, there are three public-houses. 

Fuel. — Coals, mostly from Newcastle, constitute the principal 
part of the fuel in the lower part of the parish, in addition to 
which, a small supply of peat from the Grampians -is obtained. 
Brushwood, but in no great quantities, is also occasionally to be 
procured. In the upper part of the parish, the fuel is chiefly peat 
and turf from the summit of the Grampians, where the peat-mosses 
are extensive, and of very considerable depth. Coals cost Is. 2d. a 
barrel of about cwt. It is difficult to say what the cost of peat 
and turf may be, perhaps about 4s. per load. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The most striking alterations betwixt the present state of the 
parish, and that which existed at the time the last Statistical Ac- 
count was made up, are : the erection of several splendid man- 
sions, and of a parish church ; the extension and improvement of 
Auchinblae ; the extension and general improvement of public 
roads ; the very marked alteration in the houses and steadings of 
the tenants and crofters, and the general improved condition of 
the dwellings of all classes. The planting and improvement of 
waste land is not the least alteration that has taken place, neither 
is the improved state of husbandry undeserving of notice, as the 
following tables of ground under cultivation, and number of live 
stock, extracted from the Agricultural Survey of the county, a work

Farms are of all sizes, from the croft of two acres to the farm of 
600, the general extent of farms being about 200 acres. Per- 
haps no greater improvement could be effected, or greater boon 
conferred by landlords upon the agricultural population, than a more 
judicious disposition of the size of farms. These ought to be of 
all sizes, and adapted as well for the capital of the great agricul- 
turist, as for the savings of the thrifty ploughman, or industrious 
labourer. By attending to this, scope would be given to the exer- 
tions of the humblest individual. The ploughman would strive to 
become an overseer, the overseer a crofter or small farmer, and 
bringing his experience and sagacity into operation, in time a large 
farmer. The improvements of which this parish is susceptible 
have been already adverted to, viz. inclosing, planting, and drain- 
ing. Perhaps a conversion, upon equitable principles, of money 
into grain rents, would also be an improvement. Some satisfactory 
instances of this have already taken place, and it is hoped, this mode 
of adjustment may become general. _ ,,oi k \

PRESBYTERY OF FORDOUN, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER WHYTE, A. M. MINISTER. 



I — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — This parish is supposed, by some, to have derived its 
name from its vicinity to the Cairn-o- Mount, a part of the Gram- 
pian mountains, over which the public road to Aberdeenshire 
passes, and to which it begins to ascend, at a small distance, to the 
north of the village. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish of Fettercairn forms the ex- 
treme western division of Kincardineshire, on the south side of the 
Grampians. Its length, from south to north, is 8 miles, and its o-reatest 
breadth, from east to west, 4. It contains about 13, 192 imperial 
acres, or about 20 square miles of surface. It is bounded on the north 
and north-east, by the parish of Fordoun ; on the east and south- 
east, by the parish of Marykirk ; on the south and south-west, by 
part of the parish of Marykirk, and the river North Esk ; and on 
the west and north-west, by part of the parish of Edzell and the 
Grampian mountains, which separate it from the parish of Stra- 
chan, in that direction.

KINCAIIDINKSHIRE. 



The highest part of the Grampians, here, does not ascend more 
than 1600 feet above the level of the sea. Their angles of ascent 
range probably from 30° to 40°. Their lower undulations, as 
they slope down to the plain country, give a diversified and pleas- 
ing, but not a hilly appearance, to the landscape. 

Meteorology. — A register of the weather, kept from ]816 to 
1836, by an intelligent observer in the parish, from which the 
years ending 1st September 1817, 1821, 1826, and 1831, are se- 
lected as likely to give a fair average of that period, — leads us to 
conclude that there were dry days in each year, 222 ; wet days or 
days in which rain, hail, sleet, or snow fell, in some quantity or 
other, 143; majority dry, 79.

From this statement, it may be inferred that, on the whole, the 
climate is good. Accordingly, invalids, who require change of air, 
often derive much benefit from it during the summer season. Still, 
at other times, the sudden changes of temperature, and the fre- 
quent prevalence of cold fogs and hoar frosts, are very apt to pro- 
duce all the varieties of inflammatory affections, which are the most 

common diseases. 

Hydrography.— In the hill above Fasque, there is a spring of 
a distinctly chalybeate character. There is another, about one- 
fourth of a mile below the village, on the Fettercairn estate. In 
many other places in the parish, the water seems impregnated 
with iron, from the quantities of oxide of iron which appear m the 
bottoms of drains, and other situations, where it converts the stag- 
nant water into a coagulated state. No iron rock has been dis- 
covered near these places. No rivers take their rise in or run 
through this parish. But the North Esk, after it issues from the 
mountains, forms the boundary between it and Edzell, for the 
space of nearly four miles. This river then runs almost due east, 
for about nine miles, and enters the German Ocean, a few mdes 
north of Montrose. In the neighbourhood of The Burn, its banks 



FKTTERCAIHN. 



113 



are very precipitous. In some places, it has there worn a bed to 
itself, through the rocks, to the depth of from 20 to 30 feet be- 
low the level of the conterminous grounds. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — A particular account of the geological 
peculiarities observable in the channel of the North Esk has been pub- 
lished in the sixth volume of the Transactions of the Royal Society 
of Edinburgh. That account was carefully drawn up by the late 
Colonel Imrie, who lived several years in this parish, and paid 
great attention to matters of this kind. He has observed in that 
article, that " the various strata, standing in a position vertical or 
nearly so, and the river cutting across these strata at right angles, 
the succession is uncommonly well exhibited, and a fair display of 
the structure of the country, and of the materials composing it, to 
a great depth, is open to the attentive observer." The limits of 
this paper do not admit of a particular description of the Colo- 
nel's discoveries. It may be remarked, however, that he found, 
either in a detached or stratified form, or in a state of combina- 
tion, distinct specimens of silicious grit, or red freestone, quartz, 
felspar, granite, mica, porphyry, whinstone, argillite, or thinly 
slaty rock, jasper,- limestone. These different kinds of rock are 
in every sort of position, and often mixed together in irregular 
masses. From the granite to the plum-puddingstone, almost all 
the intermediate varieties may be seen in some form or other. 
Specimens of many of these kinds are also observable in the beds 
of the burns or rivulets, which run past Balnakettle, Dallalie, and 
BogendoUo. Porcelain clay of fine quaUty is found in the banks 
of the first of these streams. 

Mr Robertson, in his Survey of Kincardineshire, has mentioned 
a substance which has been occasionally found on the farm of Bal- 
nakettle, and which he has assumed to be native iron, and has tra- 
ced its origin, apparently, on the theory of La Place, Dr Hutton, 
and others, to some convulsion in the moon. The analysis, how- 
ever, which he has given of its component parts differs very widely 
from that which Mr Howard gave, of the specimens of the Afri- 
can and Peruvian native iron which he analyzed. Some have 
thought that it is nothing more than part of the sweepings of a 
smithy, formerly in that neighbourhood ; while others have believ- 
ed that it might have been a kind of coarse iron imperfectly fused 
and brought hither from Dalbog, a few miles distant, where an 
iron mine seems to have been wrought little more than a hundred 
years ago. A description of Great Britain, printed in London in 

KINCARDINE. H 



114 



KINCAUUINESIIIH K 



1708, mentions this place in these words : " They find plenty of 
iron ore near the wood of Dalbog." 

Bog iron ore, of the latest formation, has been found in the neigh- 
bourhood of the village. Large fir and oak trees, in a good state 
of preservation, have been found at great depths from the surface 
of the ground in different places in the parish. 

In some places, the soil is alluvial; in others, it is a stiff' clay of 
a brownish colour. Deep moss prevails in some low situations ; 
and gravel, with a thin sprinkling of moss or vegetable mould, is 
often observable on the higher grounds and moorish lands. 

Zoology. — On the hills, the red grouse abound. The alpine 
or white hare is occasionally seen In the woods, all the usual 
kinds of birds are to be met with. Black game has become ra- 
ther numerous of late. The woodcock is an annual visitor and 
residenter from October to March. Pheasants have been intro- 
duced, but have not multiphed to theextent desired. In the North 
Esk are all the varieties, except pike, of fresh water fish ; but 
salmon have rarely ascended above a water -fall near The Burn- 
house, till of late, when the fall has been lowered to let them up 
the river. Perch and other kinds of fish abound in the lakes at 
Fasque and The Burn. Hares and partridges are numerous in the 
fields. All the other kinds of animals common to the country, 
whether wild or domesticated, are to be seen. 

II. — Civil History. 
Land-owners. — The land-owners of the parish, in the order of 
their valued rents, are. Captain M'Inroy of The Burn and Arnhall; 
John Gladstone, Esq. of Fasque ; Sir John Stuart Forbes of Pit- 
sligo and Fettercairn, Bart. ; Sir Alexander Ramsay of Balmain, 
Bart, late M. P. for Kincardineshire; The Hon. Donald Ogilvy 
of Clova and Balbegno, Colonel of the Forfarshire and Kincar- 
dineshire Militia; The Right Hon. the Earl of Kintore; Miss 
Robertson of Dalladies ; The Right Hon. the Viscount Arbuth- 
nott, one of the sixteen representative Peers of Scotland, and 
Lord Lieutenant of the county. 

Maps, Sfc. — There is no map of the parish, except what is con- 
tained in the maps of the county by Garden and others, or in the 
plans of the different estates belonging 1o the foregoing proprie- 
tors. By these plans, it appears that it contains less surface, by 
at least 1000 imperial acres, than the quantity stated by Garden, 
and by the writer of the last Statistical Account, on his authority. 
Till that Account appeared, there was no history of the parish.

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers extend backwards 
to 1669, with partial interruptions, which were occasioned, in 
part, by the burning of certain portions of them, in consequence of 
the adherents of the Stuarts having set fire to the school-house, 
where they were deposited, in 1745, the inhabitants being attach- 
ed to the interests of the Hanoverian family. 

Antiquities. — The death of Kenneth III., King of Scotland, in 
994, is believed by some to have taken place in this parish. His- 
torians differ as to the circumstances. John of Fordoun and his 
followers tell us that he was shot by an arrow, from a curious piece 
of mechanism, in consequence of a plan which a lady, of the name 
of Finella, had devised, to be revenged for her son, Crathilinthus, 
whom he put to death for certain heinous crimes which he had 
committed. Winton, Buchanan, M'Pherson, and others, make 
him fall by the hands of a body of conspirators, who suddenly rose 
upon him in Fettercairn, as he was directing his course to the 
shrine of St Palladius, with a view there to unburden his mind of 
sins which troubled it much. The late Professor Stuart of Ma- 
rischal College, Aberdeen, published a paper in Vol. ii. Part ii. 
of the Transactions of the Antiquarian Society of Scotland, in 
which he laid it down as a probable conjecture, that the King was 
assassinated in a hunting-match in the neighbourhood. This the- 
ory he founded on certain figures, representing a hunting-scene, 
cut on a grave-stone, which was discovered in the churchyard of 
Fordoun some years ago, and supposed to commemorate this event. 
All seem to admit, however, that Finella had a hand in the tra- 
gedy. 

Buchanan terms Finella's place of residence " the Castle of 
Fettercairn," which seems to be unfavourable to the belief, enter- 
tained by some, that it was situated in the parish of Fordoun ; 
though the names of certain places in that parish give an air of 
probabihty to that behef. Others think that it must have been 
about a mile and a-half south-west from the village of Fettercairn 
where the remains of a large fortified place, called Greencairn, are' 
still visible. This is a mass of ruins on the top of a round emi- 
nence of about forty or fifty feet above the level of the adjoining 
grounds. What its origin was, or when it ceased to be inhabited, 
is unknown. But that it must have been a place of great strength', 
and must have been many ages uninhabitable, is evident, from the 
portions of vitrified materials, of which it was composed, still re- 
maining, and from the entire state of desolation to which it is now

KINCARDINE.SHIIIE. 



reduced, notwithstanding the durable nature of that mode of 
building. 

The next most ancient place is Balbegno Castle, on the same 
estate, and still habitable. The date of 1509 is visible on the pa- 
- rapet wall. The expense of building it is said to have been so 
great, that the proprietor, whose name was Wood, was obliged to 
sell the lands of Balnakettle and Littlestrath, then belonging to 
him, to enable him to complete it. Various pieces of sculpture 
are exhibited in the higher parts of the wall. Within, there is a 
lofty hall, the roof of which is composed of freestone, arched and 
groined, and divided into sixteen triangular spaces. In these are 
painted the names and coats of arms of sixteen Scotch peters. 

The lands of Balbegno were given by William the Lion, who 
died in 1214, to one " Ranulphus filius Walteri de Lenorp." The 
deed of gift included " Lachra," that is, Luthur or Halkerton, with 
" Balbegno in vie. de Kinkardin ;" and Ranulphus is designated 
in it, " Falconario nostro." This was the origin of the name and 
estates of the family of Halkerton in this county, now represented 
by the Earl of Kintore. By what means Balbegno was separated 
from the rest of the Halkerton property is unknown. In 1680, it 
was possessed by Andrew Wood. His son, also named Andrew, 
sold it in lB87 to Andrew Middleton of Pitgarvie. In 1722, we 
find it in possession of John Ogilvy, son of George Ogilvy of Lu- 
nan, an advocate in Edinburgh. A sister of his had married and 
survived Robert Middleton, the former proprietor; and by this 
connection it may have come into his hands. He left four daugh- 
ters, the oldest of whom married and survived a Dr Brisbane, and 
possessed the estate till 1778, when it was sold to the father of the 
present proprietor, for a sum not equal to a fifth part of its present 
value. 

Another ancient building is Fettercairn House, a few hundred 
yards north by east of the village. A tasteful addition to it was 
built a few years ago by the present proprietor. The original 
part bears the date of 1666, and the initials of the name of John 
Earl of Middleton. His initials, coronet, and coat-of-arms, also, 
appear on the capital of an octagonal pillar in the village. This 
pillar, which is understood to have been the cross of the old town 
of Kincardine, the remains of which are still traced on the Fet- 
tercairn estate, bears the date of 1670, and rises about seven feet 
above a mass of building, composed of six concentric circles, or 
circular steps. An iron rivet is still seen on one side, to which 



FETTERCAIHK. 



117 



the jurfs, the old instrument of punishment in Scotland, appear, 
from the marks on the stone, to have been suspended. 

The Fettercairn estates, which also seem to have formerly borne 
the name of Middleton, were possessed by one called Middleton, 
in the twenty-fourth year of the reign of Alexander III. In 1539, 
John Middleton sold the lands of Middleton to David Falconer of 
Halkerton ; after which he and his successors went by the desig- 
nation of Middletons of Pitgarvie and Cadham. From these de- 
scended the distinguished Earl John above-mentioned, who reco- 
vered the Middleton property ; but whether by purchase or other- 
wise, does not appear. 

Earl of Middleton. — This nobleman was the son of John Mid- 
dleton of Cadham, and his wife, Helen Strachan, one of the Thorn - 
ton family. He devoted himself to literary pursuits till the civil 
wars broke out, when he took up arms on the side of the English 
Parliament. In 1644, Sir William Waller, by virtue of powers from 
the Earl of Essex, gave him the command of a troop of Harque- 
busiers, and afterwards raised him to the rank of a lieutenant-ge- 
neral, in which capacity he acted till the Parliament cashiered Es- 
sex, when he resigned his command, and entered into the service 
of the Estates of Scotland. In 1647, he was made Lieutenant- 
General of the Horse, in the army raised to liberate Charles I., 
then a prisoner in the Isle of Wight. In the battle of Pres- 
ton h6 was taken prisoner, and afterwards confined in Newcastle, 
till his royal master was beheaded. He then found means to 
escape and reached Scotland at the time when Charles II. arriv- 
ed in that kingdom. He again obtained the command of the 
Horse, in the army which Charles led, in person, into England, 
and fought bravely in the battle of Worcester, in 1651, where he 
was wounded, and again made prisoner. He was sent, by Crom- 
well's orders, to the Tower of London, there to be executed ; but 
again he escaped, and joined his sovereign in Paris. In 165:3, he 
arrived in Scotland with a royal commission, and superseded the 
Earl of Glencairn as Commander-in-Chief of the B'orces. Being 
unable to receive foreign supplies, he struggled with difficulties 
for about a year, when he was defeated by General Monk, and 
obliged to seek his safety in concealment. In 1655, he escaped 
to the Continent, and again joined his master at Cologne, with 
whom he continued during the remainder of his exile. After the 
Restoration, Charles raised him to the peerage, by the titles of 
Earl of Middleton and Viscount Fettercairn, in Scotland, and 
Lord Clermont, in Enghuid. He was also made Commander-in- 



KINCyVUUlNESHIUIi;, 

Chief of the Forces in Scotland, Governor of Edhiburgh Castle 
and one of the Lords of the Privy- Council. In 1661. he was 
appointed Lord High Commissioner to the Scotch Parliament; 
but, having abused his power, and rendered some powerful noble- 
men his enemies, he lost the royal favour, and was deprived of 
the various places of trust and honour which he held. On the 
suggestion, it is believed, of the Earl of Lauderdale, who feared 
lest the King's affections might return to him, and who, therefore, 
wished him removed to a distance, he was afterwards appointed 
governor of the new English Fort of Tangier, on the coast of 
Africa, where he remained till the time of his death, which was 
occasioned by a fall from a stair in 1673, 

Earl John Middleton was succeeded in his estates and titles by 
his son Charles, who acted as one of the principal secretaries of 
State for England, from 1684 to 1688, when he followed the for- 
tunes of his exiled master, and remained in France till he was at- 
tainted, by act of Parliament, in 1695. He and his two sons 
having embarked in the expedition fitted out in France, in 1708, 
for the restoration of the Stuarts, were taken prisoners at sea by 
Admiral Bing, but soon afterwards were liberated by the Queen's 
orders, and no more appeared in public life. 

The lands continued in the possession of the Middletons till 
1777, when they were purchased from the heirs of Lady Diana 
Middleton, by Sir John Stuart, Bart., the maternal grandfather 
of the present proprietor, and, at the time of his death, one of the 
Barons of Exchequer of Scotland. Like the lands of Balbegno, 
they are now worth more than five times the original sum that 
was paid for them. 

The only other antiquity, to be noticed, is the Gannachy 
Bridge. It is built across the North Esk, on two steep rocks, 
and forms the communication between Fettercairn and Edzell. 
The arch is about 30 feet high, and 52 wide ; and yet the quan- 
tity of water in the river, in August 1829, almost completely filled 
it. The original bridge was built by James Black, tenant in 
Wood, parish of Edzell, in 1732, at an expense of 300 merks 
Scotch. Being too narrow from parapet to parapet, it was 
widened by adding another arch to the side of it, so as to make it 
about 20 feet wide. This was done in 1796 by Lord Adam Gor- 
don, and the Honourable William Maule, now Lord Panmure, 
at their own expense, said to have amounted to L. 300. 

Mansion-Houses. — About three-quarters of a mile north by west 
from the Gannachy Bridge, on a rising ground, a few hundred yards 



FK'ITEKCAIUN.

from the river, stands The Burn House, a neat commodious man- 
sion, built by Lord Adam Gordon in 1791, and much improved 
by alterations and additions, effected by Messrs Brodie and Shand, 
its successive proprietors. The scenery is here very much admired, 
particularly along the banks of the river. The walks cut through 
the rocks, and the woods planted by his Lordship's directions, 
have converted the native ruggedness of these banks into scenes 
of sublimity and beauty. 

Fasque, the only other mansion-house in the parish, is situated 
about a mile and a quarter north by west of the village. It was 
built by the late Sir Alexander Ramsay of Balmain, Bart, in 
1809. It is a large house of a castellated form, and contains 
every accommodation for a numerous family. Having been built 
on elevated ground, it commands an extensive, diversified, and 
pleasing view of the surrounding country. A lake of about twenty 
acres of extent, and a fine approach to the house, completed a 
few years ago by the present proprietor, give additional effect to 
the scenery of this place. 

III. — Population. 

By returns given to Dr Webster in 1755, the population of this 
parish seems to have been 1950. Mr Garden, in 1774, when he 
pubhshed his map of the county, made it 1500. Mr Foote, in the 
Statistical Account drawn up by him in 1791, stated it at about 
2000. In 1801, by the first Government census under Mr Ab- 
bot's bill, it was 1794, — in 1811, by the second census, 1562, — 
in 1821, 1573,— in 1831, 1637; at present, it is thought to be 
considerably more. 

By the last census, the males were 775, and the females 862. 
There were in the village 234 inhabitants, and in the rest of the 
parish 1403, of whom were under fifteen years of age, 573; between 
fifteen and thirty, 405 ; between thirty and fifty, 383 ; between 
fifty and seventy, 203; upwards of seventy, 73: in all, consti- 
tuting 388 families, and living in 367 houses, being an average of 4 
persons to each family. There are 2 persons totally blind, 2 partially 
blind, and one fatuous. The average per annum of births for the 
last nine or ten years has been about 43; deaths, 18; marriages, 16. 

The incomes of the different proprietors, arising from the property 
they hold in the parish, vary from L. 200 to upwards of L. 2000 
per annum. Only two reside occasionally in the parish. 

The people may, on the whole, be said to be a sober, industrious, 
intelligent, and religious people.

Rent. — Some of tlie arable land is let as low per annum as 10s. 
per acre, and some as high as L. 4, 10s. Scotch measure ; but the 
average may be about L. 1, Is. In several instances, part of the 
rent is paid by the fiars prices of the county. The vifhole gross 
rental of the parish, including about L. 3G5, arising from hill pas- 
ture, and sales of wood, amounts to about L. 8230. A consider- 
able extent of enclosed grounds or grass parks, is annually let by 
public sale, for the summer half year, the rate of which is from 
under L. 1, to nearly L. 4, per acre. It is estimated that a sheep 
might be kept for 3s., and an ox of ordinary size for from L. 2, 
to L. 2, 10s. for the summer half year, and about the same sum 
for the rest of the year, on turnips and straw. 

Wages. — The price of labour seems to be as follows : farm-ser- 
vants hired for the half-year get, with food from their employers, 
as follows, viz. men, from L. 6 to L. 8, 8s. ; women, from L. 3, 
10s. to L. 4, 10s. in summer, and from L,2 to L. 3, in winter; 
day-labourers without food furnished them, as follows, viz. men, 
Is. 6d., to 2s. in summer, and Is. 3d. to Is. 6d. in winter; wo-

Live-StocL — The common breed of sheep is the black-faced 
kind, with a few Cheviots. The black cattle are chiefly of the 
Angus-shire breed, but there are also a few of the Aberdeenshire 
and Ayrshire kinds. The species of pig most in use is the Chi- 
nese. Bees are cultivated, but not to much extent or advantage. 

Husbandry. — The mode of husbandry is generally that of five 
years rotation, being successively oats, green crop, barley or oats 
again, hay, and pasture the last year. Wheat is not much cultivat- 
ed. In the green crop stage of the rotation, mangel wurzel, or 
beet-root, has been tried and has grown well, and been considered 
a very valuable kind of food for milch cows ; but the cultivation of 
it has been discontinued on account of the trouble and expense 
attending it. In the scarcity of manure which sometimes occurs, 
bone dust is used as a substitute. It produces good crops of tur- 
nips ; but sheep are generally laid on the field to eat them off, for 
the sake of the following crops. 

The Georgian, Hopetoun, Kildrummie, Early Angus, and po- 
tato oats, have all been tried ; but the potato and early Angus 
varieties are those at present in use. Barley is most frequently 
sown in the lower, and bear in the higher, parts of the parish ; and 
the returns vary from 4 to 8 qrs. per acre. Frequent changes 
of seed are used to prevent deterioration, which would otherwise 
take place. Tares are sown, as a substitute for clover-grass, to 
be used in the end of the season. Flax has been esteemed a se- 
vere crop for the land, and has been less cultivated for several years 
back than when it was encouraged by the Government bounty. 

Leases, Sfc. — The common period of leases is nineteen years. The 
farm buildings and enclosures are, in general, commodious and in 
good repair. In most cases, the tenants bear a part of the ex- 
pense of them. The disposition of the present proprietors is al- 
lowed to be liberal towards all that sit under them. 

Improvements.— At an early period in the agricultural history of 
this county, we find the Ramsays of Balmain mentioned as very ac- 
tive and extensive improvers of land. By the zealous and judicious 
exertions of the successive members of that family who came into the 
possession of the property, it was brought to such a state of im- 
provement, that comparatively little remained to be done after the 



122 



KINCARDINESHIRE. 



end of last century. On the estate of Fettercairn much, too, was 
done by Sir John Stuart, by draining, planting, and other improve- 
ments. But the most extensive improvements in the parish, since 
the former Statistical Account was published, have been effected 
on the estates of The Burn, Woodton, and Arnhall. The follow- 
ing very hurried and superficial sketch of them is all that our li- 
mits will admit of. In 1774, Lord Adam Gordon purchased 
Woodton, a part of the estate of Balfour, from Captain Forbes ; 
and in 1780, the lands, properly called The Burn, lying between it 
and the river, from Sir David Carnegie. For these two proper- 
ties he paid L. 5250 ; and the annual rent which they then yield- 
ed was only L. 113, lis. ld. Sterhng. They were both in the 
wildest state of barrenness. In 1782, his Lordship began to im- 
prove them ; and for twenty years he went steadily on with his ope- 
rations, till he had planted 526 acres of ground, converted much 
moor into arable land, and so completely changed the appearance 
and increased the value of them, that it was a subject of wonder 
how so much could have been effected in so short a time. On 
his Lordship's death, they were purchased for L. 20,000 Sterling, 
including L. 1 000 in name of household furniture, by the late Mr 
Brodie of Arnhall, father of the present Duchess of Gordon. 

Mr Brodie had bought the estate of Arnhall, in 1 796, from Sir 
David Carnegie, for L. 22,500 Sterling. He completed such of 
his Lordship's plans as had been left unfinished, and extended and 
carried on his improvements over all the estates till he had reclaim- 
ed, from moss and moor ground, upwards of 400 acres of surface, 
at an expense, on most of it, of L. 12, 10s. per acre, built 500 roods 
of stone dikes ; made five miles of roads ; and planted 220 acres 
of waste ground. The extent of his improvements, and the im- 
portance of them, may be inferred from the fact that, when offer- 
ed for sale, the three estates were purchased in 1814 for L. 70,000 
Sterling, by the late Mr John Shand. 

On this gentleman the mantle of his predecessors seemed to 
have fallen. They had done much, and yet much remained to be 
done. In 1818, therefore, he began his operations on an extensive 
district of deep moss, on the Arnhall estate. He cut a large drain 
2 miles long, 9 feet deep, 18 feet wide at top, and 4 at bottom, 
and a multitude of smaller ones running into it at right angles. 
When the moss was thus brought to a state of dryness fit for work- 
ing, upwards of 600 cart loads of gravel per acre, were mixed up 
with it, in some places to consolidate it, and make a proper soil for 



FETTEllCAIRN. 



123 



bearing crops. By these, and other operations, more than 200 
acres of waste ground were converted into productive land, and let 
to industrious tenants at a moderate rent. Belts of wood were also 
planted, and miles of excellent roads were made. 

Many improvements, on a smaller scale, have also been effect- 
ed by intelligent and industrious tenants, on the farms-occupied by 
them on the different estates throughout the parish, which want of 
space makes it here impossible to detail. Most of them have 
erected thrashing-mills at their own expense. The number of 
thrashing-mills in the parish is 27. 

Produce. — The gross amount of the value of raw produce raised 
annually in the parish may be estimated at from L. 15,000 to 
L, 16,000, though it is impossible to ascertain it exactly. About 
two-fifths of this sum may arise from grain and flax, and the re- 
maining three-fifths from cattle and other kinds of live-stock, and 
the produce of the dairy. 

Manufactures. — "There is a small establishment at Arnhall, for 
carding and manufacturing wool into coarse cloth, in which a few 
women, but no children, are employed. Their hours are moderate. 
There is another establishment at Nethermill, near the village, for 
distilling whisky from malt alone, in which men only are employed. 
The nature of their operations necessarily renders their hours irre- 
gular. No decidedly bad effects seem to be produced by either of 
these establishments on the health or morals of those immediately 
engaged in them. Both yield, apparently, a fair remuneration to 
the persons who have capital embarked in them. 

Fettercairn Club. — The only association in the parish, for the en- 
couragement of any branch of industry, is the Fettercairn Club. It 
was established in 1826, principally by the influence of Captain 
Ramsay one of the Bahnain family, then residing at Balbegno 
Castle. Its primary object was the improvement of the district of 
country around Fettercairn, in whatever related to the interests of 
agriculture. At present it is composed of about 86 members, from 
among the proprietors and principal tenants in the neighbourhood, 
and gentlemen at a greater distance, who feel interested in its suc- 
cess. Each member contributes annually L. 1 to the funds of the 
institution, by means of which a library is kept up for the use of 
the club, prizes are provided for certain piuposes specified in the 
regulations, and the expenses connected with its management de- 
frayed. The Highland or Agricultural Society of Scotland has 
patronized it, for some years back, by submitting part of their funds 
to its disposal every alternate year.

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Means of Communication, c. — There is no weekly market- 
town in the parish. The nearest place of that description, with 
which a regular intercourse is kept up, is Montrose, twelve miles 
distant. The only village is Fettercairn, which is a burgh of ba- 
rony on the estate of Fettercairn. There are two fairs held in it 
annually, the one at Whitsunday and the other at Martinmas. It 
has a post-office, at which a foot-post daily arrives with mails from 
Montrose, about half-past eight o'clock a. m., and from which he 
departs at two o'clock p. m. A carrier travels to Montrose every 
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and to Aberdeen every second 
Tuesday. A stage-coach runs between Aberdeen and Dundee 
through the parish each day except Sunday, starting from Dundee 
at seven, and from Aberdeen at half-past ten o'clock every morn- 
ing, and passing through Forfar, Brechin, Slateford, Fettercairn, 
Auchinblae, Drumlithie, and Stonehaven. There is no turnpike- 
road in the parish ; but commutation roads traverse it in various 
directions, which, together with bridges and fences, are well at- 
tended to, and generally kept in good condition. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is not conveniently si- 
tuated for many of the parishioners, being placed near the north - 
east extremity of the parish, and five miles distant from some of 
the inhabitants towards the south-west. It was built in 1804 to 
contain 800 sitters, but it can accommodate considerably more, and 
is in good repair. The sittings are all attached to the land except 
those provided for the minister and elders, and are therefore free 
only to the tenant. 

The following benefactions were left, at different times, to the 
poor, by benevolent persons in their latter wills, viz. L. 500, by Dr 
Kamsay of Barbadoes ; L. 50, by Provost Christie of Montrose ; 
200 merks Scotch, by James Black, the builder of the original 
Gannachy Bridge, formerly mentioned ; L. 20, by George Cooper, 
late merchant in Slateford ; L. 50, by R. Valentine, late tenant in 
BogindoUo; and L. 19, 19s. lid., by Anthony Glen, late manu- 
facturer in Luthermuir ; several hundred pounds, in houses and 
other property, were left by James Smith, late manufacturer in 
Fettercairn, to be under the management of certain trustees, for 
behoof of indigent persons not upon the regular poor's roll. 

The manse was built in 1774, and repaired and enlarged in 
1822. The glebe is about six Scotch acres of extent, is good al- 
luvial soil, and worth about L. 3 per acre per annum. The sli-

pend is 16 chalders, half barley, half meal, with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for 
conaiuinion elements. There is no chapel of ease nor any dis- 
senting place of pubhc worship in the parish. But there are 52 
individuals who are not of the communion of the Established 
Church, viz. Independents, 14; Episcopalians, 13; Bereans, 14; 
of the United Associate Synod, 6 ; Anabaptists, 2 ; of the Relief 
Synod, 2 ; and 1 Roman Catholic. This hst does not include the 
members of the two proprietors" families formerly mentioned as re- 
siding in the parish only occasionally, they being at present non-re-, 
sident therein. The number of families which attend the Establish- 
ed Church cannot be exactly known, as some families are divided 
between it and the above denominations of worshippers ; but it 
may be stated at about 377, and the individuals of all ages who 
generally attend public worship, may be about 1300, making thus 
an allowance of about 330 for children, infirm, and aged persons, 
and those now mentioned as not in communion with it. Di- 
vine service is well attended by all ranks. The average number 
of communicants is about 850, including those who attend from 
the adjoining parishes of Fordoun and Marykirk, for the sake of 
convenience. The average amount of collections annually in the 
church, for religious and charitable purposes, may be about L. 85, 
including collections for infirmaries and the parish library. The 
collections which were formerly made in behalf of the Bible So- 
ciety, the Highland Schools, and the India Mission, are not includ- 
ed in this sum. For promoting the interests of these institutions, 
a parochial association, on Dr Duff's plan, was last year formed, 
and raised L. 16, to be divided between them and the Church Ex- 
tension scheme. Its operations are not this year yet completed, but 
are expected to be as successful as last year's were. 

Education. — There are five schools in the parish, which supply 
daily instruction toabout 190 children, viz. the parochial school, which 
is supported by the maximum legal salary, a mortification in land 
yielding L. 2, 15s. per annum, and the school fees of about 68 scho- 
lars, which may amount to L. 30 per annum. His other emolu- 
ments, including session-clerk's fees, amount to about L. 15 per 
annum. The languages and all other branches of parochial edu- 
cation are taught in the parish school.— A private school at Dal- 
ladies, supported by the school fees of about 36 scholars, paying 
from 3s. 6d, to 6s. per quarter, school-room and schoolmaster's 
house rent free. All branches taught in the parochial school are 
taught in it. A private school at Inch of Arnhall, supported by the 
fees of about 30 scholars, paying from 3s. to 4s. per quarter, sciiool-

room rent free, — reading, writing, arithmetic, and English gram- 
mar taught. — A private school at Oldmains of Fasque, supported 
by the fees of about 30 scholars, paying from 2s. 6d. to 4s. per 
quarter, school-room rent free, — the same branches as in the 
last taught. — A female school in the village, in which reading and 
needle-work are taught, supported by a small salary paid by two 
of the heritors, viz. Sir John Stuart Forbes, Bart, and Mr Glad- 
stone during their pleasure, and by the fees of about 26 scholars, 
paying from 3s. to 5s. per quarter. Besides these, about 40 chil- 
dren are instructed daily in smaller places of elementary tuition 
throughout the parish. A Sunday school is taught in the church 
throughout the year, and is attended by upwards of 80 children, who 
have received prizes from one of the heritors, for several years, for 
proficiency, regular attendance, and good conduct. Another Sun- 
day's school is taught on the Arnhall estate, at which from 20 to 30 
scholars attend. By one or other of these means, instruction is pro- 
vided for all the rising generation, within a convenient distance from 
their respective places of abode. There are few, if any, between six 
and fifteen years of age who cannot either read or write ; and there 
are, it is thought, as w above that age who cannot do both. The 
people, in general, seem alive to the benefits of education, and 
make great efforts to keep their children as long as possible at 
school. There can be no doubt that, to some extent or other, 
their morals and conduct have improved with the increased facili- 
ties afforded them for education. 

Libraries. — There are two libraries in the village. One of 
them belongs to the Fettercairn Club ; and the circulation of its 
books is confined to the members of the Club and their families. 
It contains above 500 volumes on miscellaneous subjects. The 
other is a parish hbrary, under the management of the minister 
and elders. It is supported by donations of books and cash, and 
by occasional collections in the church. . It contains nearly 400 
volumes on various subjects, but chiefly on religion. The books 
are given out gratis for perusal ; and there generally are from 80 
to 120 readers. 

Savings Bank. — A savings' bank was established in 1831. It 
has succeeded well Amount yearly invested, L. 126 ; with- 
drawn, L. 79. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The average number of regular 
paupers is about 40 ; their average rate per month, 4s. ; occa- 
sional paupers about 15 ; their average rate per annum, about L. 1. 

 Sir John Stuart Forbes, Bart. 



FETTERCAIRN.

The average annual collections for their support amount to about 
L. 70. From mortcloth dues, occasional donations, interest of so 
much of the above enumerated benefactions as still remain available, 
and other incidental means, arise about L. 50 more— making, in 
all, for behoof of the poor, with clerks' and officers' fees, and 
casual expenses, L. 120 per annum. 

Many are very reluctant, and others very anxious, to be put 
upon the poor's roll. The majority, however, struggle long with 
poverty, before they can bring themselves to submit to accept of 
public charity. 

Inns. — There are 3 inns in the parish, 2 of which are in the 
village. 

Fuel — In the higher situations, the fuel is principally peat and 
tiu'f, the expense and trouble of procuring which are considerable. 
In the lower situations, it is partly peat, and partly wood, but 
chiefly English coals, brought from Montrose. These, at the 
ship, cost from Is. Id. to Is. 3d. per barrel of 11 stones 9 pounds 
imperial ; and the expense of carriage to the village, when charged, 
is from 6d. to 7d. more. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
From the foreafoinff statement, it must be evident that the im- 
provements in this parish, either begun or completed, since the 
last Statistical Account was published, have been of great extent. 
Much waste ground has been reclaimed, and converted into pro- 
ductive arable land. Extensive plantations of wood have been 
formed, which are -now, generally, in a thriving state, and adding 
to the shelter of the fields, the beauty of the landscape, the re- 
sources of the proprietors, and the benefit of the neighbourhood. 
Better accommodations in the dwelling houses, farm-steadings,' 
and enclosures, have been provided. By means of extensive and 
judicious draining, the salubrity of the atmosphere has been im- 
proved, the state of disease has been altered, and the health of 
the people promoted. By the introduction of thrashing-mills, and 
other useful inventions, agricultural labour has been greatly di- 
minished. By the formation of so many commutation roads, in- 
ternal communication and access to markets have been very 
much facilitated. Enlarged means of intellectual, moral, and re- 
ligious improvement have been called into operation ; and, it is 
to be hoped, the habits, manners, and enjoyments of the people 
have, in some measure, kept pace with the increase of these ad- 
vantages. 



128 



KINCAUDlNlCSlllRK. 



It has been suggested tliat these advantages might yet farther 
be hicreased by some ameUoratipn of the cottage system. As the 
Highland or Agricultural Society of Scotland have taken up the 
consideration of this subject, it may be expected that the result 
of their patriotic measures will be, an addition to the comfort of 
a most useful and deserving class of the community. 

It has also been suggested, with a view to identify and promote 
more effectually the interests and sympathies of landlord and te- 
nant, that, in the letting of land, it might be an improvement, to 
make the amount of rent depend on the fiars prices of the county, 
either in whole or in part. This would -certainly be as equitable 
a plan as the fluctuations in the value of farm produce could ad- 
mit of, with this condition, that it might be expedient, in dear 
years, to have a maximum, to protect the tenant, and in cheap 
years, a minimum, to give a corresponding protection to the land- 
lord.

I. Topography and Natural History. 

2Vame.— The ancient name of this parish was Conveth ; but in 
the course of the last century, it came to be known only by the 
name of Laurencekirk, originally applicable only to the Kirk-town, 
and derived from the dedication of the church to St Laurence. 
When the old church, built in 1626, was taken down in 1804, 
there were found in different parts of the wall, stones apparently of 
even an older date than the building, on which the figure of a man 
lying on a gridiron was carved, representing, it was supposed, the 
martyrdom of St Laurence. Some of the stones were inserted in 
the walls of the new church.-]-

the old Hatrerton Jitle-deeds : The lands called Diraeroft, ahas felaker wth

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish extends in length from 
west by south to east by north about 4 miles, varying in breadth 
from about 3 miles at the western extremity, to less than a mile at 
the other, and contains about 8i square miles. It is situated in 
the How of the Mearns, the eastern part of the great valley of 
Strathmore, and is bounded on the south-west by Marykirk ; on the 
south-east by Garvock ; and on the north-east and north-west by 
Fordoun. The boundary with Garvock is somewhat indistinct, fol- 
lowing the line of an old earthen fence, known by the name of the 
Rae or Deer Dike, of which many traces are still visible, and which 
probably enclosed the forest of Garvock. 

Topographical Appearances, ~c. — The figure of the parish is ir- 
regular, somewhat resembling, however, that of a triangle. The 
greater portion lies on the lower part of the north side of the hill 
of Garvock, sloping down to the Luther, and rising again with 
a very gradual declivity, on the other side of that stream. In 
the north-east corner of the parish, the ground again declines 
slightly towards the east, so that the water of what was for- 
merly a large morass is divided, and flows, partly westward to the 
Luther, and partly eastward to Bervie Water. The Luther thus 
divides the parish into two sections, of which the one on the 
southern side is intersected longitudinally by the great north road 
from Edinburgh to Aberdeen, on each side of which thoroughfare, 
in the south-west part of this section, stands the village of Lau- 
rencekirk. The whole parish is rather flat. The Luther is 
about 180 feet above the level of the sea; the highest ground in 
the northern section about 220 ; and in the southern, adjoining 
Garvock, about 450. 

The temperature of the district on the whole is mild. From ob - 
servations, more or less regular, made during a number of years, 
the average height of the mercury in a thermometer in the shade 
throughout the year, appears to be about 46° at 8 a. m., and 
about 45° at 10 p. m. The easterly haars seldom come across 
the hill of Garvock; and the cold air of the Grampians is con- 
siderably mitigated by the distance of several miles. The pre- 
vailing winds are south and south-east. In spring, these winds 
are often accompanied by long tracts of dry weather. In summer, 
there are frequent south-west winds, which are rather rainy. In 

years ago, there were dug out in a field there what seemed to be the foundation walls of 
such a buiklurg. A circular tumulus of rock immediately adjoininrrs to tuis dav 
called the " Chapel Knap and the " Mill of Conveth," the only place wh oh ro 
tarns the ancient name of Conveth, is scarcely half a mile distant

harvest, westerly winds prevail; but in the month of August, this 
district is occasionally visited by severe northerly storms, which 
break down and injure the crop.  The climate is favourable to 
health. There are no prevalent distempers in the district. 

Hydrop-aph/. —There is a mineral spring at Johnston, the waters 
of which are chalybeate and of considerable strength. The small 
stream of Luther, which runs through the parish in a direction 
from north-east to south-west, takes its rise in the lower ridge of 
the Grampian hills in the parish of Fordoun ; and about three 
miles below the mill of Blackiemuir, which is in the north-west 
corner of this parish, it falls into the North Esk. In its course, 
the Luther has formed several considerable fields of alluvial de- 
posit, of which great part were brought into cultivation a good 
many years ago, and have been found extremely productive. 
About eighty or ninety acres remain uncultivated, in consequence 
of circumstances afterwards referred to. 

Soil—'' The whole of the district to the south of the Luther 
may be described as a deep clay loam, incumbent on clay and 
freestone, generally rich and productive. That part below the 
village of Laurencekirk, is rather a cold clay on a retentive sub- 
soil. The haugh ground on each side of the Luther consists of 
alluvial deposits of clay and sand, which being incorporated with

the original soil, clay, is well adapted for agricultural purposes. 
■ The section of the parish north of the Luther is inferior, in every 
respect, to that already described ; the soil is generally cold and 
moorish, and is incumbent on a retentive bottom, or on clay mixed 
with coarse gravel, strongly impregnated with iron. The land has 
been partially drained ; but much still remains to be done in this 
respect. From the retentive nature of the subsoil, the operation 
is rendered expensive, and the success is by no means certain."  

Plantations. — The plantations in the parish consist chiefly of 
larch, spruce, and Scots firs, generally on inferior moorish ground. 
The soil appears rather favourable to the growth of hard wood. 
On the grounds where the old mansion-house of Haulkerton was si- 
tuated, there is a good deal of old wood of various kinds, and there 
are several oak trees at Johnston ; hedge-rows of ash, elm, and 
beech appear to do well, where attention is paid to pruning and 
protection. 

II. — Civil History. 
There are no ancient records connected with the parish, or an- 
tique relics belonging to it. A good many years ago, there was 
found in a field, near Johnston Lodge, a small Roman coin, with 
a different head and inscription on either side, but the only words 
legible are Aurelius on the one side, and Antoninus on the other. 
It is in the possession of Mrs Farquhar, About twenty years ago, 
a considerable number, nearly forty, of large silver coins were found 
on the farm of Northhill, about the foundation of the old dwelling- 
house. They were mostly, if not all, Spanish, and in excellent 
condition. A good many of them are still preserved in the neio-h- 
bourhood, and have dates 1616, 1622, 1623. The only plans' of 
the parish are those of the different estates belonging to the several 
proprietors, besides that included in Mr Garden's general map of 
the county. The first remarkable fact in the history of the parish 
maybe considered to be the erectionof the Burgh of Barony in 1779. 

Eminent Men. — Among the eminent characters with which the 
parish may claim connection, may be mentioned Thomas Ruddi- 
man, the grammarian, who was settled parochial schoolmaster in 
1695, at the age of twenty, and continued in that office till 1700 
when he was taken to Edinburgh by the well-known Dr Pitcairn'. 

The name of Francis Garden, commonly called Lord Garden- 
stone, as one of the Lords of Session, is intimately associated with 
the history of this parish. He was the second son of Garden of 
Troup, and was born June 24th 1721. In 1765, he began to

build a new village on the estate of Johnston, which he had re- 
cently purchased, and, in 1779, he got the village erected, by 
royal charter, into a burgh of barony, and, on occasion of present- 
ing the charter, he addressed " a Letter to the people of Laurence- 
kirk," afterwards published, in which he gave them salutary ad- 
monitions as to their conduct, strongly exhorting them to culti- 
vate habits of industry, frugality, and sobriety. It was chiefly at 
his expense, that, during his lifetime, an Episcopal chapel was 
built, for the minister of which he provided an endowment. Other 
two public buildings were erected, of which the one is now used 
partly as a mason lodge, and partly as a town-hall, and the other 
formed a neat library adjacent to a very commodious inn. In va- 
rious other ways, he took an active interest in promoting the pros- 
perity of the burgh, the inhabitants of which reached the number of 
500 before his death in 1793. 

The most eminent individual connected with the parish by birth, 
is Dr James Beattie, Professor of Moral Philosophy in Marischal 
College, Aberdeen, and author of " The Minstrel," and of " the 
Essay on Truth." He was born in 1735, on the farm of Borrow- 
muirhiUs, which is closely adjoining to the village of Laurence- 
kirk, and of which his father was at that time tenant, and the 
descendants of a sister of Beattie are still in possession. His ne- 
phew, James Beattie, Professor of Natural History in Marischal 
College, was likewise a native of this parish. It is also worthy of 
note, as connected with the history of this parish, that, for the 
third part of a century, it was under the pastoral care of Dr 
George Cook, the eminent historian of the Church of Scotland, 
who was ordained minister of Laurencekirk in 1795, and remained 
till 1828, when he became Professor of Moral Philosophy in the 
University of St Andrews. 

Land-oioners.—T\\e land-owners among whom the property ot 
the parish is divided, are four. The Earl of Kintore, to whom,

part of the country, has upwards of 4000 acres in this parish; 
Alexander Gibbon, Esq. of Johnston, has under 700 acres ; Red- 
myre, extending- to about 230 acres, belongs to Mr Allardyce in 
Aberdeen ; and the small property of Mill of Conveth, consisting 
of about 25 acres, belongs to Dr Alexander Crombie, chief pro- 
prietor in the adjoining parish of Fordoun, the distinguished au- 
thor of the " Gymnasium," and of other well-known works, on 
" Philosophical Necessity," " Natural Theology," &amp;c. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers have been, on 
the whole, regularly kept, and contain tolerably minute records of 
the proceedings of the kirk-session, of the management of the 
poor funds, and of baptisms and marriages. The earliest entry is 
April 3, 1702. 

Modern Buildings. — There are no remarkable edifices in 
the parish. The church — to which the Episcopalian Chapel on 
a smaller scale is not dissimilar — has too much the character 
of most Scotch churches, more remarkable for plainness than 
for elegance or ornament. Johnston Lodge, the seat of the pro- 
prietor of Johnston, is a neat modern structure, and stands on a 
site commanding an extensive and happily chosen view of the 
Valley of Strathmore, and the Grampian Hills. It was built 
partly of stones quarried on the estate ; but the materials usually 
employed in the parish are driven from Lauriston quarry, in the 
parish of St Cyrus, distant about six miles, — of which the stone 
is of a brownish colour, and sufficiently durable. 

III. — Population. 
According to Dr Webster's calculation, — the earliest on record, 
— the population of the parish amounted, in 1755, to 757 souls. If 
the accuracy of the registers ofbirths and marriages could be depend- 
ed on, an estimate might be formed of the population in earlier times. 
The registers are very imperfect from 1707 to 1716, partly in con- 
sequence of a vacancy in the ministry of the parish for three years 
previous to 1711, from the parties concerned repeatedly disagree- 
ing as to the person who should receive a call, and partly in con- 
sequence of the seizure of documents from the schoolmaster, dur- 
ing the Rebellion in 171 5.t The following is an abstract of the 
entries from 1716 to 1732. 

• Quarries were at one time opened on two different parts of the estate, but tl.ev 
have been found ot little value, and have been discontinued.

From the state of the country after the Rebellion, the first se- 
ven of these years may be omitted. 

Number of illegitimate births in the course of the last three 
years, 14 or 15. 

During the last ten of these years, the average number of mar- 
riages, in which both parties were in the parish, is about 3|, 
and of the others about 7, of which the half, or 3f, being added 
to 3, gives 7i, the number of marriages corresponding to the 
population of the parish. If we take 1 to 110, as the propor- 
tion of marriages to the population at that period, and multi- 
ply 7hy 110, we have 795 as the population of the parish. 
It is not unlikely, and there is appearance on the register which 
renders it probable, that the births were not registered so re- 
gularly as the marriages :— we may safely, however, take 25 
as not less than the average number of actual births between 
1723 and 1732; and if we suppose 1 to 30 to have been the 
proportion of births to the population, and multiply 25 by 30, we 
have 750 as the population of the parish. These calculations, 
thoush founded on somewhat uncertain data, seem sufficiently to 

moneth of September jai yij and fifteen years. This is attested at Conveth Kirk, 
Febr 1st 1716, by Signed " R- Mortimer, Sess. Clk. 

Again in the minutes of session, " Sept. 25 1715 -No sermon here this day, in 
re-aird of the confusion and disturbances in the cour.trie." There appears to have 
been no sermon till February 19th 1716. The session had in the raeantnne taken 
« care of the session box, with the money and papers therein, and laid it up in a se- 
cure place," minute of October 10 ; and of date February 1st, there is the follow- 
ins entrie : " The elders, finding that the box and cuppes are under the ground, did 
think fitt to look them, to see if they were spoil'd • which they did ""dmgly , and 
delivered the two cuppes to Alexander Cow.e," one ot their number, to keep. 
As for die box, they delay the ordering of it till Sabbath next,_but there being a 
fonfusion in the countrie before Sabbath, the elders mett, and putt up the box in a 
private place." « March 9th, It was thought fitt to hft the box and the cuppes, be- 
ing beneath the ground, which was done accordingly."

indicate, that the population towards the beginning of last century 

was not under — probably above — what Dr Webster made it in 
1755, 757 souls.

According to a census taken by the minister in the beginning of 
1835, the population amounted to 1938, of whom 1391 were 
within the limits of the burgh. The following numbers, according 
to that census, will show the description of persons of whom the po- 
pulation of the parish chiefly consists. Of hand-loom weavers there 
are 68 ; day-labourers, 46 ; married farm-servants, 39 ; shoemakers 
or cobblers, 16 ; wrights or carpenters, 8 ; masons, 8; tailors, 7 ; all 
of whom are heads of families. Of weavers there are also 44 unmar- 
ried men and boys ; 35 unmarried females, including widows, be- 
sides a few married women. Along with these may be mentioned 
7 men and 25 women employed at the spinning-mill of Blaclcie- 
muir. 

It will be observed that there has been a continued diminution 
m the number of inhabitants in the rural portion of the parish. 
There can be no hesitation in ascribing this diminution, in great 
part, to the altered mode of letting farms, by which several are 
united under one tenant. The tenants, partly from this cause, 
and partly from others, now employ unmarried servants more fre- 
quently than those that are married,— a system which contributes 
to send into the villages a large proportion of the married agricul- 
tural labourers,— a valuable part of our population, but not likely 
to be improved in such a situation. This system tends further to 
destroy, in a great degree, the connection between master and ser- 
vants,— the unmarried class being more changeable, and more in- 
dependent of their masters. The character of this connection is 
greatly injured, also, by the universal practice of engaging the un- 
married servants only at the term-day market, when previous good 
conduct will be of less avail to the servant for procuring another 
engagement, than a plausible exterior. The increase in the 
village population, arising in part from the circumstances just 
adverted to, is mainly owing, in this parish, to the establish- 
ment of the agencies of several weaving companies. The general 
effect of such establishments has been, to draw to the towns and 
villages all who are engaged in manufacturing employment At 
a former period, not yet beyond the recollection of persons alive 
there was carried on, in this quarter, an extensive domestic munu'

facture of linen, which was commonly known in the markets by the 
name of " Mearns linen," and the spinning of the yarn, and manu- 
facturing of the cloth, afforded employment to many hands in the 
famiUes both of tenants and of crofters. This system is now en- 
tirely done away : at the old markets which used to be held seve- 
ral days in succession, the day formerly appropriated for the 
sale of linen is a blank ; all those employed in weaving have, 
with scarcely an exception, gone to the villages, and there, at 
least in Laurencekirk, by far the greater part work, not at home, 
but in public weaving-shops. The population of the village in- 
creased very rapidly from the earlier part of this century, till about 
seven years ago, but since that time it has been making less rapid 
progress, in consequence of the state of trade, and of the wages 
which hand-loom weavers now earn being exceedingly low, — fre- 
quently 8s. a-week, by working fifteen or sixteen hours a-day. The 
yearly average of births may be stated as about 60, and that of 
deaths about 38 ; that of marriages in which both parties belong 
to the parish, 9; and 8 where either party is of a different parish. 

The average number of persons of the following ages may be 
stated as under. 



Under 15, 
16, and under 30,

There are only 21 males of fifty years of age or upwards, who 
are unmarried, all of them being widowers except 5. There are 
about 112 females above forty-five who are unmarried. 

According to the census in 1835, there were 467 families in- 
cluding in that number single individuals living alone, 366 in the 
burgh, and 101 in the country. In the character of children m 
these families, i. e. of unmarried persons, of any age, living in the 
houses of their parents, there were 625 and 192 respectively, m 
burgh and in country, in all, 817. According to this calculation, 
the proportion of children to a family, in the burgh is 1.7 to 1, m 
the country 1.9 to 1, and over the parish, 1.75 to 1. If we deduct 
from the number of families the number of single unmarried 
persons, widowed or not living alone, there remain in burgh 
272, and in country 83 families, among whom the same number 
of children has to be divided, making the proportion 2.3 to 1 in 
the burgh, and 2.31 to 1 in the country : and if we deduct farther

the married persons, who either have had no children, or with 
whom none of their children are now residing, there remain 217 and 
67 families, to whom the 817 children actually belong, making 
the proportion 2.88 to 1 in the burgh and 2.87 to 1 in the country. 
There are 315 houses within the burgh, and 100 in the country, 
of which all, with the exception of five of the former, are more or 
less occupied. 

Each of the four proprietors draws more than L. 50 of rent 
from land in this parish. None of them reside in it ; but Mr 
Gibbon of Johnston resides in the neighbourhood, and Johnston 
Lodge is occupied by Mrs Farquhar, the relict of James Farquhar, 
Esq. of Johnston. 

There has of late been scarcely any building in the parish, ex- 
cept where new houses have been erected in place of such as were 
decayed : indeed, so small appears to be the demand for addi- 
tional dwelling-houses, that several portions of ground which 
were feued some years ago still remain without any building up- 
on them. The situation of the village affords no peculiar advan- 
tages for increase. It is about six miles from any quarry of suita- 
ble building stones ; there is little or no command of any other 
fuel than coal, which is all sea-borne to Johnshaven or Mon- 
trose, and from the latter there is a land carriage of ten miles and 
from the former upwards of seven. Notwithstanding these circum- 
stances, and the rapid and superabundant increase of population, 
the inhabitants may be said to enjoy, in a reasonable degree, the 
comforts and advantages of society ; — and, notwithstanding the 
difficulties with which many of them have to contend, they appear 
in general to be contented. The diet of the labouring classes 
consists, usually, of meal, milk, and potatoes. Fish is had in consi- 
derable abundance ; and the use of wheaten bread and of butcher 
meat is by no means uncommon, as is vouched by the fact, that 
there are in the village three bakers, and as many butchers, 
though all of them may not be fully employed in their profes- 
sion. There are two surgeons resident in the village. The 
habits of the people are cleanly ; their houses, for the most part, 
are kept in good order, undergoing generally more or less of a 
weekly purification : and it both iihproves the appearance of 
the place, and promotes the health of the inhabitants, and their 
taste for order, that there is attached to almost every dwelling-house 
a small piece of garden ground, in keeping which neatly, neigh- 
bours have a spirit of becoming emulation. The people are at- 



138 



KINCAllDINESHIUE. 



tentive to religious services, although the want of church accom- 
modation is unfortunately producing a visible change on the indi- 
vidual attendance on divine worship. On the whole, if the trade 
of hand-loom weaving were a little better, the church somewhat 
larger, and the public-houses two thirds less in number, and 
less frequented, Laurencekirk, might present a favourable speci- 
men of a thriving Scottish village. The general healthiness of the 
situation has already been noticed. 

It may be added, that while there are three or four individuals, 
who can scarcely be said to possess soundness of mind, there is 
only one insane person connected with the parish ; but three others 
reside, as boarders in a family who have long had the care of 
persons in this unfortunate condition. There are two aged women 
quite blind, and two young boys affected with nearly total loss of 
sight. There is no deaf and dumb person in the parish. 

IV. — Industry. 

In regard to the particulars connected with agriculture, the 
following valuable information was supplied by Mr Robertson in 
183-2. 

« The contents of the parish amount to 5381 imperial acres, 
'classed as under. 

" ]. Arable, . • 5000 ,

" The whole of the woods in the parish have been planted. 
The plantations consist chiefly of larch, spruce, and Scotch firs, 
with a few deciduous trees intermixed. The hedge-rows and de- 
tached trees are chiefly ash, elms and beech, with a few oaks, 
birch and sycamore. None of the fir plantations are supposed 
to exceed sixty years of age, the greater part not much more than 
thirty. Some of the old trees about Johnston Lodge, and the 
site of the mansion-house of Haulkerton, those near the manse, 
and a few in the hedge -rows and gardens of the diff"erent farms, 
may perhaps be from eighty to a hundred years old. The fir 
plantations are carefully pruned and thinned, and the hedge-rows 
and hardwood trees have, foV some years past, been pruned and , 

attended to. , , , • , t i q 

jll « The average rent of the arable land is about i. 1, ds. 

per imperial, or L. 1, Ss 6d. per Scots acre. In the vicinity of the 



LAURENCEKIRK. 



139 



village, the land, though poor, is let at the rate of from L. 2 to 
L. 2, 16s. per imperial acre. 

" There are no cattle or sheep grazed in the parish by the 
season, all the pasture being consumed by the cattle reared or fed 
by the occupiers of land. 

Rate of Labour. — " The following are the usual ratesof the wages 
of agricultural labourers : — Married men-servants are engaged by 
the year, and generally get a house and garden, a cow kept, and six 
and a-half bolls of meal, and some potatoes, besides several barrels 
of coals, s-ome brush-wood for fuel, and from L. 6 to L. 8 yearly of 
money wages. Unmarried ploughmen are engaged half-yearly, 
and their wages vary from L. 5 to L. 6, 10s. for the six months, 
with two pecks of oatmeal weekly, an allowance of milk, and a 
quantity of potatoes, with lodging and fuel. Boys are from L. 1, 10s. 
to L. 3, 10s. half-yearly, with the usual allowance for keep. Men 
in harvest get about L. 2, 10s. with victuals and beer. Labourers 
by the day receive in summer Is. 8d. to 2s.5 in winter about 
Is. 3d. to Is. 6d., and in harvest, besides victuals, 2s. 6d. to 3s. 
Women-servants' wages are about L. 2 for winter half-year, and 
from L. 3 to L. 4 for summer half-year. When engaged by the 
day for working in the fields, they get7d. in winter, and 8d. or 
9d. in summer. When engaged for harvest they get from L. 1, 15s. 
to L. 2 with victuals. Reapers get for cutting per threave, 3d. 
or 3d. without victuals." For eight or]nine years past, however, 
almost all the farmers have cut down their crops with the scythe. 

" In regard to the prices of different articles of produce, or mate- 
rials employed in agriculture, and the wages of country tradesmen, 
the following particulars may be stated : — Flax per stone of 14 lb. 
7s. ; wool from 7s. to 9s. per imperial stone ; yarn, hand-spun, 
none made ; yarn mill-spun, see Manufactures ; linen cloth, home 
made, none made for sale; lime per boll, 2s. lid.; dung per 
double horse load from Laurencekirk, 6s. ; slates, Dunkeld, 
L. 2, 5s. per 1000; slates, Easdale, L. 3, 3s. per 1000 ; slates, 
Turin, 10s. per 100; tiles, L. 4 per 1000 ; masons per day, with- 
out victuals, in summer, 2s., in winter, Is. 8d. ; carpenters, without 
victuals, in summer, 2s. 3d., in winter Is. 8d. ; ruble mason work, 
per rood of 36 ells, including carriage and price of materials, from 
L.6, 10s. to L. 7, 10s. 

Livestock. — " The horses used for agricultural purposes are ge- 
nerally bought in the west country markets, particularly in those of 
Stirhng, Lanark, and Ayrshires; but, of late years, the greater part 



140 



KINCARDINESHIRE. 



have been reared in the parish, to which branch of rural economy 
much attention is now paid. Colts reared in the parish resemble 
the Lanark or Clydesdale breed, but have less bone. The colours 
preferred are black or dark bay. 

" The cattle are generally a mixture of the Angus and Aber- 
deen breeds, but nearer the Aberdeenshire ; the colour black and 
polled ; they have the deep and broad chest of the Aberdeen ox, 
and are not so long in the spine as the Angus breed. Great at- 
tention is paid to the rearing of black-cattle ; and.great care taken 
in selecting the animals to breed from. Part are generally sold in 
the autumn, when rising three years old, for the road, i. e. for the 
English market, and part fed in winter and sold for the Glasgow 
market, where they fetch the highest prices."  Some of the best 
animals have lately been sent, by the Aberdeen and Dundee steam 
vessels, and more lately by the Montrose steamer, to London, where 
they find a ready sale, and generally bring a remunerating price. 

" No sheep are reared in the parish, and very few are grazed 
or fed. 

Husbandry. — " The convertible system of husbandry is universally 
followed ; and as the soil is best adapted for the grass and turnip hus- 
bandry, what is called the shift course is generally adopted. The 
four-shift course is followed where the soil is a deep loam, and even 
in inferior soils near Laurencekirk, where there is a command of 
manure. Where manure is at a distance, a seven-shift course has 
been tried by some farmers, two successive white crops being taken 
after the land has been in grass for three years ; but this course 
is by no means common. The drill husbandry, as applicable to 
the cultivation of green crops, is universally followed ; but after 
some slight trials, this mode of sTwing white crops has been aban- 
doned. Lime has until lately been applied to fallow land ; but as 
the prices obtained for produce are now ' peace' prices, while the 
rents paid are still ' war' rents, the quantity of lime applied is di- 
minishing yearly, and, it is to be feared, that a diminution of the 
produce must be the consequence. 

" The usual duration of leases is nineteen years, and the con- 
ditions of lease are those now generally introduced over Scotland. 
Although the tenant is bound to a certain rotation of cropping, yet 
this is seldom strictly attended to, and he is generally left free to 
exercise his own judgment, and to follow what course may seem 
to himself most advantageous. 

" Of the farm-houses many are of two stories and slated, but they 



LAURENCEKIRK. 



141 



are of inferior size and accommodation ; the offices are slated, at 
least partially. At entry the buildings are made over at a valua- 
tion, and a small sum is given out of the first rents for making ad- 
ditions and repairs ; sometimes wood is also given upon inventory. 
At expiry of leases, the houses must be left of the same value, and 
of the additional value of the money and wood allowed by the pro- 
prietor at entry. Sometimes the tenant is allowed to meliorate to 
a certain extent over and above this, for which he is paid at his 
removal. No allowance is made to the tenant for carriages. This 
mode of keeping up, and of making additions to the farm-build- 
ings, by throwing the principal part of the burden on the tenant, is 
objectionable in many respects, and particularly as compelling him 
to apply capital for the purpose of building and repairing houses 
that ought to be used for the improvement of his farm, and in 
making a profitable return. 

" The parish is only very partially enclosed. About fifty or sixty 
years ago, after Lord Gardenstone purchased the lands of John- 
ston and Blackiemuir, the village was laid out on a regular plan, 
the whole estate was divided into regular fields, enclosed with 
hedges and hedge-rows, and plantations were also made with much 
taste on different parts of the estate. Except for the purpose of 
shelter and forming marches, between the different allotments of 
land, these hedges are now of little value ; but still with the hedge- 
rows, they give the village and adjacent ground a rich and wood- 
ed appearance. Part of the adjoining lands appear to have been 
enclosed with thorn-hedges about the time when Johnston had 
been enclosed; but to the hedges little attention has been paid, 
and few, if any, additional enclosures have since been formed. In 
this respect much remains to be done." 

" Few or no improvements have lately been made ; what has been 
done is chiefly in opening new roads through the parish, which is well 
supplied with what are called parish roads. The communication with 
the coast has been greatly improved by the opening of two leading 
lines of road, which pass at the eastern and western extremitiesof this 
parish, of which the one was made only recently, and the other about 
thirty years ago. Within the last twenty-five years about 80 acres 
of marshy grounds have been well drained ; but there is still a piece 
of land of nearly the same extent, standing greatly in need of the 
same improvement. This, however, cannot be effected without the 
removal of a dam-dike, of which the privilege belongs to the mill 



142 



KINCAUDINKSHIKE. 



of Blackiemuir, and the formation of a new channel for the Lu- 
ther, by the overflowing and stagnation of whose waters the marsh 
is occasioned. It is understood that arrangements have been in 
contemplation, with a view to this improvement ; and were it ac- 
complished, the whole district would be benefited, the hoar-frosts 
would be in a great measure prevented, which so frequently rise 
on these marshes, and to a considerable distance injure the sur- 
rounding crops, and much land, which at present is subject to be 
flooded,"and thus unfit for tillage, would be rendered of consider- 
able value. The remainder of the waste ground in the parish 
does not exceed 30 or 40 acres. 

" The ffreat obstacles to improvement are felt chiefly in the 
want of enclosures, of planting for the purpose of shelter, and of 
sufficient and substantial accommodation in the farm-buildings. 
There is no supply of proper building stone for dikes, and . the 
only substitute is hedges, yet, although the soil is well adapted for 
the growth of thorn and beech, the farms are generally open and 
unenclosed, and the whole district, though naturally fertile, pre- 
sents rather a bleak appearance. 

« Although there are serious and well grounded objections to 
throwing land into too great farms, yet there is a class of farms 
that are neither great nor small, varying from 100 to 130 acres, 
commonly called four horse farms, which are objectionable mmany 
respects Of this description a considerable part of the farms m 
this parish consist. It would be perhaps better, that after the 
croft of four acres, and the small farm of 40 or 50, there should 
be no intermediate class, until the extent amounts to nearly 300 
acres • of this class there are only three or four m the parish.

Manufactures. — " The principal manufacture in the parish is 
that of yarn from flax, and the weaving of linen. The only spin- 
ning-mill in operation is that of Blackiemuir, which employs about 
7 men and 25 women, who work generally fourteen hours a day, 
including an hour and a half for meals. The yarn manufactured 
at Blackiemuir is nearly as under :

" The other branch of the hnen trade consists in hand-loom weav- 
ing, the yarn for which is supplied chiefly by the great manufactur- 
ing houses in Aberdeen. The number of pieces and yards made an- 
nually may on an average be as under : Pieces 5812; yards 416,440, 
value, L. 13,106. The average sum obtained for weaving, being 
at the rate of Ud. per yard, is L. 2168, 19s. 2d. The weavers 
in general work about fifteen hours a day, and the most able and 
industrious seldom earn more than 7s. or 8s, a week. 

Snuff-Box Manufacture.—'' The only other branch of trade re- 
quiring to be noticed is that of the well-known Laurencekirk 
snuff-boxes. These were all originally made by Mr Stiven, the 
inventor, and the business is still carried on by his son ; but there 
are other tradesmen in the village also employed in the manufac- 
ture." 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Markets, -c— There are no market-towns in the parish, and 
there is no village except Laurencekirk. In terms of the charter 
procured by Lord Gardenstone, the village was « erected into a 
free and independent burgh of barony," the limits of which were de- 
clared to be 838 yards on each side of the King's highway, as far 
as it passed through his Lordship's lands, that is, for about three- 
quarters of a mile. A bailie and four councillors are tnennially 
elected on the first Wednesday of June, all resident feuars of 
legal age having the privilege of burgesses, and right to vote at 
elections : and the charter farther authorizes the holdmg of a 
weekly market, and of a free annual fair for three days succes- 
sively, beginning the first Wednesday of November. This fair 



LAURENCEKIRK. 



145 



is now held only on the Thursday. A weekly market was at- 
tempted some, years Jago, and has again been proposed, and there 
seems reason to think that it should succeed, if all parties con- 
cerned cordially joined in the attempt, as there is no market-town 
nearer than Montrose, which is upwards of nine miles from the 
nearest part of the parish, and thirteen from the most remote. 

Fairs. — There are seven annual fairs in the parish ; five of 
these are held within the burgh, — one in January, for engaging 
married farm- servants, — one at each of the terms of Whitsunday 
and Martinmas, for hiring unmarried servants, — and two cattle 
trysts, in, April and November ; the other two fairs are on Lau- 
rence muir, about a mile and a half from Laurencekirk, viz. the 
old established market of Laurence Fair, for the sale of cattle, 
horses, and sheep in August, and a cattle tryst in September. 

Means of Communication. — The parish enjoys abundant means 
of communication. There is a daily post ; and two different stao-e- 
coaches, the one by Dundee, and the other by Perth, pass every 
lawful day between Edinburgh and Aberdeen, from which latter 
place Laurencekirk is distant twenty-nine miles. There are like- 
wise several carriers passing weekly to Aberdeen, Perth, and 
Dundee, besides others to neighbouring towns and villages. 
There are four carriers to Montrose, each of whom goes two or 
three times a week. The length of the turnpike-road in the pa- 
rish is four miles. 

The situation of the parish church is, on the whole, very conve- 
nient, closely adjoining the village, and also the turnpike road. 
Three-fourths of the inhabitants are within a mile of the church" 
and there are only three famihes who have to travel so far as three' 
miles to it. It was built in ]804 ; and was enlarged in 1819, at 
the joint expense of the poor funds, and Mr Farquhar, the rents 
of the seats in the additional part being drawn by these parties 
It IS in tolerable repair, but is much too small for the congregation 
—a misfortune under which it seems the lot of this parishlo labour' 
In 1792, Mr Forbes, the writer of the former Statistical Ac 
count, says, « The church is by much too small for the congrega 
tion yet no addition was made to it, till it was rebuilt in 1804 • 
aiid fifteen years afterwards an enlargement became necessary 
The present church is calculated to hold about 760; but on this 
calculation less than eighteen inches are allowed for each sitting- 
of which the mconvenience is peculiarly felt, when the sitters 

" kSo:;" ""e --  church 



I 



' KINCAUDINKSHIRE. 

13 too small. The number of those actually communicating at the 
dispensation of the Lord's supper generally exceeds even the 
number of these calculated sittings by 120. All the sittings are 
either m the hands of heritors and their tenants, or let and occu- 
pied. 

The manse now consists of what were two successive additions, 
the one built in 1796, and the other in 1805, when the old manse 
was taken down, and the addition of 1796 left standing. Since 
1805, no farther changes have been made, except what were ne- 
cessary to keep the building in ordinary repair. The glebe con- 
sists of nearly 9 acres of arable land, which may be valued at about 
L. 20 per annum. The minister has also possessed, from time 
immemorial, a piece of ground of about 9 acres, at present let for 
L. 1, 3s. per acre, a mile distant from the manse, and surround- 
ed by Lord Kintore's lands. This possession, it is understood, 
was bestowed on the incumbent of the parish in times of Popery, 
and escaped only by its insignificance, from the hands which seiz- 
ed so large a portion of the Church property, at the period of the 
Reformation. 

The stipend consists of 16 chalders of grain, half barley and 
half meal, with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements ; and on the 
average of the last six years amounted to about L. 236. For crop 
1826, the stipend considerably exceeded the teind. The minister 
has the right of digging peats on a piece of ground called the Mi- 
nister's Moss, on the top of the Cairn of Mount, one of the Gram- 
pian Hills, — on which hill also the farmers on Lord Kintore's 
estate were in use to avail themselves of the privilege of digging 
peats; but for some years the practice has been much discontinued. 

The patronage of the church belongs to St Mary's College, 
St Andrews, to whom Archbishop John Hamilton, the last Roman 
Catholic Primate, gave the teinds of the parish, for the endow- 
ment of the recently erected college. 

• The following extracts from the deed may not be uninteresting. The title is, 
" Donatio Ecclesiae Parochialis de Conveth per Joannem Archiepiscopum St Andrese 
in favorem Magistrorum, Regentium, Capellanorum, Bursariorum, et Studentium 
Noyi Collegii." " Junii 2G. 1550." The rectory was vacant at the time of the do- 
nation, as appears from the following clause : " Cum itaque parochialis ecclesia rec- 
toria nuncupata de Conveth nostrae Sti Andreaa diocesis quam nuper bona; memoria5 
Magister Willielmus Lamb dum viveret obtinebat per obiium ejusdem Willielmi ex- 
tra Romanam curiam et in partibus defuncti vacaverit et vacet ad presens," &amp;-c. 
Another extract shews the provision made for the performance of the pa.storal duties 
in Conveth, and also affords some illustration of the general views at that time ex- 
pressed by the Romish Hierai-chy as to pastoral superintendence, " Volunuis autem 
quod propter perpetuam unionem, annexationem, et incorporationem praefatas paro- 
ehialis ecclesia de Conveth unita hujusmodi debitis propterea non fraudetur obsequiis

Lord Gardenstone having obtained funds, to which he himself 
lai'gely contributed, for building an Episcopalian chapel in the 
village of Laurencekirk, he attached to the lands of Johnston 
the burden of upholding the building, — of paying to the minister 
of the chapel who is presented by the proprietor of Johnston 
L. 40 and 40 bolls of meal annually, — and of maintaining a house 
for him. He likewise assigned a garden and three acres of ground 
to the minister, who draws nothing from the congregation, which is 
by no means numerous. There had formerly been an Episcopa- 
lian chapel near the village or Kirktown, on the south-east side of 
it, of which the remains are remembered by persons yet alive ; but 
it is not known when it was discontinued. There were also two 
small chapels about three or four miles distant from the vil- 
lage to the east and west, of which one was within this parish. 
These were used for some time after the Laurencekirk chapel was 
opened, but it is now many years since they were taken down. 
There are 159 persons in this parish connected with the chapel, 
according to the census of J 835, viz. 85 adults and 74 children. 

There is also a Berean meeting-house in the village, in which 
divine service is performed by a person, who follows a mechanical 
profession, who resides in the parish of Fettercairn, and officiates 
also there. It is attended by very few persons, the individuals of 
the Berean connection in this district being but scattered remains 
and descendants of the followers of Barclay, by whom the sect was 
founded in 1773. In this parish there are only 17 Bereans, all 
persons of advanced years, except 7, who compose one family. 
There is no other dissenting place of worship. The only other 
Dissenters are 13 Independents, two families and two single indi- 
viduals, who attend at Sauchieburn, in the parish of Marykirk ; 
9 Associate Synod Seceders, 7 adults and 2 children, who ge- 
nerally attend at Luthermuir, in the same parish ; and 1 Glassite. 

The average number of persons communicating at the dispen- 
sation of the Lord's supper, in the Established Church, is about 
880 : the actual number of communicants in the parish accord-

Church. 

Education. — Besides the parochial school, there are three other 
schools conducted by male teachers, and four schools conducted 
by females; but of the seven private schools none are endowed, 
or supported in any way, but by the school fees, excepting, per- 
haps, in the case of the male teachers, occasional assistance towards 
defraying the school-room rent. At the parish school, the master, 
who is a licentiate of the church, is qualified to teach all the 
branches usual at the better parochial schools of the country. 
The branches which he has actually taught are, English read- 
ing and grammar, writing, arithmetic, mathematics, mensuration, 
navigation, geography, and Latin. The school is attended by 
about 70. The salary of the schoolmaster is only L.20 in money, and 
10 bolls, 1 firlot, and 3 pecks of meal in kind, which is considerably 
less than the maximum salary. The school fees received by him 
in the year amount to about L. 30. He has neither house nor gar- 
den, but receives L. 8 instead of the former, and L. 2, 2s. in place 
of the other. He receives also annually L. 3, 6s. 8d. from the 
Glenfarquhar mortification, and the interest of L. 50 from the 
Charles donation ; and for these he teaches seven children gratis. 
The other three male teachers instruct their pupils in all about 
100 in English reading, and grammar, writing, and arithmetic, 
and occasionally in one or two other branches. The females are 
employed chiefly in teaching younger children to read, and in 
giving instructions in various kinds of female handiwork. There 
may be nearly 70 in all at their four schools. All the private 
teachers except one are of the Estabhshed Church, and in all 
the schools suitable attention is paid to the religious instruction 
of the pupils. The fee for English reading at the parochial 
school is 2s. 6d. per quarter, and for the other branches in propor- 
tion. At one or two of the private schools, the fees are somewhat 
higher, and at others lower. Children usually go to school when 
five years old, so that it can hardly be said that there are 
any between six and fifteen years of age who cannot either read 
or write, and there are scarcely any, not more perhaps than three 
or four, above that age who cannot read. There is no family 
distant more than about two miles from a school, either in this or in 
some adjoining parish, and few more than a mile. The inhabitants 



LAURENCEKIRK. 



M9 



in genercal shew a desire to avail themselves of this advantage. 
The proportion, hovi'ever, of children attending schools to the whole 
population is not above one to seven and a half or eight. It is the 
practice in not a few cases that children of a numerous family get 
a quarter or two at school in rotation, — sometimes even that two 
of them go alternately each day or meeting, — an imperfect system, 
to which it may be said, that poverty consents rather than their will. 
Frequently the children are sent to herding or to service in the sum- 
mer half-year, the winter months being reserved for farther educa- 
tion, if thought necessary, or found convenient. When they are sent 
to the loom, as is the case with a very large proportion of the 
children of the village, they are generally taken from school about 
the age of eleven or twelve, and seldom return to it at all ; and they 
too often enter on a life of busy care, with nearly as imperfect 
furniture in their minds, as their early marriages too frequently 
allow them to gather for their dwellings, before they are involv- 
ed in the expenses of a house and family. The chief advantage 
of education is derived from the encouragement of right principles, 
and the infusion of religious knowledge, and not from the mere 
acquisition of the faculty of reading, which may readily be turn- 
ed to an improper and unprofitable use. But it is to be feared, that 
young persons are often supposed to have received sufficient educa- 
tion, before they have reached an age when those impressions can 
be rightly made, which alone will preserve them against the influ- 
ence of the varied temptations among which they are to be speedily 
thrown. 

There are two foundations connected with the parochial school 
on which children receive education gratis. By a deed executed 
in 1716, Sir Alexander Falconer of Glenfarquhar whose repre- 
sentative is now the Earl of Kintore mortified the sum of L. 140 
Scots annually, of which L. 40 should be paid to the schoolmaster 
for teaching poor children, and the remaining L. 100 or 24 bolls 
of meal, in the option of his representative, should be divided 
among four boys of the name of Falconer, or born in the parish, 
who were also to be ia.ug\xt gratis. The same benevolent individual 
mortified by deeds of date 1712 and 1717 L. 500 Scots annual- 
ly, for the education of seven bursars, at the King's College of 
Aberdeen, of the names of Falconer, or Ramsay, or born in the 
parishes of Conveth or Fordoun, of whom three should receive 
L. 60 each, and the others L. 80 each ; the presentation now be 
longmg to his heir Lord Kintore, and Sir Alexander Ramsay 



150 



KINCARDINESHIRE. 



Bart, of Balinain. It is only the later of these deeds that is act- 
ed on, according to which there are four bursars. The Rev. John 
Charles, minister of Garvock, from a benevolent regard to the pa- 
rochial school at which he received the rudiments of education, 
presented to the kirk-session in 1825, the sum of L. .50, of which 
the interest should, in all time coming, be paid to the parish school- 
master, as the fees for his teaching two or more poor children to 
be named by the kirk-session. 

Libraries. — There are three libraries in the parish, more or 
less of a public kind. One belongs to the Episcopal clergy of the 
diocese of Brechin, and is deposited in the Episcopal chapel. It 
is indebted for its origin, and for most of its contents, to the late 
Bishop Abernethy Drummond, and now consists of upwards of 
1000 volumes, of which the greater number are theological, and 
some are of considerable value. Persons of literary education or 
pursuits in the neighbourhood have always experienced much li- 
berality in obtaining access to the library. Lord Gardenstone 
founded what he calls, " The Public Library]of Laurencekirk," and 
from various quarters he obtained donations of books for it. In 
the small but neat building, which was erected to contain the li- 
brary, a few rare shells, minerals, and stuffed birds were deposited, 
as the commencement of a sort of museum. His designs, however, 
were not prosecuted after his death, and the books and other con- 
tents have in various ways been greatly diminished. There has also 
been for several years a parochial library, consisting of about 300 
volumes chiefly for the use of the young, many of whom make fre- 
quent application for them. 

Friendly Societies. — There are four Friendly Societies in the 
parish, which survived the unfortunate and ill-founded panic,' pro- 
duced by the late act of Parliament, for the regulation of these 
valuable institutions. Since 1830 a species of Friendly Society has 
existed here, which is dissolved and renewed at the term of Whit- 
sunday yearly, each member depositing weekly a fixed sum, and 
also a small sum additional, to form a benefit fund for allowances, 
in case of sickness or death of members. At the annual dissolution, 
each member receives back the whole amount, with interest, of his 
fixed weekly deposits, and also his share of the remainder of the 
benefit fund, after payment of allowances and necessary expenses. 
The plan of the society is well fitted for those who receive their 
earnings from time to time, by enabling them to meet large term-

ly or other stated payments, or to gather such a sum as may be after- 
wards deposited in an institution of a more permanent kind. As 
connected with this parish, there may also be mentioned the Mearns- 
shire Farmer Society, which holds its meetings at Laurencekirk. 
It was instituted in 1 792, for making provision for the widows and 
children of deceased members, each widow receiving L. 10 an- 
nually. It has now a capital stock of upwards of L. 7000, and in- 
cludes among its members, in number about 120, persons of va- 
rious professions in the surrounding country. The present preses 
is the Viscount of Arbuthnott, who, with his well known pubhc 
spirit, has taken a very active interest in the welfare of the society. 
Poor and Parochial Funds. — There are, at present, 38 persons 
receiving a stated allowance out of the poor funds, — at an average 
of about L. 2, 10s. a year each, — and at least as many others re- 
ceiving occasional supply in sums of various amount, up to L. 1 an- 
nually. About one-fourth of the regular paupers are males, the 
others being chiefly aged women. The class of destitute women 
is rapidly increasing from the discontinuance of employments, 
by which females advancing in life were wont to earn some 
liveUhood ; yet such is the inevitable result of the extensive 
use of machinery. There is a pauper lunatic maintained in the 
Montrose asylum, the expense of whose board is paid by the heri- 
tors. The ordinary collections in church throughout the year 
amount to rather more than L. 60 ; from the letting of seats be- 
longing to the poor funds, see p. 145, there is drawn annually 
about L. 10 ; the dues for mortcloths, and other small sources 
yield from L. 7 to L, 10 ; the two principal heritors usually send 
donations, of which the average annual amount has for some years 
been about L. 25 ; and, after payment of all expenses falling on 
the funds, there is fully requisite, in order to keep both sides of 
the accounts duly balanced, a sum of about L. 30, being the in- 
terest arising from several legacies and other sums belonging to 
the funds. Of these legacies one was bequeathed in 1646, by 
William Lawson in Powburn, who mortified " 300 merks to the 
kirk of Convay," the principal to remain in the hands of the kirk- 
session of Montrose. In 1825, Mrs Shank, relict of the Rev. 
Alexander Shank, minister of St Cyrus, left L. 100 to the kirk- 
session in aid of the poor ; in 1832, Alexander Crombie, Esq. of 
Phesdo, left L. 19, 19s., for the same purpose ; and in 1833, 

• Tliis was written in 1830', The present present Preses is the Master of Ar- 
buthnott.

James Farquhar, Esq, of Johnston, many years M. P for thp 
Aberdeen district of burghs, left to the kirk-session, in aid of t e 
poor funds, the handsome sum of L. 500. Agreeably to the known 
views of the generous donors, the managers of the funds consider 
that It IS only the interest arising from these sums that they are 
warranted to apply annually in aid of the poor. 

Miscellaneous Observations 

Since the fornaer Statistical Account was written, the popula- 
tion of this parish has increased very considerably, having been at 
that time about 1200, and being now nearly 2000. The whole 
of this increase, and more, has been in the village, -the rural no 
pulation having diminished about 100. It is from this accession 
of inhabitants that the parish now takes its character Its inte 
rests are more closely connected with trade and manufactures, than 
with agriculture; but such improvements as would increase the 
comforts of the tenantry and of their servants, would benefit the 
villagers, by producing a greater circulation of money in the neigh- 
bourhood, and enabling them in turn to pay a better price for their 
food. It is, however, to be foared, that the employment of ma- 
chinery necessary, in the artificial state of this country, to pre- 
serve Its commercial prosperity, must prevent any rise in 'the wages 
ot hand-loom weaving, on which so large a part of the population 
of this parish are dependent. Formerly, little weaving was done 
except by the order of private customers; now there is little done 
in this way. Almost the whole work is sent by the companies in 
Aberdeen, and any depression in the trade is first and most sensibly 
felt in a place such as this, at a distance from the seat of employ- 
ment, and possessing no natural advantages for its prosecution. In 
these circumstances, it would be beneficial if any means could be 
devised for checking the number of young people that annually 
flock to this profession, which, in a great degree, unfits them for 
any other in future lifo, and which, while they are encroaching on 
the profits of others, affords but a scanty pittance for themsetves. 
And it is desirable, that no inducement should be afforded to per- 
sons to come from other quarters for employment here, by which 
work is taken from those who are already settled in the place, and 
have some claim upon it, and an encouragement is given to persons 
who are careless about their character and conduct, and unsettled 
in their habits, and who, leaving undischarged many of the obliga- 
tions of social lifo, migrate, as they list, from place to place.

PRESBYTERY OF F0R10UN, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. JAMES MYLNE, MINISTER. 

1. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — Authentic documents in the possession of the Vis- 
count Arbuthnott afford the most distinct evidence that, previous to 
the twelfth century, the name of that family and of the district was 
Aberbothenothe : that, about 1335, it had become Aberbuthnot ; 
and about 1443, Arbuthnott. Aber denotes the influx of a river 
into the sea, or of a smaller stream into a larger ; Both, Bothena, 
a dwelling, a baronial residence, Scotice " The House Neth, or 
Neoth-ea Jamieson's Scott. Diet. Diss. p. 18, the stream that 
descends or is lower than something else in the neighbourhood : 
whence the name Aberbothenothe may be understood to mean, 
" The confluence of the water below the Baron's house." This 
derivation is perfectly applicable to the site of the ancient castle, 
and the present nouse, the residence of the Arbuthnott family, 
who have been from time immemorial proprietors of the great- 
er part of this parish. The house stands on the narrow point 
of a projecting eminence, overlooking the water of Bervie, as it 
flows through a beautiful valley on the south : close beneath it on 
the east, a rapid rivulet, formerly of considerable size, runs through 
a deep hollow, and joins the Bervie a few hundred yards below. 

Extent and Boundaries. — This parish contains from 14 to 15 
square miles of surface. Its greatest extent from east to west is 
about 5 miles, and from north to south about 4. It is bounded 
on the west, by the water of Bervie, which separates it from the 
parishes of Laurencekirk and Fordoun ; on the north, by the Forthy 
which separates it from Glenbervie ; on the north-east, by Dun- 
nottar; on the east, by Kinneff; on the south, by the parish of 
Bervie, from which it is separated by the water of Bervie for two 
miles and a half; after which it turns to the south-west, on which 
side It is bounded by the parish of Garvock.

KINCARDINESHIRE. 



The highest land in Arbuthnott is Bruxiehill, which has an 
elevation of about 650 feet above the level of the sea. The sur- 
face of the parish is, however, very irregular, and much varied by 
hill and dale. It rises on all sides from the valley of the Bervie, 
which, in its winding course, extensive haughs, and steep wooded 
banks, presents, at many points of view, scenes of great beauty. 
_ MeteoroioT/.— The mean of a series of.observations made from 
time to time, for upwards of a year, on the temperature of four 
springs, which vary little in the quantity of water which they dis- 
charge, is 46° Fahr., which may be considered a very close ap- 
proximation to the mean annual temperature of the atmosphere. 
These springs, which are situated in the lowest part of the parish, 
near the bank of the Bervie, differ extremely little from one an- 
other in temperature. On September 21, 1836, their tempera- 
ture was 50° Fahr. and March 15, 1837, 42° Fahr. These were 
the highest and lowest temperatures observed. During the months 
of April, May, and June 1834, the average height of the baro- 
meter was as follows : 

10 A. M. 6 p. M. 

April, - 30 . 29.88 

May, - 30.46 30.07 

June, - 29.94 29.84 

The prevailing winds are the N. E. and S. E. but the severest 
is the S. W. 

Hydrography. — The average temperature of springs, as already 
mentioned, is 46° Fahr. They generally arise from gravel banks. 
A few chalybeate springs occur. The principal stream is the water 
of Bervie. In summer, when it is very small, its velocity is only 
about a mile ; but, in time of flood, it increases to four miles an 
hour. From the extent to which draining has been carried, it rises 
and falls very rapidly after rain, and embankments have in conse- 
quence become necessary for a great part of its course. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The rocks are chiefly coarse sand- 
stone, trap, and what is here called scurdy. Detached masses of 
gneiss and granite are occasionally met with. At a point on the 
north bank of the Bervie, a little below Arbuthnott House, beau- 
tifully variegated pebbles have been found imbedded in trap. 
The Viscountess Arbuthnott has a very fine collection of these, 
which have been cut and formed into a necklace. Calcareous 
spar is not uncommon, and heavy spar is found. On the south side 



 There is one small quarry of porphyry.

of the Bervie, and nearly opposite the church of Arbuthnott, small 
veins of manganese occur in a deep ravine called " The Hares' 
Den." 

Remains of Animals. — In the deepest part of a small peat-bog 
called the Hogs' Hole, lying between the estate of Kair and the farm 
of Old-cake, the skeletons of two red deer were found a few years 
ago, in cutting a deep ditch through it. The horns are of extra- 
ordinary size, and are now in the vestibule of Arbuthnott House. 
The extreme breadth between the horns of the one is 4 feet ; the 
length of horn 3 feet 11 inches. The left horn has 8 antlers, the 
longest of which measures 18 inches ; and the right 7 antlers, the 
longest of which measures 16 inches. The extreme breadth be- 
tween the horns of the other is 3 feet 11 in. : the length of horn 
3 feet 6 mches. There are 7 antlers on each horn, the longest of 
which measures 15 inches. 

Botany. — Keeping in view that the parish contains no elevation 
much above 600 feet, and does not reach the sea, great variety 
in the botanical features of the parish cannot be expected. Epi- 
lobium angustifolium, Agrimonia eupatoria, the tiny meadow pink 
Dianthus deltoides, Saxifraga granulata, Geranium lucidum, 
sglvaticvm, pratense, and pyrenaicum the last introduced from 
Sahsbury crags, ornament the bank of our little river. A few 
plants of the elegant Vicia sylvatica, and melancholy thistle de- 
scend from the more upland districts. The hand of agriculture 
has almost extirpated the plants of the marshes, Trollius Europceus 
lucken go wan, bur-marygold, and Anagallis tenella. In the 
warmest exposures the beautiful scarlet pimpernel {Anagallis ar- 
vensis, and Valeriana locusta, are not uncommon. In the moist, 
deep, cool shades of our wooded dells are found the musky Adoxa 
moschatellina, Festuca gigantea, and Paris quadrifolia, a singular 
plant, remarkable as the only representative on the old continent 
of an American genus  Trillium of considerable beauty. Juncus 
glaucus, supposed by Dr Hooker to be confined to the west of 
Scotland, abounds in several of the vales, with a few plants of 
common adder's tongue {Ophioglossum vulgatum. Even Hor- 
deum murinum, supposed never to. venture across the Forth, is 
found on the coast side, only two miles from the parish of Arbu'th- 
nott. When Arbuius uvaursi is added as a native of the drier 
moors, the more striking features of our little Flora will be com- 
pleted. A grass, however, here called sleepies Bromus secalinus 
requires to be particularly noticed ; us it is one of the very few of

that tribe, possessing a deleterious property. When eaten, it Ims 
been found to act as an emetic and cathartic, to a dangerous degree. 
It is very common here among the winter wheats, and can scarce- 
ly be separated from the grain, as the seeds of it are large and 
heavy. In this district, a bitter infusion of the stalks of the barber- 
ry is used with success in jaundice. Beech, ash, elm, and plane, 
attain a large size. In front of Arbuthnott House, there is a fine 
avenue of beeches, supposed to be upwards of two hundred years 
old. At the bottom of the garden, on the east side, on a space of 
scarcely 1000 square feet, beeches of the following size are at pre- 
sent growing, and in full vigour.

The height of these trees is about 70 feet. Two fine old yews, 
a male and a female, are in the manse garden. Their girth, taken 
one foot above the ground, is, of the one 7 feet 1 inch, and of the 
other 8 feet. They are from 35 to 40 feet high. 

II. — Civil History. 
Eminent Men. — Alexander Arbuthnott, the first Protestant 
Principal of King's College and University, Aberdeen, was a na- 
tive of this parish, and for some time its clergyman. He was the 
second son of Andrew Arbuthnott of Pitcarles, and Elizabeth 
Strathauchin, daughter of James Strathauchin, or Strachan of 
Monboddo, and sister of Alexander Strathauchin of Thornton. 
Andrew Arbuthnott was fourth son of Sir Robert Arbuthnott of 
Arbuthnott ; so that the Principal was a grandson, not a brother 
of the Baron of Arbuthnott, as Sir George Mackenzie and Spots- 
wood affirm. After he had completed the regular course of study 
at the University of St Andrews, he was sent to France in his 
twenty-third year, where he applied to the study of civil law for 
five years under the famous Cujacius, at the University of Bourges. 



ARBUTHNOTT. 



157 



Having taken the degree of licentiate, he returned to Scotland in 
1566, with the intention of following his profession in his native 
country ; but, finding the principles of the Reformation prevalent, 
he became a zealous supporter of them ; and having given up the 
study of law for that of theology, he was appointed minister of 
Arbuthnott in 1567 His abilities soon brought him into notice; 
and in 1568, being a member of the General Assembly, he was 
appointed by his brethren to examine a work, entitled, " The Fall 
of the Roman Church," which had been objected to, because in 
it the King was styled " The Head of the Church." The result 
of his examination was, an order to Bassandyne, the printer, to call 
in all the copies that had been issued, and to sell no more until he 
had not only expunged the objectionable passage from that work, 
but also removed a profane song which he had printed at the end 
of an edition of the book of Psalms ; and that for the future he 
should not print any hook whatever without the hcense of the su- 
preme magistrate, nor any book connected with religion, until it had 
been revised by the Assembly's commission. In 1569 he was ap- 
pointed Principal of the University of Aberdeen, in place of Mr 
Alexander Anderson, who, with the sub-principal and three regents, 
had been ejected by John Erskine of Dun superintendent of 
Angus and Mearns for their adherence to Popery, and refusal to 
subscribe the Confession of Faith. In 1572 he was a member of 
the General Assembly held at St Andrews, in which the scheme 
of the Regent Morton and his party to restore the old titles of the 
church, and retain the temporalities among themselves by means 
of titular incumbents, was strenuously opposed. In the Assem- 
blies held at Edinburgh in 1573, 1577, 1578, Principal Arbuth- 
nott was moderator ; and he appears to have been constantly em- 
ployed on the part of the church, in the commission for conferring 
with the regency respecting the form of church government to be 
adopted in Scotland. The leading part which he took in this 
matter gave umbrage to James VL, and the offence was increas- 
ed in 1582 by his superintending the publication of Buchanan's 
History of Scotland. In the course of that same year. Principal 
Arbuthnott was ordered, by an act of Assembly, to be removed 
from Aberdeen to St Andrews ; but the King, suspecting the ob-

pure and palmy days of the church, pluralities were not unknown.

ject of this removal to be, that the Assembly might more easily 
enjoy the benefit of his advice, and with that view might transfer 
their sittings to St Andrews, a royal mandate was issued, forbid- 
ding him to absent himself from his college at Aberdeen. The 
General Assembly, which met in 1583, remonstrated against this 
oppressive act of arbitrary power ; but the King remained inflexible. 
Principal Arbuthnott died soon after, 16th October, in the forty- 
fifth year of his age : " omnibus desideratus, nemini invisus," says 
a manuscript account of him in the library at Arbuthnott House. 
He was buried in the chapel of King's College, on the 20th Oc- 
tober 1583. His character is given in highly favourable terms by 
Archbishop Spotswood in his History of Scotland ; and elegant 
epigrams in honour of him by Andrew Melvin and Thomas Mait- 
land, are to be found in the Delicise Poetarum Scotorum. In 
1572 he published at Edinburgh, in 4to, an elegant and learned 
work, intituled, " Orationes de Origine et Dignitate Juris ;" and 
he left in manuscript an account of the Arbuthnott family, inti- 
tuled, " Originis et incrementi Arbuthnoticse familiae descriptio 
historica," which is still preserved. It was afterwards translated 
by George Morrison, minister of Benholme, and continued by 
Alexander Arbuthnott, minister of Arbuthnott, to the period of 
the Restoration. 

John Arbuthnott, M. D. one of the wits of the reign of Queen 
Anne, and the most learned of the whole, was born in this parish 
April 1667 : He was the oldest son of the last mentioned Alexan- 
der Arbuthnott, who was nearly related to the noble family of 
that name, and Margaret Lamy, from the parish of Mary ton. 
In 1690, his father, being obliged to resign his charge in conse- 
quence of his refusal to comply with the Presbyterian system, which 
was restored at the Revolution in 1688, retired to the Castle of 
Hallgreen, near Bervie, in the neighbourhood of which he posses- 
sed by inheritance the small estate of Kinghornie. His sons de- 
termining to seek their fortune abroad, John went to London, 
where he employed himself for some time as a teacher of mathe- 
matics. His subsequent career will be found in Kippis's Biog. 
Brit, and the common biographies of learned men. 

Sibbalds of Kair. — In the latter part of the fifteenth century, 
James Sybbalde, chaplain of the Church of St Ternan of Arbuth- 
nott, was eminent as a calligraphist. Some splendid specimens of his 
art still remain. 

In the Statisticar Account of 1796 it is mentioned that Dr 



ARDUTIINOTT. 



159 



David Sibbald, having been preceptor to the Duke of Gloucester, 
son of Charles 1., was imprisoned in London for his attachment 
to the royal cause, and had his estate forfeited. He lived, how- 
ever, to see the restoration, and died in his own house of Kair in 
1661. 

James Sibbald, D. D. Minister of Aberdeen, appears to have 
been the son of this Dr David Sibbald, and the only daughter of 
John Arbuthnott of Mondynes. On the death of Charles I. he 
laid down his charge, and fled to Dublin, where, being elected pas- 
tor of a congregation, he ended his days in the office of the minis- 
try. His brother, John Sibbald, minister of Arbuthnott, and pre- 
decessor of Alexander Arbuthnott, was noted " for his pious and 
religious life, his great painfulness in his calling, his learning and 
charitable work ; for he was instrumental, and contributed liberal- 
ly for building an edifice for training of youth, and mortified con- 
siderable sums of money for maintenance of a schoolmaster and 
the poor of the parish ; and also bequeathed his books to the Aisle 
of Arbuthnott, worth more than a thousand merks, for the use of 
his successors, incumbents in that place." Of these books not a 
fragment now remains. They appear to have been all carried off 
upwards of fifty years ago. 

Land-owners. — The land-owners are. Viscount Arbuthnott; Vis- 
countess Keith ; Robert Barclay Allardyce, Esq. of Ury and Al- 
lardyce ; John Gordon, Esq. W. S. Edinburgh; and George Far- 
quhar Kinloch, Esq. of Kair. 

Parochial Registers. — The oldest date of these is ,1630; from 
which period they are complete. 

Antiquities — The most ancient buildings in the parish are, the 
House of Allardyce, which was for a long period the residence 
of the ancient family of Allardyce, now represented by Robert 
Barclay Allardyce, Esq. of Ury, but it is now a ruin : the parish 
church ; and an aisle attached to it on the south-east, in which 
is the burying-ground of the Arbuthnott family. 

This aisle was rebuilt by Sir Robert Arbuthnott of that Ilk, in 
1505, of finely hewn ashlar. The entrance is on the west s'ide 
by an arched door. On the south side are four buttresses of 
carved stone work ; but the ravages of the weather have greatly 
mjured the beauty of the workmanship, particularly on the south, 
est part of the building. The lower part, which is arched was 
ongmally dedicated as a chapel to the Virgin Mary : and the up- 
per, which is accessible by a narrow winding stair in a round tower 



160 



KINCARDINESHIRE, 



on the north-west corner, was intended to be a sleeping chamber 
for the priest who officiated at her altar. Sir Robert also assigned 
for his use, a house, garden, and croft of land, near the church of St 
Ternan of Arbuthnott, along with an annual stipend of 14 merks. 

In the lower part of the aisle, in the burying ground, there is 
an ancient full-length stone statue of Hugh de Arbuthnott who 
is distinguished in the old charters, from two predecessors of the 
same name, by the surname of Blundus, or Le Blond, in arecHn- 
ing posture, with the face looking upwards, and the feet resting on 
the figure of a dog. His own and his lady's arms, which are the 
same with those of the once powerful family of the Morevilles, Co'n- 
stables of Scotland, are cut on the stone on which the statue lies. 
Hugh Le Blond died before the end of the twelfth century. 

Ancient Manuscripts. — The psalter and office used in the 
chapel of the Virgin Mary, and the missal used in the Church of 
St Ternan, are in the library of Arbuthnott House, in excellent 
preservation. The penmanship in all of them is remarkably beau- 
tiful and regular; and, in the Virgin's Service- Book, and the 
Missal, the margins and the initial letters are in many places 
splendidly illuminated. 

The psalter, written by James Sybbalde, chaplain of St Ter- 
nan, at the desire of Sir Robert Arbuthnott, was finished 4th March 
1482, and presented in 1506 to the chapel of the Virgin by the 
same Sir Robert, its founder. 

The office of the Virgin, which, like the psalter, is a 4to, and 
by the same pen, contains the following illuminated drawings. 

J. St Ternan in his robes. 2. The salutation by the Angel. 
3. The Virgin and her child. 4. The rich man and Lazarus in 
Hades. 5. The Crucifixion. 6. The Sacrament of the Supper. 
At the end there is an obituary of the Arbuthnotts from 1314 to 
1507 ; followed by a notice of the death of James Sybbalde, 
" vicarius de Arbuthnott, scriba publicus correctissimus, testanti- 
bus missalibus hujus ecclesise sancti Terrenani, multisque aliis 
voluminibus per eum scriptis." He died 11th September 1507. 

The Missal, which was also written by him, is a folio of the 
largest size, and likewise contains a drawing of St Ternan. It is 
in its original oaken hoards, covered with leather, and fastened with 
a brass clasp. 

On the farm of Laes, earthen vases, of coarse materials, and 
rude workmanship, have been dug up occasionally from some gravel 
hillocks ; and a few years ago, when a small cairn was removed

. from the farm of Craighill, a similar one was found, containing 
ashes ; but it was broken accidentally by the blow of a pick -axe. 
Near the Hogs-hole, from which the large deer horns, already 
noticed, were dug up, a stone hatchet, and the metal head of a 
battle-axe, were found. The head of a smaller battle-axe was 
thrown up about two years ago, in digging a drain on the farm of 
Townhead. It appears to be composed of a mixture of copper and 
tin, and weighs 8j oz Avoirdupois. 

Proprietors' Residences. — Arbuthnott House. The lawn and the 
approach have been greatly improved and beautified by the pre- 
sent Viscount. The new approach is connected with the mansion 
by a stone bridge of the finest architecture, thrown across the 
deep hollow on the east side of the house in 1821. The house 
of Kair is quite a. modern mansion, of considerable beauty. 

HI. — Population.

lation does not appear to have been at any time very different in 
point of number from what it is at present.

Bent— The average rent of arable land is about 18s. per acre 
Mate of Labour. — Male servants for farm work, ploughmen, earn 
from L. 11 to L. 13 ; male servants for all work, L. 7 to L 8- 
female servants for farm work from L. 5 to L.6; female ser- 
vants for house work from L. 4 to L. 5, 10s. per annum. Country 
artisans earn about 2s. per day on an average of the vear. 

Live-Siock.— Few sheep are reared. The kinds are English 
and black-faced. The breed of cattle is generally the Galloway. 
There are a few Ayrshire cows. 

State of Husbandry.-Ancultme is carried on with great spirit. 
The five-shift or seven-shift rotation is employed according to the 
nature of the soil but the seven-shift appears to be now gene- 
rally acknowledged to be the best. The use of bone-dust on the 
lighter soils, as manure for turnips, to be eaten off with sheep, has 
been introduced with great advantage. Much barren land has 
been brought under cultivation by Viscount Arbuthnott ; and a 
very considerable extent by the tenants on their several farms. Irri- 
gation IS unnecessary, and is unknown. Draining has been car- 
ried to a great extent, and has added at once to the productive- 
ness of the soil, and the salubrity of the climate. From the rapi- 
dity with which the surface water is in consequence poured into 
the Bervie, embankments are now become indispensable along 
great part of its course, to prevent it from carrying away great 
portions of the haughs, or rendering them useless by the deposi- 
tion of sand and gravel. 

Leases.— The general duration of leases is nineteen years. Few 
of these are held in writing. The farm buildings are in general ex- 
cellent; but from the difficulty and expense of procuring materials, 
scarcely half the land is properly enclosed with stone dikes. Pal- 
ing is used as a temporary fence, but is considered an expensive

Rental. — The real rental of the parish is about L. 6200 a- 
vear. 

Plmitations. — Most of the plantations in the parish belong to 
Viscount Arbuthnott J- but as they have been formed chiefly by the 
present proprietor, they are immature. The finest old wood is 
that around the House of Arbuthnott ; and it is seldom profaned 
by the axe. There is some fine old wood at Allardyce, though 
of small extent ; and some thriving plantations around Kair. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town, Post-Office, Sfc. — The nearest post-office is in the 
burgh of Berviey which is the nearest market-town ; and is about 
2 miles distant from the church of Arbuthnott. The great road 
leading through Stonehaven and Laurencekirk passes through 
the northern part of the parish for two miles and a half. An 
excellent road has been lately made through the lower part of the 
parish, extending from the bridge of Bervie, which forms its 
eastern extremity, to the bridge of Whiteriggs, which is the western ; 
a distance of five miles. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is situated a little way from 
the north bank of the Bervie. It is about three miles distant from 
the farthest extremity of the parish. The date of its erection is 
not known. In 1305 Sir Robert Arbuthnott repaired and im- 
proved the west gable, erecting on it a round tower, to which he 
presented two bells. The joining of the earlier and later work- 
manship is still apparent in the building : so that the church is 
not less than 333 years old, and is probably upwards of 400. It 
is at present in a pretty good state of repair, and affords accom- 
modation for 440 persons, allowing 16 inches for each sitting, 
exclusive of seats for the kirk-session. The seats are all free. 

The manse was built at different periods, and is now greatly in 
need of repair. The glebe is small, and of little value. The 
stipend consists of the following items : 12 bolls of wheat ; 108 
bolls, 1 firlot, 2 pecks, 2 lippies of meal : 48 bolls, 3 firlots of 
bear ; and L. 8.5, 12s. lOd. of money. The teinds are exhausted 
There is no chapel of ease. Government church, missionary, dis- 
senting chapel, or meeting-house in the parish. The average 
number of communicants at the Established Church is 450. Divine 
service is well and decently attended. The schoolmaster cate- 
chises the young in his school twice a-week : and the minister 
attends to the religious instruction of the older members of his 
congregation. There are four families of Episcopalians, and four 



'" KINCAIIDINESHIRE. 

of Dissenters in the parish : but of these some members attend the 
parish church, and others the chapel, or the meeting-house. 

Education. — There is one parochial school, the master of which 
has the maximum salary, the legal accommodation, and the school 
fees, which may amount to L. 8 per annum. There are also four 
unendowed schools. A few persons in the parish cannot write : 
but all can read more or less perfectly. No additional schools 
are required. 

Savings Bank. — A savings bank was established in June 1822, 
in which the deposits have been gradually increasing. The an- 
nual deposits amount to about L. 50 ; and the sums annually with- 
drawn to about L. 20. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of persons receiving 
regular parochial aid is 13, and the average sum allotted to each 
is L. 2, lis. 6d per annum. The present expenditure is much 
greater than usual, as the poor's fund has three fatuous persons 
to support, at an expense of L. 20, 16s. 8d. per annum. The 
yearly amount of collections for the poor is L.28; the annual in- 
terest of mortifications, L. 4, 12s. ; interest of money, L. 3, 7s. 6d. ; 
which, with occasional donations from heritors and other private 
Individuals, may amount to L. 39, 4s. 6d. per annum. 

Kinloch's Fund. — In 1812, the sum of L. 2700 was bequeath- 
ed by William Kinloch, Esq. of Calcutta, to be lodged in the 
funds, and the annual interest to be divided quarterly among the 
native poor of the parish of Arbuthnott, at the discretion of the 
kirk-session, who are empowered, by the deed of bequest, to receive 
the claims of the several applicants, and aid them as they shall see 
cause. The number of claimants at present on the roll is 77, o{ 
whom 25 are parochial, but do not receive aid from the proper 
parish fund for the maintenance of the poor ; and 52 are ex-pa- 
rochial. As the annual interest of the money in the funds is L. 120, 
the average amount of aid to every applicant is L. 1, lis. 2d. per 
annum. 

Inns. — There are 5 inns or alehouses ; and that number might 
be reduced with benefit to the morals of the people. 

Fuel. — The fuel used is chiefly coal, which is commonly sold at 
Is. Id., or Is. 2d. per barrel at Gourdon, in the parish of Bervie, 
which is the nearest sea-port. Turf is used in part by the lower 
classes.

PRESBYTERY OF FORDOUN, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. JAMES DRUMMOND, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Boundaries, c. — The parish of Glenbervie, anciently Over- 
bervie, is situated nearly in the centre of the Mearns, — bounded 
on the west, by the water of Bervie and Fordoun ; on the east, by 
Dunnottar and Fetteresso ; on the south and south-east, by Ar- 
buthnott ; and on the north, by the hills of Strachan and Durris. 
It reaches 6 miles from north to south, and 5 from east to west. 

Topographical Appearances. — It may be divided into three dis- 
tricts. That which lies along the water of Bervie is separated 
from the middle district by a sort of ravine, and consists of kindly 
productive early soil, is diversified by sloping banks and swelling 
grounds, and though but ill clothed with wood, and almost desti- 
tute of hedge or hedge-row, shelter or screen, is not unpleasing to 
the view. 

That part of this district which joins Arbuthnott on the south- 
east is bounded by a sand-bank, provincially called the Karnes, 
rising abruptly from the level on both sides, as if it had been cast 
up by human art,— though from the regular strata it contains, it has 
obviously been the effect of some water-course ; yet the similar 
acclivity of each side might incline one to suppose that some con- 
vulsion had aided in throwing up the girdling mound. 

Soil. — The middle district contains two very different qualities 
of soil. Its western division is considerably elevated, bleak in ap- 
pearance, little cultivated, almost neglected. Its eastern division, 
though also high and exposed, is fertile, fast improving, and a great 
part under good husbandry. 

The northern district, which lies along a low ridge of the Gram- 
pians, is generally under the plough. The soil is colder and more 
tenacious than that of the south, while its lateness and want of en- 
closures give it an unfavourable appearance. 

There is still a small district included in the parish, which lies 
farther north, on the water of Cowie. It is separated from the 



166 



KTNCAKDINESHIRE. 



last mentioned by a narrow range of the Grampians. Of this the 
arable part is dry, early soil, but of small extent. The rest is mere- 
ly a sheep-walk, heath-clad, skirted with copse-wood, and a seclud- 
ed glen. 

Climate. — The climate is very cold in winter, not so much from 
elevation above the level of the sea, as from proximity to the hills 
m the back ground, which are, soon after autumn, capped with snow, 
and, excepting short intervals of softer temperature, remain so till 
towards spring. However, from the inland situation of the parish, 
the heights between intercepting the sea-breeze, the heat of sum- 
mer is considerably greater than on the coast, or even on the flats of 
the shore ; hence the crops of those districts, where the soil is not 
naturally wet and cold, come to maturity fully as soon as those 
which no frosts have benumbed in their seed-bed, nor blasts from 
the mountain checked in their spring. 

Hydrography. — The Water of Bervie takes its rise in the hills 
to the north-west of this parish, and after a bending course of 
about three miles, leaves it at a point south-south-east from the 
source. It runs on a gravelly channel, is rapid in its descent, and 
has few tributary streams to swell it in its course. The water of 
Cowie rises in the hills on the north side of the parish, and holds 
on its current to the east, where it enters the parish of Fetteresso, 
a gathering mountain stream. The water of Carron flows from the 
hills of the brae of Glenbervie, passing eastward to the valley di- 
viding Fetteresso from Dunnottar, — a water too diminutive to merit 
that classic name. 

II. — Civil History. 
Land-owners. — The principal heritors are, James Mitchell Ni- 
colson, Esq. of Glenbervie; and John Gordon, Esq. of Drumli- 
thie. The rental of the parish is L. 4300 Sterling. The valued 
rent is L. 3336 Scots. 

III. — Population.' 
The population of this parish has varied little in amount for the 
last fifty years. Nor is this to be wondered at, for as the chief 
occupation of the inhabitants is husbandry, and that, as supposed, 
requires but a limited number of hands, the rest must emigrate 
yearly to other districts. In 1755, the number of inhabitants 
was 958; in 1796, it amounted to 1307 ; in 1821, it was 1227; 
and now in 1831,. it is 1248. Of these, 350 reside in the village 
of Drumlithie. 

The average number of marriages for the last seven years is 



GLENBERVIE. 



167 



13; the average number of births about 34. Illegitimate births 
within the last three years, 14. There are 18 men upwai'ds of 
50 years of age unmarried, and 76 unmarried women upwards 
of 45. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The number of imperial acres cultivated is 5000 ; 
hill, moor, and waste 8000; planted 185 ; and there are many acres 
in a wild state, but capable of cultivation. A considerable pro- 
portion of these may probably continue as they are, for a longer 
period than the progress of improvement elsewhere would lead us to 
infer. 

Husbandry/. — The system of husbandry adopted here, with few 
exceptions, is what is called the six-course shift, viz. 1. oats ; 2. 
oats ; 3. turnips and potatoes ; 4, bear or barley, with sown out 
grasses ; 5. hay ; 6. two years old grass in pasture. On some 
farms, a second year's crop of barley is taken, after preparing the 
ground with a half dunging, but this deviation seems more a mea- 
sure of expediency, than a plan of preference in the range of the 
course. 

Wages. — Ploughmen's wages L. 12 a year with victuals ; labour- 
er's do. from L. 8 to L. 14 with victuals; mason's do. 15s. a week 
in summer without victuals, do. in winter 12s. ; wright's do. 12s. 
a week in summer without victuals ; do. in winter 10s. 

Produce. — The average quantity of oats, bear, and barley raised 
in the parish is 6800 quarters ; 670 acres are under green crop ; 
less under hay. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town — Means of Communication. — The nearest market- 
town is Stonehaven, about six or seven miles distant, to which there 
are excellent roads. The only village in the parish is Drumlithie, 
inhabited chiefly by weavers. Other handicrafts are not more nu- 
merous than the wants of the place require. There are two stage- 
coaches which pass every lawful day from Edinburgh to Aberdeen, 
also a regular daily post throughout the week, Wednesdays ex- 
cepted. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church, built twelve years ago to 
contain 700 sitters, is very neat and substantial, conveniently situ- 
ated for the generality of the population. A considerable propor- 
tion of the seats is left free, so that the poorest have it in their 
power to be accommodated. The manse was built about forty 
years ago, and has been repaired and enlarged. The extent of the 



168 



KINCARDINESHIRE. 



glebe, including garden and pasture, is nearly six acres Scots. The 
stipend, with communion allowance, is L. 170, and 76 bolls 3 fir- 
lots meal and bear. 

There is an Episcopalian chapel in the village of Drumlithie. 
The number of adherents of all ages belonging to this parish is 
70. With the exception of two Seceders, the rest are of the Es- 
tablished Church. The number of communicants averages 680. 
The amount of collections throughout the year for the support of 
the poor is L. 42. There is a collection once a year in aid of the 
Infirmary of Aberdeen, which usually amounts to L, 7. Except- 
ing this, there is seldom a collection made but for the poor of the 
parish. 

Education. — Besides the parochial school there are three private 
schools. The branches taught are, English, Latin, writing, arith- 
metic, elements of mathematics, &amp;c. Two of the private teachers, 
in addition to their fees, have a salary each of L. 5 allowed by the 
respective heritors, on whose lands the schools are built. The 
parochial schoolmaster has a salary of L. 30, and L. 2, 2s. in lieu 
of garden ground. His accommodation is now ample. The school- 
fees vary from 2s, to 5s. quarterly, according to the branches re- 
quired, and may amount to L. 15 per annum. There is perhaps 
not an individual in the parish above the age of ten who cannot 
read ; and the rising generation are in the course of being taught 
to write. 

Friendly Societies. — There are two Friendly Societies in the pa- 
rish, but their advantages are not much to be reckoned. They are 
about to be dissolved. 

Savings Bank. — There is a Savings bank ; but since the rate 
of interest was reduced, it has made little progress. It is, how- 
ever, an obvious benefit to servants, who are principally the depo- 
sitors. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of poor receiving pa- 
rochial aid is 40. The funds for their relief are derived from the 
stated Sunday collections, from the interest of L. 200, from casual 
donations, from moi'tcloth-dues, &amp;c. Of the poor some receive but 
a few shillings yearly, and others from L. 1 to L. 2, 10s. ; some, 
a moiety in aid of their house rent ; and all, a pittance in name of 
coal money, the proceeds of an extra collection in the beginning 
of the year. 

Fairs. — There is one annual fair held in October for the sale 
of cattle. 



OLENUERVIE. 



169 



Alehouses. — There are five public-houses and one spirit-shop in 
the parish, all on a very small scale. 

Fuel. — The fuel of the lower district consists chiefly of English 
coals imported to Stonehaven. Those in the upper district use 
peats got from the hills in their vicinity. The expense of a barrel 
of coals at the sea-port is Is. 3d., nine of which make a cart load. 
The carriage of the load is from 3s. to 3s. 6d., according to dis- 
tance. The expense of a cart-load of peats, casting and drying, is 
Is. 3d. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

The condition of the inhabitants does not differ in general from 
that of those in the neighbouring parishes. The farmer, though far 
from opulent, enjoys a moderate share of the comforts of life, and the 
servant has a fair allowance for the wages of his toil. Both these 
classes have progressed much within the last forty years. Not so, 
however, the manufacturing population. These have not risen in 
the scale within the same period. They are dependent, almost to 
helplessness, on the great manufacturers. In other days, the wea- 
ver was the owner of the web he wove ; and it was his custom to 
carry it to market, whence he brought back its value, to purchase 
more materials for farther operations, gratified with the reflection, 
that he had something at stake in the interests of the community, 
and that his condition was far above that of the mere hireling. 

In other respects, since the period of the last Statistical Account, 
the circumstances of the parish have improved astonishingly. The 
rental has increased more than fourfold, not from the comparative- 
ly higher prices of the productions, but from the greater produc- 
tiveness of the soil. The cultivation of the soil is better under- 
stood, the rotation of cropping more judiciously followed, and the 
business of the farm more actively pursued. At that time, there 
was not one thrashing-machine in the parish ; there are now six- 
teen. There were then about fifty awkward ploughs ; there are 
now above seventy scientifically constructed, and of the most effec- 
tive description ; and every other implement of husbandry evinces 
a knowledge far advanced in the arts of life. Much, however, yet 
remains to be done in the improvement of waste lands ; and it is 
to be hoped, that, in this respect, something will be done ere long.

PllESBYTERy OF ABERDEEN, SYNOD OE ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. ROBERT COPLAND, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The ancient name of the parish, according to the ge- 
nerally received accounts, was Duires ; it is now written Durris, 
and sometimes pronounced Dores. The ancient name signifies, 
in Gaelic, a mouth or entrance, probably from the parish being a 
principal entrance into the Highlands. 

Extent, Src. — The parish extends from east to west about 5| 
miles along the south bank of the river Dee, which is its northern 
boundary. On the south, it is bounded by the Grampian moun- 
tains. 

Topographical Appearances, 8c. — Its figure resembles an oblong ; 
but the length on the south side is at least seven miles; the mean 
breadth about three and three-fourth miles. The appearance of 
the surface is very irregular. On the river side, there are conside- 
rable fields of haugh land, quite level ; some of it being very produc- 
tive, and some light and sandy. Several acclivities or small hills 
then intervene and intercept the prospect, so that the half of the 
parish is not visible from any one point in it. The highest hill in 
the parish is Cairnmonearn, one of the Grampians, elevated about 
1200 feet above the level of the sea ; but several others, as Min- 
dernal, Mountgower, and Craigbeg, are nearly of the same height. 

The temperature of the atmosphere is exceedingly various ; the 
cold, in some seasons, being much more intense than in others ; 
and the heat in summer, especially on the river side, very great, 
arising in some degree from the gravelly nature of the soil. 

Hydrography. — There are several small rivulets in the parish, 
but none deserving notice except the Shiach Burn, which often 
sends down a great body of water from the Grampians, and after 
a course of the greatest rapidity for about twelve miles, falls into 
the Dee at the church of Durris. A number of chalybeate fprings 
are found in different parts of the parish, of various degrees of 



DURIUS. 



171 



strength ; and near the top of one of the hills, there is a medici~ 
nal spring called Red-Beard's Well, from an old tradition, that a 
certain freebooter called Red-Beard, lived in a cave near this well, 
in the times of black mail. This water has never been analyzed ; 
but it is said to contain neutral salts, and in many of its proper- 
ties to resemble the Harrowgate water. It is difficult to obtain 
the water in a pure state, the spring being surrounded with reeds 
and decayed vegetable matter, and rills of water often falling in- 
to it. 

MineralogT/. — Throughout the whole extent of the parish, there 
are immense masses of stone gneiss ; but Cairnmonearn and 
some of the other hills afford the finest granite and whinstone. 
The quantity of both appears to be inexhaustible. From the 
sides of these hills the naked rocks often show themselves ; but 
they are generally covered with two or three feet of moss and 
heath ; and in the hollows at the foot of the hills, the depth of moss 
is very considerable, affording peats and fuel of the best descrip- 
tion. The soil in the lower ground is, in general, a loam, very 
fertile with good management ; but clay and gravelly soils are like- 
wise found. In most of the varieties of soil under cultivation, the 
enormous masses of stone gneiss would attract the notice of a 
stranger ; and would deter an agriculturist from settling here, who 
had been accustomed to the smooth fields of the southern counties. 
But custom has brought both men and horses to plough round 
these rocks, with the greatest ease ; and it is generally observed, 
that the soil is superior where these rocks abound most. There 
are here several large plantations of Scotch fir and larch in a 
thriving state, where the subsoil is not retentive of water; and 
hard-wood, such as beech, ash, and elm, grow well where the soil 
is congenial. 

II. — Civil History. 
The estate of Durris comprehends this whole parish, and a con- 
siderable part of the adjoining parish of Banchory Ternan. This 
large property has passed from several owners, in the course of a 
few years. It formerly belonged to Lord Peterborough ; afterwards 
the whole estate was held in lease from him, by the late John Innes 
Esq. of Leuchars, near Elgin. On the reduction of this lease by the 
Supreme Court, the estate came into'possession of the late Duke of 
Gordon in 1824, as next heir of entail; and under authority of 
an act of Parliament, transferring the entail to other lands, the 
estate was purchased from the Duke of Gordon last year, by An-

KINCARDINESHIRE. 



thony Mactier, Esq., late of Calcutta. The proprietor is patron 
of the parish church. 

Parochial Registers, — The parochial register of baptisms be- 
gins at the year 1717, as does also the register of discipline : and 
for upwards of forty years, the registers of baptisms, marriages, 
and deaths appear to have been accurately kept. There is also a 
separate register kept for the annual distribution of a mortification 
to certain poor and to other purposes, left by a native of this pa- 
rish of the name of Hog, in the year 1787, under the management 
of the kirk-session, which will be noticed more particularly under 
another head. 

Antiquities. — The parish cannot boast of many antiquities of 
great interest. There are, however, several tumuli or cairns of 
stones, now partly overgrown with heath and whins. About six 
years ago, a fariTier, in trenching out the foundations of some old 
houses and dikes on his farm, found a number of small copper and 
silver coins, but none of them in a state of good preservation. 
From their appearance they were supposed to be Danish. 

It may here be mentioned, that after the great flood in 1829, 
the writer of this account, in taking away a large round cairn of 
stones for the purpose of preventing the encroachments of the 
River Dee, found, when the stones were removed, that they had 
merely covered a hillock of earth of exactly the same shape, and 
evidently artificial. His curiosity was excited to know the con- 
tents of this hillock ; and on breaking it up, some bones, partly 
burnt, were found, and a number of sharp flint stones of different 
sizes. The hillock has very lately been more particularly examin- 
ed ; and at the depth of three feet under the surface of the ad- 
joining field, a large trench or grave, upwards of seven feet long, 
built with stones on the sides, and covered above with three very 
large stones, was discovered. It contained" human bones mixed 
with charcoal ; and it was observed, that part of a skull, contrary 
to the usual mode of interment, was placed at the east end of the 
grave. 

Immediately overhanging a pretty steep bank of the River Dee, 
and about a quarter of a mile below the church, is a small hill, 
called the Castle Hill. It has a ditch at the bottom, and is com- 
monly supposed to have been a place of strength, or military posi- 
tion. A small rill of water runs close past its base, which could 
easily have been made to fill the ditch. And on the top, which is 
quite level, several small hollows or cuts are yet to be seen, which

tradition reports were the places from which the artillery was fired. 
Perhaps the hill may have been converted into this purpose, from 
being originally a dun or law, that is, a place for administering 
justice in ancient times ; many others of a similar description being 
found in different parts of the country. Several Druidical temples 
are also to be met with in the parish, but none in a perfect state. 

Modern Buildmgs. — The only modern building deserving of 
notice, is the mansion-house of Durris, built by John Innes, Esq. 
lessee of the whole estate. This building is connected with the 
ancient mansion-house by an extensive colonnade ; and both have 
now undergone extensive repairs and additions by the present pro- 
prietor. There is no place of worship in the parish except the 
parish church, built in 1822. The parish formerly was a chapelry 
belonging to the Knights Templars, or some other very ancient 
Popish order. The date on a part of the old church still remain- 



ing, is 1537.

From the benevolence and liberality of the late Duke of Gor- 
don, under whose leases the whole parish is at present occupied, 
the people are able to enjoy, in a moderate degree, the comforts 
and advantages of society ; and are, in general, contented with 
their situation. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — The number of imperial acres under tillage is 
nearly 4000 ; 1000 and upwards are in plantations, and perhaps 
10,000 in pasture, mosses, moors, and hills ; but of this, more 
than 1000 acres are fit to be improved and could be brought under 
cultivation, at a moderate expense ; and a great deal of it would 
be as productive as some now under the plough. 

Rent. — The average rent of arable land per acre is somewhat 
under L. 1. The average rent of grazing an ox or cow is about 
L. 1 for the summer or grass season, and about L. 1, 10s. for the 
winter ; the keep of a sheep, about 2s. 6d. a-year. 

Live Stock. — The common breed of sheep is the black-faced ; 
and of cattle, the hummel or dodded. The colour preferred is black, 
dun, or branded. Some, however, have lately introduced the Ayr- 



174 



KINCARDINESHIRE. 



shire breed ; but whether that will be more advantageous than 
the other kinds, is not yet ascertained. 

Husbandry. — The farms are partly under a fifth, and partly 
under a seventh shift rotation. In case of the former, two-fifths 
of the arable land are under grain crop; one-fifth under green 
crop, viz. turnips and potatoes ; one-fifth in hay, and one fifth in 
pasture grass. In case of the latter, three-sevenths are in grain 
crop ; one-seventh under green crop, one-seventh in hay, and two- 
sevenths are pastured. 

During the currency of the present leases, which were all for 
nineteen years, a great deal of waste land has been reclaimed by 
the tenants, — generally by trenching; as the number of large 
stones renders plowing impossible. Drains are cut where necessary 
and filled up ; the stones are all turned up, blown with gun pow- 
der and carted off the field ; and lime, from fifteen to twenty bolls 
per imperial acre, applied ; but dung must also be used, before a 
new field is fully productive. The farm -buildings in the whole 
parish, are, in general, in good repair, and all belong to the pro- 
prietor. The want of capital is an obstacle to improving waste 
land, by the tenants ; but even if they had the command of capital, 
a nineteen years lease is too short to repay a tenant for improving 
effectually. Some part of the expense, perhaps a half, should be 
borne by the proprietor. There is limestone in various parts of 
the parish, but no quarry has been regularly wrought ; nor is the 
quality of the rock properly ascertained. 

Fishings. — There are two or three salmon-fishings on the Dee, 
within the parish ; but the produce has diminished yearly for some 
time, and is now insignificant. This decrease is attributed to the 
mode of fishing with bag-nets at the mouth of the river, which 
intercepts the fish ; and it may be also owing, partly, to the exten- 
sive works carried on for several years, in improving the harbour, 
of Aberdeen, where the river empties itself. 

Produce. — The yearly produce of the parish may be estimated 
as follows : 

Total imperial acres under cultivation, 4000, as far at least as the writer of this re- 
port has been able to ascertain. 
Two-fifths of which in grain crop oats and barley, 4 quarters per acre, exclusive

V, — Parochial Economy. 

Means of Communication. — There is no market-town or village 
within the parish ; Aberdeen and Stonehaven are the places where 
farm produce is sold ; each about thirteen miles from the centre 
of the parish. There is no post-office nearer than Banchory, five or 
six miles distant ; but most letters for this parish come through the 
post-office of Aberdeen ; as the farmers being frequently there, 
get their letters with less trouble and delay than when sent by 
Banchory. There is only one turnpike road, which passes through 
the parish for about four miles, called the Slug Road, leading from 
Stonehaven to Banchory. But a commutation road to Aberdeen 
on the south side of the river, is kept in good repair ; and several 
cross roads leading to other lines of communication are now in the 
course of being finished. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church was built in theyear 1822 
by the late proprietor, and is in sufficient repair, affisrding accom- 
modation for 550 sitters, and none of the seats are let. The manse 
was built about sixty years ago, but, having never been well finished 
nor commodious, it is now unfit for the minister, and a new one is 
about to be built. The glebe measures about fifteen imperial acres, 
besides a patch of pasture which is of little value, being frequently 
covered over with sand from the river. By an ice speat in January 
1831, a great part of the best of this glebe, together with the crop of 
turnips and soil, was entirely carried off, and nothing left but bare 
■gravel; and in another place, about three acres of the best land 
entirely disappeared, and now make part of the bed of the river. 
The late proprietor, the Duke of Gordon, in the most handsome 
manner, made a compensation to the minister for this extensive 
loss, increasing the glebe to the extent above-mentioned. If let 
at the same rent as the land of the same quality in the neighbour- 
hood, the glebe and garden, with the office-houses, vrould bring 
L. 18 or L. 20 a-year. The stipend payable by the proprietor for 
this valuable parish, including allowance for communion elements, 
L. 8, 6s. 8d., is only L. 76, 12s. 6d.. The deficiency is made up 

 Since this Account was drawn up, a new tuniikc road is in the course of heing 
made from Aberdeen to Bancliory Ternan, which will intersect this parish for five 
miles and a-half, along the south side of the Dee.

from the Exchequer allowance, so as to make the stipend L. 150. 
I find a valuation of the teinds in the year 1773, a few months 
after the settlement of my predecessor, before he could possibly 
be aware whether the valuation was fairly made or otherwise. 

There is no chapel or other place of public worship of any kind 
within the parish. The people are all Presbyterians, with the ex- 
ception of part of one family of Independents, and about twenty 
individuals of the Popish faith, who attend worship at the Popish 
College of Blairs, in the neighbouring parish of Maryculter. 

Education. — The schools in the parish are two, — the parochial 
school near the church, at which are taught, reading English, Eng- 
lish grammar, writing, arithmetic, and Latin. The salary is L. '29, 
besides the emoluments which the teacher enjoys as clerk to the ses- 
sion, and fees paid by the scholars, the average amount of which is 
3s. 6d. per quarter. The situation altogether may be worth L. 56 per 
annum. There is also another school under the patronage of the 
kirk-session. It is generally called Mr Hog's Charity School, 
because it was first instituted by a Mr Hog, a native of this parish, 
who, in 1787, left L. 5 per annum for a salary to the teacher, but 
for which he is required to teach gratis ten poor children recom- 
mended by the kirk-session, if so many should claim that privilege. 
The late minister also left L. 100 under the session's manage- 
ment, the interest of which was to be yearly paid to this school- 
master, to augment his salary. The above, with a small croft of 
land, which the late proprietor gave gratis, and which is still con- 
tinued, is all the income of this teacher, except the fees, which 
are the same as at the parish school. The branches of education 
taught are also the same, with the exception of Latin. His income 
scarcely exceeds L. 30 a year. At both schools, the instruc- 
tion of the pupils in the Assembly's Shorter Catechism and the 
principles of the Christian religion is duly attended to. From this 
statement, it does not appear that any more schools are necessary. 
The parents in general are inclined to educate their families as 
far as their circumstances permit ; and a sewing-school for girls 
has been established for several years. There is scarcely any 
person in the parish above fifteen years of age, who cannot read and 
write more or less, nor is there any from six to fifteen years, who, 
if they cannot read and write, are not in the course of being m- 
structed. 

Poor.— The average number of persons receiving parochial aid 



DURIUS. 



177 



is 25; the yearly sum allowed to each, at an average, is L. 1, 15s. 
The annual amount of collections at the church is L. 33, includ- 
ing a little for mortcloth money. Interest of money lent, L. 10; 
penalties and occasional donations, L. 6, 10s. No other mode 
has been adopted here, of providing for the poor. The reluctance 
to receive parochial relief is now rarely to be met with. Besides 
the above persons receiving aid, there are nearly as many who re- 
ceive a small sum yearly from Mr Hog's mortification already men- 
tioned. The sum left was L. 500 three per cents reduced, yielding 
L. 15 a-year. This was sold out, a few years ago, for L. 420, and 
placed at interest in this country. The particulars, are these : — 
L. 5 to a schoolmaster ; L. 1 to the kirk-session, for their trouble 
in managing the fund; 10s. to the session-clerk for keeping the 
books; 10s. to the herds round the hill of Cairnshea, to make a 
midsummer fire on that hill, where the donor himself had once 
kept cattle ; and the remainder, about L. 9, to poor householders 
not on the poor's roll. 

Fairs. — There are three fairs held in the parish annually, one 
in May, one in June, and one in September, all for selling cattle ; 
none of them very numerously attended. 

Inns. — There are four inns, whereas one, or at most two, should 
be sufficient. 

Fuel. — The fuel mostly used is peats and turf from the hills. 
For a farmer's house, sixty or seventy loads are required in a year, 
one-half peats and the other half turf; expense per load, casting 
and drying, of peats Is., of turf, 7d., besides driving them home, 
which is done with their own horses and servants. When driving 
is paid for, the cost is Is. 6d. or Is. 8d. per load, according to the 
distance. Most families, however, besides this species of fuel, use 
a few bolls of English coal.

PRESBYTERY OF ABERDEEN, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN, 

THE REV. GEORGE MORISON, D. D. MINISTER. 

I- — Topography and Natural History. 

Name.~lN the Advocates' Library there has been found a do- 
cument confirmative of what was formerly traditional, that the dis- 
tinctive appellation of Devinick is derived from a wonder-working 
saint of the name of Davinicus, who flourished about the year 887 ; 
and of whose ministrations this parish was at one period the scene. 

Situation, Boundaries, Sj-c. — The figure of the parish is extremely 
irregular. It is situated partly in Kincardineshire, and partly in 
Aberdeenshire, — the River Dee being here the boundary of both 
counties. The most elevated part of the Tollohill, the easter- 
most of the range of Grampians, is in the Kincardineshire division 
of the parish, and afi"orded a station for the gentlemen who were 
employed by Government to make the trigonometrical survey of 
the island. About three miles of this parish is bounded by the sea. 

Topographical Appearances. — The coast is bold, rocky, and 
picturesque. Its undulations are numerous, with many inlets and 
projections frequented by migratory sea-fowls, and wild pigeons, 
but has no caves of great depth inland, and affords no safe anchor- 
age ; and only three harbours for fishing-boats — Findon, Port- 
lethen, and Downees. ,At Portlethen, in favourable weather, lime 
and coals may be landed from small vessels, but the road from the 
shore is very steep, insomuch that the tenant of the adjoining farm 
has erected a machine for bringing up sea-weed for manure. 

The climate is healthy, and no disease is peculiar to the 
district. 

Hydrography. — The Dee, which rises amongst the highest 
mountains of Aberdeenshire, after a course of sixty miles, passes 
through this parish, and is here, as has been said, the boundary 
between Aberdeen and Kincardineshires. Its breadth here may 
be about 250 feet. It is liable to great floods, rising nine, ten, 



BANCHORY DEVENICK.

or eleven feet above its usual level ; and as its haughs are ex- 
tensive and valuable, they have been embanked by the proprietors 
at a very considerable expense. As, however, land of this de- 
scription suffers chiefly from running water, whilst that whose flux 
and reflux is still and quiet, rather enriches the soil, it seems now 
to be pretty well understood, that no embankment is of much use, 
farther than effectually to defend haughs at the upper end, where 
they come first in contact with the stream. At this point, the 
river, meeting with obstruction, will rise a foot or eighteen inches 
higher than at any other. The embankment, therefore, may be 
formed so as to slope gradually till past the middle or belly of the 
haugh, when it may be permitted to fall to the level of the land, 
taking care that the natural banks below be properly sloped and 
turfed. 

This mode of embanking is executed at little more than half the 
expense, and answers a better purpose than embanking the whole ; 
for daily experience shows that no embankment is proof against 
back water, and finding its way through the embankment in a fil- 
tered state, it can, to say the least, be of no service to the soil over 
which it has flowed. Besides, the water admitted in this way is 
much longer in making its escape, and has been found on that ac- 
count materially to injure a turnip crop subjected to its chilling- 
influence. 

1'he Dee empties itself into the bay of Aberdeen, about a mile 
and a half below the eastern .extremity of this parish, and meets 
the tides when highest at that point; immediately above which, on 
the property of Mr Menzies of Pitfodels, it gives out the water 
which, under the late Act of Parliament, supplies the town of 
Aberdeen and its vicinity ; and to eff"ect which important purpose, 
works have been erected and metal pipes laid at an expense of 
nearly L. 40,000. 

It is worthy of remark, that on the whole course of the Dee, 
from the Linn, above Mar Lodge, to its mouth, which may be 
about sixty miles, exclusively of its windings, it does not drive one 
water-wheel. Several attempts have been made to render it avail- 
able for this purpose, but they have always proved abortive, after 
considerable expense had been incurred. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — On these subjects, this parish presents 
nothing deserving particular notice. Its soils are of all varieties, 
from the purely alluvial to hard till, on the one hand, and from 
rich loam to deep moss on the other ; and when this last is ex-

KINCARDINESHIRE. 



hausted, by being carried off for fuel, no marl has been found, 
and the subsoil is, in general, extremely worthless. Abundance 
of blue granite is to be found in the hilly parts of the parish; but 
It is of so hard a quality, that it is not quarried to any extent, and 
is chiefly formed into causeway stones, for home consumpt, or for 
the London market. 

Zoology.— have all the common wild animals, both such as 
are indigenous, and such as are migratory, and sometimes a stray 
bird or two of rarer species, but none deserving of particular no- 
tice. 

The gooseberry caterpillar is here and all over the country very 
prevalent. About forty years ago, my bushes were annually strip- 
ped of their leaves, and the crop destroyed. By careful observa- 
tion, I found the worms deposited in the chrysalis-state, at the 
depth of from one and a half to two inches below the surface of 
the ground, under the bushes. This cover, provided by nature 
for their protection, 1 removed, scattering it over the adjacent 
ground, and thus exposed the nymphse to the winter frosts. This 
operation I repeated three successive seasons, since which time I 
have never lost a crop of gooseberries by caterpillars. 

Salmon. — The natural history of fishes is a difficult subject, and 
consequently theory in place of well established facts has been 
adopted; and in the case of salmon, it has even been made the 
foundation of legislative enactments. That salmon spawn in all 
rivers I presume there is no doubt ; but that an infinitely greater 
number deposit their spawn on sand banks in the sea, I hold to be 
more than probable, and the statement has never been disproved. 
The winter of 1830 was rather a severe one ; — the ice in our river 
attained a considerable thickness, and when it broke up, it was 
I'emarked, that a great deal of salmon spawn was thrown out upon 
the banks by the floating ice, and destroyed. From this circum- 
stance it was predicted, that in the season of 1831 there would be 
very few grilses or young fish. Now the very reverse of this took 
place ; the number of grilses bore a much greater proportion than 
usual to that of the old fish. 

Botany. — Under this head, I know not if it be worthy of notice 
that in this parish we have a considerable variety of indigenous 
plants of great beauty, such as the Menyanthes or bogbean, the 
Trientalis Europasa, the Hyjjericum pulchrum, the Anthericuvi os- 
sifragum, the Pyrola rotundifolia, the Drosera rotundifolia, or 
sundew, and many others, more beautiful than some which are

181 



brought from tb Cape of Good Hope; besides several Alpine 
plants, brought down from the mountains, and deposited by the 
Dee upon its shores. 

Plantations. — On the subject of plantations it may be remark- 
ed, that so much has not been done hitherto as might be wish- 
ed. In that part of the parish which lies along the sea-coast, fo- 
rest trees will not thrive. Shelter from the immediate influence 
of the east wind seems indispensable. But although much barren 
surface possessing this advantage remains in a state of nature, the 
plantations of Mr Thomson of Banchory, covering about 250 
acres, and one on the property of Pitfodels of considerable extent, 
are well attended to, and are in a thriving condition.  

II. — Civil History. 
Land-owners. — There are seventeen land-owners in this parish. 
Mr Thomson of Banchory is the first heritor in point of valued 
rent, and Mr Menzies of Pitfodels the second. There are, how- 
ever, several others whose properties are of considerable value, as 
Mr Symmers of Cults ; Mr Anderson of Dee Bank ; and Mr 
Corbett of Buildside, in the Aberdeenshire district ; and Miss For- 
dyce of Ardo ;f Mr Nicol of Badentoy ; Mr Gammel of Portle- 
then ; Mr Shandof Hillside ; and Mr Boswellof Auchlee, in the 
Kincardineshire district. None of the heritors, however, reside in 
the parish all the year, except two ; and only four during the sum- 
mer months. 

Parish Registers. — We have no parochial registers of earlier date 
than the beginning of last century. Since that time, they have been 
regularly kept, with the exception of a hiatus from April 1713 to 
March 1716. 

From the early part of the record, it appears that the principal 
feasts and fasts of the Church of England were regularly obsei'v- 
ed : and at date 19th October 1712, we find the following minute t 
— " The said day, intimation was made to the congregation, that 
the next Lord's day, the excellent liturgy of the Church of En- 
gland was to be used in the worship of God in this congregation, 
and, accordingly, the people were exhorted to perform this method 
of worship in a spirit of devotion, and with that becoming gravity 
and decency that was expected from those who had been so ex- 

• Since the abore was written, Mr Thomson of Banchory has added considerably 
to bis plantations; and 12 or 13 acres have been planted on the estate of Ardo, and 
a few on that of Mr Thurburn of Murtle. 

t This lady is now dead, and has been succeeded by a family named VValson, to 
whom she bequeathed the property. John Garioch, Esq. of Ileathcot, has now be- 
come a proprietor by the purchase of the fisiiing village, and part of the land of Findon 
connected with it.

emplary heretofore in the worship of God." 26th October 1712, 
the following is inserted :— « The said day, according to the fore- 
said intimation, the liturgy of the Church of England was first used 
in the public worship of God in this parochial church, in order to 
the continuance thereof— for advancing of which excellent worship, 
there were 200 books of common prayer given to the minister out 
of the charity books, sent from England to Scotland to be distri- 
buted gratis, charges of freight excepted, which 200 books were 
distributed some weeks before, among such of the parishioners as 
were capable of using them, as also a folio book for the minister, 
and a quarto for the clerk."—" Kneeling-boards were also placed 
in the pews." 

This mode of worship appears to have been used till April in 
the following year, when the hiatus in the register occurs,- after 
which there is no farther mention of it. 

Antiquities.— There are on the property of Auchlee, belonging 
to Mr Boswell of Kingcausie, two of those circles of stones com- 
monly called Druidical temples, very perfect. One of these is 
composed of a double row of stones, in the centre of which a stone- 
coffin was discovered many years ago, but containing neither urn 
nor bones. In August 1817, an ancient stone-coffin was discover- 
ed, in repairing a road on the farm of Glashfarquhar, the property 
of Mr Thomson of Banchory. The spot lies about a quarter of 
a mile from the sea, and on the top of a bank of gravel. The cof- 
fin was composed of eight stones, two at each side, one at each 
end, and two forming the cover, and contained the remains 
of a human skeleton and two vases. The skeleton, although 
a good deal decayed, appeared from the jaws to be that of an 
adult. The larger of the vases, which' was broken by the la- 
bourers, must have been about 10 inches in diameter, and 3 
in height. The smaller is 6 inches high, and 5 across the 
mouth. They appear to be made of pounded granite and mica 
slate, commonly found in that vicinity, and covered with a coating 
of clay, which is ornamented with small patterns executed with some 
care. The vases are as round as if turned in a lathe, and appear 
to have been merely dried in the sun. At what period this depo- 
sit was made, must be purely matter of conjecture. 

There are also in an elevated situation on the north side of the 
river, three very large tumuli. None of these have been complete- 
ly cleared out, although they have been greatly diminished in size 
by the removal of stones for the purpose of inclosing.

In forming that part of the turnpike road which passes through 
the estate of Ardo, a stone coffin, in the formation of which no 
tool appeared to have been employed, was dug up. It was bed- 
ded in shingle not sand, was only two feet and a half long, and 
two broad, and contained an urn within, which was a human scull 
of a small size, but apparently that of an adult. 

III. — Population. 

At the time of Dr Webster's report, the population amounted 
to 1495. In 1792, when the last Statistical Account was publish- 
ed, it amounted to 1700, of whom 744 were males. According 
to the census of 1821, it had increased to 2232, and by the census 
of 1831, it is as under :

The increased population of this parish during the present cen- 
tury, is to be ascribed chiefly to two causes — the introduction of 
vaccination in 1803, and the parcelling out tracts of uncultivated 
land, with proper encouragement to small tenants, who, whilst they 
earned a subsistence by labour in the granite quarries and peat- 
mosses in the vicinity of Aberdeen, improved the land allotted to 
them ; by which means, much useless land has been cultivated. 
This plan is still in operation. It was introduced by Mr Menzies, 
and has been followed up by Mr Thomson arid Miss Fordyce with 
considerable success. 

Character of the People, Sfc. — The general habits of the people are 
decent and orderly. They are attentive to the duties of religion ; 
and violations of the Sabbath day are, much to their credit, ex- 
tremely rare. Poaching, and, I may add, smuggling, are unknown 
among us. 

IV. — Industry. 
Wages. — The ordinary wages of day-labourers are from 2d. to' 



184 



KINCARDINESHIRE. 



2d. an hour, summer and winter. In time of harvest, they have 
victuals over and above. 

The cuhivation of waste lands is proceeding as rapidly as could 
be expected ; but much still remains in a state of nature, and it 
■would be extremely difficult to ascertain the extent of cultivated 
and uncultivated land. 

Fisheries. — There are only four salmon-fishings of any import- 
ance on the river Dee, in its course through this parish, — two be- 
longing to Mr Menzies of Pitfodels, one to Mr Thomson of Ban- 
chory, and one to Mr Watson of Ardo. In point of value, they 
have suffered great fluctuation, and are at present verv low, from 
the great and unaccountable scarcity of fish in the river, for these 
twelve or thirteen years back. 

There are three white-fishing stations in the parish, Findon, 
Portlethen, and Downies. In these, the ordinary number of boats 
employed is eighteen, manned with from four to five hands each. 
They never go far out to sea: but since the herring fishery in the 
Moray Frith became an object of attention, the men have fitted 
out thirteen herring-boats with nets, at a very considerable expense, 
and pass about six weeks every summer on that coast, more pro- 
fitably than they could at home. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Toion — Means of Communication. — Aberdeen is our 
nearest market-town, and is only about two miles from the lowest 
extremity of the parish. Stonehaven, the county town of the Kin- 
cardineshire district, is about seven miles from those parts of it 
which are contiguous to the parish of Fetteresso on the south. 
The great turnpike road from Edinburgh to Aberdeen passes 
through the parish from Bourtrybush, near the sixth, to the tenth 
milestone from Stonehaven, where it enters the parish of Nigg; 
and upon the north side of the Dee, the Deeside turnpike passes 
through that division of the parish, leaving the parish of Old Ma- 
char, a little short of the second milestone, and entering that of 
Peterculter about the fifth. We have also the benefit of a good 
commutation road along the south side of the river, which enters 
the parish from the great south turnpike, between the second and 
third milestones from Aberdeen, and leaves it between the fifth and 
sixth, where it enters the parish of Maryculter. 

A suspension bridge for foot-passengers has been erected over 
the Dee about half a mile above the church, by the present in- 
cumbent, for the accommodation of the parish. The span between 



BANCHORY DEVENICK.

the main pillars is 185 feet, and the length of the whole bridge 
305 feet. It cost about L. 1400, independently of an embank- 
ment of about a quarter of a mile long on the south side, forming 
the approach to the bridge. This embankment cost above L. 50, 
and was erected chiefly by subscriptions from those heritors whose 
properties profit most by the bridge. Mr John Smith of Aber- 
deen was the architect, who has contrived to give the bridge such 
a degree of firnuiess, that its motion is scarcely perceptible in the 
heaviest gales of wind. This bridge completely connects the Aber- 
deenshire district of the parish, containing a population of at least 
700, with the church and school, to which there is now easy and 
safe access in all states of the river. 

A turnpike road has been contracted for, and is in progress 
along the south bank of the river, and is intended to supersede the 
commutation road already mentioned. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church was built in the year 
1822, on the site of the old one, which, although not ruinous, was 
pulled down by the heritors, much to their credit, merely on ac- 
count of its inadequacy to accommodate the parishioners. Indeed, 
the population had so much increased, and by consequence the 
number of communicants, that these last could not be contained in 
the old church. There was no date on the old church. The bell 
was cast at Gotin. in 1597 ; and on the coping-stones of the church- 
yard 'gate is the date 1608. 

The church is seated for 900 sitters, and none of the seats are 
let. The distance of the church from the south and south-east 
extremities of the parish may be about five miles ; from the wester- 
most, and eastermost, not more than two;ijbut these last being on 
the opposite side of the river, the situation of the church, in point 
of convenience, may be regarded as sufficiently centrical. Besides, 
at Portlethen there is a chapel' which contains about 300 sitters, 
and in which a licentiate of the Church of Scotland preaches every 
Lord's day. His salary, L. 30, is paid from the seat rents, the col- 
lections being applied to the maintenance of the poor. 

This chapel is situated about three or three and a half miles 
from the parish church, in a populous district. It was a family 
chapel previous to the Reformation, and has been recently repair- 
ed and enlarged, partly by subscription, and partly by an applica- 
tion of some part of the poor's funds, — which last will soon be re- 
placed from the surplus of the seat rents. Before this was done, 
the preacher had not more than L. 24 a year, although drawing

the whole seat rents and collections. When the present incum- 
bent was admitted minister of the parish in 1785, the chapel at 
Portlethen was occupied by any strolling preacher who chose to 
hold forth to the people ; but ever since that time, a licentiate of 
the church has been appointed to it, at first by the minister, with 
concurrence of the proprietor of Portlethen, but latterly, by the 
minister along- with such of the heritors as contributed towards its 
repair. 

In this parish, there are very few Dissenters or Episcopalians, 
and only three Roman Catholic families, and three families of Se- 
ceders : the two last consisting in all of fifteen individuals. 

The teinds of the parish are exhausted, and the minister has 
an allowance of L. 22, 18s. lOd. to make up his stipend to L. 150 
per annum. 

Education. — Besides the parish school, there are in the parish 
three others which may be considered as established :. 1. At 
Portlethen, where a substantial school-room and accommodation 
for the teacher was built some years ago by the present minister 
of the parish, on a building lease from Mr Gammell of Portlethen, 
and L. 200 lodged in the hands of the treasurer of Aberdeen, 
the interest to be applied in the shape of a small salary for the sup- 
port of the teacher. The district is populous, and the school well 
attended. 2. A female school situated near the church ; it was 
built and endowed by a bequest of L. 200 to the kirk-session for 
that purpose, by the late George Hogg of Shannaburn, whose fa- 
ther had been for many years schoolmaster at Banchory. L. 100 
was allotted by Mr Hogg for purchasing a site and building the 
school; and L. 100 to afford a salary to the schoolmistress, f 
3. Mr Symmers, proprietor of Cults, built upon his property, in 
the Aberdeenshire district of the parish, a good house, affording 
accommodation for the scholars and teacher, which he gives rent- 
free to a schoolmaster of his own choosing ; but the teacher has 
no permanent salary, and depends entirely upon a subscription of five 
guineas by Mr Menzies of Pitfodels, who has shewn himself ready 

 The chapel at Portlethen has been enlarged by an aisle, so as to accommodate 
about ."iOO sitters, and in the hope of aid from Government towards its endowment ; 
and Mr Thomson of Banchory having subscribed L. 50, with a promise, at no distant 
period, of four acres of land for a glebe. A subscription is going on for building a 
manse and offices, in order to the district around it being erected into a separate pa- 
rish qmiad sacra — the necessity of which must be perceived at once by looking at if 
populousness and distance from the parish church. 

f The minister of the parish has added L. 100 towards the endowment of this 
school, — the teacher of which has now for salary the interest of I,. 220 in whole.

on all occasions to lend his aid to every measure for the good of 
the parish, and who has a considerable property in the vicinity 
of this school, and a few other lesser gratuities, along with the fees 
of teaching. 

The ordinary branches of education are taught at the first and 
third of these schools ; and in addition to these, Latin is taught 
at the parish school, but few Latin scholars are entered. These 
are all open for an hour and a half or two hours on the Lord's day, 
under regulations agreed to by the minister of the parish along with 
the Trustees of the late Mr Gordon of Murtle, who make an allow- 
ance of L. 10 annually, which is divided among the teachers, who 
have no other remuneration for this partof their duty. These schools 
are open before sermon in winter, and in the afternoon in summer. 
Meetings under night are not permitted. Besides being exercis- 
ed in the catechism, and in reading the Scriptures, such of the 
scholars as have been taught to write are permitted to copy a 
short passage from the New Testament. This institution is of 
decided and obvious advantage to those who attend. 

The parish schoolmaster has a salary of L. 30, with about one- 
third of the usual proportion of the Dick bequest, there being only 
about one-third of the parish in Aberdeenshire ; he likewise re- 
ceives L. 5 per annum for teaching a Sabbath school, being his 
proportion of the annual grant for that purpose by the Trustees of 
the late Mr Gordon of Murtle, and L. 20 per annum for teaching 
twenty children recommended by the session. This last is an en- 
dowment by a benevolent gentleman in Lidia ; but the plan is as 
yet experimental, and the emoluments of the teacher from that 
source are of course contingent. The plan, if permanently adopt- 
ed, is likely to prove a great blessing to the parish. It is conduct- 
ed under the most judicious regulations. 

The amount of fees actually paid to the schoolmaster is proba- 
bly about L. 20 per annum. 

There are three other schools in the parish, unendowed. 

From what is above stated, it will be seen that few parishes are 
better accommodated with the means of education in all branches 
most proper and necessary for the lower classes of the commu- 
nity. The average number of scholars may range from 120 to 140. 

Library. — A good many years ago, a parish library was formed 
under the charge of the parish schoolmaster, and consists of a con- 
siderable number of volumes ; but the demand for books has almost 



KINCARDINESHlllE. 



altogether died away, although the subscription was only one shil- 
ling annually. 

Lunatics.— There is at Aberdeen a lunatic asylum under excel- 
lent regulations, where the pauper lunatics within the bounds of the 
synod are admitted at a board of L. 1 5 per annum : and the thirteen 
country parishes of the Presbytery of Aberdeen, in order to avail 
themselves ofthe advantages which it affords, entered into an associa- 
tion m the year 1803, with a view to aid one another in the mainte- 
nance of their lunatics. They agreed to make a public collection an- 
nually, to be thrown into a joint stock for the above purpose ; and 
this fund has, till within these few years, been adequate to the de- 
mands upon it. For some years back, there have been from eight 
to ten patients in the asylum, entirely dependent upon this fund, 
which has occasioned an arrear against it, to the amount of from 
L. 50 to L. 100 ; but, upon the whole, the advantage derived from 
the institution has been, and continues to be, very great. 

Friendly/ Society/.— There is a Friendly Society here, of more 
than fifty years standing, which has done, and  continues to do 
good, although its allowances to the sick and aged are not very 
ample. It has resolved to comply with the regulations, and avail 
itself of the benefits, ofthe act 1829, an act which, being complex, 
and not very easily understood, has occasioned the breaking up of 
a great many Friendly Societies in this part of the country. 

Savings Bank. — There is also in the parish a Savings bank, es- 
tablished about sixteen years ago, whose funds exceed L. 3000, 
and whose subscribers are not fewer than 120. It is open for busi- 
ness quarterly, and has been the means of saving a large sum which 
would otherwise have been dissipated uselessly, and to the dete- 
rioration of the morals of the people. 

State ofthe Poor and Poor's Funds.— The average number of 
poor may be about 64. Our funds for their relief consist of inte- 
rest of lent money, L. 50 ; mortifications, mortcloth, penalties, &amp;c. 
L. 14; collections at the doors ofthe church, and Portlethen cha- 
pel, L. 71 ; total L. 135 — not averaging ld. a day to every poor 
person, — an allowance totally inadequate to their support ; and, as 
we have no strolling poor belonging to the parish, it sets in a strik- 
ing point of view the private charity ofthe community at large, and 
more especially of the working classes, in whose vicinity paupers are 
situated. It is much to be regretted that charitable bequests are 
not exempted by legacy duty : for surely no tax that could be sub- 
stituted in the place of it, could be half so exceptionable as one

by which a duty of 10 per cent, is levied upon the poorest and 
most deplorably destitute class of the population. 

Public-houses. — Notwithstanding every endeavour on the part 
of the minister, and of the most influential heritors of the parish, 
to get rid of the nuisance of pubUc-houses, we have still eight in 
the parish, none of which can be said to be necessary, but the one 
at Bourtrybush, the half-way house between Stonehaven and 
Aberdeen. There are indeed two others, — one in each of the great 
fishing villages of Findon and Portlethen, for which, being situat- 
ed on a rocky coast where wrecks sometimes occur, there is a plau- 
sible pretext. 

Fuel. — Although there are extensive peat mosses in the Kincar- 
dineshire district of the parish, coals are consumed in considerable 
quantities by all classes, and are unquestionably the cheapest fuel.

PRESBYTERY OF ABERDEEN, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. JOHN BOWER, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — As noted in the former Statistical Account, the ori- 
ginal orthography of this parish seems to have been Maries cultura 

Extent, Si-c. — It is of an oblong form, 6 English miles in length 
and 2 in breadth, extending from the river Dee to the Grampian 
Mountains. 

Soil. — The soil on the river side is naturally thin and sandy; on 
the rising midland, it becomes deeper and blacker, with a bottom 
of clay in some parts ; and more southward, the ground turns 
swampy, turfy, and mossy. The extremities of the parish are in 
some places rocky hills and mosses ; in others, green hills with 
large stones, rushy moors, and heath. Indeed the whole district 
is rocky and stony, except some small haughs and dales on the 
river side. Much of the parish is thin ground, and recumbent, as 

At the same time it may be observed, that an eminent Gaelic scholar states, that 
Cul ttra means the back of the land."

are many parts of the north of Scotland, or what is locally termed 
a pan or moorband. 

Climate.— The temperature of the atmosphere is low. On the 
whole, throughout the year there is little sunshine, a good deal of 
ram, but comparatively little snow. The prevailing wind seems to 
be south-west. 

Hydrography.— The parish is well supplied with springs, and 
the water is particularly good. The Dee washes almost all the 
north side of the parish. This river is subject to great and sud- 
den floods, so that no mill can be driven by its waters : hence 
the small streams are used. A remarkable flood occurred on the 
17th September 1768; another on the 4th August 1829. 

Geology.— The rocks are all of primitive formation, granite 
chiefly, gneiss in large masses. What is termed " iron slag" is 
found in this parish. In the mosses are found great quantities of 
timber, particularly oak of very large size, birch, and alder, with 
shells of nuts. 

Zoology.— In Kingcausie wood, are roe-deer, sometimes in con- 
siderable numbers. A few years ago, rabbits were unknown here : 
they are now very frequent and destructive. Very few sheep are 
bred or fed in the parish. Every season flocks of Highland sheep 
are wintered in this parish— removed to the hills in March or 
April. A considerable number of swine are reared at mills and 
farm-houses, but all for exportation, as the lower ranks eat no 
pork. The breed has been greatly improved, being crosses of 
the Chinese with Berkshire and other breeds. They are sent to 
London, both alive, and when cured in the shape of ham, the ship- 
ping taking the refuse. 

Fishings. — The part of the Dee opposite to the parish formerly 
let at high rents for salmon-fishing, but now will not repay the 
fishermen's wages, owing to the stake and bag-nets at the mouth 
of the river. 

Botany. — The parish is rich in botany. Among the rarer spe- 
cies are the Paris quadrifolia, and Linncea borealis, found in the 
woods of Kingcausie. 

Considerable portions of the parish are covered with wood. The 
trees to which the soil appears most congenial are the larch and 
spruce, birch and beech. 

II. — Civil History. 
Antiquities. — Part of this parish would seem to have been once 
a favourite haunt of the Knights Templars. 



MARYCULTER. 



191 



There abound common small " cairns" indicative of battle- 
fields, in which are found teeth and other human remains. 

Parochial Reffisters.— Registers are regularly kept. Of those • 
that can be now found, none are of ancient date. The oldest re- 
gister of discipline begins May 1719, and the oldest of births and 
baptisms 1696. 

Land-owners. — The land is held by seven heritors ; more than 
the half by Mr Gordon of Fyvie and Maryculter. The other chief 
land-owners are Mr Boswell of Balmuto and Kingcausie ; Mr Du- 
guid of Auchlunies ; Mr Garioch of Heathcote ; and the proprie- 
tors of Blairs. The estate of Blairs formerly belonged to Mr 
Menzies of Pitfoddels, but, not many years ago, was gifted by him 
to the church of Rome. 

Mansion- Houses. — The gentlemen's seats are those of Mary- 
culter, Kingcausie, Heathcote, and Auchlunies. That of Mary- 
culter is situated on a bank overhanging the Dee, and is embo- 
somed in wood ; the beauty of the situation is great, but, as there 
is no lawn, the scene is not of great extent. Kingcausie stands at 
the top of a fine lawn, at the bottom of which flows the Dee. 
There is much old timber all round the house and about the 
grounds ; and having also a fine rising bank of wood, it has thus a 
particularly English appearance. The American shrubs seem well 
adapted to the soil, and are to be found in great profusion and 
splendour throughout the pleasure-grounds and even woods — par- 
ticularly the common and small rhododendrons and kalmias, &amp;c. 
A romantic glen, called the Corby-pot, forming part of the bound- 
ary between the properties of Maryculter and Kingcausie, is noted 
for its flora. Heathcote is a handsome new house in the villa 
style, surrounded with young wood. Auchlunies is an old house, 
but also well sheltered with wood, and has grounds prettily laid 
out.

Persons holding crofts from the larger tenants or middle-men 
have greatly decreased in number ; and the farms are now lar- 
"ger, or hold of the landlord. The holdings are still, however, 
.small, rarely exceeding what four horses can labour. 

From what was said at the commencement of this Account re- 
specting the nature of the soil, &amp;c. it is obvious that the thorough 
improving of waste ground here must be attended with much la- 
bour and expense. Agricultural improvements, however, have 
been carried on with great vigour and success, and continue to be 
so, particularly on the estate of Kingcausie, partly in this parish 
and partly in the adjoining one of Nether Banchory, through the 
ably directed and persevering exertions -of its proprietor, Mr Bos- 
well, who not unfrequently brings the waste ground above describ- 
ed from the annual value of Is. to L. 2 Sterling. 

A farm Swellhead on the estate of Kingcausie, is at present 
undergoing a change of this sort, viz. from useless bogs and swamps, 
to dry and valuable ground. . Draining, coating over with clay the 
peat moss, enclosing, and manuring, chiefly with dung from Aber- 
deen, have effected an increase of value in the farm that is alto- 
gether surprising ; and, from being capable of producing only 40 
or 50 quarters of grain, it will shortly yield from 450 to 500 quar-. 
tars per annum. A large court of offices and water thrashing-mill, 
instead of a few dry stone hovels, give that part of the parish a 
cultivated appearance. Mr Boswell puts in the Deanston, or 
" small frequent" drain, of many miles extent, every year; but they 
are not as yet much adopted in this part of the country. 

For many years, turnips have been raised universally or rather 
form a part of the usual rotation. Bone-dust is used to an im- 
mense extent in this parish, even by the smallest tenants. No 
wheat is raised in this parish. 

Eent.—The rents are from 15s. to L. 1, 15s. per imperial acre. 
The average rent of grazing full-grown oxen, say of 50 stone 
imperial, on moor ground, may be about L. 1, 10s., in pasture 
fields from L. 2 to L. 2, 10s. 

Wages. — The day's wages of a common labourer are, at present, 
from Is. 6d. per day of ten hours to Is. 8d., best men ; of house- 
carpenters'from 2s. to 2s. 4d. Male servants on farms receive 
from L. 8 to L. 12 per annum; female servants from L. 2 to L. 5 
and upwards per annum, f 

• This gentleman has kindly furnished a great deal of information for this. Account, 
t These were the parish wages in 1833 : contractors' wages are generally higher.

Live-Stock. — The horses here are poor, but fast improving in 
breed. Black-cattle small, but good ; all black or dark, and free 
from white, almost all without horns. Short-horn or Teeswater 
bulls are fast coming into fashion, several of which are to be found 
in the parish, — imported to cross with the native cow. 

The prices of provisions are the same as at the Aberdeen market. 

Much has been done in the way of draining, both in cutting 
channels for brooks, and also in under-ground draining with stone. 

The leases are all, or almost all, of nineteen years duration. 

Quarries. — Granite is quarried in small quantities; but there is 
no extensive work of this nature. 

Fishings. — There are five salmon-fishings in the parish. The 
reduced state of the rents of them has been already noticed. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication. — There is no village or market-town 
in the parish. There are excellent roads in it ; of turnpike about 
two miles. There is as yet no public carriage. 

Nearly fifteen miles of a new turnpike road through this and the 
adjoining parishes are almost finished. This road will be a very 
material improvement to the district of the country, running all that 
distance in a great measure parallel to, and in some places almost 
on the brink of the Dee ; and in regard to engineering, beauty of 
execution, and scenery, it is almost unrivalled. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is very conveniently 
situated for the population. It was built in 1787, and its present 
state of repair is good. It affords accommodation for about 460 
persons, allowing eighteen inches for each seat. 

The manse appears to have been built about twenty-nine years 
before the present church. There have been additions to it since, 
one lately, — with repairs. The offices were lately rebuilt. The extent 
of the glebe, exclusive of the sites of the manse arid offices, is ten 
acres imperial ; its value about L. 2, 8s. per acre in its present 
state of cultivation. As to the amount of the stipend, it consists of 
L. 149, 12s. 7d. in money, omitting some fractional parts, and 
in victual, of oatmeal, 23 bolls, 3 firlots, 3 pecks, 1 lippie ; of 
bear, 6 bolls, 2 firlots, 2 lippies ; and of corn 1 firlot,— in the old 
measure, omitting some fractional parts, — for which victual-sti- 
pend, money may or may not be received. It has been received 
for some considerable time, according to the fiars of the year. The 
teinds are exhausted. 

The great majority of the inhabitants belong to the Estabhshed

Church, and divine service in it is well attended. There are five 
or six Episcopalians, and a considerable number of Roman Catho- 
lics. There are about eight Roman Catholic families. There is 
also a large Roman Catholic seminary, where from twenty-five to 
thirty-five youth of that persuasion, chiefly intended for the priest- 
,hood, are maintained and educated under the tuition of a presi- 
dent, and several masters. Forming part of the buildings of this 
seminary, is a Roman Catholic chapel, which is attended by a few 
Roman Catholics besides those in the parish . This seminary and 
chapel are on the property of Blairs, which, as has been already 
noticed, was gifted, not many years ago, to the church of Rome, by 
Mr Menzies of Pitfoddels. 

Since 1833, one family of Burgher Seceders has entered the 
parish. 

Education. — A new parochial school, apart from the school- 
house, has just been erected, capable of accommodating 90 scho- 
lars, allowing 15 inches of seating for each. The branches of in- 
struction generally taught are, English, reading and spelling, 
writing, and arithmetic. The Scriptures are read daily, and the 
catechism is taught regularly. Latin is taught occasionally. The 
salary is L. 30 per annum. The amount of the school-fees receiv- 
ed may be about L. 10. 

There are two or three teachers connected with the Established 
Church who have small schools, in which are taught reading and 
writing. Their remuneration is what they may receive from the 
parents, except that one who teaches sewing also besides small 
fees, has a house, and some additional aid from Mrs Boswell of 
Kingcausie. The average number of all the children that receive 
elementary instruction at these schools exclusive of the parochial 
one, may be about 40. In the parochial school, at a late exami- 
nation, the number present was 77. On many Sundays, before 
public worship begins, children of the parish come up to the pa- 
rish church, and receive instruction fi-om the minister, the elders 
of the church assisting. 

There is a parochial library. It was instituted in 1822, and now 
contains 336 volumes. 

Savings Bank. — A savings bank was instituted in 1823. The 
stock, June 2, 1832, was L. 278, 9s. 3d. There were received 
from June 2, 1832, to 1st June 1833, L. 63, 10s. 6d. : drawn 
during that period, L. 84, 17s. Id. ; le ving stock in the savings 
bank, at the date June 1, 1833, L. 257, 2s. 8d.. It is by servants

that the investments are generally made. No individual can de- 
posit a larger sum than L. 20 Sterling. 

There are no legal assessments here. The collections in church, 
exclusive of collections for the General Assembly's Four Schemes, 
the Infirmary in Aberdeen, and a Lunatic Hospital fimd, amount- 
ed last year to L. 40, 7s. 6d. a great deal for a small and rather 
poor parish. The poor's funds, from which interests at diflferent 
rates arise, amount now to upwards of L. 700 Sterling, of which 
sum the larger part is from a legacy bequeathed by the late Mr 
Gordon of Heathcote, formerly of Premnay. 

Inns. — There is only one inn or alehouse in the parish. 

Fuel. — The common fuel was peat, though coals are now found 
to be cheaper, and are great.y used by all who have not horses 
and carts of their own. As Aberdeen is not distant, they can be 
driven thence without much expense.

PRESBYTERY OF ABERDEEN, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER THOM, MINISTER. 



• — Topography and Natural History. 

Aawe.— The word Nigg in Gaelic signifies a nook or peninsula. 

The chain of mountains which nearly divides Scotland, called 
the Grampians, terminate on the east, at the German Ocean, in 
this parish. The parish forms also the north-east point of the 
county of Kincardine. In shape, it is a peninsula. 

Extent, Boundaries, -c— Its greatest length is about 5 miles, 
its breadth about 3, its extent about 15 square miles. On the 
north-east, the land turning into a ne.ss or headland, runs out into 
the sea, and is called the Girdleness. On the north-west, it is 
washed by the River Dee, and the tide in Aberdeen harbour ; 
and on the south-west, it is bounded by the parish of Ban- 
chory Devenick; on the east it presents to the sea a bold face of 
rock, from 60 to 80 feet high, covered with grass and various 
herbs and flowers : then there is a rising bank, arable from the top 
of the rock to some distance, increasing towards the southern extre-

•'ty, — and above, towards the west, an ascending heathy ridge of 
hill, rising to about 200 feet above the sea, through the whole breadth 
of the parish, and crowned with two cairns, which are seen several 
leagues off at sea, and serve to direct those who sail near the coast. 
During the late war, a flag-staff was erected upon the highest one, 
to give notice of the approach of enemies' ships. The north 
side of the parish consists of two haughs on the river and the side 
of the hill ending in the Girdleness, and of a valley and hill be- 
neath the heathy ridge above described. 

A part of the soil is clayey, but the far greater part is black 
and loamy, of various depths, and on different bottoms. The 
haughs, the valley, and sides, as well as tops of the two hills to 
the north, and the bank to the south, are in a state of cultivation, 
particularly the whole of Torry Hill, so called from its vicinity to 
the village of .Torry, the top of which, a few years ago, was in a 
state of nature, encumbered with stones and covered with furze. 
A broad belt of above a mile, more or less, throughout the middle 
and the whole length of the parish, with the exception of some 
acres perhaps one hundred lately cultivated, and others in pro- 
gress of trenching, is unarable, wild, and uninhabited, consisting 
of moss and heath, intermixed with a prodigious number of surface 
and sunk stones. 

Coast, Sc. — A mile from the south-west boundary of the parish, 
there is a natural harbour, formed with very little artificial help, — 
the Cove, fit for boats, which accommodates the fishermen of a village 
adjoining, and is often a place of refuge to boats when overtaken 
with a north-easterly storm. In the neighbourhood of this place, 
there is a cave entering from the sea, several yards inland, and 
terminating in a beach, and covered with solid rock, from which, 
probably, the village has received its name. In the rocks along 
the coast, there are several of these caverns or excavations, arched 
in a very wonderful manner, and running a great way underground. 
There are nine boats in the cove, with six men to each. 

About three-quarters of a mile farther northward, is Bumbank 
Harbour, less safe, — where there has been a white-fishing settlement 
for a considerable period. The original settlers throve well, but 
now it seems to be falling off, probably owing to the less favourable 
terms of their leases. There are two boats in Bumbank ; there 
were formerly three. 

About half a mile still further north, is Aliens Harbour, formerly a 
considerable fishing settlement, now- wholly deserted by fishermen. 



NIGG. 



197 



A few of the houses are occupied by crofters and as offices to far- 
mers. The unfitness of the harbour, and the want of suitable turf 
and moss to cure haddocks, &amp;c. seem to have been the cause of 
the desertion of this settlement. 

Another .natural inlet or harbour, about a mile south of the 
Aberdeen harbour, called Cow-cash, on the Balnagask property, 
has been frequently pointed out to the proprietor, by fishermen, 
as a suitable situation for a fishing village. But the proprietor 
has not come as yet to any determination on the matter. 

There is a free open sea along this coast. The water rises at 
spring tides thirteen feet, and the height of the stream is, at forty- 
three minutes past noon, at full and change. The tide of flood 
runs south-west and by south ; that of ebb, north-east, half north, 
and at the rate of three knots, and at spring-tides four knots in 
the hour. 

From six to eight fathoms at the foot of the rock, the bottom 
deepens, shelving off shore, with sandy, rocky, and various ground, 
and sometimes rising till it sinks to ninety fathoms, at the distance 
of ten or eleven leagues from land ; then it ascends on the fishing 
bank, called the Long Forties, to 33, 34, and 35 fathoms, a few 
leagues over, until it falls into the depth of the North Sea. 

The face of the country is bare, being destitute of wood. A 
great part of the hill of Tullos, part of the Grampians, was plant • 
ed a good many years ago, with trees of different kinds, by the late 
Mr David Morice on the north side of the hill, which is sheltered 
from the sea. The plantation has thriven well, but on the top and 
side of the hill, which is exposed to the sea, it has failed. 

Bays. — In former ages, trees seem to have grown to the edge of the 
sea, in the mouth of the harbour, along the river Dee, and in the 
valley adjoining to the bay of Nigg. This bay is semicircular, about 
a quarter of a mile in diameter. The sea must have flown a consi- 
derable way up the low grounds in this bay, at an early period. But 
from the great quantity of small stones, perhaps brought down 
the river Dee, about a quarter of a mile north, and thrown back 
on the land in this bay, with other alluvial matter, it does not flow 
nearly so far as it had done formerly. It is now kept off by large 
hirsts of small smoothed pebbles, thrown up at different periods. 
Some have accounted for these accumulations of small stones, by 
supposing which is not improbable that the Dee, at one time, 
run down the vale of Nigg. Perhaps the burn that runs down the 
valley, running through soft ground, at its meeting with the oceaq, 



198 



KINCARDINESIIIRK. 



might have been the cause of the formation of the bay of Kigg, the 
earthy matter being constantly washed away, and the stones accu- 
mulating from time to time, and forming the hirsts of pebbles. There 
seem to be three distinct collections of these small stones, formed at 
different periods. The first or farthest inland of these about one 
hundred and fifty yards from the sea is now covered with vegetable 
mould, and is cultivated for crops of various kinds. It rises from 
twelve to fifteen feet above the present level of the sea. Towards 
the south side of it, an excavation was made in the year 1804, near 
a burn running through the low ground in the valley above, to the 

sea, and several feet deeper than the bottom of the burn, for the 

purpose of forming a drain to carry off the water collected in the 
low ground, by a passage to the sea through the beach. In making 
this excavation, the workmen cut through the timbers of a vessel of 
considerable size. The depth at which they cut was about nine or 
ten feet from the surface, and three or four feet beneath the bed of 
the burn. The distance of the spot where the vessel lay is about 
an hundred yards from high water-mark. At what period this 
ship was thrown in, and how so great a quantity of matter requi- 
site to fill up the space above it was accumulated, whether gradual- 
ly or at once, it is impossible to say. 

There is another small bay north of the Bay of Nigg, and close 
by the Girdleness Light-house, called Grey Hope, memorable for 
the loss of the Greenland ship, the Oscar, which happened there 
in the year 1813, with fifty-five persons on board. 

Climate. — I'he air is healthy : along the coast, it is fresh, 
and from the influence of the sea is rather chilly. Yet the 
frost is less intense, — snow continues for a shorter time, and 
the crop ripens sooner, than in places more inland. The east and 
north-east winds prevail a good deal. And sometimes, particu- 
larly in May, mists come off the sea, and also in autumn, destruc- 
tive to the crop on the coast. From the moderate quantity of rain 
which falls upon this east coast, and from the light loamy sandy soil 
absorbing it soon, and from frequent breezes, the ground soon dries, 
and allows grain to be sown early, and the crop soon ripens in ge- 
neral. 

Springs. — There are several chalybeate springs about the cen- 
tre of the parish, though not used medicinalljf. Springs of good 
water abound everywhere throughout the parish. 

There is one lake in the parish, the Loch of Loirston, on the 
south-west boundary, oblong in form, covering about twenty-seven 

3 



NIGG.

acres, and supplying water to a meal-mill, a bone-mill, and saw- 
mill 'in some of the old leases, the liberty of a road is given to the 
tenants in the lower part of the parish, to drive their cattle to this 
loch for watering,— a circumstance which must have been occa- 
sioned by an uncommon drought at that time in the country. 

Mivers.— The River Dee, which forms the harbour of Aber- 
deen, after a course of eighty miles north-east, falls here into the 
sea. On this side of the river and harbour is Torry Pier, where 
ships lie to occasionally. It was much more frequented by shipping 
formerly than now. Sometime ago, a Greenland Company had a 
boiling establishment there. The riveris famous for salmon, although 
there are not now so many caught in it as formerly, owing to the 
number of stake and bag-nets at the mouth of the river, and along 
the coast north and south, and probably also to the annoyance given 
by the harbour improvements, and the constant plying of steam- 
boats, and to the noxious refuse of so many manufactories that 
run into the river. One of the salmon-fishing stations on the Dee, 
the Mid Chingle, formerly productive, has been given up, as not 
covering the expense. 

Geology. The whole parish abounds with rocks of granite, of a 

very hard consistence, of various colours, blue and purple, &amp;c. In 
some places, there are large distinct veins of quartz running through 
the rock. In the low grounds near the bay of Nigg, various al- 
luvial deposits are found, such as white clay, sand, gravel, and rolled 
smooth stones ; and above these, in some places has been formed 
peat moss to the depth of five or six feet. Imbedded therein 
have been found the remains of trees, viz. fir, alder, and oak, lying 
buried at the depth of four or five feet. On the top of the high 
hill, part of the Grampians, there are several little mounds com- 
posed of rounded pebbles, gravel, and sand, in pretty regular strata, 
such as still appear on the beach below. 

Fishes in the River. — Salmion, during October and November, 
go up the rivers to deposit their spawn. Some of the earlier 
spawners return to the sea generally about the end of December, 
or in January. The lobster and crab are found here in their sea- 
sons. The latter is used by the fishers along the coast as bait, as 
is also the limpet, a small shell-fish gathered from the rocks, usual- 
ly by the younger branches of the family. 

Botany. — The artichoke is a plant, to the growth of which the 
climate and soil are particularly favourable. 

Marine Plants. — The sea-weed bladder-fucus grows on the

rocks round the ness and bay of Nigg ; and every three years, is fit 
for being cut, dried, and burned for kelp. But this manufacture, 
■which gave employment to a great many young fisherwomen in this 
parish, under the direction of an overseer, has been given up for 
some years past. 

Several fisherwomen, in the spring and summer, go to the rocks 
atlow tide and gather dulse  Fucus palmatus , bladderlock Fucus 
esculentus, and pepper dulse  Fucus pinnatifidus , which many in 
this country are fond of, and which they sell in Aberdeen. 

II. — Civil History. 

The Bay of Nigg was formerly called San Fittick's Sanctus 
Fitticus, and the church St Fittick's Church. He was perhaps 
some reputed saint or hermit, who had fixed his solitary retreat 
in a retired place, in the neighbourhood of the bay, the probable 
site of which is still to be traced. 

The whole of this parish, before the Reformation, belonged to 
the abbacy of Arbroath. After the Reformation, one-half of it 
came to a predecessor of Mr Menzies of Pitfoddels, the pre- 
sent possessor, the town of Aberdeen holding the other half. 
By the arbitration of two gentlemen, the parish was divided into 
two parts in the year 1786, the town of Aberdeen obtaining the 
half along the lower part of the harbour, and round the coast, and 
Mr Menzies the other part, which went up the river and into the 
interior. Mr Menzies divided his grounds into small farms, which 
he let in lease for nineteen years and a lifetime, after the expiry of 
the nineteen years. Three or four of the liferenters still survive. 
The Town- Council of Aberdeen, soon after, feued out their share 
into nine moderate lots, at from L. 30 to L. 90 a year each. A 
spur has thus been given to industry and improvement, by which the 
lands in this parish have been rendered very valuable. Some of 
the lots since that period have had different proprietors. 

Land-owners. — The chief landholders at present are, John 
Menzies, Esq., Pitfoddels; Alexander Davidson, Esq. of Balnagask 
and North and South Kirkhill ; John Morice, Esq. of Tullos and 
Middleton ; Alexander Crombie, Esq. of North Loirston ; James 
Ferguson, Esq. of Altens ; Alexander Muir, Esq. of South Loirs- 
ton, and the treasurer and master of mortifications of Aberdeen ; 
none of whom are resident. 

Parochial Registers. — The oldest register belonging to this pa- 
rish is a quarto register of baptisms, kept in tolerable order, the 
earliest entry of which is dated August 10, 1675. There are also 



NIGG. 



201 



three folio volumes in good order, of the register of doctrine and 
discipline, the first entry of which is dated December 6, 1757. 

Antiquities. — Abbots Walls are the ruins of a house that be- 
longed to the Abbot of Arbroath, on the haugh opposite to Aber- 
deen, where it is said he spent some months in the summer. 

Several tumuli are found on the hills. In such of them as have 
been opened, nothing very remarkable has been found. 

Modern Buildings. — A few years ago, a handsome new church 
was built in a centrical situation', with a square tower for a bell 
and clock. It is built of granite, on an eminence, and seen at a 
great distance. It has seats for 900 persons, more than sufficient 
for the present population of the parish. It cost L. 1800. 

Girdleness Light-House. — A light-house was founded in the year 
1831, and finished in 1833, on the Girdleness, nearthe mouth of the 
harbour, by order of the Commissioners of Northern Light-houses, 
and under the direction of Robert Stevenson, Esq. their engineer. 
The building consists of a circular tower, with oil and fuel stores in 
the lower part of it. There are two dwelling-houses, one storey each, 
for the accommodation of the light-keepers. The basement course 
of the tower is laid at fifty feet above the medium high water le- 
vel ; and from that level the tower rises to the height of 116 feet, 
which, together with the high lantern of 15 feet, makes the ex- 
treme height 131 feet above the basement course ; and the ex- 
treme diameter at the basement is 23 feet 5 inches. In the tower, 
there are two lanterns or lights 70 feet apart. The first or lower lan- 
tern, which is a 28 sided polygon, is placed at 46 feet 6 inches above 
the basement course, or 96 feet 6 inches above the sea. The wall 
of the tower is here reduced in thickness to 3 feet 4 inches, or 17 
feet 5 inches of external diameter, to make room for the lantern 
sill, and a balcony, forming together a breadth of 5 feet 5 inches. 
The balcony is supported by a strong corbal cornice. The lan- 
tern is formed of sashes surmounted by a cornice, all of cast iron, 
and covered with a roof of cooper. The lantern is glazed towards 
the sea, with plates of glass 28 inches square, and one-fourth of an 
inch in thickness, and towards the land with plates of cast iron, or- 
namented with characteristic figures. The higher lantern is pla- 
ced upon the top of a parapet wall of polished sandstone, which 
rises above the higher corbal cornice 5 feet 5 inches, forming a 
balcony of 3 feet breadth on the top of the corbals, and on the 
exterior of the light-room parapet wall. This lantern is a 16- 
sided polygon, glazed as already described for the lower Ian-

tern with plates of glass towards the sea, of 27 inches square, in 
three tiers, and towards the land with plates of cast iron. The 
whole is covered with a dome of copper. This hght is 170 feet 
above the medium level of high water. 

The dwelling-houses are very compact and comfortable. The 
one house contains a room and kitchen for the principal keeper, 
and a parlour and bed-room for the general inspector. The other 
house contains a room and kitchen for the assistant keeper, a bed- 
room for artificers, and a work-shop. The tower, the oil, and fuel 
stores are separated from the dwelling-houses by an open court, 
70 feet in length, and 40 feet in breadth, neatly laid with granite 
pavement. The access to the lantern is by a stone stair, built 
upon a wall of brick 6 inches in thickness, and separated from the 
stone wall by a void of 3 inches in width through its whole ex- 
tent. The steps amount to 189, the rise of each being 7 inches. 
There are about ten acres of land for a garden and park ground, 
intended as a cow's grass for each light-keeper. The whole is en- 
closed by a stone wall. 

This light-house was first lighted on Tuesday the 15th October 
1833. 

III. — Population. 

In 1755, the population of this parish amounted to 1289, and 
perhaps it continued nearly the same for some years after. 

About seventy or eighty years ago, the granite quarries in this 
parish, which are abundant and of an excellent quality, particular- 
ly for pavement, were opened, and gave employment to about 600 
quarriers. Their subsequent success has been various, — the stones 
being squared, dressed, and carried to the harbour of Aberdeen, 
and thence shipped to London to pave the streets of the metropo- 
lis. But of late, the demand has very much diminished, and now 

 For some weeks before, the following notice was given in Aberdeen newspa- 
pers, viz. " The Girdleness Light-House is placed on the headland of that name, in 
the county of Kincardine. It is situated in Latitude 57 "H' north, and in Longi- 
tude 2 3' west, and immediately off it lies the sunken rock called the Girdle. This 
light-house bears from the north pier of Aberdeen, S. by W. distant 1220 j'ards : — 
from Buchanness Light-house S. W. J W. distant twenty-five miles, and from the Bell 
Rock Light-house N. E.  N. distant forty-three miles, Tlie two lanterns at this 
station are open or glazed from N. N. E. to W. S. W.  W. and intermediate points 
easterly and southerly. The bearings are taken by compass, and the variation is 
26° 4.5' W, 

" Girdleness will be known to mariners as a double light, exhibiting from the same 
tower two fixed lights, like stars of the first magnitude, the one over tlie other. But 
to a distant observer the lights will appear asone, having an elongated form. These 
lights will be from oil, with reflectors placed in lanterns elevated lespectively 11 Sand 
183 feet above the medium level of the sea, and will be seen at the distance of 13 and 
16 miles, and at intermediate distances according to the state of the weather." — By 
order of the Commissioners of the Northern Light Houses," &amp;c.

very few men are employed in them ; in consequence of which, the 
population has decreased. The quarriers have left the parish, and 
gone to other places in quest of employment. 

The driving of these stones to Aberdeen, kept up the popula- 
tion in part, and was of great benefit to the tenants, by employing 
their carts and horses and servants, and enabling them to pay high 
rents. 

A considerable number of the tenants keep a good many milk 
cows, and send their milk, morning and evening, for sale to Aber- 
deen, by which means they are enabled to pay high rents still for 
their grounds, and, with much toil and drudgery, procure a living 
for themselves and families. This also, in part, contributes to keep 
up the population.

fifty years of age ; and double that number of unmarried women, 
upwards of 45. 

The whitefishers in the fishing villages marry early in life, and 
in general have numerous families. 

The average number of children in each family is nearly 3. 

There are 3 fatuous persons in the parish, 4 blind, 2 deaf. 

The habits of the people are in general cleanly ; and the style 
and manner of their dress are very different from what they were 
fifty or sixty years ago. 

In some farms, where a number of servants are required, a 
bothey is used. 

Farm men-servants seldom remain long in one place; some of 
them change almost every half-year. Feeing markets are favour- 
able to this change; and now places are easily obtained without 
any recommendation from the former master. Changes are by no

means so frequent among female servants, who, when of good cha- 
racter, are here highly valued for their services in the work of the 
dairy. 

The people in general enjoy a tolerable degree of comfort, and 
the advantages of society, and appear contented with their situa- 
tion. They are, on the whole, intelligent, decent, sober, indus- 
trious, and well-behaved. 

Poaching in game, particularly in partridges and hares, prevails 
very much in this parish : and smuggling, which prevailed in former 
times to a great degree, has now been discontinued, through the 
vigilance of the Preventive Service, who are, in general, sober, quiet, 
and well-behaved, and set a good example to the parishioners. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — There are 1885 acres, imperial measure, in the 
parish, arable and in cultivation, and 1652 moss and moor, waste 
and uncultivated. A great part of the hills, particularly where 
granite quarries abound and have been opened, it would be im- 
possible ever to improve into cultivated land ; but the greater part 
of the presently unimproved ground may, at considerable expense 
of labour and money, be turned to good account. 

About thirty years ago, Mr Menzies portioned out a waste hill on 
his property, in different parts of five or six acres to different te- 
nants, on two nineteen years leases. The first nineteen years, they 
were to pay a small rent, which was to rise during the other nineteen, 
a small sum L. 10 being allowed them, to enable them to build a 
house and offices. The greater part of the hill, which was formerly 
waste, and worth little or nothing, is now in cultivation, and a village 
called Charlestown, containing nearly 200 inhabitants, is formed 
on the property. The people in general are poor, and not able 
to lay out much in improving their ground, otherwise it might 
be made more productive than it is. A considerable number of 
small farms of different sizes have been lately let on similar 
terms, and are now in progress of improvement. More than a 
hundred acres, which, a few years ago, were worth nothing, are 
now in cultivation, and bearing good crops. 

Mr Lewis Crombie, on a farm of North Loirston, belongmg to 
Dr Alexander Crombie, has improved, by trenching, draming, en- 
closing, and manuring, at a very great expense, thirty acres of the 
most barren untowardly ground that can well be supposed, and 
brought it to produce rich and abundant crops of gram, turnips, 
potatoes, and carrots, &amp;c. 



NIGG,

Mr James Ferguson, proprietor of Altens, which proper- 
ty he purchased only two years ago, has improved sixty acres of 
waste hands, and built new dwelling-houses, covered with slate, and 
new steadings to his tenants. 

Similar improvements have also of late years been made on 
South Loirston. 

Planting. There are about fifty or sixty acres of planting in 

the parish. The trees planted are chiefly Scotch firs, pines, 
larch, oak, beech, elms, planes, alders, &amp;c. In favourable situa- 
tions, where they are sheltered from the sea, they thrive tolerably 
well : in exposed situations, they fail. 

Rent. — The average rent of arable land per acre in the parish is 
about L. 4 or L. 4, 10s. per acre, — as on the lands of Tullos and 
Middleton, and in other places in the parish, which are cultivated 
by crofters, possessing from five to twelve acres each, the rent of 
which they principally pay by selling milk ; many of whom also have 
other means of livelihood, such as quarrying, and driving stones 
to Aberdeen. Some, in the upper part of the parish, cast and drive 
peats from the mosses to Aberdeen for sale. 

Some of the subtenants are poor, and unable to do much in 
improving their small patches of ground. But the other farmers 
in the parish, particularly on the river side, and on the sea-coast, 
are substantial, and some of them opulent, managing their farms 
in the most improved style. They follow a five rotation course of 
cropping. 

Mr Menzies's principal farm in this parish, Torry farm, which 
is mostly enclosed with substantial stone dikes, and in a high state 
of cultivation, is managed by an overseer ; as are also the lands of 
Balnagask and North Kirkhill, in the proprietor's own possession. 
Some of these lands are let annually in crop for potatoes, at the 
rate of from L. 10 to L. 14 per acre. And some of them are let, 
on a short lease, at the rate of L. 5, 5s. per acre. 

From the system pursued on these farms, little attention is paid 
to the rearing and improvement of cattle. The horses employed 
in agriculture by the substantial farmers are of the best kind. Fifty 
or sixty years ago, sheep were in great abundance in this parish ; 
but the new mode of agriculture has reduced their number. As 
the climate is mild, and snow seldom continues long on the ground, 
some shepherds come every winter from Strathdon and Perthshire, 
with flocks of sheep, which feed on the hills during winter, and re- 
turn home in the beginning of the lambing season.

Manure. — A manure commonly used by farmers in the neigh- 
bourhood of the Bay of Nigg, is sea-ware. It consists of green 
slake washed down the river, and of various marine plants, torn 
from the rocks by storms. It is brought to land in the Bay of 
Nigg, at the mouth of the river, and at the Bay of Grey- Hope, 
after a storm. The wind which blows from the land, and which 
would carry out to sea a substance floating on the surface, brings 
into the shore this substance swimming at the bottom, in a con- 
trary direction. Another manure used is street dung, which is pur- 
chased at Aberdeen, from 3s. to 5s. a load, according to the qua- 
lity. 

Substantial and convenient houses of stone and lime, and cover- 
ed with slate, are now built for the tenants, with excellent steadings 
of the same materials. Several of these were built on the lands of 
south and north Loirston some years ago. And Mr Ferguson is 
at present building houses of that description on his lands of Altens, 
and enclosing his fields with substantial stone dikes. 

Recent Improvements. — The principal improvements which have 
recently been made in this parish are the following: Between 
thirty and forty years ago, an Act of Parliament was procured 
for a turnpike road to the south, with a gradual ascent from 
the bridge of Dee, on the south-west part of this parish. And 
about five years ago, another turnpike road through the middle of 
the parish, for about three miles from north to south, was made. 
At the north extremity of it, a suspension bridge, which connects 
it with Aberdeen, was erected. The bridge and the road were 
made at the expense of the heritors, and cost about L. 10,000 
Sterling. A pontage is collected to pay, in part, the interest of 
that sum. There are several other cross roads in the parish, one 
particularly, which was made many years ago, from the old Bridge 
of Dee to the Bay of Nigg, and which is kept in repair from 
the commutation money. And last year, Mr Ferguson of Altens 
made, at his own expense, a new road for the benefit of his te- 
nants, extending from the middle turnpike to the sea-coast, above 
a mile. 

Quarries.— Theve is only one kind of quarries in the parish, viz. 
stone quarries. The stone of the mountains and sea-coast of this 
parish is a very hard granite. The stones are principally wrought 
for the London market for pavement, called causeway-stones. 
They are formed into oblong squares of a wedge-like form, 6 to 
12 inches long, 6 broad, and 9 deep. They are much better 



NIGG. 



207 



shaped and dressed than formerly. There are two separate de- 
partments in the business —that of the quarrier, who blocks out 
the materials, and that of the causeway-man, who dresses them. 
The latter, if a good hand, will make nearly double the wages of the 
former. When the quarries were first opened about seventy years 
ago, there were 600 or 700 men employed in them ; of late, the 
demand from London has in a great measure ceased, and most of 
the hands have left the parish, and gone to other places in quest 
of employment. 

Fisheries. There are two kinds of fisheries carried on in the 

parish, viz. salmon and white-fishing. Salmon-fishing is carried 
on in the river Dee, at the mouth of the river, in the Bay of Nigg, 
and along the coast. On the river, the salmon -fishing is still 
carried on, as in former times, by coble-nets; but at the mouth 
of the river, on the sea, and in the Bay of Nigg, and along the 
coast, by bag-nets. This is a modern invention, and is univer- 
sally used now in fishing for salmon on the sea-coast. Stake- 
nets and fly-nets are used on the sea-beach, and bag-nets in the 
inlets on the sea-coast. This mode of fishing has been carried 
on, only for a few years, in the Bay of Nigg. About fourteen 
years ago, a few partners got a lease of the salmon-fishing in the 
Bay of Nigg from the magistrates of Aberdeen, for twelve years, 
at the rent of L. 10 a-year for the first seven, and L. 20 a-year 
for the remaining five years of the lease. When the lease expir- 
ed, the liberty of fishing in the Bay of Nigg was again advertised 
to be let by public roup, and carried by the same partners at the 
astonishing yearly rent of L. 660 ; fourteen years before, this fish- 
ing was not worth a farthing. These partners have carried it on 
for two or three years on the new lease : not as formerly, by draw- 
ing their nets to land, as in coble-fishing, but by bag-nets, a mode 
which requires fewer hands, but more expensive materials. The 
same mode of fishing is now carried on at the Cove, at Altens, 
and other places in the parish, and considerable quantities of sal- 
mon are caught in these places, as well as in the Bay of Nigg. 

The salmon-fishings are very much encouraged by the quick 
conveyance of the fish in ice to the London market, by steam- 
boats. 

Some years ago, these fishings were much annoyed by seals in 
the Bay of Nigg. At last, one of the partners contrived a net for 
the purpose of catching seals, which has been found to answer. 
The plan of the seal-net is very simple. It nearly resembles the 



208 



KINCARDINESHIRE. 



net used in killing salmon, but is much less. A salmon, as a bait, 
is made fast in the bag of the net, and to the fish is fastened a 
cork, which floats on the surface. As soon as the seal catches 
hold of the fish, the cork instantly goes under water, which being 
observed from the shore, the door of the net is immediately closed 
by pulling a rope. The seal then becomes an easy prey, being 
confined in the net. 

The salmon-fishermen generally engage for a certain rate of 
wages per week, and according to the quantity of fish caught. 
Those who reside in this parish have, for the most part, a small 
piece of ground, which they cultivate at leisure hours ; others em- 
ploy themselves in different kinds of labour. 

Wliite-Jishing. — There are three fishing villages in this parish, 
viz. Torry, Cove, and Burnbank. The villages of Torry and 
Cove are inhabited by persons of different trades and occupations, 
as well as by fishermen. Burnbank is inhabited exclusively by the 
latter. In Torry, there are now fewer boats and fishermen than in 
former times : but there are still three boats, with six men to each. 
In the Cove, there were, in former times, only five boats ; now 
there are nine, with six men to each. In Burnbank there are 
three boats, with six men to each. 

The employment of the fishermen varies according to the season 
of the year. In January and May, haddocks are in season, and 
are taken not far from land. In this fishing there is often much 
annoyance from dog-fish, which destroy the lines, and even eat off 
the haddocks from the hooks. Fishing with the great line takes 
place in March and April. Cod, ling, turbot, &amp;c. are caught at 
the distance of several leagues from land. 

There is great difficulty in procuring bait for the white-fishing ; 
and mussels are brought for the purpose from Montrose and other 
places, at considerable expense : but now the mussel-beds or scalps, 
that have been formed in the spill water channel of the river Dee, 
will supply the neighbourhood with abundance of good bait, at a 
moderate rate. 

Saith fishing with rod and fly-hook forms an amusement in the 
summer to many, and considerable quantities of this small fish are 
taken, in this way, from the rocks at the sea-side and the mouth of 
the river. 

The fishermen in Torry carry haddocks and other fish directly 
to the Aberdeen market. But the fishermen of Cove and Burn- 
bank, after gutting, cleaning, splitting, salting, and then smoking 



NIGG.

Ihem with turf in a particular way, sell them in Aberdeen and 
other places as Finnan haddocks ; and they are equally good and 
as well cured as those of Finnan, and relished by many as a great 
delicacy. 

Herring Fishing.— In the middle of July, the herring fishery 
commences on the north coast. From Torry three boats proceed 
for the purpose; from Cove, nine; and from Burnbanks, three. 
The boats are from ten to fourteen tons burden, and fitted up with 
masts, sails, cordage, and nets, at considerable expense. They 
carry each five or six men, partners in the adventure. Each boat 
is under an engagement to some merchant, to furnish a certain 
number of cranes or barrels of herring, perhaps 250. Last year, 
they were very unsuccessful. Indeed, the herring fishing, upon 
the whole, has been an unprofitable concern for the fishermen. 
They are generally absent at the Norlh-Sea-fishing, for six weeks 
or two months. 

Shell-Fish. — Lobster and crab are fished at Cove and Burn- 
banks : and the method of catching them is by a cylindrical bas- 
ket or creel, with a small hole in it for entrance, so constructed 
that the fish enters in and cannot get out again. In this, they 
place a bait and sink it in the sea, at a little distance from the 
rocks. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce is as fol- 
lows, viz : 

1. Produce of grain, oats, and barley, . L. 4022 0 0 

2. Turnips, . . . 1682 0 0 
.3. Potatoes, . . . . 560 0 0 

4. First year's grass, . • . 1780 0 0 

5. Pasture grass, . , . 712 0 0 

L. 8756 0 0 

About two-thirds of the turnip crop raised in the parish is con- 
sumed at home, for the purpose of procuring dairy produce, which, 
meets with a tolerable demand in Aberdeen. The other third is 
carried to the same place, and sold to cowfeeders at about a third 
more price, as a compensation for the carriage. 

Manufactures. — Some years ago kelp was manufactured in the 
bay of Nigg, and gave employment to a good many young women, 
but for many years past it has been discontinued, there being no 
demand for it. There was also, several years ago, a salt manu- 
factory in the bay of Nigg, but it also has been given up. Lint 
was formerly sown and manufactured by private faniilies in the [la- 
rish ; now there is no manufacture of the kind.

V. — Pauociiial Economy. 
Market-Town Sc. — The nearest market-town is Aberdeen. 
There are two bridges over the river Dee, in this parish, viz. the 
old Bridge of Dee, of seven arches, built by Bishop Dunbar, three 
hundred years ago, and a suspension- bridge about a mile below, 
nearer Aberdeen, called Wellington Bridge, erected in 1829 at 
the sole expense of the heritors. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The old church which was situated in the 
north-east extremity of the parish having fallen into decay, a new 
one was erected by the heritors in a centrical situation, in the year 
1829, the distance of which from any part of the parish is not 
more than two miles and a half. It is a handsome church, wiih a 
square tower for a bell and clock, built on an eminence, and seen 
at a great distance. It cost L. 1800. The Crown is palron. It 
affords accommodation for 900 sitters, — a larger number than 
usually resorts to it. It was built with a view to the increased po- 
pulation of the parish, which it was supposed would take place in 
consequence of the suspension-bridge across the Dee ; but that in- 
crease of population has not yet been so great as was expected. 

The imnse was built in 1759. It has frequently been repair- 
ed and enlarged. It is two miles from the new church. 

The extent of the present glebe is about ten acres of ground, as 
good as any in the parish, and of the value of L. 5 per acre. Some 
acres of the glebe being marshy, and often covered with water, 
were drained and very much improved, at considerable expense, 
by my predecessor, Dr Cruden, who lived for forty years after, to 
enjoy the profit of his improvements, and left the glebe in a high 
state of cultivation to his successor. The stipend being one of 
the small livings of the church, is made up to L. 150 by the aug- 
mentation of L. 67, 16s. 6d. yearly from the Exchequer. 

There are no chapels of ease, nor any Dissenting meeting-houses 
in this parish, and very few Dissenters of any kind. Divine ser- 
vice at the Established Church is generally well attended. The 
average number of communicants is 600. 

There are not more than two or three Dissenting families in the 
parish. 

Education.— Thiive are four schools in the parish.— 1. Paro- 
chial school. The schoolmaster has the medium salary, a pretty 
good house, and small garden. Amount of school fees about L.20 : 
emolument from session clerk's fees and perquisites, L. 6.-2. 
School at Cove. The schoolmaster has a small house and gar- 



211 



len, with a small salary arising from the interest of money be- 
queathed by Dr Cruden and others, amounting to about L. G ]er 
annimi, besides school-fees, amounting to about L. 15 per annum. 
— 3. School at Charlestown. The schoolmaster has a small house 
and garden, with school-fees amounting to about L. 12. For two 
years past, he has received each year L. 5, a donation from the 
Trustees of the late Mr Donaldson; but it is uncertain whether 
or not this will be continued. — 4. There is another school in Ter- 
ry. The schoolmaster has no free school-bouse, and no salary. 
He depends for his living upon the small school-fees. 

A few scholars are taught to read, by women, without any sa- 
lary ; one in Torry, and another in Cove. 

There are very few persons betwixt six and fifteen years of age, 
or above it, that cannot read or write. The people in general are 
alive to the benefits of education ; but among the white-fishermen 
and others, there are some so poor as to be unable, however wil- 
ling, to give their children the necessary education. The session 
pay for some poor scholars, from the interest of small sums be- 
queathed for that purpose, and recommend others to be taught 
gratis, which is readily done by all the teachers. 

There is no part of the parish so distant from school as to pre- 
vent attendance of the children. Those in the Bridge of Dee 
and Legart district have to go more than two miles to Jny school 
in the parish, and a school there would be of very great service. 

Friendly Societies.— The Friendly Societies in Torry and the 
Cove, began in the year 1772, it was found necessary, some years 
ago, with the consent of all parties concerned, to dissolve. There 
are still two deposit Societies at the Cove. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is 57 : the average allowance per annum 
a httle more than L.l, 10s. Average amount of collections at 
the church for the poor, L.53, 19s.; donations, penalties, mort- 
cloths, &amp;c. L.33, Os. 3d.,- interest of money left, L 29 13s 5d 
The average expenses are L.ll, 12s. viz., for the session-clerk'« 
tee, the precentor's and officer's salary, &amp;c. 

Mr James Calder, late merchant in Aberdeen, gave L.500 to 
the poor of the parish. Some of the heritors give an annual do- 
nation for the same purpose; and several sums have been be- 
queathed by others. 

Inns end Public- Houses.-There are about ten or twelve pub- 
he- houses in the parish, one-half of which would be sufficient.

Fuel— Vents and turf are used a good deal in country houses, 
and by the white-fishermen in Cove and Burnbanks for smoking 
and curing Finnan haddocks ; the turf being procured from the 
mosses belonging to Mr Menzies and others, in the upper part of 
the parish, and in Nether Banchory. But many use coals', par- 
ticularly in Torry and neighbourhood.

PRESBYTERY OF FORDOUN, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER IRVINE, MINISTER. 



I. Topography and Natural History 

TsTfljne.— DuNNOTTAR, anciently spelt Dunotyr, is sa"id to be a 
compound Gaelic word signifying a place of strevgth on a penin- 
sular promontory. Such was the Castle of Dunnottar, withm the 
walls of which formerly stood the parish church. 

Extent, cc.--The area of the parish is an irregular three-sided 
figure. The eastern side runs from Stonehaven, southward along 
the coast, to and inclusive of the fishing village of Crawton, a dis- 
tance of about five miles. From Crawton, the boundary runs 
about five miles north-westward, in a zig-zag line, abutting first on 
the parish of Kinneflf, and then on the parish of Glenbervie, pas- 
sino- with the latter over Carmount moor, to the summit of Car- 
mount hill, and thence descending into Carron Water, at the 
base of that hill, where Dunnottar and Glenbervie are met by 
the parish of Fetteresso. On the northern side, the Carron, wmd- 
ino- a course of about five miles, from where it leaves the ternto.y 
ofGlenbervie, till it enters the sea at Stonehaven, forms, with 
some small exceptions, the boundary with Fetteresso. According 
to a map of Kincardineshire, by Mr Francis Garden, in 1744, the 
parish contains 8156 « English acres," or nearly 13 square miles. 

roponraphical Jppearances.-The seaward boundary of this 
parish is a continuous chain of rocks, consisting partly ofdetachea 
Lsses and bluf[- headlands, but chiefly of a range of clifts rising 

• Draw., up ly I'etur Christian, Esq. Writer, Sto.ehaven. 



DUNNOTTAR.

perpendicularly, from 150 to between 200 and 300 feet out of the 
deep water washing their base. The height of the cliffs, the 
.fantastic forms of the huge insulated masses, and the great 
disruption appearing throughout, have rendered the Dunnot- 
tar shore one of the most romantic on the' east coast, as it is to 
the land-locked mariner, in easterly storms, one of the most hope- 
less. Its inhospitable aspect is here and there softened by reced- 
ing coves or little bays, accessible from the land by grassy slopes, 
but fenced by sunken rocks against approach from the sea. In 
several places, large caverns are hollowed in the cliffs, most of 
them terminating under ground, but some passing from side to 
side of projecting rocks. Of these, a remarkable one, named the 
Long Gallery, runs under a high promontory, from one bay to 
another, a distance of more than 150 yards. This singular ca- 
vern, or marine arcade, formed in the solid rock, admits the pas- 
sage of an ordinary sized boat, and the navigation of it is seldom 
omitted by boatmen conducting parties of pleasure. South of this, 
about a mile of uninterrupted cliff, the very highest of all the 
range, has the name of Foiohheugh, well known as the hatching 
place of myriads of sea-fowl of various description,|whose nests oc- 
cupy and whiten the whole face of that extensive portion of the 
rock. The privilege of taking eggs and birds from this place is 
let to a tenant, who, for the purpose of collecting them, suffers 
himself to be lowered by a rope from 



-the dreadful summit of the cliff, 



That beetles o"er his base into the sea." 

From this dangerous employment no accident is known to have ever 
happened, although a few years ago, the malicious act of cutting 
the rope nearly through, was perpetrated over night, but discover- 
ed in the morning just in time to save the climber from destruc- 
tion. From the height of the coast, and the ascent of the land 
towards the interior, the area of the parish is, generally speakino-, 
of considerable altitude. Of the cultivated land the more elevat' 
ed part is towards the south and west. In that quarter, the ascent 
is gradual from the sea cliff to the moor of Carmount, a level 
heath of between 400 and 500 acres. At the further extremity 
of that waste, Carmount hill rises probably 800 feet above the 
level of the sea. Again, from the sea-coast, a short way north of 
Crawton vdlage, the land, in its ascent, assumes the shape of suc- 
cessive ridges or knolls, which, sweeping north - westward for aboi t 
three miles, fall in with the low hills of GJaslaw and Toucks • and 



214 



KINCAUDINESHIIIE. 



these continuing the sweep to the bank of the Carron, are follow- 
ed on the other side of that stream by corresponding eminences in 
the parish of Fetteresso, wliich again sweep round to the Garron, 
the north headland of Stonehaven bay. In this manner, are em- 
bosomed, in the two parishes, eight or nine square miles of highly 
cultivated land, sloping towards the centre, and embellished with 
plantations, gentlemen's seats, and cheerful villas. On a plane 
nearly on a level with the sea, and intersected by the Carron and 
the Cowie, stands the town of old and new Stonehaven, where 
these streams unite and fall into the ocean. The scene thus im- 
perfectly described comprehends the venerable ruins of Dunnot- 
tar Castle, the two parish churches with their manses, and other 
picturesque objects, and forms with the wide and deeply indented 
bay of Stonehaven, its bold headlands of Downie and Garron, 
and its margin of pebbly beach, along which the town ranges, an 
attractive and generally admired landscape. On the further side 
of the hill of Toucks, lies the district of Auquhirie, sloping to- 
wards the Carron, and forming with the Brae of Fetteresso, an- 
other valley well cultivated and diversified with neat farms and ex- 
tensive plantations. The only other topographical appearance 
proper to be noticed, is a deep ravine cutting the high bank of 
the Carron, close by Stonehaven. This is the outlet of a hollow 
which divides the parish from -south to north, corresponding with 
and forming the northern extremity of the valley of Strathmore. 

Climate.— From proximity to the coast, Dunnottar, in common 
with similar localities, is exempt from very rigorous winters, but is 
subject in spring to fogs and gales from the sea, which frequently

Hijdrography. — No spring sensibly impregnated with any mi- 
neral has been discovered in Dunnottar. Several little burns have 
their sources in the parish, and most of them are tributary to the 
Carron. The chief of these is the Bum ofGlaslaw, issuing from 
the den or ravine already noticed as the termination of Strathmore. 
Its junction with the larger stream gives the name of Invercarron 
to a part of the territory of Stonehaven. The Carron, from its 
rise in the parish of Glenbervie, runs a course of only eight or 
nine miles. In times of protracted drought, its whole stream, un- 
collected, would hardly suffice to turn a corn mill, but in floods it 
assumes the appearance of a large and rapid river, destructively 
overflowing its banks, and occasionally inundating the streets ot 
Stonehaven. Running water has not yet, in this parish, been ap- 
plied as the moving power of machinery of any importance, but 
there are situations in which it is considered it might be used 
with advantage for manufactories. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The sea coast, all the way from 
Stonehaven to near Crawton, is formed of the rock termed plum- 
pudding, having a strong compacting cement. In exposed sur- 
faces, the cement has yielded to atmospheric action, and exterior 
boulders being displaced, leave cavities which, in precipices, the 
sea- fowl appropriate for their nests. On the surface of a ledge of 
rock at Crawton, a small portion of columnar basalt appears, and 
throughout the parish, large boulders of granite and of gneiss are 
not uncommon. In a moor above Fowlsheugh, stones have occa- 
sionally been quarried from what is said to be one of the trap for- 
mations, and in the moor of Carmount, a stratum of what is un- 
derstood to be porphyritic granite afl'ords useful stones for rubble 
building. But, apart from the coast, the prevailing strata of rock 
are of coarse brown sandstone. Indeed, at the harbour of Stone- 
haven, the cliff' changes to a stratum of that formation, which, un- 
der a deep covering of red clay, appears to run in a southerly di- 
rection, and probably all along bounds the plumpudding rock at no 
great distance from the sea. In the bottom of that harbour, there 
is a stratum of pipe-clay, but neither limestone nor marl has been 
discovered in this parish. 

.VoiV.— Dunnottar possesses the usual diversity of clayey, loamy, 
gravelly or sandy, and moorland soils. They are not distinguish- 
ed by any peculiar local arrangement, the varieties occurring m all 
parts of the parish, often, indeed, on one farm and in one field; for 
although clayey soils, more or less friable, and black or hazelly 



DUNNOTTAR. 



loam, more or less deep and cohesive, prevail near the coast, yet 
even there a thin covering of moorland soil, or the lightest sandy 
soils, may be seen under tillage, while in the more inland parts, 
where generally the soil is light, clay and loam, comparatively fer- 
tile, are not unusual. No calcareous earth, unless what is adven- 
titious, forms a component in any of the soils, the sand and gravel 
which they contain being what is commonly understood as siliceous. 
In many instances, the subsoil is the indurated combination of clay 
and gravel known by the name of till, and this more commonly 
where the supersoil is scanty, or a recent conversion of moorland 
earth. Some of the clayey soils, from long melioration, are of 
considerable fertility, but instances of clay soils incumbent on sand 
or open gravel, are very rare; and consequently lately cultivated 
clays are for the most part of difRcult and precarious management. 

Zoology. — In the recollection of persons not yet very old, seals 
were numerous on the coast of Dunnottar. They were then to 
be seen in herds, basking on the rocks or sporting in the bays, and 
the hunting of them in the caves was practised both for amuse- 
ment and profit. Now, they have nearly abandoned the caves to 
which they resorted as their breeding- places, and only a solitary 
one is to be seen occasionally, skulking for prey at the foot of the 
rock. The fox and the foumarte have both become rare in this 
parish, and the peaceable brock and harmless urchin are seldom 
met with. The otter's cry is hardly ever heard, affording as it was 
wont a foreboding to the superstitious. The whitteret or weasel 
still frisks about the stack-yard, and the Norway rat overruns the 
land, having, however, nearly exterminated the race of his black 
brother. What are said to be wild-cats are occasionally found in 
solitary places, but there is reason to doubt whether they are not 
merely such as have escaped from a state of domestication. Herds 
of roe-deer are to be seen in the woods, or, in the pinch of winter, 
visiting the turnip fields, and even the stack- yards. Hares are nu- 
merous, and the whole country is grievously infested with rabbits, 
from a colony planted in this parish five and twenty years ago, be- 
fore which period that animal in a wild state was unknown in this 
quarter. 

In the feathered race, the numbers and variety of birds inhabit- 
ing or frequenting the rocks and-caverns of the sea coast, form the 
chief object of attention. The common gull has appropriated 
to himself a district of the cliff where he nestles to the exclusion 
of all others. The kittivvake or tarrock is migratory, arriving in

KINCARDINESHIRE. 



spring, and taking its departure early in autumn. Its nests occu- 
py nearly a mile of cliff, but are intermixed witb the nests of se- 
veral varieties of the germs Colymlms, as the marrot or foolish 
guillemot, the norie or puffin, and three or four others. Besides 
the myriads nf sea-fowl in these rocks and caverns, several land- 
birds breed there, as the stock-dove, raven, jackdaw, sparrowhawk, 
and gentil falcon or gamehawk. Of the latter, it is said more than 
one pair is never observed in one season. The parish abounds in 
partridges ; and wild-duck, teal, and snipes, are by no means rare. 
There are a few pheasants, and in their seasons, landrails and wood- 
cocks. Occasionally, a covey or two of red grouse are produced 
in Carmount Hill, and blackcock has been seen in the woods, but 
not probably bred there. Cushats or ring doves are very numerous, 
although not so much so as before the late severe winters. Be- 
sides the howlet and barn-owl, a beautiful, and, it is believed, rare 
variety of this genus, is found amond the rocks of the sea coast. 
Its solemn broad face has a short and erect covering resembling 
hair, encompassed by white silky down disposed in the form of a 
narrow ring. The belly is of pure white, and the back a cinna- 
mon colour, mottled with bright spots and with longitudinal stripes 
of a darker tinge. It is believed neither the carrion nor the hooded- 
crow breeds in Dunnottar ; nor has the rook ever yet built in it, 
but a large rookery at Fetteresso Castle, on the border of this pa- 
rish, sends forth visitors in sufficient numbers to all the neighbour- 
hood. Magpies do not abound here of late, having, as well as 
other birds of prey, suffered under the proscription of game pre ■ 
servers. Since the formation of plantations, there has been a great 
increase in the number and variety of singing-birds, and between 
the extremes from the thrush to the wren, more than a dozen of 
different species are to he found, all common to this part of the 
country, and therefore not necessary to be particularized. 

£otony.— In the inland part of the parish, the botany affords 
nothing worthy of remark ; but the sea-coast, abounding in shel- 
tered coves of rich soil, presents a varied and luxuriant vegetation. 
Perhaps in no district is there a greater number of species in so 
small a space, though no one is known as peculiar to this locality, 
or even very rare. Among the most remarkable, may be noticed 
narrow-leaved blysmus, Scottish lovage, sea-lungwort, cowslip, 
bittersweet, scarlet pimpernel, perwinkle, white saxifrage, agn-

moiiy, marjoram, sea-rocket, wood-vetch, common carline, sea 
feverfew. Several species of rather rare carices are also to be 
met with as, Carex distnns, C. inciirva, C. intermedia, C. vulpina, 
and otliers. Wallflower grows abundantly on the ruins of Dun- 
nottar Castle, and in the neighbouring rocks, undoubtedly wild. 
Henbane, a plant very rare in the north, if it be indeed indigenous, 
is stated in the Northern Flora to be " plentiful near the Whigs' 
vault," in the castle, but, from its being confined to a spot o[ pecu- 
liar soil, it may be doubted whether it is to be considered a native. 
Oxlip primrose {Primula elatior occurs sparingly, A variety has 
been found, having the corolla red with a yellow eye, very similar 
to some varieties of the garden polyanthus. 

Planfations. — In Dunnottar, extensive plantations, chiefly on the 
estate of General Forbes, comprehend all the common varieties of 
hard-wooded trees, and trees of the pine and fir tribe. The 
greater part is of sixty, and very little under thirty, years growth. 
In general, these plantations have succeeded well, the exception 
applying principally to Scotch firs in situations where there is a de- 
ficiency of soil and an excess of moisture. In more favourable 
situations, good timber is produced, and this more particularly 
around Dunnottar House, where, notwithstanding its adjacency to 
the sea, ash, elm, beech, oak, and other hard-wooded trees, spruce, 
larch, and Scotch fir, are healthy and thriving. On the land of 
Auquhirie, in the western district, the soil seems peculiarly favour- 
able to the growth of oak, ash, and beech. Some old trees of the 
latter sort at the house of Aurjuhirie have attained a great size ; 
and several of them yet in exuberant foliage, which were uptorn 
by the hurricane in October 1838, showed marks of the growth 
of more than 100 years. It is to be regretted, that the rearing of 
oak had not met with more attention, as much of the ground oc- 
cupied by firs has proved more adapted to the growth of that va- 
luable timber.

edifices, the ruins of Dunnottar Castle hold a prominent place. 
They occupy an area of between four and five acres on the top 
of a precipitous rock, separated by a deep chasm from the main- 
land, and almost surrounded by the sea. The great tower, still 
nearly entire, and the ranges of buildings adapted to the vari- 
ous purposes of a garrisoned place, present, in their majestic posi- 
tion and bold and varied sutline, an object at once grand and pic- 
turesque. Nor is less interest derived from an examination of 
the interior, where, shut in by a portcuUised gateway, and secur- 
ed at every assailable point by walls and ramparts, are to be seen, 
suffering less from time than from the hand of the spoiler, the 
halls and chambers, now roofless and deserted, which once were 
animated by the pomp and circumstance of war, and all the 
splendour of baronial greatness. It is stated in the last Statis- 
tical Account, that there were in the custody of the late Mr Keith 
of Ravelston, and doubtless there now are in the possession of his 
grandniece. Lady Keith-Murray, to whom the ruins belong, some 
old papers establishing that, during the contest between the parties 
of Bruce and Baliol, a fortress was built on this rock by an an- 
cestor of the family of Marischal, who acquired the right, on the 
condition of his erecting, in a more convenient situation, a parish 
church in lieu of that which formerly stood there. Another ac- 
count is, that a Sir William Keith suffered excommunication for 
having built the castle on consecrated ground, and that, by a bull 
from Rome in 1394, his excommunication was removed, on con- 
dition of his building a new church, and making recompense to 
the clergy. It is certain, however, that Dunnottar Castle was in 
existence long before 1394; and that it had existed even before 
the contest between Bruce and Baliol, is to be inferred from the 
fact mentioned by Buchanan, that when at the commencement of 
that contest, Wallace had assumed the Regency, Dunnottar, " suf- 
ficiently manned and fortified," was one of the fortresses then held 
by the English, which were reduced by him. " By an unexpect- 
ed assault says the historian he carried Dunnottar castle, which 
he garrisoned." This, it is believed, is the earliest historical 
notice of the castle ; and while it seems to establish that it was 
then not a recent erection, it leaves the origin of it in obscurity, 
from which, probably, it will never be extricated. There is indeed 
a tradition that the great tower, in appearance the oldest of all the 
buildings, was the work of the Picts. In this, there is at least no 
improbability, for although dismantled, and left to all the influ-

ence of the elements, for now more than 100 years, it has yet suf- 
fered wonderfully little dilapidation, and its strength and durabi- 
lity having been such that it has so well withstood decay since the 
days of Wallace, it may well enough be conceived that it had ex- 
isted for ages before his time. This castle was one of the more 
considerable of the fortresses of Scotland, and is supposed to have 
been, before the use of artillery, altogether impregnable. So late 
as 1651, it held out, with but " a scanty garrison," for the period 
of six months, against a body of Cromwell's troops, and it was 
only after the siege had been turned into a blockade, and when 
pressed by famine and mutiny, that Ogilvy, the governor, was in- 
duced to capitulate. In former times, it had frequently changed 
hands, by what means does not particularly appear, unless that, 
when it was carried by Wallace, it is said to have been by surprise. 
To this day, the name of Wallace is attached to an aperture near 
the great tower, through which he himself is said to have gained 
the interior, and by that means opened the gate to his followers. 
The family of Marischal is understood to have taken its rise from 
a well known incident — the slaying of the Danish General Comus, 
by a young nobleman of the name of Keith, whom the second 
King Malcolm rewarded for his valour, by bestowing upon him 
certain lands in Lothian, with the title of Great Marischal of Scot- 
land. The date of that event is the year lOVO ; and subsequently, 
but at what particular period does not appear, the castle with the 
whole parish of Dunnottar came into possession of the Marischal 
family. By the accession of George, the last Earl Marischal, to 
the rebellion of 1715, the title and extensive estates of the family 
were forfeited, and the castle, which, about thirty years before had 
been purchased by government, was completely dismantled. The 
placing of the Regalia of Scotland in Dunnottar castle during the 
Commonwealth, and their having, before the castle was surrendered 
to Cromwell's General, been conveyed away and secreted under the 
intrepid and ingenious management. of Mrs Ogilvy, the governor's 
lady, and Mra Granger, the wife of the parson of Kinneff, are facts 
too generally known to require particular mentioii. Neither, as it is 
matter detailed in history, is it necessary to do more than al'lude to 
the imprisonment here, in 1 685, of the Covenanters, who, to the num- 
ber of 167 men, women, and children, were confined in one dun 
geon, still known by the name of the Whigs' vault, where they suf- 
fered the greatest tortures under Keith of Whiterigs, at that time 
governor of the castle. In the church-yard of the parish, a plain

Stone records the names of nine of these persons, " who as the 
epitaph runs "a/Z died prisoners in Dunnottar Castle, anno 1685, 
for their adherence to the word of God and Scotland's covenant- 
ed loorh of Reformation" It was while employed in his habitual 
task of clearino; the simple but expressive inscription of this mo- 
nument, that " Old Mortality" was first seen by Sir Walter Scott, 
then on a visit to the late Mr Walker, minister of the parish. On 
that occasion, a circumstance occurred which has some resem- 
blance to an incident in "the Antiquary." Sir Walter had pro- 
posed and superintended an exploration of the large but dilapidat- 
ed well in Dunnottar Castle, in the bottom of which, accord- 
ino- to tradition, was buried the family plate of the Earl Marischal. 
On the second day of a laborious search, an ancient vessel was 
found among the stones and rubbish, M'hich, it was not doubted, 
was a part of the hidden treasure ; but, after an anxious examina- 
tion of it, much amusement was occasioned by one of the party 
confessing that it was an old brass tea kettle which he had found 
means to have thrown into the well the previous night. A roof- 
less building in the church-yard, having the name of the Maris- 
chal Aisle, had at one time been the family sepulchre. In an 
underground vault, are fragments of leaden coffins, and small boxes 
of the same material, containing no doubt the relics of some of the 
once noblest of the knd, but, sic transit gloria mundi, neither in- 
scription nor tradition now tells their history, or even their names. 
The only other noticeable matters of antiquity in the parish are two 
tombstones, which lay on what was formerly a piece of waste 
ground close by the town of Stonehaven, and were lately taken up 
and erected near the spot. They covered the graves of persons 
who, it is understood, died of the plague. One of them, on which 
the word " Pest'' is still legible, bears to have been in memory of 
« Macrnus Tailliour," who died in 1608, and the other is dedicat- 
ed to the memory of two children, " an honest man's bairns," of 
the name of Brockie, who died in 1648. It would appear from 
these monuments, as well as from the tradition connected with 
them, that the plague had visited this parish at these two pe- 
riods. . 

Modern Buildings.— The only gentleman's seat m the parish, is 
Dunnottar House, now the property of General Forbes. Its erec- 
tion was begun forty years ago by Alexander Allardyce, Esq. who, 

• The late Francis Logie, Esq.

having realized a large fortune in Jamaica, had purchased of the 
creditors of the York Buildings Company, the greater part of the 
Marischal estate in this parish. It is a plain, but extensive and 
commodious building, embosomed in plantations formed by Mr Al- 
lardyce. In forming the gardens attached to it, upwards of 
L. 10,000 are said to have been expended. The unpretending 
mansion of the Ogilvies of Barras, whose ancestor, for his gallant 
defence of Dunnottar Castle, and the preservation of the regalia, 
had the unsubstantial reward of a baronetcy, was once to have 
been numbered among the buildings of note in this parish, but it 
has long ceased to be the residence of that family, and is now used 
as an ordinary farm-house. — In the town of Stonehaven are the 
county buildings, containing a spacious hall, appropriately fitted 
up as a court room, with committee rooms, and offices for the 
sheriff-clerk, and on the basement are cells for prisoners, with a 
gaoler's house. Some late additions have greatly improved the 
appearance of these buildings; but the huge precipitous roof of the 
, main building is a deformity which still remains to be remedied. 
About fifty years ago, the magistrates of Stonehaven, with the sav- 
ings of their " common good," erected a square tower with a spire ; 
but it is to be regretted that this expenditure was made to effect 
nothing more than accommodation for the town clock. The other 
public buildings in the town are an Episcopal chapel, in the form 
of a cross, built, it is believed, early in the eighteenth century, and 
a Methodist chapel, erected a few years ago, in the humble style 
of such buildings. As a quasi public building, the " Mill Inn" 
deserves notice. It has lately been altered and improved so as 
now to add greatly to the appearance of the place, and to the ac- 
commodation of travellers. 

III. — PoPaLATION. 

Although in the course of the last sixty-eight years, the popu- 
lation of the parish underwent some fluctuations, it is nearly the 
same now as it was at the commencement of that period. Thus 
in 1772, the number of inhabitants was 1862, and by the census 
in 1831, the number was 1852. The division into town and rural 
population at each of these dates was as follows : 

In 1772, town, 923, rural, 939 total, 1862 
1831, do. 941, do. 911, do. 152 

The number of males in 1831 was less than the number of fe- 
males in both localities. Thus there were at that time

Males in the country, . 44'i 

Females in do. . 469

1852 

In the period since 1772, the greatest amount of population oc- 
curred in 1792, when it reached to 1963, of which, 1072 belonged 
to the town. In the country, the numbers have not at any time 
greatly varied, and it might seem singular, that in the seaport of 
Stonehaven, the population since 1792 has apparently decreased. 
But this admits of explanation. The ground within the bounds 
of the burgh, which is the Dunnottar part of the town, having 
been nearly all occupied, building between fifty and sixty years 
ao-o began to extend to the north side of the Carron, in the ad- 
joining parish of Fetteresso, where a new town was planned, and 
feu-rights granted, by Mr Barclay of Ury, on his lands of Ardu- 
thie. In this way, Stonehaven had increased so as to contam in 
both parishes, according to the census of 1831, a population of up- 
wards of 3000, being more than triple the town population of 1772. 
It is supposed a farther increase has taken place since the date of 
thatcensus. The average annual number of marriages in Dunnot- 
tar is 14, and of births 34. There are five insane persons main- 
tained at the expense of the parish, and there is one deaf and 
dumb person, a young man, educated at the asylum in Aberdeen, 
who is industrious and intelligent, and aifords a gratifying exam- 
ple of the important benefits flowing from such institutions. Each 
of the land-owners of the parish possesses property greatlv exceed- 
ina in revenue the sum of L.50. Not one of them is resident. No 
feuar in the Dunnottar quarter of Stonehaven has a rental of that 
amount. The people in general are attentive to their religious 
and moral duties. Indulgence in the use of intoxicating hquors 
is fast disappearing. 

IV. — Industry. 
Aoriculturc.-The cultivated land in Dunnottar amounts to 
about 4860 imperial acres. About 690 acres are in wood ; and 

. By the census of 1841, the population of Dunnottar parish is

of the remaining portion of the area of the parish, about 1740 acres 
consist of tracks of moorland, or patches of natural pasture, in- 
terspersed among farms. Of these 1740 acres, about one-half may 
be considered capable of being cultivated. 

Rent. — The average rent of arable land is about L. I, 7s. the 
imperial acre, the range being from 15s. to L.3, 3s., with the ex- 
ception of some land near Stonehaven, which, enhanced by its lo- 
cality, rents as high as from L. 10 to L.16 per acre. In a few in- 
stances, rent is made dependent on the fiars prices of grain, fluctu- 
ating annually as these prices rise or fall, a mode of adjustment 
which may inconveniently atfect the tenant, as it may happen, from 
deficiency of crops in bad seasons, that his rent is in an inverse ra- 
tio to the amount of his receipts at market. 

Leases. — The usual term of leases is nineteen years. In some 
instances, a shorter term is conditioned, but in no case is a lease 
for a longer period now granted. Formerly, when, instead of the 
present great demand and competition for farms, it was difficult to 
find tenants, leases on lives, or for two or three times nineteen 
years were very common. Of such leases only one now remains in 
this parish, which was granted in 1784, upon a life still surviving. 
Live-stock. — Sheep farming is not practised in Dunnottar. Of 
late, some attention has been paid to the breed of farm-horses and 
cattle. The former are of middhng size, active and hardy. They 
have been improvedby crosses from stallions of the Suffolk, Clydes- 
dale, and other approved breeds, but the original defects in the blood 
of the mares have not yet been eradicated. The cattle are chiefly 
of the black polled breed. The average weight of oxen reared 
and fed in the parish may be about fifty stones imperial, but feeding 
is not practised here very extensivelyj most of the tenants selling 
their stock when two years old, off" the grass, or from the straw- 
yard. Pigs, not long ago to be found only at corn-mills, are now 
reared and fed in considerable numbers by the farmers and cotta- 
gers. They are in general of the improved short nosed-breed, and 
the pork is cured chiefly for the London market. 

Husbandry. — A complete reformation of the practice of agri- 
culture in this parish followed the great improvements introduced 
and accompHshed on his estate by the late Mr Barclay of Ury.f 

It may he noticed as a curious fact, that, in this case, the tenant, when the lease 
was granted, had a family of eight healthy children, and that the only survivor now 
was the fourth child, on whose life the lease was taken. 

+ An interesting account .of Mr Barclay's improvements is to be found in Robert, 
son s Agricultural Reiort of Kincardin shire.

Under the salutary, and in this quarter all-pervading influence of 
his example, the alternate " butt and baulk," and the serpentine j, 
ridge disappeared ; land was cleaned, drained, and limed ; regu- 
lar fields were formed : artificial grasses and turnips were intro- 
duced, and the system of convertible husbandry finally banished 
the antiquated and rude management by " outfield and infield." 
After this, the rotation for some time observed was one of six years, 
including two years of grass and two grain crops in succession ; but 
this having in most cases been found deteriorating to the soil, the 
management was gradually changed to a rotation of five years, admit- 
ting but one grain crop, after two years of grass ; or to a rotation of 
seven years, under which two successive grain crops are permitted, 
but the severity of them modified by a previous rest of three years in 
grass. These are the rotations now in general use, unless where a 
rotation of four years has been introduced, as supposed better suited 
to some peculiar soils. In this way, within the last sixty years, the 
greater part of the land in Dunnottar has, from the worst mode of 
management, and comparative sterility, been advanced to a pitch 
of improvement, not inferior to that of any district in this part of 
the country. Hardly any farm in the parish is now without a 
thrashing-mill, moved either by water or animal power, and one 
spirited tenant in it has lately attached a steam-engine to his 
thrashing-machine. 

Quarries.— la this parish, the only quarry of noticeable extent 
is in the sandstone cliff above the harbour of Stonehaven, which 
has been wrought for a great many years, and has furnished stones 
for the greater number of the houses in that town. It has the name 
of the Redcraig, and from a part of it called Sclatecowes, a lump- 
ish sort of flag was formerly taken, and used for the purpose of 
slate. With these some of the primitive houses in the town are 
still covered. 

Fishings.— There is no salmon fishing in Dunnottar, although 
it is thought some of its headlands admit of the lately introduced 
mode of fishing with bag-nets. White fishing in the sea is the sole 
occupation of the villagers of Crawton, and it is carried on by the 
crews of five or six boats at Stonehaven. The parish is thus well 
and cheaply supplied with various kinds of fish, as haddock, whit- 
■ ing, cod, ling, skate, halibut, flounders, and occasionally turbot. 
Lobsters and crabs are caught in abundance, and of excellent qua- 
lity. Herring-fishing is now prosecuted with enterprise at Stone- 
haven, where curing establishments have been formed ; and the 



DUNNOTTAU. 



227 



position on the coast which the harbour occupies is so favourable, 
the access to it is so easy, and its internal accommodation so con- 
venient for the purpose, that it is likely to become prominent as a 
station in the herring-fishery. 

Manufactures. — Cotton and linen weaving is carried on pretty 
extensively at Stonehaven, under the agents of several houses at 
Aberdeen. A good many females find employment in this way, 
and of the men so employed in the winter time, some become 
fishermen in summer, particularly during the herring season. The 
manufacture of coal gas was lately commenced at Stonehaven by 
a joint-stock Company, with a capital of L. 2500. The works, 
though on a limited scale, are very complete ; and the gas produ- 
ced is of the best quality, and is now used in lighting almost every 
shop and dwelling-house in both old and new towq. Some ma- 
nufactures are carried on in the Fetteresso quarter of Stonehaven, 
but these fall more properly to be noticed in the account of that 
parish. 

Trade and Shipping. — The imports at Stonehaven consist 
chiefly of lime and coals. Of the former, the average annual im- 
port during the last fourteen years is 18,000 bolls, and of the lat- 
ter 13,000 bolls, — the range of quantities over that period being 
from 11,000 to 26,000 bolls a-year of the one, and from 10,000 
to 19,000 bolls a-year of the other. The other imports include 
bone-dust, salt, slates and tiles, paving-stones, groceries, and other 
• shop goods. Of the articles exported, the principal is grain, the 
quantity of which shipped annually during the period mentioned 
has varied from 4800 to 14,000 quarters. Among the other ex- 
ports are potatoes, whisky, cured- fish, and occasionally timber 
and live-stock. In the trade of the port, ten or eleven vessels, 
owned by individuals in the town and neighbourhood, are usu- 
ally employed ; but vessels belonging to other places are engag- 
ed in it. The average revenue of the harbour during the last 
fourteen years was L. 512. In 1826, it was L. 604. In 1835, it 
.fell to L. 412, since which it has been again increasing; and in 
1839, it amounted to L.482. Formerly this harbour, though one 
of the most easy approach in easterly gales, was interiorly so ill 
defended from the sea, as to be shunned by vessels during the 
winter months. In 1825, it was placed, by Act of Parliament, 
under the management of a Board of Commissioners, who, raisino- 
money on the security of the harbour dues, laid out L.8000 in its im- 
provement. The improvement consisted of the removal of a mass of 



228 



KINCARDINESHIRE. 



high rock at the entrance, and the erection of an extensive pier on 
the south side, brought out in a direction towards the old pier on the 
north side, and leaving between their extremities an opening towards 
the sea for the admission of vessels. A large space of harbour room, 
with commodious wharfs, was thus enclosed ; but the state of the 
funds had not admitted of completing the plan, by the erection of 
a break-water, designed to proceed from the north side, so as to 
cover and protect the entrance ; and the consequence was, that the 
harbour was far from being yet safe in great easterly storms. This 
defect has, however, been completely obviated by the recent erec- 
tion of interior piers, or it may be said of one line of pier, running 
from the point of, and at right angles with, the great new pier, to 
the shore, and having an opening just sufficient to admit a vessel. 
In this way, an inner harbour has been formed, so well protected that 
vessels with but slight mooring ropes now lie still and safe in any 
weather. Under the authority of the Commissioners of Northern 
Lights, guiding lights have of late been erected, corresponding 
with the line of the fair way ; and, upon the whole, Stonehaven 
harbour, to the advantage it has always possessed of being acces- 
sible in easterly gales, when few, if any, of the other harbours on the 
east coast could be approached, now adds the advantage of ample 
interior accommodation and security ; and, accordingly, the masters 
of coasting-vessels, who formerly preferred the risk, often very great, 
of keeping the sea, or running for one of the friths, to any shelter 
which it afforded, now willingly- and gladly avail themselves of it 
when overtaken by adverse weather. The steam-ships plying be- 
tween Leith and Aberdeen call in the bay on their passage to and 
fro, and the landing and embarking of passengers and goods by 
these vessels, add something to the business and revenue of the 
harbour. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication. — No parish is better accommodated 
with roads than Dunnottar. Along the sea-coast it has the road 
by which the Edinburgh mails pass. It is kept in excellent con- 
dition under the management of turnpike trustees. The great 
Strathmore road, also turnpike, and in equally good condition, 
runs through the interior of the parish. These roads meet at 
Stonehaven, giving it the advantage of a thoroughfare. Besides 
these great lines, cross roads scarcely inferior to them pass over 
the parish in all requisite directions. These are maintained by 



DUNNOTTAU.

trustees under an act for the conversion of Statute-labour, and 
have greatly promoted the agricultural improvement of the parish. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The former parish church was taken down 
and the present one built on the same site in 1782. The manse 
was built in 1786. Both are tolerably substantial and commo- 
dious, although neither contains the accommodation which is ne- 
cessary, and which a very little additional expense would have 
afforded. The stipend, excluding small fractions, is 127 bolls of 
meal and 92| quarters of barley, with L.IO of money. The teinds 
are exhausted. The glebe contains four acres arable, and a por- 
tion of grass land in an adjoining den. There are several fine old 
ashes in the churchyard, and a good many thriving trees on the 
glebe. The situation of the church and manse, surrounded with 
plantations and grassy dells, is highly agreeable. The distance 
from Stonehaven is about one mile. 

Education. — The parish school is at Stonehaven. The school- 
master's salary is L.34, 4s. AA., with a dwelling-house and the 
statutory extent of garden. The number of scholars varies from 
20 to 30. There are several private schools in the parish, and 
the minister is, ex officio, one of the trustees of a free-school, lately 
endowed in the new town, under the will of Mr William Donald- 
souj at which this parish has the privilege of placing 20 scholars 
from six to twelve years of age. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of paupers receiving 
permanent relief is about 50, and there are five pauper lunatics in 
asylums or boarded at the expense of the parish. The annual ex- 
penditure in this way, for some time past, has not been under 
L.260, while the income has been as under; weekly collections, 
L.66, 6s.; seat rents, L.ll, J2s.; interest of stock, L.20; pe- 
nalties, &amp;c. L. 2, 15s.; total, L. 100, 13s. 

The excess of expenditure over income has hitherto been 
made up by the heritors by a voluntary assessment, and thus not 
only has a sum of L. 400 of stock been kept entire, but the neces- 
sity of resorting to a legal assessment has been avoided. 

Burgh of Stonehaven —At what time Stonehaven was erected 
into a burgh of barony is not known. Very probably the erec- 
tion was contained in a Crown charter in favour of one of the 
Earls of Marischal, which is not now to be found. Its existence 
as n hurcjh was at an early period recognized by the Legislature, 
and an Act of Parliament in 1607, c. 10, ordains « the said Bur/h 
of Stonehaven to be in all time coming the head Burgh of the She- 



230 



KlNCAUDINESHIllK, 



viffdom of Kincardine." Tn 1624, William Earl Marischal, the 
superior, entered into a contract with the feuars of the town, by 
which it was agreed that two resident burgesses of the burgh, 
yearly presented by the inhabitants and chosen by the Earl, should 
be bailies, and should have power " to choose their own members, 
and to hold courts, and to decern anent their own civil and com- 
mon affairs." The late Viscount Keith purchased the superiority 
of the town in 1797, and after his death, the old constitution, 
which, since the Rebellion in 1715, had been in a great measure 
in abeyance, was restored by his trustees, in whom the superiority 
is vested. Since 1 823, when that restoration took place, the feu- 
ars have annually presented a leet of four resident feuars, out of 
which the trustees choose two to be bailies, and these two choose 
a council consisting of three councillors, a dean of guild, and a trea- 
surer, and appoint a town-clerk, a procurator-fiscal, and two town- 
officers. The superior of the town, the magistrates, and three 
feuars chosen annually, are, with the Member of Parliament, the 
sheriff, and the convener of the county, commissioners under the 
Harbour Act of 1825. Previously, the harbour revenue formed 
part of the " common-good." The present amount of it has been 
already stated. The revenue, separate from the harbour dues, is 
about L.30. The town is charged by the Convention of Royal 
Burghs with the sum of L. 4, 10s. 4d. annually, for the privilege 
of trade, and this is assessed among the traders. 

Miscellaneous OnsEavATioNS. 
At the date of the former Statistical Account in 1793, the 
quantity of land under the plough was about 3600 Scotch, or 
4539 imperial acres. Of that quantity about 60 acres have since 
been planted ; not less than 40 acres have been occupied by 
roads ; and as there are about 4860 acres now under the plough, 
it appears that about 421 acres have been brought into cultivation 
since 1793. 

At that period it is stated, " The most general crops of gram 
were bear and oats, with very little barleij, and no wheat;" and 
turnips, it was said, " are commonly sown broadcast with most 
advantage." At the present time, barley is raised more com- 
monly than bear ; wheat and also beans are cultivated on several 
farms, and a single field of broadcast turnips is never to be seen 
in the parish. 

In the former Account, the whole rent of the parish is said to 



STRACHAN. 



231 



have been about L.2100. At present, the rental amounts to 
about L.6600, being more than a threefold increase since 1793. 

A remarkable effect of the introduction of machinery in manu- 
factories appears on reference to the former Account. At its 
date, " there were wages given to spinners in this neighbourhoo I, 
by persons in Stonehaven, who gave out flax for manufacturers 
here and in other places, to the annual amount of L.2632, 9s. 6d." 
This sum was earned by females employed at the spinning wheel. 
That employment has long been almost entirely superseded by 
spinning mills, and the sign board formerly so common, bearing 
the intimation, " Flax to be spun, given out here," is now nowhere 
to be met with.

PRESBYTERY OF KINCARDINE o'nEIL, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. DAVID SCOTT FERGUSSON, MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Boundaries, §-c. — The parish derives its name from the 
river Aan or Aen, which takes its rise on the north side of mount 
Battack, flows down the strath or valley in a north-eastward direc- 
tion, and fails into the Feugh. In the old kirk-session records 
the name is written Strachaan or aen. Its modern orthography is 
Strachan, and it is commonly pronounced Straan. The parish ex- 
tends north and south, from the river Dee to the Cairn o' Mount, a 
distance of about 12 miles, and east and west, from its junction with 
Fordoun parish to the top of Mount Battack, a distance of fully 
20 miles. It includes about 75 square miles. It is bounded on 
the north, by the river Dee; on the east, by the parishes of Ban- 
chory, Durris, and Fordoun ; on the south, by Fordoun, Glenber- 
vie, and Fettercairn ; and on the west, by Edzel, Lochlee, and 
Birse. It is situated twenty-one miles south-west of Aberdeen, 
and fifteen north-west of Stonehaven, the county town. By far the 
greater extent is irregular and mountainous. The only low and 



232 



KINCA.UDINESH1UE. 



flat lands are the cultivated parts, namely, Glen Dye and the val- 
ley of Strachan. 

Mountains. — The highest mountains are. Mount Battack, 3465 
feet above the level of the sea ; Clochnabane, 2370 ; and Ker- 
lock, 1890. 

From the top of each of these a very extensive prospect pre- 
sents itself to the eye, embracing a great extent of the eastern 
coast, from Aberdeen to Peterhead on the one hand, and to Mon- 
trose and the coasts of Fife and Haddington on the other, and 
stretching towards the south as far as Edinburgh and the Pentland 
Hills. But the traveller is often disappointed. Though the day 
may be fine and promising when he begins the ascent, ere he reach 
the summit, one of the fogs so common in very elevated districts may 
have enveloped the mountain, and shrouded from his view the sur- 
rounding scenery. On the top of Clochnabane, which si nifiGS 
" the stone on the hill," is a large granite rock, called the Stone 
of Clochnabane. Its height is about 100 feet perpendicular. It 
is accessible only on the west side. In ascending the mountain 
from the east side, it presents a very grand and imposing appear- 
ance, somewhat resembling the remains of an ancient castle or fort. 
It is seen at a great distance, particularly from the east and north, 
and forms a land-mark to seamen when entering the port of 
Aberdeen. 

From the summit of Scoltie, one of the smaller hills in the pa- 
rish, about 800 feet in height, a beautiful and extensive view is 
obtained of the course of the river Dee. The majestic Lochna- 
gar is seen in the distance. Further down appear the Craggs of 
Ballater, the castle and village of Aboyne, and the village of Ban- 
chory, and numerous surrounding gentlemen's seats he at its base. 
To the north-east is the loch of Skene. The view towards the 
east terminates in the bay and part of the city of Aberdeen; and 
the Grampian mountains bound the prospect on the south. 

Hydrography.— There are three rivers in the parish. Dye, Aen, 
and Feugh. The two former are tributaries to the latter. Dye 
takes its rise on the south side of Mount Battack, and, after flow- 
ing a distance of about fifteen miles, falls into the Feugh a quar- 
ter of a mile above the manse. Aen rises on the north side of the 
same mountain, and, after a course of from eight to ten miles, joins 
the Feugh half a mile above Whitestone. Feugh rises in the fo- 
rest of Birse, and its course to where it mingles with the Dee op- 
posite the mansion of Banchory Lodge, is probably from twelve to 



STUACIIAN. 



233 



fifteen miles. The bed of these rivers is rocky and irregular. 
They rise rapidly to a great height after heavy falls of rain. On 
such occasions the Feugh will rise in a few hours from 8 to 12 
feet. Its height at bridge of Feugh, about 200 yards from its 
mouth, in the great flood of 1829, was upwards of 20 feet above 
its ordinary level. These rivers abound with good trout. Grilse 
and sea-trout are found in the Feugh during the months of July, 
August, and September ; also in the Dye at this season. 

Tiie form of the valley of Strachan would indicate that it had 
at one time been a loch of water, which had its egress on the east 
side by two channels, namely, on the north-east, by the present 
channel of the Feugh, and on the south-east, by the farms of 
Knock and Garrol. This supposition accounts for the lands in the 
higher districts being of greater depth and fertility than they are 
near the bottom of the valley, which is particularly the case with 
the higher lands on the north side. On that side an accumula- 
tion of vegetable matter would naturally take place at the edge of 
the lake, by its being sheltered from the tempestuous influence of 
the north and west winds, which chiefly agitate our Scottish lakes. 

Mineralogy. — The rocks of which the hills are composed are all 
granitic. There is no limestone quarry in the parish, although 
limestone is common in the adjoining parishes of Birse and Ban- 
chory. Valuable specimens of cairngorum have been found in the 
channel of the mountain streams. 

Zoology — Few alpine districts are better supplied with game 
than the Grampian range of Glen Dye, belonging to Sir James 
Carnegie, Bart. Besides the common species, namely, the red 
grouse {Tetrao Scotims, the partridge {T. perdix, and black 
grouse {T. tetrix, the white grouse or ptarmigan {T. lagopris, and 
the dotterel {Charadrius morinelhis, regularly frequent Mount Bat- 
tack, and occasionally wander to other summits on that tract of 
the Grampians. We have been told by a shepherd of the district, 
that it is only of late years that the dotterel first made its appear- 
ance on these hills ; but whether his information be correct or not, 
we caiinot positively affirm. Of the other kinds of game the gol- 
den plover C. pluvialis is very abundant on all the hills and 
moors in this parish; and the gray plover {Tringa sguatarola is 
occasionally met with on the higher ranges. We notice the wood- 
cock only to remark, that it breeds in the woods of Blackhall.

From every inquiry we have made, we are inclined to believe that 
it IS only within the last twenty years that woodcocks ceased to 
emigrate from Dee-side in spring, as they do in almost every other 
district of Scotland. 

The preservation of game being an object of considerable inte- 
rest to proprietors in this quarter, it may be worth while to give a 
complete list of their natural enemies. We can speak positive- 
ly to the following species of the falcon tribe having been shot in 
the district : 

Falco Albicilla Falco Milvus Falco Nisus 

Buteo palumbarius gentilis 

tBiuginosus 

A specimen of the peregrine falcon, which some naturalists 
identify with the gentil falcon, was sent to us from Glendye in 
1835. 

Falco cyaneus Falco Subbuteo 
- Tinnunculiis iEsalon 

To this list of rapacious birds we may add the raven Corvus 
corax, the carrion crow C. corone, the hooded-crow C. comix 
the magpie {C.pica, and the jackdaw C. monedula. In this part 
of the country, the hooded-crows do not emigrate, and seem to 
identify themselves with the common crow and the jackdaw. 
Sometimes, though rarely, the starling {Sturnus vulgaris is found 
in company with them. 

The following are the only quadrupeds of the destructive kind 
which are now found in the district : 

Canis vulpes Miistela nivalis Mustek Martes 
Mus.ji.i Putorius —  Erminea meles 

The wild cat [Felis cattun is rare, if not now extinct. 

Among the rarer species of birds which have occasionally been 
seen in the parish, we may mention the kingfisher {Alcedo ispi- 
da, and the hoopoe {JJpupa epops have been seen passing to 
other places of resort. The ring-dotterel {Charadrius hiaticuh 
makes its nest every season within the water-mark at the conflu- 
ence of the Feugh and Dye. 

Botany. — Scarcely any plants which can properly be called rare 
are found in the parish. The following, however, are not very 
common, and may therefore be deserving of notice. The SchcEnus 
albus, found by a botanist in the parish some years ago, most pro- 
bably in one of the mountain glens ; the JJriza media grows oc- 
casionally by the side of the river ; Festuca gigantea, which is rare ; 



STRACHAN.

the LoUum temulentum, of which a specimen was found, in 1835, 
grovvino- amona barley on . the farm of Heughhead ; the Srjmphy- 
tum tuberosum, found in the woods of Blackball ; the Viburmim 
opulus, and the Bubus saxatilis, and Melampijrum sylvaticum, all 
found on the banks of the river Dee. The Rubus chamBmorus, 
or cloudberry, which is commonly called the everon, grows on 
the summits of the Grampians. 

II. — Civil History. 

From Spalding's History, it appears that the parish was laid 
under heavy contributions for the support of both the Royalist and 
Covenanting army in the reign of Charles I. « Eighthundred 
Highlandmen of Argyllshire," he says, " had an allowance ilk day, 
to be taken off the country, 24 bolls meal, 120 wedders, and — 
marts, with 60 dollars of money ; which they levied off Cromar 
Braes, Aboyn, Strachan, and the countries about." It would ap- 
pear from the same authority, that the lands of Strachan, at this 
period, acknowledged the feudal supremacy of the Earls Marischal 
of Dunnottar. Spalding records the following curious incident, 
which shows the superstitious belief of the period in omens of fu- 
ture good or evil : " A little before this time 1644, there was 
seen in the town of Gellen, pertaining to the Earl Marischal, 
within the parish of Strachan, a fearful unnatural fire, whilk kin- 
dled of itself, and burnt the bigging of the town only. When the 
people saw this fire they ran to quench and stamp it out, but when 
it was quenched in one part it broke out in another part. Jt burnt 
up a byre with nolt and oxen, none knowing from whence it came. 
It seemed to be a prognostic of a far greater fire raised on this 
Earl's lands, as ye shall hear hereafter ;" namely, as our author 
afterwards shows, of the burning of the town of Stonehaven and 
adjoining country by the army of Montrose. 

Eminent Persons. — Andrew Cant, the eminent Presbyterian 
minister, was descended of a family of that name, who were pro- 
prietors of Glen of Dye in this parish. " Sir Thomas Burnett, 
the first baronet of Leys, had a daughter married to Andrew 
Cant of Glendye, and of this family was Mr Cant, the Covenant- 
ing clergyman of Aberdeen," Pinkerton's History of British 
Families. Mr Cant was minister of Pitsligo, from whence 
he was translated to Newbottle, and afterwards, by appointment of 
the General Assembly, to Aberdeen in 1650. He was the friend 
and coadjutor of Dixon and Henderson, and rendered eminent 
service by his faithful and fearless preaching and indefatigable la-

bour to the covenanted cause in the north. Spalding designates 
him " a great Covenanter, and a mortal enemy of the bishops." 

Dr Thomas Reid, author of the " Inquiry into the Human 
Mi nd," and Professor of Moral Philosophy in the University of 
Glasgow, was born in the manse of Strachan in April 1710. His 
father, Mr Lewis Reid, was the first Presbyterian minister of the 
parish after the Revolution settlement. Mr Reid was ordained in 
March 1704, and died in November 1762, having been incumbent 
for the long period of fifty-eight years. The predecessor of Mr 
Reid was a Mr John Strachan, an Episcopalian, who, having be- 
come incapable, from bodily infirmity, of performing the duties of 
the parish, the Presbytery met at Strachan with the view of ob- 
taining the appointment of an assistant and successor. This Mr 
Strachan resisted, and appealed to the Lords of Her Majesty's 
Privy- Council. After speaking, in terms of indignation, of the 
measure adopted by Mr Strachan, Mr Howe, minister of Birse, 
moved the Presbytery to proceed in the face of it, and secure a 
provision for the spiritual wants of the parish, to which the Pres- 
bytery unanimously agreed. 

Parochial Registers. — These have been regularly kept since the 
date of Mr Reid's settlement in 1704. 

■ Landed Proprietors. — The proprietors of the parish are. Sir 
James Carnegie, Bart, of Southesk, proprietor of the estate of 
Strachan.  Sir James has a neat and commodious shooting-lodge 
at Glen Dye, which is occupied by himself and party during the 
shooting season : Colonel Campbell, proprietor of Blackball, 
whose mansion-house is beautifully situated on the southern bank 
of the river Dee, about two miles from Banchory, and three from 
the church of Strachan by the nearest road : Burnett Ramsay, 
Esq. whose mansion-house, Banchory Lodge, is situated in the 
adjoining parish of Banchory ; and Henry Lumsden, Esq. of Til- 
whilley, proprietor of Invery, which house is situated at the north- 
eastern extremity of the parish on the banks of the Feugh, and is 
a handsome building. 

Antiquities — There are three circular and evidently artificial 
mounds, two of them covered with wood of from forty to fifty years 
growth, which may have been used as fences for bowmen when 
practising arrow-shooting. A farm-house, in the neighbourhood 
of these, is called Bowbutts. The third is named Castle Hill ; 
but no remains of a castle or fort are to be seen, nor is there any 
tradition of its existence.

There are two stone cairns, about a mile apart, on the farms of 
Letterbeg and Ardlair. Their form is circular, about 300 feet in 
circumference, and 30 in height. The stones of which they are 
composed are nearly round, and all about the size which a strong 
man could carry. Similar to these, and seen from them, are cairns 
on Crossdardar to the west, in parish of Birse, and Cairnmount- 
earn to the east, in parish of Durris, and the line may have been 
intended, in ancient times, for beacon fires to intimate to the in- 
habitants an enemy's approach, and summon them to defence or 
retreat. 

III. — POPDLATION. 

The population, when last Statistical Account was written in 
1792, amounted to 700. It had increased to 1039 in 1831. 
Since, it has decreased, and, according to a careful census made 
in 1838, it amounted to 942. The census of 1841 gives 944. 
The recent decrease is accounted for by the emigration of families, 
— the decay of old houses which have not been rebuilt, — and prin- 
cipally by the union of several small farms into one, which system 
is now generally practised as the leases expire. The whole popula- 
tion is agricultural and pastoral. There is no village in the parish. 

Yearly average of births for the last five years, 30 
marriages for do. 5 
deaths for do. 12 

illegitimate births for do. 2 
According to census 1838, number of persons under 12 years of age, - 322

IV. — Industry. 
The whole population is agricultural and pastoral, with the ex- 
ception of the few who are employed in trades dependent upon 
agriculture. Blacksmiths, 3; wrights, 7; shops in which groce- 
ries and other goods are sold, 5. A number of females are em- 
ployed in knitting stockings. Good hands make from 7d. to 8d. 
per week, ordinary hands from 5d. to 6d. There is one woollen 
mill in the parish.

uncultivated, waste, and in pasture, 43.061 

susceptible of cultivation, . 365 

in a state of undivided common, about 6000

Total, 56362 

Average rent, of land per imperial acre, somewhat above L.l. 

Rate of Labour. — Labourers and artisans without victuals, in 
summer, '2s., in winter, Is. 6d. per day. 

The common breed of sheep is the black-faced, and of cattle 
principally the small Aberdeenshire breed. 

The system of cropping is generally on. the seventh rotation. 
The better land is well cultivated, is of a deep black soil, early 
and productive ; but the inferior land is still in a rude state of 
cultivation. 

The late General Burnett of Banchory, a public-spirited gentle- 
man and kind landlord, whose memory will be long and grateful- 
ly cherished in this parish and neighbourhood, reclaimed a con- 
siderable number of acres on his estate, now the property of Bur- 
nett Ramsay, Esq. He paid the expense of trenching, draining, 
and building stone fences. The farmer cleared the ground and 
paid 4 per cent, for the money expended, during the remainder of 
the lease. The rivers Feugh and Dye, principally the former, 
have been embanked at considerable expense, for several miles of 
their course, and a few acres thereby reclaimed, while the whole 
valley is thus preserved from inundation, to which it is especially 
liable in August and September months, except when rain falls 
to a great extent, when the embankments do not form a sufficient- 
ly high and strong defence against the torrent, and much damage 
is done. In autumns 1838 and 1839, the embankments were 
overflowed, and in several places burst open, and the crop covered 
with mud and gravel, in some instances to the depth of from two 
to three feet, and otherwise greatly injured. Eight or ten acres 
are at present being reclaimed, which were in this way sanded 
over. 

The general period of leases is nineteen years. There are se- 
veral old and valuable liferents in the parish. Farm-buildings are, 
in general, in commodious proportion to the extent of the farms, 
and the system of agriculture keeps pace with the improvements 
of the surrounding district.

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Marhet-Toions. — The market-towns to which the parishioners 
resort for sale of their farm produce are Aberdeen, Stonehaven, 
and Montrose. 

To the hitter town there is a weekly carrier from the parish, and 
two weekly pass through it from the adjoining parish of Birse ; 
also a weekly carrier passes through the parish to Aberdeen. 
Distance to Aberdeen, twenty-one ; Montrose, twenty-six ; Stone- 
haven, fifteen miles. 

There is a post-office at Banchory, three and a-half miles dis- 
tant from the manse. 

Roads. — The more public roads, though not turnpike, are in 
excellent order, but narrow and seldom defended on the precipi- 
tous side. The private roads to the farm-houses are, in several in- 
stances, in a miserable state, from which great inconvenience must 
be experienced. 

• Tn a remote and rude age, the Cairn o' Mount road, the great line of communi- 
cation across the Grampians, was haunted by a lawless banditti, and the traveller, 
when possessed of money or articles of value, always carried with him a defensive 
weapon. A ravine about 500 yards from the top of the cairn hill on the north side, 
close by the road, and well adapted for concealment, still retains the name of the 
" thiefs buss." About a century and a-half ago, as it is related, a Highlander pas- 
sing to the south, was obliged to stop at a smith's shop at Ford of Dye, near where 
the present bridge stands, to have a shoe replaced on his horse ere he took the hill. 
He found a man of rather suspicious appearance sitting in the shop, who proved to be 
the chief of the gang, though unknown to the Gael. While the smith was at work, 
the Highlander took a pistol out of his pocket and commenced cleaning it. The son 
of Vulcan enquired regarding his intentions with the weapon, remarking that it was 
old and useless. The Highlander replied that the night was dark and the road 
dangerous— that he had a trifle of money which he would not like to part with, and 
should he be attacked, if his pistol widna fell it might maby fleg." His friend the 
smith in vain sought for an opportunity of warning him of the character of the stran- 
ger, who was sitting by. The nag being shod, the mountaineer proceeded on his 
journey, but had not advanced far when he heard the noise of a horse behind him at 
full speed. On turning round, he recognized the man whom he had left in the smithy, 
who sternly demanded his money, backing the demand with a cudgel raised in a 
threa-ening attitude over the head of the honest Celt, and which he no doubt thought 
an over-match for the old rusty pistol. But the cunning Highlander had a better 
weapon, and drawing out another pistol from under his plaid shot the robber dead, 
and proceeded in safety across the cairn.

Bridges. — The bridges are in good repair, but considerable 
inconvenience is felt from the loss of one by the great flood of 
1829, on the line of road across the cairn. A temporary wooden 
bridge supplies its place at Whitestone, about a mile above the 
spot where it stood. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church wasbuiltabout forty years 
ago. In 1837, it was comfortably repaired and an additional gallery 
erected. It accommodates with ease 488 persons, and all the sittings 
are free. It is situated near the centre of that part of the val- 
ley which is included in the parish, on the north bank of the river 
Feugh, and the site is the most suitable which could have been 
chosen for the general convenience of the parishioners. Except- 
ing Glen Dye, where there is a population of 150, distant from 
four to six miles, all the rest of the parishioners are within a con- 
venient distance from the church, the extremes being not more 
than three miles distant. 

The manse was built in 1777, and repaired and enlarged in 
1828. It is ample and comfortable. The whole extent of grounds 
attached to the manse is about five and a half acres, of which 
nearly four acres are arable, and the remaindw in garden, green, 
roads, and stance of houses. 

The glebe land is worth L.2 per acre. Stipend payable from 
the lands of Blackball, by Colonel Campbell, L. 20, 10s. Ood- ; 
meal, 1 boll, 2 firlots. If peck; by Burnett Ramsay, Esq. L.19, 
6s. 5d. ; from the lands of Strachan, L.51, 18s. ; from the Ex- 
chequer, L. 64, lOs. 8d. ; and from the lands of Auldbar, in 
parish of Brechin, L. 3, 16s. Total, L. 160, Is. l-ld., includ- 
ing L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements, and 1 boll, 2 firlots. 

If pecks of meal. 

The whole of the population belong to the Established Church, 
with the exception of one family of Roman Cathohcs, four in 
number; one of Independents, three in number; and the families 
of the proprietors of Blackball and Invery, who are Episcopalians. 

There is divine service in the church, twice on the Sabbath, 
during five months in summer, at eleven o'clock forenoon, and 
half-past four in the afternoon, and in the forenoon only during 
the remaining months of the year. In the forenoon, the church 
is generally full, and from 150 to 200 attend in the afternoon. 
Sir James Carnegie erected, about three years since, at an ex- 
pense of from L.150 to L.200, a handsome school-room and 
school-house, in Glendye, about four miles from the manse. Ihe

minister preaches in the former to the inhabitants of the district 
once a-month. From 50 to 70 ordinarily attend. 

The average number of communicants is 520, nearly 100 of 
whom are from the adjoining parishes. Average annual collec- 
tions at church door, L.27. There is a weekly meeting, on Wed- 
nesday evening, for religious instruction and prayer, conducted by 
the minister ; also a parochial religious association, in aid of the 
General Assembly's schemes, which contributes from L.6 to L.7 
annually to these, and occasionally other religious objects. 

Education. — The parochial school is very efficiently taught, by 
Mr M'Connachie, on the intellectual system. The course of in- 
struction comprehends the ordinary branches of a good education, 
viz. Latin, Greek, geography, grammar, mathematics, book-keep- 
ing, and a little of natural history and botany, with reading, writ- 
ing, and arithmetic. The salary is the rhaximum. The school- 
house is a neat and comfortable building, considerably larger than 
the legal size; and the school-room was amply enlarged in autumn 
1841, at an expense of L. 80, and is most commodiously fitted up 
for the business of education. There is also a weekly school at 
Glendye, in winter, partially endowed, and frequently one in an- 
other district of the parish, on the teacher's own adventure. In 
these, only reading, spelling, and writing, with a little of arith- 
metic, are taught. The attendance at these and the parochial 
school, winter 1839-40, numbered 195. 

There are in summer two, and in winter four Sabbath schools, 
in convenient localities, conducted by seven teachers, and super- 
intended by the minister; also a class for the religious instruction 
of young persons above fifteen years of age, on the Sabbath morn- 
ings, during winter, taught by the minister. Amount of attendance 
on these, winter 1839-40, was 220. 

The parishioners highly appreciate the advantages of the week- 
day and Sabbath schools, the best proof of which is found in the 
number of children attending them, in proportion to the number 
of the population, being about one in five. This proportion, 
however, applies only to the six months in winter. Parents 'and 
others have remarked, that these schools have had a decidedly 
beneficial influence on the morals of the children. Swearing 
quarrelhng, falsehood, and Sabbath profanation are, it is hoped' 
on the decrease among the young. The children love the school' 
and are often reluctant to remain at home when ill health or in' 
clement weather renders it necessary.

Literature. — There is a good parochial library, consisting of re- 
ligious books, and works on general knowledge, historical and 
scientific, numbering upwards of 400 volumes 

Charitable and other Institutions.— A society was formed in 1837, 
for the purpose of supplying meal at a cheap rate to the poor and 
labouring class. To this society. Sir James Carnegie, Bart, and the 
late General Burnett lent L.25 each, free of interest, and Mr Lums- 
denL.5, and about L.40 was raised in the parish by subscriptions and 
donations. The fund is laid out in the purchase of meal, or corn 
to be converted into meal when the price is low, which stock is 
sold out at prime cost, including the trifling expense of manage- 
ment when the price rises. The regular poor, and those of the 
labouring-class who subscribe a small sum, are allowed to be pur- 
chasers. The quantity sold to the latter is regulated by the 
amount of their subscriptions. Any subscriber may withdraw 
when he pleases, on giving three months' notice. A committee is 
annually appointed first week of December, at a public meeting 
of the subscribers and donators, consisting of three of the labour- 
ing-class subscribers, and three of the farmers who have given do- 
nations ; which committee is empowered to lay out the funds to the 
best advantage, and manage the affairs of the association for the 
ensuing year. As soon as the price of meal rises, the stock is 
opened, and sales are made weekly or fortnightly, for ready money 
only. The advantage derived from this association, besides hav- 
ing always at hand a stock of good meal, principally consists in 
the price at which the managers of the fund are enabled to sell it, 
beino- generally very considerably under that of the market. The 
first year of its institution 1837, the stock was sold at 15s. per 
boll, "when meal could not be had in the market under L.l, 2s. 
At present, August 1840, the price is 18s. per boll, while that 
of the market is so high as L.l, 5s. to L.l, 6s. There is thus a 
saving frequently of from 7s. to 8s. per boll, which, to the labour- 
ing man with a large family, is considerable, and the subscribers 
have long since saved the amount of their original subscriptions, 
which still remain to be called for at pleasure. 

It will be perceived, from the nature of this institution, that 
much depends on its judicious management. Hitherto the asso- 
ciation has been very fortunate in the purchase and preservation 
of their stock. 

• A Juvenile Library of 100 volumes was obtained in 1841 for the use of the week- 
day and Sabbath schools.

A parochial society was lately formed for the suppression of in- 
temperance, on the total abstinence principle. It numbers up- 
wards of ninety members, and promises to do much good. 

Measures are in progress for the institution of a savings bank 
in the parish. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — Average number of persons re- 
ceiving parochial aid, 46 ; average quarterly distribution, L. 25 ; 
average sum allotted to each pauper annually, L.2, 3s. 8d. This 
is exclusive of the maintenance of three lunatics in Montrose asy- 
lum, at the rate of L. 22 per annum. The poor are sup- 
ported from the church door collections; the interest of L.177 of 
a fund ; Lady Fraser's legacy of L.2 annually ; a few trifling per- 
quisites, and the donations of heritors. Generally, they are re- 
luctant in applying for parochial aid, and moderate in their re- 
quests. 

Fai7-s. — There is an old annual fair at Cuttieshillock, which, 
in consequence of the number of markets in the neighbourhood, 
is thinly attended. 

Inns. — There are at present four in the parish, one at ScoHes- 
cross, about a mile north of bridge of Dye. The proprietor, on 
renewing the lease of the farm, has very judiciously put down the 
public-house, which will accordingly be shut at Martinmas first. 
About two miles farther on the Cairn road is Cuttieshillock, one 
of the oldest inns in the north. The house was lately repaired 
and much improved. About a mile farther on is an inn at White- 
stone, a large building. The fourth is at church of Strachan, on 
the road to Banchory. 

Fuel — The fuel of the inhabitants is almost eritirely peat and 
wood, the former procured from the mosses of excellent quality, 
which abound in the parish, to which all the parishioners have a 
right, but which are situated at distances of from two to five miles 
from at least two-thirds of the population. A cart load of peats 
costs from 3s. to 4s,, and of wood from Is. to 2s.

PRESBYTERY OF FOUDOUN, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. GEORGE THOMSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
JSfame. — In ancient records, the name is variously written Foder- 
esach, Fethiresach, Fetheressow, &amp;c. An eminent Celtic scholar 
states, that Fialhair, {Fiatha and ar signifies lay land, or wild 
and uncultivated land ; Feathar {Fea and ar, hoggy land. Es- 
sach, aioaterfall, cataract, cascade .—so that Feather-esso seems to 
signify the uncidtivated, or marshy, or hoggy land, in the vicinity of 
the ivaterfall. There is a beautiful waterfall on a small scale, near 
the burying-ground ; but none of any considerable extent in the 
parish. 

Situation, Extent, and Boundaries.— The parish is about 10 
miles in length, between 5 and 6 in breadth, and comprehends 
24,914 acres. It is bounded on the south by the parish of Dun- 
nottar ; on the west, by Glenbervie, Durris,' and Maryculter ; on 
the north, by Maryculter, and Banchory Devenick ; and on the 
east, by the German Ocean. Its southern extremity is 115 miles 
north of Edinburgh, and 15 south of Aberdeen. 

Topographical Appearance.— Its surface is irregular, but not 
mountainous, — presenting a landscape, varying from the most 
pleasing to the most bleak. The new town of Stonehaven, the 
banks of the Carron and Cowie through the whole of their course, 
the grounds adjoining Fetteresso Castle, Ury, Rickarton, and 
Netherley, may be considered as belonging to the former. Nor 
is there wanting at Elsick, Muchalls, and Cowie, and in the bold 
rocky coast, much that is also pleasing to the eye. Most of the 
other districts, particularly the great common of Cowie, m the 
centre of the parish, are bleak, even where cultivation is carried on 
upon a regular and approved system. But there is, in some districts, 
great want of wood and enclosures, and, of course, of shelter; 
and much mossy, wet, and bleak land.

The climate must have been improved by the draining of land, 
wliich has been carried to a great extent. It cannot be called 
either decidedly dry or wet. Nor is it unhealthy. Even in the 
most wet and mossy districts, many reach extreme old age. In no 
quarter are there wanting persons of above eighty years, and there 
are several cases of individuals above ninety. 

Hydrography. — Over the parish generally, there are abundant 
springs. From Ury to the east, some are strongly chalybeate. 
Many years ago, a well of this quality on the lands of Arduthie, 
no vestige of which now remains, was much frequented, the water 
having been considered a valuable tonic. 

There was a kind of lake, called Loch Dews, or the Lily Loch, 
near this well. It is understood to have been, in ancient times, of 
considerable extent. But now very little vestige of it remains. 

The principal streams are the Carron and Cowie. The for- 
mer divides the parish from Dunnottar for about five miles, en- 
tering the sea at Stonehaven. The latter has a similar course 
and termination. The burn of Muchalls arises at the western 
boundary, and that of Elsick within it, both flowing direct to the 
sea. The first two, though not large, are not inconsiderable 
streams ; and occasionally become much flooded, particularly the 
Cowie, which, having its sources in the Grampians, and being join- 
ed by many rivulets, has often occasioned damage to the property 
on its banks. The Carron, too, in 1829 and 1836, inundated part 
of the town of Stoneliaven, to the depth of several feet. The 
course of all these is from west to east, and nearly parallel to each 
other. 

Geology and Mineralogy. —The prevailing rock on the coast is 
gneiss. On the Cammachmore estate, there is a rock of porphyry, 
consisting of fragments of white foliated— imbedded in red compact 
felspar. A dike of this mineral traverses the sandstone, on the 
north side of the bay of Stonehaven. There are quarries of it in the 
parishes of Dunnottar and Arbuthnott. At a short distance south 
of the harbour of Stranathro, there are two gneiss rocks, through 
which the waves, by which they are washed at high tides, have ex- 
cavated two magnificent arches, of about 80 feet high by fifty wide. 
Near this spot there is a mass of sandstone. Its contact with the 
gneiss IS not visible, but the neighbouring gneiss is intersected by 
small veins of sandstone. This is the most northerly locality of 
sandstone m the county of Kincardine. On the farm of Mill of 
Muchalls, a dike of red compact felspar traverses the gneiss. Its 
direction is east and west; its thickness some hundred vards; and 



246 



KINCARDINESHIRE. 



its length about a quarter of a mile. At both extremities of the 
dike, its junction with the gneiss is laid bare. At the west extre- 
mity, the gneiss, as it approaches the dike, passes into mica slate ; 
whereas, at the east extremity, the gneiss, in immediate contact 
with the dike, undergoes no change whatever. On the coast, 
contiguous to the farm of Blackhills, the gneiss abruptly rises from 
an angle of 45 degrees, to a position perfectly vertical. It is highly 
charged with oxide of iron, and very much waved. After continuing 
fromthis point, for some miles up the bed of the water of Cowie, 
the gneiss passes into mica slate. The Garron Point is a rock of an 
intermediate character, between serpentine and trap; and of a 
light green colour. It passes into chlorite slate. A variety of. 
veins of that species of iron ore called haematites, intersect the 
rock. It is of a black colour and very rich. The veins vary from 
four to eighteen inches in thickness. Some of the larger veins 
send out ramifications into the contiguous rock, part of them shift- 
ed in the language of geologists, that is, broken, or forced out 
of their original direction. The rock, at its junctions with the 
veins, undergoes no change, either in colour or hardness. A 
branched dike of compact felspar intersects this rock. In the two 
adjoining bays, there are extensive nests of pipe-clay in the gneiss 
rock, immediately under the sand. On the south side of the har- 
bour of Cowie, within high water-mark, there is in the sandstone 
a bed of clay slate, ten feet thick. On this coast, are found beau- 
tiful pebbles of red jasper, and hornstone porphyry, which take a 
high polish. They have been transported by the waves from the 
conglomerate rocks, south of the bay of Stonehaven. In the dis- 
trict of the parish called the Brae of Fetteresso, there are rocks 
of puddingstone, and of sandstone ; and on the lands of Rickar- 
ton and Mucballs, though the prevailing stone is gneiss, granite 
of excellent quality is found in many places. 

Zoology.— k\\ the varieties of land and sea birds enumerated m 
the reports of the adjoining parishes are to be found here. At 
Fetteresso Castle, there is a rookery, perhaps the most extensive in 
the county. The hill district is well furnished with grouse. 
Black game of late years have much increased, while snipe, plover, 
wild duck, teal, and woodcock, on account of the extended dram- 
age of marshy ground, have decreased in number. Partridges 
are every where found, and pheasants at Fetteresso and Ury. 
There are roe-deer in the woods, and hares in every quarter.

The first distinct records of this parish are connected with the

introduction into it of the families of Fraser and Keith. It would 
appear that, for a long time, these families possessed the whole pro- 
perty of the parish. 

Family of Fraser. — The first person of any note of the name of 
Fraser, mentioned in Scottish annals, is Simon Fraser, who married 
the eldest daughter of Walter, the first great steward of Scotland, 
grandson of Banquo, Thane of Lochaber, and the paternal ancestor 
of the royal family of Stuart. In the reign of David I., a Simon 
Fraser, who seems to have been a person of much consequence, left 
a grand-daughter, and heir, who was married to " Herveus, filius 
Philippi Mariscalli," father of Sir John de Keith, and the ances- 
tor of the Earls Marischal. For many years, the family held high 
offices in church and state. In the reign of Alexander III., we 
find a Fraser " Viscomes de Traquair." 

The first of the race connected with this parish, of whom notice 
is taken in the history of the country, is Sir Alexander Fraser, 
who was nearly related to King Robert Bruce, Archdeacon Bar- 
ber says, the King and Sir Alexander were cousins in a near de- 
gree, and was married to his sister the Lady Mary. He was one 
of the principal instruments of settling the Bruce on the throne. 
He opposed with great success the powerful Curamines, reduced 
the north to obedience, and was signalized by his bravery at the 
battle of Bannockburn. In reward for his services, he obtained 
from that great Prince many gifts of lands in different counties, 
particularly in the shires of Aberdeen and Kincardine, some of 
them no doubt upon his own resignation, since it would appear 
that long before this period he had great influence in those dis- 
tricts of the country. Among these gifts, were the lands and fo- 
rest of Craigie, in the thanedom of Cowie, and afterwards, it 
would appear, the whole thanedom, with many other lands. Sir 
Alexander held the office of Lord Chamberlain from 1325 to 
L329. He was slain in the battle of Duplin, on the 12th August 
13-32 ; and was succeeded by his eldest son John, who, it is said, 
left no issue but one daughter, who was wedded to Sir William de 
Keith the marischah Robert, the son of William de Keith, and 
Margaret Fraser, obtained from King Robert II. on 27th Decem- 
ber 1376, a charter of the forest of Colly Cowie, and the forest 
called the Forest del Month, with the lands of Ferachy, Glasto- 
lach, Cragy, and Clochensheill, which, of old, was part of the 
thanedom of Colly, and was resigned into the King's hands by 
William de Keith. Reg. Mag. Sigilli, p. iii. Another portion 
of the thanedom was inherited, it is said, by Sir William Fraser, 



248 KINCARDINESHIRE. 

the second son of the Lord Chamberlain, and ancestor of the 
house of Philorlh, now worthily represented by the Lord Salton. 
On the 20th October 1413, Williann Fraser, Lord of Philorth, 
sold to William de Hay, Lord of Errol, and Constable of Scot- 
land, all the " landis of the baronyis of Cowy and Durryss, wid 
tenand and tenandyris, and service of the tenand." This con- 
veyance was confirmed by the Regent, Robert, Duke of Albany, 
on May 14, 1415. Robertson's Ind. p. 160. Wood's Douglas's 
Peerage, Vol. i. p. 547. The Crown seems to have retained 
right to part of the thanedom ; for on the ISth April 1363, Da- 
vid IL granted to Margaret de Saint Clair, Countess of Angus, 
an annuity of L.20 " ex thanagio de Colly." 

That part of the property thus conveyed to the family of Errol 
was called the Barony of Urie, and continued many years in the 
name of Hay. On failure of male issue, however, it returned 
again to the fariiily, from which it came, about the year 1640, 
with the exception of those parts which were formerly disposed of 
by the Havs, to Bannerman of Waterton, ancestor of the present 
Sir Alexander Bannerman of Elsick, and to Burnett of Leys, an- 
cestor to the present Sir Thomas Burnett of Leys, viz. the lands 
of Elsick and Muchalls. All the rest of the property was pur- 
chased by William, Earl Marischal, and by him, about 1647, sold 
to Colonel David Barclay, son to David Barclay of Mathers, and 
representative of that family.f 

Parochial Registers.— The oldest record of the kirk-session is 
a register of baptisms and proclamations of banns of marriage, be- 
ginning 2d January 1620, and continuing, with occasional blanks, 
to 5th February 1643. The following table, although it may 
show the number of baptisms recorded, cannot be taken as giving 
an accurate account of the births in the parish.

1640, and goes on, with many interruptions, till May 1672. It 
contains the proceedings of the session, and an account of the col- 
lections and distributions of money for the poor. Among the pro- 
ceedings of the session, there is recorded a solitary case of witch- 
craft, April 1659; the result of which, through the mutilation of 
the register, does not appear. The poor of the parish were divid- 
ed into three classes, viz. beddels, those who were confined by 
infirmity ; gangreh, who, although receiving parish aid, were al- 
lowed to beg from door to door ; and considered persons, who 
received aid from the kirk-session, although not placed upon the 
regular poor's roll like the previous two classes. 

The number of the parish poor was, in the following years, 

1656, - 8 beddels. - 15 gangrels. - 8 considered persons. 
1661, - 9 - 20 - 16 

1667, - 3 18 - 9 

In the first of these years, the sum for their support amounted to 
L,130, 17s. 4d. Scots. 

There are no registers from 1672 to 1716. During the trou- 
bles in 1715, Mr Peter Rose intruded himself into the parish, dur- 
ing the incumbency of Mr Burn, and, when he departed from it, 
carried, it is said, the session books along with him, yea, also, the 
poor's box and its contents. 

Antiquities. — At no remote period, there were many Druidical 
remains in the parish, and some still exist. The vestiges of an old 
camp, by some supposed to be Roman, on a rising ground, called 
Re-dykes Re-king, have attracted much notice. It is still almost 
entire, and occupies a space of 71 acres. It was fortified with 
a wall and ditch. At the distance of about three miles, and close 
to Stonehaven, there were to be seen, some years ago, remains of 
a camp, more distinctly Roman. 

The Romans, in their incursions to the north, seem to have 
proceeded from the Tay along the great valley of Strathmore, 
which runs parallel to the Grampian mountains, from Perth to 
Stonehaven. In this direction, at about twelve miles distance 
from each other, the stations they occupied appear to have been 
Strageth, Grassywalls, Meigle, Battledykes, Keithock, Fordoun, 
Stonehaven, Norman dykes, in the parish of Peterculter, a sta- 
tion also somewhere near to the burgh of Inverury, and Glen- 
mailen called also Re-dykes, in the vicinity of the source 
of the Ythan. By this course, it is supposed that Agricola, hav- 
ing subdued the most southern parts of Scotland, led an army 
of 26,000 men, during the seventh campaign, through the coun- 
try of the Horesti Angus, towards the north, and fought the

KINCAUDINESHIRR. 



great battle, " ad Montem Grampium" against the Caledonians, 
who mustered 30,000, and were led by their chief Galgacus. 

Various opinions have been entertained respecting the place 
where this reat battle was fought. The late Professor Stuart of 
Marischal College, Aberdeen, Transactions of the Society of the 
Antiquarians of Scotland, Vol. ii. Part 2, p. 289, after addu- 
cing many circumstances in support of his opinion that the scene of 
it was here, observes, " Here camp near Stonehaven the Roman 
fleet was seen riding at anchor in the bay of Stonehaven, within 
less than a league of their camp, where no enemy could interrupt 
their mutual intercourse. Here Galgacus would see the fleet equal- 
ly well from the hills above, and might justly be made to exclaim 
' imminente nobis classe Romana and from this place Tacitus 
might properly say, upon Agricola's retreat southward, after the 
battle, " exercitum in fines Horestorum deducit.' " 

On this matter it is only remarked, that the entrenchment at 
Re-dykes is strongest towards the sea, with several outworks on 
that side, an evidence that the enemy was expected from that 
quarter; that along an adjoining hollow, towards the north-east, 
called Monbois, Celtic, the moor of death, and on a lower hill, 
called Kempstone hill, Kemp, a fight, many stones were scat- 
tered, and some of them large single ones on end ; that on Cantlay 
hills, there is a large cairn which never was examined ; that va- 
rious pieces of armour, chariot wheels, &amp;c. have been found in the 
vicinity, some of which are now in the Advocates' Library, Edin- 
burgh, Marischal College, Aberdeen, and Fetteresso Castle; and 
that, in the neighbourhood of the camp at Stonehaven, many sepul- 
chral urns were, not long ago, discovered, and near the cairn, in 
which they had been deposited, a stone pavement, on which, from 
the remains of ashes, it would appear that bodies had been burnt. 

In the second volume of the Transactions of the Society of 
Antiquaries, p. 462, Professor Stuart communicates the result 
of an examination of a tumulus opened near the seat of R. W. 
Duff", Esq. in this parish. The Professor conjectures that this 
may have been the place where Malcolm I. of Scotland was 
interred. In November 1837, there were discovered, about an 
hundred yards to the southward of the tomb last mentioned, 
another ancient burial-place, measuring 3 feet in length, 2 in 
breadth, and 20 inches in depth. It contained the remains of a 
human body, which had been laid on its right side, with the face 
towards the south. The limbs had -been bent upwards, and it

appeared that one of the leg bones bad been broken near the mid- 
dle. An urn about six inches in depth, and 28 in circumference, 
was found lying in the tomb, as if it had been folded in the arms 
of the corpse. Upwards of a hundred jet beads were discovered 
over the breast of the corpse, perhaps having formed ornaments 
on the edge of the urn. 

It mav be only farther noticed here, that, on the top of a rock 
adjoining the sea at Cowie, there remain vestiges of a building, 
oenerally called the castle of Cowie. It must have been but of 
very limited dimensions, not fitted for the residence of the Thanes. 
Most likely, it served only as a place of refuge in danger. There 
are similar remains along the coast southward. 

Distinguished Families. — Many of the noble families of Scotland 
are descended from the Frasers, of whom notice has been taken. 
The estate of Durris, the last property belonging to them in this coun- 
try, after being, fora considerable period, in thepossession of the Mor- 
daunts, Earls of Peterborough, came into the Gordon family, and 
was excambed for lands in the upper district of Banffshire, which 
are now the property of the Duchess Dowager of Richmond, as 
heiress of entail to her brother, Georgej last Duke of Gordon. 

Family of Marischal. — The family of Marischal, the history of 
which is well known, had their principal abode, for many genera- 
tions, at Fetteresso. To this place James II. repaired, imme- 
diately after landing at Peterhead, in the year 1715. From that 
period may be dated the total downfal of a race, which had been 
conspicuous in the annals of the country, from the time of Malcolm 
XL, who began his reign in 1104. 

About the year 1540, the family of Marischal was possessed of 
the greatest landed estate in Scotland, the rental of it amounting to 
270,000 merks, or L. 14,208, 6s. 8d. Sterling, and it was so situated, 
that, in travelling from the north point of Caithness to the borders of 
England, the Earl of Marischal could sleep it has been said every 
night on his own property. In latter times, it became much em- 
barrassed ; wadsetting, on every hand, almost close to the places of 
residence, having prevailed. Many were in existence even down 
to the time of sale by the York-Buildings Company in 1782. 

Family of Barclay of Ury. — Although the property of 
Ury did not come into possession of the family of Barclay 
until 1647, that family is of very long standing in the county 
of Kincardine. In the foundation charter of the Abbey of 

 Wigton, Twecddale, IIumiUo:i, Gordon, .and others.

KINCARDINESHIRE. 



Arbroath, from William the Lion, 1178, — in conveying to 
that institution the lands of Mondynes, in the parish of For- 
doun, it is said, " Dedi etiam eis unam carucatam terre in Mone- 
thyne, super aquam de Bervyne, quam WiUus de Munfort et 
Umfridus de Berkekj/, et Walterus Scotus et Alanus, filius Symo- 
nis, et alii probi homines, mei per preceptum meum eis mensura- 
verunt." This is, perhaps, the earliest notice of the name, which 
was changed to Barclay in the fifteenth century. In 1351, the 
family became possessed of the estate of Mathers, in the southern 
district of the county, and retained it for nearly 300 years. 

No individual of this race has been so conspicuous as the au- 
thor of the Apology for the Quakers. He cannot be claimed as a 
native of this parish, having been born in Morayshire, at the resi- 
dence of his grandfather. Sir Robert Gordon of Gordonston, the 
historian of the house of Sutherland. He resided, however, at 
Ury, for the greater part of his life, and died there on the 3d of 
August 1690, not having completed the forty-second year of his 
age. His body lies in the family burial ground, the most elevat-. 
ed spot on the property, in a small building, commonly called the 
Hovff; in which are also' interred the remains of his son, grand- 
son, and great grandson, ;all bearing the same name. With regard 
to his religious system, there must be difference of opinion ; but, 
there has been only one opinion, with respect to the extent of his 
erudition, the amiableness of his temper, and the continual bene- 
ficent tenor of his life. 

Mansion-Houses.—On the north bank of the Carron, the late 
Mr Duff partly rebuilt, and greatly extended the ancient abode 
of the family of Marischal, and Fetteresso Castle is now one of 
the most extensive and commodious places of residence in the 
north of Scotland. Adjoining it is a large park, in which are 
many trees of .great size, and much thriving young wood, all en- 
closed, and kept in the best order. 

Ury, the seat of R. Barclay Allardice, Esq. is a mansion of 
moderate size. It was built by the family of Hay of Errol, and 
must have been originally intended for a place of defence. The 
walls are very thick, and every floor is arched with stone. It is 
situated on a'steep bank of the Cowie. This house is the most 
striking object that meets the eye of a traveller from the south, 
as he approaches towards Stonehaven. The park is very exten- 
sive, and the adjoining fields are in the highest state of cultivation. 
There are some venerable trees, much hard-wood, planted by

former proprietors, which will soon be of great value, and much, 
planted by the present Mr Barclay, in a thriving state. Around 
a great part of the domain, a high wall of stone and lime has been 
built. This is, perhaps, one of the finest seats in any part of the 
country. 

About a mile west of Ury, and also on the north bank of the 
Cowie, is Rickarton, where is an excellent modern house, beau- 
tifully situated, but not having the advantage of a surrounding 
park. 

At Netherley, the property of George Silver, Esq. there is a 
laro-e commodious house, and much has been done, under unfa- 
vourable circumstances, to improve and ornament the neighbour- 
hood of it. 

At Muchalls, too, the property of the same gentleman, there 
is a venerable old house, already noticed as long the residence of 
the family of Burnett, Bart, of Leys. It is situated on a rising 
ground, near the sea, about four miles north of Stonehaven, and 
around it is a large tract of valuable land, generally kept in grass. 
. Elsick, now belonging to the Rev. Dr Morison, for a long time 
the property and place of residence of the family of Bannerman,  
Bart, has a mansion-house of no great extent, surrounded with trees. 

There is a small house on the estate of Cowie, the property of 
William Innes, Esq. with a neat paddock and garden embowered 
in wood, close by the sea, immediately north of Stonehaven. 

At Newhall and Berryhill, there are good dwelling-houses.

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — Until after the year 1760, there was, in this dis- 
trict, little change in the system of agriculture from that which 
had been practised for many generations. In fact, no regular 
system was pursued, and the produce of the land must have been 
very little, in comparison to that which has since taken place, and 
which is to be principally attributed to the late Mr Barclay of 
Ury. By his sound judgment, undaunted resolution, and unfailing 
steadiness, a complete revolution in agriculture was effected, not 
6nly on his own estate in this parish, but through all the adjoining 



254 KINCARDINESHIRE. 



country. His system was, at the very first, singularly complete ; 
for not many great real improvements have since been made upon it. 

The soil varies in the different districts. There is, indeed, 
every variety known in the country. Ttie most productive is 
found in the eastern part of the lands of Fetteresso and Ury, the 
southern part of Cowie, and eastern of Muchalls. There is some 
good soil, too, on the Rickarton property, and around the house 
of Elsick. In other parts of the parish, it declines from moderate 
to the very worst. Even in the least naturally good, great indus- 
try is exercised, and improvement effected. To this, the exten- 
sive mosses in the western district contribute. Many settlers in 
their neighbourhood occupy themselves in preparing peats for sale 
in Stonehaven ; and in carrying on this branch of industry, sus- 
tenance, often too poor indeed, must be provided for the horses 
employed. Year after year, moorland, to a limited extent, is re- 
claimed in the northern properties. Even when profit from fuel 
is not the object, waste land is coming gradually into cultivation, 
particularly on the estate of Rickarton, which, of late years, has, 
through judicious management, risen more in rental than perhaps, 
in proportion to former value, any property in the country. Ex- 
cept on it, and part of the great common of Cowie, there is not 
now much uncultivated ground, the improvement of which is likely 
to be remunerating. 

Much has been done, and very much is still needed, in draining 
the land. Great attention is paid to the selection of grain for 
seed, and in procuring manure from Stonehaven, and even from 
Aberdeen. Important aid in this respect arises from bone-dust, 
the use of which is, year after year, more extended. In many 
cases farm manure is not so well managed as it ought to be; and 
the opportunity, which might be extensively embraced of construct- 
ing dunghills on the excellent Meadowbank system, is neglected, 
or so conducted as to be ineffectual. Without the removal of the 
antiseptic principle by fermentation, moss remains, though mixed 
with animal manure, in its original state. 

Possessions vary greatly in extent. The highest rent paid by 
an individual tenant does not exceed L.450, and there are not 
many rents exceeding L. 200. A great part of the tenants have 

but one plough each. . 

For some time past, but little wheat has been sown. This yea. 
1841 the extent was about forty acres. In the neighbourhood ot 
Stonehaven, a good deal of land of a clayey description is occu- 



l-'ETTERESSG.

pied in raising beans. The principal grain crops are oats and bar- 
ley. Of the former every species known in the country is sown, 
and change of seed frequently procured from other districts. The 
prices of grain being now principally regulated by weight ; in seve- 
ral districts, where the soil is of an inferior quality, the cultivation 
of barley and Chester bear is discontinued, and oats, as more re- 
munerating, substituted in their room. 

Many courses of rotation of cropping are in use. Among them, 
1st, turnips, barley, grass, oats; 2c, turnips, barley or oats, haj, 
pasture, oats; Sd, turnips, barley or oafs, hay, pasture, pasture, 
oats, oats. The second, five course shift, is the most prevalent. 

A considerable quantity of land is annually, in small lots, let to 
tradesmen and others residing in Stonehaven, by farmers in the 
neighbourhood of it, for raising potatoes. Much of this crop is 
sold by the tenants in the northern district at Aberdeen; and large 
quantities from every part of the parish are shipped for London, 
&amp;c. Much, too, is used, both raw and steamed, as food for horses 
and cattle, and it forms the principal article in feeding many pigs. 
It is feared, it may be added, that it forms the principal article in 
the sustenance of the families, not only of the decidedly poor, but 
also of many tradesmen and labourers. 

Mr Robertson, in his Agricultural Report of the County of 
Kincardine, 1808, states the number of black-cattle in this pa- 
rish, 3050; horses then paying tax, 315; sheep, 3100; swine, 
22, The number is now greatly increased, except in regard to 
hill pastured sheep, the number of which is diminished. Many 
horses are reared, but few possess particularly valuable properties. 
Some of the heritors and principal tenants have paid attention to 
the breeds of cattle. The late Mr Duff of Fetteresso preferred 
the West Highland, which he brought to a great size and weight; 
the late Mr Silver of Netherley had always an extensive stock of 
a superior class ; and Mr Barclay of Ury is very eminent as a 
breeder of Teeswater or short- horned cattle, to be afterwards no- 
ticed. The cattle possessed by the tenantry in general are little 
to be commended. By far too many are reared. It would be of 
much advantage that the number were reduced at least a third ; 
this would be better proportioned to the food that can be supplir 
ed, and prove more profitable to the possessor. Cattle are fatten- 
ed forconsumpt in the country, and the London market, which, for 
some years past, has been opened to this district by steamers and 
other vessels from Aberdeen ; but by far the greater part of the tur-

nip crop is consumed by cows and young stock, while the quantity 
eaten off the ground by sheep is yearly increased. 

Oat-sowing, even in favourable seasons, seldom commences un- 
til about the second week of March. Barley sometimes at this 
period, but generally later, occasionally not even until May. 
Many consider late preferable to early sowing, in regard to weight 
of crops. Reaping takes place at most uncertain periods, and not 
unfrequently the harvest labours are not over before the beginning 
of November. The greater part of the crops is cut down by a 
scythe, having two handles, which is considered as in every respect 
superior to that formerly in use. But the sickle is not altogether 
discontinued. 

Farm- Buildings. — These were generally, in former times, of a 
very poor description. Year after year, however, new steadings 
have been erected, well adapted to the respective possessions, both 
as to family accommodation, and out-buildings. The number of 
thrashing-mills is continually increasing, the greater number hav- 
ing horse-power, many water, and one steam. 

Leases, Rent.— Leases, almost universally, endure for nineteen 
years. There are farms of considerable extent,— one of 80 acres 
imperial, the rent of which is L.3, 4s. per acre ; and three of 200, 
130, and 120, L.2, 5s. ; several L.l, 10s. to L.2; and from that sum 
every rate down to 5s. All of these rents are considered, taken in 
comparison with other districts of the country, high ; and few of 
the tenantry pay them without the exerci.se of their own personal 
labour, while they live in a very plain and frugal manner. 

• For a considerable period the seasons have, on the whole, been favourable. A 
short notice may be given respecting some of those during the latter period of the 
last century, as experienced in this district. The years 1770 and 1/71 were very 
bad. In each, continued snow for thirteen weeks after Christmas. 17/2 and 1773, 
better, but grain scanty and dear. 1774, much damage from sea blight, the best oats 
on the coast not producing above 7 pecks of meal per boll. 1 /7o oats, with fodder, 
sold at L.2 per boll. 1776, very abundant. From 1777 to 1781, good. In 17/9, 
the seed was all sown in February, and the harvest finished in the middle of August j 
oats with fodder sold at from L. 1, 10s. to 1.. 2 per boll, while meal did not exceed 
13s 4d 1782, disastrous beyond all precedent. 1 783, loss from the badness of the 
seed. 1784, very abundant. 1795, bad crop and harvest,-llasting shaking, and 
rotting. 1799, oats sowing began 13th April, barley sowing 1.5th May. Not two 
dry consecutive days from the beginning to the end. \V .th the exception of 1/82, 
the worst crop ever remembered. The Kincardineshire bar prices of that crop were, 
barley L.2, 7s., meal, L.2, 3s. per boll. With regard to the present century, it may 
only be noticed, that the crop of 1813 was, perhaps, the greatest ever known in Bri- 
tain At the Martinmas Stonehaven market, the prices were, oats, 8s. to Js. per 
boll ; meal, lOs. 6d. , barley, 10s. to 12s. Barley, for which at .h.- tin.e he was of- 
fered lis., a tenant on the estate of Ury, who, no doubt, often, greatly to h.s loss 
was accustomed long to retain his grain when prices were unsatisfactory, aftcr«.i ds 
Told at L. 1. 10.S. to L.2, and the remainder, in autumn 181/, bringing him nearl 
J,.500 at L.3, 3s. per boll.

Attempts to obtain a correct statement of the produce of industry 
in so extensive a parish have failed. The average of barley crops 
in the better districts may be estimated at 5 quarters per acre ; of 
oats, 5| : in the inferior, barley, or Chester bear, 3 ; oats, 
4. Very great crops have been raised, 18 bolls of wheat per acre, 
12 to 14 bolls of oats, &amp;c. ; but averages are often overrated, as 
the experience of many a tenant has unfortunately proved. 

A considerable part of the best land is laid down in permanent 
pasture, particularly on the estates of Fetteresso, Ury, and Mu- 
challs. It is let annually on the first and last of these, at rents 
of from L.2 to L. 4 per acre, to butchers, cattle-dealers, and fre- 
quently to farmers, who sell their hay crop, most injudiciously, and 
pay for pasture for their young stock. 

A very large sum is drawn for dairy produce. From the north- 
ern district, the Aberdeen market is weekly attended, for the sale 
of butter, cheese, poultry, eggs, &amp;c. and from the southern, that 
of Stonehaven. There are dealers in these articles in several 
places, besides, within the parish. Almost every tenant now keeps 
pigs. Even in Stonehaven there are many. They are purchased by 
pork-merchants, when they reach from five to seven stones weight, 
are slightly salted, and sent for immediate use to London in casks] 
each containing a hundred-weight. About 600 were, in 1841,' 
thus disposed of, average weight six stones, and price 5s., amount 
L.900. 

Mr Barclay of Ury has, from time to time, taken under his own 
management farms on his property, originally improved in part 
by his father, and renewed that productiveness which tenants had 
allowed to fall off, by fresh application of lime, manuring, drain- 
mg, and in several instances, spade trenching, at a great expense 
Some of these farms he has re-let, at advanced and remunerating 
rents. He has now, under his immediate charge, above 600 acres 
surrounding his mansion-house, and forming one of the most beau- 
tiful farms to be seen in any part of the country. Every variety 
of soil is found in it, and all is kept in the very highest order A 
considerable part consists of old pasture, in forming compost for 
the top-dressing of which, 12,000 loads of moss have been used with 
much beneficial effect. The whole of the farm is enclosed, fully wa 
tered and sheltered by stone walls, hedges, and plantations. When 
a field, which has been for a long course of years in grass, is broken 
up for culture, the course pursued is, 1. year, oats; 2d, birley •

made into hay ; 6/t, pasture. Except in the case of land which 
has, for many years, been under pasturage, two grain crops in suc- 
cession are not taken ; and the five course shift is generally adopt- 
ed. When raising wheat, the rotation is, of course, different. In 
laying down land for permanent pasture, Mr Barclay adds to clo- 
ver and rye-grass many additional seeds, according to the nature 
of the soil. The first expense is considerable ; but a close sward 
is formed, even in the second year, and on ground of but indif- 
ferent quality ; and the grasses coming forward at successive sea- 
sons, from early spring to late autumn, there is a continued supply. 
The greater part of the turnip crop is consumed on the ground by 
sheep. Of these, he has generally a flock of upwards of 1000. 
They are of the Leicester breed, procured originally from Eng- 
land. The mutton of this species is not extensively used in the 
country. It finds market principally at London, to which the 
sheep are sent by steam-vessels from Aberdeen. The wool is sold 
to Leeds manufacturers. The sheep, at two years, often reach 
in weight to 25 lbs. per quarter, and the fleeces to 8 lbs. 

Perhaps the most important matter in farming proceedings, in 
which he is engaged, is the rearing of Teeswater, or short-horn 
cattle. He introduced this breed in the year 1824, having se- 
lected bulls and heifers from the most celebrated stocks in the 
counties of York and Durham. He has, ever since, continued unre- 
mittingly to attend to it, and is considered to have at present one of 
the finest and thoroughly pure stocks in Britain ; the number being 
seldom under thirty or forty cows and heifers, besides other classes. 
The introduction of this breed forms an important era in cattle- 
rearing in the north of Scotland, over most districts of which pro- 
duce from Ury is now to be found. Indeed, many animals have 
been sent from it into England, Ireland, and several places on the 
continent. Notwithstanding the annual sales have gone on for 
many years, and the breed is now so widely spread, the prices 
continue very high. At the sale of last autumn, the bull calves 
of from four to nine months old averaged L.40 a head. These cir- 
cumstances prove the estimation in which the breed is held. If it 
be the case, as is asserted, that the beef of the best Scotch cattle 
fetches only about 5 per cent, above that of the Teeswater ; that 
the Scotch cattle cannot be properly fed for the butcher, until 
three and a half years old, while the short horns can be made fat 
at two and a half, or less ; that native bullocks weigh, at two and

a half, 30 stones Dutch, while even a cross with the Teeswater 
of the same age weighs from 50 to 60, — the cross having much of 
the gentle tempers and quickly feeding qualities of the pure short- 
horn : — if these be facts, they must go far to settle the point, both 
as to the pure breed and the cross, in regard to their introduction 
on farms, where adequate provender and shelter for summer and 
winter can be supplied. 

The crossing system has been advantageously pursued by Mr 
Barclay, he having had, for several years, about forty cows of the 
West Highland breed, preferred, not only on account of their 
form properties, but also their hardy nature, rearing calves to 
Teeswater bulls. At the last sale, those from twelve to eighteen 
months old averaged L.12 ahead. 

Plantations. — These occupy about 2000 acres. On some of the 
higher grounds on the Fetteresso and Ury properties, owing to the 
nature of the subsoil, the trees long ago planted did not succeed. 
In more favourable situations, the success has been great ; and 
much valuable wood of every kind usually produced in the coun- 
try is every year disposed of. Larches have unfortunately, in se- 
veral localities, been lately in an unthriving state. 

Mr Robertsouj in his Agricultural Report of the county of Kin- 
cardine 1808, states that of the 24,914 acres to which this pa- 
rish extends, above a third was then in cultivation ; that about a 
tenth more was susceptible of cultivation ; and about a twelfth part 
was under plantation. It is supposed, that there are now 10,000 
acres under tillage, and 2000 in plantations. The rent at that 
period amounted to L.7427 ; in 1794, L. i200. Its state in 1840 
was as follows : Ury, L. 4000 a year; Fetteresso, L.3328; Ne- 
therley, Monquiech, and Muchalls, L.3397 ; Rickarton, L.1604; 
Cowie, L.1383; Rothnick, L.300 ; part of the Dunnottar estate, 
L.6; and the common of Cowie, L.20. The property of Elsick 
was feued in ten lots, about the year 1760, by the magistrates of 

This tract of uncultivated ground extends to 2774 Scotch acres. Of this, 512 
acres consist of peat moss, the rest of heath interspersed with coarse grass. Length- 
ened judicial proceedings took place about the right to this common, which issued in 
a decree, confirmed, on appeal, by the House of Lords, in April 1824, finding, that 
" the whole forest, muir, and commonty of Cowie belongs to Sir Alexander Keith of 
Diinnottar, subject to the rights of servitude, which the other heritors may be able 
to instruct over the same." Of this common, 828 acres are claimed as property bv 
some of the neighbouring heritors. A considerable part might be rendered arable a"t 
no very great expense ; but no attempt at cultivation can be made until a division 
be effected, and to this there are serious obstacles, arising from the great number of 
persons who claim rights of servitude. In the meantime, the difFerent conterminous 
heritors or their tenants pasture cattle and sheep on the common. Great quantities of 
peats are taken from the mosses, and of sods from the surface of the ground;— thereby 
year after year, destroying the means of forming a soil for cultivation. The reni 
stated arises from the privilege of shooting. umvat.on. xne rent

Fisheries. — There are three fishing-stations, one at Cowie, 
where there are 8 boats ; one at Shanathro, 4 ; and one at Sket- 
raw, 7 ; each having a crew consisting of five men. Fishing of cod 
and ling is now not so much pursued as formerly. Haddocks are 
the principal object. After supplying the neighbourhood with 
what is required in a fresh state, part during the summer season is 
dried on the beach, and called speldings. A part is smoked with 
peat, in the manner well known by the name of Findon. A much 
greater part, for some past years, has been smoked in houses pre- 
pared for the purpose, by wood. A very large quantity of these, 
from all the stations, is carried by cadgers to Forfar and Perth- 
shires, and by coaches and sea-carriage to Edinburgh and Glas- 
gow ; a great deal also by steam-vessels from Aberdeen to Lon- 
don. Cod and ling are dried on the beach as well as haddocks, 
and a considerable quantity salted and forwarded in casks to diffe- 
rent markets. All kinds of fish commonly found on this coast form 
part of the produce of the fishery with those enumerated. The 
drying, smoking, and pickling processes are now generally in the 
hands of contractors, who receive the fish, at stipulated prices, 
from the fishermen immediately after their arrival from sea. 

Almost all the persons employed in fishing are, during the her ■ 
rincT season, occupied in that department. Those in this parish 
have been accustomed to fish at Peterhead and Fraserburgh ; of 
late years, however, several of them at Stonehaven, where they 
have been very successful ; and most likely few or none will, in fu- 
ture seasons, proceed to distant places. The number of boats 
thus employed, for some time past, has amounted to 15, each hav- 
ing five men. Their tonnage is from 20 to 30 tons.

There are several salmon-fisheries in this parish let to tenants. 
The principal is in the "bay of Stonehaven, where the process is 
conducted by cobles, and stake and bag-nets ; at Muchalls and 
other places, almost entirely by the last of these modes. There 
are no river fishings. Only a small part of the salmon is consum- 
ed in the neighbourhood, the greater part being sent to the Lon- 
don market. Even in favourable seasons, the quantity procured is 
not great, as may be supposed from the rents not exceeding L.lOO 
a year. 

Brewery.— k brewery, long established in Stonehaven, supplies 
the town, and a wide circuit ofthe adjoining country with beer, &amp;c. 

Distillery. — A distillery was commenced on the Cowie, close 
by Stonehaven, in 1824, known as the Glenury Royal Distillery. 
From time to time, it was extended until capable of manufacturmg 
upwards of 6000 quarters of barley annually. The buildings are ex- 
tensive and substantial, and the utensils of the best description. 
The proprietors having offered the work for sale, distillation has 
lately been carried on but to a limited extent. 

Manufactures, — There are two mills on the Carron, at Stone- 
haven. One, not now occupied, has been used for spinning both flax 
and wool. The other continues to be employed in wool-spinning, 
principally for persons in the country districts. It is on a limited 
scale. 

Only a small quantity of cloth is manufactured by individuals 
for family use. Still some is made, chiefly of home-grown wool, 
and there are weavers for such work in several parts of the pa- 
rish. In Stonehaven and neighbourhood, many, several years 
ago, were occupied in weaving dowlas, duck, and sacking, for ma- 
nufacturers in Aberdeen and Montrose. The number does not 
exceed now 85, including females and boys, and they are far from 
being constantly employed. Even when they are employed, after 
working from very early in the morning to very late at night, a 
man, in the full vigour of life, often cannot earn above 10s. a- 
week. » 

Woollen yarn is still given out monthly for knitting into stock- 
ings, by an Aberdeen company, but the payment allowed is 
wretchedly low. 

V. — Pauochial Economy. 
Means of Communication. — The first and greatest work in im- 
provement in the roads in this parish, was the executing the turn- 
pike road from the south to Aberdeen, about the year 1797,

KINCARDINESHIRE. 



Afterwards, 1800, principally through the great exertions of Mr 
Innes, then tacksman of the whole estate of Durris, a turnpike 
road was made from Stonehaven to Banchory Ternan ; and late- 
ly, that from Stonehaven to the Dee, by Netherley, has been put 
on the same footing. The first two of these have been laid out in 
the most judicious manner, are kept in the best order, and have 
been attended by the most beneficial effects. There are about 
twenty miles of these roads in the parish. On those under the com- 
mutation Act of Parliament, great improvements, year after year, 
have taken place in every district, and farther progress is in 
view. 

Toicn, "c. — About the year 1759, the late Mr Barclay of Ury 
purchased the property of Arduthie. Soon after, he planned a 
new town often still called the Links of Arduthie along the sea- 
shore, forming a continuation of Stonehaven, in the parish of Dun- 
nottar, in which the Sheriff and other courts of Kincardineshire are 
held. It is built on a regular plan. The feus, each one-eighth 
of an acre, are given off in perpetuity. At first, the duty was low, 
but afterwards was raised to L.2 per annum. It made, for a con- 
siderable period, rapid progress, the population having been in 
1801, 770; in 1821, 1635; in 1831, 2064; in 1841, 2061. 
There are in New Stonehaven many excellent houses, to which 
walled gardens are attached ; others, of an inferior description, 
suited to various classes in society ; and shops, where goods of 
every description are always to be obtained. 

There are, also, tradesmenf of almost every kind. The dwel- 
ling-houses and shops are lighted by gas ; and the supply of water 
is abundant. 

There are, of course, villages at the fishing stations. That at 
Cowie contains 174 inhabitants; at Stranathro, including the 
coast-guard establishment in it 126; at Sketraw, 183. There are 
45 persons in the Kirktown. 

Post-Office, Sfc.—Ty/o mails from the south, and two from the 
north, are received at Stonehaven every day. A stage-coach, to 
and from Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Aberdeen, passes also every 

• The purchase-money was L. 1500. For a longtime past, the rental has amount- 
ed to L. 1000 per annum ;— one-half from feu-duties, the other from the landward 
part ;— a case scarcely paralleled, except in the neighbourhood of large and nume- 
rously peopled towns. i i j 

t Stonehaven, though the head town of Kincardineshire, would appear to have had 
no public baker in 1664. It is stated in the session records, that, on the sacramen- 
tal occasion in that year " there was given Jean Dickie 8s. for goemg to Montrose 
for the bread."

times a-week. The Aberdeen and Edinburgh steamers call on 
their way; and there are carriers in constant employment m every 

''DTpensanj.--The poor receive medical advice, are visited in 
their houses, and supplied with medicines. The establishment is 
supported by contributions from the inhabitants. The services 
of the physician are gratuitously afforded. . r i 

Bank.-A branch of the Aberdeen Town and County Bank 

is established in the town. 

Savinas Bank.-Soon after the introduction of these institu- 
tions, one was established for this, and the neighbouring parish ot 
Dunnottar. Its funds have always been increasing, and now the 
deposits amount to upwards of L. 14,000. 

Harbour.— The parish is principally supplied with coals, lime, 
&amp;c. from the harbour of Stonehaven, close to its southern boun- 
dary ; and from it, grain and other produce are exported. Coals 
and lime, to a limited extent, are imported, during the summer 
season, at a creek at Elsick, formerly mentioned. 

Markets.— There is a weekly market at Stonehaven, on Thurs- 
day, when butter, cheese, poultry, eggs, &amp;c. are exposed for sale. 
On that day there is a market for grain, during its season, attended 
by the farmers of the adjoining district ; and in winter and spring, 
for cattle. Immediately previous to Candlemas, Whitsunday, Mar- 
tinmas, and Christmas, the market is for cattle, feeing of servants, 
&amp;c. Fairs, formerly at Megray, about two miles north, for cattle 
and horses, in June and September, are now held in Stonehaven. 
Butcher-meat is to be there procured every day. 

At Muchalls, there are cattle fairs, at several seasons of the 
year, generally well attended. 

Inns, SfC.— There are 40 houses licensed for the sale of spirits, 
&amp;c. — in Stonehaven, 25 five of which have wine licenses ; in the 
villages of Cowie, Stranathro, and Sketraw, 7 ; and along the 
roads, in different districts, S. The number in Stonehaven, in 
1838, was 32. It is hoped that the cause of abstinence from in- 
toxicating liquors, at present favourably advancing, will continue 
to make progress, and public-houses, year after year, become less 
common. 

Horticulture. — There are good gardens at the seats of several 
of the proprietors, a particularly fine old terraced one at Ury, 
and a conservatory and hot-house at Fetteresso Castle. Much

attention has, of late years, in this respect, been paid by persoiTs 
in Stonehaven. The quantity of fruit there produced is great, 
and, in many cases, of high quality. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The picturesque remains of the church 
of Cowie, strike the eye of every traveller on the road leading to 
and from Stonehaven ; the effect, no doubt, injured by its having 
had placed close to it a dead-house, lately erected. It was dedi- 
cated to the Virgin Mary. Its length is 67 feet, and width 18; 
and it is surrounded by a burial-ground, in which many bodies con- 
tinue to be interred. Cowie does not appear to have ever formed 
a separate parish from Fetteresso. The church seems to have 
been a private chapel for the accommodation of the proprietors 
and their feudal retainers. The chapelry was conveyed to Mari- 
schal College Aberdeen, by the original charter of George, Earl 
Mariscbal, in 1593, but reserved by the charter of ratification of 
William, Earl Marischal, son of the former, in 1623. At the Re- 
formation, the value of the benefice was estimated at 24 bolls of 
bear. In 1601 , Mr Andrew Milne, minister of the parish, received 
a grant of the third of it.f 

• Cowie seems to have been, in ancient times, a place of greater importance than its 
present appearance would give ground for supposing. There is a charter in Maris- 
chal College Aberdeen, dated 20th October 1367, " By Alicia, relict of the deceased 
John son of . . .of Cowy, to her well-beloved cousin, Allan of Gilnafoyet, of 
four acres belonging to her, with the buildings of the same, lying in the north part 
of the village of Cowy." 

Keyth says " At the mouth of Cowy water, is a free burgh called Cowie veiusla 

magis qnam opulenta, by reason of tire want of a shore or seaport for ships. There 
is to be seen beneath the town, the ruines of a castle, built, as is supposed, by Mal- 
colm Canmore ; the town of Cowie made a free burgh by the said king. Besides 
these ruins, there is an old chappel, called the . Kirk of Cowie, and a chaplaincy be- 
longing thereto, given out by the king of old ; and the parson of Fetteress hath a

" There be many crofts of land yet, beside this ruinous castle and the town of Cowie 
that have their several denominations from the several office-men of the said palace, 
as Cooks-croft, Porter-croft, Stable-croft, Stewart- croft, and have tbeir several char- 
ters to this effect" 

No authority is known in support of these statements by Mr Keith. It appears, 
however, from the baptism register, that the Earls of Marischal, and other persons of 
high respectability, were on habits of social intercourse, at a much later period, with 
persons there residing. , . , ,

The former parish church was situated close on the southern 
boundary, rather more than a n.ile from Stonehaven. It must 
have been very ancient, but without any claim to architectural 
importance. Its walls still remain, having been purchased by 
Mr Duff of Fetteresso, and it is not likely that they will be de- 
molished but by the hand of time. Although its length was cur- 
tailed in 1720, when a small aisle was built opposite the pulpit, 
it still was in length 94 feet, while its width was only 19. In 
1813, an excellent new church, fitted to accommodate 1400 sit- 
ters, was erected, near Stonehaven, and, at the same time, a cor- 
responding manse. • u • i 

There is attached to the former church an extensive burial- 
ground, in which, on an average of seventeen past years, seventy- 
six corpses have been annually laid. 

For a considerable period, commencing about the year 1760, 
there was a small place of worship at Newhall, in the northern 
district of the parish. It was known by the name of the Sod 
Kirk, having, at first, most likely, either been built of, or covered 
with turf. Latterly, it was tile-roofed. It had always been a 
wretched place, and at last became altogether ruinous. In 1816, 
great exertions were made for procuring a better and larger build- 
ing ; and a house, accommodating 400 sitters, was erected at 
Cookney, on the property of Muchalls. It having become insuf- 
ficient for its object, fresh exertions were made, which resulted in 
a church, in which 700 are properly accommodated. In promot- 
ing this important object, the late Mr Silver of Netherley was in 
every way powerfully efficient. 

In this district, far distant from the parish church, there are 
1400 members of the Establishment, exclusive of nearly 300 who 
are connected with an Episcopal chapel, also on the estate of Mu- 
challs. At Cookney, worship is regularly conducted on Sabbath 
by a preacher, who is also second parochial schoolmaster ; and, 
by permission of the presbytery of Fordoun, the sacrament of the 
supper is annually administered by the minister of the parish. At 
the celebration of it, in May last, 510 communicants joined in the 
sacred ordinance. 

" It is to be remarked that, after the Reformation of religion in this kingdom in 
Queen Marie's time, this chapel being demolished by reason of superstitious resort- 
ing thereto, a certain man called William Rait of Redclock brought away some of 
the roof of this chapel and built a house therewith ; and a little thereafter the wholo 
house rained drops of blood. There be »ome living yet that can testify this."

Of the Episcopal persuasion, to which, with few exceptions, the 
fishermen at the three stations belong, besides those in the north- 
ern, there are about 250 in the southern district. Of the United 
Secession Church, there are 120 members in full communion, 
who, with their ftxmilies, worship in a commodious building at 
Stonehaven. There are also a few families of the Methodist con- 
nection, and one of the Roman Catholic. 

The following is a list of the ministers of Fetteresso from the 
Reformation to the present time : — Mr John Christesoun, minis- 
ter of Fetteresso, Dunnottar, and Glenbervie, 1567. Archibald 
Rait, reader at Fetteresso, 1567-1576. Mr Patrick Brown, died 
1579. Mr Andrew Milne, translated from Dunnottar , November 
1579 ; died 1605. Mr Andrew Milne, Junior, admitted 1605 ; 
died October 12, 1640. Mr Patrick Leslie, translated from 
Skene, 1640. Mr John Milne,t 1676; died January 1703. Mr 
John Webster, admitted March 13th 1705 ; translated to New 
Deer, April 1707. Mr David Burn, admitted November 2d, 
1709 ; died May 1749. Mr Alexander Forbes, admitted Fe- 
bruary 1750; died January 1759. Mr John Ballantyne, admitted 
June 1760; died October 1762. Mr William Shank, admitted 
February 1763 ; died in August following. Mr John Hutcheon, 
admitted 1764; died February 27, 1800. Mr George Thom- 
son, the present incumbent, admitted September 18th 1800. :[ 
The present incumbent, on entering on his office, was told by 
several persons, that he was the sixth minister of the parish whom 
they had seen. Considering the period during which his imme- 
diate predecessor filled the charge, the circumstance appeared 
very remarkable ; but the above statement will show its consisten- 
cy with truth. 

The stipend consists of 17 chalders, half barley, half oatmeal, 
paid in money, according to the county fiars prices, the average of 
which, for the last seven years, has been for barley, L. 1, 6s, 9|d. 

 Mr Andrew Milne, Senior, was schoolmaster of Montrose, and the preceptor of 
Mr James Melville, who, in his Diary, speaks of him as a " lerned, honest, kynd 
man, verie skilfull and diligent." He was appointed minister at Dunlappy m 1571, 
whence he was translated to Dunnottar in 1578. He appears to have been much em- 
ployed in the ecclesiastical affairs of the period. 

|- On the death of Mr Milne in 1703, Mr Gideon Guthrie, an Episcopal preacher, 
intruded himself into the church and manse, with the connivance of Earl Marischal, 
the patron, and retained possession till May 1709, when he was ejected by a sentence 
of the Court of Justiciary. 

J For the information contain'ed in the above list, and kind aid in this report, 
grateful acknowledgments are offered to Mr G. R. Kinloch of Edinburgh, and also 
to Mr Duncan of Aberdeen, — both eminent for their attainments in every branch of 
antiquarian knowledge.

per quarter, and for meal, 1 7s. Td. per boll. The glebe is rather 
more than eight acres in extent. 

Education.— There are two parochial schools, one situated in 
the south, the other in the northern district ; the first having at- 
tached to it the maximum, the second, the minimum salary. 
There are, besides, in Stonehaven, and in several places in the coun- 
try part of the parish, — some schools more especially for females, 
which are all unendowed, with the exception of two. That at Cairn, 
hill was established by the Rev. Dr Morison, minister of Ban- 
chory Devenick, proprietor of the estate of Elsick, who has pro- 
vided a school-room, lodging, and a garden, for the teacher, and 
also, as annual salary, the interest of L.IOO. The other was found- 
ed by the late Mr William Donaldson of Quoschies, who, by his 
latter will, conveyed to trustees the lands of Beltcraigs, and a te- 
nement in Stonehaven, for the purpose of educating fifty or more 
poor children, two-thirds of the number from the parish of Fetter- 
esso, and one-third from the parish of Dunnottar. The school 
was opened in June 1838, and 60 young persons have since that 
time attended it, vacancies having, twice a year, been filled up. 
In order to bring the property into a state efficient for its object, 
a considerable expenditure was necessary. At a period not very 
distant, the revenue will be improved ; and the benefits of the in- 
stitution, already happily experienced, will, according to the wishes 
of the benevolent founder of it, be more and more extended. 

At the parochial and several of the other schools, the means of 
a liberal education are afl[brded. Comparatively few, however, 
now apply themselves to the learned languages. It may be stated, 
that there are generally in the parish at least twelve teachers em- 
ployed ; and that the number of persons attending them amounts 
on an average, to 600, and 400 at Sabbath schools. 

Poor. — When ability for regular labour, either from loss of 
health, or advanced age, is gone, and through improvidence or 
otherwise nothing of any importance has been laid up, the resource 
is an apartment in a town, and very commonly speedy destitution 
, follows. Not many years ago, there were in Stonehaven nine 
Friendly Societies, the number of the members of which a great 
part residenters in this parish amounted to nearly 1700. None 
of them now exist. These institutions were founded on unsound 
principles, liie contributions for their support bearing no proper 
.proportion to the allowances proposed to be granted. Their dis-

continuance has thrown on the poor's funds many sick widows, and 
orphans. But the principal cause of increased pauperism may be 
considered to have been the great change that has taken place in 
regard to manufactures. Formerly the females of every family 
were occupied in spinning and knitting ; the daughters of respec- 
table farmers plied their wheels industriously ; and even the old 
and infirm, in many cases, by knitting stockings, earned a conside- 
rable portion of their own maintenance. But all this is now near- 
ly over. 

At the end of the last century, it appears that the number of 
poor receiving supply was about 40, and that the provision for them 
amounted annually to about L.40. The provision afterwards be- 
came much greater, but the number of the poor increased, from 
causes already stated, and particularly from strangers coming into 
Stonehaven with limited property, on the exhaustion of which, 
after three years' residence, too short a period, a claim for aid 
was established. For a considerable period, the weekly church 
collections averaged L.lOO a-year. This sum, however, with the 
other means, did not keep pace with the prevailing wants. 
At last, it was resolved that there should be a statutory as- 
sessment. This measure has been in existence for two years ; 
and has produced the annual amount of L.400, at the rate of 
3d. per L. 1 on the real rental of proprietors, and 2d. on the 
means and substance of the other inhabitants. The weekly 
collections, as might be expected, have greatly fallen off. The 
number of poor on the roll, including lunatics, the support of 
whom in asylums has often borne very hard on the funds, is now 
about 110, who are supplied quarterly, monthly, weekly, or oc- 
casionally, according to their respective circumstances. They 
have the interest of L.50, a legacy from the late Sir Thomas 
Bannerraan, and share with the parish of Dunnottar in the inte- 
rest of L.200, the gift to the poor of Stonehaven, and immediate 
neio-hbourhood, of the late Mr Stevens of Broadland. There is 
also, under the charge of the minister and elders, property be- 
queathed by two sisters of the name of Duns. Until a house, 
forming part of that bequest, be disposed of, the amount of this 
benefaction cannot be ascertained ; but, it is hoped, that it will 
extend to L.500.

jijames. In the former Statistical Account of this parish, it was 

stated, for no better reason, so ftir as is now known, than that Ec- 
cleso-reig is nearly idem sonans with " Eccksia Gregorii," — that the 
ancient name is evidently of Latin origin, and probably derived from 
the dedication of the church to St Gregory the Great, or to some 
other Romish bishop or missionary of that name. Perhaps it may 
be more probably referred to the Gaelic, in which language, the 
words, Eaglaiscreacj, or gen. Eaglais-craige, signify " the church of 
the rock," and well describe the singularly picturesque situa- 
tion of the ancient church of the parish, — " the rock," forming 
the most prominent object in the picture, being a lofty sea-cliff, 
of nearly two miles in extent, under the shelter and close to 
the base of which, the " church" stood. No remains of the 
church now exist, but its site is marked by a church-yard, still 
used as the principal burying-ground in the parish. Towards 
the close of the last century, the parish came to be generally 
known by the name of St Cyrus, the original designation, as it ap- 
pears, of that district of the parish in which the modern church is

\ This clergyman, whose name was David Campbell, appears, according to M'od-

fined in 106.3," to have been the only clergyman in the " Presbytery of the Mearns," 
who did not conform to Prelacy at that period. 

The name Ecclesgreig, it may be mentioned, was at ODe time applied exclusively 
to that section of the parish, called, in an old charter of the lands of Kirksid", " the 
«cclesiastical lands of Kcclesgreig, alias Kirksyde."

situated, and conjectured to have been derived from the residence 
of a Romish ecclesiastic of that name on the adjacent lands of 
Criggie, or Mount Cyrus, where a field and a spring of water 
still retain the name of the saint. 

Situation, §-c.— The parish lies at the extreme southern angle 
of the Mearns, and is separated on the south-west side from the 
parishes of Montrose and Logiepert by the river North Esk, 
which here also marks the confines of the counties of Angus and 
Mearns. On the north-west, north, and north-east, it is bounded 
by the parishes of Marykirk, Garvock, and Benholme, and on the 
south-east, by the German Ocean. Its length, in a direction pa- 
rallel to the general line of the sea-coast, from the North-water 
bridge to the hill of Bridgeton, is about 5 miles ; its breadth at 
the former place, about 3 ; at the latter, about 2 ; and its area, 
about 14 square miles. Its figure is nearly that of a parallelo- 
gram. 

Surface, §c. — Part of the chain of low hills lying between the 
great valley of the Mearns and the sea, passes through the pa- 
rish. From the summit of Garvock to the sea-coast, the breadth 
of the chain is about four miles, and the descent from the former 
point, which is said to be from 800 to 1000 feet above the sea- 
level, is by an irregular succession of elongated little hills, which 
run nearly parallel to the axis of the range, that is, from north- 
east to south-west. At the western extremity of the parish, the 
continuity of the range is interrupted by the defile through which 
the North Esk flows, and again, near the eastern extremity, by 
another defile intersecting that portion of it lying within this pa- 
rish, between the hollow of Garvock and the sea. The hills of 
Bridgeton and Jackston,in the east, and of Morphy and Pitbeadlay, 
in the west, may be stated at about 500 feet high ; of Snadon, at 
450 ; and Brand's hill and Woodston hill, at 630 feet above the 
sea ; the last being the most prominent object in the parish, and 
situated near its centre. From the circumstance of most of these 
elevations being insulated from each other by deep valleys and ra- 
vines, the surface presents many rapid inequalities, and much 
pleasing diversity of outline. 

The coast, from the mouth of the North Esk to within half a 
mile of the fishing village of Johnshaven, is five miles in extent, and 
juts out into three low rocky promontories, the most southerly 
forming, with Montrose- Ness, the two headlands, between which 



ST CYRUS. 



271 



lies the fine crescent-like bay of Montrose. Behind these promon- 
tories, and removed in some parts, more or less, from the present 
limit of the highest tides, is a steep and almost continuous escarp- 
ment, varying from 50 to nearly 300 feet in height, the barrier, 
according to geologists, of the ancient ocean. This escarpment, 
is in several places a perpendicular cliff, and is prolonged with 
somewhat less elevation along the right bank of the North Esk, 
from its mouth to the junction of this parish with that of Mary- 
kirk. 

The only inlet for vessels on the coast is at Sea-greens, where 
a small harbour has been formed for the admission of the smallest 
class of coal-ships ; but it is too much exposed to the effects of 
easterly gales to be secure, and can only be approached in smooth 
vater. In northerly gales, when, from the configuration of 
the coast, it is found impossible for vessels to proceed in their 
course northward, the bay of Rockhall affords a convenient an- 
chorage; and there, it is no unusual sight to observe from twenty 
to thirty vessels moored under the shelter of the cliff. 

About a mile of the coast from the mouth of the river is lined 
with a flat beach of fine sand, held together by the usual sea- 
grasses; the remaining part of it, by belts of shingle, or fragments 
and exposed strata of low rocks, covered at low water with sea- 
weed, which has for many years been allowed to vegetate, undis- 
turbed by the kelp-maker. 

Temperature, Sfc. — Observations of the thermometer indicate a 
mean annual temperature of from 45° to 46° Fahrenheit. The 
mean level of the parish is about 300 feet above the sea, and its 
temperature must be considerably lower than that of the adjoining 
parish of Montrose. The springs in the parish give a range of 
47° in September, and 43" in March. With regard to the ge- 
neral aspect of the seasons on this part of the coast, it may be ob- 
served, that, on the cessation of the easterly winds, which are con- 
tinued in some seasons from the beginning of March to the mid- 
dle of June, and which, whether dry or moist, always occasion a 
keener sensation of cold than might be expected from the indica- 
tions of the thermometer, the first summer rains are usually the 
result of electrical changes ; that a much less depth of rain falls 
on this part of the coast, than in the immediate vicinity of the 
Grampians, during the summer months ; and that, while the spring 
and winter are distinguished by gloomy and often dismal weather, 



272 



KINCARUINESHIRE. 



the autumn is for the most part the most delightful season of the 
year. 

Hydrography.— The alluvial soil is of great depth over a large 
proportion of the surface, and springs are in consequence not fre- 
quent ; and not a little inconvenience and expense are occasioned 
from this cause, both as regards the supply of water for domestic 
purposes, and for inclosures. Wells not entirely perforating the 
clay give neither a large nor constant supply, nor of good quality. 
Trap rocks usually afford abundance of water, but always contain- 
ing a large quantity of lime ; and the vvhole of the springs from 
sandstone and clayey gravel are more or less impregnated with 
iron. One in particular, near the village of Milton, is saturated 
with iron, and had the reputation some years ago of working cures, 
or of alleviating the symptoms of various complaints. 

Each den of which there are six in the parish has its burn, 
pouring its inconstant stream into the North Esk, or into the 
ocean. The largest of these is that which rises on the heights of 
Garvock, and, collecting the waters from about eight square miles, 
issues through the romantic Den Fenella to the sea, near the east 
end of the parish, and is chiefly noticeable on account of the 
beauty of the scenery in the neighbourhood of a waterfall which 
occurs near its termination. The course of the burn in its upper 
part is through a wide ravine, with not a bush or tree to vary the 
uniformity of its uninteresting slopes ; below, it enters into abroad 
band of trap rock, through which it has channelled a deep and 
winding passage, and towards the termination of its accelerating 
progress to the sea, is precipitated in a cascade taking the adjuncts 
of trees and rocks into the account of no little interest and beauty. 
The Fall of Den Fenella is, in the Mearns, next in celebrity to 
the admired scenery of " the Burn," and has given occasion, as 
may be supposed, to many attempts at poetical as well as pictorial 
description,— banks and trees, chasms and crags, dark foliage and 
festoons of flowering plants, the furious gush of the waters, &amp;c. 
forming the chief ingredients in the description, and the prmcipal 
grouping in the picture. There are two handsome bridges across 
the den, one of which is directly over the fall, and about 120 feet 
above the pool into which the waters are poured, while the fall it- 
self is accomplished in a single perpendicular leap of 65 feet. 

The river North Esk, it has been already stated, flows along 
the western boundary of the parish, and marks the limits of the 
counties of Angus and Mearns. The course of the river, from its 



ST CYRUS. 



273 



source in the mountains of Angus to the sea, is about forty miles. 
Of the Mearns, it drains a surface equal in area to about ninety 
miles, and receives the waters of about 140 miles of the county of 
Angus. Its basin may thus be estimated at 230 square miles. Tak- 
ing the mean depth of rain over the district which the basin com- 
prehends at 28 inches, and its area as just noted, the volume of rain 
falling on it would be nearly 15,000 millions of cubic feet annually. 
In a mean state of the river in 1837, its breadth at the conflu- 
ence was 141 feet, mean depth 1| foot, and velocity per minute, 
110 feet. The annual discharge was therefore 12,228 millions cubic 
feet, leavino- a difference of about 2733 millions cubic feet, as the 
value of the evaporation and absorption. In 1826 the whole water 
of the river was carried away from many parts of its channel into 
the mill courses on its margin. In July 1835, and in April 1839, 
the discharge was reduced to about one-sixth or one-eighth of its 
average amount. From the nature of the materials composing 
the channel at and near the mouth of the river, its direction is 
subject to considerable changes. By one of these, two farms are 
at present disjoined from the parishes, of which they had ori- 
ginally formed, and still, quoad civilia, form a part ; and in the me- 
mory of not very old persons, the river poured its waters into the 
sea, at a point about two miles eastward of its present mouth. 
Embankments are in one or two places necessary to preserve the 
contiguous lowlands from heavy floods, which come down with 
greater suddenness and impetuosity, since the universal drainage of 
the cultivated land ; and a small portion of the haugh land next to 
the mouth of the river is guarded in like manner from the access 
of the higher spring tides, which are felt nearly two miles up the 
stream. 

Rocks. — These are old red sandstone and trap. Of the former, 
the upper division consists of beds of spotted silicious and cal- 
careous sandstones, beds of red clay, with and without nodules of 
concretionary limestone, called by the lime-workers the seed-bed ; 
layers of a calcareous conglomerate or gritstone ; and two layers 
of compact veined limestone, of from 8 to 14 feet thick. These 
have generally a slight dip eastward. The second division con- 
sists of a reddish micaceous sandstone, composed of grains of 
quartz and felspar, and a large portion of the matter of trap, to- 
gether with a conglomerate of rolled boulders of granite, jasper, 
&amp;c. The third division comprehends a series of fine-grained mi-

caceous gray flcagstones. All these rocks are well exposed in deep 
sections, and are observed to be directed in conformity with the 
axis of the range in which they are situated, and have, with the 
exception above noted, a considerable dip to the north-west. 
'2dly, Trap. The whole elevations in the parish are probably 
owing to the presence of this rock. It is found universally at the 
summit of every hill, and mound and ridge, presenting a more or 
less abrupt step near the top, on the south-east side, and round- 
ing off the hill in a convex sweep towards the north-west. It does 
not appear to have disturbed the lie of the sedimentary strata, 
with which it occurs interstratified occasionally, but for the most 
part conceals these rocks, by having been poured out over them 
from a number of separate vents throughout the parish. It con- 
tains often large fragmentary masses of the blue and green shales 
from below, which are scarcely distinguishable from the older 
clay-slates.-f- The varieties of trap observed in the parish are, i 
amygdaloid, greenstone, claystone, and a trap conglomerate, com- 
posed wholly of the matter of ancient trap rocks, in rounded no- 
dules of different porphyries. 

The imbedded minerals are, agates, agate-jasper, quartz white 
and brown, and occasionally in the form of a rough amethyst, 
zeolites, calcareous spar, rhomboidal, dog's tooth and satin, 
heavy-spar, green earth, and steatite. 

Outlying boulders are seen along the sea shore, and on the 
summits of the hills. They are principally granites, quartz, gneiss, 
and mica slates with garnets, none of these rocks being found 
in situ nearer than twenty miles. Some of the boulders are of 
enormous size. 

The action of the sea on the coast of this parish is noticed by 
Mr Lyell, Geol. Vol. i. p. 399, and particular reference is made 
to the destruction of the village of Milton of Mathers, by an in-

neighbourhood, into the error of supposing a seam of the ancient clay-slate orma-

road of the sea, towards the close of the last century, The facts 
ascertained from persons still livino-, and who were inhabitants of 
the village at the period referred to, are these : The village stood 
on a low beach, a little to the east of the headland of Rockhall. 
It was protected, on the other side, by a ledge of limestone rock, 
running across the bay in front of it, and acting as a break-water 
against the incursions of high tides, to which it was much expos- 
ed. This rock was quarried for lime, and as its removal proceed- 
ed, the sea was allowed to expend its fury on the beach. By this 
action, continued through several years, a large part of the vil- 
lage was carried away, and in order to check its further inroads, a 
stone rampart was erected, which is still kept up for the protection 
of that portion of the village which remains. The new vil- 
lage Tangleha, is built on the old line of the coast, a little to 
the south of Milton. Mr Lyell's narrative is given below. 

An illustration of the agency of running water is also derived, by 
Mr Lyell, from this parish. " In the bay of Montrose," he says, 
"we find the North Esk and the South Esk, rivers pouring an- 
nually into the sea large quantities of sand and pebbles, yet they 
have formed no deltas ; for the tides scour out the channels, and 
the current setting across their mouths, sweeps away all the ma- 
terials. Considerable beds of shingle, brought down by the North 
Ea, are seen along the beach." Eastward of the mouth of the 
river, there was, about sixty years ago, a broad range of bents, up- 
wards of a mile in extent. In subsequent years, this range was 
entirely carried away by the sea, and it is again gradually, but very 
perceptibly forming, by the addition of a fresh ridge of sand and 
sea-grasses, in the course of every five or six years. 

Soil. — The soil is very various ; but its general character is that 
of being rich and productive in a very high degree. There is a 
deep deposite of clay mingled with numerous small boulders and 
angular fragments of different rocks over a wide range of the pa- 
rish ; and, where this deposite exists, it would seem that the ferti- 

• " On the coast of Kincardineshire, an illustration was afforded at the close of 
the last century, of the effect of promontories in protecting a line of low shore. The 
village of Mathers, two miles south of Johnshaven, was built on an ancient shingle 
beach, protected by a projecting ledge of limestone rock. This was quarried for 
lime to such an extent, that the sea broke through, and, in 1795, carried away the 
whole village in one night, and penetrated 150 yards inland, where it has maintain- 
ed its ground ever since, the new village having been built farther inland, on the 
new shore."

lity of the soil had little or no relation to the rocks lying below. 
In some parts, the trap is close to the surface, and, in this case, 
the soil appears to derive its productive qualities, in a great 
measure, from the decomposition of that rock. This description 
of land is found chiefly in the southern division of the parish ; in 
the other sections of it, the clayey soil, for the most part, pre- 
vails. 

Zoology. — The list of mammiferous animals, exclusive of the 
common domesticated animals of the country, does not contain 
more than 20 of the 52 species indigenous to Great Britain. The 
most remarkable of these are, the stoat or ermine, found in Can- 
terland den, and the badger, said to be extinct in the vicinity of 
the Grampians, The hedgehog, formerly not observed in this 
district, is now common ; the polecat and otter are much less 
frequent. The fox and roe-deer are found, at present, in consider- 
able numbers. Seals and porpoises frequent the rocks and river- 
mouth, and individuals of the whale tribe are occasionally stranded 
on our shores. 

The species of native birds do not, so far as is at present ascer- 
tained, exceed .58, and nearly as many have been enumerated as 
occasional visitants. Of the former class may be noted, Falco 
pereffrimis, Numenius arquata, Totaicus calidris, Larus ridibundus. 
Sterna hirundo, and Anas Crecca. The latter class are chiefly 
aquatic birds, which frequent the bay and mouth of the river in 
immense numbers. Specimens have lately been shot in the parish 
of Ardea cinerea an accidental and rare variety distinguished by 
its white plumage, Sturnus roseus, and Coracias garrula.

Botany. — Some notices of the botany of this parish, contributed, 
among others, by the Rev. Mr Chrystall of Arbuthnott, are to be 
found in Dr Murray's Northern Flora. In general, the native 
vegetation of St Cyrus more resembles that of the parishes of 
Montrose and Craig, situated directly to the south of it, than that 
of the district of the Mearns, with which it is immediately connect- 
ed, the soil and rocks having a nearer affinity to those of the for- 
mer than of the latter; and, accordingly, not a few plants common 
to this with the southern parishes, either entirely disappear, or 
their distribution is much less extensive, on advancing a little 
northward beyond the limits of this parish. In the upland parts, 
adjoining to Garvock, few or no plants are observed which seem 
worthy of notice, except, perhaps, Mmyanthes trifoliata, Parnassia 
palustris, Trollius Europcpus, and Anagallis tenella, which are, by 
no means, uncommon in the neighbourhood ; but, in the more 
shady dens, on the banks of the north Esk, and particularly along 
the base and in the recesses of the cliffs of St Cyrus, where there 
is a genial exposure to the south, the vegetation of native plants 
• is luxuriant and beautiful. Among these, may be enumerated the 
following, which are found associated with the gray sandstone, but 
chiefly with the trap formation : 

On moist or marshy ground, — Valeriana officinalis, Alisma 
Plantago, several species of Epilobium, Aira aquatica, Aquilegia 
vulgaris, with numerous Carices, among which maybe specified C. 
dioica, C. distans, C. intermedia, C. riparia, and C. pendula, the last 
very sparingly in Den Fenella; and Lemna trisulca, of which no 
specimen appears to have been met with in the north of Scotland 

' Several specimens of which have been caught lately.

prior to 1837, when it was discovered by Mr Alexander Croall of 
Montrose, in the dam of Stone of Morphy. 

On banks, fields, and by way-sides, — Primula verig, with its 
hybrid relative P. elatior, Anagallis arvensis, Convolvulus arvensis, 
Gentiana campestris, Saxifraga granulata, Pimpinella saxifraga, 
Agrimonia Eupatoria, Antirrhinum linaria, Cardamine amara, 
Sisgmbrium Sophia, Carduus acanthoides, and Avena alpina. 

In salt marshes, — Scirpus ma.ritimus, Polamogeton pusillus, and 
Aster tripolium ; and on dry, sandy, or gravelly banks in the neigh- 
bourhood of the sea, Phleum arenarium and nodosum, Poa mari- 
tima, Elymiis arenarius, very abundantly along the outer range of 
the bents from the mouth of the north Esk eastward, with Arundo 
arenaria, Triticum junceum, ix\di Carex arenaria ; Hyoscyamus ni- 
gpv, Viola finvicornis, Salsola Kali, several species of Arenaria, 
Origanum vulgare, Cakilc maritima, Eryngium viaritimum, and 
Lithospermum maritimum, of which two last plants, though said to 
have been met with, some years ago, not a single specimen can now 
be found in the parish. 

In the shady dens of Fenella and Morphy, — Poa nemoralis, 
Festuca sylvatica, F. elatior; Bromus gigunteus, B. asper, B. steri- 
lis, Asperula odorata, Galium boreale. Allium vineale, A. ursinum, 
A. oleraceum, Paris quadrifolia, and Adoxa Moschatellina. 

In the recesses and on the sloping sides of the cliffs of St Cy- 
rus, — Campanula glomerata, Dianthus deltoides, Silene nutans, La- 
thyrus sylvestris, Vicia lutea, V. sylvatica, V. latliyroides, V. angus- 
tifolia, Solidago Virgaurea, Pyrethrum maritimum, Eupatorimn 
cannabiniim, Carlina vulgaris, Echium vulgare, Geranium pratense, 
G. sanguineum, Tragupogon pratensis, and Trifolium scabrum. 
This last was observed by Mr James Cruickshank of Dumfries, 
in 1838, on the peninsula of the Kaim of Mathers, and also on a 
spot about half a mile westward, and, though common in England, 
- is only known to exist in other two stations in Scotland, the 
nearest of which is on the coast of Haddington. 

Plantations. — The whole of the woods in the parish have been 
planted, and cover a surface of somewhat more than 300 acres. 
They consist of the usual sorts of evergreen trees, mingled with 
the hard-woods, ash, elm, beech, and a few oaks. The soil is 
not unfivvourable to the growth of any of the sorts of trees em- 
ployed in the formation of plantations ; but, being exposed to the 
influences of the sea breeze, their growth is necessarily slow, 
though, on this very account, they are said to produce timber ot

superior durability. The mansion-houses in the parish are gene- 
rally surrounded by clumps of hard-wood trees of considerable age 
and size ; and, in one instance, on an elevated spot, close by the 
sea shore, there is a goodly collection of ash and other deciduous 
trees, which appear to have withstood for centuries the fury of the 
eastern gales. The hill of Woodston was planted about eijhty 
years ago, and yields excellent timber, though of small size. At 
a later period, the plantations of Mount Cyrus were laid oift, and 
have been considerably extended by the present proprietor. The 
plantations of Lauriston are just about to be further enlarged, by 
the addition of a pretty large extent on the north side of the es- 
tate. 

II. — Civil History. 

Land-owners. — The land-owners in this parish are, Mr Lyall 
of Lauriston ; Mr Dingwall Fordyce of Brucklay, proprietor of 
Woodston ; Mr Grant of Mount Cyrus ; Mr Fitzraaurice Scott 
of Comeston ; Mr J, R. Scott of Stone of Morphy, a minor ; 
Mr Graham of Morphy ; the Earl of Kintore ; Captain Orr of 
Bridgeton ; Mr Grahame Straton of Kirkside ; Mr T. Newman 
Farquhar of Jackston ; and Sir Alexander Ramsay of Balmain, 
Bart., proprietor of Muirhead. 

Parochial Registers. — The oldest minute book of the kirk-ses- 
sion commences with the date May 24, 1696, and the register of 
baptisms and marriages with that of April of the same year. Both 
have been continued with some irregularity to the present time. 
There are blanks in the minutes from 1732 to 1744, from 1791 
to 1797, and from 1810 to 1816; and the volume containing the 
register of marriages, from 1776 to 1834, appears to have been 
lost. 

Antiquities. — The Castle of Lauriston, which was situated to- 
wards the east end of the parish, and about a mile from the sea 
shore, appears to have been a place of some note in ancient times. 
It was called by Lord Hailes the " Fortress of Lauriston." It was 
built in the tenth century, and sustained repeated sieges by the 
troops of Edward III. In 1336, it was captured and gariisoned 
by that monarch, and, towards the termination of that year, was 
recaptured and demolished by the Guardian Murray, along with 
" the fortresses of Kineff and Dunoter" Hailes's Annals, p. 191, 
and Guthrie's History. The castle and lands of Lauriston con- 
tinued in the possession of the Straton family for a period of 400 
years prior to 1695, when the estate was sold to " Sir.Tohn Falconer

and Elizabeth Trent, his wife," from whose representatives it was 
purchased, about fifty years ago, by its late proprietor, Mr Brand. 
At that time, the only parts of the building remaining were, a por- 
tion of a very strong circular wall, which had formed the western 
enclosure of the castle, a tower of a square form at one extremity 
of this wall and built on a projecting ledge of the precipice, along 
the edge of which the wall was carried, and a portion of the an- 
cient chapel. These remains of the fortress are preserved, by 
having been incorporated, some years after the purchase of the 
lands by Mr Brand, into a spacious and elegant modern mansion. 
The Kaim of Mathers, or camp of Mathers, so called from its 
situation on the lands of Mathers, is a ruin on a rocky and almost 
inaccessible peninsula, overlooking the sea, about a mile and a- 
half southward of the house of Lauriston. The isthmus, connect- 
ing the rock with the mainland, was guarded by two rows of bat- 
tlements, one of which still remains in a state of considerable pre- 
servation. There are traces of building around the greater part 
of the rock ; and, on its sea-ward extremity, there are the remains 
of a square tower, which can only be approached by a leap over 
a chasm of about 60 feet in depth. This place is supposed to 
have been the residence of certain of the ancestors of Mr Barclay 
of Ury, and to have been used as a place of retreat, by one of 
that family, in the time of James I. The tradition respecting it 
is connected with the story of the death of Melville, Sheriff of the 
Mearns, and appears, according to Sir Walter Scott, to have had 
some foundation in fact ; while, according to the author of the 
Agricultural Survey of the Mearns, " the origin of the Kaim of 
Mathers is generally cited in testimony of the truth of the extra- 
ordinary manner of Melville's death, just in the same way as Queen 
Fenella's journey from Fettercairn to Den Fenella, on the tops 
of the trees, is alleged, as proof positive, that the country was then 
thickly covered with wood."t 

• The lands of Lauriston and Easter Mathers were purchased this year by Mr 
Lyall, fiom Miss Watson, to whom they had fallen, as heir-at-law, on the death of 

Mr Brand in 1839. , , r j c-

is not without a parallel in the real history of Scotland. The same extraordinary 
mode of cookery was actually practised fwrrcsco refcrcnsj, upon the body of a She- 
riff of the Mearns. This person, whose name was Melville of Glenbervie, bore his 
faculties so harshly, that he became detested by the barons of the county. Re.tc- 
rated complaints of his conduct having been made to James L, or, as others say, to 
the Duke of Albany, the monarch answered, in a moment of unguarded impatience

Another fortress in the parish was the Castle of Morphy, on the 
property of Francis Graham, Esq. and said to have been a resi- 
dence belonging to the Noble family of that name. It is believed 
to have been a place of some strength, was defended by a wall, 
ditch, and drawbridge, and occupied a commanding position on the 
brink of a romantic ravine uniting with the valley of the North 
Esk. Its site is now a ploughed field. 

The Stone of Morphy. — This is an obelisk situated on the lands 
of the same name, in the western division of the parish. With 
reference to it, the writer of the former Account says, that it is 
difficult to determine whether it had been erected to preserve the 
memory of some gallant warrior of the name of Graham, to which 
Noble family the lands of Morphy originally belonged, or whether 
it may be a remnant of a Druidical temple ; while, at the same 
time, he appears not to have been aware of the existence of a tra- 
dition, which says, that it was erected in memory of a son of Ca- 
mus, or some other important personage in his army, who was kill- 
ed here in an engagement with the Scots, after the defeat and 
death of the Danish leader at Panbride. The Danes, on that 
event, immediately retreated northward, and, according to the tra- 

and Pittarrow, decoyed Melville to the top of the hill of Garvock, under pretence of 
a grand hunting party. Upon this place, still called the Sheriff's Pot, the barons 
had prepared a fire and a boiling cauldron, into which they plunged the unlucky 
Sheriff. After he was ' sodden,' as the King termed it, for a sufficient time, the 
savages, that they might literally observe the Royal mandate, concluded the scene 
of abomination, by actually partaking of the hell-broth. The tliree lairds were out- 
lawed for the offence, and Barclay, one of their number, to screen himself from jus- 
tice, erected the Kaim i. e. the fortress of Mathers. The Laird of Arbuthnott is 
said to have eluded the Royal vengeance, by claiming the benefit of the law of the 
clan Macduff. A pardon, or perhaps a deed of replegiation, founded on that law, is 
said to be still extant among the records of the Viscount of Arbuthnott." 

 An illustration of the popular superstitions of Angus-shire is derived from the 
building of this castle, in a poem by Dr Jamieson in the Minstrelsy of the Border, in 
which the exploits of the water-kelpy are recorded. From time immemorial to that 
of " John o' Arnha'," the water-kelpy has, according to popular belief, been an in- 
habitant of the North Esk, and the Castle of Morphy, being in the vicinity of that 
part of the river where he was thought to be most frequently seen, it is said that he 
afforded most material service in its erection. A stanza of the poem referred to is as 
follows : — 

When Morphy's laird his biggin rear'd, 

I carryit aw the stanes, 
And mony a chiel has heard me squeal 
For sair birz'd back and banes, &amp;c. 
In a note by the writer, it is said, " The water-kelpy celebrated the evciit of car- 
rying stones for the building of the castle in rhyme; and that for a long time after 
he was often heard to cry with a doleful voice, 
Sair back and sair banes, 
Carrying the Laird o' Morphy's stanes. 
To which a later edition of the history has added, 

The Laird o' Morphy will never thrive, 
So long as Kelpy is alive.

cUtion, encountered the Scots near the Stone of Morphy ; and that 
a battle had there taken phice, is probable, from the immense num- 
ber of stone-coffins, containing human bones, which have been 
found, particularly in and near a field called " the sick man's 
shade," close by the stone. The farm adjoining that on which 
the pillar stands, bears the name of Comeston, or, as it is written 
in old records, Camuston. The names of Wardroperton and 
Scotstown, two farms bordering on the latter, seem to indicate the 
position of the Scottish army ; and a den quite close to the pillar 
is called Dannie's den, which seems easily convertible into Da- 
nish den. The form of the stone, which is a plain unsculptured 
obelisk of 13 feet in height above the ground, and tapering from 
4 feet in breadth at the base, to 2 at the top, seems also to corre- 
spond with the description of other Danish monuments in different 
parts of Scotland. 

Tlie Camp of Pitbeadlay. — On the most prominent part of the 
hill of Pitbeadlay i. e. the grave of the house on the hill, there is 
a small circular camp, which, within a few years, was in a state of 
tolerable preservation. It is nearly forty yards in diameter, and 
had a ditch, and a wall of turf and stones, and a central building 
constructed of stone. Some remains of human bones were lately 
exhumed within its inclosure. There is, however, no tradition 
connected with it. 

Den Fenella. — This place takes its name from Fenella, daugh- 
ter of the Earl of Angus, who, on attempting to escape from her 
castle of Kincardine, in the parish of Fordoun, after the murder 
of Kenneth III., was overtaken here by her pursuers, and put to 
death. This is the traditionary account given by John Major, in 
his Antiquities of the Mearns. 

Some notices from the session records, regarding the state of 
the parish in the years 1715 and 1716, are transcribed below. 

 " October 9, 1713. This day Mr John Lamy, sometime prelaticall incumhent 
here, did violently intrud himself upon this church and parish, being assisted by ane 
armed band of ruffians brought from other parishes, especially from Fernall and Kin- 
naird, who did violently deforce our minister when he was coming to perform divine 
worship, as he had done twenty years before ; but such was the fury of the mob. that 
they would not suffer him to come near the churchyard, Mr Lamy in the meantime 
being possest in the pulpit, so that he was forced to retire to his own house, where 
he preached to such as could have access to hear him." There is a blank in the re- 
cord from this date to February 5, 1716, when it thus proceeds: — " This day, the 
rebclls having all past by this church about two a clock in the afternoon, the minis- 
ter ordered the lell to be rung, and repossest himself again of his pulpit, to the great 
satisfaction of all present; and there being but few that day in the church, it being 
about three a clock befor divine worship could be begun, the minister lectured from 
the 3d Psalm so long as the day would perraitt." " February 12, 1716. This day,

The Stratons of Lauriston.—'' The Straitens of Laurieston were 
a good family in the Mearns, but they are now decayed, though 
some Straitens, particularly Straiton of Kirkside, and some of 
Laurieston, are standing." Nisbet's Heraldry. A branch of the 
Lauriston family obtained a charter of the ecclesiastical lands of 
« Ecclesgreig, alias Kirksyde," in 158-2. " Alexander de Strai- 
ton de Ltuira°nston," fell with several of his sons at the battle of 
Harlaw, in 1411. " George Stratoun of Lauranston" was one 
of the first persons of rank and respectability who embraced the 
reformed doctrines, anno 1540. He sat in Parliament for the 
shire of Kincardine in 1567. His son, « Sir Alexander Stratoun, 
Knight," also sat in Parliament in 1597; and, in 1605, held the 
situation of Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly, 
which met in Aberdeen in that year. The conduct of " Lauries- 
ton" on that and subsequent occasions is adverted to by the diffe- 
rent historians of the church. See Calderwood's History, 
M'Crie's Life of Andrew Melville, and Cook's History of the 
Church of Scotland. 

Mansion- Houses. — There are mansion-houses on the estates of 
Bridgeton, Lauriston, Mount Cyrus, and Kirkside, all of late erec- 
tion. None of them, however, are at present occupied by their 
proprietors, with the exception of that of Mount Cyrus. The 

the parish being full of Swees and Dutch souldiers, the people could not leave their 
houses, so that there was this day in the church some Swees officers, and some heads 
of families. The minister lectured from Exodus xiv. 13 and 14, v." for the Egyp- 
tians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see no more for ever. " The Brigadier 
had sent word to the minister that he could not stay above three-quarters of ane 
-hour." " February 19, 1716. The parish also this day being thronged with Swees 
and Dutch souldiers, only some few heads of families were in the church. They 
could not stay from their houses for fear they should be spoiled and plundered, as 
many were that day."

mansion-houses on the other estates are in the occupancy of the 
respective tenants of the lands. The house of Bridgeton is plea- 
santly situated on a rising ground near the eastern extremity of 
the parish. There is an excellent garden attached to it ; and, 
from the regular disposition of the grounds, and some belts of 
wood lately planted, the place has altogether an appearance of 
much neatness. The mansion-house of Lauriston, a little to the 
west of Bridgeton, occupies the site of the ancient fortressof Lau- 
riston. It is a spacious, elegant building, erected some years 
after the purchase of the lands, by their late proprietor, Mr Brand, 
and united, as before-mentioned, to a portion of the old castle, 
which was then standing. The situation, on the brink of a per- 
pendicular precipice, overhanging a deep wooded ravine, is exceed- 
ingly romantic, and the walks, approaches, bridges, and planta- 
tions by which the grounds are adorned, render this place one of the 
most delightful residences in the county. The mansion-house of 
Mount Cyrus, the property of Mr Grant, stands on a rising ground 
to the north-west of the church and village of St Cyrus. It is a 
substantial and graceful building, with a neat approach and ex- 
tensive lawn in front, and, with its young and thriving plantations, 
by which it is on all sides surrounded, imparts an agreeable aspect 
to this part of the parish. The house of Kirkside, which, with 
the estate, lately came into the possession of Mr Graham Stra- 
ton, on the death of his relative. Lieutenant- General Sir Joseph 
Stratoii, is a substantial modern building, situated near the southern 
extremity of the parish, and commanding a prospect of the bay, 
town, and basin of Montrose, with the rich and diversified scenery 
around. 

The materials employed for building, and of which the parish 
affords an abundant supply, are, for the most part, the red sand- 
stones of Lauriston and Woodston. Some of the older buildino-s 
are constructed of the sandstones of the Whitecraig, others of the 
trap rocks of the cliff of Kirkside, and a few houses on the west 
side qf the parish, are built chiefly of the flagstones and shales of 
the den of Canterland. 

III. — Population. 
Since the date of Dr Webster's enumeration, there have been 
ten returns of the population. The returns from the years 
1781 to 1792 inclusive, are copied from the former Statistical 
Account. They appear to have been made by the incumbents of

the parish, and in tlie last of these years, tlie name of every indi- 
vidual, with his place of residence, occupation, and age, is entered 
in the minute-book of the kirk-session. 

The following table shows the state of the population from the 
time of Dr Webster's account to 1841. 

Years. Population. Years. ' Population.

The population appears to have remained nearly stationary 
since the year 1798. The larger returns from 1781 to that year 
are accounted for, by the circumstance of the lime-quarries of 
Milton and Mathers being then in full operation, and the diminu- 
tion in 1798, by the removal from the parish of a number of fa- 
milies dependent on the prosecution of these works, which, about 
that period, were partially, and not long after, entirely abandoned.

There are in the parish, 6 grocers, 1 cooper, 5 house and cart- 
wrights, 7 blacksmiths, 1 turner, 4 corn or flour millers, 9 shoe- 
makers, 5 gardeners, 30 persons occasionally employed as hand- 
loom weavers, 4 tailors, 1 slater, 1 saddler, 3 whitefishers, 51 
salmon-fishers, 1 farrier, 9 masons, 1 1 carters, and 1 1 stone-ma- 
sons. A surgeon resides in the Kirktown of St Cyrus. 

The introduction of spirits by the Highland traders, so prevalent 
some years ago, has been entirely suppressed ; and poaching for 
game has become much less common of late years, from the ac- 
tive measures employed by a game-association, instituted among 
the principal landed gentlemen of the county, for the punishment 
of this species of delinquency. The practice of poaching for sal- 
mon still prevails, as, notwithstanding the care with which the river 
is guarded, fresh salmon may, it is said, be privately obtained- at 
all times during the close season, from parties in the town and 
neighbourhood of Montrose, by whom this illicit trade is car- 
ried on.

The extent of undivided comnnon is stated at about 200 acres. 
It is, at present, together with the greater proportion of the waste 
lands, almost entirely valueless. Much, however, might be done 
in the way of planting and cultivation, there being but very few 
acres in the parish which are not fitted for these purposes. The 
usual sorts of trees planted are ash, beech, plane, elm, birch, 
larch, Scotch and silver fir. A great variety of other trees have 
been introduced into the policies of Lauriston, and have been found 
to succeed well. From the preceding statement of the number of 
acres under cultivation in 1807 and 1837, it will be observed, that 
about 800 acres of land have been brought into tillage, during the 
thirty years intervening between these dates, the rate of improve- 
ment being about one-quarter of an acre per cent, annually.

Wages, Rates of Labour, Prices, Breeds of Live-Stock. — It is 
unnecessary to enter into any detail regarding these, as the infor- 
mation already published in accounts of contiguous parishes is a[:- 
plicable in every particular to these matters, in regard to this pa- 
rish. It may just be added, with reference to the price of grain, 
that, though the sale is effected nominally by measure, the farmer 
is in fact paid according to the weight of the article, a standard 
weight being assumed for the bushel, and the price ascending or de- 
scending with every pound weight above or below the fixed point. 
Since the introduction of this mode of computation, a considera- 
ble deterioration has taken place in the value of inferior land. 

It is not customary in this parish to graze cattle or sheep by 
the head. There are scarcely any sheep kept permanently in the 



288 



KINCARDINESHIRE. 



coast district of the Mearns. During winter, flocks from the 
mountains are pastured on the lowlands, at a fixed re'nt for the 
season ; and grass enclosures are rented by the acre for summer 
grazing of cattle. 

Husbandry. — The alternations of cropping usually adopted are 
the fourth and fifth-shifts, according to the character of the soil, 
and the command of manure. The proportion of land employ- 
ed, about thirty years ago, in the cultivation of wheat, was very 
nearly one-tenth part of the whole arable surface, and this pro- 
portion amounted to about two-fifths of the entire surface sown 
with wheat within the county. At present, about one sixtieth part 
of the arable land in the parish is laid out in the production of this 
kind of grain. Beans, pease, and barley also, enter less exten- 
sively into the system of cropping than formerly, while the breadth 
sown with potatoes is relatively greater than that in any parish in 
the county. Flax is not now cultivated. Barley and oats are 
sown in the proportion of about one acre of the former to three 
of the latter. On some of the upland farms, no barley is sown 
at all. 

Leases are, for the most part, held at a fixed rent in money, 
and for a period of nineteen years. The farm-dwellings are sub- 
stantial and comfortable, and the farm-offices usually slated, and 
fitted up in a very superior manner. 

The lands have been, in most instances, subdivided with regu- 
larity ; but there are few enclosures, hedge-rows, or belts of wood, 
excepting in the immediate vicinity of the principal mansion- 
houses, and the richest tracts of land in the parish are destitute of 
shelter and permanent fence of any description. In these respects, 
and in t'he want of more capacious and comfortable cottages for 
the farm-labourer, the chief obstacles to improvement appear to 
be experienced. 

• Among the names mentioned in connexion with the earlier agricultural im- 
provements of the county are those of William Graham, Esq. of Morphy, in this pa- 
rish ; Sir Alexander Ramsay of Balmain, whose improvements were more or less ex- 
tended over all the lands of which he was proprietor, including those of Snadon, in 
this parish, and Robert Scott, Esq. of Dunninald, whose improvements on the farm 
of Milton, also in this parish, form, with a single exception, the earliest instance on 
record of the introduction of the modern system of husbandry into the county. Mr 
Scott became, in 1750, tenant of that farm, and of the lime-works on it, and from 
that period carried on his improvements with so much vigour and success, that his 
plans came to be generally adopted throughout the parish, and in the short space of 
twenty years, the rent of land rose from 10s. and 15s. to L.l, 10s., and in some m- 
stances to L.2 an acre. More recently, the state of the parish, as to agricultural im- 
provement, is described as having been such, that " though there are two or three pa-

Quarries. — Trap or scurdy rock is obtained at the Expense of 
quarrj'ing and carriage, in various parts of the parish, and there 
are several quarries of sandstone, which yield an abundant supply 
of good building materials. The stone of the Whitecraig on the 
lands of Kirkside, is a white sandstone, well fitted on account of 
its beauty and durability for ornamental architecture, but too ex- 
pensive, from its hardness, for general use in building. The quar- 
ries of Woodston and Lauriston afford the principal supply of 
sandstone to the district within a circuit of ten miles. The stone 
is a reddish soft sandstone, easily wrought, and very durable. Both 
quarries, which are within a few yards of each other, though on 
different properties, are at present in the hands of one tenant, who 
holds a kind of monopoly of the trade. The value of stones ex- 
ported from these quarries, is estimated at from L.800 to L.IOOO 
a year. Prices at the quarries as under : 6d. and 8d. per load of 
rubble; 4d. and upwards, according to size, per foot, for blocks ; 
ridge-stones, 6d. per running foot; pavement, 3d. per square foot, 
dressed ; carriage to Montrose, six miles and a half, 3s. per ton of 
■ 12 cubic feet. 

The tile-stones of Morphy were at one time used for roofing, 
but after a trial, were dis,continued, having been found to yield so 
rapidly to the influences of the atmosphere. 

The most extensive lime-works in the county were at East Ma- 
thers, in this parish. They are said to have been wrought for a 
very long period, and to have produced, during a space of eighty 
years, an average of 20,000 bolls annually. The limestone lay, 
in detached masses, along a portion of the sea shore, and was for 
a time quarried at a trifling expense, but the rock passing inland 
under a deep bank, the labour of mining became at last so expen- 
sive, as to cause an entire suppression of the works about the year 
3836, for several vears before which time not more than 1000 
bolls h aving been burnt annually. 

Fisheries. — There are several very valuable salmon fisheries 
connected with the properties of Stone of Morphy, Comeston 
and Kinnaber, Kirkside, Woodston, and West Mathers. The 
fishing belonging to the last mentioned estate was alienated from 
it some years since, and now belongs to Mr Grant of Mount Cy- 
rus. The proprietor of Lauriston also derives a small revenue 
from a fishing lately established on the coast adjacent to his lands. 

risl.es in the county that have a g.eater propction of a.able land, there arc none in 
which the powers of cultivation are more vigorously exerted, or in which the lauds iu 
general yield a greater return, or are let at a higher vent."

Tlic whole of these fishings, which comprehend the entire extent of 
the sea-coast, and of the North Esk river, from its mouth to the 
boundary of the lands of Morphy, brought, in 1837, a rental of 
L.359]. The fishing of Comeston and Kinnaber includes part 
of the river and sea coast, and the latter property being in the pa- 
rish of Montrose, a moiety of the value of this fishing, which is 
the joint property of the respective proprietors, falls to be deduct- 
ed from the above rental, and the remainder, or L. 2991, was the 
revenue in the year referred to, from the fishings connected with 
this parish. Reports of the number of fish caught at some of the 
stations are given in the minutes of evidence before a committee of 
the House of Commons in 1825. So many as 3000 fish, includ- 
ing salmon, grilses, and trouts, are said to have been caught in one 
day in July 1835. The number of men employed is about sixty; 
wages, from 8s. to 15s. a week, with fish-money, or an additional 
allowance according to the number caught. Prices of salmon vary 
from 8d. to 2s. 6d. per lb. ; and the greater part of the fish is 
transported in ice to the Edinburgh and London markets. 

There has been, for many years, a small white-fishery carried 
on by the inhabitants of the village of Milton. In 1781, the vil- 
lage contained 46 families, comprising 170 individuals, and had 
three boats, with six men to each, engaged in the white-fishing. 
But in 1792, the village was, as before mentioned, partially de- 
stroyed, and the fishermen were, at the same time, deprived of 
their harbour. Since that time, not more than one or two small 
boats have been employed, and the population of Milton, with 
that of Tangleha, is now reduced to fifty souls. One boat is still 
engaged in the white-fishing, and affords support to two or three 
families. 

Produce.— For the purpose of arriving at an approximate value 
of the raw produce, it has been attempted to ascertain, with as 
much precision as possible, the number of acres under each kind 
of crop, and the average produce of each acre. The following 
results have been obtained : 

Grain crop. — 

Wheat, 103 imperial acres, 4 quarters per acre, 412 qrs.

In this account is not included the value of hill and sheep pas- 
ture, and of gardens, which has not been ascertained. 
• The value of disposable produce, including grain of all sorts, 
potatoes, hay, cattle, pigs, poultry, and dairy produce, has been 
estimated at from L.l 7,000 to L.l 8,000. With regard to dairy 
produce, it may be mentioned, that, on a small farm in the parish, 
there has been a manufacture of sweet-milk cheeses, to a consi- 
derable extent, for a good many years, which originated under the 
patronage of James Andrew Sandilands, Esq. of Aberdeen, and 
the demand for them, under the name of Canterland cheese, from 
various quarters in England and Scotland, is much beyond what 
can be supplied. 

Manufactures. — About thirty hand-looms are employed in the 
manufacture of coarse linen during winter. In summer the num- 
ber is less, several hands being then more profitably engao-ed in 
salmori-fishinof. ° 

V — Pauochial Economy. 
Market-Town.— The nearest market- town is Montrose, distant 
three miles from the south-western boundary of the parish, and 
five and a-half miles from the village of St Cyrus. 



292 



KINCARDINESHIRE. 



Villages. — The village or kirktown of St Cyrus consists of about 
forty houses, for the most part straw-thatched cottages, disposed 
without much regard to neatness or regularity around the parish 
church. The situation is exceedingly damp and exposed, and ap- 
pears to possess no other advantage than that of showing off the 
church, which has rather a respectable appearance, when seen from 
a distance. Burnside and Roadside form a line of cottages along 
the north side of the public road, at a short distance from the 
Kirktown ; and, a little to the west of these, there is another ham- 
let, inhabited, as the others generally are, by feuars and crofters. 
The united population of these villages, which are included within 
a circle of one mile from the parish church, amounts to about one- 
fourth of the whole population of the parish. 

Means of Communication. — The parishioners have now the be- 
nefit of a branch post-office at Bush of Woodston, before the esta- 
blishment of which there was often an irregular and expensive 
conveyance of letters from Montrose, and there is a delivery of 
letters throughout the parish daily. Two mail-coaches pass daily 
to and from Edinburgh and Aberdeen. Steam-boats touch four 
times a week on their passage to and from Inverness, Aberdeen, 
lieith, &amp;c. at the village of Johnshaven, which is half a mile distant 
from the eastern extremity of the parish ; and there is a commu- 
nication between Montrose and Newhaven twice a week by steam, 
during the summer, and by sailing vessels during winter. The 
public roads and bridges are generally in good condition. The 
bridge across the north Esk, on the line of the great north road 
which passes through the parish, a distance of five miles, was built 
in 1775, at a cost of L.6500 ; and a small but handsome bridge, 
on the same line, was erected in 1817, at an expense of L.600. 
The small harbour of Sea-greens, in the vicinity of the lime-works, 
is capable of admitting vessels of 50 or 60 tons burden. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church, which was built in 1785 to 
contain 870 feet of sitting room, or one foot of space for every two 
persons then in the parish, was enlarged in 1830, and now can ac- 
commodate about 50 per cent, of the population, at the rate of 15 
inches to each person. The situation is more accessible by the 
major part of the parishioners than that of the ancient parish 
church, being about three-quarters of a mile to the north of it, and 
at a short distance from the turnpike road. It is, however, at an 
inconvenient distance from many families both in the eastern and 
western districts of the parish, some of whom have to travel to it 



ST CYRUS.

three and four miles by indirect roads. The sittings in the older 
part of the church are set apart to the heritors and their tenants, 
and such seats as the latter may not require, are let to feuars and 
other inhabitants, in some instances at a nominal rent, and in 
others at Is. 6d. or more for a sitting. The newer part of the 
church has not yet been divided. There are two services during 
six months, from April to September, which are usually well at- 
tended. The average number of male heads of families is 225, 
and the whole number of communicants 700. 

The manse was built in 1797. It has since undergone some 
slight alterations, and is now in good repair. The glebe is four 
Scotch acres in extent, including the sites of the manse, offices, 
and garden, and may be valued at L.IO per annum. The stipend 
is 17 chalders, half meal and half barley, and with L.IO for com- 
munion elements, amounted, by the fiars prices of 1837, to L.241. 

In the year 1798, according to a census of the population re- 
corded in the session minutes, there were, in the parish, 1 5 fami- 
lies of Seceders, 2 families of Bereans, and 8 families of Episco- 
palians, comprising in all 112 individuals. Since then, the num- 
ber of Dissenters from the Establishment has been very much 
diminished. In 1837, there were only 27 individuals in the parish 
who were not in communion with the Established Church. Twenty- 
three of these were persons belonging to a congregation in the neigh- 
bouring village of Johnshaven, in connection with the United Asso- 
ciate Synod ; 3 were Bereans ; and 1 Episcopalian. There are, 
besides, one or two individuals who do not profess to be in com- 
miinion with any body of Christians. Since 1 837, one family of 
Seceders, consisting of 1 1 individuals, has come to reside in the 
parish. 

A parochial association for religious purposes, under the direc- 
tion of the minister and elders, was instituted in 1836. The con- 
tributions in that and the following year, for the Assembly's India 
Mission, and Highland Schools, amounted together to L.BO In 
1838, the sum collected for the same objects was L.30, Contri- 
butions of nearly equal amount have since been made for the 
other schemes of the Assembly; and the collections at the church 
doors, for charitable purposes, average about L.15 a-year. 

Education,~There are at present six schools in the parish, be- 
sides the parochial school. Five of these are conducted by fe- 
males, who teach reading, sewing, and knitting, and, in one case, 
writing; and one is conducted by a male teacher, who is qualified

to Instruct in reading, writing, and arithmetic. There are usually 
classes in the parochial school, for geography, Latin, and French 
besides the branches ordinarily taught in country schools. The 
master of the parochial school has a salary of L.33, school fees, 
amounting to L.30 a-year ; a commodious house, much larger than 
•what is considered the legal provision ; a garden, and separate 
school-room. The private schools are all unendowed, and appear 
to be kept up without any subscription by the parents of children 
attending them, or by others, beyond what is paid to the teachers 
in the shape of school fees. The attendance at the parish school 
is from 60 to 90, occasionally upwards of 100, for whose proper 
accommodation the. room is much too small. The average num- 
ber of children in constant attendance at all the schools is 200, 
which is exactly one-eighth part of the whole population of the 
parish. 

There are Sabbath schools at five different stations in the pa- 
rish, under the conduct of the assistant minister, and other indi- 
viduals, who take an interest in the religious instruction of the 
young. There are also classes kept by the assistant minister, on 
the afternoon and evening of Sabbath, for the instruction of male 
and female servants, each of which is attended by from 30 to 40 
persons. All the young persons in the parish above seven years 
of age, are in the course of being instructed in reading and writ- 
ing. The people, in general, shew much anxiety to have their 
children educated, and use every means to keep them at school 
as long as possible. 

The deed of settlement of the late Sir Joseph Straton of Kirk- 
side contained a bequest of the sum of L.500 to the heritors and 
kirk-session of this parish, ' for the purpose of promoting educa- 
tion within the parish." The parties in whom the management 
of this fund is vested have the power of applying it in " such 
manner as may appear to them best calculated to promote" the 
intended object, and they have resolved, in the meantime, to lay 
out the interest arising from it, in the education, at the various 
schools in the parish, of such children as may be selected by the 
kirk-session from among the poorer classes of the people. 

Library. — The parish library, which has existed for a number 
of years, under the management of the minister and kirk-session, 
contains about 750 volumes, chiefly of a religious kind. It was 
formed by a collection at the church doors, and by a subscription 
among the parishioners, and has had very little pecuniary support 



ST CYUU3.

since its institution. The use of the books is free to all the in- 
habitants of the parish, and the librarian has given his gratuitous 
services for an hour every Sabbath morning since the library was 
established. Smaller libraries, containing sets of the Religious 
Tract Society's Sabbath School Libraries, are deposited at the 
different Sabbath school stations. 

Savings' Bank.— A branch of the Montrose National Security 
Savings' Bank was instituted in May 1841, and the deposits, up 
to the date of this report, amounted to L.180. 

Friendly Society. — A society, under the name of the St Cyrus 
Friendly Society, existed from 1796 to 1834, when it was dissolved. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — In the following table, shewing 
the state of the poor and parochial funds, at intervals, from 1781 
to 1835, are represented, 1. the number of poor receiving stated 
monthly allowances ; 2. the number of poor receiving half-yearly 
allowances ; 3. the amount of collections at church doors; 4. 
the amount of interest from stock-funds ; 5. the dues from fu- 
nerals, marriages, &amp;c. ; 6. the annual expenditure; 7. the ave- 
rage monthly allowance to each pauper; 8. the average half- 
yearly allowance to each pauper in the years 9. specified.

The funds at the disposal of the kirk-session have been insuffi- 
cient, for a number of years, for the support of the poor. During 
the twenty years preceding 1836, contributions to the average 
amount of L.14 a year were received from the heritors of the pa- 
rish : and in the same period, donations and legacies from per- 
sons not so directly connected with the parish were received to 
the amount of L. 294. In the year just mentioned, the volun- 
tary contribution from the heritors was L. 30, and it has since 
been augmented to L.62, 10s. a year. The number of poor per- 
sons on the monthly list is at present 36. Three of these are 
males above the age of sixty years, three are females under 
sixty, and the remainder, thirty, are females above the age of sixty 
years. There are, besides, fourteen persons who have half-yearly 
allowances varying from 6s. to 12s., and four who receive quarter- 
ly allowances of 5s. each. The stated monthly payments range 



296 



KINCAUDINESHIRK. 



from 3s. to 14s. The stock-funds in the hands of the kirk-session 
are, Is, The residue of old session funds, amouniing to L.150; 
2d, L.lOO, a donation from William Dorward, Esq. of Montrose, 
subject to a payment of L.3 per annum as interest during Mr Dor- 
ward's life ; 3d, L.20, a legacy received from the representatives 
of the late Mr Brand of Lauriston, as executor of Mr Duncan of 

; Ath, L.50, a legacy from Miss Shank of Laurencekirk, 

daughter of the late Rev. Alexander Shank, minister of this pa- 
rish; and 5th, L.500, a legacy from Sir Joseph Straton of Kirk- 
side. The last-mentioned bequest, which was received in 1840, 
and is managed as a separate fund from the ordinary funds of the 
kirk-session, is to be applied, according to the express will and in- 
tention of the donor, " strictly for the rehef of poor persons with- 
in the parish, and in such a way as may be best calculated to eni- 
courage provident habits on the part of such poor." The collec- 
tions at the church-doors have varied since 1837, from L, 70 to 
L.80 a year. The expenditure has been raised to above L.140 
a year. This has been occasioned partly by the admission on 
the poor's list of two or three families who have required, for some 
years past, allowances varying from L. 9 to L. 13 a year, and 
partly by a payment of about L. 8 a year to poor persons tra- 
velUng through the parish to their homes, or from town to town 
in search of employment. Each traveller is allowed 3d. or more; 
and the whole number relieved in a year cannot be under 500. 

Ak-Jmses. — There is one ale-house near the Kirktown, another 
towards the east end of the parish, and a third at the North-wa- 
ter-bridge toll. The consumption of spirits at all these places is 
said to be enormous. 

Puel — EngUsh coals are the chief article of fuel. They are 
obtained at Montrose and Johnshaven at a cost of Is. Id. to Is. 
3d. per barrel; carriage, five miles, 2d. to 3d. per barrel. 
General Observations. 

In the foregoing report the more important differences have 
been mentioned between the existing and former state of the pa- 
rish, as described in the account of 1791. It will have been ob- 
served, that a large extent of waste ground has been brought into 
cultivation. At the same time much arable land has been effi- 
ciently drained; many large farm-houses, and steadings suited to 
the extended size of farms, have been erected ; one large and se- 
veral smaller bridges have been built. Others have been heigh.

tened, and their approaches improved ; and thewhole of the pub- 
lic roads have been reconstructed. 

The number of poor and their stated allowances have been in- 
creased two-fold. There has been for many years little or no in- 
door employment for aged females, a much earlier application for 
parochial aid is therefore generally made by this class of persons 
than would have been needful under other circumstances. At 
the period of the former account it was estimated " that 500 
spindles of coarse yarn, for the manufacture of sail-cloth, were 
spun by the two-handed females of the parish, from which about 
L.310 a year were brought into the parish. There were besides 
the proceeds from the manufacture of finer sorts of yarn for linen 
and drapery for family use." There is no work of this kind now to 
be obtained, and the want of it has been much felt by many whose 
age and growing infirmities render them unfit for more severe em- 
ployment. 

A very obvious alteration has taken place in the habits and 
style of living of the principal farmers. They have certainly ad- 
vanced at a railroad pace in the march of, at least, physical im- 
provement. On the other hand, the condition of the farm-labour- 
er has remained nearly stationary, though he enjoys more enlarg- 
ed means of education and intellectual improvement.

PRESBYTERY OF EORDOUN, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. A. C. LOW, MINISTER. 



1. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The ancient name of this parish was Aberluthnott, or, 
as it is more commonly expressed in ancient writings, Aberluth- 
net. This name seems to have been in use in the beginning of 
last century, from the fact of a pair of silver communion cups hav- 
ing been presented in the year 1715 for the use of the parish, 
bearing the following inscription : " This cup was given to the 
kirk of Aberluthnott by David Melvill and Jean Rait of Pitgarvie, 



298 



KINCARDINESIIIUE. 



1715." The ancient name is now in disuse, having entirely given 
place to the modern one of Marykirk. 

Extent — Marykirk parish is situated at the southern extremity 
of the extensive plain known by the name of the " How of the 
Mearns." Its extreme breadth from east to west is about 7 miles; 
from north to south about 6 ; and its superficial contents are 15 
square miles. 

Boundaries. — This parish is of very irregular form. It is 
bounded on the south by the river North Esk, which is here the 
boundary between the shires of Forfar and Kincardine, and conti- 
nues to be so till it falls into the sea, about five miles below the 
most southerly point of this parish ; on the north and north-west, 
it is bounded by the parishes of Fordoun and Fettercairn ; on the 
east and north-east, by the parishes of St Cyrus, Garvock, and 
Laurencekirk. 

Topographical Appearances. — The parish, in its aspect, is level, 
sloping gently from the east, north-east, and north towards the 
North Esk. The only rising grounds which deserve the name of 
hills are those of Kirkton-hill and Balmaleedie. They run nearly 
parallel, in a north-easterly direction, for about two miles, from a 
little above the village of Marykirk to the Wide-open, a large gap 
or cut in the ridge. By it they are separated from the hill of Gar- 
vock, of which, with this interruption, they may be said to be a 
continuation. They terminate, in their southern extremities, to- 
wards the village, in declivities sloping towards the North Esk. 

The climate is fully equal, and probably superior, to that of 
some of the surrounding parishes. 

Springs. — The parish is, in all parts, well supplied with 
water, and we are not aware of any inconvenience having 
been felt from the scarcity of this necessary of life, except in 
the summer of 1826, when the extraordinary drought of the sea- 
son dried up some of the brooks, obliging the farmers, in one or 
two districts, to drive their cattle to water to some distance from 
the farms. In the village of Marykirk, there are three springs, 
which supply the inhabitants with water, besides a small brook that 
flows through it, called, in ancient writings, " The burn of Aber- 
luthnot." Of the three springs, the one known by the name of 
" the Lady Banks Well" is the best. By the side of the brook, 
a little above the village, there is a chalybeate spring, which was 
enclosed and covered over some years ago by the proprietor; but 
the work has since been allowed to become ruinous. The spring 



MARYKIRK. 



299 



is neither copious nor very strongly impregnated with iron. Close 
to the mansion-house of Balmanno is a very fine spring, known 
formerly, it would seem, by the name of « St John's Well," the 
water of which, in a more superstitious age, was held to be of pe- 
cuhar potency in curing diseases. On the farm of Muirtown, till 
-very lately, there were two springs within ten yards of each other, 
very remarkable for their difference of temperature. The water 
of one is slightly impregnated with sulphur, but has not been ana- 
lyzed. They are both now dried by the tenant. 

Rivers. — There are several small streams in this parish, such as 
the Black burn, the Dowry burn, the burns of Balmakelly and 
Balmaleedie, which, though highly useful to the inhabitants, can 
scarcely be deemed worthy of notice. The North Esk, and the 
small river of the Luther, are the only two streams at all worthy 
of the name of rivers connected with the parish. The North Esk 
has its rise in the neighbouring county of Forfar, and, flowing in 
an easterly direction, reaches the shire of Kincardine, after which, 
flowing in a south-easterly course, it divides the counties, and falls 
into the sea about four miles from Montrose. The Luther, rising 
in the Grampian hills, above the village of Fordoun, flows at first 
in an easterly direction, till it reaches the parish of Laurencekirk, 
through part of which it flows in a south-westerly course, and, being 
joined by several insignificant brooks, enters the parish of Marykirk, 
about a mile below the village of Laurencekirk. It still continues 
its westerly course, until within a mile of its junction with the 
North Esk, when it suddenly turns to the south, emptying itself 
into that river a little below the North-water-bridge, on the great 
north road from Edinburgh to Aberdeen. This small river, the 
Luther, may flow within the parish a distance of five miles, and 
from its source to its mouth may be about thirteen miles in length. 
Its temperature would seem to be higher than that of the larger 
stream of the North Esk. The North Esk and Luther both 
abound in excellent trout. 

Geology. — Little of a satisfactory nature can be stated regard- 
ing the geological structure of Marykirk. The whole parish ap- 
pears to rest on red sandstone, overlaid to a considerable depth by 
the original soil. The sandstone is, however, exhibited in the chan- 
nel of the North Esk, at Inglismaldie and other places, and is or 
has been worked at Balmakewan and Hatton, but to no great ex- 
tent, the expense of tirring the rock, and of clearing the quarry of 
water, being such as to render the operations unprofitable. A

KINCARDINESHIRE. 



bed of coarse limestone traverses the parish from east to west, and 
was formerly quarried at Balmakewan, and on the farm of Burn, 
on the estate of Kirktonhill ; but the inferior quality of the rock, 
and the expense of quarrying and burning, made the works soon 
be abandoned. This bed seems a continuation of the same rock 
which traverses the high ground in the parishes of Logic Pert, 
Stracathro', and Brechin, where it still continues to be quarried 
to some extent. 

Trap and likewise conglomerate appear in the high ground be- 
hind Kirktonhill and Balmaleedie. No ores, so far as known, 
have been found. The species of bastard whin or amygdaloid, com- 
monly called the Scotch pebble rock, is sometimes found ; and rock 
crystal frequently. 

Soil. — The soil of the parish is various, but the greater part of 
it is well adapted for the crops usually cultivated. In some places 
it is light, and sandy or gravelly ; in many places it contains boul- 
ders ; but in the low-lying holms along the banks of the Luther 
and North Esk, the soil consists of haugh or alluvial land; in other 
parts it is a wet and rather poor clay. In the north and north- 
east parts of the parish, the soil, which was formerly moorish, has 
by cultivation been greatly improved. 

Zoohffi/.The principal fishes are salmon, grilse, sea-trout, com- 
mon trout, and eels. The quantity of the two former in the North 
Esk, where they are chiefly to be found, has decreased very much 
from what it was a few years ago. This is certainly owing to the 
introduction of new modes of fishing, particularly along the sea coast, 
by stake and bag-nets, which effectually prevent the fish from enter- 
ing the river in any quantity, unless when, by the violence of wind 
and flood, the nets have been carried away from the mouth of the 
river. 

Botany. — The plants in this parish are of the most common 
description. The Linnea horealis wiis first discovered to be a na- 
tive of Britain at Inglismaldie, in this parish, where it is found in 
great abundance. About Inglismaldie, also, may be found seve- 
ral varieties of the fern ; but the botanical treasures of the parish 
have never as yet been examined with attention. 

The plantations are extensive. The soil is adapted to the 
growth of all the ordinary kinds of timber. Few of the trees have 
as yet attained great size, not being, in general, above sixty years 
of age. Inglismaldie has long been famed for its plantations of 
fir timber, some of which are upwards of one hundred years old, 
and for size and quality are inferior to none in the county.

II. — Civil History. 

Eminent Mew.— The Strachans of Thornton were men of con- 
siderable distinction in the service of their country. The late Dr 
Crombie, who was also proprietor of Thornton, and patron of the 
parish, was a man of eminence, and of great repute as an author. 
His works on Natural Theology, and particularly his Gymnasium, 
are deservedly held in high estimation. 

Land~oivners,—T\\e landed proprietors are, the Earl of Kin- 
tore ; Sir Alexander Ramsay, Bart. ; Robert Taylor, Esq. ; Alex- 
ander Crombie, Esq.; the Honourable General Hugh Arbuth- 
nott, M. P.; Lieutenant- Colonel Eraser; and Sir John Stuart 
Forbes, Bart. 

Parochial Registers. — The registers of baptisms and marriages 
have been correctly kept since 1699. The records previous to 
that date appear to have been lost, from the following minute: — 
" The register of the baptisms within the parish of Aberluthnot 
since the 31st of August, being the admission day of John Thom- 
son, minister, the former books not being found. 1099." The 
books connected with the parish are not voluminous. 

Antiquities. — As is remarked in the former Statistical Account, 
« the antiquities of this parish are few in number and of no great 
importance." To the little there said, little can be added ; in- 
deed the traditions there set forth are now scarcely known to any 
of the people. Since the date of the former account, several stone 
coffins have been discovered on the farm of Cobbleheugh, in which 
were found the remains of skeletons of a very large size. The 
Thornton Aisle, which bears the date of 1615, is still standing. 
The inscription on the beautiful monument which it contained, as 
well as the monument itself, are now nearly defaced. The whole 
interior of the aisle has suffered much from the depredations of 
the youngsters in the village, and the roof, which seems at one 
time to have been finely painted, has been destroyed almost en- 
tirely by the same mischievous hands. Part of the old cross of 
the village is still standing. 

Modern Buildings. — the modern buildings in the parish, 
the bridge over the North Esk, a little below the village of Mary- 
kirk, may be first noticed. It was begun in 1811, and finished in 
1813. It is a neat substantial building, consisting of four circu- 
lar arches of equal size, and has proved of the greatest utility to 
the whole district of the county. The bridge over the North Esk, 
on the road leading from Aberdeen to Edinburgh, is of great an- 



302 



KINCAllDINESHIllE. 



tiquity, — it is this summer \indergoiiig extensive repairs, by which 
it will be much beautified and improved. 

The mansion-house of Kirktonhill has been rebuilt since the 
date of the last report. It is a handsome building, and, from its 
commanding situation, forms a prominent object in the district. 

The mansion-house of Balmakewan has also been rebuilt since 
the date of the former report. It stands on a rising ground near 
the North Esk, and is a neat and commodious structure surround- 
ed and sheltered by thriving and highly ornamental plantations. 

Inglismaldie, one of the seats of the Earl of Kintore, is an old 
house, in a castellated form. It has not been occupied for some 
time, but is in tolerable repair. 

Thornton Castle, the property of Alexander Crombie, Esq. of 
Phesdo, is an ancient building, in the style of the Scotch castellat- 
ed mansion house ; part of it bears date 1531. It had been allow- 
ed to get into a ruinous state, but was repaired by the late Mr 
Crombie of Phesdo, about twenty years ago, with much taste and 
at considerable expense. In making these repairs the style and 
character of the old castle was strictly attended to — it is now a 
comfortable residence, and is occupied by a tenant. 

The House of Hatton, the property of the Honourable Ge- 
neral Hugh Arbuthnott, is neither large nor commodious. It is, 
however, in tolerable repair, and occupied by the tenant of the farm. 

The parish church, built in 1806, may also be noticed. It is 
a neat, though plain, building, and is capable of containing about 
700 sitters. It occupies a site near the centre of the village, dif- 
ferent from that of the old one, which stood in the middle of the 
church-yard. 

Spinnnig-Mill. — There is only one spinning-mill in the parish, 
at Caldhame. Flax is there manufactured ; the mill is driven by 
the Luther. 

All the buildings are of freestone, obtained generally from the 
quarries of Hatton, Balmakewan, Balmanno, in this parish, and 
also from Brechin and Laurieston ; chiefly from the last. 

III. — Population. 
According to Dr Webster's list of inhabitants, the population of 
this parish amounted in 1755 to 1280. According to Mr Garden's 
account, it amounted in 1774 to 1080. In 1793, the population 
seems to have been 1481. Since that date the population has in- 
creased rapidly. By the census of 1821, it amounted to 1839; 
of 1831, to 2032. By a census taken in 1836, to 2200, and by 

G 



MARYKIRK. 



303 



the census of 1841, it amounted to 2389. Tlie increase of inha- 
bitants is to be attributed to the progress of manufactures, it be- 
ing principally observable in the village of Luthermuir, where 
many weaving shops have been established. 

The parish contains two villages, Marykirk, in which the church 
stands, and Luthermuir, nearly four miles distant from it. The 
former contains nearly 300 inhabitants, the latter about 1090, con- 
sequently about 1000 reside in the country part of the parish. 

The average number of births may be about 50, and of marriages 
22, for the last seven years. The number of deaths cannot be 
given, there having been no record kept of such. 

Of nobility, there are none residing in the parish. Two fami- 
lies of independent fortune, Robert Taylor, Esq. of Kirktonhill, 
and Lieutenant- Colonel Fraser of Balmakewan, reside constantly 
in the parish. Each proprietor derives an income from land above 
L.60. 

The number of inhabited houses in the parish is 554 ; of un- 
inhabited houses, 20. 

There is only one insane person belonging to the parish ; fatu- 
ous, 8 : blind, 3 ; deaf and dumb, 2. 

The general character of the people is moral and religious; 
they are decidedly intelligent. Poaching for game and also for 
salmon in the North Esk, has prevailed to a considerable extent 
in this parish hitherto, but it is hoped that the Kincardineshire 
Society for the Protection of Game will speedily put a stop to this 
demoralising practice. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — " Marykirk is essentially an agricultural parish — 
the manufactures carried on being limited to a flax spinning-mill 
at Caldham, and the hand-loom weaving of linen in Luthermuir. 
To which may be added three or four saw-mills, chiefly employed 
in cutting up home-grown fir timber, for agricultural purposes. 

The parish contains 9320 imperial acres which may be thus 
classified : 

Arable, - - 6955 

Pasture, ... 573 
Wood, chiefly Scots fir, - 1532 
Roads, rivers, &amp;c. - 2C0 

Total, - 9320 

 In 1807, the arable niul pasture land was as under : arable, 4557 : wood, 
1800 ; pasture, 2963 ; total, 320. 



304 



KINCARDINESHIRE. 



The arable land may be further subdivided into haugh or alluvial 
land, lying along the north bank of the North Esk, and the mar- 
gin of the Luther water, the burn of Balmakelly, the Black burn, 
Doury burn, and the Forder burn, amounting altogether to, say 
350 acres ; light gravelly land on an open bottom, 600 acres ; good 
strong loam and old infield land, partly on a porous sub-soil, 1600 
acres ; inferior clay land and black moorish soil, on a wet and re- 
tentive subsoil, 4405 acres ; total, 6955 acres. 

The waste land and ground under planting is invariably a poor 
clay, or moorish soil, of very inferior quality. The farms are 
generally laid out in regular fields, by earthen dikes or fences ; 
thorn hedges and stone dikes being restricted to the home farms 
of Inglismaldie, Balmakewan, Kirtonhill, and Balmanno. 

The rental of Marykii k amounts to, of land rent, - L.7'205 0 0 
Fishings in the North Esk, - - " 40 0 0 

Annual sales of wood, . - - 4z0 U U

From three to four hundred pigs may be reared and fattened

Husbandnj. — The alternate husbandry is in full operation ; the 
rotation followed being generally the five shift course. The crops 
cultivated are, barley, oats, turnips, potatoes, and grass ; little or 
no wheat is grown, and pulse crops scarcely enter into the rotation. 
Much attention is paid to the rearing of black-cattle, and to 
these the farmer looks for a great part of his rent. The Angus 
or polled breed is in great estimation. The farms are generally 
small, there being only eight farms of 200 acres and upwards, 
with twelve of 100 and not amounting to 200 acres each, the re- 
mainder of the parish being divided into farms under 100 acres, 
and crofts of from two to twenty acres. The larger farms are ac- 
commodated with suitable steadings, substantially built of stone 
and lime, and slated. A thrashing-mill is attached to every stead- 
ing where the extent of land amounts to 100 acres. Although much 
has been done in improving the land, still much remains to be ac- 
complished. The land, from being on a retentive subsoil, is ge- 
nerally wet, draining is therefore the first and most essential im- 
provement. This may be followed by planting for shelter, and 
by a more judicious and general mode of enclosing. 

Besides the flax spinning-mill at Caldham, there are in the pa- 
rish, six corn-mills, one flax-mill, and five saw-mills. Drying 
kilns are attached to the corn-mills. 

Sa/woM;sA._ Salmon-fishing is carried on, but not to a reat 
extent, in this parish. There are, in the beginning of the season, 
generally five or six men employed at the rate of 10s. to 12s. 6d 
a week, and towards the close only two or three at the same rate 
The rents of the fishings amount to L.40. 

Manufactures.— ks already mentioned, flax is manufactured at 
Caldham mill. About thirty hands are employed. They work 
about thirteen hours a-day, and receive 4s. 6d. to 5s. 6d. a-week. 
The foremen receive from 15s. to 21s. weekly. 

The other branch of trade is hand-loom weaving. This trade 
is carried on chiefly in Luthermuir, where nearly 200 persons are 
engaged in it. The yarn is supplied by Richards and Co. in Mon- 
trose, and by two companies from Brechin. The weavers work ge- 
nerally fourteen or fifteen hours a-day, and when the material was 
good, used to make from 1 Is. to 14s. a-week. The wao-es have 
gradually fallen to 7s. or 8s. weekly. The trade has beeli so bad

for the last six months that several of the best hands employed

v.— Parochial Economy. 
Market -Toion.— There is no market-town in this parish. The 
nearest is Montrose, distant about six miles from the village of 
Marykirk, where every necessary of life can be procured at a rea- 
sonable rate. 

Means of Communication.— The means of communication en- 
joyed by the parish are, on the whole, good. There is a post-of- 
fice in the village of Marykirk, where letters are posted for, and 
received through Montrose every day. The turnpike road from 
Aberdeen to Perth passes through the parish, and the Defiance 
coach goes and returns from Edinburgh every lawful day. The 
commutation roads in the parish lead through it in various direc- 
tions, and are generally good and well kept. The bridges on all 
the roads are in good repair. At Mill of Barns, a bridge is much 
wanted over the Luther. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church is very inconveniently 
situated. Its distance from the south boundary of the parish is 
only about 300 yards, and from the opposite extremity from five 
to six miles. It was built in 180G, and is at present in good re- 
pair. The number of sittings is 638, all unlet, and all allocated . 

to the heritors.  

The manse was repaired in 1838, at considerable expense to 
the heritors, and is now comfortable and commodious. 

The glebe is four acres in extent, good land, and may be worth 
L 10 yearly. There is no grass glebe, nor any remuneration for 
it The stipend amounts to 150 bolls of meal and 126 bolls of 
bear, which, on an average, amount to L.200. The allowance 
for communion elements is L.8, 6s. 8d. The surplus teinds be- 
long to King's College, Aberdeen. There is no chapel of ease 
atta°ched to the Established Church, nor any Government church 
or missionary in the parish. There are two Dissenting chape s; 
one belongs to the Congregational Union, the other to the United 

 Thf co'llicants belonging to the Established Church 
amount to 957. The communicants belonging to other sects who 
reside in the parish, are, to the Congregational Union, 30 , Unit- 
Pd Associate Synod, 63; Bereans, 9; Episcopalians, 12. I 
Tne sl'e at 'the Established Church, and at the other twc 
chapels, is generally well attended. The only collection for cha

ritable purposes, made in the parish church, is for the Montrose 
Infirmary. It is made annually, and amounts, on an average, to 
L.6. 

Education. — Besides the parish school, there are five pri- 
vate schools, which, with the exception of one, which is endowed, 
are on the teachers' own adventure. The parish school is at 
present vacant ; but the usual branches of English reading, writ- 
ing, arithmetic, mensuration, geography, and Latin have been 
taught. The average number of scholars for the last few years 
has been 50, and the average amount of fees L.20 yearly. The 
salary is L.30, with a house, garden, and about four acres of 
ground. In ] 840, a handsome school and school-house was erect- 
ed in Luthermuir by the liberality of Sir John Stuart Forbes, 
Bart., and by subscriptions from the heritors and others, which is 
endowed by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Know- 
ledge, with a salary of L.15 per annum ; besides which the teacher 
has about three acres of land rent free from Sir J. S. Forbes. It 
is attended by 60 scholars, and the average amount of fees may 
be L.22 yearly. In the private schools, English reading, writing, 
and arithmetic are generally taught. They are attended by about 
160 scholars. The number of children attending school in the 
parish amounts to about 270. All the teachers, except one, are 
members of the Established Church, and, in all the schools, 
great attention is paid to the religious instruction of the pupils. 
There cannot be said to be any children in this parish between the 
ages of six and fifteen years who can neither read nor write, and, 
with the exception of a few old people, there are few above that age 
who cannot do so. In the parish generally, parents seem very 
anxious that their children shall enjoy the benefits of education ; 
but in Luthermuir, where children of tender years are of some 
use to their parents in their ordinary employments, their education 
has been much neglected ; and this is very visible in their conduct 
in after years. From the number of schools, there is every oppor- 
tunity for the instruction of the children, within a reasonable dis- 
tance of the abodes of the parents. 

Library. — There is a library consisting of about 200 volumes, 
chiefly religious, which was presented to the parish by Patrick 
Taylor, Esq., son of the late John Taylor, Esq. of Kirktonhill, 
before he left the parish for Australia. It is highly valued by the 
people, and, in the winter season, much read. 

Friendly Societies.—ThQVQ is a sort of Friendly Society or rather 



308 



KINCAUDINESHIRF. 



Savings bank, which has been in operation in Luthermuir for about 
twelve years. The nature of it is this : The members contribute 
6d., Is., or 2s. 6d. weekly as they can; this sum, as it accumu- 
lates, is lent out at interest among the members, in sums not ex- 
ceeding L.5, for which the member borrowing gives, as security, 
two other members of the society, who may not require the use of 
such a sum. A great part of the funds are lent out in this way, 
and the money not so lent is laid out to the best advantage, and 
the whole sum, principal and interest, is divided at the year's end 
among the members in proportion to their weekly contribution. 
This society has been very useful in the parish. There being no 
proper Savings bank, the people generally avail themselves of 
those established in the neighbouring parishes of Logic- Pert and 
Fettercairn. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The average number of poor on 
the roll is 50, and the average allowance 4s. a month to each. 
Besides these there are about 20 others who receive occasional re- 
lief. The ordinary church collections, including collections at the 
communion, amount to L.50 ; the interest of stock funds, L.20, 
17s. 6d.; the dues of mortcloths, LA, 2s. 8d. ; voluntary contri- 
butions from the heritors, in proportion to their valued rents, 
amount to from L.lOO to L.150. There is a growing disposition, 
on the part of the poor, to seek parochial relief, and they seem to 
have no idea of any thing degrading in it. 

Fairs.— There is now an annual fair in the parish, held on Bal- 
makelly moor, on the last Friday of July, for the sale of cattle, 
horses, sheep, wool, and for the engagement of harvest shearers. 
It is called St James's fair. It was formerly held on the Hill of 
Garvock, but was removed to Balraakelly moor about two years 
ago, for the better accommodation of dealers. 

inns and Alehouses.— There are six inns or alehouses in the pa- 
rish, certainly far too many; but they seem to be less frequented 
now than they were a few years ago. There cannot be a doubt 
that they have a bad effect on the morals of the people. 

Fuel —Coals are chiefly used. They are obtained m Montrose 
at a cost of Is. 2d. per barrel, and the cartage to Marykirk may 
be about 4d. a barrel more. Brushwood is also to be had m con- 
siderable quantities, at the price of Is. 6d. per load. The farmers 
may obtain turf and peat from the moss of Arnhall, m the pansh 
of Fettercairn, on account of their farms ; but they do not avail 
themselves of their right to a great extent.

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The agricultural improvements of the parish, since the date of 
the last Report, have been very great. The land is now mostly 
improved, and in a high state of cultivation. That incapable of 
improvement has been planted with wood, which seems to be ge- 
nerally thriving. 

Luthermuir, which, at the time of the last Report, seems to 
have been deemed unworthy of notice, being at that time only a 
barren moor, is now mostly cultivated, and contains a population, 
as already stated, of above 1000. On account, however, of the 
decline of manufactures, especially the weaving trade, it is begin- 
nmg to decrease in point of population, but to advance in several 
other respects. A few years ago, this place seems to have been 
the resort of the destitute and abandoned from almost every parish 
in the country. It is pleasing to remark, that it is improving very 
fast in point of morality and religion,— persons of a loose charac- 
ter having been obliged to leave it from want of work, and the re- 
maining inhabitants becoming more alive to their duties both to 
God and man.

Topography and Natural History. 

Name.—Tm parish seems to have derived its name from the 
Castle of Kinneff, the remains of which may still be seen in the 
neighbourhood of the church. According to a local tradition, 
Kenneth, one of the Kings of Scotland, was its founder, and it was 
afterwards retained as a royal residence. 

Boundaries.~T\ie parish is nearly triangular in figure, having 
for Its boundaries, on the south, Bervie ; on the east, the German 
Ocean; on the north, Dunnottar; and on the west, Arbuthnott. 
It extends 5 miles along the sea coast, its breadth at the northern 
extremity being about 4, and at the southern less than half a mile. 
According to a survey made by Mr Garden in 1774, it contains 
6408 English acres.

KINCATIDINESHIRE. 



The sea-coast, along its whole extent, is rocky, presenting a 
range of cliffs about 180 feet in height, and generally with no 
beach intervening to separate them from the deep wa"ter. Occa- 
sionally, they fall back into little bays, where a narrow stripe of 
coarse gravel is heaped up by the waves, but sand is almost un- 
known. Though bare of wood, the soil is fertile, often covered 
with rich verdure to the edge of the sea, and the rugged aspect of 
the rocks, their deep caves, and precipitous cliffs offer much that 
is bold and picturesque to the lovers of natural scenery. 

The high grounds which traverse the parish have marked out 
several well-defined districts into which it may be divided. Along 
the sea coast stretches a low-lying tract of deep loamy soil, varying 
from a quarter to about three-quarters of a mile in breadth, which 
has long been celebrated for its abundant crops of grain. Passmg 
inland over the hill of Slains, a district of inferior value presents 
itself, bounded on the north by a range of elevated ground, which 
rises at one point into the hill of St John. Beyond, lies the « land 
of Barras,"— a district where the effects of recent agricultural im- 
provement are very marked. 

Close to the furthest boundary on the north-west is the hill ot 
Bruxie, 650 feet in height, and the most elevated point in the parish. 
The Todheadand Craig David or Bervie Brow are well-known lana- 
marks on the coast, rising bold and steep over the German Ocean. 

GeoZoy.— The rocks consist, for the most part, of old red sand- 
stone conglomerate. They are well exposed along the coast, dip- 
ping from east to west generally at an angle of less than 25 . 1 he 
strata are of considerable thickness, and present every variety in 
their composition,-the smaller grained sandstones bemg some- 
times suddenly overlaid by deep confused masses of gravel and 
boulders compactly bound together by hard cement. The bould- 
ers and pebbles of the conglomerate are chiefly masses of granite, 
gneiss, quartz, and porphyry. Near Whistleberry, a thin irregu- 
far layer of impure limestone occurs. Traces of igneous action also 
are not unfrequent. A claystone porphyry with imbedded crys- 
tals of felspar, sometimes overflows the conglomerate, and, at other 
p nt , insert itself among the strata. It is known by the provm- 
cnlme of scurdy, and, in various places through the parish, has 
been quarried for fences, and sometimes even houses. 

Calcareous spar traverses the conglomerate m ll; 
stone, hornblende, crystallized quartz, -yP '  
zeolite have been observed. Agates also occur, but not fiequently. 



KINNEFF. 311 

Botany. — The surface of the parish, varying from the rocky sea- 
coast, to the upland marsh and heathy moor, presents a consider- 
able field for native plants. Among the more remarkable is the 
SileJie mdans, not hitherto observed so far north, which blossoms 
in great profusion among the rocks. Primula veris and P. elatior, 
contrary to the statement of Hooker, are found growing abundant- 
ly with P. vulgaris, in circumstances which cast doubt on their 
claims to the rank of species. Close to the sea the Geranium 
sanguineum hangs forth its showy flowers ; while the scarcely less 
beautiful Gentiana campestris, and Astragalus hypoglottis, with the 
more common Silene maritima and Dianthus deltoides, also adorn 
the banks. 

The native Puci of the rocks do not present much that is re- 
markable or rare. Dulse {Rhodomenia palmatoL grows large on 
the conglomerate where exposed to the tide ; Iridcpa edulis and 
Catenella opuntia occur more sparingly ; and in sheltered spots no- 
thing can exceed the beauty of Delesseria sanguinea and Odontha- 
lia dentata, with their elegant deep-red fronds floating beneath the 
wave. 

In some instances, the native plants are turned to economical 
purposes. Broom is employed for thatch, many poorer houses in 
the parish being covered with it. The younger shoots are chiefly 
used, and are bound down to the roof with ropes of straw, or, when 
greater durability is desired, of heather. The latter are twisted 
with the hand by shepherds in the neighbourhood. The whin is 
sometimes employed for feeding cattle. On several small forms 
there is an apparatus in use, driven by a horse, for bruising the 
branches of the plant, and preparing them for food. Dulse is 
much eaten, being gathered to a considerable extent during the 
summer months, and carried inland in carts for sale. The young 
shoots of the tangle  Laminaria digitata J are also similarly used. 

II. — Civil History. 
When King David Bruce returned from France in 1341, he 
was pursued by the English fleet, and driven so far from his di- 
rect course, that the first point of his kingdom which he touched 
was the shore of Kinneff". In gratitude for his escape, he after- 
wards caused a chapel to be erected on the spot, and mass per- 
formed. The ruins of this building, which were standing at the 
date of the last Statistical Account, have since disappeared ; but 
the bold rock under which he landed, still bears the name of Craig

David; and there is a spring familiarly known as the " Chapel 
Well." 

During the civil war, when Scotland was invaded by the Eng- 
lish forces under Cromwell, a circumstance occurred of much in- 
terest in the history of the parish. After the battle of Dunbar, so 
rapidly was the country overrun by the enemy, that the regalia 
by order of Parliament, 6th June 1651, were conveyed for 
greater security to Dunnottar Castle, then a fortress of great 
strength, defended by Lieutenant-Governor George Ogilvie, of 
Barras, with a garison of about 100 men. Close siege was laid to it 
during the years 1651 and 1652, and the Enghsh commanders 
in all their movements displayed the utmost anxiety to gain pos- 
session of the ensigns of Royalty. This desire was baffled by 
Christian Fletcher, wife of James Granger, minister of KinnefF. 
According to local tradition, Mrs Granger was returning one day 
from Stonehaven, when she requested of the English forces per- 
mission to visit the castle. This request must have seemed the 
more reasonable, from the circumstance, that the commander of 
the place, Ogilvie of Barras, and his lady, who shared with him 
the hardships of the siege, were parishioners of KinnefF. Without 
hesitation, therefore, she was permitted to enter, and the garrison 
being nearly reduced to the necessity of surrendering, the regaha 
were entrusted to her care. The sceptre and sword of state were 
concealed in a bag or fish-creel, among hards of lint, and carried 
by a female attendant. The crown Mrs Granger herself took in 
charge, covering it in her apron, and in this guise passed without 
obstruction the English forces — their general himself, it is said, with 
the utmost politeness, assisting the lady to her horse. After be- 
ing thus rescued, the regalia were kept, " sometimes in the 
church of Kinneff, concealed under the pulpit, and at other times 
in a double-bottomed bed in the manse, till the Restoration, in 
1660, when they were delivered to Mr George Ogilvie, who re- 
stored them." The parties engaged in these transactions were 

 The names of these commanders are variously given. Sir W. Scott, without 
quoting authority, says that the castle was summoned to surrender, on November », 
by Lieutenant- General Overtoun ; and again, on December 22, by Lieutenant-Co- 
lonel Button. In Jamieson's edition of Slezer's Theatrum Scotiae it is to have 
been besieged by Lambert, one of the Parliamentary Commissioners m So and at 
the time. Ogilvie is said to have surrendered to Major-General Deane, on 4th June 
1652Whitelocke, Mem. quoted by Scott; but in the account of the Kegalia b 
Bannatyne Club, Colonel Thomas Morgan is represented as ''""""''"S XcrrJn'l" 
lish. Deane was Commander-in-Ciiief in Scotland at the time, and ft'-f S'"'; 
ed Ogilvie a protection, on condition of his not going farther than three miles trom 
his house at 13arrns.

afterwards rewarded by the Government of Charles, but not cer- 
tainly in the direct ratio of their services. Mrs Granger, to whose 
presence of mind the merit was chiefly due, had 2000 merks voted 
her by Parliament January 11, 1661. Mr Ogilvie was made a 
Baronet, but received no compensation for the fines and seques- 
trations to which his estate had been subjected. Sir John Keith, 
the nominal governor of the castle, was created Earl of Kintore, 
partly in compliment to his mother, Margaret Erskine, Countess 
Marischal, under whose authority Mrs Granger acted, and partly 
on account of the imprisonment he suffered from taking on him- 
self the fictitious responsibility of having carried abroad the rega- 
lia, and delivered them to Charles II. A tombstone, erected in 
the church of Kinneff to the memory of Mr Granger, bears the fol- 
lowing inscription : — 

Scotia Granger cui insignia regia debet 

Servata, hie cineres reliquiaeque jacent ; 
Abstulit obsesso poene haec captiva Dunotro, 

Condidit et sacra qua tumulator humo. 
Praemia dant Superi, Patrii servator honoris 

Sceptra rotat superos inter athleta choros. 

Eminent Men. — " The famous Dr John Arbuthnott, intimate 
friend of Pope and Swift, and physician to Queen Anne, lived for some 
time in this parish. His father, the minister of Arbuthnott, was, 
at the Revolution, turned out of his living, by his chief and patron, 
Lord Arbuthnott, who was then a very keen partizan ; upon which 
he retired to his own property of Kingorny, where he lived for 
some time, having his son, the Doctor, a young man, along with 
him." 

Land- oivners. — There are nine proprietors in the parish. The 
lands of Kinneff, including nearly one-half of the valued rental, 
are held by the Trustees of the late Lord Keith ; the estate of 
Barras, by the Trustees for Donaldson's Hospital in Edinburgh ; 
and the lands of Catterline, with Chapel of Barras, by Lord Ar- 
buthnott. The remaining heritors are, the Heirs of the late C. 
Abercrombie of Bellfield ; T. G. Straiten of Castle of Fiddes ;

Parochial Registers. — The session records are complete from 
the settlement of Mr Honeyman, in 1663, though the first volume 
is much injured, and in many places illegible. 

Antiquities. — Of the Castle of Kinneff nothing now remains 
but a small part of the foundations. It is mentioned by Buchanan 
in his History as having been garrisoned by the English, when they 
overran the country during the minority of David Bruce. At 
what period it was permitted to fall to ruin does not appear; but 
early in last century " one high wall of the said castle" is describ- 
ed as standing " so strongly cemented, that stones may be easier 
won out of a quarry" than from it. 

A religious house, called St Arnty's Kill, St Arnold's Cell, 
Macf. MSS. is mentioned in the former Statistical Account as 
standing " at the north corner of the farm garden, in a straight 
line between the church and the castle." It has since wholly dis- 
appeared. 

« Near the Castle of Kinneff, and beyond a small headland 
about one hundred paces north-east, there are to be seen the 
remains of an old work upon the top of a peninsular rock, call- 
ed the Castle of Cadden. It seems to have had a ditch and 
drawbridge to protect it from an attack by land, where there re- 
main some vestiges of masonry. The rest seems to have been 
an earthen mound thrown up about the top of the rock. About 
two hundred paces further north-east is another peninsular rock, 
having the remains of a drawbridge to the land side. Upon the 
top of this rock are still extant the remains of a small house and 
other buildings said to have been inhabited by a private gentle- 
man about one hundred and fifty years ago, and is named the

east from this last mentioned castle are the remains of a third

« Four or five years ago, in "digging a grave for Lady Ogilvie 
of Barras, in the church of Kinneff, there was found buried in an 
earthen pot about a pound and a half of old silver coins. They 
were almost all of one size, about the breadth of a sixpence ; a few 
about half that size ; and all bore either the impression of Edward 
of England, or of Alexander of Scotland. The impression and 
legend on the Scotch coins are much better executed than on the 
English. It is likely this treasure might have been laid where it 
was found about the year 1336, when the English garrison occu- 
pied the Castle of Kinneff." 

" There was a tumulus or cairn upon St John's hill opened about 
twenty years ago, in the bottom of which, a little under the sur- 
face of the ground, were found three long flat stones, one of them 
covering the other two, and having a shorter one at each end. In 
this was contained nearly a cart-load of rich black earth, having a 
mixture of half-burnt bones and bits of oak charcoal, without any 
kind of urn. There are other tumuli in the parish." 

The late Rev. A. Stewart, minister of this parish, presented, in 
1834, to the Society of Antiquaries, a vase, with a number of 
bronze rings of various sizes, two of them entire, the rest in frag- 
ments, with a spear-head of bronze. The following interesting 
description by Mr Stewart is preserved in the Society's minutes :f 
" These relics of antiquity were found on the 15th December 
1831, by my workmen, while trenching a field on the top of a cliff 
overhanging the German Ocean, and near the site of the old 
Castle of Kinneff. The piece of metal resembling the point of a 
spear, or part of a sword, was discovered about twelve inches be- 
low the surface of the ground, lying across the mouth of the urn, 
but separated from it by a layer of earth about two inches thick. 
Round the mouth of the urn there was an outer edge or rim about 
two inches in depth, and of the same material as the urn itself; 
but it crumbled into dust on being handled. The urn was quite 
full of earth compactly pressed together. And on the surface of 
this earth, were found the inner rings set upon their sides, and 
which were broke into their present state by the workmen at- 
tempting to pull them out of the earth. At the bottom of the 

proximity. Among the lands in which Sir Robert Arbuthnott is served heir to his 

father in 1633, I find the Castle of Whistleberry described as a " manor-place"

urn, were found the larer rings entire, and also two button-sliap- 
ed ornaments, the one made of a substance resembling bone, the 
other of a substance like coal. The latter was quite entire when 
discovered, but has since fallen to pieces." 

III. — Population. 
There has been comparatively little fluctuation in the number 
of inhabitants, which, so far as they can be traced at different pe- 
riods, have been as follows : 

In the year 1755, the number of inhabitants was 858 



1782, . . about 1000 

1811, . , 952 

1821, . . . 1036 

183], , . 1006 

1841, . . . 1029 



The number of deaths for 1841 was 24, but the average may 
be somewhat less. Births average 30, and marriages about 9. 
The number of persons of different ages may be stated to be — 

Under 15 years of age, . 389 

15 and under 80, 277 

30 50, . 191 

50 70, 138 

Above 70, . . 34 

The families are 205 in number ; inhabited houses, 204 ; and 
uninhabited, 14. 

There is one individual blind, two fatuous or lunatic, and two 
are deaf and dumb. 

The only resident proprietor is Dr William Young of Fawsyde. 

All the heritors draw upwards of L.50 of rental. 

IV. — Industry. 

According to the survey of Mr Garden, the number of impe- 
rial acres in the parish is 6408. Of these, 4798 are in tillage, 
and about 250 of the remainder might, with a profitable outlay of 
capital, be brought into cultivation. Only 53 acres are under 
wood. 

llent, c. — The average rent of arable land per imperial acre 
is about L.l, 3s. 6d. Leases are granted generally for nineteen 
years, a period considered favourable both to landlord and tenant. 

Wages. — The wages of married farm-servants average about 
L. 12, 12s. per annum, 6 bolls of oatmeal, with land for potatoes, 
a house and garden, and a daily allowance of If Scotch pint of 
milk in summer, and 1 pint in winter. Unmarried servants en- 
gage for six months, and the average wages may be L.7, 10s., 
with the same allowance of milk and meal as the married servants. 
Able day-labourers are paid Is. 3d. to Is. 6d. per day in summer, 

and Is. in winter, with victuals. Reaping is performed for 3s., and 

3 



KINNEFF. 317 

green-crop hoeing for 4s. per imperial acre. Country artisans 
do their work by the piece or contract. 

Live-StocL— The breed of cattle kept is the polled Angus, 
and on several farms great attention has been paid to their im- 
provement. No sheep are bred in the parish. The black-cattle 
are sold either at two years old for grazing, or at three years old 
when fit for the butcher. 

No very extensive improvement of waste land has recently 
taken place in the parish. It is found in some instances where 
heathy moor has been reclaimed, that it will not ultimately be of 
advantage for landlord or tenant. 

The state of farm-buildings is generally good, and agriculture 
is carried on with great spirit. The principal obstacle to improve- 
ment is the want of encouragement by proprietors to draining and 
properly enclosing the land. A few farms are partly enclosed 
with stone-dikes, erected at the expense of the proprietor, — the 
tenant paying interest on the money expended ; but generally 
two- fifths of the arable land, being kept in grass, is inclosed with 
wooden railing, which occasions considerable expense to the 
farmer, and not only forms a very imperfect fence, but affords no 
shelter, which is much wanted in this exposed climate. 

Qiiarries. — Several freestone quarries afford sufficient material 
for the buildings within the parish, but are of no further advan- 
tage to the proprietors. The rocks along the coast furnish ex- 
cellent mill-stones, which have long been in high repute, and are 
sent to a considerable distance. They cost from L.5 to L.IO. 

Fisheries. — A salmon-fishing is rented at L.15. At the fishing 
village of Catterline there are two boats' crews, and at Shieldhill 
there is only one boat weekly manned. 

Produce. — As nearly as can be ascertained, the following may 
be the value of the gross produce raised in the parish : 

Grain of all kinds, . . L.8450 0 0 

Turnips and potatoes, . 2300 0 0 

Straw, . . . 2010 0 0 

Hay, . . . . 600 0 0 

Pasture, . . . 2000 0 0 

Fisheries, . . . 550 0 0 



L.15,910 0 0 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market' Towns. — The market-towns chiefly resorted to by the 
parishioners are Stonehaven and Bervie, the former lying about 
four and a-half miles to the north, and the latter close to the 



318 KINCARDINESHIRE. 

boundary on the south. The fishing station of Catterline con- 
taining, inclusive of the coast-guard, upwards of twenty families, 
is the nearest approach to a village. 

Means of Communication. — In few parishes have the roads been 
better constructed or more carefully maintained. Besides the 
great coast road from Edinburgh to Aberdeen, and the Strath- 
more road, which forms the boundary to the north-west, there are 
about eighteen miles of parish roads, and the manner in which 
they are kept in repair is such as to reflect great credit on the 
trustees. 

It is perhaps deserving of notice, that Mr Stevenson, Civil En- 
gineer, so far back as 1 820, surveyed a line of railway extending 
from the port of Aberdeen, through the valley of Strathmore to 
the town of Crieff, on one uninterrupted level of 104 miles ; a cir- 
cumstance of which there is perhaps no other instance in the 
united kingdom. Should this magnificent design be carried into 
execution, the railway will pass through the parish of Kinneff', 
and may give much commercial importance to the district. 

At Catterline, a pier has been lately constructed, by the Vis- 
count Arbuthnott, which will be of great service to small coasting 
vessels unlading lime and coals. It is understood the situation 
presents many natural advantages for more extended and safe 
harbour accommodation. 

Ecclesiastical Sae.— Previous to the Reformation, the parish 
of Kinneff included also Bervie and Catterline. Even so late as 
1608, " By a decree of the Lords Commissioners of Teinds, the 
parish of Bervie is decerned to remain a part of the parish of 
Kinneff, and because there was no bridge on the river of Bervie, 
the minister of Kinneff agreed to keep a suffragan at Bervie." 
Former Statistical Account. But while the boundaries of the 
parish were thus more extensive, the places of worship were also 
more numerous than now. In addition to Kinneff, Bervie, and 
Catterline, there seems to have been religious service in Barras, 
at the chapel of St John. At what time this chapel fell into dis- 
use does not appear, but the right of presenting to it is several 
times mentioned in the seventeenth century, f That it may have

had some connection with the Knights- Templars has been inferred, 
partly from its name, the chapel of St John, and partly from 
other circumstances. In 1632, among the lands in which Sir 
Robert Arbuthnott was served heir to his father, we find " Terris 
templariis de Kinneff infra parochiam de Kinneff." These " ter- 
rae templariae" would seem to have belonged at some period to 
the Knights of the Temple. There is still a house in the parish 
well known by the name of the Temple, and there is the hill of 
St John, at the foot of which lies a farm called the Chapel of 
Barras. 

The first minister of Kinneff after the Reformation was Mr 
Alexander Keith. From the " Register of Ministers and their 
Stipendis sen the year 1567," printed for the Maitland Club, he 
appears to have held the parishes of Katerling, Barvie, Arbuth- 
nott, and Garvott, in addition to Kinneff, and to have enjoyed in 
all an income of L.26. He was succeeded by Mr James Raitt, 
who died in 1620. Mr James Strachan, the next incumbent, was 
deposed at the period of the second Reformation in 1639. To 
him succeeded Mr James Granger, who died in 1663. At that 
period, Episcopacy having been established, James Honeyman, 
brother to the Bishop of Orkney, was appointed to Kinneff, which 
he held till his death in 1693. He was succeeded by his son 
Andrew, who, in the call inserted in the session records, under 
date March 19, 1693, is described as a preacher of the Gospel, 
and who appears to have continued without ordination till 1702. 
On his death in 1733, he was succeeded by his son James, who, 
again, in 1780, was followed by a son of the same name, the latter 
surviving only for a single year. For four generations, during 
118 years, the parish had thus been held by the members of a 
single family. Mr Patrick Stewart was settled in May 1782, and 
his son, Mr Allan Stewart, as assistant and successor in Septem- 
ber 1818.

• He must have been a very zealous partizan, for, when Episcopacy was again in 
the ascendant, we find Parliament 3d May 1661, granting him the sum of L.lOO 
Sterling, in consideration that he " has been put to great sufferings these many 
yeares bygone, and alwayes given constant testimony of his loyaltie and affection to 
the King's Majestic, and injustly deposed from his service at the kirk of Kinneff for 
the same."

It was in 1709 that the parish of Catterhne was united to that 
of Kinneff, an addition of 300 merks being made to the Uving. 

The present parish church was built in 1738, repaired in 1784, 
and again in 1831. It is situated close to the sea, and extremely 
inconvenient for a great part of the parishioners. The sittings 
furnished are 424, a number insufficient for the parish, and this 
evil is rendered the greater, from the circumstance that they are 
divided according to the valued rent, in consequence of which ar- 
rangement many of the proprietors do not possess nearly the legal 
accommodation required by the tenants and their servants. 

The manse was built also in 1738, and has been twice enlarged 
and repaired. The stipend consists of 16 chalders, one-half being 
barley and the other oatmeal. The value is fixed according to 
the fiars prices and paid in money. The two glebes of Kinneff 
and Catterline are worth about L.28. The usual allowance of 
L.8, 6s. 8d. is made for communion elements. 

The communicants on the roll of the Established Church ave- 
rage about 430. The only Dissenters in the parish are eighteen 
families of Scottish Episcopalians, two Seceders, three Independ- 
ents, and one Berean. 

During the past year there was collected in the church for re- 
ligious objects, L.IO, 15s. 4d. There is an annual collection for 
the Aberdeen Infirmary, amounting to from L.7. to L.8. 

Education. — The history of the parish school of Kinneff forms 
an instructive example of the difficulties which the Church of 
Scotland has sometimes met in promoting the interests of educa- 
tion. Notwithstanding the repeated acts of the Legislature, en- 
joining the heritors of every parish to " provide a commodious 
house for a schoole, and modifie a stipend to the schoolmaster," 
we find the kirk-session of Kinneff at a comparatively late period 
complaining, that " all endeavours to induce the heritors to call 
one to be schoolmaster had been fruitless." Mr Honeyman, there- 
fore, and his elders, considering " the necessity of having a weel 
qualified schoolmaster for teaching the youth within the parish," 
resolved of themselves to procure one. On Sabbath, April 8th 
1705, the minister intimated from the pulpit, that, " conform to 
ane act and appointment of the session, he had used his endea- 

• The former church, In which the Regalia lay concealed, is thus described as it 
stood in the days of the Rev. Andrew Honeyman : It is " a very old fabric, the 
walls thereof being supported with eight strong butrishes, and the roof by pillars ot 
wood, so that probably it is the oldest country church presently possessed and in use 
of any in Scotland." Macf. MSS. I. p. 823, Adv. Lib. Jac. v. 4, 21.

•vours for procuring a schoolmaster, and that he had desyred one 
Mr Robert Gray to come this length, who, being cloathed with 
sufficient testimonials from the masters of the Marischal College 
or Aberdeen, offers to officiate as schoolmaster in this ]arish. 
The minister also desyred that the heads of families might stay a 
little and signifie their inclinations with respect to their having 
this young man settled as schoolmaster, and if they would contri- 
bute for his encouragement and maintinence ; to which the plura- 
litie replyed they were satisfied, and should contribute." The 
teacher having been thus appointed seems to have laboured for 
four years without any regular school-house, which it was still left 
to the session to provide. Accordingly, in May 1709, " the ses- 
sion, considering the great loss this parish is at for want of a school 
within their bounds, think fit to advance money out of the box 
poor's funds for building a school near the church, and recom- 
mended to the several parishioners to contribute for making up 
the box again ; and this day the minister gave three pounds Scots 
for that end." The measures thus taken appear to have been suc- 
cessful ; but Mr Honeyman was still resolved to have the school 
put on a more permanent and satisfactory footing. In 17 18, a de- 
creetj was obtained from the Court of Session, assigning to the 
schoolmaster the annual salary of 200 merks ; and, in 1720, an 
allowance of L.90 Scots was made by the heritors for the school 
and schoolmaster's dwelling. Much difficulty seems to have been 
felt m obtaining payment of these sums, and it was only after lono- 
delay that every obstacle was removed. °

In the parochial school at present, along with the more com- 
mon branches of education, Latin, geography, and occasionally 
Greek are taught. The teacher enjoys the maximum salary. 
There are three unendowed schools, and during the winter season 
there are upwards of 120 children receiving instruction in the pa- 
rish. The amount of school-fees is low, the usual charges being 
from 2s. to 6s. a quarter. 

Library. — A parochial library was established in 1838, and 
consists chiefly of religious books. There are at present 158 
readers. A juvenile library in connection with the Sabbath school 
has 60 readers. 

Savings Bank. — For many years, a Savings bank existed in the 
parish, and was of great benefit. In 1840 a branch of the Stone- 
haven National Security Savings Bank was established in Bervie, 
intended among others for the parishioners of KinnefF. The funds 
of the latter institution are rapidly increasing. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — There are 30 permanent paupers 
on the roll, receiving at an average L.2, 2s. 2d. a-year, and 3 oc- 
casional paupers receiving about L.l, Is. Its funds in 1840 were, 
church collections, L.45, 8s. 9|d. ; interest of legacies, L.6, 9s. 
6d.; mortcloth dues and voluntary contributions, L.IO, 5s. In 
1841, two bequests were received by the session, of L.lOO each, 
from the late Sir Joseph Straiten,— one for promoting education, 
and another for encouraging industrious habits among the poor. 

Inns. — There are three inns or alehouses, and one holding a 
license to sell beer. Though more numerous than is necessary, 
no very perceptible evil effect has been produced by them on the 
population, who are in general sober. 

TMe/. —Broom, peats, and whins are, to a limited extent, used 
as fuel, but sea-borne coal from Northumberland is by far more 
generally employed by all classes. From 4s. to 4s. 6d. per boll 

is the usual price. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since the last Statistical Account was written, agriculture has 
advanced generally in the parish, and especially on the property 
of Barras. A very beneficial change also has been effected by the 
suppression of smuggling. The nature of the coast, with its bays 
and headlands, and its distance from any custom-house, rendered 

the superior church judicatories, " as being a case of great importance, both to us, 

iTd mTn; other parisLs in the northern bounds, where schoo s -7,

it, in former times, only too well known for this illicit traffic; and 
Mr Stewart had reason to complain of the " drunkenness, theft, 
and perjury" thus occasioned among his parishioners. Through 
the vigilance of the Coast- Guard station, established at Catter- 
line, smuggling has now been long unknown. Bothies have been 
introduced on most of the larger farms, — young unmarried ser- 
vants living together, and often left without efficient moral control. 
The demoralizing influence of such a system on the agricultural 
population is becoming painfully apparent, and deserves the seri- 
ous attention of all who would promote their temporal or religious 
welfare.

PRESBYTERY OF KINCARDINE o'nEIL, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. WILLIAM ANDERSON, A. M. MINISTER. 

I- — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — Banchory is supposed by some to signify a fair 
hollow or valley ; but a different meaning is assigned by others. 
It is probably of the same origin as Bangor Banchor in Wales 
and in Ireland ; and refers to some religious institution early esta- 
blished in the place. Ternan, or Tarnau, by which this parish 
IS distinguished from one near it of the same name, is derived 
from St Terne or Ternanus, who, according to Fordun, the 
Breviary of Aberdeen, and other authorities, flourished about 
A. D. 440; and was regarded, after Ninian, as the apostle and 
archbishop of the southern Picts. Usher, however, places his 
era subsequent to a, d. 684, and supposes him to have been 
among the last of their native prelates. He is said to have 
been a native of the Mearns, and of noble parentage ; to have 
been brought up among the Culdee fathers, and, having accom- 
panied Palladius in his mission to the Irish Scots, to have been 
afterwards ordained and sent by him to extirpate the Pelagian he- 
resy, and to establish the Catholic faith among his countrymen in 
Pictland. In this office he was so eminent for his exertions some 



324 KINCARDINESHIRE. 

say also for his writings, and so successful in begetting a regard 
for religion, that his name and remains were long after held in 
great veneration by the people. Many churches were dedicated 
to him throughout the country ; and, among others, the origmal 
place of worship here. An annual fair and a fountain in this pa- 
rish still retain his name. 

In some charters and other writings immediately subsequent to 
the Reformation, the parish is denominated Banchory- Tn'/uY/ ; 
but this distinctive is not now in use. It is familiarly known by 
the name of Upper Banchory. » 

Boundaries and Extent.— It is bounded on the north by the pa- 
rishes of Echt and Midmar; on the east, by Drumoak and Dur- 
ris ; on the south, by Durris and Strachan ; and on the west, by 
Strachan and Kincardine o'Neil. Its figure is irregular ; the ex- 
treme breadth, east to west, 9 miles, and the extreme length, north 
to south, about the same. Its area contains 21307 imperial acres ; 
only 5090 of which are on the south side of the Dee, the rest 
lie on the north, and, with a small portion of Drumoak, form 
the only part of the county of Kincardine which passes that river. 

Topographical Appearances.— T\\Q surface, as seen in a general 
view from any of the. neighbouring heights, appears a portion of 
the valley of the Dee, lying between the long insulated Hill of 
Fare on the north 1793 feet, and Kerloack on the south 1890 
feet, one of the Grampian range, which stretches from the west 
to the sea at Aberdeen. Between this latter hill and the river 
which is here about 165 feet above the sea-level, a lower ridge 
intervenes, whose greatest height may be about 1000 feet. It has a 
steep northern aspect of a crescent form, and is parted in the mid- 
dle so as to allow free communication with the nearly parallel val- 
ley of Strachan, and to permit its waters collected in the Feugh 
to discharge themselves over a rocky ledge into the Dee. Being 
planted with larch and pine, it presents the appearance of a semi- 
circular woody screen, through an opening in which the ridge of 
Kerloack and the singular summit of Cloch-na-ben are seen with 
considerable effect; while the river winding along the curvature 
of its base gives animation to a prospect beautiful and picturesque. 

That part of the parish which lies on the south of the Dee is 
divided by the Feugh. The upper and smaller division consists 
of the sloping flank of Scolty, the western half of the woody cres- 
cent rido-e already mentioned, and embraces a small part of tlie 
estate ot°Blackhall, with the properties of Auchattie and Invery. 

3 



BANCHORY-TERNAN. 325 

It is wooded and cultivated in nearly equal proportions. The 
lower or eastern division contains the estate of Tilwhilly, with 
part of the lands of Durris. The former is situated on the other 
half of the fore-mentioned ridge, with its appendages and cultivated 
slopes. It is bold, rocky, extensively wooded, and abounds in 
fine views of the neighbourhood. The latter comprehends the 
remaining low ground between Tilwhilly and Durris on the east,- 
and Kerloack on the south. It consists of several farms among 
moorlands at the base of this latter hill, together with a marshy 
and mossy tract recently improved, and a cultivated portion of the 
.sloping upper bank, and of the flat border of the Dee. A small rivu- 
let flows into that river on the east of the Durris property, and another 
into the Feugh, on the west side of Tilwhilly, both of which con- 
vey the waters, and form the boundaries of this part of the parish. 

The large tract on the north side, between the Dee and the 
hill of Fare, is comparatively low ground, nowhere rising above 
500 feet. Its chief features are several ridges or heights, suc- 
ceeding one another along the course of the river, and forming in 
some places a high upper bank, gently sloping, or agreeably broken 
and diversifled, while the space between these and the hill, though 
mterrupted in some parts by diverging or parallel ridges, may be 
described on the whole as a lengthened hollow, extending through 
the breadth of the parish, from the loch of Drum in Drumoak on 
the east, to the Bog-loch in Kincardine on the west, having the loch 
of Leys nearly in the middle, and aff"ording beds for several per- 
manent streamlets, which effect an imperfect drainage of the dis- 
trict : the. Canny, rising at the west end of the hill of Fare, and 
flowing south-east into the Dee, with a winding course, in some 
parts the boundary of the parish : the burns of Cluny and Cor- 
richie, from the southern face of the same hill, about a' mile apart, 
uniting under the name of the Blackburn, and passing eastward 
through a flat called the Mirebird into the loch of Drum, from 
which the burn of Coie proceeds in a contrary direction into 
the Dee; while, from the loch of Leys, the burn ofBennie falls 
by a short and nearly direct course into the same river. 
_ On the heights and levels which skirt the Dee on this norh 
side, lies first at the western extremity, the property of Trustach, 
including Woodend, Cairnton, and Invercanny, belonging to the 
estate of Leys, but detached a short distance from the rest. 
It IS a pine-wooded tract, having two villas in secluded spots on 
the river, and several farms near the mouth of the Canny -it ils 
lower end. Next along the Dee is the estate of Inchmarlo, a 



326 KINCATIDINESHIIIE. ' 

pleasant slope, having a finely situated and neat mansion-house 
in the middle, thickly sprinkled with small farms, and embraced 
by extensive woodlands. A little beyond, succeed the new 
\illage of Banchory, the properties of Arbeadie and Kanchory 
Lodge, and the manse, church, and glebe lands; while still far- 
ther east, are the ridges of Crathes, Dowalty, and Coie, which, 
with most of the hollow already described as lying beyond thee 
fore-mentioned heights, and all towards the north-east, to the top 
of the hill of Fare, constitute the estate of Leys within the pa- 
rish ; a surface of great variety, and of very considerable capabi- 
lity ; one-third of which is cultivated, and one-fourth under wood. 
The estate of Raemoir occupies about three miles of the side of 
the hill of Fare, and a strip of the low land immediately under. 
It presents high upland pastures, with vroods clothing the slope of 
the hill beneath them, and surrounding the mansion-house, while 
the remainder consists of well-cultivated and moderately sized 
farms, remarkable for their neatness and thriving condition. At 
the western end of Raemoir, towards the south, lies Glassel, a 
small but interesting property, containing, besides a dwelling-house 
and garden grounds, several small farms, encircled by woods which 
cover two-thirds of the whole. 

A surface possessed of such a variety of outline, and such an 
extent of wood and water, abounds, as might be expected, in pic- 
turesque beauty. Upwards of twelve mansion-houses and villas, 
and a neatly built and prettily situated village, together with mi- 
merous farm cottages, tend greatly to embellish its scenery, while 
a large proportion of its trees being evergreen, enables it to retain 
much of its interest even at the dullest season of the year. The 
waters of the Feugh and Dee, with their bridges and back-grounds, 
as seen especially from Banchory Lodge, opposite to the point of 
their junction ; the banks of the Dee and the distant Grampians 
from Hillhead of Til wh illy ; and Crathes Castle, Blackball, and 
Inchmario from the high road, particulariy attract the notice 
of strangers ; but the lover of scenery will here find much besides 
to gratify him, both in single detached views, and in more com- 
bined extensive prospects. Some of them will interest him by 
their strikingly picturesque features, several by their soft and fault- 
less loveliness, and a few by a rich, harmonious, and elevated beau- 
ty, approaching the sublime. But such scenery is confined chieliy 
to a mile or two on each side the river. Beyond this, many bare 
and uncultivated spots, and a broad margin of mooriands, contrast

Strongly, especially in summer, with the green and shady banks, 
along svhich the Dee, bright as silver, is seen to glide. 

Meteorology, — The greater part of this parish having a soutli- 
ern aspect, and being well protected on the north by the Hill of 
Fare, and in other directions by lesser ridges, as well as generally 
sheltered with abundance of wood, possesses a mild, and, on the 
whole, salubrious climate. The mean height of the barometer for 
1832 was 29.521 inches, and the mean temperature by the ther- 
mometer 47.77°. The hottest day was the 30th of June, 79°, 
wind so uth. The coldest the 28th of December, 20°, wind north- 
west. The temperature of springs and deep wells in the district 
is 47°. 

Hydrography. — In a few situations, springs are not abundant, 
and many fail during summer, but in general they are both nume- 
rous and sufficiently permanent. Good water may almost always 
be found on digging to the rock. Two or three springs are slight- 
ly chalybeate, but their temperature does not appear to differ 
from the rest, nor is there any thing remarkable in their composi- 
tion so far as known. 

Lakes. — The only loch in the parish is that already mentioned, 
the loch of Leys. In a charter granted 1324, it is denominated 
the loch of Banchory, and is described as having a ferry, an island, 
and fishings ; but at present the public road from the church to 
Raemoir passes through the middle of the hollow in which it lies, 
and probably in the direction of the ancient ferry. On descend- 
ing to its basin, the greater extent of its former banks becomes ap- 
parent. It must evidently have once formed a prominent, — and 
while the ancient forest surrounded it, an interesting— feature in 
the landscape. In winter and wet seasons, the water sometimes 
fills partially the whole bottom on both sides of the road ; but in 
summer, a small spot at the eastern extremity, scarcely 400 yards 
square, and surrounded by a broad margin of tall aquatic plants— 
{Phragmites communis, Sdrpus lacustris, Equisetiim limosum, &amp;c. 
— is all that is visible. Its banks are low, and mostly barren. The 
soil occasionally covered by it is mossy, presenting tufts of bog- 
myrtle and stunted willows. There still exists a small island near 
its southern shore, which is said to be " artificial, founded on oak 
piles," with the ruins of " ancient buildings and an oven" upon it, 
and to have " no traditions or notices which throw light on its 
history." The artificial nature of this island seems questionable, 
but the foundations, and even the plan of the buildings may ba

traced without much difficulty. Tiiey occupy nearly the whole 
surface, and appear to have been a fortified dwelling of no great 
solidity, probably the resort or the residence of the family of Leys, 
before their fortalice was built at Crathes. It is sometimes called 
the Gow or " Goo"-house, perhaps from the number of gulls which 
built their nests on the island. The water of the loch is of a dark 
colour. It contains pike, and is frequented occasionally by great 
numbers of sea-fowl, some of whichstill breed there, by several 
varieties of wild duck, snipe, &amp;c., and in some winters by the wild 
swan. It is not fed by any constant stream, and appears to derive 
its origin solely from the moisture which percolates the soil on the 
neighbouring heights, and which, finding here its lowest level, col- 
lects and makes its appearance. Its decrease is partly owing tu 
the clearing and cultivation of some of the surrounding land, and 
partly to an attempt made, about ninety years ago, to drain it by 
deepening its communication with the Dee. 

Eivers. — The only streams requiring more particular notice are 
the Dee and the Feugh. The former enters the parish at Wood- 
end, from west-north-west, and, after making a rather short but 
angular detour along the projecting hill of Trustach on its left 
bank, it takes a larger but similar reach, conformable in the ge- 
neral direction to the semicircular ridge already mentioned on its 
right, and extending to nearly the eastern boundary of the parish. 
About the middle of this course it is joined by the Feugh from 
the south-west, and receives, as formerly noticed, several rivulets 
on its northern and southern sides. Its channel is very generally 
overspread with large pebbles and stones ; and in some places, the 
water flows on a rough bed of naked rock, and forms considerable 
rapids. A little way below the entrance of the Feugh two small 
islands divide its stream. The larger is a low flat, sometimes 
nearly covered by high floods, and about eight or nine acres in 
extent, two- thirds of which are covered with furze and coarse 
grass, and the rest is a beach of pebbles, of which, together with 
sand, nearly the whole is composed. The other islet immediately 
succeeds, and is not above one-eighth of the size of the former. 
It is rather more elevated above the stream, consists chiefly of 
sand, is covered with trees, apparently the product of casual seeds, 
and has an agreeable appearance. Both these islands seem to owe 
their origin chiefly to the substances brought down in the rapid 
and frequently swollen and powerfid stream of the Feugh. They 
are in fact in a great measure its delta, which the superior force 



BANCHORY-TERNAN. , 329 

of the Dee removes a little way beyond its mouth, and has accu- 
mulated according to the gravity of the materials in the place 
where the islands now appear. The larger has increased within 
the memory of several persons alive, and the consequence former- 
ly was, that the stream, being thrown with greater force against 
the northern bank, so corroded it year after year as to destroy the 
site of several houses, and to approach the wall of the churchyard. 
But this work of destruction was delayed in 1811, by the forma- 
tion of a stone embankment, which wards olF the force of the 
stream. Above the junction of the Feugh, where the Dee is 
crossed by a bridge, its medium breadth, depth, and velocity with- 
in the parish may be considered as nearly represented. They are 
found in an average state of the flood to be nearly as follows : — 
Breadth, 175 feet; depth in the middle of the stream, 6 feet 9 
inches; velocity, 1.8 foot per second. The average depth in win- 
ter above that in summer is 8 inches- During the latter season 
the volume of water not unfrequently decreases more than one- 
half. Strong winds from the south and west, by raising waves on 
the surface of several lakes from which the river is fed in the up- 
per parts of its course, are found to affect the level of its waters 
here, often to the extent of one or two feet. During the great 
flood of August 1829, it rose 20 feet 7 inches above its ordinary 
height. 

The Feugh flows for about a mile within the parish, and at 
first presents nothing remarkable in its appearance, besides the 
pools and shallows, with the wide margin of sand and gravel, which 
characterize most mountain streams ; but when it enters the open- 
ing in the secondary ridge of hills that skirts the south side of the 
Dee, it runs between bold precipitous wooded banks, and dashes 
from pool to pool over naked opposing rocks, until within a few 
hundred yards of the river it falls in a divided stream down a 
ledge from fifteen to twenty feet high, and then reuniting in a 
deep basin below, finds its way to the Dee amidst similar rocks, 
and an accumulation of sand. The great height at which its 
sources lie in the neighbouring Grampians, and the comparative 
shortness of its course, subject its volume to so sudden and fre- 
quent changes, that an average estimate of its waters is not easily 
ascertained. Above the fall it is seventy feet broad, and one of 
the pools is about twenty-four feet deep ; but two feet may be re- 
garded as its general depth. Its velocity is conjectured to be 
more than double that of the Dee. A bridge of two principal

arches is thrown over its stream, just below the fall ; and few spots 
in the parish exhibit a more striking view than the alpine scenery 
of this place, especially when the Feugh, swollen by rain, fills the 
whole channel, and with a thundering noise, and foaming waters, 
sweeps through the arches into the whirlpool below. 

Geology, cc. — The hills of Fare and Kerloack consist of nearly 
the same variety of red compact granite. Sulphate of barytes 
occurs in a vein traversing the granite, not far from Corrichie. In 
approaching towards the Dee, on each side, the granite again makes 
its appearance on the intermediate heights ; but it is of a lighter 
colour, and contains a bed or vein of limestone, which is seen first 
on the north side of the river at Glassel ; and, after forming the 
heights of Inchmarlo and Arbeadie, may be traced south-eastward 
for several miles. It seems to run in a direction parallel to the 
vein of red porphyry at the bridge of Potarch. It is seen cros- 
sing the Dee in several places, and where it passes the Feugh, it 
appears to be about 500 yards broad. At its junction with the 
granite in this latter place, the appearance of both rocks is consi- 
derably changed. They become stratified, and put on a structure 
like gneiss or mica-slate, which rocks are not themselves distinctly 
observed in the district, though numerous fragments of them abound 
on all parts of the surface. The limestone, though in some parts 
coarse and impure, is generally compact, and highly crystallized. 
It contains tremolite, and is evidently primitive. At the quarries of 
Tilwhilly, it is manufactured for the purposes of agriculture. A 
ton of the stone yields six bolls of lime, which, owing chiefly to 
the great expense of fuel, costs 2s. 3d. per boll ; while English 
shells, considered by the farmer of nearly double efficiency, can 
be had for 2s. 6d. ; they, therefore, are generally preferred. 
There exists, also, on Tilwhilly, a limestone gravel, which is 
merely the decomposed surface, or withered portions of the above 
rock. It was formerly used in its native state as a top-dressing, 
but is now little heard of. 

The alluvium is, for the most part, a light-coloured scanty clay, 
mixed, especially towards the river, with a large proportion of 
sand and gravel, and containing rolled pebbles and large boulders. 
In the neighbourhood of the Dee, but far above its present level, 
and in some parts of the hollow along the base of the hill of Fare, 
it has accumulated to a considerable depth; but the average 
thickness of the soil does not exceed sixteen inches. The peb- 
bles, in various parts, are as smooth as those of the sea beach, 



BANCHORY'TERNAN. •i'i '

and, too-ether with the sand, are sometinies, though rarely, depo- 
sited in layers. Upon the surface, generally a vast number of 
stones and boulders occur in all positions, and are especially re- 
markable on breaking up and trenching new soil. They then 
often appear covering the ground, as closely as if artificially packed 
upon it, and are of all sizes, from a few pounds to several tons. 
A large proportion of them, when examined, are found to consist 
of fragments of sienite, porphyry, and gneiss, which are here 
otherwise unknown ; and of varieties of granite very different from 
the subjacent rocks. They have their angles generally worn, as 
if by attrition. It seems difficult to account for these and some 
other alluvial appearances of the district, as well as for the names 
given to some of the high grounds, {Inch-marh, and Bra.th-inch, 
or Brathens, without supposing that water had for si time filled 
the greater part of the valley, and afterwards retired into the bed 
of the present river. 

The soil having been formed chiefly by the decomposition of 
granite rocks, and no loamy deposits having been made by the 
streams of the district, is almost everywhere light, and not natu- 
rally fertile. In most places it is not sufficiently retentive of mois- 
ture ; but in some a ferruginous indurated subsoil prevents both 
the deflux of water, and the roots of plants and trees from finding 
sufficient nourishment and depth. In some of the low grounds a 
spongy moss, mixed with gravel, and bearing a coarse grass, pre- 
sents a surface of little value, and difficult to improve, while an 
inadequate drainage renders others swampy for a great part of the 
year, or subjects them to frequent injuries from floods. No plants, 
however, decidedly indicative of a very poor or very inferior soil 
are observed to prevail. The whin and broom grow freely and in 
nearly equal proportions on- the uncultivated tracts ; and the fern, 
the wild-rose, the holly, and the birch are among the most promi- 
i nent indigenous productions. The remains of oak, pine, and ha- 
j zel, which are dug up in great abundance in most of the hollows, 
' attest, along with traditional history, that the surface was formerly 
covered very extensively with natural wood ; and the facility with 
which these and other trees grow, together with the thriving con- 
dition of the present extensive plantations, show that the soil is 
remarkably adapted for rearing various kinds of valuable timber. 
Even for purposes strictly agricultural its capabilities are conside- 
rable, and hold out the prospect, that, when its resources sliali be 



332

more completely developed, the surface will not be more pleasant 
to the eye than profitable to the farmer. 

Botany. — This parish contains several of the rarer British 
plants, and many which, either from their local distribution or 
other circumstances, are deserving of notice. The banks of the 
river are especially rich in vegetable productions, — the number of 
which is increased by the stream bringing down alpine plants and 
seeds from their natural situation, and establishing them upon its 
sides. The fields, woods, moors, and hills abound in such plants 
as generally characterize similar localities. The loch of Leys also 
contains several species of considerable interest. There cannot 
be a doubt that farther research would add several new species to 
the Flora of the parish, although it has been repeatedly subjected 
to botanical investigation. The first of the following lists contains 
those plants which are rare or very local in Britain ; the second 
those which are otherwise interesting : — 

Calamintha Acinos Melampyrum sylvaticum Orchis Morio 

Galium erectum Nuphar puraila Equisetum Mackaii. 

Linnsea borealis 

The last named plant was first found in the parish in 1841, and has 
not, it is believed, been discovered in any other part of Scotland.

The existing plantations are very extensive, being equal to more 
than five-sixths of the arable, and to more than one-fourth of the 
whole surface They consist chiefly of pine and larch, with patches 
of birch, and belts of oak, beech, ash, and some ornamental trees. 
The greater part was planted during the last seventy years, and only 
about one third of the whole is nearly ready for the market. Thesoilj 
especially on the heights near the river, is generally well adapted for 
oak and other bard woods. Larch is found, however, to give way 
after twenty or thirty years on certain dry and thin soil§, and to be-: 
come diseased in the heart. Pines grow most profitably in the hoi-

lows and towards the base of the hills, while, at some intermediate 
places, birch is found readily to thrive. More attention is now 
given than formerly to adapt the trees to the locality in which 
they are planted, and, owing to the decreasing value of fir timber, 
and the quantity in this district about to be brought into the mar- 
ket at once, the proportion of hard-wood is greatly on the increase. 
More than 2t0,000 larches and 66,000 oaks have been planted 
on the estate of Leys alone, within the last three years. 

Among the most remarkable trees are numerous yews, all of 
natural growth, springing from the top of the rocks at Crathes. 
Some of them are 5 feet girth at the base. Among several gi- 
gantic specimens of the common holly, one occurs on the side of 
the public road leading to Aberdeen, about a mile from the 
church, which springs from the sides and crevices of a rock, and 
has upwards of twenty stems proceeding apparently from the same 
root. It is 20 feet high, and shades an area of more than 36 feet 
square. It is supposed to be at least 200 years old. In the 
grounds of Crathes castle, there is also a magnificent beech, which 
was planted in 1706, and is 25 feet in girth, about 60 feet high, 
and contains 320 cubic feet of timber. 

Zoology. — Twenty-four species of quadrupeds, and 1 II of birds, 
are found either permanently or occasionally in this district. The 
following lists, it is believed, are nearly complete. 

Mammalia. Martes foina Mus messorius 

Plecotus auritus Lutra vulgaris Arvicola amphibius 

Vespertilio murinus Vulpes vulgaris agrestis 

Sorex araneus Felis catus Lepus timidus 

lalpa Europasa Mus rattus variabilis 

Meles taxus decumanus cuniculus 

Mustella putorius musculus Cervus elaphus 

erminea ■ sylvaticus capreolus 

vulgaris 

The roe is more common here than in most other districts of the 
country, but the red-deer is only occasionally seen in the woods. 
The Cervus dama, or fallow-deer, is now found wild in the neigh- 
bourhood of Blackball; but it is understood to have been intro- 
duced by a late proprietor. Rabbits are said to have been almost 
unknown till a few from a distance were placed on the islands 
of the Dee, about thirty years ago. They passed over the ice 
in winter, and have now become everywhere so numerous as to 
Tender their destruction necessary.

Eagles visit Kerloack only in early spring, when the lambs be- 
ffin to appear. They are occasionally taken by the gamekeepers 
in traps, and when their legs are bound, they make no resistance 
with their beak, but are carried like a turkey under the arm. The 
ptarmigan was formerly seen on the hill of Fare, but has long 
since disappeared. The oyster- catcher breeds in the islands ot 
the Dee, where it arrives with the greatest regularity about the 
arst week of March, and leaves about the end of June. In very dry 
seasons, they may be observed returning to their nests with dess- 
worms at midnight, and their cry is heard often at all hours. A 
beautiful specimen of the glossy ibis, or Brazilian curlew, was 
shot at the loch of Leys, September 1842, 

The fishes of the Dee and its tributary streams present in this 
district no remarkable variety. They are the Gasterosteus pung. 
tivs, the JnguiUa vulgaris, the Platessa Jicsus, the Esox luctus, 
the So/mo trutta, and the S.fario. 

About twenty years ago, the salmon was so common that a go d 
angler could generally catch six to ten a day, but the utmost and

rare limit of his success is now two, or at most three. The salmon 
fry generally go down the river to the sea in April or May, and 
are supposed to return grilse in June. 

Muscles {Mytilus cygneiis are found in the Ganny, which 
"Was formerly celebrated for its pearls. 

Of reptiles, besides the common toad, and the common and edi- 
ble frog, there are the Triton aquaticus, and the T. palustris, — 
the water and the warty eft, the Lacerta agilis — the nimble lizard, 
the Anguis fragilis or blind-worm, and the Vipera communis, or 
common adder. The bite of this species has here been found 
poisonous. The leg of a woman, bitten lately by it, became great- 
ly swollen on the third day up to the top of the thigh, with a con- 
siderable discoloration ecchymosis in the ham. Specimens of a ' 
serpent upwards of four feet long have several times been found ; 
but whether it be the adder at an advanced stage of its growth, of 
whether it be a distinct species, is unknown. 

Nothing in the entomology of the parish, as hitherto observed, 
seems to require particular notice. Insects are numerous, and in 
considerable variety, especially moths. 

II. — Civil History. 
At Cairnton, on the east end of the hill and ancient wood of 
Trustach, near a steep bank of the Dee, there is a slightly hollow 
place, overgrown with birch, about 150 yards square, which, on 
its north and only open side, has two ramparts of earth, each 300 
yards long, from 10 to 15 yards high, and 1 6 broad. They converge 
from the bank on each side, and complete two sides of a square, 
the rest of which is formed by the nature of the ground. They 
do not, however, meet, but leave an entrance at the angle about 20 
yards wide. A large body of men might lie within them without 
being easily observed. The position is moderately elevated, and 
commands a pass between the heights of Inchmarlo and the Dee, 
through whicli the present road lies. It overlooks almost every 
.approach, and has the river immediately behind, and the Canny 
at a little distance in the haugh below. No traditions respecting 
it exist, and, as the spot is rather sequestered, it is very little 
known. But it has evidently been a strong and well-selected en'- 
campment. Its massive structure and general appearance, com- 
pared with their undoubted remains in other parts of the country, 
•incline some to think that it owes its origin to the Romans. The 
name of the place would indicate, perhaps, the site of a battle, but 
Ihere are no cairns or tumuli at present to be seen. On thfe

moorhinds, at the bottom and sides of the hills, north and south, aro 
many stone cairns, and others of a similar kind are said to have 
formerly existed in various central parts of the parish. One of these, 
lately opened, contained a small coffin about a yard long, formed of 
rude stones, with a little dust within. Another had various bones of 
a human skeleton without any coffin. In the neighbourhood of those 
near Kerloack, on the farms of Eslie and Garrol, are three stone 
circles, the largest about 25 yards diameter, and the others about 
15. In each, the remains of an inner circle are visible, within 
which is a small cairn, and in all, the outer circles are tolerably 
complete, containing what is called the altar stone, placed due 
south, and of nearly the same dimensions in each, 8 feet long, and 
4 high. The whole are composed of micaceous schist, with some 
limestone and granite, the common stones of the place. In the 
moors around, besides many small cairns, and some traces of for- 
mer cultivation, there is a place called Knocking or Rocking- 
stone ; and a small peat bog, in which, twenty years ago, a circu- 
lar copper vessel, apparently very ancient, and of very rude work- 
manship, was found. " It had a rim at the mouth, which was 
turned outward, and perforated with three holes. It had also the 
appearance of having had a handle attached to it." Though few 
places can be more bare and sterile than this situation is at pre- 
sent, all the hollows contain, imbedded in peat moss overlying 
clay to the depth of 10 to 30 feet, abundant remains of trees, 
which have evidently undergone the action of fire. 

In a wall opposite the manse is a hollow, which represents with 
the original stones the shape, size, and situation of a coffin, found 
when excavating the ground for the present road to Aberdeen. 
It contained an urn of tolerable workmanship, with some ashes. 
About a mile and a half farther west, in a belt of planting between 
the same road and the Dee, a stone is seen standing, 8 feet high 
above ground, and 13 feet in circumference, which is the only re- 
mains of a large Druidical circle, almost entire about fifty years ago. 

At the period to which these antiquities must be referred, the 
surface formed a part of that great marshy forest, which, after- 
wards known under several divisions and names, extended from 
Mar to Aberdeen, along the course of the Dee. It was occupied 
by a people of Celtic origin, for all the more ancient names of 
places and objects are certainly Gaelic, and was necessarily tra- 
versed by those crossing the Grampians from the Menrns, through 
the pass" called Cairn o' Month, to the more fertile districts of 



BANCHORY-TERNAN. 



337 



Garioch .ind Biichan. Subsequently it became also the route of 
pilgrims from these districts to the shrine of Palladius at For- 
doun ; but the first recorded notice the writer has been able to 
obtain of the possession of property within the parish, although 
the chartulary of Arbroath must contain several previous, is a. d. 
1233, when King Alexander II., by a charter dated at " Kyn- 
tor," confirmed a grant made by the celebrated Allan the 
Durward to the monks of the Abbey of Arbroath of the wood of 
' Trostach," lying between the waters of " De and Kanyn." 

It is stated by Robertson, " General View of Kincardine- 
shire, App. IX,," on the authority of the Rev. Dr Keith of 
Keith Hall, that this parish formed " anciently a part of the 
extensive domains of Fraser, Thane of Cowie, who, by mar- 
riage, was connected with the Royal family ; and in consequence 
of his desire to have all his territories placed under his own juris- 
diction, as lord-lieutenant or sheriff of the Mearns, it was attach- 
ed to that county," though formerly belonging to Aberdeenshire. 
" It came afterwards under the rule of the Great Marischal, Sir 
Robert William Keith, who married a grand -daughter of 
that chief, and was continued afterwards to be conjoined to that 
county, although the territorial connection with its judges had 
ceased." This Thane of Cowie seems to have been Sir Alexan- 
der, nephew of the famous Sir Simon Fraser, " who was with his 
uncle at the battle of Methven, 1306, and who, adhering after- 
wards to the interest of King Robert Bruce, was honoured with 
the marriage of Lady Margaret, the King's sister." 

In 1324, King Robert Bruce gave to Alexander de Burnard, 
an ancestor of the present Sir Thomas Burnet of Leys, "dilecto 
et fideli suo pro debitis in quibus sibi tenebatur" the lands of 
" Killienach Clerach," in Drumoak, together with lands in Ban- 
chory, " within his forest of  Drom,' and without the park of the 
said forest." These latter seem to have comprehended about one- 
half of this parish north of the Dee ; the other half was then 
in the possession of the convent of Arbroath, to which also the 
cure and tithes of the parish belonged. 

In 1479, the lands of Tilwhilly were held by Walter Ocston 
of Ogston, near Fettercairn, under the abbot and convent of 
Arbroath as the superiors; but David Douglas, grandson of James 
the second Lord of Dalkeith, having married his daughter Janet 
they passed into the possession of his descendants.

In 15-28, the present Caslle of Crathes was built by a son of 
the above Alexander Burnett; and, in 1576, the castle of Til- 
whilly, by John Douglas, great-grandson of David, the first laird. 
The old manse, it is believed, was erected about the same, or a 
somewhat earlier period, for the use of the " vicaris of Banqu- 
horiterne." It still shows traces of the insecurity of the times, 
and of the comparative splendour which the church then main- 
tained. 

In 156-2, was fought a battle between Queen Mary's forces, 
under the Earl of Moray, and the Earl of Huntly, in the " Howe 
of Corrichie," a glen in the hill of Fare. The place, at first view, 
seems but a small opening, giving vent to a torrent on the southern 
side of the hill ; but turning rather abruptly to the left, it presents 
a spacious hollow about two miles in length, stretching into the 
very centre of the hill, with steep sides and a marshy bottom. 
" Vpoun the xxviij of October," says the " Diurnal of Occur- 
rents," p. 73. Ed. 1833, " my lord of Huntlie was lyand with 
ane army of his folkis at Lochskenc, to the nomber of viijc men, 
io have cumin aganies my lord of Murray and vlheris quha was

of the cuntrey past the samyn day furth of Abirdene in thair best 
array : and efter thaj haid chaisit the erle Huntlie and his cum- 
pany sex myles fra Lochskene, to ane place callit Cori'echic, and 
skarmischand with him," the fire of the arquebusses drove him 
to the low marshy level of the ' Howe,' and nearly the half of 
his followers left him in the night previous to the battle. Most 
of the country people, however, favoured him; and many in 
the ranks of his enemies had been corrupted by his means : 
" thaj send word to my lord of Murray to come with the Louthiane 
men quha wer thair at that tyme ; quha come, and at their cuming, 
the wangaird maid thame the battell ; bot incontinent thairefter, 
thai fled back vpoun the gentilmen of Louthiane, and, as sum 
sayis, purposing to have causit lharae to flie and to be ourrun, to 
the effect the erle of Huntlie mycht have obtinit the victorie ; 
bot the said gentilmen of Louthiane stuid fermlie still, and the 
said erllis cumpany, cumand vpoun the said gentilmene, was put 
vpon thair bakkis with speiris, and thairefter fled, quhair followit 
greit slauchter." On Huntly's side, 120 were slain, and nearly 
as many taken prisoners. Among the latter was the Earl, " who 
being aged and corpulent, and by reason of the throng which 
pressed him, expired in the hands of his takers." " He was tane by 
Andro Reidpath, one of our soverane ladle's gaird." The Queen 
herself is reported to have been present, and to have beheld the 
battle from a rocky seat overlooking the whole field, still called 
Queen Mary's Chair. In the bottom of the glen, there are several 
heaps, which seem to mark an encampment, and various cairns, 
which are easily distinguished from others beside them of a more 
ancient date. But on the north side of the estate of Glassel, 
where it is said the chief carnage took place, are several larger 
tumuli, which are supposed to be the graves of the Gordons over- 
taken in their flight. An old ballad, sometimes heard among the 
peasantry of the district, mentions, among others present on the 
Queen's side, the Burnetts of Leys, the Irvines of Drum, and 
the Frasers of Durris. It is certain that John Douglas of Til- 
whilly obtained a pardon, under the Great Seal, for himself and 
his followers, for assisting Huntly in the battle. He was much 
befriended by Morton while Regent, who, on one occasion, is 
said to have lived incognito at his house of Tilwhilly, and passed 
under the name of " James the Grieve." 

In 15 57, John, Commendator of Arbroath, and the whole con-

vent, signed a charter of resignation of the kinds of Pittenkcrrie, 
Brathens, Invery, and the kirk lands of Banchory, in favour of 
Alexander Burnett and his heirs-male, &amp;c. ; which lands were 
incorporated into the barony of Leys, by a charter of James VI. 
1595, containing a novodamus of tlie whole. In this condition, 
that estate, with the exception of the parts known under the names 
of Raemoir, Giassel, and Invery, remains with the descendants 
of its original proprietors. All the other properties in the parish 
have changed hands. The fourth son of the said Alexander Bur- 
nett was Gilbert, educated at the University of Aberdeen, and af- 
terwards a Professor of Philosophy, first at Basle, and then at 
Montauban. He was held in such esteem, that a national synod 
of the Protestants in France appointed his philosophical writings 
to be published at the expense of their clergy ; but, he dying be- 
fore his manuscripts were arranged, his book of Ethics only was 
printed. 

In 1638, Sir Thomas Burnett of Leys, who had been created 
a Baronet by Charles I., and who was the eldest brother of James 
Burnett of Craigmyle, from whom the Burnetts of Monboddo are 
descended, and of Lord Crimond, the father of Bishop Burnett 
of Salisbury, became one of the most conspicuous in the north 
against the measures of the Court ; and, with the lairds of Dun, 
Morphey, and Carnegie, proceeded through various districts as 
commissioner, and accompanied the Marquis of Montrose to Aber- 
deen, where they subscribed the Covenant with certain limitations, 
of which Dr William Guild, minister there, and Mr Robert Reid, 
minister of this parish, were the ostensible authors. He lived, 
however, on friendly terms with the heads of the opposite party, 
and finding, at length, that both sides were unreasonably deter- 
mined on extremities, he retired from public life, and remained 
unmolested by either. He was a patron of learning, and mortified 
to the College of Old Aberdeen, " four crofts for three bursars of 
philosophy," the annual revenue of which has increased to L.318, 
6s. 7d. He, besides, erected and endowed, conjunctly with Dr 
Alexander Reid, two schools in the village of Banchory, " a gram- 
mar-school for boys, and a sewing-school for girls." He also 
erected and endowed, with 6300 merks, an hospital or alms-house 
for six poor men or women, commuted afterwards into an annual 
allowance in money to the poor on the barony of Leys. Some 
of his manuscript papers and letters indicate a cultivated mtellect, 
and a generous sympathy with the relig on, liberty, and learnmg

oF his counlry. His grandson, Thomas, the third Baronet, sat for 
Kincardineshire in the Scottish Parliament of 1703. 

About 1647, Robert Douglas, brother of Sir Archibald Dou- 
glas, and son-in-law to Lord Audley, succeeded to the family es- 
tate of Tilwhilly, and, having accepted the honour of knighthood 
and a high command from the Royalists, had his house here garri- 
soned by the Covenanters, and was himself obliged ultimately to 
retire to the continent with the ruin of all his property. His only 
daughter was married in 1665 to George Crichton of Cluny, who 
erected, in ]666, Cluny Castle, now a small picturesque ruin on 
the estate of Raemoir, and whose name soon after ceases to be 
known in the parish. His grandson Gilbert, a companion of the 
Duke of Wharton's, left no issue, and the family estate passed to 
his brother, James Douglas of Inchmarlo, who, in 1630, had ac- 
quired that property from the Douglases of Glenbervie, into whose 
hands it had fallen after the Reformation. The youngest son of 
• this James Douglas was Archibald, a clergyman, who succeeded 
Bishop Burnet in the living of Saltoun, and who was the grand- 
father of Bishop Douglas of Salisbury. 

On the 11th of September 1644, Montrose having crossed 
the Dee by the ford at Mills of Drum, and, having summoned the 
laird of Leys to surrender his house, which he immediately did, 
" supped with him the same night, together with his guard." Next 
day he marched down to Aberdeen, and defeated the Covenan- 
ters. Part of his soldiers' entrenchment is still visible in the cas- 
tle grounds. The remains of his encampment on a subsequent 
occasion, probably when he ravaged the Barony of Echt in pas- 
sing this way to Strathbogie, are to be seen not far from the 
entrance of the Howe of Corrichie, and are known by the name 
of " Montrose's dike." His reply to a poor widow, who, after 
his defeat in 1645, when he again visited the neighbourhood, re- 
proached him with his former cruelty, is still repeated as a sort of 
proverbial saying by some old people here. 

The register of the Barony Court of Leys between 1621 and 
1709 is in existence, and contains much curious information of lo- 
cal interest. The majority of the suits refer to pecuniary trans- 
actions, but many are petty offences, and some public and private 
arrangements, such as, 1. deforcing officiaris ;" " stricking and 
dinging ;" " hurting, wounding, and bluid-shedding « comtttino- 
ane ryalt " making ane strugle « flytting and bakbyting ;" 
" being ane unlawfu' and infiimous man " appealing from "the

" braking doun dykis of parkis and woodis ;" " cuting grass in 
plantations and green wood," &amp;c. 2. " Absence from the wapin- 
schaw ;" " discerning the haill tennentis in the barrony to be at 
the place appointit for haddin out the hielandmen f " obliging 
the haill tennentis to go to the service of the camp for the defens

irne wark with James Smith, and to pay him thair smyddy bow 
zeirly." " Discerning brewsteris to furnisch the laird's Stewart

The punishments are, — " the price of ane quart of ale ; 20 sh. ; 
40 pundis Scotis; loss of moweables ; escheiting of hail guidis to 
the laird ; sitting 24 howris in the stokkis ; banischment from the 
laird's landis, and pulling down the hous of the offender," &amp;c. 

The court sat about four times a year, and the average number 
of cases was 27. 

Eminent Men. — The 6rst minister of this parish after the Re- 
formation was Mr James Reid cir. 1580, a younger son of Mr Reid 
of Pitfoddels, a gentleman, of very ancient family in the county of 
Aberdeen. He was succeeded by his son Robert 1620 ; subse- 
quently by Alexander Cant, a relation of the celebrated Andrew ; 
and afterwards by his great-grandson Mr Robert Reid 1662. 
" James Reid," says Gordon of Rothiemay, " was a man of a nota- 
ble head-piece for witte, and the most part of his children were men 
of extraordinar qualifications." His son, Thomas, studied under 
Lipsius, and, after travelling over Europe, he became Greek and 
Latin secretary to James I., and lived in habits of intimacy with 
some of the most distinguished characters of that period. He col- 
lected in a volume and published the theses which he had defend- 
ed at foreign universities, De objecto Metaphysicse, London, 
1616, and some of his Latin poems were inserted in the Delicice 
Poet. Scot. Barclay gives his paraphrase of the 104th Psalm a 
hio-h place among the efforts which were made by the eminent 
scholars of the time to clothe that beautiful hymn in a Latin dress; 
" et propter elegantiam carminis, et propter expressionem prophe- 
tee mentis prse cseteris, et propter antiquitatis et doctrinae non ob- 
scura argumenta." Dempster also praises him as " a man of great 
eminence." He bequeathed to the Marischal College of Aber- 
deen a collection of books and MSS., with a fund for establishing 
a salary to a librarian. His brother, Dr Alexander Reid, was 



nANCHORY-Tl.RXAN.

Physician to Charles I., and piiblishpd several works on anatomy 
and surgery,  1634-] 099. " Inter medicos Londinenses," says 
Professor Smith, " sni temporis primus habitus splendide vixit, 
immensas congessit opes, et stupenda reliquit pietatis suae monu- 
menta." Besides other valuable donations during his lifetime, he 
bequeathed to the College of Old Aberdeen " L.200 Sterling, 
the yearly profit of L.lOO to come to the help of the gramarier's 
stipend, and the other for the help of the regents'. He left also 
his whole medicine books for the College library," Alb. Colleg. 
Abdn. He mortified for the use of a grammar school in Ban- 
chory 4000 merks, and 1800 for the maintenance of a woman's 
school. He also left the annual rent of L.lOO to the poor, and 
of the same sum to the minister of the parish. A third son, John, 
translated into English Buchanan's Historv of Scotland. It was 
never published, but exists in manuscript in the University of 
Glasgow. In a preface to the first volume of a manuscript Calder- 
wood, this John is said to have been " servitur and writer to Mas- 
ter George Buchanan." Besides other eminent individuals de- 
scended from this family, was the distinguished Dr Thomas Reid, 
Professor of Moral Philosophy in Glasgow. His father, minister 
of Strachan, was a son of the above Mr Robert Reid, minister of 
this parish in 1662. The burial-place of the family is in this 
churchyard, where several of them lie interred ; and a monument 
erected over them is kept in repair by the kirk-session, in terms 
of the bequest of one of them to the poor. 

The session registers begin the 10th of May 1670, those pre- 
vious to that date having been destroyed, " first, in the burning of 
the schoole, 1664, and lately by the burning of the schoolmaster's 
chamber." There is a blank between October 1677 and No- 
vember 1682. A separate register for baptisms and marriages 
commences 1682. Nothing in these records requires particular 
notice. There appears to have been, since the Reformation to 
1830, eight incumbents in the parish, giving an average for each 
incumbency of 31.25 years. 

It is a curious circumstance, that two ancient families, whose 
residences are in view of each other on opposite sides of the Dee, 
{Crathes Castle and Tilwhilly, should eachhave given a prelate 
Bishop Burnett and Bishop Douglas to the same see Salisbury 
in the English church ; both men eminent in their way as divines 
and as authors. It is also singular, that two of the ablest defen- 
ces of Christianity against the scepticism of Hume siiould have

emanated from individuals connected with this parish Dr Camp-' 
bell's Essay on Miracles, and Bishop Douglas's Criterion. 

Dr Gilbert Burnett, Bishop of Salisbury, was the eldest son of 
Robert Burnett of Crimond, appointed one of the Lords of Ses- 
sion at the Restoration. He was born at Edinburgh, 18th Sep- 
tember 1643, but was educated in the country under his father, 
until his tenth year, when he entered the college at Aberdeen. 
After the usual courses he took his degree, before he was fourteen 
years of age, along with James Gregory, the celebrated inventor 
of the reflecting telescope, 1657. He then commenced the 
study of civil and feudal law; but, relinquishing it after a year, 
devoted himself wholly to divinity, with such diligence and suc- 
cess, that, before he was eighteen, he was licensed as a probationer 
or preacher of the Gospel, and was offered by his cousin-german. 
Sir Alexander Burnett, the living of this parish. He refused, 
however, to accept it on account of his youth, and, wisely bent on 
improving himself, spent several years in the study of the best 
authors on divinity, in intercourse with some of the greatest and 
most learned men of the age, and in foreign travel, before he at 
length accepted from Sir Robert Fletcher, his father's friend, the 
living of Saltoun, in the county of Haddington. There he conti- 
nued for five years, and discharged the functions of a parochial 
minister in an exemplary manner. An account of his subsequent 
eventful and important career, both in this country, and in Eng- 
land, must be sought in the several biographies written of him. 
The " History of his own Time," published after his death, 1724, 
has an account of his life by his youngest son, who was one of the 
Judges of the Court of Common Pleas. He published in his life- 
time 68 single sermons, 13 treatises or tracts in divinity, 17 on 
the Papist controversy, 26 political and miscellaneous, and 24 
historical and biographical. He kept up occasional intercourse 
with his relations in this place till his death ; but only one or two 
unimportant letters of his have been preserved. He sent his por- 
trait, painted by Sir Godfrey Kneller, to be kept in Crathes 
Castle, where it still remains ; and he appointed the Baronets of 
Leys patrons of the bursaries which he left to the Marischal Col- 
lege of Aberdeen. The original sum. was 1000 merks; but, in 
1835, the stock amounted to L.1389, 12s. 8d., nearly the whole 
interest of which is paid to four bursars in arts, and two in divinity. 

John Douglas, D. D., also Bishop of Salisbury, was born at 
Pittenweem, Fifeshire, 1721. His father, a respectable merchant,

was, as formerly intimated, the son of the youngest brother of 
John Douglas, Esq. of Tilwhilly. He commenced his education 
at Dunbar, but was soon removed to Oxford, where he was first 
entered as a commoner, and afterwards elected an exhibitioner 
on Bishop Werner's foundation in Baliol College. Becoming a 
curate in 1747, he was recommended by a friend to the Earl of 
Bath as a travelling tutor to his son ; and the history of his sub- 
sequent life is little else than a chronicle of the honours and pre- 
ferments which were heaped upon him, chiefly through the pa- 
tronage of that family. He received several livings in the church, 
and became, successively, Canon of Windsor and of St Paul's, 
President of Zion College, a Trustee of the British Museum, 
Bishop of Carlisle, and was ultimately removed to the See of Sa- 
lisbury. He was a favourite in the Royal Palace, and an esteemed 
member of Dr Johnson's Club. Nothing is perhaps more re- 
markable in his long career, than his uniform good fortune. He 
died, May 1807, in the eighty- sixth year of his age. Before his 
preferment in England, he kept up intercourse with his relations 
at Tilwhilly, and visited them occasionally. His first literary 
work was the Vindication of Milton from the Charges of Lauder, 
1750. The Criterion of Miracles was published four years 
afterwards. Besides these, he wrote two controversial treatises 
in theology, four in history, eight political pamphlets, five pre- 
faces, or introductions with notes, &amp;c. to books, two sermons, and 
one volume of travels, left in manuscript. His select works, con- 
sisting chiefly of the " Vindication," " Criterion," and an Account 
of his Continental Tour, were printed in 1 volume, 4to, with a life 
by his son. 

Dr George Campbell, born 25th December 1719, was the son 
of the Rev. Colin Campbell, one of the ministers of Aberdeen. 
His father was a descendant of Campbell of Moy, who was a cadet 
of the family of Argyll ; but of this parent he was deprived at 
nine years of age, and had the energy of his character early stimu- 
lated by difficulties into exertion and self-reliance. He studied 
at Marischal College, under the celebrated Blackwell ; and hav- 
ing originally intended to follow the profession of the law, he sub- 
sequently became an apprentice to a Writer to the Signet in 
Edinburgh. Before, however, the term of his apprenticeship ex- 
pired, he renounced that intention, and devoted himself to divinity. 
He began his theological studies in Edinburgh, and finished them 
in Aberdeen, where he was licensed as a preacher, 11th June

1746. After being two years a probationer, the reputation of his 
learning and ability attracted the notice of Sir Thomas Burueit 
of Leys, who, though personally unacquainted with hinn, and un- 
solicited by any of Mr Campbell's friends, generously presented 
him with the living of Banchory. The date of his settlement is 
25th November 1747. " It was while he held this charge," says 
his friend and biographer, Dr Keith, " that the powers of his mind 
began more fully to unfold themselves, and his character to rise 
in the opinion of men of learning. In a short time he was con- 
sidered the best lecturer, or expounder of Holy Scripture in this 
part of the country. It was while explaining the New Testament 
to his parishioners, that he first formed a plan of translating the 
four Gospels, which he afterwards published ; and it was in this 
country parish, long before any attention was paid in the 'north of 
Scotland to the niceties of grammar, that he composed a part of 
his Philosophy of Rhetoric." It appears that his celebrated 
Dissertation on Miracles, first drawn up in the form of a ser- 
mon preached before the synod, October 1769, was begun also 
in this place, and that the scenery and circumstances then exist- 
ino- around him afforded several of its illustrations. Only a few 
memorials of his incumbency exist, and but a few faint recol- 
lections of him remain among some of the oldest parishioners. 
An apartment, with a turreted window, in the old manse, is 
shown to strangers as his study ; and the old oak pulpit, in 
which he preached, is still preserved. The session records show 
that, under his ministry, the former severity of kirk censures was 
somewhat relaxed; arid a few trivial incidents mentioned, indi- 
cate, as might be expected, a firm and judicious management. 
The weak state of his health seems to have required his occa- 
sional absence, and, along with his studious habits, prevented those 
laborious exertions among his parishioners which distinguished 
some of his predecessors. It is still reported, and of this there 
are some traces in the register, that certain parties in the parish 
endeavoured to render his situation unpleasant, and that this, with 
his literary and philosphical tastes, made him desirous of a remov- 
■ al to town. After he had been here nine years, he became one 
of the ministers of Aberdeen, 23d June 1757. Subsequently he 
was made Principal, and afterwards Professor of Divinity in Ma- 
rischal College. On the Sunday previous to his settlement in 
Aberdeen, he preached a farewell discourse to his congregation, 
from 2d Corinthians xiii. 11, which seems to have produced a

deep impression. An old man who died lately, used to refer to 
it as his earliest remembrance, and called it " the great greeting 
in the Kirk o' Banchory." The subsequent events of Dr C.'s life, 
and an account of his various writings, will be found detailed in the 
account of him prefixed to his " Lectures on Ecclesiastical His- 

I tory." The incidents we have noticed, minute and trivial as they 

I may be, are yet, perhaps, not entirely without interest in consi- 
dering the character of a man |'whom Scotland justly boasts as 
one of her greatest philosophers, and the church regards as one 
of her ablest champions and brightest ornaments. " Reid," said 
Robert Hall of Leicester, " had a more vigorous and original mind 
than Stewart, but Campbell, I suspect, was superior to both. He 

I could have done all that Reid or Stewart has accomplished, and 
neither of them could have written his ' Preliminary Dissertations' 
to his work on the Gospels." A sagacious acuteness was a pro- 
minent feature in his intellect. It is exhibited remarkably in 
some published specimens of his correspondence with DeanTuck- 

t er. A love of truth and fairness was a strong characteristic of his 
moral nature. " Purity, seriousness, and candour," said he, " are 
the only sure guides to the temple of religious truth." He had a 
liigh, but not a proud sense of" the dignity belonging to personal 
worth, and there are evidences, not generally recognized, that at 
least at the close of his life, his inward practical sense of religion 
was deep and sincere. He died 6th April 1796, in the 77th year 
of his age. 

Land-owners. — The principal land-owners are. Sir Thomas 
Burnett of Leys, Bart. ; William Innes, Esq. of Raemoir ; Henry 
' Lnmsden, Esq. of Tilwhilly ; Lieutenant W. B. Ramsay of Ban- 
chory Lodge; Anthony Mactier, Esq. ofDurris; Duncan David- 
son, Esq. of Inchmarlo ; John Mitchell, Esq. of Forcett Hall 
and Glassel; and Colonel John Campbell of Blackball. All 
these, except Mr Lumsden, Mr Mactier, and Colonel Campbell, 
have mansion-houses within the parish. 

Modern Buildings. — Crathes Castle, the seat of the family of 
Leys, situated on a green bank, at the end of a ridge of wooded 
rocks, and embosomed among fine trees, is an imposing baronial 
structure, consisting of a tall square tower having ornamented tur- 
rets, in the Scotch castellated style, and of some modern additions. 
The walls are massive, and it was formerly considered capable of 
defence. The ancient hall or dining-room is in good preserva- 
tion, and contains some family portraits painted by Jamieson.

KINCARDINESHIIIE. 



The castle of Tllwliilly, built on the slope of a iiill on the other 
side of the Dee, commands an extensive prospect towards Aber- 
deen. It is formed of several plain massive buildings, communi- 
cating with each other, and apparently erected at different periods 
without much plan. It ceased to be the residence of that branch 
of the Douglas family upwards of 100 years ago, and is now oc- 
cupied by the tenant of the surrounding farm. It contains nume- 
rous apartments, and has a dark vault, formerly used, it is said, 
as a prison. The entrance of the whole is still furnished with the 
ancient grille and bar. 

The other mansions are elegant and commodious modern build- 
ings, remarkable chiefly for their interesting situations, and the 
beauty of their grounds. The villas, which, are all situated along the 
Dee, display very considerable taste. The church, which existed at 
the Reformation, was placed in the burying-ground, near the brink 
of the river. The only remains of this ancient building area frag- 
ment of the font, bearing the arms of the Abbey of Arbroath, and 
one or two other unimportant relics. It was rebuilt in 1775, and 
being found too small and inconvenient in 1824, it was removed 
a few hundred yards to a higher situation, on the opposite side 
of the public road. It is a plain substantial building, in the Gothic 
style, sufficiently neat and commodious within, but defectivejn hav- 
ing the tower in front too low, and in having neither a vestry nor 
porches behind. 

The Bridge of Dee was first erected by public subscription in 
1798. It consisted of a central wooden arch, 175 feet wide, hav- 
ing a smaller stone arch of half that width on each side, and a 
small supplemental one of 19 feet on the south bank. After the 
flood of 1829, it had fallen into such disrepair, that an iron truss 
arch was substituted for the wooden, at the expense of the trustees 
of the Stonehaven road. It is a singular but not a very commo- 
dious structure, and harmonizes but indifferently with its fine situa- 
tion. The bridge of Feugh is a strong plain erection, agreeing 
tolerably well with its position. The material employed in these 
and other buildings within the parish is chiefly granite. 

III. — Population. 

The average number of annual births from 1700 to 1712 was 
53, and of marriages, 14; while the average of births from 1830 
to 1840 was 50, and of marriages, 16. The population must 
therefore have been, in 1700, about 2077. 



BANCHORY-TERNAN.

Making due allowance for some inaccuracy in the first three of 
these statements, the population would still appear to have been 
remarkably great here at the beginning of the last century, espe- 
cially when it is considered that not more than one-third of the 
present arable land was then in cultivation, and its productive 
powers perhaps scarcely one-half. Almost all the grain raised was 
consumed at home. Even in 1 758 there were but two carts in the 
whole parish. From 1650 to 1709, meal cost L.4 to L.IO Scots 
per boll; an ox, 12 merks; a sheep, 5 merks. Retainers, sub- 
tenants, and the occupiers of small patches of land are known to 
have been very numerous. The salmon of the Dee was plentiful, 
and constituted a considerable part of the sustenance of the la- 
bouring classes, who were, however, in some instances, in a 
wretchedly poor condition as respects the comforts and conveni- 
ences of life. The decrease between 1766 and 1791 is said to 
" have been owing to the emigration of the work people to the 
manufactories it Aberdeen ; to some of the heritors taking large 
farms under their own management ; to some of the farmers not 
choosing to have subtenants; and to a very uncommon mortality 
which prevailed in the winter of 1789." Old Stat. During tliis 
period a whole hamlet disappeared, in the northern part of the 
parish alone. The number of oxen employed in tillage fell to 
one-half; and the greatest part of about 150 acres, still bearing 
the marks of former cultivation, then became waste. The sub- 
sequent increase since 1801 beyond the common rate of aug- 
mentation, arises chiefly from the greater number of labourers 
drawn together by the spirited and constant improvements of the 
landlords; from the greater extent of surface brought into culti- 
vation, affording many possessions entirely new ; from the greater 
number of farm-servants thereby rendered necessary ; from an in- 
crease of resident capitalists ; and from the formation of a flourish- 
ing village. 

The average number of births, for the last ten years, as already 
stated, was 50 ; of these, 5 were illegitimate. The average num- 
ber of marriages, from 1831 to 1836, was 16, and of funerals, 43 
nearly. In 1838, there were 5 still-born. In 1841, 380 persons 



350 



KINCAUDINESHIUE. 



under sixteen, were attending school, and 62 persons in the parish 
were above 70 years of age. The wiiole population consisted of 
1073 males, and 1167 females, inhabiting 501 houses, and consti- 
tuting 535 families. Of these families, 26 are those of proprietors, 
capitalists, and professional men. About 125 are employed in trade 
and handicraft; 246 belong to occupiers of land, 12 of whom pay 
L.lOO and upwards of rent; 46 pay L.50 and above; 17 between 
L.50 and L.20; 171 below L,20 ; nearly one-half of the whole 
of these occupiers of land are also labourers, and earn wages 
through a part of the year ; 49 families are those of paupers, and 
the rest labourers and servants. The population, though mixed, 
is Celtic in its general character, spirit, and appearance ; but 
there is no historical or traditional account of the Gaelic lan- 
guage having been spoken in the parish. No particular names 
seem at any time to have prevailed among the inhabitants ; nor, 
with some exceptions, do the descendants of the same families 
appear to have remained within the parish since 1688. 

Illicit distillation formerly prevailed to a great extent, and pro- 
duced its baneful effects on the morals of the people ; but it has 
been suppressed for many years. The floating of wood is an oc- 
cupation which seems to have an unfavourable effect on the cha- 
racter and habits of those who engage in it ; but, happily, very 
few here undertake this employment. Poaching is not remarkably 
common. There has been one criminal case from this place be- 
fore the High Court of Justiciary, and fourteen before the She- 
riff's Court during the last ten years. Nine of these were thefts 
committed by strangers in the parish ; five were cases of assault 
by inhabitants. 

IV. — Industry. 

The number of imperial acres cultivated is 6069. About 665, 
now lying waste, might be brought into cultivation, and 9339 do " 
not seem susceptible of improvement ; 5234 are under wood, about 
1000 acres of which might be profitably cultivated. The average 
rent of arable land is L.l, Os. 6d. per acre. The valued rent of 
the whole is L.3664 Scots, and the actual rent, L.6273 Sterling. 
Grass for an ox or cow, during the season, on infield pasture, is L.2 ; 
for a sheep, 5s.; on outfield pasture, 17s. and 2s. respectively. 

Labour.— The average wages of full-grown male farm-servants, 
hired by the year, are L.l 2, and of full-grown female, L.5, 10s., be- 
sides their maintenance, which, for the former, is valued at L.8, 
10s., and for the latter, at L.6, 10s. The hire of boys and girls 
in agricultural families is L.6 and L,3, and their board is reckoned 



BANCIIORY-TERNAN. 35l 

at L.6. Of all these kinds of agricultural labourers and assistants, 
there are at present 156 men, 1 15 women, 100 boys, and 66 girls ; 
the hire and maintenance of whom, together with those of 240 oc- 
cupiers of the soil about one-half of whom are permanently, and 
the other occasionally, employed in tilling their own ground, will 
represent the annual average value of labour employed in agricul- 
tural production; when there are added to this L.402 for addi- 
tional work in harvest, and abo the expense of the keep and la- 
bour of 252 agricultural horses. 

Day labourers have in summer, men. Is. 8d., and in winter, 
Is. 4d. ; women, 8d. to lOd. Of these, 82 men, at a yearly ave- 
rage, are permanently employed by the land-holders alone, and 
the amount of wages paid them is about L.19I8. Artisans receive 
2s. 6d. per day in summer, and 2s. 2d. in winter. More than 
125 persons are employed in trade and handicraft. 

Cattle. — The number of oxen, or dry cattle kept at present in 
the parish, is 793; of cows, 735; and of calves or yearlings, 714. 
The oxen and cows are generally of the Aberdeenshire breed ; 
some of the Teeswater, lately introduced, are not found to answer 
so well. The number of farm-horses is 252, and of others, 23. 
There are 2108 sheep, mostly of the Highland black-faced breed, 
and 266 pigs. 

Much has been done for the improvement of cattle in this dis- 
trict by the Dee-side Agricultural Association, — a society composed 
of the proprietors and tenantry of this and eight surrounding pa- 
rishes, to the number of eighty individuals, who hold cattle shows 
at least once a-year in this place, and distribute prizes to the 
amount of L.70 annually. The disease called red- water or moor- 
ill, proves here very injurious to the farmer's stock in some seasons, 
and apparently in some localities more than in others. It occurs 
most frequently in the winter months, but is not unknown in sum- 
mer. It attacks various kinds of cattle ; but cows, towards the 
end of pregnancy, or after calving, are more liable to it than others. 
Cattle from the Highland districts are seldom seized with it, pro- 
bably from their hardy nature, and are therefore said to be darn 
bred. The discoloration of the urine and extreme constipation 
are its most prominent symptoms. Various causes are assigned 
for its occurrence. Some old people believe in the existence of 
a mysterious plant, called the darn, which gives rise to it, but 
which few of them yet profess to have seen. Most, however, agree 
in thinking that acrid, or otherwise unwholesome food, is the prin- 



352 



KINCARDINESHIRE. 



cipal cause. An intelligent veterinary surgeon of the place ass- 
cribes it chiefly to too close confinement of the cattle in winter, 
to the use of frosty water, and to some irregularities and misma- 
nagement in the supply of food. The treatment chiefly recom- 
mended is purgation. 

The production and management of dairy produce is becoming 
a matter of some attention and importance ; but the inferior qua- 
lity of the cows, the poorness of many of the pastures, and the 
want of a ready market, tend greatly to keep down its quantity 
and value. Bees do not thrive in the neighbourhood of the river, 
but in other parts they are successfully kept in considerable num- 
bers. 

Farm-houses and offices are here generally commodious and 
substantial, and daily becoming more so. They have 43 thrash- 
ing-machines belonging to them. There are 4 grain-mills in the 
parish, 4 saw-mills, 1 for turning the bobbins used in cotton ma- 
nufactories, and 1 for carding wool and for the manufacture of a 
few coarse stuffs. 

Mode of Agriculture §-c.— The seven years' shift was, some 
years ago, the rotation of cropping generally in use. Now, how- 
ever, a great proportion of the farmers practise the five years' 
shift, and some are introducing the sixth. The scythe is al- 
most universally used in reaping, and 4| returns for seed may 
be regarded as the general average. This average is greater 
than it was twenty years ago, before the adoption of recent im- 
provements, but it is still kept low by the yearly increasing culti- 
vation of new soils. The return varies from three to twelve fold 
throughout the parish. Towards the banks of the river, where 
gravel forms a large proportion of the soil, crops, though early, 
are generally light, and suffer greatly from drought. But towards 
the hills, where there is a stronger loam, they are often good, and 
sometimes tolerably heavy. Hay is frequently a deficient crop, 
but turnips and potatoes thrive well. When ram does not lall 
plentifully in June and July, the pastures present a miserable ap- 
pearance, and generally the crop fails. A moist summer is, here 
especially, the farmers' delight. The proverbial saying on this 
part of Dee-side is, that " the land requires a shower every day, 
and two on Sunday." The expense of trenching and clearing an 
acre of new land averages L.17, 10s. Some proprietors under- 
take the whole of such improvements for their tenants, charging 
them with a rent of about L.l per Scotch acre. Others trench 



13ANCH0RY-.TERNAN. 353 

the ground, fill the drains, and put up the fences, without any addi- 
tional charge of rent, and leave the tenant to do the rest. The 
leases are for nineteen years, and buildings and fences are no\V 
erected mostly at the landlord's expense, and upheld by the te- 
nant. The practice of subletting, once prevalent, is almost un- 
known. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce raised in the 
parish, according to the mean of two separate sets of returns, is 

Grain and fodder, . . L.l 1,186 0 0 

Green crops, . . . 5,730 0 0 

Hay, . . 4,107 0 0 

Pasture land, outfield and infield, . 1687 0 0 

Gardens, . . . 232 0 0 

Woods, . . 935 0 0 

Fishings, . . . 65 0 0 

Wool, . . . 132 0 0 

Dairy produce, . . 3122 0 0 



Total, . L.27,216 0 0 

To this ought still to be added the produce of the cattle, or 
the value, at birth, of calves, lambs, and pigs, &amp;c. 

Remarks. — Since 1793, the date of the former Satistical Ac- 
count, the agricultural improvements in this parish have been very 
rapid and considerable. Its rental has increased threefold, and 
the extent of its cultivated surface has been more than doubled, 
even in 1806 it was but 2378 Scotch acres, and the mode of 
conducting farming operations, which was then generally of the 
most slovenly and antiquated description, has come to embrace 
almost all the modern improvements. During the last twenty 
years especially, the landlords have expended a large capital 
in effecting important ameliorations, and done much, by their 
example and encouragement, to diffuse a spirit of improve- 
ment among their tenantry. But not a little still remains to be 
done. Besides the arable land which might yet be redeemed, 
from at least 1665 acres of waste pasture and wood of little value, 
and besides the planting of some parts of 9339 acres unfit for cul- 
tivation, a system of proper drainage is in many places greatly re- 
quired. It is believed that, were the large low marshy tract ex- 
tending through the north of the parish, bordering on the loch of. 
Drum, and comprehending the loch of Leys, the course of the 
Canny and some other rivulets, thoroughly and properly drained 
by the co-operation of the proprietors interested, it would not only 
redeem a number of acres capable of profitable cultivation, but 
greatly benefit much of the neighbouring soil already cultivated, and 

KINCARDINE, _ 2

KINCARDINESHIRE. 



improve generally the climate. Out of 246 occupiers of land, 171, 
who pay only L.20 and under of rent, and more than 100 of whom 
look to other means besides the cultivation of their possessions for 
their support, seem a large proportion of that class of tenants who 
have neither capital nor labour to bestow on the soil, and who can- 
not be expected to develope or augment its productive powers. 
Besides other evils, it subjects the landlord to a heavy expense for 
unnecessary buildings, and proves in a great many instances a pro- 
fitless and detrimental concern to the tenants themselves. The 
machinery of agricultural production might in several cases here 
do more work, and do it better at less cost ; but a change in the 
size and number of farms, and consequently in the class of occu- 
piers, obviously involves many considerable difficulties, and much 
time. It is admitted on all hands, that a rotation of cropping 
which breaks up the land frequently, is unsuitable to the soil here, 
of itself too friable and easily exhausted. It is thought, therefore, 
that the general adoption of the six year shift would be a desira- 
ble improvement ; that by this system greater returns might be 
expected with less labour and expense, and that the soil would be 
kept " in better heart." As the rearing of cattle must always form 
a prominent feature in the agriculture of the district, it seems also 
desirable that their breeding and management, together with a 
systematic care of dairy produce, should receive still farther at- 
tention and improvement, of which, it is believed, they are greatly 
susceptible. The annual average value of a cow's produce here, 
exclusive of the calf, is scarcely L.4, while in some other districts 
it is L.8 or LIO, and in the neighbourhood of Aberdeen, L.13. 

The economy and neatness of cottages are beginning to attract 
attention. It is the opinion of some practical gardeners, that orchards 
would form a profitable addition to them on this part of Dee-side. 
Several situations in the parish are admirably adapted for villas, and 
will, no doubt, be thus occupied in the course of a few years. The 
increasing accommodation required for strangers who come from a 
distance to lodge a few weeks in summer, and the dimmishing 
number of cottars in the surrounding parts of the country, will 
probably very soon increase greatly the size of the village ; but it 
is questionable whether this will prove a permanent benefit. A 
great improvement, which would tend to stimulate most others, 
would be a cheap and speedy mode of conveyance to and 
from Aberdeen. At present, the carriage of coals or lime costs 
from 2s. to 3s. per boll, and the greater part of two days are con- 
sumed in going and returning this distance of eighteen miles.

executed, it must be only as a part of a more distant and profitable 
transit. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Villages.— In the immediate vicinity of the churchyard and the 
manse a few houses, generally styled " Townhead," show the re- 
mains of the old village of Banchory, formerly, it is believed, of 
much greater extent. It is mentioned as existing in 1324, and it 
probably originated in the habitations required by the vicar or his 
curate and other assistants, who served the chapel of St Ternan 
in early Catholic times. It was the Kirktown. A broken stone 
cross, or small pillar, is seen in an area near the middle of it, and 
it appears from the register already mentioned, that the Barony 
Court of Leys was most frequently held in the place. The only 
road from Aberdeen on the north side of the Dee, forty years ago, 
passed through it, and it had then a flourishing inn. It now con- 
tains but the old manse, the two endowed schools, a farm-house 
and offices, and seven or eight labourers' cottages. 

The new or Arbeadie village was begun by three individuals in 
1805, 1807, and 1809, who took in feu successively from one of 
the proprietors in all about twenty Scotch acres, which cost them 
2s. 6d., 3s., and L.l per acre, and for which they continue to pay 
in whole L.U, 4s. 6d. The ground is now sub-feued at the rate 
of L. 12 to L.120 per acre. It has at present 50 houses, inhabit- 
ed by 72 families, and contains a Dissenting chapel, a post-office, 
a prison, two schools, three inns, and in the immediate vicinity, a 
branch of the Bank of Scotland. It is the residence of a Dissent- 
ing clergyman, of a surgeon, of a feu-proprietor, of a constable, 
of a watchmaker, of a dancing master, of a coachman, of a carrier, 
of a letter-carrier, of a road -contractor, of a baker, of 2 plasterers, 
2 gardeners, 2 schoolmistresses, 3 innkeepers, 3 shopkeepers, 3 
floaters, 3 weavers, 4 shoemakers, 4 tailors, 4 carpenters, 4 saw- 
yers, 13 labourers, and 20 servants. 

Societies. — There are six associations for various purposes in the 
parish, — the " Dee-side Agricultural Association," already men- 
tioned, with 80 members ; the " Banchory Horticultural Society," 
with 51; a lodge of " Odd Fellows," with 30; a " Rechabite 
Tent," with 25 ; an " Abstinence Society," with 200; a " Society 
for the Diff'usion of Useful Knowledge," with about the same 
number ; an " Association for the Distribution of Religious 
Tracts," with seven distributors.

Fairs. — Six annual fairs are held here, one in each of the fol- 
lowing months, — February, March, June, July, August, Decem- 
ber. That in June, St Ternan's, the most ancient, is attended by 
about 500 to 600 venders, who pay custom; the one in March, 
by 300 to 400 ; the rest by only 100 to 200. The numbers fre- 
quenting them are falling off, from other fairs having been esta- 
blished in all parts of the neighbourhood. 

Roads. — The village is distant from Aberdeen exactly eighteen 
miles, with which it communicates by a direct central road passing 
through it, and extending to Braemar. Parallel to this, and com- 
municating with it near the church by a cross road from Raemoir, 
is a turnpike running along the base of the Hill of Fare for five 
miles, and connecting the northern parts of this and the neigh- 
bouring parish of Kincardine with Aberdeen through Skene, &amp;c. 
Another turnpike leaves the village on the south, and passing 
the Dee immediately below, and shortly afterwards the Feugh, 
by the bridges already noticed, it occupies the south bank of the 
river for about a mile, and then diverges across the Grampians to 
the county town, Stonehaven, sixteen miles distant, while from the 
point of divergence a new turnpike continues along the Dee to 
Aberdeen. From the Bridge of Feugh a county road passes up the 
side of that stream for two miles, and, crossing the Grampians at 
the pass of Cairn o' Month, reaches Fettercairn, seventeen miles 
distant. A considerable transit takes place on this route during 
summer, in driving cattle from the fairs in Garioch and Buchan to 
the southern markets. A mail-coach passes through the village 
daily ; and a stage-coach during one-half of the year leaves it for 
Aberdeen every morning, and returns at night. There are also 
eight carriers who leave the parish weekly for that place, most of 
- whom generally take with them a load of timber, and bring back 
coal, lime, and other goods in return. Wood, both in rafts and 
in single pieces, are transmitted hence by the Dee in every fa- 
vourable state of the flood ; and large quantities are seen passing 
this from the upper districts. 

The Church is conveniently situated for the majority of the pa- 
rishioners. A few families, however, at the extreme limits, are 
nearly five miles distant from it. It affords accommodation for 
about 1300 persons. It has no free unappropriated sittings. Se- 
veral of the heritors have more of the area allotted to them than 
\&amp; required for their own tenantry; but it is fully occupied by the 



BANCHOllY-TERNAN 35T 

surplus tenantry of others, and by the inhabitants of the village, 
for whose accommodation it has hitherto been let. The present 
manse was built in 1798. It received a small addition about 1803, 
and twelve jears ago still farther additions and repairs. The 
ffkhe wants more than a fourth of an acre of its legal size, and is 
of the ordinary value of the fields in its neighbourhood, — L.2 per 
acre. In 1835, the Court of Teinds modified the stipend at 136 
bolls of meal, and the same number of barley; but the teinds of 
the parish were found to be exhausted by 126 bolls of each. 

There is here a chapel of Independents, or Congregational 
Dissenters, attended by about nine families within, and five with- 
out the parish, and having in all fifteen to twenty communicants, 
who on ordinary occasions constitute nearly the whole congrega- 
tion. Five families belong to the Episcopalian, one to the Ro- 
man Catholic, and one to the United Secession Church. Divine 
service in the parish church is remarkably well attended in the 
forenoon. The number of communicants averages 1000. The 
annual amount of collections for missionary and educational pur- 
poses is about L.12, and nearly as much is collected for the Aber- 
deen Infirmary and other charities. A strong movement took 
place in this parish about three years ago in favour of temperance, 
which led to the formation of two associations, the Total Absti- 
nence Society, and the Rechabite Tent. There can be little 
doubt that these societies have, on the whole, exerted here a be- 
neficial effect on formerly existing opinions and practices respecting 
the use of liquors, and have spread their salutary influence into 
some of the surrounding districts. The association for the dis- 
tribution of religious tracts circulates 400 monthly. 

Education. — The total number of permanent schools is 10. Of 
these 3 are parochial, 2 are endowed, 1 supported partly by sub- 
scriptions, and the others depend entirely on their teachers' own 
exertions. The three parochial schoolmasters, besides their fees, 
have the maximum salary of L.5], 6s. 6|d. divided among them, 
with houses, and gardens, &amp;c. rent-free. One of them, who is 
also teacher of the boys' school endowed by Sir Thomas Burnett 
and Dr Reid, receives thereby in addition L.16. The fund mor- 
tified by the same individuals for the maintenance of a girls' school 
yields the schoolmistress about L.4, 10s. a-year. Another girls' 
school, lately established in the new village, has hitherto been 
supported by subscriptions to the extent of L.18 a year ; but it is 
understood that, after two years, all support additional to the 



358 KINCARUINESHIIIE. 



school-fees is to cease. The whole amount of fees paid within 
the parish is about L.175; and the total expense of education 
L.310. In all these schools, instructions are given in reading, 
writing, arithmetic, geography, and history. In one of the girls' 
schools, French and music; and in the three parochial, Latin, 
geometry, and land-surveying, are also occasionally taught. A 
careful and regular system of teaching is practised in nearly all 
of them ; and the method of mutual instruction, by question and 
answer among the pupils themselves, has been very extensively 
and very successfully applied to almost every subject of their edu- 
cation. The number of schools ten years ago was four, and of 
scholars attending them about 150. At the presbyterial exami- 
nations on 1st March 1842, 395, or more than one-sixth of fl| 
the population, were present in all the day-schools, while up- | 
■wards of 400 children were, at the same period, attending six 
Sunday schools, constantly taught in the parish throughout the 
vear. These numbers, however, decrease during summer to 
nearly one-half. Parents here are very generally alive to the be- 
nefits of education for their children, and a decided change for 
the better has taken place, especially among the young, since the 
facilities of education were increased, and its quality improved. 
In truth, a very considerable desire for general information exists 
even among adults, to satisfy which an association was formed two 
years ago for the dissemination of useful knowledge, and lectures 
on scientific subjects were delivered here and in other places, 
which met with great success, and were listened to with deep in- 
terest. An attempt has also been lately made to cultivate a more 
general taste for music by the formation of an instrumental band. 
This promises to be useful, both in raising the pleasures of some, 
and in rendering others capable of still higher pursuits. A paro- 
chial library has existed for many years, and consists of upwards 
of 400 volumes, chiefly on religious and historical subjects. 

The Poors Funds consist, \st, of the collections made in the 
parish church the average annual amount of which, exclusive of 
those allotted for other purposes, has been for the last three years 
L.lOO; 2d, of the Leys mortification, yielding annually L.15, 
15s.; 3d, of the interest of L.lOO mortified by Dr Alexander 
Reid, physician to Charles L; of L.lOO by Mr Alexander Shanks 
of Castlerigg, a Son of one of the ministers ; of L.50 by Dr George 
Reid of London ; and of L.50 by Mrs Aberdeen of Glassel ; and, 
Ath, of occasional donations, mortcloth dues, and some accumu- 



BANCHORY-TERNAN.

lated savings. The whole produces an ainnial average revenue 
of L.201, 1 8s. 

The average number of poor from 1700 to 1709 inclusive was 
68. The average sum given to each yearly was L.2, 10s. Scots, 
or 4s. 2d. Sterling. The population, as already noticed, was then 
about 2077. In 1793, the poor were 80 in number, while the 
whole population was but 1340, and the whole annual amount of 
collections L.19, 10s., and the interest of mortifications L,32, 10s,, 
affording an average allowance to each pauper of 13s. The num- 
ber of poor now on the roll has averaged, since 1838, 65, and the 
total number relieved annually has been 85. The allowance to 
each in 1840, exclusive of lunatics, was L.l, 13s. 

The disposition to refrain from seeking parochial relief in re- 
duced circumstances among persons here, who have belonged to 
the class of day-labourers or small farmers, is by no means great, 
although occasional instances of it do occur. The tendency among 
those just able to support themselves, to leave their poor relations 
to the assistance of the parish, is rather on the increase. But 
much charity is given in private, not only by the rich, but by the 
middle and even the poorer classes themselves. Were it other- 
wise, paupers could not subsist on the pittance which they now 
receive from the parochial funds. Their diet generally consists 
of oatmeal and a. little tea and sugar, which costs them nearly 
Is. 8d. per week, to which they have to add Id. for soap. In or- 
der to raise this sum of 3d. per day, female paupers, in ordinary 
health, besides their allowance of Id. from the kirk funds, have 
recourse to knitting, which is distributed to them monthly by an 
agent of one of the woollen manufacturers in Aberdeen. But the 
utmost that they can make at such work is only another Id. per 
day. Private charity, therefore, must either make up to them 
the value of the remainder, or they must renounce their tea and 
sugar, and live chiefly on oatmeal, which many of them actually 
do. They are, besides, entirely indebted, in a great many in- 
stances, to private benevolence, for clothing, winter fuel, and 
house rent, and for attendance and medicine when sick. Many 
praiseworthy acts of disinterested kindness are performed for them 
on such occasions, by their almost equally poor neighbours, and 
that often at the sacrifice of not a little personal comfort and ease 
Male paupers, unable for field labour, have here no resources in 
in-door work ; but they form only one-fifth of the whole number 
and are all members of families who contribute to their support.'

<head>COUNTY OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q376914">KINCARDINE</name>.</head> 
<p>


This County is situate betwixt 56°.43' and 57°.5' north lati- 
tude ; and betwixt 1°.47' and 2°.30' west longitude. It is 
bounded on the north, by Aberdeenshire ; on the south and west, 
by Forfarshire ; and on the east, by the German Ocean. It is 
32 miles in length from north to south, and 24 in breadth. It 
contains about 360 square miles. 

The surface of the County, to the extent of about two-thirds, or 
about 100,000 acres, is level and cultivated. The other third is 
a very elevated and sterile region, consisting of the eastern range 
of the Grampians. 

This County sends one Member to Parliament. The constitu- 
ency in 1841 amounted to 897,— the population being 33,052. 
The annual value of real property, as assessed in 1815, was 
L. 94,861.
