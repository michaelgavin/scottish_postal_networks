PRESBYTERY OF JEDBURGH, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVJOTDALE. 

THE REV. JOHN PURVES, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name of this parish appears to have been at a for- 
mer period indiscriminately written, Gedworde, Jedworth, Jedwood, 
and Jedburgh. The name of the river, which is the only essential 
part of these compounds, being anciently written Ged, and per- 
haps Gad, has given rise to the probable conjecture, that this was 
the principal seat of the Gadeni, a tribe who inhabited the district 
between the river Tiviot and Northumberland. 

Extent, Sfc. — The parish consists of two detached portions, which 
are in figure exceedingly irregular. The first or lower division, in 
which is situate the town of Jedburgh in Long. 10 / 10" W. in time, 
and Lat. 55° 28' 45" N. is in some places seven miles long and five 
broad ; and the second, or higher division, is five miles long and four 
broad. The whole parish contains 38 square miles. It is bounded 
by the parishes of Ancrum and Crailing on the north; by Oxnam and 
Eckford on the east ; by Bedrule and Southdean on the west ; and 
by the county of Northumberland on the south. It is intersected 
by Oxnam and Southdean. 

Topographical Appearances. — The surface is greatly diversified, 
presenting an agreeable variety of hills and valleys. Through its 
centre runs the deep sinuous valley of the Jed ; whilst the higher 
ground on either side, indented by numerous ravines, rises by an 
undulating ascent to the height of nearly 300 feet above the level 
of the river. The highest hill in the neighbourhood of Jedburgh 
is the Dunian, which is 1120 feet above the level of the sea; but 
its summit is in the parish of Bedrule. In the higher part of the 
parish, there are several beautiful green hills of a conical form, two 
of which are upwards of 1 100 feet above the sea ; but, being situate 
near the Carter Fell, a mountain of the Cheviot range, the height 
of which is 2020 feet, their elevation is not conspicuous. 

Climate. — The climate varies considerably. In Jedburgh and

the valley, which are sheltered by the banks of the river, it is mild 
and temperate ; whilst in the higher and more exposed parts it is 
colder. The mean temperature is 47° of Fahrenheit, The mean 
pressure of the atmosphere is 29.3 inches. The greatest extremes 
during the last twenty years were 1821, December 25, 27.85 
inches, and 1825, January 9, 30.55 inches. The town of Jed- 
burgh is remarkably healthy, being subject to fewer epidemical 
diseases than either of the neighbouring towns of Kelso and Hawick. 
Cholera, which, in the year 1832, visited both these places, never 
entered this parish, although it twice approached its very bounda- 
ries. As might be expected from the salubrity of the climate, there 
are numerous instances of longevity. At present, five or six per- 
sons are above ninety, and one has completed his hundredth year. 
At a Reform dinner which took place in 1832, the united ages of 
three women, including the chairwoman, amounted to 264. She 
occupied a chair which was made in the year 1674, and on which 
the Pretender had sat when he passed through Jedburgh in 1745, 
and her gown had seen 100 summers. 

Hydrography. — This parish possesses abundance of excellent pe- 
rennial springs, with a mean temperature of 47° Fahrenheit. At 
Tudhope, about half a mile from Jedburgh, there is a spring strongly 
impregnated with sulphur and iron, which has long been resorted 
to for the cure of scorbutic disorders. There are several chalybeate 
springs, in various parts of the parish, and at Gilliestongues there 
is a petrifying spring. 

The Jed, which flows through nearly the whole length of the 
parish, rises on the north side of the Carlin Tooth, one of the 
Cheviot mountains, in the parish of Southdean, at the distance of 
about fourteen miles from Jedburgh, and joins the Tiviot about two 
and a half miles below the town. It receives many tributary 
streamlets ; and rushing over a rocky channel, betwixt woody 
banks and lofty scars, fringed with shrubs, and crowned with the 
oak, the beech, and the weeping birch, presents in its course a suc- 
cession of highly picturesque and romantic scenes. Its general di- 
rection is from south to north. Its waters are pure and salubrious. 
Its breadth is about twenty yards ; and, having a fall of thirty feet 
per mile, its velocity is considerable. The eastern part of the pa- 
rish is watered by the Oxnam, and through the north of it flows 
the Tiviot, winding beautifully through its wide and fertile vale. 
Geology and Mineralogy. — The nature and position of the rocks 

afford abundant materials for the speculations of the geologist. At

a quarter of a mile to the south of Jedburgh is the remarkable 
precipice of which Dr Hutton has given a drawing in his Theory 
of the Earth. There, both the primary and secondary formations 
are seen at one view. The strata of the primary rocks are vertical, 
and in many places their irregularity seems to indicate the effects 
of some great convulsion. These strata, at their junction with 
the secondary formation, are interspersed with thin layers of lime- 
stone. The strata of the secondary formation are horizontal, con- 
sisting of red freestone dent, alternating with soft sandstone of 
the same colour. This latter stratification is beautifully exempli- 
fied in the lofty precipitous banks of the Jed, throughout the lower 
part of its course. With the red are frequently combined thin 
strata of a pale yellow and of a bluish-gray. The strata are in ge- 
neral exceedingly regular, but there is no uniform dip. In some 
places there are remarkable breaks, as at Sunnybrae, where the 
general direction of the strata is suddenly interrupted, and they 
fall down in a direction nearly opposite ; and at Hundalee Mill, 
where they are curiously broken and bent into curves. At Kers- 
heugh the Jed is crossed by a dike of primary rocks, through which 
it appears to have forced its way with difficulty. A similar dike 
occurs at Roughly-nook Hill, and runs in an easterly direction up 
Edgerston Rigg. Above the red there is abundance of excellent 
white sandstone, which may be found in all the more elevated si- 
tuations throughout the parish. Some of the hills, however, con- 
sist of whin reposing on the sandstone. At the Carter Fell, which 
forms the southern boundary of the parish, there is great plenty of 
excellent limestone ; and at Hunthill, about two miles from Jed- 
burgh, there are six strata ranged at different distances above each 
other, the thickest of which is nine inches. A temporary kiln 
was erected there about sixty years ago, but was soon abandoned 
on account of the expense of coal. In the glen near Hunthill 
House there are considerable appearances of coal formation ; and 
at a short distance from this, various trials had been made for coal, 
as appears from the council-records of Jedburgh, so early as the 
year 1660. In the year 1798 a bore was sunk, nine feet distant 
from an old pit, at the expense of the county of Roxburgh, to the 
depth of forty-five fathoms. At the depth of thirty-five fathoms, 
a hard bluish-gray freestone had just been pierced through, when 
the rods suddenly sunk four feet without any pressure. This ap- 
peared to some to confirm the current belief, that coals had been 
formerly found there ; and they explained the sudden descent of 



A 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



the rods on the supposition, that they had already been extracted 
in that direction. When forty-five fathoms had been reached 
without success, the directors ordered the old pit to be opened ; 
and when the workmen had proceeded to the depth of eight fathoms, 
they found the remains of a horse gin with an axle of oak, the iron 
part of which was much worn. They were unable to descend far- 
ther without machinery to draw off the water, and the funds being 
exhausted, the undertaking was relinquished. In digging amongst 
the rubbish thrown out of the old pit, a hard gray stone was found, 
with a piece of well-formed coal attached to one of its sides. 

The only ore hitherto found in the parish is that of iron, which 
occurs in a bed of about three feet thickness, at a short distance 
from Jedburgh, near the precipice already mentioned. It lies be- 
twixt the primitive and secondary formations. A quantity of vitri- 
fied matter was lately dug up on Howdean Moor, resembling what 
is found at vitrified forts. It was comprised, however, within the 
space of six feet. The soil did not appear to have been exposed 
to the- action of fire. In draining bogs at Scarsburgh and Hunt- 
hill, hazelnuts, together with a few remnants of black oak, were 
found at the depth of ten feet. Oak-trees of great dimensions are 
occasionally found in the alluvial soil at the side of the Tiviot. 

As might be expected from the extent of the parish, and the 
inequality of the surface, the soil is various, consisting of clay, of 
a mixture of clay and sand or gravel in various proportions, and in 
the neighbourhood of Jedburgh chiefly of loam. 

Zoology.— The squirrel is found in the parish. The horned-owl, 
the fern-owl, and the kingsfisher, are frequently found on the 
banks of the Jed ; and in the more elevated parts of the parish, 
the plover, the dotterel, and fieldfare, are common. The starling, 
which for many years had disappeared, has again returned, and be- 
come common. The following are a few of the rare insects : — 
Bembidium impressum, Tetratoma fungorum, Nitidula punctatis- 
sima, N. grisea, Telephones cyaneus, Ptinus imperialis, Rhynchites 
cylindricus, Sphaeriestes immaculatus, Lophyrus pini, Hipparchia 
blandina, Sphinx ligustri, Chironomus elegans, and Sargns Reau- 
muri.  

Botany.— The botany of this parish has not yet been sufficient- 
ly investigated. The whole extent of it was anciently covered with 
natural wood, and was known by the name of Jed Forest, which 
also included Southdean and part of the neighbouring parishes.

JEDBURGH.

The remains of the ancient forest, amounting to many hundred 
acres, were rapaciously cut down during the last century ; but the 
trees which have sprung from the old stocks, together with the 
plantations which have since reached maturity, still render this a 
well-wooded district. A few patches of the ancient forest may still 
be seen in the neighbourhood of Fernihirst, consisting chiefly of 
birch. In lower situations every species of forest trees grow luxu- 
riantly ; and in higher, Scotch fir and larch are most common. 
The Scotch fir at Stewartfield has attained a great age and size, 
and is much esteemed in carpentry, being thought little inferior to 
American fir. The ancient forest still possesses two venerable re- 
presentatives in the " King of the Wood," and the " Capon-tree," 
oaks situate near the Newcastle road, at the distance of one mile 
from Jedburgh. The " King of the Wood," towering above the 
surrounding trees, rises to the height of 99 feet, the circumference 
of its trunk, at three feet from the ground, being 14 feet. The 
" Capon-tree," which stands alone in a haugh opposite Hundalee 
Mill, has a more aged and gnarled appearance than the monarch, 
and, dividing into a multiplicity of boughs, is much admired for 
the fantastic twisting of its wide-spreading branches. The circum- 
ference of its trunk at three feet from the ground is 21 feet. 

The soil and situation of Jedburgh are peculiarly congenial to 
the growth of fruit trees, and of this the intelligent ecclesiastics 
who inhabited the monastery appear to have taken due advantage, 
as many pear-trees still exist, which, from their size and the slow 
progress of their growth, are thought to be at least three hundred 
years old. The oldest are of the following kinds : the Longueville, 
the summer Bon Chretien, the Ludd, the autumn Bergamot, the 
Pound pear, the Red honey, the White Warden, the Gray Warden, 
and the Gray Good-wife. Of a great age, but not quite so old as 
these, are the Gray Auchan, the Red Auchan, the Worry Carl, the 
Buchanan, the Drummond, the Golden Knop, the Lamias, and the 
Pitfirran. One of the largest of the red honey pear trees has been 
known to produce in one season sixty imperial bushels. Of the 
Longueville, there is a fine specimen in Friars gardens, which, 
though much decayed through age, continues to produce excellent 
crops. In the « Lady's Yards," or convent garden, a very old 
white warden pear-tree was blown down, which measured eight feet 
in circumference near the ground. In the orchard adjoining the 
house which was inhabited by Queen Mary during her illness at 
Jedburgh, there is a group of trees of the same kind, said by tra-

dition to have been branches of a large tree which was blown down 
by a tempest on the night when King James VI. crossed the bor- 
der to take possession of his English dominions. The tree being 
allowed to lie on its" side, and buried in the earth, the branches 
became each a separate tree. Two of the oldest of the gray war- 
den pear-trees have been known to bear in one season, the one 
53 imperial bushels, and the other 56. The pears which are most 
esteemed, and to which Jedburgh is chiefly indebted for its cele- 
brity for fruit, are the Longueville, the summer Bon Chretien, the 
autumn Bergamot, theLudd, the red and the gray Auchan. The 
old apple-trees are much inferior to those cultivated in modern 
times. The soil is a rich black loam, and this, combined with the 
delightful sheltered situation, enables gardeners to succeed in rear- 
ing delicate trees, which scarcely grow in other parts of the coun- 
try. As a proof of this, it may be mentioned, that Coe's imperial 
plum succeeds admirably as a standard, and produces fruit equal 
in quality to what grows on walls in gardens two miles distant from 
Jedburgh. In the garden of Mr Deans, the miller grape has se- 
veral times ripened in the open air without any species of covering. 

II. — Civil History. 

Historical Notices. — The two Jedworths are the most ancient 
parochial divisions in Scotland. Various notices of their history 
are to be found in books devoted to ecclesiastical antiquities, and 
the annals of border warfare. The magnificence of its ecclesias- 
tical establishments, the fastnesses of its forest, which was fre- 
quently the rendezvous of armies, — its castles, and the number of 
its fortified houses, rendered this parish at a former period of much 
more consequence than it has been since the Reformation and the 
union. From its proximity to the border, it was the continual 
scene of war and of lawless violence, from the time when Donald V. 
here defeated the confederate princes of Northumberland and 
Cumberland, to the year 1575, when the " Raid of the Reid Swire," 
which took place on its southern boundary, terminated the hostile 
feuds between the two kingdoms. Since these troublous times, 
few events have occurred worthy of being recorded. The alarm 
produced by the arrival of the Pretender with his Highlanders in 
1745, is still remembered by a very few of the oldest inhabitants. 
The denomination of dissenters termed Relief originated here un- 
der Mr Boston in the year 1754. 

Historical Documents. — A curious manuscript account of the va- 
rious proceedings relative to the origin of the Relief, drawn up by the 



JEDBURGH. 



7 



kirk-session at that period, is in the possession of Mr Renwick, 
bookseller, Jedburgh. The only other documents illustrative of 
the history of the parish, are the charters and council-records of the 
borough of Jedburgh. The ancient charters all perished during 
the English wars, the town having been frequently reduced to ashes. 
They were all, however, renewed and confirmed by Queen Mary 
in the year 1556, when the magistrates were invested with the 
power of apprehending and committing criminals, of putting them 
to the knowledge of an assize, and of administering justice even 
unto death. Another charter was granted by King James VI. in 
the year 1569, conferring upon the provost, magistrates, and com- 
munity, all the property and revenues within the parish belonging 
to the Abbey of Jedburgh, for the purpose of erecting hospitals, 
supporting the poor and infirm, and for other pious uses. This 
charter was ratified in Parliament, December 19, 1597, but no in- 
feftment appears to have been taken upon it, and there is no trace 
of any particular subject having been taken possession of under it. 
Another charter was granted by King Charles II. in the year 1641. 
The council-records have been preserved only from the year 1619. 

Eminent Characters. — A considerable number of eminent cha- 
racters have been connected with this parish at various periods of its 
history. St Kennock, who is said, by his effectual intercessions, 
to have preserved peace between the two kingdoms for the space 
of ten years, was Abbot of Jedburgh in the year 1000. To him 
succeeded a long line of abbots, many of whom, from being em- 
ployed in embassies, and other important political transactions, ap- 
pear to have been men of distinguished learning and prudence. — 
Sir William Stewart of Jedworth, who was taken prisoner with his 
relative Douglas at Homildon, and, by the lawless orders of Hot- 
spur, drawn and quartered, was remarkable both as a warrior and 
as a statesman, being honoured with the confidence of his sovereign, 
and frequently employed to represent the interests of his country. — 
In the Convent of Carmelites, which was founded by the inhabit- 
ants of Jedburgh, lived and died Adam Bell, author of Rota Tem- 
pomm, a history of Scotland from the earliest times to the year 
1535. — At a period somewhat later, Jedburgh had the honour of 
giving birth to John Rutherford, Principal of St Salvator's College, 
St Andrews, author of a book on the art of reasoning. — The ce- 
lebrated Samuel Rutherford, f Principal of St Mary's College, St 
Andrews, was born in the adjoining parish of Nisbet, now annexed 

• Vide M'Crie's Life of Melville. f Vide Murray's Life of Rutherford.

to Crailing, and is generally thought to have received his education 
at the grammar-school of Jedburgh.— Andrew Young, Regent of 
Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh, under whom Ruther- 
ford studied, was born of poor parents near Jedburgh. — Andrew 
Rutherford, master of the grammar-school of Jedburgh, was pro- 
moted to the rectorship of the High School of Edinburgh in 1669. — 
Here Gabriel Semple found a resting-place after the many troubles 
which he sustained during the Episcopal persecution.— At the 
grammar-school of Jedburgh, the poet Thomson, whose father was 
minister of Southdean, received the rudiments of his education. — 
This parish enjoyed for three years the ministrations of the cele- 
brated Dr Macknight ; and the long incumbency of the venerable 
Dr Somerville, historian of Queen Anne, &amp;c. who had attained the 
ninetieth year of his age, and the sixty-third of his ministry, ter- 
minated in the year 1830. He was admitted minister of Jedburgh 
in 1773, and when he died, was father of the Church of Scotland.— 
Jedburgh was the native place, and long the residence of the dis- 
tinguished land-surveyor John Ainslie ; and it has had the honour 
of giving birth to one of the most illustrious of living philosophers, 
Sir David Brewster. 

Chief Land-owners. — The chief land-owners are the Marquis of 
Lothian, Mr Rutherfurd of Edgerston, Mr Miller of Stewartfield, 
the Earl of Minto, Mr Jerdon of Bonjedward, Mr Ormiston of 
Glenburnhall, Mr Fair of Langlee, &amp;c. 

Parochial Registers. — The date of the earliest entry in the pa- 
rochial registers is February 14, 1639. They are not voluminous, 
and it is to be regretted that they have been somewhat carelessly 
kept. 

Antiquities. — At Old Jedworth, about four miles above the pre- 
sent town, are the ruins of a chapel which was founded by Ecgred, 
bishop of Lindisfarn, who died a. d. 845. It is situate amidst a 
clump of trees, in a level field at the side of the river. Its walls 
have crumbled into mounds, and the tombstones in its church-yard 
are scarcely visible above the grass. Interesting as is this sacred 
spot, it has attracted little attention in comparison of the more pro- 
minent and magnificent remains of the abbey of Jedburgh. This 
venerable structure stands on the south side of the town, on the 
declining bank of the river, which winds past it in front, washing 
some remnants of its outworks. The chapter-house, cloisters, and 
other appendages have perished, and nothing remains but the 
church, which, in the form of a cross, extends from east to west

230 feet. The choir is much dilapidated, bearing marks of great 
antiquity. The two lower stories consist of massive pillars and se- 
micircular arches, with the diagonal or zigzag mouldings of Saxon 
architecture, whilst the upper windows, and some other parts are 
Gothic, evidently added at a more recent period. The north 
transept is entire, presenting traceried Gothic windows, especially 
one of great size and beauty. The south transept has disappeared. 
Above the intersection of the transepts with the nave and choir, a 
large square tower rises on four pillars to the height of 100 feet, 
surmounted by a projecting battlement, and crowned with turrets 
and pinnacles. The nave, measuring 130 feet long, presents on 
each side three tiers of arches ; the first, opening into the aisle, 
consists of pointed arches deeply recessed, and richly moulded, 
supported by clustered columns with sculptured capitals ; the se- 
cond, which opened into the galleries, consists of beautifully mould- 
ed semicircular arches, with two pointed arches inserted in each ; 
and the third of elegant pointed windows. The lofty western gable 
possesses a Norman door of uncommon beauty, the archway exhi- 
biting a profusion of ornamented mouldings, supported by slender 
pillars to the depth of 1\ feet. Above it is a large window with 
a semicircular arch, flanked by small blank pointed arches on long 
slender shafts, and this is surmounted by a beautiful St Catherine's 
wheel. On the south side of the choir there is a chapel, which 
was once appropriated to the use of - the grammar-school, and in 
which the poet Thomson received his education. But the chief 
object of architectural interest in this abbey is the Norman door, 
which formed the southern entrance to the church from the clois- 
ters. This, for the elegance of its workmanship, and the symmetry 
of its proportions, is unrivalled in Scotland. Its sculptured mould- 
ings springing from slender shafts, with capitals richly wreathed, 
exhibit the representations of flowers, men, and various animals, 
executed with surprising minuteness and delicacy. 

" This venerable pile," says the late Archibald Elliot, architect, 
in his report to the heritors respecting some of its projected re- 
pairs, " in my opinion, is the most perfect and beautiful example 
of the Saxon and early Gothic in Scotland." Its grand appear- 
ance is imposing, and admirably accords with the scenery of the 
romantic valley in which it is situate. There is a discrepance in 
the accounts of historians relative to the time of its foundation as 
an abbey. Some refer it to a. d. 11 18, and others to a. d. 1147. 
The probability is, considering the antique remains of the choir, 
and that St Kennoch is said to have been Abbot of Jedburgh so

early as the year 1000, that it was an abbey prior to the time of 
David L, and, instead of being founded, that it was rebuilt and en- 
larged by that munificent monarch. It frequently suffered during 
the English wars, particularly by the invasions of Edward I It 
was burned and pillaged by the Earl of Surrey at the storming of 
Jedburgh m the year 1523, and it was subsequently reduced to a 
state of dilapidation by the Earl of Hertford in 1545. Its walls 
still exhibit the traces of the flames, as they had burst through its 
arches. Considerable portions of it, including two beautiful doors 
and several aisles, were demolishedin more recent times by the direc- 
tion of persons of whom the reverse might have, been expected; but a 
better taste now prevails, and it lately underwent some practical 
repairs. The substructions of its buildings have been occasional- 
ly found at a great distance from the remaining fabric. The burial- 
ground attached to it was very extensive. In constructing the 
present road, which passes through its ancient limits, two tiers of 
coffins were removed, formed of stone slabs. 

Of the Convent of Carmelites, and of the Maison Dieu, no 
traces remain, but the names of various places in the town still in- 
dicate the prevalence of ecclesiastical institutions. The chapel of 
Scarsburgh and the church of Upper Crailing an ancient parish 
now attached to this have likewise disappeared. 

This parish possessed two castles, Jedburgh and Fernihirst. 
The name of Jedburgh Castle appears in the earliest Scottish re- 
cords, but it does not appear by whom it was founded. It was a 
royal residence, and for ages continued a place of great strength, 
the object of eager dispute to the contending kingdoms. It was 
the favourite abode of the amiable Malcolm IV., who died there 
A. d. 1165. It was frequently honoured with the presence of 
William the Lion, and of Alexander II. To Alexander III. was 
born in Jedburgh Castle a son, a. d. 1263, who was named Alex- 
ander ; and this, the same sovereign, after he had lost all his child- 
ren, thought a fitting scene for the unusual pomp which attended 
his marriage with Jolande, daughter of the Count de Dreux. It 
was in the possession of the English from the battle of Durham 
till the year 1409, when it was taken by the Scots and demolish- 
ed with great labour and at great expense, as is evident from the 
proposal which was made to defray it by a tax of two pennies up- 
on every hearth in Scotland. A small portion of its remaining 
walls was removed a few years ago, and on levelling its site for the 
erection of the present structure, charred beams of oak were found 
mixed with rubbish of stone and lime. A few coins were also

found, together with a number of globular stones, from seven inches 
to one foot in diameter, which appear to have been the cope stones 
of its turrets. 

Fernihirst was the stronghold of the ancestors of the Marquis of 
Lothian, and is situate on the eastern bank of the Jed, nearly two 
miles above Jedburgh. It was taken by Surrey in 1523, and re- 
covered by the Scots with the assistance of the French auxiliaries 
then stationed at Jedburgh, after a desperate conflict, in 1549. 
Here the Earl of Westmoreland took refuge from the vengeance 
of Elizabeth in 1569. In the following year the castle was taken 
and demolished by the Earl of Sussex and Sir John Foster, in con- 
sequence of an incursion which Ker  had made with other border 
chiefs into the north of England. It was rebuilt in the year 1598, 
and its gray turrets are still seen peering above the tall venerable 
trees which surround it. 

Besides these fortresses, the parish was thickly studded with 
towers and peels. Those at Hundalee and Hunthill, ancient seats 
of the Rutherfurds, and at Bonjedward, a seat of the Douglases, 
were places of great strength, but they were, along with many 
others, destroyed during the last century. A tower still remains 
at Lanton, and the ruins of Timpandean, at a short distance from 
it, still remind us of warlike times. Of the six towers by which 
Jedburgh was defended after the destruction of the castle, there 
are no remains. A tower used as the gaol, which stood in the 
centre of the street not far from the cross, was removed during the 
last century, as also the ruins of Abbot's Tower, the site of which 
is now occupied by the Dispensary. The house which was inha- 
bited by Queen Mary during her illness at Jedburgh is still entire. 
It is a large building with small windows, and walls of great thick- 
ness. A broad stone stair ascends to the second story, and a 
narrow winding stair leads to the third, and the apartment of Queen 
Mary, which is a small room with two windows. Some of the an- 
cient tapestry which adorned it is still preserved. This is styled 
in the Privy- Council Record " the house of the Lord Composi- 
tor." It was purchased by the late Dr Lindsay from the family 
of Scott of Ancrum. One of Claverhouse's pistols, presented by 
him to an ancestor of Dr Lindsay's, was formerly suspended in 
the dining-room, but this is now at Abbotsford. 

Traces of ancient camps exist at Howdean, Swinnie, Fernihirst, 

 Ker of Fernihirst, along with Ker of Cessford, Scott of Buccleuch, and several 
others, received the honour of knighthood from the Regent Arran, when David 
Panter, in presence of a great assemhlagc of nohility, was consecrated Bishop of 
Ross at Jedburgh in the year 1552 — Vide Lesly, Book x.

and Camptown, but it is to be regretted that proprietors have not 
exerted themselves to preserve them from the ravages of the farm- 
er. At Scarsburgh there is a fine circular camp in good preser- 
vation, about 60 yards in diameter and with ramparts nearly 20 
feet high. There is a Roman Camp near Monklaw, which appears 
to have been about 160 yards square. The neighbouring moor is 
said by tradition to have been the scene of a battle. But the most 
interesting of these ancient remains is the celebrated camp at Linta- 
lee, described in Barbour's Bruce, which was formed by Douglas 
for the defence of the borders during the absence of Bruce in Ire- 
land. In the neighbourhood of this camp, Richmond, the English 
warden, fell in a personal encounter with Douglas, having invad- 
ed Scotland with 10,000 men, whom he had provided with hatchets 
to level Jed forest with the ground. This strong position is form- 
ed by the steep and precipitous bank of the Jed and a deep ravine, 
and was defended on the side towards the rising ground by a double 
rampart, which still remains. 

At Hundalee, Lintalee, and Mossburnford, there are caves dug 
out of the rock in the banks of the Jed, which in former times 
were used for concealing property and as places of refuge. That 
at Lintalee is in the face of the precipice below the camp, and is 
now inaccessible. The Hundalee cave consists of three apart- 
ments, a large one with a smaller on each side. 

The Roman road passes through the north of the parish, at the 
distance of two miles from Jedburgh. It is here in a state of pre- 
servation, being paved with whinstones. It crosses the Jed and 
the Tiviot, about half a-mile above their junction. Another ancient 
road passes over the height from Ancrum Bridge towards Jedburgh. 
At the foot of the Canongate of Jedburgh there is a bridge of 
great antiquity, consisting of three semicircular ribbed arches. It 
is neatly built with squared stones, and on its centre there was 
formerly a gateway, which, like the ancient cross of Jedburgh, and 
many other interesting relics of past ages, disappeared before the 
encroachments of the last century. At the end of the New Bridge, 
next Bongate, there is a large stone which appears to have formed 
part of an ancient obelisk. It is covered with indistinct characters 
and representations of animals, and on the top there is a tenon for 
receiving the mortise of the incumbent stone. It is probably part 
of the ancient Cross of Bongate. 

Great numbers of ancient coins have been, on many occasions, 
found in different parts of the parish, but, being dispersed in a 
great number of hands, it is not easy to obtain a satisfactory ao

count either of their •umbers, or of the reigns to which they be- 
longed. In the year 1827, upwards of ninety Saxon silver coins 
were dug up in a field at Bongate, belonging to three different 
reigns, but chiefly to Ethelred, together with a ring curiously form- 
ed of silver twine. One of them belonged to the reign of Canute. 
Several of these coins are now in the possession of Mr Bainbridge 
of Gattonside. Many coins have been found at the side of the 
Jed, near the Abbey Bridge, where rubbish from the Abbey and 
other parts of the tow»n had been deposited. These, as far as we 
have been able to ascertain, belonged chiefly to the reigns of Edred, 
Edwy, Ethelred, Edward I., Edward III., Henry I., and Henry III. 
Some Roman coins are said to have been found at Stewartfield. 
About twelve years ago, a horn was found near Swinnie, contain- 
ing silver coins of James I. of Scotland ; and in the spring of the 
present year, between 300 and 400 silver coins were ploughed up 
in a field in front of the farm-house, of the reigns of Henry VIII., 
James V., and Queen Mary. A silver coin, or medal, was lately 
found at Leukhall, near Jedburgh, which had been struck on oc- 
casion of the marriage of Queen Mary with the Dauphin. On 
the one side are the letters F and M combined in one, surmount- 
ed by a crown, and surrounded by the inscription, fecit, vtraoe. 
vnvm. 1558. On the other side are the combined arms of Scot- 
land and the Dauphin, with the inscription fran. et. ma. d. g. it. h. 
scotor. d. d. vien. This interesting piece, which is about the size 
of a half crown, is in the possession of the Hon. General Leslie, 
Jedbank. 

A camp-kettle was found at Edgerston about ten years ago, and 
was presented by Mr Rutherfurd to Sir Walter Scott. Flint ar- 
row-heads are occasionally found in the parish, particularly on 
Howdean moor, which tradition represents as a field of battle. 
About the year 1815, a stone sarcophagus was discovered in a gar- 
den adjoining the west side of the- High Street of Jedburgh, be- 
longing to John Selkirk, upholsterer. It was composed of large 
unhewn slabs of stone ; being 4 feet 6 inches long, and 2 feet 6 
inches broad. On removing the lid, a large urn was discovered 
at the one end lying on its side, and at the other, three smaller 
were standing, one of which contained a quantity of pure water. 
Near the large urn were fragments of skulls, and the intermediate 
space was occupied by decayed bones. The large urn is said to 
have been elegantly shaped. Two of them mouldered away on 
being touched. One of the smaller, which is still in the posses- 
sion of Mr Selkirk, is slightly ornamented. In the same garden,

which in some of the ancient charters is styled « Temple Garden » 
substructions of ancient buildings have been found at the depth of 
six teet from the surface. 

Accustomed to incessant warfare, the inhabitants of Jedbumh 
and lts forest were in ancient times much distinguished for bravery. 

I assure your Grace," says Lord Surrey, addressing Henry VIII 
respecting the storming of Jedburgh, « that I found the Scots at 
this time the boldest men and the hottest that ever I saw in any 
nation and all the journee ; upon all parts •£ the army they kept 
us with such continued skirmishes, that I never beheld the like If 
they could assemble 40,000 as good men as the 1500 or 2000 I 
saw, it would be hard to encounter them." Their favourite weapon 
was the Jedwood axe, which was manufactured at Jedburgh Their 
war cry, or slogan, was « Jedworth's here." The corporation of 
weavers possess two trophies,— one taken from the English at Ban- 
nockburn, and another from the Highlanders at Killiecrankie The 
corporation of shoemakers possess one trophy, taken from the Eng- 
lish at the battle of Newburn. The town-arms were anciently 
azure, a unicorn tripping, ringled, maned and horned; but these 
were succeeded by the present, a knight mounted in full armour 
with the motto, « Strenue et prospere." The term « Jedworth 
Justice," which implies execution before trial, is supposed to have 
originated in the illegal and tyrannical proceedings of Dunbar 
when superintending the courts of justice at Jedburgh. 

Modern Buildings. -The chief modern buildings are, Jedbumh 
Castle, containing a bridewell and prisons for criminals and debtors- 
the county-hall; and the meeting-houses of the first congregation 
of Seceders, and of the Relief. The modern mansion-houses are 
Edgerston, Mossburnford, Langlee, Lintalee, Hundalee, Glen- 
burnhall, Hunthill, Stewartfield, and Bonjedward. There are 
corn mills at Fernihirst, Hundalee, Newmills, Bonjedward, and two 
at Jedburgh. There are three manufactories at Jedburgh upon a 
respectable scale. These buildings are constructed of freestone. 
, HI. — Population. 

The population of this parish appears to have been anciently 
much greater than it is at present. In his dispatches to the court 
of Henry VIII., Lord Surrey states, that there were twice as many 
houses in Jedburgh as in Berwick, and well built, with many fair 
houses in garrison, and six good towers. The foundations of an- 
cient houses have occasionally been dug up at a great distance from

any of the modern buildings. The Townhead, or Castle Street, 
from the remains found in the gardens, appears to have presented 
on each side a series of closes, which might contain a dense popu- 
lation. About fifty years ago, many dwelling-houses, and upwards 
of forty malt-kilns, might be seen in ruins. In the country part 
of the parish many farm-houses have disappeared ; and in more 
than one instance, the site of a village is occupied by a single farm- 
house with its appendages. On the Jed are the ruins of four corn- 
mills. In the town this decrease of population has generally been 
ascribed to the influence of the union upon its trade ; and in the 
country, to the union of farms. In general, one individual now pos- 
sesses what formerly supported five or six respectable families. The 
monopoly of farms, though undoubtedly favourable to agriculture, 
has yet deprived the community of many of its most valuable mem- 
bers, by reducing them to the necessity of emigrating. It has 
lowered the character of the peasantry, and promoted the increase 
of pauperism. 

The population has, however, of late years been steadily increas- 
ing. The number of persons residing in the town at last census 
is 3617, in villages 403, and in the country 1627, in all 5647. In 
1811 it was 4454; in 1821, 5251. The total number of heritors 
is 82. Five of the larger proprietors reside in the parish. The num- 
ber of those who are proprietors of land to the yearly value of L. 50 
and upwards is 44. 

Number of families in the parish, - 1 232

The Scottish dialect is spoken throughout the parish, with a few 
local peculiarities. It is gradually losing ground ; but the corrupt 
English, which is succeeding, is scarcely to be regarded as an im- 
provement. The only popular game is that of ball, which, accord- 
ing to ancient custom, is celebrated at three different stations, — 
Jedburgh, Lanton, and Camptown. The ball is thrown with the 
hand towards the appointed goal, and, as the combatants are in ge- 
neral numerous and athletic, the struggle is often protracted and 
severe. The time when this game is played at Jedburgh is Fastern's 
eve, which is always the Tuesday following the first new moon after 
Candlemas. 

The inhabitants of this parish are in general intelligent, sober, 
orderly, and industrious. The bad effects of the reduction of the 
duty upon ardent spirits have indeed been felt to no small extent, 
but happily not to such a degree as to affect the general character 



16

of the people. " It is, indeed, one of the most striking evidences 
of the progress of civilization, and one of the most pleasing effects 
of a regular government, that, in a country formerly the scene of 
depredating violence, fewer instances of crimes, or of punishments, 
have occurred during the last fifty years, than perhaps in any other 
district of equal extent in the kingdom."

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — 

The number of acres in the parish, which are either cultivated or occasionally in til- 
lage, is, as nearly as can be ascertained, - 14,281 
The number of acres which remain constantly in pasture is - 6930 
under wood is 2488 

In the vicinity of Jedburgh the highest cultivation prevails. 

Rent of Land. — The annual rent of the fields adjoining the 
town is from L. 4 to L. 5 per acre. The general average is L. 2, 10s. 
per acre. The average rent of grazing is at the rate of from L. 2, 
15s. to L. 5 per ox or cow, and at the rate of 12s. for Leicester, 
and 6s. for Cheviot sheep. 

Rate of Wages. — The wages of ploughmen are paid by means 
of grain, potatoes, and the pasture of a cow, together with a small 
allowance of money, and amount to about L. 26 per annum. Other 
farm-labourers receive Is. 8d. per day, and women lOd. Smiths 
generally contract at the rate of from L. 2, 10s. to L. 2, 15s. per 
annum, for keeping in repair a plough, and a pair of harrows, and 
for shoeing a pair of horses ; furnishing for this purpose the neces- 
sary iron. Carpenters receive from 2s. to 2s. 6d. per day ; masons 
2s. 6d. per day. The price of manure per cart load is 3s. 6d. ; and 
the price of lime lid. 

Husbandry. — The husbandry generally pursued is the five-brick 
or five-shift husbandry, consisting of two white and three green crops. 
During the last twenty years, an immense quantity of waste land 
has been reclaimed, and in a short period, all that is capable of 
improvement will be reduced to a state of cultivation. The gene- 
ral duration of leases is nineteen years, which, on the whole, is fa- 
vourable both to the landlord and the tenant. The farm-buildings 
are mostly new and commodious ; the inclosures are numerous, and 
kept in good repair. The improvements which have been effected 
on the estate of Hunthill, consisting of draining, planting, &amp;c. are 
deserving of particular notice, and reflect great credit on the spirited 
proprietor Mr Bell. 

Quarries. — There are several excellent quarries in the parish, 
both of white and of a reddish-coloured sandstone.

Produce. — The average yearly amount and value of raw produce 
raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, are as follows: — 

Grain of all kinds, - - L. 20,580 2 0 

Potatoes, &amp;c. - 8,460 0 0 

Hay, - . - - 2,480 0 0 

Crops cultivated for the arts, - - 20 0 0 

Land in pasture, - 8,270 0 0 

Gardens and orchards, - - - 70 0 0 

Annual thinning and felling of woods, - 400 0 0 

Mines, &amp;c. - - - 30 0 0 

In all, - L. 40,310 2 0 

Manufactures. — The principal manufactures are blankets, flan- 
nels, tartans, shawls, shepherd's plaidings, hosiery, lamb's wool 
yarn, and carpets, for which between 300 and 400 hands are con- 
stantly employed. In the woollen manufactories, the usual time of 
labour for men, women, and children, may be stated at from ten to 
twelve hours daily. In the mills, the time of labour is fixed by the 
masters ; it was shortened about twenty years ago, long hours being 
found unprofitable to the employer, and injurious to the labourer. 
The wages are fully equal to what is given for similar work in other 
parts' of the country, but are by no means a fair remuneration to 
those who are employed in these manufactories. There are also 
an iron and brass foundery, and an establishment for the manufac- 
ture of printing presses, conducted by Mr Hope, the inventor, under 
a patent, for which twenty hands' are constantly employed. The 
occupations, both at the mills and at the foundery, are remarkably 
healthy, no instance having occurred of any individual being obliged 
to withdraw on account of ill health contracted at these establish- 
ments. The effect on morals is not so favourable. Children enter- 
ing at the age of nine, only partially instructed in reading, have 
little opportunity of acquiring religious knowledge. 

Associations. — There is a farmers' club for promoting the im- 
provement of stock, and of agriculture. The Roxburghshire Hor- 
ticultural Society meets at Jedburgh once a-month, commencing 
with April, and terminating with September, wh'ere prizes are 
awarded to successful competitors for flowers, fruit, vegetables, &amp;c. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Town. — The only market-town in the parish is Jedburgh, 
a royal borough, the county town of Roxburghshire, the seat of a 
presbytery, and of a Circuit Court of Justiciary. It is governed 
by a council, consisting of a provost, four bailies, a dean of guild, 
and eighteen ordinary councillors. There are eight incorporated 
trades, who annually elect their own deacons and office-bearers, 
and four of these deacons are admitted into the council to repre- 
sent the trades for the year. It unites with Haddington, North

Berwick, Lauder, and Dunbar, in sending a member to Parliament. 
The revenues of the borough amount at present to L. 573 per an- 
num, being chiefly derived from the rent of the mills. It enjoys 
one-third of the customs of St James' Fair, in the vicinity of Kelso, 
at which its magistrates preside ; a reward gained in ancient times 
by the valour of the inhabitants. The town is charmingly situate 
in the romantic valley of the Jed, environed with sylvan banks, 
and embosomed in venerable orchards. The streets are wide and 
clean, and the houses are well built. Around the town are seve- 
ral beautiful villas. It contains numerous handsome shops, in 
which all the necessaries, and most of the luxuries, of life can be 
readily procured. It is celebrated for the production of excellent 
bread, which is exported in great quantities to the north of Eng- 
land, as well as to the surrounding villages of the county. It is 
entitled to hold two markets every week, on Tuesday and Satur- 
day. The Tuesday's market is well attended, when grain is sold 
by samples to a considerable extent. There are two banks in 
Jedburgh, branches of the British Linen Company, and of the 
National Bank. The population residing within the boundaries 
fixed by the Reform Bill amounted, in 1831, to 3709. 

Villages. — The villages are Bonjedward, Ulston, and Lanton. 
The last contains 220 inhabitants. 

Means of Communication. — There is one post-office, and the 
length of turnpike roads in the parish is 18 miles. There are 
daily coaches to Edinburgh and Newcastle, and there is a coach 
twice a-week to Hawick and Kelso. There are at present five 
carriers, who travel every week betwixt Jedburgh and Edinburgh, 
and one of them twice a-week. Three travel betwixt Newcastle 
and Jedburgh, and two betwixt it and Berwick. 

There are ten stone bridges across the Jed; nine of which are 
in this parish, and eight within the space of four miles. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is conveniently situate 
for the inhabitants of the lower part of the parish ; but its dis- 
tance being four miles from the nearest, and ten from the remotest 
boundaries of the upper district, the aged and infirm, and, during 
the inclemency of winter, even the robust who reside in that quar- 
ter, are prevented from attending public worship. The distance 
from any other church is also great. The church consists of the 
western half of the nave of the Abbey, fitted up for modern wor- 
ship. It affords accommodation only for about 900 persons, thus 
excluding a great majority of the inhabitants ; and, what is more 
to be regretted, a considerable number who would willingly join 
the Established church. The manse was built in 1806. The

arable glebe consists of seven acres, worth L. 5 per acre, and the 
grass glebe lets for L. 13, 13s. per annum. The stipend is 19 chalders, 
meal and barley. The average number of communicants at the Esta- 
blished church is 677. Of late they have been rapidly increasing. 

The Dissenters, though a numerous class, do not here, as in 
some places, consist of a variety of separate sects, but present only 
two denominations, the Relief and the United Secession. They pos- 
sess three places of worship, and their ecclesiastical state is as follows : 

Relief. 1st cong. of Seceders. 2d cong. of do. 
Number of seats let, - 1000 1133 330 
communicants, 950 1530 300 
Amount of stipend, - L. 180 L. 200 L. 80  

Besides the amount of stipend stated, the ministers of the Se- 
cession have each an excellent dwelling-house and garden. The 
taxes of the minister of the first congregation are paid, and the mi- 
nister of the second congregation is allowed L. 22, 10s. per annum, 
for sacramental and travelling expenses. The stipends are derived 
from the seat rents. 

Divine service, both at the Established church and at the meet- 
ing-houses, is much better attended than it was some years ago ; 
but still it is to be regretted, that a great number, especially among 
the higher and the lower ranks, either forsake the assembling of 
themselves altogether, or attend to that duty with great irregularity. 

Religious Societies. — There are two religious societies, one for 
educational purposes, and another for the diffusion of religious 
knowledge in general. The probable average amount of their 
yearly collections is L. 40. 

Education. — The total number of schools in the parish is 14, 
of which three are parochial, and one is endowed by the Marquis 
of Lothian. The total number of scholars is 95.0, being about one- 
fifth of the population ; but of these 87 attend night schools, and 63 
female schools. The grammar-school of Jedburgh had attained con- 
siderable eminence, even so early as the commencement of the 
seventeenth century. The heritors, and especially the magistrates, 
as appears from the records of the borough, have always been at- 
tentive to its interests, and scrupulous in the choice of its rectors, 
and their care has been amply rewarded by the character which it 
has long possessed and still maintains. In the year 1804, the 
grammar-school and the English school of the borough were unit- 
ed, and their union has been found advantageous. The total num- 
ber attending the school at present is 170 ; — of these 45 are taught 

" The Dissenters come not merely from this parish, but from nine or ten surround- 
ing parishes. The difference between the sitters and communicants in the first con- 
gregation of Seceders is remarkable ; the numbers were given by the seat-letter and 
minister.

Latin and Greek. All of a certain standing, amounting at pres- 
sent to 100, are taught English grammar; all of a certain stand- 
ing, amounting at present to 56, are taught geography ; all of a 
certain standing, amounting at present to 110, are taught arith- 
metic. There are besides classes for geometry, algebra, practical 
mathematics, and French. 

The rector receives from the borough, L. 261, 18s. Scots, or 
L. 21, 6s. 8d. Sterling, for the English school, L. 12, on account 
of which he is bound to keep an assistant, and from the heritors, 
L. 8, 6s. 8d. amounting in all, to L. 42, 3s. 4d. The average 
amount of school fees is L. 170. Candlemas offerings amount to 
betwixt L. 40 and L. 50. The parochial schoolmasters at Rink 
and Lanton receive 100 merks each. No increase of the salaries 
of the teachers took place in 1831, in consequence of a difference 
of opinion as to the sources from which the rector's salary is derived. 
The teachers have the legal accommodations. The rector has an 
extensive establishment for boarders. The general expense of 
education per annum is, for classical scholars, L. 2, and for English, 
10s. The general average is L. 1. 

Literature. — There are several excellent public libraries in Jed- 
burgh. The " Company's Library" is an extensive and valuable 
collection of books, though the more recent additions to it bespeak 
a decline of taste. There are two smaller libraries, containing 
judicious selections, and one circulating library. By the aid of a 
liberal donation, and of a few subscriptions, itinerating libraries were 
lately established in the parish. Five divisions have been procured, 
consisting of fifty volumes each, which are placed at different sta- 
tions in the town and in the country. There is a reading society 
among the higher classes, for the purchase of new publications, 
which, after being perused, are sold, and the product, together with 
annual subscriptions, is appropriated to the purchase of others. 
There are libraries connected with the congregation and Sabbath 
evening schools of the first congregation of Seceders, and with 
the Sabbath evening schools of the second congregation and of 
the Relief. There are two public reading-rooms in Jedburgh. 

Charitable Institutions. — A dispensary was established in Jed- 
burgh chiefly by donations from the family of Lothian, in the year 
1807. It has since been supported by annual contributions. In 
1822, the late Marquis of Lothian, at his own expense, erected a 
commodious house with baths and other accommodations. Patients 
are received from the parishes of Jedburgh, Ancrum, Bedrule, 
Southdean, Hobkirk, Minto, Oxnam, and Crailing. The funds 
have hitherto been found sufficient. The number of patients upon

the books averages at 215 annually. Several members of a family, 
however, receive medicine and attendance on the same letter of re- 
commendation. 

There are two widows' schemes, and three friendly societies. 
The general impression respecting them seems to be, that they are 
productive of little advantage. 

Savings Bank. — The savings bank for the district of Jedburgh, 
consisting of the above-mentioned parishes, was established in 1815, 
chiefly by the exertions of Mr Rutherfurd of Edgerston. An auxi- 
liary fund for defraying the expense of management was raised by 
subscription. In the first year, the number of depositors was 123, 
and the sum deposited, L. 1440, and up to July 1832, the number 
of depositors has increased to 400, and the sum deposited to 
L. 6290, three-fourths of the depositors being females. The in- 
stitution has proved of signal advantage to the working classes, and 
is in a most flourishing condition. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid in the country part of the parish is 82. From 
Whitsunday 1831, to the same period 1832, the number is stated at 
92, and the sum required for their maintenance is L. 466 per an- 
num, allowing to each individual L. 5, Is. 3d. The poor of the 
borough are maintained distinct from those in the country. The 
average number is 80, and the sum allotted to their maintenance, 
is L. 350, 15s. 8d allowing to each L. 4, 7s. 8d. In the year 
1741, the annual sum was L. 148, 14s. lOd. and in 1801, L. 130. 
The former was a period of great scarcity. Of the 82 paupers at 
present on the roll in Jedburgh, 27 are above seventy years of age. 

The annual amount of collections at the church is about L. 40. 
The town of Jedburgh holds upon bond to the session, a sum aris- 
ing from the accumulation of various legacies, and chiefly of the 
Lady Yester, who was a daughter of Ker of Fernihirst, which pro- 
duces interest to the amount of L. 23 per annum. Some of this, 
according to the will of the donors, is appropriated to the educa- 
tion of poor children, some to the relief of the poor in the town, 
and some to the poor of the parish generally. But the poor are 
chiefly maintained by assessments, which were first levied in 1741, 
when voluntary contributions were found inadequate to their sup- 
port. The heritors meet at the terms of Candlemas, Whitsunday, 
Lammas, and Martinmas, and having ascertained the number of 
the poor, assess themselves for their maintenance during the en- 
suing quarter, in a sum proportioned to the valued rent of each. 
The persons whose names are on the roll are obliged to subscribe 
a bond, making over all their effects to the heritors, in order to

prevent the concealment of property, and the abuse of public cha- 
rity. The poor of the borough are provided for in a similar way. 
Assessors are appointed in different parts of the town, who meet 
before Whitsunday, and having examined the number and circum- 
stances of the poor, fix the assessment for the next quarter. The 
sum requisite for the other three quarters is fixed by the magis- 
trates. The sum to be paid by each individual is proportioned 
not merely to his ostensible property, but to the supposed profits 
of his trade and other apparent advantages. Both in the town and 
in the country, an interim supply is given in case of diseases or 
temporary distress. The distribution of parochial charity has un- 
doubtedly been productive of injurious effects, diminishing the spi- 
rit of independence, and repressing the feelings of natural affec- 
tion and gratitude. The assessments last year for the country 
poor amounted to L. 462, 9s. ; for the town poor to L. 430 ; in all, 
L. 992, 9s. 

Prisons. — The following is a statement of the number of per- 
sons confined in the gaol and bridewell, during the year 1831, 
and of the offences for which they were confined.

The gaol and bridewell are both well secured, being surround- 
ed with high walls surmounted by chevaux de frise. The prison- 
ers are divided into classes. Those convicted are kept separate 
from those confined previous to trial, males from females, and young 
offenders from old, and to each class a particular division of the gaol is 
appropriated. There are spacious courts, which afford the means of 
obtaining air and exercise, and proper attention is paid to the diet, 
cleanliness, and health of the prisoners. There is not, indeed, a 
more comfortable place of confinement in Scotland. The gaol 
and bridewell are superintended by a gaoler and a turnkey, under 
the inspection of the sheriff and of the magistrates of the borough. 

Fairs. — The royal charters of the town of Jedburgh entitle it

gust O. S. ; the third, or Rood-fair, on the 25th of September, 
or the first Tuesday after, if the 25th is Saturday, Sunday, or 
Monday ; and the fourth, or St Leonard's, on the first Tuesday of 
November O. S.. These fairs are for horses and cattle. There 
are hiring markets for servants at Whitsunday and Martinmas. 
In the year 1828, monthly markets were established for sheep and 
cattle at the request of the farmers' club. To encourage the de- 
sign, the magistrates dispensed with the exaction of custom, and 
the markets have succeeded beyond expectation. They are held 
on the third Saturday of every month, commencing with January 
arid ending with May. There is besides in this parish a great fair 
for sheep, which is held at Rink, about seven miles from Jedburgh, on 
July 12, and October 1 5. This fair is attended by a great concourse 
of farmers, and dealers in wool, both from Scotland and England. 

Inns and Alehouses. — There are sixteen inns in Jedburgh, and 
forty-seven alehouses, and in the country part of the parish three 
alehouses ; but the road trustees having resolved to grant a licence 
to toll-keepers, there will be in the country an increase of the num- 
ber of alehouses, and it is to be feared of dissipation. 

Fuel. — The fuel chiefly used is coal, which is procured from the 
north of England at the expense of from 8d. to lOd. per cwt. 
Coals were lately found at Whitelee, about twelve miles distant 
from Jedburgh, but only in sufficient quantities for supplying the 
lime-kilns. 

VI. — Miscellaneous Observations. 

Since the period when the last Statistical Account was written, 
the state of the parish has been much improved, — various kinds of 
manufactures have been introduced which were then unknown in 
this district, — farms which were entirely pastoral now bear luxuriant 
crops, — the fields have been neatly enclosed with hedges, — waste 
ground has been planted — the style of dwelling-houses, both in the 
town and in the country, is now vastly superior, — the means of commu- 
nication have been greatly enlarged, — the population has been near- 
ly doubled, — and all classes seem to enjoy a large share of the com- 
forts of civilized society. 

The direct line from London to Edinburgh passes through this 
parish, and, as the commercial relations of Scotland render rapi- 
dity of communication every day more desirable, it is to be hoped 
that those local and private interests, which have hitherto oppos- 
ed the establishment of this as the line of the London mail, will 
soon yield to the exigencies and advantage of the public.

PRESBYTERY OF SELKIRK, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. DAVID BAXTER, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The origin of the name of the parish is unknown. Ac- 
cording to Chalmers Caledonia, Vol. ii. it is a corruption of the 
Anglo-Saxon word " clif" littus vel ripa which signifies a haugh 
or bank. The name appears to have been differently written at 
different times. Thus in 1116, Lillescliva and Lillesclive; in 1 186, 
Lillesclif. — Chart. Glasgow ; in 1696, Liliesleafe ; in 1743, Lil- 
lies-leafe ; in 1750, Lilliesleafe ; in 1768, Lilliesleaf. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish is in length about five and 
three-fourths, and in breadth, two and one-half English miles, — 
comprehending upwards of 7000 acres English measure. Its form 
is quite irregular. It is bounded on the north by the parishes of 
Selkirk and Bowden ; on the west by those of Ashkirk and Wil- 
ton ; on the south and west, by that of Minto, where the three 
last parishes, and that of Lilliesleaf meet nearly at a point ; and 
on the east by the parish of Ancrum. The river Ale, after run- 
ning upwards of a mile in the parish, may be regarded as the na- 
tural boundary, for about two miles farther in its eastern course, 
towards the Tiviot, into which it falls. 

Topographical Appearances. — There are several elongated emi- 
nences, which generally run from east to west, a considerable dis- 
tance, in the form of ridges ; on one of which the only .village in 
the parish is situated. The declivities on the sides of these ridgy 
eminences are fertile and well cultivated. Again, there are rich 
valleys, and gently sloping banks, interspersed with thriving plan- 
tations and hedge-rows, which present in their combination a most 
agreeable aspect to the traveller. All this variety of ornament 
has been owing to the good taste of the proprietors. 

Soil, Climate, tyc. — The soils are loam, gravel, and clay, resting 
upon a whinstone tilly bottom ; and the climate is good in the east 
of the parish, but somewhat colder in the west. 



LILLIESLEAF.

About forty years ago, ague was prevalent in the village, — pro- 
bably owing to the effluvia of a considerable morass and pool, or 
rather loch, which stood on the low-lying mossy ground to the south, 
and in part also to the stagnant water that collected upon bad roads. 
Upon the draining of that loch, accordingly, this distemper in a 
great degree disappeared. It may be noticed, that the morass 
here alluded to was formerly the resort of sea-gulls or mews, in 
such vast numbers, that they are said to have fertilized a portion of 
an adjoining park still called Pick Maw Hill. The eggs of these 
fowls were then much sought after by the villagers. 

II. — Civil History. 
Antiquities. — This parish seems to have had its full share in the 
predatory warfare of the borders, from which it is distant at the nearest 
point about twelve miles. Of this, the number of fortalices, forts, or 
towers, which had been erected, bear ample evidence. Various in- 
dividuals of great age, who died within the last seventeen years, 
stated that, in their recollection, fourteen of these towers or forts ex- 
isted, the far greater part of which were situated in the village. 
But the largest tower or fort was at the eastern extremity, and 
seems to have been the strongest and the principal defence of 
the place. It was situated on the highest part of the ridge upon 
which the village stands, and, from its being two stories in 
height, must have commanded a very extensive view. Its defence 
would also be assisted by the large pool and morass on the south, 
by the river Ale, and the steep ascent on the north, — while the lairds 
of Riddell and their retainers would furnish support on the west. Of 
this largest tower, the only remains about twenty-six years ago, con- 
sisted of a part of one side, which was of great thickness and 
strength, and of stones, which shewed that its form had rather been 
an oblong than a perfect square. It might have easily contained 
100 men within its walls. There was also a fortalice or tower at 
Chapel, about a mile eastward, which was taken down about six 
years ago, situated in a convenient station for watching and ward- 
ing, and furnished with loop-holes for guns, arrows, or missiles ; 
— which narrowed to the inside, and gradually widened outwards. 
The other towers in the village seem to have been peels the com- 
mon houses of the inhabitants in these times which were towers of 
a small size, the remains of two of which still exist. This pecu- 
liar construction of houses, in the form of towers, seems to have 

• There is a tradition that this tower was inhabited about eighty years ago by a 
witch, at whose death there happened a dreadful storm.

been dictated by necessity to the wealthy and to the poor, for when 
" the English advanced from Berwick to Jedburgh, in September 
1521, with 10,000 men, there were six strong towers within the 
town, which continued their defence after the walls were surmount- 
ed. These were the residences of persons of rank, walled round, 
and capable of strong resistance."  

Conventicles. — During the persecutions in the reign of Charles 
II., when ministers and their people were prohibited by law, the 
one from preaching, and the other from hearing, the word of God, 
the moors in Lilliesleaf parish, from their retired situation, were fre- 
quently the resort of numerous conventicles; and for this offence, 
numbers in this parish appear to have been punished with death, 
imprisonment, or banishment, f 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners are, Mark Sprot, Esq. 
of Riddell, and William Currie, Esq. of Linthill. The parochial 
registers were regularly kept so far back as 1648; but having been 
allowed to get wet, apparently from lying in a damp situation, they 
are now partly illegible from decay. They appear to contain no- 
thing of public interest. 

Family of Riddell. — " The family of Riddell have been very 
long in possession of the barony called Riddell, or Ryedale, part 

• Tales of a Grandfather, by Sir Walter Scott. 

■J- In 1670, " His Majesty, understanding that divers disaffected persons have been so 
maliciously wicked and desperate as to convocate his Majesty's subjects to open meet- 
ings in the fields, and considering that these meetings are the rendezvous of rebellion, 
and tend in a high degree to the disturbance of the public peace, doth therefore statute 
and declare, that whosoever, without license and authority, shall preach, expound scrip- 
ture, or pray at any of these meetings in the field, or in any house where there be 
more persons than the house contains, so as some of them be without doors, or who 
shall convocate any number of people to these meetings, shall be punished with death 
and confiscation of goods." Severe penalties are then denounced against the persons 
attending such conventicles ; rewards are offered to informers ; and to stimulate the 
activity of the magistrates, the heavy fines exacted upon conviction are awarded to 

them Cook's History of the Church of Scotland, Vol. iii. p. 326. 

" In 1678, William Turnbul, brother to Walter Turnbul, in Bewlie, appeared be- 
fore the council for being present at house and field conventicles, and, refusing to de- 
pone upon the circumstances of them, is banished to the plantations." — Wodrow, 
Vol. i. p. 525. 

" In 1679, many ministers were put to trouble for conventicles, several were im- 
prisoned, among whom Mr Archibald Riddel, brother to the laird of Riddel." — Wod- 
row, Vol. ii. p. 124. 

Mr Riddel was eminently distinguished for piety and devotion to the service of God, 
by preaching in these troublous times, to the people of various conventicles, in different 
places, as well as Mr Blackader. " Some time before the communion at cast Nisbet, 
Mr Blackader kept a very great conventicle at Lilsly Lilliesleaf moor in Forest- 
shire. They had knowledge that the sheriff and some of the Lifeguards were ranging 
Lilsly moors, on the fore part of the day, upon which the meeting shifted their ground 
within Selkirkshire, thinking themselves safe, being out of his bounds," whither they 
were followed by the sheriff and his soldiers, whose ardour, however, was cooled by the 
firm deportment of the multitude, their fidelity and care of the minister, and the 
courage of the sheriff's sister, who was present, and had been an attentive hearer of 
the word preached.

of which still bears the latter name. Tradition carries their an- 
tiquity to a point extremely remote, and is in some degree sanc- 
tioned by the discovery of two stone coffins ; one containing an 
earthen pot filled with ashes and arms, bearing a legible date, a. d. 
727, the other dated 936, and filled with the bones of a man of 
gigantic size. These coffins were discovered in the foundations of 
what was, but has long ceased to be, the chapel of Riddell, and, 
as it was argued with plausibility that they contained the remains 
of some ancestors of the family, they were deposited in the mo- 
dern place of sepulture, comparatively so termed, though built in

Upon the death of Sir John B. Riddell, Bart, of Riddell, in 
April 1819, who farmed the greatest part of his estate, the lands 
were immediately laid out in grass. Such a rapid change com- 
pelled those who had been employed in cultivating his extensive 
domains to seek a livelihood elsewhere, and hence the immediate 
declension of the population in the next succeeding year was 68. 
These lands have almost wholly continued in grass ever since. 
Several families and individuals have emigrated to British America 
and the United States, at various periods during the last ten years. 

Under fifteen years, the number of persons is 279; from fifteen

 Sir Walter adds, that " the following curious and authentic documents warrant 
most conclusively the epithet of  Ancient Riddell.' 1st, A charter of David 1. to 
Walter Rydale, sheriff of Roxburgh, confirming all the estates of Lilies-clive, &amp;c. of 
which his father, Gervasius de Rydale, died possessed. 2d, A bull of Pope Adrian 
IV. confirming the will of Walter de Ridale, Knight, in favour of his brother 
Anschittil de Ridale, dated 8th April 1155. 3d, A bull of Pope Alexander III. 
confirming the said will of Walter de Ridale, bequeathing to his brother Anschittil 
the lands of Liliesclive, Whittunes, &amp;c. and ratifying the bargains betwixt Anschittil 
and Huctredus concerning the church of Liliesclive, in consequence of the mediation 
ot -Malcolm II., and confirmed by a charter from that monarch. This bull is dated

Others, dated 10th March 1120. It is remarkable that Liliesclive, otherwise Rydale 
or Riddell, and the Whittunes, have descended through a long train of ancestors 
without ever passing into a collateral line, to the person of Sir John Buchanan Rid- 
dell, the lineal descendant and representative of Sir Anschittil."

fifty, country part, 92, village, 86, = 178; from fifty to seventy, 
111; above seventy, 28; total in parish, 781. 

There are 8 unmarried men above fifty years, and 10 widowers 
ditto; and there are 18 unmarried women above forty-five years; 
and 5 resident heritors having above L. 50 of annual rent. Seven 
are non-resident, besides about a dozen feuars, most of whom are 
resident. 

In December 1831, the population of the village was 380, and 
of the country, 425. It may be proper to observe, that the popu- 
lation of this parish is about 30 generally in the winter half-year, 
above what it is in the summer half. The chief cause of this dif- 
ference seems to arise from the temptation of service in summer, 
when the wages to a female-servant are from L. 4 to L. 5, 10s. and 
the temptation to come home in winter, when the wages are from 
L. 1, 5s. to L. 2. A number of boys also get service in summer, 
who cannot obtain employment during winter, f 

Character of the People. — They are in general industrious in 
their calling, and respectable in their station. They are also regu- 
lar in their attendance on the institutions of religion, and possess 
a good knowledge of its doctrines and precepts. There are many 
who have treasured up these in their minds as principles for me- 
ditation and rules of conduct. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — The number of English acres 
now in tillage is about 2600 ; uncultivated and chiefly mossy 
ground, 50 acres. There are about 2000 acres of high-lying 
land formerly cultivated, but now in grass for pasture, which should - 
not be again brought into tillage, unless the prices of grain rise 
higher than they have been for many years past. There might 
be 1000 acres on the estate of Riddell added to the cultivated 
land in the parish with great advantage. This land having been 
let in grass parks during many years, there can be no doubt 
that capital would yield a profitable return by being laid out in 
its cultivation. The quantity in undivided common does not ex- 
ceed two or three acres. The plantations, &amp;c. of forest trees 
amount to about 600 acres, consisting of larch and Scotch firs, 

" A few of the last class above eighty. 

f It may be noticed, that the great number of beggars who traverse Scotland hav- 
ing no fixed residence, have not been reckoned in the population returns. In this 
parish, for a great number of years past, about fifteen, upon an average, have daily 
passed through it. A similar number may be found in many other parishes. They 
form no less than a fifty-second part of the population of these places, and are there- 
fore a considerable omission in the Government returns.

with a proportion of oak, ash, and elm, and are in general well- 
managed. There is scarcely any natural wood. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of the arable farms is not 
easily ascertained, varying as it does from 10s. to L. 1, 15s. per 
acre, English. Leases of farms, granted four or five years ago, 
being too high, must fall at their expiry, unless the prices of agri- 
cultural produce shall have advanced. Village acres, of which 
there are many, have lately let at L. 3 per acre. About twenty 
years ago they were let at L. 5 per acre. The average price of 
grazing a cow upon arable land during the season, L. 5. A full- 
grown ox do., L. 4; and a full-grown sheep for one year 12s. But 
upon the 2000 acres of high-lying land, one-half of the above rates 
is enough. 

Prices of Provisions. — Butcher-meat is about 1 |d. per lb. dearer 
than in Edinburgh; good fowls from Is. 4d. to Is. 6d. each; cheese 
about 6d. per lb. of 16 oz. ; butter, 8d. to lOd. per lb. ditto. 

Improvements. — Thegreatest improvement in the parish would be 
to lime the lands kept in tillage ; but the distance being twenty- 
eight or thirty miles from the lime-kiln, and the expense so great, 
not less than L. 5 per English acre, it is doubtful whether the laying 
on of lime would defray to the farmer the expense of his outlay. 
On dry land, perhaps, it might repay ; but not on clay soils. Se- 
veral farmers have for some years past applied lime to their lands, 
and one has extended it, though in a defective quantity, over his 
whole farm, consisting of about 170 or 180 acres: and, from the 
superior crops consequent thereon, it will certainly amply repay 
the expense of outlay. 

Produce. — The average amount of raw produce raised in the 
parish cannot be accurately ascertained. The following statement 
may, however, afford an approximation. Taking all the arable 
land presently in tillage at 2600 acres, and the four -course shift 
for the data, the amount may be thus stated: 

1300 English acres in corn crop, of all the different kinds, at L. 5 per 

acre, - - L. 6500 0 0 

150 do. hay, at L. 3 per do. - ... 450 o q

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Means of Communication. — The nearest market-towns are Sel- 
kirk and St Boswell's, from each of which the parish is distant six 
English miles. A daily penny-post has been established in this 
parish from Selkirk, under the authority and subject to the regu- 
lations of the General Post- Office, Edinburgh : it is doing well, 
and promises to be of great benefit to the parish and neighbour- 
hood. This is indeed a great acquisition when compared with 
the dilatory and uncertain receipt and dispatch of letters, &amp;c. 
hitherto experienced. 

The roads are generally good in all directions, though there are 
none of them turnpike, the whole having been made in a very pro- 
per manner from the statute-labour funds, at the rate of 40s. Ster- 
ling on every L. 100 Scotch of valuation, paid equally by proprie- 
tors and tenants, and they are kept in good repair. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The situation of the parochial church, 
now in good repair, and capable of containing the parishioners, is 
as convenient as possible for the great body of the people. It 
was built in 1771, upon a deep loamy soil, lower than the conti- 
guous grounds, and, from its injudicious situation, is consequently 
damp. The old church must have been of ancient erection, though 
the precise period cannot be traced from known records : on a 
stone of the eastern aisle contiguous to its ancient situation, there 
is the date 1110. No seat rents are demanded, — admission being 
free, after heritors and tenants are accommodated. L. 100 Ster- 
ling was mortified about a century ago to the kirk-session for be- 
hoof of the poor, the interest of which is regularly applied to its 
original purpose by direction of the heritors. 

The manse was built very superficially in 1821 upon the lowest 
of eight estimates, and within the space of a year considerable re- 
pairs were found necessary, and executed to prevent the admission 
of rain-water through the walls, they being almost destitute of lime. 
The glebe consists of about eleven acres, and was lately valued by 
two intelligent farmers at L. 17 per annum. 

The present stipend, decreed in 1820, consists of 16 chalders, 
and L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. A final decreet of 
locality has been extracted, and gives as follows : L. 45, Is. 7|d. 
money, including communion elements; 1 firlot, 2 pecks, 2f lip-

pies, wheat; 112 bolls, 3 stones, 3 lib. meal; 81 quarters, 6 
bushels, 1 peck, and 2 quarts, barley, all paid by the fiars prices. 

A dissenting chapel was erected during the incumbency of the 
late Mr Stalker in this parish, about twenty-six years ago : it be- 
longs to the United Associate Synod persuasion, the minister of 
which is understood to be paid, along with the interest of debt up- 
on the chapel, &amp;c. from the seat rents and collections.

The attendants on the Established church at Lilliesleaf have 
continued to increase for a number of years past ; and the attend- 
ants on the United Associate Chapel, as above, in Lilliesleaf, have 
been proportionally decreasing for several years past. 

Education. — There are two schools in this parish, viz. the pa- 
rochial and a private. The salary attached to the former is L. 25, 
13s. 4d. besides an addition, on the teacher's proving diligent, of 
school-fees for a number of the poorest scholars : which addi- 
tion, on an average of some years, has exceeded L. 5. annually; 
also L. 1, lis. 10d. for deficiency of garden-ground. He is also 
clerk to the heritors, for which he receives L. 4 annually, &amp;c. 
His school fees have been stated to me at L. 17 a-year. He pos- 
sesses all the legal accommodations. The heritors lately built a 
most excellent school-room. The branches generally taught at 
this school are English reading and grammar ; writing, arithmetic, 
Latin, and French. The teacher is well qualified, and has, of late, 
adopted the improved system of education, which affords ground 
to expect a great increase to his school. 

The private school is supported by a teaching-room, free of 
rent : and the school-fees are about one-fourth higher than those 
of the parochial, amounting to about L. 26 annually. In this 
school, viz. the private, are taught English reading, writing, and 
arithmetic ; the latter only tolerably well, the former two in the 
most vulgar manner. The teacher has no education superior to a 
common labourer, and refuses to apply for farther information. 
There are none in this parish unacquainted with reading or writ- 
ing. 

Library. — A library was established about sixteen years ago, 



32 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



consisting of books presented as donations, or purchased from the 
fees of admission and subscriptions. 

Friendly Societies. — There were a few aged individuals now 
deceased within the last seventeen years, who derived aid from 
a friendly society. But no person here is now known to join any 
society of this sort, each looking to the parochial funds. Saving 
banks are in similar disrepute. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of individuals 
or families who receive parochial aid«is 20, each, according to 
circumstances, receiving from L. 3 to L. 10, 8s. per annum, paid 
quarterly. In addition to which there are seven others who re- 
ceive temporary or occasional supplies. The average annual 
amount obtained for their relief is, of church collections, L. 7, 
6s. 4d. ; interest of mortified money, L. 4; from mortcloth, 13s.; 
and of assessments on the heritors, L. 126, 10s. 4d. Total, 
L. 138, 9s. 8d. 

Assessments were introduced about sixty-eight years ago. The 
heritors meet quarterly by legal intimation to assess themselves 
according to their rents. Assessments have undoubtedly been of 
great benefit when rightly applied ; but they have also done much 
evil, wherever there has been any want of discrimination betwixt 
cases of real need, and clamorous applications from persons of 
idle inclinations. There are numbers who reckon it a degra- 
dation, and are most unwilling, to become a burden on the poor's 
funds, until obliged by necessity; but there are others who, from 
inclination to idleness, and other irregularities, forsake the ho- 
nourable path of industry, and exert every species of ingenuity 
to be put upon the poor's roll; and, when once admitted to an 
interim supply, have recourse to mean and degrading shifts to be 
continued. Assessments for the poor being high in this parish 
compared to its population, and drawn almost entirely from those 
in wealthier circumstances, there is in consequence a diminution 
of church collections. 

j nnSt — There are four licensed houses in the village where spi- 
rits and ale are sold ; one-half of this number would be amply suf- 
ficient. They are of an injurious influence upon the lower orders. 

j._Coal, a little peat of inferior quality, brushwood, and 
thinnings of plantations, constitute the fuel of this parish; the first 
of which, being about thirty miles distant from the Lothian and 
English coal-mines, is very high in price,— higher, indeed, than in 
any of the neighbouring parishes, which are nearer either to the 



LILLIESLEAF. 



33 



one or the other of the mines. Peat is nearly exhausted, and con- 
fined in use to some feuars and a few tenants. Brushwood is 
dear as fuel ; and, though very expensive, coal is by far the cheaper 
and more comfortable. It was remarked in the former Statistical 
Account of this parish, that " in the article of firing, the inhabit- 
ants must be at a greater expense than any parish of the south of 
Scotland." 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

The more striking variations betwixt the present state of the 
parish, and that which existed at the time of the last Statistical 
Account in 1793, are, 1st, That the whole roads are now good and 
well made. 2fZ, That a large extent of land has been planted with 
forest trees for utility and ornament. About forty years ago there 
were not 100 acres planted, now there are about 600; the late Sir 
John Riddell, Bart, having planted from 300 to 400 acres about 
thirty or forty years ago. 3d, That the modern system of husbandry 
has now been fully introduced, — all the dry land, when in fallow, 
being sown down with turnip in drills, well-dunged and properly 
cleaned, — the clean fallow properly wrought and kept free of weeds, 
and dung laid thereon, and a break regularly laid down with grass 
seeds. ' Farm-steadings have also mostly all been rebuilt with 
stone and lime, covered with slate, and made perfectly convenient 
for the farm ; and thrashing-machines have been introduced upon 
almost every farm. 

All classes of the people in this parish can now find employment 
if they are at all willing to work.

PRESBYTERY OF SELKIRK, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. THOMAS JOLLIE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The first mention of this parish occurs in the foun- 
dation charter of Selkirk, before the year 1124, when it was grant- 
ed to the monks by David I., under the name of Bothenden. In 
charters granted in the years 1159 and 1232, the former by Mal- 
colm IV., and the latter by Walter, Bishop of Glasgow, and both 
confirming David's grant, we find the parish named Botheldene and 
Boulden. It is plausibly conjectured that the first of these names 
was derived -from a St Bothen or Bodwin, and that it came in time 
to be abbreviated to Boulden, which was again corrupted to Bow- 
den. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The greatest length of the parish is 
6 miles, and breadth 4 miles. At an average it may be about 
four by three miles in extent, and contains twelve square miles. 
It is bounded on the north by Melrose parish; on the east, 
mostly by St Boswells, partly also by Ancrum; on the south, by 
Lilliesleaf; on the west by Selkirk; and on the north-west by 
Galashiels. 

Topographical Appearances. — It is of an irregular oblong figure. 
One of the Eildon Hills and one-half of another are in this parish. 
From one broad and elevated base their three conical tops arise, 
which, from their situation in a flat country, more than from their 
height, are seen at a great distance. Their elevation above the 
level of the sea, as stated by the late Sir John Leslie, is 1364 feet ; 
while that of the parish is, at an average, 450 feet. The gene- 
ral surface of the parish may be well described as consisting of 
a series of parallel ridges, lying from west to east, and from the 
parallel elevations from which the Eildon Hills arise, lessening 
in height towards the south,— with intermediate valleys, more or 
less wide, each having its own rill, which runs eastward to the 
Tweed, about two miles distant from the middle of the parish. 



BOWDEN. 



35 



Towards the south-west, where the above-mentioned parallel ridges 
are not so strongly marked, one or two small burns find their way 
into Ale .Water, which forms the southern boundary of the parish. 
It may be remarked, that these ridges come shooting away from a 
high flat moorland in the eastern extremity of Selkirkshire, which 
from this part of Roxburghshire bounds the view to the west. 

Climate. — It may be remarked generally, that the prevailing 
winds are from the S. W., as may be seen by their effects upon 
trees in exposed places ; that our most severe snow storms are from 
the N. E. ;• that our steadiest and driest weather is from the N. W.; 
and that, about the end of April and beginning of May, cold and 
occasionally frosty winds prevail from th6 east, which are injurious 
to vegetation, and are ready to bring disease on fruit-trees. Our 
climate is high and rather cold. It appears, from the notice of 
climate in the former Statistical Account of this parish, that it has 
improved considerably since 1794. This may be owing to the 
draining of land and mosses, to the general use of lime for land, 
to the raising of plantations of firs and other trees, as well as to 
other less obvious causes. In connection with this improvement of 
climate we may remark, that consumptions and fevers, which thirty 
or forty years ago were very prevalent in this parish, are now com- 
paratively little known. 

Geology and Mineralogy.— The rock on the south side of the 
parish runs from east to west, inclining to the south-west and north- 
east. It is commonly found in thin layers or strata, with occa- 
sional seams of dent between the strata. The rock dips to the 
south, at an angle of from 40 to 60 degrees. It consists generally 
of whinstone. On Bowden moor it is clay porphyry, and is largely 
made use of for road metal, for which it is very excellent. The 
only object of note, however, in the parish of a geological descrip- 
tion is the Eildon Hills. They stand upon a level plain of con- 
siderable extent, a little to the south of Melrose. They are, at the 
base, about seven miles in compass. The rocks of which they con- 
sist are felspar, and felspar porphyry. In the south-west point of 
these hills a quarry has been cut, in which the rock is found to con- 
sist of regular pentagonal prisms, about fifteen inches in diame- 
ter. The pillars are extremely elegant and beautiful, and sharper 
in their angles than most basaltic columns, and of a pale flesh - 
colour. The height of the pillars, as yet laid bare, is about twenty 
feet ; but, when farther cleared, they will probably be found to reach 
the schistose formation on which the mountains repose.

ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



Botany. — The plants not frequently found elsewhere, and com- 
mon in the vicinity of Bowden, are the following: — Osmunda crispa, 
small flowering stone-fern, on the eastern side of the north-east 
peak; Lycopodium clavatum, common wolf s-claw; and Lycopodium 
alpinum, cypress wolf's-claw, on the south-west hill among the 
dwarfish heath ; Sanguisorba officinalis, Burnet ; and Peucedanum 
Silaus, yellow sulphur-wort, all around the hase of the hills ; Pri- 
mula veris, cowslip, is not found growing naturally in the course of 
the Tweed, or its western tributaries, until the junction of Bowden 
Burn ; but after this it is plentiful, and likewise on every dry bank 
and rocky knoll to the southward of the village of Bowden, and 
for several miles towards 'the Tiviot ; Plantago media is likewise a 
rare plant to the westward and northward. It is not found in Sel- 
kirkshire, but plentifully on the southern base of the Eildon Hills, 
and on every bank around the village. 

Plants rare in the vicinity. Hypericum quadrangulum, St Peter's 
wort, in the rill from a spring on the north side of Bowden moor; 
Geranium lucidum, lately grew on the walls of the old castle of 
Holydean ; Salix repens, on a hedge-hank to the north of the farm- 
house of Prieston. 

The highest peak of the Eildons is covered so closely for about 
two acres with Vaccinium myrtillus by no means plentiful else- 
where in the neighbourhood as almost to exclude any other plant, 
and also Digitalis purpurea and alba, and henbane. 

Trees of different kinds, particularly oak, ash, and fir, have been 
found in the mosses while digging for peat and marl. These are 
sometimes of large dimensions, and are found at a considerable 
depth in the moss ; but, in so far as is known, none of them have 
been in a petrified state. 

Soil, c. — The soil of the parish is of avaried character. The north, 
and part of the west side, are chiefly a stiff clay, from seven to twelve 
inches deep, upon a damp, hard, tilly subsoil. The southern part 
of the parish is generally lighter, particularly on the ridges, which 
run from west to east, where the cultivated soil, though thin, is dry 
and friable, producing good turnips and other crops. Betwixt these 
ridges there is a good loamy soil. 

There are considerable quantities of moss and shell marl in the 
parish ; the marl is under the moss. Below the marl is a layer of 
fine blue clay, and under the clay there is generally whinstone rock. 

II. — Civil History. 
Antiquities.— Holydean, a farm in this parish, was, in ancient 



HOWDEN. 



37 



times, the occasional residence of the Roxburghe family. A plan 
of this place was sketched a few years ago, and presented to His 
Grace the Duke of Roxburghe. In that plan, the site of the build- 
.ings is delineated, as far as that could be correctly ascertained, by 
inspecting the foundations, and the portions of the walls still stand- 
ing, and by information received from old individuals resident near 
the place. The plan is believed to be correct in its proportions. 
The house and lands of Holydean were included in the grant made 
by David I. to the monks of Selkirk, and were confirmed to them, 
by renewed charters, after their translation to Kelso. At this place 
they had a grange or farm for feeding cows and sheep, and raising 
corn. In the sixteenth century, the lands of Holydean were be- 
stowed by royal grant upon Sir Walter Kerr of Cessford, ancestor 
of the ducal house of Roxburghe, as a reward for border services. 
Different opinions are entertained as to the year in which this took 
place. In Douglas's Scottish Peerage, and Chalmers' Caledonia, 
it is said to have been in 1569, while by others we are informed 
that it was in 1530 ; and we consider it a very strong circumstance 
in favour of the latter opinion, that there is still to be seen at the 
place a stone, of which we shall by-and-by make more particular 
mention, having on it, together with the arms of the house of Ker, 
the date 1530. " Holydean," says the former Account, " was, 
not long ago, a strong fortification of its kind. The court-yard, 
containing about three-fourths of an acre, was surrounded by a 
strong stone and lime wall, four feet thick, and sixteen feet high, 
with slanting holes between five free-stones, about thirty feet from 
each other, from which an arrow or a musket could have been point- 
ed in different directions. Upon an arched gateway in the front, 
there was a strong iron gate. Within the court stood two strong 
towers, the one of three, the other of five stories, consisting of eight 
or ten lodgeable rooms, besides porters' lodges, servants' hall, vault- 
ed cellars, bake-houses, &amp;c." The walls of these towers were four 
feet thick, and their roofs and floors were of the strongest oak. 
They were both perfectly entire, and in excellent condition, at no 
distant date. About seventy-four years ago, the commissioner 
to John, the third Duke of Roxburghe, his Grace being then 
in his minority and abroad, ordered the buildings to be mostly 
pulled down, for the sake of getting the freestones in them to 
build a large farm-house and appurtenances. One of the large 
vaults still remains in good repair, and is used by the tenant for 
sheltering carls and oilier agricultural implements. There is also 



38 



ROXBURfiHSHIKK. 



a portion of the court wall standing on the south side, but it is 
now in a ruinous state, and appears to have decayed much since 
1795, when, according to the former Account, there were about 
160 feet of it perfectly entire. However, the fragment that re- 
mains is sufficient to give a clear idea of the former strength and 
magnificence of the place, and to make us regret deeply the de- 
molition of a building that was so stately and ornamental, and also 
so venerable for its antiquity. A stone, to which we have already 
alluded, preserved from the ruins, and now a lintel to the door of 
the old farm-house at Holydean, has in the middle a unicorn's 
head and three stars, with this inscription on either side ; " Feer 
God. Flee from sin. Mak for the lyfe everlasting to the end. 
Dem Isobel Ker, 1530." 

A few yards to the north-east of the portion of the wall already 
mentioned, is the ancient well belonging to the house. It is still 
in good order, and affords to the family, now living at Holydean, an 
abundant supply of excellent water. This well was built in the 
eastern wall of the court, and was about ten feet from the door of 
the eastern tower. 

About 140 yards north-west from the principal house, on the 
top of a precipice overhanging a deep dell or dean, called Ringan's ' 
Dean, there was a chapel or place of worship, with a burying- 
ground, as clearly appears, not only from traditionary report, but 
also from the foundations of the building, which have been traced, 
and from grave-stones, handles of coffins, and human bones, which 
have been dug up in that place ; and hence has probably arisen 
the name Holydean or Haliedean. 

The greatest curiosity of its kind in this quarter, and perhaps 
of a similar nature anywhere else, is a stone dike or wall built 
without lime or cement of any kind, which encloses about 500 acres 
of the farm of Holydean, and has stood upwards of 300 years, and 
is still a tolerably good fence. It had, at first, been six or seven 
feet high, with cope stones. In an old tack or lease this enclosure 
is called " the Great Deer Park of Haliedean." 

Beneath the east end of the parish church is a vault, the bury- 
ing-place of the noble family of Roxburghe. It contains twenty-one 
coffins ranged along the sides of the apartment. In that number 
are included the coffins of the five previous dukes. 

The remains of a military road, with circular stations or camps, 
at the distance of from two to three miles from each other, supposed 

to be Roman, caif be traced across the centre of the parish, in a 

4 



BOWDEN. 



.39 



line from south-east to north-west. In some places all vestiges of 
it are destroyed by the plough,. but in other places it can be easily 
traced in the form of a large ditch, about twenty feet wide, and in 
a few spots, of two ditches of that width, and about fifty feet dis- 
tant from each other. The camps or stations are all on eminences 
in view of each other ; and warlike instruments of various descrip- 
tions have been dug up by people ploughing and ditching around 
them, as well as in the adjacent mosses. 

- There is an old cross in the centre of the village of Bowden, but 
the date of its erection is unknown. There were also within the 
last twenty years, several peels or square towers in the village, con- 
taining in the under part an apartment for cattle, and, in the upper 
part, one or two small apartments for the accommodation of the 
family, and to which they got access by an outer stone stair. The 
remains of one or two of these peels are still to be seen. 

Land-owners. — The principal land-owners in the parish are, His 
Grace the Duke of Roxburghe ; John Seton Karr, Esq. of Kippi- 
law ; the Misses Henderson of Eildon Hall ; Captain Riddel 
Carre of Cavers ■ Mark Sprott, Esq. of Riddel ; Colonel Sibbald 
of Whiterig ; William Currie, Esq. of Linthill ; Nicol Mill, Esq. 
of Paldon Side ; Dr Scott of Eastfield ; Peter Pennycook, Esq. 
of Newhall; Andrew Buckum, Esq. of Temple Hall; Andrew 
Arnot, Esq. of Milridge Hall ; and the Royal Infirmary of Edin- 
burgh. Besides these, there are about fifty small proprietors. 

Parochial Registers. — A parochial register of births and mar- 
riages, begun in the year 1697, is kept by the schoolmaster as 
session-clerk ; but, we regret to say, is not so complete as could be 
wished, owing to the carelessness of parents in getting the births 
of their children entered. 

Buildings. — Except the handsome and commodious mansion- 
houses of Cavers Carre, Linthill, and Kippilaw, there are no 
modern buildings in the parish worthy of special notice, unless, in- 
deed, we speak of several farm-houses, which have been lately built 
in a superior style, and a remarkably neat and comfortable school- 
room, erected last season in the village of Bowden upon an ap- 
proved plan, which reflects the highest credit on the liberality of 
the heritors. 

III. — Population. 
The population of this parish in 1755 was 672 ; in 1794 it was 
860; and at present it is 1010. The increase of population may 
be ascribed, partly to the improvements in agriculture, and partly 



40 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



to the greater number of labourers that have of late been employed 
on the roads. Though not closely connected with this branch of 
the subject, we may here remark, that the roads afford a most be- 
neficial source of employment to the labourer. Having a long time 
to fulfil his contract, he has recourse to them when all other jobs 
fail, and in frosty weather, when he can work at nothing else.

Habits, Character, Sfc. of the People. — The habits of the people 
are fast improving in regard to cleanliness ; and their style and 
manner of dress are modest, neat, and substantial. 

The people enjoy, in a great degree, the comforts and advan- 
tages of society, and, upon the whole, may be said to be contented 
with their situation and circumstances. They are, in general, well 
informed upon religious and other subjects, and deserve to be 
highly commended for their honesty, sobriety, and industry, and a 
strict regard to moral rectitude in their ordinary demeanour. 
Neither smuggling nor pawnbroking are known in the parish, and 
poachers are very seldom heard of.

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — The number of acres in the 
parish, which are either under regular rotation of arable culture, or 
are occasionally broken up from grass for that purpose, extends to 
about 3460. The lands which have not been broken up and cul- 
tivated within the last sixty years, and are not likely to be again 

 No register of deaths is kept ; but it is believed the average given is near the 
truth. The register of births and marriages being incomplete, the above remark 
must, in part, be applied to the averages taken from it.

broken up to any great extent, may be stated at about 2531 acres. 
Takino- into consideration the coldness of the climate and other 
local impediments, it is a matter of doubt, whether the extent of 
land kept under arable culture could be increased with advantage. 
Two or three hundred acres may, however, be advantageously 
taken out of grass, cleaned and cultivated, and then laid down 
again in an improved state for permanent pasture ; and a conside- 
rable quantity more might be improved by draining and top-dres- 
sing without breaking up. 

The feuars of Bowclen and Midlem have thirty acres of undivid- 
ed common grass land, the pasturage of which is let annually for 
a small sum by the feuars, while all the inhabitants of the villages 
have the privilege of cutting turfs, peats, and divots on it. The 
commons are partly overrun with whins, and being surrounded by 
arable fields, present rather an unseemly appearance. 

Wood. — Around the residences of several of the proprietors, 
there are some fine old trees, and in the Duke of Roxburghe's 
ancient park at Holydean, there is a natural wood about forty 
acres in extent, chiefly old birch trees. Around the church-yard 
of Bowden there are several remarkably large sycamore and ash 
trees ; the latter, indeed, are considered the oldest and largest of 
the kind in this district. There are also in the parish a consider- 
able number of plantations of more recent growth, chiefly planted 
within the last forty years. The most extensive and conspicuous 
of these is on the southern side of the Eildon Hills. The others 
consist principally of sheltering and ornamental belts of various 
sizes and shapes. Taken altogether, the land under wood may ex- 
tend to somewhat above 260 acres. Although much has been 
done of late in the way of planting, there is still great room for 
improvement. This remark is particularly applicable to the west 
and north-west sides of the parish, where there is, comparatively, but 
little wood, and where the greatest advantage, both as to orna- 
ment and shelter, would be obtained by planting on a large scale. 
In other parts of the parish, where shelter is not so much requir- 
ed, various pieces of waste land, which cannot be profitably culti- 
vated, and several of which are to be found in patches within cul- 
tivated fields, might be beneficially planted. It may further be 
observed, that when shelter is the principal object, plantations are 
frequently made too narrow to be effective. By increasing their 
width, additional shelter would not only be obtained, but the growth 



42 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



of the trees promoted, and success secured in exposed situations 
where trees are liable to die prematurely. 

The trees planted are oak, ash, elm, birch, beech, sycamore, 
Scotch, larch, spruce and silver firs : and alder and willows are 
planted in marshy places. Oak, elm, and sycamore thrive well, 
even upon cold, clay land, and in exposed situations in this parish, and 
it is to be regretted a larger proportion of these varieties has not 
been planted. Shelter has been the principal object in stripe or 
belt plantings, and too large a proportion of the fir tribe has ge- 
nerally been set in them. It has been observed that the spruce 
firs, which had been set in those plantings, throve well while young, 
but they soon began to dwindle, and do not now appear likely to 
arrive at maturity, while the few silver firs, which have been plant- 
ed, continue to thrive well, and are likely to become fine timber. 
In cases where a fair proportion of deciduous forest trees have been 
planted, particularly of oak, elm, and sycamore, they have, as before 
observed, thriven well even upon cold land and in exposed situa- 
tions. Where the fir trees have been removed gradually and in 
due time, the hardwood timber trees are likely to become ulti- 
mately not only a source of great profit to the proprietors, but also 
beneficial to the occupiers, by giving permanent shelter in place of 
the fir trees, which soon lose their side branches and cease to give 
effective shelter. The hardwood trees will likewise become more 
ornamental than the fir. Injury has in a few instances been done 
to deciduous forest trees by pruning their side branches close off 
from their stems. In the opinion of men of experience, timber 
trees thrive best, either when they have not been pruned in any 
way, or when being pruned, the branches have been shortened at a 
distance from the stems, and above there are secondary branches 
springing from the largei' side branches. 

Rent, fyc. — The average rent of arable land in the parish is 
about 17s. 6d. per acre; the charge for summering a cow is L. 3, 5s. ; 
a three year old, L. 2, 15s. ; a two year old, L. 1, 17s. : a one year 
old, L. 1, 10s.; for wintering a cow on straw, with a little hay or 
turnip in spring, L. 2, 5s. ; a three year old, on straw without tur- 
nip L. 1, 10s. ; a two year old, L. 1, 5s. ; a one year old, L. 1. 

The charge for keeping a ewe of the Leicester breed on improv- 
ed land is L. I per annum, and for a young sheep of I ho same 
kind 12s. The above rates for sheep include turnip in spring. 
The charge for keeping a Cheviot ewe on outfield or inferior land 



BOWDEN. 



43 



b Gs. 6d. per annum, and for a young sheep of the same breed 5s., 
without turnip in both cases. 

Rate of Wages. — The wages of principal ploughmen are from 
L 9 to L. 10, 10s. per annum, with board ; of maid-servants, for 
the summer half-year, from L. 4 to L. 5, and for the winter half- 
year from L. 1, 12s. to L. 2, with board; married men-servants, 
or hinds, get 100 stones oatmeal; 15 bushels of barley; 6 -bushels 
of pease; from L. 2 to L. 3 of money; a cow kept; 1200 yards 
of drill, lineal measure, for potatoes ; a cap of lint sown ; and a 
house and garden, for which they furnish a shearer, who receives 
meat from the employer, but no wages. This is the usual prac- 
tice ; but sometimes they have a cow's milk allowed them, or a cow 
of their own kept, potatoes as before described, 52 stones of oat- 
meal, a free house, and from L. 9 to L. 10 of money. In both 
cases the servant gets 48 cwt. of coals, for which he pays the charge 
at the coal-hill, and the master brings them home to him, paying 
every other charge. 

A rood of mason work, furnishing all materials, costs from 
L. 5 to L. 6, 10s. according to circumstances ; for labour only, from 
L. 1, 14s. to L. 2, 4s. The rood contains 36 square yards, from 
18 inches to 2 feet thick. Full-growa fir wood costs from 9d. to 
Is. 2d. per cubic foot; hardwood from Is. 6d. to 2s.; wood work 
of a plough 17s.; of a cart L. 2, 4s.; of a pair of harrows 14s. ; 
of a pair of cart wheels L. 2, 3s. ; paling of two bars made from 
full-grown fir wood, with four stakes to the rood, of six yards, costs 
Is. 6d. per rood, and, when made from young wood, Is. per rood. 
The above prices are for the wood when sawn and ready to be re- 
moved from the plantation. The charge for sawing such timber 
is 4d. per rood for full-grown, and 3d. for young wood, and for 
putting it up and furnishing nails, 2d. per rood. Blacksmiths, fur- 
nishing iron, receive for shoeing a pair of horses, and keeping 
every thing connected with them, including carts, plough, and har- 
rows, in repair, L. 3 per annum. 

Breeds of Stock. — The breeds of sheep reared in the parish are the 
Leicester and Cheviot, and sometimes a cross between them. The 
rearing of sheep has met with considerable attention, and is now 
in a fair state of improvement. The cross breed is rather on 
the increase. The only breed of cattle reared by tenant far- 
mers is the short-horned. The small feuars and married farm- 
servants have frequently a mixed breed of milk cows, such as a 
cross between the Ayrshire and short-horned, or the Galloway and 



44 



ROXBURGIISIIlIiE. 



Highland breeds. A considerable number of small Highland cat- 
tle are annually wintered in the parish, and fattened the succeed- 
ing summer, and sold to the butchers. 

Husbandry. — The land in tillage is usually managed either in 
the four or five-shift rotation of cropping. In the four-shift rotation, 
the order is as follows : 1st, oats after grass ; 2d, fallow, or green 
crop of turnip or potatoes; 3d, wheat or other white crop ; and, 4th, 
grass for hay or pasture. In the five-shift rotation, the same order 
as above is observed, but with this difference, — that the grass is 
either allowed to lie two years before breaking up, and then one 
crop only of corn is taken before fallow, or a pea crop is introdu- 
ced after the first crop of oats, to be succeeded by a fallow  but, 
in the latter case, the land should be in a good state of cultivation. 

Drains are cut from two to four or more feet deep, according 
to the nature of the soil and the situation, and are filled with 
broken stones to within twelve inches of the surface, the undermost 
being always carefully laid in by the hand, and set on edge, or in 
the form of a conduit at bottom ; the rest are thrown in promis- 
cuously above them, and are broken and levelled on the top ; a slight 
covering of straw or turf is then put over them, and the earth is put 
above all. The expense of a drain three feet deep, exclusive of 
providing stones and straw, is about 9d. per rood on strong land, 
and from 7d. to 8d. on softer soils. The drains are made of no 
more breadth than to allow a man to work them properly, and, at 
the bottom, to allow a shovel spade to run along. The hill land 
is mostly surface drained in the customary manner. 

The duration of leases is generally nineteen years, and there 
cannot be a doubt that the present improved state of agriculture 
in this, as in other parts of Scotland, is to be attributed to the se- 
curity and the length of leases, more than to all other circumstances. 

The old and incommodious farm buildings are fast disappearing, 
and gi v ing place to others much more substantial and convenient. 
This is more particularly the case upon those farms which belong- 
to His Grace the Duke of Roxburghe, comprising fully half of the 
parish. 

Recent Improvements. — Great improvements have, within the last 
twelve or fifteen years, been made on the roads in this parish. 
During that period, the old roads, both public and private, have 
undergone substantial repairs ; and new roads have been opened 
up in various directions. They extend to about I8i miles. One 
of them, measuring about 3 miles, is turnpike. It was completed 



ROWDEN. 



45 



about ten years ago. It forms a part of the line of road which 
runs from Kelso by St BoswelPs Green to Selkirk, and affords 
an easy and excellent communication betwixt these places, 
through what were formerly the most unfrequented parts of this 
parish. All the others are parish roads, and are upheld solely 
by the conversion of statute labour. The assessment, for this 
purpose, was, for many years, at the rate of L. 3, and is now L. 2 
in the hundred pounds Scots ; but as there is an act of Parlia- 
ment to empower the heritors to make the principal line turnpike, 
the parish may be relieved from a great part of this burden. There 
are no toll-bars in the parish. 

Improvements Recommended. — Among the improvements in 
agriculture, which might still be made to a large extent, and with 
every prospect of the most advantageous result, we may mention 
the under-draining of land. This, however, would be best effect- 
ed by a mutual understanding between landlord and tenant. When 
left to the tenant alone, it absorbs a larger portion of his capital 
at the commencement of his lease, than can well be spared from 
other improvements, and, that being the case, he is either obliged 
to leave it, in a great measure, undone, or to do it superficially. 
On the other hand, as it must be allowed, that under-draining is 
the first improvement on wet-bottomed land, and is of permanent 
advantage to property, it is surely the landlord's interest to give 
liberal assistance.  

Marl abounds in the parish, and was about thirty years ago in 
general use ; but, in consequence of its having been considered too 
cold a substance for our climate and soil, and also of its having a 
tendency to retard the ripening process of the crops, and to pro- 
duce a coarse quality of grain, it has been almost laid aside for the 
last twenty years. Indeed, so decided is the preference that is now 
given to lime over marl, that the former, notwithstanding the great 
difficulty of procuring it, is used by some tenants who have the 
latter in their immediate neighbourhood, f 

"It may be here suggested, that that assistance might be given with the greatest 
effect, by the landlord's being at the expense of cutting and opening all drains, tak- 
ing care at the same time, to see that they xverc done in a proper manner ; and as 
Stones are readily found all over the parish, the tenant, on his part, should agree to 
furnish them, and complete all other parts of the work. As connected with this 
subject, it may be noticed, that proprietors and tenants occasionally labour under 
difficulties for want of a law obliging neighbouring proprietors to join in draining 
operations ; as it sometimes happens that the only outlet to swamps is through neigh- 
bouring lands, and the proprietors of such lands, from various causes, do not readily 
concur in such measures, although they would often prove highly beneficial to all 
parlies. 

f This fact leads us to express our anxious desire, that the rail-road which was

Bone-dust manure lias been applied extensively for the last two 
years to land in preparation for a turnip crop, and with success 
fully equal to expectation. In some cases, it is sown by a machine, 
but chiefly by the hand, along the hollow of the drills, previous to 
their being laid together for the reception of the seed. This 
manure is generally applied at the rate of two quarters per acre. 
It costs L. 1, Is. per quarter. It is found particularly convenient 
where dung is in short supply, especially on high lands at a dis- 
tance from the farm-yard ; and, by means of it, land in tillage can, 
in many cases, be kept in good order, and under a more profitable 
rotation, than in any other way. 

Obstacles to Improvement. — A very great obstacle to improvement 
is the distance from lime, — which is twenty-four miles from the 
nearest kilns. The prime cost and carriage to the land amounts 
to from 12s. to 13s. 6d. per cart-load of two bolls, Lothian mea- 
sure. Eight such cart-loads are considered a fair allowance per 
acre ; but, owing to its great expense, it is not often applied to that 
extent. Lime is, however, now generally in use in this quarter ; 
and, from the good effects produced by it, even when used in a 
smaller proportion, it is much to be regretted that there are not 
greater facilities in procuring it. It has been suggested, that, in 
cases where landlords are so fortunate as to secure judicious and 
enterprizing tenants, it would be to their mutual benefit were the 
landlords to pay the cost price at the kiln of what lime the tenants 
may lay upon their farms in a given time. Such arrangement 
would encourage and enable tenants to pay higher rents for their 
farms, and would also put it in their power to apply a larger por- 
tion of their capital to other beneficial purposes.  

some time ago proposed to be carried betwixt Dalkeith and Galashiels, and for which 
purpose the ground along Gala Water was surveyed, may soon be again taken up in 
a more decided manner, and carried into effect without delay. It is the opinion of 
competent judges, that such an undertaking would make a good return to the sub- 
scribers ; and there cannot be a doubt, that it would prove of incalculable advantage 
to an extensive and interesting farming district, by affording great facility in the con- 
veyance of corn, wool, coals, lime, bone-dust, timber, slates, and various art icles of 
merchandise ; while to the important and improving manufactories at Galashiels, 
Selkirk, Jedburgh, Hawick, &amp;c, such conveyance would give new health and vigour, 
by accelerating the transit of raw materials and manufactured goods. 

 To this plan it is objected, that it holds out an inducement to men without capi- 
tal to offer higher rents than can be drawn from the land, and, consequently, to drive 
the well-provided and more deserving tenant, who is willing to give a fair value for 
land, entirely out of the market. The first-mentioned class, it is said, having little to 
lose, have not much dread of an adverse turn of circumstances; while, on the Other 
hand, they are in hopes of deriving benefit from a favourable change of times, from 
the kindness of the landlord in making reductions of rent, or from over-cropping the 
land thus injudiciously put into their hands. This objection is worthy of serious con- 
sideration ; and we know not of any way by which the evil expressed by it can be avoid- 
ed or lessened, except by the landlords using all possible care in the selection of their 
tenants, and giving due encouragement to men of character and capital.

Among the obstacles to improvement in agriculture, the prac- 
tice common with proprietors, of protracting the reletting of their 
lands until within a short time of the outgoing tenants term of re- 
moval, deserves special notice. This practice, as may be easily 
conceived, often proves most embarrassing and injurious to the ten- 
ant. Owing to it, he is frequently kept, until within a few weeks 
of the close of his lease, in ignorance of a future home for himself 
and family, and of a place to which he may remove his stocking ; 
and he may feel himself compelled, at last, to enter upon a new 
engagement, on far more disadvantageous terms than he would have 
submitted to under different circumstances. The practice is also 
very impolitic on the part of the landlord ; for the tenant, as a mat- 
ter of course, looks only to the end of his contract, and makes ar- 
rangements to secure some return for his industry and outlay; but, 
in doing so, he cannot be expected to guard against the deteriora- 
tion of the soil, in the same manner he would have done if he had 
a longer interest in the possession secured to him. The con- 
sequence is, the lands are often seriously injured for years to 
come, which result might be prevented by the landlord's ascertain- 
ing the value of the property in due time, and letting it on a new 
lease at least twelve months before the expiration of the previous 
contract. Should the old tenant continue, he would not only pre- 
vent deterioration, but would immediately commence improvements 
on the farm, and, in cases of new tenants, both parties would feel 
it to be their interest to come to such mutual understanding as to 
prevent future inconvenience, as well as positive loss to all con- 
cerned. 

The last obstacle to improvement in agriculture we shall notice, 
is the frequent tampering with the laws which regulate the duty 
upon imported grain, wool, and other produce. Tenants complain, 
that, in place of being protected as they ought to be, their property 
is trifled with, and that, while things continue so, they cannot, with 
safety, undertake such improvements upon their farms as might be 
beneficial to themselves, to the landlord, and to the community. 

Enclosures, 8fc. — The greater part of the parish is enclosed. 
The fences are either stone walls or white thorn hedges, and are 
kept in good order, under the disadvantage of a great part of them 
being upheld entirely at the expense of the tenants. Fences so 
maintained are seldom kept in such a good state as when the ex- 
pense is borne mutually by landlord and tenant.

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Villages, §-c. — There are two villages in the parish. These are 
Bowden and Midlem or Midholm ; but we have no market-town 
or post-office. Melrose, a market and post-town, is distant about 
three miles from the village of Bowden; and Selkirk, also a market 
and post-town, about three and a-half miles from the village of 
Midlem. 

Means of Communication. — Through these towns, daily coaches 
run betwixt Edinburgh and Carlisle by the west or Selkirk road, and 
betwixt Edinburgh and Newcastle by the east or Melrose road, 
which passes within a mile and a-half of the village of Bowden. 
There are weekly markets for grain at Melrose on Saturdays, and 
at Selkirk on Wednesdays. At the latter place, the demand is 
generally greatest, owing to the district around being of a pastoral 
description. There are also weekly markets for grain, on a more 
extensive scale, at Jedburgh, Hawick, and Kelso, which places are 
respectively about twelve, thirteen, and fourteen miles distant from 
the parish ; but all these markets have this disadvantage, that a 
regular demand cannot be depended upon, the money is not pay- 
able on delivery, and the prices are generally as much below those 
of Dalkeith on the west, and Berwick on the east, as is equal to 
the expense of carriage to those distant markets. 

A carrier who resides in the village of Midlem goes and returns 
from Edinburgh weekly. He, as well as another carrier from Lil- 
liesleaf, passes through the village of Bowden. Besides these, there 
is also another, residing in the village of Bowden, who goes week- 
ly to Kelso, Selkirk, and Melrose. The rate of carriage is 2s. 
per cwt. from Edinburgh. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated on the east- 
ern extremity of the parish, but, being in the immediate neighbour- 
hood of the village of Bowden, and not more than three miles from 
Midlem, it cannot be said to be inconvenient to the greater pari 
of the population. Its distance from the western extremity of the 



BOWDEN. 



49 



parish is at most five miles. The time of the erection of the church 
is unknown ; but the oldest date on the building is 1666. At pre- 
sent the church is in a gOod state of repair. It affords accommo- 
dation to 380 sitters. There are no rents paid for church seating, 
and, although the congregation is usually accommodated in the 
portions allocated to large proprietors, yet it is obvious that the 
want of legal seating is an evil, which here, as well as in most other 
parishes, often occasions much inconvenience to the villagers and 
those having low valuations. 

The manse was formerly much decayed, but it was rebuilt on 
its old site in the year 1794, and it is now in a good state of re- 
pair. The extent of the glebe is from thirteen to fourteen acres, 
and its value about L. 1, 5s. per acre. The amount of the stipend 
is fifteen chalders, half barley and half oatmeal, Linlithgow mea- 
sure. 

There is a dissenting chapel in the village of Midlem belonging 
to the Associate Synod of Original Seceders. The minister's 
stipend was formerly paid from seat rents, but as there has been 
no settled pastor in the place for several years, it is impossible to 
ascertain what these might now amount to. 

The number of families attending the Established church is 113, 
and of individuals of all ages about 450. The number of fami- 
lies attending the Dissenting chapel is 74. Divine service at the 
Established church is well attended; it was so formerly in the 
dissenting meeting-house at Midlem, but, owing to there being no re- 
gular pastor, and to other local causes, that meeting-house is not 
so well attended now. The average number of communicants at 
the Established church is 260. 

The average yearly amount of ordinary church collections is L. 15; 
and of extraordinary L. 10. These last are chiefly made for defray- 
ing expenses incurred at Sabbath evening schools in the parish. 

Education. — There are two schools in the parish, both on the 
parochial establishment. The branches taught in these are Eng- 
lish, writing, and arithmetic, practical mathematics, French, Latin, 
Greek, geography, &amp;c. The salary of the Bowden, or principal 
schoolmaster, is L.30; and of the Midlem, L.21. The average 
number of scholars attending the former is 80 ; and the latter 45. 
The annual expense of a child's education is from 8s. to 16s.; and of 
a few pupils in the higher branches, it is about L. ], 4s. At both 
schools the children of paupers are taught gratis, and this of course 
diminishes the amount of school-fees considerably. The pro-

bable amount of school fees paid to both schoolmasters is L.45 
per annum. The teachers have the legal accommodations. There 
are no parts of the parish so distant from the schools as to prevent 
attendance, and the people have been always so much alive to the 
benefits of education, that there are none in the parish above six 
years of age who cannot read, and very few above that age who 
cannot write also. No doubt can be entertained that great be- 
nefits have resulted from the facilities of education in this parish ; 
but as these have been so long enjoyed, and so duly appreciated 
by the people, no recent change flowing from the above circum- 
stances can be traced in their morals. 

Literature. — There is a parochial library in the village of Bow- 
den ; and also a library connected with the Sabbath schools. 

Poor. — Except the ordinary church collections, and L. 900 
Scots, mortified by a member of the Roxburghe family for pious 
purposes, there is no other provision for the poor but the legal as- 
sessment, which is at the rate, on an average of ten years, of 3s. 
4d. per L. 100 Scots. The yearly amount of the assessments is 
about L. 123. The average number of poor on the roll for the 
same period is 17, and the weekly allowance of each 2s. 4d. Ge- 
nerally speaking, the poor of this parish are slow in seeking paro- 
chial relief ; yet, when once upon the roll, it is not observed that 
they consider the circumstance degrading. Instances to the con- 
trary, highly honourable to individuals, are now and then met with ; 
but these, it must be confessed, are of rare occurrence. 

Alehouses. — There are three alehouses in the parish; one of 
these is in the village of Bowden, and the other two in Midlem. 
The community would suffer no loss by their number being lessened. 

Fuel. — The fuel used in this parish consists of coal brought from 
Mid-Lothian, at the rate of from Is. Id. to Is. 3d. per cwt. on deli- 
very, — also of peat, and the thinnings of plantations. The former 
costs at Midlem 2s. 3d., and at Bowden 4s. per single horse cart-load, 
including carriage; and the latter from 3s. 6d. to 7s. per cart-load, 
including carriage, according to the size of the wood, and its dis- 
tance from the villages.

PRESBYTERY OF SELKIRK, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. GEORGE THOMSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name.— In the old orthography the name is written Mull or 
Mailross, Mull or Moel signifying in Gaelic hare, and ross a pro- 
montory. The name is applicable to the peninsula formed by the 
Tweed, which is still called Old Melrose, and which, although in its 
present state one of the most delightful residences imaginable, might 
well be termed the bare promontory, when divested of its present 
advantages. The religious Culdees who settled in this spot from 
Iona, so early as the beginning of the seventh century, may have 
given the name to this place, if it had not been bestowed earlier 
by the Celtic population. When the religious community of Old 
Melrose had fallen into decay, and agreat monastery was founded in 
a more favourable situation farther up the river, the name of Mel- 
rose, interesting from the sacred associations connected with it, was 
given to the more recent religious establishment. Subsequently it 
was transferred to the adjoining village, and to the parish in which it 
stands. This etymology is deducible from history of the most au- 
thentic nature.  

Extent, Boundaries.— The parish of Melrose is one of the most 
extensive in the county. Its length, from the top of the middle- 
most of the Eildon Hills to Upper Blainslie, is 10 miles. Its breadth, 
from the banks of the Gala to those of the Leader, is upon an 
average 4±. Its superficial extent is 45 square miles. Its boun- 
daries are, south, the parishes of St Boswell and Bowden ; north, 
the parish of Lauder ; east, the parishes of Mertoun and Earls- 
toun, from which it is separated by the Tweed and Leader; and 
west, those of Galashiels and Stow, from which it is separated by 
the Gala. Its figure is an irregular oblong, rounded at its northern 
extremity, where it is widest, and forming an excrescence at the 

• In the armorial hearings of Melrose, preserved in the west end of the ahbey, 
and in the front of the town-house, there are the figures of a mallet  Scotch, a mctt, 
and a rose. I hese emblems are evidently a pun upon the name of the place, and 
seem to prove the antiquity of the change in its orthography, from Mullross to Mel- 
rose.

north-west angle of Roxburghshire, where that county separates 
Selkirkshire from Berwickshire, and marches with Mid- Lothian. 

Topographical Appearances. — The principal high-grounds are 
the Eildon Hills on the south border of the parish, at the foot of 
which the village of Melrose is beautifully situated. Rising with 
a triple summit, and an abrupt irregular acclivity on the right bank 
of the Tweed, they are finely contrasted with the smooth surface, 
and uniform height of the Gattonside Hills, which, with their con- 
tinuation on the Langlee and Ladhope heights, form a ridge ex- 
tending from the Leader to the Gala. To the north of this long 
ridge, the parish, for about two-thirds of its extent, and compre- 
hending all the hilly country between these rivers, maintains a con- 
siderable elevation above the level of the sea, and of the Melrose 
valley. It is from the north that the Eildon Hills are seen to most 
advantage, where the two principal summits only being visible, their 
proportions appear most beautiful, and their elevation above the 
level of the country, magnificent : and in winter, when the sun 
rises immediately behind them, one of the most splendid of moun- 
tain phenomena may be seen in perfection in the neighbourhood 
of Melrose, — the black opaque mass of the hills cutting against 
the bright gleaming sky. On the south, their elevation appears less 
considerable, but the three hills are seen in a line,— their bare 
summits contrasting with the richness of the surrounding country. 
The view from the top of the Eildons is crowded with interesting 
objects. To the north are seen the windings of the Tweed through 
the valley of Melrose, its banks studded with villas and villages, 
the south front of the abbey distinctly and beautifully appearing 
amid unbosoming wood, and the long mountain ridge which bounds 
the valley on the north, flanked, on the one hand, by the Meiglot, 
and, on the other hand, by the Coldigknow,— beyond which the view 
is prolonged in pastoral wildness to the distant heights of Lam- 
mermoor, Soltra, and Yarrow braes. To the south, the whole 
level expanse of richly cultivated, but thinly wooded Tiviotdale, 
is spread out before the eye, and bounding the view appears the 
long blue line of the Cheviots, losing itself in distance toward the 
west, and having at its eastern extremity three small conical emi- 
nences, one of which is Flodden Hill. 

Q e0 l 0 jy.—\ n the Eildons, clinkstone appears in many places ; 
and in some places, where uncovered by vegetable mould, they seem 
to consist of huge heaps of small thin oblongular splinters without 
any cohesion, and free from sand or any earthy mixture. On lie

side of one of them, but within the parish of Bowden, a beautiful 
columnar porphyry has lately been disclosed. West from Mel- 
rose is the Quarry Hill, a huge mass of a kind of conglomerate rock, 
having much clay imbedded in it, on which the frost has great 
influence. Being durable and easily wrought, it is much used in 
building. Over all the northern and western part of the parish 
greywacke prevails, dipping toward the north-east. Abbotsford 
is built of this kind of stone, and it is found in the bed of the 
Tweed, throughout the whole course of the Allan, and in all 
the detached rocks which appear at intervals in the hilly country. 
To the south-east of the Eildons, the Dryburgh sandstone begins. 
It is first disposed in thin layers of a coarse red colour; and these 
are found to overlay other sandstone strata of greater breadth, and 
of a finer colour. 

The soil of the parish, as described in the last Statistical Ac- 
count, is various. In the south it is generally a strong clay, excel- 
lently adapted for wheat. The banks of the Tweed are a fine 
light dry soil, fit for all kinds of grain. In the northern parts of 
the parish the soil is of three kinds, 1st, a light earth mixed with 
sand upon a gravelly bottom ; 2dly, a strong clay upon a till full 
of springs, and very wet; 3dly, moss. The moss is frequently 
found to overlay marl of the finest quality. 

Hydrography. — There are four considerable streams in this pa- 
rish. The Tweed, and three tributaries which it receives from the 
north ; the Gala, the Allan, and the Leader. The Gala at the 
western, and the Leader at the eastern, extremity of the parish, are 
five miles distant where they join the Tweed. Two miles below 
the Gala, the Allan issues from a fine opening in the Langlee 
heights, dividing the Long mountain ridge which forms the south- 
ern boundary of the hilly country. It is a beautiful little stream, 
nearly concealed in many places by overhanging woods, and its 
course, five miles in length, is all within the parish. The Tweed 
enters the parish at Gala foot, having formed its boundary with 
the Galashiels parish for two miles higher up. After receiving the 
Leader, it becomes its boundary with the parish of Mertoun, as 
far as Dryburgh. 

The valley of Melrose must have been a noble lake at some re- 
mote period, the Tweed entering it by a narrow inlet, across which 
Melrose Bridge is thrown, and leaving it by a narrow outlet at 
Tweedwood, before the formation of which, the whole space in- 
closed by the Eildon and Gattonside Hills must have been a con-

tinued sheet of water. A substratum of water sand, dense or pene- 
trable by the spade, pure or gravelly, is always met with in digging 
a few feet below the surface. At a comparatively recent period, 
less than two centuries ago, the course of the Tweed seems to 
have been on the south side of the valley. A fine rich flat, now on 
the south side of the river, is called Gattonside-haugh, and its feu- 
dal tenures shew that it once actually formed a part of the Gat- 
tonside lands, which are on the north side of the river. In these 
tenures a right is retained to an ancient church- way, severed by the 
Tweed, along which the inhabitants used to pass of old to the 
Catholic service in the abbey. Near the village of Newstead, the 
old channel of the river is beautifully marked ; and what was for- 
merly a deep pool and perilous eddy, across which Claverhouse is 
said to have been ferried, is now a fine meadow, but still continues 
to be called the " wheel." The change in the course of the 
Tweed seems to have been aided by human industry, as a strong 
embankment is necessary to prevent it from resuming its old do- 
main. 

Meteorology. — The most remarkable feature in the meteorology of 
this part of the country is its fogs, which frequently occur in beau- 
tifully picturesque forms. Sometimes they are seen lying in inde- 
pendent fleeces upon the sides of the uplands, — sometimes creep- 
ing up the channel of the Tweed, and slowly dividing into the di- 
verging valleys. Viewed from the south side of the Eildons, the 
whole surface of Tiviotdale appears one continued sheet of fog, 
above which is seen the top of Ruberslaw, and the long stalk of the 
Waterloo pillar, — while a clear sky is overhead, and a bright sun il- 
luminating the surface of the sea. 

In the valley of Melrose, sheltered as it is by the surrounding 
high grounds, the climate is singularly mild. The upland parts 
of the parish are in winter swept by tremendous northern gales, 
against which they have no natural shelter. But in every place, 
both in the high and low ground, the parish is healthy, and free 
from every kind of unwholesome miasma. The ague, which was 
formerly very prevalent, owing to the damp exhalations of undrain- 
ed marsh, has entirely disappeared,— not a single instance of this 
malady is met with by any medical practitioner. Epidemic fe- 
vers of the typhus kind sometimes occur in the villages, but they 
arc rare, and not very destructive. The most common distempers 
of this district seem to be rheumatism and consumption.

II. — Civil History. 

Accounts of the Parish. — The ancient accounts of the history 
of the parish are, the Chronicle of Mailross, which was kept in the 
monastery, in monkish Latin, and which, beginning with the year 
735, ends in 1270 ; the first part being only an abridgement of 
previous history, intended to serve as an introduction to the chro- 
nicle, properly so called; — the Chartulary of Melrose, compre- 
hending the munificent grants and benefactions, royal and private, 
with which the abbey was from time to time enriched ; — and the 
accounts of various m6nkish historians, of whom Bede is the chief. 
The modern accounts are Redpath's Border History ; Morton's 
Monastic Annals of Tiviotdale ; a history of the parish of Mel- 
rose by Milne, one of its former ministers, and another by Bower, 
the present custodier of the abbey. 

Parochial Registers. — The only manuscript accounts of the his- 
tory of the parish known to the writer are contained in the paro- 
chial registers, which begin in 1630, and are continued down to 
the present day, with a single break of four years between 1686-90. 
This interval, corresponding with the years of persecution, seems 
to indicate the troubles of the time, of which, however, there is no 
mention made, -j- 

The number of persons who appear by the list of penitents to 
have incurred church censure in that age is incredible, — far ex- 
ceeding the average of the present day, when the population is 
nearly trebled. How is this to be accounted for and reconciled 

Milne, though a man of respectable talent and research, seems to have had the 
foible of mistaking for Roman encampments old sheep fields, e. g. his two Castra ex- 
ploratorum. What he calls a Roman encampment on the top'of the Eildons, may 
easily have been a border fastness, to which the cattle of the neighbourhood might be 
driven on the approach of the enemy; for there are no distinct indications observable 
from which it can be inferred that it was Roman, and his Roman road across Bowden 
moor is proven, by a curious old charter lately discovered, to have been a boundary 
line between the adjoining properties of the Kelso and the Melrose monastery. 

f The oldest part of these registers records very particularly the transactions of 
each week, giving both the preacher's name and the subject on which he spoke, with 
enormous weekly lists of penitents who were subjected to the presbyterian penance. 
The oldest part of them also contains many curious notices of the public events of the 
period, which arc highly interesting and worthy of attention, as they serve to shew the 
impression which historical events of importance made upon the public mind at the 
tune they occurred. For example, an attempt of a detachment of the army of 
Charles the First upon the insurgent depot at Dunse in the course of that monarch's 
second Scottish campaign,. with the subsequent blowing up of Uunglass House, is thus 
noticed. _00/A August, 1640.—" Mr William Wilkie preached, but, being interrupt- 
ed at nudd sermon, because of the Inglishmeii that came from Berwick to Dunse, 
thinking to came away our cannon, powder, and lead with them ; but, blessed be God, 
they got the foyle and returned with shame, being beat back with a few. But upon 
the same night ane pityful] accident there was at Dunglass, where my Lord Had- 
dington of worthie mcmorie, with many others, was betrayed with powder, so that 
the house was blown up, and thev were smoored in the close ; the lyke whereof was 
never heard in Scotland."

with the zeal and piety of our forefathers, unless by supposing that 
the age in general was greatly less enlightened and less moral than 
the present. It is more easy to fighf and die for God, than to 
live a well regulated life in obedience to His law.  

Historical Notices. — The history of this parish is coeval with the 
first introduction of Christianity among the Saxon population of 
this part of the country in 640. It is related by Bede, who lived 
in Northumberland, and during the seventh century, that Oswald, 
the Saxon King of Northumberland, whose dominions comprehend- 
ed the whole of the eastern part of Scotland south of the Forth, 
was converted to Christianity by Culdees, from Iona, whom he met 
with when an exile from his country, among the Picts north of the 
Forth; that, on being restored to his country, and eventually raised 
to the throne, he became anxious to Christianize his subjects, and 
with this view prevailed on a number of Culdees to visit his king- 
dom as missionaries, one of whom, named Aidan, he made bishop 
of Lindisfarne, — and that he built churches and planted mis- 
sions at Old Melrose in this parish, and in various other places 
of his dominions. Old Melrose, a peninsula nearly surround- 
ed by the Tweed, which is overhung on the farther side by its 
lofty precipitous banks, is strongly guarded by natural defences 
on every quarter except the south, where it has an easy communi- 
cation with the country, and where a wall, seen by Milne, was 
drawn across the narrow isthmus. It is a most delightful place of 
residence. The limited central space of the peninsula is high 
raised above the encircling river, and keeps the general level of the 
adjoining country, the ground descending all round with a steep 
but smooth unbroken declivity, finely contrasting with the abrupt- 
ness of the opposite banks, to a circular grassy plain of pleasing 
seclusion, — the scene, perhaps, of the devout meditations of St 
Cuthbert, and of the shivering penances of Drythelme. Uniting, 
therefore, the advantages of easy defence and delightful retire- 
ment, it seems to have been judiciously chosen for the residence 
of a religious community in a barbarous age. The religious com- 

 It deserves to be mentioned as a curious trait of the manners of the period in 
question, that it was then common for people of the lowest rank to appear with a 
sword at their side when in full dress,— and it is related by an aged person, whose 
nrandfather was present on the occasion, that Mr Wilson, who was ordained minister 
of this parish in 1G90, on the removal of the English curate, and whose memory is 
still revered, began his first diet of examination, by seizing on these weapons and 
breaking them, maintaining, that the unnecessary appearance of them in the house of 
God was aprofanation. The number of swords which thepeople still have in their pus- 
session, covered with rust, and each having " eaten of its sheath two handful," is im- 
mense Pcrcant nibiginc.

munity of Old Melrose, at the head of which was placed one of 
Aidan's twelve Saxon pupils, seems to have remained unmolest- 
ed for about 200 years ; during which period it produced many 
who figured as saints in the Roman calendar, among whom oc- 
cur the names of St Cuthbert and St Boswell. Of these, the 
former, who became Bishop of Lindisfarne, was really eminent; 
the latter is chiefly interesting to us from his having given his name 
to the neighbouring parish of St Boswells, the public worship of 
which continued to be carried on after the Reformation in a chapel 
dedicated to this saint, until the stones of its principal quadrangle 
were employed in the building of the present parish church, which 
seems to have been the general practice after the overthrow of po- 
pery; for almost all the old and unrenewed parish churches in 
this part of the country seem to be the identical places of worship 
which were used in Catholic times. And from architectural indi- 
cations which they still exhibit, they appear to have consisted of a 
large oblong quadrangle, communicating through an ornamented 
archway with a smaller apartment called the Queer, which pro- 
jected from one of its ends, and which was probably used, like the 
continental baptistry, for marriages, baptisms, petite masses, &amp;c. 
when a small concourse of people would attend. After the Refor- 
mation, the queer generally became the burial aisle of the principal 
proprietor, the communication with the interior being built up ; or it 
was demolished, leaving traces of its ornamented archway ; or it dis- 
appeared entirely, the church having been elongated in the direc- 
tion of where it stood, in which case nothing is observable but the 
coarse recent addition. The queer of the demolished chapel of 
St Boswells remained standing within the last forty years. These 
excursive remarks, derived from a personal observation of many 
parishes, must be forgiven. 

In the year 839, when the Scottish power gained a permanent 
ascendancy over the Saxon, and the country was wasted as far 
south as the Tweed, the peninsula of Old Melrose was taken 
by Kenneth II., and the buildings of the monastery destroyed. 
From this disaster it never seems to have recovered. It afterwards 
became the temporary residence of a small party of monks from 
Girwy, but it eventually dwindled down into a chapel dedicated to 
St Cuthbert, which had the privilege of a sanctuary ; and a road- 
way leading to it, still called either from Girwy or Girth, a sanc-

tuary, the Girthgate, may be traced over the moorlands, in which 
stand the ruined towers of Colmslie and Hillslop. 

It appears from tradition, that, during the long interval between 
the decline of the Old Melrose and the rise of the New, there was 
another sacred edifice erected midway between them in a field 
which still retains the name of the Red Abbey Stead. It was pro- 
bably called the Red Abbey from the colour of the stone with 
which it was built, which, specimens that have been dug up seem 
to identify with the narrow upper strata of the Dryburgh sandstone, 
which are of a coarse red colour, every way inferior to the fine 
broad sandstone strata which they overlay, and out of which was 
built the famous Abbey of Melrose, now in ruins. The buildings 
of the one abbey seems to- have led to the discovery of finer ma- 
terials for the building of the other ; and the geology of the country 
thus enables us to ascertain the relative antiquity of the two edi- 
fices, — of the former of which no records whatever remain. Could 
we suppose that it was a rebuilding on a new site of the chapel of 
St Cuthbert, it would account for the name of the neighbouring 
village of Newstead. 

Melrose Abbey. — In 1136, 500 years after the foundation, and 
300 years after the destruction of the Old Melrose, the famous 
abbey and monastery, which is still admired in ruins hard by the 
present village of Melrose, is said to have been founded by David I. 
Becoming the residence of a community of Cistertian monks who 
were brought from Rievalle, and whose Order was then first intro- 
duced into Scotland, it was, according to the general practice 
of Cistertians, dedicated to their patron saint the Virgin Mary. 
The site of this more recent establishment, to which the name of 
Melrose, venerable from its sacred antiquity, was transferred, is 
three miles further west than the river peninsula on which the old 
and original Melrose stood, near the foot of the Eildons, and about 
a quarter of a mile south of the Tweed, — occupying the finest part 
of the lovely valley which is inclosed between the Eildon and Gat- 
tonside heights. It is stated by Milne, that the adjoining village 
existed before the building of the abbey, and that it had the name 
of Fordle ; and it is worthy of remark, that the whole of the old 
tenements above what is still called the Bow, the south entrance 
gate to the monastery ground, are described in their tide-deeds as 
belonging to the village of Little Fordle. The original name of 
the previously existing village, therefore, must have been Lit lie 
Fordle, which seems to be a Saxon diminutive, derived, in all like-

lihood, from the passage of a small brook flowing across the road 
at the eastern entrance of the village, and contrasting with the 
neiohbourinff ford of larger dimensions in the Tweed. 

Of the ruins of Melrose Abbey, which have been so frequently 
and so well described, both in poetry and prose, it is unnecessary 
to say much. The ground plan, according to the general Ro- 
mish practice, is in the form of a rectangular cross. The nave, 
which lies due east and west, is in length 258 feet, and in breadth 
79 feet; and at the distance of 50 feet from the eastern extremity, 
it is intersected at right angles by the transept, which is in length 
130 feet, and in breadth 44. To the West of the transept there 
are two magnificent rows of pillars ranged along the north and 
south side of the nave, which form two passages leading into the 
interior, where it is most spacious, the intersection of the transept 
and nave. The passage on the north side is bounded by a blind 
wall ; that on the south, which is broader and more magnificent, 
opens into a long series of aisles, intended, perhaps, to serve as con- 
fessionals, private chapels, baptistries, or queers, each highly or- 
namented, and terminated by a splendid Gothic window. Upon 
the north side of the building, indications are observable on the 
outer wall, of a large quadrangular cloister which, beginning at the 
transept, had extended 150 feet west, and also of a spacious ar- 
cade or piazza, with which it had been surrounded. The habita- 
tions of the monks, as is said and confirmed by architectural indi- 
cations and foundations which have been dug up, were ranged along 
the east, west, and north walls of the cloister, completely secluded 
from the outer world, and concealed behind their splendid southern 
screen, the majestic pile of the abbey, which might have ex- 
tended as far beyond the quadrangle in the west as it does in the 
east. 

Such seems to have been the general outlines of this famous 
building, so far as they can be traced in its present dismantled 
state. The architecture is the finest Gothic, belonging evidently 
to an age when the art, in all its departments, and that style of 
building in particular, had arrived at the highest perfection. In 
the magnitude of its proportions, Melrose Abbey is inferior to many 
works of its kind,— the dimensions of York Minster being nearly 
double ; but it has seldom been surpassed, or even equalled, in the 
fineness of the sculpture, the exquisite finishing of its most minute 
embellishments, and the majestic beauty so suitable to a sacred 
edifice, which appears in the whole. How came so fine a building,

ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



it is natural to inquire, to be erected in such a site, and in an age 
so early and so rude as the twelfth century  David was a " sore 
saint to the crown," rather from his enormous grants of land than 
from the amount of pecuniary capital which he had it in his power 
to sink unproductively ; and why should he. have chosen to place 
the finest building of which the nation has ever had to boast so far 
from the heart of his kingdom, and so near a hostile frontier  It 
is also worthy of remark, that the style of the architecture is ascer- 
tained to belong to a later age than that of David ; that the build- 
ings which David did erect on this site are said to have been finish- 
ed in ten years ; and that 'there are architectural indications which 
distinctly show that the Abbey, the main building now existing in 
ruins, was unfinished when destroyed 500 years after his day. There 
are appearances of temporary finishing, that the work might be 
afterwards resumed and carried forward towards completion. The 
character of the monastic orders in general, and that of the Cis- 
tertians in particular, seem to afford the best explanation of the 
difficulty which can be given. The Cistertians, besides being strict 
in their monastic discipline, had the wisdom to inculcate industry 
upon their brethren as a virtue, and as a preservative from vice ; 
on which account, they were also great patrons and promoters of 
learning and the fine arts. Is it not probable, then, that multi- 
tudes of the resident monks would employ themselves in what 
might be deemed the pious work of rearing and embellishing so 
sacred an edifice ; that the masterly pieces of sculpture which adorn 
its windows, walls, pinnacles, capitals, keystones, &amp;c. were executed 
by their own hands ; and that the whole work, instead of being 
produced by a single effort of David, which would have been be- 
yond his means and the architectural talent which he could have 
commanded, however ample his means had been, was the result of 
a long-continued effort of the religious community which he esta- 
blished, aided by the princely revenues with which it was endowed, 
the munificent benefactions it was continually receiving, and the 
architectural talent of the whole Romish church which would be 
at his command. The monastic orders are known to have been 
ambitious of adorning their habitations with great architectural 
works, which were frequently begun on a scale of magnificence 
vastly beyond their means, and which the labours of several gene- 
rations were required to complete. The Scottish monarch, in 1 136, 
seems to have merely founded and endowed the monastery, build- 
ing suitable accommodations for its inmates, and a humbler edifice,

perhaps, for their worship. The magnificent pile of building which 
came in time to cover the south front of the monastic quadrangle, 
may justly be regarded as a subsequent addition, — as the fruit of the 
zeal, industry, and genius of the indefatigable Cistertians, exerted 
during a period of five centuries. 

Antiquities. — As might have been expected in the vicinity of 
such an establishment, there are memorials of the Catholic times 
in every quarter. There is a cross in the centre of the village of 
Melrose, near the south entrance of the monastery, which has a 
quarter of an acre of land to maintain it jailed the " Corse Rig." 
The Popish emblem on the top, however, was supplanted by the 
crest of the Haddington arms so early as 1604. The name of the 
High Cross marks the site of another, which stood near the Darn- 
wick road, half a mile west, where the pinnacles of St Mary's cen- 
tral tower first become visible. There are in the lintels, or ap- 
pearing in the plaster of the walls of some of the houses, stones 
sculptured with the interlacing, i. h. s. Jesus Hominum Salvator, 
and other Popish devices. There are such names of places as 
Priors' Wood, Cloister Close, Abbots and Monks' Ford ; and our 
principal springs still retain the names of Romish saints, such as 
St Mary's, St William's, St Helen's, and St Dunstan's. The in- 
habitants are such zealous Protestants, that many of them com- 
plained that they " could neither get a night's rest nor day's ease 
with the passing of the Catholic bill," so that it may truly be said, 
every thing around us is Catholic, " save the spirit of man." 

The tumulus upon the side of the Eildons mentioned by Milne, 
and called by the people the Bourjo, is worthy of attention. It 
is evidently artificial, of great magnitude, and by tradition the site 
of a pagan altar. The road leading to it is called the Haxalgate, 
and the ravine through which it passes the Haxalgate-heugh. 
Compare with this the following passage from the thirteenth chap- 
ter of the third volume of the Pirate : " If the belief of those is 
true," says the author while speaking of a Druidical circle, " who 
assign these singular monuments exclusively to the Druids, Minna 
might have seemed the Haxa or high priestess of the order." 
It is at least a striking circumstance, that the name of this pagan 
official should be found in the way leading to a reputed pagan altar. 
The place is still regarded by the people with interest ; and they 
have been in the habit of pointing out to each succeeding minister 
as the identical spot where their forefathers " were wont to bow the

knee to Baal, and to put their sacrifices into earthern vessels," the 
tradition mingling with the knowledge of a better faith. 

A stone with a Latin inscription, which was lately dug up in 
this parish, and which is now in the possession of the family of 
Drygrange, seems to have formed a part of a Roman altar. In the 
inscription it is dedicated to the god Silvanus by Curius Domi- 
tianus of the Twentieth Legion, " pro salute sua et suorum." The 
Romans having never been so far north before Domitian nor after 
Severus, the inscription must belong to the second century. 
The country must have been a forest, else why the dedication to 
Silvanus  and unhealthy, else why the expression " pro salute sua 
et suorum."  

Modern Buildings. — In the vicinity of the Tweed, and within 
the bounds of this parish, there are about fifteen villas and consi- 
derable mansion-houses, of which Abbotsford in the west is not 
less famous for its present, than, in the east, Old Melrose is for its 
ancient glory. The materials employed in building are sandstone 
from Dryburgh, Belses, and Sprouston, the coarse puddingstone 
of the neighbouring quarry-hill, and the Greywacke, which is wide- 
ly diffused over the country. There are within the parish four 
corn mills ; of these the two principal are upon a lead said to be 
of monastic antiquity, which, leaving the Tweed above Melrose, 
returns to it below Newstead, insulating a rich flat called the Ana.  

III. — Population. 
There are no accounts of the state of the population of this pa- 
rish before the census of 1801. There are in the parochial re- 
gisters some tables of births of an earlier date ; but the result is 
so surprisingly irregular, that it affords no certain data for drawing 
an inference. The amount of the population was found to be 

In 1801, - - 2654 

1811, - 3132 

1821, - - 3525 

At the time of the census in 1831, the amount of the popu- 

 The high and exposed situation of the place where the stone was discovered 
seems to indicate that at the time at which such a spot was chosen for a Roman mi- 
litary post, the surface of the country must have been very different from what it 
now is, when many a better station might be found not commanded from the neigh- 
bouring heights by any weapon used in ancient warfare. Was the vale of Melrose a 
lake in the second century, as hydrograpliic.il appearances show that it must have been 
before the formation of the narrow outlet at Tweedwood ; or an unwholesome 
swampy forest, like those of the American wastes, where the Roman soldier would 
sink in mud to the knee whilst forcing his way through the loathsome underwood, 
and the anie, the once prevailing disease of the country, would subdue his strength 
and quench his ardour  With this hypothetical, it is curious to compare the actual 
state of the country, richly cultivated, healthful, and populous, covered over with 
villas, villages, and corn fields, the effect of human industry and time.

lation was found to have increased to 4339, of which number 
2096 were males, and 2243 females. This great increase of po- 
pulation is to be ascribed to three causes, — agricultural improve- 
ments, and the extensive breaking up of the waste grounds which 
followed the great rise in the price of grain during the war ; the 
great increase of the manufacturing population upon the Gala; and 
the numerous families having independent fortunes that have chosen 
the neighbourhood for a place of residence, attracted by the amenity 
of the situation. The manufactures of Galashiels have been con- 
tinually upon the increase, notwithstanding' the pressure of the times; 
and this, along with the increased amount of the resident wealth, 
more than counterbalances the diminution of the population by emi- 
gration, which has of late years been uncommonly great. 

The number of the population who reside in towns is - _ 2764

N. B. — Every marriage is recorded, the parties being anxious', 
from a regard to decorum, to pay a scrupulous attention to all ob- 
servances ; but in the registration of the births and deaths there 
is great irregularity. 

The number of individuals and of families of independent for- 
tune, at present residing in the parish, is 18. The number of pro- 
prietors of land, of the yearly value of L. 50 and upwards, is 50. 
The number of families is 906 ; and it appears that the proportion 

of recorded births to the recorded marriages is only 64 to 37, 

giving If children to each family. This is to be ascribed to the 
fact above stated, that every marriage is recorded, but that many 
of the births are not.

Characters, Habits, c. of the People.— The people, without being- 
distinguished from their countrymen by any personal peculi arities, 
may be described as being generally a stout, muscular, well-formed 
race, hardy and patient of fatigue, having among them many in- 
stances of great stature and strength. In so numerous a popula- 



04 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



tion, there are only 2 persons insane ; 3 fatuous; 2 blind ; and 1 deaf 
and dumb. 

The dialect spoken is distinguishable, although it does not differ 
much, from that of the west coast used by Burns. The finest 
specimens of it in spirit, characteristic features, and idiom, are to 
be found in the dialogue of those of the Waverley Novels, where 
the scene is laid at or near the Scottish border. There are in- 
stances in which that author admits an old word, not at present in 
general use ; and the reading habits of the people have insensibly 
led them to incorporate with their conversational style much of the 
classical language of the country. 

The dress of the common people, from which every peculiarity 
has long ago disappeared, is always becoming, and in good repair ; 
and on particular occasions, when they appear in their " Sunday's 
best," it differs little from that of the upper classes. For some 
years past, they seem to have been rather in straitened circum- 
stances, owing to the low rate of wages, and the scarcity of work ; 
but by industry, temperate habits, and frugal management, they 
make a shift to maintain themselves and their families comfortably ; 
and there are few of them who have not saved a sum of money, 
upon which they can draw in any emergency. It may be truly 
said, that they are an intellectual, moral, and religious people ; and 
that, through the excellent education which they universally receive, 
and their natural capabilities, they are becoming more so every day. 

Smuggling and pawnbroking are unknown. The game laws, to 
the credit of the proprietors be it spoken, are very leniently en- 
forced. The parties seem to be upon honour with each other, — 
the one not poaching beyond a certain extent ; the other not push- 
ing the enforcement of the law so far as persecution. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy.— To the north of the Tweed 
there are in this parish about 11,500 acres, either cultivated, or 
occasionally in tillage ; and about 7600, which remain continually 
in pasture. The land to the south of the Tweed, which amounts 
to about a third part of the whole parish, is all cultivated, except 
the wide base of the Eildon Hills, and a stripe of moorland stretch- 
ing from them towards the west. There are distinct traces of an- 
cient culture upon the sides of the Eildons, and in the adjoining 
moorland, in ground which at present none would think of subject- 
ing to the plough. Are we to conclude that the soil of these 
places was different in ancient times from what it is at present  



MELROSE. 05 

It is more probable that the good soils, mismanaged by husband- 
men ignorant of the principles of agriculture, and exhausted by 
incessant cropping, would be found less productive than the worst 
land when new broken up ; and that, in the dreadful famines to 
which Scotland in " its warrior day " was liable, the culture of 
grain, under the most unfavourable circumstances, would pay. The 
number of acres which at present might be added with advantage 
to the cultivated land cannot be ascertained ; but whenever, in the 
wild country, the farmer has a long lease, he generally makes dis- 
coveries of pieces of good soil, by the culture of which he is well 
repaid. Much of the land subjected to the plough during the war 
prices of the grain has been thrown back into pasture ; and much 
that was even then left in pasture has since been broken up, so that, 
through the judicious enterprise of able agriculturists, the parish 
seems in the way of being brought into the best possible state for 
profitably employing and drawing forth the virtues of the different 
soils. An undivided common, we may add, is unknown. A por- 
tion of ground in this neighbourhood, of about seven acres, well 
worthy of this name, after having been for ages an ugly morass, 
was lately drained, cultivated, and sold for L. 700, which was dis- 
tributed among the different tenementors who had claims upon it 
in sums of L. 30 each. The draining cost them 10s. a-head, and 
was at first pronounced « a haver." Of this spirited undertaking 
Sir Walter Scott was the first suggester. 

The number of acres under wood is not less than 1200, and 
there is no natural wood except a few straggling trees, chiefly 
birches, at Torwoodlee and Colmslie Hill. A few years ago, the 
custom was to plant a proportion of oak, ash, elm, sycamore, and 
beech ; but at present larch and-oak are the rage, and a slight ad- 
mixture of other trees. In twenty years, the thinnings of the larch 
defray the whole expense of plantation,— the value of the ground 
for pasture is doubled,— and the hard-wood with the standing 
larches far exceeds the value of the ground on which it grows. 
With respect to the management of the trees, it is only necessary 
to state, that the greatest attention is paid to thinning, felling, and 
pruning ; and that in these, and all the other operations of plant- 
ing, the most approved modes are followed. 

Rent of Land.— The average rent of arable land in the parish 
is 15s. per acre ; some lands being above L. 4, and others not ex- 
ceeding 5s. The average rent of grazing is L. 4 a-year per ox or 
cow ; of pasturing, 7s. a-year per ewe or full-grown sheep. 

ROXBURGH. v

ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



Rate of Wages. — The rate of labour, winter and summer, for the 
different kinds of farm-labourers and country artisans, is upon an 
average, 10s. per week. Superior workmen in the carpenter line 
receive 2s. 6d. per day, — in the smith line, 14s. per week. The 
rate of masonry, the best work, and the standard thickness of two 
feet, is L. 6 per square rood. 

Breeds of Stock. — The common breeds of sheep in the parish 
are Leicester, Cheviot, half-bred and black-faced. The common 
breeds of cattle are the Teeswater, Ayrshire, and Highland 
kyloe, with a small admixture of other breeds which a farmer may 
meet with, and be led to purchase at market. 

The farm-buildings of the parish are generally spacious, com- 
modious, and substantial. The inclosures are, for the infield and 
arable land, thorn quick hedges, — for the outfield and pastoral, 
stone dikes. 

Fisheries. — The fisheries of the Tweed, which ought to abound 
in salmon, have dwindled down into nothing in this neighbourhood. 
The few salmon which escape from the Berwick nettings are late 
in the season before they arrive, when they have in a great mea- 
sure lost their value, and the close-time has set in. At this, the 
inhabitants on the banks of the Tweed and its tributaries feel much 
aggrieved. They complain that their fine rivers are made a mere 
preserve for the Berwick fisheries ; and they seem to have reason. 

Produce. — The produce of this parish consists entirely of grain, 
of stock, and of potatoes, turnips, and hay. The yearly value of 
each of these separately cannot be procured; but the general value 
of the raw produce yearly raised has been estimated at L. 50,000, 
being nearly 2| of the rental. 

Manufactures. — The only great manufacturing establishments 
in this parish are upon the Gala in Darling's-haugh, and Buckholm- 
side ; and, as they form a part of the commercial body of Gala- 
shiels, being divided from it by nothing but the parochial boundary 
line, which, crossing the Gala, and passing along the side of the 
lead which drives the machinery, intersects, without disuniting that 
village, a particular account of them more properly forms a part 
of the statistics of Galashiels parish. As to the Melrose-laml- 
linens, a manufacture mentioned in the last Statistical as being so 
much on the decline that apprehensions were beginning to be en- 
tertained that the place would lose the name and business, the 
business and its very name have indeed departed long ago,— the 
bleaehfield has become a grazing field,— and the fathers and mothers 
of the present race still speak with regret of the linen trade, and

the profits they could realize in their youth by the labours of the 
spinning-wheel. Coeval with, and perhaps contributing to, the fall 
of this manufacture, was the introduction of cotton weaving from 
Glasgow, which at one time employed hundreds of hands, many of 
whom went to country work when required, and were profitably 
employed in weaving during the intervals in which no country work 
could be procured. This resource, which was a great benefit to the 
people, in compensating the irregularity of the demand for rural 
labour, which requires many hands at one season, and compara- 
tively few at another, ceased with the diminished demand for weav- 
ing in Glasgow, from which no work has been sent to this place 
for many years. The population being, nevertheless, greatly upon 
the increase, owing to causes stated in the last head, we have " the 
still loom and silent wheel," without the other woful feature in the 
poetic image of desolation, " the cold hearth." As for the wool- 
len manufacture, it has not left the country, but only withdrawn a 
few miles west to the banks of the Gala. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town, c— Melrose is a market-town, and has 689 in- 
habitants, who are chiefly employed as retailers, handicrafts, and 
labourers. As to the police of the place, it was a Burgh of Rega- 
lity before the abolition of the hereditary jurisdictions ; and under 
the present system, it is the head of its district, having a fiscal act- 
ing under the Justices of the Peace, who hold a court in its town- 
house on the first Saturday of every month. The people fre- 
quently settle their differences among themselves by arbitration, 
which is called « referring them to men," or « setting men on 
them." There were formerly magistrates called Birly men, who 
used to hold what was called a Birly court; but this, a relic per- 
haps of some old Saxon or feudal institution, has fallen into dis- 
use, and all cases not carried before the higher courts are now 
settled either by a reference to men, or by the decision of the 
justices. 

There are six other villages in the parish, Darnwick, Gattonside, 
and Newstead, each about a mile distant from Melrose, and in the 
same valley, having severally a population of 297, 290, and 230 • 
Newtown, three miles to the south-east, having a population of 161 ; 
and upon Gala water, four miles to the west, Darling's-haugh, which 
has 762 inhabitants, and Buckholmside, which has 317, both ap- 
pendages of Galashiels. 

Means of Communication.— The means of communication en- 
joyed by the parish are ample. There is a post-office in Melrose, 



58 ' ROXBURGHSHIRE. 

with drop posts to all the neighbouring places of importance; and, 
besides numerous excellent parish and statute-labour roads, which 
afford access wherever it is required, there are two spacious turn- 
pikes, the Leader and Gala water roads, which pass, the one along 
the northern, and the other along the southern boundary of the - 
parish. The Gala water road, from Newtown, where it enters to 
Caitha-toll, where it leaves the parish, is twelve miles in length ; 
and the Leader water road, after diverging from the other about 
a mile south from Newtown, continues in the parish for nine miles. 
On the former, two four-horse coaches, which travel at the rate of 
seven and eight miles an hour, have succeeded the famous old fly, 
which, with its venerable pair, would continue from twelve to six- 
teen hours between Jedburgh and Edinburgh. There are two 
stone bridges over the Tweed, one a mile above, and another two 
miles below Melrose, both in the old fashion, narrow and high- 
raised in the centre, but in perfect repair. Between them, there 
is a handsome suspension bridge for foot passengers and single 
horses. A little above the upper stone bridge, there was an an- 
cient bridge of singular construction, having a residence for the 
pontage-keeper in the centre, and a draw-bridge on each side, 
which he could lower and elevate at pleasure. The central pillar, 
or rather tower, which contained the keeper's residence, was of 
Gothic architecture, and bore the arms of the Pringles of Gala, 
to whom the right of salmon-fishing in the Tweed was formerly 
given by royal charter, burdened with the charge of keeping up 
the pontage communications over the river. It gave name to 
Bridge-end, which is deemed too small to appear in the enumera- 
tion of the villages of the parish. 

Ecclesiastical State.— There have been eleven Protestant clergy- 
men since the Reformation. The second of the series was the 
nephew of John Knox, and had the same name. His immediate 
successor, a person of the name of Forrester, was deposed for po- 
pish tendencies, and is said to have used liturgy consisting of dog- 
grel rhymes of his own composition, and containing such expres- 
sions as these : « From the knock-down race of Knoxes, good 
Lord, deliver us." Fletcher, who became Bishop of Argyle, was 
much respected during his ministry in this parish for his benigni- 
ty, public spirit, and attention to the education of the people. 
But this did not prevent them from rejoicing heartily at the re- 
moval of his curate in 1689, and the accession of Mr Wilson, the 
first Presbyterian clergyman after the revolution, who is still spoken 
of and reo-arded with veneration. The school-house was built with 



MELROSE.

funds bequeathed by Bishop Fletcher, as is commemorated by a 
Latin inscription on the wall. 

The parish church, which was removed in 1810 from the Abbey 
ruins, where it had been since the Reformation, is on the top of the 
Wearhill, a few hundred yards west from Melrose. Its exposed 
situation renders it cold in winter, but it is conveniently situated 
for the greatest part of the population, being nearly equidistant 
from the villages of Darnwick, Gattonside, and Newstead. It is 
three miles distant from the south-western extremity of the parish \ 
from the north-western not less than eight. The sittings are 
thought to be all free. They were divided at first among dif- 
ferent proprietors, in proportions corresponding with the amount of 
their assessments, but, excepting such portions as they reserve for 
the accommodation of their own families and those of their servants, 
or are pleased to assign to whose who apply for them, the whole 
church is supposed to be free to the whole parish. The manse, 
which was built in 1813, is in perfect repair. The glebe is four 
Scotch acres of poor land, and not worth L. 4 a-year. The sti- 
pend is sixteen chalders of victual. There are no chapels of ease 
in the parish ; but one is required in the west, where there is a po- 
pulation of 1000, four miles distant from the parish church. 

There are no Roman Catholics in this part of the country. There 
are occasionally a few Episcopalian families who attend the parish 
church, — the nearest Episcopalian congregation being in Kelso. 
An attempt was made to establish a congregation of Methodists, 
but it failed, and a chapel built by that sect has been lately sold 
and pulled down. Almost the whole of the Dissenters in this part 
of the country belong to the United Associate Synod, and they have 
two meeting-houses in this parish— one in Melrose, and another 
in Newtown, romantically situated in the spacious dell through 
which the Bowden burn flows into the Tweed. The living of the 
former is L. 95, that of the latter is L. 100, which has also a hand- 
some house and garden for the minister. The Seceders of this 
part of the country are to a man favourable to an Established 
church. They disapprove of patronage, but seem to be abundant- 
ly sensible of the expediency of a national provision being made for 
teaching the doctrine of our Lord. They would rather receive in- 
struction gratis than pay, and they would rather pay, than not have 
a minister of their own choice. A great part of the congregation 
of Newtown is derived from the neighbouring parishes, but a con- 
siderable proportion of the population, who reside on the banks of 







••• 



70 ROXBURGHSHIRE. 

the Leader and Gala, belong to dissenting congregations in Gala- 
shiels, Stow, Lauder, and Earlston ; so that the number of Dissen- 
ters residing within the bounds of this parish cannot be estimated 
at more than 700. Those who adhere to the Established church 
are 3400 ; the number of families about 600 ; the number of com- 
municants 800. Both in the Establishment and among the Dis- 
senters, divine service is well attended. 

Religious Societies. — There are two missionary societies in the 
parish ; the amount of their contributions is about L. 12 each; and 
there is an annual collection for their behoof, which has frequent- 
ly exceeded L. 20, and sometimes fallen so low as L. 6. 

Education. — Besides the parish school held in Melrose, there 
are six considerable schools in the villages, for each of which a 
comfortable school-house has been built. There is a small school 
at Langshaw, with a salary of L. 3 a-year, derived from a mortifi- 
cation, which is the only endowed school in the parish ; and there 
are numerous other small schools among the remote onsteads and 
cottage groups, sometimes established by the teacher himself on a 
speculation, and sometimes by a number of families, who unite to- 
gether and agree to hire a teacher, the usual rate being his board 
and lodging free, and his chance of scholars. He is comfortably 
lodged with the principal person in the cottage group, to whom he 
is an agreeable companion, and to whose children he privately 
gives additional attention, and his school fees may amount to L. 15 
per annum. He is generally some pious old intelligent person in 
decayed circumstances, or a young aspirant after a higher school, 
who is gradually acquiring habits and attainments to fit him for 
more extensive usefulness. The whole system is working exceed- 
ingly well, and no additional schools are required. If any were, 
such is the importance the people attach to the education of their 
children that they would not be long wanting. We may venture 
to say, that there are none in the parish above six who cannot 
read, and none above fifteen who cannot write, and that the people 
universally are alive to the benefits of education. In the side 
schools there is little required but English, writing, arithmetic, 
with geography and history. In the parochial school, the highest 
branches of education are taught admirably well. The teacher 
is thoroughly versed in Latin, Greek, French, mathematics, with 
their application to the arts and sciences. His salary is L. 30, — 
L. 4, 4s. less than the maximum, but he has the legal accommo- 
dation. The school fees arc 2s. a quarter for English, and for 

4 



MELROSE. 



71 



the higher branches of education 6s. 6d. and 8s. The number of 
scholars is about 70 or 80. Of the children only a small pro- 
portion can be benefited by the parochial school, which is three 
miles distant from one extremity of the parish and eight from 
another; but it is extremely useful, and in high estimation as an 
upper seminary, to which the young people can be sent when 
farther advanced, as they are, from the distance of several miles. 

Since the facilities of education were increased, a most decided 
change in the morals of the people in this part of the country has 
become visible. The number of delinquencies requiring church 
censure which occur has, as the old compared with recent re- 
cords of the Court of Session shew, diminished from seven and 
ten a-week to three in the year. This is a strong and well ascer- 
tained fact ; and it may be added, that the people universally have 
become more steady in their habits, more mild in their man- 
ners and dispositions, and more exemplary in their general cha- 
racter, moral and religious. Education in this part of the coun- 
try has enabled the people to find in reading a cheap and inno- 
cent amusement at their own fire-sides, increasing the comforts of 
home. It has brought them more under the influence of all the 
motives to good conduct ; it has rendered them less liable to be 
deluded by those false and extravagant views of things which are 
the main source of « sedition, heresy, and schism :" and, accord- 
ingly, in this part of the country, there is no sect whose doctrine dif- 
fers materially from that of the Established church. The people at 
present, in consequence of education, both live, lodge, and dress in a 
far superior style to what they enjoyed forty or fifty years ago ; they also 
save more money now than they did then; and yet the rate of wages, 
compared with the state of the markets, was at that period double 
what it is at present. To what can this be owing  To nothing but 
the good management, judicious economy, and orderly habits 
which have been produced by the improved intelligence of the 
people. It would appear, therefore, that education, besides its 
other high advantages, really enables the people to live more com- 
fortably at a cheaper rate, which is exactly the reverse of what 
some speculators are inclined to maintain. 

Literature.— There is a Subscription Library in Melrose, with 
small religious libraries among the principal villages, which admit 
of general literature, also; and it may be truly said, that there is 
not a cottage which does not possess a small store of books. There 
are no periodical publications of any kind printed within the bounds 
of the parish, but it is illustrated by works of a higher order, which 



72 ROXBURGHSHIRE. 

have proceeded from Abbotsford, Chiefswood, and Allerly ; the re- 
sidences of Scott, of Lockhart, and Hamilton, and of Brewster. 

Institutions. — There are three Friendly Societies in the parish, 
the Friendly Society of Melrose established in 1790, the Society 
of St John's Lodge established in 1797, and that of the Free 
Gardeners established in 1821. That such institutions are benefi- 
cial cannot be doubted. They act as an insurance in alleviating 
the wants of individuals from the contributions of numbers ; and the 
members, by paying in the small sum of Is. a quarter, receive from 
3s. to 5s. a week, when sick, aged, or infirm. But, besides that they 
are continually apt to break or to become unable to make good 
their engagements, the necessary calculations being generally too 
difficult for their establishers, and their basis too narrow for an In- 
surance Company to rest on, they are, it is obvious, in their best 
state, and with every advantage of which their nature admits, vastly 
inferior to the savings banks, in utility and in the incitement to in- 
dustry which they afford. 

Savings Bank. — There is a savings bank in the parish and vil- 
lage of Melrose, which is intended for the behoof of the lower 
classes of the people only, and in which the sums deposited 
amount annually to L. 300, and the sums withdrawn to L. 250. 
As it is a regulation, that the sums deposited should be withdrawn 
whenever they have attained to such an amount, that they can be 
conveniently transferred to a regular bank, the cash actually in the 
savings bank, which is more than L. 1500, is but a small part of 
what actually has been accumulated by the lower orders of this 
neighbourhood. One thing is evident, that their savings for seve- 
ral years back have not been less than L. 300 per annum. At 
the extremities of the parish, the people make their deposits else- 
where. We speak only of the savings bank of Melrose, and of the 
deposits made in the neighbourhood of that village. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
who are upon the poor's roll does not exceed seventy. The sum 
allotted to each is Is., Is. 6d., and 2s. per week, amounting on an 
average to about L. 4, 16s. per annum. The funds for the main- 
tenance of these, the enrolled and permanent poor, are raised by 
an assessment of L. 84 per quarter, upon the landed proprietors of 
the parish, which is imposed and distributed by the heritors them- 
selves, at quarterly meetings which they hold. Besides the assess- 
ment, there are the church collections, small funeral ones of various 
amount, and private donations which are from time to time received 
from the op\ilent families who reside in the neighbourhood. Ac-

cording to the old system, which has lately been resumed, the 
management of these funds is committed to the minister and elders; 
and they are not so much intended for the regular maintenance of the 
permanent poor as to afford relief to persons in temporary distress. 
To the enrolled poor also, relief is continually given out of the same 
funds, particularly at the beginning of winter, or in times of sickness, 
when what they receive from the heritors is more than usually inade- 
quate. And it may be observed in general, that whatever is given 
by the kirk-session is received as a benefaction, and that what is re- 
ceived from the heritors after a statement of their case, is claimed 
as a right. This right, however, the people have universally a 
great reluctance to exercise at first : but when once their names are 
on the roll, there is never a possibility of getting them off. The 
kirk-session, therefore, besides the good which it does in increasing 
the comforts, alleviating the distresses, and soothing the feelings of 
the poor, is highly useful in an economical point of view. By pre- 
venting the people from applying for public aid when in temporary 
distress, and thereby fostering the spirit of independence, or at least 
preventing it from being crushed prematurely, it diminishes the 
number of importunate poor, incites people to strive to maintain 
themselves as long as possible, giving them occasional aid under 
difficulties, which would otherwise be insurmountable ; and thus it 
tends to lessen the amount of the legal assessment. In former 
times, the heritors used to make advances to the kirk-session out 
of their own funds, sensible that their money could not be more use- 
fully employed in any other way, and there is evidently much wis- 
dom in making the people receive their relief from the hands of 
the same persons to whom is committed the power of moral disci- 
pline, control, and rebuke, which will tend to strengthen their au- 
thority, and to mitigate the ill will to which the exercise of that 
dangerous but salutary power may render them liable. The elders 
are also, by their knowledge of, and access to, individuals, of great 
service, in making a suitable distribution of the funds. 

This, the true old Scottish mode of providing for the poor, in- 
troduced, perhaps, so early as the Reformation, and recommend- 
ed by its own benignity, as well as the experience of ages, was in- 
terfered with in this place about twelve years ago with some view 
to improvement. From a strange misconception of the system of 
Dr Chalmers, according to whom the relief of the poor ought to 
be committed entirely to private charity, aided and directed by 
such an order of men as the elders, — the heritors took to them- 
selves the sole manngement of the poor, after which the church 



74 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



collections were made in their name, and for their behoof, and all 
distinction between the public and private relief, — the permanent, 
and the occasional poor, was lost. On the effects of this inju- 
dicious, measure it is unnecessary to enlarge. But it is proper to 
state, that its evil effects were mitigated by this, that the heri- 
tors could not claim, nor the elders give up, the management of 
the private donations which they continued to receive from time 
to time, — that after a trial of twelve years the new system has been 
abandoned, — and that the kirk-session is now restored to the full 
exercise of its old functions. The amount of the church collec- 
tions has in consequence greatly increased ; and it is not impos- 
sible that" the legal assessment may in time be brought down nearly 
to what it formerly was. 

The legal assessment ought on no account to be abolished, both 
because it enables parishes to derive aid from the non-resident pro- 
prietors, and for the sake of distinction between the public and pri- 
vate distribution of charitable relief. The kirk-session ought not to 
have the power of assessing the heritors, or the elders of Scotland, 
hitherto characterized by humble piety and unassuming worth, might 
come to degenerate into the arrogant and oppressive churchwarden. 
But neither ought this excellent and most useful court to be inter- 
fered with in the exercise of its own proper functions. Under this 
system the poor do not apply for aid, — they are sought out, — they 
receive a friendly visit from the elder of the district, who inquires 
kindly into their circumstances, and speaks comfortably to them, 
giving them a little aid from time to time ; and if at length the 
circumstances of any shall have gone down into irrecoverable pau- 
perism, he states their case to the heritors, and applies for them. 
The old Presbyterian kirk-session, wherever it exists in perfection, 
as it really does in this parish, may be truly described as one of 
the best institutions that ever was devised by the wisdom and be- 
nignity of man, for relieving the distresses, and soothing the feel- 
ings of the poor. 

Prisons. — There are no prisons in the parish, except a single 
cell, seldom or never used, similar to, and similarly situated, with 
another for receiving the feudal grain of the Duke of Buccleuch, 
which seems to have been built chiefly for the sake of uniformity. 

J7 a irs. — There are three fairs held in this place, the May fair, 
named from the old style, and held in the beginning of June ; the

Lammas fair, and the Martinmas fair. They are all cattle-mar- 
kets ; and the Lammas fair has of late years risen into such high 
importance as a' sheep-market, as to rival the great fair of St Bos- 
wells. There used to be a small market in the spring called the 
scarce Thursday fair, a corruption for Kier or Holy Thursday, 
which is said to have been in high repute as a village carnival in 
Catholic times. 

Inns, Alehouses, §-c— There are no less than thirty of these in 
the parish, of which the effects on the morals of the people are 
most pernicious. 

Fuel — The chief fuel in this part of the country is coal driven 
from the Lothians over the Soltra, and from Northumberland over 
the Garter, which sells at Is. 3d. per cwt. The thinnings of the 
neighbouring plantations are also much used, and peats from the 
moss bogs of Blainslie, of which one sells at Is. 6d. the other at 
3s. for the cart load, exclusive of carriage. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

The chief circumstance in which the present differs from the 
past state of the parish, is the general enlargement of the farms. 
Except in the case of a carrier or miller, who rents a few acres to 
furnish fodder for, and to give regular employment to his horses, 
a small farm is nearly unknown. The . displacing of the old small 
tenants, distinguished as they were by a primitive simplicity of 
manners, was at first viewed with deep regret ; that an entire ba- 
rony should be committed to one man, was exclaimed against as a 
public grievance. But the introduction of a better and more spi- 
rited style of agriculture which immediately followed, the rapid im- 
provement of the country, which in a limited period has raised the 
rental of this parish from L. 4000 nearly to L. 20,000 a-year, be- 
sides the improved condition of the agricultural labourers, seem to 
show that it was a change for the better. The land is divided into 
a limited number of great farms ; and the tenants, men of capital 
and high intelligence, are enabled to give the best effect to the 
virtues of the soil ; and the great body of the people live quietly 
under them as farm-servants and hired labourers, having no care 
but to do their work and receive their wages. The influence of 
the master over the people whom he employs is immense, and not 
the less that it is not perceived. The great farms, the valuable 
men at the head of them, and a resident proprietary, may be re- 
garded as among the chief causes of the prosperity and tranquil- 
lity for which this part of the country is so greatly distinguished.

PRESBYTERY OF JEDBURGH, SYNOD OF ME USE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. DAVID STEVENSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The modern orthography of the parish is Wilton, — 
obviously an abbreviation of Wiltown, in which form it appears 
in almost all the old records. In several ancient documents it is 
referred to under the designation of Walltown and Willis-town ; 
but the precise origin of the name cannot now be ascertained. 

Boundaries, Sfc. — The parish of Wilton is bounded by Ashkirk 
and Roberton on the west ; by Hawick on the south ; by Cavers 
on the east ; and by Minto and Lilliesleaf on the north. Its ex- 
tent along the banks of the Tiviot is about 5 miles ; average breadth 
Q\; and contents 17 square miles. Its figure is nearly that of 
a parallelogram, 

The principal river in this district, which may be called the 
Upper Ward of Roxburghshire, is the Tiviot. It takes its rise 
at a place called Tiviot-stone, about 16 miles south-west of this 
parish, and runs in a north-easterly direction, until it joins the 
Tweed at Kelso, — a distance of 36 miles. The Borthwick, a con- 
siderable tributary stream, falls into the Tiviot near the southern 
extremity of the parish, and the Slitridge or Slitrig joins it at 
Hawick. 

II. — Civil History. 

From the proximity of Wilton to Hawick, considerable notice 
has been taken of this parish in the History of Hawick, by Mr Ro- 
bert Wilson, shoemaker in Hawick, published a few years ago. 
This is not only an amusing work, but contains much valuable lo- 
cal information, and is very creditable to the talents of its author. 

Eminent Men. — No eminent literary characters appear to have 
been connected with this parish by birth. It may be noticed, how- 
ever, that Mr Crawfurd, minister of Wilton, who flourished about 
the year 1713, was a gentleman of considerable literary attain- 
ments; and in his " Dying Thoughts" left a monument of his piety 



WILTON. 



77 



behind him. Dr Charters, minister of the parish, was also a cler- 
gyman of no common pulpit eminence, and the author of Sermons, 
which, in simplicity of language, elevation of sentiment, and excel- 
lent practical morality, have few to excel them among the modern 
publications of this kind. 

Land-oioners. — His Grace the Duke of Buccleuch and Queens- 
berry is patron, and principal heritor in the parish. He is also 
Titular of the teinds, and his property is rated in the cess-books of 
the county at nearly one-half of the valued rent. Besides his 
Grace, there are ten or eleven landed proprietors, whose interest 
in the parish is, individually, from L. 100 to L. 1000 Scots ; also 
a considerable number of minor heritors. 

Parochial Registers — The Session records commence in 1694; 
They are voluminous and well-kept. The minute-book of the 
heritors, also a well-kept record, extends from 1723 to the present 
time, and contains an account of transactions relating to the poor, 
and the economics of the parish. The only remaining register is 
that of births; but, as in many other parishes in Scotland, it ex- 
hibits nothing like a punctual or regular registration, — parents 
often disregarding every admonition to record the nativity of their 
children. 

There is in this parish no register of deaths, and nothing in the 
shape of a record of marriages, excepting only a record of the 
names of those who have had proclamation of banns in the church. 

III. — Population. 
According to the former Account, the population in 1755 
amounted to 936. The average number of marriages for the three 
years immediately preceding the date of that Account was 13 ; of 
baptisms, 20, and of deaths 8. " But these numbers," adds the 
writer, " cannot be accounted precisely accurate, as all are not re- 
corded."

In 1826, the date of the present minister's connection with the parish, 1712 
In 1831, .... 1870 

Of marriages, or rather proclamations, the average number for 

the last seven years amounts to 114. 

" The expense of registration is so trifling, and the benefit which results from it 
is often so great, that it is surprising to find such universal negligence in this matter. 
No doubt there arc statutes in force to compel this observance, but it is an invidious 
task, and not worth the session-clerk's while to enforce them ; and, unless the power of 
registration be lodged elsewhere, it is much to be feared that the present irregular 
practice will not soon be corrected.

There are at present in the parish 2 persons insane ; 1 fatuous ; 
and 1 blind. 

Language. — The language generally spoken by the lower or- 
ders, throughout this district, contains many provincialisms, but 
these are becoming gradually obsolete. Two diphthongal sounds, 
however, seem still to maintain their ground, namely, those re- 
sembling the Greek ei, and the ow, as in the English words, cow, 
sow, how, now, — e. g. the common people generally pronounce, 
tree, tret ; tea, tei ; knee, hnei ; me, met ; and, instead of the diph- 
thongal sound of oo in the pronoun you, the pronunciation is al- 
most invariably yoio, as in now. 

Poaching in game is carried to a very considerable extent in 
this district ; and, so long as the present game laws continue, there 
is very little prospect of any material diminution. Unqualified per- 
sons are to be met with, in bands, in open day, equipped in all the 
habiliments of the licensed sportsman. This is an employment 
prejudicial in a high degree to the morals and industry of the com- 
munity ; and it would render an essential service to many poor 
families, were the law efficient enough to suppress poaching alto- 
gether, or make it an employment not worth the prosecuting.  

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — About two-thirds of the pa- 
rish are in tillage. But there is very little land that has not at 
some period been cultivated, as appears by the high ridges that 
may be observed in all old pastures. A great part of the out- 
field land in the parish, however, has not been ploughed within 
the memory of the oldest inhabitants. There is no land which 
could with profit be added to the cultivated land in the parish ; 
but, on the contrary, perhaps a part of what is at present cultivat- 
ed might be more profitable if left in permanent pasture. The 
number of acres under wood is about 100. 

The kinds of trees commonly planted are, oak, ash, elm, and 
beech, with larch, Scotch, spruce, and silver firs to nurse. The 
proportions are, about one-fourth of hard- wood and three-fourths of 
fir. Considerable attention is paid to the management of wood, 
by yearly thinning, pruning, &amp;c. 

Rent of Land. — It is difficult to ascertain the exact rent of arable 
land, but, at a rough guess, it may be stated on an average at about 
L. 1, Is. per acre. The average rent of grazing may be at lie 

• In consequence of the establishment of an active constable in the town of Ha- 
wick, poaching, within these last two years, has very much decreased.

rate of L. 5 for an ox or cow, kept for a year, and 6s. for a ewe or 
full-grown sheep, upon unimproved land. The real rent of the 
parish in 1827 was somewhat more than L. 6000. 

Rate of Wages. — Married farm-servants are hired for the year, 
and their wages, which are paid chiefly in kind, may be valued at 
from L. 25 to L. 28. Single servants are hired by the half year, 
and receive from L. 6 to L. 7 in summer, and from L. 4 to L. 5 
in winter, besides board. Day-labourers receive 2s. per day in 
summer, and Is. 6d. in winter; women, lOd. in summer, and 8d. in 
winter for out-door labour. 

Masons and carpenters, by the day, are paid a little more than 
common labourers. Mason-work, per contract, may be done for 
36s. to 40s. per rood, for workmanship only ; or from L. 5 to L. 7, 
according to circumstances, materials being furnished. Roofing 
with house timber is about Is. per square yard for workmanship. 
Joisting and flooring, Is. 6cl. per square yard. A farm cart costs 
about L. 9, with all furnishings ; a wooden plough, now seldom 
used about L. 3. Country smiths are generally paid in stated 
sums about L. 3 a-year for each pair of horses kept upon a farm. 
This includes shoeing and repairing plough irons and harrows. 

Husbandry. — The system of husbandry generally pursued is the 
four or five-shift rotation; but it is thought the land is gradually dete- 
riorated by this mode of cropping, and would require to rest longer 
in grass. Turnips are generally sown for a fallow crop, except on 
wet lands, when clean fallow, succeeded by a crop of wheat, is pre- 
ferred. Some attempts have lately been made to raise-spring wheat 
in the lower part of the parish, but the success has not been such as 
to encourage that practice, except in the most sheltered situations. 

The greatest part of the wet land in the parish has been 
drained, but in such a superficial manner, that in many cases the 
drains require to be renewed. A better system, however, has 
now been introduced, and is generally practised. A good deal of 
expense has been incurred in embanking the river Tiviot, but much 
still requires to be done. 

The duration of leases is generally fifteen or nineteen years, — 
except upon the Duke of Buccleuch's estate, where it is only nine, 
but the leases are usually renewed at the end of that period. 

The farm-buildings in the parish are mostly old, and, in many 
cases, insufficient for the accommodation of the farm. The land 
is all inclosed, and the arable land subdivided chiefly by thorn 
hedges, which are well kept, and thriving.

ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



It has been found impracticable to ascertain the average gross 
amount and value of raw produce yearly raised in the parish. 

Manufactures. — There are engaged in manufactures about 240 
male adults resident in this parish, of whom five are masters. 
There are five mills employed in spinning wool in the parish. Of 
the five Firms to which they belong, three have their counting- 
rooms, warehouses, and considerable branches of their business, 
such as are not immediately connected with mill-machinery, in the 
neighbouring town of Hawick. Exclusive of these, there are about 
500 men, women, and children, employed in manufactories in the 
parish. 

Wool Manufactures. — The manufactories of the parish are of 
various descriptions of goods made from wool, — such as lambs' 
wool yarn and hosiery, blankets, plaidings, flannels, tartan shawls, 
and other goods of a similar nature. The whole mills contain 
fifty teazing, scribbling, and carding engines, most of the two 
latter being what are called double engines, which prepare as much 
wool as keeps in motion 9578 spindles in slaubing, spinning, and 
doubling yarn. The quantity of wool consumed weekly, as nearly 
as can be estimated, is, upon an average, about 11,500 lb, and gives 
employment to about 230 slaubers, spinners, &amp;c. — men and lads, 
who have the care of machinery, — and women, who supply wool to the 
carding and scribbling engines, — and children, who are employed 
by the former as piecers, — 240 stocking-makers, 75 weavers, and 
about 40 people in milling, scouring, dyeing, and finishing goods. 

«Those employed in the mills generally work from six o'clock in 
the morning till seven o'clock in the evening, — two hours being al- 
lowed for meals. Stocking-makers, weavers, &amp;c. begin the day at 
six in the morning, and cease working at eight o'clock in the even- 
ing ; but the work-hours of the latter are not regular. 

It may be noticed, that some of the manufacturers have of late 
worked part of their machinery night and day, i. e. from one 
o'clock Monday morning till eleven o'clock Saturday night. Where 
this is done, two sets of work-people are employed, and each set 
takes the night-work every alternate week. 

Very few children are employed before nine years of age. The 
work they are put to is of a very light description ; and, from the 
quantity of vegetable oil used in preparing the wool, and the fac- 
tories being well-aired, they are generally very healthy and thriv- 
ing. They have all been taught to read previously to their enter- 
ing a factory, and most of them attend one or other of the Sunday 



WILTON. 



81 



schools of Hawick. Their situation is fully as comfortable as that 
of their class in general, though, it must be granted, that manufac- 
tories are commonly not the best schools of morality for youth. 
In many instances, however, fathers who are slaubers or spinners 
employ their own children as piecers ; and the good conduct of 
many children under the restraining influence of a parent's eye, has, 
without doubt, a beneficial effect on others who have not the same 
advantages. 

Since the introduction of the woollen manufactories into this 
part of the country, the quantity of wool consumed has been gra- 
dually and regularly increasing. In the year ending December 
31, 1828, there were manufactured in Hawick and Wilton parishes, 
1,038,641 slips of yarn, and 432,201 pairs of hose ; in the year 
ending December 31, 1829, 1,010,641 slips of yarn, and 465,823 
pairs of hose; and in the year ending December31, 1830, 1,102,865 
slips of yarn, and 488,487 pairs of hose ; and there is annually, 
besides, a large quantity of yarn manufactured into blankets, 
plaidings, and flannels. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Town, fyc. — There is no market-town in the parish. 
Wilton may be called the suburbs of Hawick, and is scarcely dis- 
joined from it ; nay, a small section of the parish actually forms a 
part of the town of Hawick. The grammar-school lately erected 
there, an excellent building, but very incommodiously situated, is 
in the parish of Wilton. 

Villages, Sfc. — There are three villages, or rather hamlets, in the 
parish, — viz. Appletree Hall, towards the north ; Langlands Dean, 
in the south ; and what may be called the village of Wilton. 

Means of Communication. — The nearest post-office is at Hawick, 
and an excellent communication has lately been formed with that 
town from the north by a new bridge of four arches across the Tiviot. 
This new approach runs through a small part of the glebe between 
the church and the manse, and joins the present Edinburgh road, 
at what is called Dovemount Well. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church is almost equidistant 
from either extremity of the parish. None of the church-going po- 
pulation reside at more than two miles and a-half from the church ; 
and the Dissenters consider it as no inconvenience to travel half a- 
mile farther to their respective places of worship at Hawick. The 
present parish church was built in 1762, and very lately under- 
went a considerable internal repair, and was handsomely painted.

ROXBTJRG II SHI RE. 



It affords accommodation for about 600 persons, and all the sit- 
tings are free. A considerable number of years ago, an additional 
gallery was built in front of the pulpit, at the joint expense of 
the Duke of Buccleuch, the late venerable Dr Charters, and Wil- 
liam Oliver, Esq. aided by a few small subscriptions. This sec- 
tion of the church is open to sitters of almost every description, and 
differs from the rest of the accommodation, which was originally 
t allocated to the heritors, according to their respective valuations. 
The lower part of the aisle or gallery referred to, was reserved for 
a cemetery to the family of Dr Charters ; and there the ashes of 
that eminent servant of God repose, with a plain inscription upon 
a neat marble tablet, from the pen of his intimate friend, the late 
excellent and venerable Dr Thomas Somerville of Jedburgh. 

The manse was built about fifty years ago, is a substantial edi- 
fice, and kept in good repair by the heritors. It is upon a scale 
much smaller than modern houses of the same description, and 
quite inadequate to the comfortable accommodation of a large 
family. 

The stipend is six chalders of victual, half meal and half barley, 
with L. 36 and odds in money. " The glebe," says Dr Charters, 
" is large and valuable ;" and it is much to be regretted that for- 
mer incumbents, who lived nearer the source of information, did 
not think it proper, for the benefit of- their successors, to give a 
more ample account of it. The glebe, properly so called, is alto- 
gether an anomaly in the Church of Scotland. What may be de- 
nominated in-field, and lying around the manse, consists of about 
eighty English acres of excellent land, all arable, and has been in 
possession of the minister from time immemorial. There is no 
document or record in existence to show how this land came into 
the hands of the church, and every search to discover its history- 
has been altogether in vain. All that can be said in this respect 
is, that the land is in the possession of the minister, and no person 
can say with certainty how it came. There is no proof that this 
extra quantity of land was ever designed as a glebe, or actually- 
given out of the lands of the heritors, by any special appropri- 
ation. In an account of his stipend and emoluments, given by the 
Rev. Mr Simpson, one of the former incumbents, in 1765, he says, 
" that there is a glebe, and certain lands called the Mains of Wil- 
ton, belonging to the minister of Wilton, which lie contiguous, and 
the respective bounds of which are not known, but in conjunction, 
they are bounded as follows," &amp;c. But there is a tradition in the 



WILTON. 



83 



parish and neighbourhood, respecting the acquisition of this land 
to the benefice, which, though not supported by any existing docu- 
ment, must have had its origin in fact. 

It appears from the records of the presbytery of Jedburgh, that 
a Mr John Langlands was minister of Wilton in 1641, and that 
the presentation to the parish at that time belonged to the Buc- 
cleuch family, and to the Langlands of Langlands, per vices. The 
Mains of Wilton, which lie contiguous to the church and manse, 
and formed a boundary to the estate of Langlands, are said by this 
traditionary account to have been given by the Laird of Langlands 
to his relative, then minister of the parish ; and, if any deed of con- 
veyance accompanied the grant, it has long since been lost. The 
tradition, however, from the remotest periods, has universally been, 
that the benefice obtained the lands in the manner now mentioned 
from the Langlands family. 

Yet, notwithstanding the uncertainty as to the origin of the glebe, 
and although it could not be shown that the Mains of Wilton had 
ever been designed by the heritors in lieu of any portion of the 
stipend, the Court of Teinds in 1827 held the lands to be the 
old glebe lands of the Popish incumbents, forming part of the 
original endowments of the benefice. Previous to 1649, the sti- 
pend was 12 bolls of meal and bear, Tiviotdale measure, and 540 
merks Scots. An augmentation was then obtained, although the 
decree of locality is now lost, which made the stipend amount to 
3 chalders, Linlithgow measure, and L. 560 Scots, exclusive of the 
glebe, and this continued to be the value of the living for the pe- 
riod of 178 years. During this long interval no process of aug- 
mentation, so far as it is known, was brought forward ; and, while 
other churches were gradually rising in the scale of emolument, 
the heritors of Wilton, through the apathy or timidity of its in- 
cumbents, were suffered to retain in their pockets the augment- 
ed stipend which might have been obtained. 

Besides the lands which lie contiguous to the manse, there are 
also belonging to this church about sixteen English acres, which 
were acquired in the division of Wilton common in 1765. This 
out-field is two miles west from the church, and, although nearly 
all arable, yet, being in a high and exposed situation, it is much 
inferior in value to that part of the glebe formerly mentioned. 

There are no chapels of ease, nor dissenting congregations of any 
description in this parish. The Seceders, as at the period when 
Dr Charters gave in his report, are numerous, although they have

not increased in proportion to the increase of population. Divine 
service at the Established church is well attended, and the average 
number of communicants is about 400. 

The average yearly amount of church collections for the last 
seven years is L. 16. As in many other parishes, there are here two 
funds for the support or assistance of the poor, namely, the heri- 
tors' fund, and the collections, with other monies belonging to the 
kirk-session. The session funds are appropriated chiefly to the 
relief of incidental distress, and operate powerfully in keeping 
paupers from the heritors' fund. The school-fees for a conside- 
rable number of poor children are also paid from this fund; and 
books are occasionally furnished from it for those whose parents 
are not able to supply them. 

Education. — Besides the parish school, there are two unendowed 
schools, well taught. Although the parish is not large, it is much 
to be regretted that the heritors, when the schoolmasters' salaries 
were recently augmented, did not, as in many parishes, allow an ad- 
ditional chalder for the benefit of these unendowed schools. They 
have been long in existence, and are of great benefit to the inha- 
bitants of those sections of the parish where they are situated. 
Men who devote their time and talents to the instruction of youth 
ought certainly to have a decent remuneration, which, however, in 
many cases, cannot be obtained, even where the attendance is nu- 
merous, in consequence of the low rate of fees. 

The parochial schoolmaster has the maximum salary. Neither 
the school-house nor dwelling-house are commodious, and he has 
not the legal quantity of ground for a garden, but receives a com- 
pensation for the deficiency. The teaching apartment is not good, 
and is by far too small to accommodate comfortably the very con- 
siderable number of scholars who attend the school. All the 
branches of education commonly taught in parish schools are taught 
here successfully, by an able, experienced, and indefatigable teacher. 
His fees may probably amount to L. 50 per annum. 

 A few years ago, several of the minor heritors, into whose hands the business of 
the parish had fallen, in consequence of the non-attendance of many whose interest in 
the parish is greater, endeavoured to avail themselves of that clause in the poors' act 
which authorizes them to take from the kirk-session the half of all collections and 
other monies. This was not the resolution of any thing like a majority of the he- 
ritors ; and the consequence was, that the collections in a short time dwindled down 
to nothing, — insomuch, that collecting for several Sabbaths ceased altogether. The 
people would not contribute when they knew that the half of the collections was to 
be diverted from their original object, and applied to assist the heritors in the mainte- 
nance of the ordinary poor. A return to the old system soon followed, by the reso- 
lution of a great majority of the heritors, and lie collections are now nearly as ample 
as before.

No instance is known of any person, who has arrived at the age 
of fifteen years, being unable to read or write. The people are 
alive to the benefits of education, and send their children early to 
school. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid for the last seven years, including a few who 
receive an occasional supply, is 55; and the average sum allowed to 
each individual is 2s. 2d. per week. The annual average amount 
of contributions levied by assessment upon the heritors and tenants 
for the same period is L. 308. As the church collections derive 
no benefit from the principal and several other heritors who are 
non-resident, this fund would go but a very short way in relieving 
the necessities of the poor. The present mode of assessment is 
certainly the best, because all are compelled to contribute in pro- 
portion to their interest in the parish ; whereas were the principle 
of voluntary contribution adopted, many, it is to be feared, from a 
parsimonious spirit, would give with a sparing hand. No doubt, the 
maintenance of the poor is a burden, but it is one of those burdens 
which must be borne; and there is no other way of doing it, but by a 
legal provision or individual benevolence. In large towns, where 
many are wealthy and disposed to charity, the poor may find in some 
degree a precarious subsistence; but it is altogether impracticable 
in country parishes, where many of their neighbours are nearly as 
necessitous as themselves, and of consequence have little to spare. 
Nothing can be more preposterous, than the idea of maintaining 
50 or 60 paupers by spontaneous benevolence, where not only the 
means are awanting, but where even the benevolent themselves 
have frequently little time to devote to the business of finding out 
and relieving the wants of the poor. Much has also been said about 
the rapid increase of pauperism, but it will be found in this, as in 
many other parishes, that the number of poor has not increased with 
the increase of the population. There were between 30 and 40 
paupers when the population was 900, and the average number for 
the last seven years is only 55, though the population in that 
time has been more than doubled. The expense of maintenance 
has also been loudly complained of ; but it seldom occurs to those 
who make this complaint, that not only the value of produce has 
been much enhanced, but also that neither the number of the poor, 
nor their weekly aliment, has borne any thing like a proportion to 
the increase of rents within these last fifty years ; and it ought, 
moreover, to be considered, that even the poor themselves contri- 



86 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



bute materially to heighten the value of produce, and thus a reci- 
procity or interchange of advantage actually occurs to those by 
whom the poor are maintained. 

Fuel. — The expense of fuel is great in this district. The 
nearest coal is brought from Red Water, Northumberland, a 
distance of 28 or 30 miles, and is generally sold by the cart load 
of five bags, containing about ten cwt. at from 13s. to 14s. Coal 
is also brought from Berwickshire via Kelso, and sold by the cwt. 
The average price during the year is about 14d., although after 
harvest, and occasionally at other times, it can be bought at lid. 
and Is. per cwt. Of late years, in consequence of more competi- 
tion, coal is brought to Hawick much cheaper than formerly. Dur- 
ing a long-continued storm, it has been sold so high as 2s. 2d. and 
2s, 4d. per cwt. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
In closing this report, I have only farther to remark, that the 
inland situation of this district, which is nearly equidistant from the 
Solway, the Forth at Leith and the sea at Berwick, is certainly not 
favourable to the extension of manufactures, as the land carriage of 
articles for exportation adds so considerably to the prime cost ; and 
the want of facilities for internal communication by canals and rail- 
roads, is a desideratum that will not easily be supplied, on account 
of the altitude and uneven surface of the country. Yet, notwith- 
standing these local disadvantages, commerce, trade, and agricul- 
ture are in a flourishing condition ; and the whole of the manu- 
v factories which have been described above, have sprung up in this 
parish since the date of the last report. Were coal more easily 
procured, it would undoubtedly add materially both to the comfort 
of the inhabitants, and to the extension of trade. And were such 
of the labouring classes as spend their earnings injudiciously, — and 
not a few of these are to be found everywhere — to abjure the im- 
moderate use of whisky, they would be better clad and better fed, 
and promote at least the temporal comfort of themselves and families.

PRESBYTERY OF SELKIRK, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER NIVISON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Extent, Boundaries. — The extent of Roberton parish in length 
is about 13 miles, and in breadth about 5. It contains about 48 
square miles. It is bounded on the north by the parishes of Et- 
trick, Yarrow, Ashkirk, and Selkirk ; on the east, by Ashkirk and 
Wilton ; on the south, by Hawick, and Cavers ; and on the west by 
Eskdalemoor, and Ettrick. 

Topographical Appearances. — The parish is hilly; but no single 
hill rises nearly to the height of the Ettrick ones on the north, or 
those of Liddesdale on the south. The most elevated is the range 
to the west of the parish, upon the boundaries of Dumfries-shire, 
containing the hills of Craickmoor, the Culm or Coom, evidently 
from the Latin culmen, and one of a rather conical figure, called 
the Criblaw of Craick. None of these, it is thought, much ex- 
ceeds 1300 feet above the level of the sea. This range of hills 
lies north and south. The acclivities are in some places precipi- 
tous, but generally moderate, and the summits are flat. Two other 
ranges of hills, of less elevation, fall from the above, in an eastern 
direction ; and between these is the water and vale of Borthwick. 
The one range rises on the south of Borthwick water, and declines 
again towards Tiviot river ; the other rises on the north side and 
declines a little towards Ale-water. The vale of Borthwick is ge- 
nerally narrow. 

Meteorology. — The situation of the parish, at nearly equal dis- 
tances from the east and west seas, determines in a great degree 
the temperature and climate. It has been ascertained that nearly 
one-third more rain falls in this neighbourhood than in the neigh- 
bourhood of Edinburgh. July and August are the warmest and 
driest months in the year, though in these we have sometimes

schoolmaster of Wilton.

terrible thunder storms, accompanied with heavy falls of rain. 
Rheumatism among the labouring classes, especially in the decline 
of life, is still a general complaint here ; but considerably less so 
since the introduction of surface draining. The weather in Sep- 
tember and October is very variable. The following tables, the 
one taken from the Transactions of the Royal Society, Edinburgh, 
and the other from Dr Douglas's " View of the Agriculture of 
Roxburgh and Selkirkshire," will furnish the best information con- 
nected with the temperature and climate. .

Hydrography — There are several lakes in the parish. — That of 
Alemoor is a pretty circular sheet of water, about two miles in cir- 
cumference, of considerable depth ; in some places it has been as- 
certained to be thirty fathoms. From it, flows Ale-water. Hell- 
moor lake, partly in the parish, and treble the extent of Alemoor, 
is more shallow. The scenery around both is in the summer sea- 
son pleasant, but rather tame. The lake of Moodlaw, to the west 
of the parish, is said to be equally divided among the three pa- 
rishes of Roberton, Eskdalemoor, and Ettrick; and each parish 
in its respective county, Roxburgh, Dumfries and Selkirk. Thus" 
three parishes and three counties meet in the centre of this lake. 

 Branxholm is situated about three miles nearly south of Roberton, but consider, 
ably lower in elevation; and Wool is about five miles nearly north, and nearly as high 
in situation.

The water of Borthwick flows from the range of hills on the 
west of the parish. Its direction is eastward, its course rapid, and 
length about thirteen miles. It falls into the river Teviot about 
two miles west of Hawick. 

Geology and Mineralogy — The prevalent rocks are of the grey- 
wacko series. A seam of very excellent ironstone crosses the parish. 
The alluvial deposits covering these rocks are generally gravel, 
sand, clay, marl, and peat. There are many mosses in the parish, 
in some of which are found excellent shell-marl and peat. De- 
cayed trees are often found imbedded in these mosses, as also 
horns of the deer species and of other animals, which, from the 
size of the bones, seem to have been of a species distinct from any 
of those of the present day. 

The soil in the vale of Borthwick is of good quality. Upon the 
ascents on each side of the water if, becomes thinner, gravelly, and 
dry. Towards the summits of the hills, it is wet and boggy, — es- 
pecially in the western part of the parish. 

Zoology — In most of the lakes are found abundance of perch, 
pike, and eel, and where the pike is not found, there is abundance 
of excellent trout. During the spawning season, great quantities 
of sea trout, grilse, or young salmon come up the Borthwick and 
Ale. The spawning season in the Tweed is perhaps more early 
than that of its tributary streams ; but this may be owing to the 
shallowness of the latter. It is during the autumnal floods that 
the greatest quantities of fish come up. They commence their 
run upwards about the end of October, and continue coming and 
going with the floods during the winter season ; and some lingering 
ones are caught so late as April ; but these are in a very exhausted 
state, and not good for food. 

A certain grub has of late years done considerable damage both 
to crops and pasture in this neighbourhood. As an instance, it 
may be noticed that about ten acres of pasture were destroyed by it 
upon the farm of Todshawhaugh. This pasture first lost its verdure, 
and then became quite brown. On pulling up a handful of the wither- 
ed grass or moss, a number of these insects were seen. They were 
of a dirty whitish-colour, of the shape of the common caterpillar, 
bu1 l ather thicker and shorter. The crows at last discovered them, 
and made great havoc amongst them, — literally pulling up every 
stem of grass, in order to reach them. Latterly the appearance 
of the ground was almost that of ploughed land covered with 
withered grass.

Bat any. — Medicinal Plants. — Acorus calamus ; can runatiye and 
stomachic. Adiantum capillus veneris ; used for preparing the syrup 
called Capillaire. Agrimonia Eupatoria ; slightly styptic and astrin- 
gent. Artemisia vulgaris ; anthelmintic, stimulant, detergent, and

rant, antiscorbutic. Vaccinium Myrtillus ; refrigerant, astringent. 
V accinium Oxycoccus ; refrigerant. Vaccinium Vitis Idea ; refri- 
gerant, antiseptic. 

There are a number of thriving plantations in the parish. The 
kinds of timber which predominate at present are the larch, spruce, 
and Scotch fir; but considerable quantities of these are, by the 
annual thinnings sold off, and the hard-wood, such as oak, ash, 
elm, plane, and beech, are gaining the ascendancy. In many 
places, the firs are nearly thinned out, and the hard-wood trees 
are shooting up beautiful trunks. There is also a considerable 
quantity of old timber in the parish, especially at Borthwickbrae. 
Most of the plantations are upon the estates of Borthwickbrae, 
Chisholme, Borthwickshiels, Hoscoat, and Harden. Upon the 
Duke of Buccleuch's estate, which forms half the parish, there 
are scarcely any plantations. 

II. — Civil History. 

Land-oicners. — The land-owners are, the Duke of Buccleuch; 
R. Chisholme, Esq. of Chisholme ; Allan Eliott Lockhart, Esq- 
of Borthwickbrae; Hugh Scott, Esq. of Harden; George Pott, 
Esq. of Borthwickshiels ; Thomas Stavert, Esq. of Hoscoat ; 
Archibald Scott, Esq. of Howcleuch; James Johnstone, Esq. of 
Alva ; Robert Pringle, Esq. of Clifton, M. P. ; and Charles Rid- 
dell, Esq. of Muselee. 

Parochial Registers. — There are some registers which go back 
as far as the year 1680, but they are neither voluminous nor regu- 
larly kept. They have also suffered much from decay and from 
damp. One small record of the births and marriages of Hassen- 
dean parish is still preserved. 

Antiquities. — There are a number of ancient camps in the pa- 
rish, — some of these of a square, — others of an oval shape. One of 
them is situated upon the farm of Highchesters This camp, as 
the name indicates, is on an elevated piece of ground, and com- 
mands an extensive view. The largest and most complete camp is 
upon the farm of Broadlee, to the west of the parish. There arc 
two others upon the farm of Todshawhill, one upon he farm of 



HOBERTON. 



91 



Todshawhaugh ; and another upon the lands of Borthwickshiels 
called Camp Castle. The name generally given to these camps by 
the common people is that of the Picfs or Peoch's works. A ball 
of about one and a-half pound weight was lately found near one 
of these, and in another some daggers in a very decayed state. 

The old mansion-house of Harden, the ancient abode of the 
Scotts of Harden, is a place which still excites considerable cu- 
riosity. The carved stucco work upon the ceiling of the old hall 
is well worth attention. The lobby is paved with marble, and the 
mantel-piece of one of the rooms is surmounted with an Earl's co- 
ronet, and the letters W. E. T. wreathed together, signifying " Wal- 
ter Earl of Tai'ras," — a title borne in former times by the house 
of Harden. This mansion-house was formerly fortified by art, and 
is still so, in some parts, by nature. In front of the house, there is 
adeep glen, very precipitous on both sides, but both sidesare covered 
with beautiful trees. Into this glen, it is said, that Wat of Harden, 
a well-known border chieftain, used to drive the cattle which he 
had carried off in his nightly raids. From one of these excursions, 
an infant was brought home. He was fostered by Mary Scott, at. 
that time Lady of Harden, and a descendant of the lady of that name 
commonly called the Flower of Yarrow. This unknown child is 
supposed to have been the author of many of the border songs.  — 
See Leyden's " Scenes of Infancy," and " Minstrelsy of the Scottish 
Border." 

 Dr Leyden alludes to this tradition in the following beautiful lines, from " The 
Scenes of Infancy." 

" What fair half-vail'd leans from her lattic'd hall, 
Where red the waving gleams of torch light fall  
'Tis Yarrow's flower, who thro' the gloom, 
Looks wishful for her lover's dancing plume. 
Amid the piles of spoil that strew'd the ground, 
Her ear all anxious caught a wailing sound ; 
With trembling haste the lovely nymph then flew, 
And from the plunder'd heaps an infant drew  
Scar'd at the light, his feeble hands he flung 
Around her neck, and to her bosom clung ; 
While beauteous Mary sooth'd in accents mold 
His fluttering soul, and kissed her foster child. 
Of milder mood the gentle captive grew, 
Nor lov'd the scenes that scar'd his infant view ; 
In vales remote from camps and castles far, 
He shunn'd the cruel scenes of strife and wai\ 
Content the loves of simple swains to sing, 
Or wake to fame the harp's heroic string ; 
He liv'd o'er Yarrow's fairest flower to shed a tear, 
And strew the holly leaves o'er Harden's bier ; 
J5ut none was found above the minstrel's tomb. 
Emblem of peace, to bid the daisy bloom ; 
He, nameless as the race from whence he sprung, 
Sung other names, and left his own unsung."

Modem Buildings. — The mansion-houses of Borthwickbrae, 
Chisholme, Borthwickshiels, and Hoscoat, are excellent modern 
buildings : and some of the farm-houses are little inferior. In- 
deed, none of the late improvements is more striking than the ex- 
cellent farm-houses that have been erected. Almost all of them 
are new, or have undergone a thorough repair since the former Sta- 
tistical Account was written. The manse underwent a thorough re- 
pair four years ago. The church is old, but in good repair, and 
well accommodated to its purposes. It bears the inscription of 
1659. Roberton was erected into a parish about that date. Has- 
sendean, the old parish, about nine miles lower down the country, was 
annexed to Minto and Wilton. Roberton was erected from parts 
of the parishes of Hawick, Selkirk, Wilton, and Hassendean.  

The remains of two chapels can still be traced, — one of these 
upon the farm of Chapelhill, where curates from Hassendean used 
to officiate; the other, said to have belonged to the diocese of 
Galloway, is at Borthwickbrae, where the chief burial-place of the 
parish still is. The families of the Potts and Grieves are buried 
here.

 From the inscription on the church bell, it appears to have belonged to Melrose 
tolbooth. Tradition says, that when the church was removed from Hassendean, the 
people in that quarter were highly incensed, and made great opposition to the mea- 
sure. The first of the workmen who mounted the ladder to unroof the old church 
was struck with a stone, which killed him. The ladies also showed much zeal in de- 
fending the kirk; and there is an old ditty, which arose out of the transaction, still

seized upon the church bell, and cast it into the pool, where it still remains.

Character, fyc. of the People. — The character of the inhabitants 
is generally moral and religious, and their habits cleanly. The ge- 
neral appearance of the cottages does not correspond to that of the 
farm-houses ; but a better style in erecting these is yearly gaining 
ground, and there is a considerable ambition amongst the peasantry 
to have neat houses. Their ordinary food is barley, and a small 
portion of wheaten bread, oat-meal porridge, broth and butcher- 
meat occasionally, fish, butter, cheese, potatoes, milk, and tea. 

Poaching was lately carried on to a great excess in this parish 
and neighbourhood, not, indeed, by the people resident in the pa- 
rish, but very generally by the operatives of the manufacturing 
towns, especially when trade was slack. Formerly, the poachers 
used singly to seek the game, and generally fled when they saw 
any person approaching them, or at least walked off the ground 
when desired. But of late years they banded together, and dar- 
ingly set the keepers at defiance. The farmer and his shepherd 
were often insulted, and sometimes the gun was cocked in their 
faces; but it fared much worse with the gamekeepers, as they 
seldom returned home without personal injury. Bands of these 
modern freebooters, for they were generally the very scum of so- 
ciety, would sometimes take up their residence in some outhouse or 
fold in the moors, and continue there for weeks at a time, — living 
on such provisions as could be had. Instances are known of their 
taking and roasting sheep. About two years ago, when matters 
were at the worst, the landed proprietors, along with some farmers, 
their servants, and a few energetic constables, attacked them. 
Upon one occasion, in particular, about twenty of these poachers 
were congregrated round a corn field, then recently cut, where they 
killed the game in great abundance. In this situation, the con- 
stables and farm-servants set upon them, and took them all prison- 
ers. A few of the more notorious of these poachers, against whom 
warrants had been obtained, were pinioned and carried off to jail. 
Since that time there has not been much poaching.

Of late years there has not been much killing of fish. The 
gentlemen certainly do not countenance it ; neither do they punish 
it, unless when the trespassers are brought before them in a Justice 
of Peace court. Indeed, their too scrupulously protecting the fish 
in our highland streams would only be conferring a bounty on the 
good citizens of Berwick, at the expense of depriving their own 
peasantry of a very savoury morsel to their often scanty potato sup- 
per on winter evenings. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — The number of acres, im- 
perial measure, in the parish, either cultivated or occasionally in 
tillage, is about 2000 ; but a much greater quantity than that has 
been formerly cultivated. The number of acres uncultivated, and 
which form the sheep-walks, is very great, — perhaps about 28,000. 
All the land that can with a profitable application of capital be cul- 
tivated has been so already. Indeed, it may be questioned whether 
a quantity of that at present in tillage might not be more profit- 
ably untilled. The number of acres under plantation is about 550 ; 
and great care is taken in the management of the plantations. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of arable land is about 15s. 
per acre ; and the average rate of grazing, at the rate of L. 4, or 
L. 4, 10s. per ox or cow, and 7s. per ewe. 

Rate of Wages. — The daily rate of labour in summer is about 
2s. and 2s. 6d., and in winter Is. 8d. or Is. lOd. Women in sum- 
mer receive 10d., except in harvest, when their wages are nearly 
equal to those of men. The wages of a ploughman, who receives 
his victuals in his master's house, are from L. 8 to L. 10, 10s., and 
those of a servant girl from L. 6 to L. 7, 10s. 

Stock. — The common breed of cattle is the short-horned; and 
the number of cattle, including Highland kyloes, not bred in the 
parish, is about 700 ; of horses, old and young, 130. 

There are about 19,000 sheep in the parish, which produce 
about 2800 stones of wool, Troy weight. The common breeds of 
sheep are the Cheviot, more or less crossed with the Leicester ram, 
and a few hirsels of the black-faced kind. Great attention is paid 
to their improvement. It is a very prevalent and profitable custom 
to cross the Cheviot ewe with the bred ram. The mixed offspring 
is a very heavy lamb, — much heavier for the English butcher mar- 
kets than the pure Cheviot one. The wool is also much improved 
both in weight and quality. Some farmers have of late years al- 
lowed their flocks to go partially unsalved; but the unsalved wool, 



ROBERTON. 



95 



though higher in price, is considerably reduced in quantity and 
weight. These circumstances, and the risk of the sheep catching 
a prevalent disorder, perhaps nearly overbalance the profit. The 
farmers who follow this practice engage in it with misgivings and a 
suspicion in their own minds as to its propriety ; and certainly their 
neighbours, who do not follow the custom, have a great jealousy 
against it. 

Of late years, a considerable number of kyloes, bought at the 
Falkirk trysts, have been wintered in the parish. It is considered 
by some, that the putting of a certain number of cattle upon the sheep 
pastures is not only profitable, but also advantageous to the sheep. 
The experiment seems at least a reasonable one, as one species of 
stock may feed, in a great measure, upon the herbage and grasses 
which another passes over. However, there are different opinions 
on the subject, and the real sheep-breeders do not seem much to 
relish the custom. 

t'  

Husbandry. — The general character of the husbandry pursued 
is the five-shift rotation. The duration of leases is generally 7, 9, 
and 1 1 years. The farm-buildings are good. The enclosures are 
generally hedges near the water side, and dry-stone dikes in the 
higher grounds ; but several of the sheep-farms have, as yet, no ring 
fences. 

Among the principal improvements, that have been recently 
made, are the introduction of lime and bone dust ; but the greatest 
is certainly the sheep drains. These are mostly surface drains. 
They have the effect of drying the meadows and marshy land, — by 
which means the grass becomes much finer and thicker. They have 
likewise been the means of curing several disorders among the 
sheep, such as rot. 

The disorder which commits the greatest depredations in this 
neighbourhood, is the louping ill. This disorder has as yet baffled 
all skill : and it often commits great havoc among the sheep in 
the spring season. What renders it still more formidable is, that 
it does not carry off the weaker sheep, but very generally seizes the 
best. The shepherd often passes, on his morning round, a fine 
healthy ewe, and in the evening finds her a victim to this mischie- 
vous disorder. Upon a farm of between forty and fifty score, 
sometimes there will be deaths to the amount of seven or eight 
score. The disorder has all the appearance of a palsy, only, that 
that disorder amongst the human species is generally incident to 
age, whereas among sheep the disorder in question seems to carry 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



off old and young indiscriminately. There are a number of other 
disorders incident to the sheep and stock in this part of the coun- 
try, but none of these are of a very deadly nature. 

The Pastoral Society of Selkirkshire has had considerable in- 
fluence in improving the breeds of both cattle and sheep. Many 
of the farmers of this parish are members of it. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 
the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows : 

Produce of grain of all kinds, whether cultivated for food of man or domestic ani- 

i mals, _ . _ _ . L.2000 0 0 

Of potatoes, turnips, &amp;c. - 700 0 0 

Of hay, meadow and cultivated, - 1200 0 0 
Of land in pasture, rating it at L. 4 per cow, or full-grown ox, grazed, 

and 7s. per ewe pastured for year, - - 9000 0 0 

Of gardens, - - - - - 70 0 0 

Thinnings of plantations, annual, - - - - 60 0 0

Miscellaneous, not enumerated in the above heads, - - 300 0 0 

Total yearly value of raw produce," L. 16,130 0 0 

The old valued rent of the parish is L. 10,654, 10s. lOd. The 
real rental at present is about L. 6500. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication. — Hawick, at a distance of three miles 
from the lower, and fifteen, from the higher parts of the parish, is 
the nearest market-town ; and there is a daily communication by 
carriers. The length of turnpike roads in the parish is nearly 
twenty miles. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church, situated in the lower part of 
the parish, which is most populous, is perhaps scarcely so convenient 
to the population as another spot, that might have been chosen ; but 
no person who is willing to go to the house of God has much reason 
to complain. It is three miles from the lower, and ten from the 
higher extremities of the parish, and nearly in the centre of the 
bulk of the population. It was probably built, as the inscription 
upon it imports, in 1659. It affords accommodation to about 250 
persons. The manse was repaired in 1827. The extent of the 
glebe is 16 acres, and its value about L. 20 per annum. The 
boundary betwixt Roxburghshire and Selkirkshire divides the glebe 
in such a manner, as to entitle the minister to a vote in each count'. 
The amount of stipend is 14 chalders, a considerable part of which 
is paid from lands lying in the parishes of Wilton and Minto. It is 
twenty years since any augmentation was obtained. 

 The above estimate is given with much doubt ; and it is thought that, if there be 
any error, it will be in making the amount too great.

The number of families which attend the Established church is 
about 112; and of individuals, old and young, about 626. The 
number of Dissenting families is about 19 ; and of individuals, old 
and young, about 104. Divine service is well attended. The 
average number of communicants is about 200. There is a Mis- 
sionary society in the parish ; but it is rather in a languishing state. 
Its yearly contributions may be about L. 3. 

Education. — There is one parochial school. The branches 
taught are, reading, at 8s. per annum ; reading and writing, 10s. ; 
arithmetic, 12s. ; mensuration, &amp;c. ; Latin. The salary is the maxi- 
mum , and the yearly amount of fees received may be L. 24. The 
teacher has the legal accommodations ; but the school has been 
for ten years by far too small. A splendid new school house and 
schoolmaster's house are nearly finished About one-third of the 
parish is so situated that children cannot attend the parish school. 
These are at a distance of five and eight miles. 

Poor and Parochia{ Funds.— The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is 15, and their annual average pay L. 5, 4s. 
The amount raised' by assessment— one-half upon the" heritors, 
and the other half upon the tenants— is about L. 100 ; and that col- 
lected in church is about L. 10. There are individual cases where 
considerable reluctance is shown in the asking of aid ; but this laud- 
able spirit, it is feared, is on the decline. 

Alehouse. — There is one alehouse in the parish. Formerly 
there were two ; but one of them was suppressed, as it gave en- 
couragement to tippling, and harboured poachers. 

Fuel— The common fuel is peat, which can be obtained in 
abundance at about 5s. 6d. a cart load, and coals at about 15s. per 
cart load of 11 and 12 cwt.

<p>

PRESBYTERY OF JEDBURGH, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. JOHN RICHMOND, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The parish is called indiscriminately South dean or 
Charters. The upper district is more properly than the other 
parts called Southdean, — a name supposed to be derived from its 
having been the south valley or dean of the once celebrated Jed 
Forest. 

Extent, Boundaries, fyc. — The extent of the parish is about 13 
miles in length, and 7 in breadth. It is bounded on the S. by Nor- 
thumberland, and partly by Liddesdale ; S. W. and W. by the pa- 
rishes of Hobkirk and Bedrule ; N. E. and E. by Jedburgh and 
Oxnam. 

In a parish of so great extent, it may well be expected that there 
will be a considerable diversity of soil. The lower parts consist ge- 
nerally of gravel, light black earth, and in some parts a strong clay. 
Along the river Jed, gravel prevails, inclining to heath. Towards 
the hills, and upon them, light earth, moss, and strong clay are preva- 
lent. The arable part of the parish is now considerably extended. 

Climate, Sfc. — The climate varies greatly. While the upper 
part of the parish is cold and stormy, the lower is sheltered and 
mild. It is, however, throughout its whole extent remarkably heal- 
thy. There is at present one person upon the pauper list, consider- 
ably above ninety. One also above that age died only a few months 
ago ; and there are several others above eighty. 

Diseases formerly prevalent in this district are now greatly mi- 
tigated, if not entirely removed. Those arising from dampness of 
climate, such as ague and rheumatism, have almost disappeared, 
owing, no doubt, to the extensive draining of sheep pasture, as well 
as the more general use of flannel. Typhus fever and inflamma- 
tory complaints have, however, proportionally increased. 

Mineralogy. — In regard to minerals, it may be observed, that a 
seam of antimony was discovered many years ago on the estate of 
Abbotrule, but after several attempts to work it, it was ultimately 



SOUTTIDEAN. 99 

abandoned. Coal has also been searched for on this side of the 
border hills, but hitherto without success. Strong symptoms have 
indeed been discovered of coal being at no great distance, yet they 
were not such as to warrant expensive experiments. Fresh attempts 
are at present making to procure coal on the lands of Lord Doug- 
las, and I believe with some hope of success, though the result 
is not yet ascertained. 

Trees, fyc. — There is a hawthorn tree in a garden here, which, 
on account of its great size, connected with other circumstances, is 
worthy of notice. The proportions of it are as follows : — Root, 
5 feet, 2 inches ; centre, 4 feet, 1\ inches ; below branches, 6 
feet, 2 inches ; mean girth, 5 feet, 4 inches ; principal branches, 
first branch, 2 feet, 11 inches; second branch, 2 feet, 10 inches; 
mean girth, 5 feet, 9 inches. 

One reason for mentioning this hawthorn tree is the very strong 
presumption that it existed in the days of James Thomson, the 
poet, who, as we have observed, spent on this spot a considerable 
period of childhood and of youth. This we are led to conclude 
from the very slow growth of the hawthorn, and the many days and 
years which must have passed before it could reach the size we 
have described. It therefore carries us back in imagination to the 
early days of the poet of Nature. 

The remains of the ancient and extensive Jed forest are still 
visible in large oak trees laid bare by the action of the streams, 
and in the digging of deep ditches on various farms. One partly 
discovered in a water-course at the head of the Jed, was Si feet 
in diameter. What is further remarkable in this is, that it was 
found high up among the moors, where scarcely a shrub of the 
hardiest kind could now be expected to thrive. 

II. — Civil History.  
Under this head, it may be remarked, that the Rev. Mr Veitch 
and Mr Bryson, as related by Dr M'Crie, found shelter among the 

• In this country it is universally believed, that the original of Dandy Dinmont 
was the late Mr James Davidson, farmer of Hyndlee, whose enthusiastic love of the 
chace was so well known. Mr Davidson's terriers were designated by the names of 
Pepper and Mustard, long previous to the publication of the novel. The farm of 
1 1 y ndlee, too, is situated in the pass which leads into Liddesdale to the wastes of Nor- 
thumberland and Cumberland, through the latter of which Dandy and his young 
friend had to find their way from Carlisle, and in which they had so serious a ren- 
counter. Indeed, part of the present road from and to Liddesdale is called Note o' 
the Oate, the very spot specified by Sir Walter as having been passed over on their 
way to Dandy Dmmont's.. Again, not many miles from Hyndlee, one of the farms 
at the head of Liddesdale is called to this day Thorleshope, evidently a corruption of 
Charheshope, mentioned in Guy Manncring as the residence of Dandy. All these 
circumstances, with his known character combined, leave no doubt that Mr David- 
son was the original, in the eye of Sir Walter, in drawing the character of Dandy.

fastnesses at one of the extremities of this parish ; and no place 
could be so. well adapted for this purpose in the perilous and blood 
times of the persecution of our church. 

Antiquities. — Tumuli or cairns, formerly prevalent in this parish, 
have now almost disappeared. There are still the ruins and some 
of these to a considerable extent of ancient strongholds, or peels, 
as they are called. There remain, too, the sites of ancient en- 
campments; which are of a circular form. 

Eminent Men. — James Thomson, author of the Seasons, spent 
much of his childhood and youth in this parish. His father was 
minister of Ednam, near Kelso, at the time of the poet's birth, but 
was translated to Southdean two years after that event. His 
tombstone is still in this churchyard. 

III. — Population. 

Since the beginning of last century, the population has greatly 
decreased, owing to the land being let in more extensive farms.

There are only four heritors in the parish, all of whom reside 
in it except Lord Douglas, the principal heritor, who keeps a re- 
sident factor on his property here. James Elliot, Esq. of Wolf- 
lee, and Robert Henderson, Esq. of Abbotsrule, are heritors to a 
pretty considerable extent, and both men of independent fortune. 

Character, &amp;fc. of the People. — The character of the people is 
peceable and religious. They are not given to poaching nor smug- 
gling ; but large and lawless bands of poachers have infested our 
moors for two years past. Our people are generally stout, healthy, 
and active. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — All kinds of grain are culti- 
vated to a much greater extent than at the time of the last Sta- 
tistical Account. From appearances, however, cultivation seems 
to have been more general in the higher parts of he parish, in 



SOUTHDE AN. 



101 



times long past, than even at present. This may have been ow- 
ing- to the lower ground having been more wooded and marshy, 
which would naturally constrain the people to cultivate the higher 
districts. 

The number of acres under cultivation at this time may be reck- 
oned at 3000. There are 500 acres under wood, natural and 
planted, principally pine. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of arable land, per acre, is 
about 18s. The average rent of grazing, per ox or cow, 30s., and 
for ewe or full-grown sheep, 5s., pastured for the year. Valued 
rent of the parish is L. 6362; real, L. 6690, 9s. 6d. There are 
twenty larger and eighteen small tenants. 

Husbandry. — The general duration of leases are from five to 
nineteen years. A good deal of wood has been planted of late, 
and considerable improvement has been made in farm-houses and 
the building of stone fences. Wheat is now pretty generally sown, 
especially in the lower parts of the parish ; and turnip husbandry 
has been greatly extended since the beginning of this century. It 
has of late years been much injured by a disease, which throws out 
excrescences from the root, which entirely destroy the turnip. No 
effectual remedy has hitherto been discovered. 

Live-Stock. — Since the close of the last century, considerable 
improvement has been made in the management of sheep. The 
land has been drained ; plantations and tills have been reared for 
shelter, whilst farmers have vied with one another in selecting the 
best ewes and rams from their own flocks, or from those of their neigh- 
bours, from which they may breed. About twenty-eight years ago, 
a few long-woolled sheep were brought into the parish. They have 
increased with the extension of tillage, and now amount to at least 
1600. There are about 15,100 of Cheviot sheep. In the year 
1810, the current price of laid wool was L. 2, 6s. per stone of 24 
lbs. One large clip was sold at L. 2, 10s. ; the same parcel has seve- 
ral times since been sold at less than one-fourth of that sum. Dur- 
ing the war, well salved wool was of as much value as white ; of 

course, all the Cheviot sheep were then smeared. With the peace, 
a change took place, and almost every person left off smearing till 
two years ago, when the demand for laid wool reviving, induced 
various individuals to have again recourse to tar and butter. Wool 
was much in request in 1831. White brought from L. 1, 3s. to 
L. 1, 7s., and laid from 18s. 6d. to L. 1, Is. per stone, which was 
nearly double the price obtained for the latter sort in 1830. A 
large proportion of the wool grown in this quarter is now manufac.

Within the last twenty years, black-cattle have been much bet- 
ter kept than used to be the case, — which, with the introduction of 
short-horned bulls from the south, has improved the breed in no 
ordinary degree. The cattle in the parish may be estimated at 
390, and the horses at 145. 

Quarries. — These consist, and in abundance, of red and white 
sandstone, the last of which is admirably adapted for ornamental 
buildings. 

Produce. — The average gross amount and value of raw produce 
yearly raised in the parish, exclusive of pasture, as nearly as can 
be ascertained, is as follows : 

Corn, - - L. 3600 0 0 

Turnips, 400 acres, at L. 4, 1600 0 0 

Potatoes, 80 acres, at L. 7, 560 0 0

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Toions,Sfc. — Jedburgh, our nearest post-town, is distant 
ten miles. The inconvenience, however, is lessened by the recent 
improvement in the roads. The road passing between Hawick and 
Newcastle, is a great accommodation to this part of the country, 
as well as that between Jedburgh and Newcastle, both of which 
meet at the extremity of the parish. The coach, Chevy Chace, 
passes and repasses through Jedburgh between Edinburgh and 
Newcastle every day. It enters England at the Carter Bar. 
There is perhaps no entrance to Scotland more picturesque than 
the one of which we now speak. In this road from England, the 
border hills rise to a considerable height ; and, as the first glimpse 
that is caught of Roxburghshire is from the top of the Carter, there 
is suddenly opened to the eye an extensive and beautiful landscape. 
In this landscape is comprehended, not only Roxburghshire, lying 
more immediately before us, with all its hills and dales, but also, 
though in the distance, many parts of Selkirkshire and Berwick- 
shire. As the road descends, the view is naturally more limited, 
but not less beautiful. It varies along the banks of the Jed with 
every turning and winding of the stream. Its high and precipitous 
banks are everywhere clothed with wood, of oak, pine, and weep- 
ing birch. These, with dwelling after dwelling imbedded in its 
more sheltered nooks, present to the delighted traveller a rich va- 
riety of scenery. This view is no doubt greatly enhanced by the

uninteresting country which must be traversed before entering into 
Scotland. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The patronage of the parish is partly in- 
vested in the Crown, and partly in Lord Douglas. By a question 
raised at the death of the late incumbent, it is understood that his 
Lordship enjoys two returns in succession ; the Crown one. This 
is owing to his Lordship having been patron of Southdean pre- 
vious to the annexation of a portion of Abbotsrule, which was sup- 
pressed above fifty years ago, and of which the Crown was pati'on. 

The stipend consists of 16 chalders of victual, half meal and 
half barley. There is a sum of L. 9, 14s. 6d. allotted for the 
provision of communion elements. The glebe is 40 acres in ex- 
tent, and may be rented at L. 40 per annum. The church was 
built in the year 1690 ; it has, since that period, undergone many 
repairs, and it is now in excellent condition. The present manse 
was erected on the site of the old one in 1795. A considerable 
addition has been just completed, which renders it in every way 
a most excellent and commodious dwelling. There are about 30 
families of Dissenters in the parish. 

Education. — The school- room is in a tolerable state of repair. 
The schoolmaster is accommodated with a house and garden, and 
the salary is the maximum. His fees may amount to about L. 16 
a-year. The average number of scholars is 67, the greater pro- 
portion of whom only attend reading, writing, and the more sim- 
ple rules of arithmetic. There is no other school in the parish; but 
those who are too distant to attend here, are conveniently enough 
situated for attending schools in other parishes. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of paupers is 25. The 
whole rates amount to L. 160, — chiefly from assessment, but partly 
from church collections. 

Inns. — There is but one alehouse in this parish, and that at 
the extremity of it, at the Carter toll-bar. 

Fuel. — Coal is the principal fuel now in use. The nearest pit 
is fifteen miles distant. They are 7d. a bag, four and a-half of 
which make a cart load. The carriage to this place costs 6s. 6d. 
Peats are not so generally used as they once were, and turf is 
scarcely ever made use of now for fuel. 

It may he proper here to mention, as relating to this parish, that the scone of 
Reidswire, the last border battle, lies along the range of the Carter-hills, near the 
Carter Bar. These hills, by the last measurement, are computed to be '2020 feet 
above the level of the sea. The raid of Reidswire has been too often related to re- 
quire any account of it here. It may be sufficient to refer to the description in the 
Border Minstrelsy, Vol. iii. p. 1.54.

PRESBYTERY OF SELKIRK, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. GEORGE RITCHIE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — In ecclesiastical records, this parish is generally design- 
ed St Boswell's, but elsewhere it is more usually named Lessud- 
den. In point of fact, the one is the name of the parish, the other 
of a village, which occasionally gives its name to the parish, as con- 
taining the great bulk of the population. The church is suppos- 
ed to derive its name from Boisel, a monk of Melrose, and subse- 
quently Prior of the monastery, — the pious master of the cele- 
brated St Cuthbert, — and, if not the founder, at least one of the 
earliest religious functionaries, of-the parish. The saint lent his 
name to a village also, which seems to have been of considerable 
extent in its day, but of which now scarcely one stone remains on 
another. 

Extent, Boundaries. — This parish is of small dimensions, being 
3 miles in length by 1§ in breadth, and forming an area of 4 
square miles, of an oblong figure : it is bounded on the north by the 
river Tweed; on the east by the parish of Maxton; on the south by 
Ancrum ; and on the west by Bowden and Melrose. 

Topographical Appearances. — The surface in the upper por- 
tion of the parish is undulating, rising into ridges or small emi- 
nences, with hollows or flats intervening. The lower grounds, 
however, approaching the Tweed, are more free from inequali- 
ties. The banks of the river, with the exception of the north- 
east boundary, are bold, precipitous, and well-wooded. To the 
north of the village of Lessudden, there is an elevated ridge over- 
looking the Abbey of Dryburgh, embosomed in wood, and en- 
circled by the Tweed, where the prospect in every direction em- 
braces a variety of objects that can scarcely be rivalled in beauty 
and grandeur. Although this eminence is immediately adjoining

to the village, yet, from the sudden acclivity of the ground, there 
are scarcely any of the houses in sight, with the exception of Les- 
suden Place, — an old border strength belonging to the Scotts of 
Raeburn, which forms an appropriate accompaniment of the scene. 

From the range of hills and mountains both on the north and 
south, the climate is comparatively dry, and consequently healthy. 
The clouds coming either from the east or west, and here the 
wind seldom blows directly from the north or the south, range 
along the higher grounds, and pass over the intermediate flat lands 
in a rarer state. In dry seasons, this is often felt to an inconve- 
nient degree. The high grounds in the neighbourhood are, on 
such occasions, plentifully watered, while our fields are parched, 
and our crops languish. 

Hydrography. — The Tweed is the only stream worthy of notice 
connected with this parish, of which it forms the boundary for up- 
wards of two miles on the north and east. — The springs are all 
perennial, — so far intermittent, however, that many of them, in dry 
seasons, cease about the beginning of autumn. Near the village 
of Lessudden, where the soil is of a retentive nature, incumbent on 
what is here called till, gravel imbedded in clay, — springs are scarce, 
and the water indifferent. All the other parts of the parish are 
plentifully supplied with water of the purest quality. Around the 
glebe, in particular, to the east and south, there is an immense 
profusion of springs of the finest quality. The springs issue from 
a seam of gravel incumbent on freestone rock of a reddish colour : 
and many of them are strongly impregnated with lime, to which 
they owe their petrifying quality, which is common to all along the 
east bank, and to some in a very remarkable degree. There is also 
" the well brae wall," a chalybeate that has attracted some notice, 
from its reputed virtues in scorbutic complaints. From the south 
bank, again, issues the Hier, or sacred well, vulgarly called the 
Hare well. This well also still bears the name of the saint, and 
is situated farther to the west, on the same side of the ravine 
through which flows St Boswell's burn, receiving, in its progress 
to the Tweed, contributions from the " well brae." 

Geology and Mineralogy. — On this head, it may be only re- 
marked, that the soil in'general consists of a stiff clay; in the neigh- 
bourhood of the church, of a black loam ; and in the haughs adjoin- 
ing the Tweed, it is alluvial. The soil rests upon a mass of clay 
mixed with boulders of whinstone and gravel of considerable thick- 
ness, indicating the presence of some great current.

ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



The predominating rock is red sandstone, a good building stone. 
From the section of a quarry in the parish, it seems to rest upon a 
bed of whitish sandstone of some thickness. This variety pos- 
sesses considerable hardness, and is much impregnated with iron 
pyrites, as it assumes a dingy yellow colour after a short exposure 
to the atmosphere. There are several appearances of trap tuffa 
in the parish. An attempt was made several years ago to find coal, 
but without success. 

Zoology. — As there is nothing peculiar to the parish under this 
head, it may be only remarked, that the fruit trees, which suffer 
more or less every season, were last spring almost wholly stripped 
of their foliage by the caterpillar the Tortrix padella, for the ra- 
vages of which no practical remedy has hitherto been applied. 

The soil seems well adapted to all the ordinary kinds of forest 
trees. On the estate of Ellieston, there are some of the finest 
larch trees in the south of Scotland; none, however, of a very 
uncommon size. 

II. — Civil History. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners, in the order of the 
rates of their valued rents, are, Robert Tulloch, Esq. of Ellies- 
ton ; Alexander Kay, Esq. of Charlesfield j Thomas W. Ramsay, 
Esq. of Maxton ; William Scott, Esq. of Raeburn ; Captain Rid- 
dell Carr, of Camieston ; His Grace the Duke of Buccleuch ; 
Adam White, Esq. of Fens ; and Sir David Erskine of Dryburgh 
Abbey ; and eight other proprietors, all having landed properties 
of the yearly value of L. 50 and upwards. 

Parochial Registers. — The earliest parochial register commences 
in 1691 ; but the registers are neither voluminous, nor regularly 
kept. 

Modern Buildings. — His Grace the Duke of Buccleuch has re- 
cently erected a very handsome hunting establishment to the north 
of St Boswell's Green, which forms the only modern building of a 
public nature with the exception of the church deserving to find 
a place in this description. 

III. — Population. 

There is every reason to believe that the population of this pa- 
rish is at present greater than ever it was at any former period. 
This opinion is fully borne out by the following statement : 

Population in 1755, - 309 
1791, - 500 

1801, - 497 
1831, - 701 



ST BOSWELL'S. 



107 



The increase of population is chiefly to be ascribed to agricul- 
tural improvements, producing an increased demand for labourers ; 
and these in their turn requiring additional artisans for domestic 
manufactures. 

The hunting establishment of the Duke of Buccleuch, which 
has not yet had time to produce its full effect, will in all likelihood 
have a favourable influence on the population, from an increased 
circulation of money. Already the benefits arising from this estab- 
lishment have begun to be felt in the increased facility which it pre- 
sents to the agriculturists of selling their disposable produce in corn 
and hay. These causes combined, have raised the number of in- 
habitants residing in the village to 433, leaving for the country 268.

Character of the People. — The habits of the people, in regard 
to cleanliness, are decidedly and greatly improved, and, with a few 
exceptions, little seems to be wanting in that respect. At church 
there is generally an appearance of neatness and comfort ; and, in 
some instances, a display of finery that would do little discredit to 
persons occupying a higher sphere in society. They enjoy in no 
common degree the comforts of social life ; and never were the la- 
bourers and artisans in this parish better provided for than at pre- 
sent. 

The people are, generally speaking, sensible and shrewd, hav- 
ing few means of acquiring, and little occasion for exhibiting, any 
remarkable degree of intellectual attainment. There are instances, 
however, that go to prove, that it is the want of time and oppor- 
tunities of acquiring distinction in intellectual pursuits, and not the 
want of natural ability, that prevents a more striking developement 
of their mental powers. They may be morally characterized as 
sober, industrious, friendly and obliging in their manners, peaceable 
in their behavour, and honest in their dealings. 

Offences against the law, either in poaching or smuggling, are 
scarcely known among us. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture — The whole land in the parish amounts to 2600 



108 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



acres imperial, all arable, or capable of being made so, with the 
exception of about 25 acres of precipitous banks on Tweed, and the 
rivulets that run into it : and it is all occasionally under the plough, 

except St Boswell's Green, a divided common of about 40 acres, 

the lord of the manor retaining the right of holding a fair annually 
over the whole of the common. The land under plantation ex- 
tends to 175 acres. 

The trees generally planted are the Scotch fir, larch, spruce, 
and silver-fir : the hard-wood, oak, ash, elm, birch, plane, and 
horse-chestnut. As the plantations advance, the Scotch fir is first 
taken out, then the spruce, and lastly, the larch, to make room for 
the hard-wood. On the Ellieston estate, where the greatest ex- 
tent of plantation is found, the greater part of the Scotch firs have 
been displaced, and the oaks, constituting a large proportion of 
the hard-woods, being of seventy years growth, affords an abun- 
dant supply of excellent timber, and of a size fit for any use to 
which this species is usually applied. On the estate of Camieston 
also, there is a considerable extent of plantation, and wood of ex- 
cellent quality and considerable dimensions. The wood on that 
part of the Maxton estate included in this parish, planted twenty- 
two years ago, has made the most rapid progress, and forms the 
chief ornament of the lower division of the parish around the church 
and manse. It is a difficult matter to ascertain, with any degree 
of accuracy, the annual amount of sales of wood, from the ever- 
varying state of supply and demand. As nearly as can be ascer- 
tained, the sales amount to L. 150 per annum. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of arable land is L. 1, 4s. 2d. 
per imperial acre. The grazing of a full-grown cow or ox is L. 3, 3s. 
for the summer ; and for winter keep on straw and turnips, L. 2, 2s. 
The general rate for a ewe or full-grown sheep grazed for the year, 
is 14s. 

Husbandry— The general system of husbandry pursued in the 
parish is the four shift. 1st, Fallow, turnips or potatoes ; 2d, wheat, 
barley, or oats ; 3d, grass either cut for hay or pastured for one 
year ; 4th, generally oats. On the land of better quality near the 
village, there is sometimes a deviation from this routine: and it is not 
uncommon to take a crop of drilled beans or pease after the oats 
and apply manure, followed by wheat or barley. In some of the 
leases lately entered into, the five-shift rotation is prescribed, re- 
quiring two successive years in grass. This is certainly more fa- 
vourable for the land, and perhaps little disadvantageous to the 



ST BOSWELL'S. 



109 



occupier, the former system requiring the application of more dung 
than can be readily procured : and lime, from its great distance, en- 
tails always a heavy and sometimes a ruinous expense on the tenant. 
These reasons have led, for the two last seasons, to the application 
of bone-manure to turnips, and this substitute has been found on 
the whole to be attended by a very favourable result, although it is 
alleged that it does not succeed so well on wet soils when the 
season is damp. The use of this manure, if it shall be found ul- 
timately to realize the expectations which are now entertained of 
its efficacy, will be of great advantage to agriculture in this part of 
the country, from the comparatively trifling expense at which it can 
be laid down on the land, 22s. 6d. a quarter, and the small quan- 
tity required per acre, two quarters being the usual allowance to 
the imperial acre. As a great proportion of the land in the 
parish is a stiff clay on a retentive bottom, draining is an improve- 
ment of the first importance. Much has already been done in 
this way, and more would be done if proprietors were a little more 
liberal in their encouragement to the skilful and industrious tenant. 

Little has been done in the way of embanking. Two embank- 
ments, however, of considerable extent, along the Tweed, have 
been constructed during the last season ; the one on Mr White's 
farm of Fens, and the other on Mr Ramsay's farm of St Boswell's. 
The general duration of leases is for nineteen years. 

The farm-houses and steadings on the larger farms are in ge- 
neral good and commodious ; on the smaller, both are very indiffe- 
rent, and no way suitable to the farms. The fences in the parish 
which is all enclosed consist of thorn hedges, in general well 
kept. 

The chief obstacle to the improvement of land here is, the 
great distance from lime, — not less than twenty-six miles. A 
single horse cartful, containing twelve bushels, costs, when laid 
down on the land, 13s. which, at the rate of eight cartfuls, the 
quantity usually applied to the acre, occasions an expense of 
L. 5, 4s. This heavy expense can only be alleviated by in- 
creased facilities for land-carriage. A rail-road either from Dal- 
keith to Galashiels, or from Berwick to St Boswell's Green, both 
of which lines have been surveyed and favourably reported of, 
would greatly tend to the improvement of land, the increase of 
manufactures, and the rise of rents. Another obstacle to the im- 
provement of land, greatly, and, we believe, justly, complained of 
is, the practice but too common of advertising and letting land to 



U0 ROXBURGHSHIRE. 

the highest offerer, without due regard being had to his circum- 
stances, provided he agree to an extravagant rent, which a man 
that has little or nothing to lose will not scruple to offer. The 
working of this system is extremely injurious to the proprietor, 
and to honest men of some capital, who really intend to pay the 
rent for which they stipulate. The tenant enters on possession, 
and perhaps struggles on for a year or two, applies for a reduction 
of rent, which must be conceded, or the farm again brought into 
the market in a deteriorated state. If the reduction is sufficiently 
great to enable him to exist, he may languish on to the end of the 
lease, if not, he must relinquish the lease after he has ruined the 
land, and, in either case, the farm must be re-let at a rent far in- 
ferior to what a good substantial tenant would have originally pro- 
mised and paid during the currency of a long lease.

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town. — The nearest market-town is Melrose, distant 
nearly five miles. 

Villages. — The plough occasionally turns up the hearth or foun- 
dation stones of the ancient village of St Boswell's, which long 
since, like the hands that raised it, has crumbled into dust, with 
scarcely a memorial of its former existence. The village of Les- 
sudden lies about three quarters of a mile to the north-west, and 
can boast of considerable antiquity. But, what is of much greater 
consequence to the present generation, nothing can exceed the 
amenity of its situation, and the salubrity of its air. It derives 
its name from Edwin, the celebrated sovereign of Northumber- 
land, or more probably from some earlier prince of the same 
name, who had formed a settlement here and built a fortlet. In 
the former Statistical Account, the name is said to have been 
given to this village by Bishop Aiclan, whose place, Less or 
Lis, it was. But the chartularies of the twelfth, and the two 
following centuries, as cited by Chalmers, Caledonia, Vol. ii. 



ST BOSWELL'S. 



Ill 



p. 180, all spell the name of the village Lessedwin, Lessadwin, 
or Lessedewynj i. e. the manor place of Edwin. During the reign 
of William the Lion, Robert de Loudonia, the lord of the manor, 
granted to the monks of Dryburgh the church of Lessedwin, for 
the safety of the souls of his king, of his father, Richard de Lou- 
donia, and his mother, Matildis de Ferrers. In 1221, Lessedwin 
was settled by Alexander II. on Johanna, his queen, as part of her 
jointure. Robert I. granted to the monks of Melrose the lands of 
Lessedwin. The English of the middle march, on the 5th of No- 
vember 1544, burnt Lessedwin, wherein was sixteen strong bastel 
houses, slew several of the owners, and destroyed much corn. 

Means of Communication. — The means of communication are 
most abundant; the post-office communicating with Kelso and 
Melrose once a-day ; a daily coach from Newcastle to Edinburgh ; 
a coach every alternate day from Jedburgh to Edinburgh, except 
Sundays ; a daily coach during the summer and autumn, and in 
winter thrice a-vveek, from Kelso to Glasgow ; two carriers weekly 
to Kelso and Selkirk, and one to Edinburgh weekly. 

The length' of turnpike-roads is inconsiderable : the Jedburgh 
turnpike 1, Kelso 1, and Selkirk 2- miles. The bridges are 
four, on a small scale, but in excellent repair. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is situated near the eastern 
boundary of the parish, and consequently three miles distant from the 
population residing at the other extremity : but as the population there 
is scanty, and the great bulk of the inhabitants reside in the village 
of Lessudden, or in the immediate vicinity of the church, it cannot 
be said to be inconveniently situated for the great body of the 
people. From a stone in the front, it would appear that the present 
church, which is situated a little to the west of the site, still dis- 
cernible, of a more ancient fabric, was built in 1652; although it 
is possible this stone may have belonged to the former place of 
worship. The present building was thoroughly repaired in 1791, 
enlarged in 1824, and now forms a commodious place of worship. 
It is understood to accommodate about 300 persons. There are not 
more than half a dozen of free sittings, — by which are meant sit- 
tings set apart for the poor. In a certain sense they are all free, 
seat-rent being wholly unknown. Number of families belonging 
to the Established church, 118; of persons, 615 ; of Dissenters, 86, 
including children. The number of communicants ranges from

220 to 234. Average amount of collections, L. 17, 0s. lOAd.; 
occasional donations L. 9, 18s. 4d.; proclamations, lis. Hd.; and 
mortcloth money 16s.; total, L. 28, 7s. There are only two in- 
stances on record of important benefactions, and both by the 
same individual, Robert Scott, Esq. late of Penang. 1st, A 
donation of L. 100 Sterling, the interest of which is to be applied 
for the relief of indigent persons belonging to the parish : the 
trustees are his brother, the present laird of Raeburn, and the 
minister of the parish. 2c, Mr Scott last year invested the pro- 
perty of a field in the vicinity of the village, amounting to about 
5 acres, in the heritors of the parish possessed of L. 100 Scots 
valuation, and the minister, — the proceeds to be applied to the re- 
lief of indigent persons not on the poor's roll. 

The manse and offices were built in 1791 ; but as the work had 
been executed in a very superficial manner, and on a defective 
plan, the heritors laid out a very considerable sum on repairs and 
additions in 1811. The whole is now in good condition. The ex- 
tent of the glebe is 7 acres imperial; and the quality of the soil ex- 
cellent; value L. 2, 10s. per acre. The stipend amounts to 15 chal- 
ders meal and barley, in equal portions, with L. 6, 6s. 8d. for com- 
munion elements. 

Education. — There is but one school, in which the following 
branches are taught : English 2s. per quarter ; writing 3s. ; arith- 
metic, 4s. ; book-keeping and practical mathematics, 5s. : Latin, 
Greek, and French, 6s. per quarter. The schoolmaster has the 
legal accommodation, and the minimum salary; the school fees ave- 
rage about L. 40 a-year. 

Library. — A subscription library, instituted in 1799, under the 
patronage of Sir David Erskine, of Dryburgh Abbey, and now 
amounting to 1000 volumes, forms the only literary establishment 
in the parish. 

Poor, fyc. — Average number receiving aid 14, including children. 
Sum allowed to each per week, from 3s. 9d. to Is. 6d. Average 
annual assessment for the poor, L. 62, 19s. 4d. Collections, &amp;c. 
with occasional donations, L. 28, 7s. That spirit of honest pride 
and independence which formerly characterized our Scottish pea- 
santry is rapidly diminishing, and the discredit once attached to 
pauperism has, in these times, been wiped away, as one of those 
antiquated prejudices that never had any rational foundation. 
There are, however, still some lingering remains of a better spirit. 

Fair. — St Boswell's fair is the only one held in this parish : 



ST BOSWELl/s. 



113 



it takes place on the 18th of July annually, or on the following 
Monday, if the 18th fall on a Sunday. When held on a Mon- 
day it is justly thought to occasion a most offensive desecration of 
the Lord's day; nor is this disgusting profanation at all diminished 
when the fair holds on a Saturday. This evil, so justly complain - 
ed of, might be easily corrected by holding the fair on the third 
Wednesday or Thursday of the month. This fair is looked for- 
ward to with much excitement among the youthful population, and 
an immense concourse of people assemble from all quarters for 
business or amusement : and if the day is fine, St Boswell's Green 
presents on this occasion a very gay and animated scene. The 
whole space being planted with tents, covered with a profusion of 
goods, consisting of Scotch and Irish linen, hardware, toys, croc-' 
kery, shoes, books, &amp;c. or crowded with sheep, lambs, horses, and 
horned cattle. My predecessor estimates the amount of the money 
transactions of the day from L. 8,000 to L. 10,000, and the toll or 
custom, which belongs to the Duke of Buccleuch, at L. 38 on an 
average. This is probably not far from the truth, though it has 
been thought that this great fair has not of late been so numerously 
attended as in former years, owing to the number of other markets 
that have recently been established elsewhere for the sale of stock. 

Fuel. — Coal is almost the only species of fuel used in this pa- 
rish. There are no peats. Wood is scarce, and consequently 
high-priced. And when it is considered that we are equidistant 
from the Scotch and English collieries, it is manifest that the price 
of fuel must be high. Our coal is brought either from the neigh- 
bourhood of Dalkeith, or the collieries in Northumberland. The 
price, however, has for some years been greatly reduced. Coals 
from Vogrie, the species in highest estimation, used to cost from 
18d. to 20d. a cwt. the writer has paid as high as Is. lOd. but 
can now be bought for Is. a-cwt.- Lothian coals, and for lOd. a-cwt. 
from the English collieries. 

Inns — There are no fewer than six inns or alehouses in the pa- 
rish, and without doubt, however well regulated, they present far 
too great a facility to dissipation ; and unquestionably the num- 
ber ought to be diminished. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The first most striking fact that occurs on comparing the former 
with the present Statistical Account of this parish, is the increase 
of the population, which has been considerably more than one- 
third in less than forty years. A second point of comparison, 

ROXBURGH. . H 



114 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



scarcely less striking, is the amount of production, and the increas- 
ed rental. The rental, including the annual sale of wood, L. 150, 
amounts to L. 3080, 4s. 2d. : in 1794, it is supposed to have been 
L. 1700, — there being thus a difference of L. 1380, 4s. 2d. When 
it is considered that prices are fully lower at present than they 
were then, the whole of the increased rental and production must 
be ascribed to improved cultivation. 

The only other point of comparison deserving to be noticed is 
suggested by the great increase of the amount of money raised for 
support of the poor. The number of paupers has increased in a 
greater ratio than the population. The number on the roll in 
1794 is stated to be only three; this, however, was the actual 
number enrolled for that year, and said to be fewer than usual. 
At present the number is fourteen, being nearly five to one. The 
amount of assessment, collections, &amp;c. taken together, give L. 18, 
12s. expended for the support of the poor at the former period. 
Now, the whole aggregate sum is L. 91, 6s. 4d. being nearly in 
the same ratio. These facts place in a striking point of view the 
strong tendency to increase which pauperism manifests wherever 
a legal assessment has been established It would, however, be 
unfair to suppress some mitigating circumstances which tend to 
diminish the apparent difference between the former and present 
state of our parochial funds. In 1831 and 1832, the general ave- 
rage was greatly raised by an extraordinary expenditure, occasioned 
by the measures adopted to guard against the introduction of cho- 
lera. The precautions for these two years incurred an expense of 
not less than L. 60 for increased allowance, for food, fuel, and 
clothing, — medicine, and cleaning the village, and intercepting va- 
grants. The increased funds, arising from collections, donations, 
&amp;c. have induced us to extend our aid beyond the range of actual 
pauperism, by a supply of coals, and occasional small donations 
to industrious families in distress, as well as to the enrolled poor. 
And the great bulk of the session funds is expended in this way 
annually.

PRESBYTERY OF SELKIRK, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. JOHN THOMSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — Maccus was a person of some note in the reign of Da- 
vid I. betwixt the years 1116 and 1147. His tun or manor was 
called Maccus-ton, afterwards Mackiston, and now Maxton. 

Extent, Boundaries, fyc. — The parish of Maxton is in figure 
nearly an oblong. Its extreme length is about 4 miles, and its 
greatest breadth nearly 3 ; but its square contents do not much ex- 
ceed 7 miles. It lies on the south bank of the Tweed, and is one 
gentle slope towards that river, which runs 3 miles along its north- 
ern boundary. The parish of St BoswelPs bounds it on the north- 
west, the parish of Ancrum on the west, and Roxburgh on the 
south and east. 

Hydrography.— Except the Tweed there is not a stream in the 
parish; but there is no want of fine perennial springs, — though the 
inhabitants have not hitherto profited much by this circumstance, 
their habitations being in no instance placed within reach of them. 
The water commonly used is drawn from wells from fifteen to thir- 
ty feet deep ; and having percolated through clay, the water is al- 
ways very hard. 

The Tweed runs here on a bed of reddish sandstone, which also 
makes its appearance in the steep banks, and serves for building, 
though much of it does not stand well exposure to the weather. 
Masses of whinstone rise in three or four places on the banks of 
the river; and in the southern parts of the parish, this stone abounds, 
both as rock and in rolled blocks on the surface, which make ex- 
cellent road-metal, being excessively hard, and binding well when 
broken small. 

Soil.— On many acres in the southern and highest part of the pa- 
rish, the soil is thin, wet, and unproductive. The sub-soil is a still' 
retentive till, mixed with stones. The northern, and by far ho 
largest part, is of a much better quality, and bears heavy crops of 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



wheat, barley, oats, pease, beans, clover, turnips, and potatoes. 
In the western half of this division, the soil is a rich clay-loam on 
a till bottom ; in the eastern, it is light, sharp, and dry, on a free- 
stone or gravel bed. 

Zoology. — About eighteen or twenty years ago, a small fly was 
first noticed in this part of the country very like the common house- 
fly, but somewhat lighter in the colour, and nimbler in its motions, 
and furnished with a long sharp proboscis, which it darts into 
the skin of men and animals in a moment, causing considerable 
pain. A silk or worsted stocking is no protection from its attacks. 
But troublesome as this little animal sometimes is, it is innocence 
itself compared with another, to whose insidious ravages we have 
.now been exposed for several seasons, from about the middle of 
August till the end of harvest. This enemy is very small : when 
viewed by the microscope, it appears of a red colour, and resembles 
a spider in its form ; but nobody can go among long grass or bushes 
after it comes, without being stung all over the body, particularly 
in those places where the clothes sit close to the person, so as to 
stop the creatures progress under them. Its wounds are not felt 
at the time they are inflicted, but the part soon becomes exces- 
sively itchy, swells to the size of a pea or bean, and continues to tor- 
ment the victim for several days, or perhaps weeks. It is curious that 
there are some fields and districts in the neighbourhood where, it 
is said, this plague is not felt, though no plausible reason can be 
assigned for the fact. 

II. — Civil History. 
The civil history of Maxton presents little that is interesting. 
Its origin may be traced to the beginning of the twelfth cen- 
tury. Towards the end of that century the monks of Melrose 
obtained from Robert de Berkely and his spouse " a caracute 
of land" in this parish, with certain privileges of pasture on 
the common, and fuel both from the peataria and the wood, 
" for the safety of many souls." As a composition for the tithes 
of this land, the monks agreed to pay to the parson of Makiston 
four merks of silver yearly. Hugh de Normanville married Alice, 
the daughter and heiress of Robert de Berkely, and the line of the 
Normanvilles was continued through the thirteenth century. At 
a later period, the barony of Makiston, having been forfeited by 
William Soulis, was given by Robert I. to Walter, the steward of 
Scotland, who granted the patronage of his church, with five 
acres of arable land contiguous to the church, to the monks of 



MAXTON. 



117 



Dryburgh ; and from that time to the dissolution of their society at 
the Reformation, the parish continued to be a dependency of that 
monastery in spiritual matters. Robert II. granted the manor of 
Makiston to Sir Duncan Wallace and Eleanor de Brueys, the 
Countess of Carrick. 

When Scotland was a separate kingdom, the village of Maxton 
seems to have contained a very considerable population,' — being 
able, is is said, to turn out 1000 fighting men. If it .really ever 
was a place of such magnitude, it seems probable that the people 
subsisted, like many other communities of the same kind on the 
border, by alternately plundering and smuggling in the richer 
kingdom of England. Both these sources of wealth were speed- 
ily dried up, however, by the union of the Scotch and English 
crowns, — an event which introduced law and regular industry 
among the border clans, and soon reduced their numbers to a 
correspondence with their honest means of subsistence. . The vil- 
lage of Maxton is now reduced to a few miserable cottages. The 
only marks of its former consequence that remain, are the founda- 
tions of its houses, which are still occasionally turned up by the 
plough in several of the neighbouring fields, and the shaft of its 
ancient cross, which is yet standing in front of a few hovels, that 
mark the place where its principal street once was. 

Land-owners. — I have not heard of any person connected with 
Maxton whose name is known to fame. There are no ancient fa- 
milies in the place. The present proprietors are : Sir Edmund 
Antrobus ; Hugh Scott, Esq. of Harden ; the Duchess of Rox- 
burghe ; Adam Walker, Esq. of Muirhouselaw ; and Thomas Wil- 
liamson Ramsay, Esq. of Maxton. All these, or their families, except 
the Duchess of Roxburghe, bought their properties in this parish 
within the last fifty years. None of them reside, or have a man- 
sion-house in it, though the smallest proprietor, the Duchess of 
Roxburghe, has a rental in the parish of L. 250. 

Parochial Registers. — There is a " session-record" in existence, 
and a " register of births, marriages, and deaths both of which 
begin more than a hundred years back, but they have been very 
irregularly kept. Among a small rural population of simple man- 
ners, there have been few events requiring to be noticed in the 
former volume; and the latter is necessarily very imperfect, in con- 
sequence of Seceders and others declining to register. 

Antiquities. — In the north-east corner of the parish, is a rocky 
chff hanging over the Tweed, on which there are distinct traces 



118 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



of an ancient fort called, probably from its figure, Ringly Hall ; 
but whetber tbis fortification is to be regarded as of British or Ro- 
man origin, is disputed by antiquaries. It is nearly in the form 
of a circle, with a diameter of about 160 feet, defended on the 
north by the precipitous rock on which it stands, and the Tweed 
which washes its base ; and on the other sides it is secured by two 
deep ditches, and ramparts of earth dug out of them. There ap- 
pears to have been a gate on the east side, which faces a tumulus 
at no great distance, in the parish of Roxburgh, with which it was 
probably connected. The whole is now planted over with trees, 
which will no doubt have the effect of preserving this memorial of 
former times, for a while longer, from the ravages of the plough. 

There is a tradition, that in one of the wars so frequently car- 
ried on by the sister kingdoms of Scotland and England, but in 
which of them it is not said, the English army occupied this sta- 
tion for several clays, while the Scots lay on the opposite side of 
the river in a ravine, thence called " Scots Hole." The English 
at length, being superior in number, resolved to cross over to the 
enemy at a ford a little above this spot; and the Scots having attack- 
ed them on a rising ground, which is yet called the " Plea-brae," 
and while part of the army was still entangled in the stream, an 
obstinate battle ensued, in which the English were beaten, and 
many of them slain. Their bodies were buried in consecrated 
ground at a place on the south bank, thence called Rutherford, be- 
cause the Scots said their enemies had there been made to rue- 
their-ford. This must be an old story, for Rutherford was a con- 
siderable village, and went by this name at least several centuries ago. 
Long before the Reformation this place, and the territory around it, 
formed a distinct parish, which had a church and an hospital of its 
own. Of these buildings there are now no remains ; but the church- 
yard, which had long ceased to be a burying-place, was ploughed up 
only about twenty-five years ago, and the grave-stones were broken 
and thrown into drains by an improving farmer. The patronage 
of Rutherford, which at one time belonged to the Earls of Douglas, 
was granted before the year 1483, by James Rutherford of that 
Ilk ; but the church being afterwards suffered to go to ruin, the 
parish was united to Max ton, and the advowson fell into oblivion. 
The hospital was dedicated to St Mary Magdalene, and destined 
« for receiving strangers, and maintaining poor and infirm people." 
It was restored " to the master" by Edward I. in the year 1296, 

4 



MAXTON. 



119 



and granted by Robert I. to the canons of Jedburgh, and this grant 
was confirmed by Robert II. in 1395, 

About a mile to the west of the place where the village of Ru- 
therford formerly was, stand the ruins of Littledean Tower, beau- 
tifully situated on a high bank of the river, and once a place of 
some strength. It was long the residence of the Kerrs of Little- 
dean, — a family of some note on the borders ; but it was finally 
deserted by them about a century ago, since which time it has fal- 
len into complete decay. 

On a high ridge between the parishes of Maxton and Ancrum 
was fought the battle of Ancrum muir, in which the Scots, under 
the Earls of Arran and Angus, obtained a great victory over the 
forces of Henry VIII, commanded by Sir Ralph Rivers and Sir 
Bryan Laiton. A young female, called Lilliard, fought on the 
side of the Scots, like another Joan of Arc, and fell in this battle. 
She was buried on the spot, and a stone erected over her remains, 
which is yet standing, and in homely rhymes commemorates her 
desperate valour and untimely fate. The place yet retains the 
name of Lilliard's Edge. 

On the declivity of the hill, and near this place, are the vesti- 
ges of a Roman camp ; and close by the west side of it, there passes 
a Roman road, which crosses the Tiviot near the mouth of Jed 
water, and the Tweed near Melrose. This road goes along the 
whole western boundary of the parish, and in one part of its course 
is very entire, and planted over with trees, though in another it is 
now nearly, or rather altogether, obliterated by the operations of 
agriculture. 

III. — Population. 
It appears by the return made to Dr Webster in 1755, that the 
whole parish then contained only 397 souls. Twenty-seven years 
after, the number was reduced to 326. In 1801, the Parliamen- 
tary census states it at 368; in 1811, it was 438; in 1821, it had 
risen to 463 ; and in 1831, it was 461. As there are no towns, vil- 
lages, manufactories, or employment of any kind but on the several 
farms, the increase of population after 1782 must have been owing 
to the improved and more extended cultivation of the soil which took 
place after that time, and particularly to the introduction of the tur- 
nip husbandry, which requires the assistance of more hands than 
were wanted on the old system. In 1831, of the 461 inhabitants 
of the parish, there were,

The number of children under 15 being 187, and the number 
of families in which these are, being 59, the number of children 
to each family is 3 nearly. There is one person in the parish, 
insane, a pauper. 

The number of families in the parish is, - - - 89

Character ; 8fc. of the People. — The people in general are simple in 
their manners, sober, industrious, satisfied with their condition, and 
attentive to their religious and otherduties. They have, however, no 
religious, literary, economical, or political association among them. 
They are strangers to combination for any purpose whatever. They 
seem willing and pleased to do their duty, without waiting for the 
example or direction of the active stirring manager of some benevo- 
lent institution. If a good act may be done to a neighbour, the op- 
portunity of doing it is seldom neglected. If any one has been un- 
fortunate, or has fallen into distress, he is sure of the sympathy and 
active aid of those around him, and often to a greater extent than 
they can well afford. It is pleasing to see these kindly feelings 
continually showing themselves where there is evidently no motive 
but a desire to do to their brother as they verily believe, and could 
wish that, he would do to them. 

Among such a people, where luxury is unknown, and religion, 
in a great measure, performs the part of human institutions, many 
things are wanting which are thought indispensable in other places. 
Here, for example, they have no lawyer, no justice of the peace, 
not even a constable, no medical man, no exciseman, no pawn- 
broker, no post-office, no Seceder meeting-house, no tradesmen of 
any kind but two smiths, two wrights, two tailors, two fishermen, 
and one miller, all of whom are absolutely necessary to keep the ma- 
chinery of society in motion. There are, however, two public houses, 
which are certainly not of so indispensable a character. They are 

not wanted for the accommodation of travellers, and thev cannot 

3 



MAXTON. 



121 



but have a pernicious influence on the morals of those who are 
within the sphere of their influence. Satisfied of this, the mini- 
ster and every tenant in the parish presented a respectful petition 
to the justices of the district, praying that the licenses might no 
longer be renewed ; but their request was not attended to. It is 
not easy to see on what ground of expediency this refusal, on the 
part of our magistracy, can be justified. 

Smuggling is not known in the parish; neither is there much 
ground for complaint in regard to poaching. 

IV. — Industry. 

The parish contains 4514 acres. Of these 3827 are divided 
into convenient fields, substantially enclosed with thorn-hedges, 
and under a regular course of cropping, some portions in the four- 
shift husbandry, some in the five, and some in the six, according 
to the quality of the soil. 668 acres are planted. About ] 0 acres 
are an irreclaimable bog; and 9 is a fine pasture field, never 
ploughed, because sometimes it is flooded by the river. There 
are no commons, and no wastes. The plantations are all thriving, 
well attended to, and judiciously managed. Many sorts of timber 
are mixed up in them ; but the ash, the elm, the larch, and the 
oak, predominate, and seem to thrive best. The Scotch fir grows 
very well for a time, and serves as a nurse, but it does not attain to 
a great size. This is probably owing to a spurious kind not the 
true Scotch fir having been planted, rather than to any unfitness 
in the soil or climate for its growth. 

Rent of Land. — The rental of the parish cannot be exactly ascer- 
tained, because nearly 1000 acres, besides the plantations, are in the 
natural possession of proprietors. But supposing the arable part 
all let, the rent of the whole might be about L.3700, or 19s. 3d. 
per acre. If we value the wood at the same rate, and add L. 30 
more for the salmon fishings, we shall have a total rental of 
L. 4374. 

Live-Stock. — The cattle raised are for the most part of the short- 
horned breed, or crosses of them. The sheep are chiefly Leices- 
ter ; but there are also a few Cheviots, or crosses betwixt the two 
kinds. Much attention is paid to this part of farming, especially 
to the breeding and management of sheep. The keep of a cow 
per annum is valued at L. 6 or L. 7 ; of a sheep, at from 13s. to 
L. 1. 

Husbandry.— Much has been done of late years, and is now 
doing by all the tenants in the way of deep draining, which is at- 



122 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



tended with wonderful success, and seems to be the best foundation 
for every other improvement. A good deal of lime is annually 
driven, and bone-dust is coming every year into greater repute as 
a manure. 

The farmers are active, intelligent, enterprising, and industrious; 
and their exertions for the improvement of their farms have, in ge- 
neral, been liberally encouraged by their landlords. Their houses 
and steadings are substantial and convenient. The farmers have all 
thrashing mills, except one. Three of these are driven by a water 
power, and one is now erecting on Rutherford to go by steam. 
The leases are all for 19 years, — which is thought a short enough 
period when any improvement is intended to be made. The only 
subject of complaint among the tenants is the ruinously low price 
of corn, which makes it difficult for them to pay the rents which 
they promised only a few years ago, without encroaching on their 
capital. 

Rate of Wages. — The rate of labour, when it is not done by the 
piece, is 9s. or 10s. per week for men, without victuals. In harvest, 
a shearer has from 12s. to 14s. and victuals. A hind or ploughman is 
paid mostly in kind ; he has a house and a small garden, for which 
his wife, daughter, or servant shear in harvest ; 10 bolls 60 bushels 
of oats ; 3 bolls of barley, or 2J bolls of barley, and 1 boll of 
pease; from L.3 to L.4of sheep money; a cow's grass, or, when 
he is not rich enough to buy a cow, L. 7 in lieu of it ; 5 or 6 
single cart loads of coals, at the coal-hill price, 4s. or 4s. 6d. ; 
1000 yards of potatoes planted on the farm ; and 7 hens kept. A 
bondager, or female cottar, shears for hei house and garden ; has 
1000 yards of potatoes planted; 3 single cart-load of coals at the 
coal-hill price, and 7 hens kept. It is understood that she is to 
work to the farmer when required, at the ordinary rate of wages, 
viz. lOd. a-day in summer, and 8d. in winter. A carpenter's wage 
is 14s. a-week over the year. A mason has 15s. in summer, and 
lis. in winter. A smith has L. 2, 15s. or L. 3, and a single cart- 
load of coals, at the coal-hill price, for shoeing a pair of horses, 
and keeping a cart, plough, harrows, and harness in repair for a 
year. A tailor has Is. 6d. a-day and his victuals. 

Produce. — It is difficult to estimate precisely the amount of raw 
produce raised in any particular district, and more difficult still to 
ascertain its value. One very intelligent gentleman, to whom I 
applied for information on this point, and who himself farms be- 
tween fourteen and fifteen hundred acres in the parish, valued his 



MAXTON. 



123 



produce of grain on an average at L. 3000 a-year, and of other 
things at L. 2000 more. Estimating the produce of the other 
farms at this rate, it cannot be set down at less than L. 7000, — 
making the total value of produce in the parish, L. 12,000, without 
including gardens, woods, or fishings. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Means of Communication. — The parish of Max ton is situated at 
an equal distance from the three market-towns, Kelso, Jedburgh, 
and Melrose, — the middle of it being about seven miles from each. 
The turnpike betwixt Kelso and Melrose runs through the heart 
of the parish along its whole length; and the Edinburgh and Lon- 
don road by Jedburgh bounds the west end of it. Besides these, 
there are some cross roads, chiefly for the convenience of the seve- 
ral farm-steadings, and kept in tolerably good repair by the sta- 
tute-labour. One daily London and Edinburgh coach, by Jed- 
burgh, passes this parish ; and another, three times a-week, be- 
tween Edinburgh and Jedburgh. There is also a coach from Kelso 
to Glasgow by Melrose, Inverleithen, and Peebles, every day in 
summer, and three times a-week in winter. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is an old building, or rather 
a small fragment of an old building, which was dedicated to St 
Cuthbert. The date of its erection, or even of its dilapidation, 
is unknown. The family of the Maxwells of Pollok were origi- 
nally from the parish of Maxton. Their ancestors were once 
possessed of considerable property in this district, and appear 
to have been sheriffs of the county in the eleventh, twelfth, and 
thirteenth centuries. Mention is made of a donationary foun- 
dation by one of them, Herbert Maccuswell, in 1158, — which 
is by some supposed to be the church of Maxton ; and, no doubt, 
the building, from its appearance, may well be of that age : but 
the name of the founder would rather lead one to think that his 
gift was the church of Maxwell, which has long since gone to de- 
cay, — the parish thereof having been united to that of Kelso or 
Roxburgh. 

The church of Maxton is beautifully situated on a high bank 
of the Tweed, on the north-west verge of the parish, rather where 
the population once was than where it is now. Few of the inha- 
bitants, however, are more than three miles distant. 

This edifice was long suffered to continue in a very wretched 
state. Before 1792, it was thatched with broom, and its interior 
was not unsuitable to its outward appearance. In 1812 it was mo- 



1 



124 ROXBURGHSHIRE. 

demised and thoroughly repaired ; and though no great taste was 
displayed in its improvement, it is now a comfortable place of 
worship to the little congregation that resorts to it. It is seated 
to hold about 150, but accommodation might easily be made for 
fifty more if there were occasion for it. 

The manse was built about twenty-seven years ago, and is not 
unsuitable to the living, which is 14 chalders, half meal, half bar- 
ley, with a small sum for vicarage tithes and communion elements. 
The glebe is about 11 acres, which might be let, perhaps, for L. 18 
or L. 20. 

The ordinary church collections, with mortcloth and proclama- 
tion fees, and the interest of L. 72, which was mortified by Mr 
Smith, a former incumbent, may average about L. 8 per annum, 
which is all expended on parochial purposes. We have no extra- 
ordinary collections for foreign objects, — the money of the people 
being too much required at home ; yet I know they would not be 
backward in giving their mite, if called on to do so. I have been 
twenty-three years their minister, and never called on them for an 
extraordinary collection but once, for the Assembly's Highland 
schools, when I expected to get, perhaps, between L. 1, 10s. and 
L. 2 to shew our good-will to that benevolent scheme; but was 
surprised to receive upwards of L. 6. Not only the members of 
my own congregation, but the Seceders in the parish who could 
not attend on the occasion, sent their shillings and half-crowns. 
In 1831, there were 90 families in the parish; of these 21 were 
Seceders, and the rest belonged to the Establishment. But many 
of these families of both classes were divided among themselves, — 
part going to the church, and part to the meeting-house. 

Education. — The parochial school is the only one in the place. 
It is set down in a central situation, where all have easy access to 
it, and it is well attended. The children are all taught to read, 
write, and count ; there is none in the parish, old or young, who 
have not had this advantage; and yet, the general poverty of 
the parents obliges them to put their children soon to work, so 
that these useful accomplishments are often not so perfectly ac- 
quired as might be wished. The schoolmaster is an infirm old man, 
who retired from the school twenty-five years ago, retaining his 
house and garden, and a salary of L. 25, 13s. 3d. His assistant 
and successor has a house and salary of L. 20, 6s. 8d. from the 
heritors, and the school-fees averaging L. 20, Is. 5d. during the 
last three years. He has also L. 4, 4s. as clerk to the heritors, and

125 



L. 1, Is. as session-clerk. He teaches English grammatically, 
writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, practical mathematics, Latin, 
Greek, &amp;c. 

There is no public library in the parish ; but several families are 
connected with one in the neighbouring village of Lessudden. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The poor are maintained by regu- 
lar half-yearly assessments. The average number on the roll dur- 
ing the last four years is ten ; and the average yearly sum allotted 
to each is L. 5, 15s. 10d., — making in all L. 57, 19s. 9d., raised 
by assessment. There is, besides, a small sum from church col- 
lections, &amp;c. after paying precentor and kirk officers' fees, — the 
account of which may stand thus : from church collections, L. 4, 
6s. lOd. ; alms or legacies, L. 6, 19s. 7|d. ; proclamations, fines, 
&amp;c. 12s. 7d. ; interest of mortified money, L. 2, 18s. 2d. = L. 14, 
17s. 5|d. The deductions from this sum for precentor, beadle, 
&amp;c. may amount to L. 6, 5s. 6d. The honourable pride of the 
Scotch peasantry, which so long made them shrink from any appeal 
to public charity till compelled by stern necessity, is fast wearing 
out as legal assessments gain ground. An application for aid is no 
longer a sure indication of want on the part of the applicant. 

Fuel. — One of the greatest evils with which the poor have to 
struggle in this place is the expense of fuel. Except a few sticks 
from the young plantations, coals are the only material used for 
this purpose ; and these are brought for the most part from Nor- 
thumberland, burdened with a land-carriage of between twenty and 
thirty miles. They cost at present about lOd. per cwt. which, in 
consequence of the improvements in roads, &amp;c. is not more than 
half their price twenty years ago. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
In 1794 the Kelso turnpike road was made, which laid the foun- 
dation for all the subsequent improvements of this place. So late, 
however, as 1807 or 1808, there were very few inclosures in the pa- 
rish. By much the greater part of it was a bleak open waste, — in 
many places, covered with heath and large stones, with scarcely a 
tree to be seen, — and the tracks called roads, scarcely passable in 
wet weather. Now it is all inclosed with substantial and thriving 
hedges ; the stones that deformed its surface have been blown with 
gunpowder, and buried in drains or broken into road-metal; the 
fields are all under the plough, and adorned and sheltered with 
clumps and broad stripes of thriving plantations in spots judiciously 
selected for the purpose, and communications opened up in every

direction by excellent roads. So sudden, so complete, and so be- 
neficial a change in the aspect of a whole parish, has seldom hap- 
pened. Landlord and tenant most liberally combined their efforts 
to bring it about. But it is painful to think that their exertions 
have been so poorly rewarded. Owing to the sad depression of 
agricultural produce on the return of peace, the farmers never re- 
covered the capital which they had so liberally laid out on their 
improvements. Most of them were ruined and turned out of their 
farms ; some were put on the poor's roll ; and others sent to clear 
the wastes in Canada. The proprietors, instead of receiving the 
advances of rent from the new cultivators which they had reason 
to expect, were obliged to be content with a diminished rental, and 
are still, from time to time, constrained to submit with the best 
grace they can, to reductions in one shape or another, which are 
not less mortifying to the receiver than to the giver. 

The chief bar to farther improvement in this district is the great 
distance of sea-ports and markets. The farmer has not only 
to bring his own and his servants' coals from a distant pit, but his 
lime also has to be carried thirty miles or more : his groceries, fish, 
timber, iron, slates, bone-dust, and almost everything that he may 
want, have to be brought from Berwick or Leith, or places equally 
remote. Nor is the sale of his produce attended with much less 
trouble and expense. His fat stock, beef, mutton, and pork, have 
to be driven to Morpeth or Edinburgh : his young cattle are sent 
south to the English market : his corn carried to Dalkeith or Ber- 
wick : his poultry, eggs, butter, and cheese, conveyed to Berwick 
or Edinburgh. It is true, he may often effect his sales in the 
county market-towns, or at his own house : but in that case, he 
must submit to a reduction of price, sufficient, at least, to carry his 
produce to its ultimate destination. The only remedy for this evil 
seems to be an improved communication with the sea-port of Ber- 
wick, and the coal and lime districts in Northumberland by means 
of a railway. This, accordingly, has long been talked of.

PRESBYTERY OF KELSO, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. JAMES HOPE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — One conjecture as to the origin of the name of this 
parish is, that Roxburgh is a contraction for Rogue's burgh ; ano- 
ther, that it is a contraction for Rose burgh ; and for each, a special 
reason is alleged, viz. the character of its ancient inhabitants, and 
the beauty of its situation. Another conjecture is, that the name 
may be derived from Rox, a Saxon word, signifying strength : and 
another from the circumstance that, by Lord Hailes and others, it 
has been spelled Rokeshurgh. and Roches-burg. From the simi- 
larity of Rokes and Roches to Rok and Roch, a saint, it would 
seem, in the Romish calendar, the burgh of Roxburgh may have 
originally been dedicated to saint Rok or Roch,- — whence the 
name may have come. 

Extent, Boundaries, 8fc. — The parish extends about 8 miles 
in length, and in breadth varies from 1 to 5 miles. From the ex- 
tent thus given, a much larger number of square miles of surface 
might be inferred than it will be found to contain. There does 
not appear to be more than fourteen square miles. This circum- 
stance is accounted for by the irregular and peninsular form of the 
parish. The parish is bounded by Maxton, Ancrum, and Crailing 
on the west ; by Eckford on the south ; by Kelso on the east ; and 
by Kelso and Makerstoun on the north. 

 In the former Statistical Account of the parish of Kelso, it is mentioned, that 
Kelso parish consisted at one time of the parishes of Kelso, Maxwell, and St James'. 
This statement has frequently been repeated. Vide Haig, Morton, &amp;c. It appears 
to me, on the contrary, highly probable that neither the whole nor any considerable 
part of St James' was added to Kelso and Maxwell. From what I can learn, St 
James' was confined to the space betwixt the rivers of Tweed and Tiviot, and must 
have extended considerably westward, and embraced several farms which were made 
to constitute a part of Roxburgh parish. At all events, what now belongs to Kelso 
parish is limited to about thirty acres, forming a triangle above the junction of the 
rivers. The western boundary of this triangle is a line, extending from river to river, 
by the Trysting Tree and the foot of St James' Green. Thisportionof land commonly 
called the Kelso lands, is not under entail to his Grace the Duke of Roxburghe, and 
is not comprehended in the barony of Roxburgh. That the statement here given is 



128 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



The figure of the parish is extremely irregular, and has been 
compared to a spread eagle, with its head to the north, and its 
wings shadowing eastward and westward. 

Topographical Appearances. — The parish may in general be 
described as flat and low lying ; at the same time, there is a con- 
siderable unevenness or undulation of surface, which is occasioned 
by the Tiviot intersecting it from south-west to north-east, and 
the Tweed bounding it for several miles on the north. At the south- 
west end of the parish, there are two eminences or hills, supposed 
to be each about 500 feet above the level of the sea. The one is 
called Dunse-law, or Doun-law, in this parish ; and the other, im- 
mediately adjoining in Crailing parish, called Penel-heugh. From 
these eminences, two ridges gently slope to the eastward for seve- 
ral miles, and thereby exhibit an appearance as if formed by a 
current of water flowing parallel to the channel of the Tiviot. 
There are three caves in the parish, — at Sunlaws. The time 
when, and the purposes for which, these were excavated are not 
ascertained; but, from their appearance, they indicate a date 
not less than 1000 years ago, when incursions into this country 
were conducted with much desolation, rapine, and barbarity. 

Meteorology, fyc. — The climate of this district is equal, if not su- 
perior, to that of any inland part of Scotland. Its remarkable 
excellence depends on the fact, that there is less moisture than 
generally obtains in other districts. The cause of this appears to 
be, that the clouds, driven by the west winds which prevail, besides 
being exhausted in passing from the west to the east side of the 
island, are attracted by two ranges of hills, the Cheviot and Lam- 
mermoor, which, from a common point or centre, stretch to the 
east and north, and leave the large vale of Merse and Tiviotdale 
with comparatively little moisture. The heaviest rains are always 
from the east. It is probable, from the particular dryness of the 
atmosphere here, that it is warmer than in many other places of 
the same elevation, especially in wet seasons. 

Hydrography. — There are many excellent springs in the pa- 
rish, of which several have been found to be of a slightly petrify- 
ing quality. The rivers Tweed and Tiviot flow through part of 
it, and are its greatest ornaments. The quantity of water in the 

founded on fact, is proved by the cess-book of the county, which bears that the whole 
barony of Roxburgh belongs to the parish of Roxburgh, and by the circumstance, 
that all the public burdens, such as statute labour, poor rates, stipe nd. &amp;C. are charged 
for the parish of Roxburgh upon the whole barony and entailed lands thereof. 



ROXBURGH. 



129 



Tiviot appears to be not more than one-fourth of that of the 
Tweed. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The rocks found here are of the se- 
condary sandstone formation. Besides sandstone, there are va- 
rious trap rocks, such as basalt, greenstone, and wacke, &amp;c. 
The alluvial parts of the parish abound with large blocks of stone, 
which seem to have been rolled down from the two eminences, for- 
merly noticed, at the south-west end of the parish. The dip or 
inclination of the stratified rocks which have been observed is chief- 
ly towards the north and east. An appearance is observed on the 
north side of the parish worthy of notice. Underlying, and con- 
formable to a series of sandstone strata, there is a very thick mass 
of rock probably wacke called the Trow Craigs, extending in 
breadth to not less than J 50 yards, and forming in the Tweed an 
immense dam, over and through which, in the course of time, the 
water has forced its way. Owing to this circumstance, the chan- 
nel of the river here is extremely abrupt and irregular. The de- 
scent measures sixteen feet, and in it are various rapids and eddies, 
where the violence of the water, especially when flooded, becomes 
an object of interest. Among alluvial deposits, are found gravel, 
sand, and loam, beside the rivers ; and elsewhere, marl and peat. 
The soils vary from what may be called mossy, sandy, or gravelly, 
to fine loam. 

Botany. — There are numerous plantations in the parish, con- 
sisting of various kinds of pine, oak, ash, elm, birch, beech, &amp;c. 
Though the plantations are in general thriving and good, the trees 
in general do not appear to be of any remarkable age, — except the 
Trysting Tree, the age of which is not known, but it appears to have 
weathered the storm for at least two centuries. There have been 
at various times, portions extracted from its trunk, which the skill 
of the cabinet-maker has rendered highly ornamental for the draw - 
ing-room. This remarkable elm has for some time ceased to 
flourish, and is now apparently dead. All the cultivated grasses 
thrive here remarkably well ; and, what is rather uncommon even 
in the south of Scotland, the red or broad clover seed is occasion- 
ally and very successfully raised from the second crop of sown 
grass seed. Such red clover seed has been repeatedly sown, and 
in every instance has proved superior to any foreign seed of the 
same year. A sample of red clover seed, raised here six years 
ago, was exhibited at the meeting of the Highland Society at 
Glasgow, and very favourable notice was taken of it by that body.

II. — Civil History. 
Chief Land-owners. — The chief land-owner is His Grace the 
Duke of Roxburghe, who is also patron of the parish. He posses- 
ses somewhat more than one-half of the valued rent. The other 
chief land-owners are, William Scott Kerr, Esq. of Chatto ; the 
Merchant Maiden Hospital; Sir John James Scott Douglas, Bart, 
of Springwood Park; Charles Rutherford, Esq. of Fairnington. 
They are here enumerated in the order of their respective valua- 
tions. 

Parochial Registers. — There are three volumes of parochial re- 
gisters belonging to the parish. The earliest entry is of date 1624, 
and the whole have been kept up to this time with more or less 
accuracy. 

Antiquities. — The ancient town of Roxburgh, which is stated 
to have been the fourth town in Scotland in point of importance 
and population, was situated at the eastern extremity of the parish. 
In history, it is said to have been twice taken and burned, viz. in 
the years 1369 and 1460 ; and from the circumstance that the 
town was altogether constructed of wood,- hardly any vestiges of it 
exist. A little to the west of the site of the old town, appear the 
ruins of the celebrated castle of Roxburgh, " of which there remains 
now only as much shattered wall as suggests the former prodigi- 
ous strength and singular magnificence of the fortress. The south 
wall of the castle impended over the Tiviot, — a part of whose 
waters was directed by a dam thrown obliquely across the stream 
at the west end of the castle into a deep fosse, which defended the 
fortress on the west and north, emptying itself into the river at the 
east end thereof. Over this moat, at the gate-way from the town, 
was thrown a draw-bridge, the remains of which were but lately re- 
moved." — {Vide former Account. 

At different times, various remains of antiquity have been dug 
up at or near the castle, which are believed to be in the posses- 
sion of His Grace the Duke of Roxburghe. With regard to the 
history of the castle, — it was twice stormed, taken, and demolished, 
first by Robert Bruce in 1312, next in 1460, when James II. was 
killed by the bursting of a cannon. A yew tree, planted by His 
Grace the present Duke of Roxburghe, marks the spot where the 
king fell. Upon his death, the queen assumed the command in 
the name of her son, and urged the Scottish chieftains to testify 
the regard they had to their sovereign, by completing the enter- 
prize in which he had fallen. Her example and exhortation had

the desired effect, and the place which had been a centre of rapine 
and violence for many ages, was reduced to a heap of ruins. Sub- 
sequenlly, in the year 1547, the Duke of Somerset, having occasion 
to remain with his army for some time in the neighbourhood, and 
observing the ruined fortress to be a convenient situation, repaired 
it, so as to make it capable of receiving an English garrison. Traces 
of these repairs still appear among the ruins, which are now co- 
vered with trees. The mighty change the castle has undergone, 
while it reminds of former times, conveys a lesson of the instabi- 
lity of worldly greatness. 

There is adjoining to the village, and near the river, the ruin of 
a fort or tower, of which there were many in the border districts. 
It is denominated Roxburgh Tower, Wallace Tower, and also 
Sunlaw's Tower, and evidently formed part of a chain of com- 
munication between the castle of Roxburgh and other towers on 
the rivers Kale, Jed, &amp;c. It appears from history, that these 
towers had at various times received injuries from the incursions 
of the English mauraders, but were finally demolished, and re- 
duced to ruin in the reign of Mary Queen of Scots, and in the 
year 1545, by an army under the command of Hertford, after- 
wards the Duke of Somerset. Nothing remains of this tower 
but the ground apartments, strongly arched over, and used, in 
all probability, as places of security for cattle. Concerning this 
tower, there are various traditional stories ; but, as the truth of 
most of them is open to suspicion, and as all of them are much 
exaggerated, they are withheld from this Account. 

About midway between Roxburgh' Tower and Ormiston Tower, 
situated about two miles up the river Tiviot, and on a considerable 
eminence, are the remains of a camp, probably formed for the pro- 
tection of the towers of Roxburgh and Ormiston. 

The great Roman road, from the Frith of Forth to York, &amp;c. 
runs through the south-west corner of this parish, along which, 
till lately, cattle purchased at the Scottish markets were driven 
into England.

The number of families in the parish is - 200 

of families chiefly employed in agriculture - - 110 

in trade, manufactures, or handicraft, 18 

In the village of Roxburgh and Hieton the population amounts 
to about 400, and in the country to 562. With regard to the yearly 
average of births, deaths, and marriages, for the last seven years, 
no accurate information can be given, in as much as registration in 
the parish registers has not been made compulsory by law. 

There is only one family of independent fortune which resides 
occasionally in the parish. There are nine proprietors of land of 
the yearly value of L. 50 and upwards. For several years bygone, 
there have been exactly 200 families, and 196 inhabited houses, 
and 15 uninhabited. 

Character of the People. — The general character of the people 
is intellectual, moral, and religious. In proof of this, it may be 
stated, that hardly anything of the nature of crime occurs, and the 
people are almost all in communion with the Established church 
or the Secession. 

The temptation of poaching is very considerable, because of the 
abundance of game ; and, in consequence, this offence has occa- 
sionally occurred. 

During the last three years, there may have been 8 or 10 ille- 
gitimate births in the parish. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — There are 5617 imperial acres cultivated or oc- 
casionally in tillage; 1735 acres in pasture; 221 under wood. 

Rent of Land. — The average value of cultivated land is L. 1, 9s. 
per acre. Average rent for ox or cow, L. 2, 10s. ; and 9s. for ewe 
or full-grown sheep. The real rent of the parish is about L. 9000. 

Husbandry. — The husbandry pursued is commonly denominated 
the turnip system of husbandry ; by which is to be understood, that 
a fourth or fifth part of a farm cultivated in this way is yearly made 
to grow turnips, of which about one-half is eaten on the ground 
by sheep ; the other half is carted to the farm-steading for the 
horned cattle. In this way, the ground is manured by the sheep 
for subsequent crops, and the straw which is the produce of the 
farm is broken down in the curtains or yards by cattle, and is thus 
converted into manure for another crop of turnips. The order of 
cropping is, after turnips, wheat or barley, with an under crop of 
grass, which comes to maturity the following year, and is generally 
eaten with sheep. The ground remains frequently one year only, 
sometimes two, in grass, and is then ploughed up and sown with 



ROXBURGH. 133 

oats; which is succeeded by turnips, — asuccession of crops thus tak- 
ing place of four or five years, according as the ground is allowed to 
remain one or two years in pasture. These are called the systems 
of four and five-break husbandry. Such a method of husbandry has 
been found well fitted for the climate of this country and highly 
profitable. One difficulty, and that a very formidable one, has 
occurred in pursuing it. Allusion is made to what is called the 
bad-root among the turnips. Various conjectures have been form- 
ed as to the cause or causes of this evil, the principal of which 
seems to consist in a constant repetition, within a limited time, of a 
turnip crop. It may be observed, however, that the evil has abated 
considerably by the use of lime, and attention to a proper change 
of rotation. 

The general duration of leases is from fifteen to twenty-one 
years. The state of farm-buildings is creditable to landholders 
and tenants. The pasture land of the parish is well inclosed, and 
the arable part well subdivided and inclosed. 

Quarries and Mines.— There are various sandstone rocks in the 
parish, but none of them of great value for building, and none of 
them regularly wrought. No mines as yet have been discovered 
in the parish. 

Fisheries.— -On both rivers, the Tweed and the Tiviot, are sta- 
tions for fishing. The quantity of fish, though an article of com- 
merce, has been for some years very inconsiderable. The rent of 
the whole fishings does not exceed L. 60 per annum. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 
the parish, as nearly as that can be ascertained, is as follows : 

Produce of grain of a]] kinds, cultivated for food of man or the domestic 

animals, _ . _ L. 14 280 0 0 

Of potatoes, turnips, and other plants, cultivated in the fields for food, 2,910 0 0 

US hay, meadow and cultivated, . . i oqq q q 
Of land in pasture, rating it at L. 2, 10s. per cow or full-grown ox 
grazed for the season, and 9s. per full-grown ewe or sheep pastured

Of river fisheries per year, . . _ ~g n q q 

Total yearly value of raw produce raised, . L, 22,268~ 0 0 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
There is no market-town in the parish ; but there are two si- 
tuated at a very convenient distance, viz. Kelso and Jedburgh. The 
former is about four miles distant from the village, and the latter 
seven miles. There are two villages in the parish, viz. Roxburgh 
and Hieton. 

Means of Communication.— Two public roads run through the 



134 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



parish,— the one, leading from Kelso to Jedburgh on the south side 
of the Tiviot, extends about three miles ; the other, leading from 
Kelso to Melrose, &amp;c. in the immediate vicinity of the south bank 
of the Tweed, and at every point commanding a view of this noble 
river, and of a rich and beautiful country, extends about four miles. 
Tiviot Bridge is on this road, and unites this parish to Kelso. 
This bridge is of excellent structure, and durable material. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church is situated in the village 
of Roxburgh, and its situation is nearly centrical, but not very con- 
venient for a considerable part of the population, because of the Ti- 
viot which flows near it, and which when flooded cuts off about one- 
third of the population lying on the south side of the river. The 
distance from the western extremity of the parish is five miles, and 
from the eastern, three. The church was built in the year 
1752, was repaired in 1828, and is in a good state at present. It 
affords accommodation for about 500 sitters. The manse was 
built in the year 1820. The extent of the glebe is ten imperial 
acres, of value L. 20. The amount of the stipend is 15 chalders, 
the one-half of which is oat-meal, and the other barley, with L. 8, 
6s. 8d. for communion elements. It may also be stated, that there 
belongs to the minister a servitude for turf from His Grace the 
Duke of Roxburghe, which has been commuted into the sum of 

L. 1, 10s. yearly. 

The number of families attending the Established church is 
about 130, and the average number of communicants 240. The 
yearly amount of church collections is about L. 7. The smallness 
of the amount may be accounted for by the circumstance, that there 
has been a regular assessment for the poor of the parish for the 
last ninety-seven years. 

Education.— There are two schools in the parish ; both ol these 
are parochial. The branches taught in both are, reading, writing, 
arithmetic, English grammar, and occasionally practical geometry; 
book-keeping, surveying, and Latin. The salary of the school- 
master of Roxburgh is L. 34, 4s. 4id., and of Hieton L. 17, 2s.2 5 d. 
The amount of school-fees received by each is from L. 12 to 
L. 15 yearly, and each of the schoolmasters has the accommoda- 
tion of school-room, school-house, and garden. 

So far as is known, there are none between the ages of six and 
fifteen or upwards in the parish who cannot read and write. The 
people are in general alive to the benefits of getting their children 
properly educated. There is a part of the parish,' viz. Fairnington, 



ROXBURGH. 



135 



so distant as to prevent attendance at the parish school ; but at- 
tendance is given at the parish schools of Maxton and Ancrum, 
which are much nearer. There has occasionally been a private 
school in this part of the parish, and an additional school here 
would be beneficial. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid varies from 25 to 30. The average sum 
allotted to each is, 2s. Id. per week in summer, and 2s. ld. in 
winter. The annual amount of expenditure varies from L. 140 to 
L. 180, and arises chiefly from assessment levied, one-half from the 
heritors, and the other half from the tenants. This has been the 
regular mode of providing for the poor since the year 1737, and 
has been found to prove successful, and, under proper manage- 
ment, in the absence of residing heritors, appears to be by far the 
most just and equitable method of provision. No doubt, the feel- 
ing of reluctance and degradation at receiving parochial aid is dimi- 
nished by assessment, and also the disposition on the part of the 
people to contribute to church collections ; but these evils may be 
counterbalanced by proper management ; and the opposite evils of 
want, and unequal distribution, are more formidable. 

Fairs.— There is an annual fair held in the parish, on St James' 
Green, on the 5th of August, for the purposes of merchandize, 
hiring shearers, and horse and cattle-dealing. Considerable sales 
of wool are made at this fair, by the farmers in the surrounding 
districts. The wool is generally disposed of to English buyers. 

Alehouses.— There are three alehouses in the parish. Two of 
them are in the village of Hieton, for the benefit of those passing 
on the turnpike road leading from Kelso to Jedburgh, Hawick, &amp;c. 
The other is near the village of Roxburgh, at the ferry over the 
Tiviot. 

Fuel— The ordinary fuel is coal, which is procured from Nor- 
thumberland ; the distance is about eighteen or twenty miles. To 
the tenants and others having carts and horses, the expense of a 
single cart load at the coal-hill is from 6s. to 7s. tolls inclusive 
for sixteen cwt. Others, not having the same means of carting, 
obtain them for lis. 6d. There is also abundance of peat in the 
western part of the parish. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
1 he most striking variation betwixt the present and former 
state of the parish is in consequence of the introduction of the

ment is likely to take place in this respect, by the introduction of 
bone manure, which is found highly suitable for raising turnips, 
and of which not less than 500 quarters were used in the year 
1832. There may be a little difference of appearance in the 
parish, from the greater space occupied by crop now than for- 
merly. Such occupation, however, is not believed to be consider- 
able, and has in some instances after trial been abandoned. The 
number of sheep reared renders pasture valuable, so that land 
which might be cropped with a certain degree of profit is found 
to be more profitable when in pasture, especially after an occa- 
sional tillage with improvement. It is perhaps worthy of remark, 
that the crops now raised are, beyond all doubt, much more pro- 
ductive and profitable than formerly. 

The facilities of internal communication are, however, limited, 
and form the greatest barrier to improvement. This may be in- 
ferred from the fact, that while the land in this county is better 
than in most other counties, the climate good, and the husbandry 
highly improved, nevertheless the fiars prices for grain are among 
the very lowest in Scotland. This fact cannot be accounted for 
by the inferior quality of the grain, for the reverse is the truth, 
but by the great quantity produced above what is necessary for 
home consumption. This is carted chiefly to Berwick for the 
London market. The price of such carriage is regularly de- 
ducted from the returns given in by the witnesses on the fiars, 
and hence the low fiars price of corn. For the purpose of afford- 
ing increased facilities of internal communication, it has been pro- 
posed to form a railway from this district to Berwick, and consider- 
able progress has been made towards its accomplishment.

PRESBYTERY OF KELSO, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. DAVID HOGARTH, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — According to Chalmers in his " Caledonia," the ori- 
ginal name of this parish signifies the town of Machar or Machir, 
who is supposed to have possessed that portion of country which 
forms the parish of Makerstoun. 

Extent and Boundaries. — It is bounded on the west by the parish 
of Mertoun ; on the north by that of Smailholm ; on the east by 
that of Kelso ; and on the south by the river Tweed, which sepa- 
rates it from the parish of Roxburgh. It extends in length, from 
east to west, between 3 and 4 miles, and in breadth, from north 
to south, between 2 and 3. 

The ground rises gradually from the bank of the river to the 
northern extremity of the parish. The soil near the river is a rich 
dry loam upon a bottom of gravel or sandstone; but the northern 
part is of much inferior quality, being a thin clay upon a retentive 
subsoil. 

II. — Civil History. 

Land-owners. — Nine-tenths of the land belong to Sir Thomas 
and Lady Makdougal Brisbane, and the remainder with the ex- 
ception of two cottages and a small garden is the property of the 
Duke of Roxburghe. 

Parochial Registers. — These extend from 1692, with little in- 
terruption, to the present time. 

III. — Population. 

There appears no reason for believing that the population 
amounted to 1000, at a period so recent as fifty years before the 
date of the last Statistical Account ; for in the same account, it 
is stated that the number of souls in this parish was 165 at the 
time when the population was ascertained by Dr Webster. The 
distance between these two periods is only twelve years ; and, as 
during that interval there was no material change in the circum- 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



stances of the parish, the alleged diminution cannot be suppos- 
ed to have taken place. In 1801 the population was 248. In 
that and the following year, one-half of the parish was let in 
farms of a larger size, and a superior mode of husbandry was in- 
troduced. The consequence was, that the population, by the 
census of 1811, was found to have risen to 352, being an in- 
crease of nearly one-third in ten years. The population dimi- 
nished in 1821 to 345, and in 1831 to 326. But, as nine-tenths 
of the inhabitants are farm or house-servants, and liable to be re- 
moved every year, and as there is still the same number of inhabit- 
ed houses, this trifling diminution may be regarded as accidental, 
and not likely to be permanent. 

Number of families in the parish, - - 59 

chiefly employed in agriculture, - 48 

in trade, manufacture, or handicraft, 5 

The greater part of the population of this parish is extremely 
fluctuating. All the families, with the exception of nine, being the 
families either of farm-servants, or of tradesmen employed by the 
farmers, are liable to be removed every year. From this circum- 
stance nothing can be said respecting the general character of the 
inhabitants. 

IV. — Industry. 

The number of acres in the parish is 2854 : of these 2774 are 
cultivated or occasionally in tillage ; and 80 are planted. 

Rent. — The rental of the parish is about L. 4000. The ave- 
rage value per acre of the parish may be from L. 1, 5s. to L. 1, 10s. 
At the time of the last Statistical Account there were eighteen 
ploughs in the parish. The number is now thirty. 

Produce. — The produce per acre of the different kinds of grain 
varies according to the quality of the soil, and favourable or unfavour- 
able character of the season, being of wheat and pease, from fifteen 
to thirty, and.of barley and oats, from twenty tofifty imperial bush- 
els. There are annually about 400 acres in turnips and potatoes. 
The following state shows the average gross amount and value of 
the raw produce as nearly as can be ascertained :

V. — Parochial Economy. 

The turnpike road from Kelso to Edinburgh by Smailholm pas- 
ses through the eastern extremity of the parish. There is a coach 
daily from Edinburgh to Kelso by this road. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church and manse were built on a 
new site in 1807, near the centre of the parish. An excambion 
of the glebe took place at the same time ; the extent is twenty- 
two acres, and the value may be about L. 1. 5s. per acre. The 
stipend is fifteen chalders of barley and oat-meal, in equal parts, 
with L. 8, 6s. 8d. as an allowance for communion elements. The 
church may hold about 200 persons. The number of communi- 
cants for the last seven years has varied from 105 to 115. There 
are 58 families, 38 of which, either in whole or in part, belong to 
the Established church. 

Education. — There is only one school in the parish ; the paro- 
chial. The salary of the schoolmaster is L. 34, 4s. 4d. and the 
average amount of school fees for the last seven years is L. 17 
per annum. There are none in the parish above five years of age 
who cannot read. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of persons on the 
poors' roll for the last seven years has varied from two to five, and 
the sum allotted has been from Is. 6d. to 2s. 6d. per week. The 
annual amount of church collections for the same period has va- 
ried from L. 4 to L. 7. An assessment of from one farthing to 
three farthings per pound, on the rental of the parish, has been 
made half-yearly, as circumstances have required : and the average 
yearly amount raised from this source has been L. 5, 17s. There 
is a legacy of L. 27, the interest of which is for women above the age 
of seventy. There is another sum of L. 20, the interest of which is 
employed in the maintenance of the poor ; but there is no record 
to ascertain for what purpose the sum was left. The amount of 
these interests is L. 1, 3s. 5d. 

Fuel, fyc. — There is no alehouse in the parish. Coal is the 
only fuel used, and costs from 8d. to Is. per cwt.

PRESBYTERY OF LAUDER, SYNOD OE MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. THOMAS CLEGHORN, MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name of this parish is in ancient charters written 
Smalham and Smalhame; and in modern times Smalholm and 
Smailholm. Its etymology, as stated in the former Statistical Ac- 
count, is uncertain. 

Extent, Boundaries. — It extends in length about 4 miles, and 
in breadth rather more than 3 miles, and contains more than 6 
square miles. It is situated in the north-eastern extremity of the 
county of Roxburgh ; is bounded by the parishes of Mertoun on 
the west ; Earlston on the north ; and Nenthorn on the east ; and 
on the south by the parishes of Kelso and Makerstown. 

Topographical Appearances, fyc. — The figure of the parish is 
irregular, and there is a variety of fiat and rising grounds. It is 
about 500 feet above the level of the sea at Berwick-upon-Tweed. 
The air is pure, and the climate is considered peculiarly favourable 
to the health of the inhabitants, among whom no particular dis- 
temper can be said to prevail. Many of them live to a good old 
age. 

Limestone has been found in the parish, but it has never been 
burned, owing to the great distance from coal. On the south side 
of the parish there is an abundant supply of hard whinstone rock, 
to which the "road trustees have access for making and keeping in 
repair the turnpike-roads in the district ; and a considerable quan- 
tity of what is called rotten rock is found in various parts of the 
parish, which is used for making and repairing country and farm 
roads. 

II. — Civil History. 

Land-owners. — The chief land -owners in the parish are, George 
Baillie, Esq. of Jerviswood; Hugh Scott, Esq. of Harden; and 
his Grace the Duke of Roxburghe.

ters is 1642. They have been regularly kept, and are in a pretty 
good state of preservation. 

Antiquities. — On the south-west corner of the parish, in the 
farm of Sandyknow, the property of Mr Scott of Harden, among 
a cluster of rocks, stands " Smalholm Tower," a large square 
building, supposed to have been a " border keep" before the 
union of the kingdoms. This tower has long been in a ruinous 
condition, but has acquired an interest in modern times, from the 
author of Waverley having spent part of his infancy in its vi- 
cinity, and from his having ascribed, in a great measure, to that 
circumstance the peculiar character of his poetry. In the Min- 
strelsy of the Scottish Border, Sir Walter Scott, in a note pre- 
fixed to " The Eve of St John," says, it was in order to celebrate 
Smalholm Tower and its vicinity, which had been the residence of 
his infancy, that he had written that border tale ; and in the intro- 
duction to the third canto of Marmion, while describing the influ- 
ence of that early residence on his style of poetry, he alludes to 
the tower and the surrounding crags. 

III. — Population. 
The former Statistical Account says, " In 1700, the number 
of inhabitants was 600; in 1743 the examination-roll was 457; 
in 1790 it decreased more than 100; in Dr Webster's report the 
number of souls is stated at 551." By the census taken in May 
1831, the population of the parish is 628, being an increase of 128 
since 1821. 

In the three divisions of which the village consists, there are 
360 person, which leaves for the country part of the parish 268. 

The yearly average of births for the last seven years is . 10 

deaths, between 7 an j 3 

marriages, between . _ 2 and 3 

The average number of persons under 15 years of age is - 256 

betwixt 15 and 30, - 136 

30 and 50, - 124 

50 and 70, 94 

upwards of 70, - _ 18 

There are 3 proprietors of land in the parish having properties 
of the yearly value of L. 50 and upwards, but none of them reside 
in it. There are about 12 unmarried men, bachelors, and widowers 
above fifty years of age, and about 21 unmarried women upwards 
of forty-five, 

The average number of children in each family, taking those 
families only in which there are children, is nearly 4.

The number of families in the parish is - 127 

chiefly employed in agriculture, 55 
trade, manufactures, or handicraft, 32 

During the last three years there have been 2 illegitimate births 
in the parish. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — In the parish there are 3450 
acres of land cultivated or occasionally in tillage ; 457 acres which 
never have been cultivated, but which remain constantly in pasture; 
and there are none in a state of undivided common. About 60 acres 
are under wood, planted with firs, and hard-wood of various kinds, 
which are properly managed by thinning, pruning, &amp;c. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of arable land in the parish 
is L. 1 per English acre. The average rent of grazing per ox or 
cow is L. 3; and per ewe or full-grown sheep 10s. pastured for the 
year. The real rent of the parish is about L. 4000. 

Husbandry. — The duration of leases is from fifteen to twenty- 
one years. The farm-buildings are substantial and commodious, 
and the whole parish is subdivided into suitable enclosures by stone 
and thorn hedge fences. Great improvements have been, and are 
still making, by draining, liming, &amp;c. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 
the parish as near as can be ascertained, is as follows : — 

Produce of grain of all kinds, - - L. 5800 0 0 

Of potatoes, turnips, &amp;c. - - 1450 0 0 

Of land in pasture, - 1560 0 0 

Thinning of woods, &amp;c. • - - - 40 0 0 

Total yearly value of raw produce, L. 8850 0 0 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

In the parish there is one village, which consists of three divi- 
sions, East Third, West Third, and Overtown. The turnpike 
road, from Lauder to the March-Burn, passes through the East 
Third, in which the church, manse, and school-house are situated. 
Kelso, which is at six miles distance, is the nearest market-town, 
to which a carrier goes weekly on Friday, the market day. 

Means of Communication. — The parish enjoys ample means of 
communication in all directions The turnpike road runs through 
the parish from north to south for more than three miles, and there 
is a branch of road leading westward from the village for about two 
miles towards Drygrange Bridge, on the Jedburgh road. The 
Tweedside coach betwixt Kelso and Edinburgh passes through 
the village every lawful day at nine o'clock in the morning, going 
north, and at two o'clock p. m. going south. An Earlstown car-

rier to Edinburgh regularly attends at Smalholm on Monday af- 
ternoon, for the purpose of procuring eggs, butter, poultry, &amp;c. 
for the Edinburgh market; which is of great advantage to the vil- 
lage and neighbourhood. . 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is very conveniently 
situated for the whole population ; none of the inhabitants being 
more than two miles distant from the church ; the greater part of 
them are within five minutes walk of it. From an inscription  Soli 
Deo gloria 1632 found on a triangular stone, which was taken down 
from the top of one of the doors when the church was under re- 
pair, it appears to have been built in 1632. The church has been 
frequently repaired partially; in 1820 and 1821 it was completely 
new seated, and otherwise much improved ; and is now one of the 
neatest and most comfortable places of worship in the district. It 
can easily. accommodate 282 persons, but may hold 300. All the 
sittings in the church are free, the area being divided among 
the heritors according to their valued rents, for the accommoda- 
tion of their tenantry, who are in general amply provided for, 

while too little space is left for the inhabitants of the village ; an in- 
convenience which is felt very generally in country churches, and 
which requires to be remedied. There is also a private gallery in 
the west end of the church, for the accommodation of the family 
of George Baillie, Esq. who is patron of the church and parish, 
but whose residence of Mellerstain is in Earlstoun parish. The 
manse, which is upon a small scale, but neat and comfortable, was 
built in 1803 and 1804. The glebe, including the stance of the 
manse, offices, garden, and hedge enclosures, consists of ] 2 Eng- 
lish acres, which may be valued at L. 1, 10s. per acre. The sti- 
pend, as modified in 1823, amounts to fourteen chalders of victual, 
half barley and half oat-meal. There are about 100 families be- 
longing to the Established church, and the average number of per- 
sons of all ages attending it is about 220,— the remaining families, 
who do not belong to the Establishment, attend public worship in 
the Seceding meeting-houses chapels at Kelso, Earlstoun, and 
Stitchel. The average number of communicants is 240. In se- 
veral families, while the parents still adhere to the Secession, the 
children almost all belong to the Establishment. 

Education.— In the parochial school, the branches of instruc- 
tion taught are, English, grammar, writing, arithmetic, geography, 
practical mathematics, and Latin. The parochial teacher has the 
legal accommodation and the maximum salary; and his school fees 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



may amount to L. 28 or L. 30 a-year. Besides the parish school, 
there is a school at the farm-house of Sandy know, which is sup- 
ported by the tenant of that farm, who gives board and lodging to 
the teacher for educating his own children, and also by the school 
fees of his other pupils. There, the same branches are taught 
as at the parish school, and the quarterly fees are the same. All 
the young persons in the parish, between six and fifteen years of 
age, can read and write, or are learning to do so ; and it is not 
known that there is any person upwards of fifteen who cannot read 
or write. The total number of scholars attending both schools is 
about 100. 

Savings Bank. — A savings bank was established some years ago 
in the parish, but was discontinued at Whitsunday 1830, as the di- 
rectors did not think it was answering the purpose for which it 
was established. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — There are twelve enrolled poor 
in the parish ; who have at an average about 2s. per week, with oc- 
casional supplies of coal, meal, &amp;c. from the session funds. The 
annual amount of the church collections is about L. 12, and the 
half-yearly assessment about L. 35. There seems to be no dispo- 
sition among the poor, when reduced by necessity, to refrain from 
seeking parochial relief, neither do they in general appear then to 
consider it as degrading. 

Inns, fyc. — There are an inn and an alehouse in the village. Their 
effect on the morals of the people is decidedly unfavourable. 

The fuel consists of wood and coal ; the wood is procured from 
the neighbourhood; and the coals cost from 14d. to 16d. per cwt. 
when brought from Lothian, and lOd. to lid. from Northumber- 
land. 

Miscellaneous Observations. v 
Since the time of the last Statistical Account, four shops have 
been established, where almost every necessary article of either soft 
or hardware may be obtained, and there has been for a considerable 
time a baker in the village. 

The parish is not susceptible of much greater improvement, as 
the system of husbandry now practised by an intelligent and re- 
spectable tenantry is of the most approved kind.

PRESBYTERY OF KELSO, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE, 

THE REV. WILLIAM FAICHNEY, MINISTER. 



I- — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The name of the parish is derived from Lynn, which in 
the British language signifies a pool, or lake, as well as a cataract, 
and from the Saxon word ton or toun, which denotes a dwelling- 
place. Linton thus means the dwelling at the lake. The ancient 
village of Linton, of which there are now scarcely any vestiges, was 
situated near the borders of a lake still called Linton Loch,— which 
lies in a south-eastern direction from the parish church. 

Extent and Boundaries.— The length of this parish, extending 
west to east as far as the English border, is 6 miles: its breadth, 
2 miles. It is bounded on the north and north-west by the pa- 
rishes of Sprouston and Eckford ; on the west by Eckford ; on 
the south and south-west by Morbattle and Yetholm; and on 
the east by Northumberland. Its western extremity forms part of 
a beautiful valley watered by the Kale, a stream which descends 
from the Cheviot range. 

Topographical Appearances.— From this valley the land rises in 
a somewhat undulating ascent, till it reaches its highest elevation on 
the summit of Linton hill. Its surface eastward is varied and uneven, 
and sometimes intersected by small hills, which connect those of 
the Cheviot with the fertile plain which extends along the southern 
bank of the Tweed, in the parishes of Kelso and Sprouston. If, in 
former times, the inhabitants of Britain chose the summits of hills 
as the places for judicial proceedings, or the purposes of legislation, 
the small hills in this parish appear, from their names, Kiplaw, 
Hoselaw, Blakelaw, to have been the scene of such proceedings. 
The hills now mentioned extend along the northern boundary. 
Between these and Linton, and the Graden hills, which skirt the 
southern extremity, a considerable tract of low land intervenes, 
which again is sometimes indented into valleys. The greater part 

 Drawn up by the Rev. James Brothcrstdn, Assistant to he Minister of the parish.

of this tract is richly cultivated. Though in some places it is 
marshy and interspersed with mosses, yet almost the whole of it is 
susceptible of cultivation. With the exception of Linton hill, the 
higher parts of which are still waste, the plough has reached the 
summit of the highest eminences. The valley on the western ex- 
tremity, and of which 300 acres belong to this parish, is bounded 
on the north and north-east by the church of Linton, and Clifton 
Park, a seat of Mr Pringle of Clifton, M. P. surrounded by a fine 
old plantation ; on the west, by Marlefield, formerly the residence 
of Sir William Bennet of Grubbet, the well-known patron of Allan 
Ramsay, and of whose hospitable mansion, Thomson, the author of 
the Seasons, is said to have frequently been an inmate ; on the east, 
by Wideopen, the paternal inheritance of Thomson ; and on the 
south and south-west, by the village of Morbattle and Cessford, the 
massive remains of whose baronial fortress, once the residence of 
the ancestors of the noble family of Roxburghe, still frown in an- 
cient dignity on the adjacent territory. This valley, both on ac- 
count of its delightful scenery and local associations, has been often 
surveyed with no small interest. 

Meteorology. — The climate, which, in the western and most po- 
pulous portion of the parish is peculiarly mild, in the eastern and 
central district undergoes a considerable change for the worse. Here 
the increased coldness of the atmosphere, the greater poverty of the 
soil, the absence of plantations, and the greater elevation of the 
ground, all combine to render the aspect of the fields bleaker and 
more barren. The winds likewise varyin the eastern and western dis- 
tricts; while the east and north winds chiefly prevail in the former, and 
prove in no small degree hurtful to vegetation, — in the latter, these 
winds are little felt ; while gales from the south-west blow across the 
valley, and strike the rising ground opposite to it with considerable 
violence. Severe blasts not unfrequently range from the Cheviot 
on the south-east, assail this portion of the parish. The wind always 
blows from that direction in a severe storm.— The climate of this 
parish has always been deemed, upon the whole, peculiarly healthy. 
At one period, agues were not unfrequent ; but, since the draining 
of the lakes and marshy lands, these have totally ceased ; and in 
the parish there are several individuals who have reached a very 
advanced age. 

Hydrography and Geology.— There are two lakes in the parish. 
Linton Loch is nearly circular in form, and contains fifty acres. 
It occupies a natural basin formed by hills of considerable height, 



LINTON. 



147 



surrounding it on the north, east, and south, and cultivated al- 
most to their summits. Towards the west, it opens into the valley 
of the Kale, into which, by a copious stream, it discharges its waters. 
The whole of the surface of these fifty acres was formerly covered 
with water; it is now partially drained, and it exhibits the appearance 
of a verdant morass, interspersed with three or four pools of water, 
in which are found excellent trout, closely resembling those of 
Lochleven. The surface of the lake or morass, to a considerable 
depth, consists of moss, under which there is excellent marl. Of 
the moss, there are three different kinds : the first stratum consists 
of vegetable roots of a more recent and less complete decomposi- 
tion. Its depth is from four to five feet. The second stratum is 
from two to three feet deep, of a lighter colour, and more decom- 
posed ; when long exposed to the air, it becomes nearly as white 
as marl ; and when dried, it is quite hard. The lowest stratum is 
nearly four feet thick, and entirely composed of wood of various 
sorts ; but principally of birch and hazel. In this stratum were 
found large quantities of hazel-nuts, heaped in large masses, 
as if collected by the impulse of a current of water. When ex- 
posed to the air, they appeared quite fresh ; they were broken 
even by a slight touch, and were found to be full of water. The 
moss in the centre of the loch is of extraordinary depth; sixty-five 
feet of iron rod could not fathom it, — as was found from a recent ex- 
periment made in search of marl. About eight years ago, it was 
attempted to dig the marl found beneath the moss ; but, though it 
was of the finest quality, the expense of digging it was so great, in 
consequence of the annoyance arising from the great abundance 
of water, that the enterprise was abandoned. From an accurate 
measurement, so far as this was practicable, it appeared that the 
marl amounted to one million of cubic yards. Its seam varied in 
thickness from two to eighteen feet. It was sometimes blended 
with a seam of sand from two to three feet in thickness. The colour 
of the marl is varied ; the greatest part of it being white as lime ; 
and a considerable quantity of it black as moss ; and there are por- 
tions of it which partake of both colours, mingled in various propor- 
tions. The black marl was, upon trial, found equally efficacious as 
the white. Viewed through a microscope, though fine as flour, it 
presented the appearance of decomposed shells. The black was 
generally separated from the white marl, and in different layers. 
A deer's horns, of an extraordinary size, and supposed to be

those of the rein-deer, were found imbedded in the marl four- 
teen feet below its surface, — above which there were ten feet of 
moss. These are now in the possession of Mr Pringle of Clifton, 
the proprietor. They measured 3 feet in length, and 3 feet 
10 inches between each horn. Besides these, several skeletons, 
amounting to twenty, of animals of different species, and of various 
sizes, were discovered in the space of less than an acre. The bones 
of one of these in magnitude exceeded those of ahorse. Some of them 
were much decayed ; and when affected by the air, mouldered into 
dust. The moss also abounded with large and thick oaks; it contain- 
ed wood from the smallest twig to the tree of two feet diameter, which 
was usually quite soft and spongy, — so that these trees were saturat- 
ed with moisture, and the soil or vegetable roots amid which they 
were imbedded. In the bottom of the lake, also, a very strong and 
copious mineral spring was found to issue from the sand beneath the 
seams of marl after it was dug. There are obvious traces of this 
lake, enlarged by the waters of the Kale once flowing into it, and 
by the rills and torrents descending from the adjacent hills, having 
formerly covered the whole expanse of the valley formerly men- 
tioned, and extending to 1000 acres, — thus forming a uniform and 
magnificent sheet of water. The whole of this space abounds 
with copious springs of the purest water, whose origin is traced to 
the Kale, and which rise through veins of sand. The other lake, 
called Hoselaw Loch, is situated near the eastern extremity of the 
parish. Its surface extends to thirty acres ; it is of an oblong form, 
and is three-quarters of a mile in circumference. It abounds with 
perch and eels of the silver kind. The perch which it contains 
were only recently introduced to it from a neighbouring lake : and 
the fishing of these affords amusement to parties of pleasure dur- 
ing summer. Sometimes, during the most sultry period of sum- 
mer, shoals of perches are, from some cause unknown, cast out 
dead upon the margin of the lake. The greatest depth of the lake 
does not exceed at any time fifteen feet : in summer it greatly de- 
creases. It forms an entire sheet of water : and is terminated on 
the west by a moss of great extent and depth, — which, from the 
difficulty of access to it, and the indifferent quality of the peat, is 
little dug. There is another moss, about a mile westward from 
this, on the farm of Greenlees, which also is of considerable ex- 
tent and depth. Its peats are of a better quality : and marl has 
been found beneath the moss; but neither have been used to any 
extent.

Besides the mineral spring already mentioned, there are several 
others in the parish,— one of which, on the farm of Bankhead, 
appears, from tradition, to have been frequently used for scor- 
butic complaints. It is still occasionally employed in these dis- 
orders. 

Soil, Sfc. — The soil of the greater portion of the western district 
consists of loamj gravel, sand, and clay, mixed in various propor- 
tions ; 300 acres adjoining Kale water are of a stiff retentive clay, 
resting on a wet channel bottom ; but the soil of part of this tract is 
a deep loam, reposing on sand and gravel. The whole of this fine 
strath would be much improved by deepening the course of a mill- 
dam which flows through it, and by draining. In the eastern and cen- 
tral district, where the land is higher, the soil is light. There are fre- 
quent instances of the soil having been carried by the rain from the 
higher, and deposited in the lower lands. This, though sometimes 
beneficial, also proves occasionally injurious to the latter, as in 
draining, the good soil has been discovered buried beneath a 
lighter soil, which had been thus borne down from the hills. Most 
of the rocks are whinstone, which, when broken, has been fre- 
quently found to contain rock crystals. In one quarry, there is a 
large seam of the latter interwoven with the whinstone ; the course 
of which seam can be readily traced by the eye. On the farm of 
Frogden, there is a quarry of freestone, which, notwithstanding the 
good quality of the stone, has been little wrought. Large pieces 
of jasper of all kinds are frequently dug up by the plough, and lie 
scattered over the surface of the ground. The fir, the oak, the 
ash, and the elm, here find a congenial soil. The principal plan- 
tation is that of Clifton Park, which covers an extent of thirty 
acres. Several years ago, a small seam of coal was discovered on 
the farm of Greenlees,- but the working of it was not proceeded in 
to any extent, and was speedily abandoned as unprofitable. 

II. — Civil History. 
The earliest notice of this parish appears in connection with the 
donation  of the church of Linton to the monks of Kelso, by Sir 
Richard Cumin, for the salvation of the soul of Prince Henry 
eldest son of David I. This Sir Richard Cumin was the ancestor 
of the Cumins of Badenoch, and of the famous John Cumin who 
aspired to the Scottish crown. At the period of the gift, he ap- 
pears to have held one of the highest offices of the state; but whe- 
ther or not he possessed property in the parish is uncertain.

Family of Somerville. — Soon after this period, it appears that a 
considerable portion of the lands of Linton were obtained by Wil- 
liam de Somerville, ancestor of Lord Somerville, as a reward for 
having killed a monstrous serpent, wolf, or boar, which infested the 
neighbourhood, and seems to have committed great devastation.  
This gift is stated to have been made by William the Lion, King 
of Scotland, in the year 1174:f and the property thus acquired 
seems to have remained, during a considerable period, in the pos- 
session of the Somerville family, — some of whose representatives 
are recorded, at different periods, to have granted lands in the pa- 
rish to the monks of Glasgow and Melrose. X 

The name of the above William de Somerville appears in the 
list of witnesses appended to a charter of confirmation granted to 
the monks of Kelso by King Malcolm IV. He was the son of 
Roger de Somerville, Baron of Whichnour, in England, and after 
performing the exploit for which he was rewarded with the barony 
of Linton, he was invested with the office of principal Falconer to 
the King of Scotland, and also with that of the sheriffdom of Rox- 
burghshire. He built the tower of Linton, which continued to be 
the residence of his family till near the end of the fourteenth cen- 
tury, when they removed to the castle of Cowthally in Carnwath. 
A portion of Linton church then called the choir, too, was their or- 
dinary burial-place, till about the year 1424. In this place the 
remains of the above William, the founder of his family in Scotland, 
were interred.§ When the barons of England, who extorted the 
Magna Charta from their reluctant king, were afterwards subdued, 
and when many of their castles and possessions were reduced to 
ruin, Roger, his father, who was one of them, sought refuge with his 

" See Douglas' Baronage of Scotland, and History of the Family of Somerville. 

t The den of this animal is still pointed out under the name of " the worm's hole ;" 
and the field in which it is situated receives the name of Wormington. 

In the southern wall of the parish church, an ancient stone, which exhibits the 
effigy of a man on horseback, with a long lance or spear in his hand, and thrust into 
the mouth of an animal resembling a dragon, is thought to illustrate the tradition ; 
and the history of the noble family of Somerville, lately published, gives a detailed 
account of the transaction. It is also said that the stone once contained the follow- 
ing inscription : 

" Thewode Laird of Lariestone, 

Slew the wode worm of Wormieston, 

And won all Linton paroshine." 
The memorial of this event is still preserved on the crest of Lord Somerville's arms, 
which retains, among other allusions to it, the following inscription, « The wode 
laird." 

 See Chartularies of the above monasteries. 

To these religious donations, probably, are to be ascribed the names still in use i' 
certain fields and houses,— such as the " Trior Row," and the " Priory Meadow."

son in Scotland, and shortly after died at Linton tower, and was 
buried in the choir of Linton church. Some of the representatives 
of this house, while they resided in their barony of Linton, were 
renowned for their patriotism. Walter de Somerville, the third 
Baron of Linton, magnanimously maintained the rights of his coun- 
try against the aggressions of Edward I. He was one of the few 
barons who supported Wallace, and seconded his efforts to recover 
his country's freedom. Under Wallace he commanded the third 
brigade of cavalry at the battle of Biggar. He also appears to have 
been among the first who joined the standard of Bruce,  to whom 
previous to his death, he solemnly entreated his son to remain a 
faithful adherent. The latter, accordingly, John de Somerville, was 
not disobedient to his father's injunctions, and steadily maintained 
the interests of the house of Bruce till his death. His remains 
were consigned to the tomb of his ancestors in Linton church, f 

Antiquities. — The ancient fortalice or tower of Linton, of which 
there are now scarcely any vestiges, and which was formerly the resi- 
dence of this family, stood on an eminence now covered with trees, 
near the church, which overlooks it. About twenty years ago, a large 
iron door was dug out of the cavity,, which still remains to mark the 
site of the dungeon. It appears to have been surrounded by a fosse, 
the water of which was supplied from an adjoining rivulet. It shared 
in the devastations common to similar fastnesses in the borders ■ 
for during the reign of Henry VIII. the warden of the English 
marches, in a hostile invasion of the Scottish territory, besieged 
and set fire to it; and Surrey, in a letter to the same sovereign on 
a similar occasion, mentions his having razed it to the grouHd."f 

The Kerrs of Graden in this parish were distinguished in border 
warfare. Graden Place, their residence, still manifests the traces 
of an ancient fortress, surrounded by a moatr During the border 
feuds and depredations, while the two kingdoms were separated, this 
parish suffered in common with the adjacent country. Occupying 
part of what was formerly called the " dry marches," it formed 
one of the principal thoroughfares betwixt the two kingdoms. A 
narrow aperture between two hills along the verge of Linton loch 
appears to have been regarded as an important pass, and there are 
still obvious marks of its having been once closely guarded. The 
small eminence on which the church is built seems to have af-

forded a favourable position for defending it : and this eminence 
is generally believed to have been artificial. A hollow in the 
neighbourhood is still shown, whence the soil which forms it was 
conveyed. 

In a field on the farm of Frogden, five or six upright stones, form- 
ing a circle, were designated the " tryst," — from their being a ren- 
dezvous where predatory hordes projecting an incursion into Nor- 
thumberland were wont to meet. 

The whole of the district abounds with memorials of ancient 
border warfare. From its contiguity to the fortresses of Werk and 
Roxburgh, it must occasionally have been the scene of the more 
important struggles between the two kingdoms. Accordingly, on 
the summits of the small hills, there are remains of circular en- 
campments; and from the surface of the ground arise numerous small 
tumuli, which, when excavated, are found to contain human bones 
inclosed in circular earthen urns, of various dimensions. Some of 
these are obviously of Roman construction. In one place, these 
tumuli are so numerous as almost to resemble a burying-ground, 
or at least they render it probable that the ground which they oc- 
cupy had been once a field of battle. Most of these bones, as 
well as the urns containing them, when exposed to the air, dissolve 
into dust. About fifty years ago, during the repairing of the church, 
a large grave was discovered, in which were fifty skulls ; all were 
equally decayed, and many of them bore marks of violence. It is 
conjectured that they belonged to individuals who had fallen at 
Flodden Field ; the remains of many of whom, as is well known, 
were consigned to a common grave in the cemeteries of the nearest 
border parishes. A few years ago, a brazen Roman spear was 
found in a mossy soil, three feet below the surface, near the mouth 
of a well, and is now in the possession of Mr Pringle of Clifton, 
M. P. 

A chapel belonging to the Established church appears to have 
been formerly at Hoselaw, for the benefit of the inhabitants of the 
eastern district, which was then, as at present, at an inconvenient 
distance from the parish church. The remains of this chapel and 
of a small burying-ground attached to it were visible till lately, 
when, by the operations of the plough, they were wholly effaced. 

Land-owners. — Robert Pringle, Esq. of Clifton and Haining, 
Member of Parliament for Selkirkshire, is the principal proprietor 
and the patron of the church; nearly two-thirds of the lands be- 
long to him. This gentleman maintains the same high reputation 
for public spirit, generosity, and interest in the welfare of his 



LINTON. 



153 



tenants, which have distinguished his ancestors. The tenantry 
are prosperous and happy, and hold him in the highest estima- 
tion. They avoid either extreme of extravagance or parsimony. 
Their industry, diligence, and zeal in executing those improvements 
which experience has proved to be advantageous, are highly com- 
mendable ; and all of them reside on their farms, each of which is 
of sufficient magnitude to occupy the attention of a resident tenant. 
The other proprietors are Mr Wauchope of Niddrie-Marishall ; 
Mr Dawson of Graden ; Mr Oliver of Blakelaw, and Mr David- 
son of Hoselawmains. None of these are resident. 

Eminent Persons. — The late Mr Dawson, while farmer at Frog- 
den, was the first who introduced into Scotland some of the most 
important agricultural improvements, such as the turnip husbandry, 
and drill system, the laying down of the lime, and harrowing it 
in on the land when laid down in pasture, and the sowing of artifi- 
cial grasses. Mr Thomas Pringle, author of a small volume of 
poems and of several other useful and interesting publications ; 
and Dr Clarke, who long enjoyed celebrity as the first physician 
in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, were both natives of this parish. 

Parochial Registers. — The registers of births have been pretty 
regularly kept; and the date of their earliest entry is 1732. 

III. — Population. 
Though there are now no remains of the once considerable vil- 
lages of Hoselaw and Linton, yet the number of the inhabitants of 
the parish has rather increased. This is entirely to be attributed 
to the improvements in agriculture, requiring a corresponding in- 
crease of labour. The population is spread over a rural tract among 
the various farms or hamlets, and is almost exclusively confined to 
agricultural employments. 

Population in 1811, - - 462 
1821, - 458 

1831, - - 462 

Of the 462 inhabitants at the time of the last census, only 6 are 
employed in trade or manufactures. The average number of mar- 
riages, births, and burials is at present nearly the same as that 
which was stated in the former Statistical Account ; it may be 
computed at 5 marriages, 10 births, and 6 burials annually. It 
has been remarked that, of late years, there are even fewer bu- 
rials than formerly, in consequence of the hinds being less sta- 
tionary in a parish of this kind than in those which have villages, 
into which they retire when disabled by age or infirmity. On all 
the farms, amounting to fifteen, with the exception of five, the 
tenants reside ; but of the residing farmers only four are married.

Character of the People. — The peasantry possess all the qualities 
which have long characterized the same class in Scotland. They 
are distinguished for intelligence, and, for the most part, are exem- 
plary in their habits. No ardent spirits are sold in the parish, 
and therefore they are seldom tempted to deviate from their 
ordinary sobriety. The tenantry and their hinds or farm-ser- 
vants generally follow the occupations of their fathers, and with 
" sober wishes" they pursue " the noiseless tenor of their way," 
unseduced by the allurements that are usually found in a crowd- 
ed population. The cottages of the poor in general present inter- 
nally an appearance of the utmost cleanliness. Their dress at 
church or at market approaches to elegance. Most of them pos- 
sess abundance of solid and wholesome food ; and there are few 
cases of real privation. They seldom change masters, and ou 
some farms most of the servants have remained during the currency 
of more than one lease. 

There have been two illegitimate births during the las three 
years. 

The number of families in the parish is 84. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — This parish contains 6500 acres of land ; 4750 
of these are cultivated; and the remaining 1750 are waste, where- 
of about 80 acres are covered with wood. 

Husbandry. — Two or three of the farmers have long enjoyed 
celebrity as improvers and breeders of stock of all descriptions. 
The stock principally consists of cattle of the improved short- 
horned breed, and of the Leicester and Cheviot breed of sheep. 
The cultivated land, too, has been highly improved. Much waste 
ground has been reclaimed, and the benefits derived from this 
source have been such, that the present tenants can keep as much 
stock as those of former times, and have, besides, all the addi- 
tional grain yielded by the improved land. A considerable por- 
tion of the remaining waste land probably 450 acres is suscep- 
tible of cultivation, and is fitted either to produce crops, or to be 
laid down in pasture. The crops raised are, oats, barley, and wheat, 
— of which the two latter are the most prevalent. The turnips 
were, at an early period, infested by the bad root ; the only remedy 
for which that has yet been discovered is abundant liming ; and 
even this has been but partially successful. In not a few instances, 
like every other expedient, it has failed to revive the sinking hopes 
of the husbandman, doomed to witness the baneful effects of this 
desolating scourge. The duration of leases is nineteen years.

The rent of a few farms is paid in part according to the jiars, — 
which mode of payment is deemed the most equitable. The ac- 
commodations granted to the tenant, both as regards building and 
enclosing, are generally of the best description. 

Draining, though practised to a great extent, is still very im- 
perfectly carried on, and presents a large field for exertion, and for 
the application of capital. One field only, extending to 20 acres, 
has been irrigated. The experiment, however, was successful, 
and afforded abundant compensation for the labour and expense. 
Considerable embankments have been made on Kale Water, and 
on a small stream called the Lake, whose course at one period ap- 
pears to have been deepened for the purpose of emptying the 
stagnant waters of a lake or morass in its vicinity, of which there 
are still some remains. These embankments have proved very 
beneficial. 

Produce. — The average gross amount and value of raw produce 
yearly raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as 
follows : 

833 bolls of wheat, imperial measure, - . L. 1452 10 10

- V. — Parochial Economy. 

Kelso, which is six miles distant, is the nearest market-town. 
The farmers occasionally frequent also the market of Jedburgh, 
which is at least eight miles distant. They deal extensively with 
the corn-merchants of Berwick, with whom they bargain to con- 
vey thither the grain that has been purchased, and they usually 
return home with a load of coal or lime from Northumberland ; 
hence the advantages which they would reap from the execution of 
the long projected rail-road between Kelso and Berwick. They 
generally drive their stock and fat cattle to the markets of Edin- 
burgh and Morpeth, but principally to that of the latter place. 
They are almost equidistant from both. 

Means of Communication.— -Kelso is also the nearest post-town ; 
—with which, exclusively of the market-day, there is a regular 
communication twice in the week. Most of the roads are good, 
and kept in good repair. The fences are in general good, and 
chiefly consist of hedge-rows of thorn, interspersed with trees.

These, besides improving the aspect of the country, by giving to 
it a finely wooded appearance, are attended with other advantages 
previously stated, which amply compensate for the failure of vege- 
tation in their neighbourhood. 

Ecclesiastical State. — A more delightful and sequestered situa- 
tion than that which is occupied by the church and manse can 
scarcely be conceived; — the church crowning the summit of a cir- 
cular little hill; the manse about 100 yards distant from it, embo- 
somed amid fine old fruit trees, and agreeably sheltered and ap- 
proached by an avenue lined with tall trees, — present a scene whose 
peculiar charms uniformly arrest the attention of the spectator. As 
the church is placed nearly at the western extremity of the parish, a 
distance of almost six miles intervenes between it and the remotest 
part of the eastern district. To the inhabitants of the latter, 
therefore, its situation is inconvenient. As it is easily accessible, 
however, to by far the most populous part of the parish, its pre- 
sent position, which, as regards climate, soil, and the cultivation 
of the land contiguous to it, has superior advantages, is upon the 
whole the best and most eligible; and few, if any, have expres- 
sed a serious desire for its removal. 

From the thickness and strength of its walls, and the depth to 
which thev have sunk in the soil, the church exhibits marks of con- 
siderable antiquity. It was repaired about forty-five years ago, 
and contracted within its original dimensions. It affords accom- 
modation for 180 persons, and is sufficient for the inhabitants of 
the parish. The above number rather exceeds that of the average 
attendance ; but on ordinary Sabbaths it is still well attended. 
The average number of communicants of late years has been 170. 
There are no Dissenting chapels in the parish ; they abound, 
however, in the neighbourhood, and are attended by twelve fa- 
milies in this parish, who chiefly belong to the Seceders of the 
United -Associate Synod. The manse was built about fifty years 
ago ; it has since received scarcely any repair ; and both it and 
the office-houses are in a good condition. The glebe contains ten 
acres of arable land of the best quality, and the stipend consists 
of sixteen chalders of grain. In the manse garden, there are two 
fine old pear trees, the price of one year's produce of which amount- 
ed to L. 10. 

Education. — The parochial school is the only seminary in the 
parish ; the branches of education taught at which are reading, 
writing, arithmetic, algebra, and mathematics. For instruction in 
reading, writing, and arithmetic, the average sum paid for each 



LINTON. 



157 



pupil is 3s. per quarter. The teacher is authorized by the heri- 
tors to exercise his own discretion with regard to the fees to be 
exacted from those who are taught algebra and mathematics. The 
accommodation of the schoolmaster is good, and somewhat ex- 
ceeds the legal allowance. He possesses the maximum salary. 
The remotest part of the parish is at least five miles distant from the 
school ; but, as this part is thinly inhabited, the inconvenience of 
the distance is not. much felt, and is not so great as to render the 
erection of another school necessary ; 40 is the average attend- 
ance. The school fees may amount to L. 20 a-year. It is pleas- 
ing to witness the solicitude of the poorest persons respecting 
the education of their children in the ordinary branches of in- 
struction. Rather than forego this advantage, which they deem 
inestimable, they will submit to no small privations ; and they 
cheerfully devote to its attainment a portion of their scanty and 
hard-earned gains. The history of the poor in this, as well as 
in other districts, unfolds many cases of endurance borne with 
alacrity, in order that they may procure not only the quarter's 
fees, but shoes and clothing, to enable their children to make as 
decent an appearance at school as those of their neighbours. 
Such has been the influence of the system of moral and religious 
instruction peculiar to our ecclesiastical establishment and paro- 
chial schools, that all vestiges of predatory habits have long disap- 
peared from the borders, — whose inhabitants are now as remark- 
able as those of any part of Scotland for intelligence, persever- 
ing industry, and ardent piety. The total number of scholars at 
schools in the parish is 55. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
who annually obtain parochial aid is 12; each of whom receives 
nearly 2s. per week, or an yearly allowance of L. 5. The funds 
required for this purpose are supplied by legal assessment, of 
which the average annual amount is L. 60. That of the church 
collection is L. 6, and affords the means of relieving occasional in- 
digence. The receiving of parochial aid is here reckoned no de- 
gradation. Most seem to demand it as that to which they have 
a legal claim ; and instances are not uncommon of active and 
vigorous young men who do not think it incumbent on them to 
minister to the necessities of their aged parents, but who, without 
scruple or any sense of impropriety, consign them to the support 
of the parish. Such sentiments, common to the inhabitants of 
all the border parishes, have, not without reason, been ascribed to 
their contiguity to England.

. Fuel. — Almost the only fuel used is coal, which is 14 miles dis- 
tant, and brought from Northumberland. Though the peat, with 
the exception of that of Graden moss, is of a good quality, yet 
the mosses mentioned above are little dug. Coals can be procur- 
ed at nearly as cheap a rate as peat ; the cost of the former, includ- 
ing carriage and all other expenses, being about 7d. per cwt. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Since the period of the last Statistical Account, the population, 
in consequence of agricultural improvements and the extension of 
cultivated land, has somewhat increased. The number of inhabited 
houses, which was then 55, is now 79. The number of ploughs, 
which was then 30, is now 50, — to each of which a pair of horses be- 
longs. The rent of the parish, which was formerly L. 2118, is now 
L. 5514, 6s. 8d. ; that of the largest farm, which was formerly L. 400, 
is now nearly L. 800. The improved system of husbandry which 
has since that time been introduced, as well as the reclaiming of 
waste land, have thus obviously augmented the quantity of la- 
bour, and compensated for its anticipated diminution by the use of 
thrashing machines. Sources of industry have thus been multi- 
plied, and what was lost in one department has been gained in 
another, no less subservient to the welfare of the community. 
The much greater demand for stock of all descriptions than for- 
merly has prompted the farmers, for the purpose of rearing them, 
to subject to the agency of the plough much of their ground which 
they once deemed inadequate to remunerate them for the labour 
and expense of cultivation. Whether the general comfort and 
happiness of those who follow agricultural employments have also 
been advanced is doubtful. Their habits and intelligence, in no 
small degree, have kept pace with the spirit and improvements of 
the age. They are now better educated than formerly ; books are 
more accessible to them, and not a few avail themselves of these 
sources of mental enjoyment. Still, their increased thirst of know- 
ledge creates wants, for the supply of which their scanty means 
are incompetent, and thus gives rise to discontentment and fretful- 
ness. A small augmentation of their wages would do much to improve 
their condition. To these sources, is to be traced that very ge- 
neral desire of emigration to Canada which of late years the class 
of hinds has manifested ; and the children of those whom no . 
worldly motive could have torn from their native hills and valleys, 
now, without a tear, nay, with a sort of exultation, leave the land 
of their fathers.

PRESBYTERY OF KELSO, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. JOHN BAIRD, MINISTER. 



I- — Topography and Natural History. 

Name.— Yetholm is sometimes written Zetholm, Zettin, Yet- 
tarn, and Yetham ; which last is probably the original name of 
the parish. It seems to be derived from the Scoto- Saxon word 
« Yet," or « Gate," signifying a gate or road, and obviously con- 
nected with the Anglo-Saxon word Zeat, Zete, Zate, porta. Yet- 
holm is a border parish, and the villages of Town and Kirk Yet- 
holm are separated from England by a valley one mile in length, and 
about a quarter of a mile m breadth, which, in former times, must 
have presented a very easy access or entrance from the one country 
to the other; so that Yetholm or Yetham may signify the hamlet or 
dwelling upon the great entrance from England, or the adjoining 
part of Northumberland, into Scotland. 

Extent— Boundaries.— The extent of the parish is 2 miles from 
nearly north-east to south-west, and 4 miles from north-west to 
south-east. It marches with England for a distance of about six 
m.les, and no part of the parish is distant more than two miles from 
the border. 

Topographical Appearances.— The general aspect and outline of 
the parish is hilly, though none of the hills are of any great ele- 
vation ; the. highest probably not exceeding 700 or 800 feet above 
the level of the sea. The lower hills are cultivated ; and the 
higher, which are a portion of the Cheviot range, are clothed with 
a rich green sward to their summits, affording excellent pasture 
to many thousands of sheep. Several peaceful and romantic little 
valleys he embosomed amid these hills; and the vale of the Bow- 
mont itself, in which nine-tenths of the inhabitants of the parish 
reside, is only a larger vale of the same description. That part 
ot this vale which lies in the parish tf Yetholm is two miles long, 
and from a quarter to nearly half a mile in breadth, and appears 



H0

encircled on every side by hills, except on the east, where it opens 
into England. The sides of the hills immediately bounding the 
vale are all under tillage, and covered generally with a rich and 
light soil resting on gravel and rock. Towards the middle of this 
vale, and near the village of Town Yetholm, another valley, or 
tract of low level ground, the opposite sides of which rise to a con- 
siderable elevation, branches off in a westerly direction towards 
Yetholm Loch. 

The climate of Yetholm is remarkably clear and healthy, and 
the temperature much milder than might be expected. 

Hydrography. — Yetholm Loch, sometimes also called Primside 
Loch, is a sheet of water nearly a mile and a half in circumference : 
it abounds with pike and perch : and is frequented by a great va- 
rietv of water-fowl ; of which the rarer species are the wild swan, 
the goosander, and the Siberian goose ; but these only appear in 
severe winters. Bowmont Water, in some very old charters, is also 
written Bol-bent and Bow-bent, and is probably so named from the 
curvature of its course. It has its source in the Cocklaw, and, af- 
ter mingling with the College, it joins the Till, a tributary of the 
Tweed. The Bowmont is stocked with abundance of fine trout, 
and before the erection of a mill-dam or call on the Till at Etal, 
salmon-grilses and sea-trout were frequently caught. The course 
of the Bowmont is extremely rapid, and, from its vicinity to the 
hills, it is exposed to frequent high floods, which sometimes do in- 
credible mischief to the haughs and meadow pasture, tearing up 
and carrying away the rich deep soil on its banks, and occasional- 
ly burying whole acres under a bed of unproductive sand and gra- 
vel. The practicability of embanking this river is an important 
subject of consideration to the proprietors ; and those who have 
resided longest upon its banks are generally of opinion that this 
may be done, and at an expense which, when compared with the 
importance of the object, might be called inconsiderable. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The rocks composing the hills in 
this parish belong to the transition series, and are the compact 
felspar-porphyry and the pitchstone-porphyry, — the latter of which 
affords very excellent specimens. The felspar-porphyry is by far 
the most abundant rock, not only of the Yetholm Hills, but of the 
whole Cheviot range. Numerous nodules of agate and common 
jasper are met with in this rock ; and these are also dispersed m 
abundance over the surrounding plains, and are very frequent in 
the gravel of the Bowmont Water ami other streams. 'It is by no 



YETHOLM. iqi 

means easy to ascertain in what manner the rock above described 
as the pitchstone-porphyry, occurs in this parish. Apparently it 
is in the form of an irregular bed, or in detached masses subordi- 
nate to the felspar-porphyry. Possibly it may be connected with 
the great dike of this rock, which is described as crossing the Che- 
viot range some miles to the west of this, in a direction nearly east 
and west. Subordinate, also, to the felspar-porphyry, is the quartz 
rock which occupies the summit of Thirlestane hill, where both 
rocks are much intermixed with white steatite. On the same hill 
are quarries of the compact felspar rock, containing amygdaloidal 
crystals of calcareous spar, probably only a variety of the porphyry, 
which here occurs of every sort of colour and structure. The most 
remarkable rock on this hill, perhaps, is a partial deposit of the 
new red sandstone in thin strata of a grey and reddish-brown co- 
lour, hard and compact, but unable for any long period to resist 
the action of the weather. This rock, as you descend from the 
higher ground of Yetholm, towards the north and west, into the 
vale of the Tweed, soon becomes the prevailing formation, and 
where it first occurs, it is found resting on the felspar-porphyry. 
There is no appearance of metals of any kind in these rocks, 
farther than a considerable abundance of the sulphate of barytes 
and white steatite, in a rocky and romantic little glen on the top of 
Yetholm Law, called the « Tod Craigs," may seem to indicate 
the probable neighbourhood of copper or lead. From the cir- 
cumstances stated, there seems little probability that coal, or even 
lime, will be discovered in this parish. 

The bed of the Bowmont affords the finest sharp sand for build- 
ing. The natural embankments of the river are all composed of 
gravel. The soil on the lower parts of the parish, which is some- 
times of considerable depth, rests also on gravel. Hence in dry 
summers the crops are apt to be burnt up ; and in moist seasons 
they succeed best. 

In the vale of Cherrytrees are probably an hundred acres of 
moss, which, however, have been drained, and are now under cul- 
tivation The average depth of the moss is eight feet, in some 
places fourteen feet. Trunks of various trees, as willows, birches 
but especially oaks of a black colour, and extremely hard, were 
discovered in it. 

Botany.— There arc but few rare plants in the parish ; and the 
whole range of the Cheviots, indeed, disappoints very much the 
expectations of the botanist. In the vale of Bowmont are the

in the dry channel of the river Thlaspi arvense. On the hills are 
the Rubus Cham&amp;morus, Cistus Helianthemum, Vaccinium Vitis- 
Idcea, Tormentilla reptans, Empetrum nigrum, Hieracium pulmo- 
narium, Comus Suecica perhaps on the borders of the parish only, 
not in it. In and on the margin of Yetholm Loch, and in other 
moist situations, are the Cicuta virosa, Vaccinium oxycoccus abun- 
dant in Hoselaw Loch, on the borders of the parish, Potamogetou

ing in its general characters with the Anemone ranunculoides, for 
which it was at first mistaken. 

II. — Civil History. 
It is said that, " in 1304, Edward the First came to Yetham on 
his return from his northern expedition ;" Caledonia, Vol.ii. p. 193. 
There is a tradition that the Douglas appointed Yetholm kirk as 
the place of rendezvous for the Scottish army, before marching to 
the celebrated battle of Otterburn. It is also said, and perhaps 
with more truth, that after the battle of Flodden Field, the scene 
of which is situated about six miles to the east of the parish, the 
bodies of the Scottish nobles who fell in that engagement were 
brought and buried in the church and churchyard of Yetholm, as 
the nearest consecrated ground in Scotland to the field of battle. 
It is a better known fact, though traditional, I believe, like the 
others, that, in 1745, a small party of Scotch Highlanders, who 
followed the fortunes of Prince Charles, marched from the south 
through the parish and village of Yetholm, up the Bowmont 
Water, to receive some supplies of money, which had been re- 
mitted from France, and entrusted to the care of a Northumber- 
land gentleman, Charles Selby, Esq. of Earl. An old man, lately 
deceased, in Town Yetholm, distinctly remembered having seen 
these Highlanders passing his father's house.

a small property in this parish, now in the possession of Adam 
B. Boyd, Esq. of Cherry trees, and one of the physicians of 
Charles IL, seems to have been a chemist of some celebrity in . 
his day. In the old mansion-house of Thirlestane, lately pulled 
down, a room, which he had probably used as his laboratory, con- 
tinued to retain the name of the " warlock's room."   See Note 
to the 11th chapter of Waverley, Vol. i. regarding the ancient fa- 
mily of Scott of Thirlestane in this parish. 

Antiquities. — Yetholm churchyard has probably been the buri- 
al place of many an ancient border chief. About two or three 
years ago, a stone coffin was discovered nearly six feet below 
the surface, and unfortunately was broken before it could be as- 
certained what it was. The stone in which the body lay was an 
entire mass. It contained a skeleton of unusual size. Still more 
lately, in the same churchyard, was discovered a square erection, 
consisting of four rough stones, set at right angles, and covered 
by a flat stone above, in which was found only a skull, which 
crumbled into dust when exposed for a short time to the air. On 
the borders of the parish, at Primside mill, under a large flat 
stone in the middle of the road, was found some years ago an urn, 
of very rude workmanship, and containing ashes. It was lately in 
the possession of Mr Oliphant at Marlefield. 

There are two British forts in the parish, one situated on the 
top of Castlelaw, a hill on the farm of Vencheon ; the other on 
the summit of a higher hill, called the Camp Hill, on the farm 
of Halterburn. They are fortified with two fosses and ramparts, 
are probably two or three hundred yards in diameter, and from 
their situation must have been very strong, almost impregnable 
fortifications.— On the top of Yetholm Law, there are the remains 
of a very extensive and singular fortification, the general form of 
which is square, but very irregular, -its irregularity, perhaps, occa- 
sioned by the inequality of the ground. It has been supposed to

be a Roman camp, and the Romans were undoubtedly in this im- 
mediate neighbourhood. — On the farm of Mindrum, in Northum- 
berland, on the very borders of the parish, was lately ploughed up 
a vase or bottle of brass containing 500 Roman silver coins. — On 
a little spot of ground, now a peninsula, but at one time probably 
an island of Yetholm Loch, there formerly stood one of those old 
towers or castles so frequent in the south of Scotland. It was the 
baronial residence of the Kers of Lochtower, a branch, probably, 
of the Kers of Cessford, or the Roxburgh family. This ancient 
tower and the surrounding scenery suggested to the author of Wa- 
verley the picture he draws of Avenel Castle in the Monastery. 
See Note at the end of the 7th chapter, Vol. ii. 

Land-owners. — The number of heritors or proprietors in this 
parish is five. Of these, Mr Wauchope of Niddrie possesses 
nearly one-half of the parish, and is patron also of the church. 
The Marquis of Tweeddale is the second heritor, and now pos- 
sesses what, was formerly the property of Sir William Bennet of 
Grubbet, the friend and patron of the poet of Ednam and of Allan 
Ramsay, whose " Gentle Shepherd" has sometimes been ascrib- 
ed to Sir William Bennet, and sometimes regarded as a juvenile 
production of Thomson. 

It is unfortunate that there is only one heritor who resides in 
the parish, and therefore only one mansion-house. The grounds 
of Cherrytrees are very tastefully ornamented with wood. The 
house is a small, modern, but handsome building. 

Parochial Registers. — The earliest parochial registers extant 
are from 1690, and from that period to the present they have been 
kept with considerable regularity. There is little doubt but 
earlier registers did exist ; and there is a report that, accidentally 
1 suppose, they were destroyed by the family of one of the former 
ministers of the parish. They consist of three large folio volumes 
completed, and a fourth is now adding to their number. There is 
nothing particularly interesting in them. 

III. — Population. 
In the former Statistical Account, the parish is supposed to have 
doubled its population during last century ; and the cause of this 
rapid increase is stated to be the destruction of several villages in 
the neighbouring parishes of Hownam, Morbattle and Linton, 
the inhabitants of which had withdrawn to the two villages of \ et- 
holm, encouraged, perhaps, by the easy rate at which the proprie- 
tors of these villages had granted them fens. Another probable cause 
might be the practice of uniting many small farms into one large one.

In 1755, the population was 699 In 181 1, . \13S 

1786, 1070 1821, . 1280 

1801, 1011 1831, . 1289 

The increase of population in the country parts of the parish is 
owing entirely, of course, to the great improvements in the system 
of agriculture, and the consequent greater demand for labourers : 
the quantity of land now under cultivation in the parish being 
much more than doubled since the end of last century. The 
same cause has also affected the population of the two villages, the 
greater part of which depends for employment on the farmers. 
Other subordinate causes might be mentioned, as the great temp- 
tation to, and prevalence of, smuggling, from the vicinity of the 
villages to England,— an occupation from which a fifth or sixth of 
the population some years ago derived their means of subsistence ; 
and the facility of persons in decayed circumstances procuring a 
room or lodging in the villages, where, after a residence of three 
years, they very frequently become burdens on the parish. 

The average number of children in a family is 3£ or 4 ; but 
among the gipsies not less than 6 or 6£. I have no means of as- 
certaining the average number of births, deaths, and marriages for 
the last seven years; the registration of baptisms having been much 
neglected, and no registry of deaths being kept at all. 

Character, fyc. of the People.— The people, in general, enjoy re- 
markably good health. About the middle of last year  1 829,  there 
were sixteen persons between eighty and ninety years of age; and in 
the churchyard every sixth or seventh person whose memory is record- 
ed seems to have died betwixt seventy and ninety years of acre. With 
a few exceptions, the labouring classes seem, in general, to be in 
tolerably comfortable circumstances. The villages alone give em- 
ployment to two or three butchers, and four bakers. As by 
far the greater part of the population, however, derive their sub- 
sistence from their employment, by the farmers, whatever depresses 
the agricultural interest must tend more or less to injure them, by 
throwing them out of employment. Accordingly, during the last 
two years which have been so trying to farmers in general, the 
relief required to be extended to the poor has been much increased. 
The illegal practice of smuggling, till lately so prevalent in this 
neighbourhood, and so openly practised, must no doubt have had 
a very demoralizing influence upon a considerable portion of the 
population ; otherwise I am disposed to regard them, in general, as 
a quiet and well disposed people. 

Gipsies. — Kirk Yetholm has long been known and somewhat 
celebrated as the residence of the largest colony in Scotland, I 



166 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



believe, of that singular and interesting race of people, the Gip- 
sies, whose origin is involved in so much uncertainty and doubt. 
I am indeed far from regarding the " muggers and tinkers" of 
Kirk Yetholm as the pure unmingled gipsy race, whose forefa- 
thers emigrated or were driven into Europe from Hindostan or 
Egypt. They are much less distinguishable as a peculiar race 
now than they appear to have been formerly. Still their language, 
their predatory and erratic. propensities, and, in general, their dark 
or dusky complexion, black piercing eyes, and Hindoo features, 
sufficiently betray the oi-iginal of this despised and neglected race. 
At what period they first arrived and settled in Kirk Yetholm I 
have not been able with any accuracy to ascertain. The family of 
the Faa's seem to have been the first who settled there, and pro- 
bably about the beginning of last century. Their number in 1797, 
according to the former Statistical Account, was 50. In 1816, ac- 
cording to the late Bailie Smith of Kelso whose interesting ac- 
count of the Kirk Yetholm gipsies was published in Blackwood's 
Magazine for May 1817, the number was 109. At present there 
are about 100. Of these, one gipsy female is married to a trades- 
man in the village ; and one woman not belonging to the tribe is 
married to a gipsy, whom she accompanies in his wanderings. 

That the gipsies of Kirk Yetholm have a peculiar language is 
fully credited by most of the other inhabitants of the village, many 
of whom have not only heard them converse with each other in this 
language, but also understand a number of the words. It was my 
intention to have given a list of such of these words as I have been 
able to collect; but I shall at present merely mention this gene- 
ral fact regarding them, that, on comparing this list with the spe- 
cimens furnished by Hoyland from Grellman, I find that the lan- 
guage spoken by the Kirk Yetholm clans corresponds very nearly 
with that spoken by the English and Turkish gipsies, and that 
most of these also have been traced to an Indian origin. On this 
subject,- however, they observe a profound secresy. 

Their occupations are various. There are two who manufac- 
ture horn into spoons : one tinker ; and most or all of the rest are 
" muggers," or, as they prefer being called, " potters," or " travel- 
lers," who carry earthen-ware about the country for sale. These last 
also frequently employ themselves in making besoms and baskets. 
The gipsy, in general, enjoys but few of the comforts of home, — wit h 
the exception of the spoon-manufucturer, who must remain sta- 
tionary to fabricate his wares, which the females usually dispose

YETHOLM. 



167 



of at neighbouring markets, and in the surrounding country. The 
horn-spoons, or " cutties," are very generally used by the peasan- 
try, and before harvest are purchased for the use of the reapers. 
Most readers are probably familiar with the appearance of a gip- 
sy tent. It is generally situated in the least frequented parts of 
the country, probably beside some plantation, which supplies it at 
once with shelter and with fuel. The women carry about their 
manufactured articles for sale ; while the men either remain with 
the cart, or occupy themselves in fishing and poaching, in both of 
which they are generally expert. The children accompany the 
females, or collect decayed wood for fuel. At night the whole fa- 
mily sleep under the tent, the covering of which is generally wool- 
len cloth, and is the same usually that covers their cart during 
the day. Occasionally two or more families travel together. A 
dog, chained under the cart, protects their property, and at 
night gives warning of danger. Each family generally travels a 
particular district, seldom remaining more than a few days in 
one place. This is their mode of life, even in the coldest and 
wettest weather of spring, or the beginning of winter ; and some- 
times the tents are but scantily provided with warm and comfort- 
able clothing. The ground, from which, while they sleep, they 
are separated only by ablanket or slight mattress laid on some straw, 
must frequently, of course, be completely saturated with rain ; 
nevertheless I have never understood that these people are, even 
so much as others, troubled with colds and rheumatisms, to which 
this mode of life seems almost unavoidably to expose them. In- 
deed, both at home and abroad, they enjoy the best health. 
In cases of sickness they are usually unwilling to call in a me- 
dical practitioner. Before autumn all return who are able and 
willing to hire themselves as reapers. After -harvest work is 
over, they set off once more to the country, where they continue 
until the severity of winter drives them home. At home they 
are usually quiet and peaceable. Their quarrels, which do not 
often take place, and are only among themselves, are very violent 
while they continue : and the subject or ground of quarrel is sel- 
dom known but to themselves. On these occasions they are much 
addicted to profane swearing, and but too much so at other times. 
I think it deserving of remark, that most of the murders for which 
gipsies have been condemned seem to have been committed upon 
persons of their own tribe, in the heat and violence of passion, the 
consequence of some old family feud, or upon strangers of other 
clans for invading what they regard as their territory, or the dis- 



168 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



trict they have been wont to travel. Their character for truth 
and honesty is certainly not high. Their pilfering and plundering 
habits, practised chiefly when from home, are pretty generally 
known. Their money debts, however, they discharge, I believe, 
as punctually as others; and there is a species of honour among 
them, that, if trusted, they will not deceive, and a principle of 
gratitude, that, if treated kindly, they will not injure. Numerous 
instances can be referred to of the grateful sense they entertain of 
favours bestowed on them, and of the length of time they will re- 
member a kindness done either to themselves or their relatives. 
A deep spirit of revenge is the darkest trait in their character. 
Yet may most of the savage features of the gipsy character be 
referred to their loose, wandering, and disorderly life; to their 
lamentable ignorance of the duties which they owe both to God 
and man, and their total want of restraint by any consideration, 
moral or religious. I am not aware that they are much addicted 
to ardent spirits, or that there is any habitual drunkard belonging 
to their tribe. 

Most of the tribe are able to read, though very indifferently. 
They seem alive to the advantages of education, and speak of it as 
the only legacy which a poor man can leave to his children ; but 
the migratory habits of the people prevent their children from re- 
maining long enough at school ever to make much progress. The 
children are generally remarked as clever. One large family 
of children have been taught to read by their mother at home ; 
and I have known a father when he was able who gave a lesson 
every day to his two children, in the course of their migrations. I 
may mention, as a proof of the anxiety of parents on this subject, 
that most of them have again and again professed their willingness 
to leave their children at home throughout the year for instruction, 
could they only afford it, and entrust them to the charge of some 
prudent person. This is a great step to their improvement, con- 
sidering how extremely attached the gipsy parent generally is to 
his children ; — that attachment to their offspring being one of those 
traits or features of character which distinguishes the tribe where- 
ever they are found. Most of the younger children have attended 
the Sabbath school, when at home; and not only do the parents 
willingly send them, but even the children themselves seem de- 
lighted to attend. I have remarked in most of these children, 
what may account in some degree for this desire on their parts, a 
spirit of emulation, and strong desire to please those who will take 
the trouble to notice them. Even a few of the adults have attend- 



YETHOLM. 



169 



ed the Sabbath school ; but many are kept back by the shame of 
appearing more deficient than others of their own age. 

A great majority of the children have been baptized ; and there 
are probably not so many illegitimate children among them as 
among the lower ranks of society in general. They almost always 
intermarry in their own tribe, and are generally dissatisfied when 
this is not the case. 

Of late, the greater number of the tribe have attended church 
occasionally, and some with exemplary regularity. Their ideas 
on the subject of religion, however, are extremely limited, and er- 
roneous. Nor can they well be otherwise, considering their unset- 
tled way of life, and their defective education. Yet they profess a 
general respect for religion ; and, when absent from church, excuse 
themselves on the ground that they have no suitable or decent 
clothing. 

I have not been able to ascertain whether they entertain any 
peculiar sentiments on the subject of religion. Like most ig- 
norant persons, they are very superstitious. All of them profess 
to belong to the Established church ; and there are no Dissen- 
ters among them. Eight or nine of them are communicants. 
Most of them possess Bibles, which have been purchased, how- 
ever, rather for the use of their children, when at school, than 
for any other purpose. Those who have not Bibles, would pur- 
chase them, they say, could they afford it. Most of them are 
indeed very poor, if we may judge from their apparel and their 
household accommodations, all of which are inferior to those pos- 
sessed by the common class of labourers in the country, f 

It is a fact not very creditable to the wisdom of Britain, that, 
while so much has been done for the heathen, no attempt has yet 
been made in Scotland, to civilize and enlighten those wandering- 
tribes, who during three-fourths of the year, in pursuing the avoca- 
tions, from which they derive their subsistence, have no pastor, no 
church, no school, no home, and are deprived of the means and 
opportunities of acquiring every kind of instruction. The attempt, 
if properly made, would, I am persuaded, be in numerous in- 
stances successful. Society would be the principal gainers by 
the success of any such scheme. They would render their own 
homes, persons, and property more secure ; while they would dis- 
charge a long-neglected duty to a considerable number of their

fellow creatures and fellow subjects, and rescue an interesting race

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — There are nearly 6000 probably 5700 acres in 
the parish : of these more than 2600 are arable, and more than 
3000 remain in permanent pasture. There is a common of 200 
acres, called Yetholm Common, on which the inhabitants of 
Kirk Yetholm have the privilege of cutting turf and grazing their 
cattle : it is a wild moorish piece of ground, upon the borders, claim- 
ed, I believe, by both kingdoms. On the estates of Cherrytrees 
and Thirlestane, and on some small spots on the barony of Loch- 
tower, there may be about 100 acres altogether, planted in wood. 
As remarked in the last Statistical Account, with one or two ex- 
ceptions, " the proprietors seem but little disposed to plant, 
though there is abundance of land fit for no other purpose." The 
planting of a few hundred acres, besides the beauty and ornament 
it would add to the parish, would greatly improve and increase the 
value of the remainder of the land, and afford, what is so much re- 
quired in the more exposed parts of the parish, shelter to the far- 
mers' stock. 

Husbandry. — There are about 450 acres round the villages of 
Town and Kirk Yetholm, farmed by the inhabitants in lots, vary- 
ing from 2 to 30 acres. These fields are held from year to year ; 
but, so long as the occupiers are able to pay their rents, they 
are very rarely disturbed. The rents they bring are from L. 2 
to L.3, 10s. an acre; and, considering the nature of the soil, 
and the situation of the country, this is regarded as extremely 
high. Many of the occupiers of these fields are industrious trades- 
men and day-labourers, who, at their leisure hours, or when not 
otherwise engaged, employ themselves in the cultivation of their 
little farms, or retain them only for the convenience of a cow's 
pasture. The other small tenants, who farm a greater number of 
acres, are occupied more exclusively in their cultivation. They 
keep, for this purpose, one or two horses, with which they also drive 
coals to the other inhabitants of the villages, or to Jedburgh, where 
they obtain a higher price for'them ; or drive lime to the farmers, 
who usually prefer hiring to driving with their own horses the ma- 
nure of this description which they require. The other farms in 
this parish are from about 400 to 1800 acres. The larger farms 
consist more than one-half of sheep pasture. The duration of the 
leases is from sixteen to twenty-one years. The older cultivated 
lands are enclosed with hedges; the more lately enclosed lands.

with dry stone walls ; and the sheep pastures, with what is called a 
" ring-fence," or " march-fence ;" i. e. a dry stone dike or wall 
surrounding the farm. The mode of cultivation adopted in this 
parish is usually what is called the four and five-shift rotation ; the 
former being' practised on the village lands, the latter on the larger 
farms. This mode of husbandry consists in taking a crop of tur- 
nips the first year ; a crop of wheat or barley, sown off with grass, 
the second year; a crop of hay the third year; and a crop of oats 
the fourth year. According to the five-shift rotation, the ground 
is allowed to lie in pasture the fourth year, and on the fifth it is 
ploughed up and sown with oats. In some cases the ground re- 
mains in pasture two years, which is called the sixth-shift hus- 
bandry. There is no bare fallow in the parish, or extremely little. 
One-fifth nearly of the arable land of the parish is annually sown 
off with turnips. 

Probably one-third of the oats, and nearly two-thirds of the 
barley grown in the parish, may be sold and exported. All the 
wheat, and probably more than is grown in the parish, is consumed 
in it : all the other crops, as of hay, turnips, potatoes, &amp;c. are con- 
sumed at home. 

The manure usually employed is common manure and lime, 
which latter is driven a distance of ten miles, and costs lOd. 
per boll, or 3s. 4d. a cart-load, a single horse drawing four bolls. 
Forty bolls of lime are usually given to the acre. Bone ma- 
nure, which is brought from Berwick, a distance of twenty miles, 
has been extensively used of late years in the parish, and is found 
to succeed remarkably well : it is used for turnips, 2 quarters or 
16 bolls being required per acre. 

Live-Stock.— The farmers depend less upon the agricultural 
produce of the land than upon their sheep. The sheep usually 
preferred for the higher parts of the parish, or hilly pastures, are 
the Cheviot. The Leicester, or bng-woolled sheep, are preferred 
for the lower and cultivated parts of the parish ; and on farms 
partly arable and partly hill pasture, a cross between the Cheviot 
and Leicester is found to answer very well. The number of 
sheep in the parish may be about 4800 : of these about 1800 may 
be Leicester, 1000 Cheviot, and 2000 half-bred, or a cross be- 
tween the other two. Few or no lambs are sold. The cattle 
usually preferred, and, indeed, the only breed of cattle in the pa- 
rish, are the short-horned or Teesdale, both for giving milk and 
for fattening. 

Rent and Price of Land, c— The average rent of the arable 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



land may be L. 1, 5s., and of the pasture land 10s. per acre. The 
price of land in the parish varies, of course, according to its qua- 
lity : good land, per statute acre, has been sold as high as L. 100 ; 
but the average price of good land may be considered about L. 50 
per acre, and of pasture land L. 10. The price of land is here gene- 
rally calculated to be equal to twenty-seven years' rent. Owing to 
the fall in the price of produce, the value of land is much deteriorat- 
ed, and pasture-land especially, has fallen nearly one-half in value. 
The total land-rent of the parish, as nearly as I can ascertain, is 
L. 5600. In 1797, it was L. 2104; and, in the recollection of. 
individuals then alive, it had increased in value three times. Two 
or three proprietors farm their own land. 

At the beginning of this century the spirit of improvement was 
very great. In 1797, there were only 1170 acres under tillage; 
whereas now, there are upwards of 2600 or probably many more. 
At the end of last century, sufficient corn was not grown in the 
parish for home consumption ; now a considerable proportion is 
exported ; while yet the same number of sheep is maintained. 
The farms are cultivated according to the newest and most ap- 
proved methods, and in no respect is the system or mode of agri- 
culture inferior to that of any other part of the country ; but, from 
the high state of the rents at present, there is no encouragement 
whatever given by the landlords to their tenants for the improve- 
ment of their farms. 

Commerce. — There are no branches of commerce or manufac- 
tures carried on in this parish, with the exception, perhaps, of the 
illicit commerce of smuggling whisky across the border, which, I 
have said, formerly gave employment and subsistence to one-fifth 
or one-sixth of the inhabitants of the two villages. Of this com- 
modity, I am informed that from L. 10,000 to L. 20,000 worth 
annually have been sold from Yetholm into England in this man- 
ner ; but now the quantity disposed of illegally for the English mar- 
ket is scarcely worth calculating. Within the last three or four 
years, effectual means have been taken by a stricter police, and by 
heavy fines imposed upon delinquents, to put an end to this de- 
moralizing and illicit trafic, which have succeeded in a great mea- 
sure for the present. A considerable trade is also carried on here 
in buying cows in Northumberland, and driving them for sale to 
the Edinburgh markets. 

Rate of Wages.— Masons, 2s. or 2s. 6d. per day ; carpenters, 2s. or 
2s. 6d.; tailors, Is. 6d. with meat; women labourers, 8d. to Is.; men 
do. in summer, Is. 6d.to Is. 8d. ; do. do. in harvest, 2s. with meat.

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Pillages and Markets. — The only villages in this parish are 
Town Yetholm and Kirk Yetholm, in both of which there has 
been usually a Baron Bailie ; one appointed by the Marquis of 
Tweeddale, the other by Mr Wauchope of Niddrie, the superiors 
of the villages. In Town Yetholm there was formerly a weekly 
market, which is now discontinued. Kelso, Coldstream, and Ber- 
wick are the nearest weekly markets. 

Means of Communication. — No public conveyances, as coaches, 
&amp;c. pass through the parish. There is no post-office at present — 
a disadvantage that might easily be remedied. There is a com- 
munication by carriers between Kelso and Yetholm, five days in 
the week, and more rarely with Coldstream and Berwick. The 
length of turnpike-road in the parish is four miles, generally kept 
in good repair, and managed by the trustees for the district of Kel- 
so. There are two toll-houses on these roads, both of which are 
let annually, by public sale, and at present for L. 180. The turn- 
pike-roads communicate with Kelso, Coldstream, Berwick, Wooler, 
Jedburgh, and with the coal and lime districts. The bye-roads, 
kept in repair by the statute-labour money, are about five miles in 
length. A very neat bridge, erected last year across the Bowmont, 
between the villages of Town and Kirk Yetholm, is one of the 
greatest improvements that have taken place in the parish for many 
years. 

Ecclesiastical State.- The parish church is situated in Kirk 
Yetholm, and no part of the population is distant from it more 
than two miles. It is a very wretched and insufficient building. 
An addition, larger. than the original church, was built to the west 
end of it in 1609. The age of the east end is unknown. It is 
much too small for the population. Usually, it is most uncom- 
fortably crowded, and still one-third nearly "of the church-going 
population are unable to find accommodation. It is but fair, 
however, to state, that a considerable number of those who attend 
the Established church are from the English border, the inha- 
bitants of which are generally Scotch and Presbyterians. The 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



church aflords accommodation for only 400 ; the population being 
nearly 1300. It is most inconvenient in point of shape, being 
nearly 80 feet long, and from 17 to 20 broad. But, as this goes to 
press, the heritors have given their consent to the erection of a new 
church, which, it is hoped, will be commenced early in spring. The 
heritors have lately provided liberally for the accommodation of the 
minister, by repairing and building a large addition to the old manse 
built in 1788, and it is now a very commodious and even hand- 
some building. The glebe is generally considered to consist of 
from 18 to 20 acres, about one-half of which is excellent land. The 
amount of stipend is 14 chalders, and L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion 
elements. Mr Wauchope of Niddrie is patron. The last aug- 
mentation was granted in 1820. -The valued rent of the parish is 
L. 7049, 13s. 4d. Scots. 

There are two dissenting chapels in the parish, both of which are 
in Town Yetholm. One belongs to the Old Light Burghers, the 
other to the United Associate Synod. Both have been built within 
the last fifty years. The ministers are paid from the seat rents and 
collections, the one being promised, I believe, L. 70, the other 
L. 108 annually. Of old and young in the parish, 888 may belong 
to the Established church ; and the number of Dissenters may be 
about 412. The number of communicants at the Established 
church in July last was 460. Of these, however, several are from 
England. The church is remarkably well attended, and the people 
generally are attentive to the public ordinances of religion. One , 
probable cause of the number of Dissenters may be the want of ac- 
commodation in the parish church. 

Education. — The parish school-house,' erected in 1833, is, with- 
out exception, the handsomest building of the kind in the county. 
It is attended by 100 scholars ; and the amount of the teacher's 
fees may be L. 30 a-year ; but he has also L. 6 as clerk to the 
heritors. There are also two unendowed schools in the pa- 
rish ; one in Town and the other in Kirk Yetholm. The num- 
ber attending each may be from 60 to 80. Several of these 
children attend from the borders. The salary of the parochial 
teacher is the maximum, or two chalders of oatmeal. The fees at 
all the schools per quarter are, for reading, 2s. 6d. ; for reading 
and writing, 3s.; for reading, writing, and arithmetic, 3s. 6d.; for 
Latin, Greek, practical mathematics, and geography, 10s. 6d. 
Latin and Greek are not taught in the private schools. 

The total number of scholars at all the schools in the parish is 



YETHOLM. 



175 



•240 ; of whom about 40 are from England and adjoining parishes 
in Scotland. 

Under fifteen years of age, there are very few, if any, of a pro- 
per age who cannot read and write. Above fifteen years of age 
there may be many who cannot write, but few or none who cannot 
read. The people seem, in general, to be alive to the benefits of 
education. 

Literature. — There is one parochial library, consisting of 500 
volumes ; one congregational library connected with one of the dis- 
senting meetings ; and two Sabbath school libraries. 

Charitable and Economical Institutions. — There is a Friendly So- 
ciety, which has been in existence for several years. Its capital is 
L. 370. It might probably be made much more useful, but it seems 
somehow or other to be mismanaged. A society was lately esta- 
blished in the parish for the purpose of supplying the poor, espe- 
cially poor and single females, with spinning. Its capital is very 
small, and is daily diminishing ; otherwise the benefits of this in- 
stitution might be greatly extended. A Clothing Society has been 
more lately established. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The number of poor upon the roll 
in this parish is very great. The average number each year dur- 
ing the last seven years who have received parochial relief is sixty- 
five persons. The average sum raised yearly for this purpose by 
assessment one-half of which is paid by the heritors, the other 
half by the tenants, during the same number of years, is L. 252, 
8s. lOd. The average sum, therefore, which each pauper receives 
in the year is L. 3, 17s. 6fd. The session may have a sum of from 
L. 15 to L. 20 at their disposal, from L. 12 to L. 15 of which are 
raised by collections at church, and left in the hands of the session, 
to be distributed at their discretion among the poor of the parish, 
either on or not on the roll. It is unfortunate, that, with very few 
exceptions, there is little disposition among the poor to refrain from 
seeking parochial aid; neither do they seem to consider it in any 
sense as degrading. 

Obviously one great cause of the number of the poor in this pa- 
rish, is the facility with which aged and single persons, who have 
probably spent their lives in England, where they find it ex- 
tremely difficult to establish a residence, can procure a room or 
lodging, of any dimensions, in the villages of Yetholm, where 
they contrive to subsist, by their own labour, for a certain number 
of years ; and finally, when unable to work, get enrolled on the 



173

permanent list of poor. On two sides, they are surrounded by un- 
inhabited and uncultivated mountains, and on the other side by a 
country more than one-half of which remains in permanent pas- 
ture. There are no trade, commerce, or manufactures carried 
on in the parish. It is, therefore, obviously impossible that the 
neighbourhood should furnish employment and subsistence to one- 
half of the 1000 persons residing in Town and Kirk Yetholm, 
especially as farmers have, residing on their land, and under their 
roof, the requisite number of farm-servants. The consequences 
have been, smuggling and an excessive proportion of pauperism. 
To diminish, therefore, the number of houses, would be to dimi- 
nish the vice and pauperism of the parish. 

Fairs, Inns, fyc. — There are two annual fairs in each of the vil- 
lages : the Kirk Yetholm summer fair being for the sale of Cheviot 
hogs, and cattle : the Town Yetholm summer fair being for lambs 
and wool : the Kirk Yetholm winter fair is for the sale of ewes, 
wedders, and cattle : at the Town Yetholm winter fair, nothing is 
now done. There are three or four inns in Town Yetholm, and 
three in Kirk Yetholm. Some of these furnish comfortable ac- 
commodation for travellers. Besides these there are seven houses 
where ale and spirits are sold, and the latter chiefly for the Eng- 
lish market. The imperial weights and measures are now univer- 
sally used. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The parish of Yetholm is far from manure and markets. Its 
situation on the borders of England presents great temptation to 
smuggling ; and the assessment for the relief of the poor is very 
high. The comforts of the industrious part of the population would 
be increased, the poor rates would be lightened, smuggling would 
be permanently prevented, and the morals of the people improved, 
by the diminution of the town, and by the equalization of the duty 
on spirits in both kingdoms. There is no improvement so much 
wanted in the parish as planting, both for utility and ornament. I 
have already mentioned the disadvantage to the parish, arising from 
the insufficient state of the church. The non-residence of heritors 
may be mentioned as another disadvantage. Were these disad- 
vantages removed, the salubrity of the atmosphere, and beauty and 
variety of the scenery, might induce persons in more comfortable 
circumstances to settle in the parish.

PRESBYTERY OF JEDBURGH, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOIDALE. 



THE REV. ANDREW MILROY, MINISTER. 



• — Topography and Natural History. 
Extent, Boundaries.— The parish of Crailing comprehend- 
ing, under this name, the ancient parishes of Nisbet and Spittal 
annexed to it, may be described as occupying about 4 square 
miles in length and breadth. It is bounded on the north by a por- 
tion of the parish of Roxburgh, which extends in that direction ; 
on the south by Jedburgh; on the west by Ancrum j and on the 
east by Eckford. 

Topographical Appearances.— -In its general aspect, it presents 
the appearance of a wide valley with sloping banks on either side, 
the Tiviot flowing eastward through the centre, and dividing the 
parish into two nearly equal portions. 

Name.— Although the name Crailing is the general designation 
of the whole parish, the two sides of the river still retain their dis- 
tinctive appellations. Nisbet constitutes the division on the north 
of the Tiviot, and Crailing the southern half. Of the origin of 
these names I cannot pretend to give any authoritative account. 
Crailing has been supposed to derive its designation from being si- 
tuated on the banks of the Oxnam water,— Oaz-fya according to 
Chalmers m his Caledonia signifies the brisk-pool, and this name 
he imagines to have been given by the British settlers on the Ox- 
nam, from the occasional ebullitions of this mountain stream  
This rivulet intersects the Crailing or south side of the parish de- 
scending northward till it join the Tiviot about half a mile below 
the village. It has its source in the border hills, but derives its 
name from the parish of Oxnam, through which it flows. In the 
bed of this stream, which in summer is exceedingly small, but in 
winter swells rapidly, and comes down in powerful torrents, there

are picked up good specimens of jasper. Its banks, as it flows 
through the grounds near Crailing House, are precipitous, and pre- 
sent a front of soft red sandstone. Nisbet also seems to owe its 
name to its locality. It is an appellation applied to several places 
both in England and Scotland ; and the site of all of them, having 
some proximity to a hill, vindicates the supposition of its being of 
Saxon origin. Nes, Nese, Nase, in that language, signifies a promon- 
tory or projection. According to this conjecture, the idea con- 
veyed by " Nisbet" is its being the front or nose-piece of a hill, — 
a characteristic applicable enough to the Nisbet in question ; for 
on this side of the parish the ground rises to a considerable accli- 
vity, which bears the name of Piniel-heugh, and is a point visible 
at the distance of many miles. This green hill commands a most 
pleasing and extensive view of the whole country around, taking in 
the windings of the Tiviot westward, Tweeddale to the north, the 
rano-e of Cheviots southward, and the whole Merse as far as the 

O m 

ocean in an eastern direction. It has been rendered more conspi- 
cuous by a monumental pillar erected on its summit by the late 
Marquis of Lothian, in commemoration of the victory obtained at 
Waterloo.. 

Piniel-heugh is a formation of whinstone. Nearer the river, 
and close to the village of Nisbet, are found excellent strata of 
sandstone of a light colour, and of sufficient hardness for the pur- 
poses of building. Two quarries have been opened, from which 
were obtained the stones employed in building the new mansion at 
Monteviot ; some of the blocks measured twelve feet in length. 

Soil, c. — In the former Statistical Account, a proof of the fine- 
ness of the soil and mildness of climate is furnished, which is worth 
preserving. It appears that about that time forty years ago an 
attempt was made to cultivate tobacco in Scotland. " In one sea- 
son a tenant in this district drew L. 1 15 for tobacco plants, and af- 
terwards raised a crop on 12 or 13 acres, which he sold upon the 
ground for L. 320 : but an act of Parliament intervening, the pur- 
chaser was unable to fulfil his bargain, and the farmer was com- 
pelled to dispose of his tobacco to Government at only 4d. per 
pound, at which rate it brought him only L. 104." 

The soil of this parish is peculiarly dry and favourable to health, 

" This monument is a cylindrical column, with a spiral staircase. Its height is 
150 feet. It stands on an ample base, and was built in a very substantial way from 
whinstone quarried on the spot. It bears the following inscription :— To the Duke 
of Wellington and the British Army, William Kerr VI. Marquis of Lothian and 
his Tenantry dedicate this monument, XXX June MDCCCXV.

nor are there any particular diseases which prevail amongst us. 1 
know not whether it be worth while to state, that during one season 
two or three fatal instances of croup occurred among the children 
at Nisbet. As this afflictive malady is apt to be induced by humi- 
dity, it is just possible that the vicinity of the Tiviot in a wet season 
may be ranked among the exciting causes. 

II. — Civil History. 
Parochial Registers. — The parish registers do not reach farther 
back than the beginning of last century, nor do they contain any 
facts worthy of notice. 

Eminent Men.— This parish, however, is not unconnected with 
events well calculated to invest it with historical interest. The 
circumstance of its having been the scene of the ministry of Cal- 
derwood, the church historian, and the birth-place of Samuel 
Rutherford, is sufficient to render it a spot hallowed by associa- 
tions dear to all true-hearted Scotchmen, nay, to every lover of 
pure religion and rational liberty. 

Both these facts are well ascertained. The evidence in respect 
to the latter, i. e. the birth of Rutherford, is not so circumstantial 
as could be wished; and one cannot help regretting that no local 
incidents have been preserved connected with the early days of that 
great and good man, who bore so conspicuous a part in the struggles 
maintained by our church against the assaults of regal and spirit- 
ual domination. Yet the claims of Nisbet to the honour of his 
birth-place rest on grounds amounting to highest probability 
Wodrow mentions, that « he was born of mean but honest parents 
m Tmotdale." The tradition of his birth at Nisbet was so gene- 
ral, that within these few years the house in which he was born 
was pointed out, or at least a house situated on the same spot • 
and Rutherford himself, in a letter, written in 1655, to the Rev 
John Scott, minister of Oxnam, a neighbouring parish, says, while 
regretting his being unable to pay a visit to that quarter, and speak- 
ing of the state of religion there, « My soul's desire is, that the 
wilderness, and that place to which I owe my first breathing, may

1600 although the date cannot be precisely determined. 

Of Calderwood's connection with this parish the information is 
more abundant. He was settled as minister in 1604. From his 
own history we find, that, in 1608, he, along with George John- 
ston, minister at Ancrum, declined the authority of Law, then

Bishop of Orkney, afterwards of Glasgow, as visitor to the pres- 
byteries of Merse and Tiviotdale. This resistance had nearly 
brought down on them signal punishment; but, by "earnest deal- 
ing of the Earl of Lothian and the Earl of Dunbar in favour of 
the said Mr David, their punishment resolved into a confinement 
within their own parishes." In the course of time, however, a 
relaxation of this sentence was obtained, although liberty was re- 
fused Calderwood to compear at presbyteries or synods, where his 
independent spirit and great influence rendered him a formidable 
opponent to Episcopal measures. But he seems eagerly to have 
watched over the liberties and purity of the church ; for in 1617 
we find him at Edinburgh, joining in a protestation against the as- 
sumption of a power on the part of the King to devise and con- 
clude matters relating to the external policy of the kirk, without 
special advice and determination of the General Assembty. The 
part he took in this matter proved the cause of his banishment. 
He was summoned to compear before the High Court of Com- 
missioners at St Andrew's, on the 8th July. King James, who 
had lately before this come to visit his native dominion, presided 
in person on this occasion, and questioned Calderwood as to his 
resistance and non-conformity. A particular account of the whole 
examination and answers has been handed down, and is interest- 
ing, inasmuch as it affords a true specimen of the difficulties with 
which the faithful Presbyterians had to struggle, and of the vehe- 
mence with which their spiritual liberty was assailed. The spirit 
of this venerable man sustained him to testify that he would yield 
" a passive but not an active obedience" to the King's commands, 
when he regarded them as infringing on the privileges of the 
church, i. e. that he would patiently suffer rather than comply. 
The result was, that the King became incensed, and Calderwood, 
after being detained in ward in the tolbooth of St Andrew's, was 
ordained to be banished from his Majesty's dominions. In conse- 
quence of this sentence he went to Holland, and there published 
his famous work Altare Damascenum, which is said to have caused 
inexpressible vexation to King James. On the death of James in 
1625 he returned to his native country ; but was not again con- 
nected with this parish. He was afterwards minister of Pencait- 
land, and his name appears in the proceedings of the celebrated 
Assembly at Glasgow of 1638. In 1651 he terminated his mortal 
career at Jedburgh, in the neighbourhood of the scene of his early 
labours. Of these labours, in so far as regards the discharge of

the great though unostentatious duties of a parish minister, no 
notices are preserved. Yet the excellence of his principles, and 
activity of his character, leave no room for doubt that " they fill 
an ample page in that book of the Divine remembrance, from which 
no work of faith, no labour of love, is obliterated." One indirect, 
yet strong proof of the estimation in which he seems to have been 
held among his people is furnished in the fact, that Lord Cran- 
stoun, the proprietor of Crailing, who, from the vicinity of his 
mansion, must have had the best opportunities of knowing his pri- 
vate worth and public usefulness, used the most strenuous exer- 
tions to procure the remission of his sentence, and the continuance 
of his labours amongst them. The son of this nobleman, in pre- 
sence of the Lords of Secret Council at Glasgow, 27th July, en- 
tered into an obligation of 500 merks for Calderwood's leaving the 
country before Michaelmas, and thus obtained his liberty in the 
interval. Lord Cranstoun himself accompanied his pastor to Car- 
lisle, and there presented to the King a petition in his favour, that 
he might be confined within his own parish. But this was not 
granted ; and, in like manner, other exertions which he made were 
frustrated, through the malignant interference of the bishops, par- 
ticularly through the underhand agency of Mr John Abernethie, 
" who," as Calderwood states it, " being minister at Jedburgh, a 
town in the south, and Bishop of Caithness, a diocese in the re- 
motest part of the north, thought he could not be at ease in Jed- 
burgh if Mr David was suffered to stay at home at Crailing,— a 
village distant but two miles from Jedburgh." 

Land-owners.— The Marquis of Lothian is sole proprietor of 
Nisbet side, which comprises more than one-half of the parish. 
The property lies most beautifully, stretching from west to east on 
the north bank of the Tiviot. The family residence, which is 
called Monteviot, f is at the western extremity. The old house 
is an extremely plain building, and affords but small accommoda- 
tion ; but one wing of a new and splendid mansion is already com- 
pleted. It is intended to consist of three parallelograms, the plan 
being of an irregular but picturesque character, in the Gothic style 
of the later period. 

wSr t0 b -  JUalifiL ' d b  Statin S' that  in consequence of the Tiviot 
having changed its course w.thin the last fifty years, one or two fields of the Crailing 
property are now on its north side. 

t This is the ancient Spinal, which was an hospital belonging to the abbey at 
Ancrutn. Near the site of this mansion there were distinct traces of a burying, 
ground, and a considerable number of tomb-stones were lately dug out. None of the 
inscriptions, however, contained any thing remarkable. 



182 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



The whole of the south side constituted the estate of Crailing, 
which was long in the possession of the Lords Cranstoun. The 
house and lands with the exception of one farm belonging to 
William Turnbull, Esq. of Fenwick, and about thirty acres of Lord 
Minto's, are now the property of John Paxton, Esq. of Crailing, 
by whose father the present mansion was built. It is a plain mo- 
dern building, and stands beautifully on a rising ground, with the 
Oxnam winding below. The interest and beauty of the pleasure- 
grounds are much increased by the course of this mountain stream. 
A sweet little glen, formed by its meanderings, and its banks 
thickly covered with wood, give a variety to the scene of which one 
has no idea till close upon it. 

Antiquities. — The parish contains nothing memorable in the 
way of antiquities, excepting the vestiges of two once strongly for- 
tified encampments at the top of Piniel-heugh. 

III. — Population. 
The population of this parish has varied but little for many 
years. In the former Statistical Report, the number of inhabit- 
ants is stated at 672. By last census, it amounted to 733, show- 
ing a trifling decrease from the census of 1821, which is easily ac- 
counted for, from the incidental circumstance of one of the large 
farms being at the time without a resident tenant. 

The number of families in the parish is - - - - ] 33 

chiefly employed in agriculture, - 71 

in trade, manufactures, or handicraft, 22 

Character, fyc. of the People. — The habits of the people are or- 
derly and industrious. The peasantry over the whole district are 
a peculiarly well-conducted class, — sober, intelligent, contented 
with their situation, and in general manage their limited means so 
as to enjoy the necessaries of life essential to their comfort. 

IV. — Industky. 

Agriculture. — Almost the whole land is arable, and a great part 
of it of the best quality. About 300 acres are planted. There are 
several plantations of considerable extent: and in the policies of Mon- 
teviot and Crailing House, there are many fine trees of great age. 
The soil is generally of a light loam, and is apt to suffer from 
drought, but in ordinary seasons yields very abundant crops. The 
mode of cultivation generally pursued is, to have one-fifth part of 
the ground under turnip crop, two-fifths in corn, and the remain- 
ing two in grass. The turnip crop answers all the purpose of fal- 



CRAILING.

lowing, and wheat or barley is sown after it. One-half of the tur- 
nips is generally led off to fatten cattle kept in the stall, and the 
other half eaten with sheep in the field. The farms are generally 
large, and let on leases of nineteen years. The tenantry are most 
respectable, — possessed of capital, — well-skilled in their profession, 
— and enterprising. The great obstacle with which they have to 
contend is the distance from lime and manure ; but such is their 
spirit, that great quantities of lime are regularly brought from 
the neighbourhood of Etal, a carriage of thirty miles. As a substi- 
tute for manure, bone dust has been introduced into pretty general 
use for the last four or five years, and by this means the bulk of 
turnip crop has been materially increased. Within the last twen- 
ty years, the lands on Nisbet side have been enclosed with hedge- 
rows of thorn. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of produce yearlv raised 
in the parish is as follows : 

540 acres in wheat, at L. 8 per acre, L. 4320 0 0 

• 370 acres in barley, at L. 6, 10s. per acre, - - 2405 0 0 

810 acres in oats, at L. 6 per r.cre, - - 4860 0 0 

850 acres in turnips and potatoes, at L. 4, 10s. per acre, 3825 0 0 

25 acres in pease, - - - - - 125 00 

1 90 acres in hay, at L. 5 per acre, - 950 0 0 

2420 acres of artificial grass in pasture, at 25s. per acre, - 3025 0 0 

910 acres in permanent pasture, - 600 0 0 

6115 acres. Total amount, L. 20110 0 0 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

There are three villages, or rather hamlets, in this parish, — . 
Crailing, Nisbet, and Upper Nisbet. The village of Crailing was 
at one time considerable, but within the last forty years has been 
diminishing, many of the houses having been taken down. There are 
no small feuars; all the houses belong to the proprietors of the land. 

Means of Communication. — The road from Hawick to Kelso, 
forming part of the great road from Carlisle to Berwick, passes 
through Crailing village. Its course through the parish for nearly 
two and a-half miles is agreeably shaded on either side by a row 
of forest trees, consisting of beech, ash, and elm intermingled. 
During the summer 1833, a great and much-wanted improvement 
has been effected by the construction of an elegant bridge across 
the Oxnam. Previous to this new erection, almost the whole pas- 
sage was through a ford, which was frequently unpleasant from the 
increase of the stream by rain, though seldom dangerous. There 
was, indeed, an old bridge ; but, in consequence of being conside- 
rably above the direct line, and of inconvenient access, it was little 



184 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



used, unless when the water at the ford was greatly swollen. Our 
means of communication are very abundant. The market-towns 
of Jedburgh and Kelso are close in the neighbourhood,— the for- 
mer at a distance of three and a-half miles, and the latter of six. 
And twice every week a stage-coach from Hawick to Kelso passes 
through the village. A post-gig passes and returns daily from 
Kelso to Jedburgh, by which all persons who choose to enter into 
an arrangement with the post-offices of these towns get their let- 
ters brought to them. We have, besides, a weekly carrier to and 
from Edinburgh. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is a very plain building in the 
exterior, but comfortable enough within.  It was built nearly 
eighty years ago, and is situated on the Crailing side of the parish, 
on a small eminence about a quarter of a mile north from the vil- 
lage. Forty new sittings have been added to it within these 
few years, and it may contain with ease 300 persons. Divine ser- 
vice is on the whole well attended. None of the parishioners are 
above three miles distant ; and the only inconvenience experienced 
is from the Tiviot intersecting the parish. This is somewhat 
remedied by the establishment of a ferry-boat, upheld by the 
heritors, in which a free passage is secured to church. On 
week days a penny is exacted as fare from each passenger. It 
happens, however, that at times the water comes down in so large 
a flood as to cover the haugh lands on Crailing-side, in which case 
it is quite impassable. The nearest bridge is that at Ormistoun, 
in Eckford parish, about two miles and a-half farther down. 

Nisbet being formerly a separate parish, had its church and 
burying-ground. Of the church scarce any trace remains, but the 
churchyard is still used as a place of interment by the inhabitants 
on that side of the river. For a long time after the union of the 
parishes it appears that divine service was performed in the church 
at Nisbet, — I suppose on alternate Sabbaths. The last notice to 
this effect, which I find in the parish registers, bears date 1713. 

This church, of which not a relic is now preserved, was centuries 
ago the scene of important debate among the ecclesiastics of that 
age. The tithes of Nisbet, as well as of Crailing, had been grant- 
ed by David I. to the canons of the monastery founded at Jedburgh. 
It seems that the monastery lay within the bounds of the diocese 

 There are still the ruins of the old church of Crailing ; it stood close to Crail- 
ing House. After the removal of the church to its present site, and the enclosure of 
a new burying-ground, many of the parishioners insisted on laying their dead where 
rested the dust of their fathers.

of Glasgow ; a circumstance which gave rise to questions between 
the Bishop and Abbot as to supremacy. — " At length, however, 
these altercations in respect to dignities, liberties, customs, rents, 
vicarages, lands, pastures, &amp;c, were brought to a quiet end in a. d. 
1220, by the arbitration of five discreet referees within the chapel 
of Nisbet before many auditors." 

There are no dissenting places of worship in this parish, but se- 
cession from the Established Church has existed for many years to 
a great extent in this district. It is not the province of a report 
like this to assign the causes. It may be but justice, however, to 
state, that I have hitherto seen among dissenters very little of 
bigotted attachment to their own sect, and scarce anything of hos- 
tility to the Establishment. The vicinity of Jedburgh, where there 
are three dissenting churches, — two of the United Secession, and 
one Relief, — affords ample opportunity for dissent; and here all the 
dissenters in this parish, with the exception of one or two families, 
find accommodation. In regard to the relative numbers of church- 
men and dissenters, it may be mentioned, that, out of twelve resi- 
dent tenants, exclusive of proprietors, eight with their families 
are members of the Established Church, and out of a total of 129 
families, 66 belong to the Establishment, and 63 to the Secession 
or Relief bodies. 

"We have no regularly constituted societies for religious purposes, 
but collections have been made in the church from time to time 
in aid of the propagation of the Gospel at home and abroad, and 
these have been liberal and encouraging; thus the average of 
those collections in furtherance of the General Assembly's scheme 
for diffusing the Gospel in India, gives L. 8 odds to each. 

The manse was built twenty years ago, is in good repair, and 
sufficiently large and commodious. Its present site is about the 
eighth of a mile farther north than where the old manse stood. The 
glebe lies chiefly in front, and the public road passes through part 
of it. The extent of glebe is about 9£ English acres, and the 
land is of excellent quality. The minister of this parish is titular 
of the vicarage tithes, and formerly drew in kind the teind of lambs, 
wool, hay, hemp, and lint. In 1818, this privilege was commuted 
by authority of the Court of Session into L. 60 of money, and 
the grain stipend settled at thirteen chalders, one-half oat-meal, 
the other half barley. The average of the last five years gives 
about L. 250 per annum. There is an allowance, besides, of L. 8, 
6s. 8d. for communion elements.

Education. — The parochial school is in the village of Crailing. 
The teacher, besides house and garden, has a salary of nearly 
L. 30, and L. 3, 15s. arising from a sum of money 1500 merks 
left at interest with magistrates of Jedburgh, by one of the Lords 
Cranstoun, and a Bailie George Cranstoun. He enjoys also the 
emoluments belonging to the offices of session and parish clerk. 
We have also a flourishing school at Nisbet, which is under the 
control and patronage of the Marquis of Lothian, and is support- 
ed at his Lordship's expense ; each of the tenants on the estate 
contributing also a certain proportion. The salary of the teacher, 
in addition to house and garden, is L. 20, and his other emolu- 
ments may amount to L. 20 or L. 30 more. At this school, be- 
sides the usual branches, the classics are frequently taught. The 
number of children receiving education at both schools throughout 
the year may be stated at between 70 and 80, and the school fees 
are as follows, 2s. 6d. per quarter for English reading; 3s. when 
writing is also learned, and 4s. when instructions are given both in 
arithmetic and writing. 

Library. — At Nisbet there is a limited but excellent collection 
of books, kindly furnished by the Marquis of Lothian, for the use 
of those residing on his property. The teacher acts as librarian, 
and the spirit of reading prevails particularly during the winter 
months. At Crailing also we have a division of Brown's Itinerat- 
ing Libraries, containing fifty volumes of useful and improving 
reading. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The poor are supported by an as- 
sessment. At this time there are 25 persons on the roll, and the 
aid granted to each may be stated at between L. 4 and L. 5 per 
annum. The church collections amount to nearly L. 12 per an- 
num, and are employed in giving occasional aid to the necessitous 
not on the poors'-roll, and in paying the school -fees of children 
whose parents are in difficult circumstances. It is expected that 
the voluntary contributions at church will be so increased as to 
reduce the rate of assessment, — the heritors having, by a late act, 
liberally placed the whole of these funds at the disposal of the 
kirk-session, and relieved them of the payment of church officers' 
salaries, viz. session-clerk, beadle, presbytery and synod clerk, 
— with which the revenues of kirk-sessions are generally burdened, 
and against which a prejudice prevails in some places so as to in- 
jure the collections. It must be acknowledged with regret, thai 
the feeling of independence and of reluctance to accept parochial

aid, which once distinguished the Scottish peasantry, is not mani- 
fested to any great degree in the border districts. 

Inns, Sfc. — Small as the parish is, I am sorry to state, we have 
two public-houses, both at the village of Crailing. These are cer- 
tainly not supported by the people in the parish, but by traffic on 
the high road ; yet their existence is productive of decided evil. 
The circumstance of two being found so near each other in a small 
village, arises from the trustees of the county through what may 
be pronounced a very ill-judged policy having granted license to 
the toll-bar. 

Fuel. — Dried turf was formerly much used for fuel ; but is now 
almost entirely laid aside. Coal is the staple article. It is brought 
from Northumberland, a distance of twenty-five miles. It is not 
so good, and used to be much dearer, than that found in Mid- 
Lothian ; but, from the great number of persons who occupy them- 
selves in driving, the price has considerably fallen, and has of late 
been about 13s. per ton : farther up the country it is higher. The 
peasantry have a sufficient quantity of coals brought to them in 
their masters' carts, — a circumstance which adds materially to their 
comfort. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

The state of the parish, as compared with that exhibited in last 
Statistical Report, indicates advancement. The rental was then 
L. 2500 ; it is now nearly tripled, being above L. 7000. The 
whole grounds are finely enclosed and drained ; and husbandry, 
which, forty years ago, was making rapid improvements, is now 
practised to a degree of perfection nowhere surpassed. 

The only thing wanted is increased facility of communication 
with the sea and the metropolis, which might easily be afforded 
by the construction of rail-roads ; but there is no great prospect 
of such an improvement being speedily effected. In a quiet inland 
country, it is difficult to stimulate to efforts requiring enterprise 
and involving hazard. Within the parish itself we stand greatly 
in need of a bridge across the Tiviot ; and we are not without the 
hope of seeing ere long realized, the advantages which such an 
erection would confer. 

• The minister has the right of casting turf,— a privilege which might once have 
been ot some value, but is now scarcely worth the expense attending it.

PRESBYTERY OF JEDBURGH, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. GEORGE RUTHERFORD, MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Boundaries, 8fc. — This parish appears to have formerly 
had the names of Howenham and Hounham. Its more recent or- 
thography is Hounam. The name applies to the village and to the 
parish; but its precise origin cannot now be ascertained. The 
syllable ham is understood to be from the Anglo-Saxon word, 
signifying a mansion or dwelling-place ; and it is believed that 
Howen, or Owen, is the name of some distinguished indivi- 
dual, who is reported to have lived in this quarter about the twelfth 
century. 

The parish forms an irregular figure of about 8 miles by 6 in 
its extreme length and breadth; and, as regards its superficial 
extent, is computed to contain about 22 square miles, or 14,458 
acres. It might have been nearly of a circular form, had not one 
point, of considerable extent, projected beyond the rest towards 
the north-east. It is surrounded by the parishes of Morebattle, 
Eckford, Jedburgh, and Oxnam in Scotland, and borders on the 
opposite side with the county of Northumberland, where the top 
of the Fells, a range of the Cheviot hills, is the march. 

Topographical Appearances. — The appearance of this parish 
exhibits, in general, little else than an assemblage of hills, chief- 
ly appropriated to pasture, and constituting a part of that ex- 
tensive range generally known by the appellation of Cheviot. The 
upper portion of the parish, towards the English border, is finely 
diversified in respect of surface, exhibiting a pleasing variety of 
waving elevations, and deep narrow dells, with intermediate romantic 
little valleys, that lie embosomed amid the hills. Numerous rivulets 
and brooks form a distinguishing feature in the scenery. There

are also black barren moors and uncultivated heaths, which afford 
shelter to a variety of game. The proportion of land fit for culti- 
vation in the parish is exceedingly small. It is in general so hilly, 
that, out of 14,458 acres, there are not above 583 under tillage. 
About one-tenth of the whole is either rocky, or consists of heath 
or of moor land, or peat moss cut for fuel or converted into meadow 
land. The hills, however, afford valuable and extensive pasturage, 
and abound with perennial springs of the purest water. 

Through the valleys formed by the rising grounds, the waters 
of Kale and Capehope take a serpentine course of several miles. 
Most of the low-lands in cultivation are on the banks of the Kale; 
and though there are some comparatively level tracts along it, well 
adapted for agricultural purposes, yet they generally rise, with an 
acclivity by no means gentle, till they terminate in heights. The 
vales formed along these water-courses are narrow ; that of Cape- 
hope is not only more confined, but less fertile, and more heathy. 
The arable lands are, however, sufficiently productive to repay 
any care or labour that may be bestowed upon them. In some 
other vales, still more confined and secluded, there is also a pro- 
portion of land in cultivation ; but these lands are better adapted 
for pasturage. 

The western part of the parish is generally more level, although 
there are several rising grounds interspersed, which descend by a 
gradual declivity towards the Kale. At the bottom of several of 
these rising grounds, there is a portion of arable and meadow land, 
of a sandy earth, or light sandy loam or gravel. 

There are few of the hills of an altitude deserving particular 
notice, though their general height above the sea is considerable, 
the loftiest hill, that of Hounam Law, situated at the north-east- 
ern extremity of the parish, and the highest on the border except 
Cheviot, which is 2856 feet of elevation, attaining, according to 
barometrical measurement, 1464 feet of elevation, the summit 
whereof is in latitude 55.30°, and longitude 2.24° west from Green- 
wich. It is of a conical shape, has a declivity north and west, and 
may be ascended all the way on horseback. At the base, it mea- 
sures about 9 miles in compass, and its superficial extent is 1730 
acres. This eminence, which, from its green flat summit, com- 
mands a very rich and extensive prospect over a wide tract of cul- 
tivated country, is said to have been in former times a noted sea- 
mark. 

The height of the lower hills has not yet been accurately ascer- 



190 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



tained ; but they are computed to vary from about 900 to between 
1200 and 1300 feet in height. The lowest point in the parish is 
on the Kale, at the north-eastern extremity, about 460 feet above 
sea level. 

The beds of Kale and Capehope waters are mostly formed of 
gravel and sand, with stones and fragments of rock similar to that 
of the adjoining hills, all considerably smoothed and rounded by 
attrition. The latter stream is a little more rapid in its course 
than the former, and flows with a velocity of one mile in twenty- 
six minutes. The beds of both streams afford the finest sharp 
sand for building. Excellent parish roads have been long open in 
the direction of these streams ; but the want of wood in. this tract 
and, indeed, the scantiness of plantation between this and the Eng- 
lish border, may have induced hasty travellers to reproach Scotland 
as a country destitute of trees. 

Meteorology. — The temperature of the atmosphere must be con- 
siderably influenced by the nakedness of the parish, and of the neigh- 
bourhood, which is generally destitute of growing wood. The ther- 
mometer ranges from about 28° in winter to 76° in summer on Fah- 
renheit's scale. The medium temperature of the year is 48.7° of 
Fahrenheit. The rains which prevail most are towards the end 
of August and the month of September. The heaviest rains are 
from the westward ; and storms of thunder, accompanied with tor- 
rents of rain from the south-west, are of not unfrequent occurrence, 
especially after a continuance of dry weather. Sometimes, also, 
in the spring months, there are frequent and heavy rains from the 
south-east. Our stormiest weather is generally from this quarter. 
Our steadiest and driest weather is from the north and north-west. 
The soil being either naturally dry, or drained where it was damp, 
the frequent recurrence of showers is beneficial, so that we are 
little afraid of a wet season. The average number of days in which 
rain falls throughout the year, is about sixty. The climate is some- 
what moist ; and this may be in some measure accounted for from 
the quantity of high grounds contained in and surrounding the pa- 
rish, which must attract any vapours that may arise and are driven 
in this direction. But the parish may be regarded on the whole as 
remarkably healthy. From the sudden changes of temperature, 
however, to which it is exposed, pulmonary complaints are not un- 
common ; and cases of chronic rheumatism, catarrh, quinsy, and 
others of the inflammatory kind, occasionally occur. Malig- 



HOUNAM.

iKint fevers rarely make their appearance. Of simple typhus, a 
case seldom occurs, and intermittent fevers have almost disappear- 
ed. The climate is exceedingly favourable to vegetation, pro- 
ducing a constant verdure, and the most luxuriant herbage on the 
plains and undulating hills. Both the climate and soil are suffi- 
ciently favourable to the production of most descriptions of grain. 
For barley, especially, it seems to be singularly well adapted. Po- 
tatoes and turnips are in general a good crop, and of excellent 
quality. 

Hydrography. — Many excellent perennial springs arise out of 
the gravelly soil, or from fissured rocks in the hills, and descend 
in small streams toward the plains, forming numerous rivulets. In 
the more elevated portions of the parish, there are a few periodical 
springs, which flow during the winter and spring months, and then 
cease to flow till the return of winter. Some of these springs are 
impregnated with a little iron. 

There is but one medicinal spring  deserving of notice. Its 
composition has never been subjected to chemical analysis, but its 
waters are said to be gently diuretic, and of some virtue in stomach 
complaints. 

The only stream connected with the parish worthy of particular 
notice is the Kalef water, which takes its rise from the northern 
declivity of the border hills, a little above-the Hindhopes, in Ox- 
nam parish ; whence it proceeds in a northerly direction, intersect- 
ing the parish in nearly equal halves. After a variety of beauti- 
ful windings, and a run of eight miles in a direct line, and of about 
seventeen counting its windings, this water unites at the village with 
that of Capehope. + In its course through the parish it receives 
other tributary streams ; but its breadth is small in comparison to 
its length,— varying from 27 to 45 feet. Its bed being of a gravel- 
ly nature, this stream frequently undermines its banks, changes its 
channel, and not unfrequently overflows its banks. Possessing a 
clean gravelly bottom, its waters are remarkably transparent. &amp; It

flows with a velocity of one mile in twenty-seven minutes. Alter 
a course of seventeen miles in a direct line, and about thirty-three 
counting the windings, this stream discharges its waters into the 
Tiviot, about a quarter of a mile below Eckford church. 

Falling over a rocky precipice of several feet in height a little 
to the westward from the village, the Kale forms a cascade, called 
" the Salmon Leap," and which, when the stream is flooded, be- 
comes an object of interest. An excellent road pursues nearly the 
whole line of this stream. Besides the Kale and Capehope wa- 
ters, we have a variety of streamlets, romantic in their scenery, and 
abounding in trout. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The parish appears to be composed 
principally of rocks of the porphyry formation. In these rocks, there 
occur cavities and veins more or less filled up with grey amethyst, 
rock-crystal, common quartz, calc-spar, heavy spar, agates of va- 
rious kinds, and also jaspers. The jaspers and the agates are fre- 
quently very beautiful. Hitherto no ores or native metals of any 
kind have been met with among the prevailing rocks, although rich 
mines of metals have been worked to a very considerable extent in 
other countries where porphyry rocks resembling those of this pa- 
rish prevail. 

The soil is various, but when cultivated generally productive. 
The low-lying land of the vales, and the holms on the banks of the 
different streams, consist of a light kindly soil, either of a sandy 
earth or light sandy loam, upon a gravelly bottom. In the haughs 
adjoining the Kale, the soil is alluvial, containing many rounded 
stones, with sand and gravel, intermixed with vegetable mould, and 
appears to have been formed by deposits washed down, in the course 
of ages, from the higher grounds. It is well adapted to potatoes, 
turnips, barley, and almost every Variety of crop, — though apt to 
suffer much in a severe drought. 

The soil on the higher grounds, though fertile, is of a less kind- 
ly quality, from its exposed situation. In general, it is sharp and 
dry upon the hills, inclining much to a sandy gravel, on a gravelly 
or rocky bottom ; or it has a subsoil either of a clayey retaining na- 
ture, or of indurated clay, or clay mixed with boulders of porphyry 
and gravel, or ferruginous clay or till. A blackish moory earth, with 
a wet and tilly substratum immediately under it, is here and there 
to be met with. On the high grounds, also, there are sometimes 
found mossy strata upon earthy gravel, having a substratum of a 
very retentive clay or till.

The subsoil in the low ground is generally gravel or sand, ap- 
parently resting on water. 

Peat abounds in the upper districts of the parish, where there 
are a number of peataria extending to some hundred acres. 

Zoology.— The parish has long been remarkable for its improved 
breed of sheep, which are all or nearly all Cheviots ; and only a 
few crosses of Cheviots and Leicester, on some of the farms in the 
lower districts. They are much esteemed for the delicacy of 
their mutton ; and the fleece is remarkably soft, and sometimes very 
fine. 

The only animals certainly existing in the parish in former times, 
and which have now disappeared are, Lutra vulgaris, Sciurus vulga- 
ris, and a species of deer which frequented the upper districts. Ursus 
meles, and Mustela putorius, have only disappeared from the parish 
at a comparatively recent period. M. vulgaris and Vipera com- 
munis are still to be met with. Vulpes vulgaris is no stranger here, 
and is destructive to lambs and poultry. 

The parish is not distinguished by many of the rarer species of birds. 
We may enumerate the following : Gallinula chloropus, Tetrao te- 
trix, T. Scoticus, Numenius arquata, Buteo nisus, Fringilla carduelis, 
F. linaria, Turdus merula, T. musicus, T. iorquatus, T. viscivo- 
rus, Sturnus vulgaris. Ardea cinerea, Anas boschas, and Larus ca- 
nus, are occasional visitants to the waters. Charadrius pluvialis 
and V nellus cristatus breed in the upper districts, but draw towards 
the coast, and spend the winter on the low lands that border the sea. 
Scolopaxrusticola and S. gallinago make their appearance in flocks' 
about the month of November, and remain with us for a few days 
on their way south. The latter breeds here, but not numerously. 
MotacillaRegulus, one of the Sylviada sometimes visit us in flocks. 
Alcedo ispida is also an occasional visitant to the waters. Black 
and red game, with partridges, are all abundant. 

Trouts of various sizes and of peculiar excellence are produced 
in the Kale, which has been long the resort of the fisher. Its 
tributary streams abound in trout of rather an inferior flavour. 
Leuciscus phoxinus, Gasterosteus aculeatus, Cobitis barbatula, An- 
guilla vulgaris, are all abundant. Petromyzon marinus is to be found 
on the sides of sandy banks. The only fish which now seems ex- 
tinct, and which used to be very plentiful, till of late years, is the 
parr. In the floods of October and November, great quantities of

salmon and sea-trout ascend the Kale for the purpose of spawning. 
Only a very few of the lesser migratory sort find their way up the 
stream at the season when they are at all valuable. 

Botany. — Besides the more common species of plants, there are 
to be found in this parish the following : — Euonymus Europcuus, a 
rare plant in Scotland, grows among the rocks in Shoreden-cleugh ; 
Asperula odorata, Hedera Helix, Hyacinthus non-scriptus, are to 
be met with in Chatto-cleugh ; Dianthus deltoides, Saxifraga gra- 
nulata, Sedum acre, in great abundance on the porphyry rocks ; 
S. villosum, Menyanihes trifoliata, Empetrum nigrum, Rubus clia- 
mcemorus, Vaccinium oxycoccos, on the heaths and mossy grounds ; 
V. myrtillus, V. Vitis-idcea, Lycopodium clavatum, L. alpinum, 
on the north and north-west declivity of Hounam-law, and else- 
where ; Digitalis purpurea, Solidago virgaurea, on the sandy 
grounds by the side of the waters ; Rubus fruticosus, on the glebe 
lands ; Anthoxanthum odoratum, abundant in our meadows. In 
other parts of the parish, we meet with Papaver Argemone, Cen- 
taurea scabiosa, Iris pseud-acorus, Trichonema Bulbocastanum, Ox- 
alisacetosella, Veronica beccabunga, Cistus Heliantliemum, Parnassia 
palustris, Trifolium striatum, Sedum Telephium, Thlaspi arvense, 
Tormentilla reptans, Cicuta virosa, Hippuris vulgaris, Leontodon 
palustre, Eriophorum vaginatum, Valeriana dioica, V. officinalis, 
Gnaphalium dioicum, Drosera vulgaris, Hydrocotyle vulgaris, Co- 
marum palustre, and various species of Orchis. 

The broom, the whin, fern or braken, rushes, and corn chamo- 
mile are all abundant. The cultivated crops of corn are barley, 
and the best varieties of common and early oats. The corn-cockle 
and wild mustard prevail to a considerable extent in some of the 
cultivated lands, and are pernicious to the growing crops. 

A considerable portion of the parish was at one period richly 
wooded; and the remains of a very extensive forest of hazels, 
Corylus avellana, having the appearance of great antiquity, are 
to be met with on Chatto-crags. On the low-lying lands of Kirk- 
row, are still a number of trees of great beauty, and of extreme luxu- 
riance both in foliage and ramification. Philogar used to be much 
admired for its woody banks ; but the greater part of the wood is 
now cutting down by the proprietor. Boughtrigand the two Granges 
also present a few clumps of trees. A number of full-grown elms 
and plane trees, of considerable age and size, surround the church 
and burying-ground, which are reported to have been planted by a 
former minister of the parish.

The trees planted by the Messrs Douglas on their property of 
Chester House have succeeded well, and are now arrived at con- 
siderable maturity. More recent plantations of various sorts of fo- 
rest trees and shrubbery have been executed on a considerable scale 
in the neighbourhood of, and around the Duke of Roxburghe's villa 
of Greenhill, which are in a thriving state ; and new and ornament- 
al plantations are rising on part of Mr Dickson's property, which 
will tend much to beautify the scenery around the village. The 
hedge-rows are usually interspersed with oak, ash, and elm. The 
soil seems congenial to ash, elm, beech, Scotch and larch fir, plane- 
trees, and various species of ornamental trees. Those that grow 
spontaneously are the hazel, the birch, the alder, the oak, and the 
mountain-ash. 

II. — Civil History. 
Historical Events.— Of the early history of this parish little or 
nothing is known. Situated on the frontier of Scotland, and bor- 
dering for a number of miles on England, the parish and neigh- 
bourhood, in former times, was undoubtedly a perpetual scene of 
border warfare. The sites of several ancient forts are still dis- 
cernible. 

Before the Reformation, the church was in the diocese of the 
Bishop of Glasgow, and was conferred on the Abbey of Jedburgh 
at the end of the twelfth century. MS. Adv. Lib. Hounam, sh. 
Roxburgh, alias Teviotdale Di. Glasgow, Pr. Jedburgh, &amp;c. 
When the Bishop of Glasgow and the Abbot settled their disputes 
in 1220, as noted by Chalmers, Cal. Vol. ii. p. 166, it was agreed 
that the whole tithes of corn within the parish of Hounam should 
be appropriated to the use of the canons ; the vicar receiving L. 10, 
or the altarages, in his option.  The lands of Kirkrow, Kirk- 
hope, and Steeple-side, are reported to have formed part of the pa- 
trimony and spirituality of this church, during the reign of the Ro- 
man Catholic religion. The Reformation restored the independence 
of the parish. The patronage of the church belonged for a consi- 
derable period to the lands of Kirkrow, but was lately sold separate 
from these lands, and is now held by Sir George Warrender. 

Land-owners.— The chief land-owner is the Duke of Roxburghe, 
a minor. His property, including the farms of Hounam-mains,' 
Main-side, Greenhill, Bearhope, West Grange, Weary Streams, 

 " Char t- Glasgow : In this particular settlement there was a reservation to the 
canons, which shews the practice of the age, that they should have in this parish an 
acre ot land, ad reponendum bladum suum in loco competent;"

and South Cote, embraces nearly a third of the whole parish, and 
rather more than a third of the whole valued rent of the parish. 
The property of Walter Dickson, Esq. including the farms of Ne- 
ther Chatto, Sharplaw, and Kirkrow, stands next in extent and 
value, and comprises nearly a fourth of the valued rent. Thomas 
Turnbull, Esq. is the only resident heritor, and his property of 
Howgate, which he holds in his own possession, amounts to about 
a sixtieth part of the whole valued rental of the parish. 

The remaining landed property in the parish is very much di- 
vided. The names of the other land-owners, taken in the order 
of their rentals, are as under, viz. William Oliver Rutherford, Esq. 
Bough trig ; William Scott Ker, Over Chatto ; Sir George War- 
render, West Side Over Whitton,' and Heatherlands ; Thomas 
Stavert, Philogar ; James Ainslie, East Side Over Whitton, and 
East Grange ; Robert Boyd, a minor, Capehope ; James, Alex- 
ander, and Pringle Home Douglas, Chester House. 

Parochial Registers. — The earliest date of our parish or sessional 
records, comprising entries of the proclamations of the banns of 
marriage, baptisms, discipline, division of poors' money, and the 
proceedings of the kirk-session, is 1690. The records from this 
date to the year 1728 are very imperfect. Since the latter period, 
they have been better attended to, and are in general pretty ac- 
curately kept. From 1772 to November 1775, there is an entire 
blank in the minutes of session. Since 1775, they have been kept 
with considerable care, and the entries are regular as far as relates 
to the minutes. No accurate account can be given of deaths and 
burials, from the imperfection of the registers ; and even the births 
and baptisms are not regularly recorded. 

Antiquities. — The traces of ancient camps and other remains 
of antiquity are discovered here in a variety of situations. The 
ancient Roman Rer, commonly called the " Street," and which can 
be traced to the south as far as Borough Bridge in Yorkshire, tra- 
verses this parish. After passing a hamlet, which is named from it 
Street-house, it crosses the Kale water near to Pennymuir. R 
afterwards proceeds to the Tweed by St Boswell's Green, whence 

 It may be worth mentioning, that there are belonging to the kirk-session three 
folio volumes, in a state of excellent preservation, of the Acts of Assembly, commen- 
cing 16th day of October 1690, with the following inscription in front of the title-page 
of volume first : " This and other two volumes of Acts of Assembly, comprehending 
all their acts to the year 1753, inclusive, are to belong to the session of Hounam. ... 
Delivered by James Carmichael to the session, at the death of Mr John Rogers, 
minister of Hounam, the Donor, this 15th August 1774."

it bends its course towards the Lothians. Vestiges of encamp- 
ments and semicircular entrenchments may still be traced on some 
of the rising grounds in the line of this old Roman way. The 
most conspicuous of these encampments is discovered on the sum- 
mit of Wooden-law. The largest and most complete camp is 
upon Hounam-law. There are also visible remains of some other 
smaller encampments on several of the lesser hills. 

There is nothing in the shape of a ruin worthy of notice in this 
parish, with the exception of a vaulted building, the only existing 
remains of the original structure, which, in all probability, was 
one of those fortresses or border keeps, erected by the border chief- 
tains for the defence of the country from the incursions of the Eng- 
lish borderers ; or it may indicate the site of one of the strong chain 
of fortifications erected by the Romans. It occupies a situation on 
a rising ground, which overlooks a beautiful bend of the water, at 
a short distance north from the village, and gives the name of Ches- 
ter House to the property on which it stands. It is bounded on the 
north by a deep narrow ravine. Tradition gives no account of it, 
but it was certainly built as a place of security in the days of vio- 
lence.— Another ruin, in some respects similar to the one above- 
mentioned, is to be seen at Heatherlands, towards the north-west 
extremity of the parish. 

On the farm of Hounam-mains, south-eastward from Hounam, 
are distinct traces of a very extensive fortification called, probably 
from its figure, the Rings. In this parish and neighbourhood, 
there are the remains of several cairns or barrows, the tombs of 
ancient warriors. Two eminences, called moats, exist in this parish. 
Situated on elevated ground to the eastward of, and at no great dis- 
tance from, the village, is a semicircle composed of a number of up- 
right stones. There is a tradition which bears that these stones were, 
at a remote period, human beings, who, for reaping on the Sabbath' 
were metamorphosed into so many stones. They are to this day cal- 
led the eleven shearers. There is every probability that they indi- 
cate the site of a Druidical circle or oratory. There are many single 
stones of large dimensions scattered over the parish, said to be of 
Druidical origin.f

Modern Buildings. — These are constructed of stone and lime, 
and covered with roof slate. The hewn work is of red freestone, from 
a quarry belonging to the Duke of Roxburghe, in the parish of 
Eckford. Hounam, the only village in the parish, occupies a 
pleasant situation on the eastern bank of the Kale, in the neigh- 
bourhood of the parish church, and at the base of a gently rising 
ground, which, gradually retiring, terminates in hills of consider- 
able height. It is a place of considerable antiquity, and is in the 
course of being considerably improved and enlarged. A very sub- 
stantial house for an inn, with stabling, and two other dwelling 
houses of two stories each, have been lately erected ; and some others 
have been projected. A range of houses, called, from the circum- 
stance of their having originally belonged to a tailor, Thimble-row, 
is so nearly adjoining to Hounam on the north, that a stranger would 
think it a continuance of the same village. This range of houses, to- 
gether with all the other buildings in the village, excepting the school 
and school-house, are feus upon the lands of Kirkrow, the property 
of Walter Dickson, Esq. Very commodious and substantial farm- 
buildings have lately been erected at a considerable expense, and 
on a liberal and well arranged plan, by this gentleman, and by the 
Duke of Roxburghe. Several new and substantial bridges have 
been erected within these few years. There is no other mansion- 
house in the parish, except that of Greenhill, a seat of the family 
of Roxburghe. It is deservedly admired for the amenity of its si- 
tuation. It is a favourite resort of the Duke, and much attention 
and expense have been bestowed upon it. The buildings are re- 
markably neat, and the surrounding grounds tastefully laid out. Its 
elevation is about 610 feet above the sea. 

III. — Population. 
The population appears to have been anciently much greater 
than it is at present. Whole families, besides single individuals, 
have, within these few years, emigrated to America. The farmers, 
paying more attention to their sheep walks than formerly, hard- 
ly allow a single house to stand on any part of their farm, excepting 
such as are necessary for their shepherd's accommodation ; and 
landlords themselves do not encourage the erection of more cot- 
tages than are absolutely necessary. The decrease of popula- 
tion previous to the year 1791 is attributed in the former Statisti- 
cal Report to " the mode of agriculture almost universally adopt- 
ed in the parish about that period, of converting the arable into 



HOUNAM. 



199 



pasture land." The decrease since that period, may be chiefly 
ascribed to non-residence, emigration, razing of cottar houses, the 
resorting of the poor and of operatives to towns, where they meet 
with more employment, and to the too general system adopted by 
landlords, of uniting a number of small farms into one,  and allow- 
ing a single individual tenant, not only to rent several of these farms 
in one parish, but to have a number of farms united in this manner 
in different parishes. Such a system is, indeed, as has been else- 
where expressed, " the bane of the comfort, happiness, and inde- 
pendence of the lower classes."

Character and Habits of the People. — If any of our people do fall 
into bad habits it is chiefly from the cheapness of whisky. The 
style of living and of dress has been much improved during the last 
thirty years ; and in no class more than among servants. Oatmeal 
porridge, used with milk, or with beer made from treacle, is the ordi- 
nary breakfast of the working classes, and of the younger branches of 
every family. Barley and pease-meal bannocks and potatoes are 
principal articles of food, which, with the produce of a small garden, 
and occasionally a little bacon or salted mutton, occupy a chief 

 One tenant at present rents no fewer than five different farms in the parish, all 
belonging to different landlords, and is non-resident. Another tenant rents a single 
farm, which used to give employment to seven tenants and their families.

place both at dinner and supper. Coffee and tea are daily becom- 
ing more general among all classes ; and few of our tenantry now 
breakfast without one or other of them, or dine without animal food. 
The people are generally intelligent, moral, and exemplary in their 
attendance on religious ordinances. The writer is sorry, however, 
to say, that poaching in game prevails to a considerable extent ; 
but chiefly by persons not resident in the parish. Daring bands 
of these modern freebooters from the English borders have lately 
traversed the hills, making great havoc among the game. The 
waters have recently been fished to great excess, and not by the 
most legitimate means of capture. The Kale and all its tributary 
streams are poached without interruption during the season of 
spawning. Smuggling in whisky holds out strong temptations to 
illicit traffic, and lawless gangs of smugglers from the English bor- 
ders have long infested this neighbourhood. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Economy. — The number of acres stand- 
ard imperial measure in the parish is 14,458, roads, fences, &amp;c. 
included. The real rent of land is about L. 5000 ; of which are 
paid from sheep, L. 3973, and from corn and cattle, L. 1 027. 

The sheep walks comprehend about - . 13 590 acres. 

Of these there are about of heath and of mossy pasture, from which the 

inhabitants are supplied with peat, - . \500

In all, 14458 

There are no lands in a. state of undivided common. 

Rent of Land, fyc. — The average rent of land per acre may be 
about 7s. The average yearly rent of grazing may be at the rate 
of about L. 5, 10s. for an ox or cow, if fed in winter with fodder. 
The year's grazing for full-grown hill-fed sheep may be from 6s. 
6d. to 7s. 

Rate of Wages, fyc. — Full-grown farm-servants maintained in the 
family are commonly hired by the half year. Men-servants, be- 
sides board, are paid from L. 5, 5s. to L. 6, 6s. for the summer, 
and from L. 4, 4s. to JL. 5, 5s. for the winter half year. Female 
servants receive from L. 4, 10s. to L. 5, 5s. for the summer, and 
from L. 1, 15s. to L. 2, 2s. for the winter half year, with board. 
Married men-servants, or hinds, besides being paid L. 3 of money, 

 The lands are seldom let at any certain amount per acre. The farmers calculate 
the value by the number of sheep the lands are known or supposed to keep.

receive 5 loads of oatmeal, 3 bolls of barley, 6 bushels of pease, 
from 1000 to 1200 yards of drill, lineal measure, for potatoes; 
4 caps of lint-seed sown ; 3 or 4 double cart-load of coals, by pay- 
ing the coal-hill price ; a cow kept ; a free house and garden, for 
which they furnish a female bondager for shearing in harvest, and 
other out-door work, who is paid by the tenant at the rate of lOd. 
per day in summer, and in winter somewhat less. A shepherd's 
wage consists of 2 cows, and from 40 to 45 sheep, to graze on the 
farm to which he belongs; — coals and potatoes as above described, 
and a free house and garden. The general rate of a day-labour- 
er's wage, without victuals, is, for men during summer, Is. 8d. 
per day, and for women Is. ; and during winter for men from Is. 4d. 
to Is. 6d., and for women 10d., sometimes less. In harvest, the 
wages rise to from 13s. to 14s. for men, and for women from 12s. 
to 13s. per week, with victuals. Doing work by the piece is very 
general ; such as mowing and ditching. Mowing costs from 2s. 6d. 
to 3s. the acre ; and the general rate of a mower's wage is about 
2s. 6d. per day without victuals. Masons and carpenters have each 
from 2s. 2d. to 2s. 6d. in summer, and about 2s. in winter, without 
victuals. A tailor has Is. 6d. a-day and his victuals. Blacksmiths, 
furnishing the necessary iron, are paid at the rate of L. 3 per an- 
num for each pair of horses kept upon the farm. This includes 
shoeing, and repairing plough irons and harrows ; and for every 
riding horse shoeing L. 1. 

Prices. — Coal carried and delivered here costs, per cwt., about 
8£d. ; peats, per cart load, 3s. ; average price of wool per stone of 
24 lbs. for the last three years, L. 1, 12s. ; artificial hay, from 7d. 
to 9d. Potatoes sell at the average rate of 5s. 6d. per boll of six 
imperial bushels. A pound weight of the best butter costs from 
7d. to 8d; cheese from 12s. to 14s. per stone of 24 lbs. ; average 
price of eggs about 4s. 2d. per hundred ; chickens from 7d. to 9d. 
each. 

Stock.— The common breed of cattle are the short-horned, to 
the improvement of which great attention has been paid. The 
number of cows kept in the parish is 65; young cattle, 110. 
The best sorts of the Cheviot breed of sheep, which are found to 
thrive remarkably in every part of the parish, constitute the stock 
on the hdl pasture ; while, on the lower and arable lands, it has 
been found of late to answer a good purpose to cross a part of the 
ewes with Leicester rams. The wool is thereby much improved 
both in weight and quality. The number of sheep kept through

the year is 13000, which produce about 1600 stones of wool, 24 lb. 
to the stone. The horses employed and bred here are almost 
all farm work-horses of a middle size, either of the English or of 
the Lanarkshire breed. The number of horses kept is 38 ; young 
horses bred yearly by the farmers, 13. Swine are reared by al- 
most every cottager and farm-servant who is married, but do not 
constitute a part of the farmer's stock, as an article for the mar- 
ket. The small breed is chiefly preferred, and the number bred 
and fattened yearly is 25. Poultry and bees yield a small profit. 

Husbandry. — At an early period, the farms in this parish were 
much more subdivided, and occupied by a number of small te- 
nants, who extended the cultivation on the hill grounds to some 
hundreds of acres more than is now even occasionally in tillage. 
The appearances of cultivation can still be traced on many of the 
hills, where no grain can now be produced ; and regular ridges and 
furrows are in many places very distinct. Since the middle of the 
last century, these farms have been converted into extensive sheep 
walks, occupied each by one tenant. The approved course of 
husbandry now pursued in the parish has nothing in it of a peculiar 
nature. The crops to which most attention is paid are barley, 
oats, and turnips. A crop of turnips is the most valuable that is 
raised. Barley alone can be considered as an article for the mar- 
ket. 

Some of the best grazing farms in the district are to be found 
in this parish. They vary in extent from 180 to 2900 acres. Leases 
are in some cases of seven, in others nineteen and twenty-one years' 
endurance. Generally, the new tenant enters at Whitsunday to the 
grass and green crop lands, while the old tenant has the white crop 
then upon the ground. By means of draining, burning of moors, 
liming, &amp;c. which are carried on to a considerable extent, the land 
has of late years been rendered doubly valuable. The Duke of 
Roxburghe and Walter Dickson, Esq. have judiciously spared no 
expense in erecting neat, commodious, and substantial farm stead- 
ings of stone and lime, with slate roofs, in place of the former old 
clay cottages ; and in other respects have given great encourage- 
ment to their tenants to carry on their operations with energy and 
spirit. Great improvements are observable in making and keeping 
in repair the parish roads. 

Produce. — The average amount and value of raw produce raised 
yearly in the parish may be as follows : —

Large quantities of butter and ewe milk cheese, of the very best 
qualities, have long been produced in this parish. Poultry and 
eggs are weekly collected by persons who make a trade of transport- 
ing such articles to the different market-towns. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Markets and Means of Communication. — The village of Hou- 
nam has no post-office ; but letters, newspapers, and parcels 
are regularly brought to it. The nearest market-town is Jed- 
burgh, which lies upon the west of, and is distant about nine 
miles from, the centre of the parish. A carrier goes and returns 
from Jedburgh weekly. Kelso, our post and principal market- 
town, lies upon the north of, and is distant about twelve miles from, 
the centre of the parish. With Kelso, we have regular communica- 
tion by carriers. The rate of carriage is Is. 4d. per cwt. — The pa- 
rish is intersected by upwards of thirteen miles of good parish roads, 
which are kept up from the statute-labour funds. These and the 
district roads are well supplied with substantial bridges, and are 
mostly in a tolerable state of repair. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church occupies a situation 
within the precincts of the glebe, and, like many other of our pa- 
rish churches, might be more centrical to the population, though 
it is not more than about four and a-half miles distant from the re- 
motest of the inhabitants, being about two and a-half miles from the 
north-east extremity of the parish, and between five and six miles 
from its south-west extremity. It is a very ancient building, and 
was originally in the form of a passion-cross, of great extent, and 
from end to end a burying-place ; but is now a plain rectangular 
house of 50 feet in length by 1 9 feet in breadth within the walls, 
10 feet having been taken off its length in 1752. This edifice is 
but indifferently seated, and in a state of bad repair, and so ex- 
ceedingly cold in winter as to prevent many a well-disposed person 

 Hence the old proverbial distich, 

" There's as gude cheese at Chatto as e'er was chew'd wi' chafts, 
There's as gude butter at Philogar as e'er was weigh 'd wi' weights."

from giving a regular attendance on the public duties of the Sab- 
bath. The want of a legal division of the church seats is also felt 
to be an evil, and the apportioning anew the seats would tend much 
to promote the comfort and convenience of the congregation. It 
affords accommodation for 225 persons, allowing 1£ feet to each; 
and the sittings are all free. 

The manse was built in 1776, but is placed too near the river, 
and consequently in a damp situation. It was never very sufficiently 
built. It underwent a repair in the year 1832, when an addition of 
two rooms was made to it, which have rendered it a tolerably con- 
venient house. The extent of the glebe, exclusive of garden ground, 
with policy attached to the manse, is about six and a-quarter acres 
arable, and two and a-half acres pasture, fences, &amp;c. which are in 
very bad repair, included. Its yearly value in rent may be about 
L. 11 Sterling, which is considerably below the average value of 
the other glebes in the presbytery. 

The stipend, from the Revolution to 1791, amounted to L. 75, 
5s. lOd. in money, including L.3, 6s. 8d. for communion elements, 
and 21 bolls of victual. In 1791 the victual stipend was augment- 
ed to 63 bolls, Tiviotdale measure. In ] 805, the victual stipend 
was fixed at 3 chalders meal, and 3 chalders, bear, Linlithgow mea- 
sure, together with the above L. 75, 5s. lOd. money stipend. By 
the last augmentation, commencing with crop and year 1820, the 
stipend, as then modified, amounts to 14 chalders, half barley, half 
oatmeal, Linlithgow measure, payable at the rate of the county fiars, 
and L. 8, 6s. 8d. is given for communion elements. On an average of 
the last seven years the stipend amounts to- L. 204, ls.2d. Sterling. 
It may also be stated, that there belongs to the minister a servitude 
for turf and peats from Mainside-fell. 

There are no chapels or dissenting meeting-houses of any kind 
here, though there are eleven families of dissenters connected with 
the United Secession, who attend public worship in the seceding 
meeting-house chapel at Morebattle. The parish church is, upon 
the whole, pretty well frequented and attended by the greater part of 
the inhabitants. A few families are divided among themselves, — part 
going to the church and part to the meeting-house. The sacrament 
is dispensed once in the year, and usually to about 47 communicants, 
not including strangers from other congregations who join in that 
ordinance. 

No societies for religious purposes exist in the parish. The 
average yearly amount of ordinary church collections for the last 



HOUNAM.

seven years is L. 1, 16s. 7d. Sterling. This includes the extra 
collections made at the celebration of the holy sacrament. 

Education. — There is in the parish only one established school, 
— the parochial. The yearly salary of the schoolmaster is the maxi- 
mum, viz. L.34, 4s. 4d. with legal accommodations. The emolu- 
ments of the schoolmaster as session-clerk are 15s., — as clerk to 
the heritors, L. 6 per annum. The children of paupers are 
taught gratis ; and the number of scholars attending the school 
is in winter about 27, and in summer about 17. The yearly 
amount of school fees received by the teacher does not much 
exceed L. 9. Children are commonly sent to school about six 
years of age, and there are none upwards of seven years who 
cannot read, and few above the age of ten or twelve that can- 
not write. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — There is no other provision for the 
poor in the parish but what arises from the weekly collections at 
the church, fees for proclamations, the use of the mortcloth, and 
the legal quarterly assessments laid on the landholders and their 
tenants, — the landholders paying one-half, and the tenant the other 
half, — which yield at an average about L. 38, 5s. per annum. In 
former times, the heritors used voluntarily to assess themselves to a 
certain amount over and above the legal assessment. The sum thus 
assessed for was called the surplus fund, and was appropriated by the 
kirk-session to the relief of incidental distress. This wholesome prac- 
tice, which operated powerfully in keeping paupers from the poors' 
roll, has of late years been discontinued. The average number of 
poor on the roll is 8 ; and the yearly sum allotted to each varies 
from L. 3 to L. 5. Some individuals who are incapable of doing 
anything for themselves receive as high as L. 6. Several persons 
not on the poors' roll get an occasional supply. A practice pre- 
vails in the parish of raising a small sum for the relief of a poor 
family by means of a charity ball, or some other amusement. Such 
is the feeling of independence on the part of the people generally 
that it is with considerable reluctance they are induced to apply 
for relief. 

Fairs. — Pennymuir Border Tryst is held twice every year on the 
Oxnam side of the south-west boundary of the parish, and close 
upon the old Roman road which divides the two parishes of Hou- 
nam and Oxnam. It takes place on the 31st day of July and 15th 
day of October, and is one of the principal marts for the sale of 
lambs and draft ewes in the south of Scotland. The customs of

ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



this fair belong to the Duke of Roxburghe. Capehope fair, which 
in former times was a market of considerable resort, has for a num- 
ber of years ceased to be held. 

Inns, Alehouses, S,-c. — There are two inns or public-houses in 
Hounam village, besides one on the Oxnam side of Pennymuir, on 
the very boundaries of this parish. One-half of the number in 
Hounam would be quite sufficient for the parish. 

Fuel — The nearest coal field to which there is access by a road is 
that of Etal, in the county of Northumberland, a distance of twenty 
miles from the centre of the parish. The fuel generally used by the 
poorer classes in the upper districts of the parish is peat, of which the 
high grounds afford an almost interminable supply. It is of tolerable 
quality, and the expense consists solely in cutting, winning, and 
leading home. The average labour and carriage may probably cost 
about Is. 6d. per cart load, when stacked up for use; or about L. 2 
per annum for each householder. The price of a cart load of coals 
is from 13s. to 14s. per ton of 20 cwt. including carriage. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
It is stated in the former Statistical Report, that no fewer than nine 
houses, with cottagers in them, at Mainside, all of whom the writer 
visited on his admission in the year 1775, were thrown down to 
make way for a single , farm-house and its appendages ; and that 
" the lands were formerly parcelled out into four times at least 
the present number of farms, and there was also much of these 
farms in tillage. So late as the year 1756, there were no fewer 
than seven tenants, with large families, on the farm of Hounam- 
Mains, now all rented by one tenant, who employs one shepherd. 
There were also several small, but proud lairds in the parish, 
whose lands are now lost in the large farms, and of whose man- 
sions there are now no remains." That report states the num- 
ber of inhabited houses to have been 66, and the number of 
corn-mills and kilns to have been 3 ; the number of houses at 
present is 49, and there is no corn-mill or kiln now in existence. 
A great part of the lands have changed owners ; and the number of 
landholders has increased since the publication of the last Statistical 
Account, from 8 to 10. The land rents have risen from L. 2720, 
to nearly L. 5000, and were a few years ago between L. 6000 and 
L. 7000 per annum. A large extent of stone fences has been erect- 
ed, and many of the farms have been better enclosed and subdivided 
with hedges and other fences. The management of the land is more 
judicious, and the mode of cultivation greatly improved, as evinced 



HOUNAM. 



207 



by the superior cleanness and condition of the land on most of the 
farms. Much of the surface water has been removed by draining, and 
the soil is in consequence improved. In the cultivation of the arable 
soils, the greatest improvement which has taken place is the intro- 
duction of the culture of turnips, a crop to which the soil is emi- 
nently adapted. The mode of husbandry having been altered and 
improved, prices of labour and raw produce of every description 
have undergone a proportional alteration. The breed of cows and 
cattle and other stock has been very much improved, and the sheep 
stock even more so. The writer is doubtful whether much im- 
provement can now be made on the general system of our husban- 
dry, — except only in subjecting the land to a less severe crop- 
ping, and in creating additional shelter by more extended planta- 
tion. Were the same taste and spirit displayed in this respect by the 
other land-holders as by the Duke of Roxburghe and Mr Dickson 
of Chatto, Hounam, from the nature of its surface and localities, 
the salubrity of the atmosphere, and beauty and variety of the scen- 
ery, might be one of the most attractive of our border parishes. 
A very superior coal, and not inferior in quality to any in Scot- 
land, might be had at a very moderate price from Reed water in 
the neighbourhood of Birdhopecrag ; but it is much to be regret- 
ted that the road leading from Pennymuir to the lime and coal- 
works there, so far as it extends through Oxnam parish, is but 
partially made. If this line of road were to be completed, and 
supported out of the general funds of the district to which it be- 
longs, which, in all probability it will be the case ere long, it would 
be of incalculable benefit not only to this parish, but to the dis- 
trict generally, as it would open an easy intercourse to the west- 
ward in Scotland, as well as into England.

PRESBYTERY OF JEDBURGH, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVJOTDALE. 

THE REV. JOHN EWEN, MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — In the more ancient records, the name of this parish is 
written Hopkirk, undoubtedly an abbreviation of Hope-kirk or 
hirk of the Hope. 

Extent, Figure, Boundaries, 8fc. — The parish extends in length 
from north to south, about 11 miles, and in breadth from east to 
west, about 3 miles, widening to something more at the top or south 
end, and contracting to little more than one mile at the northern 
extremity. Its figure is not unlike the naked impression of the left 
foot, the heel being turned to the north. The whole superficies 
may be estimated at 30 square miles.f On the south, it is bound- 
ed by Castleton parish ; on the west by Cavers and Kirkton ; on 
the north by Cavers and Bedrule ; on the east by Southdean, and 
a small part of Castleton. By the one or other of these two 
last-mentioned, it is separated about six miles from the English 
border. 

Topographical Appearances, 8fc. — The hills in the southern ex- 
tremity appear to be a continuation of the Carter or Cheviot range. 
The principal summits are Fanna and Windbrugh, which attain an 
elevation of about 1600. feet. At the opposite or northern extre- 
mity, Rubberslaw rears, to a height of 1420 feet, its dark rug- 
ged and heath-covered form, part of which only is in this parish, 
the remainder in Cavers and Kirkton. On the other side the Rule, 
and somewhat south, is the beautiful round-shouldered and grassy 
hill of Bonchester, rising to a height of about 1260 feet. The 
flat lands or haughs lie all within the valley through which the 
Rule flows from south to north, and are scarcely a quarter of a 

 A hope means a small valley or glen opening into a larger valley, generally at 
the confluence of a mountain rill with a larger stream.

to Hopekirk, whereas it was divided equally between Hopekirk and Southdean.

mile in breadth. On each side, the ground rises with a conside- 
rable acclivity, to the eastern and western borders of the parish. 

On approaching Hobkirk either from the east, west, or south, 
the temperature feels obviously augmented as we descend into the 
valley of the Rule ; but it must be confessed, that the borders of 
the parish in these directions are particularly exposed ; and this 
circumstance, doubtless, renders the change more perceptible, and 
more grateful to the traveller. Upon the mountain range to the 
south, clouds condense and precipitate themselves in copious rains. 
These sometimes fall so heavy as to resemble water-spouts. The 
inhabitants of this parish, as well as of the neighbouring town of 
Hawick, preserve the remembrance of a water-spout which broke 
upon Windbrugh, some seventy years ago, and unexpectedly swelled 
the streams of Rule and Slitterick to a tremendous height. In the 
traditions of the good town, this event is still celebrated under the 
appellation of Hawick flood, and several anecdotes connected with 
it may be found in Wilson's History of Hawick. An allusion to 
the same event occurs in Leyden's Scenes of Infancy, where, with 
poetic license, the poet ascribes the sudden inundation to the ven- 
geance of the affronted nymph of Windbrugh Lake. 

The climate is upon the whole damp, the heights swampy, and often 
overhung with moist fogs, vernacularly termed drows, or Liddes- 
dale drows. 

Hydrography. —In the upper part of the parish, there are 
numerous salubrious springs flowing from the greywacke formation ; 
in the lower parts, where the sandstone prevails, there are com- 
paratively fewer. Several marshes or bogs occur, but nothing 
which can properly be called a lake ; that which is so termed and 
is celebrated by Leyden, on the top of Windbrugh, is in reality a 
peat moss. There is but one stream of any consequence in 
the parish, viz. the Rule,— which, rising from the range of hills 
on the south, flows nearly due north throughout the whole length 
of the parish, and, about two miles beyond its northern extremity, 
falls into the river Teviot. Its whole course, therefore, must be 
about thirteen miles. Like all mountain torrents, its declivity 
is considerable, and its velocity proportionally great. From this 
circumstance, combined with the extensive drainage of the hills, 
its swellings and subsidings are extremely sudden. About a mile 
south from the church, the name is first applied to the union of 
three branches, which gather their waters from the alpine range 
above-mentioned. Two or three small burns join it farther down,

all originating within the parish. The south-western corner, how- 
ever, includes a small portion of Langburn, the principal feeder of 
the Slitterick, which flows northward, and joins the Teviot at 
Hawick, seven miles above the confluence of the Rule. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The parish may geologically be di- 
vided into two districts. The rocks, from the northern extremity 
to a mile and a half above the church, are mostly sandstone; thence, 
southward and westward, the greywacke predominates. On the 
south, occur likewise extensive masses of limestone, and red sand- 
stone of a different species from that above noticed. The lime- 
stone is found at Limekilnedge, south of Windbrugh, where it has 
long been burnt for use. Here also are symptoms of a coal forma- 
tion, which is not likely to prove beneficial. Windbrugh itself shows 
a gritty sandstone, more akin to the Northumberland formation. 
That in the north end of the parish has sometimes a red, and some- 
times a white colour ; and both kinds are employed for building. 
In fact, the upper strata generally consist of the white, which, ac- 
cordingly, crops out three miles before the red. Both kinds are 
extensively wrought for public use in the adjoining parish of Ca- 
vers, at Denholm-hill quarry. The dip of the sandstone is to the 
north or north-east. The greywacke has generally a westerly 
course, varying somewhat to the south, and stands nearly vertical, 
with a slight overhanging to the north. The limestone, suppos- 
ed to be mountain limestone, dips to the east like the Northum- 
berland rocks, and probably the sandstone found in this upper dis- 
trict maintains the same position. 

Besides the rocks above-mentioned, there appear on the top of 
Bonchester, Rubberslaw, and Windbrugh, caps of trap, greenstone, 
or probably a species of basalt, though not, unless in this latter 
site, assuming the basaltic form. A singular dike, varying from 
two to six yards wide, crosses the lower part of the parish from east 
to west, and continues its course through the greywacke as well 
as through the sandstone. Its material is greenstone, or some- 
thing analogous, with a considerable proportion of iron, which is 
oxidized whenever it lies in contact with the air or penetrable soil. 
This dike is clearly shown at Hallrule mill ; thence it extends in a 
westerly direction to Hawick, — making its appearance at the Glen, 
at Kirkton, Miller's Knowe, and other places on the line, where 
it is wrought for metalling the roads. It may also be traced east- 
wards across the Jed near Edgerston. Other troubles of lesser 



HOBKIRK. 



211 



note may be observed in the red sandstone, by which the strata are 
heaved up and otherwise deranged. 

At Robertslin, near Limekilnedge, occurs a stratum of agate or 
coarse jasper, which has frequently been employed for seals and 
other ornaments. Its prevailing colour is reddish, clouded and 
streaked with blue, crimson, and yellow, generally presenting but 
little transparency. Portions of fossil wood are found in the water- 
course, brought down from the hills ; but none have been discover- 
ed in situ. 

The soil over the sandstone is a reddish clay, among which are 
numerous large rounded stones, commonly blue, more rarely black, 
rolled from the greywacke and basaltic rocks. These, mixed with 
red sandstone, form the channel of the river. Moreover, there 
occur frequently smaller stones, of two or three pounds weight, of 
an oval shape, sometimes of a flesh colour, sometimes of a white 
quartzy look, such as occur in coarse conglomerate. Of this, in fact, 
a mass is exposed by the Catlie Burn near Wauchope garden, 
where the sandstone formation terminates. 

Zoology.— Judging from the names of places in the neighbour- 
hood, it would appear that the hart, the hind, the wolf, &amp;c. were 
formerly natives of this district. Thus, we have Hartshaugh, 
Hindlee, Wolflee, Swanshiel, Ernescleugh, &amp;c. Foxes still com- 
mit nightly depredations upon the poultry-yard, and otters have 
been discovered on the banks of the stream about Wells. There, 
also, among the lofty trees, herons build their nests ; and squirrels 
latterly have been seen in the woods. 

The Rule abounds with excellent trout, and is esteemed an ex. 
cellent stream for angling; but some dexterity is required, from its 
being shallow, and in many places fringed with alders. Few sal- 
mon or sea-trout visit its waters, and that never but in spawning 
season, when they are killed without any regard to prohibitory 
statutes. It is to be regretted that the small streams are so gene- 
rally swept with nets, which not only diminish the angler's legiti- 
mate sport, but destroy much of the salmon fry ere they reach the 



sea 



The sides of the valley are plentifully and beautifully wooded, 
—in a manner scarcely equalled in this part of the country. Birch, 
hazel, alder, and ash, are of natural growth. Oak, beech, elm, 
and the different kinds of fir, seem most congenial to the soil, and 
attain to a state of great perfection.

II. — Civil Historv. 

There is no event in our knowledge that deserves to be noticed 
under this head. The abbey of Jedburgh possessed lands in the 
parish ; and probably some facts in its history might be learned 
from monkish records. The remains of numerous fortifications 
testify that this, like other border districts, had been the scene of 
frequent conflicts. Queen Mary traversed this parish on her way 
from Jedburgh to Hermitage Castle, when, a little beyond its ex- 
tremity, she got entangled in the Queen's Mire. 

The Rev. Robert Riccalton, minister of the parish from 1725 
to 1769, was a man of considerable talent, an independent thinker, 
and an author of two volumes of essays and sermons. With him 
the poet Thomson spent part of his early life, and is said here to 
have formed the plan of his Seasons, and taken many of his descrip- 
tions from scenes in the neighbourhood. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners are, Sir W. F. Elliot, 
Bart, of Stobs and Wells ; Robert K. Elliot, Esq. of Harwood ; 
Walter Scott, Esq. of Wauchope; Hon. J. Sinclair of Green - 
river; and James Elliot, Esq. of Wolflee. Altogether there are 
but nine heritors in the parish. 

Antiquities. — On Bonchester Hill, there are remains of a citadel, 
with numerous encampments, both round and square ; and in some 
places, modern circumvallations may be observed intersecting the 
more ancient. The situation is commanding, and seems to have 
been regarded as a place of great strength and convenience. The 
estimation in which it was held by the Romans no doubt procured 
it the appellation Bonchester, i. e. Bona Castra, or the good camp. 
Hand mill-stones, arrow-heads, and other implements of former 
times, have been found in the vicinity. On Rubberslaw, at Wau- 
chope, and in several other places, there are likewise vestiges of 
encampments or fortifications. In digging, some time ago, at Lang- 
raw, a quantity of ashes and partly- consumed bones were exposed 
within a circular area about eighteen feet diameter. On these being 
removed, four holes drilled in the dent or sandstone shale were dis- 
covered, in which posts had been secured by small stones crammed 
in from above. Whether these posts had supported a canopy or 
a funeral pile, or what had been the purpose of the erection, we 
are unable to determine. Several urns have been dug up in 
different situations. Two cairns have been removed within the 
memory of the present generation ; one on the east side of Rub-

The enlargement of farms has been the principal cause of the 
late decrease of population, — conjoined with emigration to manur 
facturing towns, and even to foreign countries. 

There is no town, and nothing that can property be called a vil-

Poaching, especially the snaring of game, prevails to a conside- 
rable extent. Smuggling and illicit distilling are not now practised. 

IV. — Industry. 

The estimate hazarded above gives about 19,000 acres for the 
area of the parish ; of these, 3400 are in tillage or laid out in grass 
parks. There may be 860 acres in plantations, mostly in a 
very thriving condition. Those towards the upper part are suffi- 
ciently thinned and regularly tended ; those in the lower part 
are sadly neglected, though in many places excellent timber 
might be felled with great advantage to the remainder. We 
have already mentioned that firs, beeches, and oaks, succeed best 
in this soil. Admirable specimens of these may be seen at Wells, 
Weens, and Greenriver. More recently, ash, elm, birch, &amp;c. have 
been mingled ; but few of these have as yet attained great value. 

Rent, 8fc. — The average rent of land may be 15s., and none is 
let so high as L. 2 per acre. The average sum paid for grazing a 
three year-old ox or cow L. 6 ; a two-year old L. 4; a hill sheep 
5s. 6d., infield do. 12s.

ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



Rate of Wages, fyc— Labourers earn about Is. 9d. a day through- 
out the year ; artisans, 2s. or 2s. 3d. ; men-servants get about L. 10 
a year; women L. 4 or L. 4, 10s. during the summer, and L. 2 
in winter. A hind is. sometimes paid in the following manner : A 
free house worth probably L. 2 ; 10 bolls oats ; 2 do. barley ; 1 do. 
of pease ; 4 carts of coals ; 1000 yards of potatoes, a capful of lint- 
seed or a bushel of barley sown, — the master preparing and ma- 
nuring the ground. Bondage work is general in the district, that 
is to say, every cottage is bound to furnish the farmer with a field 
worker, paid at the rate of lOd. a-day. 

Lime costs 8s. 6d. a single cart load ; good stable-dung, 3s. 
Bone manure may be purchased, ten miles distant, at L. 1, Is. a 
quarter. Turnips 3d. a week per sheep. Hay 8d. a stone of 
22 lbs. 

Stock, fyc. — The common breed of sheep is the Cheviot, crossed 
more or less with the Leicester. One gentleman has for some 
years kept a few merinos. The cattle are mostly of the short-horn- 
ed breed. There may be 9500 sheep in the parish, 300 cattle, and 
about 80 horses. The annual quantity of wool sold may be gues- 
sed at 2000 stones of 24 lbs. each, which in price might average 
last year L. 1, 6s., counting the white L. 1, 10s., and the laid wool, 
L. 1, per stone. 

The duration of leases varies from nine to nineteen years ; but, 
of late, from the uncertainty of the times, short periods have ge- 
nerally been adopted. 

Husbandry. — Considerable attention has been paid to farming, 
both as regards the improvement of stock, and the melioration of 
the soil. There is no want of capital for profitable enterprise. 
Five out of the nine heritors farm all or great part of their estates. 
The system of husbandry is good, and calculated directly to enrich 
the country. Draining and liming have been executed with ma- 
nifest advantage. Much heath, too, has been reclaimed within 
these forty years. Perhaps more land has been brought under 
the plough than will yield a profitable return, unless it be after- 
wards laid down permanently in grass. 

The older farm -buildings are very indifferent ; the newer ones 
are good, and afford ample conveniences. 

Enclosures. — The enclosures are improving. Feal or turf dikes 
are now seldom employed. Stone walls and hedges are generally 
in use. The former are the most effectual ; but they are like- 



HOBKIRK. 



215 



wise the most expensive. A good five-feet wall may be erect- 
ed for 6s. to lis. per rood of eighteen feet, according to the 
distance from quarries. The building costs about 2s., the quarrying 
2s. or 3s., and the leading makes up the remainder. Two kinds 
of hedges are employed for enclosures. 1st, That of thorn, which 
is here apt to moss up and canker, from the dampness of the cli- 
mate. 2d, That of whin or furze, which has been lately introduced 
with apparently great advantage. It is at once cheaper than thorn, 
more easily reared, and sooner available as a fence. As this is a 
subject of importance to farmers, the following comparative view 
may be acceptable : — Thorn. Making ditch per rood, lOd. ; thorns 
at 10d., 64 to a rood, including transport, 8d. ; fencing with stake 
and rice, Is. Hd. ; total, 2s. 6d. This, in order to be a compe- 
tent hedge, will require six or seven years of incessant care, and 
at least one renewal of the protecting fence. — Whin. Making bed, 
3d.; ditch if required, 3d.; seed at Is. per lb. Id.; fencing Is. Old. ; 
total, Is. 7d. In four, or at most five years, this will be an effi- 
cient fence without any renewal of the temporary protection. 

The calculation of the stake and rice stands thus : Rice at Is. 
per cart, 3d. per rood ; stakes, eight to the rood, 6d. ; carting, 2d. , 
putting up, ld. ; total, Is. Od. Three bar pailing will run thus: 
Wood, say 2s. 5d. ; sawing, 4d. ; nails, eleven to the rood, at 
10d., Id.; labour, l-gd. ; carting, 2d. ; total, 3s. 2d. 

Pailing is certainly preferable on the score of cleanliness ; for a 
stake and rice fence harbours weeds. But this latter, besides being 
cheaper, turns to use an article, which would otherwise be in a 
great measure lost, viz. the thinnings of plantations. The seed of 
the whin is sown in April, and the plants, if kept from rotting by 
too much wetness, shoot away rapidly in the course of the season. 
The hedge being evergreen, presents a warm and beautiful appear- 
ance throughout the year ; but regular pruning or switching up is 
necessary in order to prevent decay in the heart, and seeding. From 
this latter source, indeed, is anticipated the greatest objection to 
this kind of fence ; for unless carefully watched, the furze will soon 
usurp the whole field. 

Produce. — The following may be regarded as an approach to 
the value of raw produce yearly raised in the parish : 

Of the 3400'aeres under tillage, there may be 1500 in grain, f 0 ats, 

I wheat, barley, &amp;c. at say L. 3, 10s. per acre, .. - L. 5250 0 0

The valued rent of the parish is L. 4152 ; the actual rent in 1821 
was L. 7095. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Hawick and Jedburgh, at the distance of eight miles, are the 
nearest market-towns. The latter has been usually reckoned the 
post-town ; but a post-office in connection with Hawick has just 
been established at Bonchester Bridge. This will afford great 
accommodation to the inhabitants, and gain a day or two upon 
the transmission of replies to letters from London and Edinburgh. 

The turnpike road from Hawick to Newcastle crosses the parish, 
from east to west, for about three miles and a-half, and that from 
Jedburgh to Castleton, north and south, for about ten miles. There 
are, besides, several statute-labour, roads kept in tolerable repair. 
Altogether, their length may be upwards of twenty miles. Across 
the Rule are three stone-bridges, besides wooden ones, and others 
across burns or small torrents, in various directions. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is, very centrically placed, 
though at a considerable distance from the extremities of the parish. 
It was built towards the beginning of last century, and since 1777 has 
undergone no repairs of any consequence. Its present condition 
is far from comfortable. The earthen floor is two steps below the 
level of the churchyard. The roof is nevertheless so low, that in 
the galleries there is not room at the sides to stand upright. The 
seating is in bad repair. The whole is dark, damp, and dirty. The 
interior, if properly laid out, might contain 400 sitters. 

The manse was built seventy years ago, and has just undergone 
some inadequate repairs. The extent of the glebe around the 
manse may be 15 acres; and half of Abbotrule glebe 24 acres: 
value of the whole about L. 40. The stipend modified in victual 
is 15 chalders, one-half meal, and one-half barley. 

There are 28 families in the parish attending the chapels of 
dissenters or Seceders. 

Education. — The parochial school is situated by the churchyard 
wall, and is well attended, though its distance from the extremities 
of the parish is too great for young children. The number of scho- 
lars may average 60 throughout the year. They are taught read- 
ing, writing, and arithmetic. The master's salary is L. 31, 10s. per 
annum, including an equivalent for a garden : his fees may amount 



HOUKIHK. 



217 



to L. 22 per annum. A juvenile school is taught by a mistress in 
the lower part of the parish. The benefits of education are duly 
appreciated and universally acquired. 

Library. — A subscription library has just been commenced, and 
is likely to be of considerable advantage. 

Savings-Bank. — There is no Savings bank in the parish ; but 
lodgments are made, chiefly by servants, in that of Jedburgh or of 
Hawick. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of paupers de- 
riving aid from parochial assessment is 20, at the rate of L. 4 each per 
annum. A few receive temporary assistance from the session fund. 
It is gratifying to remark, that the genuine Scottish independence 
is not quite gone in this district ; several individuals in real need, 
have manifested great reluctance to accept any parish relief. The 
total amount of assessment is about L. 80 per annum; and of church 
collections about L. 12. There is a benefaction of L. 100 left by 
Lady Yester, the interest of which is annually divided between the 
heritors and the schoolmaster. 

Inns. — There is but one inn or public-house within the parish, viz. 
at JBonchester Bridge on the Newcastle road. The effects of such 
establishments on the morals of the people are never good; yet there 
is less drunkenness now than once prevailed. The practice of giv- 
ing licence to the keepers of the toll-gates, stubbornly maintained 
by road trustees, is much to be deprecated. If refreshment be ne- 
cessary, the license might at least be restricted to ale, and thus 
probably one-half of the evil would be removed. 

Fuel. — Peat, turf, and wood, are burnt in the cottars' houses, but 
the fuel principally used is coal, which is brought from Northum- 
berland, a distance of about twenty miles. It may be purchased at 
9d. or lOd. a cwt. Coals could be procured both nearer and bet- 
ter at Tynehead, if the Duke of Northumberland would allow a 
road to be made in that quarter. There, a level and easy com- 
munication across the border might be obtained at no great ex- 
pense ; and it is much to be lamented that His Grace should deny 
the neighbourhood so great a benefit, merely through a dislike to 
break up the privacy of Keildar Castle. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The parish, within these last forty years, has been vastly improv- 
ed in its general aspect ; and here an acknowledgment is due to 
the late Mr Wilson of Hallrule, and especially to Mr Elliot of 
Wolflee. Much waste land has been reclaimed and brought into 



218 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



a proper state of cultivation. The quantity under tillage has been 
more than doubled. Many plantations have been formed, and pre- 
sent a thriving appearance. The value of the district generally 
has been immensely increased. There is, however, still room in 
the western or south-western skirts of the parish for additional plan- 
tations to beautify and improve the ground. 

The following improvements in husbandry may be submitted as 
occurring in this parish. 

1. Deep Ploughing. — This has of late been introduced with very 
beneficial results. In certain soils, particularly in lands reclaimed 
from moor, there exists, not much below the surface, a stiff, dense 
and sterile clay, which denies all passage to moisture, as well as to 
the roots of plants. This stratum, commonly denominated muir- 
band, in some places only a few inches thick, may be readily 
pierced and broken, by using a plough without mould-boards, fol- 
lowing in the furrow made by a common plough. This, drawn by 
three horses, or better still by oxen, will penetrate to a depth of 
sixteen or eighteen inches, and even raise stones of a considerable 
weight. The advantage of this procedure is, that the disturbed stra- 
tum will either deepen the soil generally, or act as a drain for super- 
fluous moisture in wet lands ; while in dry lands, it will serve as a re- 
servoir to the plants when the superincumbent moisture is ex- 
hausted. 

2. Selection of Grasses for cultivation. — Very seldom is any other 
kind than rye-grass with red and white clover sown. Yet it is al- 
lowed, that these are not equally adapted to every soil, whether wet 
or dry, rich or poor, moor or loam. It is to be regretted that far- 
mers who have some knowledge of botany have not directed their 
attention to this most legitimate and beneficial purpose. The fit- 
ting soils for wheat, for barley, and for oats, have been long ascer- 
tained, and why might not experience be as successfully employed 
to discover the most congenial kinds of grasses and clovers  Ita- 
lian rve-grass has been lately introduced into Galloway with much 
promise of advantage. It might be tried on the banks of the Rule. 

3. Top-Dressing of Grass Lands. — The improvement of pastu- 
rage is of vital importance ; and in general grass thrives well in this 
district. Its growth might be farther promoted by applying com- 
post or short dung to the surface. Such a practice, with sufficient 
draining, will be found to yield a profitable return. It is the fault 
of the damp climate more than the soil, when the grain crops fail ; 



IIOBKIRK. 



219 



and as that will not affect lands in grass, the return from them is 
always certain. 

It might, be farther noticed, that the disease called Jinger-and- 
toes is occasionally very hurtful to the turnip crop. Lime has 
been regarded as the most successful remedy, and bone manure 
has been thought favourable. Amongst live-stock, the loup- 
ing-ill is a severe scourge, the loss by it ranging from five to ten, 
and even twenty per cent. This disease, as yet little understood, 
is attended with curious and very peculiar circumstances. It is 
attached to particular soils, most commonly to those where the 
greywacke predominates; and it may be remarked, that stock 
brought from a distance is more liable to it than what has been 
reared on the ground. It usually makes its appearance towards 
the middle of April, with the withering east winds of that period, 
and leaves the flock, with the exception of a few irregular cases, 
about the middle of June. It attacks sheep, cattle, and swine. 
It resembles paralysis affecting the limbs, sometimes the head or 
neck, and occasionally the back. Wherever it occurs, the ver- 
min called ticks are found to accompany it. Severe bleeding at an 
early stage of the disease has been practised with advantage ; but 
no infallible mode of treatment has been discovered for its cure. 
By plentifully liming the soil, it has been eradicated from certain 
farms. Burning would probably have the like effect, as it is pre- 
sumable the disease may be occasioned by the puncture of the in- 
sects, with which it is always attended. These, it is well known, 
are bred in the earth, and get upon the sheep either by their legs 
or by their muzzle when feeding. Hence the parts usually affect- 
ed are the limbs or the neck. This interesting subject is well 
worth the serious attention of farmers. 

As a general improvement, perhaps, the opening of a road into 
Tynehead would be the greatest of which the parish is susceptible. 
By this means, abundance of coal might be procured at a cheap 
rate for the poor, and likewise for burning the limestone, which 
might be more extensively wrought at Limekilnedge and in Castle- 
ton. It would likewise furnish an ample and less expensive supply 
for the manufacturing town of Hawick and the neighbouring dis- 
tricts. The attention of proprietors and tenants has been more 
than once directed to this object ; and it is deeply to be regretted, 
that neither the prospect of an increased revenue, nor the desire of 
conferring a great public boon on the west of Roxburghshire, in- 
duces the Duke of Northumberland to countenance the scheme

PRESBYTERY OF JEDBURGH, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TI VIOTDALE. 

THE REV. JOSEPH YAIR, A. M. MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name of this parish is compounded of aec, an oak, 
and ford, a passage over a river, — referring to the oaks which an- 
ciently prevailed in the district, and to a ford in the Teviot, with- 
in a short distance of the village, which bears the name of the 
parish.  It is probable that to this village the appellation Eck- 
ford was primarily confined; but that in process of time it came to 
be applied to the whole parish. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish is nearly of a triangular 
form, with its base towards the east : and is about 6 miles at its 
greatest length, and 4 at its greatest breadth. It is bounded, on 
the north, by Roxburgh and projecting portions of Kelso and 
Sprouston ; on the east by Linton, Morebattle, and Hounam ; on 
the south, by Jedburgh ; and on the west, by Crailing. 

Topographical Appearances. — This parish presents throughout 
an undulating appearance, gradually rising as it extends towards 
the south, and occasionally swelling into elevations, which com- 
mand an extensive view of the circumjacent country. There are 
no remarkable heights in the parish, but the chief eminences are 
Woodenhill and Cavertonhill. From Woodenhill, the spectator 
looking towards the west, may survey, for the space of many miles, 
the vale of the Teviot, with the tortuous course of that classic 
stream, — the neatly enclosed and highly fertile fields which stretch 
along its banks — the well kept and thriving plantations which here 
and there extend to the river's edge, and which, together with Peniel- 
heugh, Minto-hill, Minto-crag, and Ruberslaw in the distance, 

 This ford was anciently called the ford at the aces. In the bed ofthe river near 
the ford, oaks of considerable dimensions have occasionally been seen. Within 
these thirty years, a tree of this kind, about 2£ feet in diameter, was dragged 
out by Mr Mather of Kalemouth, and immediately on its removal he perceived 
another lying directly under it. About three miles farther up the river, in a deep pool, 
an oak is said to have been seen, so very large that its trunk in some places amount- 
ed to about 4 feet 4 inches in diameter.

form a landscape peculiarly picturesque and delightful. But not 
less striking is the valley of the Kale, which embraces a narrower 
track of country, and which, from various points of the parish, may 
be viewed to great advantage. This valley is interesting in a high 
degree, and more especially where it begins to open up in the di- 
rection of Marlefield on the west, and Linton on the.east. Whether 
from the historical associations with which it is invested, or from 
the natural character of the scenery, or the beautiful range of hills 
which form its back ground on the south and east, it cannot be 
contemplated by the intelligent observer but with delight. 

Climate. — The atmosphere here is for the most part mild and 
salubrious. The winds which chiefly prevail are from the west, 
but gales in severe storms, in general, blow from the south-east. 
Ague, once an epidemic in the district, is now quite unknown. 
Its disappearance may be traced to the improved system of drain- 
age, which is now so successfully pursued in this quarter, and to the 
consequent diminution of those noxious exhalations which were 
wont occasionally to issue from the lower grounds. 

Hydrography. — There are two rivers which flow through this 
parish, the Teviot and the Kale : the Teviot takes its rise among 
the heights which separate Dumfries-shire from Roxburghshire, 
and after running in a north-easterly direction about thirty-nine 
miles, in the course of which it is augmented by a vast number of 
tributary streams, it disembogues itself into the Tweed near Kelso. 
This river, immediately on entering the parish, proceeds in a north- 
erly direction, and leaves the ancient Barony of Ormiston, consist- 
ing of 680 acres, on its northern extremity. The Kale issues from 
among the Cheviots in the county of Northumberland, and, after 
a rapid course of eighteen miles, it discharges its waters into the Teviot 
somewhat to the north of Eckford church. This is a much smal- 
ler stream than the Teviot, but more impetuous in its current. It 
runs through the parish in a north-westerly direction, and divides 
it nearly into two equal parts. In some places, its banks are bold 
and romantic in a high degree, and beautifully overhung with wood. 
Both these rivers are occasionally subject to sudden inundations, 
which, by breaking down embankments occasion considerable detri- 
ment.— There is one small lake in the parish, measuring about 13 
acres in extent. It lies at the bottom of Woodenhill, a little to the 
south of the village of Eckford moss, and forms the bed of a marl- 
pit, which was once wrought in the district. It is in some places 



222 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



about 30 feet in depth, and when seen at a distance constitutes ;i 
beautiful object. 

Geology. — The rocks that predominate in the parish are of the 
sandstone and trap formation : the former occupies the lower, and 
the latter the higher parts of the district. Of these rocks there 
are several quarries, some of them of excellent quality. Many 
years ago, a small seam of coal was discovered at Caverton edge, in 
this parish ; but the investigation was not carried far enough to 
be followed up with any beneficial result. Both peat and marl 
once existed in the district, — the one mostly incumbent on the 
other ; and imbedded in these, animal and vegetable remains have 
been found. " In wester moss, nuts, roots, pieces of large oak and 
other trees have been dug up, also the scull of a bison, and the 
horns of a red-deer very large." These horns, which at present are 
in the possession of Mr Robert Church, farmer, Moss-tower, have 
seven branches, and are supposed to be in weight about two stones. 
At what distance from the surface these remains were discovered, 
it is impossible now to determine. 

Soil. — The soil in the parish is various : that on the lower grounds 
towards the Teviot is a light mould, while that on the higher grounds 
towards the south partakes more of a clayey character. On the 
same farm, however, there is often a great variety of soil ; but the 
crops which it yields are for the most part rich and abundant. 

Zoology. — This parish presents to the zoologist no rare species 
of animals. In the rivers, salmon and trout are in great abundance, 
and of excellent quality. The trout of the Kale is peculiarly deli- 
cious in its flavour. Hares, rabbits, partridges, and pheasants 
abound in the district, and on Ceesford moor the heathcock is oc- 
casionally seen. The starling, that most tractable of birds, visits 
the parish yearly, and often nestles among the rocky cliffs that 
overhang the Kale. Within these few years, a cuckow was disco- 
vered in this place, in the nest of a small bird. With great care it 
was fed for some weeks on small pieces of flesh, and on these it 
seemed to thrive well. It was extremely voracious, and, so far 
from being discontented with its situation, always appeared quite 
at home. 

Botany. — The parish presents, upon the whole, a wooded appear- 
ance. Almost all kinds of forest trees flourish here, and appear to 
be quite congenial to the soil. The most common species, however, 

is the fir tribe, of which there is a forest consisting of 360 acres 

3

on Caverton edge, where the Kelso races were formerly held.  
There are three aged yew trees in the churchyard, but at what 
time they were planted it is difficult to say. Close to the ancient 
mansion-house of Hall of Haughhead, stands a stately ash tree, un- 
der whose shade the children of that noted individual are reported 
by tradition to have been baptized. 

II. — Civil History. 
Historical Notices. — This parish, the southern extremity of which 
lies within a few miles of the borders, was the scene of frequent 
rapine and devastation in former times. The village of Eckford, 
which was once a place of considerable note, was burnt by the En- 
glish under the Marquis of Dorset in April 1553, along with 
many other places in the district. Within the bounds of this 
parish, there were of old several strengths or strongholds, such as 
Ormiston-tower, Eckford-tower, Wooden-tower, and Moss-tower; 
but of these the last mentioned was by far the most important. 
This was situated about the eighth part of a mile to the north-east 
of the village of Eckford, and within a few yards of the present 
farm-house, which now bears its name. It was so called, from a 
piece of marshy ground in its immediate vicinity, and is reported 
to have been once a residence of Hepburn Earl of Bothwell.f In 
an ancient chronicle, it is represented as surrounded by a marsh, 
and as accessible only at one point by a causeway. This the far- 
mer at present is in the act of removing from its ancient site. On 
the 30th of June 1523, it was destroyed by a party of English 
headed by Thomas Lord Dacre ; and on the same day were de- 
molished Ormiston-tower, and a vast number of other places in the 
neighbourhood. On the 6th September 1544, it was burnt along 
with the tower and church + of Eckford, by an army under Sir Ralph 
Eure, and forty-four persons, who were found in it, fell victims to

the fury of the assailants. Shortly after this, it appears to have been 
rebuilt ; but it was again destroyed in 1570, by the Earl of Sussex, 
who, in the course of a few days, laid waste in this quarter a very 
extensive tract of country. Within these fifty years, the massive ruins 
of this ancient structure were unceremoniously pulled down, and that 
with a view of affording an easy access to materials for rearing the 
farm-offices which now stand near its site. The lands of Moss- 
tower anciently belonged to the Laird of Buccleuch, so celebrated 
in Border history, and is now the property of his descendant, His 
Grace the Duke of Buccleuch. 

But the mostfamous fortress in this parish was Cessford Castle, 
which stands on its southern extremity, and which was the ancient 
manorial residence of Sir Robert Ker, commonly known by the 
name of Hobbie Ker, warden of the Scottish middle marches, from 
whom the Dukes of Roxburghe are descended, f This is, at pre- 
sent, a mere ruin ; but from what remains of it, some conjecture may 
be formed of its pristine greatness. The main building is about 67 
feet long, 60 feet broad, and 65 feet high, and the walls in 
point of thickness amount at an average to about 13 feet broad. 
The dungeon, which is situated nearly in the centre of the for- 
tress, is still open to inspection : it consists of a damp gloomy 
apartment 20 feet in length, 10 in breadth, and 13 in height, with 
a slanting air-hole looking toward the east. At the west end of 
this apartment, is a subterraneous vault, which was anciently known 
by the name of the dungeon peel, and which was probably chiefly 

" Here towards the close of the sixteenth century, one of the Judges of the Court of 
Session, is reported hy tradition to have heen for a time confined. While riding m 
the vicinity of Edinburgh, he was seized by a moss-trooper, who, wrapping a cloak 
around him, mounted him on his steed, and carried him off to this fortress. Here 
he was detained till a law-suit, which was then pending before the Supreme Court, 
and in reference to which he was held to entertain opinions hostile to one of the par- 
ties was decided. After this, he was conveyed, after a like fashion, to the spot 
whe'rehehad been taken up; and being set at liberty, he shortly after appeared 
to their great surprise and joy, in the midst of his family, who had long since con- 
ceived he had been assassinated. Some time thereafter, being' on a visit at Cessford 
Castle, he was startled at hearing, in the act of calling for his dog, the well known 
voice of a shepherd, which had sounded every morning in his ear during the time of 
his imprisonment, and which convinced him that this was actually the very spot of 
it Upon subsequent investigation he found that his opinion was correct. 

'+ Andrew Ker of Attonburn, in 1446, was probably the first of the noble family 
of Ker. who occupied this castle. In that year he obtained, as is mentioned by the 
writer of the last Account, a charter of the barony of Cessford, from Archibald Earl 
Dousrlas who was afterwards known by the name of Duke of Turenne or Longui- 
ville The most illustrious of his descendants, appears to have been the above-men- 
tinned Sir Robert Ker, who was born 1570, and who is here still spoken of as one 
of the most powerful men of his times. In 1 606, he was raised to the Peerage by 
thP title of Lord Roxburghe, and in 1616 he was elevated to the rank of Earl of Rox- 
Ker J Cessford, and Cavcrton. He died 1650. His descendant, 
John the third Earl of Roxburghe, was created a Duke in 1707.

intended either as a reservoir for water, or as a depository for goods. 
Some have averred that it was occasionally employed as a prison, 
and perhaps this averment is founded on fact. There is an air-hole on 
the south side of it, but it is so constructed that not a ray of light can 
possibly be admitted. This vault measures about 10 feet long, 17 
feet broad, and 9 feet deep. The only entrance to it was by an aper- 
ture at the top, « and this was kept shut as necessity required, by a 
large stone with an iron ring in it." The roof, which rose several 
feet above the level of the dungeon, was arched, but it is now com, 
pletely gone. Anciently, this fortress was surrounded by an inner 
and an outer wall : the former has entirely disappeared, but some 
remains of the latter still exist. The space between these walls, 
as may be inferred from the history of all border strengths, was 
primarily appropriated for the reception of cattle, in which the 
wealth of the marchmen principally consisted. A moat once sur- 
rounded the whole out-works, and of this some traces are still to 
be seen. Probably, it was supplied with water from a spring, which 
lies about a quarter of a mile to the south. 

This fortress, from its great importance, was often the scene of 
hostile invasion in ancient times. In the reign of Henry VIII. 
the Earl of Surrey, after destroying a number of places in the neigh- 
bourhood, attempted to take it by assault; but he asserts in a let- 
ter addressed to his sovereign, on the 21st May 1523, that, had 
the owner not agreed to capitulate, he would have been unable to 
have obtained possession of it at all. With the exceptions of Fast 
Castle and Dunbar Castle, he represents it as the strongest place in 
Scotland; but this he did, in all likelihood, to magnify his own ex- 
ploits, in the eye of his capricious master. This castle, there is 
reason to believe, ceased to be regularly occupied by the noble fami- 
ly of Roxburghe, shortly before the death of Sir Robert Ker in 
1650, and since that period, it has been allowed, in. all probability 
gradually, to go into a state of dilapidation. According to the 
testimony, however, of Wodrow, the historian, Henry Hall of 
Haughhead, and some others of the Covenanters, were confined 
as prisoners here in 1666; but the former, through the influence 
of the then Earl of Roxburghe, his friend and relation, ac- 
complished his release. The ancient key of this fortress was ac- 
cidentally discovered by a boy some years ago. It was dragged out 
from an aperture in the inside of the wall, close to the main door, 
where for nearly two centuries it had probably lain undisturbed. It

was of a very antique form, and measured about 1 1 inches in length. 
It is now in the possession of His Grace the Duke of Roxburghe. 

About a quarter of a mile to the north of the castle, in a steep 
bank close to Cessford-burn, is an artificial cave of considerable 
dimensions. It is in a very sequestered spot, and might be often 
passed and repassed without attracting observation. It is known 
by the name of Hobbie Ker's cave. 

On the southern banks of the Kale, near Eckford mill, is the 
small estate of Haughhead, which is one of the most retired spots 
in the parish, and which was once the property of Robert Hall, 
usually known by the name of Hobbie Hall, a man remarkable both 
for his piety and his bodily strength. About a quarter of a mile to 
the south of his ancient mansion-house, which is still in a tolera- 
bly good state of repair, is a mount which measures in circumfe- 
rence 218 feet, and to which the appellation of Haughhead Kipp is 
given. This is composed of artificial layers of earth and stone, 
and is surrounded with a clump of old fir trees, which, standing out 
from the extremity of a belt of young plantation, gives to the place 
when viewed at a distance, something like a turreted appearance. 
Placed on the summit of this mount is a rude stone, which, ac- 
cording to tradition, records a triumph achieved by Hall over 
Ker of Cessford, when ousted in his attempt to take lawless posses- 
sion of his property. The stone has been wantonly broken ; but 
the inscription on it, which is now scarcely legible, is as follows : 

Here Hoby Hall boldly maintained his right, 
Gainst Reif plain force armed with lawles might, 
For Twenty Pleughs harnes'd in all their Gear, 
Could not his valient nobl Heart make Fear, 
But with his sword he cut the formost Soam 
In two : hence drove both pleughs and 
Pleughmen home. 1620. 

About a quarter of a mile to the east of this mount, in a deep ra- 
vine through which the Kale over a rocky bed winds its way, is a 
sequestered spot where tent -preachings were wont to be held by the 
Covenanters of old; and a little farther down, on the opposite side 
o f the stream, near Grahamslaw farm-house, are to be seen several ar- 
tificial caves of various dimensions, whither that persecuted people us- 
ed to flee for refuge, in times of clanger. As is mentioned by Wodrow, 
they had two great conventicles in Scotland,— the one at Haugh- 
head, in this parish, and the other at Maybole, in the county of Ayr. 
From Henry Hall, the then proprietor of Haughhead, an indivi- 
dual both of the most undaunted courage and of the most unaffect-

ed zeal in ihe cause of religious truth, they experienced all the 
countenance and protection which his circumstances could afford. 
This excellent person, as is well known, died while on his way, as a 
prisoner, to Edinburgh, in consequence of being struck with a 
carabine by Thomas George, Queensferry; and on his person was 
found a rude unsubscribed draught of a covenant, which is common- 
ly known by the name of the Queensferry paper. 

Stone coffins have been frequently found in this parish. One was 
discovered in a field called the Priest's Crown on the farm of Eck- 
ford Eastmains, in 1831, containing a few decayed bones in one cor- 
ner, and a small jar with some black dust in it in the other. The 
jar was supposed to have been a Roman one, but it was unfortu- 
nately destroyed. On the farm of Moss-tower, a medal of the Em- 
press Faustina was found in the heart of a peat, with the inscription 
quite distinct. It was presented by the late tenant to a member of 
the noble family of Douglas. A little to the west of Caverton-hill- 
head cottages, are the remains of a tumulus of considerable extent, 
which is now nearly on a level with the contiguous field, and which 
is said to have been an ancient burying ground. No bones have as 
yet been discovered in it, but it has not hitherto been sufficiently 
examined; it is called the black dike. At Cavertonf there is an 
old grave-yard, now scarcely ever used. Near to it stood a chapel, 
of which there are now no remains. It was founded by Walter Ker 
of Cessford, and confirmed by charter under the grand Seal in the 
year 1500. Close to this was a well which used to be called the 
Priest's well, but by this name it has almost ceased to be known.

Eminent Men. — In this parish, at Marlefield, was born Sir Wil- 
liam Bennet of Grubbet, a man of excellent taste and great literary 
at tainments, and a distinguished patron of talent and learning in his 
day. This individual was the intimate friend of Thomson and Ram- 
say, and has been represented to be the Sir William Worthy of the 
celebrated pastoral poem f written by the latter. Indeed it is af- 
firmed that both he and Thomson had some share in the compo- 
sition of the comedy. In this parish, he lived during the greater 
part of his life, and by the community at large was held in- high 
estimation, j 

In the society of this distinguished individual, Thomson spent 

• The House of Marlefield is a very spacious edifice. In front of it is a most 
beautiful lawn, and the grounds in its vicinity are in various places embellished with 
rows of magnificent lime-trees. This estate was much improved by the late tenant, 
Mr Ralph Oliphant, a gentleman who was highly respected in the district for his 
amiable and obliging deportment ; and it is but a just tribute to his memory to add, 
that he took a deep interest in every matter connected with the welfare of the parish. 

f Tradition avers that the scene of the Gentle Shepherd lies in the vicinity of 
Marlefield House ; but with what truth the writer of this account does not presume 
to determine. Doubtless, however, many of the descriptions, as given in the poem, 
correspond with the character of the scenery here. On this estate anciently stood 
a cottage which went by the name of Symorts Bouse, and here too is a field which 
was wont to be called SyifimCs Field. In this district, also, once resided two old wo- 
men who have been represented as answering the characters of Mouse and Madge. 
Within a short distance from Marlefield, to which Ramsay refers by name in one of 
his poems, is a sequestered spot called HalbteS How, through which, over a pebbly 
channel, runs a small burn or rivulet on its way to the Kale. This burn, which in 
some parts is confined within pretty steep banks, flowed, in the days of Bennet, close 
to Marlefield mansion-house ; but in this quarter its course was altered many years 
ago through part of this estate. Along the bottom of a narrow glen flows also a 
small stream, which is vulgarly pronounced Mowses Bum, but from what source the 
term is derived it is perhaps impossible now to ascertain. Near this, too, is a small 
eminence which is denominated Mouses knowe. Here there are several craigs from 
which the " Lover's loup" may be most effectually taken. In the body of the poem, 
mention is made of the West- Port and Town of Edinburgh, as if these were not 
far distant from the scene of it ; but it is well known that the tenantry here, m the 
time of the poet, used to drive their stock as regularly to that city for sale, as they 
at present do to the market at Morpeth. Of course their visits to Edinburgh in those 
davs were of no rare occurrence. Indeed the phrase, " He was in at the fown, as 
referring to Edinburgh, is common in this district at the present day. Here the 
nastoral is reported to have been first acted, in the presence of the families of Marle- 
field and Clifton, and at the residence of the latter. As the above tradition exists in 
the parish, the writer of this account has judged it right to advert to it. Probably, 
however, Ramsay in the delineations of character and scenery which he gives in his 
admirable pastoral, confined himself to no-particular district, but drew bis descrip- 
tions from every proper source which at any time was most patent to his observation. 
Of course some licence, too, must be allowed to the imagination of the poet. 

+ Adjoining to the church, is the family aisle, where his remains are deposited ; and 
over the entry is the following inscription, which is now much effaced :

some of the happiest days of his life, and was in all respects regard- 
ed as a member of the family.  

Richard Cameron, the founder of the Cameronians, was licensed 
at Haughhead, in this parish, to preach the gospel. In 1680 he was 
slain at the battle of Ayrsmoss. 

Landholders. — In this parish, there are six landholders : His 
Grace the Duke of Roxburghe; His Grace the Duke of Buccleuch ; 
the Most Noble the Marquis of Tweeddale; Robert Mein, Esq. of 
Ormiston ; the Heirs of the late Andrew Wilson, Esq. of Main- 
house; and William Ker, Esq. of Chatto. Of these the Duke of 
Roxburghe and the Duke of Buccleuch, are by far the largest pro- 
prietors ; and to them, upwards of four-fifths of the parish belong. 

Parochial Registers. — Of the parochial registers there are five 
volumes, and the date of the earliest entry is 27th May 1694. At 
present, they are very carefully kept ; but as the dissenters do not 
regularly engross their children's names into the record, the list of 
baptisms cannot be so complete as it would otherwise be. 

Public Buildings. — Within these few years, Mr William Mather, 
an observing mechanic of this place, having purchased about half an 
acre of land from the late William Mein, Esq. of Ormiston, has erect- 
ed upon it an establishment for making all kinds of agricultural im- 
plements. This is one of the most extensive concerns of the kind in 
this quarter of the country, and the articles which are made here will, 
in point of workmanship, bear to be compared with any of a like de- 
scription in the surrounding district. Here Mr Mather intends to 
erect a saw-mill ere long; and from such, considerable benefit may 
probably accrue to the neighbourhood. There are three mills in this 
parish where corn may be ground, viz. Ormiston mill, Eckford mill, 
and Cavertonmill; but of these the first mentioned is by far the most 

 It is worthy of remark, that the poet was apt to be extremely apprehensive of 
supernatural spirits. If after night fall, he chanced at any time to be on his way from 
Wideopen, his patrimonial property, to Marlefield, he was in the habit of regularly 
calling at a firm-house in the vicinity of the latter, and requesting one of the inmates 
to accompany him to the seat of his patron. Lady Bennet, who appears to have been 
a person of considerable humour, used sometimes to play on the weakness of the poet. 
1 radition avers that, on one occasion, when there was a large party at Marlefield, she 
dressed up a figure in the human form, and secretly deposited it in the bed of Thom- 
son. 1 he unsuspecting poet descried the figure, when on the eve of putting on his 
night dress, and his cries of terror proclaimed that the frolic had been successful. 
Hushing down stairs he entered the drawing-room in a state somewhat approaching 
to frenzy, and truly caused her Ladyship, who, in the impulse of the moment, threw 
an apron around him, to repent of the extravagance which she had committed. With- 
in two miles of Marlefield, in the parish of Morebattle, is a hill on which Thomson is 
said to have written Ins Winter, and which, from its having two tops, is called Parnas- 
sus- Here ' 'V 1 of latc years, his anniversary was wont to be celebrated by a large as.

important. There is also in this parish an excellent rice-mill, which 
was erected at Ormiston several years ago by the late proprietor; 
but, from circumstances, it has never as yet been in active operation.

There are, as nearly as can be ascertained, 17 births, 10 marriages, 
16 deaths, at an average, in this parish in the course of the year. 
All the heritors have upwards of an annual rental of L. 50 Sterling, 
and only one of them resides in the parish. There are 2 deaf 
and dumb, and 3 fatuous persons in the district. The popula- 
tion of this parish, in so far as can be traced, is greater at present 
than it has been at any previous period of its history. This increase 
is no doubt owing to the general improvement which has. taken 
place on the character of the soil, and which of course renders a 
greater number of hands necessary for the purposes of agriculture 
than formerly. 

Character of the People. — The people are in general cleanly in 
their habits, industrious in their conduct, and regular in their at- 
tendance on the ordinances of religion. They enjoy, in a reason- 
able degree, the comforts and advantages of society, and may be 
said upon the whole, to be contented with their circumstances in 
life. The ordinary food of the peasantry is meal, potatoes, butter- 
milk, and pork of their own rearing. The bread commonly used 
by them is a compound of barley and pease meal, and it is consi- 
dered as extremely wholesome. To these is occasionally added a 
little butcher meat. Poaching, both in game and in the salmon 
fisheries, is not unfrequently practised in the district.

and by their liming, draining, &amp;c. are evincing a laudable anxiety 
still more to ameliorate the character of the soil. They are much at- 
tached to their landlords, who treat them in return with kindness and 
liberality. The largest farm in this parish is the Barony of Cess- 
ford, which consists of upwards of 2000 acres of land, and which 
has long been occupied by Mr Archibald M'Dougall, a gentleman 
whose ancestors resided for generations on the Roxburohe estate in 
this quarter, and who is well known to be one of the most skilful 
and intelligent agriculturists in the district. Within these thirty 
years, the improvements which he has effected on that property have 
been very great. In the course of that time, he has enclosed, at 
his own cost, the whole farm, drained it in the most efficient man- 
ner, and brought under cultivation upwards of 300 acres of moor- 
land. Besides, he has removed all the old offices and cottages, and 
erected in a more eligible situation new ones of the neatest and 
most substantial kind. Independently of the expenses of liming 
the whole of this large farm, his outlay amounted to upwards of 
L. 4000. 

The system of husbandry which is usually practised in this pa- 
rish is the five-shift system. The turnips are partly eaten off the 
land by sheep, and partly stored up as provisions for fattening cat- 
tle during the winter. Of leases the usual duration is for nineteen 
years. The fences are in good order, and consist mostly of thorns. 
The farm-houses and offices are also in excellent order, and have 
been some of them erected within these twenty years. 

Produce. — The average gross amount and value of raw produce 
raised in the parish, as nearly as that can be ascertained, are as 
follow : 

575 acres of wheat, at L. 8 per acre, - - L. 4600 0 0

size.

Villages, Market-Towns, Means of Communication. — There are 
several villages in this parish ; but the most important are Eckford, 
Cessford, and Caverton. The nearest market-towns are Kelso and 
Jedburgh, the former being about four miles and a half, and the 
latter about five miles and a half, distant from the parish church. 
About a mile and a half of the turnpike road between Hawick and 
Kelso runs through the parish ; and along this, a coach passes between 
these two places by the way of Jedburgh, every Tuesday and Fri- 
day. There is also a post which passes regularly along this line of 
road twice every day. In this parish, there are two stone bridge-, 
both of one arch, — the one over the Kale near its junction with the 
Teviot, and the other over that stream near Eckford mill. The 
former was built many years ago at the expense of the county, and 
forms part of the great turnpike road which passes through the dis- 
trict ; the latter is reported to have been erected, towards the close 
of the seventeenth cenutry, out of the proceeds of the stipend 
when there was no fixed pastor in the parish. There is, besides, 
an elegant chain bridge, which, a few years ago, was thrown over 
the Teviot near its confluence with the Kale, at the expense of 
the Late William Mein, Esq. Ormiston, and which, independently 
of the advantages resulting from it, forms a beautiful and interest- 
ing object. It was designed by Captain Samuel Brown of the 
Royal Navy, a gentleman whose talents and genius are well known, 
and the workmanship was executed in the most elegant and sub- 
stantial manner by Mr William Mather, Kalemouth. The bridge 
is 180 feet in length, and 16 feet in breadth, and is intended for 
carriages as well as foot-passengers. There is a pontage upon it, 
which is as follows : for a foot-passenger |d., for a horse or cart 
3d., for a gig 6d., and for a chaise Is. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church, which anciently belonged to 
the Abbey of Jedburgh, is in the gift of the Crown. It is beau- 
tifully situated on the southern banks of the Teviot, about a mile 
from the northern extremity of the parish. It was built in the year 
1662, but since then it has undergone frequent repairs. It is a neat 
and an apparently substantial building, and contains about 300 sittings. 
Close to the eastern door of the church, is appended an iron collar, 
which is in a state of great preservation, and which is commonly known 
by the name of thejugs. In former times, church offenders were some- 
times sentenced by kirk-sessions, to stand with it fastened round 
their neck, and clothed with sackcloth, for several Sabbaths, in pre-

sence of the congregation in token of their repentance and humi- 
liation. The manse was built in 1775, but since then it has under- 
gone several repairs. In the year ]808, some additions were made 
to it, but these, perhaps from want of a proper inspector, were very 
insufficiently executed. The chief apartment of the house is, in 
appearance, a very handsome one, but it has not been occupied for 
several winters past, in consequence of its extreme cold. The ex- 
tent of the glebe is about 7 acres, and its value may be rated at about 
' 15s ' P er acre - The stipend amounts to 15 chalders, half meal 
and half barley, with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion expenses, and 
forty-two pounds of cheese from the tenant of Cessford, in the way 
of vicarage tithes. Besides this, the minister has a servitude for 
turf on a piece of moor-land, which lies on the south side of Wood- 
enhill, and which is about two miles distant from the manse The 
moor belongs partly to the Duke of Roxburghe and partly to the 
Duke of Buccleuch, but the road to it lies through the farm of 
Wooden, the property of the latter nobleman. There are no dis- 
senting or seceding chapels in the parish. There are 153 families 
attending the church, and 69 attending meeting-houses in the vici- 
nity. The parish church is well attended. The average number 
of communicants for some years past has amounted to about 312 
The number of examinable persons that worship at the parish 
church amounts to upwards of 520. There is one Episcopalian 
family, which generally attends the Established Church f 

Education.-Theve are two parochial schools in the parish, the 
one at Eckford, and the other at Caverton mill, and both teachers 
have the legal emoluments. The teacher at Eckford has the maxi- 
mum salary L. 34, 4s. 4d., with fees amounting at an average to 
U 21 annually. The teacher at Caverton-mill has L. 17, 2s 2d 
with fees amounting at an average to L. 17 annually, with the inte- 
rest of L 40 of mortified money. The former has, at an average, 
about 70 scholars, and the latter about 46. There is also a 
school at Cessford, which is upwards of two miles distant from the 
parish schools, and which is attended at an average by 38 scholars 
With the exception of a free school-house he receives only his fees 
which amount to about L. 18 annually. The people are in gene-

ral alive to the benefits of education, and it is believed that there 
are none in the parish above six years of age who cannot read. 
There is also a boarding-school for young ladies in this parish ; 
and the number that at present attend it amounts to upwards of 
20. Here, they are instructed in all the usual branches of educa- 
tion, and to their moral and religious welfare every attention is 
paid. The establishment is kept by Misses Park and Spence, 
Upper Wooden. A Sabbath-school also exists in the parish, which, 
under the superintendence of the minister, is taught by the teacher 
of the first parish school, and several other well-disposed persons 
in the district. 

Library. — In the parish, there are two branches of an itinerat- 
ing library, — the one at Eckford, and the other at Caverton-mill. 
They are placed under the care of the parish teachers, and the 
books are lent to the people on their payment of a small sum 
quarterly. It is proposed, as soon as circumstances will permit, to 
establish a stationary library in the district. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — Regular assessments in behalf of 
the poor have existed for many years in the parish, and these are 
levied in equal proportions on the proprietors and tenants. There 
are at present on the roll the names of 30 paupers, and these re- 
ceive at an average about 2s. per week. Besides these, there are 
4 who obtain interim supply, and who are not regarded as regular 
paupers. There is no mortified money ; and the collections at 
the church doors, as is almost always the case where assessments 
have been established, are exceedingly small. In this district, an 
aversion among the poor to seek parochial aid still, to a certain 
extent, exists. No sooner, however, is an application for charity 
made by an indigent individual before a meeting of the heritors 
and kirk-session, than the circumstances in which he is placed 
are at once made known to his neighbours, and the consequence 
is, that the sense of shame with which he once contemplated the 
idea of his wants, being exposed, soon comes for the most part to 
be diminished, if not altogether effaced. Now surely it were advis- 
able, as far as possible, to remedy this evil ; and how can this- more 
effectually be done, than by distributing, in as delicate a way as may 
be, a little aid to such needy individuals, as may shrink at the 
thought of being regarded as regular paupers. With the concur- 
rence of all parties, this assistance might easily be afforded out of a 
fund placed at the disposal of some responsible persons in the dis- 
trict, named by heritors and kirk-sessions for that purpose. The ad- 
vantages arising from this system are so very palpable, indeed, that

many parishes regularly act upon it, while there are others so in- 
different to their own interest, as in a great measure to neglect it 
Inns.— There are no public-houses in this parish. Fo &amp; r many 
years, there was an inn established in the immediate vicinity of the 
church, and it was justly regarded as a public nuisance, by every 
right thinking person in the community. 

Fuel.— The ordinary fuel which is used here is coal, and which 
is brought from a distance of twenty miles. There are several de- 
pots in the neighbourhood, where the supply of this useful article 
may be obtained at about the rate of 9d. per cwt Wood is also 
frequently used.

PRESBYTERY OF KELSO, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TEVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. GEORGE CRAIG, MINISTER, 



xr L — Topography and Natural History. 

Name .— The name of this parish is of doubtful origin. Chal- 
mers m his Caledonia, gives two conjectures ; one, that it may have 
been derived from Sprous, a proper name, and Tun a dwelling • the 
other, that Sprus in the Cornish dialect signifying "grain »L™ 
tun may « denote the place fertile in grain." This latter is a very 
appropriate derivation. J 

Extent, Boundaries.- figure and extent the parish forms 
nearly a square of about 4 miles. The boundaries are, the Tweed 
on the north ; the parish of Carham in Northumberland on the east 
the parish of Linton on the south; the parishes of Eckford and 
Kelso on the west. 

Topographical Appearances.- o elevations of gradual ascent 
run across from north-east to south-west,-Hadden-rig hr ugh 
the centre, and Lempitlaw along the southern extremity. The 

:tw 117 s rr  laces marshy  and ' with the  of 

a few acres on Hadden-ng, contains almost the only portion of the 
parish not under cultivation. J 1 

M -The soil, along the river especially, is very productive, and 
s kept in a stete of high cultivation. The ReddLhaughs are 
famous for their extent, and for the sureness and abundance of 
then- crops. Along the river, the soil consists of a rich loam i„ 



28i 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



some places of considerable depth, upon a bed of sand. In the 
higher parts of the parish, the clayey substratum predominates. 
Hadden-rig above Kerchesters is the least productive part of the 
parish which is under cultivation. As you recede from this cen- 
tre on all sides, but especially towards the river, the soil becomes 
warmer and more productive. This last remark regarding the soil 
is equally applicable to the climate. 

Climate. — Comparatively bleak on Hadden-rig, the air is bracing 
on Lempitlaw, mild and salubrious along the river. The inhabi- 
tants, accordingly, are healthy and robust. The most prevalent dis- 
tempers are fever, pulmonary complaints, and rheumatism. By this 
last, men and women, comparatively young, are frequently attacked, 
and rendered unfit for work during the rest of their lives. The cause 
of these distempers at once presents itself in the openness and damp- 
ness of the houses, which in most instances have originally been built 
with mud for mortar. Were proprietors of land to give more at- 
tention to the household comfort of those who live on their estates, 
they would in the end effect a considerable saving ; as many, by 
longer health, would be enabled to provide longer for themselves 
and their families. 

II. — Civil History. 
The earliest mention made of this parish in any authentic do- 
cument is found in the foundation charter of Selkirk dated 1114. 
It is also mentioned in the charter given to Kelso Abbey in 1128, 
as one of the parishes which was held in rectorid by that institu- 
tion. Redden and Hadden are also referred to as contributing to 
the same institution. These places were probably of greater im- 
portance formerly, than they are now. Redden is mentioned as 
a towu in connexion with Kelso, Sprouston, &amp;c. in a writ of Pro- 
tection granted by Henry VII. to the monastery of Kelso. The 
former importance of Hadden would appear from the permission 
granted to Bernard de Hawden by the Abbot of Kelso, to build 
a private chapel, where " he and his guests might hear divine ser- 
vice all the days of the year except on Christmas day, Easter day, 
and the feast of St Michael," when they were obliged to attend the 
parish church. 

Hadden-stank and Redden-burn are frequently spoken of, in 
border history, as the spots on which the English and Scotch 
Commissioners met for the fixing of boundaries, and for the set- 
tling of other territorial disputes. 

About the year 1540, Hadden-rig was the scene of a conflict be- 
tween the Scots and 3000 English horse, in which the latter were 



_ „ , , , 



SPROUSTON. 237 

defeated. This was shortly after followed by an incursion into 
Scotland, by a large army led by the Duke of Norfolk, which, 
marching up the Tweed, destroyed many towns and villages. 
Among the latter, was the village of Sprouston, then called Long- 
Sprouston, extending probably, with straggling cottages, as far west 
as Burnfoot, which tradition says it once did. Tradition reports 
besides, that hearths and foundations of houses and kitchen uten- 
sils have been ploughed up in the field above the Scurry rock \ 
from which, it would appear that the village was formerly of 
greater extent on that side also. 

The barony of Lempitlaw, which forms the southern division 
of the parish, was originally a separate parish, but was, at a time 
which has not been ascertained, united to that of Sprouston. Part 
of the ruins of its church were, till recently, to be seen in t he church- 
yard, which still continues to be the burying-place for that part of 
the parish. 

Parochial Registers. — The oldest session records now extant 
bear date from 1650 till 1656, and seem to have been pretty ful- 
ly and regularly kept; but they are "now in a very imperfect and 
decayed state. The records subsequent to that period, with the 
exception of one interval between 1656 and 1691, are almost entire. 

Eminent Men.— The late Dr Andrew Thomson was ordained 
minister of this parish in 1802, and translated to Perth in 1808. 
It is said of him, that when the alarm of invasion by the French 
was raised by fire-beacons on the neighbouring heights, he head- 
ed a numerous body of volunteers from the parish, and led them 
to Kelso, the appointed rendezvous for this district. This is the 
more remarkable, as the parishioners were supposed to be much 
infected with French principles. 

III. — Population. 

The population would appear from the last Statistical Account, 
and from other circumstances, to have continued very nearly the 
same in amount, for the last century. Its present amount is some- 
what less than 1400. In the village of Sprouston it is 420; in 
that of Lempitlaw 130.

ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



During the last three years there have been not less than 6 it- 
legitimate births in the parish. 

The whole of the original parish of Sprouston is the property 
of the Duke of Roxburghe, with the exception of Hadden and 
Notilees, which are the property of Sir William Elliot of Stobbs 
and Wells ; and the farm of Softlaw, which is the property of 
Sir George Douglas of Springwood. Lempitlaw barony is the 
property of the Duke of Buccleuch. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — All the male population, with the exception of 
26 weavers, 16 masons, 10 wrights, 6 tailors, 4 smiths, and their 
apprentices, 1 cooper, 1 .baker, and 1 fisherman, are employed in 
agriculture, either as hinds, carters, or day-labourers. A great 
proportion of the unmarried female popidation are employed in the 



fields and barn-yard.

Wages. — Day's-wage for labouring men, is. 6d. ; women, 9d. ; 
masons, 2s. 6d. 

Live-Stock. — The Leicester is the breed of sheep usually fed. 

Husbandry. — Five-shift, or alternate husbandry, is generally 
adopted in cultivating the soil. Improvements by draining and 
otherwise carried forward to an average extent. Nineteen and 
twenty-one years are the length of the lease commonly given. 
The buildings and enclosures on some of the farms are excellent, 
on others they might be better. 

Quarries. — Sprouston, till of late, was celebrated for a freestone 
quarry, situated about half a mile from the village, and close by the 
turnpike road. Kelso bridge and Abbotsford were built of its 
stone. A new quarry has been opened about half a mile to the 
south of the old one, which produces an inferior stone, and is 
not considered very profitable in the working. 

Fisheries. — There is a fishery for salmon, which, along with a 
ferry for the convenience of the parishioners, is at present let for 
L. 71, 15s. 

Produce. — 

The average produce of grain of all kinds, whether cultivated for food of man or for 

domestic animals, may be estimated at 1-. 16,537

V. — Parochtal Economy. 

Markets. — There is no market held in this parish ; the nearest 
market-town, Kelso, being only two miles distant. 

Villages. — Of these there are two, — Sprouston and Lempitlaw. 
The former is situated about 200 yards from the river, and is nearer 
to Kelso than to Carham parish by about a mile. It consists of 
103 inhabited cottages, the school and schoolmaster's house just 
newly erected, and the manse. The church is in the centre of the 
village, and is built on what appears to be a gravelly eminence, of 
about twelve feet above the turnpike road. A spacious church -yard 
surrounds it, which, in 1814, was enclosed with an excellent stone 
wall five feet high. It had before that time, like many other country 
church-yards, been an open unenclosed space, intersected with nu - 
merous footpaths. The expense of the wall was defrayed by va- 
cant stipend. 

Lempitlaw consists of twenty-three inhabited cottages, and three 
one-storey farm-houses, and onsteads; one of the three being at 
the south-west, and two at the north-east end of the village. 

Two turnpike roads run east and west across the parish ; one 
through Sprouston and Carham to Cornhill, the other along Had- 
den-rig to Wooler. The parish roads are in good repair, are 
maintained by converted statute labour, and have lately in some 
places been greatly improved. 

Ecclesiastical State. — Though the parish church is situated in the 
centre of the village of Sprouston, and therefore at one extremity 
of the parish, it cannot be said to be at a very inconvenient distance 
from any of the inhabitants. Mensilaws, an old farm-steading, now 
three cottages, at the extreme east, and one cottage at the extreme 
south-west of the parish, are between four and five miles distant. 
Lempitlaw district, Lurdenlaw, and Softlaw, which together con- 
tain about sixty families, are between three and four miles distance, 
and all the rest from one to two miles distance. 

The present church was built in 1781, had the stairs to the gal- 
lery, which are inside, inclosed in 1822, and nothing now is want- 
ing to render it a very comfortable place of worship but the flagging 
of the floor. 

The number of families in the parish attending the chapels of 
Dissenters or Seceders is about 90. 

The seats, 600 in number, are all free, but allocated to particular 
farms. Divine service is generally well attended. The average 



240 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



number of communicants is 430. There is no meeting-house in the 
parish. 

The present manse was built in 1777, is small, but at present 
in good repair. 

The glebe, which lies between the manse and the river, contains 
7 acres 18 poles. It is land of the very best quality, and of cor- 
responding value. It has produced remarkably abundant crops. 

The stipend is 14| chalders meal and barley, and L. 44 money. 

Education. — There are three schools in the parish, the parochial 
and two side-schools. Of the latter, one is at Hadden, and was par- 
tially endowed by Lady Ker in the seventeenth century. The other 
is at Lempitlaw, and was endowed by the heritors in 1814, by ap- 
propriating for that purpose L. 100 vacant stipend. In the parish 
school the branches of education taught are the same as in other 
country schools. The schoolmaster's salary is L. 30. His emolu- 
ments from fees, which, per quarter, are, 2s. 6d. for reading ; 3s. 
for reading and writing; 4s. for reading, writing, and arithmetic; 
7s. 6d. for Latin, amount to about L. 40. He has at present no 
garden, but has from the heritors L. 2 in lieu thereof. In the two 
other schools, there is no Latin taught, but all the other branches 
of a common country education. At Hadden, the emoluments al- 
together scarcely exceed L. 15; at Lempitlaw, they may be about 
L. 30. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The poor are supported by legal 
assessment. The number on the roll is 43 ; their average allow- 
ance L. 3, 14s. 9d. per annum. In some cases, the allowance grant- 
ed by the heritors is increased by the session. Those who have 
been assisted in this way during the past year amount to 16, and 
the average assistance to each is lis. per annum. The average 
annual amount of assessments for the poor is L. 160, 14s, 3d. ; of 
church collections, L. 10, 9s. 5d. 

It has not been observed that there is any indisposition on the 
part of the poor to apply for parochial relief. Applications have 
sometimes been made, — more, seemingly, from a desire to add to the 
little comforts already possessed, than to remove pressing want, — 
more from a preference of dependence on a public fund, than of de- 
pendence on children in narrow circumstances, who, it is to be fear- 
ed, too often make their parents sensible of their dependence. Such 
applications when rejected, are uniformly attended with a feeling of 
experienced injustice on the part of the applicants. Vicinity to 
England may in some degree account for this.

PRESBYTERY OF JEDBURGH, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TEVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. JOHN PATON, MINISTER. 



I- — Topography and Natural History. 

Name and Boundaries. — This parish was originally named Alne- 
crumb, from Alne, the ancient name of the river, and Crumb, a 
crook or bend, than which there could have been no name more 
descriptive of the situation of the village of Ancrum, which is 
placed on a rising ground on the south side of the Water of Ale, 
where the river takes a peculiar bend, and runs in a circuitous direc- 
tion, till it discharges itself into the Teviot, about half a mile below. 
The parish is about six miles long and four broad, and is bound- 
ed on the south by the river Teviot, which divides it from the pa- 
rishes of Jedburgh and Bedrule ; on the east by Crailing and Rox- 
burgh ; on the north by Maxton and St Boswell's ; and on the west 
by Minto and Lilliesleaf. 

Topographical Appearances, Hydrography, Soil, Sf C .~ The 
lower part of this parish is beautifully diversified, presenting every 
variety of irregular surface; and though it contains no hills, pro- 
perly so called, it rises in some places into eminences of consider- 
able height. On the Water of Ale especially, which is here and 
there o'erhung by steep and rugged rocks, partly of naked rock, 
and partly clothed in wood, there meets the eye a succession of 
scenery in the highest degree romantic and picturesque. Toward 
the upper extremity, however, the appearance of the parish be- 
comes less interesting, from the general flatness of the ground 
and the absence of any thing in the landscape peculiarly striking' 

The only rivers are the two already mentioned,— the Teviot and 
the Ale,-~the former being the southern boundary of the parish, 
and the latter intersecting it from west to east; and both of these 
streams, in add.t.on to their acknowledged beauty, have been long 
celebrated as affording abundant sport for the angler. 

The soil of this parish is extremely variable, including every 
variety, from the most barren to the most productive. Its average

quality, however, is good ; and on the banks of the Teviot, espe- 
cially, it is not excelled, in respect of depth and richness, by that 
of any district of Roxburghshire. 

II. — Civil History. 

Historical Notices, Sfc. — This parish consists of the two united 
parishes of Longnewton and Ancrum, the former of which was 
annexed to the latter, towards the end of the seventeenth century. 
Of the old church of Longnewton there are now no remains, but 
its burying-ground is still made use of by some of the inhabitants 
of that western district. 

The church of Ancrum anciently belonged to the Bishopric 
of Glasgow, of which University, indeed, many of the lands here 
still hold : and Longnewton was subject to the same Episcopal 
superintendence, though its revenues belonged to the monastery of 
Jedburgh. It appears from the documents referred to in " Cale- 
donia," that, upon the dissolution of the establishment of Lindis- 
fern, Ancrum with Teviotdale was annexed to the see of Glas- 
gow, and that Teviotdale was erected into a separate archdeaconry 
in 1238. 

At one period, there were two villages here, distinguished from 
each other by the names of Over and Nether Ancrum. The former 
stood on the north side of the Ale, in the immediate vicinity of 
Ancrum House, according to the usual precaution adopted in these 
feudal times, when juxtaposition and mutual protection were so 
essentially requisite between the Lord of the Manor and his vas- 
sals. Of this village, however, nothing now remains, except 
one or two dilapidated houses, bearing date 1592. But on the 
opposite side of the river, still' stands the other village referred to, 
though most of it appears to be of a more modern erection. Both 
of these villages were burned to the ground during the destructive 
expeditions of Sir Ralph Evers in 1544, and the Earl of Hertford 
in 1545. 

The most remarkable event of a historical nature connected with 
this parish is the battle of Ancrum Moor, which was fought about 
a mile and a-half to the north of the village ; but on the particu-

 There are various documents relating to the parish of Ancrum in the Chartu- 
lary of Glasgow ; in particular, there is, in the early part of the thirteenth century, 
a curious charter by Radulphus Burnard of Faringdune Farnington, in which he

of it to be found in almost all the Scottish histories, the fullest 
account being given by Tytler. We may just mention, that it 
took place in the year 1545, and arose out of an inroad into Scot- 
land by Sir Ralph Evers, and Sir Bryan Layton, for the purpose 
of taking possession of the territories of Teviotdale and the Merse, 
which had been conferred upon them by a grant from Henry VIIL, 
and in which battle they were defeated with great loss. It may 
be added, that it was on this occasion that the gallant Earl of 
Angus Bell the Cat whose property in the Merse and Teviot- 
dale was thus in such eminent peril, said of Evers and Layton, 
when he heard of their threatened incursion ; " If they come to 
take seizin in my lands, I shall bear them witness to it, and per- 
haps write them an investiture with sharp pens and red ink." 

Antiquities. — This parish presents prominently few objects of 
curiosity to the notice of the antiquary. But like the rest of the 
border country which saw the original inhabitants, the Romans, 
the Danes, and the Saxons, successively dispute its possession, it 
contains various scenes calculated to awaken a deep interest. Of 
this description are the ruins of the Maltan walls, which enclosed, 
at no distant period, an acre and a-half, within the area of which 
were visible various vaults and subterraneous passages, but of which 
there is now nothing to be seen except a small remnant of the 
outer wall. According to tradition, this was once an establishment 
of the Knights of Malta, or Knights Hospitallers of St John; and 
though there is not in Keith or Spottiswoode, any notice of any re- 
ligious house or hospital at Ancrum, we learn from various sources, 
that a religious establishment existed there as early as the reign 
of David L But be the tradition right or wrong in reference to 
this building, it is evident, that the adjacent field has been used 
for the purpose of interment, human bones and entire skeletons 
having been frequently turned up by the spade and plough. 

Near the Maltan walls, in the opposite grounds of Ancrum 
House, and for a considerable way up the Ale, are also to be seen 
various caves, amounting in all to fifteen, hewn out of the rocky 
banks of the river in the most inaccessible places. These caves 
have doubtless been intended and used for places of concealment 
in the times of the border wars. And many of them must have 

 Since the above was written the remnant referred to has fallen to the ground, 
lis oecay Having been doubtless hastened by the extraordinary severity of the past 
winter : so that nothing now remains of the " Maltan walls" but a heap of rubbish, 
ana in all likelihood within a short period there will not be even a stone left to mark 
the site of this relic of antiquity.

been well adapted for the purpose, having not only been extreme- 
ly difficult of discovery and access, but having been provided with 
fire-places and apertures in the roof to carry off the smoke, and 
commanding a plentiful supply of water. But the days are happily 
gone bye, when, from the predatory habits of the borderers, such 
hiding-places were rendered necessary ; and, as a pleasing contrast 
to their original destination, it may be mentioned, that they were 
often resorted to for retirement and meditation, by the author of 
the " Seasons ;" and one in particular, named " Thomson's Cave," 
is pointed out as his favourite retreat, and which is situated in the 
immediate vicinity of the manse, of which the poet was the frequent 
inmate during the incumbency of his friend Mr Cranston. — Mai- 
den Lilliard's tomb may also be considered as an interesting 
relic of the olden time. At the battle of Ancrum Moor, above- 
mentioned, a Scottish woman of this name distinguished her- 
self by her singular valour ; such being her undaunted gallantry, 
that she continued to fight when covered with wounds, and even 
after both her limbs had been struck off. In honour of her me- 
mory, the spot where she fought and fell, and on which she was 
buried, is marked by a monument, the original of which has almost 
all been destroyed, but in whose stead a new one was lately erect- 
ed, on which is inscribed the original epitaph, which runs thus: 

Fair maiden Lilliard lies under this stane, 

Little was her stature but great was her fame ; 

Upon the English loons she laid mony thumps, 

And when her legs were cuttit aff she fought upon her stumps. 

There are likewise on the hill behind Ancrum House the re- 
mains of a British fort, consisting of three circular divisions or 
rows of large whinstone boulders ; and at Harestanes, near Moun- 
teviot, there stood within these fifty years the remains of a Druid 
circle, but which now, with the exception of one solitary stone, 
have all been removed. And in the centre of the village green, 
there stands an ancient cross, which one of the most learned archi- 
tectural antiquaries of the present day thinks may be pronounced 
as old as the reign of Alexander III. 

Mansion- Houses. — There are three principal residences in the 
parish : Ancrum House, the seat of Sir William Scott, Bart, a 
fine old baronial-looking mansion, standing in the midst of an exten- 
sive park, in which are to be seen some of the finest trees in the 
south of Scotland, and whose picturesque effect is much increas- 

 The following is the measurement of some of these trees, the measurement being 
taken several feet from the root :

ed by the additional beauty of a numerous herd of deer ; Ches- 
ters, the more modern residence of William Ogilvie, Esq. a large 
and handsome building, erected about forty years ago, and delight- 
fully situated on the banks of the Teviot, at the mouth of a deep 
glen or dell, which stretches up behind the house, beautifully wood- 
ed on both sides ; and Kirklands, the elegant seat of John Richard- 
son, Esq. occupying a most romantic position on a wooded height 
over the water of Ale, which, sheltered by the picturesque green 
knolls and grey rocks and woods of Ancrum, forms an appropriate 
addition to the striking and beautiful scene of the church and old 
bridge, and mill immediately below it. This house, which has been 
recently erected after a design by Blore of London, is of the Tu- 
dor style of architecture, and of the reign of Henry VII. 

Eminent Men.—" Worthy famous Mr John Livingston," as he 
was fondly termed by his contemporaries, was, by an act of the 
General Assembly, settled minister of Ancrum in the year 1648. 
He was one of the three ministers sent over to King Charles II. 
in Holland in 1650, to make arrangements regarding the coming 
of that monarch to Scotland, and to treat with him in various im- 
portant matters, both civil "and religious, before his admission to 
the exercise of his government. In 1662, Mr Livingston, with 
many other ministers, was deposed for non-conformity, and hav- 
ing been also sentenced to banishment, he went over to Holland, 
where he occupied himself in his favourite pursuit, biblical litera- 
ture, till his death, in August 1672, in the seventieth year of his 
age. For farther particulars of this remarkable man, " who was 
honoured by the Lord to be an instrument in the conversion of thou- 
sands," reference may be made to a manuscript of his in the Ad- 
vocates' Library, and which is entitled, « A brief Historical Re- 
lation of the Life of John Livingston, Minister of the Gospel at 
Ancrum, with his memorable Characteristics, exemplified in the 
Lives of a considerable number of eminent Divines and private 
Christians in Scotland." His biography is contained in the Lives 
of Illustrious and Distinguished Scotsmen, by Robert Chambers, 
and several particulars relating to him are to be found in Wod- 
row's and Kirkton's Histories of the Church of Scotland.

III. — Population. 
The total amount of the population in this parish is 1454, of 
which about 550 are inhabitants of the village of Ancrum, and the 
remainder scattered throughout the other districts. The return 
to Dr Webster in 1755 gave ] 066 ; and at the date of the last Sta- 
tistical Account, there were 1146 souls. The increase of the po- 
pulation since these periods is to be attributed to the gradual im- 
provements in agriculture, and the additional demand for farm-ser- 
vants and labourers. 

Number of families in the parish, . . . 284

Character and Habits of the People Sfc. — The people of this pa- 
rish are in general well-behaved, industrious, and contented with 
their situation and circumstances. The cottages of the working- 
classes are cleanly and comfortable, their food, though plain, is 
sufficiently plentiful, and almost all of them have the means of 
gratifying that laudable desire, so characteristic of the peasantry 
of Scotland, of appearing at public worship on the Sabbath, re- 
spectably attired. But their several degrees of comfort vary, of 
course, according to the number of their family, the rate of their 
wages, and their habits of economy : and we have doubtless among 
us many instances of indigent old age still exerting its remaining 
strength in the praiseworthy pursuit of an independent though 
scanty livelihood, or wholly subsisting on private and parochial 
charity. 

There is no species of amusement to which the parishioners are 
especially attached, with the exception of the game of" ball," which 
is played only on one particular day of the year, in the month of 
February, the young men of one district being pitched against 
those of another. Similar games are also held annually, and about 
the same season, in some of the neighbouring parishes, and seem 
to create a considerable interest amongst the young men of the 
district. 

 It must, however, be admitted, that this commendation cannot be applied to all, 
there being not a few whose character is not only unworthy of praise, but whose re- 
probate conduct is much to be regretted, as well on their own account as on account 
of the morals and reputation of the parish generally.

The practice of killing salmon by the spear and torch is here 
carried on to a great extent, especially during close-time, and the 
numbers of foul fish that are annually taken in this way are very 
considerable. Poaching for game is also practised, though not to 
the same extent. 

During the last three years there have been 20 illegitimate 
births ; but in 8 of the cases, the parties were afterwards married. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The system of husbandry pursued here is in all 
respects similar to that of the surrounding districts. The five- 
shift rotation of cropping is that which is generally followed, and 
the common duration of leases is nineteen, and varying from that 
to fifteen years. 

The rent of the arable land varies of course with the quality of 
the soil, — in some cases reaching as high as L. 4, and in others de- 
scending to 12s. per acre. The average rent, however, of all the 
arable land in the parish may be stated at L. 1, 3s. per acre. The 
real rent of the parish is L. 8698. 

Rate of Wages.— A farm-servant's wage, every thing included, 
averages L. 28 per annum j that of a labourer Is. 8d. per day in 
summer, and Is. 6d. in winter; of a carpenter 2s., and of a mason 
2s. 6d. per day. Single men residing in the farmer's house receive 
from L. 7 to L. 8, and women from L. 6 to L. 7 per annum, vic- 
tuals included. 

Live-Stock.— The kind of live-stock generally reared in this pa- 
rish is what is commonly called the short-horned breed of cattle, 
and the Leicester breed of sheep, or a cross between the Leicester 
and Cheviot breeds. And the rate of grazing is as follows : A 
cow, L. 3, 10s. ; a three year old, L. 2, 10s. ; a two year old, L. 2 ; 
and a year old, L. 1, 10s. each : and a ewe, L. 1 per annum.

operation, the one consisting of red, and the other of white free- 
stone, the former belonging to the Honourable John Elliott, and

the latter to Mr Ogilvie of Chesters, and both of these stone being 
of superior quality, there is a large demand for them throughout 
the surrounding district. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Markets — Means of Communication, Sfc. — Though the parish 
has no market -town within its- own bounds, it is very favourably si- 
tuated in this respect, there being no fewer than five markets in 
the neighbourhood for the sale of grain, and to all of which there 
is good and easy access. Jedburgh, however, which is about six 
miles from the centre of the parish, may be reckoned the market 
to which the parishioners principally resort. It is also the post- 
town. The principal village in the parish is that of Ancrum, the 
inhabitants of which are almost all earning their livelihood in the 
usual agricultural or other employments of a country population. 
Some of them, however, are more independent than others, from 
the possession of a few patrimonial acres of land, and which in va- 
rious instances have descended from father to son, for several ge- 
nerations. Throughout the whole parish, the means of communi- 
cation enjoyed by the inhabitants is remarkably good, it being in- 
tersected in all directions by roads leading to the neighbouring dis- 
tricts : and along its eastern extremity for several miles, runs the 
turnpike road from Edinburgh to Newcastle, along which, summer 
 and winter, stage-coaches are passing and repassing twice a day. 

Ecclesiastical State. — Although the church is only about a mile 
from the eastern extremity of the parish, it is conveniently situat- 
ed for the great proportion of the population ; and even of the pa- 
rishioners in the western district, there are few who are above three, 
and none above four miles distant from it. It was built in 1762, 
was thoroughly repaired about five years ago, is a comfortable place 
of worship, and affords accommodation to about 520. The sittings 
belong exclusively to the heritors. 

The manse was built in 1751, since which period it has receiv- 
ed two additions, the last of which was made in 1833. It is now 
a comfortable and commodious house, and being delightfully situ- 
ated on one of the steep banks of the Ale, and surrounded on all 
sides by magnificent woods, and every variety of hill and dale, is 
perhaps not surpassed, in respect of local beauty, by any manse in 
Scotland. The glebe contains about 10 acres of arable land, be- 
sides a considerable quantity of natural and other wood, and is 
worth L. 30 per annum.

ANCRUM. 



249 



The stipend consists of 16 chalders of victual, and L. 8, 6s. 8d. 
for communion elements. 

There are 284 families in the parish, and of these there are, on 
an average, 160 families who attend the parish church. The re- 
mainder belong to one or other of the Dissenting meeting-houses 
in the neighbourhood. The average number of communicants in 
connection with the parish church is 470, and among these are to 
be found almost all the constant inhabitants of the parish, and the 
great majority of the tenants, so that the Dissenters consist princi- 
pally of the fluctuating population of hinds and other farm-servants, 
a great proportion of whom change every year, and of whom, there- 
fore, an accurate return cannot well be obtained. Upon the whole, 
however, it may be stated, that while there is no addition to the 
inhabitants of the parish, the number of its communicants in con- 
nection with the establishment is annually increasing. 

The parish church is the only place of worship, and though it 
is generally well attended, yet it is much to be regretted that there 
are not a few of the parishioners whose attendance upon the pub- 
he ordinances of religion is rare and irregular. 

There are no Bible or Missionary Societies in the parish, but 
there is an annual collection in the church for missionary or other 
religious purposes, which yields on an average about L. 6. 

Education.— There are three schools in the parish, the paro- 
chial, and two others. Of the latter, there is one which is endow- 
ed ; having been formerly the parish school of Longnewton, where 
it is situated, and still retaining the provision which it had previous- 
ly to the annexation of the parish of that name to the parish of 
Ancrum. Its endowment consists of L. 11 per annum, with a good 
house and garden, for the accommodation of the teacher ; and its 
patronage is vested in the proprietor of the barony of Longnewton. 

In all these schools the ordinary branches of education are 
taught, viz. English, English grammar, writing and arithmetic; in 
addition to which, in the parish school, instruction is given in Greek, 
Latin, French, geography and practical mathematics. For these 
latter branches, however, the demand is very limited. 

The parish schoolmaster has the maximum salary, the legal 
quant.ty of garden ground, and a good house, consisting of four 
apartments. He also receives the- annual interest arising from a 
sum of L. 50, which was left by a former resident in Ancrum, for 
behoof of the parish teacher, on the condition that he gives in-

struction in church music to some of the poorer children in the 
village. 

The school fees are, 2s. per quarter for reading, with 6d. addi- 
tional for writing and arithmetic ; and 5s. for Latin : the other 
branches being charged in proportion, according to the agreement 
which may be entered into between the parents and teacher. The 
average number of scholars attending the parish school is about 
90, and the amount of school fees is under L. 30 per annum. 

The average number of scholars attending all the schools toge- 
ther is about 220, and .to each of them there is attached a well- 
attended Sabbath school. 

The parents in general seem anxious to avail themselves of these 
opportunities of getting their children instructed, and there are 
no instances in the parish of individuals upwards of fifteen years 
of age who cannot read or write. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
on the poor's roll is about 30, and their aliment is obtained by re- 
gular assessments upon the heritors, for which purpose they meet 
quarterly and assess themselves, according to the amount of sup- 
ply required. The amount of assessment may be stated at about 
L. 150 per annum, paupers receiving from Is. to 4s. each per week, 
according to the necessity of the case. 

In addition to this, however, there are also the ordinary Sabbath 
day collections, amounting on an average to L. 15 per annum, over 
which the heritors claim no control, and all of which, with a small 
exception required for other purposes, is annually distributed by 
the kirk-session in occasional allowances of coals, meal, or money, 
among paupers requiring more than their ordinary aliment, or as 
interim supply to necessitous persons not on the roll. 

The poor in general are far from being backward in seeking pa- 
rochial relief, and the feeling of degradation in reference to such 
applications is neither so prevalent nor so strong as it was in for- 
mer times. 

J nns , There are 6 inns or public-houses in the parish. Of 

these, there are two in the village, and two within a quarter of a 
mile of it ; and, there being no fairs or markets in the parish, there 
are at least three of these ale-houses which might well be dispen- 
sed with. Their influence on the morals and circumstances of those 
in their immediate neighbourhood, who are in the habit of frequent- 
ing them, is very injurious. 

p lie l.— Amongst the lower classes the use of coals is limited,

the carriage being very expensive. The nearest coal-hill is thirty 
miles distant, and the driving alone costs 9s. for a single cart-load. 
Fire-wood, however, is abundant in the neighbourhood, and may 
be procured for a comparatively moderate price, at the numerous 
sales of that article, and being thus less expensive and more easy 
of access than coals, it is more generally made use of for fuel than 
the latter, especially among the labouring classes, and many of 
whom are also in the habit of laying up for this purpose furze, turf, 
or peat, all of which are to be had in the neighbourhood,— the two 
former on the common moor for the mere labour of cutting them, 
—and the latter from the adjoining districts at a very small cost' 
It may be added, that, for the convenience of the public in this 
district, there are several depots of coals within a few hours drive 
and at one of which Crailing only four miles distant, there are 
coals to be had through the year at from 6d. to 8d. per cwt. 
Miscellaneous Observations. 
1 he only striking variations which are apparent between the 
present state of the parish, and that which existed at the time of 
the last Statistical Account, consist in the improved system of 
agriculture, and in the additional extent of plantation. Here as 
elsewhere, draining is now better understood, and more generally 
and efficiently practised than it formerly was, though much yet re- 
quires to be done in this respect. 

The distance from lime, and the consequent heavy expense of 
obtaining it, remains yet, as it has hitherto been, the great obsta- 
cle to the reclaiming and improvement of the land in this neigh- 
bourhood. It may, however, be stated, thafthere is every pros- 
pect of th,s obstacle being so far obviated by the proposed formation 
of a railway from Berwick to Kelso, and from thence up the vale 
of the Teviot, and by the establishment of which, it is not to be 
doubted many important advantages, besides the reduction of the 
price of hme, would accrue to this district of country.

PRESBYTERY OF JEDBURGH, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TEVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. JAMES WIGHT, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name.— The name of this parish was, for several centuries, 
written Oxenham, as appears from the chartularies and evidence 
from other sources. It was but recently changed to Oxnam, this 
being simply a popular abbreviation of the former name. The 
words oxen and ham, or hamlet, serve when combined to indicate 
its origin. For it may be inferred, that the chief village ob- 
tained its distinctive appellation, principally because it abounded 
with oxen, and partly also because it afforded protection to nume- 
rous herds of cattle, during the many hostile and predatory incur- 
sions of the southern borderers. And the name thus acquired by 
the village, so long held in repute for the advantages of its situa- 
tion and the number of its inhabitants, was subsequently transfer- 
red to the parish at large. It is clear that the names of particu- 
lar animals had, in process of time, become so completely identi- 
fied with, as at length to be employed to designate, various places 
here, such as Stotfield, Swinside, and Hyndhope ; and that seve- 
ral others too— of which Mossburnford and Bloodylaws are instan- 
ces—bear names, either descriptive of certain remarkable localities 
that strike the view, or else expressive of some remote but memo- 
rable events of which they once formed the scene. These facts tend 
accordingly to corroborate the above statement. 

Extent and Boundaries.— The utmost length of this parish is 
nearly 10 miles; its greatest breadth about 5 miles; and it con- 
tains 33 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the parish 
of Jedburgh; on the east by Hownam ; on the south by Jedburgh 
and the county of Northumberland ; and on the west by Jedburgh 
and Southdean. Its area may be described as an irregular oblong 
figure. 

Topographical Appearances.— It may not be improper to ob- 
serve, that the tops of the highest hills command a most magnifi-

cent and delightful prospect, having the mountainous chains of 
Cheviot, Moffat, and Lammermuir, together with the German 
Ocean, in the distance ; and at the same time the vast expanse of 
country comprehended within this grand circular outline, overspread 
with an endless diversity of highly beautiful and picturesque scenes. 
Of the large forests which once greatly decorated the landscape, 
a few vestiges only have withstood the desolating influence of time. 
Nevertheless, this parish, as to its general appearance, is pecu- 
liarly interesting, exhibiting many striking varieties of hill and dale, 
well subdivided enclosures, excellent pasturage, and numerous 
streams of water. A small section of the Cheviot range partly 
constitutes its southern boundary, and stretches towards the Carter 
Fell, which rises 2020 feet above the level of the sea. But to this, 
the most elevated summit of that section is somewhat inferior in 
height. To the northward of this bounding ridge, are situated va- 
rious hills, chiefly of a conical form and smooth green aspect, but 
showing a less lofty elevation than the former. Again, other still 
humbler, yet towering eminences, appear in the same direction be- 
yond these,— which present acclivities either partially cultivated, or 
clothed with delicate verdure, and form, therefore, an imposing and 
agreeable contrast with the scattered portions of heath anrl benty 
grass conspicuous on the interjacent flats. Besides, the fertile val- 
ley that divides the parish lengthwise, has its own undulating sur- 
face variously intersected by the continuous windings of the Ox- 
nam water. And it may be observed, moreover, that the banks of 
the Jed bounding the western side, and presenting generally an 
abrupt and precipitous appearance, have their aspect pleasingly 
diversified by the termination of romantic dells in certain parts, 
and by narrow ravines ornamented with copse in others. Most of 
the banks, indeed, are richly adorned with natural wood, no less 
remarkable for the happily varied distribution, than for the beauti- 
ful form and foliage of its trees. 

Climate and Diseases.— The whole parish, in common with the 
surrounding district, is liable to sudden as well as frequent varia- 
tions of temperature. At times, the wind blows strongly from the 
east; but it is found to proceed most frequently and with greatest 
violence from the west and south-west. Yet, at other times, it 
Drmgs along with it, from the very same points, the mildest and 
most genial weather. The high-lying places, from their proximity 
t0 ;1 mountainous region, are more exposed to heavy rains, and at- 
mospheric changes, than the lower and more cultivated parts. This, 



254 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



in general, is nevertheless justly esteemed a favourable climate. It 
is said, indeed, that owing to the purity, elasticity, and salubrious- 
ness of the air, common epidemic diseases exhibit a less inveterate 
character here, than in many other places. The most approved 
system of drainage, so long and extensively applied both to arable 
lands and to marshy and hilly pastures, has no doubt largely con- 
tributed to the amelioration of the climate ; and thus served not 
merely to mitigate the severity, and prevent the recurrence of dis- 
tempers — such as ague, rheumatism, fevers, and pulmonary com- 
plaints — that were formerly so prevalent ; but also tended greatly 
to promote the healthfulness and longevity of the inhabitants. 

Springs and Rivers. — The waters of the spring situated near 
Fairloans, to which were ascribed qualities of a chalybeate nature, 
have utterly fallen into disuse. On being analyzed, they were 
found not to possess any mineral or medicinal virtues whatsoever. 
It may be worthy of notice, that between twenty and thirty peren- 
nial springs, in clustered order, and with margins of unfading fresh- 
ness, combine to form the Oxnam, at the commencement of its 
course. 

The Coquet water, which issues from the border mountains, skirts 
the southern extremity, to the extent of a mile, — then enters Nor- 
thumberland, and after having attained considerable magnitude, 
empties into the British ocean betwixt Alnwick and Coquet isle. 
It is from the same alpine region that the Kale takes its rise. It 
crosses the upper end of the parish, pursues a circuitous direction 
by Hownam and Morebattle, and terminates its course of seven- 
teen miles below the church of Eckford, by joining the Teviot. 
The sources of the Oxnam are nearly two miles distant from the 
English border. It takes its way at first through a pastoral dis- 
trict, then passing the village from which it borrowed its name, 
winds along occasionally prominent and ornamented margins, and 
after being largely augmented by tributary streamlets, also at length 
mingles its waters with the Teviot below Crailing, thereby clos- 
ing its rapid course of twelve miles. The Jed flows over a rug- 
ged channel, and along the western boundary for two miles. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — No coal has hitherto been discover- 
ed here, although certain local strata furnish strong indications of 
its presence. At Stotfield and Richard's Cleugh, steatite or soap- 
stone occurs. Limestone is found near the Jed, but it is under a

deep cover, and at a great distance from coal ; and hence the ex- 
pense necessarily attending its preparation for agricultural and 
other purposes, renders it wholly unavailable at present. In the 
southern quarters, sandstone of the coal formation abounds, be- 
tween which and the corresponding strata of the Carter, an .inti- 
mate connection may be found to subsist. What has been worked 
is of a durable quality and white colour; but it has been employed 
for building, only to a very limited extent. The same parts of the 
parish are traversed by a great whinstone dike, running in a lineal 
direction from east to west. It is upwards of thirty feet wide, and 
extends to a considerable distance on both sides of the border. On 
the one side, it is said to be perceptible in the environs of Milton ; 
at any rate, it may be observed passing the Kink, Tofts, Brundin- 
laws, Phaap, and the top of the hill opposite upper Hyndhope ; 
and on the other, it goes onward to Blindburn, Carlecroft, Cars- 
hope, Linshiels, Rothburry, and near the mouth of the Coquet. 
In the lower situations, greywacke prevails, having seams of slate 
clay, or dent, not unfrequently interposed between the strata, which 
run from north-east to south-west ; and dip from south to north 
at an angle of from 40 to 60 degrees. It is rock of the trap for- 
mation, of which the hills chiefly consist. Hence the extensive 
distribution of clay porphyry, which affords excellent metal for 
roads, those parts of it being commonly used that are most super- 
ficial, and in which the process of disintegration has partially taken 
place. It is copiously interspersed with quartzy veins, and pos- 
sesses cavities lined with finely crystallized incrustations of the same 
substance. The greenstone sometimes observed protruding from 
rock of this species may probably be portions of dikes penetrating 
the general mass. But the hills eastward of Swinside are evident- 
ly intersected by numerous veins of jasper. Of these, five have 
been laid open. One of the hills has a quarry on its brow, in 
which a vein is exposed of from three to twelve inches in thick- 
ness, adhering to the perpendicular face of the rock, which has 
been cleared to a large extent. There is one of a finer quality on 
the east side of the adjoining summit. But another still richer 
and of ampler dimensions was lately detected, when cutting a drain 
on the contiguous farm of Middlesknows. Here different kinds of 
agate, as well as sundry varieties of jasper, from which beautiful 
and valuable specimens might be selected, are found cither inter- 
mixed with the soil, or cast loosely upon the channel of the Ox- 
nam water.

Soil. — The soil exhibits widely different qualities in different 
places. The most predominating kinds are of a loamy, clayey, and 
gravelly nature; but of these many intermediate varieties and com- 
binations present themselves. The soil is deposited upon gravel 
in many parts ; it is found, in others, resting upon rock of the kinds 
specified above : while, in some rather elevated situations, the sub- 
stratum consists of bluish clay, so very tenacious and retentive as 
to be completely impervious to water. It may also be stated, that, 
a substance, vulgarly called moorband, occurs occasionally imbed- 
ded in the subsoil. Where the soil itself is scanty, and consists of 
dark-coloured vegetable matter, it often assumes the real form and 
appearance of bog-iron ore, is found in detached portions, and is 
of an exceedingly hard texture. But when met with in clayey 
ground, it is of a reddish or light-brown-colour, shows a thinner and 
more extended stratum, and more readily suffers decomposition by 
exposure to the influence of the sun and air. The iron it contains 
becoming oxidized, causes it gradually to dissolve into an earthy 
powder. It varies from one to six inches in thickness, proves fre- 
quently injurious to vegetation, and being impenetrable by the roots 
of trees, forces them to push outward in a radial direction along its 
surface. There is great abundance of moss, which is scarcely used 
for fuel, except in the upland farms, and never as manure. By 
means of thorough draining, levelling, and top-dressing, Scraes- 
burgh moss, which was formerly a watery waste, has been reclaim- 
ed, and now produces luxuriant crops of grass. 

Zoology. — No rare species of birds is found here. We have the 
woodcock, fieldfare, curlew, plover, and kingfisher. The grounds 
are amply replenished with black-cock and grouse, as well as other 
kinds of game. For some seasons, the quantities were considera- 
bly diminished, chiefly in consequence of the depredations com- 
mitted by English poachers. But they were lately checked in their 
lawless practices by the spirited exertions of the Border Associa- 
tion for the protection of game ; for a banded number of about 
twenty of these bold sporting adventurers were unexpectedly ap- 
prehended, and subjected to punishment. 

Not a few animals, such as the hind, wild boar, and«others, have 
entirely disappeared, with the once extensive forests which afford- 
ed them subsistence and shelter. Here sheep of the Cheviot breed 
are reared with peculiar care. They are highly prized on account 
of their size, symmetry, wool, and other qualities, for which they 
are remarkable. In proof of this, it may be stated, that the besl

lot of rams exhibited before the annual meeting' of the Highland 
and Agricultural Society of Scotland, lately held at Kelso, procur- 
ed for its owner, residing at Swinside, the highest premium award- 
ed for stock of that particular class. 

All the streams abound with excellent trout. Also salmon have 
been taken from the Oxnam here, but by such persons chiefly as 
have recourse to the illicit expedient of fishing with spears by torch 
light. The crop of beans in 1833 was irretrievably damaged by 
the depredations of a dingy-coloured insect. These, settling in 
myriads on the stalks, pods, and leaves, either materially injured, 
or wholly extinguished the' principle of vegetation, and according- 
ly the result was a general failure. No means were employed for 
their destruction. The black caterpillar, after an interval of thirty 
years, again assailed the turnip crop last summer ; and, but for the 
very careful and expensive picking by the hand, would have entire- 
ly consumed it. But for many successive seasons, this kind of crop 
has been regularly invaded by insects of a different species. These 
fix upon the root commonly of the young plant, and the canker 
thereby produced, causes it to put forth new ones, bearing some 
fancied resemblance to fingers and toes ; and to this circumstance 
the disease owes its name. The plant when attacked either withers 
and dies, or else exists only in a decayed and mutilated state. No 
part of the parish is wholly exempted from its ravages ; but these 
are supposed to be materially checked and diminished by the un- 
sparing use of lime. It has been ascertained by repeated experi- 
ments, however, that neither liming copiously, nor yet soil entirely 
new, will completely prevent the pestilential inroads which it makes. 
This disease has hitherto, indeed, set at defiance the most skilful ef- 
forts, either to discover a remedy or to detect its cause. The 
ruta baga, or Swedish turnip, appears most effectually to resist its 
virulence, and is therefore cultivated to a much greater extent than 
it was formerly wont to be done. 

Botany.— As no new or unknown varieties of plants have been 
discovered in the parish, the names of such only as are more rare- 
y to be met with are here given : Drosera rotundifolia, round- 
leaved sun-dew ; Parnassia palustris, common grass of Parnas- 
sus ; Sedum villosum, hairy stonecrop; Saxifraga granulata, white 
meadow saxifrage ; Potentilla argentea, hoary cinquefoil ; Trifo- 
hum ochroleucum, sulphur-coloured trefoil; Polygonum amphibium, 
amphibious persicana ; Digitalis purpurea et alba, purple and white

XI. — Civil History. 
The manor of Oxenham was enjoyed by Gaufred de Percy 
when the abbey of Jedburgh was founded. He granted to the 
abbot two carucates of land, and two bovates, lying adjacent to 
the church, with common of pasture and common of fuel belong- 
ing to the village. This grant, and also the right to common 
pasture on the lands of Newbigging, were confirmed by Malcolm 
IV. and William the Lyon. The forfeiture of Sir Robert Colvill 
enabled David II. to grant the barony of Oxenham, with other 
lands, to Sir Duncan Wallace, and the Countess of Carrick, his 
spouse. This parish, set free by the Reformation from a rigorous 
ecclesiastical domination, acquired its independence. 

It may be mentioned, that the Rev. Thomas Boston, who re- 
linquished his parochial charge here, was the first pastor who pre- 
sided over a congregation of Relief Seceders in Jedburgh. Not 
a few of his former flock continued to attend on his public mini- 
strations in that place. 

Land-owners.— There are in all eight land-owners, whose de- 
signations, as arranged according to their valued-rents, are here 
given : The Most Noble the Marquis of Lothian ; His Grace the 
DukeofRoxburghe; Charles B. Scott, Esq. of Woll; William O. Ru- 
therford, Esq. of Edgerston ; John Scott, Esq. of Riccalton ; John 
Stavert, Esq. of Cunzierton ; Major Archibald Oliver of Bush ; 
and Mrs Isabella Scott of Fala. 

Registers.— It appears that the earliest insertion in the parochial 
register was in 1700, and that entries were regularly made during 
the subsequent ten years ; but that since that period it has been 

less accurately kept. 

Antiquities.— The ruins of an old chapel at Plenderleath may 
still be seen, but its cemetery has ceased to be occupied as a place 
of interment. There is a Druidical circle, sixteen yards in dia- 
meter, and occupying an elevated position, which remains pretty 
entire. At no great distance, there are the vestiges of another or 
larger dimensions, but in a less perfect state of preservation. The 
stones of which they are composed, being dark compact green- 
stone, interspersed with numerous and minute crystals of augite, 
mav therefore be identified with that prominent and corresponding- 
rock found in their neighbourhood. Several old camps, of a cir- 
cular form, are to be met with here. The one occupying the 



OXNAM. 259 

height southward of Bloodylaws is the most conspicuous and im- 
portant On the hill at Cunzierton, also, the outlines of a strong- 
ly fortified British station may be clearly traced. It consists of a 
large rampart, with double trenches surrounding the level area on 
the summit ; and about fifty yards lower, where the ascent is 
easiest, an additional mound of defence is likewise apparent. Be- 
sides, there are the remains of a Roman encampment most dis- 
tinctly visible upon a somewhat commanding eminence called Pen- 
nymuir. It is of a quadrangular figure, with slightly rounded cor- 
ners ; but it has this peculiarity of construction, that the vallum 
and fossa are carried outward at right angles on the east side, 
where the ground is dry and level, so as to include an additional 
oblong space of no small extent. The traverses covering the gates 
or entrances, as well as the ramparts and entrenchments, are still 
remarkably well defined, except only where the narrow extremity 
has been levelled by the plough, and where another portion of 
them has been converted into a turf fence. The beauty and com- 
pleteness of the camp are unhappily marred by these encroach- 
ments. Its superficial area is 32 acres. 

Close to this ancient encampment, near the two Druidical circles, and 
not far from the important fortification noticed above, there runs 
along the north-east boundary of the parish, for about six miles 
the great middle Roman road into North Britain, usually deno- 
minated the Watling Street. Where it is conducted over dry slop- 
ing ground, its originally raised and rounded appearance is still 
very entire. It is supposed to have been regularly paved, which 
seems to be confirmed by stones larger than the rest beino found 
inserted closely and in a continued line along the middle of it by 
the numbers protruding through the grass which covers its surface 
and by trie great quantity, of mixed sizes, observable where it passes 
over ground that is marshy or moist. It has been traced from 
Camden on the Frith of Forth, through the Lothians, Lauderdale, 
St Boswell s Green, and onward to Jedfoot bridge, the camp at 
Pennymmr, and Woden-Law; and then crossing the Border, it 
goes by Chevvgrecn Riechester, Corebridge, and near Halifax to 
Manchester, and from thence to Norwich, Chester, and Aber, 
where it joins the great southern branch of Wattling Street. 
Many pits are perceptible along both sides of this ancient cause- 
way, varying ,n their distances from each other, from which un- 
questionably the materials for its construction were taken. Some 
ol them containing water are overgrown with rushes ; while others

now almost obliterated, are covered with spongy sod, or a rich 
sward of grass. This spacious road, still kept open, is but little 
frequented except for driving cattle and sheep into England. 

This district, so long converted by the licentious borderers into 
the theatre of incessant feuds, reciprocal depredations, and vio- 
lent sanguinary conflicts, was once numerously interspersed with 
castellated edifices, or baronial forts. Of these the most distin- 
guished were Dolphiston, Mossburnford, and the Crag Tower. 
The first is plausibly conjectured to have been built by one Dol- 
phus, and to have received from him its name. It was held, for 
a considerable period, by the family of Anslie, who greatly singa- 
lized themselves in the border warfare. On the principal gateway 
were inscribed the words Radolph de Anslie. The walls, of which 
little more than the foundation remains, were from 8 to 10 feet 
in thickness, and had several vaulted apertures in the middle of 
them, originally intended either for concealment or repose ; but 
so large as to admit of their being ultimately converted by farmers 
into receptacles for ladders, and other agricultural implements. 
They were of such massive and durable construction, indeed, as 
rendered their demolition a matter of very difficult accomplish- 
ment.  A little to the south, there is a plot of grass twenty-two 
yards square, long unbroken by the plough or spade, which is al- 
leged to have formerly been furnished with a watch-tower. The 
next mentioned structure, though far inferior in strength, was 
nevertheless longer preserved entire ; for its being inhabited con- 
sists with the recollection of persons now alive. The site of the 
third was upon the eastern bank of the Oxnam, below the village, 
and was strongly fortified, both by nature, and by the skilful con- 
trivances of art. It was built on a bold rocky eminence, with pro- 
jecting battlements, and surrounded on three sides by water. In 
the interior, of it, there was a deeply-sunk pit, which is said to have 
communicated with the passing stream, from which its inmates 
and defenders, when closely besieged, could readily supply them- 
selves. It had, besides, a strong wall of defence on the accessible 

 A tradition is still current, that a fairy or brownij assisted the people there in 
thrashing their corn in olden times, and that in token of their gratitude for Ins se r- 
vices an article of dress was placed for his acceptance n the scene of his noctu. nal 
labours - but that he, hurt and offended at the very offer of remuneration ot any 
quitted the premises for ever, and on doing so, is said to have uttered Ins re-

side, which served to inclose a spacious outer court, and within which 
the cattle in the vicinity, being shut up, might be secured against 
those daring attempts at spoliation and rapine, commonly executed 
by freebooters under the cover of night. A few years only have 
elapsed since these remains of antiquity were nearly all removed, 
with a view to subserve and facilitate the purposes of modern im- 
provement ; and hence it may be truly said of these ancient but 
dilapidated fortalices, no less than of the mirthful festivities, the 
warlike preparations, and the boasted chivalrous exploits of which 
they were by turns the scene, that every vestige almost has alike 
passed away from the remembrance and the sight of man. 

One fact has been rescued from the general oblivion, however, 
connected with Henwood, in the immediate vicinity of the Crag 
Tower. Into its deep and impervious fastnesses, which covered 
extensively the western banks of the Oxnam and the grounds ad- 
jacent, the border chiefs, accompanied by their feudal and military 
retainers, were wont to betake themselves, when their dangers were 
pressing and great ; and hence an occurrence, exceedingly fre- 
quent and alarming, gave rise to the memorable war-cry,— a Hen- 
woody  which made one and all grow fierce, seize the readiest 
weapon, and hasten eagerly for protection to the forest, of all 
others the most safely commodious place, both as a rendezvous and 
refuge for the inhabitants. By this watch-word, too often the sig- 
nal for indiscriminate burning, devastation, and slaughter, no less 
than by the many ruins of a dignified but gloomy cast, with which 
this frontier parish abounded, we are sadly reminded of the trou- 
bles and rude habits so prevalent in that age; and are led for- 
cibly to contrast these with the growing civilization and peaceful 
occupations that characterize the present times. 

To the west of Henwood, there appears a rising ground called 
Gallala Know, which the voice of tradition declares to have been 
the place appropriated for the execution of criminals durino- the 
Border wars. It is now enclosed and planted with trees. There 
is likewise a seemingly artificial tumulus, beautifully situated in the 
bosom of a sort of natural amphitheatre hard by the Crag Tower. 
It is a place, which, in bygone times, might have probably been 
occupied for the public administration of justice to the lieges. 

An iron helmet, imbedded in the ground near Cappuck, was dis- 
covered about sixty years ago ; but we are unable to state into 
whose hands it has now fallen. Also, at Stotfield there was found 
lately a large sized and elegantly formed pot or kettle, of the kind 



262

used for culinary purposes by the Romans, during their frequent 
encampments. It seems to consist of an alloy of copper, bears 
marks of the mould in which it was cast, and is of a capacity to 
contain one and a-half gallon. It is at present in the possession 
of the parochial clergyman. Besides, a shilling of Robert Bruce 
and two sixpences of Queen Anne were found at Newbigging, and 
other relics of antiquity, which we forbear particularly to notice. 

III. — Population. 
The ancient population of this parish cannot be ascertained. 

But in 1755 the number was 760 
In 1801 it did not exceed 688 

And in 1831 it amounted only to 676, comprising 348 males and 328 females. 

This gradual decrease must be ascribed to the early junction of 
small farms, and to the subsequent monopoly of larger ones. At 
present, six large farms are held by non-resident tenants. The ef- 
fect of this system has been, not so much, indeed, to deteriorate the 
condition, as to reduce the number of inhabitants. Every village 
is abolished, owing to the removal of all dwellings not deemed ne- 
cessary for accommodating the families of tradesmen and farm-ser- 



vants.

Agriculture. — It is accurately estimated that 3480 acres are 
either cultivated or occasionally in tillage, and that 16990 acres, 
exclusive of plantations, remain unbroken and constantly in pas- 
ture. But it is evident from traces of the plough being still observ- 
able on many of the hilly grounds, that these must at a former 
period have been far more extensively under cultivation than at 
present. In the meantime, however, they cannot be made to un- 
dergo even occasional tillage with profit, and are kept, therefore, 
in permanent pasture.

Wood. — The quantity of natural wood is about 50 acres ; and 
that of old and young plantations is 600 acres. The latter consist 
of the common kinds of forest trees ; but in point of numbers the 
larch and Scotch fir greatly predominate. What were planted 
lately, in addition to those which have stood for several years, are 
regularly thinned, pruned, and under excellent management, and 
consequently they are all in a vigorous and thriving state. A few 
of the aged ash, elm, and other deciduous forest-trees of a large 
size still remain to attest, by their scattered and solitary appearance, 
the wide desolation produced by the hand of time. 

Rent.— The average rent of cultivated land is about 16s. 6d. 
per acre. The charge for the annual keep of a cow is L. 5, 10s. ; 
of a three year old, L. 4; of a two year old, L. 3, 7s. ; and of a one 
year old, L. 2, 10s., all without turnips, but including a little hay 
in spring. The charge per annum for a full-grown sheep of the 
Leicester breed is L. 1, and for a young one, 12s., both getting a 
proportion of turnips in spring, and being otherwise pastured for 
the rest of the year. A Cheviot ewe pastured for the year is 8s. 
and of a young sheep, with a few turnips, 5s. for the same pe- 
riod. 

Breeds of Stock.— The sheep are almost exclusively of the Che- 
viot breed; though, in some richer and more sheltered situations, 
the Leicester breed is preferred. The strictest attention has long 
been paid to the breeding and management of the former. Hence 
the method most commonly adopted for its improvement is this : 
a small number of the best and finest woolled ewes is selected 
from the general stock, to which valuable rams, sometimes pro- 
cured from the adjoining English counties, and sometimes pur- 
chased from, or exchanged with, a neighbouring farmer, are ad- 
mitted at the proper season; and from their produce, rams of the 
first and most approved quality are afterwards chosen. Some 
manage otherwise, for they buy Cheviot lambs, feed them upon 
turnips during winter, procure Leicester rams at the proper time, 
and at length dispose of the whole crop of half-bred lambs, and, 
subsequently, the ewes also, when ready for market. Others again 
adopt still different methods, according to circumstances. 

The kind of cattle most usually reared is that of the short-horn- 
ed breed. No small attention is generally paid to the improve- 
ment of it. The horses are of a moderate height, but powerful 
and active. 

Husbandry.— The five-shift rotation is now almost universally 



264 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



prevalent. The value of many farms has been much enhanced, 
by means of substantial fences, abundant draining, the liberal and 
extensive application of lime, and more lately of bone manure too, 
which contributes to unfold the energies of the soil in a wonderful 
manner. In some parts, no trivial advantage has likewise been 
gained by forming embankments, though only upon a limited scale. 
The duration of leases commonly extends to nineteen years, which 
is held to be truly beneficial, both for the landlord and the occu- 
pying tenant. It tends to enrich the estate of the former, just be- 
cause it admits of the latter being reimbursed for whatever expen- 
ses might be unavoidably incurred in effecting judicious and im- 
portant improvements. Most of the farm-buildings are commo- 
dious and handsome, and the state of enclosures is good. 

Eecent Improvements. — Large additional plantations, and like- 
wise numerous subdivisions and enclosures, have recently been form- 
ed, especially by the Marquis of Lothian, whose excellent and li- 
berally devised plans, when fully carried into execution, will great- 
ly contribute both to beautify and enrich his baronial estates in this 
quarter. Of late, fences of furze, or whin, have been extensively 
brought into use. They succeed admirably well on moorish or 
barren soils, where thorns would never grow ; and when properly 
dressed, besides being ornamental to the farm, are highly benefi- 
cial to the farmer. The roads running through the parish in vari- 
ous directions extend to about thirty miles. All the other roads, as 
well as the main line, which leads most directly from Kelso to the 
Carter, are kept in good repair. They are upheld by funds arising 
from the conversion of statute labour. The rate of assessment has 
seldom exceeded L. 1 for every hundred pounds Scots. It may 
be added, that the facilities of internal communication were happi- 
ly increased by means of three stone bridges lately built.

duce yearly raised in the parish, will be nearly as follows :

Oxnam to Jedburgh, the nearest market-town, is four miles. Near- 
ly the whole of the disposable produce is sold there, the rest being 
sold at Kelso or Hawick, where also there are weekly markets, of 
which one is ten and the other fourteen miles distant. A daily coach 

passes through it, and another runs 
from it to Edinburgh, and returns every alternate day. No fewer 
than ten persons, provided either with horses and carts, or donkeys, 
prosecute a sort of retail trade in bread, groceries, and other arti- 
cles. Numbers of the gipsy tribe frequent this neighbourhood, 
especially during the months of summer. As they are less liable 
to be molested on the Roman road than other places, there, accord- 
ingly, betwixt thirty and forty have been observed to encamp for 
days together. Besoms, wicker baskets, and earthen-ware, are 
what they usually offer for sale. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church was built in 1738, and is in a 
good state of repair, but is inconveniently situated for families dwel- 
ling in the more remote parts. To it belong four communion cups 
handsomely formed of silver, of which two were a donation from 
one individual, and two from another. Each pair has inscribed up- 
on it respectively the date of its presentation, and the name of the 
donor. The church is capable of accommodating 258 sitters. All 
the sittings are free, no pecuniary charge whatever having hither- 
to been made for them. 

The manse was rebuilt in 1831, on a more approved and ad- 
vantageous site. The extent of the glebe is from 12 to 13 acres 
and its yearly, value about L. 1, 4s. per acre. The amount of 
stipend, exclusive of L. 8, 9s. 8d. of vicarage teind tack-duty, is 
120 bolls  oatmeal ; and 87 quarters, 3 bushels, one-half quart 
barley.  

In general, divine service in the parish church is well attended 
About 120 may be the average number of communicants. Many 
of the population have been long connected with the different dis- 
senting congregations in Jedburgh. The sum of L. 9 may be the 
average amount of church collections annually for religious and 
charitable objects. The number of Dissenters varies every year 
as they are chiefly of the class of farm-servants, many of whom 
yearly change places. J 

Education.- the parish school, only the common branches of , 
education are taught. Forty may be the average number of scho- 
lars attending it. The salary of the schoolmaster is L. 25, 13s.

4d. and the amount of school-fees L. 12. He has the legal ac- 
commodation, somewhat more than an acre of land adjoining his 
house, and L. 4, 3s. 4d. of money, arising from a fund mortified 
by Lady Yester, as a remuneration and encouragement for teach- 
ing poor children. The fees are, for reading, 2s. per quarter ; 
for reading and writing, 2s. 6d. ; and for arithmetic, 3s., more be- 
ing charged, however, for the higher branches. There are none 
who cannot read, and few who cannot write likewise, at the age 
of seven years. The distance of several families from the parish 
school renders it extremely desirable that an additional one should 
be erected, and a suitable teacher appointed by the heritors. A 
library connected with the Sabbath school has been attended with 
great benefit. 

' Savings Bank.— The nearest Saving bank is at Jedburgh, and 
the persons by whom investments are generally made in it are 
tradesmen and farm-servants. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— One cottage, called the Alms- 
house, still remains, which Lady Yester, according to her letters 
of mortification dated 4th November 1630, and 14th March 1638, 
bequeathed for behoof of the poor. She likewise mortified L. 1000 
Scots, the annual rent of which, L. 4, 3s. 4d., beside the week- 
ly collections, is distributed in small proportions, among such 
indigent individuals as have not been permanently admitted to 
the benefit of an assessment. The average number of poor on 
the roll for the last ten years is 18, and the average allowance to 
each is L. 4, 8s. 8|d. per year. Such is the decrease in their 
number, however, that the sum allotted for their supply is at pre- 
sent one-third part less than it had been for a long period. The 
mode of regular assessment for the maintenance of the poor has 
been in operation here for a considerable number of years. It 
has had the effect, certainly, of lessening the shame and degrada- 
tion naturally experienced by needy applicants, and which atjirst 
were felt so strongly, as, in various instances, to prevent an appli- 
cation being made. As it is, however, a careful and judicious dis- 
tribution of the funds will best insure the satisfaction of all parties. 

TVs.—Two fairs are annually held at Pennymuir. One was 
established 15th October 1830, and the other in the month of 
August thereafter. The purpose of their establishment was the 
more convenient disposal of sheep and lambs, of which about 1400 
are presented for sale at each market. Also on the 25th day of 



OXNAM. 



267 



March, a tryst or market for hiring shepherds is held at the same 
place. 

Alehouse. — The only alehouse in the parish was lately built for 
the accommodation of persons attending these fairs. Being situ- 
ated in a remote and thinly peopled district, it proves less injuri- 
ous than it would otherwise do. 

Fuel — At a former period peat and turf, which were had in 
abundance, were the only fuel sought after. On some of the up- 
land farms they are still in use. But coal is now the fuel chiefly 
used here. That of the purest quality is procured from Tarret- 
burn, in the county of Northumberland. It is carried a distance 
of twenty-two miles, and is commonly sold at .10d. per cwt. No 
small quantity, besides, is brought from other Northumbrian col- 
lieries bordering on the east coast. But a somewhat higher price 
is demanded for it, owing especially to the distance being greater 
than to the southern pits. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The state of agriculture in this parish has greatly advanced 
since the publication of the former Statistical Account. Yet it is 
an indubitable fact, that a large proportion of the lands under til- 
lage would become still more productive, and also that the coarse 
and swampy pastures would be substantially improved, by draining 
them more thoroughly, and to a much greater extent. The more 
copious application of lime and bone manure to the soil would 
unquestionably enable the farmer to raise not only turnips, but 
every other kind of crop, in richer abundance. At the same time, 
it may be remarked, that the very fertile and highly cultivated 
grounds cannot, even under the present excellent system of hus- 
bandry, be brought to a state of much greater improvement. 
Where shelter is specially wanted, forest trees might, with signal 
advantage, be planted on an extended scale. A few years hence, 
the young thriving plantations, and the many enclosures furnished 
with hedgerows, will successfully impart a much more clothed and 
ornamented appearance to the district. 

It may be observed also, that the circumstance of so many of 
the farms being held by non-resident tenants, as well as the un- 
sparing suppression of cottages, has necessarily diminished the 
number of industrious and respectable inhabitants. However, very 
few of the working classes are wholly disabled for profitable exer- 
tion, either by disease or the infirmities of old age. The people 
generally lead sober and active lives, show a commendable atten

PRESBYTERY OF SELKIRK, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TEVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. G. J. HAMILTON, MINISTER  



I. Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, c.-The origin of the name of this parish 
is obviously Anglo-Saxon, and we find it, in the records of the 
twelfth century, spelt Ascliecliyre and Aschechirk ; and in more 
modern times, we find Askirk, and Ashkirk, the present name. 
From the large quantity of ash trees with which the parish 
abounded, a considerable number of which still surround the church- 
yard, there can be no doubt regarding the origin of the name. 
Two-thirds of the parish lie in Roxburgh, and the other in Sel- 
kirkshire. It is about 7 miles in length, and about 3| in breadth. 
It is bounded on the north by Selkirk, west by Yarrow, south by 
Roberton and Wilton, east by Minto and Lilliesleaf. 

Topographical Appearances.— This parish presents few features 
worthy of detail. It is entirely of a hilly character, though there 
are portions of level land on the banks of the Ale, in openings of 
the narrow valley through which that river flows. 

Climate.— The climate must be regarded as rather damp and 
cold, from the great prevalence of W. and S. W. winds, and that 
a part of the parish is peculiarly exposed to the E. N. E., and 
S. E. winds. But the climate has been much improved by the 
extent to which draining and plantations have been carried, and 
both might yet be very much extended, with great advantage to 
both landlords and tenants. The health of the inhabitants may be 
stated as being fully equal to that of the surrounding district There 
is a tombstone in the churchyard, bearing to be that a man of the 
name of Coltherd, and his wife, who both died at the advanced age of

one hundred and two. At present there are several persons above 
eighty, and there are two men in their ninety-second year. The chief 
diseases that prevail in the parish are, fevers, consumption, rheuma- 
tism, catarrh, and thatnow universal complaint, termed dyspepsia, or 
indigestion, which attacks all ages, sexes, and conditions. Con- 
cerning the causes of this wide spread malady, this is not the place 
to speculate. 

Meteorology. — There has been no accurate register of the wea- 
ther kept in the parish, even to shew the average range of the 
thermometer and barometer. But this is the less to be regretted, 
as there will be foundsome valuable tablesand observations, with the 
various prognostics of the weather, in the very full and able report 
of the parish of Yarrow, by the Rev. James Russell. And as the 
parishes of Ashkirk and Yarrow lie contiguous, and are therefore 
subject to the operation of the same causes that determine the 
state of the weather, the results obtained in the one parish will, 
with very slight modifications, apply to the other. 

Hydrography, Springs. — The greater number of the springs in 
the parish are perennial. Their general temperature is about 45°. 
Not a few of these springs are obviously impregnated with various 
mineral substances, and some of them are regarded by some of 
the inhabitants as possessing medicinal virtues, but none of them 
have ever been carefully analyzed. 

Lochs. — There were formerly a great many lochs in this 
parish, but now only those of Essenside, Sheilswood, Headshaw, 
and Ashkirk are of any considerable extent. The first is the 
joint property of the Earl of Minto, and of Archibald Coch- 
rane, Esq. of Ashkirk, measuring about 20 acres. The second 
and third belong to the Earl of Minto, and the last to Archi- 
bald Cochrane, Esq. of Ashkirk. All these lochs contain excel- 
lent marl, and some of them yield trout, perch, and pike. What 
is now called Synton moss was at one time a considerable 
lake, but has been completely drained, in order to obtain the 
marl and peat with which it abounds, both of which are of ex- 
cellent quality. There are four marl mosses on the estate of Syn- 
ton, which have all been drained by the present proprietor, the 

But would the dyspeptics of the age take an advice, which is here offered, with- 
out a fee, and which is, that they would find their stomachs very much relieved and 
improved by putting a great deal less in them. But there is not much g od to be 
expected by advice,— and the tiling will go on, unless some merciful Member of Par- 
h iment shall get the digestive organs placed under the same protection as the factory 
children,— viz. that they shall not be oppressed by their employers.

expense of which cost more than L. 400. One of these marl mos 
ses, called Stonyford, measures about 40 acres, with peat above, 
and under which there is a seam of excellent marl, from 10 to 11 
feet deep. Besides the lakes which have been drained for the ob- 
jects just mentioned, there must have been formerly a very large 
one on the farm of Whitslade, the property of George Pott, Esq. 
of Todrig, as a rocky barrier crosses the river Ale, a little to the 
east of that farm, which has been worn down by the action of the 
water, in the course of ages, to the depth of more than 100 feet, and 
is now called the Leap Linns. Above these linns, on the banks of 
the river, the large meadow, and other lands, that had formed the 
lowest portions of the bottom of the lake, are still remarkable for 
their richness and fertility. 

Rivers. — The only river is the Ale, which takes its rise from the 
lakes of Alemoor and Shaws, and runs nearly through the centre 
of the parish from west to east. This river abounds with excel- 
lent trout. But in summer it is in general too small for angling. 
A few sea trout and small salmon occasionally reach this length, 
at certain seasons of the year, after the river has been flooded. 

Geology and Mineralogy.— The general direction of the strati- 
fication of this parish lies from south-west to north-east. The 
rocks belong to the transition series, and consist almost entire- 
ly of greywacke with a basis of clay-slate. The general dip 
may be stated at 45°, though it varies in different places from the 
perpendicular to the horizontal. The stratification of the Leap 
Linns, already mentioned, the rocks cut through by the action of 
the water, seems to be nearly in a horizontal position. No lime- 
stone has yet been discovered in the parish. 

The skulls of various species of animals not now to be found, 
have been dug from the marl mosses. The writer of these pages 
has seen a large and beautiful specimen of the horns of the stag, 
in the possession of John C. Scott, Esq. of Synton, which was 
found imbedded in a marl moss, the property of the same gentle- 
man. The soil is in general light, from the decomposition of the 
rocks of which it is formed, but in some places the soil is of a clayey 
description mixed with gravel, and some of the haughs on the banks 
of the Ale are alluvial. Though there are good crops of various 
kinds, both green and white, raised in the parish ; yet, from the cha- 
racter of the soil, and the nature of the climate, neither can be re- 
garded as of the best quality. The pasture lands rear excellent 
Cheviot sheep, which yield wool of a fine quality. But the stock

on the farms in the upper part of the parish are subject to a dis- 
ease known by the name of " the louping-ill," which in a cold and 
barren spring often causes very severe loss both of ewes and lambs. 

Zoology. — That this parish was formerly inhabited by animals 
that have long since disappeared is proved by the best of all evi- 
dence, — the bones of the animals themselves found in various marl 
mosses. Besides the horns of the stag already mentioned, the 
horns of the urus were dug from the same moss. There are now 
no birds or animals that can be regarded as peculiar to the parish, 
but such as are common to the surrounding' district. There are 
still a few foxes, and plenty of hares, rabbits, black and red grouse, 
and partridges. 

Botany. — In the bog lands, the oj-chis may be found in many 
of its beautiful varieties ; and in moss lands the Eriophorum vagi- 
natum in great abundance, and the Trollius Europoeus are also 
to be seen in various meadow lands. The natural grasses found in 
this parish are the Scirpus ccespitosus ; it grows on thin mossy 
soil, mixed with heath, but as it soon fades, it is of no value for 
winter pasture. The Nardtis stricta and Aira ccerulea being 
short lived are also less valuable. But the Juncus squarrosus be- 
ing an evergreen, and a hardy perennial, is of considerable import- 
ance. But the most valuable spring grass for sheep is the Eri- 
ophorum vaginatum ; and Sesleria ccerulea, as it remains green 
during the spring months, is highly valuable; and the Juncus a cu- 
tiflorus is of great value, both for pasture and hay for cattle dur- 
ing the winter. 

That a great quantity and variety of natural wood, once existed 
in the parish is proved by the large quantity of decayed wood 
found in various mosses ; but both the quantity and variety of na- 
tural wood which now remain are inconsiderable. But, on a few 
estates, their place has been well supplied by large and thriving 
plantations. Archibald Cochrane, Esq. of Ashkirk, has planted 
upon his estate above 40 acres, consisting of the various species of 
fir, and with a proper mixture of ash, elm, and oak. And John C. 
Scott, Esq. of Synton, has planted upon his estate 230 acres, laid 
out with great judgment and taste, both for shelter and ornament; 
and, with the exception of a few old trees, around the house, the 
whole has been planted by the present spirited proprietor. There 
is a very fine old tree near the house, which measures 15£ feet in 
circumference ; and what is verv remarkable, there is an oak mea- 
sunng 5£ feet in circumference, which was planted by the hands of 



272 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



the present proprietor. — Charles B. Scott, Esq. of Woll, has about 
70 acres of very fine plantation, including the policy. There are 
two large and beautiful hollies, near the house, the one measuring 
at one foot from the ground, and at five feet from the ground, 6 feet 
in circumference. The other measures at one foot from the ground 
5g feet in circumference, and at eight feet from the ground, 5 feet 
in circumference. The policy has been much improved, 'jand the 
wood judiciously thinned by the present proprietor, which has ad- 
ded much to the natural beauty of the commanding situation on 
which the house stands. There are about thirty acres of plantation 
on North Synton, the property of Robert Pringle, Esq. of Clifton ; 
and on Drydean, the property of the Earl of Minto, about six acres ; 
and on Burnfoot, the property of Elliot Lockhart, Esq. of Borth- 
wickbrae, there are from 8 to 10 acres, which in all makeof planta- 
tion in the parish about 386 acres. 

II. — Civil History. 

There are no ancient records or MSS. that refer solely to this 
parish, but it is frequently mentioned in general descriptions of the 
county, one of which, a very able article, was furnished to the Edin- 
burgh Encyclopaedia, by Mr William Laidlaw, author of Lucy's 
Flittin and many valuable essays. 

Land-owners. — The land-owners in the parish are, in the order 
of their valuation as follows : John C. Scott, Esq. of Synton ; The 
Earl of Minto ; Archibald Cochrane, Esq. of Ashkirk ; Elliot 
Lockhart, Esq. of Borthwickbrae ; Charles B. Scott, Esq. of 
Woll ; Robert Pringle, Esq. of Clifton ; George Pott, Esq. of 
Todrig; Mark Sprot, Esq. of Riddell. 

Parochial Registers. — There are some very old and curious en- 
tries in the registers of this parish, but unfortunately the books 
are far from being entire. In looking over the registers, you may 
find them for a few years here and there pretty regularly kept, but, 
upon the whole, they are still far from tGin s.n Rcc1.1r3.tG record 
of what they were intended to preserve. 

Historical Events. — The greater portion of the parish at one 
time formed part of the see of Glasgow. The Bishop of Glasgow 
had a palace, which stood on a field now forming part of the 
present glebe-lands. Some old men in the parish remember to 
have seen part of the walls, and the field at this day retains the 
name of Palace Walls ; and the greater number of the present 
proprietors still hold of the College of Glasgow. 

Eminent Characters.— -It is a curious fact that at one time al--

most the whole parish belonged to gentlemen of the name of Scott. 
In the following lines from Satchel's poems, we find almost all the 
properties in the parish mentioned by name. 

" And John of Middlestead together came ; 

Robert of Huntly he did not fail, 

He came with the Scoits of the Water of Ail; 

So did Walter of Todrig that well could ride.

Kirkhouse and Askirk went in their room ; 

Because it was my Lord's decree, 

But younger brethern they all should be." 

In the Lyon Office of Scotland, there are some curious and in- 
teresting particulars of the Scotts of this parish, many of whom 
were celebrated in the border wars of the time. It is stated in the 
pedigrees compiled by Dr William Scott, that a younger son of 
the then Baron of Buccleuch 1288 named John, was sent to St 
Mungo's, Glasgow, for his education, being lame, and hence unfit 
for the then border service. Walter, the grandson of the said 
John, became a chamberlain to the then Archbishop of Glasgow, 
who had a large interest in the parish, as we have already seen, and 
recommended him to his cousin of Buccleuch, when the said Wal - 
ter, acting for the bishop in the capacity just mentioned, settled at 
Burnfoot, on the water of Ale. This Walter, called by the cant 
name of Watt the Ratton, from his fellness and activity, married 
a daughter of Mr Shortread, of Headshaw, by whom he had four 
sons ; the eldest, George, his heir, of Synton ; the second, Scott of 
Headshaw; the third, Scott of Glack ; and thefourth, Scott of Ash- 
kirk in Roxburghshire. 

It is recorded by the same authority, that George, the seventh 
from Buccleuch, and fifth of Synton, married a daughter of Thomas 
Scott of Roberton, in Roxburghshire, by whom he had two sons 
Walter and William; Walter, the "eldest, was designed of Synton- 
and William, the younger, of Harden. It is from this William 
Scott of Harden that the present Scott of Gala, Selkirkshire, 
Scott of Woll, Scott of Synton, Scott of Raeburn, &amp;c. are de- 
scended.-f-

John Scott, the last of Whitslade, sold that estate, which then 
consisted of Whitslade, Castleside, the Readforgreens, Ashkirk, 
Ashkirk-mill, Salanside, Bradley, &amp;c. only about the year 1722. 
And Thomas Scott, the last of Todrig, who had been a brave 
warrior, both by sea and land, only sold Todrig in 1748, hav- 
ing sold the estate of Wester Essenside a few years before. He 
died in 1753, and was buried at Ashkirk in an isle now removed. 
His arms were cut in wood on his seat in the old church, bearing 
the date 1622. It will be seen from the list of land-owners al- 
ready given, that Synton and Woll are the only properties that 
now remain in the possession of the illustrious name of Scott. 

The details now given may be regarded by some of the mere 
utilitarians of the age, as fit only to amuse the idle hours of the 
antiquary, but they will appear in a different light to the philoso- 
pher and historian, who are anxious to unfold the laws that regu- 
late the distribution of wealth and property among the great fa- 
mily of mankind. 

Antiquities and Traditions. — Besides the ruins of the Palace 
of the Bishop of Glasgow, already mentioned, there are two Dan- 
ish encampments on the farm of Castleside, — the one entire, but 
the other much effaced by the plough. There was formerly a 
very strong tower or keep on the lands of Salanside, but now the 
ruins are scarcely visible. There are also in various other places 
vestiges of encampments, but their origin cannot be very accurate- 
ly ascertained.

1 smith, and a respectable farrier. The number of agricultural 
labourers has not been accurately ascertained. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture arid Rural Economy. — Land cultivated, 2804 acres. 
The number of acres of pasture land has not been ascertained. 
Land capable of cultivation with a profitable application of capital, 
inconsiderable. Land planted about 386 acres. 

Rent of Land.— The average rent of arable land in the parish 
is from 14s. to 15s. per acre ; for grazing, per cow, L. 4, for win- 
tering L. 1, 10s. ; of pasturing from 5s. to 6s. per sheep. The rental 
of the parish is about L. 4479, 7s. 

Wages.— Farm-servants with families, have in lieu of board, 3 
loads of meal, the produce of a cow, and a certain quantity of po- 
tatoes planted. The average wages of such servants is from L. 9 
to L. 1 0. Shepherds have for wages the keeping of forty-five sheep. 
The yearly wages of female servants vary from L.5 to L.7, exclu- 
sive of board. The artisans of the parish, such as masons, carpen- 
ters, and smiths, make, per day, from 2s. to 2s. 4d.; common labour- 
ers, such as roadmen, from Is. 8d. to 2s. 

-Prices.— The average price of wool and sheep from 1826 to 
1831 inclusive, has been accurately ascertained, which is as fol- 
lows : Cheviot wool laid with tar and butter, per stone of 24 lbs. 
English, I0s.7d.; ditto laid with turpentine, 14s. 2d.; ditto pure white 
17s. Id.; stock wethers hogs unclipt, 12s. 9d.; ditto ewe hogs unclipt, 
14s. 2d.; ewe hogs sold atraarket, lis. 3d.; top wether lambs, 6s. 
6d. ; second ewe and wether lambs, 5s. 3d. ; draft ewes, 12s. 8d. ; 
wethers unclipt, 19s. 9d.; wethers for turnip feeding, L.l, 0s. 6d.' 

Breeds of Live-Stock.— The Cheviot is now the only'breed of 
sheep in the parish ; the black-faced have entirely disappeared. 
On a few farms the Cheviot ewes are crossed with the Leicester 
breed, and produce what are termed half-bred lambs, which yield 
a much higher price than Cheviot lambs; but this advantage is 
gamed with many drawbacks of another description, which render 
the ultimate results doubtful, except on a few farms peculiarly si- 
tuated. The present breed of cattle in the parish is what is term- 
ed theshort-horned, being found upon the whole to be the most 
profitable. A few Highland cattle are wintered in the parish, on 
larms that have a sufficient command of bog hay. " The dairy is in 
a great measure supplanted by the rearing of young cattle, but 
what butter is made in the parish is of the very best quality,— our 
housewives being great adepts in this department.

Husbandry and Produce. — The quantity of land under cultivation 
in this parish must at one time have been very great, as traces of the 
plough are still visible upon hills now covered with heath. That 
any extent of this land could be reclaimed to yield a profit is very 
doubtful, from the great distance and consequent very high price 
of lime. Draining has been carried to a considerable extent, and 
might be yet farther extended with advantage. The average re- 
turn of white crops in the parish may be stated from 4 to 5 bolls 
per English acre; cultivated hay, 150 stones of 22 lb. per acre; 
turnips L. 4 per acre ; and potatoes L. 8. The land in the parish 
is in general very well farmed, both the four and five shift rotation 
being in practice. 

The length of leases may be stated from nine to fifteen years ; 
very few nineteen. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Means of Communication.— There is no market or post-office in 
the parish, the distance from Selkirk being five, and from Hawick six 
miles. There are a few houses at Ashkirk, but nothing that de- 
serves the name of a village. There are two stone and one wooden 
bridge across the Ale within the limits of the parish, all of which 
are in good repair, with the exception of the one on the Edinburgh 
road, which is a great deal too narrow. The parochial roads are but 
indifferently kept, though the expense to both landlord and tenant 
is very considerable. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The present church was built in 1791, is 
in good repair, and is seated for 202 persons, allowing 18 inches 
to each person. The seats are all free. The church is conveni- 
ently situated, being nearly in the centre of the parish. The pre- 
sent manse was built in 1784. Some additions have since been 
made, and it is at present comfortable and commodious. It stands 
on an eminence, fronting the south, and commands a fine view of 
a beautiful opening of the valley, through which the river Ale runs. 
The glebe consists of nearly 14 acres, worth about L. 1, 10s. per 
acre. The glebe has been greatly improved by the present in- 
cumbent, being judiciously subdivided by hedges, with small plots 
of trees, at the corners of each field. The stipend is 14 chalders, 
consisting of meal and barley, the average of which in money 
for the last seven years is L.216, 6s.; allowance for communion 
elements, L. 8, 6s. 8d. It deserves to be here mentioned, that the 
heritors of the parish, with a generosity which does them great ho- 
nour, allow the assistant clergyman L. 30 per annum, and haVfe

done so for the last five years during- h e severe indisposition of 
the present incumbent. Divine service is in general well attend- 
ed, and the deportment of the congregation highly decorous. The 
Karl of Minto is patron of the parish. 

The number of families in the parish attending the chapels of 
Dissenters or Seceders is 25. 

Education and Literature.— There is only one parochial school. 
The branches taught are, reading, writing, arithmetic, geometry, 
land-surveying and mensuration. The average number of scholars 
may be stated at 40. The schoolmaster's salary is L. 30, and the 
average amount of fees may be stated at from L. 16 to L. 17 per 
annum. He has a garden consisting of 1 rood 28 poles imperial 
measure. 

There is a large and handsome new school-house nearly ready 
for being opened, measuring 31 by 20 feet within the walls. 

Libraries.— There is a very well managed parocbial library, con - 
taining a very good selection of books ; and James Douglas, Esq 
of Cavers, with a beneficence as honourable to him as beneficial 
to the parish, has sent a large number of volumes, which, after be- 
ing read, he withdraws, and replaces by others. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The poor are chiefly supported by 
legal assessments, which amount from L. 48 to L.56 per annum. 
The number of paupers upon the roll at present is 8, and three 
families receive temporary supply. It does not appear that pau- 
perism has been on the increase for a considerable number of years, 
from the data which the register affords; but the direct tendency 
of the system of assessments is to weaken the ties of kindred, to 
lower the moral tone of the people, to relax industry, and to 'di- 
minish independence, unless met by powerful checks, from the pe- 
culiar situation of the parish. The yearly average collections at 
church amount to L. 6, 18s. 3d. 

Inns.— There are no inns in the parish, and the character of the 
inhabitants may be regarded as sober and industrious. 

Fuel— The principal fuel used in the parish is peat and coal. 
But coal, being distant more than thirty miles, can never be rated 
under 1 s. 3d. per cwt. ; and often it is much higher, which makes the 
expense of coal so great as to place that article beyond the reach 
of the poor. But not only this parish, but the whole surrounding 
district, suffer the pressure of this great evil, which admits of no 
effectual cure, but a rail-road through the Carter Fell.

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Since the date of the last Statistical Account of this parish, the 
condition of the people has been highly improved in three essen- 
tial elements of human happiness. The great mass of the inhabi- 
tants are better fed, clad, and educated, than their fathers were at 
the period to which we have referred. Farming is much better 
understood and practised in every department ; a much larger quan- 
tity of produce is raised from the same surface ; and the breeding 
and management of stock have been carried to a high state of per- 
fection. Both the new farm-houses and cottages have in gene- 
ral been improved, in accommodation and in comfort. And the 
new offices that have been built, are more ample and convenient. 
But, with all these great improvements, still much remains to be 
done. Draining might be farther extended with great advantage, 
and, were landlords to afford their tenants liberal assistance in lim- 
ing various parts of the parish, the crops would be much earlier, 
safer, and more productive. 

And on the stock farms, in the higher parts of the parish, there 
is a great want of plantation for shelter. The writer of these re- 
marks is not unaware, that there are farmers who demur to this spe- 
cies of shelter as inducing sheep to too much repose and inactivi- 
ty in seeking food ; but the objection has the misfortune of being 
directly opposed to some of the best established physical condi- 
tions, on which the health and productiveness of ruminating ani- 
mals are known to depend.

PRESBYTERY OF JEDBURGH, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TEVIOTDALK. 

THE REV. ARCHIBALD CRAIG, MINISTER. 



I- — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The name of the parish, as well as that of the stream 
near which it is situated, appears to be of Gaelic origin. From 
the modern spelling, one might be led to suppose that the village 
is so called, from its being in the hollow or what once formed the 
channel of the river. But neither the position of the village, nor 
the old spelling, will warrant this conclusion. It was formerly writ- 
ten Bedderull, Bedderoull, and Badroull, and the inhabitants still 
pronounce it as if written Betherull. Rule, or more properly Roull, 
is composed of two Gaelic words, and has no reference to orconnec- 
tion with St Regulus-Ruchd-Thuil, pronounced as if written Much- 

oul, contracted into Roidl, signifying the rumbling-noised river, a 

meaning very descriptive of the stream, which, especially near the 
village, and till near its conHuence with the Teviot, runs with a 
hoarse sound, over a very rough rocky channel composed of boul- 
ders and fragments of freestone rock, loosened by the action of the 
stream, through a long course of ages. Bad in Gaelic signifies a tuft 
of trees of ordinary extent, separated from a large neighbouring wood, 
or a collection of houses in a spot distinguished by its aptitude for 
building, compared with the surrounding localities, a meaning pe- 
culiarly applicable to the situation both of the old and new villages. 
Thus the whole word will be Bad-ruchail, pronounced by a true 
Celt very nearly as the vulgar Betherull The true orthography 
then seems to be Badroull, as it is found in the ancient distich, 

" And Auld Badroull had on his Jack, 
"Wi' a' the Turnbulls at his back." 

And the name of the village in Gaelic means the village by the 
roaring stream. 

Extent, Boundaries.— The parish of Bedrule is situated nearly 
in the centre of Roxburghshire. It is bounded on the east by the

cu etutor ot the Gaelic Dictionary.

parish of Jedburgh ; on the south by Abbotrule, now annexed to 
the parishes of Southdean and Hobkirk ; on the west, by Hob- 
kirk and Cavers, from which it is for the most part separated by 
the Rule ; on the north-west and north, by Minto and Ancrum, 
from which it is separated by the Teviot. It is somewhat of an 
oval figure, — in length, from north to south, upwards of 4 miles; 
in breadth, from east to west, between 2 and 3 ; and 'it contains 
about 6 square miles. 

It consists of nearly equal proportions of arable and pasture land, 
— a great part of the latter being moor-land, producing an excellent 
kind of heath, on which the sheep seem to thrive. The soil varies 
according to the difference of situation and climate, as happens in 
all cases, where there is a sudden transition from hill to dale. The 
lands that lie near the Teviot and the Rule are generally com- 
posed of a rich sandy loam, over a gravelly substratum, and some 
small portions of clayey soil. These lands are well adapted for 
wheat and turnip. As you recede from the streams above-men- 
tioned towards Bedrule hill and the Dunian, the soil becomes ge- 
nerally thinner and more sterile, with a retentive clayey subsoil, 
and in many places very spongy, requiring much draining; and few 
lands can be more favourably situated for that important opera- 
tion, as they generally slope towards the streams above-mentioned. 
For except a few fields of haugh land, there is not a level field 
in the whole parish. 

Mineralogy. — The hills surrounding the village are, like almost 
all the other hills of the south of Scotland, of the transition forma- 
tion, and consist of greywacke. In the bed of the river Rule, 
there are excellent specimens of sandstone, horizontally disposed, 
of a reddish colour, and apparently belonging to the floetz forma- 
tion. Some fine specimens of this sandstone may be seen about 
a quarter of a mile below the village. The new cut made for 
the Rule, immediately adjoining the manse, also displays the same 
rock, and along the right bank of the stream, below the manse 
about a mile, there are some quarries, in which the stratum has 
been dug to a considerable extent, and whence it is sent for build- 
ing and ornamental purposes to different parts of the country. In 
the last quarry, the stratum of superincumbent earth is of great 
thickness, and the sandstone, which immediately succeeds to the 
alluvial deposit, seems to consist of a bed which is of great depth. 
The poet Leyden has noticed the occurrence of sandstone in the

course of the river as one of its most remarkable characteristics 
and as geological science was little attended to at the time he wrote 
his beautiful poem, the fact of his giving it so prominent a place 
in his description, may be considered as an evidence at once of the 
accuracy of the poet's observation, and of the circumstance having 
at all times formed one of its most 'characteristic features. 

If any of the proprietors thought it worth their while to bore, 
it is likely that coal might be found in the course of the river. At 
all events, it is. worth trying for. Attempts were made about forty 
years ago by the proprietor of the lands of Bedrule, who was at 
considerable expense in boring for coal, and though there were cer- 
tainly some thin seams found, yet in the issue he was not so suc- 
cessful as his laudable enterprize justly merited. The failure, as is 
still thought, was not owing to the uncertainty of the symptoms, 
but to the great deepness of the main seam. Limestone is found 
in Bedrule hill, and Mr Pringle, the late tenant of Bedrule farm, 
opened a quarry, and constructed a kiln, from which he not only 
supplied his own farm with lime, but sold a considerable quantity 
to the neighbouring tenants. Mr Brodie, the present tenant, has 
not continued the practice, and considers the limestone of an in- 
ferior quality. The distance and consequent high price of coal 
must always prove a great impediment to undertakings of the kind 
in this parish. 

Climate.— The climate in this parish varies considerably, as 
might be expected from its variety of elevation. The tempera- 
ture of the higher parts, consisting of a range of hills, beginning 
at the Dunian on the east, and extending nearly the whole breadth 
of the parish, varies considerably from that of the lower grounds 
lying near the banks of the Teviot and the Rule; and while the 
former are white with snow, scarcely a particle will be found in the 
latter ; so that we have, as it were, two climates in the same pa- 
rish. Upon the whole, the climate is damp and vaporous, especi- 
ally on the banks of the two streams. A dense and impenetrable 
fog frequently arises from the Rule, especially in the autumnal 
and winter months, and can be distinctly traced, till it joins a 
larger exhalation arising from the Teviot, at its confluence with 
that stream. Ruberslaw frequently attracts the lightning, and a 
thunder-storm in its neighbourhood is a very grand and magnifi-

cent object. A striking proof of the great humidity of the at- 
mosphere, is the tendency which trees and bushes have to be co- 
vered with moss, when they have stood a year or two in the ground. 

Zoology.— This parish is well stocked with the game usual in si- 
milar localities. The rooks and wood-pigeons are, by their num- 
bers and voracity, very destructive to the fields and gardens. There 
is a heronry on the estate of Wells, in the immediate neighbour- 
hood of the parish. These birds build their nests in tall trees, and 
are preserved with great care, as a thing rare in this part of the 
country. They are great enemies to the angler, by the destruc- 
tion which they make among the trouts. Among the rarer birds 
may be mentioned the most beautiful of all British birds, the hal- 
cyon or kingfisher, on the banks of the Rule ; the cross-bill Lox- 
ia curvirostra. The golden-crested wren occurs, but it is very 
rare. 

Insects. — Of the almost innumerable tribes of the insect race, 
it would be impossible to give any adequate account, even if the 
writer were sufficiently conversant with the subject to manage the 
task. But it is deserving of notice, that he observed last season, 
in the vicinity of the manse, a species of butterfly, which has hither- 
to been supposed to be confined to England, namely the brimstone 
butterfly Gonepteryx Rhamni. The hitherto supposed absence 
ofthisbea.utiful species from Scotland has been plausibly ascribed 
to the great rarity of the plant Bhamnus catharticus, on which the 
caterpillar feeds. The insect occurs in abundance, as far north as 
York, and specimens are occasionally seen not much to the south of 
the border ; but this seems to be the first instance of its having been 
observed in Scotland. The turnip saw-fly  Atha.Ua spinarum 
appeared in the parish last summer, and did some injury, although 
not by any means to the same extent as in some of the adjoining 

districts. . 

Botany.— The few plants worthy of notice in the parish are the 
following: Pyrola minor, woods about Wells; Fedia dentata, Ci- 
chorium Intybus, meadows on the banks of the Rule, occasional, 
probably introduced; Epipactis latifolia, Euonymus Europceus, 
SaniculaEuropaa,Sanguisorbaofficinali S Valeriana dioica. There 
is a considerable extent of natural wood, consisting of birch, alder, 
hazel, wild-cherry, common and mountain ash. The oak and all 
kinds' of fir seem to thrive well in this parish, especially the spruce. 
On the estate of Wells, in the immediate neighbourhood, there 
are some splendid specimens of spruce and oak; but the old 



BEDRULE.

avenue to the mansion-house affords perhaps the most magnificent 
specimens of the lime to be found in this country. 

Hills.— -The highest hill in the parish is the Dunian, at the 
south-east extremity of the parish, where it joins the parish of 
Jedburgh. It is a round flattish-topped hill, containing about 300 
acres. It is 1031 feet above the level of the sea, and is seen at 
a great distance, especially towards the north-east ; and as there is 
no intervening height between it and the sea, it is seen from the 
utmost boundary of the coast in that direction, and at sea serves 
as a land-mark for mariners. The name is of Gaelic origin, and 
signifies the hill of John, or St John's hill. 

II. — Civil History. 
Antiquities.— There are the distinct vestiges of an encampment 
on the farm of Newton, not far from the high-road between Jed- 
burgh and Hawick. It lies on a sloping piece of ground in New- 
ton moor, surrounded, on all sides but one, with running water. 
It is of a peculiar form, neither round nor square, but a kind of 
oval ; and must have been very secure. The fossa on the north 
side is pretty entire, about 12 feet in height, and seemingly as wide 
at the top, narrowing toward the bottom. I am rather inclined to 
think it is Roman, especially as there was, till lately, a Roman en- 
campment about a mile distant, in a field called Stirk-rigo-, which 
is now totally defaced with the plough. The circumference of the 
one first mentioned is supposed to be 200 paces, the diameter 68 
paces. A pendicle with the ditch continued on the south side 
and joined to the west, but a little disjoined to the east, was found 
to be 127 paces round. This pendicle, when united with the larger 
gives the form of an oblong square to the whole. 

There is, almost a quarter of a mile northward from this camp 
a pond, commonly called Newton pond, now used as a dam for col- 
lecting water from the neighbouring heights ; from which it is 
conducted to Newton farm, to drive a thrashing-mill. It is how 
ever chiefly supplied from a perennial spring of excellent water 
which issues from a sandy bottom in several small jets, on the south 
marg.n of the pond. This well is called Lady's well, or Our Lady's 
wel The dike is strongly built, and bears marks of antiquity; 
and the tradition in the country, that it was constructed by the 
monks of Jedburgh, as a fish pond, intimates a fact that seems 
to be highly probable. 

The only remains of the old castle of the Turnbulls of Bedrule 



284 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



are the foundations of several buildings, which occupy a consider- 
able space of ground. They are situated on the right bank of the 
Rule, on an eminence, at a small distance from the church. The 
dike which separates them from the ploughed land on the east, con- 
tains some hewn and ornamental stones, which, there is every rea- 
son to conclude, formed a part of the ancient castle. About a 
furlong to the north-west of the ruins, on the other side of the 
Rule, which washes one side of it, is a mound partly artificial and 
partly natural, called Fastcastle, and seems to have been an out- 
work to the main building. It is of considerable height and com- 
pass, and must have been once surrounded with water, and, as its 
name imports, must have been very strong. Though this mound is 
now in the parish of Cavers, it seems, from its vicinity to, and con- 
nexion with, the Castle of Bedrule, to deserve a place in this ac- 
count. 

From the site of the castle of Bedrule, the prospect of the sur- 
rounding country is very extensive, exhibiting a combination of 
mountain and glen scarcely to be equalled. Among these objects, 
Ruberslaw, and the magnificent woods of Wells, containing about 
fifteen miles of walks, form a very prominent part of the picture. 

At Fulton, once a separate village and farm, but now united to 
Bedrule, there is a considerable ruin of one of those strongholds 
called Border Peels. There are three side walls pretty entire, and 
of great thickness and solidity. The building is about the usual 
size, of a square form, with loop-holes in the wall, for the discharge 
of arrows. 

Historical Notices.— The earliest account of this parish is to 
be found quoted by Chalmers in his Caledonia, where he says that 
Randolph, eldest son of Dunegal of Stranith, Nithsdale, a Gaelic 
chief in the reign of David L, possessed a large share of his father's 
land, and, as the head of the family, was superior of the whole. 

 There is a tradition in the country, that the last person who inhabited this Peel 
was one of Ine TurnbuUs, between whom and the Kers of Fermhirst there was a 
I a dlv feud A band of the latter came to seize Turnbul, and having got access by 
Shinto the tower, came upon him, who, never dreaming of such a visit, was 
holdLg Hs SaS child on his knee, while the gudewife prepared the n«n. for sup- 
uer. and amusing it by singing the old Scotch ballad, 
r ' Little wat ye wha's coming,

ThP Kers rushing in upon him, exclaimed, " Little wat ye wha's coming  ndeea ; 

Eds of his enemies, the writer ha-s not been able to learn. 



BEDRULE. 285 

Randolph married Bethoc, the heiress of some lands in Teviotdale. 

The descendants from this marriage assumed, in the thirteenth 
century, the surname of Randolph. Sir Thomas Randolph, after- 
wards Earl of Murray, was the great grandson.  We find a 
charter granting the lands of Bedrule, called Bethocrule, to James 
Douglas, who is styled Militi dilecto et fideli nostro— by Robert I. 
But the charter being mutilated, the date and witnesses' names 
do not appear. -f- 

The family of the Turnbulls, famous for their predatory habits 
in ancient times, produced a man no less illustrious as a scholar 
than as a benefactor to his country. This was William Turnbull, 
son of Turnbull of Bedrule. He was first a prebendary of Glas- 
gow, afterwards Doctor of Laws, and Archdeacon of St Andrew's, 
in the bounds of Lothian a Privy- Counsellor, and keeper of the 
privy-seal. He is styled William de Turnbull Dno Prebendae pri- 
vati sigilh custodi anno 1441.+ When Bishop Bruce was trans- 
lated from Dunkeld to Glasgow 1447, Turnbull was elected Bishop 
of Dunkeld j but Bruce dying in the same year, Turnbull was then 
elected Bishop of Glasgow, and consecrated in the month of April 
1448. r 

This bishop says Keith was a person of an excellent charac- 
ter. In 1452 or 1453, he procured a bull from Pope Nicholas V. 
for erecting a College for literature within the city of Glasgow • 
after the complete settlement of which noble monument of his 
care for the cultivation of learning, he took a journey to Rome, 
where he died 3d September 1454.§ 

Rewcastle, or as it is written in old records, Roughechester 
Rewlcastle, or Rouchcastle, is said to be a place of great antiqui- 
ty. The castle has vanished, and even the site can hardly be dis- 
tinguished— etiam periere ruince. There is a tradition that the 
courts of Justice were originally held there, and afterwards remov- 
ed to Jedburgh. The farm-house is substantial, being lately 
erected ; but the rest of the houses are in a very ruinous condi- 
tion. Under the tasteful and active management, however, of the

present proprietor, George Pott, Esq. of Dod, we may expect soon 
to see a great improvement on this farm. He has already com' 
menced erecting stables, forming part of a plan of new offices, 
which, in point of elegance and accommodation, are of a very 
superior kind. The situation of Rewcastle commands the view 
of one of the most extensive and varied landscapes in the country. 
In this landscape, you have the vale of the Teviot from Hawick 
almost to the Tweed, bounded' on N.W. and N. by Eildon Hills, 
the Lammermoor Hills, Home Castle and the fertile plains of 
the Merse ; and on the south and west by the giant height of 
Ruberslaw, and the range of hills which stretch to the Etterick 
and Yarrow. There are few places in this county capable of 
more improvement, and in the hands of -the present spirited pro- 
prietor much may be expected. This property formed a part of 
the estate of Knowsouth, long in the possession of the ancient fa- 
mily of the Rutherfords of Knowsouth. But shortly after the 
death of the late Captain Rutherford, the estate was sold by his 
heirs to the present proprietors. 

Knowsouth. — William O. Rutherfurd, Esq. of Edgerston, and 
Sheriff of the county of Roxburgh, is now the proprietor of Know- 
south, having purchased it from Charles Scott, Esq. one of the 
heirs of the late Captain Rutherford. Mr Rutherfurd has been 
at great expense in building a very elegant villa, and in making 
other improvements on a similar scale. The house is of that style 
of architecture which is known by the name of the Elizabethan 
style, of which we have other specimens in the neighbourhood. It 
is, however, more ornamented than any I have seen, and the situation, 
that of the old mansion-house, being admirably adapted for this 
style of building, and well surrounded with wood, gives a grand and 
imposing appearance, as seen from the high road between Kelso 
and Hawick, which passes near it. Nor does it lose much from a 
nearer inspection. There are few more delicious spots than Know- 
south, and a more appropriate style of architecture than that 
adopted by Mr Rutherfurd can scarcely be imagined. There are 
two magnificent elms at a little distance from the house, which de- 
serve particular notice, not so much from their size, which is very 
considerable, as from their wide spreading and numerous branches, 
which extend in every direction from the parent trunk. One of them 
measures 12 feet3inchesin circumference, the other 1 1 feet3 inches. 
They seem to have been coeval with the old mansion-house, and 
to have been pollards, which may account for the great number of

branches all springing out near one another. They must at least 
be a century old. 

Newton. — This village, in point of size and importance, is next 
to Bedrule. The estate of Newton formerly belonged to a family of 
the name of Ker, cadets of the family of Fernihirst. There was a 
house of strength there, which is now demolished. The foundations 
of the old mansion-house, with the venerable avenue of trees, still 
bespeak the taste and grandeur of the olden times. It was lately in 
the possession of William Ogilvie, Esq. of Chesters, who sold it to 
the present proprietors, Thomas and John Scott, Esqs. The com- 
munion cups of Bedrule church were a present from Ker of New- 
ton and his lady, according to the inscription on each of them, 
bearing date 1716. Newton now forms but one farm, though it 
was divided into two in the memory of persons still living. But 
Stirkrigg, the name of the other farm, is not now discernible, the 
farm-house and all its appendages have passed away, and the plough 
has obliterated all vestiges of the place where it stood. 

Proprietors and Tenants.— Sir William Francis Eliott, Bart, of 
Stobs and Wells, is the chief heritor, being the proprietor of Bed- 
rule and Fulton. Besides Sir William, there are four considerable 
proprietors, and four smaller ones. None of the heritors are resi- 
dent, except George Bell, Esq. of Menslaws, who farms his own 
property with great skill and success. 

Parochial Register.— The registration of births, deaths, and mar- 
riages, seems to have been kept much better at an early period, than 
at present. The Session Records of this parish go back as far as 
about 1660; but the precise date cannot be ascertained, as the leaves 
at the beginning have been mutilated. This book, both for 
its singular form and penmanship, and the minuteness and accu- 
racy with which every public transaction both of ministers and el- 
ders, is recorded, both on Sundays and on week-days, is a valu- 
able relique of the olden times. It is of a narrow oblong form, be- 
ing a folio doubled lengthways, like a merchant's day-book. The 
paper is coarse, and so closely written that every inch of it is oc- 
cupied. It is to be regretted that many pages at the commence- 
ment and in some other places are so worn and defaced as to be 
illegible. The registration of births has been very irregularly keptfor 
many years past, and though the present incumbent has repeatedly ' 
and earnestly impressed the propriety and duty of parents enrolling

the names of their children born in the parish, he cannot boast of

Clergy. — Mr Joseph Tennent is mentioned in an old record of 
presbytery, as minister of Bedrule, as far back as 1606, and seems 
to have been one of the first incumbents after the Reformation. 
He lived till about 1631. He also held, for a considerable time, 
the living of Abbotrule, the cure of which he likewise served till 
about 1621 ; when it was disjoined from Bedrule, and Mr James 
Ker, laird of the Grange, an estate in Abbotrule, was ordained 
there, and was the first Protestant minister of that parish after its 
disjunction from Bedrule. Mr Tennent was succeeded by Mr Da- 
vid Fowlis, who was admitted 30th October 1633, by the Bishop 
of Caithness,  and presbytery of Jedburgh. Mr Fowlis was soon 
after translated to Oxnam, which in those times seems to have been 
considered as one of the most valuable livings in the south of Scot- 
land ; and Mr Henry Peirson succeeded him in the benefice of 
Bedrule. But the Covenanters soon after gaining the ascendancy, 
both these gentlemen were removed from their churches, for their 
attachment to Episcopacy. 

Mr Henry Elliot was the Presbyterian minister who succeeded 
Mr Peirson, and was admitted by the presbytery of Jedburgh, as- 
sisted by commissioners, from the neighbouring presbyteries of 
Selkirk, Kelso, and Erselton; and died about 1653. The church 
of Bedrule was kept vacant, in those contentious times, for the 
space of five years. Mr Hugh Scott was ordained here 17 th 
March 1658. He did not continue long minister; for on the re- 
establishment of Episcopacy, he was removed from his church for 
nonconformity. Mr James Adamson, minister of Carriden, was 
preferred to the living of Bedrule, 7th September 1664, and con- 
tinued minister here during the reigns of Charles and James, and 
seems to have died about the time of the Revolution. He was 
succeeded by Mr James Borland in 1690, who was the first mi- 
nister settled here after Presbyterianism was re-established. From 
his epitaph, written in respectable Latin, we learn that he met 
with a good deal of opposition from the Episcopalians in the pa- 
rish — " qui juvenis veritatis viam per varios casus et praelatis ipsum 
persequentibus invictus tenuit."-f- Mr Borland was succeeded by 
Mr John Gilchrist in 1714, who in 1748 was succeeded by Mr 

 Dr John Abernethy, then Bishop of Caithness, and minister of Jedburgh. He 
was the author of a work, entitled A Christian and Heavenly Treatise, containing 
Physic for the Soul.

George Dickson, whom the late Mr William Brown succeeded 
in 1788, and died 23d May 1836,— having been minister of Bed- 
rule for the long space of forty-eight years. The present incum- 
bent was appointed assistant and successor to the late Mr Brown 
in 1832. 

The late Mr Brown was a man of considerable talents and 
literature. Previously to his being ordained a minister, he taught 
as an usher in an academy in France, and in one in the neighbour- 
hood of London, besides being some time a teacher in Watson's 
Hospital at Edinburgh ; and was tutor in the family of Sir John 
Stewart of Allanbank at the time he was presented by the late 
Joseph Hume, Esq. of Ninewells, to the church and parish of 
Bedrule. He published an edition of the New Testament, with 
short explanatory notes, and marks to guide the learner in pro-

nunciation. It is a very useful book, and might be very advan- 
tageously introduced into public schools. 

Suppression of Churches. — The suppression of the parish and 
church of Abbotrule, said to have been formerly a pendicle of 
Bedrule, and the uniting it to the already too extensive parishes of 
Southdean and Hobkirk, was a most unjustifiable transaction, to 
use no harsher term, and hurtful both to the religious and moral 
improvement of the people, and withal a most impolitic step. It 
is grievous to think of the many suicidal acts of this nature, which 
many presbyteries throughout the Church of Scotland committed 
during last century. Neither of the leading parties of the church 
are blameless in this matter; for they seem to have vied with one 
another in this absurd conduct, however much they differed in other 
things. In country parishes, the writer firmly believes, that this 
suppression and annexation of parishes, and, along with the sup- 
pression of the church, the suppression also of the parish schools, 
as in the case before us, has been one of the most fertile causes 
of dissent. The church is now reaping the bitter fruits of these 
misdeeds, in the bold and menacing attitude which a huge body 
of Dissenters in this country have now taken against our Establish- 
ment. It is to be regretted that the Church Extension Committee 
have, in all their laborious statistical investigations, never thought 
of devoting their attention to this subject. An investigation into 
all the suppressed parishes and churches in Scotland during last 
century, would lead to many discoveries, most important at this 
critical position of our national church. It would show how much 
the spirit of sectarianism has been promoted in many parts of the 
country from this single cause. It would show how much the pea- 
santry in the districts of the suppressed parishes had suffered, — 
not only from their greater distance from their new parish church, 
but from the distance of the school being such as to prevent the 
greater part of their children from attending it, for one-half of the 
year. 

III. — Population. 
The population of this parish, by the return to Dr Webster in 
1775, was 297 souls. In 1793, the number was about 259. At 
present, according to a census made by the author, the number is 
257, of whom 116 are males, and 141 females. In 1832, the 
population amounted to 300 and upwards, — since which time there 
has been a remarkable decrease. The decrease may be account- 
ed for by the decay of cot-houses, and the tendency of late to

convert arable into pasture lands, which require fewer hands. In 
the farm of Rewcastle, there were in 1832, 39 inhabitants, whereas 
at present there are only 21. 

There are in the parish under 10 years of age, - 78 

from 1 0 to 20 - - 64 

20 to 50 - - 86 

50 to 60 - . J 4 

60 to 70 - . 11

Almost the whole population is engaged in agriculture. There 
are two stocking-weavers, and one smith, but neither tailor, shoe- 
maker, nor joiner in the whole parish. These must be sought at 
Denholm or Jedburgh ; — the former, two, — the latter, three miles 
and a-half from the village of Bedrule. What can be better want- 
ed, we have neither alehouse nor whisky-shop. 

The inhabitants in general, as in most pastoral districts, are sim- 
ple in their manners, and temperate in their habits, and pretty re- 
gular in their attendance on divine ordinances. The late excite- 
ment with regard to politics has even reached this retired spot, 
and has done much to unsettle their calm and peaceful habits, and 
sour their dispositions. But it is to be hoped that this excitement 
will soon pass away, as there are already symptoms of melioration 
in this respect, and that the sound sense and deep religious feel- 
ing, for which the peasantry of this country have been so long dis- 
tinguished, will regain their wonted sway over their minds. It has 
been remarked to the author, and confirmed by his own experi- 
ence, that there is less gaiety and cheerfulness among the labouring 
classes than in former times, and that the song of the milk-maid, 
and the whistling of the ploughman, which were so common in this 
land of poetry and song — are now seldom heard. This most in- 
nocent and heart-cheering amusement, every lover of his kind — 
every one who takes a deep interest in the happiness of the rural 
population, the nerves and sinews of a country — cannot but wish 
to see revived, and that those sweet pastoral songs, with all their in- 
teresting associations, may again be heard — cheering the labours of 
the field, delighting the listening ear, and awakening in the mind 
the most pleasing emotions. 

The improvement which has lately taken place, generally through- 
out the country, in habits of neatness and cleanliness, is very con- 
spicuous in this parish. Not only are the houses of the farm-ser- 
vants more substantial and commodious, but the furniture is of a 
superior kind to what was usual in former times. There are few 



292 



ItOXBURGHSHIRE. 



cottages in the parish where you will not find a handsome eight- 
day clock, standing beside a very neatly arranged Link of crockery 
ware. Two cottages belonging to George Bell, Esq. of Menslaws, 
deserve particular notice, for their superior accommodation and 
comfort. Either of them would have been considered a very com- 
fortable farm house, fifty or a hundred years ago. The floor of one 
of them surpasses, in one respect, any thing of the kind perhaps 
in the whole county. It is made of a compost of lime and gravel ; 
and for hardness and smoothness, and appearance, equals any co- 
vered with flags, and will last, if properly taken care of, as this 
seems to be, longer than one laid with freestone flags. 

The dress of the peasantry is neat and becoming. The plaid 
or maud of the borders, consisting of black and white, or blue and 
white checks, is almost universal among the men, and they arrange 
it with a good deal of taste. The dress of the female peasantry is 
very neat and showy — in many cases too gaudy and expensive for 
their station. The straw bonnet, of various shapes and hues, is 
very general. 

IV. — Industry. 

Rental. — The valued rent is L. 3475, 13s. 4d. Scots. The real 
rent cannot easily be ascertained, as there is a considerable portion 
of the estates farmed by the proprietors. One tenant pays above 
L. 900 Sterling, another L. 610, another L. 405, and one farm, 
that was farmed by the present proprietor previously to his pur- 
chasing it, was let at about L. 350. 

Farming. — The system of farming is generally what is called 
the four or five year shift, according to the following order, adopted 
by Mr Brodie of Bedrule, which may be considered as the standard, 
not only in this parish, but through a great proportion of the county. 
First year, fallow or turnip ; second year, wheat after plain fal- 
low ; third and fourth years, grass ; fifth year, oats. There is a 
variation after turnip in the second year, when barley or oats take 
the place of wheat, which is only sown in a fine season. Some- 
times, beans are sown instead of the second year's grass ; but they 
are not much cultivated in this parish. Mr Bell of Menslaws 
adopts what is rather unusual beside the four year shift, a rotation 
of seven years, and may be called the seven year shift, according 
to the following order : first year, oats from lea ; second year, 
beans; third year, wheat; fourth year, turnips; fifth year, barley ; 
sixth year, grass ; seventh year, grass. That this rotation is well 



BEDRULE. 



293 



adapted to the soil of Menslaws, there is the best of all proofs, the 
production of excellent crops. 

Manure. — In addition to dung and compost, bone-dust has been 
introduced to a considerable extent, and its beneficial effects have 
been, as elsewhere, strikingly exhibited. Lime is used to a great 
extent, and as there is none now prepared in the parish, it is 
brought from a great distance, either from Northumberland or Lid- 
desdale. Lord Douglas has lately erected some lime-kilns on the 
north side of the Carter, for the supply of his own tenants, and it 
is to be hoped, that they will be opened to the public also, which, 
on account of the proximity to this and some of the neighbouring 
parishes, would be conferring a great benefit. 

Sheep. — The number of sheep in the parish is about 110 score ; 
they are almost all of the Cheviot breed. Mr Jerdon, the tenant of 
Rewcastle, of a stock of 30 score, hasgenerally a considerable num- 
ber of his ewes put to Leicester tups, and the produce are half- 
bred lambs. Mr Bell of Menslaws has thirteen Merinos from 
the royal flock of Spain. He has had them only for a short time, 
but expects they will succeed in a dry soil. They are rather smal- 
ler than the Cheviot breed, and their wool not nearly so white, 
having a brownish tinge, and being in smaller quantity than in the 
native sheep. There are no black-faced sheep reared here, 
although the pasture seems well adapted for them. The sheep 
walks in this parish are, in a great measure, composed of heath, 
which, although it does not grow to the height and thickness 
of stem found in other parts of the country, is of an excellent 
quality, and when in blossom has a beautiful and luxuriant ap- 
pearance. The sheep thrive remarkably upon it, and are sel- 
dom tainted with disease. It requires great attention and ma- 
nagement by burning it down at certain seasons. The practice 
adopted, and found by experience to succeed best, is to burn it 
every four or five years. 

Cattle. — The kind of cattle is what is called the short-horned 
breed, of a middling size, colour generally red or white, and a 
mixture of these colours. Mr Brodie generally purchases about 
thirty Highland cattle or Kyloes yearly, which being kept about 
a year are sold in the month of September. Most of the farmers 
feed a few cattle for the butcher, some of which may rank in 
quality with those which are reared by the best breeders in the 
country. 



KoXUURGIlSHIIii:. 



Wages. — The wages of a common labourer, without victuals, are 
Is. 8d. in winter, and 2s. in summer. A gardener receives Is. 6d. 
per diem, with his victuals, and a dram after the labours of the 
day are finished. A joiner receives 2s. 6d. and a mason 3s. a day. 
The gains of a farm-servant, or hind, consist of the following 
items in money and victual; L. 3 Sterling, 5 bolls of oat -meal, 
280 pounds to the boll, barley, 10 firlots or 15 bushels, pease 4 
firlots, 1200 or 1400 yards of potatoes planted; a cow's main- 
tenance summer and winter ; allowed to keep six hens, or 10s. 
in lieu ; also a pig ; for house and plot of garden ground, the 
hind must furnish a shearer during harvest ; the driving of five 
or six single horse cart load of coals, for which he pays prime cost 
at the pit. He has, besides, a month's victuals during harvest, 
whether engaged in the reaping department or otherwise. 

The gains of a shepherd, as might reasonably be expected, are 
greatly above those of a hind, but fluctuate with the value of stock, 
which constitutes a chief part of his gains. Shepherds have in some 
instances thirty sheep, and are allowed to keep a cow, and one or 
more pigs — besides a certain quantity of potato ground. Some 
shepherds, who are industrious and economical, realize conside- 
rable property, and there are instances, in the neighbourhood, of 
their being able to take an extensive farm. 

Gardens and Orchards. — There are good kitchen gardens in 
the parish, and a considerable quantity of fruit raised; but the cli- 
mate does not suit the production of the finer kinds of fruit. Ap- 
ple trees thrive better than pear trees, and plums better than 
either,— especially that small yet most valuable plum, called Dam- 
son. There is an orchard consisting of several acres of ground at 
Knowsouth ;  but the trees are old, and many of them decayed, 
and do not appear to be productive. There are also the remains 
of an orchard at Newton. 

Arable Land and Produce. — The number of arable acres in the 
parish is 1600. The average quantity of grain raised per acre is 
five bolls. Of these 1600 acres of arable land, one-fifth is regu- 
larly cropped with turnips and potatoes, with the exception of a 
small part in plain fallow. Of the grain raised, about three-fourths 
are consumed in the parish. The number of acres sown with turnips 
is about twenty-five, the average value of which per acre is nearly 

 Since this account was put to press, the greater part of Knowsouth, containing 
the elegant mansion mentioned above, has been purchased by George Pott, Esq. of 
£ 0 j ; Rewcastle and Knowsouth being thus, again united under one proprietor.

L. 5 Sterling. About twenty acres are planted with potatoes, 
which produce yearly about 800 bolls, most of which are consum- 
ed at home. A portion of both meadow and cultivated hay is rais- 
ed; but the writer has not been able to ascertain the quantity, or 
any thing like .an approximation to it. All that is raised is con- 
sumed on the different farms. 

The quantity of wool grown in the parish is about 400 stones 
annually. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Villages and Country Seats. — There is no village of any consi- 
derable size in the parish. Bedrule itself, once a populous place, 
has now dwindled away to little more than a farm onstead. The 
houses in the village were all lately built, and being covered with slate, 
have, from their situation, a very neat and cheerful appearance. 
The farm-house of Mr Brodie is partly new, and is very commo- 
dious, and from its site, which has been chosen with great taste, 
it has a very imposing appearance, and commands a wide prospect 
of scenery in a high degree beautiful and magnificent. 

Church.— The present church was erected about thirty-four years 
ago. It is built on the site of the old one, and though not so long, is 
considerably broader, and is capable of holding about 140 indivi- 
duals. It is situated on the top of the bank, having a pretty steep 
ascent from the level of the stream, and has a commanding view 
of the surrounding country. What is rather uncommon, the bel- 
fry is on the eastern gable of the building, and has an awkward 
appearance. Sir W. F. Eliott, Bart, chief heritor, got a plan drawn 
out of a proposed improvement, with an elegant spire on the west 
end for a belfry and clock, and Gothic windows instead of the pre- 
sent ones. This plan, if carried into effect, would render the church 
one of the most beautiful and picturesque of country churches. 
The expense would not be great, as the finest freestone in the 
country could be got from Sir William's quarry in the neigh- 
bourhood. It would also add to the accommodation, by converting 
both the present passages into seat room, and affording the conve- 
nience of a vestry, which in all country churches at any conside- 
rable distance from the manse, is of great importance both to the 
comfort and health of minister and elders. 

Manse.— The manse was built, according to a date affixed to the 
lintel of the kitchen window, in 1794, and is a very substantial and 
commodious house, without any of the gaudv ornaments of some 
lately erected manses. The great objection' to it is the too great 



296

number of windows, which lay a tax on the minister disproportion- 
ed to his stipend. Half the number of windows would have been 
sufficient ; but it was built when clergymen paid no window-tax. 

Of the 46 families in the parish, 25 attend the parish church, 
and 21 belong to Dissenting congregations of different denomi- 
nations. There is no dissenting place of worship in the parish ; 
but those who frequent such places go to Jedburgh. 

School — The school-house was built a few years ago, and both 
it and the schoolmaster's dwelling-house are very substantial and 
commodious. The schoolmaster's salary is L. 26 Sterling, with 
the usual quantity of garden ground, and six days darg of turf. 
The number of pupils attending this school, in former times, used 
to be much greater than now ; but, owing to the decrease of the 
inhabitants in the village and neighbourhood and other causes, the 
number has much decreased. The branches taught are, reading, 
writing, arithmetic, and book-keeping. The Bible is the general 
class-book, and the Assembly's Shorter Catechism regularly 
taught. Some of the more advanced pupils read Barrie's Collec- 
tion. 

Poor.— These are supported by assessment fixed by the heri- 
tors at their meetings, held twice yearly for this purpose. The al- 
lowance to paupers is generally between 2s. and 3s. weekly. In 
some urgent cases, more is allowed; but 3s. may be considered as 
the average. There are but four on the list at present, so that the 
poor's rates of the parish are very trifling. Indeed, there are few 
parishes in Scotland where public burdens in general, as they are 
denominated, are so light. Five hundred merks were mortified to 
the poor of the barony of Bedrule 1695, by William Ramsay m 
Bedrule mill, and Margaret Turnbull his wife ; of which the 
family of Cavers Carre are left trustees. Mrs Mary Anne 
Stevenson, relict of the Rev. James Borland, formerly mention- 
ed sunk L. 100 Scots to the poor of this parish, of which, accord- 
ing to the account in the parish records, the session appear to have 
been appointed by her as the overseers. Of the interest of these 
gums, mortified by pious individuals, the poor of this parish have 
received nothing for several years, and the writer has not been 
able to gain any satisfactory account of what became of the deeds 
of mortification. 

General Remarks. . 
A few years ago, there was a great spirit of emigration in this 
parish, as in most other parishes in the neighbourhood. But, since 



BED11ULE. 



297 



the year 1834, a year fatal to thousands of emigrants from this 
country, who fell victims to cholera soon after their landing in 
Canada, the fever of emigration has in a great measure sub- 
sided. 

The inhabitants of this parish and of the neighbouring parishes 
have several striking peculiarities of dialect. For instance, instead 
of me and he, they pronounce these words as if written mei and 
hei; instead of tree, they say trei; and three, tkrei, which is pre- 
cisely the German drei, by the substitution of tk instead of d. 
They pronounce the Scotch twa, with a peculiar drawl, making it 
a dissyllable, as if written tweak ; and brae they make break. All 
these sounds are rather pleasant to the ear ; but their pronuncia- 
tion of the initial k in some words is harsh, and cacophonous in no 
ordinary degree. Thus the proper name Hope, signifying a par- 
ticular kind of glen, they pronounce as if written wkupp ; and 
hole, as if whull ; horn as if whurn. These peculiarities, as far as 
the author has been able to ascertain, are confined to the higher 
districts of Roxburghshire. It might afford a curious subject of 
inquiry how this peculiarity of sounding the initial h originated, 
and how far it might serve to throw light on the Aeolic Digam- 
ma, a subject which has so long divided and perplexed scholars 
" et adhuc sub judice lis est." These peculiarities of dialect are, 
of course, generally confined to the lower ranks of the people,— al- 
though, such is the effect of habit and imitation, you hear some- 
times people, from whose education and rank you might augur 
differently, utter the same harsh and barbarous sounds.

PRESBYTERY OF KELSO, SYNOD OF MERSF AND TEVIOTDALB. 

THE REV. J. M. MACCULLOCH, A. M. MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — Kelso, formerly written Kellsowe, and at still more re- 
mote periods, Calchow and Calkow, is supposed to owe its name 
to the cliff on which part of the town stands. The name Calkow is 
composed of two words, — the Celtic calch or cealc, chalk, and the 
Anglo- Saxon ho or how, a height : and as the cliff referred to con- 
tains gypsum and other calcareous earths, the appellation Calk- 
how Scottice Cauk-heugh is far from inappropriate. The hard 
and soft sounds of ch being interchangeable, the original pronun- 
ciation KalAow would readily slide into the softened Kalc/iow ; 
while the further transition of Kalc/iow into KalsAow, and thence 
into Kelsow and Kelso is easily accounted for by the itsus enunci- 
andi of the Scottish border. Up to this day, the illiterate part of 
the rural population give soft ch its French sound, and pronounce 
cheap, cheat, &amp;c. as if the orthography was sheap, sheat. 

Topographical Features. — In shape, the parish is nearly trian- 
gular ; its greatest length is about 5 miles, its greatest breadth 
about 3. It is divided into two nearly equal parts by the River 
Tweed, which intersects it in a north-easterly direction, for about 
three miles : and as the parish stretches longitudinally in a direc- 
tion at right angles to the river, so as to form a transverse section 
of the vale of the Tweed, its topographical features necessarily em- 
brace both dale and upland, and exhibit the varied character inse- 
parable from the scenery of a wide and beautifully-diversified val- 
ley. In the northern division, the country gradually rises from the 

 Kelso is not tbe only name in the parish which exhibits traces of the successive 
possession of this part of Scotland by the Britons and Saxons. Tweed, the name of 
the principal river, is the Cambro- British Tuedd, the border of a country. The old 
Saxon Lleaw, or law, a hill, enters into the name of not less than five heights in the 
parish viz. Brox-taw, Galla-taw, Sharpit-tow, Spy-faw, Soft-fe. One place, Woo-dcn, 
has the Saxon dean as its affix ; another, Muse-rig has the Saxon rig. There is no trace 
of Scandinavian names ; but the Norman vill appears in Maxwell, which was origi- 
nally written MaccusfiZZ, and named from Maccus, the proprietor of the parish ol 
Maxwell, in the timeof King David I.

river's edge, in a series of undulating' ridges nearly parallel to each 
other and to the river ; while, in the southern, the general slope of 
the ground, which also gradually rises as it recedes from the Tweed, 
is modified both by the precipitous character of the river-banks and 
by the valley on the west, through which the Teviot pours its tri- 
butary waters into the Tweed. Viewed from the distant heights 
of Stitchell and Hume, Kelso appears to occupy a level surface 
at the bottom of a wide and richly-wooded strath ; but when seen 
in bird's-eye view from the vicinity of the river, it presents the ap- 
pearance of an amphitheatre, varied as well in its physical outlines 
as in its artificial adornments, — intersected by two broad and noble 
rivers, and having for its boundary a circle of wooded heights. 

Situation of Town. — The town is situate on the north bank of 
the Tweed, nearly opposite to the point where the Teviot falls 
into it; and consequently forms the centre of this amphitheatre. 
Nor is it unworthy of its environs; Like other towns lying on the 
banks of rivers, its principal street, following the line of the river, 
is tortuous and irregular, but it can boast of a square of no incon- 
siderable size, and some architectural pretensions. And its houses 
throughout being generally built of a light-coloured stone and 
roofed with blue slate, impart to the place an elegant and city-like 
air, which preserves its title to the description given of it by Pat- 
ten so long ago as the time of Edward VI., as « a pretty market- 
town." 

Scenery.— The picturesque beauty of the scenery about Kelso 
is too well known to render any description necessary here. It be- 
longs, indeed, to the class of the beautiful rather than the roman- 
tic ; and its pleasing effect is due, not so much to the command- 
ing character of any single object, as to the blending, combination, 
and harmony of the whole. Yet it may be questioned if Scotland 
contains a spot superior to it in its own style of beauty, or richer in 
subjects for the portfolio of the artist. 

" Bosom'd in woods where mighty rivers run, 
Kelso's fair vale expands before the sun ; 
Its rising downs in vernal beauty swell, 
And, fringed with hazel, winds each flowery dell : 
Green spangled plains to dimpling lawns succeed, 
And Temp6 rises on the banks of Tweed : 
Blue o'er the river Kelso's shadow lies 
And copse-clad isles amid the water rise." 

It ought to be added, that the charm of a locality, thus beauti-

ful in itself, is in no small degree enhanced by the historical and 
legendary associations which are connected with it, — a circum- 
stance of which no stronger proof need be adduced than Sir Wal- 
ter Scott's testimony, that to this very scenery, amidst which he 
spent the latter period of his boyhood, he could trace the awak- 
ening within himself of that " love of natural scenery, more espe- 
cially when combined with ancient ruins or remains of our fathers' 
piety or splendour," which was in him " an insatiable passion," 
and imparted so peculiar a colour to his subsequent pursuits and 
compositions. Every one has not, like Sir Walter, either a poe- 
tical temperament, or a memory stored with those treasures of bor- 
der lore necessary to render the gray ruin and the « storied" mea- 
dow suggestive of the past ; but the portions of border history or 
tradition, which the rocks, and ruins, and streams about Kelso 
recall, are fortunately too familiar not to place within the reach 
of most men the pleasure derivable from contemplating the lo- 
cality in connection with its associated circumstances; whilst the 
visitor, whose associations take the direction of devotion rather 
than of poetry, will find here ample food for that enviable habit of 
mind, which, by connecting the idea of Deity with all the objects 
and aspects of nature, causes the landscape to become tributary, 
not only to the imagination, but to piety. 

Climate.— Though, upon the whole, mild and genial, the climate 
of Kelso is scarcely so salubrious as might be expected from the 
latitude of the place, its elevation, exposure, and distance from the 
sea. In common with all parishes which lie on the banks of a large 
river, and in the trough of a valley bounded by hills, it is subject 
to more than an average share of humidity. Hoar-frost is preva- 
lent during the winter months ; and, at almost all seasons, a con- 
siderable portion of imperfectly dissolved vesicular vapour may be 
seen floating in the form of a thin mist over the bed and m the vi- 
cinity of the river. The prevailing winds are those from the west, 
which often sweep with great violence down the vale of the Tweed ; 
but easterly winds are also common, especially in the spring 
months, when the blighting easterly haar is by no means an unire- 

quent visitor. . 

In point of climate, however, Kelso has undergone, in the course 

of a century, a great and beneficial change. At one period, all 

the meadow-lands in the vicinity were filled w.th pools and 

marshes; and even in the memory of many persons still living, 

the beautiful meadow, to the north-east of the town, which is 



KELSO. 



301 



now used as a race-course, formed the favourite resort of a colony of 
sea-mews and wild-ducks, which regularly returned in the brood- 
ing season to its reeds and flags, and supplied by their eggs an 
article of considerable profit to the children of the poor. The 
last of these morasses has now disappeared under the ameliorating 
processes of draining and tillage ; and intermittent fever, which 
was for centuries the scourge of the district, has departed with it. 

Unfortunately no meteorological registers exist, of sufficient du- 
ration and accuracy to furnish data for determining the mean 
range either of temperature or of humidity ; but the general mild- 
ness of the climate is sufficiently vouched by various well ascer- 
tained facts. Not only have grapes, as the black Hamburgh and 
white sweet-water kind, ripened in the open air, during an occa- 
sional hot summer, and polyanthuses, primroses, laurustines, &amp;c. 
been frequently in full blow during the winter' months ; but va- 
rious rare plants have stood the winter, and bloomed abundantly 
in the open air for many years ; among which may be specified 
the Agapanthus umbellatus blue African lily, Euromocarpus sca- 
bra, Passiflora ccerulea, Glycinea Sinensis, Fuchsia coccinea, conica, 
gracilis, Thomsonia and virgata, as also most of the new varieties 
of Chinese roses. 

Rivers. — The only rivers are the two already referred to, the 
Tweed and the Teviot, — their tributaries in the parish being but 
inconsiderable burns, which serve only to diversify the scenery at 
the point of influx into the principal streams. The Tweed is here 
about 440 feet in width ; and the Teviot 200 feet ; though the 
latter, in consequence of being diverted to form a mill-lead, is some- 
what shorn of its fair proportions at the -very point, that of its 
confluence with the Tweed,— -where the lover of scenery can worst 
spare its full freight of waters. Neither of these rivers, if we ex- 
cept occasional pools or wheels, as they are locally designated, is, 
in ordinary circumstances, of any considerable depth or velocity. 
But from the length of their course, and the number of mountain- 
streams which fall into them, they are subject to frequent and 
sudden floods. Sometimes both are flooded simultaneously, and 
unite in one turbid and headlong stream, « rolling red from bank 
to brae." At other times, the Te.viot, which is of the two the more 
liable to floods, is seen after its confluence with the Tweed, carry- 
ing down its body of dense and discoloured waters on one side of 
their common channel ; whilst the waters of the Tweed, as if un- 
willing to combine with it, flow along -on the opposite side, pellu-

cid and untroubled. The highest flood of which there is any re- 
cord took place in February 1831. On that occasion, the Tweed 
rose with a rapidity and to a height wholly unprecedented. The 
whole of the lower part of the valley had the appearance of a sea; 
corn and cattle were swept before the torrent ; and many of the 
houses on the haugh lands adjoining the river were filled with water. 

One result of the occasional floods of the Tweed and Teviot is 
much to be deplored. Immediately below the point where these 
rivers unite, and opposite the most prominent part of the town of 
Kelso, is an islet or anna, which at no very remote period was so 
verdant and richly wooded as to look like a basket of foliage in 
the middle of the stream, and to form, from its position, a centre 
to some of the finest scenery of the place. This islet has been 
severed into disjointed portions as well as robbed of its wood by 
tbe floods ; and though several attempts have been made to defend 
it by bulwarks of stone, &amp;e. yet hitherto these expedients have 
proved wholly abortive. Nor have the inhabitants any other pros- 
pect than that of seeing the last of its trees laid prostrate, and 
the remaining vestiges of its sward and soil swept down to aug- 
ment the fertile land of their neighbours of the lower Merse. 

Geology. — With respect to the geological features of the parish, 
it may be stated generally, that the lower and more level parts, 
constituting the great bulk of the surface, rest upon sandstone, 
while the hills and rising grounds are composed of trap-rocks, 
which appear to have been ejected from beneath through the 
former. 

The principal sections of the stratified rocks occur on the 
soutb bank of the Tweed, which is loftier and more precipitous 
than the other. These sections exhibit strata of sandstone, shale, 
and marl-limestones, variously alternating with each other. The 
sandstone is either of a gray or of a reddish-brown colour, of con- 
siderable weight, and highly indurated except where the beds are 
very thin. There is generally a small admixture of iron, and a 
sufficient portion of calcareous matter to cause the mineral to ef- 
fervesce freely with acids. In thickness, the sandstone strata vary 
from -a few inches to several feet; and their dip is towards the 
south-west at an angle of from 15° to '20°. The shales, or soft 
marl-clays, which alternate with the sandstone, and in many in- 
stances form the more abundant strata of the two, also occur in 
beds of a great diversity of thickness. They are usually of a blue, 
brown, or purple colour; but the blue is the most common, and

it frequently contains, as in the debris of Broxlaw-hill on the 
north bank of the Tweed, red and white foliated and fibrous gyp- 
sum ; the fibrous occurring in continuous veins, the red foliated in 
irregular and interrupted beds similar to the flint in the chalk 
rocks. The last of these alternating rocks, the marl-limestones, 
likewise occur in beds of various thickness, as well as of various 
degrees of hardness, — some being very compact and difficult to 
break, while others crumble down into cubical or rounded portions 
by exposure to the weather. Their colour is generally of a pale 
blue or gray, though at some places beds occur of a darker hue, 
and having very much the external aspect of common limestone. 
None of them, however, contain any considerable proportion of 
carbonate of lime. 

The south bank of the Tweed is not the only part of the pa- 
rish which presents sections of sandstone ; but, as the others do 
not differ essentially from this, the above description may suffice. 
That which appears in Mellendean burn, the march between 
Kelso and Sprouston, has the same accompanying shales and marl- 
limestones, but is harder and more conglomerate. The sandstone 
which forms the foundation of Teviot bridge is .still harder, and 
has the imbedded substances in considerably smaller quantities. 
On the north bank of the Tweed, near Rosebank, a thick bed of 
gray sandstone, formerly wrought as building stones, appears, ac- 
companied by numerous thinner strata of the same rock, contain- 
ing so large a proportion of mica as to be of a black colour.  

Trap-rocks are pretty generally diffused over all the elevated 
parts of the southern division of the parish ; but the best section 
is in Wooden den, a romantic ravine through which a small burn 
flows northward into the Tweed. Entering upon the burn a lit- 
tle above the point of confluence, you first meet with sandstone, 
shales and marl limestones, similar to those on the banks of the 
river. On reaching, however, the point where the ravine begins 
to assume a glen-like character, a conglomerate rock of a dark- 
brown colour makes it appearance, which, though very much re- 
sembling the old red sandstone, proves on examination to be trap 
tuff, very much decomposed, and fast crumbling down into gravel 
and soil. This trap tuff which in a basis of clay, contains nodules 

' The question as to the particular formation to which these stratified rocks be- 
long, is one of great difficulty. There seems, however, to be a growing persuasion 
among goo ogists that they belong to the coal measures. This opinion, though 
discredited by the entire absence of the bituminous shales, has at least the support, 
if support it may be called of the popular tradition, which bears that coal was 
tormerly found in the district.

of sandstone, claystone, porphyry, heavy spar, &amp;c. is traceable 
up the bed of the stream for more than a hundred yards, when 
it is succeeded by a dark blue compact basalt with amygda- 
loidal concretions, chiefly of calcareous spar ;  while this again 
immediately passes into a more characteristic amygdaloid, contain- 
ing, besides calcareous crystals, portions of green earth and felspar. 
As we proceed onward, the country and the precipitous banks of 
the glen still rising in elevation, the character of the amygdaloid 
gradually disappears, and the rock is found to have passed into the 
compact felspar. A fine bold cliff, rising almost perpendicular 
from the bed of the stream, and projecting from the contiguous 
banks so as to form the turn of the glen, consists of this rock. It 
is of a gray and blue colour, and, besides being intersected with 
numerous veins of red quartz, is somewhat remarkable from its 
containing calcareous matter deposited in the form of calcareous 
sinter, and red calcareous earth, so as to line the sides of nume- 
rous natural cavities and fissures in the rock. The glen abruptly 
terminates in another cliff of from 50 to 60 feet in height, over 
which the burn falls perpendicularly, forming a pretty linn or water- 
fall ; but this last rock presents a very interesting section, being 
in fact an epitome of the structure of the glen ; for the trap-tuff 
which forms its basis is seen gradually passing into the basalt and 
compact felspar, which last constitutes the great mass of the cliff 
abovethe base. 

To this account of the prevailing rocks it may be proper to add, 
that the vale of the Tweed at this particular part, or, to speak more 
correctly, the large circular , basin where the Teviot unites with 
the Tweed, exhibits very many of those appearances from which 
theorists generally infer excavation by the gradual subsidence of 
the waters of a river. The high and rocky banks, indeed, on the 
south side of the Tweed, and the other terraces on both sides of 
the river, which form the fence or girdle of this basin, may owe 
their elevation and separation from each other, to some other 
cause than flowing water, notwithstanding the comparatively uni- 
form level of their summits and their covering of rolled gravel : 
the more probable supposition doubtless being, that they were 
raised by the force of internal heat when the trap-lavas which 

 It deserves remark, that, though the point of junction of the trap-tufl with the ba- 
salt or amygdaloid is clearly marked, there is no appearance to indicate the transi- 
tu™ of "he one rock into the other. They come in contact like two perpendicular 
walls; insomuch that it is impossible to determine from the appearances presented, 
which is the lower and which is the higher.

form the higher grounds in the vicinity were forced upwards. But, 
whatever may be the history of these rocky barriers, there, seems lit- 
tle reason to doubt that the space inclosed by them, scooped out as 
it is in the form of a basin as if for the purpose of receiving the 
contents of two superb rivers, and diversified by haugh and mea- 
dow ground, and by gravelly terraces rising and retiring one above 
another, on both sides of the stream, like the tiers of a fortification, 
bespeaks the action of running water. Whether the Tweed and 
Teviot, at the remote period at which they flowed at some of the 
higher levels indicated by these terraces, united to form at this 
particular place a lake whose subsequent drainage excavated the 
lower parts of the vale, or flowed as a river as they do still, only 
with a more lateral and serpentine course, may be a question dif- 
ficult to settle ; but few geologists will be disposed to doubt that 
the parallel terraces, on one of which the Castle of Floors stands, 
constitute the remains of a plain or strath, of which all that is 
wanting has travelled downwards to form or enrich the haugh- 
lands of Berwickshire and Northumberland. 

Botany. — Though there is neither mountainous nor marshy 
ground within its limits, the parish is not wanting in plants of suf- 
ficient variety and beauty to reward the search of the florist. In the 
bed and on the banks ,the Tweed and Teviot are found, 

Ballota nigra Mentha gentilis 

Blysnius compressus Plantago media 

Adoxa moschatellina Potamogeton praslongus and pusil-

trap rocks. Nearly forty years ago, the late Mr Dickson of Edin - 
burgh discovered, near Kelso, one of the rarest of British ferns, 
Asplenium altemifolium ; but although diligently searched for, for 
several years past, by an accomplished native botanist, Dr Francis 
Douglas, it has hitherto eluded discovery. A fungus, Clavaria 
rosea, new to Great Britain, although described by continental 
botanists, has recently been found on one of the road-sides. It is a 
very elegant species of a beautiful pink or rose colour ; and as it 
has been seen for three successive seasons on the same spot, there 
is reason to hope that it will retain its habitat. 

Besides fine specimens of all the more common forest trees, 
elm, plane-tree, oak, &amp;c, which adorn the park and plantations of 
Floors and Springwood, the parish can boast of several single 
trees remarkable for their size, age, or historical interest. Close 
to the village of Maxwellheugh, is a poplar, which is estimated to 
contain not less than 800 or 900 cubic feet of timber ; its height 
from the ground to the point where it gives off branches is 16 
feet ; its girth at the root is 31 feet ; at 2 feet from the base, 21, 
and at 10 from the base, 18. An ancient elm, known by the 
name of the trysting-tree, extends its arms at the point where 
the parish marches with Roxburgh, and marks the spot where 
the river used to be forded before the erection of Teviot-bridge. 
It is now in the last stage of decay ; but beautiful specimens of 
furniture made from its timber may be seen at Floors, espe- 
cially in the magnificent cabinet of British birds which the taste 
of the present Noble proprietor has recently fitted up. Ano- 
ther tree of equal historic interest, though greatly inferior in age, 
is the yew-tree which marks the spot in the park of Floors where 
King James II. was killed in 1460 by the bursting of a cannon 
while he was engaged in the blockade of F„oxburgh Castle. Nor 
must a remarkable Platanus, or oriental plane, pass unnoticed 
which, though it no longer exists except in the shape of furni- 
ture, is still remembered as the favourite of Sir Walter Scott's 
boyhood, and must ever continue to be classical, as having afford- 
ed the " leafy shade" beneath which he read for the first time 
Percy's Reliques of Ancient English Poetry,— the work which 
seems to have kindled the minstrel-spirit within him. This tree, 
under whose overshadowing boughs the border muse may be said 
to have visited and inspired her favourite son, formed the chief at-

traction of a garden to the east of the town, — one of the latest 
in this district of those Dutch distortions of nature which have 
disappeared before modern improvement. The platanus died, 
in common with most of its kind in this country, in the unusual- 
ly hard winter of 1814. The garden, of which its " huge hill of 
leaves" was the chief ornament, is a garden still ; but its straight 
walks, yew-hedges, parterres and labyrinth, survive only in the page 
of the " Great Magician." 

Zoology. — There is little in the zoology of the parish to distin- 
guish it from the surrounding district. The Tweed, as is well 
known, abounds with red fish, which are believed to afford no 
ground for questioning the general opinion, that almost every river 
has its distinct variety of the trout or salmon tribe. A small pond, 
or rather tarn, at the western extremity of the park of Floors, con- 
tains carp and tench, while the park itself is not without its comple- 
ment of fallow-deer. — Among birds, the swan deserves to be noticed, 
from the added charm which its presence gives to many of the fine 
scenes on the Tweed. There are, at present, six white swans upon 
the river at Kelso, each of them fully realizing, in its smooth and 
graceful motion on the clear blue stream, the poet's description, 

" The swan on still St Mary's lake, 
Floats double, swan and shadow."'" 

These creatures are so tame that they readily approach the 
water's edge to take crumbs of bread from passengers ; and from 
the pleasure they afford, they are as much prized and guard- 
ed by all classes and ages among the inhabitants, as though, 
like the Queen's swans on the Thames, they had the special 
protection of the corporation. They associate in pairs ; and, 
what is remarkable, each pair appears to have a specific section of 
the river allotted to it, which it guards with the utmost jealousy 
against the intrusion of the others. In the case of one of the pairs, 
this prescriptive domain extends over a space of considerably more 
than a mile. The interesting spectacle has been repeatedly wit- 
nessed of the old swans carrying the young ones on their wings 
across the rapid parts of the river, while they left them to stem 
the smooth water by their own efforts. 

II. — Civil History. 
The history of Kelso, so far as it can be detached from the 
general history of the Border, may be conveniently divided into the 
history of the parish and the history of the town.

History of the Parish. — Prior to the Reformation, the territory 
now included in the parish of Kelso appears to have comprehend- 
ed three parishes ; the parish of Kelso on the north bank of the 
Tweed, and the parishes of Maxwell and St James's,  both on 
the south, and separated from each other by the river Teviot. Two 
at least of those parishes, Kelso and Maxwell, seem to have been 
erected and to have had each its separate church, at a period an- 
tecedent to the foundation of the Abbey. Of the church of Kel- 
so little more is known than that it was dedicated to the Virgin ; 
given to the monks at the erection of the Abbey ; and burnt down 
in one of those military or predatory incursions to which the border 
counties were so long exposed. The church of St James's formed 
one of the three churches of the ancient burgh of Roxburghe, 
though situate on St James's Green without its walls. It was 
founded, according to the Chronicle of Mailross, in 1134, and exist- 
ed till the beginning of the fifteenth century, when it was reduced to 
a ruinous condition, probably by fire,-f- during some of the border 
wars. The ruin might have remained to the present day, one of the 
most interesting antiquities on the border, had it not been for a 
steward on the Roxburghe estate, — more to be honoured for his 
economy than his taste, — who caused it to be demolished, in order 
that its materials might be applied to the building of farm- offices 
and fences. The last of the three churches, that of Maxwell or 
Maccusvill, was dedicated to St Michael ; but the date alike of its 
erection and demolition is unknown : though the cemetery of the 
parish still remains to indicate where it stood. Still more scanty 
are the memorials of an oratory, in the same parish, dedicated to 
St Thomas, which is conjectured to have stood at Chapel, a place 
to the east of Springwood House. — From the foundation of the 
Abbey, when these parishes were assigned to the monks as part 
of their patrimony, their history, until the era of the Reformation, 
necessarily merges in that of the Abbey itself. 

The monks of Kelso were of the class called Tironenses, a sec- 
tion of the Benedictine order, which had its original settlement at 
Tiron in Picardy under the elder St Bernard, and which was re- 

 It is not absolutely certain that St James's ever formed a separate parish. The 
territory surrounding the church may have orginally formed part of the parish of 

Roxburgh. . . , « 

f This probability is grounded on the fact mentioned in the former Statistical Ac- 
count, that in digging up the foundation, a quantity of wheat and barley was found in 
a charred state, scattered on a tiled pavement.

markable for the encouragement given by it to the arts ; — it be- 
iner a regulation of the order, that the brethren, besides observing 
the ordinary rules of the monastic institution, should practise with- 
in the convent some useful craft. The Tironenses were intro- 
duced into Scotland under the auspices of that " sore saint for 
the crown," the celebrated King David, who was doubtless in- 
duced to favour their settlement, not more by religious conside- 
rations, than by a regard to ,the advantages likely to accrue to his 
semi-barbarous subjects, from the arts cultivated by the' monks. 
Being only heir-apparent to the throne at the date of their first 
introduction a. d. 1113, David appointed them a residence at 
Selkirk, in the vicinity of his paternal estate. But immediately 
on his accession, he made provision for their greater influence, by 
building, within view of the royal castle of Roxburghe, then the 
principal residence of the Scottish monarchs, the Abbey of Kelso, 
to which they were removed in 1128 or 1130, and in which they 
soon attained, under the fostering patronage of this munificent 
prince, a first rank, in point of wealth and ascendency, among 
the religious houses of the kingdom. 

It does not appear from the records of the times, that the mo- 
nastery ever proved of such advantage to border civilization as 
its founder anticipated. Its history is singularly barren, in re- 
ference to the exertions of the monks in diffusing a knowledge 
of the arts, or even in preserving the treasures of literature. Yet 
for this, perhaps, the monks are not to be blamed, so much as the 
untowardness of the times in which their lot was cast. There 
never seems to have existed on the border that respect for reli- 
gious houses, which in other places rendered them safer reposi- 
tories for literary treasures than the fortresses of kings : Nor do 
the monks ever seem to have gained that ascendency over the po- 
pular mind, which alone could cause the monastery to act as a 
centre and source of civilization to the surrounding country. 
Being the scene of almost incessant wars, not only between the two 
countries, but between rival barons, the banks of the Tweed were 
singularly unpropitious for the tranquil occupations of the library 
and the scriptorium, and not peculiarly favourable to the cultiva- 
tion of the industrial arts. Nor can it surprise us that the only 
memorial of four hundred years of the monastic life — with the ex- 
ception of some reputed improvements in horticulture, and the 
titles of a few lost controversial tracts, — should be the ruins of the 
magnificent Abbey.

The same causes which precluded the monks of Kelso from 
prosecuting the arts of peace, render their monastery more fertile 
than sacred edifices generally are, in the materials of military his- 
tory. Their annals recall the " memoriam perfuncti periculi" 
if not the e testimonium preteriti benejicii." Indeed, from the 
commencement of the wars between England and Scotland, un- 
til the suppression of monachism in 1559, the Abbey is continually 
mentioned in connexion with the convulsions in which the confines 
of the two countries were involved. It seems to have been twice 
burnt, so early as the contest that rose out of the claims of Bruce 
and Baliol for the Scottish throne ; and so little do the monks 
seem, even at that period, to have been respected either by the 
neighbouring barons, or by the people at large, that they requir- 
ed, in times of general truce, the protection of the King of 
England to enable them to buy and convey provisions in safety- 
The greatest disasters of the Abbey, however, were sustained 
during the successive invasions of the Earls of Surrey and Hert- 
ford, in 1 523 and 1545. In the former of these incursions, a body 
of English under Lord Dacre, after sacking the town, demolish- 
ed the abbot's house, burnt the dormitory, and unroofed the 
monastery itself, — conveying away the very lead which covered 
it, insomuch that all religious services were interrupted, and the 
monks compelled to retire to a neighbouring village to celebrate 
their sacred rites. The devastation of 1545 was still more irre- 
parable. Kelso was not indeed, in the latter instance, the exclusive 
sufferer : for in the course of a few days, 287 places, including 
the four great monasteries of the border, were sacked, pillaged 
and dilapidated ; but Kelso, as the only place that offered resist- 
ance, shared worst. The oast and north sides of the Abbey 
tower were thrown down, and the choir reduced to its present 
ruinous condition, probably by means of a battery of cannon di- 
rected against it from the north-east; whilst the town was redu- 
ced to so wretched a plight, that the weekly ' market could not be 
held in it, but had to be transferred for a considerable period to 
the village of Hume. The Abbey is occasionally mentioned after 
this period as a place of temporary refuge from the sudden incur- 
sions of the famous garrison at Wark and other scourges of these 
distracted times : nor, indeed, do the conventual buildings seem to 
have been entirely abandoned by the monks, until the Reformation. 
But there is no reason to think that it was ever used as a place 
of religious worship, after the bombardment just described ; and, 



KELSO. 



311 



though Lesly speaks of a popular tumult in 1560, when the images 
and relics, and whatever else remained of its internal furniture and 
decorations, were defaced, yet it is certain that the Scottish Re- 
formers are not open to the charge of having dismantled this Po- 
pish temple. The Erostratus in this instance was not John Knox, 
but an English baron. 

The latest mention made of the monks of Kelso is in an act 
of Parliament, eight years after the establishment of the Reform- 
ed religion, appointing Sir John Maitland to hold the confiscated 
estates of this rich Abbey in commendam. From this document it 
would seem that they had disappeared one after another, and that 
none of them was left in 1587. When Maitland was raised to 
the dignity of Lord High Chancellor, the Earl of Bothwell ob- 
tained a grant from the Crown of the possessions of the Abbey. 
On the attainder of Bothwell, these lands and possessions again 
reverted to the Crown : and they were finally conferred on Sir 
Robert Ker of Cessford, Warden of the East Marches, from whom 
they have descended to the Noble family of Roxburghe. 

About the year 1580, one of the cells of the cloister was converted 
into a church for the use of the now united parishes, and the ser- 
vices of the Reformed religion set up in the room of the Romish 
worship. A considerable period, however, elapsed before the plas- 
tic and ameliorating power of the new institutions became apparent. 
The bulk of the people, having been all along proverbially indif- 
ferent to Christian observances, and more open to the influence of 
fairies and elves, the last remnants of Paganism, than to any re- 
ligious consideration, required to be instructed in the first elements 
of faith ; while the unsettled state of the times presented obstacles 
to the success of the Reformed clergy, which render it far from 
surprising that the moral condition of the border should not have 
speedily assimilated to that of more peaceful districts. It was not 
till an advanced part of the seventeenth century that the good 
fruits of the great ecclesiastical revolution began to be gathered ; 
nor even then, nor for generations afterwards, were these fruits so 
abundant here as elsewhere. Throughout the agitating con- 
tests between the Presbyterian and the prelatical parties, with 
respect to the King's supremacy, Kelso appears to have generally 
sided with the hierarchy ; and even subsequent to the Revolution, 
when the question about Lay Patronage and popular rights, 
excited so warm an interest throughout Berwickshire and Teviot- 
dale, such was the ascendency of jacobite and high church prin-

eiples, that Kelso, though in the very centre of the agitation, re- 
mained an indifferent spectator. In the famous petition and ad- 
herence to the General Assembly " anent grievances," there are 
numerous signatures from all the adjoining parishes, but not one 
from this. Nay, what would seem still more indicative of apathy 
in reference to matters then deemed so important, the appoint- 
ment of a minister to the parish was, in the only instance in which 
anything like a contested election occurred, referred uncondition- 
ally to the disposal of the synod. The heritors and elders hav- 
ing been unable to unite in the choice of the same individual, it 
was unanimously resolved to submit a blank call, properly signed, 
to the synod, and to ask that judicatory to fill it up with the name 
of a qualified minister : nor do either the patrons or the parish- 
ioners seem to have offered any resistance, or taken any offence, 
when the presbytery, instead of obtempering the instructions of 
the synod, proceeded to settle a minister of their own nomination. 

Towards the middle of the last century, there is reason to 
think that a more lively interest in the principles and institu- 
tions of religion was induced. This amelioration, tradition re- 
fers to the period of the celebrated Mr Ramsay's incumbency ; 
— an account which is corroborated to some extent by the parish 
records of the time, which bear ample testimony to the vigour 
with which the Presbyterian discipline was maintained, and, there- 
fore, leave room for the inference, that public opinion had then 
come to be in its favour. Conjecture is converted into cer- 
tainty by the fact, that, about the year 1750, a Secession meeting 
was opened in the town : for, as the Secession judicatories were not 
in the habit of providing ordinances, except where a demand for 
them existed, or of breaking up the fallow ground, where they had 
it in their power to divide and appropriate the ripening harvest ; 
the fact of their planting a congregation in Kelso seems necessari- 
ly to presuppose the prior existence, in the parish, of a strong feel- 
ing in favour both of orthodox doctrine and of presbyterial rule. 
But, to whatever date the commencement of the favourable change 
may be referred, there is happily no doubt that it continued steadily 
and progressively to advance, up to the end of the century. Nor need 
we withhold from the Seceders, the praise of materially promoting 

 The number of signatures attached to this curious document, from some of the 
other parishes in the same synod with Kelso, are as follows : — Maxton, 17 ; Lillies- 
leaf, 56 ; Jedburgh, 63 ; Eckford, 90 ; Dunse, 12 ; Galashiels, 66 ; Earlstoun, 22 ; 
Westruther, 16 ; Stow, 65 ; Mertoun, 16; Selkirk, 24 ; Yarrow, 50; Hounam, 21.

a change, of which their own separate ecclesiastical existence was 
one of the fruits ; though, doubtless, their influence would have 
proved far more efficacious for good, had they preserved unity 
among themselves, instead of splitting through internal dissensions 
from one into three congregations, in the course of forty years. It 
does not appear, that the higher classes partook much of the moral 
and religious improvement just described. On the contrary, it would 
seem that Jacobite principles disappeared among them, only to 
make way, in too many instances, for the opposite extreme of 
French infidelity. But the extent, to which the general popula- 
tion were brought under the influence of Christian habits, was in- 
dubitably great. There are persons still living, who remember the 
state of things sixty years ago, when family worship was so com- 
mon, that you could not pass along the principal street of the town 
on a Sunday morning, without hearing from many « a lowly roof," 

" " ; at intervals 

The voice of psalms — the simple song of praise." 

Since that period, domestic piety, it is to be feared, has rather re- 
trograded among the working classes j though there is every rea- 
son to believe that the moral condition of all but the very low- 
est class of the people has, upon the whole, been gradually improv- 
ing. An additional church has just been erected in connexion 
with the Establishment, in order to render the means of instruction 
commensurate with the spiritual exigencies of the parish. The 
attendance on public ordinances is becoming, every successive year, 
more numerous ; the charities of those who possess the means of 
giving are keeping pace with the growing number and claims of 
the necessitous. And, altogether, despite the serious drawbacks 
to religious improvement occasioned here as elsewhere by the dis- 
turbing influences of political excitement and sectarian contro- 
versy, the prospects of the best of all causes cannot justly be re- 
garded as discouraging. 

History of the Town.— Originally, the town of Kelso seems 
to have been only an inconsiderable village, a kind of suburb to 
the then important burgh of Roxburgh, which lay on the oppo- 
site side of the Tweed. From the foundation of the Abbey, how- 
ever, it began gradually to acquire a more important character. 
By the time of King Robert I. it had so increased as to consist of 
two parts, Wester and Easter Kelso ; the former being probably 
the original village, and the latter that which gradually grew up 
around the abbey. And on the final destruction of Roxburgh bv

James II. it naturally took the place, as well as somewhat of the 
prominence of the celebrated burgh, whose inhabitants had trans- 
ferred to it their residence and wealth. Of the rapid growth and 
early importance of Kelso, one decisive proof has been preserved. 
So early as 1323, an attempt was made by the burgesses to exer- 
cise a civil jurisdiction independent of the abbot. By their own 
authority, they undertook to make new burgesses, to license brew- 
ers, and in other respects to contravene the rights and privileges 
of their feudal lord. This attempt indeed proved abortive, and 
the burgesses were compelled to make an apology, and disclaim 
all intention of offending their lord, the Abbot. Yet the very mak- 
ing of such an attempt must be held conclusive of the growing 
prosperity of the place : such a thing would never have been thought 
of by a weak, or a poor, or a scanty population. 

The connection of the town with the abbey necessarily made 
it a sharer for evil as well as good, in the fortunes of that ill-fated 
house ; nor in truth, is its history from the fifteenth century down 
to the Reformation, any thing better than a detail of successive 
sieges and conflagrations. Whenever the abbey was assailed, the 
town was sacked ; whenever the former was set on fire, the latter 
was burnt. Nor is there any thing in border history more re- 
markable, than the manner in which its buildings probably for the 
most part of wood, were continually repaired and restored, so as 
to form the materials of so many and closely consecutive conflagra- 
tions. Notwithstanding it was reduced to so low an ebb by 
Hertford's bombardment in 1545, as not to be fit for holding a 
market in, we find it possessing, at the era of the Reformation, 
only a few years after, the size and importance of the chief pro- 
vincial town and emporium. " Non moritur, moribunda ; sepulta, 
resurgit." 

Soon after the Reformation, a new source of prosperity was opened 
up in the fostering patronage of the family of Roxburghe, who suc- 
ceeding not only to the revenues, but to the seignorial jurisdiction 
of the abbots, conferred on the inhabitants all the benefits of aliberal 
expenditure, and an impartial administration of justice. Through 
this patronage, Kelso became, by the time of the Revolution, not 
only the chief resort of the gentry of the district, but a place of 
considerable reputation as a seat of learning. Its schools were 
frequented by the sons of the nobility from various quarters ; and 
the rectorship of the grammar school was, in at least one instance.

that of Kirkwood accepted, in preference to the chair of Hu- 
manity in the University of St Andrews. 

The same fatality in reference to conflagrations, which so often 
changed the face of the town in distracted times, seems to have 
followed it to a more peaceful period. A destructive fire broke 
out in 1686, which consumed about half the town; in 1738, 
it was wasted by a similar visitation ; and there were fires of some 
extent so recently as 1801 and 1815. Of late years it has been 
spared every such calamity ; and has shared largely, in common 
with the whole of lower Tweedside, in the advancing civilization of 
the nineteenth century. It is now one of the most steadily pros- 
perous of the small non-manufacturing towns in Scotland ; and 
its inhabitants form a little community, which, in point of gene- 
ral intelligence and polish of manners, may claim a place beside 
that of the most favoured rural districts in the island. 

Accounts of the Toion and Parish.— The most valuable of the 
ancient documents relative to the parish is the chartulary of 
Kelso with the rent-roll of the abbey, Rotulus Redituum Monas- 
terii de Kalkow, in the Advocates' Library ; but almost all the in- 
formation furnished by it may be obtained in apleasanter form, in 
the Monastic Annals of Teviotdale, by the Rev. James Morton, 
one of the prebendaries of Lincoln, and a native of Kelso;— in 
which elaborate work there is not only a history of the abbey, to- 
gether with an account of its possessions and revenues, bub copies 
of the charter of its foundation by King David, the tax-roll of the 
abbey, and other rare and valuable documents. " Kirkwood's 
Trial," a curious and rare work, published shortly after the union 
of the kingdoms, throws considerable light, though coloured by the 
Jacobite predilections of the author, on the ecclesiastical state of 
the town and district, at the period immediately posterior to the 
final re-establishment of the Presbyterian Church government. 
" Haig's History of Kelso," published only a few years acr 0 , may 
also be consulted with advantage, by such as wish to see &amp; a con- 
nected view of all the material circumstances in its past history or 
present state ;-though unhappily, the value of this work is very 
seriously abated by the number of errors in chronology, and in 
minor points of detail by which it is deformed. Among abridged 
accounts, the most to be depended on for accuracy of statement 
» t under the article « Kelso," in the Edinburgh Encyclope- 
dia, conducted by Brewster. 

Eminent Characters.— The number of eminent persons who 



316 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



have been connected with Kelso by birth, residence, or burial, is 
singularly limited. In the long catalogue of abbots, priors, and 
monks, preserved in the chartulary, there are not more than two 
or three names which are associated, in the mind even of the 
learned, with any thing great or useful or interesting; the vast 
majority, from what cause soever arising, whether from their in- 
herent mediocrity, or " quia carent sacro vate," awaken in the 
intelligent reader, no higher emotion than the names of as many 
individuals in any common muster-roll. The happy exceptions 
are chiefly the following : James Stuart, natural son of James V., 
who held the office of abbot, during a period which forced him to 
play a somewhat prominent part in border history ; a monk of 
the name of James, who is mentioned by Dempster, [Hist. Eccl. 
Gentis Scotorum, as among the most celebrated Scottish authors 
of the fifteenth century ; and Henry, prior of Kelso in 1493, who 
was the intimate friend of the- Italian poet Poliziano, as well as 
himself the author of several literary works, among others a trans- 
lation into Scottish verse, of Palladius Rutilius on Rural Affairs. 

Among the ministers of religion since the Reformation, only 
two require notice ; the former, Mr James Ramsay, who, during 
an incumbency of nearly half a century, exercised great weight, 
not only in the subordinate judicatories, but also in the Gene- 
ral Assembly ; the latter,' the late Mr John Pitcairn, minis- 
ter of the Relief congregation, who, together with Mr Struthers 
of Edinburgh, materially contributed to awaken, throughout all the 
sections of the Scottish Church, a taste for the graces of delivery. 

Kelso has always been peculiarly fortunate in its medical men. 
Few country towns have produced, in one generation, three such 
distinguished ornaments of their profession, as the late Dr An- 
drew Wilson, whose treatise on Morbid Sympathy shows him to 
have been far in advance of the science of his age ; the late Dr 
C. Douglas, the author of the former Statistical Account ; and 
Millar, the well known writer on Asthma. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners are, the Duke of Rox- 
burghe, who holds about nine-sixteenths of the whole valued 
rent ; Sir George Scott Douglas of Springwood, Bart. ; Captain 

 Though scarcely pertinent to the object of the present work, it may here be 
mentioned as a fact worthy of record, that the late Dr Andrew Thomson was DC 
customed to speak of Struthers as his master in pulpit eloquence. While a ymng 
man the Doctor went often to hear Struthers, then the great oratorical attraction ot 
Edinburgh ; and his admiration for the orator was such as not only to leave an in- 
delible impression on his memory, but to stimulate him to emulate the graces he ad- 
mired.

George Scott of Wooden ; James Dickson, Esq. of Pinnacle- 
hill ; David Monro Binning, Esq. of Softlaw ; Sir William Dick- 
son of Sydenham, Bart. ; John Waldie, Esq. of Hendersyde ; 
and the Governors of George Watson's Hospital, Edinburgh. 

Parochial Registers. — These consist of the minutes of kirk- 
session, the register of births and baptisms, and the register of 
proclamations and marriages. The session records, in ten volumes 
folio and quarto, go back as far as the beginning of the year 1622, 
and come down, with some interruptions, to the present time. 
These interruptions are from March 1661 to June 1668; from 
August 1689 to May 1692; and from September 1749 to August 
1800, — though this last blank is in a good measure supplied by a 
set of duplicate minutes, — apparently the original drafts, — which 
extend, with but few intermissions, from 1697 to 1830. The re- 
gister of baptisms, in eleven volumes, begins at 1597; but it has 
also many blanks, and is, especially of late years, far from being 
a complete list of the births in the parish. The register of niaN 
riages commences likewise from 1597, and is generally kept in the 
same volume with that of births and baptisms. 

Antiquities. — With the exception of its magnificent abbey, the 
parish now possesses few antiquities of any note. Even since the 
date of the last Statistical Account, their number has been dimi- 
nished. The site of the Church of Str James's, near the con- 
fluence of the Tweed and Teviot, is no longer distinguishable 
from the surrounding sward of St James's Green. The church- 
yard of Maxwell still contains a few monumental stones, with the 
inscriptions tolerably legible ; yet, from the dilapidated state in 
which they are permitted to lie, there is little prospect of their 
long surviving the fate of the older relics. Some minor ob- 
jects and buildings in the town, « freighted with recollections" of 
the past, have also disappeared within a recent period. Nor does 
a single vestige now remain of the human bones, which used to 
be upturned, in great numbers, by the plough in the " Bony Brae," 
near Wooden, the supposed scene of a battle— with the Danes, 
according to some ; between the Scots and English, according to 
others. The possession, however, of Kelso Abbey is itself enough 
to render the parish interesting to the antiquary ; and there can 
now be little doubt, from the judicious and successful efforts which 
have been made since 1804 to disencumber the ruins of the rude 
modern masonry which disfigured them, and to strengthen and 
repair those parts which were verging to decay, that this solid and

majestic pile, — the monument of a period when Scotland vied 
with its richer neighbours in the splendour of its architectural 
edifices, — will long continue to be the ornament of the town and 
district. 

The form of the abbey is that of a Latin cross,— though, con- 
trary to the general practice in buildings of that model, the head 
of the cross is turned towards the west, and the longest limb is the 
eastern. The only parts of the building which are still tolerably 
entire are, — the western limb or head of the cross which con- 
tains, among other ornaments, a segment of a most magnificent 
archway ; the central tower rising over the intersection of the cross, 
of which the north and west sides remain entire ; and the walls of 
the transepts, with the northern entrance to them. Of the choir, 
which seems to have consisted when entire of three divisions, — a 
centre aisle and two side aisles, all that remains is one of the walls 
which upheld the main roof, and separated the main aisle from 
the southern side aisle. This wall consists of two arches with 
their piers, and the superincumbent wall, which has within it 
the thickness of two tiers of galleries, one over the other, and open 
to the interior by an arcade of small round arches. 

The style of architecture is the Saxon ; nor would it be easy to 
find better specimens, than occur, in the north and west fronts, of 
the deep-splayed Saxon arch, with its numerous mouldings and 
enrichments. But the fabric cannot pretend, any more than the 
other ecclesiastical edifices of Scotland, to perfect unity of style. 
While the plain undecorated Saxon predominates, the Norman 
and old English styles occasionally enter. The interlacing semi- 
circular arches, for instance, which range round the walls within 
and without, and which furnish, it may be remarked,. as perfect 
specimens of this species of arch as are to be found in the island, 
obviously belong to the Norman style, as do likewise the two 
arcades of small circular arches, springing from slender shafts, 
which appear above the massive Saxon arches in the ruinous wall 
of the choir ; while the four spacious pointed arches in the centre 
of the cross, upon which the lofty square tower or lantern — the 
grandest part of the ruin — rests, are plainly of the early English 
or Gothic style. Of the general effect of the whole ruin, whether 
as an architectural pile, or as an object in the landscape, no de- 

 It is acutely remarked by Pennant, in his description of this abbey, that the in- 
tersection of these interlacing circular arches " forms ,1 true Gothic arch, and may 
as probably have given rise to that mode as the arched shades of avenues."

scviption can convey an adequate idea. Distinguished alike by 
its great height, its unity of parts, its massiveness, and its inor- 
nate simplicity, it produces on the spectator, especially when 
viewed from the west, south, or east, a distinctness and oneness of 
impression, rarely communicated by other than entire and com- 
pact fabrics ; and it possesses, in common with all objects which 
are at once vast, simple, and symmetrical, the charm of gaining 
on our admiration, the oftener and longer it is contemplated. Its 
dimensions are as under : — Total length of ruin, from west to east, 
99 feet; length of transept within the walls, 71 feet; breadth of 
ditto 23 feet ; height of centre tower, 91 feet ; breadth of ditto, 23 
feet; height of pointed arches on which the lantern rests, 45 feet; 
width of ditto, 17 feet ; thickness of lower walls, 5 feet. 

In the year 1649, a clumsy attempt was made to repair part 
of the ruin, for the purpose of converting it into a parish church. 
With this view, two low and gloomy arches were thrown over the 
walls, one over the transept, and another over the head of the cross, 
while a wing of rude masonry of a corresponding vault-like charac- 
ter was erected in the ruined choir. A second tier of arches was 
thrown over the former, to serve the purpose of an outer and inner 
prison,— which deserves to be noticed from its forming the original, 
whence the author of Waverley sketched the prison of Edie Ochil- 
tree in the Antiquary. The former of these clumsy erections'con- 
tinued to be used as the parish church till 1771, when it was finally 
deserted in consequence of the falling, during the time of divine 
service, of some fragments of cement from the roof. The congre- 
gation hurried out in consternation, under the idea that the vault 
over their heads was giving way ; and, though the alarm proved un- 
founded, it was yet found impossible to persuade the people to re - 
assemble in it,— the more especially that there was in circulation 
an ancient " prophecy" of Thomas the Rhymer, which bore that 
this « kirk should fall when at the fullest." Nothing was done to- 
wards disincumbering the abbey of these unsightly adjuncts, until 
1805, when William, Duke of Roxburghe, began to clear them 
away. His plans were followed up still more energetically by his 
successor, Duke James, who, in 1816, caused the whole remaining 
part to be removed ; though it was not till 1823, that those repairs 
were made on the ruin which have brought it into its present state 
of beauty and stability.

Modern Buildings. — Although the town is remarkable for its ge- 
neral neatness, it does not possess more than two buildings ot 
any architectural merit. These are, the town-house, which occu- 
pies the centre of the east side of the square, and the new church, 
recently erected on the north side of the town for the better ac- 
commodation of the members of the Establishment. The former 
is a building of two stories, with a pediment in front, supported by 
four Ionic columns, surmounted by a handsome balustrade, and 
with a neat turret or belfry of sufficient height to form a conspicu- 
ous object in a town destitute of steeples. The latter, the chastest 
and most elegant ecclesiastical erection on the border, is an oblong 
building in the Elizabethan style, with a quadrangular tower 70 
feet high. 

Several of the mansion-houses in the landward parish and of 
the villas in the environs of the town, deserve to be noticed. 
The stately ducal mansion of Floors, erected in 1718, is not 
unworthy of its architect, Sir John Vanbrugh ; nor will its cha- 
racter as " a building combining the ideas of ancient grandeur 
with those of modern taste,"  be diminished, but, on the contrary, 
greatly enhanced, by the alterations which are now in progress 
under the direction of Mr Playfair of Edinburgh. Ednam House 
is one of the most elegant private mansions that Nisbet ever de- 
signed. A gateway, after a design of Mr Gillespie Graham, form- 
ing the entrance to the beautiful park of Springwood, is also gene- 
rally admired as a happy application of the style of a Grecian door- 
way to the purposes of a detached entrance gate. Nor would the 
mansion-houses of Springwood, Wooden, Pinnacle Hill, Woodside, 
&amp;c. deserve to pass unnoticed in a district less richly studded with 
elegant country seats. 

But by far the most perfect specimen of modern architecture in 
the parish, is the bridge across the Tweed, which unites in a remark- 
able manner simplicity with strength. The plan was furnished by 
the late Mr Rennie ; and its perfection as an architectural structure 
may be inferred from the fact, that when called upon ata subsequent 
period to furnish a plan for Waterloo Bridge across the Thames at 
London, this eminent engineer, unable to suggest a better design, 
produced an enlarged duplicate of Kelso Bridge. It was begun in 
1800, to supply the place of onef which had been swept away 

 These are the terms in which Sir Walter Scott describes this spacious mansion. 

f The bridge here alluded to was situate a little farther up the Tweed, and was 
built in 1754. There was in early times a bridge across the Tweed, at the town ot 
Roxburgh, which was often destroyed and renewed, during contests for that town.

by an overflowing of the Tweed in 1797 ; and it was finished in 
1803, at an expense, including the approaches, of about L. 18,000. 
The total length of building is 494 feet, the breadth of the road- 
way is 25 feet, and its greatest height from the foundation, which 
extends 15 feet below the bed of the river, is 57 feet. The 
arches, five in number, are elliptical, the span of each arch being 
72 feet, and that of the piers 14. The singular elegance of this 
bridge is the more fortunate, as its situation renders it the most 
prominent object in some of the finest landscapes on the Tweed. 
Connecting two banks, each remarkable for beauty, it forms the 
eye of a vast variety of pictures, while by its breadth of mellow 
light it affords a striking contrast and relief to the dark colour of 
the wooded scenery on either side. This bridge forms the entrance 
to the town from the south ; and few scenes are more imposing than 
that which opens upon the tourist as he descends from the oppo- 
site village of Maxwellheugh with the prospect beneath him of this 
fine architectural object, the majestic Tweed, the picturesque 
town and abbey, and the noble back ground of the castle, woods, 
and surrounding heights of Floors. 

III. — Population. 
Former and present state. — No data exist for" ascertaining the 
amount of the population, prior to the middle of last century. 
Since that time, there has been a slow but nearly constant increase, 
as appears from the following table of its amount, at successive 
periods from 1749.

Causes of Fluctuation. — The only remarkable increase indicated 
above, that of the thirty-eight years, from 1755 to 1793, receives 
a ready explanation from the change which was then in progress, 
from the system of small to that of large farms ; a change which 
necessarily drove the petty farmers and labourers from the rural 
districts to the market-town. Two circumstances have ended, in 
recent times, to keep the ratio of increase below that of many 



322

other places. The one is the constant drain upon the population, 
arising from the necessity under which a large proportion of the 
young men are laid of repairing, in search of employment, to 
places where the market for labour is less limited. The other is 
the gradual and extensive removal from the neighbourhood, of re- 
sident gentry, whose expenditure gave employment to many in- 
dustrious labourers, as well as encouragement to the retail trade of 
the town. It should be remarked, however, that both these sources 
of diminution are, to a small extent, countervailed by the influx 
of aged labourers and others, who are either driven  from the 
rural parishes when they cease to be fit for work, or attracted to 
Kelso by the hope of participating in its ample charities. Within 
a few years, also, a considerable accession has been made to the 
population by the increased resort to the town of a very unde- 
sirable class of persons, the Gypsies, who are now about as nume- 
rous in Kelso as in Yetholm, their prescriptive settlement ; and 
who are not found, when transplanted to the crowded lanes of a 
town, to preserve that quiet and orderly demeanour which is said 
to characterize them in Yetholm, where they seem to feel that they 
have a character to support. Tt may be added, that late years 
have also witnessed the settlement among us of a few Irish ; 
the gleanings of those immense annual swarms, whose successive 
emigrations threaten, if not speedily arrested, to lower and dete- 
riorate, to an extent frightful to contemplate, the character and 
manners of the populace of this island. These occasional fluctu- 
ations in the aggregate population furnish but too accurate an 
exponent of the constant change which is taking place among the 
individuals composing it. Though a few Border-names keep their 
ground, from generation to generation, and thereby indicate that 
the mass is not without a few stationary particles, the great ma- 
jority of the inhabitants may be regarded as " strangers in the 
land." The number of land-owners is far from considerable, who 

 " Driven," though a strong term, is but too aptly applied in this instance. To 
prevent the aged and infirm becoming burdens on the poor rate, it is the practice 
of some of the heritors of purely landward parishes, to demolish every cottar- 
house, which is not absolutely necessary as accommodation for the needful complement 
of farm-labourers and country-artisans. In this way, infirm labourers and widows 
are compelled, the moment, they cease to be available workers, to leave their parishes 
in despite of all the ties of local attachment which may bind them to the spot, and to 
take their chance of an uncertain livelihood among strangers and in the unhealthy 
lanes and closes of a town. It is astonishing that the aristocracy should be so blind 
to their own interest, not to say dead to the claims of humanity, as to incur, for the 
sake of a paltry economy, the hatred instead of the blessing of a class of worthy per- 
sons, to whom separation from the place of their fathers' sepulchres, is the greatest of 
calamities. '

have had their properties transmitted to them for a lengthened 
period, in lineal descent, from father to son ; and the pages of the 
parish register, as well as the humble monuments of the church- 
yard, bear witness to an equal fluctuation in the case of the middle 
and working classes. It is now as true of the borderers, at least 
of those of lower Teviotdale, as of the inhabitants of places less 
fitted to foster local attachment, that there is scarcely one man in 
fifty who, if he survives the age of manhood, is buried with his 
fathers. 

Town Population. — The proportion of the town to the land- 
ward population is as six to one. 

Marriages. — From the growing neglect of registration, the yearly 
average of births cannot be given. No record of deaths is kept. 
The average number of marriages for the last seven years is 34. 

Nobility, Sfc. — There is one nobleman resident for part of the 
year, the Duke of Roxburghe. The number of families of inde- 
pendent fortune may be stated at 19; the number of proprietors 
of land of the annual value of L.,50 and upwards is 17. 

Parliamentary Voters. — The number of persons on the roll as 
qualified voters for a Member of Parliament, is 269. 

Language. — One peculiarity of the pronunciation of this district 
has been already noted, — the tendency to give to the dental sound 
of ch the sound of sh; as sheap for cheap. A second, is the 
habit of sounding the vowel a in a mode precisely the reverse of 
the English usage: Thus water broad a is uniformly pronounced 
water long slender a and vice versa. The mode of enunciating 
the pronoun of the first person is also peculiar. It is sounded as if 
it were written aw: a native Kelsonian does not say, " / saw it," 
but " Aw saw it." In truth, in all that respects language, the 
natives of this district may be said to be Scotorum Scotissimi. 
Though at the distance of only five miles from England, they speak 
the Scottish tongue in the most Doric of its forms; nor does there 
appear any prospect of a speedy improvement in this particular. 
It would indeed seem, that, in proportion as the two countries 
approach their respective confines, the Scotch and Anglican 
tongues, instead of gradually losing each its distinctive character 
so as, at the point of junction, to interblend and coalesce in a 
common dialect, assume each its harshest and most intractable 
form ; as if for the purpose of keeping their respective marches 
clear and distinct. At least the fact is unquestionable that, all 
along the south side of the east marches, we have the Northum- 



324 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



brian burr bristling, like a fence of thorns, to prevent the Scotch 
accent from penetrating into England ; whilst on the north side, 
the latter dialect assumes a breadth of guttural energy, which 
effectually protects " the ancient kingdom" against the inroads of 
the speech of the smoother-tongued Sassenachs. Among the 
words peculiar to the Marches, the verb to stoothe, which signifies 
to lath-and-plaster, is worthy of being naturalized throughout the 
island, as expressing by a single term what is now done only by 
means of a circumlocution. That such a term should be in use on 
the border is the more remarkable, that the practice which it is 
designed to describe prevails less there than in any other part of 
the kingdom equally advanced in a taste for domestic comfort and 
elegance. 

Popular Amusements, c. — Though Kelso is less entitled than 
it once was to the name of the Melton of Scotland, it is still dis- 
tinguished as a resort of the lover of field-sports. Whether fox- 
hunting, horse-racing, or the " occupation of the angle," be his fa- 
vourite diversion, the sportsman has here facilities for pursuing it : 
there being a pack of fox-hounds in the vicinity, a beautiful race- 
course, and a river than which none affords better sport. Accord- 
ingly, though its races form no longer any considerable attraction, 
Kelso is still in vogue for fox-hunting and salmon-fishing ; and 
during several weeks of both the spring and autumn, parties of 
the nobility and gentry, often from the south of England, take 
up their residence in the town for the purpose of enjoying these 
sports. There is also a coursing-club in the parish, which is well 
supported : and once a year, the whipmen of the border turn out, 
— horse and rider gaily tricked out with ribbons and silken sashes, 
— to ride a race, which is the great delight of the rustics and 
school-boys, and which is now happily unaccompanied with the 
cruelties that in earlier times attended it. 

Of the old border games, foot-ball is the onjy one which is still 
a favourite. It is still the practice of the rector of the grammar 
school and of the other teachers in the town to present " the king," 
that is, the boy who makes the most liberal Candlemas offering, 
with a foot-ball, which becomes a source of amusement to the whole 

 In early times, foot-ball matches were common betweon the'inhabitants of adja- 
cent parishes, or of the opposite banks of a stream ; and not only serious accidents, 
but sanguinary quarrels often rose out of them. Sir Robert Carey in his Memoirs, 
narrates that Kelso was the scene of a great meeting of Scotch riders, held ostensibly 
for the purpose of playing at foot-ball, but in reality with the view of concerting mea- 
sures for a hostile incursion into England. 



KELSO.

pupils for several weeks afterwards. The custom, formerly con- 
nected with this, of the scholars marching in procession through 
the town with a gilded ball on the top of a pole, has of late years 
fallen into desuetude. 

Upon the whole, however, Kelso can hardly be classed among 
places noted for their popular games, at least in so far as the resi- 
dent population are concerned. Except when a fine summer even- 
ing tempts a few apprentices to the knowes, to try a match at foot-ball 
or quoits, or a severe winter provides an ice-bound river for the use 
of the curlers, nothing of the nature of sport is to be seen among 
the people at large. The intoxication Gf political excitement 
has here, as elsewhere, tended to deaden the popular mind, as well 
to cheerful amusement, as to other matters of more vital impor- 
tance. And it is to be lamented that, by reason of the long hours 
which a tradesman must work in order to provide the means of 
subsistence, there is a want of time, even when there is no lack of 
disposition, for these manly and healthful recreations. Is it not 
to the disgrace of this great and wealthy nation, that the bulk of 
the working-classes should require to spend so many hours of the 
day in toil as to have no leisure either for the culture of their 
minds, or for the improvement of that physical vigour which is al- 
most essential to a cheerful and contented tone of mind  

In connexion with local customs, it may not be impertinent to 
rectify a mistake, to which the name of Sir Walter Scott has 
given currency, with respect to the usage called a " Kelso convoy." 
According to Sir Walter, this is a proverbial phrase of disparage- 
ment, which took its origin from the practice of the Kelsonians, 
who, less hospitable than the other borderers, " convoyed," or 
accompanied their departing guests no farther than the steps 
of their own threshold. Sir Walter's border lore is in this in- 
stance at fault. " A Kelso convoy," is not a shabby dismissal of 
a guest after attending him only to your door. The old Kel- 
sonians did indeed finish the " convoy," by parting with their guest 
on the threshold ; but then this parting did not take place until 
they had first hospitably convoyed him to his door, and been, in 
return for the compliment, reconvoyed by the latter to their own. 

Physical Habits. — In respect of cleanliness, clothing, and ge- 
neral style and manner of living, the inhabitants,— the class of 
gypsies and the more improvident of the paupers excepted — are 
justly considered to surpass most rural populations. A taste for 
neatness of dress, well furnished houses, and other domestic com- 



323 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



forts, is very general ; nay is, in some instances, carried to excess. 
The men, even in the humblest rank, are for he most part well 
and substantially clothed— having a holiday, as well as a working 
day suit. The dress of the females is in all cases neat; that of 
female servants in particular showy to an extent that might be 
advantageously abated. Women of all classes, down to the scul- 
lion and the beggar, wear bonnets in the open air. The ordi- 
nary food of the peasantry is chiefly of meal, milk, and potatoes,— 
little butcher-meat being used except pork, and no fish except 
herrings. The bread employed is, in many instances, wheaten ; but 
more usually, a mixture of pease and barley meal. If the fare of 
the working classes in the town is in many cases better than this, 
it is also in many cases worse ; it being in the narrow lanes of the 
town that the most numerous instances of sqdalid penury and 
wretchedness occur. 

General Character. — The moral character of a population of 5000 
souls is, like their physical habits, necessarily various. But as 
a whole, the people are sober and industrious, amiable in the re- 
lations of life, and attentive to their religious duties. They are 
more polished in manners and respectful to all above them than 
persons of the same station in manufacturing towns, though per- 
haps somewhat inferior in acuteness of mind and extent of general 
information. Irregular marriages, the bane of the working-classes, 
are believed to be on the decrease ; so also is the proportion of 
illegitimate births : whilst the increase of benefit clubs and of 
savings-bank deposits indicates that, along with the abandon- 
ment of a worse, there is a return, on the part of the com- 
mon people, to a better course of feeling' and conduct. Among 
the most marked characteristics of all classes, especially the high- 
er, may be specified, beneficence to the poor, a large spirit of 
hospitality, and a strong feeling of local attachment. This last 
mentioned quality, in particular, seems quite indigenous. It is 
difficult to persuade a native that there is any town prettier than 

 Coldstream-bridge is the place where these marriages are generally performed 
The person who officiates on these occasions is at present a bankrupt tradesman. 
His predecessor, Peter Mudie, was in the habit of granting the parties who appear- 
ed before him a certificate, bearing that they were " legally and lawfully married" 
by him ; and further containing his own signature with the addendum of V, D. M. 
It was at one time the practice in some of the border parishes, for the kirk-session, 
before absolving defaulters in this way, to require them to be proclaimed and re mar- 
ried. The usual practice now is, to make them acknowledge their marriage and irre- 
gularity in presence of the session, and, on evidence of their penitence, to restore them 
to privileges. Proclamation dues, however, arc still in all such cases, exacted by t lie 
session clerk,

Kelso : and probably few Kelsonians ever so far forget their filial 
love to their birth-place, even when by circumstances entirely se- 
parated from it, as not to connect it in their day dreams of the 
future with the fond aspiration, " Sit mihi sedes utinam senectae." 

IV. — Industry. 

As might be expected in a parish situate in the centre of a pure- 
ly agricultural district, the chief branches of industry are either 
agricultural labour, or those departments of the retail trade and of 
handicraft which lean upon agriculture. One or two manufactures, 
carried on with a view to a distant market, such as the currying of 
leather, and the making of coarse woollen cloth, employ a few hands ; 
but the great bulk of the people are employed in the preparation 
or retail of articles consumed in the district, and consist, as in other 
country towns, chiefly of labourers, shoemakers, bakers, butchers, 
cabinet-makers, carpenters, masons, &amp;c. The most numerous 
class of retail-shops are those of grocers and drapers. The number 
of members of the learned professions is 25 ; there being 6 minis- 
ters of the gospel, 8 medical practitioners, and 11 writers, exclu- 
sive of apprentices and clerks. 

Agriculture — Tillage and Pasture. — The total number of acres 
in the parish, standard imperial measure, is estimated at 4400. 
The whole may be said to be either cultivated, or occasionally in 
tillage, with the exception of the lawn at Floors, part of Spring- 
wood Park, and the Race-ground, recently reclaimed from a mo- 
rass, and now forming a valuable piece of pasture land. Even the 
first of these has recently come under the operation of the plough, 
though of course only with a view to its eventual productiveness 
and beauty, as permanent pasture. 

The total number of acres properly in tillage, is about 3800 
in permanent pasture, . 300 

There are no waste lands nor undivided common. 

Wood. — The number of acres strictly under wood, that is, in 
inclosed plantations, is about 215. But besides the plantations, 
there is, especially in the parks of Floors and Springwood, and in 
the planted dells of Pinnacle-hill and Wooden, a vast amount of 
fine timber which cannot be estimated in acres, being upon land 
under grass, or upon steep and broken ground ; to which must be 
added the hedge-row trees with which the parish, particularly on 
the south of the Tweed, is richly ornamented. The older wood 
consists, in great part, of oak, beech and ash ; in the young woods, 
fir predominates; but here also the harder timber is the growth 
chiefly aimed at, the firs being put in as nurses. The great bulk

• to 

being either old or very young wood, no opportunity is ;it present 
afforded for following any specific rule in management, with re- 
gard to thinning, felling, pruning, and the like. 

Rent of Arable Land. — The rent of land varies greatly in diffe- 
rent parts of the parish. This is due partly to difference of soil, 
and partly to greater or less vicinity to the town. Whilst the 
northern section of the parish consists of a rich black loam with a 
subsoil of gravel, and lies close around the town, the southern por- 
tion is both inferior, generally speaking, in quality, and of less va- 
lue, as being more distant and cut off from free access to the town, 
by the pontage on the Tweed. Accordingly, the annual rent of 
land on the north side of the river varies from L. 5 to L. 2, 10s. 
while that on the south takes the lower range of from L. 3 to 7s. 
The average of the whole may be stated at L, 2, 5s. 

Rent of Grazing. — The average rent for grazing a full-grown 
ox or cow is, L. 4 to L. 4, 10s. ; and for each ewe or sheep, these 
being here of a large description, 10s. 

Rate of Labour. — Masons and joiners receive from 2s. 6d. to 
3s. per day ; farm-labourers from Is. 6d. to Is. 8d. Spade labour 
upon farms is for the most part performed by contract or piece- 
work ; in which way a good labourer frequently earns from 2s. to 
2s. 6d. per day. Ploughmen in this parish generally married per- 
sons are engaged by the year, and receive as follows : in cash, 
L. 3, 10s. ; 10 bolls oats, which may be estimated at L. 9 ; 3 bolls 
barley, L. 3, 6s. ; 1 boll pease, L. 1, 8s. ; cow's grass and win- 
ter keep, L. 6 ; potatoes planted, L. 1, 10s. ; coals driven, L. 2, 
10s. ; L. 27, 4s. The ploughman is furnished with a house on the 
farm; but for this he provides a labourer in harvest, very often 
his wife, generally estimated at L. 2 ; and he is also taken bound, 
in virtue of the above allowances-, to maintain a female-labourer, 
distinguished on the marches by the name of a bondager, for 
whose services, when employed, he receives from 8d. to lOd. 
per day. 

Stock. — The usual breed of sheep reared and grazed in the pa- 
rish is that known as the improved Leicester, for which the sur- 
rounding district is famous. The cattle most common are of the 
short-horned or Teeswater breed. 

Husbandry. — The system of agriculture pursued is necessarily 
various in a parish where there are so many, great and small, as 
seventeen farms with homesteads, besides a number of smaller pos- 
sessions occupied by cowfeeders, carters, and. the like. The sys- 



KELSO. 329 

torn, however, in general application-, is that of the four and five- 
shift courses, the former predominating. Except upon those lands 
to the south of the Tweed which rest upon a retentive subsoil, 
turnips or potatoes in limited quantity, are taken as a fallow crop ; 
this is followed by wheat or barley, sown down with grass-seeds ; 
and when these grasses are taken up at the end of one or two 
years, as the case may be, an oat crop follows ; no manure being 
applied in the course of the rotation to any but the turnip crop or 
fallow. The manures generally employed are, besides common 
manure, lime and bone-dust. The average quantity of lime used 
annually is estimated at 843 tons ; the average quantity of bone- 
dust, 25 tons. As regards the improvements of which the husban- 
dry is susceptible, nothing very specific can be stated. The rich 
loam on the north of the Tweed, as also the lands on the south, 
which are upon a dry subsoil, are in the highest state of cultivation, 
and seemingly incapable of any additional improvement beyond 
what judicious management, and the application of suitable ma- 
nures, never fail to produce. But much of the wet and tilly soil 
in the southern section of the parish is, doubtless, notwithstanding 
the great and beneficial change which its present enterprising oc- 
cupants have of late years wrought upon it, still susceptible of ex- 
tensive amelioration from a more thorough application of draining 
and similar essential operations. 

Leases. — The general duration of leases is nineteen or twenty- 
one years. The only exception is in the case of small enclosures 
and crofts in the immediate vicinity of the town, which are let, for 
the most part, for a double rotation of crops. 

Farm-buildings, fyc. — The farm-buildings are generally substan- 
tial; in a few instances, tasteful and elegant. The implements of 
husbandry are likewise in accordance with the latest improvements. 
On one large farm, Spylaw, steam is employed as a moving power in 
the operations of thrashing, &amp;c. The whole parish is enclosed and 
subdivided into fields, generally by hedges, which, from the prac- 
tice of regularly cutting them with a bill, give the face of the coun- 
try a garden-like appearance. Where the fences are of stone, the 
walls are well-built, and sometimes coped with ruble-work. Alto- 
gether, the state of the parish, in reference to agriculture, may be 
justly described as worthy of a district, which has always kept pace 
with the rapid strides made by the country at large in this depart- 
ment of national industry, and which has long had the good for-

tune to possess a body of tenantry distinguished alike by their 
intelligence, enterprize, and capital. 

Fisheries. — The salmon-fisheries on this part of the Tweed have 
existed from a very remote period. At the foundation of the Ab- 
bey of Kelso, King David gave them to the monks, who seem to 
have carefully protected them ; though not more carefully than the 
land-owners whose property they became when the monastery was 
dissolved. The Kelso fishery yields an annual rent to the Duke of 
Roxburghe of L. 30 ; but this amount of rent is due less to the actual 
value of the produce, than to the income which the tacksman derives 
from hiring out his boats, &amp;c. to amateur sportsmen. The fish caught 
here are not sent beyond the Kelso market, which, indeed, con- 
sumes more than this fishery is adequate to supply. The fisheries 
on the Tweed are under the protection of commissioners and over- 
seers, appointed by act of Parliament, with whom it lies to appoint 
head and under water bailiffs for the different districts of the river. 
The river is open for salmon-fishing from 15th February to 7th 
November. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce raised 
is estimated as under : 

Potatoes and turnips. - L. 3,900 

Grain of all kinds, 1 1-560 

Hay; - 920 

Pasture, including permanent grass in parks, &amp;c. - 2,150 

Gardens and orchards, - 750 

Fisheries, ... - - 50 

L. 19,330 

Manufactures.— -It has been already stated that the manufac- 
tures of the parish are very limited. Though the number of 
branches is considerable, including the manufacture of leather, 
woollen-cloth, tobacco, the weaving of linen, stocking-making, and 
the making of hats, they do not give employment conjointly to 
more than 150 workmen ; nor, if we except the currying trade, 
which is carried on by one house very extensively, does any of 
them seem to be advancing. Some of them, as weaving and stock- 
ing-making, have indeed all but disappeared from the place. 

Associations. — Though there are no parochial societies for the 
encouragement of any branch of industry, Kelso has the benefit 
of several local associations of this description, which hold then- 
meetings and exhibitions in the town. Among these, the Union 
Agricultural Society is worthy of notice, from the stimulus it has 
given to the improvement of stock, agricultural implements, &amp;c.

on the border. It has a monthly exhibition of cattle, sheep, seed- 
corn, &amp;c. ; encourages ploughing matches ; offers prizes for me- 
chanical inventions connected with agriculture ; and numbers 
among its patrons and members all the leading landholders and 
farmers in Teviotdale, Berwickshire, and Northumberland. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Town, fyc. — Kelso is the market-town of the district as 
well as of the parish. It contains a population of about 4200, 
who, as formerly stated, are employed chiefly in the ordinary 
branches of retail and handicraft.  It has a daily market for 
butcher-meat, fish, and vegetables ; a weekly corn market ; and a 
monthly cattle and sheep-market. There are four bank agencies, 
and numerous handsome shops. . The principal transactions are 
those connected with the trade in corn, and the sale of stock ; and 
it is worthy of remark, that the business of the corn-market is car- 
ried on in the most primitive and inartificial manner, without bills, 
and even without accounts ; — it being the practice for the purchas- 
er to make payment in cash on the market day immediately fol- 
lowing that of the stipulated delivery of the article. 

Municipal Constitution. — Kelso is a burgh of barony ; but the 
sett is so peculiar as to justify us in here preserving some record 
of an ancient institute which the progress of municipal law will soon 
sweep away. 

Prior to the Reformation, the different lands and manors be- 
longing to the abbey formed a regality, over which the abbot ex- 
ercised the authority of a feudal baron. On the abolition of mo- 
nachism, the jurisdiction fell into the crown. But it was ultimate- 
ly transferred, under the title of the Lordship and Barony of Hal- 
lydean, to Kerr of Cessford — the first peer of the house of Rox- 
burghe. This transference took place in 1607; and in 1634, Kel- 
so, previously included in the lordship of Hallydean, was separat- 
ed and created into a free burgh of barony. The charter of crea- 
tion gives power to the superior and his heirs-male, in all time 
coming, to " receive and admit free burgesses," — to appoint 
" bailies, clerks, officers, and other members necessary for the 

_ Honourable mention is made in the former Statistical Aceount of an ingenious 
optician, John Gibson, who then carried on a considerable trade in Kelso, especial- 
ly in telescopes. There is now no artisan of this description. But there is at present 
an ingenious person who does a great deal of work in a line to the full as unusual in 
small country towns as that of making spy-glasses. This is Mr Heckford, a bird- 
stutler, whose performances, as seen in the Duke of Roxburghe's cnbinet of natural 
history, and in the museum of the Kelso Antiquarian Society, will bear a compari- 
son with those of the best London artists.

government of the burgh ;" — to " hold a weekly public market 
and two free fairs yearly for the space of eight days ;" — to " re- 
ceive and uplift the customs and duties thereof, and apply the same 
to the common good of the burgh ;" — and in general to " es- 
tablish such regulations as may be most conducive to the general 
good of the town and its inhabitants, the advancement of trade, and 
the encouragement of manufactures therein." The town seems 
to have been incorporated, and baron-bailies appointed from the 
date of the charter ; but there is no formal sett extant of older 
date than 1757, ten years after hereditary jurisdictions were abo- 
lished ; a sett which, with a few modifications established by long 
practice, forms the constitution under which the town is still go- 
verned. 

According to these regulations, the powers invested by the char- 
ter in the feudal lord are delegated after a manner specifically de- 
fined, to his bailie, certain corporate bodies, and fifteen stent-mas- 
ters. There are seven corporate bodies, the Merchant Com- 
pany, and the six crafts of Skinners, Weavers, Tailors, Shoemakers, 
Hammermen, and Fleshers. To these bodies is delegated the right 
of admitting freemen, and of preventing persons who do not pay 
the expense of entry, and otherwise conform to the rules, from 
carrying on business in the burgh ; and they are also empowered 
to elect each their respective preses or deacons. The powers vest- 
ed in the stent-masters have an exclusive reference to the admini- 
stration of the funds of the burgh, and, in particular, to the levy- 
ing and disbursement of a stent or tax, which is applied to the 
repairing of the streets and other burghal expenses. This tax 
they impose on the inhabitants according to the rentals of their 
properties, and the supposed value of their trades ; but be- 
fore levying it, the preliminary step must be gone through of 
presenting an estimate of the probable expenditure for the ensu- 
ing year to the bailie, whose approval and warrant are essential to 
enable the stent-masters to collect the stent, and with whom also 
it lies to judge of and determine all claims from exemption, as well 
as all appeals against the amount of stent imposed. These stent- 
masters are fifteen in number, of whom eight are nominated by 
the bailie ; the remaining seven consist of the preses for the time 
being of the Merchant Company and the deacons of the six crafts ; 
and they have power, in their collective capacity, to elect from their 
own number a preses and treasurer, and also to choose their own 
clerk and quarter-master. The principal officer, however, under 



KELSO.

tins constitution is the baron-bailie, who is the superior's deputy, 
and invested, during the pleasure of the latter, with the power of 
his principal. Besides the power of controlling the proceedings 
of the stent-masters already described, he has a right, whenever he 
thinks fit, to require them to exhibit their accounts. He is al- 
so the judge of all cases of dispute between the corporations and 
claimants for entry. In addition to which, he holds a weekly court 
within burgh as a magistrate, for the decision of civil cases, when 
the sum in dispute does not exceed L. 2, and of criminal actions 
of assault, battery, or petty theft, punishable by a fine not exceed- 
ing L. 1. He gives judgment also in possessory actions and se- 
questrations for rent, though his jurisdiction in such cases is found- 
ed upon prescriptive usage rather than on any express instruction 
in his commission ; and he is likewise expected " to take a gene- 
ral superintendence in all matters of police." 

Such is an outline of this somewhat peculiar and anomalous 
constitution. With respect to its actual working, it is not neces- 
sary to enter into detail. The right of nominating a majority of 
the stent-masters, and also of controlling all their acts, invests the 
bailie with a power which, in the hands of an indiscreet man, 
might be prostituted to oppressive ends, and which is in principle 
opposed to the genius of modern institutions. Yet in practice, the 
system has never occasioned complaint, — while the progressive im- 
provement of the town in all that relates to lighting, cleaning, 
supply of water, and general neatness, affords evidence that the 
unrestricted control of the town's funds vested in the bailie and 
stent-masters has not been abused. In fact, where evil has arisen 
to the community, it has been from the defectiveness of the bailie's 
power, not from its excess. There is no provision for defraying 
the expense of a body of police ; nor is the magistrate invested 
with those summary powers which are essential to the immediate 
punishment and prevention of crime. The want of an effective 
police is, accordingly, much felt; and though the bailie does keep 
one police officer, partly at his own cost, and is ever ready to 
interpose his authority in order to check riotous disturbances, the 
amount of disorderly conduct in general, and of juvenile delin- 
quency in particular, is not on the decrease. All experience proves 
that it is in such towns as Kelso that most of the offences tried in 
counties arise ; and there can be no doubt, that were the magistrates 
of such burghs invested at once with a summary jurisdiction over 
petty offences, and with a sufficient executive, it would be in their 



334 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



power, ,in very many instances, to crush crime in the bud, to arrest 
juvenile offenders at their outset on the path to ruin, and thus not 
only to secure the prosperity and peace of the community, but to 
effect a material saving in the expenditure now necessary for the 
prosecution of offences before higher tribunals. 

Town's-Funds. — The annual income of the burgh may be stat- 
ed at about L. 500. Its principal sources are : the stent on the 
inhabitants already described ; the proceeds of a tax on ale ; the 
price obtained for fuilzie ; the rent of a machine for weighing 
coals ; and the interest of a sum invested on Kelso Bridge. 

Villages. — The only village in the parish is Maxwell-heugh, 
which stands on a heugh or eminence on the south of the Tweed, 
directly opposite to the eastern part of the town. It contains 
about 100 inhabitants, and is a place of great antiquity. The 
Earl of Morton had a residence there in the time of Elizabeth. 

Means of Communication. — There are two post-office deliveries 
daily ; one when the bag from the south, and another when the 
bag from the north arrives. No mail-coach passes through Kelso ; 
but letter-carts or gigs regularly convey the bags to and from 
Hawick, where the mail passes. Turnpike roads, to the extent of 
twelve miles, intersect the parish, and connect it with all the sur- 
rounding towns, the principal being a branch of the great north road, 

 The following account of receipts and disbursements for a single year, as given 
in evidence before tbe burgh commissioners, will give a better idea both of the reve- 
nues of the burgh, and of the purposes to which they are applied, than any descrip- 
tion ; though it is but fair to premise, that the items of " cleaning streets" and " trades- 
men's accounts" are considerably above the average expenditure under these heads, 
in consequence of additional expenses arising in the year referred to, out of the pre- 
valence of cholera, &amp;c.

via Newcastle, to London. Stage-coaches run daily between Kelso 
and Edinburgh ; three times a-week between Kelso and Berwick ; 
and between Kelso and Hawick, taking Jedburgh on the way, twice 
a-week : There is also direct access daily to Newcastle and the 
south by a coach, which runs between Edinburgh and Newcastle. 
The means of conveying heavy goods, &amp;c. by carriers and wag- 
goners are ample ; there being 45 of these who come and go from 
Kelso weekly. The bridges are numerous, and constructed on the 
most approved principles of the art ; those across the Tweed and 
the Teviot, in particular, may vie with any similar works in the 
kingdom. The Kelso and Berwick railroad, from which such 
extensive benefits were long anticipated to Tweedside and Teviot- 
dale, has existed for the last twenty years in an act of Parliament, 
and in the pages of The Travellers' Guide : Why it does not yet 
exist in any more tangible and useful shape, and seems never likely 
to do so, is best known to the shareholders, who, judged from 
their past proceedings, appear to have been incorporated for the 
purpose of defeating, not of carrying into effect, the provisions of 
an act of Parliament. 

Ecclesiastical State. — Parish Church. — The present church was 
erected in 1773, and is a commodious and conveniently situated, 
though somewhat inelegant building. In external shape, it is a 
regular octagon, flanked by two ample porches, which abut from 
the north and south sides ; and it is surmounted by an immense 
roof of blue slate, tapering to a point somewhat after the fashion 
of a marquee, and supported by a circle of eight pillars within the 
building. Its internal figure was also octagonal up to 1823, when, 
with the view of improving it as a place of hearing, an alteration 
was made, which at once deranged its internal symmetry and di- 
minished its area to the extent of 1153 feet. The loss of ac- 
commodation thus incurred was in a good measure compensat- 
ed in 1833 by seating a passage which ran round the lower area 
of the church. But it is to be lamented that, instead of thus con- 
tenting themselves with a limited repair, the heritors had not, in 
1823, adopted apian of improving the church, furnished by Mr 
Gillespie Graham, which would have augmented, instead of cur- 
tailing the accommodation, and cost only from L. 1100 to L. 1200 
more than the alterations actually executed. The two principal 
heritors, on whom conjointly would have fallen nearly two-thirds 
of the whole expense, were in favour of the rejected plan, and 
were willing, besides, to contribute their proportion towards build- 



330 



JiOXBTJRGHSIIlR E. 



ing a church-spire, which is much wanted in a parish where there 
is no place for suspending bells ; but their liberal design was over- 
ruled by the opposition of the smaller heritors, who, for the paltry 
saving of L. 420, the whole sum which the execution of Mr 
Graham's plan would have cost them, resisted an improvement 
which would have been of great and permanent advantage to the 
parish and the public. 

The church is seated to contain 1314; but in consequence of 
the polygonal shape of many of the pews, the number which it 
actually accommodates is under 1300. The whole sittings are 
allocated to the landward heritors, with the exception of those set 
apart for the minister, session, schoolmaster, and choir, and 187, 
which have been allotted to the incorporated trades, in considera- 
tion of a contribution made by them towards seating the church. 
The inhabitants of the town, though forming five-sixths of the 
whole parishioners, have, with this exception, no right to'sittings 
other than the good will of heritors, who happen to have more 
church-room than is necessary for the occupants of their land. Yet 
this disadvantage is less felt than might be expected, in conse- 
quence of the liberality of the only land-owner having a surplus- 
age of church-room, the Duke of Roxburghe, who has of late years 
delegated to the kirk-session the power of assigning his surplus 
seats — about one-third of the church, to the people of the town. 

Manse. — The manse was built in 1801, and extensively repaired 
at the entry of the present incumbent in 1832. It is a large and 
commodious house; and beautifully situate on an open space of 
ground between the town and the Tweed, — having the abbey im- 
mediately behind it, and the glebe bounded by one of the very 
finest portions of the river, in front. 

Glebe. — The glebe is understood to contain about six acres, ex- 
clusive of the site of the manse, the manse garden, and a portion 
let as a wood-yard. Its value, including all these pertinents, to- 
gether with an annual allowance of L. 4, 15s. from the trustees 
of Kelso-Bridge, in lieu of a part cut off by the approach to the 
bridge, may be estimated at from L. 50 to L. 60. There is 
no grass glebe ; but the minister has a prescriptive right to the 
grass of a plot of meadow called the Knowes, which adjoins the 
church-yard, and originally formed part of the ground used as butts 
for archery. From this right he has, however, of late years de- 
rived no benefit; as the Knowes have become the play-ground

of the grammar school, as well as the chief resort in virtue of his 
written sanction for the stated exhibitions of agricultural stock, &amp;c. 

Stipend. — The stipend is 51 bolls of oatmeal and 56 bolls of bear, 
with L. 193, 2s. 5d. in money. The Court of teinds awarded, in 
their first scheme of locality, a stipend larger than this by about 
L. 70 ; but the above is all that the teinds, when surrendered, were 
found to yield. Nor would the stipend have reached its present 
amount, had not the proprietor of the lands of Maisondieu, ori- 
ginally hospital lands, and, as such, supposed to be exempt from 
teind — failed to prove that they had been feued cum decimis in- 
clusis et nunquam antea separatis, previously to the act of annexa- 
tion in 1587. These lands having been left unvalued, the court 
found that they were liable to pay one-fifth of their real rent as 
stipend. 

Divine Service, fyc. — In the parish church, divine service is 
performed twice every Sunday throughout the year. The sacra- 
ment of the Lord's Supper is administered twice a-year, viz. on the 
last Sundays of February and July. The number of elders, each of 
whom superintends a defined section of the parish, is at present 
8. The number of communicants is about 1200. 

Additional Church. — A deficiency of church-room in con- 
nexion with the Establishment has recently been supplied by the 
erection of a second church. This church, which is just com- 
pleted, is situate on the north-side of the town, in a field which, 
from its elevation and exposure, renders the building, with its ele- 
gant Gothic tower, one of the most prominent objects in the sce- 
nery of Kelso. Besides a church capable of accommodating 800 
persons, there is a suite of spacious school-rooms, which form the 
ground-floor of the building, and are designed for the use of an 
infant and juvenile school ; while the surrounding field is fitted up 
as a play-ground for the scholars, or tastefully laid out as a pleas- 
ance to the church. By the constitution granted by the General 
Assembly, it is provided that, on the settlement of a minister, a 
section of the town and suburbs shall be disjoined from the ori- 
ginal parish quoad spiritualia, and assigned to the new church as 
a parish ecclesiastical ; and that for the better accommodation of 
the poorer classes, one-half of the whole church-room shall be let 
at an annual rate not exceeding 3s. a sitting. The appointment 
of the minister is to rest, during the infancy of the congregation, 
with four individuals named in the constitution ; but it is ultimately 
to devolve on the kirk-session and male communicants ;— the for- 



338 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



mer enjoying the right of nominating the candidates not less 
than four, from whom the latter are to elect the minister. A 
bond for a stipend of L. 80 must be lodged with the presbytery 
before a minister can be inducted ; but the stipend is not to be li- 
mited to the sum secured by bond, if the seat-rents and collections, 
the only sources of revenue provided for in the constitution, afford a 
larger income. For an addition to its ecclesiastical and education- 
al edifices, which has not been completed under a cost fabric and 
site included of less than L. 3460, Kelso is mainly indebted to a 
native of the parish, — Mr James Nisbet, Berners' Street, Lon- 
don, with whom the design originated, and by whose munificence 
chiefly it has been carried into execution. The splendid donation of 
L. 1500 to the object forms only one item of the amount of this 
gentleman's benefits to the new church and parish. Among the 
benevolent persons who have co-operated with Mr Nisbet, a pro- 
minent place is due to three of the elders — Mr John Henderson, 
Mr Robert Williamson, and Mr Alexander Leadbetter, who, be- 
sides their liberal donations to the funds, have devoted much time 
and labour to the superintendence of the work. The Duke of 
Buccleuch, Mr Alderman Pirie, and Alexander Gordon, Esq. of 
London, ought also to be mentioned as large contributors. And 
it would be unjust to the parishioners generally to withhold the fact, 
that their united contributions directly to the object have amounted 
to L. 508.  

Religious Denominations. — Besides the Established Church, 
there are five other religious bodies which have places of worship 
in the town, viz. the Episcopal Communion, the Reformed Pres- 
byterians, the Original Seceders, the United Secession, and the 
Relief. The Methodists and Quakers, mentioned in the former 
Account, have disappeared, though the latter body still retain the 
right to use their former meeting-house for religious purposes. 
An Episcopal congregation has existed in Kelso from the time of 
the Revolution. The present meeting house of the Original Se- 
ceders was erected in 1772 ; that of the United Secession in 1787; 
that of the Relief, originally an off-shoot from the last-mentioned 
congregation, in 1792. The ministers of all these bodies are paid 

• Although the new church and schools are now open, a minister and teacher ap- 
pointed, and a new parish ecclesiastical allocated, the church was opened on 26th 
November 1837, no account is given in this paper of the changes which are being 
introduced into the parish by the new parochial arrangements. 1 ndeed, considering 
the necessarily immature state of arrangements so recently commenced, this would 
have been scarcely practicable, even bad it not been wholly precluded by the «roum. 
stance, that the materials embodied in the present account were chiefly collected in 
1836.

from the proceeds of seat rents and collections, with the exception 
of the Episcopal clergyman, whose stipend is derived from a volun- 
tary assessment upon the members of the congregation. Allof 
them, with the same exception, have manses. Their stipends vary, 
with the numbers and wealth of the congregations, from L. 200 to 
L. 50, and are, so far as has been ascertained, as follows : minister 
of United Secession, L. 200 ; minister of the Relief, L. 150 ; 
minister of the Original Seceders, L. 50. As respects the time and 
diets of public worship, &amp;c. the Dissenters follow nearly the same 
rule as the Established Church. There is divine service, generally 
speaking, every Lord's day, as also two distinct diets, excepting dur- 
ing the winter half-year, when a double diet without any interval is 
adopted. The Lord's Supper is likewise dispensed in the two most 
numerous congregations on the same days as in the Established 
Church; andin the othersitis dispensed with equal frequency, though 
not generally at the same times. The United Secession and Relief 
congregations number among their members many persons of great 
respectability in point of wealth as well as character, and the Sab- 
bath attendance is not only respectable but numerous, considering 
the distances which many of the members have to travel. One 
of them — the United Secession, is composed of persons collected 
from so many as thirteen parishes. 

The following table exhibits the accommodation of the va- 
rious places of worship, together with the number of persons in the 
parish of all ages connected with each denomination respectively, 
as ascertained by a census taken in 1835 :

Religious Societies.— The societies established for the purposes 
of Christian charity are, the Kelso Bible Society, which gives the 
most of its funds to the Edinburgh Bible Society, the Kelso 
Missionary Society, auxiliary to the Scottish Missionary Society, 
the parish Society for the spread of the Gospel, its funds have 
been applied to the support of a parochial missionary,— and the 
Society for the Missions of the United Secession Church. The 
first two are supported by Christians of various denominations ; 
the last two, as their designations import, by members of the Esta-

Wished Church, and of the United Secession respectively. The 
average income of each society may be rated as follows ; Bible So- 
ciety, L.38; Missionary Society, L. 13; Parish Society, L. 60; 
Secession Missions, L. 65. The sums raised by these societies do 
not exhaust the contributions of the parish to missionary and re- 
ligious purposes. Various stated and occasional collections, both 
in the Established and Dissenting churches, fall to be added, 
especially the annual collections in the former, in aid of the four 
missionary schemes of the General Assembly, which have hitherto 
averaged upwards of L. 50. 

Education — Schools. — The total number of week-day schools is 
10 ; viz. a grammar school and an English school, both parochial; 
a side-school for the southern division of the parish, provided with 
school room and schoolmaster's house, at the expense of two of the 
heritors; the Roxburghe school for girls, taught by a female, 
and similarly provided at the charge of the Duke of Roxburghe ; 
the Friendly school, supported by an educational society; and five 
private schools, undertaken on the adventure of the masters. 
There are also two boarding-schools for young ladies, as likewise 
a similar institution for young gentlemen, kept by the rector of the 
grammar school. 

Branches taught. — The branches generally taught in these 
schools are the elements of reading, writing, and arithmetic. In 
the Roxburghe school, the girls are taught sewing along with the 
ordinary branches. In the grammar-school, the Latin and Greek 
classics are taught together with French, geography and mathe- 
matics ; whilst in the ladies' seminaries the ornamental branches 
of education, as music, drawing, &amp;c. may be acquired in addition 
to the elementary. Though several of the teachers are persons 
of liberal education, the modes of tuition generally followed do 
not differ materially from those which have been in use for the 
last forty years ; nor in the instances in which the analytical sys- 
tem has been introduced, does there exist any very flattering pro- 
spect of its permanent adoption. The emoluments of most of the 
schools are so slender that well qualified teachers remain in them 
only till they can obtain better appointments, and it often happens 
that a teacher versant in the modern improvements of his art is 
succeeded by one who is but slenderly, or not at all acquainted 
with them. 

Emoluments. — The rector of the grammar-school is the only 

teacher who has the maximum salary and the legal accommoda-

tion. The English master has no house, and, excepting a salary 
of L. 5, lis. Id. paid in equal parts by the heritors and burgh, and 
the interest of a mortification of L. 240, as a remuneration for 
teaching poor scholars recommended by the kirk-session, is de- 
pendent exclusively upon school fees. The only other teachers 
who have salaries are the mistress of the Roxburghe School, who 
has an income secured to her including school fees of L. 24 ; 
and the master of the Friendly School, who is in like manner gua- 
ranteed, whatever sum is necessary to supplement the penny-a- 
week fees of the children up to L. 40. The unendowed teachers 
are understood to have their school-wages but indifferently paid ; 
nor probably does the most popular of them, after deducting 
school-rent, realize an annual income exceeding L. 50. 

School Fees. — The school fees charged at the grammar school 
are, for the classics, 10s. per quarter, and for mathematics, 10s. 
6d. ; at the parochial English school for reading, 3s. 6d. ; writing, 
4s. 6d. ; arithmetic, 6s. 6d. ; at the private schools for reading, 3s. ; 
writing, 4s. ; arithmetic, 5s.; practical mathematics, 7s. 6d.; at the 
Roxburghe and Friendly Schools, reading, writing, and arithmetic, 
Id. per week. 

Decreasing desire for Education. — There are probably few per- 
sons in the parish between six and fifteen years of age who can- 
not partially read and write. Yet the state of school attendance, 
during the last few years, is far from indicating a very lively de- 
sire on the part of the commonalty for the benefits of education. 
Not only has there been a gradual falling off in the number of 
classical pupils, — unhappily common to this district with the whole 
country, but the average attendance on the English schools ex- 
hibits a progressive decrease. In 1833, the total number of pu- 
pils in attendance on all the schools of the parish, boarding-schools 
included, was 725. In 1834, the number had increased to 765 ; 
but in 1835 it was only 690 ; while in 1836 another diminution 
had taken place, the number being 664. Part of this deficiency 
is no doubt explained, though but a small part, by a growing prac- 
tice among the wealthier classes, of having their children taught 
at home by masters who come in for a few hours daily ; and some- 
thing may be also due to the increasing poverty of many of the 
people, as well as to the notion not yet obsolete, that a mere abi- 
lity to read and write constitutes education, and that, consequent- 
ly, the merest scantling of school instruction will suffice. But 
these causes do not account for the whole evil. A growing in-

difference to the value of early education lies, it is to be feared, at 
the root of the evil — an indifference strengthened by the loss of 
self-respect, which a habit of asking and taking indiscriminate 
charity engenders, and not dispelled by the spectacle of the salu- 
tary working of a thoroughly enlightened and energetic system of 
tuition. It is to be hoped that the infant and juvenile schools 
connected with the new church will be conducted in a manner 
fitted at once to enlighten the popular mind on the subject of 
education, and arrest that tendency to apathy with regard to its 
benefits now too palpably discernible. Yet considering how diffi- 
cult it is to raise by voluntary contribution, an adequate and regu- 
lar provision for competent teachers, the philanthropist cannot be 
sanguine of much amelioration, until clearer symptoms display 
themselves of a disposition on the part of the legislature to make 
liberal provision both for normal and primary schools. 

Sunday Schools.— Besides the week-day, there are 6 Sunday 
schools ; 4 connected with the Established Church, and 2 be- 
longing to the Secession and Relief congregations respectively. 
Originally there was but one school, attended by children of all 
denominations, which was held first in the parish Church, and 
afterwards removed to the Secession meeting-house; but for 
many years past, the division into Church and Dissenting schools 
has 'obtained, as also that of the former, into male and female 
schools. The average number of Sunday scholars may be stated 
at 500, of which 300 belong to the Church, and 200 to the Dis- 
senters. By far the most important of these schools, in point both 
of numbers and efficiency, is the girls' school conducted by ladies, 
members of the Establishment. Under the head of Sunday 
schools may be enumerated, though they meet on a week-day 
evening, two weekly classes, connected with the parochial congre- 
gationrone, a class of candidates for admission to the Lord's Sup- 
per, the other, a normal class of Sunday-school teachers. 

Literature— Libraries.— Kelso is rich in libraries. The prin- 
cipal of these, " the Kelso Library," has existed since 1750, and 
now contains a collection of about 5000 volumes, including many 
standard English works in all departments of literature. In com- 
mon with the commodious building in which it is kept, it is the 
property of about seventy shareholders, by whose subscriptions it 
is supported, and to whom the books are accessible. « The New 
Library," and « The Modern Library" are also the property of 
joint-stock companies. They were founded in 1778 and 1800, and 



KELSO. 



343 



already contain about 2000 and 1500 volumes respectively, chiefly 
of modern works. There is also a Sunday school library con- 
nected with the Established Church ; a congregational library be- 
longing to the Relief Church ; besides three sections of the East 
Lothian Itinerating Libraries, which were lately introduced for the 
use of the working classes, principally through the exertions of the 
present minister of the United Secession congregation. In con- 
nexion with libraries may be mentioned a Book-club, consisting 
of twenty-four members, some of them extra-parochial, who con- 
tribute each a guinea annually for the purchase of books, which are 
circulated among the members, and sold at the end of the year, — 
the proceeds of the sale going to augment the means of purchas- 
ing books. This Club has existed for many years ; and has very 
materially contributed, both by the kind of works it has circulated, 

and by the intercourse it has kept up among the members to 

maintain a taste for literature in the town and neighbourhood. 

Scientific Societies. — " The school of arts," which gave rise to 
some interesting courses of lectures on chemistry and mathematics 
from 1825 to 1828, is no longer in existence. But the basis of 
a scientific institution, destined, it is hoped, to be longer-lived, has 
recently been laid in the " Kelso Physical and Antiquarian Society," 
which, though its object is restricted, in the meantime, to the 
formation of a museum of natural history and antiquities, may per- 
haps ere long turn the collection to some useful purpose, by ingraft- 
ing upon it a lecture or demonstration on some subject of philo- 
sophical or historical interest. The name of the eminent person 
at the head of the society, Sir Thomas M. Brisbane, Bart, may be 
regarded as a pledge that something more is eventually contem- 
plated than a mere repository of archaiological relics and physi- 
cal rarities ; while the eminent success which has attended their 
labours in this, the preliminary department, ought, doubtless, to 
encourage the directors to adventure on an attempt to compass 
the ulterior object also. 

Beading-Rooms.— -There are two reading-rooms for newspapers 
in the town ; one of considerable standing, belonging to a select 
society of gentlemen ; and one, of recent date, open to all who 
pay the annual subscription. It is to the honour of the latter that, 
by an express regulation, it is shut on the Lord's day. 

Neivspapers, Sfc— The « Kelso Mail" and the "Kelso Chroni- 
cle" newspapers are printed and published in Kelso, the for- 
mer twice, the latter once a-week. The « Chronicle" was esta- 



344 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



Wished for the advocacy of political reform in 1832 : the " Mail," 
a Conservative journal, has existed since 1797, having been pro- 
jected and, for a time, conducted by the late Mr James Ballantyne, 
who commenced in Kelso his career as a printer. Various news- 
papers and other periodical works have issued from the Kelso press 
since 1783, when " the Kelso Chronicle," the first newspaper in 
the south of Scotland, was commenced ; but, with the exception of 
that journal, which lasted for eighteen years, and another newspa- 
per, the " Kelso Weekly Journal," which existed from 1808to 1829, 
none of them have been successful. It is creditable, however, to 
the literary enterprize of the place, that so many attempts have 
been made : and it will ever serve to connect the name of Kelso 
with literature, that its press produced the first edition of « The 
Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border." 

Charitable and Economic Institutions— Dispensary— The oldest 
of our charitable institutions is the Kelso Dispensary, which was 
established in 1777, for the benefit of the sick poor of the town 
and district, principally through the philanthropic exertions of the 
late Hon. Mrs Baillie of Mellerstain and the late Dr C. Douglas of 
Kelso. This institution is supported by voluntary contributions ; 
its accumulated capital, however, being now at length so consider- 
able as to make it independent of any very large amount of an- 
nual subscriptions. Patients are, under certain limitations, visited 
at their own houses, by the surgeons of the institution; and, in 
the institution-house, there are both wards for fever patients, and 
rooms for the performance of surgical operations ; to which have 
recently been added water and vapour baths, accessible, at a spe- 
cified charge, to the public generally. The following table which, 
with the valuable explanatory remarks and notes appended to it, 
has been obligingly , furnished by the respected physician to the 
Dispensary, exhibits the number of patients, and of the principal 
diseases, registered during the first five and the last five years of 
the institution.

" In the last series of five years, there have been above 100 
cases of scarlatina ; — in the first series none are recorded. 

" The years 1 780-81-82 were very severe upon the lower classes, 
as want added its attendant evils to the inclemencies of the sea- 
sons. Besides the heavy list of fever and ague, 21 cases of scurvy 
occurred ; and I have no doubt are correctly stated, as two of the 
medical gentlemen had served abroad, and were familiar with the 
disease. 

" In comparing the first and the last series of years, it will be 
noticed, that ague has almost disappeared, while fever, though 
much diminished in its proportion, still holds its place as the most 
common disease of our district. It is at all times difficult to trace 
the immediate cause of fever, which probably originates in some 
specific malaria ; but we have evidence that, once generated, it 
may be communicated from one person to another not exposed 
to the same noxious miasma which produced it. Marshes and 
wet ground alone are not necessary to the production of malaria, 
or many of the pestilential plains of Italy would be freed from 
disease. 

" The cases of asthma have diminished, while rheumatism has 
increased. The additional comforts and improved living of the 
lower classes, we should have expected, would have produced a 
beneficial effect upon both. The removal of ague was likely to 
have diminished the cases of dropsy; it is not a very common dis- 
ease among us, but as frequent as formerly. It is a curious fact 
that stone m the bladder is almost unknown in the district, with 
the exception of one or two families, where it has existed as a he- 
reditary disease."

merly existed in the parish, but have all either been dissolved, or

are in the course of dissolution, in consequence of the erroneous 
principles, in respect to the proportion between the rate of admission 
and the rate of allowance, on which they were based. Nor is there 
any prospect of the speedy formation of new ones on sounder princi- 
ples. The only beneficiary schemes of a similar nature now existing 
are the " Yearly Societies," — four in number, — which are formed 
with the view of assisting their members when sick, and dissolved and 
reorganized every year. Each member contributes weekly the 
sum of Is. 2d., together with 6d. a year for the expenses of ma- 
nagement, 6d. on the death of a member, and 3d. on the death 
of a member's wife. A member, when laid aside from work by 
sickness, receives 4s. per week for the first three months, and 2s. 
for the next three months — the allowance not falling lower than 
this. On the death of a member, his widow is allowed, as funeral 
expenses, a sum at the rate of 6d. from each member ; on the 
death of a member's wife, he is allowed 3d. from each. The only 
impediment to the beneficial operation of these simple but useful 
institutions is the practice, which cannot be too soon abandoned, 
of holding their monthly meetings in public-houses, and spending 
their fines on drink, instead of applying them to the increase of 
the funds. 

Saviigs Bank.— The want of benefit societies is, to some ex- 
tent, supplied by a Savings bank, which has existed since 1815, 
having been the first that was organized in Scotland on the model 
of that of Ruthwell. This bank is managed gratuitously by the 
agent of the Commercial Bank, Mr John Waldie, who devotes 
some hours every week to it. Any sum from L. 2 to L. 10 is re- 
ceived,— the only limitation being, that whenever and as often as 
the deposit amounts to the latter sum it is withdrawn, and lodged 
in the Commercial Bank upon a deposit receipt in the depositor's 
name. The average sum invested yearly amounts to L. 517, 15s. ; 
the average sum withdrawn, L. 474, 4s. Id. : the average sum 
lodged with the Commercial Bank, L. 230 ; the average number 
of depositors, 49. The depositors are chiefly servant girls, la- 
bourers, and young persons ; and it is pleasing to notice, that the 
amount of business done is regularly, though slowly, increasing. 
The amount lodged at 31st December 1838 was L. 908, 9s.; and 
the number of accounts open, 223. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— There are in this parish four 
sources of maintenance for the poor, viz. assessment, church-col- 
lections, mortified money, and charitable donations. 



KELSO. 



347 



I. A compulsory assessment has existed since 1796.  This 
assessment is fixed by the heritors, kirk-session, and proprietors 
of houses, on the real rent of lands and houses, — one-half being 
leviable from the landlord, and the other half from the tenant. 
Two meetings are held yearly, at Whitsunday and Martinmas, for 
the purpose of fixing the rate, and also of revising the poors' roll, 
deciding upon the claims of applicants for relief, and auditing the 
accounts. These last are kept, as well as the general business 
relating to pauperism conducted, by a stipendiary overseer, with 
the assistance of two subordinate officers, a collector and distribu- 
tor ; and, to dispose of urgent cases that may arise in the interval 
between the general meetings, a committee, including the parish 
minister and one or more of the elders, is regularly appointed at 
the half-yearly meetings. It should be added, that, besides the 
regular pensions, a considerable proportion of the funds is given 
in the shape of interim supply to paupers who are not on the re- 
gular roll, or who, though on the roll, require, from temporary 
causes, additional relief ; — a mode of administration which expe- 
rience proves to be attended with the double advantage, of keep- 
ing down the numbers on the roll, and meeting necessitous cases 
without incurring the risk of making them permanently paupers. 
The average annual assessment for the last twenty years during 

 A voluntary assessment has existed from 1737. The minutes bear, that, in order 
to obtemper an act of the Sheriff and Justices of the Pe,:ce, passed in the year 1737, 
for the regulation and maintenance of the poor, the heritors and kirk-session, in that 
year, appointed the elders and others to perambulate the parish, and bring in a " list 
of the poor, aged, sick, lame, and impotent, all orphans, and other poor children 
within the parish ;" as also, two overseers to superintend the collection and distribu- 
tion of the funds, and a collector to serve under them. They likewise appointed the 
same persons to ascertain what persons would volunteer to give weekly for the sup- 
port of the poor, with certification, " that all who were known to be able, and would 
not do it willingly, would be stented;" and, in addition, they chose " three fencible 
men for carrying off and removing from the place all vagrant and stranger-poor that 
may infest it, or be found troublesome." In 1737, when this plan was commenced, 
the whole sum necessary for the weekly support of the poor, including wages of the 
collector, was L. 24, 8s. Scots ; of which sum the landward heritors agreed to take 
upon them one half, conform to their respective valuations; the other half being 
made up by the feuars and inhabitants of the town, who, however, were to have for 
their relief, as far as they would go, the collections at the kirk-door, and the annual 
rent of the money lent out by the session for the use of the poor. Though this 
system continued with modifications on to 1796, it never seems to have worked well. 
Though the collection was made weekly in sums, as appears by the stent-rolls still 
preserved, not exceeding, in the majority of cases, one half-penny Sterling, large ar- 
rears were speedily accumulated, and the greatest difficulty encountered in keeping 
the funds up to the growing demands. The sum necessary for relief did not rise very 
rapidly, but it steadily advanced. By the year 1760 the number of pensioners on 
the roll was 60, and the sum disbursed among them L. 110, 16s. ; in 1770 the sum 
was L. 122, 10s. 4d. ; and in 1792 it was L. 276, 13s. 8J. It was this constant ad- 
vance of the rate, together with the increasing difficulty of collecting the contribu- 
tions of the town's-people, which induced the heritors to have recourse, in 1796, to 
the present compulsory system. 



348

which the amount has not very greatly varied lias been about 
L. 850,— the lowest in 1826 being about L. 700, the highest 
1836 rather more than L. 1000. The average number of pen- 
sioners on the roll for the same period of years is 130. The 
average number of persons receiving interim supply, including 
those on roll, 73. The average allowance of each person, man, 
woman, and child, on the roll, including interim supply, Is. 8d. 
weekly ; the average allowance to each individual not on the roll, 
in the shape of interim supply, L. 2 annually.  

2. The church collections, including in them a proportion of 
the fees for proclamations, &amp;c. and the trifling rent of L. 1, paid 
by the convenery for being allowed to provide and hire out the 
mortcloths, amount at present, after deducting the allowances 
made to precentor, session-clerk, church-officers, &amp;c. to L. 85. 
Prior to 1796, one-half of these collections was paid over to the 
heritors, to be applied by them and the session conjointly to the 
relief of the poor. But since the establishment of a compulsory 
rate, the whole collection has been wisely left at the disposal of 
the session, who apply it to the relief of such cases of urgent and 
temporary distress as cannot well be met by the slower and more 
formal process of an application to the heritors or their committee. 
The distribution is made weekly, in the several districts of the 
parish, by the elders, who, from their intimate knowledge of the 
people, can have a regard to the moral character as well as the 
physical necessities of applicants. And there is no doubt that the 
largeness of the collections— for they are large compared with the 
average collections in assessed parishes,— is due in no small de- 
gree to the well-founded persuasion among the congregation, that 
the fund is wisely and kindly administered. 

3. The mortified money applicable to the relief of the poor, 
consists of five bequests made at different periods by individuals 
connected with the parish. Three of these, Jamieson's, Sloan's, 
and Dickson's, which are under the administration of the heritors 

 It is believed that, in giving to proprietors of houses a co-ordinate power with 
heritors and elders in imposing the assessment, and also in taking the real rent as the 
basis of assessment, the usage of this parish is somewhat peculiar, if not of doubtful 
competence. The power conceded to proprietors of houses, however, is found to 
operate most beneficially in keeping down the assessment ; as these individuals, from 
their residence among the people, and knowledge of their wants, possess the certain 
means of sifting all applications, and detecting imposture. The other practice allud- 
ed toltha t o  taking the « real rent," rather than « means and substance," as the 
bis so7 the assessment, is not so unexceptionable. It presses very ""equally, ."-much

and kirk-session, yield together an annualrent of L. 17, 10s., and 
the remaining two, Jonathan Waldie's, administered by the bailie 
and minister; and Leadbetter's, administered by the ministers of 
all denominations, yield at present an annual interest of L. 18. 
The items are as under : 

Jamieson's legacy of L. 200 at 5 per cent. - L. 10 0 0 

Sloane's - 100 2| - 2 10 0

Leadbetter's - 200 4 - 8 0 0 



L. 35 10 0 

4. To these various fixed sources of relief mustbe added the sums 
supplied by the public f bounty of individuals, which, though ne- 
cessarily varying in amount in different years, cannot be rated at a 
lower average than L. 100. J These donations are generally given, 
in whole or in part, in coals, meal, &amp;c. and are administered by va- 
rious persons, according to the appointment of the donors. 

Putting- together all the above-mentioned resources, the annual 
amount applicable to the wants of the poor in the parish cannot be 
estimated much below L. 1300; a sum greatly exceeding what is 
expended for the same purpose in most Scottish parishes of 5000 
population. Yet it must be remembered that the" peculiar cir- 
cumstances of Kelso, if they do not vindicate, sufficiently explain 
such an expenditure. Irrespective of its vicinity to England, 
which brings to bear upon it the ill example of an excessive poor- 
rate, its situation, as the metropolis of a wide rural district, neces- 
sarily exposes it to a constant influx of indigent persons, by making- 
it the resort, in their declining years, of infirm labourers as well as 
of widows and sickly females who, after a few years residence, 
frequently come in for a share of its charities and even of its pen- 
sions. The largeness, too, of the provision for the poor, taken in 

• Under the head of fixed supplies ought perhaps to be included a corporation 
fund, averaging about L. 18 yearly, which arises from the fees of entrants, &amp;c. This 
fund is divided annually, at the discretion of the office-bearers of the corporations, 
among poor members, or the indigent families of deceased members. 

f This term is employed to distinguish the donations in question from private 
charity, which of course cannot be included in the present account. 

+ Durin g the unusually severe winter of 1836-7, the class of donations referred 
to more than doubled this sum, as the following list will show : 

Duke of Itoxburghe's donation, 4 oxen, - L. 60

connexion with the indiscriminate manner in which the " public" 
beneficence of individuals is in some instances distributed, tends to 
the same result, as it operates as a lure to improvident persons, and 
especially to the gipsy tribe, to settle in the place ; while the en- 
tire disappearance, among a portion of the commonalty, of that 
honourable pride which makes it painful for a man either to re- 
ceive parish relief himself, or to allow his relatives to receive it, 
serves both to perpetuate the evil of which it is itself one of the 
worst fruits, and to render all attempts to abate it next to hopeless. 
These considerations account but too satisfactorily for the growth 
and cost of pauperism in Kelso ; though they do not render it the 
less a subject of lamentation, that there should be nearly one-tenth 
of the whole population dependent for their subsistence mainly 
upon public charity, and reduced to such an abject condition, 
morally and physically, as to form almost an inferior caste in the 
social system. 

Mendicity. — If we except the case of a few of the parish poor, 
who are allowed to go round the town, of a Saturday, for a small 
gratuity, which particular families are in the habit of bestowing 
on them, there is scarcely such a thing as a beggar to be seen 
on the streets of Kelso ; a result due to the good offices of the 
Society for the Suppression of Mendicity, which has been in 
operation since 1829. The plan pursued by this society is very 
simple. Having in view at once to suppress mendicity, and to re- 
lieve the really necessitous wanderer, it maintains an office in a 
central part of the town, where mendicants non-parishioners are 
required to apply ; and a constable, whose business it is to keep 
the office, enter the names and description of the applicants in a 
register kept for the purpose, grant a small relief in money, or 
provide a night's lodging in an orderly lodging-house, according 
to their necessities, — and, above all, to take care that, when relieved, 
they shall forthwith leave the town. The office, constable, and 
register are, however, but the external machinery of the institution. 
Its vital principle is the pledge under which its members come, 
not to give charity to any vagrants who may apply at their houses 
or shops. The extent to which this pledge is kept is, in fact, the 
measure as well as the source of the society's success in compas- 
sing its object ; and if it has hitherto failed in totally suppressing 
mendicity, the blame lies with the false "humanity or too great fa- 
cility of inhabitants who persist in throwing away their alms on 
« sturdy beggars." As it is, the « ancient craft" of begging is

happily at a discount in the parish ; and so long as the society is 
supported, there is little likelihood of its ever again coming out 
in evidence before the Sheriff of the county, as it did not very 
many years ago, that a day's begging in Kelso was, in the hands 
of " a canny gaberlunzie," worth " good 14s." It may be useful, 
as an evidence at once of the judicious management of the society, 
and of the small expense at which important civic ameliorations 
may sometimes be effected, to append the following statement of 
the number of vagrants relieved, and the total cost of management

Prison. — The only place for the confinement of delinquents is 
a lock-up house, the property of the burgh, which is employed 
chiefly for the temporary incarceration of vagrants. 

Fairs. — Besides cattle-markets every second Friday of the month, 
from April to February inclusive, there are three horse fairs on the 
first, third, and fourth Fridays of March, and a fair for both cattle 
and horses on the second Friday of March ; but the chief fair, cal- 
led St James's, the most ancient and one of the best attended on 
the border, takes place on the 5th of August. It is held on St 
James's Green, near the site of the ancient church of St James's ; 
and it has this peculiarity, that the magistrates of the county 
own attend and preside, as well as divide the customs with the lo- 
cal superior. 

Inns, Alehouses, Sfc. — The number of licensed places for the 
sale of spirits is 63, or one for every eighteen males in the parish 
above twenty years of age. There are few grocers who are not 
also spirit-dealers ; and the baleful practice of selling drams 
across their counter, and in their back shops, prevails to an ex- 
tent which renders it one of the most fertile occasions of drunken- 
ness. Repeated attempts have been made to induce the justices 
to limit the number of licenses, but hitherto, the pecuniary in- 
terests of landlords, who apprehend some difficulty in getting an 
adequate rent for their houses, should their tenants be denied a 
license, have had more weight with the court than the cause of 
temperance and good morals. Among the many proofs of the de- 
moralizing elfects of the spirit trade in all its departments, it may 
be mentioned, though the fact is probably not peculiar to Kelso,

that out of the many reputable and exemplary persons who take to 
tavern keeping as a refuge from reduced circumstances, there is 
scarcely one who does not in the course of a few years sink down 
into a habitual and incurable sot. 

Fuel. — Coal is the fuel chiefly used. It is brought from the 
coal-field in the north part of Northumberland, by carters, who pur- 
chase the mineral on their own risk at the pit, and sell it at what 
it will bring to their customers. These dealers assemble with their 
carts daily in the square called the coal-market, where there are 
steelyards for weighing them. The inhabitants purchase coals in 
the market commonly in single cart loads, after receiving certifica- 
tion of their weight at the steelyard. The coals are in general of 
an inferior quality, and, though sufficiently combustible, contain a 
large residuum of clay. The average yearly consumption is about 
5000 tons, or 1 ton for each person in the parish. The price may 
be generally stated as about 8d. per cwt. in winter, and 7d. in 
summer.

PRESBYTERY OF JEDBURGH, SYNOD OP MERSE AND TEV10TDALE.. 

THE REV. DAVID AITKEN, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — In old charters, the name of this parish is written Mvn- 
thow, Myntow, Mintov, from which in more modern times it pass- 
ed into Mynto and Minto. Different etymologies have been pro- 
posed, but all of them seem to be conjectural. Referring to the 
situation of the old village on the brink of a steep bank, or to the 
locality of the mansion-house on the opposite side of the glen, 
where an angular point is formed by the junction of two rivulets, 
it has been supposed that the origin of the name might be found 
in the British Mintau, denoting the brink or edge which extends 
out, Minto the exterior brink or border, and Mintua towards the 
brink. Ancient names, however, when borrowed from the natural 
features of the country, are generally derived from the most strik- 
ing objects, and it is accordingly more probable, that the bold and 



MINTO. 



353 



commanding eminence of Minto Craigs gave a designation to the 
parish. Agreeably to this view, as Meynn is said to be the Cam- 
bro- British, and Meen the Scoto-Irish word for a kid, the Celtic 
etymologists have concluded the name to signify kid's hill, the 
more readily, it has been thought, from considering that kids de- 
light in craggy heights ; unfortunately, however, for this explana- 
tion, nothing has been found in these languages resembling to or 
tow, which bears the signification of a hill or craig. Another at- 
tempt has been made to derive the name from the British Mynta, 
which means an aggregate, or Myntai, what is aggregated, both of 
these words being applicable to an assemblage of rocks, which 
certainly present the appearance of being piled or heaped to- 
gether. In the Welsh dictionaries, Mynydh is translated mons, 
and in Cornish Mynnen signifies the Alps, so that the name may 
be connected with the ancient British dialects, in which the ety- 
mologies of leading objects, such as hills and rivers, are generally 
to be found ; but, at the same time, showing the room there is for 
conjecture, a derivation might also be obtained in the Saxon lan- 
guage, it being well known that the names of several places which 
end in ov or ow, such as Grenehow, Stanehowe, Kalchov, Kelso, 
are formed from hov, the origin of the Scotch heugh, and of the old 
English hoic, a hill, and which in the lexicons is rendered mons 
prarupla, — a term peculiarly appropriate to the locality referred to. 
It must be allowed, that the first syllable cannot be so satisfactorily 
accounted for, though room for conjecture might be afforded bv 
the Saxon Mynta, Mint, or Mintan translated statuere, disponere. 

Extent, Boundaries. — The parish of Minto was formerly con- 
fined to the barony ; it now comprehends a considerable part of the 
suppressed parish of Hassendean, and extends about 3 or 4 miles 
in length, 2£ in breadth, and may contain about 8| of square miles. 
It presents somewhat of an oblong figure, and is bounded on the 
west by the parish of Wilton ; on the north by Lilliesleaf ; on the 
east by Ancrum ; and on the south by Cavers, which in some 
places stretches across the Teviot, so that the river is only partial- 
ly the boundary. A stripe of haugh along the southern extremity 
forms the only level ground. The surface in other places rises in 
frequent undulations, with a blunt outline presenting considerable 
variety. But the general appearance of the country is chiefly di- 
versified by two green hills, the highest of which reaches an eleva- 
tion of 877 feet, and to the east of them by the Minto Craigs, a 

 The heights in this neighbourhood arc usually very inaccurately stated, and 
made to exceed the truth, from the calculations being based on a defective survey by

congeries of trap rocks, mostly covered with wood, which, with a 
bold eminence, 721 feet in height above the level of the sea, over- 
hang the valley of the Teviot. These heights form a ridge run- 
ning lengthways east and west through the greater part of the pa- 
rish. To the south of them, the ground slopes to the river, and is 
farther diversified by some small glens or deans, watered by rivu- 
lets. Here, as in a great part of the south of Scotland, much of 
the most interesting scenery is concealed in these sequestered 
dells. Two may be mentioned as possessing much beauty, consider- 
ing their scale and extent. The one, near the western boundary, 
is partly clothed with native brushwood and trees, receding into 
open glades; the rock in other places is exposed in projecting 
ledges, at the foot of which a clear stream finds its way, contain- 
ing, even in the heats of summer, some deep pools ; and having 
almost an appearance of grandeur, when flooded in winter. This 
picturesque spot was scarcely accessible, and comparatively little 
known, till of late, when, under the direction of the present pro- 
prietor of Teviot Bank, it has been laid open by judiciously 
formed paths. The other glen is narrow, and has more the charac- 
ter of a ravine. The upper part, by means of a head thrown across 
it, is formed into a piece of artificial water, which winds under the 
steep and smooth bank, on the edge of which Minto House is si- 
tuated, and has its margin inclosed by tall evergreens, yews, weep- 
ing-willows, and several magnificent trees. The water, as it escapes, 
forms a considerable cascade, and below this the dean assumes its 
natural character, though still sufficiently intermixed with exotic 
shrubs, and maintaining enough of a dressed appearance to suit 
the neighbourhood of a large residence. From the sheltered na- 
ture of the situation, the trees thrive vigorously, and some of them 
have reached an uncommon size ; among these, may be mentioned 
that most graceful of tall evergreens, the hemlock spruce, the 
common spruce, silver-fir, several varieties of maple, and some 
larches, among the finest which are to be found in Scotland. 
Emerging from this closely wooded defile, a path leads at a little 
distance to Minto Craigs, the most conspicuous and interesting ob- 
ject in this district. The lower part of the steep is strewn with 
large masses of rock, dislodged from the precipice above, which, 
with its irregular surface, covered with a greyish lichen, in some 

Mr Kinghom. The following levels arc given as approaching nearer to correctness : 
Bed of the Teviot at SpitaUbrd above the sea, 197 feet ; Minto House, above Spital- 
ford, 194 feet ; Minto Craigs above do. 524 ; Minto Hill above do. G80 ; Ruberslaw 
above do. 1 174 feet. In the above list, Ruberslaw was very accurately measured by 
the present Earl of Minto, 1st, by the spirit level, 2d, trigonometrically, and 3d, baro- 
jnetrieally, the results by each method being precisely the same.

places projects, as if suspended in air, threatening to fall. Those 
fragments are rendered more picturesque from being partially over- 
grown with patches of ivy, and having their cavities filled with va- 
rieties of the fern, with foxglove, dianthus, and other flowering 
plants. With the characteristic form of the trap rocks, the crags 
rise into different points, presenting a succession of platforms, one of 
which tradition has long celebrated as Barn hill's bed, the retreat 
of a noted border outlaw of that name, mentioned in the " Lay of 
the Last Minstrel." The ruin of an old tower or peel, which for- 
merly belonged to the same person, crowns one of the heights, to 
which, and to the other eminences easy paths conduct, shaded by 
thriving trees. The view from the summit is highly diversified 
and beautiful. The windings of the " silver Teviot," through a 
pleasing vale, sometimes contracted and again expanding, can be 
traced above and below for many a mile, the prospect on the one 
hand being terminated by the fine outline of the Liddesdale hills, 
along with those on the confines of Dumfries-shire, and in the op- 
posite direction by the smoother and more rounded forms of the 
Cheviots. Ruberslaw, the highest hill in this vicinity, rises imme- 
diately in front, with Denholm dean, celebrated by Leyden, on the 
right, and the narrow bed of the Rule on the left ; while behind, 
to the north, are distinctly seen the Eildon-hills, the Black-hill, 
Cowden-Knowes, and more remotely Smailholm Tower, Hume 
Castle, and the low dark sky-line of the Lammermoors. 

Meteorology. — The hills and trap rocks just described occasion- 
ally attract and detain the clouds which sweep along the vale of 
the Teviot, so that in summer thunderstorms are rather frequent, 
and have been known to be severe. Probably from the same cause, 
heavy falls of rain have taken place, giving rise to local inundations. 
These would appear formerly to have been more common than 
they have been of late years. One took place in 1783, and another 
in 1789, by both of which the pond-head, a strong mass of build- 
ing near Minto House, was carried down. But the most remark- 
able which is remembered, happened on the 9th of August 1806, 
when it rained in torrents nearly three hours, accompanied by in- 
cessant thunder and lightning. Formerly, ague was so common a 
complaint that few in any condition of life escaped it, but now it 
has entirely disappeared, owing to the draining and other improve- 
ments of the land. Typhus and scarlet fevers, though not fre- 
quent, occasionally visit us in autumn, and are most prevalent in

low and close situations. In this neighbourhood there are a few 
fatuous persons ; and this state, it may not be unworthy of re- 
mark, would appear to be connected with the lymphatic tempera- 
ment. 

Geology. — Though of small extent, this parish is not altogether 
without geological interest, from its occupying the position where, 
in the valley of the Teviot, the transition rocks first disappear, and 
are replaced by others of a subsequent formation. At the western 
boundary, there is still a continuation of that great deposit of grey- 
wacke which stretches downward from Dumfries-shire in an east- 
erly direction, and in vertical or highly inclined strata. It skirts 
the whole of the north side of the parish, but on the south is seen 
terminating in the bed of the Teviot, the last indications of it be- 
ing exactly opposite to Teviotbank House. It occurs in the form 
of greywacke slate, where the lamina are thin, soft, of a white and 
sometimes greenish hue, interspersed with small specks of mica; 
and likewise in beds a foot or two thick, of a bluish-gray colour, 
in which cases it has the appearance of a sandstone, and forms a 
good building material. In some places, it is extensively pene- 
trated by veins of calcareous spar, and the mass itself has occa- 
sionally so much lime 'disseminated through it as to effervesce 
freely with an acid. In the bed of the Teviot, under Hassendean- 
burn House, and to the east of it, in the glen through which Has- 
sendean-burn flows, sections are exposed of a coarse red conglo- 
merate, alternating with thin beds of sandstone ; and near the site 
of the old peel at Hassendean, these nearly horizontal strata may 
in two places be perceived overlying the vertical strata of grey- 
wacke. These rocks are also seen in contact in a hollow formed 
by the small rill which marks the western boundary of the parish ; 
while another line of junction, less acted on by the weather, has 
been laid open to the north-east, near Standhill. This conglome- 
rate consists of a red argillaceous basis, containing imbedded por- 
tions of quartz, red porphyry, agate, greywacke, and flinty slate, 
all more or less rounded by attrition. In size the fragments vary 
from one to several inches, the most abundant are of a quartzose 
nature, having frequently a reddish or brown colour, with a conchoi- 
dal fracture. This deposit would therefore seem not only to ha\ e 
succeeded the older transition rocks, but also to be composed of 
the materials these afforded, after they had undergone the action 
of water; the softer parts forming the cemenf in which the harder 
are imbedded along with some other foreign substances. That the

subsidence must have taken place under very different circum- 
stances appears on examining the strata, in which some layers con- 
sist of comparatively small nodules, and pass gradually into a coarse 
sandstone, which would appear to have settled from a fluid in a 
state of rest, while in other instances the fragments are so large, 
and heaped together in such disorder, as to indicate currents of 
considerable force. And that, further, there were successive pe- 
riods at which the water was alternately at rest and in motion, may 
be likewise inferred from the beds of sandstone and conglomerate 
being piled several times one above the other. That in this fluid 
also, there must have been diffused a great quantity of iron in the 
state of an oxide or peroxide, from whatever source it may have 
been obtained, is evident from the deep red colour of all these 
lower deposits. In following the strata upwards, however, we find 
that the supply of iron must subsequently have varied, as beds of 
some thickness occur which are of a yellowish or even white colour, 
among which are still interposed other layers of red sandstone. 
With some local variations from the contiguity of the trap rocks, 
the inclination of these strata is very small ; their general dip is 
towards the east- or south-east, at an angle of three or four degrees. 
The light coloured stone has occasionally a greenish tinge on the 
outer surface of the beds ; in these cases, it also contains small 
scales of mica, and specks of iron are sometimes found scattered 
through the mass, which give it, when weathered, a dotted rusty 
appearance. Neither the red nor white varieties effervesce with 
an acid, but veins of carbonate of lime are found on the exterior 
of the layers. It has not yet been ascertained that fossil remains 
occur in any of these rocks. The accounts sometimes given by 
the workmen, refer, there is little doubt, to those dendritic ap- 
pearances which are formed by the exposure of particles of iron, 
and are merely superficial. 

Rising through these sedimentary rocks, or forming a nucleus, 
on the sides of which they rest, there are two unstratified masses 
of igneous origin, but which have assumed their present state 
under different circumstances. The one, divided in the middle, 
forms the green hills of Minto, which have a smooth round out- 
line, and are covered with grass to their summits, though in se- 
veral places, on a level with the turf, the rock is exposed. It 
consists of a greyish-coloured basis, in which are mixed different 
fragments, some of them like small grains, others as large as a 
nut ; several are four or five inches in size, and a few as many feet. 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



The larger imbedded portions are hard ; and among them are 
found hornstone, lydian-stone, and nodules, which have the look 
and texture of greywacke, but so altered as to have become sili- 
cious. This variety of rock is called trap-tufa, from its resem- 
blance to the tufaceous beds found in the neighbourhood of vol- 
canoes ; and there can be little doubt its origin is similar, and that 
the heated mass, as it was raised, was of such a temperature as 
to carry along with it portions of foreign matter, only partially 
changing them. It is accordingly a mechanical compound, like 
the conglomerate already described, — with this difference, that 
the basis of the latter is aqueous, and of the other igneous. It is, 
however, at the same time to be remarked, that, from their ge- 
nerally rounded shape, the fragments would appear to have been 
water-worn before they were incorporated in the fiery matters to 
which they owe their vitreous lustre and consistency. Might not 
this, perhaps, assign to the elevation of the tufa, — a date poste- 
rior to the accumulation of the rolled fragments which compose 
the conglomerate beds ; or, may not these, altered by heat, form 
the tufa 

About amile distant to the south-east, there is another mass of trap, 
forming Minto Craigs, but which having been projected at a higher 
temperature, and crystallized in cooling, has assumed that state to 
which the name of greenstone is given. It rises in several peaked, 
eminences, the bolder and more exposed fronts of which are turned 
towards the south. It is rather finely granular, and in some places 
exhibits an imperfect columnar structure. In consequence of this, it 
has been separated by the action of the weather, forming those irre- 
gular fragments with which, in the course of ages, the southern 
slope of the height has been strewed. 

There are also, in different parts of the parish, newer deposits 
of an alluvial nature, which may be here mentioned. Gravel is 
found to the depth of many feet, chiefly composed of fragments, 
derived from the greywacke rocks, and thereby shewing that the 
currents by which they had accumulated had set in from the west, 
the direction in which those strata are found. There is also 
throughout the district, and covering the sandstone, so as greatly 
to interfere with its being quarried, a deposit of reddish clay, 
known by the local name of dent. In some places, it has a depth 
of 40 and 50 feet, is penetrated extensively by calcareous veins, 
and arranged in layers, having the appearance of an argillaceous 

sandstone, loosely integrated. It is of recent origin, and might 

3 



MINTO. 



359 



deserve examination, to determine whether it contains any, and 
what organic remains. In some of the hollows, marl has accumu- 
lated, and may still be observed going on by percolation from the 
soil. The origin of the lime, at least in part, is to be referred to 
the greywacke rocks, in the neighbourhood of which it is that the 
deposits take place. From the description given of the rocks, the 
nature of the soil may be readily inferred : — that which rests on 
the greywacke is a stiff white till ; while from the argillaceous na- 
ture of the sandstone, and the covering of dent, the land in other 
places is also clayey and retentive of moisture, except in the allu- 
vial tract near the river, and where the deposits of gravel are found, 
and likewise near to the greenstone rocks, which by their decom- 
position form a black and rich mould. 

Having described the nature and relative position of these rocks, 
a few remarks are added respecting the theory of their age. The 
greywacke deposits, underlying the unconformable strata of the 
sandstone, are obviously older than the latter ; and it has been 
supposed that, being sedimentary rocks, now greatly inclined from 
some force acting since their deposition, they may have been pre- 
vious also to the igneous rocks, and received from the elevation 
of these their present position. A cause, however, less of a li- 
mited and local nature, must be sought for the distortion so cha- 
racteristic of these transition strata ; and a newer era, assigned to 
several at least of the trap irruptions, which in some cases seem 
to have happened after the subsidence of the sandstone which 
they have hardened. Thus, for example, a few years ago a quarry 
was opened at the foot of the Minto hills, which, after a short at 
tempt, was abandoned in consequence of the hardness of the 
freestone, which broke the tools of the workmen. In opening also 
a footpath on the west corner of the crags, the strata of sandstone 
were found cropping out,— here likewise so hard and crystalline 
as to give out sparks when struck with a hammer. The disloca- 
tions and slips in the quarry from which Minto- House was built, 
might be viewed as disturbances produced by the action of fire. 
Still, notwithstanding these facts, and although they should prove 
that some of the irruptions are newer, on taking a general view of 
the sandstqne strata in the neighbourhood, and their position re- 
latively to the trap rocks, which are rather abundant, it is difficult 
to resist the notion that these sedimentary deposits are the most 
recent. And the view which, to the writer of this account, as yet 
seems best to explain the actual appearances, is to consider the 



360 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



trap rocks, as already existing, as peaks and irregular masses in 
the collection of waters from which the sandstone subsided, and 
at the time of their subsidence to suppose this sea moved by sub- 
marine currents, so as to cause the chief deposit of sand to take 
place on the east side of those elevated summits, where, accord- 
ingly, it is now found, forming a long ridge, sloping off as it re- 
cedes. Agreeably to this supposition, on the south side of the 
Teviot, the sandstone is most abundant to the east of the trap 
hills of Ruberslaw, the Dunion, and Lanton, inclining gradually 
from them. While on the north side also, it is to the east of the 
Minto hills, Craigs, and Standhill, that the strata occur in greatest 
quantity with the same appearance and inclination ; and still far- 
ther down the country, this also takes place at Peniel-heugh. But 
whether we suppose the current to have existed while the strati- 
fied rocks were only settling, or subsequent to their assuming a 
solid form, it is necessary farther to admit the agency of water at 
a much more recent period, rushing in the same direction, from 
the great quantity of boulders of greenstone scattered over the 
surface of the ground, and uniformly to the east of those places 
where the rock is found in situ. 

It is a question of much difficulty to what member of the series 
these sandstones belong.— So far as is known, no fossil remains 
have hitherto been observed to aid in the determination, and, 
though occupying the place of the old red sandstone when it oc- 
curs, yet, judging from the grain of the rock, the small inclination 
of the beds, nowhere exceeding an angle of 8° or 9°, the circum- 
stance also of the upper strata being usually white, and the lower 
red, along with their apparent connection with those which are so 
extensively developed in Berwickshire, and there observed over- 
lapping the coal measures, it may be held in the meantime as the 
most probable view, that they belong to the new red sandstone 
formation, the gris rouge, and roth-todte-liegende of continental 
geologists. 

Zoology. — Few of the animals can be considered as rare. The 
Caprimulgus Europceus, however, which has of late once or twice 
been shot, is not common in this part of the country. The kings- 
fisher is occasionally to be s.een on the banks of the smaller rivulets, 
and in the same haunts the water-rail and solitary snipe are met.

Barony of Minto. — The earliest notices of the Barony of Minto 
occur in the fourteenth century, at which time it was in the possession 
of a family belonging to the ancient and powerful clan of the Turn- 
bulls. Some smaller pendicles, however, would appear to have been 
held by other proprietors, for there isa charter of Robert I. granting 
part of the mill lands to one Gulielmus Barbitonsor ;-f- and another 
grant in the twelfth year of Robert III. to Laurencius de Govane 
and his heirs, on the feudal tenure of their yearly presenting to 
the King a bow and twelve arrows, at the chapel of the assump- 
tion of the Virgin Mary, in Ettrick Forest.J The lands of the 
barony were, in 1390, granted by John Turnbull to Sir William 
Stewart of Jedworth, and confirmed by a charter of Robert III., 
signed the same year at Minto, in the presence of Walter and 
Matthew, Bishops of St Andrews and Glasgow. In the following 
year, another charter confirmed to the same person the lands and 
tenements of the town and territory of Minto, along with the ad- 
vowson of the church freely disponed to him by John de Aberne- 
thy. This Sir William Stewart is considered to be a descendant 
of Sir Allan Stewart of Dreghorn, killed at the battle of Hallidon 
Hill in 1333, and to have borne the title both of Jedworth and 
Castlemilk. He is described in the charter confirming the grant 

 The authorities for these facts are chiefly the Rotuli Scotia, AyscofF 's Catalogue, 
and in one or two instances Rymer's Foedera. 

\ It is just possible that this may have been a relative of John Barbour, the poet, 
•who was a contemporary, as it has been conjectured his father might be tbe John 
Barbour to whom Robert I. ordered the payment of a sum of money to be made by 
Sir Alexander Seaton, Governor of Berwick. All research has hitherto failed to as- 
certain the poet's birth-place ; perhaps the mention of these names at the same pe- 
riod of time in connexion with the south of Scotland, might, in the absence of better 
data, be held as favouring the supposition that he was sprung from a border family. 

± In Rymer's Foedera, vol. vii. p. 273, a. d. 1380, mention is made of the barony 
of Minto as consisting of two parts. " Item le deux parties de Baronie de Mynte- 
howe, oue l'avouson de l'eglise q'estoit a Johan Turnebole."

of the lands by Turnbull as his nephew, and they would appear to 
have been faithful companions in the daring adventures of those 
troubled times, for in the year 1400 they made a fierce irruption 
together into England, in the account of which Turnbull is styled 
Outicith the Sivord,"—a surname expressive of his heady and war- 
like temper. Still long after the grant just referred to, notice repeat- 
edly occurs both of the Stewarts and Turnbulls of Minto,— a cir- 
cumstance which is, however, satisfactorily explained in the fol- 
lowing curious extract from the " Genealogy of the Stewarts re- 
futed : — " 

« In the charter chest of Lord Minto is a notarial instrument, 
dated April 23, 1429, purporting that, on that day at Minto, it 
was attempted, by virtue of a precept of seisin, to invest Sir Wil- 
liam Stewart of Dalswintoun in the lands of Minto, and that those 
proceedings were interrupted by Walter Turnbull, who declared 
the hereditary seisin then granted to Sir William Stewart null and 
void, as he himself was the true heir and legal baron of Minto.— 
From another notarial instrument in the same charter-chest, dated 
1425, we learn that Walter Turnbull had prepared himself for 
this event a few years before. An inquiry at his instance had been 
instituted relative to John Turnbull, his father, who had made the 
grant of Minto in 1390. A jury, nominated for the occasion, de- 
clared that he laboured under the effects of a leprosy at the time 
when the deed was executed,-a circumstance which, according to 
the laws of Scotland, as they then stood, rendered the proceedings 
void. The inquest into the validity of the charter of the lands of 
Minto seems to have been in consequence of an account received 
m Scotland of the fall of Walter's father, Sir John Turnbull at 
the battle of Cravant, in 1423. After much dissension between 
the claimants, it appears that, by a brief of perambulation by King 
James II addressed to Sir Archibald Douglas of Cavers, Sheriff 
of Teviotdale that officer made a partition of the estate of Minto 
between Sir William Stewart and Walter Turnbull, in certain

these families, the estate of Mintowas purchased by Walter Riddell, 
second son of Walter Riddell of New-house, and by his daughters, 
who were coheiresses, it was sold, previously to the Union, to Sir 
Gilbert Elliot, ancestor of the present family of Minto. This eminent 
person, born in 1651, was a younger son of Gawen Elliot of Midlem 
Mill, who was the fourth son of Gilbert Elliot of Stobs, commonly 
called " Gibbie with the gowden garters," by Margaret daughter 
of Walter" Scott, of Harden, better known by the sobriquet of 
« Maggy Fendy." Being the second son of a younger branch, 
Gilbert was destined to the profession of the law ; but in that stir- 
ring period of history, he appears also to have taken an active in- 
terest in political affairs, as, on the 1 6th July 1 685, he was found 
guilty of treason, and forfeited for being in arms with  Argyle, — 
the process describing him as a writer in Edinburgh. He seems, 
however, to have been soon pardoned by the King, for in little 
more than two years afterwards, he applied to be admitted an ad- 
vocate, when his examiners, it is said, " stumbled to meet with him, 
till he first showed his remission lest it might infer converse against 
them." He was one of the deputation of Scotch gentlemen who 
waited on King William in Holland, to concert measures for his 
coming over to England, so that at the Revolution, from the pro- 
minent part he had taken, the act of forfeiture was rescinded, and 

of sixty years thereafter, in a letter of the privy-council to the King, as to the deadly 
feud between the Earls of Eglinton and Lord Sempil, this sentence occurs : " August 
27, 1606, We had likewise in hand the process of Glasgow, wherein we have found 
very great insolence and riot committed by Mynto and a number of the commons of 
the town, and have committed the persons guilty to ward within the burgh of Lin- 
lithow, till your Majesty's pleasure be known." Several scattered notices of the 
Turnbulls likewise occur. There is a remission, dated 5th April 1499, to William 
Turnbull of Minto, and Archibald Turnbull, son to umquhile John Tumbull, for 
the slaughter of umquhile John of Rutherford, and for their treasonable passing and 
remaining in linglan d." Only three years afterwards, however, in lo02, the Turn- 
bulls of Minto were again engaged in several acts of violence, destroying the place of 
Barnhills, and burning twenty-six bolls of bear, and forty bolls of oats, pertamingto 
George Rutherford of Langnewton, in his place of Sandystanes, so that, on account 
of these outrages, we find, in 1506, William Turnbull of Minto, along with Mark, 
Edward, and Walter Turnbull, his accomplices, set forth as " rebels, and at the horn. ' 
The same lawless habits still continued a century later, for Thomas Turnbull, appa- 
rand of Mynto, was concerned in the slaughter of Thomas Ker of Crailing and his 
servant, which took place on the 14th September 1601. There was, indeed, at this 
time, as we learn from a contemporary document, " a deadly feud standing betwixt 
the haile name Trumbill in theane part, and the laird of Pharnih irst, the haile Kers, 
and the haile inhabitants of the towne of Jcdburghe on the other." 

 Fountainhall, in his Notices of the Transactions of 1685, says, " As to the stock 
with which Argyle furnished his ships and arms, Rumbold said that he thought it 
did not exceed L. 12,000 Sterling ; how lie got it, some said ane English widow in 
Amsterdam, called Mistress Smith, advanced him considerably ; others say that I OU 
wart Torwoodly, and Mr Gilbert Elliot, went to Geneva, and to the Protestant 
churches of Germany, begging supply to the poor aflheted Protestants of Brittain,

he was appointed clerk to the privy-council, which office he held 
in 1692. He was subsequently created a Baronet in 1700, and 
received from King William a charter of the lands of Headshaw 
and Dryden, which was ratified by Queen Anne in 1705, though 
mention is also made of an earlier charter of these lands, dated 
1696. On the 28th June J 705, he took his seat in the Court of 
Session by the title of Lord Minto, and, as it appears, he became 
also a Lord of Justiciary. A portrait of him is still preserved in 
Minto House, painted about three years before his death, which 
took place probably in 1718, in the sixty-seventh year of his age. 
The preceding account, though minute, may have some general in- 
terest, not only from his being the founder of a family which has 
risen to distinction, but from the part he filled in an eventful pe- 
riod of national history, and the high character he maintained 
for talent and integrity. He is mentioned by Wodrow in his his- 
tory, in these very honourable terms : " Mr Elliot, since Lord 
Minto, is lately dead, and filled one room in the Bench of Justici- 
ary, where an unjust sentence was given forth against him, as well 
as a place in the College of Justice he so well deserved, by his 
unshaken probity and boldness against all unrighteousness and 
vice." The following amusing anecdote is taken fromDr M'Crie's 
Memoirs of Mr William Veitch : « When Lord Minto visited 
Dumfries, of which Mr Veitch was minister, after the Revolution, 
he always spent some time with his old friend, when their conver- 
sation often turned on the perils of their former life. On these 
occasions his Lordship was accustomed facetiously to say, ' Ah  
Willie, Willie, had it no been for me, the pyets had been pyking 
your pate on the Nether Bow port;' to which Veitch replied, 
 Ah  Gibbie, Gibbie, had it no been for me ye would ha'e been 
yet writing papers for a plack the page/" 

The second Sir Gilbert was born in 1693 or 1694, became a 
Lord of Session on the 21st June 1726, a Lord of Justiciary 20th 
August 1733, and. was afterwards appointed Justice- Clerk. He 
likewise sat in Parliament in 1725, concurring in his politics with 
John Duke of Argyle, whose confidence he enjoyed, and whom he 
assisted in the management of Scottish affairs. It was in his time 
that the grounds at Minto began to be laid out and improved. A 
pondhea'd was thrown across the glen in 1735, and considerable 
alterations and additions made to the house in 1744-45. Before 

 14 Js said that in this year, 1726, the Germiin flute was fiist brought into Scot- 
Janu by Sir Oilbvrt Elliot, who, to his other accomplishments, added a taste for music.

this, the only trees near the house consisted of an avenue of old 
ash, one or two of which are still standing; and the village then 
stretched along the opposite bank in a straggling line, with the 
church and manse nearly in the midst of it. The greater part of 
these houses was removed to Minto Green, the site of the present 
village, the banks of the pond planted, and on one side a row of 
larches was placed most probably in 1736, being among the first that 
were introduced into Scotland. There is a tradition, that the seed 
was sent in a frank by John Duke of Argyle, sown in flower-pots, and 
kept in the hot-house till, by the advice of the Sardinian Ambassa- 
dor, who chanced to be on a visit, the plants were removed to their 
present situation, where several of them have now attained a height 
of 100 feet. On the opposite bank, there is a shady avenue of beech 
of the same date, when the dwelling-house was. also farther im- 
proved, and a library f formed, such as at that time was rarely to 
be met with in Scotland. From this his family seem greatly to 
have profited, as they were distinguished by their acquirements. 
One of them, Miss Jane Elliot, who died in 1805, is still affection- 
ately remembered from her talents and delightful conversation, 
but has acquired a more extensive and lasting celebrity as the 
authoress of the " Flowers of the Forest," of which no less an au- 
thority than the late Sir Walter Scott has said, that " it is ex- 
pressed in a strain of elegiac simplicity and tenderness which has 
seldom been equalled, and imitates the manner of the ancient 
minstrels so happily, that it required the most positive evidence to 
convince me that the song was of modern date." This lady ap- 
pears to have been no less remarkable for strength of character 
than accomplishment, for at the time of the Rebellion in J 745- 
46, her father being forced to conceal himself from a party of 
Jacobites among the craigs, then only covered with broom and 
long grass, she received and entertained the officers, and, by her 
presence of mind and composure, averted the danger. The Jus- 
tice-Clerk died suddenly at Minto in 1766, and was succeeded by 
his son, the third Sir Gilbert, who seems to have been also intended 
for the profession of his father and grandfather, as he passed his 
civil law trials in 1743; but, having early associated with the pub- 
lic men of his day in London, he engaged actively in political life, 
was returned Member of Parliament, first for the county of Sel-

kirk in 1754, afterwards for Roxburghshire in 1765, and became 
also Treasurer of the Navy. He died in 1777, of a pulmonary com- 
plaint, at Marseilles. He possessed an amiable and highly culti- 
vated mind, and, in the midst of his other pursuits, found leisure 
for those of literature, favourable evidence of which is preserved 
in the beautiful pastoral song, — " My sheep I neglected, I broke 
my sheep- hook," published in the notes to the Lay of the Last 
Minstrel, and in the draught of a letter to David Hume, the me- 
taphysician, printed along with the first Dissertation to the new 
Encyclopaedia Britannica by Dugald Stewart, and by that com- 
petent judge, held to be remarkable for " sound philosophy and 
purity of English style." The fourth Sir Gilbert, father of the 
present Earl, was distinguished by eminent talents for public bu- 
siness, as is shewn in the number of high offices to which he was 
successively called. In 1793, he was appointed Governor of 
Toulon, Viceroy of Corsica in 1794, Minister Plenipotentiary at 
Vienna in 1799, President of the Board of Control in 1806, and 
Governor General of India in 1807. He was created Baron 
Minto, and admitted to the peerage in 1797, and raised to the rank 
of an Earl in 1812, with the additional title of Viscount Melgund; 
for his eminent services in the East, he also received the thanks of 
both Houses of Parliament. He died soon after his return from 
India, on his way to Scotland in 1814, aged sixty-three years. 
Though much of his time was spent abroad, the improvements of 
the paternal estate were continued by Lady Minto, daughter of 
Sir George Amyand, whom he married a few weeks before his fa- 
ther's death. Besides extensive additions to the plantations, the 
present House of Minto was built, being finished in 1814. The 
present Earl, born in 1782, and married 1806 to Miss Brydone, 
daughter of Patrick Brydone, Esq. author of the Tour in Sicily 
and maternal grand-daughter of Principal Robertson, has also been 
actively employed in political life. He early represented his native 
county in Parliament, has since held the appointment of Minister 
Plenipotentiary to the Court of Berlin, and at present fills the of- 
fice of First Lord of the Admiralty. 

Hassendean— Though now, in a considerable part, incorporated 
with Minto, a brief notice may here be given separately of Has- 
sendean. Sir Walter Scott, in a note to the Lay of the Last 
Minstrel, states that Hassendean is a corruption from Hazeldean ; 
and Leyden, in the Scenes of Infancy, has adopted the latter spel- 
ling, but for this there is not the slightest authority, either in tra-

dition, or in the old records, where the name frequently occurs. It 
is written Halstaneadene, Halstenden, Halstansdene, and Hasta- 
neden, from which, perhaps, it changed into Hassingden, and Has- 
sendean, as softer to the ear. It may either signify the dean of 
the holy stone, — a supposition which is strengthened from its con- 
taining a place of religious worship from a remote period, or it 
may simply mean Halstein's, or Hastein's dean, these being com- 
mon Scandinavian names, and the appellation might be taken from 
some person of distinction who resided there, or to whom it be- 
longed. So far back as the twelfth century the lands of Hassen- 
dean were granted by David I. to Walter, the son of Alan; and 
by a charter of Robert the Bruce, they were confirmed to Sir 
James de Conyngham, and held by a tenure of feudal and mili- 
tary service, with the payment of L. 1 ] Sterling, in two equal parts, 
at the terms of Whitsunday and Martinmas. There is another 
charter dated 1409, confirming a grant by his kinsman, William de 
Conyngham to John Turnbull, son of Adam Turnbull of White- 
hope of the lands of Hassendean-Bank. From Satchell we learn 
that David ScQtt, about 1446, was the first of that name designed 
of Hassendean, and was the eldest son of Sir William Scott of 
Kirkurd, who exchanged the lands of Murdiston for those of 
Branxholme. It is to this old branch of the Scotts that Satchell 
alludes in the lines,— 

" Hassendean came without a call, 
The ancientest house of them all." 

We learn, however, from an entry in the Criminal Trials published 
by Pitcairn, that there was in 1493 a Walter Talzour Baro de 
Hassindene ; for in that year he was permitted to compound for 
intercommuning with the English, the Laird of Buccleuch being 
his surety. A Sir Alexander Scott of Hassendean was killed at 
the battle of Flodden in 1513. Among the border barons who in 
1530 neglected to fulfil their bonds, there was a William Scott of 
Hassendean, who is again mentioned in 1539, as having been 
robbed by Thomas Turnbull of Rawflat of some important legal 
documents ; while, farther, in 1564, the Criminal Trials record the 
slaughter of a David Scott, laird at Hassendean, by William Elliot 
of Horsliehill. It does not seem to be ascertained at what period 
the male line of this family failed, though it may perhaps have 
been at the death of the said David Scott; but in the appendix to 

 See Ayloll'e's Catalogue, and the Rotuli Scotia;.

Satehell it is stated that the lands returned by purchase to the Scotts 
of Buccleuch, while the representation of the family devolved on 
William. Scott of Burnhead and Crowbill, as lineal male descend- 
ant of the first John Scott of Burnhead, younger brother of David 
of Hassendean, and second son to Sir Walter Scott of Kirkurd. 
The lands comprised originally in the barony of Hassendean have 
long been separated ; besides that still belonging to His Grace the 
Duke of Buccleuch, a part forms the present estate of Teviot- 
bank, another that of Hassendean-burn, while Hassendean-bank, 
a fourth portion, belonged to the Duke of Roxburghe, and was sold 
by him to Sir Gilbert Elliot of Minto to redeem the land-tax. 

Church at Minto and at Hassendean. — Of the church at Minto 
notice occurs in the fourteenth centurv ; and a curious circum- 

a/  

stance respecting it, not easy to be explained, is learned from a 
charter of Edward III. in 1374, that it at that time belonged to 
the diocese of Lincoln. When the lands of Hassendean were 
granted by David I., the church was separately given by him to 
the Bishop of Glasgow, and before the year 1181 the grant had 
been confirmed by two Popes, Alexander and Lucius. Shortly 
afterwards, in 1192, the well known Joceline, Bishop of Glasgow, 
who had been Abbot of Melrose, gave to the monks of that abbey 
the church lands and tithes of Hassendean, in pure and perpetual 
alms, or, as it is expressed, " ad susceptionem pauperum et pere- 
grinorum ad domum de Melros venientium." The cell built for 
this purpose was known by the name of the Monk's Tower, and 
the land belonging to it, which adjoins the present dwelling-house of 
Hassendean-burn, is still called the Monk's Croft. It was restrict- 
ed by William the Lion to the pasturage of 200 ewes, 16 oxen, 
and 4 cows. In 1560,f these religious establishments were abolish- 
ed, but the church was still continued, and, along with its perti- 
nents, granted to Walter Earl of Buccleuch. In 1576, we find a 
Thomas Newbye, reader at Hassendean, the whole vicarage be- 
ing vacant by demission of Mr Thomas Westoun ; and from the 
Criminal Trials we learn that, in 1590, this Newbye, along with 

 In 1488, William Douglas, vicar of the kirk at Hassendean, was bound and 
obliged to " ane venerabil fader in God," Bernard Abbot of Melrose not to interfere 
with the claim of the abbot and convent, to the " erde silver of the quer of the said 
kirk of Hassendean," on the ground of their long having been in peaceable possession 
of" browkying and joying of the same."— Liber de Melros. This " erde silver of 
the quer" was the money charged for burial in the choir. 

t 1'hc " Liber de Melros" records the demission of the monastery of Melrose in 
favour of William, Earl of Morton, to whom was also conveyed the patronage of 
Hasseii'lean, the deed, signed by James, Commendator of Melrose, bearing the date 
ofl608.

Thomas Ker in Old Roxburgh, and James Scot of South Synton- 
mill, was " delated for sustaining of the process of excommunica- 
tion, and contravening of the acts of Parliament in baptising of 
bairns and making of marriages without any function." From the 
presbytery records it appears, that, for some time previous to 1666, 
attempts had been made to remove the church to Roberton ; for 
of that date there is an entry of the report of a committee to the 
Archbishop of Glasgow, bearing, that " advantage had been taken 
of the pupilarity of the deceased Mary Duchess of Buccleuch, to 
whom the greater part of the parish belonged, and of the confu- 
sions under the late usurpation, to procure a warrant from the same 
usurpers for changing the seat of the said kirk at Hassendean, and 
building ane new kirk at Roberton, and that they did according- 
ly build the said new kirk at the west end of said parish." At 
length in 1690, the church was wholly suppressed, not, however, 
without so determined an opposition on the part of the parishioners 
as to make it necessary to call in the aid of the Sheriff of the 
county, an ancestor of the family of Cavers ; and it is related that, 
on this occasion, an old woman threatened him with the judg- 
ment of Heaven on account of his sacrilegious work, denouncing: 
the extinction of the male line of the family. It is to this tradition 
that Leyden alludes in the lines,

From the site of the old building being exposed to the encroach- 
ments of the Teviot, it became gradually dilapidated, but the 
churchyard was still continued for burying up to 1796, when an 
unusually high flood tore open the graves, and made it necessary to 
remove the remains of the dead. The river has continued to alter 
its bed, till it appears, from measurements in the possession of the 
proprietor of Hassendean-burn, that the site of the old church, for- 
merly on a projecting point on the north bank, is now marked by a 
sand bank on the opposite side, nearly in a line with the termination 
of a garden wall. 

Antiquities. — In common with the greater part of the south of 
Scotland, this parish formerly contained several towers of strength 
or border peels, but these, with a fate which has been too fre- 
quent, have, for the most part, been removed. That of Horsley- 
hill has long disappeared, and only a fragment of one wall remains 
at Hassendean, forming the gable end of a cottage. The tower 



MINTO. 371 

at Minto occupied the situation of the present mansion-house, and 
is named in the list of those which were destroyed by the Earl of 
Hertford in 1545. The only vestige of any interest which has sur- 
vived, is a ruin of small size, but considerable strength, placed on 
the summit of the Craigs, commonly called Fatlips Castle, but from 
what circumstance does not appear. It is figured in Grose's views in 
Scotland, and seems at that time to have had a part of the second 
story left, which is now wanting. It is supposed to have been a 
stronghold belonging to Turnbull of Barnhills, whose bed, or place 
of outlook, is on a projecting platform immediately beneath ; and an- 
other tower, also assigned to that noted freebooter, is situated a little 
to the east, at the boundary between Minto and Ancrum parishes. 
The old church at Minto, taken down in 1831, was a very plain 
building, the greater part of which may have been erected since the 
Reformation ; but one end, containing a pointed arch, was evidently 
more ancient, and some stones built into the walls, and, as it was very 
curious to observe, with their carved sides uniformly turned in - 
wards, must have belonged to a structure, which, judging by these 
fragments, had been tastefully ornamented. On removing the 
foundation of one of the walls, at a few inches from the surface 
inside the building, and under two small stones placed on end and 
meeting at top, a collection of about 400 small silver coins 
was found, chiefly silver pennies, of Edward I. II. III., with one or 
two of the Scottish Kings Alexander and Robert. But this place 
would appear formerly to have been the depositary of more trea- 
sure than this ; for, from the Criminal Trials before alluded to, we 
learn that, on the " 21st November 1493, John Sinclare in Mynto, 
and 4 others came in the King's will for treasonably concealing and 
stouthreif of X x pas pennys pertaining to the King, found in the 

 There is reason to believe that various objects of antiquarian interest are from 
time to time discovered in this district, many of which are afterwards either destroy- 
ed or thrown aside. Two that have recently come into the possession of the writer 
may be worthy of notice. The one is a silver hoop ring of massive dimensions, 
weighing six pennyweight ten grains ; it is bevelled to fit the tapering of the finger, 
and had been gilt. It bears the following inscription, terminated by a cross, each 
letter being contained in a separate square compartment, ihesus na. This may sig- 
nify Jesus of Nazareth, and most probably the ornament was worn by some priest or 
monk. The other is an ancient seal, in the form of a thin circular plate of copper, 
an inch and a half in diameter, on which is cut a rude representation of the Paschal 
Lamb, with the fore legs singularly crossed, surmounted by a banner. Round the 
margin is the legend s aden pastorel. The most probable conjecture is, that this 
was the seal belonging to the individual who had the charge of the flocks of one of 
the great monastic institutions, inscribed with his name and office. Aden, or Alden, 
is a name frequently met with in old documents ; an individual so called was " Sc. 
ncscaldus," or Steward at Melrose under the reign of William the Lion, in the 
twelfth century.

kirk of Mynto," the Laird of Bethroule and William Langlandes 
becoming their sureties. In a note, the learned editor, Mr Pit- 
cairn, adds, that " these were likely to be ten score ' paces nobiles 
of paiss,' " English gold coins or nobles, which are frequently men- 
tioned in our old acts of Parliament. Although found in the kirk 
of Minto, there is no reason to suppose they were " pace" or,Easter 
offerings- There is no doubt that this " pace" was treasure trove 
accidentally turned up and concealed by Sinclare, and as such it 
belonged to the King, who, on the other hand, could have had no 
claim to pious Easter offerings made in grateful remembrance of 
the resurrection." Though no remnant of the old church at Has- 
sendean is now left, some idea of its appearance may be formed from 
a view in Cardonnel's Etchings representing part of the walls and 
an arch, which the description says was the " eastern end of the 
choir, of. Saxon architecture, and no inelegant design." The short 
and massive columns or piers are in the style usually, though not 
very properly, called Saxon ; but the arch, which is rounded, has 
the Norman zig-zag ornament or chevron. The remains of some 
other buildings were turned up to the north of the burying-ground 
when the garden wall now standing was built. It is said that the 
wood, taken -from the ruins of the church, and employed in joist- 
ing some out-houses, was found to be Spanish chestnut, which is 
alleged to be so extensively found in the old ecclesiastical buildings 
of Scotland, as to countenance the idea of its having been, at one 
time, generally grown in this country, and to a large size. There 
is reason, however, to suspect that in most of these cases the tim- 
ber is that got from the Quercus sessiliflora, which in grain and 
texture bears so close a resemblance to the Spanish chestnut, that 
it requires a practised eye to distinguish them. 

Modern Buildings. — The freestone of the neighbourhood af- 
fords a good material, both in colour and durability, and has been 
employed in several buildings recently erected, all of which show 
an increased attention to elegance of design. Minto House, from 
a plan of Archibald Elliot, Esq. architect, is a large and commo- 
dious structure, having an imposing effect, to which the situation 
greatly contributes. The House of Teviotbank has been lately 
built from a tasteful design, in the old English style, by Wil- 
liam Burn, Esq. architect. The manse and church are also new, 
for which William Play fair, Esq. architect, furnished the draw- 
| n g S ; the first being a Tuscan villa, the latter a Gothic building,

both of them in a style of art, of which, in Scotland, there are as 

yet but few examples in works of the same kind. 

Heritors. There are in the parish four heritors, — the Duke of 

Buccleuch ; Earl of Minto ; Archibald Dickson, Esq. of Has- 
sendean-burn ; William Scott, Esq. of Teviotbank ; one non-re- 
sident, one constantly resident, and two occasionally so. 

Parochial Register.— The date of the earliest entry in the 
parochial register, is 1703. During last century, entries were 
made with more regularity than has since been observed. No re- 
gister is kept of deaths. Marriages, as ascertained from the pro- 
clamations, may be stated at 5 yearly. 

III. — Population. 

The only village, Minto, according to the census of 1831, con- 
tains 108 inhabitants, the other parts of the parish, 373, — making 
together a population of 481 ; but in 1828, as ascertained by the 
writer, it amounted to 530. In 1831, the number of families was 
95, with 85 inhabited houses. 

The population is, of late, rather on the decrease, partly from the 
enlargement and junction of farms, and the giving up of the nur- 
series at Hassendean-burn, which, after having been established 
upwards of a century, have recently been removed to Hawick. 

Character of the People. — The people generally are industrious 
and well-conditioned ; individuals, from time to time, rising in then- 
station of life, or enabling their children to do so, by giving them 
the benefit of a higher education. Chiefly from the improvements 
in this particular, the language within the last , forty years has 
undergone a considerable change. It is not improbable, that, ere 
long, the ancient dialect of the district, which has several interest- 
ing peculiarities, may become, in a great measure, extinct. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The number of acres, standard imperial measure, 
cultivated or occasionally in pasture, may be computed at 3205 ; 
there are 1458 in pasture. Of this, little or none could with ad- 
vantage be taken into cultivation, while some land, which was at 
one time ploughed, is now suffered to lie permanently in grass. 
The improved system of husbandry, and of the rotation of crops, 
is everywhere in use ; bone dust has, of late years, been employed 
in the growing of turnips ; and increasing attention is paid to the 
draining of the land, which, from the nature of the soil, is produc- 
tive of the greatest benefit. 

Live-Stock. — The short-horn cattle, and the Cheviot and Lei- 



374 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



cester sheep, are the common breeds. The fences are well kept, 
and the farm-houses and offices in good repair. 

Leases generally run from fifteeen to nineteen years. 

Rent of Land.— The average rent of arable land may be esti- 
mated to be somewhere about 18s. or L. 1 an acre. L. 1, 15s. for 
an ox or cow, and 6s. for a ewe— are the average rates of grazing for 
the year. 

Wages.— The common rate of country labour for men is Is. 8d. 
per day in summer ; in winter Is. 6d. A good deal of farm-work 
is done by women, who receive from 8d. to lOd. a day, according 
to the season. Hinds and ploughmen's wages are paid partly in 
meal, and partly in money. They have also, in general, a spot of 
ground for growing vegetables ; a cow kept for them by their em- 
ployer, who plants for their use a certain space in the field with 
potatoes, and drives a fixed quantity of coals. Cottages are some- 
times let to labourers, on the condition of their working in harvest, 
and the hinds are bound to supply workers in the field when wanted, 
who are called bondagers. Men employed in cutting hay have better 
wages, than when at other day labour. They have been paid, of late 
years, from 2s. to 2s. 3d. per day. Harvest wages for men, besides 
victuals and lodging, run from 12s. to 13s. per week, and wo- 
men's from lis. to 12s. The rate of payment of masons and car- 
penters is from 2s. 6d. to 3s. a day. Smiths occasionally do work 
by contract, that is to say, keep a pair of horses in shoes, and a 
plough in good repair, for a fixed sum per annum. 

Fuel. — From the distance of coal, fuel is an expensive article ; 
L. 1 per ton may be given as the price of coals, and 4s. 6d. per 
cart of wood, which is a good deal used. 

The total rental of the parish may amount somewhere to about 
L. 3220 per annum. 

Produce. — The following may be given as an estimate of the 
average gross amount of raw produce. 

Produce of grain of all kinds, . . L. 6014 0 0 
of potatoes, turnips, &amp;c. . . 1560 0 0 
of hay, . . . . 290 0 0 
of land in pasture, rated at L. 1, 15s. per cow or full- 
grown ox, and at 6s. per ewe or full grown sheep, 1325 0 0 
of gardens and orchards, . . . 100 0 0 
of thinning and felling wood, . . 400 0 0 

Total value of raw produce, L. 9689 0 0 

Wood. — There are above 786 acres in wood, all of it planted ; 
the trees chiefly grown being oak, ask, elm, spruce, larch, with a 
few beeches and poplars ; of these the oak among the hard- wood 
seems the best adapted to the soil, making straight and clean shoots, 



MINTO. 



375 



and attaining a considerable size and age. The management of 
the plantations is well attended to, more care being bestowed on 
pruning and thinning than is common in some other parts of the 
country. Scarcely any of the trees seem to be older than the 
date of the union, and planting to any extent does not go farther 
back than the middle of last century. The size of some of the 
older trees, however, is such as to deserve notice. A silver fir, in 
the glen below Minto House, has a bole of about 40 feet in length ; 
its girth at 1 feet from the ground is 10 feet 4 inches ; 20 feet 
from the ground, 7 feet 9 inches ; and at 40 feet 7 feet. An ash 
near the house, at 2 feet from the ground, is 14 feet in girth ; at 
10 feet from the ground, 13 feet; and where it divides into 2 
limbs, each of them is 9 feet in circumference. Another ash in 
the policy measures 100 feet in height ; its girth at 2\ feet from 
the surface of the ground is 15 feet, and at 18 feet from the ground 
11 feet. An oak tree was found, at 3 feet from the ground, to 
be 1 1 feet in girth, and at 9 feet to be 9 feet. There is a well- 
grown poplar 90 feet high, with a bole 50 feet long, of which 
the mean girth is 6 feet. Several beeches have attained a good 
size. They would seem to have been the first trees planted near 
mansion-houses in Scotland, and frequently in avenues; they 
commonly branch out a short way from the ground, but are other- 
wise of considerable dimensions. One measures 14 feet round, at 
3 feet from the surface. The most remarkable trees, however, in 
this place are some larches, planted on the top and sides of the 
glen below Minto House, and, it may be remarked, over the 
sandstone rock, which in this instance has had none of the hurt- 
ful effects, ascribed to it by some writers, to wood of this species. 
One of the finest and most characteristic in its appearance, 
close to the pond side, is 80 feet high, and at 3 feet from the 
ground measures 1 1 feet in girth ; at 20 feet from the ground 8 
feet ; and at 40 feet, where it parts into two tops of considerable 
dimensions, 7 feet in circumference. Though of less bulk on the 
whole, a number are taller, reaching 100 feet in height and up- 
wards ; at 25 feet from the ground, they average 6 feet in girth, 
and have a clean and straight bole, varying from 40 to 60 feet long. 
The noble and picturesque character of the oldest of these trees 
cannot be judged of by those who have only seen the larch as a 
thin sapling, drawn up in a crowded and choked plantation, or 
stinted in some bleak hedgerow, and bending from the wind. When 
in a favourable situation, and properly treated, it is not less noble 
and ornamental, than it is valuable from the useful and durable

qualities of the timber. When suffered to assume its natural form, 
which takes place here, it flings out bold and vigorous side brandies, 
starting off from the main stem, and then bending upwards with 
a free and stately sweep, while the slender spray hangs in long 
lines, yielding to the breeze, with its bright lively green, in early 
spring beautifully contrasted with the rich brown of the bark, which 
is sometimes varied by a white and yellowish lichen, and is cut in- 
to rough and deep furrows. An account of the planting of these 
trees has been already given ; there are good grounds to believe 
that they are at present one hundred years old. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Means of Communication. — The parish roads extend to nearlv 
fourteen miles, and have, of late years, been much improved in 
keeping ; the outlay has generally been from L. 1, 10s. to L. 2 
Sterling on each L. 100 Scots, which, as the valuation of the pa- 
rish is L. 5163, 4s. Scots, allows an annual assessment of from 
L. 80 to L. 100 Sterling. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church, which is the only one, 
and is attended by the great bulk of the population, affords ac- 
commodation for 350 persons, exclusive of a private gallery be- 
longing to the Earl of Minto. The average number of commu- 
nicants is 160. 

Poor. — For the last twenty years and upwards, there has been 
very little difference either in the number of persons receiving pa- 
rochial aid, or the allowance made to them. The average of per- 
sons may be stated at 8, and the sum allocated to each L. 7. 
They have, of late, been chiefly aged persons, and non-resident. 
The church collections for the poor, together with the interest 
arisino- from a mortification of L. 50, amount to L. 10, 10s. lOd. 
yearly. 

Education. — Sewing is taught by a female, who also gives some 
elementary instruction to the younger children ; besides this, there 
is only the parish school, which last year was attended by 112 
scholars. The branches taught are reading, writing, arithmetic, 
mathematics, geography, Latin, and French. The teacher has 
the maximum salary, with the interest of a mortification of L. 100. 
He acts as clerk to the heritors and kirk-session. 

There are neither ale-houses nor tolls in the parish, nor, for 
some time past, has there been any resident pauper on the poor's 
roll.

THE REV. WILLIAM S. MARTIN, MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish of Kirktoun extends from 
east to west about 8 miles, and from north to south about 2 miles. 
It is bounded on all sides by the parish of Cavers : on the west, 
it is partly bounded also by the parish of Hawick ; and on the 
north-east, by that of Hobkirk. 

Topographical Appearances. — Its general appearance to the east 
of the river Slitrig, which intersects it, presents an undulating sur- 
face of little green hills, partly adapted to pasturage, but inter- 
spersed also with a good deal of arable land, cultivated according 
to the modern improvements in agriculture ; and had it also been di- 
versified with plantations, of which it is nearly destitute, these would 
not only have rendered it much more beautiful and interesting, but 
would likewise have been of immense benefit, by affording shelter 
to the flocks. On the west of Slitrig, the surface rises immediate- 
ly from the banks of the river to a considerable height, and the 
elevation continues to increase to the extremity of the western 
boundary. 

II. — Civil History. 
Land-oivners. — There are four land-owners or proprietors, none 
of whom are resident in the parish, viz. Sir William Francis El- 
liot, Bart, of Stobs and Wells ; James Douglas, Esq. of Cavers ; 
Archibald Douglas, Esq. of Adderstone ; and Andrew Dickson, 
Esq. of Tofts. 

Eminent Men. — The celebrated orientalist, Dr Leyden, receiv- 
ed part of the rudiments of his education at Kirktoun school. His 
parents, at that time, occupied a cottage on the farm of Nether 
Tofts, called Henlawshiel ; of which scarcely any trace can now be 
discovered. A near relation of Mr Blythe, the present tenant of 
Tofts, kindly assisted in defraying the expenses of his school wages, 
little thinking, no doubt, at that time, of the eminent station at 
which the objectof hisbenevolence was destined afterwards to arrive.

Agriculture. — Since the last Statistical Account was given in, 
the"produce has greatly increased, and many enclosures have been 
made by building dry-stone dikes, planting hedges, &amp;c. On the farm 
of Kirktoun alone, fences have been made to the extent of upwards 
of 1700 roods during the last eight years ; and by the application of 
lime, the soil has been meliorated, and the rent greatly advanced. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 

There is no town or village, no public-house or toll-bar within 
the parish. Hawick, which is situated at the distance of a few 
miles from the most remote district of the parish, is the post and 
market-town. The roads from Hawick to Newcastle and Liddes- 
dale, pass through the parish. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church is situated inconvenient- 
ly, being too near to the eastern extremity, while the majority of 
the population reside in the western district. The church is in a 
very bad state of repair, and the period of its erection is unknown. 
The manse is also much decayed. 

From the relative situation of the parishes of Kirktoun and 
Cavers, several families belonging to the latter attend divine ser- 
vice at Kirktoun. 

Education.— There is a school and schoolmaster's house in the 
neighbourhood of the church. The school is well attended. A con- 
siderable number of the scholars are, however, from Cavers parish. 

Poor.— There are 5 paupers on the roll, one of whom was ad- 
mitted in November last. The collections at the church are so 
small, that the poor are entirely supported by an assessment on the 
heritors and tenants. For several half years bypast, the assess- 
ment amounted to about L. 10, 10s.; the present half-year, it is a 
little higher.

PRESBYTERY OF JEDBURGH, SYNOD OF MERSE 'AND TEVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. J. A. WALLACE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — In the oldest documents to which we have had access 
the orthography of Hawick is but slightly different from what it is 
at the present time, and on that account there is less room for di- 
versity of opinion as to the origin of the name. It is remarked by 
Chalmers in his Caledonia, that the town is probably as ancient as 
the Saxon settlers, whose chief built the mansion of his manor on 
the curve of the Slitridge ; and proceeding upon this fact, he con- 
siders the name to be purely Saxon,— Haw, as he states, on the au- 
thority of Somner, signifying in the Anglo-Saxon, mansis, mansus, 
a mansion-house, and wic, denoting, among other significations, the 
curving reach of a river where hamlets were formerly built. An 
opinion somewhat similar to this is expressed by the writer of the 
former Statistical Account, for he observes that Hawick may be 
derived either from the Celtic, ha, a mansion, and wic, the crook 
or conflux of rivers ; or from the Saxon, haf, the same with our 
halved, and wick, a common termination for a village supposed to 
be formed from the Latin, vicus ; to either of which derivations its 
situation agrees, as the river Teviot washes the side of it towards 
the north, and the smaller river Slitridge divides it nearly into two 
equal parts. It may also be mentioned, in addition to these con- 
jectures, that there are places in the vicinity of the town, known 
by the names of the Common Haugh, the Little Haugh, and the 
Haugh-head ; and as the town is built partly upon one of these 
haugns, it is suggested, that the name may be compounded of the 
bcotch, haugh, synonymous with the Gaelic, augh, and derived, as 
is supposed, from the old Teutonic auwe, signifving a piece of low- 
ly ing Hat ground, and wijck, which, in the same dialect, denotes 
Jtumims sinus, the curving beach of a river. This last etymology, 
while no less appropriate than the others to the locality of the 
town, ,s rendered still more plausible by a reference to the ancient 
war-cry of the inhabitants, which consisted of the words, « Tiribus 



380 



UOXBUUOIISHIIIK. 



and Tirioden," — a phrase which, being retained from the age of the 
Saxons, or borrowed from the Danes of the neighbouring district 
of Northumberland, who have left many words on the border, is al- 
lied, as Dr Jamieson supposes, to the Anglo-Saxon, Tir or Tyr, 
which denotes one of the Teutonic deities, and according to some 
the son of Odin ; and hence, the first word may be understood as 
making tolerably good Anglo-Saxon, Tyr hacbbeus, may Tyrhave 
us in his keeping, whilst the other conjoins the names of Tyr and 
Odin, whose united aid is supposed to be invoked. 

Extent, Boundaries. — The parish extends upwards of 15 miles 
in length, somewhat more on an average than 1 \ in breadth, and 
contains about 24 square miles, or 15,360 imperial acres. It is 
bounded on the north, by the parishes of Roberton and Wilton ; on 
the east, by the parish of Cavers ; on the south, by Cavers and 
Kirktoun ; and on the west, by Eskdalemuir and Westerkirk, in the 
county of Dumfries. 

Topographical Appearances.— The scenery, especially when 
viewed from the lower grounds, if not distinguished by much 
variety or magnificence, is nevertheless singularly interesting 
and beautiful. A sinuous valley passes downwards through 
the whole extent of the parish, contracted for the most part 
within narrow limits, and bordered on either side by a range 
of hills, which rise in some places to a considerable height, co- 
vered to their summits with the finest verdure, and presenting an 
outline more remarkable for its gracefulness than for the wild and 
rugged features which are usually characteristic of mountain sce- 
nery. This vale is beautified and enlivened with the windings of 
the " sweet and silver Teviot," which, taking its rise at the western 
extremity of the parish, meanders for a few miles through a dis- 
trict of green pastures, untouched apparently by the hand of art, 
and lying in all the beautiful simplicity of nature. Joined by the 
Allan and other tributary streams, it then enters into a richer dis- 
trict, passing over ground celebrated in story and in song, gliding 
with a solemn melody between the once festive halls of Branxholm 
and the massive peel of Goldielands; then, meeting the impetuous 
waters of the Borthwick, it skirts the town of Hawick, and, flowing 
onwards to the distance of about two miles beyond it, leaves the 
parish at its eastern extremity. 

In a direction somewhat angular to the course of the Teviot, 
there is another vale not less interesting than the other, though 
characterized by an air of greater wildness and seclusion. This 
forms the bed of the river Slitridge, which crosses the parish m a 



HAWICK. 



381 



northerly direction to the distance of more than two miles, occa- 
sionally flowing with great rapidity over a very rugged channel, 
which, in some places, is skirted with banks of bare rock, rising al- 
most perpendicularly to a considerable elevation, and crowned with 
plantations of young wood, which add not a little to the beauty of 
the surrounding landscape. 

The Slitridge falls into the Teviot immediately after passing 
through the town, which it divides into two parts, the one stretch- 
ing to the east along the banks of the united stream, and the other 
rising on the slope of an adjoining hill to the west, which gives to 
it an appearance exceedingly picturesque when seen from a little 
distance, or viewed from any of the higher grounds that encom- 
pass it on every side. 

These pastoral vales, with the streams that flow through them, 
form the features in the scenery which present themselves most 
prominently to observation, the road to Langholm passing through 
the one, and that to Liddesdale through the other. In these vales, 
however, the prospect, though beautiful, is exceedingly limited. 
But, from the mountain ranges which rise between them, the view 
becomes as different as it is extensive. All around, the spectator 
finds himself environed with a vast panorama of hills, rising over 
and beyond one another as far as the eye can reach, presenting the 
most interesting diversities of form, now darkened, now illuminat- 
ed, by the ever-shifting variations of sunshine and of shade, and 
all pervaded with an air of such profound solitude and stillness as 
can scarce fail to awaken in the mind mingled emotions of plea- 
sure and of awe. 

Meteorology. — From a journal kept by Mr Scott at Silverbit- 
hall, in the neighbourhood of the town, we have drawn up the fol- 
lowing meteorological tables for 1837. The first exhibits the mean 
together with the highest and lowest range both of the barometer 
and thermometer in each of the months ; the second, the mean of 
the barometer and thermometer for the seasons, and for the whole 
year ; and the third, the number of days in which the weather was 
fair, rainy, frosty or snowy.

We may here state, on the authority of Drs Graham and Blytb, 
a few particulars respecting the more prevalent diseases of the 
district. Between thirty and forty years ago, ague prevailed so 
extensively, that nearly a third of the country population was ge- 
nerally labouring under it during the greater part of the year, but 
the extensive drainage of land, together with an improved system 
of agriculture, seems entirely to have banished this complaint. 
The more ordinary febrile diseases continue to occur in the same 
ratio as before, and in some of the higher parts of the parish, where 
the atmosphere is more humid, fevers of a typhoid type and often 
of great malignancy, are frequently met with. On the whole, how- 
ever, the diseases, both in the town and landward part of the pa- 
rish, are generally of a sthenic inflammatory character, though by 
no means of very extensive prevalence. 

The town was twice visited with pestilential cholera. Its in- 
troduction and progress here were as unaccountable as they have 
been in many other places, and the rate of mortality was nearly as

high. It first appeared in the spring of 1832, when only a few 
cases occurred, but in the autumn of the same year it again broke 
out, and continued to rage for four or five weeks. Of nearly 70 
cases that occurred during this period about 30 died. 

There is another disease which is endemic in certain localities, 
more especially in Derbyshire and in some districts of Switzerland, 
of which a good many cases have occurred in this parish. It is 
technically called Bronchocele, and consists of an enlargement of 
the thyroid gland, inducing- great difficulty of breathing, but seldom 
proving fatal. Some families are more subject to it than others. 

Hydrography. — Of the springs which everywhere abound in 
this parish, it may be mentioned, that there are three on the con- 
fines of the Carlisle road, and at the distance of about a mile from 
the town, which, though rising in the immediate vicinity of each 
other, afford water distinguished by qualities altogether different. 
One is obviously calcareous, as appears from the deposit on the 
rocks over which it passes. Another yields water of the purest 
description, free apparently from every foreign admixture. And 
the third is a weak chalybeate, frequently made use of for its me- 
dicinal qualities by the inhabitants of the town, and believed by 
them in many instances to have proved beneficial. These different 
springs rise within the space of 200 yards, proceeding apparently 
from the same kind of rocks, an d passing through the same kind 
of soil. 

Inundation. — An inundation, which usually receives here the 
designation of " Hawick Flood," forms quite an era in the history 
of this place. This event, which occurred in August 1767, was 
occasioned by a fall of rain about the source of the Slitridge no 
less copious than sudden, for in the course of two hours the river 
where it passes through the town had risen upwards of twenty 
feet, and in the space of a similar period, had sunk again to its 
usual level, leaving, however, the traces of considerable devasta- 
tion, the walls of the manse garden being broken down, the pa- 
rish school and a corn-mill destroyed, and an entire street com- 
pletely swept from its foundations, whilst the lives of two indivi- 
duals were lost, and many others endangered, by the violence of 
the torrent. 

Geology. — There is little that is specially deserving of notice 
in the geology of this parish. The rocks consist of greywacke. 
Their direction is south-east and north-west, and the strata, though 
rising nearly perpendicular, have a south-west dip or inclination.

A dike, of a quality somewhat different from the others, runs in a 
direction nearly from east to west, from Rink, in the parish of Jed- 
burgh, to Whitslaid, in the parish of Ashkirk, passing this parish 
in the same direction, cutting the other strata obliquely, and pre- 
serving in every part where visible the same thickness of about 
fifteen feet. The rock appears of a bluish grey colour when 
taken from the quarry, but when long exposed to the atmosphere, 
acquires a yellowish tinge, whilst it seems in many places pene- 
trated by small holes, which in all probability may be occasioned ' 
by the iron that enters into its composition. From its hardness and 
durability it forms an excellent material for roads, to which pur- 
pose it is generally applied. The soil along the banks of the 
streams is for the most part gravelly, and on the other arable lands 
a light loam : there is scarcely any clayey soil in the parish.

II. — Civil History. 
The barony of Hawick appears in Robertson's Index among the 
many charters which were granted in the reign of Robert the 
Bruce, previous to which we have not been able to obtain any sa- 
tisfactory information as to the civil history of this parish. Along 
with Sprouston it was granted to Thomas Murray by David II. 
and descended during the reign of the same monarch to Maurice 
de Moravia, Earl of Strathearn. According to Chalmers it ap- 
pears in 1357 as a burgh of regality. About the beginning of the 
fifteenth century it became the property of Sir William Douglas, 
one of the ancestors of the Queensberry family. This celebrated 
individual who, according to Hume of Godscroft, was an illegiti- 
mate son of James Earl of Douglas, Lord of Liddesdale and Drum- 
lanrig, seems to have signalized himself in no small degree by his 
gallant services against the English on the Scottish border, in con- 
sequence of which he obtained a charter from James I., confirm- 
ing to him the lands of Hawick, together with those of Selkirk 
and Drumlanrig. 

 The original charter, a copy of which is preserved in Anderson's collection, was 
written by the King's own hand, while a prisoner of Henry I V. of England, and runs 
thus • " Jamis, throw the grace of God, King of Scottis, tie all that this lettrc hcrcis or

HAWICK. 



387 



From Sir James Douglas of Drumlanrig, a lineal descendant 
of the above-mentioned knight, the town of Hawick received its 
present charter. This was granted in 1537, and confirmed by 
Queen Mary in 1545. It appears from the charter, which is 
rat her a curious document, though too voluminous to be transcribed, 
that the town had existed as a free burgh of barony from an early 
date ; that the ancient rights had, however, been destroyed amid 
the turmoils of the border wars ; and that, to prevent the evils 
likely to ensue from the loss of such documents, the new charter 
was granted, confirming to the town the lands which they had 
formerly enjoyed, authorizing the burgesses to elect bailies and 
officers for the government of the burgh, and investing the ma- 
gistrates with the power of receiving resignations of lands, or 
granting seisin of the same, according to agreement of parties. 

After the granting of this charter, the barony of Hawick still 
remained for a considerable time in possession of the same family. 
For in 1639 the charter of James I. already quoted, was confirm- 
ed by the Privy- Council of Scotland, in favour of Sir William 
Douglas of Drumlanrig, who, besides inheriting the estates of his 
ancestors, was raised to the dignity of the peerage, being created 
Earl of Queensberry, Viscount of Drumlanrig, and Lord Douglas 
of Hawick and Tibbers. 

At a later period the barony of Hawick descended to the barons 
of Buccleuch, who seem to have exercised a seignorial authority 
over their feudatories till 1747, when hereditary jurisdictions being 
abolished by act of Parliament, the Duke of Buccleuch, as ap- 
pears from the manuscript of the original return, received L. 400 
in compensation for the regality. 

Though holding a less conspicuous place than other towns in 
the district, Hawick has not been altogether undistinguished in 
the annals of border warfare. According to Harding, it was burnt 
down in 1418 by Sir Robert Umfranville, Vice- Admiral of England, 
and Governor of Berwick. It is likewise believed to have suffered 
severely in 1544, when, along with other districts, the whole of

Teviotdale was laid waste by Sir Ralph Evers and Sir Brian 
Latoun. Nor did it escape in 1570 ; for to prevent its occupation 
by the troops of the Earl of Surrey, the inhabitants themselves 
tore the thatch from the roofs of the houses, and set fire to it in 
the streets, by which, with the exception of Don Lamoreck's 
Castle or the Black Tower of Hawick, the whole town was com- 
pletely destroyed. And, whether from the invasion of English 
armies, or from intestine feuds, no less fatal and calamitous among 
the lawless clans of the border, it seems to have been involved, 
during the course of many centuries, in a state of almost perpetual 
war. This state of matters, it is not to be doubted, has had its 
influence in imparting even to the architecture of the town, a some- 
what interesting and peculiar character. For amid the many 
buildings which, in accordance with the spirit of modern improve- 
ment, have been erected in every part of the town, there are still 
standing a few venerable structures, which are not only interesting 
from their antiquity, but which, whilst occupied as ordinary dwell- 
ing-houses, have evidently been constructed as places of security 
and defence, amid the troubles of a warlike age. These ancient 
tenements are built on arches of rough whinstone, whilst the walls 
are of massive thickness, almost defying injury from fire, and ca- 
pable of being stoutly defended, and though they certainly pre- 
sent a somewhat rugged exterior, they seem internally to have 
been planned with no small degree of ingenuity, and must in trou- 
blous times have afforded accommodation to a considerable num- 
ber of families. 

The same causes which gave rise to this peculiar species of archi- 
tecture have had their influence in moulding the general character 
of the population, and thereby impressing upon them certain peculia- 
rities, which, though gradually disappearing like the rough masonry 
of those ancient buildings, are yet sufficiently obvious to arrest the 
notice of any. careful observer. The truth is, the border spirit, a 
spirit certainly more congenial with the usages of a ruder and less 
enlightened age than the present, is not altogether extinct. And 
we doubt much, if a community could be found elsewhere, more 
jealous than they are of what they conceive to be their own rights, 
more keen and indefatigable in the working out of what they reckon 
to be their own interests, and more determined in asserting at all 
hazards what they deem to be essential to their own independence. 
Anything like a spirit of vassalage to any man, or to any class of 
men, how elevated soever in rank, is what they cannot brook, and

any attempt, from whatever quarter, to interfere with their ancient 
or established privileges is sure to be strongly and almost univer- 
sally resisted. There are, moreover, few places where less atten- 
tion is paid to the ordinary distinctions of rank, or where all classes 
are more disposed to associate together on the footing of equality. 
And with respect to the ordinary business of life, they exhibit a 
spirit of activity, and enterprize, and intelligence, which, setting 
every difficulty at defiance, is productive of the most important 
results. In short, there are elements of character amongst them, 
which, if subject to the influence of religious principle and properly 
directed, might raise them to a very high point in the scale of 
moral and intellectual improvement, but which otherwise are not 
unlikely to carry them, as they have sometimes done in seasons of 
political excitement, into excesses, which no right-minded man 
can contemplate with any other than a feeling of unqualified con- 
demnation. 

Eminent Men. — Gavin Douglas, no less celebrated for his poe- 
tical genius than for the nobleness of his birth, was admitted rec- 
tor of Hawick in 1496. Of the works which entitle him to a high 
place in the ranks of our Scottish poets the most valuable now ex- 
tant are the Palice of Honour, King Hart, and a translation of 
the iEneid of Virgil ; and these, it is believed, were produced dur- 
ing his incumbency in this parish. From his superior talents as 
well as the great influence of the family with which he was con- 
nected, being son of Archibald, the celebrated Earl of Angus, he 
was eventually promoted to some of the most important situations 
in the church, being appointed, at different periods, Provost of the 
Collegiate Church of St Giles in Edinburgh, Abbot of Aberbro- 
thock, and Bishop of Dunkeld. He was likewise nominated Arch- 
bishop of St Andrews, but was prevented, by the violent ambition 
of other ecclesiastics, from entering on the duties of this high office. 
From the various persecutions to which he was subjected in those 
unsettled times, he was under the necessity of seeking an asylum 
in London, where he died of the plague in 1522, about the forty- 
eighth year of his age, and was buried in the Savoy Church. 

For profound learning, independence of character, and extensive 
charity, the Rev. Alexander Orrock deserves also to be held in 
grateful remembrance. Whilst holding the rank of a probationer, 
he signalised himself by his stedfast adherence to Presbyterian 
principles, in consequence of which he was at one time subjected 
to imprisonment, and at another interdicted from the discharge of 



390 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



his sacred functions. After the Revolution he became minister of 
this parish, and in 170] he received a call to Kelso, which was 
sustained first by the presbytery and afterwards by the synod; but 
his translation being strongly opposed by the heritors, elders, and 
parishioners in general, and the matter being carried ultimately to 
the General Assembly, it was agreed, in compliance with Mr Or- 
rock's desire, that his connection with this parish should not be 
dissolved, and accordingly he continued to labour here faithfully 
and with acceptance till the period of his death. He left 9000 
merks Scots for the endowment of a grammar school, 1600 merks 
for the poor, four silver communion cups, and a baptismal basin 
for the service of the church, with a very valuable and extensive 
library to his successors in the parochial charge. 

Nor can we forbear reference to the high character and useful- 
ness of Dr John Young, minister of the Antiburgher congregation 
in this place from 1767 to 1806. Giving himself to the discharge 
of his sacred duties with a mind at once stored with the treasures 
of theology, and possessed of extensive acquirements in general 
knowledge, he not only attained considerable celebrity as a preach- 
er amongst the members of his own communion, but his published 
writings, and especially his Essays on Government, for which he 
obtained a pension, part of which is still enjoyed by his family, are 
believed, by their sound views and force of argument, to have ex- 
erted a powerful influence in checking the progress of infidel and 
revolutionary principles, and contributing, at the same time, to the 
best interests of the community. 

 A mural tablet was erected to bis memory, bearing the following inscription, 
which is now in a great measure obliterated, but which it is hoped the heritors will 
renew in the event of the" church being repaired.

HAWICK.

A History of Hawick, to which we have been indebted for a few 
facts embodied in this Account, was published in 1825 by the late 
Mr Robert Wilson, a native of the town. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners in the parish are, His Grace 
the Duke of Buccleuch; Benjamin T. G. Anderson, Esq. of Tushie- 
law; William Turnbull, Esq. of Fenwick; Allan E. Lockhart, 
Esq. of Borthwickbrae ; James Douglas, Esq. of Cavers; James 
Dickson, Esq. of Alton ; James Oliver, Esq. of Burnfiat ; James 
Dickson, Esq. of Housebyres ; and the Town of Hawick. The 
Duke of Buccleuch is proprietor of nearly nine-tenths of the parish. 

Parochial Registers. — The register of births commences in 1634, 
and is continued to the present time, with the exception of two in- 
tervals, the one occurring between 1057 and 1669, and the other 
between 1750 and 1756. 

The register of marriages is defective in several places, but is 
complete from 1699 to 1730, from 1751 to 1800, and from 1834 
to the present time. 

The register of deaths was begun in 1755, and has been regu- 
larly kept ever since. 

The register of money transactions commences in 1724, and 
has been carried down without interruption till now. 

The records of the kirk-session are very defective. From 1700 
to 1704, from 1751 to 1768, and from 1786 to 1798 the entries 
have been made with considerable regularity, but with these ex- 
ceptions, and a few isolated fragments, there has been no continu- 
ous record till recently. 

In looking into these parochial registers one or two points pre- 
sent themselves to notice, which it may not be superfluous to re- 
cord. 

1st. Collections were repeatedly made, about the beginning of 
last century, for the erection of churches in the north, and in other 
places destitute of the means and opportunities of religious wor- 
ship, which shows that the extension of the church, even in those 
days, was not regarded as a matter of indifference. 

2d. Considerable sums were expended by the kirk-session in the 
support of probationers recommended by the General Assembly, 
and also in the education of young men for the ministry, there be- 
ing at least six bursars connected with the parish between 1725 
and 1740, from which we infer that active measures were adopted, 
not merely for the erection of places of worship, but for the rear- 
ing of an ample and efficient ministry.

ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



3d. The cases of gross immorality which occurred during the 
course of about thirty years before the Revolution, and when Epis- 
copacy was predominant, were about double the number that took 
place during the course of thirty years after it, and when Presby- 
tery was restored, which may justify the conclusion, that the exer- 
cise of discipline according to the constitution of the Church of 
Scotland is of signal efficacy in restraining the excesses of profli- 
gacy and crime. 

4th. The kirk-session, in compliance with recommendations from 
the superior courts, were in the frequent practice of setting apart 
days for public fasting and thanksgiving, having special reference 
among other matters to the purity and preservation of the Protes- 
tant religion, which wholesome practice must have tended in no 
small degree to foster in the minds of the people that strong anti- 
pathy to the abominations of Popery which prevailed so extensive- 
ly during the course of last century, and which, though unhappily 
disappearing amid the liberalism of the present times, we cannot 
help regarding as one of the best safeguards both of scriptural 
truth and religious liberty. 

Antiquities. — Situated at the upper extremity of the town, and 
overlooking the main street, there is a relic of great antiquity, 
which is usually denominated the Moat. This consists of an ar- 
tificial mound of earth, which is circular at the base, while it rises 
in a conical form to the height of 30 feet, and is almost flat upon 
the top. It contains about 4060 cubic yards, whilst the circum- 
ference is 117 feet at the top, and 312 at the base. Like tumuli 
of a similar description which are to be met with in other places, 
it is supposed by some to have been used at a distant period as a 
court for the administration of justice, and by others as a place of 
assembly, where the chiefs of the district held their deliberations 
on public affairs. The probability is, that it was employed for both 
of these purposes, and this supposition, whilst justified by local 
tradition, is strengthened by the authority both of Pennant and of 
Sir Walter Scott, although they trace the word to a somewhat dif- 
ferent origin, the one alleging that Mot in the Gaelic language 
signifies a court, and the other suggesting that in the Anglo-Saxon 
it may be translated concilium, conventus. 

The vestiges of several towers or border peels are still remain- 
ing in different parts of the parish. One of the most ancient of 
these places of strength now forms a part of the Tower-Inn, cele- 
brated as the residence in former times of the Barons of Drum- 



HAWICK. 



393 



laiirig, and, at a later period, of Anne Duchess of Buccleuch and 
Monmouth, whose unfortunate husband was beheaded in 1685. 
This tower, which was anciently surrounded with a deep moat 
drawn from the Slitridge, was the only building in the town which 
escaped the devastation of 1570. 

Another of these peels is at present attached to the Castle of 
Branxholm, celebrated as the ancient residence of the family of 
Buccleuch, and invested with additional interest of late, in conse- 
quence of the prominent place which it occupies in the Lay of the 
Last Minstrel. In the reign of James I., it became the property 
of Sir William Scott of Buccleuch, and for a long period after was 
the scene of great baronial splendour, whilst, from its situation and 
the feudal power of the brave barons that successively possessed 
it, it was frequently exposed to the most formidable assaults. It 
was burnt down by the Earl of Northumberland in 1532, and 
blown up with gunpowder during the invasion of the Earl of Sur- 
rey in 1570. It was rebuilt, however, almost immediately after, 
the work being commenced by Sir Walter Scott, and completed 
by his widow, as appears from the following inscriptions : — « Sir 
W. Scott of Branxheim, Knyt, Yoe of Sir William Scott of Kir- 
kurd, Knyt, began ye work upon ye 24 of Marche 1571 zeir, quha 
departitat God's pleisour ye 17 April 1574."—" Dame Margaret 
Douglas, his Spous, completit the forsaid work in October 1576' 
There is likewise the following legend on a tablet over one of the 
doors : 

" IN. VARLD. IS. NOCHT. NATUR, HES. VROUGHT. YET. SAL. LEST AY 
THAIKFORE. SERVE. GOD. KEIP. VEIL. YE. ROD, THY. FAME. SAL. NOCHT. DEKAY 
SHIR VALTER SCOT OF BRANXHOLME, KNYGHT. MARGARET DOUGLAS 

1571." 

Besides these towers, which have lost somewhat of their origi- 
nal appearance by being subjected to frequent alterations and 
repairs, there is another still standing on the brow of a hill at Gol- 
dielands, about two miles distant from the town, which retains very 
much of its primitive character, and is probably as perfect as any 
on the border. It is said to have been the residence, in former 
times, of a family of the name of Goldie, whence it seems to have 
derived its present appellation. It is of a square form, and from 
its massive and venerable appearance, aided by the elevated situa- 
tion on which it stands, forms an object in the landscape as pic- 
turesque as it is conspicuous. 

A bridge leading from the High Street to the parish church is 
also deserving of notice as an object of antiquity. Different in its

structure from any other erection of a like nature in the district, 
it is supposed to have been built at a very remote period, though 
by whom, or at what time, is matter of mere conjecture. Though 
formed of hewn stone, and of considerable strength, it does not seem 
to have been intended for carriages constructed like those of the 
present day, and is, indeed, so narrow as to be used only by foot- 
passengers. But the peculiarity by which it is chiefly distinguished 
is in the formation of the" main arch, which, when viewed from the' 
channel of the river, appears ornamented underneath with a series 
of narrow abutments, rising from either side of the water-course, 
and meeting in a semicircular form above, thus presenting, though 
in a rude form, an approximation to the species of architecture 
which adorns the porticoes of many of the ancient cathedrals. 

A hand-bell, belonging to the magistrates of the town, may next 
be referred to as interesting, alike from its antiquity, and from the 
singular purpose for which it was used. On the occasion of every 
death, it was customary at no very remote period, for one of the 
burgh officers to proceed through the different districts of the town, 
when lifting hishat, and ringingthe bell at regular intervals, he made 
the following announcement to the inhabitants, with an air of great 

solemnity : — " I hereby take ye to wit, that our brother or 

sister departed this life at of the clock, according to the 

pleasure of our Lord." This intimation being made, accompanied 
with a general invitation to the funeral, the bell was then taken to 
the house of mourning, and placed, in a spirit of the grossest su- 
perstition, on the bed where the dead body was lying, and in a po- 
sition from which it was reckoned altogether sacrilegious to remove 
it till the time appointed for the interment. On the upper part of 
the bell there is legibly inscribed in relief hawick, with the let- 
ters R. s. i. d. which are understood to be the initials of the then 
existing magistrates, and on the under part, and in what is said to 
be a corrupt dialect of the Dutch language, ian. bvrgvb. hvis 
heft. my. gegote. anno 1601, signifying John Burgub did make 
literally beget me in the year 1601. Both the inscriptions are 
terminated with the likeness of an antique head. 

An antique jug, of bronze material, having three feet, a handle 
and spout, and probably used as a sacrificial vessel by the Romans, 
was dug up a few years ago at Reasknow, and is at present in pos- 
session of James Grieve, Esq., Branxholm Braes. The same 
gentleman has two ancient coins, which, with many others, were 
discovered in a piece of moss ground at Hislop. One of these is 



HAWICK 



395 



a silver penny of Alexander III., on the obverse side of which is 
a profile of the King, wearing an open crown of three fleurs-de-lys, 
holding a sceptre, and surrounded with the legend " Alexander 
Dei Gra,'' whilst on the reverse side is a broad cross extending to 
the edge of the coin, each quarter of the cross containing a pierced 
star, circumscribed with the words " Scotorum Rex." It is re- 
markable that this coin, though found in an exposed situation, and 
struck nearly 600 years ago, is still in the highest state of preser- 
vation. 

There was likewise found on the borders of the parish a fibula, 
made apparently either of jet or cannel coal, and bearing a fine 
polish. It is conjectured that this material was used by the abo- 
rigines of the country in the manufacture of various articles pre- 
vious to the introduction of metals, and probably about the same 
period when it was customary to make use of stone for the con- 
struction of axes, hammers, arrow-heads, and articles of a similar 
description. 

It may also be added, that a cairn which had long stood on the 
" auld caknow," about two miles distant from the town, was removed 
about thirty years ago. At the depth of six or eight feet from the 
surface of the ground, there were several large stones set on edge, 
somewhat in the form of a rude coffin, and enclosing a human 
skull, with several bones of a more than ordinary size. It being 
well known that the Celtic tribes were in the practice of adopting this 
mode of sepulture, at least with persons of note, it is highly pro- 
bable that these were the remains of one of their distinguished 
chiefs. Sepulchral urns have likewise been dug up in the upper 
district of the parish, which, though considered to be Roman, are 
more likely, from their rude construction, to be the relics of a more 
barbarous and less enlightened people.

to marriages and deaths, the register may be regarded as compre-

There are six proprietors of land of the yearly value of L. 50 
and upwards. 

It appears from the foregoing tables that the gross population 
has been considerably more than doubled since the beginning of 



HAWICK. 



397 



this century, or during the space of thirty-eight years ; and as this 
remarkable increase has taken place chiefly in the town, the po- 
pulation of the landward part of the parish having remained al- 
most stationary since the period of the first census, it may be re- 
garded as a strong evidence of the flourishing state of the woollen 
manufactures, to whose influence, in creating a demand for labour 
and attracting operatives from other places, the increase in the po- 
pulation is mainly to be ascribed. 

Habits and Customs. — Of the customs prevalent in this parish, 
there is none certainly that is less deserving of notice, though none 
that is more characteristic, than that of distinguishing individuals 
by other than the names that properly belong to them. This cus- 
tom was at one time common to the whole district, and was no 
doubt adopted in ancient times for the purpose of drawing a broad- 
er line of distinction between individuals, who, belonging to the same 
clan, and bearing the same name, were not unlikely, but for a de- 
vice such as this, to be frequently confounded with one another. 
And it is somewhat remarkable, that such fictitious designations 
have remained often in the same family, and been handed down 
from father to son in regular succession, through the course of 
many generations. Indeed there are some of the older inhabitants 
of this parish, who in the ordinary intercourse of life have been so 
long accustomed to the conventional usages of the place, that their 
proper names are but seldom used, and by many of their neigh- 
bours are altogether unknown. And even in the register of deaths, 
where it might have been supposed that the evidences of such a 
strange custom were least likely to be traced, there is actually a 
faithful record of the sobriquets by which the ancestors of the pre- 
sent generation were commonly distinguished, a record which, 
however it may be viewed in other respects, does evidently prove 
how completely the practice in question has been interwoven with 
the habits of the people. 

It deserves also to be mentioned, though not peculiar to this pa- 
rish, that, during the course of last century, it was the custom to 
employ only one coffin at the interment of paupers. This, as ap- 
pears from the statements of some of the older inhabitants, was 
used merely for the purpose of conveying them to their final rest- 
ing-place, and was so constructed as to be capable of opening by 
a hinge underneath, by which means the body was permitted to 
escape when lowered down into the grave. It is not to be denied 
that there is something in this mode of interment very much at 



398 ROXBURGHSHIRE. 

variance with the refinement of modern times. Yet we suspect 
that the practice, revolting as it now appears, was considered at 
the time of its introduction as an improvement upon the usages of 
a former age. For we find, that, in the General Assembly held 
at Edinburgh in December 1563, it was specially ordained: — 
" That a bier should be made in every countrie parish to carrie 
the dead corpse of the poor to the burial-place, and that those of 
the villages or houses next adjacent to the house where the dead 
corpse lyeth, or a certain number out of every house, shall convoy 
the dead corpse to the burial-place, and burie it six footes under 
the earth, and that every superintendent request the Lords and 
Barons within his bounds to make an act in their courts touching 
this order, and to cause their officers warn the nearest neighbours 
where the dead corpse lyeth, to convoy it to the grave." 

Another practice has long prevailed in this parish, and is still 
occasionally observed. When any member of a family is consi- 
dered to be dying, the apartment is not only frequented, as in 
other places, with relatives and neighbours, but in many cases the 
whole company unite in an act of religious worship, selecting for 
this purpose one of the psalmsmost suited to the occasion, such, 
for example, as the xxiii. the xliii. or the cxviii., and singing it toge- 
ther with a low and solemn melody, while the soul of the dying 
person is passing into the world of spirits, and not only so, but 
when the mortal struggle appears to be over, it is succeeded by a 
song of triumph and of praise, consisting not unfrequently of the 
following verses from the cvii. Psalm : — 

The storm is chang'd into a calm 

At his command and will ; 
Sq that the waves which rag'd before, 

Now quiet are and still. 

Then are they glad, because at rest 

And quiet now they be : 
So to the haven he them brings 

Which they desir'd to see. 

O that men to the Lord would give 

Praise for his goodness then, 
And for his works of wonder done 

Unto the sons of men  

That this practice has not originated from any species of super- 
si itious feeling we are not prepared to affirm ; nor are we sure that 
the results expected to arise from it are always such as are war- 
ranted by the spirit of genuine and undefiled religion. At the 
same time, it must be admitted, that there is something in the ser- 



HAWICK. 



399 



vice itself which is peculiarly impressive and solemnizing, and we 
doubt not, that when observed, as it is in many instances, with a 
devout and becoming spirit, it is productive of impressions very 
much suited to the solemnity of the occasion. 

The practice of riding the marches is still observed in this pa- 
rish. This ancient ceremonial takes place on the last Friday of 
May, old style, which is considered by more than the youthful por- 
tion of the population as one of the most important days of the 
year. The honour of carrying the standard of the town, the ori- 
ginal of which is said to have been taken from the English shortly 
after the Battle of Flodden, devolves upon the cornet, a young man 
previously elected for the purpose, and he, with the magistrates 
of the town on horseback and a large body of the inhabitants and 
burgesses, set out in regular procession, for the ostensible purpose 
of riding round the property of the town, and making formal de- 
monstration of their legal rights, — a ceremonial, which, however 
necessary in ancient times, when written documents were in con- 
stant danger of being destroyed, may now be considered as a use- 
less form, but which, notwithstanding, is kept up with much spirit 
by the great body of the people, as well from the influence of an- 
cient associations, as from the holiday amusements with which it is 
invariably attended. 

IV. — Industry. 
The following table exhibits the number of families, and their 
respective employments, at different periods : 

 The following are a few stanzas from an ancient song, which seems to embody 
the spirit of the inhabitants on these occasions, and which is sung by the cornet and 
his attendants from the roof of an old tenement belonging to the town, and loudly and 
enthusiastically joined in by the surrounding multitude : 

" We'll a' hie to the muir a-riding, 
Drumlanrig gave it for providing 
Our ancestors of martial order, 
To drive the English off our border. 

At Flodden-field our fathers fought it, 

And honour gained, though dear they bought it , 

By Teviot side they took this colour, 

A dear memorial of their valour. 

Though twice of old our town was burned, 
Yet twice the foemen back we turned, 
And ever should our rights be trod on, 
We'll face the foe to Tiriodcn. 

Up wi' Hawick, its rights and common, 
Up wi' a' the Border bowmen  
Tiribus and Tiriodcn, 
We are up to guard the common."

twenty years of age; and 140 female servants. 

Agriculture. — Great progress has been made of late years in the 
department of agriculture, and this probably will appear sufficient- 
ly obvious by the statement of a few facts : 1. A considerable 
extent of waste land belonging to the town of Hawick has either 
been planted or brought into cultivation, while, on many of the 
farms, similar improvements have been effected, though on a smal- 
ler scale, with respect to land formerly in pasture. 2. Drains to 
a great extent have been made in the sheep pastures, and nume- 
rous stells have been erected for the shelter of the stock. 3. Much 
attention has been paid to the Improvement of the breeds of cat- 
tle and of sheep, and lately with great success, the cattle at the 
Hawick market being now considered equal to those shown at any 
other market for the same kind of stock in the county. 4. The 
Scotch plough is entirely laid aside, while the most approved im- 
plements of modern invention are now in general use. 5. The 
number of carts brought into the town on any ordinary market-day 
amounts generally to about 170, although it is within recollection 
of some of the oldest inhabitants, when there was only one cart, 
the property of the minister, in the whole parish. 

The subjoined tables have reference to the state of agriculture 
in the parish at present. To Mr Elliot of Goldielands we are 
mainly indebted for the particulars they contain.

Farmer's Club.— A farmer's club was established in this town in 
1776, which has contributed in no small degree to the furtherance 
of the agricultural interests of the district. The following extract, 
from a very interesting report drawn up by the secretary, James 
Grieve, Esq. Branxholm Braes, will serve at once to explain the 
object of its institution, and to point out the benefits which have 
resulted from its proceedings : 

" The object of the institution is the improvement of farming, 
and in furtherance of this object the members have given a varie- 
ty of premiums, recommended the institution and regulation of 
markets, and have been in the habit of discussing questions con- 
nected with agriculture, stock-farming, and rural polity in general. 

The club meets on the first Thursday of every month, when the 
members dme together, the chair being taken by each member in 
rotation. A subject has been generally given out one club-day 
tor discussion on the next, and some very interesting questions ap- 
pear in the records of the society. 

Previous to 1778, it would appear that there was no regular corn- 
market in Hawick, for in November that year, the club issued an 
a vertisement of the following tenor :— « Several farmers in the 
eig Dournood of Hawick, being desirous of establishing the prac- 
tice otbnnging samples of corn to market, have agreed, that hence- 
tortn they will appear at the cross of Hawick, betwixt the hours 
ot twelve and one every market-day, upon the ringing of a bell 



402 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



for that purpose, with their samples, and hope that millers and 
others who want corn, will make use of that opportunity of pur- 
chasing." 

The fair at Kink originated with the club, who proposed the 
establishment of it to the proprietor of the ground, Mr Ruther- 
furd of Edgerstone ; and in consequence of every encouragement 
being held out by him, the first fair was held on 15th October 
1779, when there were 2540 sheep exposed to sale. This es- 
tablishment has been of very great use, and, till lately, continued 
to be the most extensive fair for draft ewes and wedders in the 
south of Scotland. A market for hiring hinds and herds was also 
formed at Hawick on the third Thursday of April 1780, which is 
now generally held on the first, second, and third Thursdays of 
that month. In 1785, the club proposed to the magistrates and 
town-council of Hawick, the establishment of a cattle tryst in the 
month of October. This also continues to be held annually, but 
has not been quite so successful as was expected. 

Ploughing matches were held for some years, and premiums 
given to the best ploughman. The first was held on the farm of 
Ashiebank, 15th April 1786, when ten ploughs started. On the 
25th January 1787, the second premium was gained by a servant 
of Sir Gilbert Elliot of Minto, who ploughed with two oxen with- 
out a driver. , 
In 1803, a premium of L. 5 was given for the best bull, and 
L. 3 for the best quey ; next year, additional premiums of L. 3 for 
the second best bull, and L. 2 for the second best quey were added ; 
and these premiums were continued until 1814, when they appear 
to have been superseded by the large premiums given by the bor- 
der Agricultural Society. t 

In 1807, the club had the merit of rousing the attention of the 
public to the great hardships sustained by farmers from the hypo- 
thetical mode of estimating their profits under the Property Tax 
Act The club appointed a committee to collect the sense ot 
the farmers of the county of Roxburgh on this subject, and m con- 
sequence of their recommendation, a general meeting of the ter- 
mers of the county was held at Jedburgh, and steps taken to bring 
their situation under the notice of Government Their exertions 
to procure a repeal or alteration in the mode of assessment were 
continued for several years at a considerable expense : they were 
joined by the "proprietors of land, and Government was at 
last induced to repeal this very unequal tax. 



HAWICK.

In 1826, a''market for cattle and horses, at the recommenda- 
tion of the club, was established at Hawick on the May fair day, 
which promises to be of very considerable utility to the neighbour- 
hood. 

In 1 826, the club appointed a committee to take into considera- 
tion the existing duty of 20s. per cwt. on all grass seeds imported 
into Great Britain ; to draw up resolutions on the subject of pe- 
titioning for its repeal ; and, besides publishing these resolutions in 
the newspapers, to transmit a copy of them to the Highland So 
ciety of Scotland. The subject was taken up by the Highland 
Society, and a good deal of correspondence took place betwixt 
that society and the club, on the subject, of an application to Par- 
liament for a repeal or reduction of the duty, but unfortunately a 
memorial to the Board of Trade was unsuccessful. In 1834, the 
club solicited the attention of Lord Althorpe to this duty, but still 
without the desired effect. 

In 1826, the club paid L. 8 towards defraying the expense of 
a young man attending Mr Dick's Veterinary Lectures in Edin- 
burgh, on condition of his settling as a farrier in Hawick. 

Many very interesting questions have been discussed by the 
club ; but for the first three years after its establishment, the 
opinions of the club were not recorded ; since July 1779, the 
minutes have been chiefly occupied by the insertion of the ques- 
tions submitted to the club, and the answers agreed to. 

These, as appears from the foregoing extracts, are a few of the 
public matters to which the attention of this important association 
has been directed, and in almost every instance with complete 
success. But the utility of the association has not been limited 
to these. Advantages, of equal if not of greater importance, though 
not so easily embodied in the details of a report, have unquestion- 
ably arisen from the frequent and familiar intercourse of the mem- 
bers with one another, and we believe that the circumstance of a 
number of intelligent men meeting regularly together, for the pur- 
pose of imparting the results of their experience and observation 
in regard to matters with which professionally they are most con- 
versant, has contributed mainly and more than any other cause 
to those agricultural improvements, which are manifest in every 
part of the district, and which, whilst they reflect credit on the 
parties from whom they originate, are found to bear, as well on 
the health as on the increased comfort and well being of the po- 
pulation at large.

Agricultural Society. — At the suggestion of James Douglas, 
Esq. of Cavers, and under the patronage of his Grace the Duke 
of Buecleuch, an Agricultural Society for the west of Teviotdale 
was formed here in 1835. The object of this association is, to 
promote the interests of agriculture in general, and more especial- 
ly to give premiums for the most approved breeds of horses, cattle, 
and sheep. The parishes of Ancrum, Ashkirk, Bedrule, Bow- 
den, Cavers, Hawick, Hobkirk, Kirkton, Lilliesleaf, Minto, Ro- 
berton, Southdean, and Wilton are comprehended within the sphere 
of its operations ; and the annual general meeting takes place at 
Hawick on the first Thursday of August. The probable advan- 
tages of this association, it being yet in its infancy, it is scarcely 
possible to estimate at present. In the meantime, however, it 
promises well ; and from the support it has already received, and 
the encouragement to competition and improvement it holds out, 
it is not unreasonable to expect that it will ultimately be of great 
benefit to the district. 

Manufactures. — In this place, employment is afforded to a con- 
siderable number of hands, in the manufacture of thongs, gloves, 
candles, machinery, and in the tanning of leather and dressing of 
sheep skins. But the woollen manufacture is that for which the 
town is chiefly distinguished, and which is specially deserving of 
notice, as well from the extent to which it is carried on at the pre- 
sent time, as from the rapid progress it has been making of late 
years. 

In attempting, however, to give an idea of this department of - 
trade, we find it difficult to keep strictly within the parochial bound- 
ary. Some of the mills are erected on this side of the Teviot, 
and are comprehended within the limits of this parish, and some 
of them on the other, which falls within the parish of Wilton, whilst 
the great majority both of proprietors and operatives are resident 
in the town of Hawick. Instead, therefore, of detaching the one 
altogether from the other, for the sake of adhering to what is pro- 
perly parochial, we deem it better, as they are otherwise very close- 
ly connected, to include them both in the following remarks. 

The working of coarse stockings on the frame was commenced 
by Bailie John Hardie in 1771, and followed upon a larger scale 
by Mr John Nixon in 1780, but little comparatively seems to have 
been done anterior to the introduction of machinery for the spin- 
ning of yarn. This appears to have taken place about the begin- 
ning of this century, from which time, and without any material 



HAWICK.

fluctuation, the woollen manufacture has been progressively advan- 
cing. More especially within the last few years, large additions 
have been made to almost all the mills which had previously been 
established, several new erections also have been completed on a 
very large scale, and at present there are 1 1 extensive factories, 
one of which is driven by steam, and the others by water power, 
besides various buildings of considerable extent for the operation 
of stocking frames. The kind of machinery made use of in the 
mills, consists generally of the common engines for teazing, scrib- 
bling, carding, and spinning, together with doubling and twisting 
machines, which are worked by hand ; and the principal articles 
manufactured are yarns, under clothing, flannels, plaiding, shawls, 
tartans, druggets, cloths of various descriptions, lamb's woof 
hosiery of the finest texture, and blankets, both according to the 
English and Scotch mode of manufacture. From returns with 
which we have been favoured by some of the leading manufac- 
turers, we have constructed the following table, which may give a 
tolerable idea of the state of manufactures in this place for the 
year 1838. 

Value of property employed in manufacture, L. 101,861 0 0 
Annual amount of wages, . . . 48 726 0 0 

Quantity of yarn manufactured, . . . 854 462 lbs 

Annual consumption of wool, . . . 108,162 stones. 

Quantity ot soap consumed, . . . 102 899 lbs 

Number of stockings made, . . .' 1049,676 pairs. 

Articles ot under clothing, ... 12 552 

Number of operatives, .... . 1788 
Number of stocking-frames, . . , 1209 

Number of weaving-looms, . . _ 226 

In addition to the operatives specified in the preceding table, 
it may be mentioned, that a considerable number of females ob- 
tain regular employment in sewing stockings ; but as these are ge- 
nerally engaged not by the proprietors of the factories, but by the 
stocking-makers, it is difficult to ascertain the exact number. It 
may also be noticed, that the manufacturers are in the practice of 
giving employment to weavers and stocking-makers in almost every 
parish m the district to the extent of at least twenty or thirty miles 
from the town. Besides, there are a good many smiths, carpenters, 
masons, mill-wrights, and needle-makers, who are mainly if not di- 
rectly dependent on this branch of commercial enterprize, and of 
course its influence, both in affording the means of subsistence, 
and in the circulation of capital, is much more extensive than is 
made to appear from the foregoing details. 

In closing our remarks on this subject, we cannot help remark- 



406 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



ing, that it is not a little singular, that in a district 6uch as this, 
these manufactures should have been carried on with such spirit, 
and to so great an extent. The expense of fuel, the distance of 
any sea-port town, and the want of railroads, canals, or navigable 
rivers, must have operated, it is to be supposed, very strongly 
against the introduction or prosperity of this branch of industry. 
Yet in spite of these formidable obstacles the trade has been pro- 
secuted with a degree of activity, enterprise, and success, which, 
whilst highly creditable to the manufacturers themselves, has 
added not a little to the value of property in the town, given a fresh 
stimulus to every other department of trade, and afforded, more- 
over, a readier market to the produce of the agricultural districts. 

g 

V.— Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town. — Hawick is a market-town, and also a burgh of 
barony and regality. The public functionaries consist of two 
bailies elected annually by the burgesses, fourteen deacons or re- 
presentatives of the incorporated trades, and fifteen councillors 
who hold office for life. The senior magistrate is a justice of 
peace ex officio. The landed property of the burgh amounts to 
1090 acres, and the gross revenue to upwards of L. 470 per an- 
num. In the town there are two printing-presses, three public 
reading-rooms, and three banks. The subscription rooms used 
occasionally for public meetings, the town-hall, the parisb church, 
and four Dissenting chapels, are the principal public buildings. 
The general appearance of the town has been very much altered 
of late years. New streets have been built in all directions for the 
accommodation of the increasing population, whilst many of the 
older tenements with their thatched roofs have been entirely re- 
moved to make way for buildings more accordant with the taste of 
modern times. By means of these alterations the dwelling-houses 
in general have not only been rendered better in point of comfort 
and accommodation, but the shops also, both as respects their ap- 
pearance and the quality of the various commodities they supply, 
have undergone the most obvious and important improvements. 
The town is well supplied with water, and is lighted with gas, 
whilst the inhabitants are almost entirely free from the burden of 
local taxation. 

Post-office.— It appears from Wilson's History that, " previous to 
the establishment of the post-office in Hawick about seventy or 
eighty years ago, the letters, which were brought from Jedburgh 
by a common hawker, once a month, were exposed on a stall in 



HAWICK. 



407 



the street on the market day like so many cakes of ginger-bread, 
and that the people used to look at them with as much curiosity 
as the botanists of the present day would do at a few exotic plants 
from Van Dieman's Land." In contrast with this statement, and 
as showing the advance that has taken place in the commercial 
prosperity of the town, we deem it of importance to mention, that 
during the course of 1838, there were transmitted through the 
post-office 31, 148 letters, and 9932 newspapers, whilst the revenue 
amounted to about L. 1000. 

Roads. — The length of the turnpike roads in the parish extends 
to about eight and a-half, and that of the statute labour to about 
twenty-five miles. The condition of both has been very much 
amended of late years, but the improvement is more observable 
in the immediate neighbourhood of the town. Towards the east- 
ern extremity, an elegant and substantial bridge has been erected 
over the Teviot, from which the line of communication is carried 
by an easy access into the main street, instead of passing, as for- 
merly through the village of Wilton, where the road, being both 
steep and narrow, was found to be exceedingly dangerous ; and 
an improvement of at least equal importance has been effected by 
a total alteration of the road leading into the town from the west, 
by which means a very considerable acclivity is avoided, and a 
beautiful approach of ample width and almost level is opened up 
along the valley of the Teviot. The entrance to the town, both 
from the east and west, is likewise considerably improved by 
passing through a fine range of nursery grounds. 

Means of Communication, — Besides carriers to various places, 
four mails pass through the town daily, two of them from Edin- 
burgh, and two from London, by way of Carlisle. There is like- 
wise a coach from this to Edinburgh three times a-week, and an- 
other to Jedburgh and Kelso every Tuesday and Friday. 

Bridges. — There are eight stone bridges, most of which are mo- 
dern erections, three over the Slitridge, and five over the Teviot. 
They are upon the whole in good repair. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church, as appears from the 
ancient chronicle of Melrose, was dedicated to St Mary, in 1214, 
and in the Roll of Bagimont, an ecclesiastic, who was commission- 
ed by the Pope, in 1275, to collect the tithes of all the benefices 
in Scotland for the relief of the Christians in the Holy Land, the 
rectoria de Havick is valued at L.16. It is alleged by Chalmers 
in his Caledonia, though upon what authority he does not state, 



408 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



that this church, instead of being used only for spiritual purposes, 
was employed as a court house long after the Scots canons had 
prohibited such an abuse ; and in proof of this assertion, he men- 
tions, that it was here, in 1342, that the celebrated Sir Alexander 
Ramsay of Dalhousie was exercising his judicial functions as She- 
riff of Teviotdale, when he was rudely assaulted by Sir William 
Douglas of Liddesdale, and carried off to Hermitage Castle, in 
one of whose solitary dungeons he was left to perish of hunger. 
Nor was this sacred edifice profaned by acts of violence merely, 
whilst prostituted to other purposes than the celebration of reli- 
gious worship. It seems also in ancient times to have been made 
the scene of the grossest superstition. For we find from the 
charter granted to the town by Sir James Douglas of Drumlanrig, 
that several particates of land were not only allocated to the chap- 
lain of Hawick, but that special provision was made " for finding 
and furnishing one lamp or pot of burning oil before the altar of 
the blessed Virgin Mary, within the parish church, at the time 
of the great mass and the vesper or evening prayers, all the holi- 
days of the year, in honour of our Saviour Jesus Christ, and pray- 
ing for the souls of the Barons of Hawick, founders of the foresaid 
lamp, and their successors." 

The present church, which is situated about fourteen miles from 
the western and one and a-half from the eastern boundary of the 
parish, was built in 1764, and has neither been enlarged nor ma- 
terially altered since that time. Though devoid of every architec- 
tural embellishment, it has the advantage of a good site, being 
built on a circular rising ground in the centre of the town, and, 
though somewhat difficult of access, is, in point of locality, conve- 
niently situated for the great mass of the population. It so hap- 
pens, however, that the accommodation is not only exceedingly in- 
adequate, inasmuch as there are sittings only for 704, whilst the 
population of the parish amounts to 5998, but the great body of 
the people who are resident in the town, and who amount to 5306, 
have, strictly speaking, no legal right to any part of the accommo- 
dation it affords. Two-thirds of the entire area were originally al- 
located to the heritors and tenants in the landward part of the pa- 
rish, whilst the other third, affording accommodation to about 234, 
is all that is reserved for the town, and not only so, but even this 
part of the church, limited as it is, is accessible to those only who 
are either proprietors, or are capable of paying a considerable 
seat-rent. There are, moreover, no sittings set apart for the poor 



HAWICK. 



409 



with the exception of benches inconveniently placed in the passa- 
ges, and these, capable of accommodating about 33, with all the 
other sittings, whether let or allocated, are not only fully occupied, 
but the stairs to the pulpit and to both the galleries are generally 
crowded. 

Various attempts have been made for the purpose of removing 
the evils under which the parish has been suffering from such a 
sad deficiency in the means and opportunities of religious worship. 
So far back as 1802, the subject was strongly pressed on the at- 
tention of the heritors, by a petition from the magistrates, town- 
council, and kirk-session, and, after various meetings and delibera- 
tions, they have at length agreed as to the necessity of having a 
new church capable of accommodating 1500, and have recorded 
their opinion to that effect. There seems, however, to be no im- 
mediate prospect of this plan being carried into execution, as se- 
veral formidable obstacles remain yet to be removed. 

1. The present church is not legally condemned, and, from the 
opinion of competent judges who have carefully examined it, is still 
in a sound and sufficient state, though uncomfortable in the ex- 
treme, and in every point of view unfit for a place of religious 
worship. 

2. A large majority of the heritors, in accordance with the feel- 
ings of the great body of the people, have resolved on the erection 
of the new church on the site of the present building. This, how- 
ever, cannot be effected, so as to accommodate the requisite number, 
without encroaching considerably on the adjoining burying- 
grounds, which is decidedly objected to by one or two individuals, 
whose opposition is strengthened by the fact, that the church is 
not legally condemned. 

3. The difficulties have been somewhat increased by certain 
parties claiming right to act as heritors, on the ground of their 
being assessed for the poor, although they are not rated in the 
county cess-books, and have never paid any portion of assessment 
tor parochial buildings. 

It ought not to be omitted, that His Grace the Duke of Buc- 
cleuch, influenced by a laudable regard for the best interests of 
the people has resolved, in the meantime, to build an additional 
cnu.ch at his own expense— a measure which, while urgently re- 
quired, is likely, when carried into effect, to prove of great benefit 
to the community.

Scripture Reader. — The office of Scripture reader has been kept 
up in this parish from time immemorial, though unattended with 
the abuses which fell under the cognizance and condemnation of 
the General Assembly about the middle of the sixteenth century. 
The office is generally conferred on the parish schoolmaster, who 
receives a small salary from the funds of the kirk-session ; and the 
duty consists simply in reading portions of the sacred Scriptures 
in the parish church on the Lord's-day, before the commencement 
of the morning service, and during the interval of public worship. 

Caerlanrig Chapel. — Connected with the Establishment there 
is no other place of worship in this parish. There is, however, a 
small chapel at the distance of about nine miles from the town, 
which, though situated in the parish of Cavers, is accessible to 
such of the population as are beyond reach of the parish church. 
This chapel or preaching station was built for the accommodation 
of a district, partly belonging to the parish of Hawick, and partly 
to the parish of Cavers. It was seated by subscription, and is ca- 
pable of containing about 200. None of the seats are let : the 
subscribers have the .right of occupation. The chapel has no con- 
stitution, and the preacher who officiates there regularly is not or- 
dained. The ministers of Hawick and Cavers dispense the sacra- 
ment of the Lord's supper alternately, and celebrate marriages and 
baptisms in the district as often as required. A manse was built 
recently at the expense chiefly of the Duke of Buccleuch, but the 
stipend, which is strictly of a voluntary description, is very inade- 
quate. 

Dissenting Chapels. — Besides a chapel belonging to the Society 
of Friends, but frequented only by two families from this parish, 
and a small congregation of Independents, whose members amount 
to 18, and whose ordinary place of meeting is a school-room, there 
are two places of worship in connection with the United Associate 
Synod, and a Relief meeting-house. With regard to the three 
last, we have extracted the following details from the Report of 
the Royal Commissioners lately appointed to inquire into the 
means and opportunities of religious worship in Scotland. It is

Education. — In 1711, the sum of 9000 merks Scots was left 
by the Rev. Alexander Orrock, minister of this parish, under pro- 
vision of its remaining as a perpetual mortified fund, and the in- 
terest given yearly to the schoolmaster of Hawick, on condition of 
his teaching such poor children gratis as might be found by the 
minister and heritors to have a genius for learning. Accordingly, 
the benefit of this mortification was originally enjoyed along with 
the parochial salary by the teacher of the parish school. At a 
subsequent period, however, the parochial salary was given to one 
teacher, and the interest of Orrock's mortification to another, and 
the two schools remained separate for a period of about fifty years. 
In 1824, it was deemed expedient to revert to the original ar- 
rangement, and accordingly it was proposed and agreed to : 

1. That the schools be united under one rector, having right 
both to Orrock's mortification, and to the parochial salary. 

2. That the rector be obliged at all times to keep an able as- 
sistant qualified to teach writing, arithmetic, and mathematics. 

3. That the assistant be appointed by, and removable at, the 
pleasure of the rector. 

4. That the entire salary, together with school-fees and other 
emoluments, be divided between the rector and assistant, in the 
proportion of three-fifths to the former and two-fifths to the latter, 
and that all necessary expenses connected with the establishment 
be defrayed in the same proportions. On this footing these schools 
now stand. 

The parochial salary amounts to L. 33, the interest of Orrock s 



HAWICK. 



413 



mortification to L. 19, Is. lid., and the school-fees on an average 
are estimated at L. 90. L. 17 are also allowed in lieu of a dwel- 
ling-house. The branches of instruction taught are, reading, writ- 
ing, arithmetic, geography, mathematics, Latin, Greek, and 
French ; and the fees for reading are, 2s. 6d. a quarter, with writ- 
ing, 3s. ; arithmetic, 3s. 6d. ; French and mathematics, 5s. 6d. ; 
Latin and Greek, 10s. 6d. The nomination to the united school 
is vested in the Duke of Buccleuch. 

In 1804, the heritors endowed an additional school in the vil- 
lage of Newmill, in the landward part of the parish. The salary 
amounts to L. 12, and the school-fees on an average are estimated 
at L. 18. 

Besides these there are 10 schools carried on by teachers on 
their own adventure. Six of the teachers are females, and in most 
of these schools the elementary branches of education are tauglit, 
and at much the same rate as in the parish school. A subscrip- 
tion school was also established a few years ago, which is gradual- 
ly progressing. 

There are likewise 24 Sabbath schools on the local system, and 
in connexion with the Establishment, besides 4 under the super- 
intendence of the Dissenters. 

The following table gives the average numbers attending the 
week-day schools in 1835. It ought, however, to be noticed, that 
the numbers that attended more or less through the course of the 
year were considerably greater than those stated in the table, it 
being found, for example, from the lists of one of the schools which 
were kept with great accuracy, that the gross number of children 
that attended during any part of the year amounted to 191, whilst 
the number in attendance at one and the same time was never more 
fc han 85.

The numbers learning different branches in 1838 were as follows : 
reading, 720 ; writing, 263 ; arithmetic, 186 ; English gram- 
mar, 74; geography, 78; mathematics, 16; modern languages, 15; 
Latin or Greek, 14. 

Individuals brought up in other parishes are occasionally met 
with, whose education in early life appears to have been totally 
neglected. It is not, however, known that there are any of the na- 



414 ROXBURGHSHIRE 

tive population above fifteen years of age who cannot read. Yet, 
though the people generally are alive to the benefits of education, 
it is nevertheless to be regretted, that the attendance of not a few 
of the children at school is neither so regular, nor so long con- 
tinued as is necessary to a thorough instruction, even in the ordi- 
nary branches of education. 

Libraries.— Hawick is well supplied with libraries. The oldest 
and most extensive is the Public Library, which was established in 
1762. The proprietors of shareholders, whose annual subscription 
is 10s. each, amounted, in 1838, to 56; and others who are not 
shareholders upon being recommended by a proprietor, and pay- 
ing 15s. yearly, are entitled to receive books. This library con- 
tains about 3500 volumes, with the leading periodicals of the pre- 
sent day. 

The Trades 1 Library was instituted in 1802, and contains about 
1200 volumes, including an excellent selection of the most ap- 
proved works in English literature. The yearly payment is 4s. 
Till 1830 the average number of subscribers did not exceed 40. 
They now amount to 135. The Juvenile Library, under the 
charge of the minister of the parish, contains upwards of 300 vo- 
lumes chiefly of a religious description. This library was original- 
ly instituted for the children attending the Sabbath schools, but 
the books are lent out at present to any parishioner on the pay- 
ment of 2d. monthly. 

There are likewise libraries of a similar description, for the land- 
ward part of the parish, both at Teviothead, and at the village of 
Newmill. 

School of Arts.— A School of Arts was established m 1824, 
under the auspices of James Douglas, Esq. of Cavers. Since its 
formation several courses of lectures have been delivered. 

Clothing Society. — A society was instituted in 1821 for distri- 
buting articles of clothing to indigent females. It is judiciously 
managed by a committee of ladies. The yearly expenditure amounts 
to about L. 20. 

Friendly Societies.— There were lately two Friendly Societies in 
the town, which were of much benefit in promoting industrious ha- 
bits, and exciting a desire of independence. The one was esta- 
blished in 1779, and the other in 1802, but being founded, like 
many others, on defective principles, both of them have been dis- 
solved. Their places, however, have been so far supplied by va- 
rious associations, though on a smaller scale, among tlie operatives 



HAWK k. 



415 



of the different manufactories. — A Temperance Society, a Medi- 
co-Relief Society, an Association for the Distribution of Religious 
Tracts, and a Home Missionary Society, have also been produc- 
tive of good results. 

Savings Bank.— A Savings Bank was established in 1815, which 
has been productive of the best results, and which is still going on 
prosperously. During the two years ended May 1815 and 1816, 
the sum deposited was L. 1750, 9s. 8d., whilst the amount with- 
drawn was no more than L. 21. During the years ended May 1837 
and 1838, the receipts amounted to L. 3066, 13s. 2£d., and the 
disbursements to L.2739, 10s. l|d. At last balance, May 1838, 
the gross amount invested was L. 6857, 19s. 8d., and the total 
number of accounts open with depositors 483. 

Pauperism. — About the beginning of last century the poor of 
this parish seem to have been supported entirely from church col- 
lections and other funds in the hands of the kirk-session, and the 
expenditure at that time was somewhat below L. 20 per annum. 
Between 1730 and 1740, recourse appears to have been had to an 
assessment more apparently of a voluntary than compulsory de- 
scription, it being stipulated that the landward heritors and their 
tenants should pay one-half, the town one-fourth, and the kirk-ses- 
sion the other fourth. In 1772, the assessment amounted to 
L. 224, 14s. 3d. ; but the funds of the kirk-session being found in- 
sufficient to meet the proportion that fell to their share, it was 
agreed from- that time forward that L. 5 should be paid by them 
quarterly, whilst of the remainder that was necessary two-thirds 
were to be exacted from the heritors, and the other third from the 
town. This arrangement seems to have been carried into effect 
until 1811, since which time the collections and other sessional 
funds have, for the supply of occasional cases, been leffi entirely 
at the disposal of the kirk-session, whilst the main burden of pro- 
viding for the poor has been divided between the landward heri- 
tors and the proprietors' of heritable property in the town, the for- 
mer being assessed according to their valued rent, of which the 
gross amount is L. 11591, lis. Scots money, and the latter ac- 
cording to the rental of their premises, which amounted, as ap- 
pears from a valuation taken in 1838, to L. 7650, 12s. Sterling. 
This system is in operation at the present time. The heritors 
meet once a quarter for the purpose of imposing the assessment, 
fixing the rate of allowance, and appointing a committee of their

The highest rate allowed to paupers on the permanent roll is 
L. 11, 14s. per annum, and the lowest L. 2, 12s. 

Such is the state of pauperism in this parish at the present 
time. It seems, however, to have been very different in former 
days. We find, for example, in 1727, anterior to the imposition 
of the legal assessment, before any voluntary contribution was 
made regularly on the part of the heritors, and when the poor 
were supported entirely by church collections and other funds in 
the hands of the kirk-session, that the total expenditure, as appears 
from existing records, amounted only to L. 22, 18s. lOd. ; whereas, 
in 1837, as is evident from the foregoing tables, there was actually 
expended no less a sum than L. 1009, 9s. 9d. Considering that 
the population of the parish has been considerably more than 
doubled during the last hundred years, it would not have been 
surprising if the expenditure for the poor had been increased in 
nearly the same proportion. But the rise from L. 22, 13s. lOd. 
to upwards of L.1000 is by far too great to be satisfactorily ac- 
counted for by such a cause. And we cannot help thinking, that 
the increase is to be referred mainly to the influence of a compul- 
sory assessment, which, by destroying a spirit of honourable inde- 
pendence, has tended to augment by a rapid process the very evils 
against which it professes to provide ; whilst the necessity for the 
continued operation of such a cause, we feel inclined-to ascribe in 



HAWICK. 



417 



a great measure to the fact, that the parochial system, which in 
other places has been found the most effectual of all checks both 
to pauperism and crime, has been prevented, by a deplorable de- 
ficiency of church accommodation and pastoral superintendence, 
from being brought into full and efficient operation in this parish. 

In connexion with the same subject, we deem it of importance 
to record the following facts : 1. Marriages are frequently con- 
tracted by parties without making any previous provision for the 
maintenance of a family. 2. The practice of working only so 
many days in the week as is barely necessary for the earning of a 
livelihood is adopted by a large number of the operatives. 3. 
The savings bank and institutions of a like nature are supported 
almost exclusively by the church-going population. 4. Applica- 
tions, especially in seasons of domestic affliction, are made for 
parochial relief, and apparently without much feeling of degrada- 
tion, even by families, who, by industrious exertion and provident 
habits, might have raised themselves to a state of honourable in- 
dependence. 5. Instances of heads of families clandestinely ab- 
sconding from the parish, and leaving their wives and children to- 
tally unprovided for, are of frequent occurrence. 

These facts we leave to speak for themselves, remarking only, 
that it is somewhat mortifying to find that such evils should exist 
to so great an extent in a parish where the most liberal provision 
has been made on the part of the heritors for the purpose of meet- . 
ing the necessities of the poor, and when, moreover, it is borne in 
remembrance, that the assessment itself, exclusive of collections 
and other voluntary contributions, has amounted, since the begin- 
ning of this century, to upwards of L. 31,850, it is at least deserving 
of consideration, whether the adoption of a different system, and 
the application of a liberal expenditure to the purpose of moral 
and religious training, would not bear more successfully on the com- 
fort and moral well-being of the poorer classes of the community, 
and peradventure relieve the heritors in a great measure from the 
burden of a now large and rapidly augmenting assessment. 

Prison.— The Jail, which forms a part of the town-house, and 
consists of a very small apartment, is neither properly secured, 
nor capable of being used without endangering the health of its 
inmates. For these reasons criminals are generally conveyed to 
the county town, a mode of procedure which is not only attended 
with considerable expense, but which, when taken in connexion 
with a glaring deficiency of police, presents serious obstacles to 



418 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



the authorities in arresting the progress of crime and enforcing the 
authority of the laws. The number of convictions, inclusive of 
cases brought not only before the magistrates and justices of peace, 
but before the Sheriff, and the circuit court at Jedburgh, amount- 
ed in 1838 to 58. 

Spirit Licenses. — The number of spirit licenses granted to inn- 
keepers, grocers, and others in the parish, from Whitsunday 1838, 
to Whitsunday 1839, amounted to 53, and it is not to be doubted 
that these have exerted a prejudicial influence on the morals of 
the people. 

Fairs. — Markets for cattle and for hiring servants are held ge- 
nerally on the 17th of May,— for sheep on the 20th and 21st of 
September,— for horses and cattle on the third Tuesday of Octo- 
ber, — and for cattle and hiring servants on the 8th of November. 
These markets are in general very numerously attended. 

Fuel— Both, wood and peats are occasionally used,; but the 
principal fuel is coal, brought partly from Etal, in Northumberland, 
and partly from the Duke of Buccleuch's pits in the neighbourhood 
of Langholm. From the distance of land carriage the expense of 
this article is considerable, the average price being about Is. Id. 
per cwt. It is computed that 7000 cajt- loads are consumed in Hawick 
annually, which are estimated at upwards of L. 6000. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

The state of matters in this parish at the present time is widely 
different in almost every respect from what it was at the period of 
the former Statistical Account. In the enlargement of the town, 
the increase of the population, the erection of extensive factories, 
the construction of new roads, the revenue of the post-office, the 
system of husbandry, the rate of wages, and the state of the mar- 
kets, we discern evidences of a change no less rapid than remark- 
able. And in all that relates to rural economy and commercial 
enterprize, we believe there are few places of equal extent that 
have effected more with the means placed at their disposal, or 
risen by their own vigorous exertions to a higher and more inde- 
pendent position. It were well if, in matters of greater moment, 
and more especially in regard to the means and opportunities of 
moral and religious improvement, they had enjoyed advantages as 
ample as their circumstances required, for in that case the virtues 
of the population might have kept pace with their success In the 
ordinary business of life. But in this respect they have laboured

419 



under great disadvantages, and, however much to be lamented, it 
is nothing more than might have been expected, if, in these cir- 
cumstances, there has been a more than ordinary increase of pau- 
perism, insubordination, and crime.

<p>

PRESBYTERY OF KELSO, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TEVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. JOSEPH THOMSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, and Extent. — Ednam, contracted, from 
Edenham, signifies a hamlet on the river Eden, and is descriptive 
of the situation of the village. In its form this parish approaches to 
a square; its greatest length being 3£ miles, and its greatest breadth 
3 miles. It comprehends nearly 6 square miles. Ednam is 
bounded on the north by Eccles ; on the west, by Stitchel, part of 
Nenthorn, and Kelso ; on the south, by Kelso and Sprouston ; and 
on the east, by Eccles and Sprouston, from which last mentioned 
parish it is separated by the river Tweed. 

Topographical Appearances. — Ednam hill, the only one in the 
parish, shelters the village on the east. It rises to no great height, 
being arable to the top, but commands a very extensive view of the 
surrounding country. The scenery in this parish, though not mark- 
ed by any very striking feature, is highly pleasing. The vale of 
the Eden is extremely beautiful, and on each side of it is a gently 
undulating surface, ornamented with trees in clumps and in hedge- 
rows, and covered with the fruits of a rich and cultivated soil. 

Climate. — No distempers prevail, which can be traced to local 
causes ; and the general state of health in this district is such as 
to evince the salubrity of the climate. 

Rivers. — Except the Tweed, which runs in a north-easterly di- 
rection, the Eden is the only stream belonging to Ednam. This 
small river has its source in the parish of Gordon ; after passing 
through the parishes of Earlston, Smailholm, and Nenthorn, it forms 



420 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



for a short way the boundary between Ednam and Kelso ; and 
then dividing the former parish into two unequal parts, it falls into 
the Tweed about three miles and a half below Kelso. 

Soil, 8fc. — The land in this parish consists of the following va- 
rieties of soil in nearly equal proportions, viz. loam with a gravelly 
subsoil ; clay upon rather a porous subsoil ; light gravel with po- 
rous subsoil, and a light soil upon strata of moorland. These soils 
rest principally upon a freestone bottom. 

II. — Civil History. 

The first settlement which took place at Ednam is believed to 
have been, next to that at Jedburgh, the earliest in this part of 
the country. There is no history of this parish either printed or 
in manuscript, and no individual resident in it possesses any docu- 
ment illustrative of its history or antiquities ; nor is its name as- 
sociated with any important historical event. From the chartu- 
lary of Kelso, and other documents referred to in the " Monastic 
annals of Teviotdale," it would appear that the parish of Ednam 
had contributed to the support of the monks of the convent of Kelso. 
Besides the privilege of digging turf for fuel in Ednam moor, and 
the fishing in the Tweed from the bounds of Kelso to those of 
Birgham, the monks had three ploughgates of land, and also 
Ednam mill, with power to prevent the erection of any other 
within the parish, and to enforce the services which the inhabi- 
tants were bound to render to the proprietor of the mill. 

Eminent Men.— James Thomson, author of the Seasons and 
other poems, was born in the village, most probably in the manse 
of Ednam, in the year 1700. He was the son of Thomas Thom- 
son, the first minister settled in Ednam after the Revolution, — 
and of Beatrix Trotter, his wife. This parish cannot be expect- 
ed to furnish any traditionary recollections of Thomson. When 
he was little more than a month old, his father was translated 
to Southdean ; and there is no reason to believe that the poet 
had any further connexion with the place of his nativity. He 
received the rudiments of education in the town of Jedburgh. 
His earliest poetical efforts are said to have been encouraged and 
directed by the Rev. Robert Riccaltoun, minister of Hobkirk ; and 
after finishing his course of study in the University of Edinburgh, 
he left Scotland, and never returned to it. In the year 1819-20, 
an obelisk, 52 feet high, was raised to his memory. It stands 
on a rising ground within the property of Mr Waldie of Hender- 
syde, nearly a mile from the village. The expense of this erec- 



EDNAM. 



421 



tion was defrayed by subscriptions contributed or promoted by 
the members of the Ednam Club, which was composed of several 
gentlemen living in the parish and neighbourhood, who used to 
meet and dine together in the village on the anniversary of the 
Poet's birth. Their last meeting was held in September 1819. 
A miniature of the poet from a painting in the collection of the 
late Earl of Buchan was presented to the club by his Lordship, 
and is kept in the manse. 

The late William Dawson, Esq. of Graden, a distinguished 
agriculturist, who introduced the turnip husbandry into Scotland, 
was born at Harpertown, in this parish ; and there is some reason 
to believe, from a comparison of the biography of Captain Cook 
with the parish register, that the father of the circumnavigator 
was a native of Ednam. 

Landholders. — The landholders in this parish are, Lord Ward, 
the proprietor of the estate of Ednam; John Waldie, Esq. of 
Hendersyde ; Moffat, Esq. ; Sir William Don, Bart. ; Ro- 

bert Thomson, Esq., formerly one of the magistrates of Edin- 
burgh ; and Sir William Dickson, Bart. 

Modem Buildings. — Hendersyde Park, the residence of Mr 
Waldie, is the only mansion-house in the parish. 

There are three corn-mills and a brewery. 

Parochial Registers. — February 6, 1668, is the date of the 
earliest insertion in the register of baptisms. In this register there 
is one considerable blank, owing, probably, to the loss of one of the 
books. 

III. — Population. 

According to a census taken with great care between the 14th 
and 25th of May 1838, the population of this parish then amounted 
to 589 ; of which number 274 were males, and 315 females. There 
were at that time 118 families. One landholder is resident 

The means of subsistence and the comforts of life are as gene- 
rally diffused here as in any other part of the country ; and, with 
not very many exceptions, the people are peaceable, sober, indus- 
trious, and attentive to the ordinances of religion. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture, 8fc— -There is no waste land in this parish. Of 
about 3700 acres of arable land, two parts are in corn, two in 
pasture and hay, and one part is in turnips and fallow. There are 
40 acres in policy, 70 in pasture along the banks of the rivers, and 



422 



KOXBUUUHSHIRU. 



about 70 planted with trees of almost every description. The 
average rent both of arable ground and of pasture is about L. 2 
per acre. 

Wages.— The wages of agricultural labourers vary with the price 
of grain, in which they are most frequently paid. Ten shillings 
per week is about the average amount of what, is earned by such 
of them as are paid in money, and by day-labourers in general. 
Journeymen masons and carpenters earn higher wages. 

Live-Stock — The cattle are of the kind denominated " short 
horns;" and the sheep are principally of the Leicester breed. 
Great attention has been paid to the improvement of stock. Mr 
Andrew Thompson, tenant in Highridgehall, in this parish, has 
succeeded in rearing a stock of sheep of the purest Leicester breed, 
which, on account of its excellence, has attracted the notice of com- 
petentjjudges from every part of the united kingdom. 

Husbandry. — Either the four or the five shift system of husbandry 
is adopted. The land is thoroughly drained; no part of it is 
irrigated ; but of late there has been a good deal of embankment. 
Leases are for nineteen or twenty years ; and the capital and skill of 
the tenants, the accommodation afforded to them in farm buildings 
and enclosures, and the management of the different properties, 
are all favourable to the agriculture of this parish, which is under- 
stood to be in a highly improved state. 

Improvements.— Within these few years, cottages upon an improved 
plan havejbeen built on two of the farms belonging to Mr Waldie of 
Hendersyde. These cottages do not occupy much ground, but, be- 
sides other conveniences, they contain an upper as well as an under 
flat ; and thus they afford greater facilities than have hitherto been 
enjoyed by the labouring classes, for separating the sick from the 
healthy, and also for assigning separate sleeping apartments to the 
male and female members of families. The universal adoption of 
this improvement would contribute greatly to the health, the clean- 
liness, and the comfort of the rural population ; and might even be 
expected in the course of time to operate with beneficial effect up- 
on their manners and morals, in so far as it would probably lead to 
a greater degree of reserve than at present obtains in the inter- 
course between young persons of different sexes in the humbler 

ranks of life. . 

Produce.— The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 
the parish is, as nearly as can be ascertained, as follows :—

land in pasture, . • • 2520 0 0 

Total yearly value of raw produce raised, L. 1 5,395 0 0 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

The village of Ednam, the only one in the parish, is about two 
miles and a quarter from the post and market-town of Kelso. 
There are two stone bridges and two wooden ones, all in an excel- 
lent state of repair. Besides parish roads, there are three turn- 
pike roads, — one three miles and a half in length, and the other two 
more than two miles each. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church, the only place of wor- 
ship, is conveniently situated, being near the village, and though 
not in the centre of the parish, not more than two miles from any 
house therein. It was built in the year 1800, is in good repair, and 
affords accommodation for about 260 persons. No seat-rents are 
levied. The manse, an excellent house, was built in 1 833-4. The 
glebe consists of five Scotch acres, and is let for L. 13 per annum. 
The stipend is paid in money, and, together with the allowance for 
communion elements, amounts to L. 158, 6s. 8d. ; L. Ill, 2s. 2d. 
being payable from the land, and L. 47, 4s. 6d. received from the 
Exchequer. 

According to the census taken in 1838, the number of families 
belonging to the Established Church was 44, the number of Dis- 
senting families 42, and the number, in which some of the mem- 
bers attended the Established Church, and some went to dissent- 
ing places of worship, 32. Three hundred and forty-five persons 
of all ages were connected with the Establishment, 240 were Dis- 
senters, and there were 6 Episcopalians. There is no reason to 
believe, that since the date of the census referred to, any material 
alteration has taken place in this parish, either in the amount of 
population, or in the relative proportion of persons connected with 
the Establishment, and Dissenters. As has already been stated, 
the inhabitants of this parish, of all denominations, are, with not 
very many exceptions, attentive to the ordinances of religion. The 
average number of communicants in the parish church is about 
160. There are no Societies for religious purposes; the average 
amount of church collections yearly for such purposes is about L.6. 

Education. — The parish school is the only one, and no other 
is required. The branches of education taught in it are, reading 
of English and English grammar, writing, arithmetic, mathematics, 



424 



UOXBURGHSHIHP. . 



geography, Latin, Greek, French, and the principles of the Christ- 
ian religion. The schoolmaster has a house and garden. His 
salary is the maximum ; and the average yearly amount of school 
fees, which are very moderate, is L.36. 

There is no person in the parish between six and fifteen years of 
age who cannot read, and none between nine and fifteen who can- 
not write. There are two persons, one of them a woman of twenty- 
four, and the other a man of sixty, who cannot read ; both of whom 
came lately into the parish from distant parts of the country. The 
benefits of education are fully enjoyed and duly valued. Mr John 
Gibson Smith, the teacher, by conciliating the affection of his nu- 
merous pupils, by adapting his instructions to their opening minds, 
and keeping alive amongst them an intense interest in the business 
of the school, succeeds in imparting to them as much knowledge 
as can be acquired in the time allotted for the education of children 
of the labouring classes. Religious instruction, occupying, as it 
ought to do, a prominent place in his plan of tuition, is conducted 
by him in such a way as to lead the young to an accurate acquaint- 
ance with Scripture history, and to clear views of the system of 
Divine truth contained in the Shorter Catechism, and thus to pre- 
pare them for being intelligent and profitable hearers of the word. 

The writer of this Account has been informed, that the deposits 
in the Kelso Savings' Bank from this parish are from servants and 
from minors, and amount to L. 19, 2s. Id. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The heritors of this parish assess 
themselves and their tenants half-yearly for the maintenance of 
the poor. The average number of persons on the poor's roll is 
21 ; and the rate of allowance is different in different cases, vary- 
ing from L.3, 10s. to L.6, 6s. per annum. Persons in desti- 
tute circumstances, whether paupers or not, occasionally receive 
assistance from the ordinary church collections, the average yearly 
amount of which is rather more than L.7. 

Alehouses. — There are three houses in which ale and spirits are 
sold, a greater number certainly than is either necessary or de- 
sirable. At the same time, these houses are frequented by not 
many of the parishioners, but chiefly by travellers and persons 
from the town of Kelso. 

Pixel. The only kind of fuel in common use is coal, which is 

procured at the rate of 7£d per cwt. from Northumberland.

PRESBYTERY Of JEDBURGH, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TEVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. JAMES STRACHAN, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — Cavers is an appellation common to a number of places 
both in Scotland and England. The term, however, is not found 
in the Saxon language, and is therefore supposed to have been in- 
troduced by a prior people. In the Cambro- British, there are the 
words, Cae and ber, signifying short field or enclosure ; and it is 
not improbable that this is the source from which the name is de- 
rived, notwithstanding that both the extent and openness of the 
parish, as it now exists, would seem to render the appellation most 
inapplicable. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish lies nearly due east and 
west along the south side of the Teviot, and is computed to be 
about 24 miles long, and varying from 8 to 2 miles in breadth. It 
is bounded towards the north-west and north, by the parishes of 
Hawick, Wilton and Minto ; on the east and south-east, by the 
parishes of Bedrule and Hobkirk ; and on the south and west, by 
the parishes of Newcastleton, Ewes, and Westerkirk. 

Its figure, on a general survey, may be regarded as in some de- 
gree resembling a sand-glass, from the circumstance of its being 
narrow at the middle, and expanded towards each extremity ; but 
its outline, when minutely traced, is found to be exceedingly 
irregular, owing to the peculiar manner in which it intersects, 
and is intersected, by other parishes. From the Weensland- 
mill, below Hawick, to the junction of the Allan Water with 
the Teviot, above it, including a distance of about six miles, 
a considerable portion of the parish of Hawick lies on the 
south side of the river ; and this, together with the whole of the 
parish of Kirkton intervening, divides, in some measure, Cavers pa- 
rish into two departments, leaving, however, the upper department 
considerably the. largest. At this particular point, it is only about

two miles broad. The Teviot, with the exception just mention- 
ed, forms its natural boundary to the north. To the east, it meets 
theRule Water, but at the lower extremity, shoots out to a narrow 
point below it, towards Spittal, and thence, embracing almost the 
whole of the northern side of Rubberslaw, the boundary line pro- 
ceeds in a southern direction, but with many irregularities, along the 
high mountainous ridges which separate the Teviotdale from the 
Liddisdale district, towards the top of Tutop, where the shires of 
Roxburgh and Dumfries meet. Taking from thence a north-west 
direction, but with many irregularities, it crosses the pass of Moss- 
paul by the Wisp, and Pikethowe to Teviotstone, the western 
extremity of the parish. 

Topographical Appearances. — If this parish be irregular in its 
outline, it is not less diversified in its general lineaments, possessing 
almost every variety of hill and dale, glen and shaw, soil and pas- 
turage.' Its two principal characteristics, however, may be con- 
sidered as these ; its lower department, though undulating, is yet 
upon the whole flat, and in a state of regular and well-conducted 
cultivation, with hedges and hedge-row trees for enclosures, and 
portions of thriving plantation, suitably interspersed, — while the 
upper department is almost altogether of a pastoral character, 
and in a state of nature, diversified with lonely wild and stream, 
green hill, and deep glen. From Pencrestpen, a little pyrami- 
dical mountain, lying south of Stobbs Castle, where the pastoral 
part of the parish may be said fairly to commence, to Teviotstone, 
where it terminates, a distance of about fourteen miles, — an inte- 
resting family of hills lift up their heads, remarkable for their 
rotund and distinct appearance, and the manner in which they are 
interwoven with one another. These, although not very high hills, 
are nevertheless seen from many points at a very considerable dis- 
tance ; and as thus seen, especially on summer and autumn days, 
when fantastically overhung, as they often are, with all their splen- 
did drapery of towering clouds, obstructing at one time, and emit- 
ting at another, the downward-darting rays of the sun, they exhi- 
bit a prospect which the lover of mountain scenery can scarcely 
fail to admire. These hills in the summer season are covered with 
verdure ; few rocks or stones, and only some plots of heath here 
and there appearing ; or on certain points of high exposure, a 
few acres of broken ground, termed in pastoral phrase " moss-hags," 
lending a darker feature, and heightening the effect by contrast. 
Crawford, in his Cowdenknowes, has apparently, with fond recollec-

tion, well characterized the braes of Teviotdale, when he says, " the 
Teviot braes are green and gay." But Gilpin, in his Tour, thus 
ambitiously describes them, " the downy sides of all these valleys 
of the Teviot are covered with sheep, which often appear to hang 
on immense green walls : so steep is the descent in some parts, that 
the eye from the bottom scarce distinguishes the slope from the 
perpendicular. Several of these mountainous slopes, for some of 
them are very lofty," he adds, " are finely tinted with moss of dif- 
ferent hues, which gives them a very rich surface." It may be 
added, that these hills seem to be a continuation of that irregular 
mountainous track which, from the head of Clydesdale, stretches 
across the country by Tweedshaws, Lochskeen, and Ettrickpen, 
and which separates the rivers and streams of this part of Scot- 
land, sending them to the eastern and western seas. 

The largest and loftiest of these mountains is the Wisp, imme- 
diately above Mosspaul, rising 1830 feet above the level of the 
sea. But it is not so much either its largeness or its height, which 
renders it remarkable, as its position, and the diversified and exten- 
sive prospect which it commands. From its summit, the sea at Ber- 
wick-upon-Tweed is observed to the eastward : to the south and 
west, the Solway Frith, and, if the atmosphere be clear, the Isle 
of Man. Tutop is of equal height with the Wisp, or, according 
to some measurements, 10 feet higher. Pikethowe, Cauldcleugh, 
Gritmoor, and some others in this vicinity, are computed to be 
nearly of the same elevation. But, besides these, there are a few 
hills in this parish which serve to impress upon it a peculiar cha- 
racter. These, from their isolated positions, appear like pyramids 
in the wilderness, conveying the idea, that the district must at 
one time have been visited from the west by some violent in- 
undation, sweeping almost every thing along with it. The little 
conical mountains referred to are the Maiden-paps, Leap-hill, 
Rubberslaw, Pencrest and Skelf-hill-pen. The last of these is the 
most remarkable. On the south side, it rises abruptly out of a 
deep glen ; on the north, it ascends more gradually till, attaining 
to a certain height, it becomes somewhat rocky and rugged, and 
then contracting itself suddenly, it towers yet higher, presenting a 
peak like the spire of some large edifice, " reared by human hands." 
This and Pencrest-pen are memorable for having preserved their 
British names through so many successive generations of different 
people. Rubberslaw, rising to a height of 1419 feet above the 
sea's level, though situated in the lower division of the parish, is 



428 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



in some respects of a more bleak and rugged cast than any of these 
just mentioned. It bears more the appearance of volcanic erup- 
tion than any of the hills in the neighbourhood, or perhaps in this 
part of the island. Its hollow dells and rocky recesses were once 
the haunts of the persecuted Covenanters, and not only the place 
but the very stone on which the volume of God's word was laid 
when the celebrated Peden declared its truths to a large congre- 
gation there assembled, is still pointed out. — Independently of all 
these mountains above-mentioned, another range of hills, in the 
upper division of the parish, runs along the river. And then, con- 
stituting the immediate banks of the Teviot, are the holms or 
haughs, which are for the most part enclosed, and in a state of 
tillage. 

Hydrography. — The Teviot takes its rise, and is the principal 
river, in this parish. The whole of its course is, in length, about 
forty miles, and in that course it receives the Borthwick and the Ale, 
descending from their wild moorlands on the north : and the Allan, 
the Slitrige, the Rule, the Jed, the Oxnam, and the Kail, with 
all their manifold tributaries, on the south. All the streams in 
this parish are tributaries to the Teviot, and which, rising in the 
south, find their way to it in a northern direction. To this, how- 
ever, there are two exceptions, that of Lymycleuch burn, and that 
of the Frostly, which Jlow down their respective glens about five 
miles, in a direction nearly parallel to the Teviot, the former rising 
at the Pikethowe, and the latter in Linhope-grains. The Allan 
Water, the next tributary deserving of particular notice, issues from 
two fountains in the same range of hills which we formerly describ- 
ed, and which send the Hermitage Water south to join the Liddle. 
This stream, after pursuing its course some miles by Skelf-hill and 
Priesthaugh, through one of the loveliest pastoral vales, perhaps, in 
the south of Scotland, turns abruptly from an eastern to a north- 
ern direction, and, after a rough and rapid course, discharges 
itself from overhanging birken bowers into the Teviot at Allan- 
mouth Peel, about a mile above Branxholm. The Slitrige, a stream 
of greater note, also takes its rise in this parish. Issuing from se- 
veral springs in the Leap-hill, Maidenpaps, and Gritmoor, it like- 
wise for some time flows in an eastern direction ; but on leaving 
the stately woods around Stobbs Castle, it turns its course due 
north, and, after a run of ten miles, mingles itself with the Teviot, 
as just mentioned. The Rule, a rapid mountain stream, bounds 

in part this parish on the east. The woods which adorn its banks, 

4 



CAVERS. 



429 



particularly at the mansion-house of Wells, one of the seats of Sir 
W. F. Eliott, of Stobbs and Wells, Bart. are of great variety and 
value. After flowing twelve miles, and, touching upon the lower 
extremity of the parish, it joins the Teviot at Spittal, opposite 
JMin to Craggs. 

Climate, r. — The climate is, upon the whole, cold and moist, es- 
pecially in the upper division of the parish. Of late years, however, 
it has much improved, owing to the great extent of draining which 
has taken place. No distemper, in particular, now prevails. 

No slate, limestone, or coal has ever been found, or is supposed 
to exist in this parish. 

All the streams abound with trout, and are visited annually 
by salmon from the sea. The principal spawning season is about 
Martinmas. There is abundance of almost all kinds of game in 
the parish, but especially of black game. The hill-fox, or, as 
sometimes termed, the grey-hound fox, is a native of the upper 
part of the parish. This species is much larger, more elegantly 
formed, and of a greyer colour, than the more inland or plantation 
fox. The erne or Scottish eagle, in certain seasons, frequents the 
more mountainous districts of the parish. 

There are no plants or fruits which are not found in the parishes 
around, save the foxfoot, the foxglove, the cranberry and cloudberry. 

II. — Civil History. 
' Historical Notices. — The history of the parish, or, more parti- 
cularly, the history of the Kirklands of Cavers, as they are for the 
most part designated in ancient records, is so intimately connected 
with the history of Roxburghshire in general, that they cannot 
well be treated of separately. It appears that Roxburghshire was 
established as a sheriffdom as early as the Scoto- Saxon period: 
and, as the Douglases were mainly instrumental in freeing Teviot- 
dale from the oppression of the English in the reign of Edward 
III., or about the year 1384, that sheriffship, together with the 
property of the lands of Cavers, for a long succession of genera- 
tions, followed the fortunes of this bold and ambitious house. The 
lands of Cavers, with the sheriffwick of Roxburghshire, were grant- 
ed to George Earl of Angus in 1398. On his demise in 1402, 
this office and that property seem to have been invested in Isobel 
Countess of Mar, who transferred them, but without the ne- 
cessary assent and sanction of the King, to the Earl of Douglas, 
then a prisoner in England. By this it was supposed that both 
had become escheat : and King Robert III., desirous of rewarding 



430 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



the eminent and loyal services of Sir David Fleeming of Biggar, 
conferred upon him, in 1405, the lands of Cavers with the sheriff- 
wick of Roxburghshire. He was not long permitted, however, 
either to enjoy these lands or fill this office. As Sir Alexander 
Ramsay of Dalwolsy, a former sheriff' of this shire, and a man equal- 
ly eminent for his bravery and justice, had been seized upon by 
Sir William Douglas, the Knight of Liddesdale, when in the act of 
discharging the duties of his office, carried to his Castle of Her- 
mitage, and there immured in the dungeon till he died of want, so 
Sir David Fleeming was assassinated at Longherdmanston, when 
returning from conducting James, heir to the crown, on board the 
ship which was to carry him to France, by James Douglas, second 
son of Archibald Earl of Douglas, who fell at the battle of Ver- 
nueil. After this the lands of Cavers, together with the heredi- 
tary sheriffship of Roxburghshire, were possessed by the family of 
Douglas till the abolition of the heritable jurisdictions. From an 
imprinted act, of date 11th June 1646, it appears that a parliamen- 
tary ratification of the Kirklands of Cavers passed in favour of 
Douglas, the sheriff of Teviotdale. The town of Cavers was 
taken and laid waste by the English in 1596, and whether it ever 
was rebuilt and replenished does not plainly appear. The old 
baronial castle, which was of very considerable strength and im- 
portance, was situated not far distant from the place where the old 
church of Cavers is still standing. William the first Earl of 
Douglas granted the advowson of the church of Caevers to the 
Monks of Melrose, in whose abbey he was interred in 1384. After 
the Reformation, the patronage of Cavers Church was granted 
to Douglas of Cavers, with whose lineal descendant it still re- 
mains. 

Tradition affirms that the kirk of Cavers originally stood at 
Old- North House, a little village which has now nearly disap- 
peared, in the upper division of the parish, and about ten miles dis- 
tant from the present site of Cavers Church. The report goes 
further, and asserts that the kirk was a thatched one, but no re- 
cords, if such ever existed, have been discovered to throw light 
on the transference, or to confute or confirm that report. Cer- 
tain it is, that there is here an old burial-place, though so much 
decayed as scarcely to be recognizable ; and the writer of this has 
conversed with two old and respectable individuals of the district, 
who could remember two persons being interred in the kirk-yard 

of Old North House. Their graves are still discernible by the

careful observer, together with a number of what may have been 
whin head-stones kything around, but whose tops are now level with 
the green sward above. Sheepfolds now occupy the place where 
the church is said to have stood. . 

Land-owners. — The principal land-owners are, His Grace the 
Duke of Buccleuch ; Sir William F. Eliott of Stobbs and Wells, 
Bart. ; andJames Douglas, Esq. of Cavers, the patron of the parish. 

Eminent Men. — Of eminent characters connected with the pa- 
rish, George Augustus Eliott, Lord Heathfield, may be mention- 
ed first. He was the ninth son of Sir Gilbert Eliott of Stobbs and 
Wells, Bart., the lineal descendant of the far-famed " Gibbie an' 
the Gouden Garters," who, under peculiar circumstances, mar- 
ried Mary Scott, a flower of Yarrow, and received along with her 
as dowery, in faithful fulfilment of her father's promise, " the half 
o' a Michelmas moon." Lord Heathfield was born at the pater-r 
nal estate of Stobbs in 1718. He discovered, in early youth, a 
predeliction for a military life, and entered upon his brilliant ca- 
reer as an officer in the 23d Regiment of Foot or Royal Welsh 
Fusileers. He rose step by step to a high status in the army 
and in his country's estimation. Serving in Germany, he was 
wounded at the battles of Dettingen and Fontenoy. Having been 
appointed to the 15th Regiment of Light Dragoons in March 1759, 
he headed, in the August following, the second line of horse, un- 
der the Marquis of Granby, at the battle of Minden. After hav- 
ing been constituted a Lieutenant- General, he was called from 
Germany for the purpose of assisting as second in command at 
the reduction of the Havannah. In 1774, he was appointed Com- 
mander-in-chief in Ireland, but feeling on his arrival dissatisfied 
with the appointment, he requested to be recalled, which request 
was complied with ; and on the demise of Lord Corn wal lis, he was 
made Governor of Gibraltar, which place he defended during the 
siege in the years 1779-80-81 and 82, with such skill and bra- 
very as merited the highest praise. In acknowledgement of the 
services done to his country here and elsewhere, a pension of L.2000 
a year was awarded to him in 1783, when he was created a Knight 
of the Bath. In 1787, he was raised to the dignity of a Peer of 
Great Britain, but, dying in 1790, he did not long enjoy these 
honours, so nobly won and worthily conferred. 

• This means what he could plunder from his enemies on the English Border dur. 
ing the period implied. Her father was Adam Scott of Kirkhope, in the parish of 
Yarrow.

ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



Dr John Leyden, so eminently distinguished by the poetical ge- 
nius which he displayed, and the classical knowledge which he ac- 
quired in so short a life, was born at the village of Denholm, in 
this parish, in September 1775, of parents humble in their rank 
and circumstances of life, but eminent for their moral worth and 
intelligence. He entered the University of Edinburgh in 1 790, 
and in due course was licensed to preach the gospel as probation- 
er in the Church of Scotland. Ambitious, however, of still high- 
er attainments in literature and science than he had yet achieved, 
he shortly after this entered upon the study of medicine, with a 
view of going abroad, chiefly in order that he might procure op- 
portunities of enhancing his acquirements in the oriental languages, 
and thereby gratifying the passion which reigned supreme in his 
heart. Through the patronage of the Right Honourable Wil- 
liam Dundas, he was appointed assistant-surgeon in the hospital 
of Madras, but in which situation he did not long continue. After 
holding the situation of assistant-surgeon in the Mysore Survey, 
and a professorship in the College of Bengal, he eventually, under 
the patronage of Lord Minto, the then Governor-general of India 
was promoted to the office of Judge of the twenty-four Purgun- 
nahs of Calcutta. He accompanied the Governor- General on 
the expedition to Java, made for the purpose of investigating the 
manners, language, and literature of the tribes of that island, and 
for which Leyden's extensive knowledge of the eastern dialects and 
customs, eminently qualified him. There he was seized with 
fever, and this extraordinary man, in whom were combined such 
virtues, learning and genius, and withal such athletic powers and 
activity, as are never, or very rarely to be met with in one indivi- 
dual, after three days illness, died on the eve of the battle which 
gave Java to the British Empire. 

John Armstrong of Gilknockie, the famous border freebooter, 
along with a number of his companions, was, by order of King 
James V., executed at Caerlanrig, and interred there, in or near 
by the chapel burial-ground. 

 This individual, by harassing and plundering his neighbours on the English bor- 
ders, appears, in carrying forward his predatory adventures, to have acted principally 
upon the mistaken notion of his being his country's eminent benefactor; and his 
kindred and Scottish neighbours seem to have encouraged this notion to the utmost 
in esteeming him highly as such : King James, however, having sworn that he 
would "mak the thresh-buss keep the cow," thought very differently, and all the 
marauder's entreaties and proffered presents which latter were neither few nor or small 
value, could not avail in inducing the Prince to preserve his life. A number ot Ins 
companions were carried to Edinburgh as hostages for insuring the better behaviour 
of their friends left behind on the border ; but nothing at this time could chain down

Parochial Begisters. — These have hitherto been very imperfect- 
ly kept, and are consequently very defective. 

Antiquities. — The principal antiquity of this parish is the Cat- 
rail, or Picts work ditch, meaning literally in the language of its 
constructors, the partition of defence. It passes through the 
centre of the parish in a south-east direction, for the space of 
about seven miles. Entering it at the farm of Northhouse-haugh, 
it proceeds to Doecleugh, where it appears particularly dis- 
tinct. Leaving two hill-forts or British strengths on the left — 
the one on Skelf-hill farm, and usually called Doecleugh Castle, — 
the other on the farm of Priest-haugh, and uniformly called the 
Brugh hill, — it enters the Dod, and ascends the Carriage hill, where 
it again becomes peculiarly prominent. From this height it de- 
scends and crosses the Langside-burn, where it constitutes the 
known boundaries of several estates. Traversing thence the north- 
em base of the Maiden-paps to the Leapsteal, it holds its onward 
course into Liddisdale through the pass of the dividing hills near 
Robertslin. 

There are likewise, besides these just mentioned, a number of 
camps in the parish, some of which are called Roman, and others 
of them Saxon camps. An old castle or border tower stood at a 
place called Castleweary, in the upper division of the parish, scarce- 
ly any vestige of which is now remaining. Allan-mouth-peel, an- 
other feudal fortress, situated at the junction of the Allan with 
the Teviot, appears from the portion of it yet remaining, together 
with the wall and fosse with which it has evidently been surround- 
ed, to have been a place of considerable importance in feudal 
times. Its last occupier, it is said, was a brother of Sir Walter 
Scott of Buccleuch, the then warden of the Scottish border. At 
Caerlanrig, about forty years ago, a number of urns, said to be Ro- 
man, were dug up. There is here also one of these camps. At 
Priest-haugh a great number of gold coins were found some con- 
siderable time ago, supposed to have been there deposited by the 
attendants of Queen Mary, when she visited Bothwell at Hermi- 
tage Castle, in Liddisdale. In ancient times Cavers, like seve- 
ral other parishes in Teviotdale, had an hospital for the poor, 

Ihc border spirit, or induce its inhabitants to alter their freebooting habits, and these 
hostages were shortly afterwards executed at Edinburgh ; which circumstance seems 
to have given rise to the impression and report that obtains with not a few, that 
Jonnic Armstrong himself was put down at Edinburgh, and not at Caerlanrig, which, 
however, is not the fact — See Buchanan's History.

wounded, and old. It was situated at a place called Spittal, at 
the lower extremity of the parish. 

III. — Population. 

The population of the parish now amounts to 1625. 
In 1801, it was 1382 
1811, 1402

Number of families in the parish, - - 

chiefly employed in agriculture, - 153 

trade, manufactures, or handicraft, 103 

The total number of proprietors in the parish is 7, all of 
whom possess land of L. 50 a-year in value and upwards. Only 
one of them is resident. . 

Character of the People. — In the character of the people there 
exists considerable diversity, according to the localities which they 
inhabit, and the employments which they follow. In general they 
are sober, industrious, and intelligent. As the farms, for the most 
part, aie extensive, and the farmers wealthy, there is considerable 
disproportion of rank; but the farm-servants and shepherds are 
kept comfortable, and these seem, especially in the landward part 
of the parish, contented with their condition and circumstances. 
Their habits are cleanly, and their food wholesome. About six or 
seven years ago, poaching, not by the inhabitants of the parish, 
but by poachers from a distance, prevailed to a very great extent ; 
but vigorous measures having been adopted to prevent the inroads of 
those lawless bands of immoral and misguided men, who infested 
the whole country around, poaching has become a thing very rare 
ly practised. 

IV. — Industry. 
Live-Stock. — The upper division of the parish is particularly well 
adapted for pastoral purposes. The sheep are all white-faced, and 
regular stocks are kept. Great pains have long been taken to obtain 
and preserve the true Cheviot breed, since if this breed becomes 
corrupted, its tendency to degenerate is fully more than that of any 
other. Through attention and superior skill, some farms in the 
parish are stocked with sheep, which are almost purely Cheviot. 
The total number of sheep pastured in the parish is about 1 1,500. 
The cattle are for the greater part of the Teeswater breed, and 
great attention has likewise been paid to rearing and improving 
them. 

Rent. — The grazing of a cow or full-grown ox, L. 5; that of a 
ewe or full-grown sheep, 6s. Valued rental of the parish, L. 1 8,877, 
16s. 8d. Scots; real rental, L. 13,000 Sterling. 



CAVERS.

Wages. — The rate of labour per day, for men, during summer, 
Is. 4d., and for women, lOd. including victuals; and during win- 
ter, for men, Is., and for women, 6d. The wages of artisans vary 
from 2s. to 3s. per day. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market- Toion.— Hawick, in the adjoining parish of that name, 
is the nearest market-town, distant about a mile from the nearest 
point of the parish, and from Cavers church about three miles. 
The only village is Denholm, situated near the lower extremity of 
the parish. It contains a population of about 500 souls. The 
principal means of subsistence is. stocking-weaving, given out by the 
stocking-manufacturers of Hawick. The wages, of course, are re- 
gulated by the extent and quality of the workmanship. A skilful 
and industrious person may win, on an average, throughout the 
year, 15s. per week. 

Means of Communication. — These, for the greater part, are suit- 
able and good — the turnpike roads being pretty numerous, and in 
general in a very sufficient state of repair. The main road be- 
tween Edinburgh and Carlisle, entering at Tein-side bridge, runs 
through the upper part of the parish, a distance of about seven 
miles, on which are four mails in the day to and from Edinburgh. 
Besides these, there are also two other coaches which run the same 
way in the same time. A turnpike of the same quality as the 
main one, branching off at Hawick, runs through the lower division 
to Jedburgh, Kelso, &amp;c. Another, up the Slitrige, communicates 
with the English border counties, by Note-o'-the-Gate, Carter-fell, 
&amp;c. ; while the county roads, leading in various directions, are too 
numerous to be here noticed. A penny post-office is established 
at Denholm, and another at Caerlanrig Chapel. There are many 
bridges in the parish, some of which are constructed of stone, and 
others of wood, the latter being chiefly for the conveniency of 
foot-passengers ; and the fences, whether consisting of hedges, dry 
stone dike, or of stone and lime, are in general pretty well kept. 

Ecclesiastical State. — As one church could not possibly accom- 
modate the whole parish, the present one was built with a view to 
the accommodation of the lower division of it ; and for this it is 
pretty well placed. It was erected in 1822, and contains seats for 
500. The building is very substantial, as well as somewhat ele- 
gant, and is at present in an excellent state of repair. The number 
of communicants is about 300. 

The manse was built in 1813, and is also in good repair. 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



Caerlanrig Chapel. — This chapel is situated in the upper part 
of the parish, and is intended for the accommodation not only of 
the inhabitants of that district of Cavers, but also of those in the 
upper part of the parish of Hawick. The bounds pertaining to 
it are about ten miles long, and, on an average, nine broad. The 
chapel is centrically situated. It is said to be of 200 years standing 
and upwards, as a Protestant place of worship, and has been thrice 
built on different sites. It seems to have superseded the Roman Ca- 
tholic chapel, which stood here in the burial-ground, and which 
is still preserved and occupied as such : or else it was found neces- 
sary for the accommodation of the inhabitants of the district when 
the kirk at Old-Northhouse was removed, or done away. At first, 
and until a chaplain was appointed to the charge, the minister of 
Cavers was under the inconvenient necessity of performing pub- 
lic duty at Caerlanrig chapel, one Sunday every month. It is not 
distinctly known when a chaplain was first appointed, and this prac- 
tice discontinued. The present chapel was erected by the contri- 
butions of the inhabitants of the district, about forty years ago, 
the ground, the wood, slate, and lime being given by his Grace 
the Duke of Buccleuch. It is at present in good repair, but 
found to be too small. The seats are all free, unless in so far 
as they are appointed to, and appropriated by, heads of families. 
As no endowment has been procured, and no regular stipend as- 
signed, the chaplain is not ordained, and the chapel consequently 
is not constituted as a Chapel of Ease. In so wild and extensive 
a district, this occasions very great inconveniency, both to the 
preacher and the people, as well as to the ministers of the two pa- 
rishes respectively to which the chapel belongs. The number of souls 
dependent upon this chapel for religious instruction is 700, 216 of 
whom reside in the parish of Hawick, and the rest, of course, in 
the parish of Cavers. Others, also, from the outskirts of the neigh- 
bouring parishes, frequently attend, as being nearer to the chapel 
than to their own churches. 

The annual allowance to the chapel minister is, on an average, 
L. 52 — L. 25 of which is given by way of bounty by his Grace the 
Duke of Buccleuch ; L. 5 by James Douglas, Esq. of Cavers ; 
and L. 3 by the minister of Hawick. The rest is contributed by 
the farmers, and other inhabitants of the district, each giving as 
he thinks proper, or finds convenient. 

As no manse or dwelling-house had hitherto been annexed to 
the chapel, the Duke of Buccleuch, about two years ago, appoint- 



CAVEKS. 



437 



ed one to be erected at his sole expense : this he keeps in repair, 
allowing-, at the same time, some other valuable perquisites. 

The poor of the district being regularly supported by their re- 
spective parishes of Hawick and Cavers, the collections made in 
the chapel are applied to the keeping of it, together with the side- 
parochial school, in repair, and the procuring of other requisites, 
such as communion elements, &amp;c. unless when, in cases of emer- 
gency, some portion is appropriated to charitable purposes. 

Both at the church and chapel, Divine service is generally well 
attended. 

Dissenting Chapel. — There is a Dissenting house or chapel at 
Denholm, understood to be supported by James Douglas, Esq. of 
Cavers. It belongs to the denomination of Independents. There 
is also a considerable number of other Dissenters, who, for the 
most part, adhere to one or other of the various Dissenting con- 
gregations in Hawick. 

Education. — The total number of schools in the parish is 3, all 
of which are parochial,— one situated in Denholm, — another near 
Stobbs on the Slitrige, — and another at Teviothead or Caerlan- 
rig Chapel. The two latter are termed siefe-parochial schools. The 
branches usually taught are, English, English grammar, writ- 
ing, arithmetic, book-keeping, geography, mensuration of super- 
ficies, solids, heights, and distances, algebra, &amp;c. 

„, , . Cavers. Slitrige- Cavers. Teviothead or Caerlanrig. 

The present salaries are, L. 30 L. 12 L. 15 13 U 

School-fees drawn, - 25 19 19 0 0 

The school-fees are payable by the quarter of thirteen weeks, 
and are, for English, 2s. ; for English and writing, 2s. 6d. ; for 
English, writing, and arithmetic, 3s. ; and for higher branches, 5s. 
The teachers have the legal accommodations. Through the ge- 
nerosity of his Grace the Duke of Buccleuch, and his &amp; Chamber- 
lain for this district, William Ogilvie, Esq. of Chesters, the side 
parochial schoolmaster at Caerlanrig has, of late, received ground 
not only for a garden but for the keep of a cow. There is no per- 
son betwixt six and fifteen years of age, nor upwards of fifteen, in 
the parish, who cannot read or write, although from many, the 
schools are distant and inaccessible. 

Libraries.— There are four libraries in the parish. The Sub- 
scription Library at Denholm was instituted in 1805, and contains 
at present 880 volumes. The Woodside Library is the property 
of Mr Douglas of Cavers solely, to which any person can have 
access gratuitously. It was instituted in 1825, for the use of the 



438 



ROXBURGHSHIRE 



young people attending Denholm Sabbath school, and contains 
about 1000 volumes. 

The Caerlanrig Chapel or Teviothead Library was instituted a 
considerable number of years ago, and consists of a pretty large col- 
lection of well selected books. The Juvenile Library at the same 
place is, as the name implies, principally intended for the benefit 
of the young, but free to all.f 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The poor are provided for by as- 
sessment conducted in the usual manner ; the annual average 
amount of which, for the last ten years, is L. 273. The average 
number of persons receiving parochial aid, as regular paupers, dur- 
ing the same period is 53, and the average sum allotted to each is 
L. 5, 3s. per annum. The assessment for the current half-year is 
L.132, and there being 49 paupers on the roll, the average sum al- 
lotted each is 2s. Od. per week. 

The money raised by means of the weekly collections made at 
the church, amounting to about L.9 a-year, is left to the sole ma- 
nagement of the kirk-session, and is distributed in small sums 
among such poor of the parish as require only a temporary relief. 

As the system of giving parochial aid, above described, has ob- 
tained for many years, the certainty which it gives of relief being 
afforded, generally induces a readiness to take advantage of it on 
the part of the necessitous.  

Saving Banks. — The nearest of these is at Hawick; and there 
is another at Jedburgh : both are in a flourishing condition. The 
one at Hawick was instituted January 7, 1815. At the 30th May 
last, the number of depositors was 473, from all classes of the com- 
munity, but especially those for whose benefit such institutions are 
chiefly intended. 

 This library is not confined to this parish. About ten years ago, Mr Douglas 
adopted the scheme of Mr Samuel Brown of Haddington, in regard to " Itinerat- 
ing Libraries," which was to send fifty volumes to a convenient station, where they 
should remain, in order to be read by the inhabitants of the place, for a twelvemonth, 
and then be returned, when another box, containing fifty other volumes, should be 
forwarded, and so on. _ . . 

+ As this library is altogether free, a quarterly lecture is about to be instituted, 
the collections arising from which are to be applied partly to the repairing of the old 
books, and partly to the purchasing of new ones. 

i The following shows the state of this Bank, as ascertained by official documents 
submitted to the last general meeting of managers, on the 1st of August 1839.

Inns. — In Denholm, there are 4 or 5 inns: in the landward 
part of the parish, 3. These latter, being more especially for the 
accommodation of travellers, are regarded as an advantage ; and, 
in general, it is not understood that any of these houses have had 
any demoralizing effect. 

Fuel. — Peat is a good deal used for fuel in the upper depart- 
ment of the parish. In the more inland parts, the principal fuel 
is coal. It is brought far, and from various quarters — Mid- Lo- 
thian, Berwickshire, and other places: it is therefore very expen- 
sive. Of late, however, since the Duke of Buccleuch took his coal- 
mines in Cannoby into his own hand, great quantities of coal have 
been brought thence into this parish : and there is a prospect 
from this source of immense benefit to many. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Very considerable improvements have taken place in this parish 
since the last Statistical Account was written, both with respect to 
the farming of land, and the management of stock, as well, indeed, 
as in many other matters. With regard to agriculture, as much 
has been done, or is doing, especially on the estate of Cavers, as 
seems advisable in a district where the climate is precarious, and 
coal and lime are wanting. 

Store-farming has been improved. Summer hirseling is given 
up, and ewe-milking done away. The flocks, being left to wan- 
der wide and more at will than formerly, acquire more strength 
and condition for enabling them to brave the hardships of winter. 
More stells, and on more eligible situations, have been erected for 
shelter, and greater quantities of hay, in case of severe and pro- 
tracted storms, are generally provided. 

The parishioners are more comfortably accommodated than 
formerly in their houses. Greater attention is paid to clothing and 
cleanliness: and the daily food is in several respects more whole- 
some. 

In the upland division of the parish, there is much land lying 
untouched that might be tilled : but considering the precarious- 
ness of the climate, it is very questionable whether the land in 
its natural state, and as it is presently stocked, is not more profit- 
able to the possessor than it ever otherwise could be. The greatest 
deficiency is the want of plantations.

PRESBYTERY OF LANGHOLM, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES. 

THE REV. ANGUS BARTON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Jame. The origin of the modern, as well as of the aneient 

name of this parish, is abundantly plain. Upon the summit of a 
precipice, about 100 feet perpendicular, on the east bank of the 
river Liddal, and immediately above the church, there was a strong 
fort or castle, the rampart and fosse of which remain entire : near 
to these, in the place where the present road was formed, and in 
several other parts in the immediate neighbourhood, many hearth- 
stones were dug up, where a town or village had formerly stood. 
Hence the name of Castle-town. But the ancient name of this dis- 
trict, and indeed that by which it is still most frequently denomi- 
nated, was Liddisdale, from the river Liddal, which runs through 
it in a direction from east to south. In the ancient histories, and 
geographical accounts of Scotland, it is called the county of Lid- 
disdale, and in old writs it is designed the Lordship of that name. 

Erection, Form, and Extent.— This parish formerly belonged to 
the Presbytery of Jedburgh ; but when the five churches of Esk- 
dale were erected into the Presbytery of Langholm, it was added 
to them in the year 1743. This was done on account of its great 
distance from the former seat of the presbytery. Its form ap- 
proaches nearly to that of a triangle, whose base runs from east 
to west, along the head of Teviotdale, and whose opposite vertex 
points to Solway Frith. It contains, according to the map of the 
county, about 52,160 Scotch acres. It is the largest parish in the 
south of Scotland, being upwards of 18 miles in length, and about 
12 in breadth. 

Topographical Appearances.— The general appearance of the 
upper part of the parish is mountainous ; the lower part is hilly ; 
and a great part of it, at a distance from the banks of the rivers, 

 The greater part of this article, the Topography, Antiquities, &amp;c. taken from 
the Old Account,— the remainder from different sources. 



CASTLETOWN. 441 

is bleak and wild to a high degree. But its appearance along the banks 
of the rivers is altogether different. These are generally covered with 
natural woods, or young plantations in a very thriving state. Thebar- 
ren wilds are entirely hid from the view ; the windings of the river, 
and the fine holm-land on every side, present the most picturesque 
scenes, or exhibit rich prospects to the eye. The inhabited part 
of the parish consists of two valleys. That along the Hermitage 
is about ten miles in length, from the source of the river to the 
point where it loses its name in the Liddal. At the head of this 
river the country is entirely mountainous. The mountains are very 
high and steep, but are generally dry, and afford excellent sheep 
pasture. The greatest part of this stream is fringed with natural 
wood ; it possesses much rural beauty, and exhibits the pastoral 
scenes of life in great perfection. The other valley, or strath, is 
that along the sides of the Liddal. Near the head of the parish 
on the east, the rivers Liddal and Tyne, which run by Newcastle, 
take their rise, in the midst of an immense bog, surrounded by 
mountains. The Tyne winds slowly to the east, between the bleak 
mountains and the dreary wastes of Northumberland, by Keelder 
Castle. The Liddal runs due west for a few miles, and then runs 
due south. This- part of the country is mountainous, high, and 
cold, until it commences to run south, after which it presents ex- 
cellent pasture. On the east and west sides, the thriving planta- 
tions of the Duke of Buccleuch, and below these, those of Mr 
Scott Elliot of Lariston, and Mr W. O. Rutherford of Dinla- 
byre, and on the east, the plantations and woods of Mr Elliot of 
Whitehaugh, a little below the confluence of the rivers, form a 
landscape highly beautiful. Here the valley widens considerably, 
and improvements are everywhere seen. 

Mountains.— The principal mountains are, Tudhope, Millen- 
wood-fell, Windhead, Greatmoor, Dun, Dod, Hermitage, Peel 
fell, Roan-fell, Lariston-fell, Carby-Hill, and Tinnis hills. The 
last-mentioned is seen as a land-mark at a great distance out at 
sea. Tudhope is said to be 1830 feet above the level of the sea 
and Millenwood-fell and Windhead are nearly 2000 feet 

Rivers and Fish.-Thz rivers are the Liddal, the Hermitage, 
the Tweeden, the Kershope, which divides the two kingdoms, 
the Tinnis and the Blackburn ; with several other streams of in- 
ferior note. All of them are plentifully stored with trouts, and 
afford excellent sport to the angler. 

Climate and Longevity.— The climate is very damp, from the 

ROXBURGH, j. f

ROXBURGHSHIRE.. 



high land attracting the vapours of the Atlantic, and from the re- 
tentive nature of the soil. But the district is very healthy. Within 
these few years, instances nave occurred of persons reaching very 
nearly the patriarchial age of one hundred. 

Minerals. — There is great abundance of limestone in the pa- 
rish, of different qualities. It is wrought to a great extent in the 
estates of Lariston and Thorlieshope. Coal is wrought to a dimi- 
nished extent on the estate of Liddlebank. Freestone quarries of 
excellent stone are everywhere found, excepting a£ the head of the 
Hermitage, where there is nothing but blue whinstone. 

Medicinal Springs. — There are several springs in this parish, 
strongly impregnated with sulphur. There is one at the head of 
it, at Thorlieshope, in that part called the Dead Water, unfortu- 
nately situated in the middle of that vast morass where the Lid- 
dal and the Tyne take their rise. In wet seasons it is weaken- 
ed by the surrounding water. It is much frequented by persons 
afflicted with cutaneous and scrofulous complaints, who receive great 
benefit from it. They drink the water, and use it as a warm bath. 
A very strong mineral spring is found at Lawstown ; and there it 
one at Flat, inferior in strength to that at Thorlieshope, but of the 
same quality. There are several springs of this kind. One is 
found on the Tweed en, exceedingly powerful, and containing a 
great quantity of water, where large masses of petrified matter ap- 
pear on every side converted into solid stone. The progress of the 
petrifaction is distinct and beautiful. The fog or moss, which grows 
on the edge of the spring, and is sprinkled with the water, is about 
eight inches high ; the lower part is converted into solid stone ; 
the middle appears as if half frozen, and the top is green and 
flourishing. The petrified matter, when burnt, is resolved into 
very fine lime. The spring itself, when led over the fields in little 
rills, fertilizes them exceedingly. 

There are several beautiful waterfalls on the river Tweeden, 
the little streams of Dinlabyre, Harden, and Sundhope. But on 
the river Blackburn, such scenes are in all their beauty and va- 
riety. Sometimes the river shoots over a perpendicular rock, in 
one unbroken sheet of water, forming a beautiful cascade ; at other 
times it is darted over tremendous precipices, and rages furiously 
among the huge masses of the rock below. In this wild and ro- 
mantic vale, nature appears in various forms, now beautiful, then 
awful, sometimes sublime, and frequently terrible. lhe au- 
thor of this account measured the principal falls. One is 27

feet perpendicular in height, another 31; the breadth of the 
rock over which it falls, 36 ; a third is 37 in height, and 20 
feet wide. 

Woods. — The natural woods consist of oak, ash, birch, and 
alder. Considerable plantations have been made of Scots fir, 
spruce, larch, oak, ash, beech and plane. They are all in a thriv- 
ing condition. 

II. — Civil History. 

Eminent Men. — This parish gave birth to the celebrated Dr 
Armstrong, author of the Art of Preserving Health, whose father 
and brother were ministers of it. 

Antiquities. — There are several monuments of great antiquity 
in the parish, but their origin and their history are involved in much 
obscurity. Even tradition itself says little concerning them. 
Though this parish comprehended a great part of the middle march 
between the two kingdoms, yet, excepting a few detached facts, 
there is nothing of consequence preserved or related by his- 
torians. 

Castles. — Hermitage Castle stands upon the bank of the river 
of that name. It has been a very strong building, nearly 100 feet 
square, defended by a strong rampart and ditch. The walls are 
entire, and it has lately been put into nearly a complete state of 
repair. Within a few yards of the castle are the remains of the 
ancient chapel of Hermitage, now in ruins, in the middle of the 
burying-ground still in use. The font is in the wall of the church- 
yard. The castle of Clintwood, on the farm of Flight, appears to 
have been a very strong building. It has now been entirely razed. 
The castle, from which the parish derives its name, in former times, 
must have been impregnable on the west and north. On the north 
it was defended by a very deep ravine ; on the west, by the Lid- 
dal, and a precipice of more than 100 feet in height ; and on the 
east and south by two ramparts of great strength, and a fosse of 
great depth. 

Camps. — The principal camp is on the top of Carby Hill. This 
hill is detached from all others, and commands a view of the whole 
country, and of all that part of Cumberland, by Bew Castle, &amp;c. 
The camp is entirely circular, and occupies the whole summit of 
the hill ; it is fortified by a very strong wall of stones, and a road 
plainly appears to have been made up to it, winding round a part 
of the hill, and entering it on the south. It is about 100 feet dia- 



444 



ROXBURGHSHIRE 



meter. In the centre a small space is inclosed with a strong wall, 
and round it are eight circles of different sizes, all surrounded by 
a stone wall, and all of them having had a door or opening to the 
east. On the summit of the Side-hill, and nearly opposite to 
Carby, on the north side of the Liddal, there is another strong 
encampment, nearly of a square form. It is 300 feet in diameter. 
The wall or rampart is entirely of earth, and about 18 feet high. 
This camp has none of the interior circles of the former. On the 
farm of Flight, and near to the castle of Clintwood, there are 
two camps at a little distance from each other ; the one round, 
■ and fortified with a stone wall about 100 feet diameter ; and 
the other square, about 168 feet in length, with two ramparts of 
earth. 

Picts Works. — There are a great many round-abouts in the pa- 
rish, commonly called Picts Works. They are all circular, and 
strongly fortified by a wall, composed of large stones. They are 
frequently found, the one at a little distance from, and opposite to, 
the other. There are two nigh Heeds-house, two on the farm of 
Shaws, one on Toftholm, one on Foulshiels, one on Cocklaw, one 
on Blackburn, and one on Sorbytrees. On the farm of Mill- 
burn there is a small circle enclosed by nine stones, which seems 
to have been a Druidical temple. Tradition says Lord Soules was 
burnt there. The hill is called Nine- Stone Ridge. 

Cairns,' c. There are many cairns in different places. The most 

remarkable of these is on the farm of Whisgills. The quantity of. 
stones is immense, and they are mostly of a very large size. Near 
these, there is a large stone set on end, about 5 feet high, called 
the standing-stone. This cairn is in the middle of an extensive 
and deep moss. It can be approached on horseback only on one 
side, and that with much difficulty. There is not a stone to be 
seen near it. At Milnholm there is a cross of one stone, 8 feet four 
inches high, set in a base 1 foot 8 inches. ' This is a piece of great 
antiquity. A sword 4 feet long is cut out on the south side of the 
cross, and immediately above several letters.

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — The rents of the parish arise chiefly from sheep, 
black-cattle and horses, and from tillage. 

Some farmers bring a considerable number of black-cattle from 
the markets of Falkirk and Doune. They are supported during 
the winter by the foggageand coarse hay, and sold generally towards 
the end of summer. Those tried in the country are principally the 
Ayrshire and Dutch kind. The butter which is made, even on the 
coarsest pasture, is not excelled by any in Britain. It is common- 
ly observed, that the coarser the pasture is, the butter is the better 
and the richer. Even the mossy ground, though in appearance 
barren, is of great use both for black-cattle and sheep. The plant, 
called the moss, rises before any other in the spring, affords ex- 
cellent nourishment, and is carefully sought after by the flocks. In 
these coarse lands, there is a constant and regular succession of 
different species of grass, which rise in their respective seasons 
throughout the year. 

Soil, Produce, and Cidtivation — The arable land at present in 
tillage lies chiefly on the banks of the rivers. Many hundred 
acres, formerly in tillage, have been thrown into pasture on account 
of the high prices of sheep and wool. The soil of the holm land 
is excellent. It is sometimes of a light, but most frequently of a 
very deep and fine loam, and, where it is properly cultivated, it pro- 
duces exceeding good crops. Wheat has been sown, and turned 
out very well. The ordinary crops are barley, pease, oats, and 
potatoes. Turnips have been introduced to a great extent, and 
succeed very well. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
There is a weekly market at Castletown, which has been in ex- 
istence for the last two years. 

Fairs.— There are 2 fairs at Castletown annually for the sale 
of sheep. 

The Eskdale and Liddesdale Farmers' Association, under the 
patronage of His Grace the Duke of Buccleuch, meet alternately 
at Castletown and Langholm, when prizes are awarded to the far- 
mers producing the best stock. 

Church, fyc— The church was built in 1808. It is in excellent 
condition, and may accommodate a congregation of 700 or 800. 
It is situated at the junction of the Liddal and Hermitage, in a 
centrical situation, and conveniently for the population, as far, at 
least, as one church can be so, in so extensive a parish. The 



440 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



manse was put in complete repair, on the entrance of the present 
incumbent in 1 822, and the offices and garden are in admirable 
condition. At least one-half of the glebe is arable, and the other 
half pasture and meadow. It is from 20 to 25 acres in extent. 
The stipend is 17 chalders. 

Education. — There are 4 parochial schools in the parish, one 
principal and three auxiliary. The instruction given at the paro- 
chial schools is in the usual branches. The salaries of the four 
masters amount to L. 51, 6s. 6d. of which the principal teacher has 
L. 30, and the remaining sum of L. 21, 6s. 6d. is divided equally 
among the three auxiliary teachers. The fees of the four schools 
amount to L. 72 a year. here are no other emoluments. 

There are also 2 non-parochial schools, at which English gram- 
mar, writing, and arithmetic are taught. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of permanent poor 
on the roll is 61 ; of poor occasionally relieved, 30 ; number of 
children educated out of funds for the poor, 41, and the expense 
of their education is L. 29, 12s. 9d. Assessments began to be im- 
posed in the year 1773, and the average yearly amount for the 
three years preceding 1837 was L. 381, 13s. 4d. The average 
amount of church-door collections for the same period was L. 21, 
12s. 3d. The highest rate of relief is L. 7 per annum. The 
lowest, L. 1. 

Libraries. — In the village of Castletown is one public subscrip- 
tion library. 

Boads. — Good carriage roads run through the parish, commu- 
nicating with Jedburgh, Hawick, Langholm, and Carlisle. Two 
new roads have lately been constructed, one to Bew Castle, the 
other to Northumberland. No public carriage runs on any road 
in the parish. 

Fuel The fuel used is peat, of, which there is an inexhausti- 
ble fund in every part of the country, and coal, which is brought 
principally from Northumberland. But the lower part of the 
parish is chiefly supplied from the collieries in Canonby, belonging 
to His Grace the Duke of Buccleuch. 

Villages. — The village of Castletown was commenced in 1 793, 
and now contains upwards of 1000 inhabitants. The houses and 
gardens are held on lease of ninety-nine years, from the Duke ; 
but the land attached to them, and the right of common are un- 
derstood to be held on lease of nine years. The village consists of 
two principal streets running parallel to each other, and bearing

the names of the two rivers Liddal and Hermitage. Hermitage

third in November.

PRESBYTERY OF KELSO, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TEVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. WALTER MORISON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name.— The origin of the name, Morebattle, is not certainly 
known. In the most ancient records it is written Merbotle and Mere- 
both, and the most probable supposition is, that it is a compound of 
the Saxon words, Mer or Mere, a marsh or loch, and Botl, a hamlet 
or village, thus signifying the village on the lock or marsh. This de- 
rivation is not supported by present appearances, but there is reason 
to believe that it was sufficiently appropriate at an earlier period. 
The vale of the Kale, on an eminence on the south side of which 
the village of Morebattle stands, for an extent of upwards of two 
miles in length, and nearly one in breadth, exhibits obvious indica- 
tions of having been at one time under water, and of having formed 
a loch or marsh which has been drained by the waters of the Kale, 
which flowed through it, gradually deepening their outlet through 
the barrier of rising grounds at its lower end. Another conjecture 
concerning the origin of the name is that it signifies the village on 
the moor. It is found sometimes written Muirbatle and Moorbattle. 
But this spelling never occurs in any of the earlier writings. Nor 
is such a derivation peculiarly applicable either to the present or 
former locality, at least not more so than to the majority perhaps of 
the villages of Scotland. Besides, it is liable to the objection of 
making the name partly Scottish and partly Saxon. Of the name 
of the other parish, Mow, which lies on the upper part of Beau- 
mont water, and is the highest portion of the united parish, an- 
ciently written, Mol and Moll, the only derivation which has been 
proposed, is from the British Moel, which signifies bare, bold, also 



448 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



a naked hill, a conical hill, &amp;c. a derivation not inconsistent with 
the character of the district. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The greatest length is in the direc- 
tion of nearly north and south, and is about 9,} miles. The 
greatest breadth is from east to west, and is about 6 miles. The 
mean breadth may be about 4 miles. It is bounded on the north, 
by the parishes of Yetholm and Linton ; on the east, by part of 
the parish of Yetholm, and by Northumberland ; on the west, by 
Hownam, Eckford, and Linton ; and on the south, by Northumber- 
land and Hownam. 

Topographical Appearances. — The parish extends to the summit 
of the Cheviot range, and, with the exception of a small portion of 
the north and west sides, consists almost entirely of hills and the in- 
tervening vallies. It presents not, however, that bleak and barren 
aspect which generally characterizes a mountainous district. The 
hills are verdant and beautiful, the low grounds are under culture, 
as also the sides of several of the hills to a considerable height, 
and some of them to their very summits. The principal vales are 
those of the Kale and Beaumont, neither of them of very great 
breadth, but extending in length, the former about four, and the 
latter about six miles. The principal hills are the Cheviot, part 
of which is in this parish ; the Curr is next to it in locality and also 
in height ;— the Schell,' Whitelaw, Percy hill, Woodside hill, and 
Clifton hill, abeautiful hill risingfrom the east side of the Beaumont 
in the form of a dome. Between the Beaumont and the Kale, Swin- 
don hill, Belford hill, and the Grubit hills ; and on the west of the 
Kale, Gateshaw hill and Morebattle hill. They vary in height 
from 500 feet to upwards of 2000. From the Cheviot hills the 
view is grand and extensive, and in the summer season attracts 
frequent parties of visitors from both sides of the border. The 
surrounding counties of Northumberland, Berwick, and Rox- 
burgh, lie extended below as on a map. On the east, the view 
is lost in the German Ocean, and on the south and west it is 
confined by the midland mountainous tract, which stretches 
from Westmoreland to the sources of the Clyde and the Tweed. 
The prospect from the Grubit hills, though more limited, is un- 
commonly fine;— looking down on the beautiful vales of the 
Kale and the Beaumont lying at their base, and containing within 
their limits the pleasant villages of Yetholm and Morebattle, the 
Primside and Linton lochs, the romantic church of Linton, the 
wooded villas of Marlfield and Clifton Park, the ruins of Cessford 



M0RE1UTTLE AND MOW .

Castle, famed in Border story, the Tower of Corbet House, also 
connected with the border feuds, and many cheerful farm-houses, 
with their adjacent cottages ; it embraces in the further distance 
on the one side, the loftier range of the Cheviot, and on the other, 
the fertile districts of Merse and Teviotdale, studded with gentle- 
men's seats, the rich vale of the Teviot, the wooded course of the 
Tweed, the picturesque Eildons, with their triple summit, Hume 
Castle, Smailholm's rocky tower, the Waterloo monument on Pi- 
nelheugh, with numerous other attractive and interesting objects ; 
and in the back ground is terminated by the distant hills of Lammer- 
muir alid Selkirkshire. There is a great scarcity of wood in the 
parish, which would very much improve the scenery and also the 
climate. A sufficient extent of ground might be laid out in plan- 
tations without materially encroaching on land otherwise valuable, 
and what might be taken up for this purpose would be more than 
compensated by the increased value of the remainder. Many 
patches are everywhere to be found, at present, nearly waste, which 
might thus be rendered both ornamental and profitable. Some of 
the proprietors have, within the last thirty years, turned their at- 
tention to improvements of this kind, but not generally, nor to any 
thing like the extent that is required. 

Climate, Diseases, and Soil. — The climate is dry and healthy. 
In the lower part of the parish it. is mild and temperate, but in the 
higher districts the winters are severe and stormy. The spring is 
liable to be interrupted by cold chilly winds, from the neighbour- 
ing Cheviots proving injurious to the fruit blossoms and the more 
delicate vegetation. Fruit is here, therefore, an uncertain crop, 
and not much cultivated. In spring and autumn, fogs and hoar 
frosts from Linton loch on the east, and a marshy ground on the 
north-west, often sit down on the valley or basin of the Kale, and 
frequently injure the crops, especially of potatoes and wheat, in 
the valley, and also to a certain height sometimes very distinctly 
marked, on the adjacent rising grounds. Harvest commonly 
commences towards the middle of August. The inhabitants, in ge- 
neral, enjoy good health. There is no disease to which they are 
particularly liable. Agues have entirely disappeared. Epidemics 
are uncommon. Typhus fever seldom appears, and when it has 
occasionally been imported has never spread to any great extent. 
Only five or six cases of small-pox have occurred within these last 
twenty years. Scarlet fever is perhaps the most fatal disease which 
now visits the district. Cholera never entered the parish. When 



460 



ROXBURGHSHIRE. 



prevalent in the country, every precautionary measure was adopted 
for keeping it out. The soil is in general light, and such as is 
well adapted to the turnip husbandry. 

Hydrography. — The only lochs are, Primside or Yetholm Loch, 
partly in this parish, and partly in Yetholm ; and Linton Loch, 
partly in this parish and partly in Linton.  The principal ri- 
vulets are the two beautiful streams of the Kale and the Beau- 
mont. Both of them rise in the Cheviot range. The Kale runs 
from south to north, until it nearly reaches the village of More- 
battle, where it suddenly turns to the west, and after a further 
course of several miles, joins the Teviot about five miles above its 
junction with the Tweed at Kelso. The Beaumont, continuing 
its northerly direction, enters Northumberland, where it falls into 
the Till, another tributary of the Tweed. Their pure crystal 
waters flowing over fine pebbled beds, in continually recurring cur- 
rents and pools, and between fine grassy banks, abound in excel- 
lent trout, and are well adapted for angling. In the end of autumn 
the salmon from the Teviot and Tweed ascend the Kale for the 
purpose of spawning, when they are killed in great numbers dur- 
ing the evenings and nights by torch light. Frequent attempts 
have been made to put a stop to this illegal practice, but hitherto 
with little success. No salmon enter the Beaumont, being pre- 
vented by a dam near to its mouth. A similar dam has lately 
been erected across the Kale, near to the Teviot, for the purposes 
of machinery, which will probably have the effect of also prevent- 
ing, or at least, of greatly obstructing the passage of the fish, and 
of diminishing their numbers. 

II. — Civil History. 

Land-owners. — The number of heritors is 11, and in the order 
of the value of their properties they are, the Duke of Roxburgh, 
patron of the parish, and proprietor of the greater part of the 
lands on Beaumont water ; the Marquis of Tweeddale, to whom 
the barony of Morebattle belongs ; Sir George Warrender of 
Whitton ; Mr Pringle of Clifton ; Mr Ker of Gateshaw, the 
only resident heritor, and in the superior attention to ornamental 
improvement on whose estate the advantages of residence are to 
be seen ; Sir John Scott Douglas of Belford ; the Society for 
Propagating Christian Knowledge ; Mr Oliver of Lochside ; Mr 
Wilson of Otterburn ; Mr Turnbull of Heavyside ; and Mr Dar- 
ling of Temple Hall. 

 For which see the Statistical Accounts of Yetholm and Linton. 



MOREBATTLE AND MOW. 



451 



Antiquities. — Amongst the hills are to be seen some of these 
circular rows of stones, called Trysting Stones, the origin and de- 
sign of which are uncertain. On some of the heights there are 
traces of ancient encampments, most probably British, the most 
distinct of which are on the two adjacent summits of Morebattle 
Hill. Following apparently the figure of the heights, the larger is 
of an oval, and the smaller of a circular form. Of various towers 
or forts, often mentioned in the ancient border records, only two 
now remain, those of Whitton and Corbet House. The former is 
on the estate of Sir George Warrender, and is nearly in ruins. 
It was battered down by the Earl of Surrey in an inroad into Scot- 
land in the reign of Henry VIII. Corbet House tower belongs 
to Mr Ker of Gateshaw. Between twenty and thirty years ago, 
it was repaired and renewed by the late Sir Charles Ker. In 1522, 
it was burnt by the English, who then ravaged the banks of the 
Kale and Beaumont in retaliation of a plundering expedition of 
the Scots into Northumberland, of which Launcelot Ker of Gate- 
shaw had been one of the leaders. 

Eminent Men. — No names of peculiar eminence occur. But 
under this head we may mention that Grubit, formerly the estate 
of Sir William Bennet, and from which he took his title, is si- 
tuated in this parish, and adjoining to it is Wideopen, the occa- 
sional residence of his friend, the author of the Seasons, and at 
that time the property of the poet's maternal uncle. Of Thom- 
son's residence here, several traditionary anecdotes are still pre- 
served in the neighbourhood. See the Statistical Account of 
the adjoining parish of Eckford. 

Parochial Registers. — The session records commence in 1726. 
There is a gap from 1738 to 1771, and again from 1777 to 1803, 
from which date they have been regularly kept. The register of 
births and baptisms commences also in 1726. In it, too, a blank 
occurs, from 1739 to 1760. After this, it continues, without far- 
ther interruption, to the present time. No registers are kept of 
marriages, and deaths, or funerals. A small sum is paid to the 
session funds by parties giving in their names for the publication 
of bans. The entries of these sums in the session accounts is a 
sort of register of proclamations, the entries of the mortcloth dues 
form a similar register of funerals. 

III. — Population. 
In 1755, the population was 789. In the last Statistical Ac- 
count, it is stated as nearly the same. By the last census of 



452 



uoxnuRQHsniiu:. 



1831, it was 1050. After the commencement of the modern 
improvements in agriculture, it rapidly advanced. For the last 
twenty years it has been nearly stationary. The population 
is entirely employed in agriculture, or in trades dependent 
upon it. 

Number of families in the parish in 1831, ... 210 

chiefly employed in agriculture, - - 112 

in trade, manufactures, or handicraft, 31 

Character, Habits, 8fc. of the People. — They are in general sober 
and industrious, of simple manners, and of moral and religious 
habits. Many of them have a taste for reading, and are well in- 
formed and intelligent. There are three public-houses in the pa- 
rish, all in the village of Morebattle, and ale and spirits are also 
sold at a toll-house in the neighbourhood. This is perhaps a 
greater number than the public accommodation requires. Smug- 
gling by carrying spirits across the border into England at one 
time prevailed to a great extent, but it has now, for several years 
past, happily been entirely suppressed. There is neither lawyer 
nor medical practitioner in the parish. The heritors are sub- 
scribers to the Kelso Dispensary, where the poor receive advice 
and medicines gratis, and in cases where they cannot be taken to 
Kelso, a surgeon from the institution, when requested, visits them 
at their own houses. The farm-houses are, very different from 
what they formerly were, large, commodious, and elegant. But 
there is still great room for improvement in the houses of the 
hinds and cottagers. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The higher part of the parish is mostly in pas- 
ture. The lower is. under tillage, and the soil being that which 
is suited to the turnip husbandry, the system of farming is the 
mixed, partly corn, and partly stock. The grains chiefly raised 
are barley and oats ; wheat, too, but not to a great extent; beans or 
pease seldom. . The prevailing rotation is what is called the five- 
shift, in which case the land lies two years in grass, and sometimes 
the four-shift, when it lies only one. The chief manures employ- 
ed are the dung produced on the farm, — lime, which is brought from 
a distance of seventeen miles, at the rate of about 10s. the one 
horse cart, — and of late years, with much success, bone dust. The 
great proportion of the turnips are eaten on the ground with sheep, 
and when the crop is good, this is a sufficient manuring for the re- 
maining years of the rotation. Without this in a district where 
there is no command of dung, tillage could not be carried to near- 



MORE BATTLE AND MOW. 



453 



ly the extent that it is. In the higher district, the sheep are of the 
Cheviot hreed ; in the lower the Leicester, and in some places a 
cross between the two. The cattle are almost all of the short- 
horned or Teesdale breed. 

Rents. — The rents, of course, are very various. The average 
of the arable lands may be from L.1 to L. 1, 5s. per acre, and of 
the pasture lands from 8s. to 10s. The valued rent of the parish 
is L. 16,081, 14s. 8d. Scotch. The real rent between L. 11,000 
and L.1 2,000 Sterling. 

Rate of Wages. — Day labourers, men, Is. 6d. and 2s. ; women, 
lOd. and Is. ; carpenters, 2s. 6d. ; and masons, 3s. ; tailors, Is. 6d. 
with meat ; shearers, men, 13s. ; women, 12s. a week and their meat. 
The yearly wages of hinds, or, as they are called, the conditions 
of hinds, are the following, 10 bolls or 100 stones of oatmeal; 
15 bushels barley; 6 bushels pease ; 1200 yards of potatoes 
planted ; a peck of lint sown, in lieu of which L. 1 is now generally 
allowed ; L. 3 under the name of sheep siller ; a cow's grass, 
or in lieu of it, L. 5, 10s. or L. 6 ; the privilege of keeping 
hens, or, instead of them, 10s. or 12s. ; and the carriage of four 
two-horse carts of coals. It is customary to give them their meat 
during one month in harvest. They commonly keep a pig, which 
they feed at their own expense. Their wives shear for their 
houses and yards. The hinds are bound to keep a servant woman 
called a bondager, at least during the summer half-year, for work- 
ing on the farm at day's wages, commonly lOd. They gene- 
rally complain of this as a hardship, alleging that what they 
receive for their servant's work will not do more than pay 
their half-year's wages, and that they have to give them victuals 
for nothing. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Villages and Markets. — There were formerly several consider- 
able villages, of which scarcely any vestiges remain. Morebattle 
is now the only village in the parish, containing about 300 inhabi- 
tants. The ground on which it is built is held of the Marquis of 
Tweeddale, the superior, on leases of nineteen times nineteen years- 
In the former Statistical Account, the houses are stated to have 
been then " mostly of one storey, and covered with thatch." A 
great proportion of them are now of two stories, and covered with 
slates. The appearance of the village is greatly injured by the 
slovenly custom of laying down ashes, fire-wood, and rubbish of 
different kinds, in front of the houses, along the sides of the street.

Were this nuisance done away, as has been frequently proposed, 
the striking improvement in comfort and cleanliness would soon re- 
concile the villagers to any restrictions to which it might subject 
them. There was a small common near the village, on which the 
rentallers, by the terms of their leases, had the right of casting 
turfs. About forty years ago, this was divided amongst them, with 
the consentof the Marquis of Tweeddale, in shares, proportioned to 
the amount of their rentals. It has since been all inclosed, gra- 
dually improved by manuring, trenching, forcing, &amp;c. and now 
bears very good crops of potatoes, turnips, grass, and also of corn, 
and thus, from being a waste and useless moor, is now a consider- 
able benefit to the village. 

Means of Communication. — No stage-coach runs through the 
parish. There are carriers to Kelso the market-town three days 
a-week. A turnpike road passes through the village, communicat- 
ing with the Kelso and Jedburgh road on the west, and leading into 
Northumberland on the east. The parish roads are kept in good 
repair. Some years ago it was proposed to establish a side post in 
Morebattle, but the villagers on being consulted refused it as dis- 
advantageous. They stated that their correspondence being chiefly 
with Kelso, their letters are either carried free of expense by people 
going down, or at least for Id. by the carriers, whereas by post 
they would cost 3d. or 4d. There are no fairs or markets held in 
the parish. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is situated at the north-west 
extremity of the parish, being within half a- mile of the boundary on 
that side, and between nine and ten from that on the other There 
is no other part of the parish, however, in which it could be placed 
more commodiously for the bulk of the population. It stands at 
the north side of the village of Morebattle, on a height overlook- 
ing the Kale. It affords accommodation for about 460 sitters, and 
if well filled, would contain 500. It was built in 1757, and is at 
present undergoing repairs, which, when completed, will render it 
comfortable and handsome. No seats are let. St Lawrence was 
the patron saint. A well below the churchyard, which supplies the 
village with water, still bears his name, corrupted into Lawrie's 
Well. At one period there had been a chapel at Clifton, then a 
village, and another at Whitton. The collections at the church 
doors are very trifling. The number of heads of families commu- 
nicants on the veto roll, made up at the last communion, is 50. 
The manse was built in 1830. The accommodation is large, but

the work being very ill executed, it has already required consider- 
able repairs. The stipend, as modified at the last augmentation, in 
1820, is 16 chalders, half barley, half oatmeal, with L. 8, 6s. 8d. 
for fcommunion elements. The glebe consists of about 11 acres 
of very good land. The minister had also a right to a number 
of carriages of coals from the tenants, the greater part of which 
have fallen into disuse. He had also the right of casting turfs on 
the farm of Morebattle Braes. But the ground being brought 
under tillage, he agreed to take in lieu of this privilege the carriage 
of 14 bolls of coals yearly, which, however, for a long time past, he 
has never received. There is one Dissenting-meeting house in the 
parish, which belongs to the United Secession. It stood originally at 
Gateshaw, which was the first settlement of the Secession in the 
south of Scotland. Their first minister, Mr Hunter, was ordained 
in 1739. It was some years before a place of worship was built, 
during which time the congregation assembled summer and winter 
on Gateshaw Brae, and the minister preached to them from a tent. 
About sixty years ago, the meeting-house and manse were removed 
to Morebattle, where they still continue. The minister has a good 
house and garden, a yearly stipend, I believe, of L. 1 10, and an al- 
lowance for sacramental expenses. 

Education. — There are two parochial schools — the first in 
Morebattle, attended on an average by 100 scholars. The school- 
master has the maximum salary, L. 8 as heritors 1 clerk, and a 
trifle as session-clerk. The amount of his fees may be about 
L. 30. A new school-house has lately been built, without excep- 
tion, the finest in the county: The schoolmaster's house is of 
two storeys, containing four rooms, kitchen, and back kitchen, be- 
sides garret apartments. The second-school is at Mowhaugh, on 
Beaumont Water. It was established about fifteen years ago. 
The teacher has a house and garden, and L. 17 of salary, with 
the school fees. The branches taught at both schools are, En- 
glish grammar, writing, arithmetic, geography, mathematics, La- 
tin. There is also in the village of Morebattle a private school, 
attended by about 30 scholars. There are no persons above 
fifteen years of age who cannot read, and few, if any, who cannot 
write. 

Literature. — A library was established in the parish about forty 
years ago, which now contains between 600 and 700 volumes. 
The price of a share is L. 1, Is. and the yearly contribution is

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of paupers at pre- 
sent on the roll is 45. The sum annually expended for their 
support is about L. 280. It is derived from assessments on the 
heritors, and the interest of L. 1500 bequeathed to the parish by 
a Mr More, a native of the place, who went out to India, where 
he died. The terms of the destination are, " for the sup- 
port, maintenance, and education of real poor and destitute 
orphans." The heritors throw it into the general poor's fund. 
They aliment, of course, the poor orphans, and also pay their 
school fees.

trict labours is the distance from coals, about seventeen and 
eighteen miles, which are almost the only fuel used, or which 
can be procured.

Extent, Sfc— The parish of Stitchell lies in the county of Rox- 
burgh,— that of Hume in Berwickshire. The united parishes are 
betwixt 5 and 6 miles in length from north to south, and betwixt 
3 and 4 in breadth from east to west. The boundaries on the 
north are the parishes of Gordon and Greenlaw ; on the south, 
the parishes of Kelso, Nenthorn, and Ed nam ; on the east, 
Eccles ; on the west, Nenthorn and Earlston.

Mansions. — The chief mansion in the parish is that of Stitchell 
House, belonging to Sir John Pringle. 

Antiquities, Sfc. — The Castle of Hume, which stands in the pa- 
rish, was for ages a noted defence to its neighbourhood, during the 
contentions and wars on the borders. The Earls of Home resid- 
ed in it. Our southern neighbours often besieged it. It was 
surrendered to the Duke of Somerset in the year 1547, and re- 
taken in the year 1549. It is said that Oliver Cromwell, when 
at Haddington, sent a summons to the Governor, ordering him to 
surrender the castle ; but that the then Governor returned for an- 
swer, that « He Willie Wastle, stood firm in his castle, and that 
all the dogs of his town should not drive Willie Wastle down." 
Oliver Cromwell, however, after considerable difficulties, made 
himself master of it, and in a great measure demolished it. There 
is a tradition generally believed in the country, that when King 
James II. went to besiege the Castle of Roxburgh, he left his 
Queen in Hume Castle ; that one day when she was upon the 
road to visit her royal husband, she was met about half a mile 
east of Stitchell House, by a messenger, with the melancholy ac- 
count of his Majesty's being killed by the bursting of a cannon. 
This sad news brought on her pains, and she was immediately de- 
livered of a child, upon a hill, ever since called Queen's Cairn.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 
ON THE COUNTY OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q664892">ROXBURGH</name>.</head> 
<p>


This County, one of the most interesting and beautiful in Scot- 
land, presenting a great diversity of scenery, is bounded on the 
south by Dumfries-shire and the counties of Cumberland and 
Northumberland ; on the east, by Northumberland and Berwick- 
shire; on the north, by Berwickshire; and on the west, by the 
shires of Edinburgh, Selkirk, and Dumfries. Its extreme length 
from north to south may be about 40 miles, and its extreme 
breadth from east to west somewhat less. It marches with Eng- 
land along a space of not less than about 50 miles. 

" A river here, there an ideal line, 
Divides the sister kingdoms." 

Usually, the ridge of the mountain barrier, which separates the 
two countries, is the bounding-line ; sometimes it is a mountain 
stream, at others " a dry stone dike." From its position with re- 
gard to England, this county was the scene, in former times, 
of many a fierce and bloody 'Struggle between the inhabitants on 
either side of the border; and the whole county we find to have 
been at one time studded with an almost incredible number of 
castles, and peels, and towers, and other fortified edifices, — the 
crumbling remains of which are now fast disappearing before the 
plough and other modern agricultural improvements ; though we 
cannot but regret the too frequent practice, not now so common, 
we believe, as it was, of pulling down these rude relics of a former 
and very different state of things, and using them in the erection of 
stone fences and farm-buildings. Roman camps, also, and Bri- 
tish forts, are numerous throughout the county, — evidences, per- 
haps, of its ancient importance; and the great middle Roman road 
into North Britain, usually denominated Watling Street, crosses the 
county, in nearly a north and south direction, and in some places, 
as in the wilder and less cultivated districts of Hounam and Ox- 
natrj, is still distinctly visible.

 Drawn up by the Rev. John Baird, Yetholm. 



460 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 

Tweeddale is scarcely understood, we believe, to include any por- 
tion of Roxburghshire, yet that portion of the county watered by 
the lordly Tweed may be regarded as possessing certain features 
distinguishing it from the rest of Teviotdale, the principal division 
of the county. It contains no extensive tracts of uncultivated pas- 
ture lands, no ranges of hills, — the classical and singularly beau- 
tiful Eildon hills being almost the only exception. Though undu- 
lating in its outline, and rising often to a considerable elevation, 
yet, compared with the rest of the county, it may be described as 
almost a level district, and almost the whole of it has been brought 
under the dominion of the plough. Especially in the neighbour- 
hood of the river, it is richly wooded. The immediate banks of 
the Tweed are generally precipitous, on one side at least, some- 
times on both,— so that the river, flowing in a deep bed, is frequent- 
ly invisible from the public roads, and many of its most striking 
beauties are known, therefore, only £o those who are familiar with 
the district. Everywhere, however, from the higher grounds the 
views of the river and of a richly wooded and highly cultivated 
country, are exceedingly fine. The tributaries of the Tweed within 
the county, are the Gala, on the borders between Roxburghshire 
and Selkirkshire, the Allan in the parish of Melrose, the Leader 
separating this county from Berwickshire, the Teviot and the Eden, 
—the former, the graceful and romantic Teviot, where, mingling 
with the princely Tweed, almost doubling the volume of his waters. 

The Teviot, whence the name Teviotdale given to the middle 
division, if not to the whole of the county, with the exception of 
Liddesdale, though only a tributary of the Tweed, is the peculiar 
river of the county, which it nearly divides, and few districts in the 
kingdom can boast a river of greater beauty. Its whole course, 
which is about 40 miles, and all within the county, is beautiful ; 
but we might instance, in- particular, the district from Crailing to 
Hawick, whether seen from the one side of the river or the other; 
and the views are still more magnificent, when contemplated from 
some of the higher grounds which rise from the banks of the river. 
Many beautiful seats ornament its banks. The river, almost every- 
where seen from the road, flows in the bottom of a spacious, open, 
sunny valley, the sides of which, gradually receding from the river, 
rise often to a considerable height; Minto Crags and Minto Kame 
on the one side, and the Dunian and Ruberslaw on the other, 
being hills of from 700 to 1400 feet in altitude. The fields are 
in a high state of cultivation, and the whole country is finely cloth-

eel with wood. Above Hawick, the valley in which the Teviot 
flows gradually contracts, — the hills generally attain a greater ele- 
vation, — its banks possess less cultivation, and it speedily assumes 
the character of a pleasing, pastoral district. The several tribu- 
taries of the Teviot, the Ale, and the Borthwick waters, on the 
north side of the river ; the Kale, the Oxnam, the Jed, the Rule, 
the Slitridge, and the Allan waters on the south side, — all flow 
through valleys of great natural beauty, often much contracted in 
breadth, and presenting fine specimens of bold rocky scenery. 
They often rival in beauty the vale of the Teviot itself, though 
they possess a very different character of beauty. 

The whole of what may properly be denominated TeViotdale, 
the district watered by the Teviot and its tributaries, may be de- 
scribed as hilly, and by far the greater part of it pastoral. On 
the banks of the Teviot and other streams, and wherever the 
ground is not too steep for the plough, the land is in cultivation 
and often well wooded. All the intermediate country between 
these intersecting valleys is a wilderness of beautiful green and ge- 
nerally rounded hills : 

" The pastures of the wilderness ; 
The little hills rejoice on every side. 
The pastures are clothed with flocks ; 
The valleys also are covered over with corn ; 
They shout for joy, they also sing." 

The district all along the borders beween the two kingdoms is 
perhaps the most mountainous portion of the county. The hills, 
however, are generally smooth, green, and pastoral, with many a 
pretty glen and sparkling stream between, — though it must be con- 
fessed, that, in some places, as in the neighbourhood of the Car- 
ter, moors as cold, bleak, wet, and barren exist, as almost any other 
part of Scotland can produce. 

Liddesdale, or the parish of Castleton, the southern division, 
including about a sixth part of the county, is separated from Te- 
viotdale by a range of lofty hills, and the only entrances to it from 
the latter are by roads almost as alpine as can be travelled in the 
Highlands itself. It is essentially a pastoral district; the only cul- 
tivation being on the banks of the Liddel and Hermitage waters, 
which intersect it from nearly north to south. There is generally 
a great deficiency of wood. The two vales of the Liddel and Her- 
mitage, in which almost the whole population reside, are bounded 
by hills of moderate height, green in summer, brown and moorish- 
looking in autumn. Towards the sources of the streams, the coun- 



402 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 

try is wild and hilly ; but as you descend to the village of Castle- 
ton, especially from the confluence of the Hermitage with the 
Liddel, it is extremely pretty, with well grown plantations and cul- 
tivated fields. The climate of Liddesdale is wet, though said to 
be milder in winter and spring than that of the rest of the county. 
The soil is complained of as weak, not able to bring the crops to 
perfection, and the wetness of the climate in summer and autumn 
greatly retards the ripening and in-gathering of the grain. These 
are alleged as reasons for less cultivation prevailing in this than iu 
many similar districts of the county, though in this, there are at 
the same time great apparent facilities for improvement, — abundance 
of lime on almost every farm, with coals at no immoderate distance, 
an uninterrupted descent for draining operations, a moderate rent, 
we presume, — andthe Duke of Buccleuch, one of the best landlords 
in the kingdom, is the Lord of Liddesdale. 

The only stream, of any importance, in the county, which 
has not been already noticed, is the Bowmont water, which has 
its source in the Cheviot range, and which, after a course of ten 
miles through a diversified and beautiful, but rather naked val- 
ley within the county, enters England, and after uniting with the 
College and the Till, finally loses its waters in those of the Tweed. 

Agriculture. — It appears that not more than about one-third of 
the whole county is in tillage, the remaining two-thirds being in 
permanent hill-pasture and moor, though of this last there is com- 
paratively little, with a small, yet not disproportionate part, under 
wood. Everywhere, soil and climate being at all favourable, and 
these are daily ameliorating by the growth of young plantations, 
fresh land, and land which has not been in tillage for many years, 
is brought into cultivation, and in all such cases thoroughly im- 
proved ; and every year is adding more or less to the quantity of 
land in tillage in such situations, so that there is now as great a 
breadth of land under cultivation, and in a far superior condition, 
as there was during any period of last war. The number of acres 
under the plough at present, compared with what there was about 
the end of last century, it would be important and interesting to 
know, but correct information is wanting. In some even of the 
finer districts of the county, there is now fully one-third, in others, 
one-half more land under cultivation, than there was at the former 
period referred to ; and over the whole county, it may be stated, 
we believe, without any exaggeration, that there is now fully a 
third more land under the plough, than there was little more than 



ON THE COUNTY OF ROXBURGH.

forty years ago. " Towards the close of last century," says an 
intelligent observer, well acquainted with the agriculture of Scot- 
land, " some of the finest arable portions of the county were alto- - 
gether unenclosed, and, excepting the better descriptions of land 
upon the immediate vicinity of its rivers, exhibited the dominion 
of the plough only in irregular and detached patches, — the inter- 
mediate portions being very generally devoted to grazing." He 
mentions, with regard to what he describes as the finest district of 
the county, the parishes in the immediate vicinity of Kelso, in- 
cluding an extent of 42,000 acres,— that in 1790, there might be of 
these 21,000 acres under cultivation, whereas in 1837 there were 
nearly 35,000 ; that the value of the produce of the former might 
be L. 84,600, of the latter, L. 172,400 ; and he calculates the pro- 
duce of each acre as one-fourth more. If we include the produce 
of farms, in stock as well as in corn, the productiveness of the land 
has been increased in a much larger proportion. For it is a re- 
markable fact, thatin a farm, we will suppose of 1800 acres, which, 
towards the close of last century, was devoted almost entirely to 
sheep pasture, there may be now from 500 to 600 acres in regular 
rotation of corn crops, while the number of sheep kept upon the 
farm has been in no degree diminished, and these are kept and 
fed in a far superior manner. The number of sheep at the close 
of last century compared with that at the present time, in the finest 
district of the county, the same gentleman whom I have quoted 
above, calculates as about three to four, and the weight in the pre- 
sent time cannot be taken, he thinks, at much -less than double that 
of the former period. The great improvements in agriculture 
during the last forty or fifty years, and the immensely increased 
productiveness of the soil, have been owing principally to the intro- 
duction of the drill turnip husbandry, now universally adopted in 
the county, " the judicious intermixture of the feeding and graz- 
ing of live stock with arable culture," the use of foreign manures, 
as lime and bone dust, and an improved system of draining. The 
rental of land in the county has uniformly kept pace with, if it has 
not been generally in advance of, its increased value. The rents 
of farms, since the end of last century, have been increased in most 
instances about a half, in not a few much more than a half, and in

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 



none, perhaps, less than a third. Lauds, also, sold of late years, 
have brought double, treble, and even four times the sum paid for 
them, forty or fifty years ago. 

The farmers in this county are generally men of capital and in- 
telligence. Tillage farms may average from 400 to 600 acres ; 
sheep or pastoral farms from 1000 to 3000; and farms partly 
arable and partly in permanent sheep pasture, of which descrip- 
tion there is a large proportion in the county, from 600 to 1400 
acres ; though there are many farms, of course, of smaller as well 
as of much larger extent. The leases are generally for nineteen 
or twenty-one years, and the rents vary, of course, according to 
soil, climate, situation, and facilities of markets. Probably more 
than one-half of the arable land of the county is upwards of 250 
feet above the level of the sea, and from that to 600 and even 800 
feet. Much of the land in elevated situations, especially in our 
trap districts, is of the best quality, but the climate is cold and ex- 
posed. How much more land of this description, than is at present 
in tillage, and of moss and moorland in low districts, might be 
brought into cultivation, with profit and advantage to the farmer, 
a few more years may determine : though it must at the same 
time be admitted, that, in some situations, lands of the description 
now mentioned, after having been in cultivation, have been again 
restored to pasture, their continued culture being found not remu- 
nerating, the climate being bad, or more probably, the expenses 
attending a thorough system of improvement being too formidable 
to be incurred under unfavourable circumstances. On the larger 
farms, the fields or enclosures contain generally from twenty to 
forty acres, and these, in the older cultivated districts, are usually 
fenced with thorn hedges interspersed with trees, which give an ap- 
pearance of clothing and richness to the landscape, while the newer 
enclosures are more generally fenced with dry stone dikes, i. e. 
walls of from four to five feet in height, built without mortar. The 
soils in different districts, of course, vary very much, and these 
may be noticed more particularly when we speak of the geology of 
the county. 

The same spirit of improvement which has, of late years, per- 
vaded more or less the whole country, has extended also to this 
district, and Roxburghshire can boast of not a few enterprising 
and intelligent farmers. It is yet to be regretted, however, that 
few comparatively have hitherto practised to any extent the more 
recent improvements or discoveries, such as the system of frequent

or furrow draining-, subsoil and trench-ploughing, which a few 
years experience, we have little doubt, will pronounce to be indis- 
pensable for the right management of land. These improvements, 
however, are extending, and equal attention has also, of late years, 
been shown to improving the breed of cattle and sheep. 

Farming is now practised more as a science than formerly ; and 
it were certainly desirable that our young men, destined to be far- 
mers on a large scale, should receive a suitable education for such 
profession. An acquaintance with the various branches of na- 
tural history, geology, botany, and with natural philosophy and 
chemistry especially, ought to be regarded as essential for the suc- 
cessful prosecution of agriculture in the present day, and an in- 
creasing conviction begins to prevail of the great utility of such 
knowledge. 

Among the recent improvements connected with the agricul- 
ture of the county, we are glad to notice, and we wish we could 
do so in terms of stronger approbation, that of late years in all 
new erections of farm-builings, somewhat more attention has been 
shown to the comforts of that quiet and industrious class of men, 
the hinds or farm-servants, who in this county, different in this 
respect from many others, are generally married men with fami- 
lies, residing in separate dwelling-houses, collected together as a 
little hamlet, situated at a short distance from the farm-house and 
offices, as the other farm-buildings are generally called. The 
houses of these men, formerly often wretched hovels, in many in- 
stances worse than those appropriated to the cattle, are now in many 
new erections made larger, warmer, and are provided occasionally 
with sleeping apartments above. The other agricultural labourers, 
residing generally in towns and villages, are most frequently em- 
ployed by the piece, or according to the measurement of work done, 
and their gains, whether they are employed by the day or the 
piece, have been of late on the advance, being now from 10s. 6d. 
to 12s. per week. 

It is no unfrequent subject of regret and complaint, that proprie- 
tors in general are so careless and short-sighted in giving encourage- 
ment to tenants desirous to improve their farms, though tenants them- 
selves, we have no doubt, may frequently be equally to blame in this. 
Improvements executed solely at the expense of the tenantare gene- 
rally made to last only a limited period, and are consequently not 
permanent. They benefit the land for the time, and remunerate the 
fanner, but at the end of the lease, the farm is in a condition lit—

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 



tie, if at all, superior to what it was in, at the commencement, and 
the improvements must be in a great measure renewed. A 
thorough and permanent improvement of land can only be made 
at a very considerable cost; and it would be unreasonable to ex- 
pect that a tenant, who has only a temporary interest in the lands 
he occupies, should attempt improvements which are ultimately so 
much more beneficial to the landlord than himself; for at the ex- 
piry of his lease, such farm will let at a greatly increased rent, and 
another may reap the benefit of his improvements. But in few 
cases, have tenants capital adequate to such an undertaking. Were 
proprietor, on the other hand, to execute such improvements them- 
selves, or join with their tenants in the execution of them, binding 
them even in their leases to make such improvements as would 
be for the permanent benefit of the land, they would greatly in- 
crease the value, and it may be even the security of their proper- 
ties ; and there is no wise tenant but would be willing to pay 
L. 6 or L.7 per cent, during his lease for all money thus expend- 
ed by proprietors ; while, at the termination of the leases of such 
improved farms, they would bring greatly increased rents; and in 
the present day, when agricultural pursuits are so much in fashion, 
and so many competitors start for every farm that is in the market, 
proprietors can be at no loss in the selection of suitable tenants, 
men of capital, education, and enterprize. If farms were general- 
ly improved, as we have seen some farms improved, there can be no 
doubt, that a large proportion, probably two-thirds of the whole til- 
lage land of Scotland, would be made to yield one-third more than 
its present produce, and deducting from the value of this third ad- 
ditional produce, the interest of money advanced on improvement, 
the farmer would still be enabled to dispose of the produce of his 
farm at a reduction of fully a fourth of the present prices; and 
not only so, but as agricultural science is but in its infancy, by the 
increased countenance and aid of our aristocracy and large landed 
proprietors, an impulse would be given to improvement, new dis- 
coveries would be made in the way of manures, the treatment of 
soils, the cure of those diseases to which both plants and animals 
are liable, the implements employed in culture, and in a general- 
ly improved mode of management ; waste land might be reclaim- 
ed; the researches of the scientific would be enlisted in the ser- 
vice of the agriculturist ; and by such means, there is no improba- 
bility, that corn and the other produce of farms might be rais- 
ed and sold in this country at one-half, certainly at one-third

less than the present prices; the country would be able to sup- 
port its whole population without assistance from foreign coun- 
tries, while both the profits of the farmer and the rents of the land 
would remain undiminished or be advanced. It is generally cal- 
culated, that land of an average quality, when thoroughly improv- 
ed, will yield a return of from 10 to 12 bushels per acre more than 
before. If the produce before improvement, upon an average of 
years, was 4 bolls per acre, after improvement, the produce will be 
6 bolls, the increase in this instance being one-half of the whole 
former produce. The proportion of this additional increase, re- 
quired to pay a large per-centage on capital laid out in improving, 
being, according to circumstances, from a-fourth to a-sixth of the 
whole, there are still left from 6 to 10 bushels as clear disposable 
gain. The rapidly increasing population of the country demands 
that more food shall be raised, or in some other way provided, 
without any additional cost to the consumer : an increasing number 
of labourers also demands employment. And these demands may 
be met by a general adoption of agricultural improvement ; and 
this is a subject, we think, which merits, much more than it has re- 
ceived, the attention of proprietors in general. 

Geology. — -There are four different formations of rocks in the 
county, — the greywacke, the coal formation, the red sandstone, 
and the trap. The position and space occupied by these forma- 
tions would be better understood by the simple inspection of a co- 
loured geological map than they can be by any description. The 
greywacke and greywacke slate, which we shall first notice, occupy 
the whole western portion — almost theVestern half — of the county, 
with the exception of Liddesdale. The line separating this rock 
from the red sandstone, which occupies the middle and northern 
part of the county, might be traced from nearly the north-east 
corner of the parish of Melrose in a southern direction, skirting 
the base of the Eildon hills, thence by the east of the village of 
Bowden, through Hassendean on the banks of the Teviot, to the 
south of Hobkirk, whence it curves to the east by Southdean, Old 
Jedburgh and Oxnam ; a little beyond which, it disappears, or is 
seen only in a few detached spots left uncovered by the sandstone. 
All to the south of the line drawn from Hobkirk to Southdean, till 
you reach the borders of Castleton parish, is of the same rock. 
From Southdean to Oxnam, the greywacke occupies only a nar- 
row space of a few miles in breadth, the red sandstone covering it 
on the north and west, the trap rocks occupying nearly all to the 



408 



GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 



south and east. The greywacke of Roxburghshire presents 
the same general characters possessed by this rock in other dis- 
tricts. The strata are generally vertical or nearly so, but they 
vary from vertical to an inclination of 30°. They are found most 
usually to dip to the south-east like the other stratified rocks of 
the county, though they are also observed not unfrequently dip- 
ping" to the north-east, and even north-west. The whole of the 
large district occupied by this rock is hilly; but some of the high- 
er peaked and more abrupt hills are of trap and porphyry. 

The range of hills, separating the parish of Castleton from the 
rest of the county, is of greywacke ; but as you descend into Lid- 
desdale, you find resting on the southern slope of these hills, the 
rocks of the coal formation, which thenceforth occupy the whole 
of Liddesdale. A small portion of the great Northumbrian coal- 
field crosses the border into Scotland on the south and east of the 
parish of Southdean, and occupies, probably, a third of its extent. 
Coal is wrought on the English side of the Carter Fell, which 
here forms the boundary between the two kingdoms ; but none is 
wrought in the county of Roxburgh, though both here and in Lid- 
desdale limestone is frequent and abundant. A still smaller por- 
tion of the coal formation is exposed at Hunthill, in the neighbour- 
hood of Jedburgh, where a trial has lately been made for coal, 
with some prospect of success. The strata passed through in this 
attempt are grey and micaceous sandstones, limestone, clay-iron- 
stone, and shale, with thin seams of coal, and numerous vegetable 
impressions. These rocks seem to lie beneath a thin deposit of 
the red sandstone. A much larger, but much less distinct and 
characteristic portion of the same formation is found occupying 
the lower portion of the parish of Kelso, on the banks of the 
Tweed, part also of the parishes of Sprouston and Ednam, to the 
borders of the county. In the bed of the Teviot, near its con- 
fluence with the Tweed, some of the strata contain vegetable im- 
pressions in great abundance. 

The next formation is the red sandstone, and we may in the 
meantime call it the new red sandstone, without farther, in these 
present remarks, giving an opinion as to the claims of this rock to 
belong to an older formation. It occupies all the middle and 
northern parts of the county, excepting those districts we have 
already described, as occupied by the greywacke and coal series, 
and it is bounded on the south and east by a line, which, for all 
general purposes, we may regard as stretching in nearly a straight

course, from near Southdean, by Old Jedburgh, to the northern 
point of the parish of Yethohn, on the borders of England : all 
to the south and east of this line is occupied by the great trap 
formation of the Cheviot. Small detached portions of the red 
sandstone are occasionally found considerably below the limits 
now assigned to it, as if it had at one time extended over a much 
larger space. Splendid sections of this rock may be observed on 
the banks of the Kale, the Oxnam, the Jed, and the Rule, as 
also of the Tweed and Teviot. Though the usual colour of this 
sandstone is red, yet it not unfrequently also occurs of a white co- 
lour, and there are many excellent quarries of both the red and 
white varieties, in different parts of the county. Though it fre- 
quently, therefore, is found in beds of considerable thickness, and 
is employed as a good substantial building stone, yet its most usual 
mode of occurrence is in thin and almost horizontal strata, soft, 
brittle, and easily decomposing. Possessing, in general, the cha- 
racters of the new red, it occupies, in many situations, the place 
of the old red sandstone, resting immediately on the greywacke, 
without the interposition of the coal formation, even where this is 
found in the same neighbourhood. Elsewhere, however, we find 
it apparently covering, and in that case, therefore, nearer than the 
coal series. The total absence of fossil organic remains in this 
sandstone is a principal cause of the uncertainty which exists with 
regard to its relative age. Many observations, indeed, are yet 
wanting, before it can with any certainty be said, that all the three 
classes, the old red, as well as the coal, and the new red sand- 
stones, do not exist in this part of the county. 

The last class of formations in the county are the traps and por- 
phyries ; and of these, the felspar porphyry, usually of a reddish- 
brown colour, but varying also very much in this respect, is by far 
the most abundant. The whole of the Cheviot range, and indeed the 
whole of the district, comprehending the parishes of Yetholm, More- 
battle, Hounam, and the greater part of Oxnam, are composed of 
this rock, as well as several of the higher hills in other parts of the 
county. It is also apparently the oldest of the Plutonian rocks of 
Roxburghshire ; of more recent origin than the greywacke and the 
coal formation, but older than the red sandstone, fragments of 
this porphyry being one of the most abundant materials found in 
the conglomerate which forms the lowest and oldest of the sand- 
stone strata ; and we have instances also of the red sandstone, in 
its usual almost horizontal position, and unaltered in appearance,

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 



resting immediately over the porphyry. There are many trap 
rocks in the county, greenstone, basalt, trap tuff, amygdaloid, 
&amp;c. some or all of which appear to be of later origin than the 
felspar porphyry now described. In the red sandstone district, 
trap rocks are numerous and abundant, every mile, often every 
half, and even quarter of a mile presenting some variety of this 
rock, in dikes, or in some other of the various modes in which it 
occurs. Some of these have obviously passed upwards through 
the sandstone, elevating, dislocating, and indurating the strata. 
Again, in other situations, the sandstone seems as if it had been 
quietly deposited over the trap. In the coal formation of Lid- 
desdale, also, traps occur of newer origin than the stratified rocks. 
One in particular presents itself on the opposite bank of the Lid- 
del from Castleton manse, where the stratified rocks from an in- 
clination of about 30°, are suddenly thrown up into a vertical, 
and even partly reversed position, and are considerably indurated. 

In this hasty survey of the distribution of the rocks of the county, 
we have been unable to notice many interesting appearances pre- 
sented by all the different formations of rocks, some of which might 
have thrown some light on the discussion affecting the relative age 
of the red sandstone of this and the neighbouring county of Ber- 
wick, — a question somewhat more difficult to determine, than it 
may perhaps appear to be, from these brief notices. 

Soils. — Over the greywacke, the soil is generally a thin, cold, 
wet clay, of a grey or white colour. Where, from its situation, it is 
intermixed with the ingredients of other rocks, and especially where 
it has been improved by under-draining, and possesses the ad- 
vantage of shelter, the soil seems well adapted for the growth 
of white crops, but still late. According to circumstances and si- 
tuation, the crops in «such districts are from one to three weeks 
later than in similar and equally elevated situations in the county, 
but where a different class of rocks prevails. Over the coal for- 
mation, the soil is generally weak and sandy ; on the higher 
grounds, much intermixed with peaty matter, and therefore wet. 
This description is applicable chiefly to the southern districts of 
the county, where the coal formation covers a large extent of sur- 
face ; but is not true with respect to the Kelso district, where nu- 
merous strata of indurated and shaly marls alternate with the sand- 
stone, and all the surrounding higher grounds are of trap rocks, 
where shelter also abounds, and the lands have been long in cut- 



ON THE COUNTY OP ROXBURGH. 



471 



tivation. Here, therefore, upon an open subsoil, the soil, espe- 
cially in the lower grounds, is a deep rich sandy loam. 

Over the red sandstone, the soil is of various qualities, being 
among the best and the worst in the county. The quality of the 
soil varies very much with the quality and ingredients of the sand- 
stone, which is sometimes a loose, gritty, silicious rock, easily dis- 
integrating, much impregnated with iron, and containing a very 
small proportion of clay ; at other times, much finer in its texture, 
with a greater adhesion among its particles, and containing, with 
not less iron perhaps, a large proportion of clay. Over this latter 
description of rock, there is generally a deep rich red and rather 
early soil, while over the former there rests often the most worth- 
less description of soil in the county, an unproductive sand. There 
is every variety, however, in the district occupied by the red sand- 
stone, between these two descriptions of soil. 

Over the trap and porphyry rocks of the county, there is generally 
a loose, light, warm, dry and early soil, except on haugh lands, where 
there is generally a deposit of deep, rich, strong clay loam. The 
higher trap districts afford the finest sheep pasture in the county. 
Of course, these remarks must be understood as applying in a very 
general manner to the soils of the county. For in a district like 
Roxburghshire, so much intersected by streams, most of which 
flow through all the classes of rocks described, it must be expected, 
that in the lower and more highly cultivated situations especially, 
there will be a great intermixture and combination of materials in 
the composition of our soils. 

Roads.— The roads in the county are in general good,— we 
might almost use a stronger term,— and they have been much im- 
proved of late years. In the wilder districts of the county, where 
the roads have been more recently formed, they are better, per- 
haps, than in many of the older cultivated districts ; probably from 
this cause, that more good sense is now displayed in selecting the 
line of road, as well as superior skill in their original construction ; 
both which causes operate in rendering them more easily kept in 
repair. Coaches from Edinburgh to England pass through all 
the principal towns of the county ; and during the bathing season, 
a coach travels from Hawick through Jedburgh and Kelso to 
Berwick and Spittal ; and Kelso furnishes a daily coach for its in- 
habitants during the same season, as well as a coach twice a week 
to Berwick throughout the year.

[The old people in Nisbet remember the gable end of the house in which Samuel 
Rutherfurd was born and brought up. It was regarded with peculiar honour as as- 
sociated with the memory of so great and good a man, and was permitted to stand as 
long as it could hang together. Nor is it long since there were living in the villas 
two old women, Jane and Isabella Rutherfurd, who claimed relationship to their emi- 
nent ancestor. Rutherfurd is one of the most ancient names in the baroay 

The Souhses had a residence close to the village of Nisbet. The ruins of it existed 
till within a recent period. On the spot of its foundation were found two silver coins 
one a crown piece of Philip II. of Spain, the other a small piece of one of the Ed- 
wards.

In the next oldest record, from 1603 to 1624, it is generally 
spelled Peibles. The author of Caledonia, after an indifferent 
sarcasm against Dr Dalgliesh in the former Account, for deriv- 
ing the name from " the pebbles with which the soil abounds," 
deduces it from the Celtic word Pebyll, corresponding with the 
Saxon word Shiels, and signifying moveable dwellings or tem- 
porary encampments. The parish is bounded on the south by Ma- 
nor and Yarrow; on the west, by'Lyne, Stobo, and Manor south- 
east, by Yarrow and Traquair; east, by Innerleithen ; and north, by 
Eddlestone. From east to west it extends about six miles, and 
from north to south about ten; but the most southern part, stretch- 
ing three or four miles into Selkirkshire, is uninhabited. The 
burgh may be considered as the centre of the parish ; and none of 
the inhabitants are above 3£ miles from the parish church. The 
parish is calculated by the author of the « Companion to the Map 
of Tweecldale" to contain 18,210 acres ; which calculation was 
submitted to the Court of Teinds in 1821, and sustained. 

Topographical Appearances.— The general aspect of the parish 
is hilly, except along the banks of the Eddlestone water and the 
Tweed, on the latter of which is a vale of considerable size, com- 
mencing at Peebles, and extending to the extremity of the parish 
towards the east. None of the hills rise to a great height, as in 
some of the neighbouring parishes. They are, for the most part, 
grassy, except those towards the south, which are covered with 
heather, and abound in grouse.

Meteorology.— From the land being almost all of a light gravelly 
soil, from the absence of stagnant water or marshy ground, and 
from the elevated situation of the parish, the air is healthy, 
though keen. The medium height of the barometer at Peebles, 
535 feet above the sea, is 29.2 in summer, and 29 in win- 
ter. The medium depth of rain yearly, on an average of seven 
years, is about 26.75 inches. The prevailing wind is the south- 
west, which blows at least nine months in the year. The eastern 
fogs, which overspread the Lothians, scarcely ever reach Peebles. 

Hydrography. — The Tweed runs here a course of about h\ 
miles, dividing the parish nearly into twoequal parts. The whole 
course of this beautiful and far-famed river, the fourth m mag- 
nitude in Scotland, is about 90 miles, with a fall of 1500 feet; 
and it is calculated to drain about 1870 square miles of coun- 
try Though at Peebles it has run only about one-third of its 
course, it has fallen no less than 1000 feet, i. e. 331 feetper mile; 
and in the remainder of its course to Berwick, about 60 miles, it 
falls 500 feet, or 8± feet per mile. On entering the parish of 
Peebles, and onwards, the Tweed is confined within narrow banks ; 
but immediately below the bridge, a beautiful and extensive vale 
opens, resembling more an Italian than a Scottish landscape On 
reaching the parish of Peebles, it receives the Lyne water; which, 
in the opinion of some writers, is entitled to be regarded as « the 
head of Tweed," and not a tributary. The Lyne, however, has 
nothing of the character of a great river, and does not contain 
a sixth part of the waters of the Tweed. A mile lower down, 
the Tweed receives the Manor water from the south, the Eddie- 
stone water at Peebles, and the Haystone burn two miles farther 
down. All these streams abound in trout; and anglers may be seen 
on their banks almost all the year. The jf 
from April to October is immense, and far exceeds belief. Salmon 
are sometimes taken in considerable numbers, but, owing to the dis- 
tance from the sea, they are much inferior in quality to those caught 
near the mouth of the river. The system of drainage has proved 
unfavourable to the run of salmon, for the heaviest rains are soon 
carried off, and a flood seldom lasts more than a few hours ; whereas

formerly, a heavy rain required some days to run off; and the river 
being thus kept full, the fish could easily ascend. 

Miierals. — Though the upper part of the country abounds in 
minerals, the parish of Peebles can boast of very few. Sandstone 
is unknown, and there has been no appearance of coal. A quarry 
of transition limestone, indeed, was opened many years ago about 
two miles from Peebles, on the Edinburgh road; but the lime was of 
so coarse a quality, and coals were so expensive, that the working 
of it was soon abandoned, and it has never since been resumed. 
Greywacke abounds in all the hills ; and as it is frequently of a 
fine texture when dressed, the houses built of it have a very hand- 
some appearance. The strata of the low grounds are generally 
covered with gravel and sand. 

II. — Civil History. 

There is reason to believe that Peebles contained a considerable 
number of inhabitants at a very early period. The fertile valleys 
on both sides of the Tweed would early invite settlers, and its se- 
cluded situation would afford them protection against hostile inva- 
sion. The wild mountains and thick forest of Ettrick protected 
the inhabitants against inroads from the south and east, and an 
equal barrier was opposed against invasion from the Lothians. It 
was only when the woods began to be cleared that the inhabitants 
at length took part in the disputed successions to the throne, or 
became exposed to the hostile inroads, of the English. 

Historical Notices.— The earliest notices of Peebles give intima- 
tion of some advancement in agriculture and civilization. The 
Inquisitio of David Earl of Cumberland, afterwards king David L 
in 1 1 16, found that there had belonged it does not state how long 
to the See of Glasgow, "una carrucata ploughgate, terraeetec- 
clesia ;"  and shortly after, we find mention made of a mill an d brewery. 
It is seldom that a poor or thinly inhabited district can support ex- 
tensive religious establishments; Peebles must therefore have at- 
tained to considerable eminence. Accordingly, we find that Ingelram 
K ewbigging, Rector of Peebles, and Archdeacon of Glasgow, after 
having been made Chancellor of the kingdom by King David in 
1151, was appointed Bishop of Glasgow in 1164. When Rector 
Qt Peebles, he vigorously defended the independence of the Scot- 
tish church against the claim of superiority set up by Roger, Arch- 
bishop of York, m a provincial council held at Norham, and after- 
wards at Rome, where he recommended himself so much to the.

favour of Pope Alexander the Third, that he was consecrated by 
him Bishop of Glasgow, notwithstanding the opposition made by 
the agents of the Archbishop of York.  

From a very early period, Peebles was the favourite residence of 
many of the Scottish kings, and particularly of Alexander III. who 
seems to have been much attached to it, and who gave a substan- 
tial proof of his munificence by building and endowing the Cross 
Kirk, and a monastery for Red Friars. The place was chosen 
from its vicinity to the extensive forests, in which these princes 
might enjoy the amusements of the chase. During the usurpation of 
Edward I. " the baillyf, several burgesses, and tote la comunate de 
Pebles," swore fealty to him at Berwick in 1296. In 1304, the 
same king granted to Aymer de Valence " burgum nostrum de 
Pebbles cum molendinis." It does not appear, however, to have 
been created a Royal Burgh till the year 1367, when David II. 
granted it a charter, which was confirmed by charters from James 
II., James IV., and James VI. in 1621. The charter granted by 
David II. was probably given in reward for the loyalty of the inhabi- 
tants in having sent two representatives to the Scottish Parliament in 
1357, to provide a ransom for their sovereign, who had been taken 
prisoner ten years before by the English at Neville's Cross. The 
town not being a royal burgh, must have been distinguished for its 
wealth and influence; otherwise it had not been entitled to join 
with sixteen of the principal towns in Scotland in sending repre- 
sentatives to Parliament. 

The charter of James VI. confirming former grants and privi- 
leges, affords a strong proof of the liberality of former monarchs, and 
of the extensive possessions belonging to the burgh. « Our royal 
muir of Cademuir, Hamildean, Venlaw, Glentras, the Castle-hill, 
with the mill-granary, called the Ruid Mill, and Wauk Mill, built 
upon the side of the said Castle-hill, and with the mill-granary, 
called the Auld mill, upon the water of Peebles, the mill and gra- 
nary of Innerleithen," f attest the wealth of the burgh in former 
times. Cademuir was afterwards divided into " soums" by the 
burgesses, and these soums are now sold like any other transfer- 
able property. The land is let as a sheep-farm, and the soum- 
holders receive rent according to the number of their shares. Of 
all the rest of the extensive possessions, little else now remains than 
the farm of Shielgreen, acquired by purchase, and a few fields 
near the town. " Large tracts of land," says the author of the Agn-

cultural Survey of Peebles-shire, " extending on the hills for six or 
seven miles downward to Gatehope burn, would seem to have been 
granted to Peebles in property, or in right of pasturage, the rights 
to which are now lost, from encroachment, or through dereliction." 
In 1712, in a petition to the presbytery against the induction of 
the presentee to the church by the magistrates, chiefly on account 
of his youth, they lay much stress on their paying one-third of the 
stipend. At present the stipend paid by the burgh is, on an average, 
only L.16 a-year. f 

In 1545, when the Earl of Hertford, afterwards Protector So- 
merset, in revenge for the defeat which the English had sustained 
the year before under Lord Evers, from the Scots, commanded by 
the Earl of Angus, destroyed the towns of Kelso and Melrose, 
with their magnificent abbeys, — Peebles shared the same fate, and 
was reduced to ashes. The churches, greatly inferior to those 
two splendid edifices, seem to have escaped the vengeance of the 
invaders and were spared. In 1604, the town suffered severely 
from an accidental fire. The houses being thatched, the destruc- 
tion of property was very great. In the civil war, Cromwell's troops 
occupied Peebles during the siege of Neidpath Castle, and, from 
want of accommodation, they stabled their horses in St. Andrew's 
Church, the principal place of worship in the parish. From there 
being no record or tradition of excesses committed, it is probable 
that the severe discipline of the Protector secured the inhabi- 
tants against any outrage of the soldiers. " The inhabitants of 
this district," says Pennecuik, " are of so loyal and peaceable dis- 
positions, that they have seldom or never appeared in arms against 
their lawful sovereign ; nor were there amongst that great number 
twelve persons from Tweeddale at the insurrection of Rullion-green 
or Bothwell Bridge. Of their loyalty they gave sufficient testi- 
mony at the fight of Philiphaugh, where several of them were kil- 
led by David Leslie's army, and others, the most eminent of their 
gentry, taken prisoners." In the Rebellions of 1715 and 1745, 
the inhabitants of Peebles remained unconcerned spectators of the 
struggle ; and, though there were Jacobite families in the district, 
they had fortunately the prudence to take no part, in the unhappy 
conflict. 

But though the inhabitants of Tweeddale have been distinguish-

ed for their peaceful habits, — in seasons of danger and alarm 
they rivalled their border brethren of Selkirk and Roxburgh- 
shires in patriotic devotedness to the service of their country. 
When the war broke out after the treaty of Amiens, and the coun- 
try was threatened with foreign invasion, an additional levy of vo- 
lunteers and yeomanry was ordered, and the loyal inhabitants of 
Peebles, considering the exigencies of the times, mustered no less 
than 682 effective officers and men as an infantry corps, and two 
troops of cavalry, making a total of 820 soldiers, — besides furnish- 
ing their quota to the militia. This force, out of a population of 
8800, exceeded the muster made by any other county in Scot- 
land, according to the number of its inhabitants ; and in that spirit- 
stirring period, a finer body of men could not be found in Britain, 
nor one more prepared to repel foreign invasion, or " nobly die 
the second glorious part," than the hardy and patriotic sons of 
Tweeddale. In Pennecuik's time the number of militia was 266 
foot, and 29 horse. 

Ecclesiastical History.— At what period, Peebles was added to 
the diocese of Glasgow, it is difficult to ascertain. That it had 
belonged to it previous to the inquisitio of David in 1116, we have 
already seen. When that prince refounded the see of Glasgow, he 
seems to have conferred on the bishops of Glasgow the whole of 
the ecclesiastical rights, while he retained the demesne of Peebles. 

The church of St Andrew, for many ages the parish church, 
seems to have been built on the ruins of the old one in the year 
1195, as it was consecrated by Bishop Joceline, who, in 1174, 
succeeded Ingelram, already mentioned. In 1260, the Conventual 
Church of the Holy Cross was built by Alexander HI. in honour of 
St. Nicholaus, who was supposed to have suffered martyrdom in the 
third century. This church of the Holy Cross was one of the four in 
Scotland called ministries, and their governor was styled minister, f 
It was founded for Red or Trinity friars, seventy in number ; and 
was richly endowed, not only by its royal founder, but by many 
princely donations, particularly from the noble and powerful fa- 
mily of Frazer, who, during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, 
possessed a great part of Tweeddale. The strath of the Tweed, 
from its source to the brook which forms the eastern boundary of

the parish of Peebles, separating it from Innerleithen, was the pro- 
perty of that family, — extending to about thirty miles. 

Some branches of the family of Frazer acquired extensive pro- 
perty in East-Lothian, and we learn from Crawford's Lives of the 
Officers of State, that a branch of that family was proprietor of 
the lands of Forton, in the parish of Athelstaneford. Frazer 
of Forton seems to have given from his lands of East Forton ten 
bolls of wheat and ten bolls of barley, to the monks of the Cross 
Church of Peebles ; and that quantity of grain continued to be 
delivered to the minister of the Holy Cross Church of Peebles 
after the Reformation, when monastic institutions were abolished 
in Scotland. That donation of grain from the lands of Forton 
had been reckoned so valuable, that it was included in the deed of 
entail of the March estate, and has descended to the Earl of 
Wemyss and March, the heir of entail. 

In 1218, Patrick, the fifth Earl of Dunbar, founded a monas- 
tery of Red friars at Dunbar; and Christian Bruce, wife of Patrick, 
the seventh Earl of Dunbar, and only daughter of Robert the 
Bruce, competitor with Baliol for the throne of Scotland, built a 
noble mansion for the Red friars at Dunbar. That establishment 
was suppressed at Dunbar sometime before the Reformation ; and 
in the inventory of the late Duke of Queensberry's papers, is the 
following extract : " Gift by King James the Fifth, under the 
Great Seal, to the Holy Cross Church of Peebles, of a house in 
Dunbar built by Christian Bruce, Countess of Dunbar, and given 
by her to the brethren of the order of the Holy Trinity, formerly 
at Dunbar, then translated to Peebles, dated 5th July 1529." 

It appears from other documents, that sundry houses in the 
West Port of Edinburgh, and certain lands in the parish of Cra- 
mond, had been gifted to the Cross Church of Peebles. All the 
above sources of income appear to have been conferred on William 
Earl of March, second son of the Duke of Queensberry, at the pe- 
riods of the Revolution of 1688, and of the Union in 1707, together 
with fifty acres of rich glebe land lying in the vicinity of the church, 
— only four acres being reserved for the minister of the parish of 
Peebles. 

Dr Pennecuik mentions three churches and three old steeples. 
The third church was the chapel attached to the castle, which in 
former times stood on the mound called the Castle-hill, on which 
the present church is built. The chapel stood twenty or thirty 
yards to the east of the present church, and occupied the middle

of the High Street. It was a long narrow Gothic building, but 
when or by whom built is unknown. It seems not to have be- 
longed to the see of Glasgow, but, according to the Rev. James 
Morton, author, of the Monastic Annals of Teviotdale, King Wil- 
liam confirmed to the monks of Kelso the possession of the chapel 
of the castle of Peebles, with a ploughgate belonging to it, and 
10s. a-year, granted by his grandfather, King David, out of the 
revenues of the burgh, to found a chapel in which to say mass for 
the soul of his son Earl Henry.  Immediately to the west of 
this chapel ran the town wall ; and a port opened to a deep ditch 
or pass, which might be considered a kind of fosse, to prevent an 
entrance from the bridge. The chapel continued for many years 
to be the place of the meeting of presbytery and kirk-session, and 
frequently for the celebration of marriages, till the building of the 
present church was begun, when it was pulled down. Of the cas- 
tle and its chapel, not a vestige now remains. 

A hospitium dedicated to St Leonard for the support of aged 
and infirm persons, and for temporary relief to strangers, stood at 
the eastern extremity of the parish, on the farm of Eshiels, part 
of the Hayston estate. No part of it now remains. At the Re- 
formation, the church of the Holy Cross became the parish church ; 
but from the numerous meetings of the heritors for repairs, as re- 
corded in the session-books, it seems for many years to have been 
in very bad order. It was finally abandoned in 1784, when the 
present church was opened for public worship. Of St Andrew's 
church little now remains except the tower. It stands in the midst 
of a spacious burying-ground, which, though of great antiquity, 
contains no monuments of any great interest. The Cross church, 
when deserted, by being used as a quarry, was fast disappearing, 
when a public-spirited citizen, the late Mr John Turnbull, pur- 
chased it from the magistrates, and stopped the work of desecra- 
tion. The late Sir John Hay, whose family vault it contained, 
afterwards purchased it, and, planting a considerable piece of ground 
around it, enclosed the whole with a wall. The cross, which stood 
on that part of the High Street which still bears its name, was 
also doomed to destruction, and was sold for building materials. 
It was a work of great antiquity, having been erected by one of 
the Frazers of Neidpath Castle before the time of Robert the Bruce, 
and bears the arms of the Frazers. After the pedestal had been

removed, and used in the ignoble work for which it was sold, the 
shaft was purchased, at about five times the price which had been 
paid for the whole, by the present Sir John Hay, and was by him 
transported to his seat of King's Meadows, where it ornaments the 
pleasure-ground of the only descendant of the Frazers now in 
Tweeddale. 

Parochial Registers. — The oldest session record is entitled " a 
Register of the Kirke at Pebles, containing the discipline of the 
sessione by the elderis, and diligence of the deacones for the poore, 
there begun in the year 1657. Mr John Hay, minister." — The 
session consisted of no less than eight elders and six deacons for 
the burgh, and seven elders and six deacons for the landward part 
of the parish. The records appear to have been kept with great 
accuracy till 1760, from which time till 1808 they are written on 
detached pieces of paper, and, like the Sibylline leaves, they have 
been ludibria ventis, as many of them are irrecoverably lost. The 
presbytery and synod records extend back as far as 1596, and are 
in a state of good preservation. The oldest register of baptisms 
begins in 1622, and ends in 1659 ; that of funerals begins in 1660. 

Antiquities. — On the top of the hill of Cademuir maybe traced 
the remains of a Roman camp, and on Janet's Brae, about half a 
mile east from Peebles, the remains of two camps are still visible. 
The castle of Neidpath has been so often described of late that a 
very short notice of it may suffice. It is a large square building, 
more distinguished for massive strength than architectural beauty. 
It was built and long possessed by the powerful family of Frazer, 
and, by the marriage of the heiress of that house, passed, along 
with the hereditary sheriffship of the county, into the family of the 
Hays of Gifford, the ancestor of the present Marquis of Tweed- 
dale. In 1686, the second Earl of Tweeddale sold his estates in 
Peebles-shire to the first Duke of Queensberry, who settled them 
on his second son, the Earl of March, who, on the abolition of he- 
ritable jurisdictions in 1747, claimed L. 4000 for the sheriffship 
of Peebles, and was allowed L. 3418, 4s. 5d. for that office and 
the regality of Nevvlands.  The late Duke of Queensberry, who 
was born in the town residence of the noble family of March in 
Peebles, commonly called the deans' house, as it had belonged to 
the deans of Peebles in former days, spent the early part of his 
hfe, and was educated in Neidpath Castle.

Peblis to the Play, c— Peebles, though in former times celebrated 
for games and amusements, at which sovereigns presided, can now 
boast of no such diversions. " Peblis to the Play" gives us a good 
specimen of former sports and pastimes. " It was composed," as a 
profound scholar, and good judge of early Scottish literature writes 
to me, " by James L, one of the most distinguished characters of the 
age in which he lived. It is written in the same stanza as Christ-kirk 
on the Grene. Like that poem, it is descriptive of rustic merriment 
and of rustic quarrels, and it is conspicuous for the same rich vein 
of native humour. It was first published by Pinkerton, and occurs 
in his select Scottish Ballads, Vol. ii. Lond. 1783." By a strange 
and unaccountable mistake which a perusal of one stanza of the 
poem would have corrected, Peblis to the Play has often been ascrib- 
ed to Allan Ramsay, who, like Hercules of old, seems to have fa- 
thered all unappropriated prodigies. Connected with the locali- 
ty of Peebles is another poem of merit though little known. " From 
an edition which appeared at Edinburgh in 1603, Mr Pinkerton 
has also published," says the learned author of the Life of Bu- 
chanan, « The Thrie Tailes of the Thrie Priests of Peblis. These 
tales, with apparent propriety, have been referred to the reign of 
James III. Many of the allusions are completely applicable to the 
conduct of that deluded prince. King James, it will be necessary 
to recollect, was slain in the year 1488 ; and the style of the poem 
does not seem of a modern cast. " The three priests of Peebles 
having met on St Bride's day for the purpose of regaling them- 
selves, agree that each in his turn shall endeavour to entertain the 
rest by relating some story. They acquit themselves with sufficient 
propriety. The tales are of a moral tendency, but at the same 
time are free from the dulness which so frequently infests the pre- 
ceptive compositions of our earlier poets."  The earliest edition 
that has been traced of this curious poem was " imprinted at Edin- 
burgh be Robert Charteris," 1603, 4to. It is a book of great 
rarity, and probably not more than one copy exists. 

III. — Population. 
Before the Reformation the population was probably far greater 
than at present. The numerous religious houses, the charitable 
endowments, the hospitia, the mills and breweries, all betoken a 
great propulation, and a well-maintained set of inhabitants. There 
is much truth in many of our old Scotch songs, which ascribe 

• Irving's Lives of the Early Scottish Poets, Vol. i. p. 372. 



PEEBLES.

comfort and plenty to the neighbourhood of mills and breweries. 
As every farm-steading, and almost every hamlet had its brewery, 
and generally its mill, and as numerous cottages were invariably, 
till about the middle or close of last century, attached to farm- 
houses, we might naturally expect to find a great population. Be- 
sides this, the members of religious houses were in general not only 
good farmers themselves, but they taught their tenants, to whom 
they were kind and indulgent landlords, the best mode of cultivat- 
ing their lands. Hence we almost invariably find that the preva- 
lence of religious houses in any district during the time of Popery, 
so far from checking agricultural improvements, had the opposite 
effect ; and if the best land of the parish belonged to such esta- 
blishments, it was not because the monks or friars appropriat- 
ed it to themselves, which they had no power to do, but because, 
while the bulk of the community were engaged in warfare, or were 
too indolent or ignorant to cultivate their lands, they were render- 
ing theirs productive by their superior diligence, industry, and 
skill. So far from many of the inmates of the religious houses 
being only lazy drones, " fruges consumere nati," they laboured 
with their own hands to raise the produce which they consumed. 

Other circumstances some ages ago contributed to the population 
of Peebles. It was the favourite summer quarters of the Scottish 
kings for the sports of the chase till the accession of James VI. to 
the crown of England ; the residence of many of the Scottish no- 
bility, and the castle of Neidpath, the seat of the powerful family, 
whether of the Frazers, the Hays, or the Douglases,— could not 
fail to attract a numerous train of followers and dependents. Add 
to this, that the great extent of the burgh lands and free pasturage 
must have contributed to keep up a great population, as many of 
the burgesses were enabled by their civic privileges to live as small 
farmers. 

The present incumbent has examined the presbytery and ses- 
sion records from the earliest date, but he can no where find any 
entry made of the number of the inhabitants. Dr Webster's re- 
port gave 1896 souls; but Mr Findlater observes, that « that re- 
turn was made up from calculations founded upon the proportion 
which the whole population is supposed to bear to the examinable 
persons upon the minister's examination roll." No accurate cal- 
culate can be given from such data. It is extremely difficult to 
make up accurate lists, and the number of examinable persons may 
fluctuate m different years.

Of these cases, when both parties belonged to the parish, the num- 
ber was 79 ; and 55 when only one belonged to the parish. 

The number of baptisms, as recorded from the beginning of 
1827 to the end of 1832, is 284, averaging 47 a-year. But, 
as many of the dissenters do not register the births of their child- 
ren, the above list is considerably below the number of children 
born. 

As the church-yard has been for some years past carefully watch- 
ed, the remains of persons belonging to other parishes are fre- 
quently brought hither for interment ; a very accurate return, there- 
fore, of the number of deaths in this parish cannot be given. But 
as nearly as can be calculated, the average number of deaths may 
be stated at 47 a-year, for several years past. From 1780 to 1789, 
inclusive, the yearly average was 48/o ; from 1790 to the end of 
the century the number was 31 a-year; and from 1800 to 1809, 
inclusive, it was 48 a-year.

It is not probable that there will be any great increase of popu- 
lation either in the burgh or landward part of the parish for many 
years to come. Hamlets have disappeared ; and no more cottages 
are kept up than what are sufficient for the accommodation of the

cultivators of the soil. The town is not extending its limits, and 
when a house is built, it is generally a handsome structure raised 
on the site of one that has fallen to decay, adding to the beauty 
of the town without increasing the number of inhabitants. 

The number of illegitimate births in the parish annually may 
average 5. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — The number of Scotch acres 
under the plough is 2500 : and it is believed that a very small por- 
tion of land not yet cultivated could be cultivated with profit. 

Plantations. — When Dr Pennecuik published his Description of 
Tweeddale in 1715, there seems to have been very little wood in 
this county. " Their greatest want," says he, " is of timber, little 
planting to be seen in Tweeddale, except it be some few bushes 
of trees about the houses of the gentry, and not one wood worth 
the naming in all this open and windy county ; so that this un- 
happy want of foresight in their forefathers necessitates them to 
be obliged to the sheriffdom of Lanrick for most part of the tim- 
ber necessary for their houses and husbandry."  This reproach 
is now fortunately wiped off, and the county, particularly the lower 
part of it, presents a different aspect from what it did in Penne- 
cuik's days. The late Sir John Hay, the principal proprietor 
in this parish, towards the end of last century, in addition to va- 
rious improvements on the estate of Haystone, planted above 300 
acres. The present Sir John Hay has within these three years 
planted upwards of 700 acres, and is still carrying on the work of 
planting. The Earl of Wemyss and March has also planted be- 
tween 200 and 300 acres; and other proprietors, though on a 
smaller scale, have ornamented their estates with plantations. 

The land is a light sharp soil, well adapted for oats, barley, and 
pease. Of late years, wheat has been sown to a considerable ex- 
tent, and if the returns are not equal to those in the Lothians, the 
deficiency is not to be ascribed to the unskilfulness of the farmer, 
but to the difference of soil. The quality seems excellent/f 

Husbandry. — The farmers having, from experience, found that 
the land " had become tired of bearing rye-grass and clover," in- 
stead of a rotation of four years, extend it to five and six years. 
Turnips are universally cultivated, and are frequently eaten on the

ground by sheep. The ordinary rotation is, 1. after grass, oats; 
2. pease, turnips, or potatoes ; 3. wheat or barley, and then rye- 
grass and clover. The writer of this in spring 1832, and again in 
1833, tried the experiment of sowing oats of the Kildrummy kind in 
the month of February, as he had seen practised in the south of 
England. Both experiments perfectly succeeded, though he was 
told that one-half of the seed would be destroyed by the wet, and 
the other half be devoured by birds. The return this season from 
scarcely three quarters of an English acre was 8 bolls 4 bushels im- 
perial measure, of 6 bushels to the boll, and 2 bushels of light grain. 
It was of excellent quality. When made into meal, it yielded a 
good deal more than what millers term meal for corn. In the be- 
ginning of last November, he sowed two small patches with barley 
and oats, the braird of which promises well. 

Breeds of Live Stock. — The Teeswater breed of cattle is gene- 
rally reared by the farmers, as it fattens best for the butcher. 
The sheep are the Cheviot and black-faced breed. Smearing is 
generally practised, and tends greatly to the preservation of sheep. 
Tar and palm-oil are generally used on black-faced sheep, and 
tar and butter on the Cheviot. About six fleeces of the black- 
faced smeared make a stone of 24 lb., and from six to eight fleeces 
of the Cheviot. Rock mercury was at one time used for smearing, 
but as it was found neither to contribute to the warmth of the sheep, 
nor to promote the growth of the wool, it was laid aside. Wool has 
been sold at higher prices this year than for many years past. 
Black-faced, smeared, was sold at 13s. a-stone, and the Cheviot from 
20s. to 23s. a-stone of 241b. The diseases to which the sheep in 
this parish are most subject are sickness and the louping-ill. The 
former is inflammation in the bowels or blood, and prevails in pas- 
tures where heather abounds. Hogs suffer most from this disease. 
Castor-oil or salts are the best remedies. The louping-ill or palsy 
prevails in the month of May and beginning of June, particularly 
during a dry east wind. It attacks lambs and sheep of all ages. 
Sturdy, or water in the head, may also be mentioned in the list of 
diseases. The seat of the disease is easily discovered by that part 
of the skull becoming soft and spongy. If not near the root of 
the horns, it is generally cured by applying red hot iron ; but this 
seldom succeeds if the disease is near the horns. 

Rent of Land. — The rent of arable land may be reckoned at 
25s. an acre, except a few fields near the town, which bring a 
higher rent. One of the best farms in the parish, and per

haps in the county, consisting of 450 acres, all arable, is let for 
L. 625 a-year. The yearly rental of the parish is supposed to be 
about L. 7000. 

Rate of Wages. — Female servants receive from L. 4 to L. 5 from 
Whitsunday till Martinmas, and between L. 2 to L. 3 for the other 
half year. Ploughmen, when lodged in their masters' houses, re- 
ceive from L. 8 to L. 14 a-year. When married men, they are 
paid in meal, money, a cow's grass, &amp;c. Shepherds in this pas- 
toral county have generally a certain number of grazings for sheep, 
and their wages must therefore depend on the price of wool and 
the value of sheep. Labourers during the summer are paid from 
9s. to 12s. a- week : masons and wrights, 15s. 

The average gross amount and value of raw produce yearly rais- 
ed in the parish as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows. 

Assuming that there are 3000 English acres, and that Jive years are the usual rota- 
tion, 600 acres will thus be annually allowed for each crop. An entire crop is 
seldom taken of one kind of grain, &amp;c. as in the fourth and fifth break.

Manufactures. — Much has been said against the want of enter- 
prise and public spirit in the inhabitants not introducing manufac- 
tures. The high price of coals is one obstacle; and, though there 
is plenty of water, it might be difficult to procure another fall of 
water in addition to that of the Tweed used for the corn-mills, and 
that of the Eddlestone water for the waulk-mills. A manufactory 
for carding, spinning, and making cloth, flannel, and plaiding to a 
very considerable extent, has for several years existed. In the

same establishment waulking and dyeing are carried on. Stocking- 
making is also a branch of manufacture here, but of very limited ex- 
tent. Cotton webs are sent from Glasgow, but afford a very poor 
remuneration to the weavers, few of whom can, with the utmost 
dilio-ence, earn more than six shillings a-week. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Town.— Peebles, the capital of the county, and the seat of 
the presbvtery, is situated on the north side of the Tweed, in 
latitude 55° 38' 40", and 3° 6' west longitude, the meridian of 
Edinburgh passing through the town. It is 21 miles south from 
Edinburgh, 22 from Selkirk, and 54 from Glasgow. The town is 
divided into the Old and New, the former standing on a high ridge 
of ground, with the Tweed forming the southern boundary ; and ex- 
tending to the east on a lower tract of ground ; it is bounded by the 
Eddlestone or Peebles water. The New town, with the exception 
of a few paltry houses on the south side of the Tweed, lies in a 
peninsula formed by that river and the Eddlestone water. This 
water runs in almost an opposite direction to the Tweed, and falls 
into it, contrary to the course of most rivers, forming an acute angle, 
with the apex pointing up the stream. The New town presents the 
strange anomaly of being bounded on the south by a river running 
due east, and on the north by another river running due west. 

The burgh of Peebles, till the passing of the bill which altered 
the representative system, joined with Selkirk, Linlithgow and 
Lanark, in returning a member of Parliament. It was then thrown 
into the county. The town-council consists of a provost, two bai- 
lies, a dean of guild and treasurer, with twelve councillors. Ihe 
number of electors amounts to about 94. The revenues of the 
burgh amount to about L. 643, from the following sources. :

The amount of debt in October 1833 was L. 5426, 2s. 5d. The 
income at present is more tban sufficient for all expenses, and even 
for discharging part of the debt. The town is very well supplied 
with water, and lighted with gas from the burgh funds. The 
weekly market for grain in bulk has within these few years been 
revived, and the magistrates, with a becoming liberality to encou- 
age the farmers to bring their grain, make no demand for customs 
oads and ,-From the excellence of the materials of

which they are made, the roads in Tweeddale are generally very 
good, hut too narrow, and in a hilly country where precipices are 
so common, the want of parapets is greatly felt, and adds to the 
danger of travelling by night. It is not known when the bridge 
across the Tweed at Peebles was built. As the style of architec- 
ture in the different arches and piers is not the same, it was pro- 
bably built at different times.  It consists of five arches in the 
channel of the river, and three small arches on dry ground, for 
carrying off the water when the Tweed overflows its banks. The 
bridge is inconveniently narrow, being only eight feet wide, admit- 
ting only one carriage at a time, but it will probably be widened 
in the course of next summer, as an act of Parliament has been ob- 
tained for that purpose. An iron bridge for foot-passengers was 
thrown across the Tweed a little below Peebles, where it is 108 
feet wide, by Sir John Hay, about sixteen years ago, to connect 
his pleasure grounds, which lie on both sides of the river. It is a 
light handsome structure, and, though much exposed to violent 
winds, it is as perfect as when it was built. A survey was made 
several years ago by Mr Telford, for the purpose of forming an 
iron rail-road between Glasgow and Berwick, but the design was 
abandoned. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church was built in 1784, and 
stands at the west end of the High Street, on a small eminence, on 
which the castle of Peebles formerly stood. It is a substantial edifice, 
built of dark-coloured whinstone, and if a little more architectural 
taste had been shown, it would have been very ornamental to the 
High Street. In imitation of Catholic and Episcopal churches, it is 
placed due east and west instead of fronting the High Street, which 
runs a few points north-east and south-west. The massive steeple 
which, by being built inside the church, destroys the uniformity of the 
gallery, should have been placed outside of the church, and flank- 
ed with a few pillars. The seats in the body of the church, by 
running across instead of lengthways, make the audience sit with 
their side to the pulpit. Being built on a gravelly mound, and the 
whole of the workmanship being of the best order, the church is 
extremely comfortable for the audience, and this comfort has been 
still farther increased by a stove having been introduced two years ago. 

The stipend, which was augmented in 1821, consists of 139 bolls, 1 
peck of oatmeal, and the same quantity of barley, paid according to 
the highest rate of fiar prices in the county, and L.39, 19s. surrendered

teind in money. In this is included the sura of L. 1 0 for communion 
elements. The amount of stipend varies from L.250 to L.400 a-year, 
according to the fiars prices. The teinds are so nearly exhausted, 
that no farther augmentation can take place. According to Penne- 
cuik, the annual value of the living of Peebles was 6000 merks, 
communibus annis, but to this was attached the rectory of Manor.  
At the revolution in 1688, on the final establishment of the Pres- 
byterian Religion, when a valuation was made of the different liv- 
ings, in the Presbytery Records it is stated, that the minister of 
Manor declared, " that his paroch being a pendicle of Peebles, he 
was presented with the small vicceradge of the paroch, for the pay- 
ment whereof, he had his localitie from the parson of Peebles. 
The parson of Peebles furnishes the communion elements." It is 
stated by Dr Dalgliesh, that at the reformation, " the patron of the 
parish assigned part of the vicarage tithes of Peebles to the mas- 
ter of the grammar school." A vicar still exists in the parish who 
draws between L. 17 and L. 18 a-year, from the small tithes, but has 
no connexion with the grammar-school, nor any ecclesiastical esta- 
blishment, farther than precenting in church. This appointment 
is in the gift of the patron of the parish. 

The old part of the manse was built in 1770, and a front was 
added to it in 1812, giving four additional rooms. It stands on 
the top of a steep bank, 22 feet above the surface of the Tweed, 
which washes the garden on the south. It is in excellent or- 
der and in every respect is a very desirable residence. The 
glebe consists of 6£ English acres, of which about three quar- 
ters of an acre are meadow, and the rest arable, and of excellent 
quality When the addition was made to the manse, upwards of 
an acre of meadow land was excambed from the glebe, for a piece 
of ground which lay adjoining to the garden of the manse. The 
Earl of Wemyss, who succeeded to the title and estates of the Earl 
of March, on the death of the Duke of Queensberry, is patron of 

the parish. . 

There are four dissenting places of worship in the burgh ; two 
ofthe Associate Synod, one of which formerly belonged to the 
Antiburgher communion ; one of the Relief ; and one Episco- 
pal That which belonged to the Antiburghers is now vacant, 
the last two clergymen having gone to America; but another is 
on the eve of being settled. The stipend is to be L. 65 a-year, 
with a house and garden. The other Associate Synod congrega- 
tion pay their minister L. 130 a-year, including communion ele-

merits, besides a house and garden. The minister informs me that 
his charge extends to no less than nine parishes. The clergyman 
of the Episcopal communion had from the beginning of his labours 
in 1828, L. 70 a-year, but a reduction of L. 20 being proposed, he 
resigned his charge at Whitsunday last. Another has lately been 
appointed. Of the Relief congregation, I cannot give any accu- 
rate account. , 

The total number of families attending the Established church 
is about 232; of families attending the chapels of dissenters, 108.' 

Education. — There are two teachers who are appointed by the 
magistrates, and have salaries from the burgh funds. The master 
of the grammar-school is allowed a good house for the accommo- 
dation of boarders, and L. 10 a-year of salary : from 16 scholars 
he receives L. 16 a-year. The boarders enter into a different cal- 
culation. The master of the English school has a salary of L. 28, 
and when the number of scholars is considerable, L. 10 additional 
for an assistant, but no house. His fees amount to betwixt L. 30 
and L. 40 a-year. His fees as session-clerk are somewhat under L. 10 
a-year. A female teacher is allowed L. 10 a-year by the burgh. 
The number of scholars attending the grammar-school is 18 day 
scholars, and 48 boarders, f In the three schools taught by fe- 
males, the number of scholars at present is 87, making in all, the 
number of scholars at the day schools 491. In this list, those attend- 
ing the evening classes are not included, as several of them are day- 
scholars. There is no parochial school, and considering the popu- 
lation of the parish, it may reasonably be inquired why provision 
is not made for such an establishment, as was done some years ago 
in Haddington and several other burghs. The grammar-school 
has long and deservedly been distinguished as a boarding establish- 
ment, and never more so than at present. There are no mortifi- 
cations nor any funds for the education of the poor, who are taught 
at the expense of the kirk-session. For several years a Sabbath 
evening school has been taught in each of the two meeting-houses 
belonging to the Associate Synod : this school, however, is not li- 
mited to the children of any particular congregation. The present 
incumbent in the beginning of last summer began a Sabbath even- 
ing school with three assistants, which promises to do much good.

Poor. — In a populous parish, where no compulsory assessment is 
levied, and where the management of the poor devolves on th 
kirk-session, few duties fall to a clergyman which require greater 
prudence, caution, and patient investigation, than the application of 
the poors funds. Most of my brethren will concur with me in stat- 
ing, that in the first two or three years of our incumbency, the per- 
sons who draw most freely from the session funds and the minister's 
purse are the least deserving objects, and it is only when taught by 
experience we become a little more discriminating in our charities. 

In the oldest session record, where any mention is made of the 
distribution of money to the poor, the receipts from 23d April 1662 
to 25th March 1663, were L. 62, 5s. Scots, and the disbursements 
L. 137, 8s. Scots ; and there was a debt due by the kirk-session of 
L. 232, 4s. From that date to the present time, there has been a 
number of regular poor on the list. In 1699, the sum of L.88 
Scots, and a few months afterwards L.95, were distributed among 
74 « clamant" poor. In 1733, the collection at the dispensation 
of the Sacrament was L. 91, 17s. Scots; and on that occasion, and 
on many others both before and after that date, the common beg- 
gars received nearly the same allowance as the regular poor. Eight 
years before that date, in 1725, there were 18 regular poor on the 
list, and 15 who occasionally received relief. And a meeting of 
the heritors and kirk-session " appoint that any of the said 33 
poor persons who shall apply to the minister, and shall be furnish- 
ed with certificates under his hand for charity, are to be served by 
the householders within the paroch, according to their several abi- 
lities, once a-week, and discharges the inhabitants of the paroch 
to serve any others." That we may compare the state of the 
poors' funds a hundred years ago with the present expenditure, it 
may be farther stated, that from July 1732 to August 1739, the 
receipts were L. 3156, 17s. Scots, and the disbursements L.3086, 
19s The maintenance of an, orphan child in 1733 was L.2 Ster- 
ling and 10s. for clothing; at present, the common allowance is 
2s 6d a-week. A coffin for a pauper, paid by the kirk-session, 
cost 4s Sterling. The average allowance to a regular pauper 
seems to have been 8d. a fortnight. For many years previous to 
1760 from L.60 to L.90 Scots was the collection made at the 
C nrriment • from that time till the end of the century, about 
T ft Sterling At present, the number of poor on the roll is 28; 
of these 7 ate men, and the remaining 21 women. The allowance 

• Session Records.

Varies from Is. to 3s. 6d. a- week. In the return made lately by 
the writer of this article to Parliament, the average allow- 
ance for 1832 was Is. 10|d. a-week. In addition to the above, 
there are 19 orphan children on the list, and one insane female 
lodged at the rate of L. 18 a-year. The whole annual expendi- 
ture, calculating for seven years, is L. 272. There has for some 
years been rather a reduction than an increase. No allowance is 
made to persons out of employment, if able to work ; but if, from 
bad health, they cannot earn a subsistence, parochial relief is given 
without the session taking any cognizance of their substance. A dif- 
ferent system prevails in England ; and the writer of this article has 
known the church-wardens dispose of a poor man's cow before they 
granted him relief in his illness; the consequence of which was, that 
no distinction being thus made between provident and improvident 
habits, he continued a pauper for life. 

The poor are supported by the collections at the church doors, 
averaging L. 62 a-year, — by the interest of L. 700, — by mortcloth 
money, and the voluntary contribution of the heritors, paid accord- 
ing to the valuation of their lands. Though they contribute about 
two-thirds of the whole money expended on the poor, and though 
only three paupers belong to the landward part of the parish, the 
moderator of the kirk-session, at the half yearly meetings, has only 
to state how much money is required, and it is cheerfully granted, 
with the exception of one individual, whose contribution would be 
about L. 2 a-year, but who has long refused to pay. f 

" In this sum are included clothing and education for several of the children, the 

salariesof the treasurer and kirk officer,— the fees of the synod and presbytery clerks, &amp;c. 

f The most objectionable part of the present system of managing the poor is the 
law of settlement, the bad effects of which are forcibly experienced in this parish. 
With the exception of two or three small villages, there is no other place than the 
county town to which a labouring man can resort, when, by reason of bodily infir- 
mities or advancing old age, he is not equal to the duties of an able-bodied man. As 
there are no supernumerary cottages in the country parishes, he must give up his 
house to his successor, and betake himself to the burgh, where lodgings of all descrip- 
tions can be procured. If he can struggle on for three years by jobbing, working on 
the public roads, or by living on the savings of his industry, without applying for re- 
lief to the parish in which his best years were spent, and which was benefited by his 
labour, when he can work no longer, or his means are exhausted, a settlement for 
himself, or, in the event of his death, for his widow, is thus obtained in this parish. 
VVe are thus burdened not with the poor either of the town or the landward part of 
the parish, but by many from all the neighbouring country parishes. This was an evil 
so much felt so far back as 1749, that « the session, considering that there are several 
poor old people come into this place and parish who likely will prove burdensome to the 
poors box, and who are not clothed with sufficient testimonials, do therefore appoint 
the elders in their several bounds to take strict notice of such, and apply to the magis- 
trates tor their concurrence to remove them out of the place, unless they produce suf- 
ficient testimonials from their respective parishes to which they belong, and from 
whence they come, that they are willing to receive them back as soon as they prove 
troublesome and burdensome to this place."f The resolutions and enactments of the 

f Session Record.

In the application of money to the poor, it may be mentioned, 
that the collections made at the administration of the Lord's Sup- 
per, now twice a-year, amounting to about L. 15 or L. 16, are given, 
not as in former times, doubling the fortnight's allowance, to the 
regular paupers, but are disposed of by giving two-thirds of the col- 
lections to communicants at the sacrament, who are not on the 
poors' list, and the remainder to the regular poor who are mem- 
bers of the church. 

In treating of the poors' laws, it is not unusual to prognosticate 
that Scotland will soon be in the same condition as England. No 
opinion can be more erroneous, as no Scotch act of Parliament bears 
any resemblance to the 43d of Elizabeth, as it is now interpreted and 
acted upon. The poor in Scotland are under the management of 
the heritors and kirk-session ; in England, a magistrate in a distant 
part of the county can award what relief he thinks necessary, with- 
out knowing the merits of the case, till the Quarter Sessions are held. 

If the funds of the poor are administered with a steady and ju- 
dicious hand, there is no great prospect of any considerable increase 
of expenditure, unless the population should be greatly augmented. 
The utmost caution, however, should be observed in admitting poor 
persons on the permanent roll, for then it is almost impossible to 
strike them off. All donations or legacies left to the poor of any 
parish ought to be strictly applied to them, and not given indiscri- 
minately to new incomers who have not gained a settlement, or to 
paupers belonging to other parishes. To extend such charities 
equally to all, is to hold out a premium and encouragement for the 
poor to settle in places to which they do not belong, and to consume 
those resources which should be applied to the native population. 

Inns, c— The number of inns in the burgh is 6, of taverns 7, 
and of grocers' shops where spirits are sold, 17. There are 3 
breweries. The reduction of the duties on whisky was defended 
by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, on the plea of underselling 
the smuggler, and thus putting a stop to illicit distillation. It 
may reasonably be questioned if the country has gained by the 
change in the excise laws. No doubt, smuggling supported a law- 
less race of men who set order and good government at defiance ; 
but it ought to be remembered that illicit distillation was confined 

kirk session were excellent, but unfortunately neither the magistrates of this burgh 
nor any' other magistrates can enforce them. The grievance is severely felt, but we 
rnot remedy it A legislative enactment that would extend the law of settlement 
to five o father to sevefconsecutive years of residence, would con lev a great benefil 
on towns surrounded by parishes where the work of depopulation is going forward, 
and would thus in a great measure equalize the burden of supporting the poor.

to certain districts, and its demoralizing influence was not gene- 
rally felt. Cheap whisky, from the licensed distiller, is vended 
through the tohole country, and many districts, formerly strangers 
to the small still, and distinguished for the order and sobriety of 
the inhabitants, now suffer from its baneful effects. Private vices 
have, in the fullest sense of the word, been made for the time to 
produce, not public benefits, but an increased revenue, as if any 
state could be benefited by the corruption and moral degradation 
of its inhabitants. The consumption of whisky by the drunkard, 
may for a while swell the returns of the excise, but eventually, the 
prosperity and the welfare of the country must suffer from his un- 
productive labour. 

Banks. — A branch of the British Linen Company's Bank was 
established some years ago in the burgh. There are two friendly 
societies, — a savings' bank, — a curling and coursing club. The 
royal archers occasionally visit the place. Poaching is very little 
known. Salmon are killed at all seasons when found in the river ; 
but unless an information is lodged with the sheriff-substitute or 
the justices of the peace, no notice is taken of the trespassers in 
close time. The leistering of salmon may be considered a kind 
of amusement, requiring much skill and address, and affords a 
good recreation for those of sedentary habits; and so far from lead- 
ing, like poaching in game, to corruption of morals, many who en- 
gage in it, are as respectable and well-behaved young men as the 
burgh contains. 

Fairs. — The charter granted by James the Sixth, confirmed to 
the burgesses the right of holding " three free fairs thrice in the 
year," two of which were to be continued for the space of forty- 
eight hours, and the third to last no less than eight days, " ac- 
cording to use and wont." Four fairs are now held annually for 
hiring servants, and the sale of cattle and sheep, but one day is 
found quite sufficient for transacting all the business of each fair. 

Fuel. — There is very little peat-moss in the parish, and coals 
form the chief article of fuel. They are brought from Mid-Lo- 
thian, and cost about 8d. or 9d. the cwt. 

Prison. — A list of the commitments for the last six years was 
prepared ; but as many of these were for offences of a trifling na- 
ture, such as being a vagrant, and suffering one night's confine- 
ment, it is unnecessary to swell these pages with the detail. The 
average number of commitments for the county for the last six 
years amount to about 28 a-year.

Boundaries.— -The parish of Innerleithen isof atriangular figure, 
the base of which rests on the river Tweed, while the opposite 
angle falls on that ridge of mountains which bounds the prospect 
from Edinburgh, towards the south, and is well known by the 
name of the Morfoot Hills. It here meets the parishes of Ed- 
dlestone and Temple, and were lines drawn from this point, to 
form the other two sides, one of these would fall upon the Tweed 
to the west, two miles below Peebles, and the other, where it meets 
the parish of Stow on the east, five miles above the junction of the 
river Ettrick. The parish contains, according to Armstrong, only 
27,587 English acres. 

Topographical Appearances. — The group of mountains in this 
parish forms part of that chain which runs from south-west to north- 
east, through the pastoral districts of the south of Scotland, until it 
sink's into the German sea, near St Abb's Head. The highest sum- 
mits of this range are found where Tweeddale and Annandale meet 
Selkirkshire,— Hartfell, White Coomb, and Loch Craig, being 
2800 feet above the sea. The parish is intersected by several 
deep glens, each traversed by its crystal rivulet, tending towards 
the main river. The largest of. these rivulets is called Leithen 
Water, and gives its name to the parish. The only level ground in 
the parish is the alluvial land along the banks of the river,— which 
in Scotland is called holm or haugh. This being formed during the 
course of centuries, by the overflowings of the river, is of a very 
rich soil, though in general more suited for permanent pasture 
than for tillage. The same kind of land to a lesser extent may 
likewise be found upon the Leithen for three or four miles above 
its junction with the Tweed. A narrow border of gravelly loam 
likewise skirts the foot of the hills. The valley of the Tweed in 
Peebles-shire, like most of the upland valleys m Scotland, having 
been originally a chain of lochs, the soil consists of rounded and 



INNERLEITHEN. 



25 



water-worn gravel, with the addition of the soil, which in process of 
time has fallen from the acclivities above. A great portion of these 
slopes has been cultivated, and probably was the first land cultivat- 
ed by the aboriginal inhabitants, — what was formerly called croft 
land, being of this description. 

Meteorology. — The clouds, surcharged with vapour, take the'same 
course as the great valley of the Tweed, which here runs from south- 
west to north-east; and during summer, many showers that would 
be highly favourable to our gravelly soils, and steep hill sides, fall 
on the mountains and the heads of the glens, while there is little 
or no rain in the intermediate valley. It is partly from this cause, 
and partly from the open nature of the subsoil, that our arable ground 
suffers so often from drought, that it is commonly said Innerleithen 
and Caberstone would require a shower every day. The south- 
west winds often blow with great force, and, from a certain point be- 
tween west and south-west, the wind has sometimes the violence of 
a tornado. There is a hill above the farm of William's Lea, com- 
posed of schistus, where the wind has been known to lift the slaty 
fragments, making them clatter fearfully in the air, as they came in 
contact with one another; and once, it is said, during a snow storm, a 
quantity of stones, some nearly half a ton in weight, were found 
scattered and dispersed over a space of a quarter of a mile. If 
this report be true, the phenomenon was probably the result of elec- 
trical agency. 

Experience has shewn that rain may be expected, of longer or 
shorter continuance, about the 20th of June, the second week of 
August, and the middle of October. There is generally about ten 
days of dry fine weather in February, and ten days of cold dry east 
wind in the month of May. On the last two days of May, or the first 
two of June, it has been observed that there is either a gale of wind 
or frost. Three years out of four there is a severe frost, so late as 
greatly to hurt the apple blossom, and the more tender sorts of 
stone-fruit. In some seasons, however, and in favourable situations, 
peaches come to a good flavour on open walls. 

From the nature of the climate, it may be inferred, that in some 
seasons there are violent snow-storms. It has been well ascertain- 
ed, that the power a flock of sheep possesses of suffering hunger 
when the ground is covered with snow depends greatly upon their 
pasture in the preceding autumn, or more immediately upon the fat 
and tallow they may happen to carry at the time, the tallow and 
superabundant fat being absorbed by hunger, and appearing to serve 



2G PEEBLES-SHIRE. 

the same purpose to the sheep, in enabling them to bear the famine of 
a snowy winter, as the hump upon the back does to the camel, in 
empowering him to survive the still greater privations of the desert. 

Diseases.— On this head it may only be remarked, that, about 
sixty or seventy years ago, ague or intermittent fever was, during 
the easterly winds of spring, very common in habitations that were 
situated near the level of the haughs, along the river to the east- 
ward of the Leithen ; but, from a cause not satisfactorily ascertain- 
ed, it is now unknown. 

Hydrography— Springs. — The mineral spring at Innerleithen has 
become of late years greatly frequented. It was formerly called the 
Dow-well, from the circumstance, that, long before the healing virtues 
of the water were discovered, pigeons from the neighbouring coun- 
try resorted to it. Had it been known in ancient times as a medi- 
cinal water, without doubt the Roman Catholic clergy would have 
taken advantage of the fact, and dedicated it to some saint. 

The well springs from the base of the Lee-pen, and is about 200 
feet above the street of the village. The mountain appears to be 
composed of greywacke, clay-slate, and red felspar-porphyry. Ori- 
ginally the water issued at one spring, and that in no great quanti- 
ty. The ground about it was wet and miry, and on one side only 
there was a form or long bench, which was used by the aged and in- 
firm, who resorted to the hill. Its celebrity, however, increased, 
and a few years ago, Lord Traquair, the proprietor of the village, 
erected a neat and commodious building at the mineral spring, with 
a verandah in front, from which the water is served out to the visitors. 

In digging for the source of the spring that the water might be 
obtained as free as possible from any connection with the surface, 
it was found to branch into two streams of different strength. These 
were analysed in 1822 by Dr Fyfe, and a quart bottle of each was 
found to contain the following ingredients: 1st stream, 36 grains, 
viz. carbonate of magnesia, 5.3; muriate of lime, 9.5; muriate of 
soda, 21.2 = 36.— 2d stream, 60.6 grains, viz. carbonate of mag- 
nesia, 10.2; muriate of lime 19.4; muriate of soda, 31. = 60.6. 
The large quantity of carbonate of magnesia seven parts in 1 0,000 of 
water, renders it probable that it must contain a quantity of car- 
bonic acid sufficient to constitute an acidulous spring, in order 
to be capable of holding the earth in solution. These waters, 
which have now rendered Innerleithen a place of fashionable re- 
sort have long been celebrated for the cure of old wounds, dis- 
ease's of the eyes, and for relieving stomach and bilious complaints ; 



INNERLEITHEN. 



27 



though these effects are no doubt partly attributable to the pure 
air and dry climate of the situation. 

There is another well known spring in this parish, which proba- 
bly was famous long before that of Innerleithen was even known. 
It is situated among the hills near the boundary of Mid-Lothian. 
Before roads were made through the interior of the country, the 
ancient road from Ettrick forest, Eskdale, and Teviotdale, towards 
Edinburgh, was carried up the Leithen, entering the parish of 
Heriot moor, by a deep and narrow defile called the Dewar-Gill. 
The spring now referred to bursts from the foot of the mountain, 
and affords a supply of the purest water in extraordinary profusion. 

As there are few bogs  along the foot of our hills to serve as 
reservoirs for the rain, the water of our rivulets is of the most trans- 
parent purity. 

Geology. — The great range of mountains formerly alluded to, 
of which Innerleithen forms a part, belongs to the greywacke for- 
mation. The strata, which are of greyicacke, greyioacke-slate, and 
clay-slate, range from S. W. to N. E., or nearly so. The dip is 
at various angles. Red and grey porphyries accompany the grey- 
wacke. They are of great thickness in some places ; and these at- 
tending rocks are found in different places, all the way from about 
a mile west of the village to Hollylee, four miles to the eastward. 

At Grieston, on the Traquair side of the Tweed, where a slate- 
quarry has been long wrought, beautiful red porphyry is found 
resting upon the slate. The mountain of Windlestrae-Law is cut 
by a glen on its south face called Priesthope, and the rock is laid 
bare for a considerable way. Here alternating strata of red and 
grey porphyry, gneiss, and granite, and flinty slate, are observed.f 
The grey porphyry is of a beautiful pure colour, mixed with many 
crystals of felspar, and of great hardness. The red porphyry is of 
all shades, from a brownish-yellow to a dark blood-red. The latter 
has often been sent to Edinburgh for curling-stones, as it is both 
extremely hard, and does not splinter, and takes a very fine polish. 

Querns, or ancient hand-mills, have been found ; and one, or 

• By this word is meant those tracts of moist clay and peaty soil formerly covered 
with tarwei and Juncus arHculattu, that skirt the green hills of Dumfries and Selkirk- 
shires, and which, before they were begun to be drained with care and attention, re- 
tained the rail water, and from which it gradually flowed into the burns and rivulets, 
supplying them with water, holding in solution much decayed animal and vege- 
table matter. The draining of these bogs has neither benefited the sheep nor the 
salmon fishery. 

f This stratified granite is mentioned by Professor Playfair in his illustrations of 
Mutton, as having been found by Sir James Hall and himself in Fasnet water, in the 
eastern declivity of the Lammcrmoor ridge ; and he mentions also that it was found 
at Loch-Ken in Galloway. Windlestrae-Law lies in the direction of the strata be 
tween these two places — Vide Edinburgh Enajd. Article Selkirkshire. 



28 PKEBLES-SHIRE. 

the remains of one, may still be seen in the neighbourhood, made 
of Aberdeen granite. Whether this may indicate that the Aber- 
donians of ancient times made a trade and profit of the stones on 
their moors, as at present, or whether it had been left by some re- 
treating army, it is not easy to determine. It appears that the 
upper stone of these simple corn-mills, which was turned by a 
wooden peg in a hole near the edge, was always formed of rough 
mica-slate. 

A quarry of large and thick slate, which was dressed for pave- 
ment, was once wrought at Hollylee ; but the particular sort that 
was in demand, instead of rising with the acclivity of the hill, sunk 
downwards, so that it became impossible to work it, unless by ac- 
tual mining. It was long, therefore, abandoned ; but of late the 
present proprietor has, with admirable effect, used it again, along 
with Arbroath stone, in making tessellated pavement for the lobby 
and principal passages in his house. 

A quarry of clay-slate for roofing was likewise wrought for many 
years below Thornylee, at the eastern boundary of the parish, but 
the workings were too near the river, so that there was a want of 
room for disposing of the tirring and refuse. Both slates and 
flags were moreover of inferior quality for pavement. 

The mixture of gravel, not much water-worn, with ferruginous 
clay, which is called till, and is found over all the country, but ne- 
ver above the most recent alluvial deposits, was hardly to have been 
expected in the valley of the Tweed, where it is nearly a mile in 
width. But in driving the large beams that support the wooden 
bridge lately erected below Traquair house, so much opposition 
was met with from impenetrable matter, as to induce the belief 
that at no greater depth than six feet there was a bed of till. 

There is a large accumulation of small rounded gravel and fine 
sand at the foot of the hill, called the Curlee. Some years ago a 
sand-pit was dug in it for the purpose of building and plastering. 
The sand appeared to have been deposited in layers, generally dis- 
tinctly marked, and having an irregular waving appearance, as sand 
often has when left by the ebbing of an eddy tide upon a beach. 
Among the various strata, there was one consisting of the debris of 
coal. °Taken altogether it distinctly indicates the agency of a- 
large and deep body of water flowing with a current down the val- 
ley of the Tweed, and probably meeting with another flowing down 
the valley of the Leithen. But there is no coal in the course of 
either. This coal-gravel, therefore, could have been brought by

the waters of neither of these rivers. In Lothian the coal lies deep, 
and does not appear in the banks of the rivers. In Clydesdale it 
often crops out, and the small fragments we speak of resemble 
more what is met with in the western district. 

Peat of a sufficient depth to be dug for fuel is found in great 
abundance around the sources of the Leithen, and in small extent 
on the top and southern declivities of Windlestrae-Law, which rises 
to the eastward of it ; but it is so distant from the village and the 
farm-houses along the Tweed, that they find coal, although brought 
twenty miles from Lothian, to be greatly cheaper. 

The tops of the higher mountains are covered with moss or 
peat of greater or less depth. On the ridges below the sum- 
mits, its depth is often only a few inches, and of course it is less' 
wet. On this there are tracts covered by Nardus stricta, Juncus 
squarrosus, and Galium saxatile. On the south-east side of Wind- 
lestrae-Law, among blocks of red porphyry, these plants are sin- 
gularly luxuriant, and they are mixed with a species of Agrostis and 
Anthoxanthum. Every part of the latter plant is likewise greatly 
larger than on the banks of the river 1800 feet below. These 
plants always indicate the mossy soil on which they grow to be 
mixed with sand. Here it is probably derived from the porphyry. 

Zoology. — In the year 1830, on the glen heads below the tract 
of sheep-pasture, we have noticed the larva of a species of the large 
long-legged Tipula devouring the herbage upon the hill sides, cut- 
ting the plants above the roots, and just before they assume the 
green colour. The swaird adhering together by the intermingled 
mosses could have been rolled up like blanket.

Parochial Registers.— The registers of the parish have been pre- 
served, and are legible from the year 1660. 

Antiquities.— The names of rivers and mountains, of slopes, 
burns, cleughs, and tower steads, in this parish are allowed to show 
that the inhabitants whom the present Gothic race drove out, spoke 
a dialect of the Celtic language, intermediate between that of the 
North Highlands and the Welsh, and that their successors retain- 
ed many of their names of remarkable objects.  

Porras-hill, or Purves-hill, is a farm-steading placed on a rising 
ground, where a number of remarkable terraces descend to near 
the level of the river, about 200 yards long. The present road 
occupies the line of the lowest but one of these ; three rise above 
it, all about eighteen feet broad. There is then a larger interval 
between the terraces, as if the upper series of them had been in- 
tended to be separated from the lower, but this space is not regu- 
lar, for it is much wider at the one end than the other. Above 
this there are other three terraces approaching towards the brow 
of the declivity on which they have been formed, but none of them 
so parallel as those below. We abstain from offering any conjec- 
ture as to the purposes of these works. 

Modern Buildings.— Several new houses have lately been built 
in the village for the accommodation of those who resort to the 
place for the benefit of the waters. The mansion-houses most 
worthy of notice in the parish are those of Mr Stewart of Glen 
Ormistone, and Mr Ballantyne of Hollylee. A beautiful wooden 
bridge was some time ago erected under the superintendence, and 
according to a plan, of Mr Jardine civil-engineer. It displays 
much scientific art in the design and execution. 

III. — Population. 
There are no documents by which we could form any estimate 
of the population before Dr Webster's report in 1755. The ear- 
liest parish registers give merely an account of marriages, and pro- 
bably only a part of these. 

The population in 1755, according to Dr Webster, was oo9

The increasing celebrity of the mineral spring may account for 
the progressive increase of the population; and this might be sup- 
posed to be the chief cause, had not the increase in the village been

only 59, while in the country it has been 141. The temporary 
lodgers in the village during summer are of course not included in 
the above state of the population. We are unable to assign any 
satisfactory reason for the increase, — the manufactory in the parish 
having employed more hands when the last account was written than 
it does at present, and the quantity of land in tillage being more 
now than it was then. 

The number of persons residing in the village at this time, not 
including summer lodgers, is 447 ; in the country, 363. 

It is important to add, that the number of lodgers in the village 
for the benefit of the waters in the course of the summer 1832 was 
no less than 1438.

Amusements of the People. — The people in this parish have been 
always much addicted to athletic exercises and games, which have 
probably been much encouraged by the dry soil and the climate, 
and by the beautiful village green. The latter, though considered 
as the common property of the village, has been appropriated, feued, 
and built upon. The fondness of the young men of the village for 
the sports of the place attracted the attention of the visitors, and 
induced them often to participate. The gay loungers at the water- 
ing-place came habitually to take an interest in the games; and in 
1827 forty-two noblemen, knights, and gentlemen joined in insti- 
tuting an annual competition for prizes in all gymnastic exercises ; 
an annual sum being subscribed for defraying the expenses. The 
records of the St Ronan's Club as it is called show that the young 
men of the village have carried off their share at least of the honours 
awarded.

acres. Yet, if we except two farms that have almost wholly been 
brought into regular cultivation within the last ten or fifteen years, 
there is not such a thing as an arable farm in the parish. They 
are all sheep-farms, with arable land attached to them. Thirty 
years ago, when they were let on lease, nothing was said about the 
value per acre : it was the sheep which the farm could contain that 
were valued. The number of acres which remain constantly in 
sheep-pasture is 25,700. The number of acres that are at present 
uninclosed sheep-pasture, and that might be cultivated, may per- 
haps amount to 1500, or somewhat more ; but whether any thing 
like this extent could, with a profitable application of capital, be 
added to the cultivated land, may be reasonably doubted. There 
are about 500 acres of planted wood; and probably 30 acres of 
brushwood, consisting of hazel and birch chiefly, intermixed with 
dwarfish specimens of the trees and shrubs enumerated as indige- 
nous. The trees generally planted now are larch, oak, ash, and elm. 

Bent of Land.— As the arable land in the parish is never let by 
the acre, the value of it is a somewhat difficult matter to settle. 
We are inclined to state the average rent at 23s. per acre, and the 
produce at L. 3, 9s. 6d. The average rent of the sheep-pasture 
is nearly 2s. 7 4 3 d. per acre; the average produce 4s. 8d. 

As the sheep-pasture has sometimes no arable ground attached 
to it, the value is more easily determined; the average of the un- 
cultivated land is nearly 4s. 3d. per sheep's grass; on cultivated 
land 9s. ; and an ox or cow L. 3, 10s. 

Bate of Wages.— The wages of labour of a man throughout the 
year is Is. 8d. per day; and of a woman for hoeing turnips, hay- 
making, and barn-work in winter, lOd. 

Breeds of Live Stock.— The old breed of cattle in Tweeddale 
was light-bodied and long-legged, with rather long up-turned horns, 
and spotted brown, black, or white. About forty or fifty years ago 
this breed was greatly improved by the produce of an Alderney bul 
and two queys, that were brought into the country by the late Earl 
of Traquair. Of late years, well-bred bulls from Northumberland 
are annually procured by some of the principal farmers; and con- 
sequently, allowing for the bareness of our pasture, the breed of 
cattle is every year drawing nearer to that of the shires of Selkirk 
and Roxburgh, and perhaps might be in some risk of becoming in 
ffeneral too heavy for the district. 

The breed of sheep is the black-faced and Cheviot, both greatly 



INNERLEITHEN. 33 

improved of late, excepting in the quality of the wool, which is 
now much coarser. 

It may be added, that the breeds of sheep, cattle, and horses 
have received great benefit from the Selkirkshire Pastoral Society, 
instituted by Lord Napier about ten years ago, and of which our 
resident proprietors and principal farmers are members. 

Quantity of Live Stock. — The number of cattle is 383; horses 
80; sheep, 16,040; goats, 50. 

Husbandry. — The state of farm-buildings and enclosures is good; 
and perhaps the extent of the former is greater than has ever yet 
been found quite necessary. Leases are of all sorts, according to 
the pleasure of the parties. 

Improvements. — The only great improvement in the parish has 
been effected by Mr Stewart of Ormiston, or Glen-Ormiston. By 
the most excellent system of cultivation, he has raised the value of 
his property, so that the annual return or rent in pounds Sterling 
is much more than double the valuation in pounds Scottish ; and 
that without including the annual value of more than 200 acres in 
very thriving plantations,— a fact very rarely paralleled in the re- 
cords of the agriculture of this country.

The value of the produce of cattle and horses is included, as pas- 
ture, turnips, hay ; and those are all valued per acre. 

Manufactures. — A large building for a woollen manufactory was 
erected about forty years ago by a Mr Brodie, a native of Traquair. 
He carried on the works at his own risk for several years. At his 
death the manufactory was let, and has since been in the hands of 
several tenants. At present 50 people are employed in it, and 
2500 stones of wool are wrought in it yearly. The people work 
ten hours a-day. Weavers are paid per week, 14s. ; slubbers, 14s. ; 
piecers, 3s. ; shawl-plaiters, 4s.

nearest market-town, and is distant about six miles. In the summer 
season there is a one-horse chaise daily, and two daily coaches 
from the parish to Edinburgh. 

The length of the toll-road down the Tweed is ten miles ; and 
from Tweed to the source of the Leithen, is above nine miles. In 
summer, there is a daily conveyance to and from Glasgow and Kelso, 
which passes through the village. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church could not well be better si- 
tuate for the convenience of the whole parish. It is a neat small 
building, containing seats for above 350 people. It was built in 
1786, and is in comfortable repair. The manse was built about 
1780. The glebe consists of 12 imperial acres, and is worth about 
L. 20 of yearly rent. The stipend is 15 chalders, half meal and 
half barley, and L. 100 Scots for communion elements, having been 
augmented in the year 1821. Its average amount for the last 
seven years has been, exclusive of the allowance for communion 
elements, L. 234, 6s. The average number of communicants is 
about 264. 

The dissenters in this parish are very few : fewer perhaps than 
in any parish of the same size in this part of the country. 

Education.— There is no school but one in the parish. It is 
parochial. The schoolmaster employs an assistant, and teaches 
the ordinary branches and Latin. His salary is the maximum. The 
school wages are, for reading English, per quarter, 2s. 6d.; for writ- 
ing, arithmetic, &amp;c. 3s. 6d. ; for Latin, 5s : but the actual amount 
received will probably not exceed L. 40. There are no persons in 
the parish above ten years of age who cannot read and write. 

Library.— There is a circulating library in the parish, and a 
reading-room attached to it. 

Friendly Society.— A friendly society was instituted in 1808 by 
the influence of the late Mr Nicol, minister of Traquair, and on 
such sound principles, that its funds have been gradually increas- 
ing. There are 100 members. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The collections in the church ave- 
rage about L.21, 10s. a-year, and the assessment upon the heri- 
tors and tenants amounts to about L. 80. The number of poor 
is 13, and the average allowance to each 2s. 2d. per week, besides 
house rent to several of them, and L. 5 for medical advice. The 
people have not now the same aversion as formerly to seek relief 
from those funds. 

• The stipend was augmented in 1821; but unexpectedly no in the same ratio 
as that of T minister ofTraquair.-which was augmented about the same Ume.

Inns. — There are three inns in the village ; two of them large 
and commodious, — each having an ordinary or public table during 
the spring and summer seasons. 

Fuel. — Except among the shepherds living in the heads of the 
hopes and glens, who use peats, the fuel chiefly depended upon by 
the inhabitants is coal from Lothian. The nearest is 16 miles 
distant. But a new road up the Leithen is now making, and will 
be completed next summer ; by which the conveyance of coal will 
be facilitated, and the expense diminished. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Plantations of spruce and Scottish fir in the uplands, for en- 
closures to the sheep, would be a great improvement. 

There is no soil in the parish so fitted for becoming rich pas- 
ture as the haughs in the valley of the Tweed. But instead of 
icater-dikes, as they are called, reared sometimes at great expense 
along the margin of the stream, perhaps it were better that every 
obstruction was removed from the river while in flood, and the 
muddy waters encouraged to float over and top-dress these lands 
when laid into pasture. Experience has often shown, that no pro- 
cess of manuring is so cheap and so enriching. Besides, this would 
enable the proprietor or tenant to bestow his attention and manure 
upon the accessible slopes of the hills, which, in course of time, it 
may be found worth while to cultivate.

PRESBYTERY OP PEEBLES, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND TWEEDDALE. 

THE REV. JAMES CAMPBELL, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, Sfc. — This parish lies on the south bank of 
the river Tweed, and on the eastern border of the county of Peebles, 
where it unites with the county of Selkirk. The ancient name of 
the parish, or rather perhaps of the church, was St. Bryde's ; hence 
it is supposed to have been erected by the Douglases of Black- 
house, in the neighbouring parish of Yarrow, and dedicated by them 
to their family saint. In 1674, the church and parish of Kailzie, 
Anglice, the wood, formerly spelled and still vulgarly pronounced 
Keila, was, through the instrumentality of the noble family of Tra- 
quair, who were the patrons of that parish, and of the Archbishop of 
Glasgow, in whose diocese Traquair lay, in spite of the strong op- 
position of the presbytery, and to the manifest disadvantage of the 
parish, suppressed; and about two-thirds of it, namely, all that lay 
south of the Tweed, were annexed to the church of St. Bryde's, — 
thus forming the present parish of Traquair. From two charters 
granted to the monks of Melrose, one by David I. and the other 
by Malcolm, both kings of Scotland, it would appear, that " all the 
fruits, and pasture, and timber of the forest of Traquair" were as- 
signed, among many others, for the support of that splendid and 
princely establishment. The word is variously spelled, Traquar 
and Trackwhare,\ and is considered to be a contraction for Strath 
or Track Quair; meaning, according to one, Sheep Strath; to 
others, the Strath of the Herons : and to a third, the Strath of the 
Winding Burn4 ' It must be allowed, however, that the strath, if 
it deserves the name, is very narrow ; although, when viewed from

a distance, and particularly from a station on the northern bank of 
the Tweed, it has the appearance of a considerable valley, — the 
hills rising very gradually, in comparison with the neighbouring 
mountains, from the mouth of the Quair along its banks, as far as 
visible from the station indicated ; and it may be taken as a pretty 
strong corroboration of this meaning of the prefix Tra, that farther 
up the stream, where the strath is much narrower, it is there called 
The Glen. 

The greatest length of the parish in a straight line from east to 
west is probably not quite eight miles, and its greatest breadth, 
being from north-east to south-west along the banks of the Quair, 
scarcely amounts to five miles. It is divided from the parish of 
Innerleithen on the north by the river Tweed ; it marches with the 
parish of Peebles on the west for about a mile; and on every other 
side is bounded by the parish of Yarrow or the Forest in Selkirk- 
shire. One narrow stripe of that parish and county, indeed, com- 
pletely divides the ancient parish of Kailzie from that of Traquair. 
Another point of it comes within 200 yards of the church, stretch- 
ing into the very centre of the parish, and reaching within a mile 
of the Tweed, its northern boundary; and a third point of the same 
parish very nearly cuts off the eastern wing of Traquair from its 
centre. On this account, the figure of the parish is wholly unde- 
finable, and its extent in square miles not easily computed. Ac- 
cording to Armstrong, it contains 17,290 acres, and may therefore 
extend to nearly 30 square miles. 

Topographical Appearances. — The surface of the parish is ge- 
nerally mountainous ; and being situated on the south bank of the 
Tweed, and its boundaries on every other side being almost inva- 
riably the highest ridge of these mountains, it consequently slopes 
downwards towards that river, and faces the north ; hence arises 
in some measure the heathy and dark colour of its surface. The 
valleys on the banks of the Tweed are not very extensive, and vary 
in elevation above the level of the sea from nearly 400 to about 500 
feet. The hills in general are steep and lumpish, but not rocky or 
precipitous, thus affording a dry and sound, but bare sheep-pasture ; 
wholly divested of caves or caverns, or any thing approaching to 
the wild or the picturesque, if we except Glendean's banks, « truly 
a frightful chasm," extending probably three quarters of a mile in 
length, and rising on either hand in noble precipices several hun- 
dred feet in elevation. Minchmoor is described as being " a large 
and spreading mountain 2285 feet above the sea's flow;" and 



38 



PEEBLES-SHIRE. 



Gumscleugh, one of the stations of the trigonometrical survey of 
Britain, is considered 200 feet higher. Both these mountains, 
Minchmoor, lying east, and Gumscleugh west of the church, are 
nearly equally divided between Traquair and Yarrow, the highest 
ridge, or " the shed of the waters," being the line of division be- 
tween the parishes. The church is generally said to be on the 
same level as the cross of Peebles, or about 500 feet in elevation. 

Meteorology. — As no regular accounts of the meteorology of 
this district have ever been kept, that point must be passed over 
with the remark, that the air of this parish is pure and keen, and 
hence very destructive to those subject to pulmonary complaints. 
It is, however, not very damp, — the higher mountains to the south 
and west, from whence the more prevailing and boisterous winds 
blow, sheltering it at once from their severity, and from those de- 
luges of rain which fall, especially in more westerly districts. Still, 
from the generally impervious nature of the subsoil, the damp aris- 
ing from evaporation is considerable. It may also be stated, that 
as the old parish of St. Bryde's, or, as the strath towards the mouth 
of the Quair is more familiarly termed, " the parishen," lies embo- 
somed among hills, it is equally free in general from the pier- 
cing cold and fogs of the easterly winds. The same remark ap- 
plies equally to both the other divisions of the parish to the east 
and west, and confirms generally an observation which has been 
made on this district, that the ends of the mountains point towards 
the Tweed, and their side's extend inland, if we may so express it, 
along the banks of the burns and waters that are its tributaries. 
Hence the appearance which all travellers notice in passing along 
the banks of that river in this district of Tweeddale, of its being 
almost continually land-locked ; hence, too, the extreme dimen- 
sions of the parish in a straight line give no adequate idea of the 
real distance of its boundaries to the traveller; and hence, finally, 
the generally snug situation of its farm-houses and hamlets, in the 
bosom of the straths or dells of its mountain streams, which fall 
in pretty nearly at right angles to the Tweed. Only two or three 
of the farm-houses of this parish stand on the promontory or end 
of the hills, and thus form as it were the connecting link between 
the contiguous straths. 

Hydrography. — This parish is remarkably devoid of any thing 
interesting under the head of hydrography. There is not a lake 
or cascade in its whole extent. It does not possess a single spring 
of any celebrity, if St. Bryde's Well, in the glebe, the Cheese

Well, on Minchmoor, and the Lady's Well, our Lady's Well  
on the estate of Kailzie, be excepted ; the waters of all which 
are pure and limpid, and equally fitted for household purposes. 
Why the first received the name, or was put under the protection 
of a saint, is not known, unless it was, that, being near the church, 
and on the side of a public road, the weary traveller, and the 
church-going population, might be reminded, on quenching their 
thirst at its fountain, of that " fountain which has been opened in 
Israel," and of that " stream that maketh glad the city of our 
God."  

Streams. — This parish is watered by some ten or a dozen streams, 
of which the Quair is the only one dignified by the name of The 
Water, as it alone has any thing like tributaries. Its whole course, 
however, is not above six miles ; but in that course it receives the 
waters of five or six small streams, two of which, namely, Glenga- 
ber or Fingland, and Glenlude, or New-halls burns, are each of 
them nearly equal to itself in size and length of course. Kirk- 
burn waters, the ancient parish of Kailzie, and the Bold and Plora 
burns have their source near the Cheese Well, and flow into the 
Tweed towards the eastern boundary of the parish. Fan Fawn  
burn, or, according to Dr Pennecuik, Taf-burn, divides in one 
part the parishes of Yarrow and Kailzie. 

Geology. — The most common rocks found in the parish are those 
generally called whin greywacke; some of a finer, and others of 
a coarser grain. A considerable quantity of slate also occurs; but 
only one small quarry of it is wrought, and it is now found to bear so 
ill the changes of the weather, that even the noble proprietor of it 
frequently uses slate from Wales for the purpose of roofing. A dike 
or vein of porphyry crosses the ridges of some of the hills in this 
and the neighbouring parishes, and is highly esteemed for the eur- 
ling-stones which it affords. Of the different ores mentioned in 
the former Statistical Account, no traces are now found ; and it 
is supposed by many that they had been brought hither either by 
the workmen employed, or that they were the remnants of ore that 
had been carried to this quarter to be smelted in the then " forest 
of Traquair." At all events, " the mines" have long been for- 
saken as worse than unprofitable. 

Zoology. — In the department of zoology, this parish appears to 
be rather more distinguished for the want of some species of the

sengers dropping into it a bit of cheese for the use of the fairies.

more common animals, than for its possession of those that arc 
more rare. " The largest kind of raven, and the true hunting 
hawk, still annually hatch their young in Glendean's banks ;" but 
the common magpie, and the far more interesting laverock or lark, 
are exceedingly scarce. The present writer has not observed above 
two or three pairs of the former in the space of thirteen years ; and 
has not been regaled above once or twice in the same time with 
the song of the latter. 

Botany. — The knout or cloud-berry is said to be the only plant 
at all rare observed in the parish. Our forests have disappeared, 
but the present proprietors are anxiously endeavouring to restore 
them in the form of plantations. Almost every sort of fir and of 
forest timber has been planted ; but it would appear as if, of the 
latter, the ash and beech, and, perhaps, the elm and plane, are 
the most congenial to the soil and climate. A few very favourable 
specimens of all these are now growing in the churchyard and im- 
mediate neighbourhood ; and there is, at least, one very fine tree 
of the silver fir species, in the grounds of Traquair House. " The 
bush aboon Traquair" is now reduced to four miserable birch trees; 
and such are the chances and changes of the times, that the field 
in which they grow, — the once famed scene of love and poetry, — 
is now very generally termed the hospital, from the circumstance 
of its having been reserved, at one time, as the field into which 
the ailing of the flock and of the herd were driven for pasture. 

II. — Civil History. 
Historical Notices. — " Mr Borthwick, in his Feudal Dignities, 
mentions Sarah of the Glen, Peebles-shire, amongst the ladies who 
swore allegiance to Edward I. of England in 1296." Tradition 
affirms that Captain Porteous, so celebrated for giving the name to 
the mob in Edinburgh in 1736, was born at Easter Glen, in this 
parish.  

Traquair House was the first place where the famous Marquis 
of Montrose rested the night after the battle of Philiphaugh. Hume 
the historian affirms that he had reason to expect the assistance of 
the then Earl of Traquair ; and tradition adds, that his Lordship 
mounted, on the morning of the day of the battle, the 13th Sep- 
tember 1645, — 'his blacksmith carrying a bag of gold for the use 
of the Marquis. In the meantime, before they reached the 

 It is said that Porteous, when a boy, having killed the favourite hen of an old 
woman who then resided on the neighbouring farm of fethan, she, in her wrath, 
" wUhei thai there might be as many folk at his death as there were feathers on her 
poor chucky."

camp, the battle was fought, and on descending Minchmoor 
into the lovely vale of Yarrow, they met the dragoons flying in 
all directions. Instead of taking the direct route back, they were 
forced, along- with the crowd, up the banks of the stream, and on 
passing the farm or castle of Tinnis, the blacksmith threw the bag 
of gold into the draw-well of the place. Often has the well been 
searched for the treasure, but as often in vain.  

Maps, fyc. — It is believed that each landed proprietor in the pa- 
rish has a separate map and plan of his own estate. A few paint- 
ings, and, we doubt not, many private documents, connected more 
especially with the history of the family, and of the Lord Treasurer 
of Scotland in particular, are to be found in the possession of the 
noble family of Traquair. 

Eminent Characters. — This Lord Treasurer, and Commissioner 
to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1639, is 
certainly the most eminent character connected with this parish; 
but as his life has long become matter of general history, it would 
be useless to do more than simply allude to it here. It may be ad- 
ded as a circumstance of merely local interest, that he cut a new 
course for the river Tweed for nearly two miles, to carry it away 
from under the battlements of his castle. 

Mr Brodie, ironmaster, late of Carey Street, London, of Calcut, 
in the county of Salop, and of Temple Bar, in this county, of whom 
honourable mention is made in the former Statistical Account, was 
a native of this parish. When he left Scotland, unlike most 
Scotsmen, he was very ill educated, and to his latest day could 
with difficulty sign his own name. He had only his " har'st fee," 
amounting to 17s. 6d. in his pocket, and the rudiments of his trade 
as blacksmith, with which to begin the world ; but by his own ge- 
nius, or, as some pretend, by purchasing from an Italian the plan of 
register-stoves, he accumulated a fortune of nearly half a million.

marble slab on the wall of the church, and a Bible which he pre- 
sented to the pulpit in 1777. He was a man of great respectability 
of character, anxious to do good in his native place, and he did so 
while he lived; but, either from his own defective education, or from 
calculating too securely on a longer life, he did nothing to keep up 
his remembrance among us after his death. It ought in justice to 
be added, that it is said he offered to send cast iron to Leith, free 
of all expense, with which to erect a bridge across the Tweed in 
this neighbourhood, but the offer, for some reason, was not ac- 
cepted. 

Land-owners. — The only land-owners in the parish are his 
Grace the Duke of Buccleuch, who possesses a small part of only 
one farm ; the Right Honourable the Earl of Traquair, to whom 
belong perhaps three-fourths of the whole parish ; and Miss Wil- 
liamson of Cardrona, Robert Nutter Campbell of Kailzie, and 
William Allan of the Glen, among whom the remainder is divided 
in portions nearly equal. The estates of Traquair and Cardrona 
have long been in the possession of the present families. That be- 
longing to the Duke of Buccleuch was purchased from an old fa- 
mily of the name of Cassie, above forty years ago. The other two 
estates, till about the same period, were more frequently in the 
market. It is most devoutly to be wished, however, and there is 
no prospect to the contrary at present, that no change among these 
proprietors may take place for a long time, as justice compels 
the declaration, that heritors more anxious for the good of the pa- 
rish and of their tenantry, in every sense of the word, cannot be 
found. Whatever is proposed to them for the comfort of the mi- 
nister, the schoolmaster, or the poor, or for promoting the spirit- 
ual and temporal interests of the people at large, is cheerfully 
carried into effect, whatever may be the expense. A few years 
ago they allowed the then schoolmaster, who had held that office 
for nearly sixty years, to retire on his full salary, and provided an 
additional one of L. 30 for an assistant. They erected one of the 
neatest and most comfortable school-rooms in the neighbourhood, 
surrounding it with a shrubbery ; they also erected coach-houses, 
stables, and private rooms for the accommodation of the church- 
going population; and when the present incumbent was entitled by 
law to apply for an augmentation of stipend, they appeared in Court 
pleading not against, but for the augmentation. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers reach back only 
to the Revolution; the Episcopalian clergyman, who was then de-

posed for drunkenness, and for acting as factor to a neighbouring 
proprietor, having refused to give up either them or the plate be- 
longing to the church. They are exceedingly defective, especially 
for the last sixty years. With regard to mere sessional records, it 
seems now to be pretty generally allowed, that except in very ag- 
gravated cases, or in those which must be brought before higher 
courts, it hardly consists with that " charity which rejoiceth not in 
iniquity," to record the name of every one who may have been 
" overtaken in a fault," and thus to set him up for ever on the pil- 
lory, as it were, to the scorn and laughter of future generations. 
As to the other records of the session, many are not only unwilling 
but unable to pay for the registering of births or marriages, from 
which they may never derive any benefit ; and certainly it would 
be harsh to compel the poor so to do, who have generally more 
than enough of indispensable outlay on such occasions. In the 
records of this parish, however, there are two or three cases of 
some interest mentioned, as showing the state of the times in for- 
mer ages, and especially after the revolution. There is the case of 
a woman in 1694 charged with having burnt the Bible, lest it 
should be a witness against her in the great day of accounts; ano- 
ther of a man in 1696 for having consulted " a wise man" in Car- 
rington parish, respecting some money which he said had been 
stolen from him ; and in a stray paper found in the parish, there 
is a very serious but amusing account given of the settlement of a 
minister in this parish before the restoration of patronage, by the 
interference of the principal heritor, a Catholic, with the elders 
who lived on his estate. And finally, a tradition is still prevalent, 
and it is confirmed in many points by the records of presbytery, of 
the miserable death of two women who had accused a minister of 
the parish of gross scandal, which induced him, though innocent, 
to give up his charge, that " the name of God and his doctrine 
might not be blasphemed." 

It may not be out of place here to remark, that this district was 
not much harassed during the dreadful times of the Covenant. " A 
conventicle" was on one occasion held at the Glen, partly that the

Laird Veitch might have a child baptized by one of the dusted 
ministers, and that he had to remain " in hiding" for some time 
on this account. Tradition says that he spent his nights in his 
own house, and his days in a very small cave, scarcely sufficient to 
cover his person, where he was at last betrayed by the barking of 
a favourite dog that had followed him to the place of his conceal- 
ment. 

Antiquities. — The only antiquities worth mentioning are the 
camps referred to in the former Statistical Account, no longer, how- 
ever, nor in the memory of the oldest inhabitant, ever called Ches- 
ters. The largest of these is above the present mansion-house of 
Cardrona, which word is said to mean " the camp or" castle on the 
ridge," and certainly a name more appropriate to its situation could 
not have been invented. A very handsome Roman pot of bronze 
was a few years ago found in forming a drain on the lands of 
Kailzie, and a small battle-axe was picked up on the same 
estate. Both are now in the possession of its proprietor. In 
the summer of 1831, while workmen were employed in widening 
and levelling the public road leading towards Innerleithen, they 
discovered, in a gravel knoll, about three feet from the surface, a 
sepulchre or grave formed of flat stones, evidently of the same kind 
as are still found on the neighbouring Minchmoor, and containing 
an urn apparently composed of baked clay mingled with peat, fil- 
led with ashes or very fine mould. Another urn of the same ma- 
terials was discovered a yard or two distant in the bare soil, but in- 
verted and covering the fragments of human bones. The whole 
was destroyed before the present writer heard of it, and all he could 
pick up was a small piece of one of the urns, which, he was told, 
were nearly of the form of the common garden flower-pot, but partly 
figured on the exterior by heights and grooves in the way of a pine 
apple. It is said that another sepulchre of the very same kind was 
dug up near the same spot many years ago. 

Modern Buildings. — In modern architecture there is nothing re- 
markable in the parish. Part of Traquair house is very ancient, 
but there is no record of its erection, see Chalmers. Two sub- 
stantial mansion-houses have been built since the last Statistical 
Account was written, — one at Kailzie and the other at the Glen. 
The church and manse are both most comfortable. The school- 
room and schoolmaster's house are equally so; and the farm-houses 
in the parish are now all large, modern, respectable, and excellent 

habitations. Even the cottages are generally good of their kind.

III. — Population. 
The population of this parish in ancient times must have been 
much greater than at present, as the sites of several villages, on 
which not a vestige of a house now remains, are still pointed out. 
In the records of the presbytery of Peebles, too, under date the 
5th August 1674, the number of communicants in the several pa- 
rishes of the presbytery is mentioned as the proportion by which 
these parishes were to contribute to the support of a bursar. In 
this record, Traquair is said to have had 360, and Kailzie, 100 ; 
two-thirds of which latter number now falling to be added to Tra- 
quair, would make the number of communicants in thifc parish about 
430, whereas now they do not amount to one-half of this number. 
Even deducting, then, for the number who have dissented from 
the church since those days, the population must have been not 
much less than double of what it is now. It has again, however, 
increased considerably since the date of the last Statistical Account, 
if there was no mistake in the enumeration there given, — partly 
owing to the regular residence of the families of Traquair and 
Kailzie, but principally to the universal introduction of the turnip 
husbandry. The following table will show the amount of the po- 
pulation at different times, as nearly as can be made up : 



In 1674, - 1000 

In 1755, - 651 

In 1794, - 446 

In 1801, - 613 

In 18,11, - 621 

In 1821, - 643 

In 1831, - 629 



In this parish, there is scarcely any thing deserving the name 
of a village. Excepting about twenty families of tradesmen and 
labourers, several of whom are bound to keep " bondagers " for 
their houses, the population is wholly rural, and live around the 
farm-steadings to which they are respectively attached. 

For the last seven years, the yearly average of births does not 
exceed 20 ; of deaths, 9 ; and of marriages, 6 individuals. 

The number of families in the parish is 108, whereof 68 are 
chiefly employed in agriculture, and 20 in trade, manufactures, and 
handicraft. 

There are no blind, deaf, or dumb persons in the parish; 1 
idiot ; 1 slightly fatuous ; and 1 or 2 that may be termed insane. 
The Earl of Traquair, and his sister, Lady Louisa Stuart, are 

 In the Government census of 1831, the population is given at 643, but in the 
official return the names of 14 persons were included who were only residents at the 
time, and not parishioners.

the only noble persons residing in the parish. Besides the heri- 
tors, Robert Nutter Campbell of Kailzie, Esq., William Allan of 
the Glen, and Captain James Ker of the Honourable East India 
Company's Service, heir-apparent to Cardrona, there are no other 
individuals or families in independent circumstances resident 
among us. 

Character and Habits of the People. — On this point we have no 
peculiarity to notice, except, perhaps, that our people have scarce- 
ly yet learned to accommodate themselves to the great change of 
the times since the close of the late war. There are not awant- 
ing families among us, however, whose tables are covered with a 
plentiful though homely fare, and whose children are never so ill 
clad as to make their parents ashamed of bringing them up to 
the house of God. It must be admitted that all this requires an 
industry and an economy on the part of both parents, which must 
never be relaxed, and perhaps, too, a little saving before marriage 
to set the parties up without debt, which is but far too seldom the 
case in these days of luxury and of vanity. The late war, with 
all its expenses and bloodshed, was, perhaps, not so disastrous to 
the country by its loss of treasure and of life, as by the habits of 
living its fictitious prosperity has entailed upon all, both rich and 
poor. To the boundless prosperity of the late war, followed by 
the reduction of income after the peace, may be ascribed much of 
the distress, immorality, and irreligion of the present day. No 
doubt these changes have been felt less among a rural population 
than among the manufacturing classes, but still even among us 
their effects are obvious. Wages are not now so high in propor- 
tion to the mode of living, as they were during that war ; employ- 
ment is not so steady; and neither proprietors nor farmers in ge- 
neral so able to afford either as formerly. At the same time, the 
old thrifty habits of domestic industry and economy in families 
have been forgotten ; by many, every thing is now bought with 
money, — the wheel being almost altogether laid aside, and nearly 
every article of raiment being now purchased instead of being made 
at home. The expensive articles of tea, coffee, and sugar, they 
can neither easily want nor easily procure. They become, there- 
fore, liable to feelings of discontent, which have, it may be fear- 
ed, injured the cause of true and vital godliness, and of brotherly 
kindness and charity in the hearts of many ; for while justice de- 
mands the admission that our people are generally intelligent, ge- 
nerous, and respectable in their station, it is doubtful if we can

add that they are equally religious. Poaching in salmon in close- 
time is much practised, having been long winked at by the land- 
holders, from the very small numbers of fish that find their way up 
the river at any other season. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Economy. 

The quantity of land in the parish under cultivation is fully 3000 imperial acres.

Rent of Land. — Arable land rents at from 12s. to L. 3 per 
acre; the average being probably about 17s. The rent of graz- 
ing an ox or cow may be about L. 3 ; and that of a ewe or full- 
grown sheep, 5s. 

The average real rental of the parish may be as under : 

3000 acres under cultivation, at 17s. - L. 2550 0 0 

6000 hill sheep, at 5s. - - . . 1500 0 0 

900 sheep fed in parks, at 10s. - . . 450 q q 

L. 4500 0 0 

Prices of Labour, and Implements of Husbandry. — The rate of 
ploughmen's wages per annum varies from L. 9 to L. 10, 10s. 
When married, and not living in the farm-house, they have as 
an allowance for bed and board, a dwelling-house, provision for 
a cow throughout the year, 52 stones old weight of oatmeal, 
one-half boll of seed-potatoes planted, and four cart loads of coals, 
about 64 cwt. driven, — they paying the coals at the pit, and the 
tolls on the road. The wages of women-servants connected with 
the farms may be stated at L. 4 in summer, and at L. 2 in win- 
ter. 

Enclosing and draining are now generally set by the piece ; 7s. 
per rood, of six yards, being considered a fair price for finishing 
dry stone dikes ; and 8d. per rood for cutting drains three feet 
deep, the farmer in general filling them up with stones, and cover- 
ing them in by his own servants. 

The average rate of mason and carpenters' wages is probably 
about 15s. per week in summer, and perhaps 12s. in winter. 

An excellent wooden plough, full mounted, may be made in the 
parish for L. 2, 10s., and a pair of harrows for L. 1, 8s. A close- 
bodied single-horse cart may cost L. 9 ; and other articles in pro- 
portion to the work employed on them. Excellent sheep-flakes 
of larch may be had for 2s. each. 



48 



PEEBLES-SHIRE. 



The iron plough has now become very common, and may cost 
from L. 3 to L. 4, 15s. 

Breeds of Live-Stock. — Considerable attention has been paid to 
the breed of cattle, sheep, and farm-horses. The cattle reared in 
the parish are generally of the Teeswater or short-horn kind, — 
sometimes crossed by the Ayrshire. Many now, however, buy their 
cattle, consisting both of the above breed, and of Highlanders, for 
feeding, rather than submit to the toil, risk, and expense of rear- 
ing them. Probably 130 are fed off for the market every year. 
They may average perhaps 44 stones, of 141b. each. 

The sheep stock is now almost exclusively of the Cheviot breed. 
They are not large, weighing perhaps on an average about 12lbs. 
per quarter when fat. Of these probably 1200 are fed off on tur- 
nips annually ; while 500 grit ewes are sold in spring ; 2300 lambs 
in autumn ; and still later in the season 300 full-grown sheep fed 
off on grass. 

The quantity of wool sold per annum may average about 230 
cwt. 

Husbandry. — On the whole it is not doubted but that the state 
of husbandry and improvement, from the duration of leases, ge- 
nerally averaging nineteen years, the excellent state of farm-build- 
ings and enclosures, the abundance of capital, and the en courses 
ment of landlords, has advanced, in this district, nearly to its 
ultimatum. The distance from lime and coal being from twenty 
to twenty-four miles, and the great elevation above the sea, ad- 
ded to the light nature of the soil itself, prevent the hope of much 
farther improvement. 

Produce. The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 

the parish may probably be nearly as follows : 

Grain of all kinds, 6000 bolls at L. 1, - - L- 6000 0 0- 

Potatoes and turnips, - - ~

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town and Means of Communication. — The nearest mar- 
ket-town is Peebles, at the distance of from three to ten miles 
from the different boundaries of the parish, or about seven from 
the parish church. This is also the post-town for the western 
district, while Innerleithen daily penny-post serves the centre and 
eastern division of the parish. The length of the turnpike roads m 
the parish is fifteen miles ; but as this parish is not a thoroughfare, 



TRAQUAIR. 



49 



and the population scanty, no mail or stage-coaches travel in it. The 
turnpike roads are now much improved — the bridges over the dif- 
ferent burns are good — and the timber bridge lately erected over 
the Tweed on the new line of road to Innerleithen and Edinburgh, 
by the patriotic exertions of the landholders in this and the neigh- 
bouring parish, has been a public benefit. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is situated as nearly as possi- 
ble in the very centre of the parish, as to its territorial bounda- 
ries, but fully a mile from the centre of the great mass of the 
population. Owing to the mountainous character of the parish, 
the public roads must invariably follow the course of its streams. 
Hence one line, leading from Peebles, runs along the banks of the 
Tweed from west to east for about twelve miles within the parish, 
and another of about three runs from north to south along the 
banks of the Quair and one of its tributaries. On this road the 
church stands, about six, five, and two miles from the different ends 
of the parish. The inhabitants on the estate of Kailzie, amount- 
ing nearly to a sixth part of the whole population of the parish, 
finding themselves on an average not much above three miles 
from Peebles, and six from their parish church, regularly go to 
Peebles to worship, either with the Establishment, if they can find 
seats, or, if not, among the dissenters ; and consequently, by the 
annexation of that part of the parish of Kailzie to Traquair, in- 
stead, as it ought to have been, to Peebles, if it was to be suppres- 
sed at all, a very large addition has been almost necessarily made 
to the ranks of the secession. Above all, the distance of the church 
from the centre of the great mass of the population is but too good 
an apology for its being seldom visited by children. 

There is, however, little chance of a change in the situation of 
the church, as it was built only in 1778, and floored with wood, 
and furnished with stoves, and made as comfortable as possible a 
few years ago. It is in excellent repair, fully capable of accom- 
modating the half of the population, and every seat in it free, al- 
though of course appropriated to the several farms into which the 
parish is divided. 

The manse was built in 1793 or 1794, and received a large ad- 
dition, and very extensive repairs in 1814. 

The glebe measures about 12 imperial acres, and might let for 
about L. 20 per annum. The stipend, modified in 1821, is 17 
chalders, half meal and half barley, with L. 8, 6s. 8d. of commun- 

PEEBLES. D

ion elements. The average amount of stipend, converted to mo- 
ney, for the last seven years, is L. 265, lis. 

The only place of worship in the parish besides the Established 
church is the private Roman Catholic chapel at Traquair House, 
which is under the bishop resident in Edinburgh. 

Probably three-fourths of the families in the parish are connect- 
ed with the Established church ; and the remaining fourth, after 
deducting five families of Roman Catholics, numbering thirty souls, 
belong to the United Secession and Relief bodies. A small pro- 
portion of these are natives. The Catholics consist of two Scotch 
families, two Irish, and one French. It deserves to be noted here, 
that although the children of Roman Catholics read the word of 
God, in the " Protestant version, and in a daily Bible class," 
nay, although most of them learn our catechisms, either volun- 
tarily, or by hearing them repeated by others, yet, in the memory 
of man, there has not been one conversion from Catholicism in 
this parish. 

Considering the distance of many of our people from their re- 
spective places of worship, we have pleasure in saying, that their 
attendance is generally good. The average number of communi- 
cants is rather under 200. In this part of the country almost every 
person as soon as he comes to a proper age, is most anxious to be- 
come a communicant. 

Collections are now annually made in the church for religious 
purposes, but principally for the General Assembly's Highland 
schools, and Indian missions. The probable average amount of 
such collections may be about L. 10 yearly. 

Education. — There is only one school in this parish, namely, 
the parochial. For the last sixty years, at least, no other branches 
of education could be learned in it besides reading, writing, and ac- 
counts. Whether the taste for any thing superior to these, now that 
they have the opportunity of acquiring it, may arise, time will show. 
There are perhaps not two individuals in the parish above the 
years of infancy, who cannot at least read ; were this otherwise, 
the people would be utterly inexcusable, seeing that the school 
fees are so small, being for reading, 2s. ; for reading and writing, 
2s. 6d. ; and for both, with accounts, 3s. per quarter ; and seeing 
also that these fees are always paid out of the poors' fund for those 
who declare themselves unable to pay. We need scarcely add, 

' Of late, ;i sewing-school has been opened ;t Cardrona. 



TRAQUAIR. 



51 



after what has been said of the liberality of our heritors, that the 
salary is the maximum ; and the parochial teacher has fully double 
the legal accommodations. The school-fees may amount perhaps 
on an average to L. 25 per annum. Owing to the great length of 
the parish in proportion to its breadth, many of the children can 
scarcely be expected to attend regularly, except perhaps for a short 
time in summer. Those in its western division find accommoda- 
tion in the schools of Peebles ; while a few families on its eastern 
borders are more destitute. 

A few years ago a small school library was founded in the parish ; 
at first it seemed to be very popular, but now it is very much ne- 
glected. The same thing may be said of a Sabbath evening 
school, or lecture, established principally for young people after 
having left school and gone to service, as also for the aged and in- 
firm, and mothers of infant children, who could not attend church 
in the forenoon, but which, owing to the gradual decay of attend- 
ance, has, in the meantime, been discontinued. 

Popular lectures on some of the more simple parts of science were 
delivered gratis in the school-room two winters ago, and called 
forth a very crowded audience. They may perhaps be resumed 
occasionally hereafter. 

Friendly Societies. — Many of our people are connected with se- 
veral of these, especially in Peebles ; and there is the Innerleithen 
and Traquair society of this kind, the funds of which are well ma- 
naged ; and the society is well supported. Some of the labouring 
classes, when unable to work from sickness, are entitled, we believe, 
to as much as 9s. a-week from these societies ; but it has been no- 
ticed by some, that many of the members of such societies very sel- 
dom put any thing into the poors' box on Sunday. We must add, 
however, that we are not aware that almost any of them have come 
upon the poors' roll, except perhaps when rendered totally un- 
able to work, by accident or by old age, and when the weekly 
emoluments furnished by such societies become very small ; these 
becoming less and less the longer the members continue unfit for 
work. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The average number of persons 
receiving regular parochial aid is 18. At present the number is 
25. They consist of 1 widower, and an old man unmarried ; 6 
widows, one of them having three children, and one old woman 
unmarried; 1 family, consisting of both parents and three child- 



52 



PEEBLES-SHIRE. 



ren ; and 8 orphans and illegitimate children, deserted by one or 
both parents. On an average, the old people receive for house 
rent, medical attendance, and maintenance, 2s. 6d. per week, or 
L. 6, 10s. per annum ; and the children about half of this sum, 
exclusive of the expense of their education, which has amounted 
for some years past, along with that of others not on the poors' 
roll, to nearly L. 10 per annum. 

The funds by which this expense is defrayed consist of four 
different kinds. 1st, Interest of mortified money, amounting to 
about L. 8. 2d, Collections in the church, averaging about L. 18. 
3c, A voluntary offering made by the heritors for fully fifty years 
past, and instituted long before any regular assessment was impos- 
ed, of L. 6. And 4th, An assessment borne in equal parts by 
both heritors and tenants of land. We do not take into account 
church dues, arising from the use of mortcloths, for these are very 
seldom paid ; and no fines for church censures are ever exacted. 
The regular assessment has been in operation since the beginning 
of the present century, and was commenced during the great scar- 
city and dearth of these days. For the last fifteen years it has 
amounted to L. 77 per annum on an average, so that not less than 
L. 100 or L. 110 a-year are regularly spent in this parish on the 
support of the poor ; altogether exclusive of the private charity of 
families in this parish, and of individuals connected with it. The 
effect of the assessments is undoubtedly to impair that old Scot- 
tish spirit which considered the seeking of parochial relief as de- 
grading. It ought to be stated, that it is the labourers in the 
parish, not the artisans, ploughmen, or shepherds that expect 
a share of these charities ; a proof of the advantage of having 
a fixed employment on which to depend for the means of sub- 
sistence. 

Alehouses.— There are two inns or alehouses in " the parishen." 
We cannot report that these have been sensibly injurious to the 
morals of the population. 

Fuel — The great scarcity and consequent expense of this article 
is the greatest disadvantage under which this parish lies. Till 
within these few years, coal from the county of Mid- Lothian cost 
here Is. 6d. per cwt., or L. 1, 10s. per ton, a price which was at- 
tended with great distress to the poorer classes. By the new line 
of road now making in the county of Edinburgh, in continuation of 
that lately made from the Tweed along the banks of the Leithen, 



TRAQUAIlt. 



53 



it is believed that we shall not be above fifteen or sixteen miles 
from coal; and that what now costs here from lOd. to 14d. per 
cwt., will, on an average, be reduced fully below the lowest of these 
two prices. 

Compression of Peat. — The time and attention required for 
the drying of peat has been the great objection to its more gene- 
ral use; and it is on this account chiefly that we consider the 
plan of compression lately introduced to the notice of the pub- 
lic as deserving of attention. The writer of this having made 
several experiments on the subject, feels confident in stating, 
that a very considerable quantity both of time and labour in the 
drying of peat may be saved by this process ; but it appears to 
him, that, unless some simple, effectual, and speedy plan of with- 
drawing the peat from the box after being compressed be employed, 
the value of the plan of compression will be, as to economy, almost 
completely neutralized. On this point he would simply throw out 
the following hints : 1st, The principle of the corking-machine, by 
which a perfectly perpendicular movement is communicated through 
the lever to the piston, or lid of the box in which the peat is to be 
compressed, is indispensable. 2d, The box itself ought to be firmly 
fixed to the platform on which it rests ; and, 3d, a false bottom 
perforated, of course, like the real bottom of the box, with an up- 
right rod of iron attached to each end of it, so formed as to tra- 
verse also perpendicularly in a groove in each end of the lid or 
piston, with a knob at the top of each rod, by which, when the 
lever is raised up, after compression, the peat might be withdrawn 
from the box, and then with ease and expedition removed off 
this false bottom by the hands of the person who builds up the 
compressed peat in the small stacks or " rickles." By this plan 
we think that two men, one to cut the peat, and the other to work 
the lever, with two, or at the most three women or boys to take the 
peat from the cutter, to place it carefully on the false bottom, to 
remove it when compressed, and to build it up in the heaps for 
Irving, would be quite sufficient for the whole process; and in this 
way we should suppose that the expense of the compressed peat 
would not be more than double of its cutting in the common 
way ; or when ready for carrying home, not more than that of 
common peat, because all the expense of " fitting" and " turn- 
fitting;" in a word, all the labour between cutting and carrying 
home is saved, and the whole work is done in one or more conti- 
nuous clays.

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since the last Statistical Account was drawn up, the whole sys- 
tem of agriculture in the parish has been changed, improved, and 
extended. The old Scottish plough is now entirely laid aside, and 
four horses are probably never seen yoked together in the field. 
Instead of " a small quantity of turnips being raised," they form a 
regular rotation in every farm. Instead of " 500 bolls of barley 
being exported," there is now at least double that quantity. In- 
stead of the wheat being " nothing equal to the consumption," that 
consumption is not only immensely enlarged, but a considerable 
overplus for sale is left. Instead of the small coarse-woolled black- 
faced breed of sheep, we have now the Cheviot. Instead of one 
resident heritor, we have four. Preparations are now going on for 
a very considerable extension of the plantations on the estates of 
The Glen and Cardrona. Every farm-steading in the parish has 
probably been rebuilt in the interval. It only remains to add, that 
the first water-meadows in Scotland were formed in this parish. Some 
of them are still irrigated regularly, and we have heard one farmer 
allege that they would amply repay the original cost, were he com- 
pelled by wet seasons to cart the grass they produce directly to the 
dunghill. 

Owing partly to the lightness of the soil, and partly to its having 
been so long in cultivation, the land in general is becoming ex- 
hausted. Much of it will no longer produce clover and rye-grass, 
the only grasses, we believe, that have been attempted to be rais- 
ed in this district, so as to be a remunerating crop, and some 
farms seem also to have begun to weary of turnip ; at all events, 
the disease known familiarly by the name of Jingers-and-toes has 
shown itself more or less in some of our fields. 

The writer, would propose, in the first place, that there ought 
to be an understanding, at the commencement of every lease, that 
if the tenant cultivate his farm properly, and pay his rent duly, it 
shall be in his own option to continue in the farm so long as he 
does so, on a rise or fall of rent corresponding to the fiars prices 
and to the times ; for it is known to every one, that, by the stimu- 
lus of lime, a tenant can " take every good quality out of the soil 
that is in it," by the termination of his lease, and yet not violate 
a single condition of the contract. Hence the desire the tenants 
all express that they should know whether they are to « flit " or 
not, even several years before the end of the lease. 



THAQUAIR.

Were this understanding- to become general, the farmer would 
be encouraged to give full attention to the procuring of foreign 
manure to make up for the loss sustained by the grain raised not 
being consumed on the farm. This, it is believed, might be ac- 
complished in a district such as this, by water-meadows, or simply 
by cutting, were it only for the dunghill, immense masses of ferns, 
heath, and above all " sprits," which are allowed to grow up and 
rot on the hills, and which, at best, only increase annually the 
quantity of peat bog. With the sprits, and even with the ferns, if 
cut green and well salted, they might winter in the straw yard an 
additional number of cattle, and thus add both to their purse and 
their dunghill, without deducting a single comfort from their sheep; 
nay, adding many, in the sweetness and variety of the young and 
tender grasses that would spring up. And again, let an inch, — 
more or less, — of new mould, nay, even of " till," be brought up 
at every rotation of turnip fallow, and well incorporated with the 
now rich old soil, and we venture to say, that the productive qua- 
lity of our fields will again return, and will soon repay all the ad- 
ditional benefit that had been heaped upon them.

PRESBYTERY OF PEEBLES, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND TWEEDDALE. 

THE REV. GEORGE BURNS, D.D. MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, fyc. — This parish having originally been at- 
tached to that of Drummelzier, appears to have been formerly cal- 
led Over-Drummelzier. As to the origin of its present name, which 
it has had at least since the year 1643, when it was erected into a 
new parish, it is only necessary to state, that the Tweed has its 
rise in this parish, and that a considerable proportion of the 
country, particularly beside the source of the river is in a re- 
markable degree distinguished by the bleakness and moorishness 
of its aspect. The mean length and breadth of the parish are 
nearly equal, and are not less than eight miles. It is thirty miles 
in circumference, and has been calculated to contain sixty-four square 
miles, or about 33,380 Scotch acres. But if allowance be made for 
the vast inequalities of ground, the extent may be fairly estimated 
as at least two-thirds more. 

The parish is bounded on the south by Moffat ; on the east by 
Megget ; on the west by Crawford ; and on the north by Drum- 
melzier. It is situated in the midst of that vast range of mountains 
which stretches into Scotland from Northumberland, advances to 
the head of Lanarkshire, passing through Selkirkshire and the 
northern boundary of Dumfries-shire, and terminates in the coun- 
ty of Ayr, thus forming a chain of connection between the east and 
west counties of the south of Scotland. 

Topographical Appearances. — The highest hills in the parish 
are Broadlaw on the north, and that part of Hartfell or Hartfield 
on the south, which comprehends its highest point of elevation. 
By an accurate calculation, made by order of Government, Broad- 
law was found to be 2741 feet above the sea level at low water, and 
Hartfell 2635, the former being the highest bill south of the Forth. 
From the summit of Broadlaw a prospect opens extensive and mag- 
nificent in the highest degree; for, while the eye passes over

mountain after mountain in apparently endless succession, like 
waves of a tumultuous sea, it rests not till it reaches the English 
border and the German ocean. It is worthy of remark, as regards 
this and most of the other hills in the parish, that they are of com- 
paratively easy ascent, and are flat as attic plains on the top. 
Many of the inhabitants of the parish are supplied with excellent 
peat from these lofty regions, which is brought down in common 
carts, drawn by horses with comparative ease and safety. And, 
what constitutes at once the ornament and the value of these moun- 
tains, is, that they are clothed in the finest verdure, even to the 
top, and produce an herbage so luxuriant in summer, as to admit of 
being mowed to an indefinite extent. The pasture which they 
afford for sheep and black-cattle is of the richest and most nutri- 
tious quality ; in proof of which, there is no part of this or any 
other country that produces flocks more healthy, or in higher re- 
pute in the English market. It may also be remarked, that these 
mountains have none of that Alpine boldness of contour by which 
the Grampians and most other hills of Caledonia are distinguish- 
ed. The flats and morasses of this district are comparatively few 
and inconsiderable. 

Meteorology. — It may be remarked under this head, that no ma- 
terial difference has been observed betwixt the weather here and 
at Edinburgh. Snow or rain in some instances has preceded that 
at Edinburgh by several hours ; and in the case of a fall of snow 
which happened in November 1831, it was found that it fell to a 
greater depth in the immediate vicinity of the metropolis, than 
even in this elevated region. From the situation of these moun- 
tains in relation to the eastern and western seas, storms of snow 
and rain frequently spend their force before reaching them ; and 
those who have lived long in the country give it as the result of 
their observation, that the sheep have seldom been denied their 
pasture for any length of time, in consequence of the depth or 
long continuance of the snow ; and that the loss of sheep or lambs 
from the severity of the weather has at no time been very consi- 
derable. The average quantity of rain that falls annually through- 
out the county does not exceed twenty-eight inches ; and hence it 
may be inferred that though showers are more frequent, yet that 
the actual quantum is not so great as in those counties which lie 
cast and west of Tweeddale. A book of meteorological observa- 
tions, kept by the late schoolmaster of this parish for several years 
previous to his death, exhibits the following results.

The prevailing winds in this quarter are S. and S. W. which 
most commonly bring rain, whereas snow is generally looked for 
from the N. and E. 

Small-pox and measles are the only infectious diseases known 
here, and have never appeared unless when imported. There are 
no epidemic or prevailing distempers. 

Within these few years, several persons have died at the ad- 
vanced ages of from 90 to 95 years ; and there are two individuals, 
a male and a female, at present enjoying vigorous old age at up- 
wards of fourscore. The average of deaths in the parish itself, 
does not exceed three or four per annum ; but as many persons are 
brought from other parishes for interment here, the number of 
burials in the course of a year is very considerable.

shaws, at the upper extremity of the parish, gives rise to the far- 
famed river Tweed, which runs ten miles through the parish, in a 
north-westerly direction, and, after pursuing a beautiful meander- 
ing course for ninety miles farther, loses itself in the German 
Ocean at Berwick. The source of the Tweed is half a mile from 
Lanarkshire, on the west, and the same distance from Dumfries- 
shire on the south, and it is not a little remarkable, that from the 
base of one and the same hill, the three celebrated rivers, Tweed, 
Annan, and Clyde, take their rise. It may with truth be said, that 
though the origin of the Tweed be humble, it is not lowly, as the 
spring whence it flows is fully 1500 feet above the sea's level. 
Almost innumerable are the tributary streams in this parish which 
the Tweed begins to receive from within two miles of its source, 
and which cause it to swell and to amplify as it rolls along. These 
have the names of waters and burns applied to them according to 
their relative degrees of magnitude or importance. The Core, 
Fruid, and Tala, three waters in this parish, run into the Tweed 
from the south-east. The first rises on the lands of Earlshaugh, 
and, after running three miles, falls into the Tweed a mile below 
Tweedshaws. The second has its origin three miles east from the 
source of the Core, and, after a course of seven miles, joins the 
Tweed a mile above the church. The third originates in a small 
spring half a mile west from Loch Skeen, and descends from the 
hills seven or eight miles, when it loses itself in the Tweed below 
the church, where a good stone bridge has been erected. There 
are in this parish nine burns, marked by the following names, viz. 
Tweedhope, Glencraigie, Badlieu, Old Fingland, Menzion, Glen- 
riska, Moat, Harestone, and Polmood. These all run in a north- 
easterly direction to the Tweed, in which they empty themselves. 
The only other of any consequence is Gameshope burn, which joins 
Tala water four miles above the spot where it mingles with the 
main river. These different streams, great and small, have an 
abundant supply of trout, par, and eels ; and in Tweed at spawn- 
ing time, which commences about the end of autumn, salmon of 
considerable size often fall victims to the snares of the poacher, 
which are commonly the light and the leister. At the bridge over 
Tweed is Carlow's Linn, a small but interesting water-fall, formed 
by the rocky bottom over which the river here passes. 

There is a lake in the parish worthy of notice, not on account 
of its extent, for it is only 586 yards in circumference, but ;i- 
being, perhaps, the highest sheet of water in the south of Scot-

land. It is called Gameshope Loch, and abounds in excellent 
trout, though, on account of the dark and mossy hue of the water, 
they are of a black colour. From what has now been stated, it 
may be inferred that this parish affords opportunities for fishing 
such as are seldom to be met with. It is accordingly much re°- 
sorted to in favourable seasons by the lovers of that sport from 
Edinburgh and other quarters. 

Every water, and almost every burn, has its range of hills and 
its valley, with scenery more or less beautiful, romantic, and inte- 
resting. There is high ground on both sides of the main river, 
and towards the lower extremity of the parish, the spots of culti- 
vation, and fringes of planting which adorn its banks and the adja- 
cent hills, give the whole an inland appearance, and cannot fail 
to please the eye of the tasteful observer. Near the top of Broad- 
law hill, there is a remarkably fine perennial spring called Geddes's 
Well, and from the Hartfell spa at the south skirt of that moun- 
tain, chalybeate waters are transported for the cure of many ulcer- 
ous disorders. 

Geology and Mineralogy. —In this parish, nothing has yet been 
discovered to gratify the professed geologist or mineralogist. 
Greywacke and greywacke-slate ichinstone of the peasantry, and 
some other lapideous strata belonging to the order of transition 
rocks, are to be found in abundance; but no secondary strata 
have been ascertained to exist, though, from the soft outline of 
these mountains, it might be supposed that sandstone could be 
found beneath the soil. It does not, however, appear that any at- 
tempt has been made by mining or otherwise to make geological 
discoveries or observations. In many places the soil is strong, be- 
ing a thick mould formed of earth and moss. The arable parts of 
the parish present a soil in general of a light loam, with gravel and 
sandstone at the bottom. 

Zoology. — The only rare animal that has been known to frequent 
this parish belongs to the feathered tribe, and is called Erne, or 
White-tailed Eagle, the young bird, the Sea Eagle, or Falco os- 
sifragus ; the old bird, the White-tailed Eagle, the Falco albi- 
cilla, which at one time used to hatch in an island in Loch 
Skeen, and to nestle among the clefts around Tala Linnfoots. 
So great were its ravages among the sheep, that every effort was 
made to extirpate it, and for many years past there has been rea- 
son to think that these efforts were successful. But in the course 
of the season just closed, it reappeared in the same as well as in 



TWEEDSMUIR. 



Gl 



other parts of the parish, and committed several depredations. It 
had well nigh carried off a shepherd's boy, but fortunately it was 
discovered hovering over its destined victim, and driven away just 
before it had pounced upon its prey. Under this head it would 
be unpardonable to omit the Jidus Achates, or shepherd's dog, 
whose docility, sagacity, and vast utility cannot be too highly ap- 
preciated. As occasion requires, and the shepherd issues the man- 
date, he either remains on permanent duty as a guard or watch 
over the flock when his master is necessarily engaged elsewhere, or 
he goes round the scattered sheep at a great distance and collects 
them, thus relieving the shepherd of the most arduous part of his 
labours, and accomplishing feats on these mountains which, with- 
out his dexterous management, could not perhaps be accomplished 
at all. Those of the true breed bring a high price, varying from 
L. 3 to L. 5, and even L. 6 Sterling. 

Botany. — The earliest spring food for the sheep in this district 
is the plant bearing a white cotton head, vulgarly called moss-crop, 
i. e. bog cotton, the Eriophorurn polystachion of Linnaeus. To 
this it is thought Ossian refers when he thus describes a certain 
beautiful female; " If on the heath she moved, her breast was 
whiter than the down of Cana, &amp;c." It begins to spring about Can- 
dlemas in propitious seasons, and grows in mossy ground. Draw- 
ling, the E. vaginatum of Linnaeus, succeeds it in March, and the 
sheep gently seize upon the part above ground. Heath is the last 
in order, and it being the practice to burn a part yearly, in order 
to secure a succession of it, the burnt or young part is first dis- 
cernible. 

Tradition as well as living authority informs us, that this country 
abounded in wood of a natural growth ; but, partly through the cu- 
pidity of proprietors in turning their timber into cash, regardless 
of the interest of their successors, and the beauty of the country, 
and partly through the increasing demand for mutton and broad- 
cloth, the hills are now denuded of their trees, and almost wholly 
devoted to pasture for sheep. Some old ash trees still remain at 
Fruid and Hawkshaw, and it is found that larch, birch, Scotch and 
silver fir, and poplars, agree best with the climate and soil of this 
elevated region. It is unfortunate that leases are not long enough 
to encourage tenants to plant trees to any extent, but it is grati- 
fying to be able to report that the Earl of Wemyss and Sir James 
Montgomery of Stanhope, Bart, have not been altogether inatten- 
tive to this object. In the course of a few years, the young and

thl lving- plantations around the onsteads at Crook and Harestone, 
belonging to the former proprietor, and at Nether Menzion, be- 
longing to the latter, cannot fail to add greatly to the beauty and 
comfort of the dwelling places. 

II. — Civil History. 

Accounts of the Parish. — Besides the former Statistical Account 
of the parish furnished to Sir John Sinclair by the Rev. J. Muschet, 
there is a more extended one in the Edinburgh Literary and Sta- 
tistical Magazine. It is understood to have been written by the 
Rev. James Gardner, last minister of the parish. 

Antiquities. — At the source of the Tweed, and where this pa- 
rish borders on Annandale, there is a spot called Tweeds-cross, 
where stood one of those erections so frequently to be met with on 
public roads in this kingdom before the Reformation, — probably 
placed as devotional land-marks to guide travellers from one mo- 
nastery to another. " Tweed's cross is generally thought to have 
been a place of Druidical worship to the sun, and it is more than 
probable that it afterwards became a mark of direction on so pre- 
carious a pass, as well as a terminate point of division between the 
shires." From its elevated site, 1632 feet above the level of the 
sea, it justly claims a pre-eminence over every other human erec- 
tion of the kind in the south of Scotland. 

Near Earlshaugh, in this vicinity, is a hill called the Crown of 
Scotland, for reasons now unknown. 

On the right side of the road leading towards the Bield Inn, is 
the shepherd's house of Badlieu, the property of Lord Forbes, and 
well known as the residence of Bertha, so celebrated for her beauty 
and her tragical fate. Grimus, King of Scotland, who had a 
hunting-seat at Polmood, was captivated by her charms, and the 
birth of a son was the consequence of an illicit connection between 
them. During the absence of the king, occasioned by an attempt 
on the part of the Danes to invade the northern frontiers of his 
kingdom, Bertha, her father, and her child were murdered by as- 
sassins employed by the queen. The queen did not long survive 
this act of barbarity. The king on his return caused the grave 
to be opened, and contemplated with mingled feelings of grief 
and horror the three mangled bodies. From that period he lost 

 In the immediate neighbourhood of this cross, during a severe snow storm in 
February 1831, the guard and driver of the mail coach to Edinburgh were compelled 
to leave the coach, and attempted to carry the letter-bags on their shoulders ; but un- 
fortunately having gone off the high road, they became exhausted, and sunk lifeless 
among the snows. They hung the bags upon a pole at the side of the mad. which is 
still marked Out to the passing traveller.

all relish for the joys of life, and soon afterwards died on the field 
of battle in the eighth year of his reign. 

On the opposite side of the Tweed, and close by the road leading 
from the church to Menzion house, there are the remains of a 
Druidical temple, or Pictish court of justice. Only one stone is 
left of a number similar in appearance and size which stood toge- 
ther, and which have been removed for the purposes of dike-build- 
ing, &amp;c. It is called the Standing-stone, and is five feet above 
the surface of the earth. From behind it, a person of diminutive 
stature, known by the name of Little John, discharged an arrow 
at the head of a freebooter of formidable dimensions who greatly 
annoyed the peaceful inhabitants, and who, though on the oppo- 
site side of the Tweed, was unable to elude the deadly stroke.  
A tumulus at the spot where he fell is still pointed out as the 
giant's grave ; and certain it is that sixteen years ago a labourer, 
in removing the stones of a cairn at the spot, found the grave of 
some ancient hero. " The sides of it," says the late incumbent 
of this parish, " were all regularly lined with smooth thin stones, 
and the top well covered with a large flag of full length." Frag- 
ments of an urn of strong earthen-ware were found within, a piece 
of which was brought to the minister at the time. 

About thirty years before this event, a grave of the same descrip- 
tion, and containing an urn, was found under a cairn upon Nether 
Oliver, the property of the Earl of Wemyss. Ancl at a later date, 
upon the lands of Menzion, there was found another grave, with side 
stones about six feet, and a covering stone two feet thick, and five in 
length. Over this monument there was no cairn or heap of smal- 
ler stones. At Fruid, Hawkshaw, and Oliver are vestiges of those 
ancient castles, towers, or strengths, of which the strath of Tweed 
from this part of Peebles-shire, down to Elibank Tower, and from 
thence to Berwick, exhibits so many relics. 

"The parish church stands upon an eminence resembling a Saxon 
moat, triangular in form, and thirty feet in height. It has some- 
times been called Quarter Knowe, and supposed to have been a 
place of Druidical worship. Forsyth in his Beauties of Scotland 
says, that " it is generally supposed to be an ancient tumulus, and 
is vulgarly called a Roman work." Some of the old inhabitants 
suppose that it is an elevation left by the confluence of the 
Tala and Tweed, which they say at one time overflowed the low

grounds now forming the glebe. A veil of mystery hangs over it 
which will probably never be dispelled ; but as it forms the parish 
burial ground, as well as the site of the church, an opportunity is 
afforded, every time a grave is opened on the higher parts of the 
eminence, of observing the vast accumulation of stones which at 
one time or other may have there been brought together by human 
hands. 

Family of Porteous. — Hawkshaw was formerly, and for upwards 
of 1000 years, the residence of the family of Porteous, allowed to 
have been the chief of the name ; and the armorial bearing of that 
family has for a motto, " Let the Hawk Shaw." Near the dwelling- 
house are faint vestiges of a chapel and burial-ground, where the 
sculptured head of a monk was found some time ago. 

Near Tala Moss, in the same neighbourhood, there is a spot 
near which a detachment of sixteen horsemen from Oliver Crom- 
well's camp at Biggar was surprised and barbarously murdered by 
Porteous of Hawkshaw. 

It is also reported that here at one time a number of predatory 
barbarians from the English border were attacked and killed by 
the inhabitants. 

Family of Fraser. — Oliver Castle was the paternal seat of the 
Frasers. " This noble and ancient family," says Nisbet, " were 
originally from France, and settled in Scotland so early as the reign 
of Achaius 794, 'coeval with Charlemagne. The posterity of this 
emigrant were Thanes of the Isle of Man, and afterwards in Tweed- 
dale, where they first assumed the name from the French straw- 
berry Frasses. In the reign of Malcolm IV., they possessed an im- 
mense tract of land in the south of Scotland, particularly in Tweed- 
dale, and were dignified with the power of High Sheriff of the 
county ; and in the reigns of Alexander II. and III., and during 
the minority of the queen, Sir Simon Frazer, lord of Oliver Castle, 
1292, with the heroism of a sound patriot, fought and defeated, 
with the assistance of Cummin and 10,000 Scots, a superior num- 
ber of Edward First's army, said to have been 30,000 strong, near 
Roslin, 27th February 1303. Buthe did not long enjoy these merit ed 
honours, for, like the renowned Sir William Wallace, he was put 
into the hands of Edward, and, like him, died a martyr to his coun- 
try's wrongs. His son being sent into exile in France, left his I wo 
sisters in possession of the estate, who soon after divided the land- 
in marriage with Fleming of Wigton, and Hay of Yester ; f but,

hearing- of the unexpected success of Robert Bruce, returned to 
claim his right, and to support that of his country. The king, 
however, on his remonstrance, finding the possessors in nowise wil- 
ling to relinquish so valuable a property, granted to him an equi- 
valent of lands in the north."  These noble families have now no 
interest in Tweeddale.  

There can be no doubt that the glens and mountains of this pa- 
rish were among the favourite haunts of our persecuted forefathers 
in the reign of Charles II. Donald's Cleugh, in Games-hope, is 
generally understood to have been so named from its being the re- 
treat of that sturdy adherent of the Covenant, Donald Cargill, after 
he had fled from his charge in the Barony church of Glasgow, in 
consequence of the violent persecution directed against the cove- 
nanters of the west, f 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners in this parish are the Earl 
of Wemyss and March, and Sir James Montgomery of Stanhope, 
Bart. 

Parochial Registers. — The parish registers commence in June 
1722, and have been kept with tolerable regularity.

Buchanan of Auchmar, in his inquiry into the genealogy of ancient Scots sir- 
names, says, " That great man Sir Simon Frazer, so famous in the reign of Robert 
L, was Lord of Tweeddale, and resided at Oliver Castle in that county;" and adds, 
that the Tweedies, now possessors of that castle and adjacent estate, are supposed 
to be descended from the ancient Frazers, now of Lovat and Saltoun." How the 
Tweedies became proprietors of Oliver Castle is variously conjectured, but it -is un- 
doubted that they resided at Drummelzier in James First's time, and were possessors 
of almost the whole lands from Neidpath Castle, near Peebles, the ancient property 

1  - S " °r thC 1 raSCrS ° f OHver Castle ' in this P"  is thought that 
Drummelzier was alienated from them about the latter end of James Fifth's time. 
Ihe site of the old castle of Oliver is still pointed out at a clump of trees on high 
pound opposite the manse, but on the other side of the river ; and contiguous to it 
is the present mansion-house, a plain substantial edifice, the occasional residence of 
Lawrence Tweedie, Esq. now Laird of Oliver. As to the origin of the Tweedies,

The decrease of population has been owing to the extension of 
farms. The whole property of the parish belongs to nine indivi- 
duals, only one of whom ranks as a resident heritor. There are 
only five or six individuals that can be called resident tenants. 

Character and Habits of the People.— The people in general live 
in comfort, and scarcely any are unable to lay in their mart for 
winter. Poaching prevails to a considerable extent both in game 
and salmon ; but, on the whole, the people are intelligent, moral, 
and religious. The shepherd's plaid is universally worn. 

At Tweedhopefoot, two miles north from Tweedshaws, there 
lived a well-known character in his day, called Jamie Welsh, and 
ironically nick-named the Bairn of Ttueedhopefoot, a perfect Milo 
in physical strength, huge in corporeal bulk, and having " a heart 
of oak" in respect of personal courage. His putting-stone is still 
shown, and it is a heavy lift for any ordinary man. It is said that 
he carried a load of meal 16 stones on his back all the way from 
Peebles, a distance of 24 miles, and only rested twice. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy.— The number of English acres 
actually under tillage and enclosure does not exceed 300. But it 
is impossible to calculate how much is arable, a great proportion 
of the mountains being quite capable of cultivation ; though, from 
the expense of lime and other causes, it is not considered an ob- 
ject to bring it into that state. Oats, barley, turnips, pease, pota- 
toes, and artificial grasses are the usual crops, and succeed well. 
The average return of grain is six bolls to one sown. There are no 
acres in undivided common ; and the number of those under wood 
does not exceed 25. 

Rent of Land.— The average rent of arable land per acre is 18s. 
The average rate of grazing is L. 3, 10s. per ox or cow, and 5s. 
per ewe or full-grown sheep pastured for the year. The valued 
rent of the parish stood thus in 1819 :

he does not receive victuals from his master. A very capable servant- 
woman gets at the rate of L. 6 per annum. Mechanics charge 
2s. 6d. per day with victuals, and 3s. without victuals. 

Shepherds.— That very useful class of men receive as wages 
45 sheep, which may be valued at 7s. each, 3 loads, or 6 bolls, 
of meal per annum, a cow, and dwelling-house, with a gar- 
den or potato plat. In some cases, where the charge is exten- 
sive, two or three milch cows are allowed; and if a shepherd has 
to employ a son, or any young man, as an assistant, a propor- 
tion of meal and sheep is granted for his wages and maintenance. 
Being more in the capacity of stewards or overseers than servants, 
our shepherds have much confidence reposed in them by their 
masters, or rather employers, and enjoy advantages and comforts 
corresponding to the importance of the station they occupy. They 
are seldom removed from their situation ; their fidelity insures it 
to them till old age unfits them for the discharge of its duties, and 
often it descends from father to son. 

Husbandry.— Smearing of sheep is universally practised, and tar 
and palm-oil forming a cheaper preparation, and no less efficacious 
than others that have been recommended, is now very generally 
used, though, to prevent the undue preponderance of the first 
named ingredient, many add a considerable proportion of butter 
and train-oil. Light stocking is carefully attended to, and ewe 
milking is almost entirely abandoned. At the great show of the 
Highland Society at Dumfries, Mr James Welsh of Earlshaugh, 
who is the present tenant of Carterhope, gained the highest pre- 
mium for black-faced, and Mr William Aitchison, present tenant 
of Menzion, for Cheviot. The former has for upwards of two 
years past tried the experiment of crossing the whole of Carter- 
hope ewes with the Leicester breed of tups, which is found to 
succeed well. The price obtained for 600 sold at Liverpool last 
year was 14s. 6d., which he considered a good return. 

In this parish there are 16,000 sheep, of which 9,000 are Che- 
viot or white-faced, and the remaining 7,000 are black faced. The 
former were introduced about thirty years ago, and, on account of 
the superior quality of the wool, are allowed to give the best return, 
especially when reared on land grassy and dry. But as the latter 
are generally supposed to be a hardier race, some give them the 
preference as best adapted for high, wet, and badly sheltered situa- 
tions, though the opinion of some of the most intelligent, judic ious, 
and experienced of our store-masters is decidedly against this notion. 



38 PEEBLES-SHIRE. 

About fifty years ago draining commenced in this parish on a 
large scale, and at a rough calculation not less than 80,000 roods 
have undergone that process. Catching of moles, building of stells 
or shelters for the sheep in stormy nights, and erecting march 
dikes or fences between different farms, are great improvements, 
and much has been done in these respects of late. The unce- 
mented or Galloway dike is preferred as a fence for sheep. The 
duration of leases for such farms as this parish contains is extreme- 
ly various, being 4, 6, 8, 14 to 19 years. The farm-houses are 
all slated and built of stone and lime, and most of them are two 
stories high. Several of the shepherds' houses are built of stone 
and lime, and covered with slate. 

The greatest obstacle to improvement is the distance of lime 
and extent of land carriage for all kinds of material. A single 
cart of lime when every thing is hired costs 13s. or 14s. 

Produce.— The average value of raw produce yearly raised in 
the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows : 

Oats at 14s. 6d. per boll, barley at 22s. per boll, and pease at 20s. 

per boll, the only grains cultivated m the parish, JJ J 

Potatoes at 5s. per boll, - 80 0 0 

Turnips at 50s. per acre, - 

Meadow hay at 4d. per stone, - ~ 

Cultivated do. at 6d. per stone, - -  

Wool at the present prices, not less than 18s. per stone, 2400 0 0 

L. 3231 1 6 . 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town.— The nearest market-town is Biggar, which is 
twelve miles from the Crook Inn. In the parish there is no village 
of any description. . 
' Means of Communication.— There are post-chaises and horses 
at Crook, where is also our post-office. The great road from Edin- 
burgh to Dumfries by Moffat runs ten miles through the parish; 
and as the mail-coach passes along it daily, it is of course kept m 
a state of excellent repair. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church is scarcely two miles from the 
lower extremity of the parish, and, consequently, some of the pa- 
rishioners have to travel eight miles in order to reach it. It was 
built in 1648, and is at present in good repair. It accommodates 
160 individuals, and about 30 free sittings are afforded by the 
communion seats, which, however, have lately been removed to 
make way for a stove during the severer months m winter; but in 
summer, when required for the greater attendance at that time, 
they are replaced. 



TWEEDSMUIR. 



69 



The manse was built thirty-six years ago, and, along with the 
church, has just been receiving extensive repairs. 

The glebe contains 9 acres and 17 falls Scots measure, of ex- 
cellent quality, and may be worth L. 20 Sterling per annum. 

The church, manse, and glebe are situated on a beautiful penin- 
sula formed by the junction of Tweed and Tala. The stipend is 
14 chalders, with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. Of va- 
lued teind there is about L. 60, which is paid in money, without 
conversion into meal and barley. The last augmentation was ob- 
tained in 1821, leaving the teinds unexhausted. 

The parishioners are all attached to the Established church, and 
attend its services, with the exception of two individuals, who had been 
brought up in Secession principles at Peebles, and generally attend 
a meeting-house at Biggar, though they frequently appear along 
with their family at the parish church. The communicants are 
120, and, considering the scattered state of the population, and the 
distance of many from the house of prayer, the usual attendance at 
Divine ordinances is remarkably good. 

Education. — Besides the parish school, there are occasionally 
two private teachers hired for the convenience of a few families at 
a distance. The branches taught in the parish school, besides the 
ordinary ones, are geography, French, Latin, and Greek. The sa- 
lary is L. 32 Sterling per annum ; and school fees amount to about 
L. 12 more. The legal accommodation of a dwelling-house is af- 
forded. The garden is only one-half of the legal allowance, but in 
lieu of the other half, one boll of meal is granted. For teaching 
reading the master charges 8s., writing, 10s., arithmetic, 12s., Latin 
and Greek, 14s. per annum. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — There was formerly a voluntary 
assessment among the heritors, but at present there is no assess- 
ment of any kind. The only support for the poor is derived from 
the weekly collections at church, — the proceeds of mortcloth and 
proclamations of banns. The spirit of independence is very strong 
among the people of this parish, and great aversion is generally 
felt to receiving aid from the poor-box, as it is called. There is 
at present only one pensioner on the poors' funds, who receives 
Is. 3d. per week. Foreign mendicity annoys us greatly, and the 
conveyance of cripples, &amp;c. from hence to Moffat, on the one hand, 
fifteen miles and to Broughton, on the other eight miles, 
forms, as might be expected, a very important item in our annual 
expenditure. The annual amount arising from all the usual sources 



70 



PEEBLES -SHIRE. 



combined for the support of the poor, does not reach at an average 
L. 10 Sterling. 

Inns. — There are three of these in the parish, but, being situ- 
ated on the turnpike road, they may be considered necessary for 
the accommodation of travellers. At the same time they are, to 
a certain extent, demoralizing in their influence, especially on the 
habits of those who live in their vicinity. From the responsibility 
attached to the office of shepherds in this district, where they are 
entrusted with almost the whole management, men of truly up- 
right characters have been generally selected, and it certainly 
speaks volumes in favour of their principles, that few of them are 
at all injuriously affected by the temptations which the contiguity 
of taverns seldom fails to present. 

Fuel. — Coal of good quality cannot be procured nearer than 
Douglas, twenty-six miles distant, and of course it is an expensive 
fuel. But excellent peat abounds in the parish, which is of im- 
mense value, as respects the comfort of the poor. Such was the 
wetness of the summer 1830, that it was scarcely procurable, and 
coals were used in most houses during the following winter ; and 
persons upwards of seventy years of age had recourse to this kind 
of fuel who had never seen it in their houses before.

PRESBYTERY OF PEEBLES, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND TWEED DALE. 

THE REV. JAMES SOMMERVILLE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name and Boundaries. — Mr Welsh, in the Statistical Account 
of 1790, states, that the name signifies in Gaelic " here is a plain." 
Mr Chalmers in his Caledonia, derives it from a term signifying 
the inhabited " ridge." 

The figure of the parish is irregular. The extreme length may 
be reckoned fourteen miles, and the average breadth betwixt three 
and four. It is bounded for the most part by the Tweed, and 
the mountains rise at a small distance from the river, leaving no 
great quantity of arable land, though in different places it spreads 
out into very fine haughs. The population is also chiefly on the 
river side. 

Meteorology. — From the height of the parish above the level of 
the sea, the temperature of the air is rather cold. The prevailing 
winds are the west and south-west. The greatest rains are from 
the south and south-west; and though there are very heavy showers 
from the west, they are seldom of long duration. Rain from the 
east is not frequent, but when it does take place, generally con- 
tinues long. The air is damp from the neighbourhood of the moun- 
tains, though the soil is so dry that the greatest rains speedily dis- 
appear. The east wind prevails much in spring, but the eastern 
hoar is never seen here. The crops are occasionally so much in- 
jured by frost, in late seasons, as to be unfit for seed. 

Diseases. — The prevailing diseases are fevers and consumption, 
as stated in 1790; but rheumatism, which then prevailed, has 
greatly ceased, probably owing to the people being now better 
lodged and clothed. Ague, which appears to have greatly pre- 
vailed in the seventeenth century, is now unknown. 

Hydrography.— The only river in the parish is the Tweed, which 
divides it on the upper part, and runs along the west and north sides 



72 



PEEBLES-SHIRE. 



of it through the lower part ; its depth varies from one foot to three 
or four, with occasionally deep pools. 

Geology and Mineralogy.— The rocks consist of a very hard grey- 
wacke whinstone, having many veins of quartz; of which latter there 
are also detached masses frequently met with. There is a rock of 
compact and very white limestone, on the side of a hill on the east 
side of the Tweed, and another similarly situated on the west side, 
exactly opposite each other; and no other lime is to be found 
nearer than twelve miles. The stratum in both, ranges from west to 
east. Neither of these, however, are wrought, owing to the distance 
from coal. There is abundance of slate in the hills, but none 
wrought at present, as there is an excellent quarry at Stobo, ca- 
pable of supplying all the neighbourhood. Although the mountains 
are of transition formation, no organic remains have hitherto been 
found in them. The soil is generally sharp; the haughs. consist 
of rich alluvial deposits; the land is in general excessively stony ; 
•and the stones are of the same kind as those which compose the 
neighbouring rocks. There is no sandstone, and very little clay 
in the parish. 

Botany.— The common heaths and natural grasses prevail on 
the mountains, and form excellent sheep-pasture. The hills are 
well fitted for bearing Scots firs and larch ; ash, plane and elm, 
thrive well on the lower grounds, and much of the hills might be 
planted with great advantage. But the planting of trees is expen- 
sive here, as very sufficient fences are necessary to preserve them 
from the sheep. 

There are upwards of 400 imperial acres of wood in the parish, 
part of which is on the property of each of the heritors, but chiefly 
cm the estate of Dawick, the property of Sir John M. Nasmyth, 
Bart, of Posso. He has already planted 360 acres, besides old 
wood in the park, single trees and shrubberies, and he is about to 
plant still more extensively. Some of the finest wood in Scotland 
has been raised on this estate ; the horse chesnuts are not only 
ascertained to be the first introduced into Scotland, but are among 
the largest. The oaks and sycamores are also very large, and the 
larches the largest in Scotland, introduced into the country in 1725, 
by the grandfather of the present proprietor, one of the earliest, 
and most spirited improvers in Scotland. One larch is about twenty 
feet in circumference at the bottom. There arc about eleven im- 
perial acres of natural wood. 



DRUMMELZ1ER.

II. — Civil History. 

Accounts of the Parish. — In Dr Pennecuik's History of Tweed- 
dale there are several notices of the parish of Drummelzier. There 
is also something on the same subject in the very accurate and 
particular agricultural survey of the County of Peebles by the Rev. 
Mr Findlater. 

Land-oioners. — The land-owners are, Sir John M. Nasmyth, 
Bart, proprietor of Dawick ; Sir James Montgomery, Bart, pro- 
prietor of Stanhope; Andrew White, Esq. proprietor of Drummel- 
zier ; the Rev. John T. Beresford, proprietor of Kingledoors ; and 
Colonel Hunter, proprietor of Polmood. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers begin 1649, and 
have been regularly kept ever since, except from the year 1683 
to 1689, during which period the minister was ejected for non- 
conformity ; except also from 1694 to 1700, and from 1702 to 
1705, in which intervals there were vacancies in the incumbency 
of the parish ; and during vacancies the registrations seem to 
have been altogether neglected. 

Antiquities. — There are traces of a road along the top of the 
mountain Scrape, understood to have been Roman, and which pro- 
bably connected the camp at Lyne with the great road which ran 
from Carlisle towards Falkirk. There are also the remains of two 
old castles, the one called Tinnes Castle, supposed to be a cor- 
ruption of Thanes. It is of so great antiquity that there is no 
tradition either of its erection or destruction. The walls are two 
Scots ells thick, and the cement as hard as the stone. The other 
is called Drummelzier Place, evidently more modern. It was the 
residence of the Tweedies of Drummelzier, the last of whom died 
in 1617. 

III. — Population. 

It is impossible to discover the state of the population further 
back than Dr Webster's Account, 1755. But in as far as calcu- 
lation can be founded on the register of baptisms, the population 
does not differ materially betwixt 1649 and 1755. 

It has been gradually decreasing ever since that time, from the 
increasing wealth of the country, which puts it in power of indi- 
viduals to take much larger farms than they were formerly able to 
do. The cottages also are allowed greatly to go to decay. This 
seems bad policy, as the cottages supply the farmers with labour- 
ers ; and the servants whose parents reside in the neighbourhood 
are generally most trust-worthy.

Character of the People.— The people, on the whole, enjoy the 
comforts of life in a reasonable degree, and are contented with 
their situation and circumstances. There is little poaching in game, 
but a great deal in salmon. Since the duties were so far lowered 
that good spirits can be got at moderate prices, an end has been 
put to smuggling, which at one time prevailed considerably ; nor 
is there any more drunkenness in this parish now than formerly, in 
consequence of the duties being lowered. There are neither spirits 
nor malt liquors sold in the parish. The people are remarkably 
sober; and their general sobriety has improved greatly of late years. 

During the last three years, there were 7 cases of illegitimate 
birth ; but in 5 of these the parents married. 

IV. — Industby. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy.— There are 12 ploughs in the 
parish, which may have on an average 60 imperial acres each. 
The number of acres never cultivated is 13,815. It is supposed 
there are about 36 acres in the low ground that could be profitably 
brought under cultivation. The number of acres under natural 
wood is 1 1 ; under plantations, 400. 

Bate of Wages.— The rate of wages to farm-servants is from 
L. 10 to L. 12 per annum, with victuals ; of women, L. 6. The 
wages of day-labourers are from Is. 3d. to Is. 6d. with victuals, 
per day for men; for women, 8d. In 1790 they were only the 
half of that amount. Wrights and masons get 2s. 6d. per day, 

without victuals. , 

Breeds of Live-Stock.— .There are about 6600 sheep m the pa- 
rish, mostly of the black-faced breed, which, though inferior to the

Cheviot in fineness of wool, suit the climate better. The Ayrshire 
breed of cows prevail, and every attention is paid to improving them. 

Rent of Land. — There is some pasture-land let this year for 
one season at L. 3, 3s. per Scots acre. The rent of arable land 
cannot be particularly specified, as all the farms consist partly 
of arable, and partly of hill pasture, and a general rent is given 
for the whole, some of the farmers putting more, and some less 
on the arable; but the average among those who live by farm- 
ing may be reckoned 18s. per Scots acre. Some small lots are let 
to tradesmen, &amp;c. at L. 2, 5s. per Scots acre, though of very inferior 
quality ; but this is far beyond what could be given by those who 
are to make their livelihood by farming. 

Husbandry.— The farm-buildings are generally good, and the en- 
closures mostly dry stone dikes. The crops are chiefly oats and 
barley. Bear or bigg is scarcely at all sown. Wheat is some- 
times tried, but in small quantities. 

Produce.— The average gross amount and value of raw produce 
yearly raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as 
follows : 

Wheat, 75 bolls, of 4 bushels each, . T ft7 1» n 

Pease, 90 do. do. . . " S n n

There is scarcely any market for potatoes or turnips, which 
are mostly consumed on the farms. The above is their estimat- 
or a u a\ n0 oL h -f ' they aCtUa "y brin S in to the farmer.

v -— Parochial Economy;. 

Market-Towns.-Theve is no market-town in the parish. The 
two nearest are those of Peebles and Biggar, the first 10, and the 
other 8 miles distant. As grain markets,-Lanark, which is distant 
eighteen miles, and Dalkeith twenty-four. There is a small vil- 
lage in the parish containing fifteen or sixteen families. 

Means of Communication.— These are not very favourable. Coal 
is brought from Douglas, about twenty miles distant, and the near- 
est lime is at Wiston,, distant twelve miles. There arc two roads 



76 PEEBLES-SHIUE. 

to the coals and lime, one over the top of a mountain, impassable 
by a heavy loaded cart in the heat of summer, and the other through 
mire equally impassable, except during the dry months. A small 
outlay would procure a good and level road both for coal and lime. 

Another great disadvantage is the want of a bridge over the 
Tweed, which, when swelled, as it frequently is, by the rains of 
winter, completely intercepts all communication betwixt the opposite 
banks. There can be no doubt but the farmers would pay better 
rents, if they were only favoured with better access to the markets, 
and to lime and coal. There is a post-office at Rachan Mill, 

about a mile distant. 

Ecclesiastical State.-The parish church is not very convenient- 
ly situated, being considerably farther from one end of the parish 
than the other. It is in a good state of repair, and may contain near- 
ly 200 sitters. The average attendance is about 85 or 90. Young 
people generally communicate when about 15 or 16 years of age. 

The manse was built in 1787, and has undergone several repairs. 
The glebe is ten Scots acres, worth L. 1 per acre. 

The stipend consists of 89 bolls, 3 firlots, 31 lippies, barley ; 
91 bolls, 1 firlot, 3 pecks, 1 lippies, oatmeal; 10 bolls oatmeal 
for Dawick glebe, all allocated according to the old weights and 
measures. The teinds are exhausted. The average amount of 
stipend for the last three years has been L. 198, 8s. 8d. 

This parish was united to Tweedsmuir previous to the year 
1643; when they were disjoined, Dawick was suppressed m 1742; 
and part of it joined to Drummelzier, and part to Stobo The glebe 
of Dawick and some servitudes are divided equally betwixt the 
ministers of Drummelzier and Stobo, for which they receive 10 bolls 
of oatmeal each, according to the Mid-Lothian fiars. 

There are no dissenters of any description in the parish at present. 
Education—The parish school is the only one m the parish. 
At present there are no Latin scholars, though there was a con- 
siderable number a few years ago. English costs 2s. per quarter ; 
with writing, 2s. 6d., with arithmetic, 3s. 6d., and with Latin, 4s. 6d. 
The salary is L. 32, and the teacher has all the legal accommoda- 
tion. Theaverageamountofschoolfeesduringthelastthreeyearsis

cation' and all can read who are of age sufficient to attend school. 
F f the population is betwixt three and five miles from the pa- 
school, but are within reach of a school in the neighbounng 
parish It is worthy of remark, that the session record, betwixt 
S vears 1650 and 1660, bears, that the minister interrogated all

the elders, if they kept family worship, by reading the scriptures, 
&amp;c and they all answered, that they neither could read themselves, 
nor had any in their family who could read. On which the mini- 
ster exhorted them to send their children to school, and in hiring 
servants, to try to get some who could read. 

Poor and Parochial Funds— At present there is only one per- 
son receiving regular aid : his allowance is betwixt L. 2 and 
L. 3 per annum. There have occasionally been six or seven on 
the poors' roll, some receiving 3s. 6d. a-week. They are sup- 
ported by weekly collections, — the interest of L. 40, — and occa- 
sional donations from the heritors. There was an assessment for 
several years, but there has been none since 1824. The average 
amount of collections for the last seven years is L. 10, 2s. per annum ; 
average from other sources, L. 5. The heritors have always been 
ready to come forward most liberally in any case of particular dis- 
tress. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

In the last Statistical Account, Mr Welsh observes, that " few 
grass seeds are sown on account of the sheep, which are great ene- 
mies to them." At present, the sowing of grass seeds chiefly 
perennial rye-grass with clover is universal. In 1790, a man-ser- 
vant's wages were L. 6 a-year, a maid-servant's L.3, 5s. Now, the 
man-servant receives from L. 10 to L. 12, and the maid-servant L. 6, 
with victuals. In 1790, a lamb cost 5s. or 6s.; now it costs about 
double of that sum. Sheep, if fat, cost lis. in 1790; now they are 
sold at from 18s. to 20s. The ploughs used in 1790 were of the 
Scotch kind, few English being used, except by gentlemen or im- 
provers, on account of the stony quality of the land. At present 
there is not a Scotch plough in the parish, and two horses are now 
universally used instead of four. The iron plough is become very 
common. In 1790, there were seven weavers in the parish; at 
present there is only one, and he has scarcely any Work. There 
was then also a dyer, but at present there is none. The giving up 
of weaving and dyeing is one of the greatest changes that have taken 
place in parochial economy. It is found more profitable to pur- 
chase at once from the manufacturer. The turnip crops contri- 
bute much to improve the condition of both cattle and sheep. Ewe- 
milk cheese, of which a great quantity was made in 1790, is now 
almost entirely given up, as tending to injure the sheep. The 
introduction of thrashing-machines is an entire novelty since 1790, 
and they are now universally in use.

<p> 

PRESBYTERY OF BIGGAR, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND TWEE DDALE. 

THE REV. HAMILTON PAUL, MINISTER. 

 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 

This parish, which comprehends the old parishes of Broughton 
and Glenholm, with the southern or larger division of Kilbucho, 
retains, agreeably to the provisions of the deed of annexation, all 
the three names. 

Names — Boundaries. — The origin of the designation Glenholm 
is sufficiently obvious. Kilbucho spelled Kilbeukhoe, Kilbochoe, 
Kilbocho, and Kirkbucho, is supposed to be the Gaelic term for the 
cell or chapel of St Bede, the venerable church historian, or St 
Bega, the patroness of Kilbagie, or St Bees, in Cumberland. 
Broughton is by some alleged to be a corruption of Borough- town, 
and by others of Brook-town. More probably, however, as the 
plain in which the hamlet is situated is surrounded by hills, form- 
ing a complete amphitheatre, and as the term Brought or Bruch in 
the Scottish dialect means a circle, the name has taken its rise 
from this circumstance of locality; " the town or village within the 
brough or circle of hills." 

This united parish is bounded on the west and north-west by 
Culter and Skirling ; by Kirkurd on the north ; on the east and 
north-east by Stobo ; and by Drummelzier on the south and south- 
east. The Tweed divides it from Drummelzier for about four miles. 
It is nine miles and a half in length, and three and a-half in breadth, 
containing a superficies of thirty square miles. 

Topographical Appearances. — The surface of the ground is beau- 
tifully irregular, and were it as well wooded as many other districts, 
would be extremely picturesque in respect of scenery. It is re- 
markable that there are only three hills or detached insulated emi- 
nences in Tweeddale. Rachan Hill in Glenholm, which is one of 



BROUGHTON, GLENHOLM, AND KILBUCHO. 79 

the three, is a lovely green solitary height, declining suddenly 
to the Tweed on the one side, and on the other rising with a 
gentle acclivity "from Holms water. The rest of the eminences 
are continuous chains or mountainous ranges. One of these ridges, 
which separates Broughton from Stobo and Kirkurd, extends for 
more than three miles from south to north ; another, which divides 
Glenholm from Kilbucho and Culter, runs for nearly five miles 
from north-east to south-west, and a third runs parallel with the 
Tweed in a southerly direction for upwards of three miles; a fourth 
range passes through the middle of the old parish of Kilbucho 
from east to west for about two miles ; and a fifth, though of less 
elevation, divides the parish of Broughton into two unequal parts. 
These heights are in general steep, but accessible. Culterfell, 
which is partly in Glenholm, is 2430 feet above the level of the 
sea. Cardon, in the immediate neighbourhood, with Chapelgill 
attached to it, is nearly as high. The other remarkable heights 
are Mossfennan Wormwell, and Blakup, in Glenholm ; Pyket- 
stane and Broughton-hope in Broughton, which vary from 1500 to 
1800 feet above the level of the sea; and Goseland in Kilbucho, 
of almost equal altitude. Between those chains or ridges above- 
mentioned are some fine fertile valleys. 

Glenholm, in particular, is a delightful pastoral vale, stretching 
from the site of the old church about four miles, and intersected 
by a limpid stream, whose windings cheat the eye so as to render 
it doubtful whether it be flowing up or down the glen. Its tribu- 
tary streams descend through Glenhigton, Glencotho, Glenkirk, 
and Glenlude. At the confluence of each of these rills with Holms 
water, stands the dwelling of a shepherd, around which a Sabbath- 
like serenity reigns, save when the gathering or shearing, or wash- 
ing of the sheep takes place, as described by the poet, 

" Urged to the giddy brink much is the toil, 
The clamour much of men and boys, and dogs, 
Ere the soft fearful people to the flood 
Commit their woolly sides." 

Biggar water, which forms the boundary betwixt the Broughton 
on the north, and the Glenholm and Kilbucho divisions of the pa- 
rish on the south, pervades a tract of moss and meadow, receiving 
in its course the tribute of Kilbucho and Broughton burns, and 
Holms water; and after its junction with the last, becomes the boun- 
dary for half a mile betwixt Stobo and Glenholm. Broughton burn 
falls into it at a right angle from the north, and Kilbucho burn and 
Holms water at similar angles from the south or south-west, and

the united streams throw themselves into the Tweed opposite the 
spacious and fertile haugh of Drummelzier. Here all the streams 
of the three parishes are united, and the scene may, with propriety, 
be styled " the meeting of the waters." 

Geology. — Ratshill, a singularly formed eminence near the village 
of Broughton, is composed of hard loose stones of a slaty appear- 
ance, a species of trap or tuffa, excellently adapted to the Macad- 
amizing of highways. Attempts have been made to find coal in 
Broughton, Glenholm, and Kilbucho, without success; the pre- 
vailing rocks here being those of the transition class, coal was 
scarcely to be expected. The general character of the soil in 
this united parish is moss, clay, loam, with a considerable pro- 
portion of alluvial deposition. Beautiful pebbles are frequently 
found on the north side of Biggar water, but on the south side not 
a single specimen has ever been discovered. Porphyry and jasper 
in small masses are abundant ; and gray whin or puddingstone in 
detached pieces is of frequent occurrence. 

Soil. The vales through which the streams already-mentioned 

flow are at the upper end generally of a mossy or coarse grassy 
character, but where they spread out at the lower ends into holm 
or haugh land, the soil is deep, rich, and adapted to any species 
of crop. 

At the junction of Biggar water with Broughton burn, the soil 
rivals that of the finest carse lands, and where the Capolm meets 
these united streams, the alluvial deposits render the ground exceed- 
ingly fruitful. They require no manure, but yield the same white 
crops for five or six years successively, and these are in danger of 
lodging from their exuberant growth. But for their liability to 
be overflowed by the swellings of Biggar water, the fields would 
make an ample return of green crops. The potatoes have some- 
times materially suffered from the inundations; and early frosts 
have proved fatal to the pease, as well as the potatoes. 

Meteorology.— In winter, the thermometer varies from below 
zero to 40°, and in summer from 50° to 90°, and the barometer 
takes the whole range from 28° to 31°, or from great storm to very 
dry. The clouds assume every variety of shape, colour, and ap- 
pearance. In the mornings, the valleys are often covered with a 
thick fog, which gradually ascends the hills, and is often the pre- 
lude to a hot sultry day. When the mist forms first on the hill 
tops, and descends towards the valleys, it prognosticates rain ; when 
the clouds rise gradually around the horizon, and move towards the

zenith, or when a dark cloud, with a well-defined edge, hovers at 
no great height, we are sure to have a storm of thunder and light- 
ning, and hail or rain. A luminous arch of electric matter extend- 
ing nearly in the direction of the Milky Way has been seen three 
times at least within these twenty years, and mistaken by some un- 
philosophical observers for a lunar rainbow, but at the time there 
was no moon in our hemisphere, and the bow was in the zenith. 

The climate is in general moist, and the atmosphere cloudy. 
Yet the improvements in agriculture, especially the draining of the 
bogs and cultivation of the mosses, have greatly improved the health 
of the inhabitants. Ague is now unknown, and many other ma- 
ladies are either mitigated or exploded. 

Diseases. — The principal disorders are fevers, typhus, inflamma- 
tory or rheumatic; colds accompanied with coughs, asthma, and 
consumption. Vaccination is almost universally practised. Stone 
and gravel are less prevalent than they were in days when strong 
ale was the favourite beverage. Gout is scarcely known. Cuta- 
neous eruptions are by no means common. This must in a great 
measure be attributed to that weekly lustration which takes place 
among the church-going part of the community, preparatory to their 
attendance on public worship. 

Longevity.— The instances of longevity are perhaps unparalleled 
among a people so limited in respect of numbers. About twelve 
years ago, there were living within the space of four square miles, 
four persons who were each considerably above eighty years of age. 
In Kilbucho, there were also four who had reached the borders of 
ninety. Four brothers were born at Brough ton- Mill, who all 
weathered the frosts of fourscore winters. In the village, there 
are at present six individuals who have passed the promised age of 
threescore years and ten. In the country part of the parish, there 
are six persons between eighty and ninety years of age ; and one 
man has lived to see six incumbents in the pastoral care of Brough- 
ton parish, though one of them was upwards of forty years minister. 
The oldest man in the united parish at present, and who is tolera- 
bly healthy, is eighty-nine, and the oldest woman, who also enjoys 
a comfortable share of bodily strength, is eighty-two years old. 

Hydrography.— There are at Rachan two fine pieces of water, 
ornamented with wooded islets. The one is stocked with trout, 
and the other with perch. The latter is fringed round the margin 
with an aquatic plant called tench grass. 

 H rivers we have none save the Tweed, which forms the southern

boundary of Glenholm ; as it has frequently changed its course, it 
sometimes happens, that a part of Drummelzier is on this, and a 
portion of Glenholm on the other, side of the stream. 

The streams besides those already mentioned are Logan and 
Hollows burns, the one a tributary to Broughton burn, and the 
other to the Tweed. 

Springs.— Few parishes are more highly favoured than this in 
regard to salubrious springs. Bede's or Bees well, as it is common- 
ly called, was an open draw-well built round with stone, from which 
issued a plentiful current. The proprietor of the glebe of Kilbucho 
has covered it over with flags or flat stones and earth, so as to ren- 
der the spot arable, and the water, by means of a conduit, spouts 
in abundance from the banks into the channel of the burn. 
" On the old glebe of Broughton, is a well with a large stone in 
the middle of it. The water which springs from one side of the 
stone is sweet, that which rises at the other side is brackish and 
medicinal. 

Among the hills there are wells of which the water is so very 
cold, that in the heat of summer a person cannot hold his hand in 
it for more than a minute without suffering the pain of extreme 
cold. One spring is remarkable for reducing spirits without tinging 

them. . f , 

Mineralogy.— There is not much to engage the attention ot the 
mineralogist in this quarter. The prevailing rock is greywacke 
whinstone; some of the beds lie in a horizontal position; but 
they in general dip towards the centre of the hills. In some places 
where a deep cut has been made for the improvement of the high 
road, the section offers to the view a variety of strata, consisting of 
water channel, greywacke, detached masses of granite and pud- 
dingstone, intermixed with narrow beds of sand, but with few or no 
crystals of quartz. Brick-clay is rare, and no sandstone is to be 
found On the farm of Wrae in Glenholm are a limestone and 
slate quarry, which, owing to the great distance from coal, and the 
immediate neighbourhood of the Stobo slate quarry, would scarcely 
repay the expense of manufacturing the minerals. Slates are also 
found on Rachan hill, but, for the same reason, it has not been 
deemed advisable to work the mine. A bed of fine sand on the 
farm of Stirkfield in Broughton is admirably adapted to the in- 
termixing with lime for building, and gravel-pits are numerous. 

In the vale of Kilbucho lies an extensive moss, obviously Form- 
ed by the decomposition of wood and other vegetable matter. The 



BROUGHTON, GLENHOLM, AND K1LBUCHO. 83 



peat is of excellent quality. Large trunks of oaks and other trees, 
in good preservation, have been found imbedded in the mosses. 

Zoology. — Birds. — A single pair, resembling the Saxicola rube- 
tra or whin-chat, come regularly every season and build their nest 
on the ground, close by the side of the road leading to the manse. 
They usually bring seven young ones, and when these are able 
to fly, they all take their departure hence. It may in general be 
said that we have as residents or occasional visitants some species 
of the following genera : — Motacilla, Hirundo, Cuculus, Columba, 
Rallus, Alauda, Caprimulgus, Turdus, Co'vus, Scolopax, Anas, 
Emberiza, Parus, and Fringilla. 

The only sleeper we know is the bat. All birds that feed ex- 
clusively on insects must either in winter repair to milder climates, 
or betake themselves to repose. 

The birds of passage that visit us in winter are the fieldfare, 
the red-wing, the snow-flake, and the cock of the north, to which 
we may join the ring-ouzel, that stays only till the fruit of the 
mountain ash is exhausted. 

The water-ouzel, which feeds on fish, remains with us all the 
year round. The opinion, that the male chaffinches leave this 
district in winter, seems to originate in a mistake. The young 
males have for the first season no gayer plumage than the females, 
and, consequently, during the winter the number of females ap- 
pears to be altogether out of proportion to that of the males. 

Wild-swans, wild-geese, and sea-mews are not so plentiful as 
formerly, owing to the same cause which has banished the wild- 
ducks, viz. the draining of the bogs and cultivation of the meadows. 
The snipes, for a similar reason, are less frequent than formerly. 
Magpies are natives ; but the jay is seldom to be seen within our 
bounds. 

Wood-pigeons are enemies to turnips, especially the ruta baga. 
In severe winters they collect in thousands, and eat up not only 
the leaves, but penetrate into the very heart of the plant. Green 
kail and cabbage, if planted at a distance from houses, are equally 
liable to their depredations. Pheasants, as well as crows, are pe- 
culiarly hurtful to potato crops: but a species of potato has been dis- 
covered that bids defiance to their ingenuity. It may be planted so 
deep as to be out of the reach of their mining bills, and yet springs 
up as well as those planted much nearer the surface. The jay 
and the bullfinch are particularly obnoxious to gardeners. It is 
uncertain, however, whether the latter are in search of insects thai

devour the buds of fruit trees, or whether they eat up the heart g 
of the buds themselves. The weasel, though an enemy to the 
poultry, is in some respects a friend to the farmer. It kills the 
mice and rats which lodge in corn-stacks and infest the barns of 
the husbandman. The usefulness of the polecat is doubtful : 
it seems formed only for destruction. It has been known to 
kill and carry away dozens, and even scores of barn-door fowls in 
the course of a night. Frogs and efts, or newts, purify spring 
water, by feasting on the insects that would corrupt it ; and the 
lizard performs a similar office on land, by devouring those minute 
animals that prey on the leaves of plants. The heron, on the 
other hand, prevents the race of frogs from becoming too popu- 
lous, in which he obtains the co-operation of ducks, wild and tame. 
A species of bird resembling the sea-mew is a constant attendant 
on die ploughman in spring, and eats up an incalculable number 
of grubs and worms. Tadpoles are infinite in number, but are 
kept down by the different species of water-fowl. 

In severe winters, especially in time of snow, the barn-yards are 
the common rendezvous of fowls of every wing ; and the loss to 
the farmer, if he dwell contiguous to a great man's preserve, is al- 
most incredible, not only with regard to his stacks in winter, but 
his green and white crops in summer and harvest. The damage 
clone by hares and pheasants has been ascertained to equal the 
rent of the farm. 

Botany. — The brambleberry. is scarcely known here, but the 
raspberry grows wild. Blaeberries are exceedingly abundant in 
Rachan woods, and on some of the heights. The whortleberry 
is also found on lofty places, along with the crane and crawberries. 
The sloethorn is to be found only at Mossfennan ; and wild roses 
flourish in many places. 

Hazel-nuts have been found several feet below the surface of 
the ground, though there are hardly any hazel bushes existing at 
present in this quarter. Filberts are occasionally planted in the 
pleasure-grounds, but they seldom bring their fruit to maturity. 
The remains of a natural wood may be seen on the estate of Moss- 
fennan ; but all the other trees in the parish have been planted, 
though formerly many of them were indigenous. 

About half a century ago it was scarcely believed that any trees 
would thrive in this climate, except Scotch fir. John Loch, Esq. 
of Rachan, however, set the example ; and, besides fifty acres of 
Scotch fir, planted larches, and a variety of hard wood trees, which 



BROUGHTON, GLENHOLM, AND KILBUCHO. 



have succeeded well. In one or two places there are trees of old 
standing. The soil appears friendly to the production of every 
species of tree, whether deciduous or evergreen ; but the larches, 
Huntingdon willows, lime, and mountain ashes, shoot up most ra- 
pidly, and the ornamental shrubs are not backward. The oldest 
and largest trees in the parish are ashes. In some parts of the 
parish, where there were extensive plantations of Scotch fir, these 
trees have either died or been cut down by the hand of man. The 
soil, which is of a gravelly and sour description, appears to be pe- 
culiarly unfavourable to the growth of that species of plant. 

The climate is also unfavourable to the ripening of the richer 
and more delicate species of fruit. At Mossfennan, Broughton 
Place, and the manse, are walled gardens, which sometimes yield 
a good crop of apples, pears, cherries, plums, and small fruit. 
The wall of the old garden at Kilbucho Place is in a dilapidated 
state, but the crop of apples and plums is often very abundant. 
In some other gardens, which are surrounded only by a hedge or 
paling, fruit-trees are sometimes sufficiently productive. At Moss- 
fennan, where the garden has been recently formed, with a fine ex- 
posure to the mid-day sun, apples are reared that will stand com- 
parison with the richest produce of the orchards of Clydesdale. 

In former times every farm-house had its small orchard ; and if 
proprietors would allot to every tenant a rood or two of land, free 
of rent, on the condition of his planting it with fruit-trees, the 
country would in a short time assume a more interesting aspect, 
and supply the people with many of the simple luxuries of rural 
life. 

II. — Civil History. 

Accounts of the Parish. — The modern history of the parish can 
be gathered only from the parish registers, Dr Pennecuik's and 
Armstrong's Accounts of Tweeddale, and Findlater's Agricultural 
survey of Peebles-shire; and from the Statistical Account rendered 
to Sir John Sinclair, and another by a literary gentleman, a native 
of Glenholm, published in the Statistical Magazine of August 1819. 

Eminent Persons.— The most remarkable characters connected 
with the district were, Secretary Murray, called the Apostate, 
who resided at Broughton Place, and whose history is well known : 
— Robert Macqueen of Braxfield, whose rigorous measures, when 
he was Lord Justice- Clerk, were supposed to have been amongst 
the moans of saving this country from the horrors of a revolution. 

Land-owners,— John Macqueen, Esq. of Braxfield, is sole pro-

PEEBLES-SHIRE. 



prietor of Broughton. In Glenholm there are three residing heri- 
tors or families: Loch of Rachan, Welsh of Mossfennan, and 
Tweedie of Quarter. The non-resident heritors are, Sir John 
Hay of Hayston and Smithfield, Baronet, M. P.; Sir John Na- 
smyth of Posso, Baronet; Hunter of Polmood, and Seton of 
Dukepool. 

The property of the last mentioned gentleman is in extent no 
more than a Scotch acre.  

Sir James Montgomery is proprietor of the eighth part of Glenkirk, 
amounting to L. 34 Scots of valuation. The heritors of Kilbucho 
are four in number, of whom three, namely, the Honourable Lord 
Medwyn, John Dickson, Esq. of Hartree and Kilbucho, and John 
Cuninghame, Esq. of Duchrae, are non-resident. The fourth, 
James Richardson, Esq. of Springfield, is proprietor of the old 
manse and glebe, on which he resides. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers go back as far as 

" There is a curious, if not fabulous, tradition as to the mode in which this pro- 
perty was acquired. It runs thus : That, as one of the Scottish kings, perhaps 
James IV. who occasionally, during the hunting season, spent a few days at Pol- 
mood or Badlieu, was returning from one of those rambles, which he frequently un- 
dertook in disguise, he passed the castle of Drummelzier, the seat of Sir J ames Tweedie, 
who was in the habit of exacting homage, and levying tribute, from all passengers. 
The king came up to an old man, a cobbler, named Bartram, tending his cow, and 
amusing himself with a tune on the bagpipe. The monarch accepted an invitation 
to the cottage of his new acquaintance, where he was hospitably, but with homely fare, 
entertained by the cobbler and his wife. In the morning the king disclosed to his 
host who he was, and made him a grant of certain lands in view of his house, to the 
extent of fourteen acres, with the pool in the centre, to be called Drone instead of 
Duckpool, in memory of the tunes played on the bagpipe the evening before, and 
as much more ground at the foot of the Holms water as would keep a mare and a 
foal, with a brood sow and nine pigs, and a free passage for them to and from his 
house : and they were to be driven at no harder rate than a woman could walk knit- 
ting a stocking, or spinning on a rock or distaff. Bartram was also to have five 
soums of sheep on Holms common. 

After the king, accompanied by the cobbler, who had offered to be his guide, passed 
the castle-gate without yielding the accustomed homage, they were immediately pur- 
sued and arrested by Sir James Tweedie and his armed followers. Thereupon, the 
king, taking a smaU bugle horn from his side, and sounding it, m the course of a 
few minute four-and-twenty belted knights came from Badlieu to his assistance. 
The haughty feudal chief, having now discovered the dignity of his prisoner, fell on 
his knees, and implored the clemency of his sovereign, who forgave him for the pre- 
sent, but upbraided him with his tyranny and exactions, and commanded him against 
a certain day to attend his pleasure at the palace of Holyrood. Hie pool in the 
Tweed where the king was arrested is to this day known by the name of the Drone 
pool. It is near the march betwixt Badlieu and Glenbreck. The king charged 
Bartram to appear in his holyday array at Holyrood on the day appointed for Sir 
James Tweedie's trial, which he did, and was honoured with taking precedence of 
all the nobles on their entrance into the royal presence. Tweedie was tried Tor Ins 
offences stript of the greater part of his possessions and titles, and was the last de- 
scendan of the Frazers of Oliver that enjoyed the honour of knighthood Lawrence 
Tweedie Esq. of Oliver, is said to be the only surviving representative of that femily. 
Srproperty of Bartram, now called Dukepool, has dwindled down to its pr-esen 
dhnensSs is alleged, by the encroachment of the «f ghbounng proprietors. 1 , 
is now the property of Mr Seaton, son-in-law to Mr John Bartnttn.

the year 1700. Large portions of them have been lost ; but they 
are now, and have for some years past been, exceedingly well kept, 
and it is in contemplation to make them more complete by a rigor- 
ous enforcement of insertion. 

Antiquities. — Of the circular fortifications or enclosures called 
camps, there are traces of no less than nine. The most remark- 
able is, for reasons unknown, called Macbeth's castle. It was sur- 
rounded by two concentric walls and ditches. The exterior cir- 
cumvallation was about half a furlong in circumference. It was 
probably a place of refuge for women, children, and cattle, during 
the incursions of the border marauders, or it might have been a 
baronial or feudal judgment seat. The lesser circular strongholds 
appear to have been beacons or alarm posts, as they were all placed 
in such a line of communication as to telegraph, as it were, tidings 
of invasion or threatened outrage with the least possible delay.  

On the side of a hill in Kilbucho, called Aiken or Oaken Brae, 
where there is not a single vestige of wood at present, an axe, dif- 
fering a little in shape from those now in use, and greatly corrod- 
ed with rust, was turned up by the plough a few years ago. It 
had doubtless been employed in felling the wood, especially the 
oaks, which grew there in former days when this country was al- 
most an entire forest. A kind of battle-axe of mixed metal was 
ploughed up near the same spot, and an instrument of a similar 
metallic composition was discovered in the vicinity of Polmood, a 
hunting-seat of our ancient Scottish kings. It has perhaps been 
the lock of a cross-bow, as it has a spring and a trigger. A third 
axe was very lately found in Cloverhill, parish of Broughton, with 
a hose to receive the shaft. 

Near the confluence of Biggar water with the Tweed, on the 
estate of Rachan, in the midst of a knoll or tumulus, stone coffins 
containing human skeletons were discovered about forty years ago. 
One of the bodies was of gigantic size, and had golden bracelets 
round its arms. At Logan a rude stone coffin was lately found, 
in which were the remains of a human being ; and at a place near 
the church, called the Gallow Knowe, a similar discovery was 
made. The bones are supposed to have belonged to a criminal 
or vassal executed there in feudal times. 

A wedge or ring of gold of considerable weight was dug up by 
a farmer in the parish of Broughton. He sold it to a goldsmith 

• Sec original MS. for some details as to the remains of churches, and of the man- 
sion-houses that belonged to the proprietors before-named.

in Glasgow, and the price enabled him to pay at least a year's 
rent of his farm. An ancient candlestick, and some other articles 
of no great value, were disinterred near the ruins of the circular 
camp, called Macbeth's Castle. Stone hammers and axes, arrow 
heads of flint, whorls of stone for old women's distaffs, adder or 
elfstones, tobacco-pipes, called cutties, and other productions of 
primitive art, are frequently brought up to view by the plough or 
the spade. 

Modem Buildings. — The more modern buildings are those of 
Rachan, Mossfennan, and Quarter, which, with some recent addi- 
tions and improvements, are delightful residences. They are all 
embosomed in wood, and can bid defiance equally to the winter's 
blast and the summer's ray. Many of the farm-houses vie with those 
of the gentry in outward appearance and internal accommodation. 
Broughton Place, however, is, perhaps, the best finished house in 
this vicinity. It occupies a commanding station, amid full-grown 
woods, near the middle of an avenue of old trees half a-mile in 
length.

 That the population of these parishes was greater in former times than at 
present, is evident from a document giving an account of a weapon-shawing on the 
Borrowmuir, or King's muir of Peebles, in presence of James Nasmyth ol Posso, 
Sheriff-depute of the sheriffdom of Peebles, the 15th day of June 1627, when, among 
others, compeared the Laird of Stenhope, absent himself, seven of his men present 
horsed, all with lances and swords, in the parish of Broughton.— The Laird of Haldon 
absent himself— John Waldon, his bailie present, in his name, accompanied with ten 
horsemen and twelve footmen, with lances and swords, in the parish of Broughton.—

and upwards is 10 ; and of those who draw an inferior rent, 3. 

Character and Habits of the People. — The people are above the 
middle size. They excel in athletic exercises, and have gained 
prizes in the gymnastics of St Ronans. Harvest home, halloween, 
new-year's-day, and Valentine's eve, are observed with a kind of re- 
ligious scrupulosity. In adorning their persons and decorating their 
cottages, they in general exhibit taste and neatness. The ordinary 
food of the common people is oatmeal porridge to breakfast ; kale 
or broth, with sometimes a little animal food, to dinner; potatoes, 
whole or mashed ; porridge or sowens, a preparation from oatmeal 
sittings, with milk, to supper, and frequently bread and cheese, 
or butter. Those who have little gardens attached to their dwell- 
ings have always a supply of wholesome culinary vegetables. Loaf- 
bread has almost superseded the use of oaten cakes. The farmers, 
who were wont to mess with their servants, have now their separate 
dining parlours. 

Drinking bouts are less frequent and less protracted than they 

population than the northern half, but the difference is not material. As the old pa- 
rish of Kilbucho is in some respects still undivided, it would have been better to 
have given all its statistics in one return, particularizing the different proportions, but, 
owing to the misunderstanding, this could not be effected.

were in the days of our forefathers. Profane swearing is less fashion- 
able, and fighting not so much in vogue. Few people enjoy the 
comforts of life and advantages of society more than the inhabitants 
of this district of country. They are equally remote from the re- 
fined luxuries of metropolitan life and the rusticity of clownish ig- 
norance. They are social, convivial, hospitable, fond of reading, 
though without parish libraries, — the wealthy having small select 
libraries of their own, and the poorer the Bible and shorter cate- 
chism. Many of them are subscribers to a public library in Biggar. 

Poachers are diminishing in numbers. Some fines have of late 
been imposed, which may operate as a check, and smuggling is 
greatly on the decline. A few years ago private distillation was 
practised among the neighbouring mountains. 

During the last three years, there have been 9 illegitimate births 
in the parish. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Economy. 

This united parish contains 20,000 imperial acres, and one-fourth is in lea or under 



the plough, - - - .... 5000 

And one- twentieth part capable of being cultivated, - - 1000

The plantations consist chiefly of Scotch fir and larch, a con- 
siderable number of oaks, ashes, elms, beeches, limes, birches, al- 
ders, mountain ashes, and all the willow tribe are intermixed with 
evergreens, such as spruce and silver fir. 

Rent of Land. — The value of the arable lands varies from L.3 
to 10s., and the average may be stated at L. 1, 5s. per acre. The 
highest rent of grazing per ox for the season, L. 6 ; the highest 
rent of grazing per cow, L. 5 ; sheep for the year, 7s. 

Rate of Wages. — A pLoughman's wages, L. 9, 15s., six bolls of 
meal, a cow's grass, and four carts of coal driven; shepherd's wages, 
cow, meal, and coal, as above, forty sheeps' grass, half a boll of 
potatoes planted ; if a single man, he has only the sheeps' grass, 
with victuals and lodging in lieu of the rest. Maid-servants from 
L. 2, 10s. to L.3, 10s. the half year; a day-labourer in summer, 
Is. 6d. per day, with victuals; wrights, masons, and other artisans 
2s. a day, with victuals also ; in winter a reduction takes place ; 
tailors who go to families to work receive Is. 6d. a-day and their 
food; weavers, 2d. 3d. 4d. 5d. 6d. and 7d. per yard, according to 
quality; peat-casters ls.6d.a day, with victuals,— women get only

season, from Is. to 2s., with victuals; hay-makers, men Is., women 
6d., with food; potatoe and turnip hoers, generally females, may be 
had for 6d. per day, with victuals, sometimes lOd. 

Husbandry. — The system of husbandry carried on is agreeable 
to modern improvements. A rotation of crop is almost universally 
adopted. In breaking up the lea or pasture ground, which has lain 
for some seasons, the first crop or crops are oats or peas ; next, 
turnips or potatoes ; third, barley, among which rye-grass and clo- 
ver seeds are sown ; fourth, hay. Then it either remains in pas- 
ture for a few years, or a fresh rotation commences. When wheat 
is intended to be raised, previous summer fallowing is essential. 
The iron plough has in a great measure superseded the use of the 
old Scotch plough. The hurkle is used in strong foul land ; sel- 
dom more than two horses are employed, and oxen are generally 
disused. The ploughmen display great skill, and make beautiful 
work. Robert Welsh, Esq. of Mossfennan, has recently improved 
thirty-six acres of moorland, which before yielded nothing but coarse 
heath, but now produces the most luxuriant crops under an approved 
course of rotation. 

Thomas Tweedie, Esq. of Quarter, is giving a new face to his 
farm of Whitslaid, under the superintendence of a grieve or land- 
steward. He is renewing the fences, manuring with lime, putting 
down a number of additional plantations, and otherwise improving 
that portion of his estate, which in a few years will render it an or- 
nament to this part of the country. 

On the estate of Rachan, the Tweed, for about a mile, has been 
substantially embanked by William Loch, Esq. the proprietor; a 
considerable quantity of fine haugh or holm land is thus protected 
from the encroachments of the river. Other improvements of im- 
portance have been made on the estate of Kilbucho, more espe- 
cially on that of Kilbucho Place, and on the glebe. 

Neither the Fiorin grass nor the Lucerne has been cultivated to 
any extent. The mangel-wurzel has been raised on a very limited 
scale, and the Swedish turnip has fallen into disrepute. The globe 
turnip arrives at the greatest size, the yellow stands the winter best, 
and the red-topped holds a middle rank in the estimation of the 
fanner. By allowing these different varieties to grow to seed in 
the same field, some curious hybrids have been produced, surpas- 
sing any of the parents as esculents. A cross betwixt the yellow 
and globe has been tried with success.

PEEBLES-SHIRE. 



Leases are generally granted for nineteen years, but farms purely 
of the store kind are let for fourteen years only. In some instances 
a break in the lease at the end of five, nine, or any other number 
of years is agreed on. 

The chief hinderances to improvement are the non-residence 
of the proprietors, the distance from markets, coal, and lime ; and 
to these may be added strict entails, which fetter both the land- 
lord and the tenant. 

Produce. — The average gross amount and value of raw pro- 
duce exclusive of pasture yearly raised in the parish may be as 
follows : 

2000 acres wheat, barley, oats, pease, at L. 8 per acre, . L. 16000 0 0 

90 acres potatoes, at L. 7 per acre, ...... 630 0 0 

240 acres turnips, at L. 4 per do., 960 0 0 

189 acres sown grass, 85 do. meadow hay, ..... 941 0 0 
Pasture, rating it at L. 3 per cow grazed, or that may be grazed, for 
the season, and 5s. per ewe pastured, or that may be pastured, for 

the year, 2400 0 0 

Thinnings of wood, 300 0 0 

L. 21231 0 0 

Hardly any flax is raised in this parish. It is supposed to 
scourge the soil, and linen can be purchased at a moderate rate. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication. — The principal cause of the great 
unevenness of the old public roads was a belief that it was next to 
impossible to make a path that could be travelled, through a bog, 
swamp, or morass. Yielding to this mistaken notion, the surveyor 
conducted his line up hill and down dale, wherever he could find 
a hard or rocky bottom, which was less injurious in its effects, at 
a time when wheel carnages were almost altogether unknown. 
Another cause was the desire of accommodating country gentle- 
men with regard to their parks, policies, and gardens. To avoid 
interfering with these, the road formed a semicircle, or went off at 
a right angle, thereby occasioning a loss to the public, and a delay 
to the traveller. 

Under the management of a skilful and judicious superintendent, 
the line of toll-road is in a fair way of being greatly amended. 
Three miles of new road, from the village of Broughton to the 
northern extremity of the parish, has already been made at an ex- 
pense of about L. 1000, and another of nearly two miles, farther 
south, is contracted for at L. 800 or thereby, and when the work 

shall be executed, the intercourse between the capital and the 

3 



BROUGHTON, GLENHOLM, AND KILBUCHO. 



93 



provincial town will be facilitated, and the road will rival the best 
in the kingdom. 

The mail from the south arrives at Broughton about half-past 
twelve noon ; that from the north reaches the same place at one 
in the morning. Last summer, the Hero light-coach went and 
came every alternate day. 

There is one toll-bar within the parish. The rates are, a horse, 
3d. ; cart with horse, 6d. ; a gig or chaise with one horse, 9d. ; a 
carriage with two horses, Is. 6d. ; with four, 3s.; with six, 4s. 6d. ; 
black cattle, per score Is. 8d. ; sheep do. 4d., &amp;c. The present 
rent is L. 124. It was only L. 100 last year. 

The worst piece of road in this part of the County is from Peebles 
to Biggar through Broughton, but it is now in a fair way of soon being 
in a state of good repair. From the coal-works at Ponfeith to the 
Tweed in this vicinity, the tract is so level, that a rail-road or canal 
could be easily formed. A great proportion of the waters of the 
Clyde might, with very little effort, be brought to join the 
Tweed. 

In the new road bill, it is proposed that a line from Peebles to 
Biggar shall be formed, whereby every inequality of surface may 
be avoided. Should this plan be executed, the English tourist 
may begin at Berwick upon Tweed, and proceed along a compa- 
ratively smooth, level, and delightful road, enjoying the whole of 
the beautiful and grand scenery of two of the finest rivers in the 
kingdom, and terminate his land journey at Greenock, whence he 
may voyage in steam-boats, and circumnavigate all the western 
islands of Scotland. 

A survey has been taken of a rail-road from Glasgow to Kelso, 
which would pass through this parish, or a little to the north of it, 
to Peebles, and by the side of the Tweed to Kelso, and even to 
Berwick. As there are several iron-works not far distant, the ma- 
terial for the road might be had at a comparatively trifling ex- 
pense. 

The toll-road within the parish is eight miles in length : a pa- 
rish road, part of the line from Peebles to Biggar, extends for about 
three miles, and another parish road runs for three miles and a- half 
through the southern part of Kilbucho, till it joins the roads lead- 
ing to Biggar and Culter. 

There are three bridges along which the turnpike road runs, 
one over Kilbucho, and another over Broughton burn, with a few 



94

of less size over the smaller streams. They are kept in good re- 
pair, but the old ones are narrow and awkwardly placed. 

Market-Town. — The nearest market town is Biggar, at the dis- 
tance of five miles from Broughton village. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church is situated in Kilbucho, and 
is very centrical for the united population. The most remote house 
in the parish is not five miles from the church. The church was 
built in 1804, exceedingly homely in its exterior, but very com- 
fortable as a place of worship, with regard to its internal arrange- 
ment, and capable of accommodating 500 persons. The sittings 
are all free. Each of the heritors has his proportion of room for 
his own family and those of his tenants, and strangers are accom- 
modated in the least crowded pews. The church is in a good state 
of repair. 

The manse was built in 1815, and cost upwards of L. 1200. 
The situation chosen for the manse was in appearance the least 
eligible that could be selected. It was in the centre of a morass 
that could not be drained. The incumbent only was satisfied. It 
was objected to by both heritors and presbytery. Two or three old 
thorn bushes tried in vain to hide the nakedness of the scene. 
When the manse and offices were finished in a superior style, the 
heritors having added L. 100 of their own accord to the expense, 
over and above the original estimate and contract, the incumbent 
set to work, and with his own hands raised a wood in front, and at 
one of the ends of the house, which now almost prevents the moun- 
tain tops from being seen from the lower windows. Some of the 
birches, alders, limes, Huntingdon willows, and mountain ashes, are 
as thick as a man's waist, and from twenty to thirty feet in height. 
The oaks, ashes, larches, and spruces, are also in a thriving con- 
dition. The soil is favourable to the growth of thorn hedges and 
shrubs in general. Fruit-trees do not succeed so well, as the sub- 
soil is till, and when the roots reach it the tree degenerates. 

The glebe of Broughton, which was an excamb in lieu of the 
old one, is in extent about 21 English acres, and is worth at least 
L. 2 an acre. The glebe of Glenholm consists of six acres, worth 
L. 3 each, but at present rented at only L. 15. The glebe of 
Kilbucho was sold: it contains about 10 acres, and brought 
L 551. The interest of the purchase-money is divided betwixt 
the ministers of Culter and Broughton, &amp;c. The principal ought 
to have been laid out in land to augment the present glebes, or,

had it not been for gross mismanagement, 5 per cent, might have 
been obtained. Being now lodged in the Royal Bank, the annual 
return is of course greatly diminished of late years. 

The stipend was 12 chalders of victual, half meal and half bar- 
ley, with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. An augmenta- 
tion of 2 chalders has been recently obtained. 

The number of families attached to the Established church is 
124,— number of persons rather more than 400. The Established 
church is exceedingly well attended. There are only four sece- 
ding or dissenting families in the parish, and two or three single 
persons ; and two of these families have lately come to reside with- 
in the bounds. Three individuals only have gone over to the se- 
ceders or dissenters for the last twenty years. A considerable 
number of seceders and dissenters have returned to the bosom of the 
Established church within the same space of time. One or two 
connected with the Reformed Presbytery reside in the parish, 
and regularly attend the church. There are two or three indivi- 
duals that affect no religious profession, and hardly ever enter a 
place of worship. We are occasionally favoured with a visitation 
from Itinerants, Independents, or members of the Congregational 
Union of Scotland. The inhabitants in general seem well affect- 
.ed to the Establishment. 

Before quitting the subject of the church and manse, we may 
mention, that, when the heritors took the latter off the hands 
of the contractor, they drew up a paper, which was subscribed by 
the principal heritor as preses of the meeting, by which they con- 
signed over the church, manse, and offices to the incumbent, em- 
powering him, when anything went wrong, to employ a tradesman 
w ithout calling any meeting of heritors, and to charge the expense 
to their account. The church has not cost them five shillings a- 
year since it was built, and the manse not fivepence. The road 
to the manse from the public road was made to the march of the 
glebe at the expense of the incumbent, and the rest at that of the 
• public. It cost them about L. 24, and requires nothing to keep 
it up. The path to the church is along three wooden bridges, 
which are supported at little cost, as one of the heritors gives the 
wood for nothing ; and the timber of another bridge over Brough- 
ton burn, forming a communication betwixt the manse and the 
village, is furnished by another heritor. The heritors hardly ever 
lend a deaf ear to any application for the advantage of the parish. 
The number of communicants is about 300.

The yearly contributions to religious or charitable purposes do 
not average above L. 2 per annum, exclusive of the subscriptions 
to the Biggar Bible Society. 

Education.— Notwithstanding the annexation of the parishes, 
the three parochial schools continued on the former footing, sub- 
ject to such alterations as the heritors and presbytery might judge 
proper. The branches professed, besides the ordinary, are Latin, 
geography, and practical mathematics. But Latin is getting out 
of fashion here. There is not a Latin scholar, that is a pupil, in the 

district. . 

The salary of each of the schoolmasters is L. 32, with a house 

and garden. 

The school-fees at Broughton may amount to L. 20 ; at jlen- 
holm to little more than L. 12; and at Kilbucho to about L. 15. 
The school of Kilbucho, owing to a most unhappy misunderstand- 
ing, is at present vacant, but well taught by an interim-teacher, 
who receives the emoluments. 

The school wages are fixed at 2s. a quarter, for reading Eng- 
lish; 2s. 6d. for reading, writing, and arithmetic; and 3s. for the 

higher branches. 

A new school and schoolmaster's house have been recently built, 
but on a niggardly plan, in the parish of Kilbucho. Had the he- 
ritors at the time the annexation was completed, instead of demo- 
lishing the old manses, converted them into schools and school- 
masters' houses, they might have, at a small expense, provided 
ample accommodation to masters and scholars. 

Few have attained to the age of fifteen who cannot both read 
and write. Access to education is granted to all. If the parents 
are unable to pay the fees they are paid by the public or the 
children are taught gratis. Some of the old cannot write, but 

they can all read. 

Friendly Society.- A friendly society was established m the year 
1800, and is still in existence. Its stock amounts to about L. 200. 
Sick members are allowed 3s. 6d. a-week ; superannuated mem- 
bers, L. 2, 12s. per annum ; and widows, L. 1. 

Savings Bank.- A savings bank was instituted here m 181d 
and has prospered. The deposits have averaged more than L. 100 
" ear ; but, as many of the sums exceed the legal amount, the 
Create part has been withdrawn and deposited elsewhere The 
 proportion of depositors are servants, especially females.

When the disbursements exceed the receipts, application is 
made to the heritors within the three years. No demur on the 
part of the heritors ever takes place. It may be added, that, at 
the commencement of winter, the farmers assess themselves in 
meal to the poor, to be given at a reduced rate, or for nothing ; 
and that Mr Swan at Ponfeith coal-works gives occasionally a dona- 
tion of coals, which the tenants lead free of expense. 

It is not in general thought disgraceful to apply for parochial 
assistance. Some apply for relief from the poors' funds whose re- 
lations are by no means in indigent circumstances. But there are 
one or two who would rather almost starve than make their wants 
known. 

Fair — Broughton has an annual fair, held on the 3d of Octo- 
ber. It was once a cattle-market, and distinguished by horse and 
toot races. It is now attended principally for the purpose of hir- 
ing servants, paying accounts, and fixing the prices of butter and 
cheese. The fair is held on the street of the village, and the 
stalls are overloaded with the produce of the orchards of Clydes- 
dale and other merchandize.

commodious house, with a court of offices in good repair. It forms 
a convenient stage betwixt Edinburgh and Moffat ; and in the 
parish of Kilbucho a new inn was lately built. Rachan Mill is al- 
so a public-house, conveniently situated for the accommodation of 
the public, as it stands at the junction of the road from Peebles 
to Moffat with the great road from Edinburgh to Dumfries. There 
is also an alehouse in the village on a smaller scale. 

Fuel. — The distance from fuel is one of the greatest drawbacks 
on the comforts of the public. The coal is mostly brought from 
Ponfeith, which is eighteen miles distant from the centre of the 
parish. Kilbucho moss supplies a number of the farmers there 
with peat. The thinnings of the plantations in the other two di- 
visions of the parish afford a supply of fuel to a few of the neigh- 
bouring poor. The wood is not sold, but given to them gratis. 
12 cwt. of coals may be purchased at the mouth of the pit for 
half-a-crown. The tolls are Is. more, and when the carriage is 
paid for, the cart will cost 12s. 6d. "When the peat-moss is at a 
considerable distance from the residence of the consumer, that 
species of fuel comes nearly as high as coal.

PRESBYTERY OF BIGGAR, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND TWEEDDALE. 

THE REV. JOHN ALPINE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name and Boundaries. — The name has at different periods been 
written Scrawline, Skirlin, Scarlane, and Skirling ; but the origin 
of these various designations cannot now be traced with certainty. 
The parish is only about two miles and a-half in length, the same 
in breadth, and approaches nearly to a square. It is bounded 
on the east by Broughton ; on the south by Kilbucho and Big- 
gar ; on the west by Biggar ; and on the north by Dolphinton and 
Kirkurd. 

The character of its surface is uneven, never rising into any great 
elevation, and never spreading out into any wide extent of plain. 
The soil is generally fertile ; and with a very few spots excepted, 
where there is short heather, even those parts which have been un- 
disturbed by the industry of man, are covered with a lively green. 

Botany. — One rare plant was discovered about two years ago in 
this parish, named the Asperula taurina. It was found by a medical 
gentleman in a mouthful of grass plucked by his horse. It was 
examined by several eminent botanists, who expressed much asto- 
nishment at its being found in the open fields, and with difficulty 
believed that it was not the production of a garden, being found 
in this high latitude, and so far from the sea coast ; where it grew, 
however, no garden had ever been. 

II. — Civil History. 
Historical Notices. — Very few facts are known as to the history of 
this parish. The earliest period to which any known record refers 
is the reign of King Robert Bruce, who granted to John Monfode 
the barony of Scrawline, with the advowson of the church; and in 
this family it seems to have continued a considerable time, for we 
find that a Margaret Monfode, granted an annuity of two merks

Sterling, out of the lands of Scrawline, to a chaplain in the church 
of Dunmanyn, — which grant was confirmed by David II. in 1362. 
From this date there is nothing known till the sixteenth century, 
when the lands of Skirling, with those of Roberton, Newholm, and 
Heeds, in the parish of Dolphinton, were in the possession of the 
Cockburns.  Having passed from them, the barony appears to 
have descended with rapid succession from one family to another, 
for about a hundred years. In 1647, it belonged to Sir James Ha- 
milton of Priestfield. Thence it passed to a Sir James Murray, 
probably one of the Murrays of Stanhope, who then held a power- 
ful sway in this district. "In 1683, David Oswald of Dalders was 
infeft in the lands and barony of Scrawline." At the revolution, 
the estate of Skirling was possessed by a General Douglas of the 
Queensberry family, who, according to tradition, f fell at the battle 
of the Boyne. Immediately after this, it was purchased by John 
first Earl of Hyndford, for his second son, the Honourable William 
Carmichael, and in that line it has continued ever since, the present 
sole proprietor of the parish being Sir Thomas Gibson Carmichael 
of Skirling, Bart.  great-grandson of the Honourable W. Car- 
michael by Helen, his eldest daughter, .married to Sir J. Gibson 
of Durie. 

Parochial Registers.— The date of the earliest parish record is the 
6th of July 1654. From that time till the year 1674, the most 
pointed regularity seems to have been maintained, in recording every 
transaction connected with the session. Afterwards, to the close of 
that century, few entries appear to have been made. On the 23d of 
August 1700, regular registration again commences, and is carried 
on with care down to the 16th of March 1713, when it is again given 
up as to every thing except births : and that, too, ceases to be at- 

. « In December 1513, a cause was heard by the Lords of Council, against WUliam 
Cockburn, laird of Serawline, for taking by violence a part of his own goods, which 
had been escheated and granted to Mathew CampbeU, three verdour beds, an 
arras bed, three pair of sheets, a buird-claith of Dormk, a damask table-cloth, six 
frocks of Dornik, a linen buird-claith, a feather bed, with a bolster and four cods 
Sows, two verdour beds, a pair of fustian blankets, a ruff and curtains, two , pair of 
beets one pair of blankets of small white, a feather bed and two saddles, wifl «r 
repairings, all which goods extend by good estimation to thirty pounds Scottish 

traXion:, tfa't immediately before his leaving Skirling y he called 
iJ inhabitants together. All were alarmed, supposing that in the might of feudal 
a S which T then was little diminished, he was about to draft the stoutest to 
haTe Tn he p riS in whrch he was about to engage : but it was merely to take an 
aSionat farewell of them, and advise them to the maintenance of brotherly kmd-

tended to in the month of April 1719, and in the last entry made 
the date is omitted. After this there is a complete chasm till 1750, 
from which period the records are regularly and carefully kept. 
The population being small, the parochial registers are not volu- 
minous. 

Antiquities. — Various ancient coins of the reigns of Adrian and 
Antoninus were found about twenty years ago near a place called 
Greatlaws, in the north-east, quarter of the parish : they are now 
in the possession of Laurence Brown, Esq. of Edmonstone, La- 
narkshire. Such, we are assured from the recollection of living 
witnesses who had seen them, were the dates of these coins : but 
nothing farther can be ascertained, as the original collector is dead, 
and they, through carelessness, are now intermingled with other si- 
milar relics of the past. Near the same spot, when opening up a 
new communication with the Edinburgh and Dumfries mail-road, 
'about fifteen years ago, the labourers employed came upon some 
graves of very ancient construction. They had at each side, and 
at each end, a whinstone flag, and were covered with slabs of the 
same material. Human bones were found in them, but nothing 
to elucidate the time or the occasion of their formation. 

In another district there are evident traces of a religious esta- 
blishment belonging to Popish times. The very name by which 
the farm in which it is situated is at present known bears testi- 
mony to this, — Kirklawhill being clearly corrupted from Kirk-land- 
hill. Part of the ruins still remains. Its extent appears to have 
been considerable ; but with what abbey it might be connected, 
and whether its chapel might be the one then called Dunmanyn, 
Dunmanyn signifies in Celtic the hill of the maiden, or of the 
good maiden, to which Margaret Monfode made a bequest for 
the support of a chaplain, when it flourished, and when it de- 
cayed, it is impossible to say, for its history is lost in obscurity. 

Of the house or castle of Skirling, to which reference is made 
in the former Statistical Report, nothing now remains to arrest the 
stranger's eye. All that might give a melancholy interest to the 
spot is utterly swept away. Its very foundation-stones, embracing 
more than a rood of land, are removed, and the plough may be 
seen passing over, and cattle grazing, where lady fair once sat, and 
stalwart knight once trode. While, however, it has thus vanished 
away, something is still known as to the causes and progress of its 
decline. Its possessor in the sixteenth century, Sir James Cock- 
burn of Skirling, was married to a sister of Lord Herries, and wa,s.

not only thus connected with Queen Mary's party, but even had 
the honourable station assigned to him of holding the castle of 
Edinburgh in her name,  and was appointed one of her commis- 
sioners at the conference at York. The downfal of her power was 
accordingly ruinous to him, and being deeply involved in the efforts 
made in behalf of the imprudent and unfortunate queen, he was pe- 
culiarly obnoxious to the triumphant party, and, by the command 
of the Regent Murray, his castle was demolished by a strong mili- 
tary force on the 12th of June 1568 ; and being thus overthrown 
it was never afterwards rebuilt and reinhabited, but was left to the 
destructive energies of time, and the unsparing hand of the spoiler 
till its desolation was completed. Though the property afterwards 
belonged to the Cockburns, they returned not to dwell in the an- 
cient home of their fathers, but inhabited, as did likewise some of 
the succeeding proprietors, a house in the village, which, like its 
more venerable predecessor, has now also entirely disappeared. 

Eminent Men. — Mr Howe, son to the late clergyman of this pa- 
rish, has attained to high eminence in his profession as a painter. 
His panoramic representation of the Battle of Waterloo command- 
ed general admiration at the time of its exhibition ; and in the 
department of animal painting he stood for many years without a 
rival. — Nor must we pass over one who, though he was born, 
and continued in a humble sphere of life, is entitled to an honour- 
able remembrance. In the disastrous days of the persecution un- 
der the cold-blooded Stuarts, Peter Gillies, of the Wauk Mill, 
Skirling, was one of those who were devoted unto death in the sa- 
cred cause. Having had a presbyterian minister preaching in his 
house, he was, in 1674, hunted from his home by Sir James Mur- 
ray, the laird, and Mr James Buchan, the curate. For several 
years he wandered about from place to place. At last he was ap- 
prehended in the month of April 1685, at Muiravonside, was car- 
ried by the lawless soldiery to the west country, and, after endur- 

 The castle of Edinburgh was surrendered to Cockburn of Skirling for the queen. 
The same day the wind blew away the weathercock of the steeple of St Giles. This, 
saith Birrel in his Diary, fulfilled an old prophecy, 

Quhen Skirlin sail be captain, 
The cock sail lose his tail. 

In the Life of Q,ueen Mary, by H. G. Bell, Vol. ii. page 168, when reference is 
made to Anderson, Vol. iv. Part ii. page 33, Sir James Cockburn of Stirling is 
named among the commissioners : but this is a mistake, arising from the similarity 
of the orthography, the difficulty of deciphering old records, and from the prominency 
of the one place in our national history, while the other is almost unknown. Upon 
examining the original manuscript with this key, and comparing it with collateral 
facts, it will be found that it was Sir James Cockburn of Skirling — The present ce- 
lebrated Solicitor General is, wc believe, one of the descendants of this family.

ing many insults, and much cruelty, was, on the 6th of May, exe- 
cuted at Mauchline. " No coffins" saith the venerable Wod- 
row  " were allowed, nor dead-clothes, but the soldiers and two 
countrymen made a hole in the earth, into which they cast him, 
together with other four, his fellow-martyrs."

It is worthy of remark, that there is one woman, a widow, in the 
parish, now in her ninety-fourth year, and that about two years 
ago the writer of this account met her in her own house, along 
with her three brothers and her sister, all children of the 
same father and mother, and all hale and healthy, though their 
united ages amounted to 438 years. 

Character and Habits of the People. — As to the outward cir- 
cumstances of the people of this parish we must report very fa- 
vourably. While there are some who can afford to live in the 
most comfortable manner, there is the absence of every thing like 
squalid poverty ; for, even in our humblest cottages, through the 
abounding beneficence of Sir Thomas G. Carmichael, poverty in 
its sterner features is not seen. The general fare of our peasantry, 
though plain, is agreeable and wholesome : and having in a rea- 
sonable degree the means of subsistence, and being enabled to 
clothe themselves in decent apparel, they show themselves con- 
tented with their condition and circumstances. They are at the 
same time cleanly in their habits, orderly in their deportment, and 
attentive to the observances, while many of them, I trust, are ac- 
quainted with the power, of religion. 

During the last three years there has not been a single illegi- 
timate birth in the parish.

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — By a plan of the parish, tak- 
en by Mr Bell of Edinburgh, and lying in the possession of the 
proprietor at Castle- Craig, it appears that the measurement of 
the parish in Scotch acres is 2642. Of these there are under 
cultivation 2072 acres ; 320 capable of a profitable cultivation, 
were the markets to become a little more favourable ; and 250 in- 
capable of a profitable cultivation ; in undivided common, 8 ; un- 
der wood, 27. The trees planted are ash, elm, beech, plane, and 
fir of different descriptions. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of arable land, per acre, is 
15s. ; of sheep-walk, 2s. 6d. per acre. 

Rate of Wages. — The rate of labour for agricultural purposes is, 
for hired male-servants, per year, from L. 8 to L. 12 ; hired female 
do. in summer, from L.3 to L.3, 15s., and in winter, from L. 1, 
15s. to L.2, 5s. 

Breeds of Live-Stock. — The few sheep kept are of the black- 
faced description, and form but an inconsiderable item. As stock, 
they have, we believe, received but little attention ; but the dairy 
being here a principal source of income to the cultivators of the 
soil, the cows, chiefly of the Ayrshire breed, are objects of great 
care, and so attentive have the farmers been to their improvement, 
that at the neighbouring exhibition at Biggar not a few of the 
prizes annually fall among us. 

Husbandry. — The system of cultivation pursued is of the most 
approved character. The rotation followed is that which has 
found most favour with experienced and intelligent judges in mo- 
dern times. Lime, though brought from a distance, is much em- 
ployed ; and draining and irrigation, so far as they are practicable 
and profitable, are highly popular. From the spirit of activity in- 
troduced, there are not many acres remaining unreclaimed which 
could be cultivated with profit, while grain is so low in price ; and 
there are a few spots now under the plough of a rather thin soil, 
which perhaps would yield a better return in pasture than in crop. 

The farm-buildings, though not so excellent as in some other 
parts of the country, are in general commodious and suitable to 
the requirements of their occupants. The leases are ordinarily 
of nineteen years' duration ; and though probably too short where 
there is much new land to be broken up, they seem sufficiently an- 
swerable in the circumstances in which husbandry ha already 
been placed.

Produce. — As to the average gross amount of raw produce, we 
give the following as a probable approximation to the truth : 

Raised in the parish of oats and barley, value - L. 3088 0 0 

Potatoes and turnips, - 998 0 0 

Pasture, - - - - 918 0 0 

Rye-grass and meadow-hay, - - 610 0 0 

Total yearly value of raw produce, - L. 5614 0 0 

The present rental of the parish is about L. 1500 a-year: but 
as nearly one-third of the parish is let on an old nineteen years' 
lease, a considerable rise may be expected at its termination. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Means of Communication. — The length of the turnpike roads in 
the parish is three miles ; and there are five bridges. The means 
of communication are good, as we have excellent roads in all direc- 
tions. The nearest market-town is Biggar, distant two miles. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is very conveniently si- 
tuated, the house most distant from it being within two miles. 
At what time it was built it is impossible to say ; but it seems to 
have undergone large repairs in the year 1720, and is at present 
in a state of decent repair. It has sittings for upwards of 200 per - 
sons : four of these are free ; but as the people are very regular in 
their attendance, some families are complaining of a want of accom- 
modation. Perhaps something might be done to remedy this evil, 
by a slight alteration of the allocation of seats. 

The manse was built in 1803, and is commodious and elegant. 
The glebe is an excellent one, and has been made so chiefly by 
the exertions of the present incumbent. In the former Account of 
the parish, it is stated that the house of Skirling was surrounded 
by a morass : and when the present manse was erected, it was con- 
sidered better to fix its site near to this, than to have it in the vil- 
lage, where the former one stood. In consequence of this, an ex- 
change of land was proposed and effected under the authority of 
the presbytery, — twenty-four acres, from the difference in quality, 
being given for eight, the extent of the old glebe. This bog, or 
rather quagmire, for into various parts of it neither man nor beast 
could then penetrate, came thus into the minister's possession, and 
he, instantly and vigorously commencing a system of draining, and 
drawing the different springs to one point, from which they flow off 
in a considerable rivulet, has succeeded in reducing it to a dry and 
fertile state. A stronger proof of the improvement effected cannot 
be given, than by the simple statement, that though land generally 
cannot be rated higher, it was valued by good judges at L.24 when

transferred to him, but is now worth L. 72 at a moderate calcula- 
tion. It is now beyond doubt a great advantage to him, and this, 
with 14 chalders of victual, one half meal and the other half bar- 
ley, together with L. 8, 6s. 8d. allowed for communion elements, 
forms the living of the incumbent. The stipend for 1832 amounted 
to L.193, 4s. 

The number of families and persons attending the Established 
church, and the chapels of dissenters, is as under: 

Number of families attending the Established church, 53 



of persons, - - - 270 

of communicants, - - 160 

of families attending Burgher chapel, - 6 

of persons, 21 

of families attending Relief chapel, - 5 

of persons, - - 23 



It may here be remarked, that what may be considered as the 
fluctuating population of the parish, the servants, adds considerably 
to the numerical strength of the dissenting interest, and that the 
children of some of the parents who belong to the dissenters are 
connecting themselves with the Established church. 

Education. — There is only one school, the parochial, which, 
however, is quite sufficient for the accommodation of the parish. 
The branches of instruction taught in it are English, English gram- 
mar, writing, and arithmetic, practical mathematics, geography, 
Latin, and Greek. The schoolmaster has the full legal accommo- 
dations, the maximum salary, and may receive of school fees, on an 
average, nearly L. 26 per annum. There is a library belonging to 
the school, formed in 1828, and upheld by public subscriptions 
and collections. It contains 142 volumes, and appears to be much 
valued. The annual expense of education is, for English, 10s. ; 
English and writing, 12s. ; English, writing, arithmetic, &amp;c. 14s. ; 
Latin, 22s.; Latin and Greek, 24s. 

The school is excellently taught and well attended, and if there 
be any cause of complaint, it is, that parents are too much inclined 
to take advantage of the improved mode of teaching to shorten the 
attendance of their children, and thus in some instances sacrifice 
the substantial benefit of their children for the present saving of a 
little money. There are only two persons in the parish upwards 
of 15 years of age who cannot read or write : one of these is from 
Ireland, and the other fatuous. 

Friendly Society. — There is in the parish a friendly society for 
the mutual benefit of the members in sickness. It was instituted in 
1800, and has 78 members. Its stock is L. 128, 2s. lljd. It 



SKIRLING. 



107 



gives an allowance of 3s. a-week for the first sixteen weeks of sick- 
ness, and Is. 6d. a-week thereafter, with this proviso, to prevent 
injury to the society, that when any person shall have received 
L. 16, 13s. 8d., his claims shall thenceforth cease and determine. 
It is evidently a very useful institution, often aiding those in dis- 
tress who would otherwise be cast upon the fund of common cha- 
rity ; and I have not the smallest doubt that it has a powerful effect 
in preserving that spirit of independence so beneficial to the inte- 
rests of our country. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of poor upon 
the session's roll is five; weekly allowance to each, Is. 3d. ; annual 
amount of collections made in the church on their behalf, no mort- 
cloth or extra profits included, L. 11, 10s. 6d. This is the only 
fund from which they are supplied, and any deficiencies that may 
occur are met by the liberality of Sir Thomas G. Carmichael, the 
proprietor. The number has been larger than usual for some years, 
and may be expected to decrease; but the diminution is to be looked 
for chiefly from the natural effects of time, in the removal of those 
advanced in life, of whom the list of paupers is at present principally 
made up, and not, we fear, in any indisposition generally to apply 
to this source of relief. It is still, without question, considered to 
a certain extent degrading to come upon the parish, and there are 
some who would submit to very severe privations ere they would 
consent to receive public aid ; but the feeling of delicacy upon this 
point is certainly not nearly so intense as it was in former times. 

Prisons. — There is a jail in the parish, the proprietor having a 
baron-bailie appointed, who has the power of imprisoning for forty- 
eight hours, but fortunately it is required only for holding the mort- 
safes and other parochial implements. 

Fairs. — There are fairs held here on the third Tuesday after 
the 11th of May, on the first Wednesday after the 11th of June, 
and on the 15th of September. The first of these is a small mar- 
ket now limited to cattle, but the other two, especially that in June, 
have a large attendance of queys, cows, and horses, and there is 
much business done. At a former period we had a fair also on the 
Tuesday before the 12th of May, which now has no existence 
save in the almanack, and at a still more remote date the market 
for sheep, hogs, now held at Linton the day before the third Wed- 
nesday after the 11th of June, was held at Skirling. The traces 
of the bughts are still to be seen, and not long since an aged per- 
son died who recollected distinctly his having seen more than once 



108 



PEEBLES-SHIRE 



the bustle of the sheep fair. Why it was removed cannot now be 
accurately ascertained, but it may possibly be accounted for, in 
the tendency of the seller in dull times to draw towards the buyer ; 
and about eighty or ninety years ago, the demand being small 
might induce store farmers to make a nearer approach to those 
arable districts of the country, where they could secure an outlet 
for the extra produce of their stock. 

Inns. — There are two inns, clean and comfortable, for the accom- 
modation of the people attending the markets. 

Fuel. — There is scarcely such a thing as peat, the principal if not 
sole fuel being coal. It is brought from Douglas and Wilsontown, 
both places being nearly fourteen miles distant. In consequence 
of the long drive, it costs when laid down here at the rate of 2s. 4d. 
per load, or about 8d. per cwt. By the wealthier this evil is not 
so sensibly felt, but it presses hard upon the poorer class, and were 
it not for the attention of Sir T. Carmichael in clearing all the 
direct outlay, and of the tenantry in driving coals for them, they 
would necessarily and frequently find themselves sufferers from 
the inclemency of winter. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

In the Statistical Account given by the late Rev. Mr Howe, it 
is stated that every farmer sowed five or six lippies of flax seed, and 
those having small possessions and even cottages two or three lip- 
pies, but now this article has scarcely a name among the produc- 
tions of the parish. Cottagers and smaller tenants grow no lint, 
and it is rarely to be met with on any of the larger farms, as it is 
considered more profitable to purchase it dressed or manufactured 
into the fabric than to incur the necessary expenses of raising it at 
home. The great advance of rent not only intimates that changes 
favourable to the prosperity of the nation have been passing during 
the last forty years, but likewise that agricultural industry and im- 
provement have been progressing. The ten smaller possessions 
around the village which formerly were rented at L. 1 and L. 1, 5s. 
an acre, now rate as high as L. 3 and L. 4 ; and the average rental 
over the whole parish, instead of 4s. is now 15s. ; while, from any 
thing we can learn, the tenant has far less difficulty in answering 
the money demands made upon him by the proprietor, and has 
received a mighty addition to his personal, family, and domestic 
comforts. 

But though much has already been done, there are still improve- 
ments of great benefit which remain to be accomplished. Within 



SKIRLING. 



109 



these thirty years, at great expense, and with much labour in banking 
and draining, upwards of 100 acres have been raised from a boggy 
barren condition, yielding a little coarse dry hay, into a very pro- 
ductive state, and, by deepening Biggar water, which lies on the 
southern boundary, eighteen inches or two feet, up from Brough- 
ton bridge, that already reclaimed would be rendered a great deal 
more fertile, and more would be recovered in this parish, while in 
those adjacent several hundred acres would be gained. The thing 
has been proposed, and we have no doubt as to its ultimate accom- 
plishment. 

There is another thing which demands attention, and that is the 
present want of plantations and fences. Were these in greater 
abundance, while they would afford shelter, a thing greatly needed 
generally in Scotland, they would likewise render Skirling one of the 
sweetest parishes in her mountainous domains; nor are we without 
good expectations that this will not be long overlooked. There are 
a number of farms let upon tacks of fifty-seven years' duration, and 
these, unfortunately, are so scattered up and down, as every where 
to fetter the proprietor in the free exercise of his pleasure, but 
they are how drawing to a close; and from the well-known disposition 
of Sir Thomas Carmichael to do what is for the advantage of his 
estates, and from what he has actually done on his property in the 
parish of Kirkurd, we anticipate the period when the ditcher shall 
be preparing the thorn-bed, and the diker shall be plying his ham- 
mer, and the planter his spade, and the bleakness of the unenclosed 
plain, and the unwooded hill, shall no longer glare upon the eye of 
the observer.

PRESBYTERY OF PEEBLES, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND TWEEDDALE. 

THE REV. JAMES CRUICKSHANK, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name and Boundaries. — The name of this parish is at present 
spelt Manner or Manor ; but it appears from the parochial regis- 
ters, of which the earliest entry is dated 1663, — and from a great 
number of family papers in the possession of the principal heritor, 
some of which are dated 1573, — that the first-mentioned ortho- 
graphy was established by the usage of centuries, and continued 
until the publication of the last parochial Account. The origin of 
the name is uncertain. 

The parish extends from S. W. to N. E. nine miles, and ave- 
rages about three. It is bounded on the N. E. by Peebles ; on 
the S. E. by Yarrow; on the S. by Megget; on the S. W. by 
Drummelzier; and on the W. and N. W. by Stobo. The dis- 
trict consists of the vale which is traversed by the stream called 
« Manner Water," and of part of the mountainous range which 
skirts it on either side. 

Topographical Appearances.— The rivulet just named takes its 
rise among the mountains which bound the parish towards the 
south, and pursuing a rapid and circuitous course, falls into the 
Tweed, about two miles above the town of Peebles. Two hills, 
of which one is wholly and the other partly situated in this parish, 
stand unconnected with the neighbouring range, and, excepting a 
similar one in an adjoining parish, are the only hills of this descrip- 
tion which are to be found within the limits of the county. 

The acclivities of the several hills composing the chain are in 
general steep; and some of the cliffs fronting the stream near its 
source, and approaching closely to each other, are very lofty and 
precipitous. The outline of the less elevated part of the range 
is undulating, while the loftiest summits are round-backed. The 
highest peaks are those of Dollar-law and Scrape, from which an 
extensive view is commanded of the Lothians, Berwickshire, and 



MANNER. 



the English borders. The former of these eminences, according 
to Armstrong, is 2840 feet above the level of the sea, and is, there- 
fore, higher than Hartfell in the adjoining parish of Tweedsmuir. 
The lower part of the range may vary from 1600 to 1900 feet above 
the sea-level. 

Meteorology. — Cold easterly winds often prevail during the 
spring; but the most prevalent are the S. and S. W. winds, — 
the position of the hills on either side of the deep valley giving 
a direction to the current of air, which sweeps down through it as 
through a funnel, and frequently with terrific violence. 

The climate at such a lofty elevation is of course comparatively 
late, though the harvest in this parish is earlier than in some others 
which are contiguous, — a fact which may be accounted for by the 
peculiar position and configuration of the hills, from the steep ac- 
clivities of which, — covered in many places with loose stones, — the 
rays of the sun are reflected in summer with great intensity on the 
cultivated grounds beneath. The frosts, however, are early and 
long continued ; and the district is exposed to a kind of partial 
frost in the end of August and beginning of September, which 
chiefly affects the low-lying lands on the border of the stream. It 
counterbalances in some degree the disadvantages of the climate, 
that the air is particularly dry and salubrious, and epidemical dis- 
eases are almost unknown to the inhabitants of this parish. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — Wherever the rock of which the 
mountain-range is composed breaks the surface, it consists almost 
entirely of greywacke. As the rock is exposed but in a few places 
to such an extent as to admit of accurate and sufficiently numerous 
observations being made with regard to the position of its strata, 
which in some localities are variously waved, there is considerable 
difficulty in distinguishing their partial from their general direc- 
tion' and inclination. On comparing the results of many particu- 
lar observations, it appears that the general direction of the strata 
is north and south, and that they dip to the west, forming an angle 
of inclination amounting to nearly 45°. A bed of clay-slate, in 
some places much indurated, ranging from one to five feet in 
thickness, and preserving the same general direction, dip, and incli- 
nation, as those of the circumjacent greywacke, runs across the 
lower extremity of this parish, and seems to communicate with the 
slate formation in the adjoining parish of Stobo. 

The greywacke has not been quarried to any considerable extent, 
and few imbedded minerals have been detected.

PEEBLES-SHIRE. 



Very rich specimens of galena have been found in boulders in 
the channel of the stream, and the existence of it in situ, in one 
particular spot, has also been ascertained ; but though an attempt 
to mine it was at one time commenced, it was ultimately abandoned. 

From the centre of the vale towards its north-eastern extremity, 
which is bounded by the Tweed, there occur alluvial deposits of 
considerable extent, consisting principally of clay and loam. On 
grounds of every elevation in the parish, but chiefly in the higher 
districts, and often on a declivity, moss is found deposited in beds 
varying in depth from one to ten feet,— that part of it which lies 
lowest being perfectly black and of great solidity, while towards 
the surface it is in most cases spongy, and of a brownish colour. 
Along the margin of the stream, the deposits are chiefly of gra- 
vel, with an occasional thin stratum of moss, lying on a thick sub- 
stratum of blue clay. 

Soils. — On some of the more elevated pasture-grounds, the soil 
is principally composed of moss, with a small admixture of sand, 
and gives sustenance to little beside heath ; but the most extensive 
portion of pasture-ground, and that also which is of greatest ele- 
vation, consists of soil but slightly impregnated with moss, and 
which is favourable to the growth of grasses. These grasses ac- 
cordingly cover its whole extent, except where, on steep declivities, 
loose fragments of stone in extensive masses impede vegetation. 

Where the hilly ridges begin to decline into the valley, there 
predominates a thin soil of sand and clay, slightly mingled with 
loam, resting on a subsoil of gravel ; and of this character is a great 
proportion of the land which has been brought under cultivation. 

The clayey and loamy soils, which occupy the flats and the gen- 
tle acclivities towards the lower extremity of the parish, are in ge- 
neral of inconsiderable depth. 

Zoology.— The following is a list of quadrupeds and birds that 
have been seen in the parish, which are either rare in Scotland, 
or the comparative numerical distribution of which it may be de- 
sirable to ascertain. 

rat. The Black rat, Mus rattus, is 
extinct. 

Sciurus vulgaris, Squirrel. Introduced 
on the North Esk from England. Ra- 
ther rare.

Falco cyaneus, Blue-hawk or Hen-har- 
rier. 

Falco uEsalon, Merlin. 

-» Nisus, Sparrow-hawk. 

peregrinus, Hunting-hawk. Builds 

regularly on Posso Craigs. This was 
a royal eyrie during the reign of some 
of the last of the Jameses ; and the 
breed of hawks procured from it was 
in such high repute as to be esteemed 
superior to any in Scotland, and equal 
to the finest brought from Norway. 

Falco pygargus. The Ring-tail is the 
female Falco pygargus, and is often 
mistaken for a different species. 



Fringilla Carduelis, Goldfinch. This 
bird had become very rare here, as it 
has in most districts of Scotland, but 
this winter a great number has been 
seen. 

Loxia pyrrhula, Bulfinch. Common. 
Phasianus Colchicus, Pheasant. Abund- 
ant. 

Rallus crex, Corn-rail. Common. 
Scolopax arquata, Curlew. Plentiful.

frequently. 
Strix aluco, Grey do. Frequently seen. 
Sturnus cinclus, Water Ouzel. 
Tetrao Scoticus, Red Grouse'. \ abund- 

Tetrix, Black-cock. J ant. 

Turdus Merula, Blackbird. ~ 

musicus, Thrush.  numerous 

pilaris, Fieldfare. } 

torquatus, Ring Ouzel. 



Vultur albicilla, more correctly designated Falco albicilla, the 
Earne, once frequented the cliffs at the head of the parish, but 
disappeared from it several years since. 

In a late edition of White's Natural History of Selborne, the 
editor enumerates several accidental varieties pi British birds, among 
which he had himself seen a mottled blackbird, white crows, a 
white robin, a white sparrow, and a white jackdaw. Similar va- 
rieties of the pheasant have been noticed here for several succes- 
sive years, some entirely white, and others pied or speckled. Four 
birds, two of them white and the others variegated, have been seen 
in the same covey. 

Fishes. — Salmon come up the " Manner water" in great abun- 
dance to deposit their spawn, about the month of October ; and we 
are afraid that few of them are allowed to return to sea. When 
the stream has subsided after a flood, and become sufficiently clear 
to admit of the fish being seen, bands of poachers, armed with their 
long-shafted tridents,  called " leisters," may be seen, sometimes 
during the day, but oftener by the red glare of their torches during 
the night, beating every foot of the water for their prey, which, 
after a fatiguing run of sixty miles, are transfixed without much 
effort at escape. The number of fishes which, from the month of 
October to that of February, are thus slaughtered in an unwhole- 
some condition, and generally before they have time to spawn, is 
almost incredible. Upwards to the source of the Tweed, and a 
considerable way down the river, as well as in many of its tribu- 

PEEBLES. H

taries which are of sufficient size to allow the salmon to ascend, 
this practice prevails, — very partially, if at all, checked by the pro- 
prietors, who might be supposed to have an interest in putting into 
effect the existing laws against such offenders. The fact is, — so 
few salmon find their way during the open season above the site of 
the various fisheries on the Tweed, that the proprietors of land 
situated farther up the river have no interest in their preservation 
during the period of spawning ; and hence this system of poach- 
ing continues to check, in an incalculable degree, the increase of 
this valuable fish, and to encourage the worthless habits of the 
many idlers who, during the winter months, thus injure their health 
and dissipate their time. 

About fifteen or twenty years ago, this parish was reckoned one 
of the finest localities in Scotland for angling, but within that period, 
the notoriety of " Manner water" has attracted so many anglers to 
its banks, and it has been so often and unsparingly swept by the 
small hoop and drag-net of the poacher, that except in autumn, 
when a few salmon and sea-trout make their way up, little is to be 
found except pars, which still swarm in shoals. The fine yel- 
low and dark-coloured burn trout, once so abundant in the Man- 
ner, are now scarcely to be seen here, except in the deep pools of 
some of its small tributaries. 

II. — Civil History. 

Eminent Persons. — We are not aware of any very eminent cha- 
racter connected with this parish, unless David Ritchie, the well- 
known prototype of the " Black Dwarf," is to be considered as such. 
With this individual Sir W. Scott became acquainted in the course 
of his frequent visits at Hallyards, the seat of the late venerable 
Professor Ferguson. He was buried in the churchyard of Man- 
ner : his cottage and garden walls built by himself, and now ob- 
jects of interest to the tourist, are preserved in exactly the same 
state as when he died. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners are, James Burnett, Esq. 
of Barns; Sir John Nasmyth of Posso; Thomas Horsburgh, Esq. 
of that Ilk; Andrew Ballantine, Esq. of Woodhouse; John Ker, 
Esq. of Hundleshope ; Mungo Campbell, Esq. of Hallyards and 
Ballenridge. 

Parochial Registers.— The earliest entry in these registers, which 
seem in some respects to have been kept with considerable regu- 
larity, is dated 1663. 

Antiquities.— There exist within the parish the remains oi two

ancient camps, so considerable in extent, and of such distinct con- 
figuration, that a circumstantial account of them seems to deserve 
a place here, especially as the more remarkable of the two does 
not appear to have been noticed in any previous publication, and 
as the origin of the other, which has been alluded to by several 
writers, has been, by all of them, certainly mistaken. The more 
extensive camp is situated near the farm-house of Cademuir, and 
must have commanded the pass which diverges from the vale of 
Manner, and .leads eastward in the direction of Peebles. A steep 
and lofty hill rises on either side of the camp, and at a little dis- 
tance from it ; and a morass, existing within the memory of some 
of the present inhabitants, extended from the foot of either hill 
to the extremities of the circumvallations. These last, which 
are semicircular mounds of earth, and which, by that form, seem 
to indicate that they are of British or Danish origin, consist of an 
interior semicircle, measuring about 80 paces from the one extre- 
mity to the other, and of four curvilineal fortifications, about 5 paces 
broad, as many high, and 106 in length. A road, 5 paces in 
breadth, leads from the centre of the inner semicircle, directly 
west, and bisects the exterior lines, which are 12 paces apart. If 
any trenches and mounds corresponding to these and connected 
with them, existed on the east, they have disappeared. 

The other camp occupies a commanding site upon Chester's 
hill, a steep conical eminence, nearly a mile distant from the in- 
trenchments which we have described. The fortifications consist 
of loose stones piled upon each other to a breadth varying from 
9 to 1 1 paces, and within the last twenty years, were upwards of 
5 feet high. The exterior wall is of an elliptical figure and mea- 
sures 222 paces in circumference, within which there is another 
wall of a circular shape, occupying nearly the whole breadth of 
the circumscribing fortification, and, forming of course two cres- 
cents at the extremities of the latter. Within the compass of the 
circle, the ground seems to have been hollowed out artificially, the 
excavation deepening towards the centre. In the last Statistical 
Account of the parish, and in a Gazetteer lately published of some 
celebrity, these are pronounced to be the remains of a Roman 
camp : and it is also stated in these publications that an urn con- 
taining a quantity of Roman coins was dug out of the ruins se- 
veral years ago. It is now very difficult to find any of these coins, 
but one which was examined by the writer of this account proved, to 
his surprise, to be an English coin, and bore he name of one of

the Edwards, clearly enough impressed around its border. This 
fact, as well as the form of the circumvallations, which differs froir 
that of all the camps which are certainly known to have been form- 
ed by the Romans, and which were invariably quadrilateral, forbids 
the supposition that the one which we are describing is of Roman 
origin, — an idea very likely to have been originally suggested by 
the name " Chesters," which might seem to be a corruption of the 
. Latin " Castra." 

While upon this subject we may add, that several silver coins of 
Queen Elizabeth have been found by workmen engaged in making 
roads near the camp on Chesters hill. 

Besides the fortifications already-mentioned, three other circular 
entrenchments, of much smaller dimensions, are severally visible 
upon Houndhill, Woodhouse, and Ring-knoll of Hall- Manner; but 
these appear to have been erected for the protection of live-stock 
during the incursions of the English, which, owing to the proxi- 
mity of this district to the borders of England, were very frequent. 

There still remain the ruins of some of the fortified residences 
of the chieftains ; which formed a confederate chain of beacon- 
towers, extending from one extremity of the parish to the other, 
and from whose fire-proof summits the signals of smoke by day, 
and fire during the night, proclaimed, in the course of a few mi- 
nutes, to the whole inhabitants of the vale, the approach of the 
English moss-troopers. Of these towers, there were originally 
six, succeeding each other in the following order,— the first men- 
tioned being situated at the head of the parish: Mannerhead, 
Dollarburn, Langhaugh, Horse-hope-shank, Castle-hill, and Ca- 
verhill. This last communicated with Niedpath castle on the 
Tweed downwards, and with the beacon-tower at Lyne upwards, 
which was the first in that direction both for Tweed and Lyne 
« water" In addition to these, there were houses of defence, 
Peel-houses, at St Gordian's or Gorgham's kirk, Old Posso, 
Glenrath, town of Manner, Woodhouse, and Barns— the last of 
which is still preserved entire. That at Posso seems to have been 
more extensive and modern than the others; and the one at Towu 
of Manner was generally called the Temple House, from the cir- 
cumstance of it, and part of the adjoining lands, having at one 
time belonged to the knights of that order. 

The route which was pursued by the border freebooters, against 
whose incursions this defensive system was chiefly adopted, is still 
distinguished by the name of the « Thief s Road." It passes along 



MANNER. 



117 



the heights of Mannerhead and Dollar-Law to the north end of 
Scrape, and crossing Tweed below Stobo, runs northward in the 
direction of Lyne, Newlands, and Linton. Dollar- Law, just men- 
tioned, seems to have derived its name from being the site of a 
battle, and was popularly called Dolefu' Law or Doleur-Law. 

The antiquities which remain to be noticed are, the Standing 
Stone, a rude obelisk, " with uncouth sculpture deck'd," which, 
having been removed from the situation which it originally occu- 
pied, was built into the wall by the side of the parish road, and is 
supposed to be an aboriginal monument ; the " Font Stone " 
which stood in St Gordian's chapel " while yet the church was 
Rome's," but was afterwards removed to mark the spot where 
three lairds' lands met; the " Giant's Grave," a tumulus which 
has never been opened ; and, lastly, " some appearance of a build- 
ing," says Armstrong, " on the summit of Woodhill, called Mac- 
beth's Castle," but which, that statist, in despair of making any 
thing of the vague popular tradition respecting the famed Scot- 
tish tyrant, believes to have been consecrated for the worship of 
Woden by the Druids, whose memory cannot be held in sufficient 
reverence, for the relief which they afford to many a puzzled an- 
tiquary.

Character of the People. — From the nat ure of their employments 
shepherds have occasionally a good deal of leisure, which that class 
of individuals in this parish and they form a very remarkable part 
of its population devote to the improvement of their minds by read- 
ing, instead of indulging in idleness or immorality : and of them, 
and of the people in general, it may be justly said, that their cha- 



118 



PEEBLES-SHIRE. 



racter, intellectual as well as moral, stands deservedly high. They 
testify a deep and habitual regard to the public ordinances of re- 
ligion ; and there appears to be good reason for believing, that the 
" form of godliness," which is so prevalent among them, is intimate- 
ly and extensively associated with its " power." Such is then- 
general character : but it must be added, that 3 illegitimate births 
have occurred in the parish during the last three years. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Economy. — 

The number of acres, standard imperial measure, in the parish, which are either cul- 
tivated or occasionally in tillage, is - - - - 1630 

The number of acres that might be cultivated with a profitable application of 

capital, 200 

Number of acres under wood, - 400 

The number of acres in pasture cannot be correctly stated. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of arable land in the parish 
may be estimated at L. 1, 5s. per acre. The average rent of graz - 
ing a full-grown sheep, pastured for the year, 5s. At the time of 
the last Statistical Account, the rental of the parish was L.1685; 
now it is L. 4145. 

Breeds of Live-Stock.— A large proportion of the sheep in the 
parish, which amount in whole to about 7400, is of the black faced 
or mountain breed ; but some of the farmers have introduced a 
cross-breed between these and the Cheviot stock, and the former 
have thus been very much improved. Upwards of a third of the 
whole stock in this parish consists of the breed formed by this cross. 
During the last war, when high prices were obtained for the wool 
of Cheviot sheep, an attempt was made to domesticate this species, 
on the higher and more exposed pasture-grounds, but, in conse- 
quence of their delicacy, they were not found to thrive. It is 
thought, that if care had been taken to breed in the stock gradu- 
ally, the experiment would have met with that success which has 
attended it when made in some similar districts. The short-horned 
breed of cattle introduced by Mr Burnett of Barns is now in great 
demand. 

Since the publication of last report, very extensive improve- 
ments have been made in draining and reclaiming waste land. At 
the period alluded to, there were very few enclosures ; but at pre- 
sent, the whole of the land which is of good quality is well enclosed 
and subdivided. Irrigation has been successfully practised to some 
extent. 

The great improvements which we have alluded to as having 



MANNER. 



119 



taken place in the agricultural state of the parish have been prin- 
cipally brought about by Mr Burnett, to whom a third part of the 
property in it belongs. Besides greatly ameliorating his land by 
draining and fencing in the most admirable manner, he has re- 
claimed an immense portion of waste ground, and planted more 
than two-thirds of the whole wood in the parish. The very ex- 
tensive farm of Haswellsikes, belonging to this gentleman, and 
farmed by himself, deserves to be especially noticed, as exhibiting, 
perhaps, the finest model of agricultural management which is to 
be seen in the county. 

Produce. — The average gross amount and value of raw produce 
yearly raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as 
follows : 

255 qrs. of wheat, L. 637 10 0 

500 do. bailey, - - - - 700 0 0 

500 do. peas, - - - - 650 0 0 

1000 do. oats, - - - . 900 0 0 

828 bolls potatoes, at 7s. per boll, - . 289 16 0 

139 acres turnip, at L. 2 10s. per acre, - - 347 10 0 
10400 stones meadow-hay, at 3d. per stone, - 130 0 0 

2720 stones clover-hay, at 6d. - - 68 0 0 

L.3722 16 0 

The number of sheep pastured in the parish is 7400 ; of cattle, 
300 ; of horses, 72. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Means of Communication. — The inhabitants have access, by 
means of a good parish road, to the market-town of Peebles, which 
is not above a mile and a-half distant from the north-eastern ex- 
tremity of Manner. 

There are four stone bridges in the parish, the largest of which 
crosses the Manner water a few hundred yards above the spot where 
that stream falls into the Tweed. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated inconve- 
niently for the population, — being. not more than one mile from the 
lower extremity of the parish, while the other extremity is not less 
than eight miles distant from it. The time at which it was built 
cannot be ascertained. Though very old, it is in a tolerably good 
state of repair. It is capable of affording accommodation for 150 
persons. 

The principal part of the manse was built upwards of twenty 
years ago. The glebe is thirty acres in extent, and, under proper 
management, might be worth from L. 35 to L. 40. The stipen d 



120 



PEEBLES-SHI LIE. 



amounts to L. 113, 3s. ld. of money ; 23 bolls, 2 firlots, 2 pecks, 
ij lippie of barley, and the same quantity of meal. 

The number of families attending the Established church is 30 ; 
of persons of all ages attending that church, 120 ; of persons of 
all ages attending the chapels of Dissenters and Seceders, 38 ; of 
Episcopalians, 7 ; of Roman Catholics, 2. 

Considering the very inconvenient situation of the Established 
church, Divine service there is very well attended. 

The average number of communicants at the Established church 
is 65. 

Education. — The parochial teacher has L. 30 of salary, and 
L. 14 arising from school fees, together with the legal accommo- 
dations. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is 4 ; the average sum allotted to each per 
week, 3s. ; the annual amount of contributions for the relief of the 
poor, L. 15. Of this sum, about L.8, 10s. are collected in the 
church ; L. 3 arise from occasional contributions, and the remain- 
der is supplied by the interest of L. 184, which is the amount of 
our existing poors' fund. 

Inns, Alehouses, fyc— There is not a single inn or alehouse in 
the parish. 

Coal is the kind of fuel principally used in this parish. It is 
generally procured either from White-hill, in Mid-Lothian, or 
from Wilsonton, in the upper ward of Lanarkshire. When brought 
here it costs about Is. per cwt.— two-thirds of the expense being 
occasioned by the carriage. Though there is abundance of peat, 
of good quality, in various parts of the parish, very little of it is 
used by the inhabitants for fuel. 

 It deserves.to be mentioned, that besides these 'here are some who frequently 
attend the Established church, but who communicate with the Dissenters or Seceders.

PRESBYTERY OF PEEBLES, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND TWEEDDALE. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER KER, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The extent of the parish was increas- 
ed after the parish of Dawick was suppressed in 1742, on which 
occasion a part of that parish was annexed to Stobo, and the other 
part of it to the parish of Drummelzier. The length is 7 miles, and 
the greatest breadth 5|. It contains 17 T 9 5 square miles. It is 
bounded on the west and east by the waters Biggar and Lyne; on 
the north and south by the hills, or what is termed the waterfalls 
of the ranges of hills, which run parallel to the river Tweed. From 
the range of hills on the north of the bank, there are three lower 
ranges of hills which run to the south, forming valleys between, with 
streams of water flowing into the Tweed. 

The hills forming these several ranges have separate names. 
The highest are the Pyked Stane, 1884 feet, Benvalla 1850, Bin- 
liga 1692, Flint hill 1621 above the level of the sea. They do not 
appear high, as they rise from a high level. The foot of Pyked 
Stane, where the Stobo burn has its course, is 700 feet above the 
level of the Tweed, where the burn joins it, so that the burn falls 
700 feet in five miles. 

Meteorology. — There is nothing particularly deserving of remark 
in the parish under this head. Among the prognostics of weather 
may be mentioned only one, which is common of course to other 
districts. Goats are said to have a peculiarly instinctive perception 
as to the change of weather. Though they delight to browze 
amongst rocks and high cliffs picking up herbs and eating shrubs, 
of which they have a peculiar relish, yet they are never caught in this 
exposed situation during a storm. If you wish to find them, search 
for a bield or sheltered corner, or recess in the neighbourhood, where 
they have taken up their quarters, and bid defiance to the blast. 

Shepherds of observation, who attend to the manner in which 
their sheep conduct themselves previous to an approaching storm, 
remark that their old sheep or ewes for the hogs are dull and stu- 
pid, have a presentiment of change of weather. 



122 



PEEBLES-SHIRK. 



Hydrography. — There are many perennial springs, some of which 
flow from the earth, and others from rocks. Their temperature is 
46° ; they are very clear, but not very large, and none of them so 
far impregnated with any mineral or chemical substances as that 
these become distinguishable by the taste or smell. 

Tweed is the largest river in the parish. It has its source in the 
parish of Tweedsmuir, at a fountain called Tweedswell, about seven- 
teen or eighteen miles above the uppermost part of the parish. It 
is upwards of twenty yards broad, and on an average about one foot 
and a-half deep at the fords. It enters the parish where Biggar 
water joins it, and at the junction is 615 feet above the level of the 
sea. It leaves the parish where the Lyne water joins it, and at 
the junction is 550 feet above the level of the sea. It runs either 
through or along the parish for seven miles. Its declivity is about 
twelve feet per mile. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — There is a bed of clay-slate in the pa- 
rish which has been worked for centuries. It is of excellent quality, 
and resembles much the slate from the quarries of Ballachulish in 
Argyleshire. Its direction is from west to east, and it dips to the 
south-east. All the other rocks are greywacke, more or less dis- 
tinctlv stratified. 

The slate and greywacke rocks whinstone have been only work- 
ed where they crop out on the surface, and where there is little or 
no soil covering them. 

Soil. — The soil is generally light and gravelly, abounding with 
numerous water-worn stones, especially in the valley of Tweed. In 
some parts the soil is clay, especially on the north parts of the hills, 
and in the best parts at the bottom of the hills. The alluvial soil 
in the haughs of Tweed is various, part being carse-land, part 
sandy or gravelly, evidently the deposit of the river, or what was at 
one time the bed of the river. 

II. — Civil Htstory. 

Accounts, Sj-c. of the Parish. — The only account of the parish, 
besides the former Statistical Account, is to be found in a publica- 
tion entitled " A Companion to Armstrong's Map of the County 
of Peebles," published in 1775. Sir Alexander Murray, once a 
proprietor of Stobo estate, which comprehends now three-fourths 
of the parish, had a plan of it made and engraved about the year 
1734, which is correct, and gives the heights of many of the hills. 

Eminent Persons. — Sir Alexander Murray, Bart, who resided 
in the parish during part of the incumbency of my predecessor, was 
possessed of a most enterprising spirit, and carried on improvements 



STOBO. 



123 



on his estate with an ardour and a taste scarcely equalled among 
his contemporaries. I must mention also the late Lord Chief Ba- 
ron Montgomery, of his Majesty's Exchequer in Scotland, who was 
distinguished not only as an enterprising purchaser and improver, 
but for his great spirit in public undertakings, being always forward 
in encouraging every measure that could contribute to the advan- 
tage and improvement of the county of Tweeddale, over which he 
long presided in all matters of public concern. His remains are 
deposited in the family burying ground in the churchyard of Stobo. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners in the parish are Sir James 
Montgomery of Stanhope, Bart. ; Sir John Nasmyth of Posso, 
Bart.; the Right Honourable the Earl of March and Wemyss; and 
William Gray, Esq. of Brown's Lands. 

Parochial Registers. — The date of the earliest entry of the pa- 
rochial register of births, marriages, and deaths is in the year 1653; 
since that period a register has been regularly kept, and the prin- 
cipal events in the parish briefly recorded. 

Antiquities. — On Sheriffmuir there are two large stones three 
feet in height and six feet distant from each other, which are sup- 
posed to mark the grave of some chief who had there fallenn bat- 
tle. There are also two cairns of stones on this muir, and single 
stones about a foot in height planted at regular distances, which 
some suppose to have been planted to perpetuate the memory of 
some person of distinction, while others regard them as relics of 
Druidical temples. 

There is also to be seen in this muir a large round cavity in the 
form of a basin, called Pinkie's Hole. It is about ninety paces in 
circumference ; and at the time when the former Statistical Account 
was written, it was at the centre between six and seven feet below 
the level of the adjacent plain ; but the depth is now considerably 
less, from the decay of the luxuriant crops of grass in the inside, — 
the grass in the inside being far more luxuriant than on the rim of 
the cavity, probably from the soil being enriched by the decay of 
the bodies therein buried, of those who had fallen in battle. 

This muir, being both centrical for the county and well adapted 
for mustering the Tweeddale militia whilst the unfortunate animo- 
sities subsisted between the sister kingdoms, was the place where 
the sheriff-depute was accustomed to summon them to appear be- 
fore him on a certain day and at an appointed hour; hence it was 
wiled the Sheriff-muir, and still retains the name. 

Modern Bwildings. — Stobo Castle is the chief modern building 
in the parish. The materials generally used for building are whin-

stones for the body of the buildings, ornamented according to taste 
or fashion with freestone. 

III.-'-Population. 
The state of the population previous to the year 1734 cannot 
be traced with any degree of certainty, but from various circum- 
stances there is reason to believe the population is now partly di- 
minished, — but from what causes it is not so easy to determine. 

In 1811, the population was 422

upwards of 70, 8 
Number of bachelors and widowers upwards of 50 years of age, 6 
of widows and unmarried women upwards of 45, - - 4 

The number of families in the parish is 85 ; whereof 41 are 
chiefly engaged in agriculture ; 8 in trade, manufactures, and han- 
dicraft ; and 86 not belonging to either of these classes. 

The only individual of independent fortune resident in the pa- 
rish is Sir James Montgomery of Stanhope, Bart. ; but there are 
four proprietors of land in the parish of the yearly value of L. 50 
and upwards. 

Character of the People.— My residence amongst them has been 
for upwards of sixty years. I have known in the parish many re- 
spectable, benevolent, and kind-hearted parishioners. They are 
gone, and I have mourned their loss. Yet they have left behind 
them successors to whose integrity of life and manners I am hap- 
py to have the opportunity to bear testimony. There is, in one 
word, perhaps, no parish where the moral character and conduct 
of the people are in all respects more uniformly unexceptionable. 

During the last three years there have been, however, two illegi- 
timate births in the parish.

Rent of Land.— The average rent of arable land, per acre, in 
the parish is L. 1. The average rent of grazing, per ox or cow, for 
the year L 3, 10s. The average rent of ewe or full-grown sheep, 
pastured on the hills for one year, 5s. ; on the valleys or improved 
ground for one year, 10s. 

Rateof Wages.— The rate of labour during the summer, per week, 



STOBO.

for farm-labourers, or labourers at the high roads, is 10s. ; and in 
the winter, per week, 9s., they finding their own victuals. Carpen- 
ters are paid at the rate of Is. 6d. per day, summer and winter, 
with their victuals. Tailors are paid at the same rate. Masons 
are paid 2s. 6d. per day, but maintain themselves. 

Husbandry. — All the farms in the parish are stocked with the 
Cheviot breed of sheep, except two, which are stocked with the 
black-faced. In some farms the breeds of cattle have been of late 
improved by crossing them with the Tees- Water and Ayrshire 
breeds. The state of farm-buildings in the parish is generally good : 
and the greater part of the arable ground, which is generally plough- 
ed, is enclosed with stone dikes. The duration of leases is nine- 
teen years. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 
the parish, as nearly as that can be ascertained, is as follows : 

Produce of grain of all kinds, whether cultivated for food of man or the domestic 
. animals, 3600 bolls. 

87 acres potatoes, at L. 6 per acre. L. 222 0 0

As to the produce of land in pasture, there are 1330 acres in that 
state. It may be rated at L. 2, 1 0s. per cow or full-grown 
ox, grazed, or that may be grazed for the season ; at 10s. per 
ewe or full-grown sheep, pastured or that may be pastured 
for the year.

Quarries, - - - -•' - - 6000 

The real rental of the parish is L. 2847. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Means of Communication. — There is a communication between 
Peebles and Stobo weekly, by a carrier, who passes through the 
parish ; and between Edinburgh and Stobo weekly by the same 
means. There is no post-office nearer than Peebles or Rachan 
Mill. There are two turnpike roads in the parish, one of which 
extends towards the west about four miles nearly along the side of 
the river Tweed ; the other upwards of three miles, till it joins 
Kirkurd parish on the north-west, and Ncwlands on the north-east. 

Over Lyne water there are three bridges at a short distance 
from each other ; and on Biggar water, the boundary between 
Stobo and Broughton parishes, there is a bridge, — all of which 
are kept in good repair. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is a Gothic structure of great 
antiquity, and has been evidently erected in times of Popery. For 
a long time the building afforded insufficient and uncomfortable 
accommodation ; but these defects have now been completely re- 



12G 



PEEBLES-SHIR E. 



medied. It affords accommodation to upwards of 200 sitters. 
There are no free sittings. The manse was built in the year 1791. 
The glebe is subdivided, and enclosed with stone dikes and hedges. 
It contains about twenty-one acres of arable land, each acre worth 
about L. 1, 10s. per annum. To make up the stipend to L. 150, 
exclusive of communion elements, it was necessary to apply to the 
Exchequer fund for L. 12, 13s. Id. There are also ten bolls of 
oatmeal which the minister of Stobo draws from Sir John Nasmyth, 
as his half share of the glebe and grass of Dawick, and a servitude 
which he has on the Harrow and Stobo Hope of six days of a man's 
casting turfs. 

The number of dissenters in the parish is about 34. The ave- 
rage number of communicants in the parish church is 154. 

Education. — The parochial school is the only school in the pa- 
rish. Besides the usual branches, Latin is sometimes taught there. 
The salary is L. 32. The school fees amount annually to about 
L. 11. As ah encouragement to the people to attend, Sir James 
Montgomery pays the school fees of every boy or girl of a family 
when the numbers that attend the school out of each family ex- 
ceed two. The school fees for teaching to read English, for one 
year, are 4s. 6d. ; for English and writing, 6s. ; for arithmetic, in- 
cluding English, 7s. 6d. ; for Latin, 12s. The schoolmaster's ac- 
commodations are good. There is no person in the parish up- 
wards of fifteen years of age who cannot both read and write. 

p oor — There are at present nine or ten paupers receiving pa- 
rochial aid, each receiving upon an average L. 3, 5s. per annum. 
Their relief arises from the collections in the church, averaging 
about L. 12 per annum, and from the sum of L. 545, which has 
been realized by savings from church collections. 

As to the feelings of paupers in regard to their receiving aid 
from poors' funds, these of course are different in different indivi- 
duals. I may state, as illustrative of the depraving effects of a de- 
pendence on this sort of charity, the case of one pauper, who at 
one time was so shocked at the debasing idea of being indebted 
for relief out of the poors' box, that she told me that she would 
rather work " till the blood came out at her finger points j" but 
now this woman is the most clamorous for relief of all that are on 
the poors' roll. 

jp Me /.__Coals are the chief staple article for fuel m the parish. 
They are brought either from the Lothians, Douglas coal-hill, or 
Wilsonton, in the west country.

PRESBYTERY OF PEEBLES, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND TWEEDDALE. 

THE REV. DAVID ANDERSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name — Boundaries. — According to Chalmers in his Cale- 
donia, the word Kirkurd was formed by prefixing the Scoto-saxon 
Kirk to Urd, the Celtic name of the place, signifying an eminence 
or height. This seems the most probable derivation of the name. 
The length of the parish from east to west is b\ English miles, 
and its breadth from north to south is from 3 to 4 miles. It is 
bounded by Broughton, Skirling, Dolphington, Linton, Newlands, 
and Stobo. 

Topographical Appearances. — The highest hill in the parish is 
called Hell's Cleugh, which, according to Armstrong, is 2100 feet 
above the level of the sea. On the summit of this hill there is a 
small cairn called the Pyked Stane, the boundary of three parishes, 
Stobo, Broughton, and Kirkurd. This cairn commands a very ex- 
tensive view. Towards the north-west, the view extends as far as 
Dumbartonshire, and towards the east as far as the Eildon hills, 
near Melrose, and the Cheviot hills in Northumberland. 

Hydrography. — There is a copious sulphureous spring near 
Castlecraig. The late celebrated Dr Black, Professor of Che- 
mistry, in the University of Edinburgh, from a chemical analysis, 
ascertained its water to be stronger than the sulphureous water at 
Moffat, but weaker than that at Harrowgate. It has been used 
with success in several diseases. The water Tarth flows along the 
north of the parish, and divides it from Linton and Newlands. 
This is the only stream in the parish. 

The lands in this parish, though in general high, being betwixt 
600 and 700 feet above the level of both the east and west sea, 
are notwithstanding healthful— the soil being for the most part 
gravelly. The soil appears to be well adapted for the growth of 
timber of various kinds, and a great deal of wood has been planted, 



128

which tend much to beautify and improve the country. The pre- 
vailing winds are from the south-west, and the heavy rains are im- 
mediately absorbed. Rheumatism is the most prevalent distemper. 

Geology. — The prevailing rocks in this parish appear to belong 
to the transition class. 

Not long ago, in digging for marl in the Mount bog, several 
horns of the elk, in a high state of preservation, were found. It 
is conjectured that there must have been a lake at one time in that 
place, perhaps in a semifluid state, and that the deer running into 
it when pursued by the hunters had perished. In proof of there 
having been a lake, it may be mentioned, that, in boring for marl 
in another part of the bog, there were found several hazel-nuts 
by no means in a decayed state. The discovery of these horns 
affords one, among many other proofs, that this country must have 
abounded in former times very much in wood. 

II. — Civil History. 

Eminent Men. — James Geddes of Rachan, whose ancestors pos- 
sessed the large estate of Kirkurd for a long course of years, was 
born in this parish in the year 1710. He was educated for, and 
practised several years at, the bar, and was to have been appointed 
to the Bench of Judges. He died of consumption before he ar- 
rived at the age of forty. He published an Essay on the Compo- 
sition and Manner of Writing of the Ancients, and left behind him 
several other tracts. 

It is recorded in history, that, at the close of the civil" wars with 
the Douglasses in the reign of James II., Sir David Scott of Kirkurd 
and Buccleuch obtained great gifts of land for his clan's service and 
his own at the battle of Arkinholme, in the valley of Esk, where the 
brothers of Douglas and his followers received a severe defeat, and 
that the possession of this landed property was the commencement 
of that course of greatness which afterwards raised his family to 
the dukedom. 

Land-owners.— There are four proprietors in this parish, the 
principal of whom are Sir Thomas G. Carmichael, Bart, of Skir- 
ling, and John Lawson, Esq. of Cairnmuir. The former gentle- 
man is patron of Kirkurd, and possesses several valuable estates 
in other parishes. His estates formerly belonged to John Earl of 
Hyndford, his grand-uncle. They are entailed in the male line. 

Parochial Registers.— With regard to these, it may be stated, 
that three books exist containing part of the records of the kirk- 
session. The first begins in September 23, 1705, and ends Fe- 



K 1 1 Kl'KD. 



129 



bruary 23, 1707; the second begins November 10, 1717, and 
ends July 12, 1724; the third begins January 3, 1725, and ends 
July 30, 1738. The registers have been regularly kept from Oc- 
tober 27, 1742, to the present time. 

Antiquities. — Several stones of a circular form are standing in 
the neighbourhood of old Harestanes, supposed to have been erect- 
ed by the Druids for religious purposes. 

Near Castlecraig house are two mounts called the Castle and 
the Law, supposed to have been sepulchral barrows of ancient 
construction, though afterwards used as stations for the admini- 
stration of justice to a rude people. To the east of these is a 
circular fortification, on an eminence near Ladyurd, called the 
Rings, and another to the west called the Chesters. They are 
supposed to have been military erections. 

At Mount-hill, about the year 1754, a stone chest enclosing a 
large clay urn containing human bones was found. And more re- 
cently there was found at the bottom of the same hill a stone cof- 
fin 4£ feet long, 2£ feet wide, and 2 feet deep, which contained 
human bones, among which were discovered three flint stones, — 
one resembling a halbert ; another of a circular form ; and the third 
of a cylindrical form, with a small ring, supposed to have been a 
Druidical amulet. In another part of the parish, there was also 
found a few years ago another stone coffin, formed of a great many 
stones rudely put together, and containing human bones. 

Modern Buildings. — Castlecraig, the seat of Sir Thomas G. 
Carmichael, is an elegant and commodious mansion-house, erected 
by Sir John G. Carmichael, and enlarged and beautified by the 
present proprietor. The garden and pleasure grounds are very ex- 
tensive, and tastefully laid out. The house at Cairnmuir, belong- 
ing to John Lawson, Esq. is also an excellent one, and well fitted 
for the accommodation of a large family. 

III. — Population. 

Population in J801, - 327 
1811, - 387

1831, - 318 

The population of 1831 is now considerably less than when 
the last census was taken, owing to the two principal proprietors 
not being resident in the parish.

Owing to the prodigious increase of machinery of late years, 
which greatly lessens the price of various articles, very little wool 
or lint is spun at home, and the general practice is to purchase 
every thing from the merchant. And, indeed, still fewer articles 
will hereafter be manufactured at home, because, in reality, no 
profit is derived from the system. The people in a reasonable de- 
gree may be said to erijoy the comforts and advantages of society; 
and, accordingly, it may be mentioned that no emigrants to foreign 
countries have gone from this parish. 

During the last three years there have been four or five illegi- 
timate births in the parish. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — By actual measurement the 
parish was found to contain 6620 English acres. It has been plau- 
sibly supposed that these may be divided into three nearly equal 
parts, 1st, land that is at present under cultivation ; Id, land that 
may be cultivated or improved : 3d, land that is solely adapted for 
sheep-pasture. Under the second of these divisions, however, are 
included nearly 600 acres which have been planted ; and the re- 
maining 1620 acres must merely be considered as what it is pos- 
sible to make arable, not what may be advantageously cultivated. 
This last point cannot properly be determined; only we may safely 
assert, that the number of acres that might with profitable appli- 
cation of capital be added to the cultivated land is very small. In 
fact, in some instances too great a desire has been manifested to 
bring high ground into cultivation, and it may be questioned whe- 
ther the farmer has received a proper indemnification for the ex- 
pense incurred. 

This parish has derived great benefit from the attention that 
has been paid to the growth of timber. The plantations belong- 
ing to Sir Thomas G. Carmichael and Mr Lawson are extensive, 
and are in a flourishing state. Sir Thomas, indeed, has done in- 
calculable service to the parish by his numerous plantations. 
These have wonderfully improved the climate, and beautified the 
country. In this county much may yet be done in the way of 
planting trees ; and proprietors would receive a proper remunera- 
tion, for it cannot be disputed that the plantations on the hills 
tend to improve the lower grounds. 

Bate of Wages.— The wages of men-servants for the year are 



KIRKURD. 



131 



betwixt L. 11 and L. 13 ; and of women-servants betwixt L. 5 and 
L. 6 for the same period". The wages of women-servants are much 
higher in summer than in winter, owing, no doubt, to the greater 
amount of labour to which they are subjected in the one season 
than in the other. 

Husbandry. — All kinds of grain excepting wheat and beans are 
raised, and it is found that the more early kinds suit better than 
the later. Wheat, indeed, has been attempted, but this so partially, 
as scarcely to merit notice. The green crop cultivation is much at- 
tended to, and potatoes and turnips are generally of excellent qua- 
lity. The dairy system is carried on here to a considerable extent, 
and it has been said that the farmers are nearly enabled to pay their 
rents from the produce of their cows. 

The plan of irrigating meadow ground has been adopted in some 
places in the parish very successfully.— It has been ascertained that 
some water meadows have produced on an average about 400 
stones of hay per acre, reckoning 22 lbs. to the stone. 

As to the duration of leases, it may be stated, that all farms, with 
a few exceptions, are let for nineteen years, and if they are let on 
an average at 20s. per acre, both landlord and tenant are consider- 
ed as equally benefited. 

Very little can be said in praise of the farm-buildings in the pa- 
rish. These are commonly taken by estimate, and the lowest is 
generally preferred. Hence the farm-houses are rather superfi- 
cially built. It has now, however, become customary for the te- 
nants themselves to drive materials for the buildings, and this 
no doubt tends, with as little cost as formerly to the proprietor, to 
secure a more substantial and comfortable erection. 

Produce.— The average gross amount and value of raw produce 
yearly raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as 
follows : 

Oats, 2392 bolls at 15s. per boll, . T 1 7Q1 n n 

Barley, 258 bolls at 22s. per boll, . oat n

The above may be considered a pretty accurate account of the

132 PEEBLES-SHIR E. 

annual produce, and in connection with this, we now state that the 
real rental of the parish may be about L. 1900 yearly. The land, 
upon the whole, is well cultivated. The improved system of hus- 
bandry has been adopted, and good crops in general are produced. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Towns, and Means of Communication.— There is no vil- 
lage in the parish, and the nearest-market towns are Biggar and 
Peebles, the one seven and the other ten miles distant from the 
church. The parish enjoys abundant means of communication, 
the great public road betwixt Edinburgh and Dumfries, &amp;c. pas- 
sing through it, and also the road betwixt Glasgow and Peebles, &amp;c. 
The length of the turnpike roads are betwixt seven and eight miles, 
and they are kept in excellent repair. There are three principal 
bridges, all of which are in pretty good condition. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The situation of the church is convenient 
for the bulk of the population, the distance from one extremity 
being two and a-half miles, and from the other about three. It was 
built in 1766, and is fitted for accommodating about 300 people. 
The interior is upon the whole pretty comfortable. The sittings 
are all free, every farmer in the parish being entitled to a seat in 
the church for himself and family. 

We understand that in 1116 there belonged to the Bishop- 
rick of Glasgow in Kercayrd one carucate of land and a church. 
This church was confirmed to the bishops of Glasgow by the 
bulls of Pope Alexander in 1170 and 1178, and by the bulls of 
Lucian and Urban in 1181 and 1186. The church of Ord was 
afterwards given to the hospital of Sottra in proprios usus, and con- 
tinued with it till 1462, when Mary of Gueldres transferred it to 
the Trinity church of Edinburgh, upon condition that the sacrist 
of the collegiate church of the Trinity should keep in repair the 
church of Kirkurd. It is a curious fact, that in 1384 Sir James 
Douglas of Dalkeith founded near his castle a chapel, which he 
endowed with the lands of Lochard, and 40s. out of the lands of 
Kirkurd in Peebles -shire. 

It would appear that the church of Kirkurd must have been a 
vicarage in Roman Catholic times, for we are told that m 14/7 
William Chamber, the vicar of Kirkurd, granted some lands in the 
manor of Corstorphine and various annual rents for supporting a 
chaplain to officiate at St Ninian's altar in Corstorphine church ; 
and that this endowment was confirmed in 1477 by James III 
It may be proper to mention, that during the prevalence of the 



K1RK.UKD. 



1 33 



keen discussions regarding church government, the minister of 
Kirkurd, Mr John Bennet, was sent as one of the commissioners 
from the Presbytery of Peebles to the famous assembly that con- 
vened at Glaso-ow in 1638, where Henderson was moderator, and 
where Episcopacy was abolished. 

There is only one place of worship in the parish, and those who 
dissent from the Established church generally attend a Relief cha- 
pel in the parish of Newlands. 

The average number of communicants for many years past may 
be about 160. The sacrament is dispensed annually, and the 
people are very regular in attending upon it. 

The manse was built in 1788, and has once or twice undergone 
some trifling repairs. It is too small, and inferior to the generality 
of manses. The extent of the glebe is about nineteen acres, nearly 
all arable. When the present incumbent was settled in 1787, a 
new glebe was given, and as part of the land was very indifferent, 
this accounts for the glebe being larger than usual. It has been 
much improved by manuring, draining, and by its being enclosed. 
The present minister was once in the habit of letting it, and one 
year received a rent of L. 30, with a cow's grass. 

The parish was valued at an early period, and was found to be 
no more than L. 1108, 15s. 4d. Scotch money. The stipend from 
the heritors is about L. 70, and as the teinds are exhausted, more 
than double is received from the Exchequer to make it amount to 
L. 150. 

Education. — There is one public school in the parish, attended 
on an average by about forty scholars, but often by more, from its 
vicinity to other parishes. Occasionally there are a few scholars 
instructed in Latin and Greek, and practical mathematics. The 
teacher has the maximum salary. The school-fees fixed by the 
heritors and minister are 2s., 2s. 6d., and 3s. per quarter. These 
may amount annually to L. 12. The dwelling-house for the school- 
master is very small, there being only a kitchen and one small room. 
There is scarcely an individual upwards of twelve years of age in 
the parish who cannot both read and write, and the people are alive 
to the benefits of education. 

Library. — A parish library was instituted in 1810, and is upon 
the whole in a flourishing state. A school library was likewise 
founded in 1828. 

Poor and Parodiial Funds. — The weekly collections in the 
church are found more than sufficient to supply the ordinary poor 



134 



PEEBLES-SHIRE. 



in a purely agricultural parish, where there is no village and no 
manufactories. These collections vary considerably at different 
times. When the heritors' families are resident, they are some- 
times 9s. or 10s., and 2s. 6d. may be considered as the average at 
other times. Occasionally, collections are made for religious and 
charitable purposes, and the people in general contribute liberally 
enough. It may be right to mention, that there was at one time 
a capital of about L. 400, which by extraordinary expenditure, 
as in the payment of a schoolmaster's salary for several years, 
the building of a house for the church-officer, the maintaining 
of a widow with a large family, and by purchasing mort-safes, en- 
closing the schoolmaster's garden, erecting an iron gate to the 
churchyard, and occasionally repairing the church, painting the 
same, &amp;c. is now reduced to less than L. 200. At an average 
for several years past the disbursements for the poor have been 
about L. 40 annually ; and the number of persons receiving aid 
yearly has been six. It may be safely stated, that there is little 
danger of any assessment ever becoming necessary in this parish. 
To the credit of the people it may be mentioned, that a highly 
laudable and independent spirit exists among them, and that they 
will not have recourse to parochial assistance except from absolute 
necessity. They very generally avail themselves of the advantages 
arising from Savings Banks, established in different parts of the 
county. 

Inns. — There is one inn in the parish, chiefly for the accommo- 
dation of travellers. 

Fuel. — Coals are generally used. The nearest are six miles 
distant, and can be procured, including carriage, &amp;c. for nearly 
10s. per common cart, containing about 12 cwt. The people in 
general, however, prefer getting their coals from Douglas, and the 
neighbourhood of Carnwath, because, though at a great distance, 
they are reckoned excellent in quality. 

Friendly Society. — A Friendly Society was many years ago es- 
tablished in the parish ; but, owing to its not being founded on 
proper principles, and to the want of efficient management, it has 
become extinct.

PRESBYTERY OF PEEBLES, SYNOD OE LOTHIAN AND TWEEDDALE. 

THE REV. CHARLES FINDLATER, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Extent, fyc. — The parish may be considered as about 11 miles 
in length, and about 2 miles in the average breadth, in whole, 
probably, 11000 or 12000 acres. 

A chief part of the low land lies in a vale, which is bounded to- 
wards the south-east by a range of hills, called Kellyheads, run- 
ning parallel to the range of the Pentland hills. This vale is 
bounded on the opposite side by a low hilly ridge, passing under 
different names, such as Dodhead and Broomyleas. In the bot- 
tom of this vale there is a moss, called Hallmyre bog, of about 60 
acres, along the middle of which a very deep and wide ditch was cut 
down to a gravelly bottom, full of springs, by the late William 
Gordon, Esq. of Hallmyre, into which the bog has been drained 
by cross-drains, and is now all good arable land. With the inter- 
ruption of Lyne water, which cuts it nearly at right angles, this 
vale continues, bounded by lesser hills, or rather a swelling ridge, 
along the public road till you arrive at the bridge over the Terth, 
which water forms the boundary of the parish with that of Kirkurd 
and of Stobo. 

The vale of the Lyne is bounded on the one side by the Kelly- 
heads range above-mentioned, taking various names, and interrupt- 
ed only by the small burn, called Flemington-mill burn, and the 
still smaller ones of Stevenson burn, and Hagen-hope burn, all fal- 
ling from the east into Lyne vale, which last forms the boundary 
with the parish of Lyne. This vale is bounded on the other side 
of the Lyne water by gently rising acclivities, which on their op- 
posite side descend to the water of Terth before-mentioned, as 
the boundary with the parishes of Kirkurd and Stobo. 
• Besides these vales, the parish extends over the tops of the 
range of the Kellyheads, and down their opposite sides to Fie- 



136 



peebles-siiihl;. 



mington-mill burn and its tributaries, where the parish is bounded 
by that of Eddlestone. 

Hydrography. — The only waters of any importance in the pa- 
rish are the Lyne and the Terth, and next to them Flemington- 
mill burn. These are frequented only for trout fishing. There 
is an artificial pond of about fourteen acres at Whim, and another 
perhaps about half as large at Magbiehill ; they contain trout, 
eels, and perch. The new proprietor of Lamancha is also form- 
ing some fish-ponds. 

Mineralogy. — The rock in the range of the Kellyheads is whin, 
which is rarely to be found in solid beds, but is divided by fissures 
in all directions. It contains veins of pretty rich ironstone ; and 
there are many chalybeate springs. In the east end of the parish, 
on the estates of Whim and Lamancha, the coal formation occurs, 
composed of limestone, slate, white sandstone, and common black 
bituminous coal. None of these are now wrought for sale. On 
the adjoining estate of Magbiehill there is lime for sale ; but the 
coal for burning it is brought from the neighbouring parish of Lin- 
ton. Farther down in the vale, in the hill of Broomyleas, there 
is a quarry of excellent durable red sandstone or freestone, which 
supplies all the county. 

Zoology. — Under this head may be noticed the brown, or Rus- 
sian, or Norwegian rat, which a good many years ago invaded 
Tweeddale, to the total extermination of the former black rat in- 
habitants. Their first appearance was in the minister's glebe at 
Selkirk, about the year 1776 or 1777, where they were found 
burrowing in the earth, a propensity which occasioned considera- 
ble alarm, lest they should undermine houses. They seemed to 
follow the courses of waters and rivulets, and, passing from Selkirk, 
they were next heard of in the mill of Traquair ; from thence fol- 
lowing up the Tweed, they appeared in the mills of Peebles; then 
entering by Lyne water, they arrived at Flemington-mill, in this 
parish ; and coming up the Lyne they reached this neighbourhood 
about the year 1791 or 1792. 

Within thirty or forty years the brown squirrel has founds its 
way hither from Dalkeith. 

II. — Civil History. 

Eminent Persons. — Of remarkable persons born in the parish, I 
can only state Sir Robert Murray Keith of Hallmyre, who was am- 
bassador at Copenhagen, and saved the life of the queen in the 
affair of Counf Struensee; and Sir Basil, his brother, who died in 



NEWLANDS. 



137 



Jamaica, governor of that island ; to whom may be added the late 
Lord Chief Baron Montgomery, who was one of the first sheriffs 
of royal nomination, after the abolition of the heritable jurisdic- 
tions, and the first Scotchman who attained to the dignity of Lord 
Chief Baron. 

Land-otvners. — The' proprietors, reckoning from the easter end 
of the parish, are Sir James Montgomery of Stanhope, proprietor of 
Whim, non-resident, but whose house, with some parks, is occupied

Antiquities. — As to the vestiges of antiquity remaining in the 
parish, there are circular circumvallations called rings on the tops 
of several hills, as on Callends hill, Whiteside hill, Boreland hill, 
and Penria hill. 

Drochil Castle, situated in a commanding situation, in the angle 
made by the junction of Terth with Lyne water, is not very much 
dilapidated. Tradition ascribes the building to Regent Morton : 
The lintel of one window to the west has the Douglas arms upon 
it in relief. 

Parochial Registers. — The old session record, beginning with a 
mutilated leaf of a minute in 1650, might probably be ranked 
among the antiquities of the parish. From that record it appears 
that an yearly sum was paid by the adjoining parishes to the Peebles 
magistrates for watching witches in Peebles prison, — to enforce 
confession, probably by the torture of preventing them from sleep- 
ing. From that record great alarm seems to have prevailed at the 
approach of Cromwell's army, designed the Sectarian Army fast-

days being frequently appointed to avert the impending calamity ; 
and the Sabbath day itself was often set apart for that purpose. 
Intimations are given from the pulpit to the militia to meet at cer- 
tain places of rendezvous, and thence to proceed to the Scotch 
army, wherever it may be at the time. After the defeat of the en- 
gagers under the Duke of Hamilton", I find that Sir Michael Na- 
smith in Drochil appeared before the kirk-session, and upon his 
knees confessed his conviction of the sinfulness and unlawfulness of 
the late engagement, whereupon he was again received into the So- 
lemn League and Covenant. During Cromwell's administration, 
the session seems to have kept remarkably quiet. After the Resto- 
ration, and during the persecution of the Covenanters, great anxiety 
seems manifested against any persons being received into the parish 
without sufficient testimonials, attesting, it may be presumed, that 
they did not attend conventicles : And great alarm is also expres- 
sed when a placard was found affixed to the church threatening re- 
taliation on the part of the persecuted. The session seems to have 
assumed great censorial powers, and informations were listened to 
and sought after in regard to the slightest irregularities, which were 
made matter of impeachment and judicial trial, with citation and 
examination of witnesses, so that discipline seems to have been 
strict in the parish. The session record is not now so voluminous ; 
no record is kept of scandals, nor of marriages, nor deaths ; and 
even that of births is not completely regular, there being no suffi- 
cient compulsitor to enforce registration.

With the aid of bone and oil-cake manure, none of the land 
need lie unimproved, excepting- probably 500 acres of the apex of 
hills, inaccessible to the plough. But a great part of this is occa- 
sionally ploughed, cropt with oats, and then resigned for years to 
pasture. 

I would observe in general, that, from the vicinity of the parish 
to Edinburgh, dairy farming is much in practice. The most pro- 
ductive mode of dairy farming here is to churn the whole milk, and 
to send both butter and butter-milk daily, or twice or thrice a-week 
to the capital. The next mode in point of profit which our farmers 
adopt is to churn only the cream, and convert the skimmed milk 
into cheese ; sending the butter by weekly carriers to Edinburgh, 
and selling the cheese at the end of the season. At a greater dis- 
tance, it is expedient to convert the whole of the milk into cheese. 

Soion Grasses. — Fallow land, when sown out for hay, is sown 
with grass seeds at the rate of 8 lb. red clover, and 1£ bushels of 
annual rye-grass per imperial acre. If intended for pasture, at the 
rate of 4 lb. red, and 5 lb. of white clover, and the same quantity, 
1 1 bushels, of perennial rye-grass. Where the soil is mossy, Ti- 
mothy and rib-grasses are mixed with the clovers ; in some few 
instances double the clover, with only two-thirds of the rye-grass 
above specified, are sown. 

Live-Stock. — The stocking of a sheep-farm is the number of 
sheep that are smeared and kept through winter ; whether lambs 
bought in the end of June or beginning of July, kept over winter 
and sold as hogs next June or July, or ewes, as a breeding-stock, 
whose lambs, excepting those retained to keep up the stock, to- 
gether with the old discarded ewes are sold to the butcher, or the 
lambs sold to farms of the first description, part being kept to re- 
place the breeders discarded, or part may be even retained upon 
the farm to be sold as hogs. 

In this parish both old sheep and lambs are sold to the butcher, 
excepting the lambs retained to keep up the breeding-stock. 

Produce. — The average gross amount and value of raw produce 
yearly raised in the parish may be as follows :

The gross produce of the sheep pasture may be stated at - L. 21 10 0 0 

The sheep-pastures being fine, and enabling all to be sold fat 
to the butcher, the value of the sheep per head is above the ave- 
rage of the county. 

Black-Cattle— Yearly gross produce of cows. 

The number of milk cows kept may be 340_the calves kept yearly 160, which at 
three months old may be valued at L.  - - -  u u

In some few instances where no calves are reared, there has been ob- 
tained from a cow to the value of L. 10. But upon an average 
L 5 10s. may be considered as the full value of the yearly pro- 
duce'of a cow, in calves, butter, and cheese. About 160 full aged 
black-cattle may be annually sold from the parish ; part of them 
sold for the dairy in spring, and part fed off with turnip in au- 
tumn and winter, and sold to the butcher. The average value of 
these may be L. 9, 9s. a-head, 15U  U U 

The total gross produce from cows L. 3332 0 0 

Horses.— The total number of these may be 192 ; of this num-

ly may amount to 35, to supply those worn out.

Farm of Boreland. — As the improvements upon the farm of 
Boreland, the property of William Aitchison, Esq. of Drummore, 
in the vicinity of my manse, have, in various respects, given a sti- 
mulus to improvement in this quarter, I judge it proper to give a 
general account of them. 

The farm contains 372 acres, 30 acres of which Mr Aitchison, 
who purchased it in 1806, devoted to stripes and clumps of planting 
for shelter, and which is all in thriving condition. The surface 
on the north rises gradually from Longstruther burn into a long 
ridge of no great elevation, the soil of which is in general a black 
moorish soil, so light as to blow with the wind when pulverized in- 
to a tilth for turnip. This ridge declines into a plain, and then 
rises into a similar ridge, but of greater acclivity, which gathers in 
its middle to an eminence, crowned on its top with a small circu- 
lar circumvallation, called Boreland Rings. This ridge descends 
rather more precipitously into the narrow glen of Callends burn. 
The soil of this plain ridge is a gravelly loam upon an open bot- 
tom. The whole is easily accessible to the plough, and has been 
all under plough culture, excepting some few spots converted into 
water meadow. 

When purchased by Mr Aitchison it was in the possession of 
a back-going tenant, the remainder of whose lease he bought up, 
— the whole in the worst possible order. 

The first surface improvement it underwent was liming the whole 
at the rate of 45 bolls of shells or 18 one-horse cartfuls per acre, 
so soon as it could be overtaken by fallowing. This liming seem- 
ed to have but little effect on the light soil of the northern ridge. 

Much draining was required; and the first operation of this 
kind was performed upon a narrow stripe of land, consisting of 61 
acres, lying along the end of the second mentioned ridge, from a 
little above the bridge over Lyne at the manse, to Callends burn, 
and bounded betwixt Lyne water and the road to Peebles. It was 
a moss soil at the outburst of the springs from the ridge, in which 



142 



PEEBLES-SHIRE. 



the cattle of the former tenant used often to be bogged in search- 
ing for the early grass from the springs. Lying upon a bottom of 
chattery rock, no ditch could confine the water, and of course was 
not attempted. It was merely surface-drained by shaping it into 
high-crowned ridges by the spade ; it was then limed from bas- 
kets carried by women, and sown out with grass-seeds, and has re- 
mained in grass ever since ; a part of it being subsequently water- 
ed, though scantily, from Callends burn, hay is yearly cut from it 
at nearly 200 stones per acre. Three small springs have had two 
small portions assigned to them for watering, — the water of one of 
them being carried a part of the way to its destination in a timber 
conduit, supported upon tresses. But the most remarkable effect 
produced by irrigation was upon a field of a semifluid moss of five 
acres along Longstruther burn, over which sheep could not travel 
in the driest weather without risk of drowning. It was so deep that 
it would have required a ditch of great depth, and carried to great 
length, before reaching the level of its bottom. It was, therefore, 
surface-shaped for watered meadow, and the Longstruther burn 
turned over it; and, from being worth next to nothing, yields 200 
stones of hay per acre, and can carry carts. 

And here it may not be improper to state an experiment tried 
last year upon a small scale, and with such apparent success as 
has encouraged the repetition of it this season upon a larger. It 
is to raise turnips by grass fresh cut from the watered meadow, and 
deposited in the drills in the same way as dung. The grass in 
this year's experiment underwent no other process than merely be- 
ing turned into the horse pond to get wetted that it might lie the 
more closely in the drill, to be the more easily covered by the 
plough. I inspected the field on the 4th September 1833, 
when the turnip from the grass and that from rape dust ap- 
peared equally vigorous in the shaw. Those on the same field 
from dung were rather fading in the shaw, but farther advanced 
in the bulb, owing, as I was told, from the earlier springing of the 
turnip from the dung. It might seemingly be of advantage to wet 
the grass, or, indeed, any kind of green stuff afforded by the farm, 
and to let it lie in heap for a few days till it gets heated, when 
turnip might spring from it as early as from dung. From the suc- 
cess of this experiment it would appear that manure might thus be 
obtained in every farm from any green stuff it produces. I in- 
spected the same day the meadow whence the grass had been taken 
for manure. It was cutting green for house-feeding, and was pro- 



NEWLANDS. 



143 



bably as weighty as what had been cut for hay ten days or a fort- 
night before. Might not that which was stunted in growth in the 
cold months of spring- shoot out more vigorously in being cut over 
so early 

But to return to the rest of the management. Mr Aitchison 
enlarged his tilth, and, by consequence, augmented his crop, and 
made a still farther enlargement of tilth by the conversion of its straw 
into manure, — in one instance by purchasing Edinburgh street 
dung, when it lay as a drug upon the hands of the magistrates, 
and subsequently by the foreign manures of rape and bone dust. 
And here it may be observed, that these two last-mentioned ma- 
nures afford a prospect of improving our pastures on hills where 
merely the plough can operate ; for as a ton weight per acre suf- 
fices to raise turnip, and as this could easily be carried on horses' 
backs, if sheep were flaked upon the turnip, the land would come 
to be in best order to be sown off with grasses, even where the ex- 
pense of lime in addition might be inexpedient, although certainly 
to be desired. 

To procure sufficiency of manure, is the great foundation of pro- 
fitable farming. In the neighbourhood of great towns, it is advan- 
tageous to exchange the straw of the farm for the dung and fulzie 
of the town ; but at a distance, excepting the easily transportable 
manures of bone or rape dust, the great dependence must be on 
the dung of the cattle and their litter. Mr Aitchison's plan is to 
consume his whole straw in litter, carrying off the litter and re- 
newing it, so soon as it is merely so fouled by the dung as to make 
it ferment : to consume as much of the fodder in rearing young 
cattle, and to use the least possible for litter, which immediate pro- 
fit suggests, he considers as almost equivalent to burning the straw 
to obtain the ashes for dung. 

His dung manufacturers are, first, from twenty to thirty black 
cattle, bought in at Hallow-fair, which are kept through winter in 
a well-littered court, having open shades, and into which water is 
introduced, to which they have access ad libitum, upon turnip and 
meadow hay, and through the ensuing summer with cut grass from 
the water meadows or sown fields, and upon tares; when they are 
sold to the butcher in the end of autumn. Perhaps a dozen of 
swine are also fed in the cattle court. 

The next engine for creating dung is a standing stock of breed- 
ing ewes, in number 105, of the new Leicester breed, remarkable 
for smallness of bone, weight of carcase, and heaviness of fleece. 
These are pastured in summer upon the parks on the ridge rising 



144 



PEEBLES-SHIRE 



from Longstruther burn, and lying from that burn to Noblehouse 
road, which have been resigned to pasture for several years; one 
of these parks in particular, formerly mostly covered with heath, 
was sown off for pasture, after having been for two successive sea- 
sons fallow green crops with dung, and the last turnip crop eaten 
on the field by the sheep ; and when I inspected it on the 4th Sep- 
tember 1833, it appeared equal to any Lothian park in closeness 
and fineness of sward. These ewes are fed through winter with 
turnip and hay, administered to them in open shades, with which 
every park is provided ; a small quantity of green watered meadow 
grass being also allowed in spring, when the turnip are getting dry, 
to make the ewes more abundant in milk. The sheds are always 
kept plentifully littered. The proportion of lambs from the ewes, 
upon an average of years, is 141 from the 100. None are sold as 
lambs, but kept on through winter and the following summer, and, 
excepting what are retained to replace the discarded of the breed- 
ing stock, are sold, at from eighteen to twenty months old, to the 
butchers, who have uniformly declared that they have found no 
twenty month old sheep, even from the best parts of the country, 
equal to those from Boreland in fat and tallow. This may be ac- 
counted for from the uniform full feeding,— the abundance of shel- 
ter from planting and sheds,— and the waving nature of the surface, 
admitting free circulation of air, and preventing the molestation of 
flies, and°thus may be overbalanced the disadvantages of an elevated 
situation and cold climate, which probably render vegetables less 

nutritious. , 
From his great command of manure, bred at home and abroad, 
Mr Aitchison can keep about 150 acres in constant tillage, in 
crops pretty much in the -following assortment : From 12 to 20 
acres in wheat; from 30 to 35 acres in barley; from 30 to 35 do. 
in oats ; 30 to 35 do. grass sown with the preceding crop ; 30 acres 
in turnips regularly ; and the rest including 30 acres under wood 
in pasture. In the best seasons, a return has been known, per 
acre, of 14 bolls of wheat, 10 do. of oats, 8 of barley, old measure. 
Bare fallow is generally the preparation for wheat, but this season, 
the tillage land being perfectly clean, he intends sowing 21 acres 
after peas and tares; the tares, of about 8 acres, will be all cut 
and consumed in the court-yard, and dunged and sown with wheat 
this first week of September. The pease are being shorn just now, 
and the land will probably be dunged and sown the second week. 

The average weight and price of his sheep, all sold by January 
1833, is as under :

his liming, at first upon the fallow, and subsequently in top-dres- 
sing pastures with a compound of moss and lime, he has expended 
above 400 bolls of shells. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The stipend consists partly of valued teind 
in money, and partly of meal and barley, averaging in whole about 
L. 250 a-year. The glebe is fourteen acres in extent. 

The number of families attending the Established church is 42 ; 
families belonging to the dissenters, 20. 

There is no record of the age of the church. The door-way at 
the west end in the front is arched semicircularly ; the two windows 
and door in front at the west end are square and lintelled, and seem 
modern, — these two doors and windows are in the front, — and there 
was a large Gothic window in the east end, which has now been 
converted into a door to a gallery. 

The present manse was built in 1740, and is still seemingly in 
good repair. 

Education. — There is one parochial school; its situation not 
central. The teacher has the maximum salary, with L. 7, 7s. as 
heritors' and session-clerk. His fees may amount to about L. 13 
a-year. There is another school at the eastern extremity of the 
parish, the teacher of which has a salary from the heritors of L. 8. 
There are no persons in the parish upwards of eight years of age 
unable to read. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — About 32 persons, regularly and 
occasionally, receive aid from these funds. The average annual 
amount of contributions for their relief is L. 110 ; of which L. 90 
may be raised by assessment, and the rest from church collections. 

Savings Banks. — There is one of these banks in this parish, in 
which the amount of deposits has hitherto varied from L. 800 to 
L. 1100.

PRESBYTERY OF PEEBLES, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND TWEED DALE. 

THE REV. PATRICK ROBERTSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish of Eddlestone is 10 miles 
in length from north to south, and 7 from east to west. Its 
greatest breadth is at the southern extremity, and it gradually con- 
tracts as it approaches the north, where its breadth does not exceed 
two miles. It is bounded on the north and north-east by the pa- 
rishes of Pennycuick and Temple, on the south-east by the parish 
of Innerleithen, on the south and south-west by the parishes of 
Peebles and Lyne, and on the west by Newlands. 

Topographical Appearances, fyc. — The hills in general are of a 
very tame description, being smooth, and for the most part green to 
their summits. The highest is Dundroich, or the Druid's hill, 
which is 2100 feet above the level of the sea, and from which in a 
clear day can be seen the Cheviot hills, with part of Teviotdale, 
Annandale, Clydesdale, Perthshire, Fifeshire ; the Firth of -Forth, 
the city of Edinburgh, and the counties of East, West, and Mid- 
Lothian. 

At the base of this hill, there is a lake two miles in circumfe- 
rence, abounding with pike, eels, and perch. This lake gives rise 
to the water of South Esk, which empties itself into the sea at Mus- 
selburgh. 

The climate is dry and bracing,— the easterly fogs seldom reach 
the southern extremity of the parish, and there are no distempers 
peculiar to the district. 

II. — Civil History. 

Land-owners. — Mr Mackenzie of Portmore is the principal land- 
owner, being proprietor of more than half the parish. Lord Eh- 
bank is patron, and second heritor; Lord Cringletie is third. 

Parochial Registers. — Aparochial register of births and baptisms, 
marriages and deaths, has been regularly kept since '26th Decem- 
ber 1725. It is worthy of remark, that this register at first seems 
to have been kept solely for ecclesiastical purposes, the baptisms 
only being recorded, and not the births, from the year 1725 till 



EDDLESTONK. 147 

1780. Since that lime, both the births and baptisms have been 
regularly recorded, in so far as this was practicable. But there is 
reason to fear that several have been deterred from entering their 
children's names in the record, by the small registration fee of 6d. 
to the clerk. This fee has lately been abolished, and the good effects 
of it are already beginning to appear ; in one instance a whole fa- 
mily having been registered at the same time, who, but for this trif- 
ling circumstance, in all probability, would never have been recorded. 

Antiquities. — There are no remains of antiquity in the parish 
except the ruins of three ancient camps. From their circular form 
it is probable they are Danish. One of them is still very entire 
upon the farm of Norshield; the late Colin Mackenzie, Esq. of 
Portmore, with that good taste for which he was distinguished, hav- 
ing preserved it with great care in the centre of his plantations. 
The other two, upon the farms of Milkiestone and Wormiston, have 
of late years been much defaced, in consequence of the stones hav- 
ing been applied to the purpose of building march dikes. 

In the year 1794, a pot containing a great quantity of gold and 
silver coins was dug up in the court-yard of the farm of Ringside. 
The silver was in a state of great decay, and crumbled into powder 
on being removed. The gold was more entire. The exact quan- 
tity found could never be correctly ascertained, as various fingers 
had been in the pot before it was delivered over to the Ldrd Chief 
Baron, the late Sir James Montgomery. After retaining posses- 
sion of it for a considerable time, and probably not thinking it worth 
while to report it to the Exchequer, he gave part of it to the finder 
and to the poor of the parish, and distributed a few pieces as cu- 
riosities among his friends. Several of these coins, it is believed, 
are now in the possession of Sir James Montgomery, and Mr Mac- 
kenzie, the proprietor. The tenant of Kingside has two of them, 
one bearing the inscription Jacobus S. Scotorum Rex, but the date 
is effaced; the other is apparently a foreign coin, but the inscrip- 
tion is altogether illegible. 

Towards the northern extremity of this farm, a barrow or tumu- 
lus, inclosed by three circular walls, was opened in the year 1828 
by the farmer for the sake of the stones; and in the centre of the 
inner Clrc l e was discovered a rude gtone Cntaini   

of human bones that had obviously been subjected to the action of 
nre. Combustion had not been so complete but that several of the 
processes remained entire; in particular those of the temporal bone. 
Reside the coffin were found a variety of brazen weapons, somewhat 
resembling hatchets. An account of this discovery, with a drawing

of the ground, and two of the weapons, was sent at the time by Mr 
Mackenzie to the Antiquarian Society in Edinburgh. He retained 
two of the weapons, and gave the remainder to the tenant who made 
the discovery. Whether these weapons were used in war or in the 
chase is for the antiquary to determine. 

It is worthy of remark, that the farm of Ringside, or more pro- 
perly the King's Seat, where these remains were found, was a hunt- 
ing station of King James the Sixth. 

III. — Population. 
The ancient state of the population was very similar to what it 
is at present, viz. purely agricultural and pastoral. The manners 
no doubt were more simple and primitive. Most of the farms 
were occupied by two tenants, who cultivated the land in alternate 
ridges ; and it is said that disputes as to the one encroaching up- 
on the property of the other were very rare. Were such a mode 
of cultivation in existence now, it would lead to interminable feuds. 
Till after the middle of the last century the universal practice was 
for the farmer and his family to sit in the kitchen and mess at the 
same board with their servants. The moral influence of this prac- 
tice, and the kindly feelings which it engendered, are now no more. 
The line of demarcation between master and servant is now more 
distinctly drawn, and it is believed that not one instance of this 
practice -now exists in the parish. A small landed proprietor, who 
was alive within these fifteen years, was among the last to giveit 
up Until the period of his second marriage, when he was far 
advanced in life, he rigidly adhered to the good old practice of his 
forefathers; but at length he consented to take a cup of tea at 
breakfast with his wife in the parlour, upon condition that he should 
first have his pint bicker of porridge as usual with his servants in 
the kitchen ; and this practice he continued till within a few years 
of his death. . Q1fl

Language, Habits, 8fc. of the People. — The language generally 
spoken is a corrupt Scotch, with a barbarous admixture of English. 
A few only of the oldest of the people speak the Scottish dialect 
in its purity. These, however, are rapidly disappearing, and in a 
few years more in all probability there will not be one person alive 
who could have held converse with his grandfather without the aid 
of a dictionary. 

Those who are in the prime of life, and in full employment, ge- 
nerally kill a sheep about Martinmas, and a pig of their own rear- 
ing. This is all the butcher-meat that is consumed in the family 
of a married ploughman, or respectable labourer, during the year ; 
and with this frugal fare they are contented and happy, and enjoy 
good health. In several families tea is substituted for porridge 
and milk at breakfast, and it is to be regretted that this pernicious 
habit is gradually gaining ground. Wherever it is habitually in- 
dulged in a peasant's family, poverty and wretchedness are its in- 
variable attendants, and the necessaries of life cannot be procured 
in sufficient abundance to support the general health. It is a lux- 
ury above the means of a labouring man, and it is doubtful whe- 
ther it be not a more productive source of poverty, misery, and 
vice than the unrestrained use of ardent spirits. Our legislators 
would do well to consider this ; and as they cannot change the habits 
of the people, to lower the duty on tea and sugar, so as to bring 
them within the compass of every industrious peasant's means. 

Poaching in game and the salmon fisheries prevails to such an 
extent, that the game is in danger of being extirpated ; and of the 
salmon that come into the river to spawn few are permitted to re- 
turn again to the sea. 

There has been no smuggling in the parish since the change in 
the distillery laws ; and pawnbroking was never known in it. 

During the last three years, there have been four illegitimate 
births in the parish. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Economy. 

Number of acres, standard imperial measure, in the parish, - - 21,250 
acres which are either cultivated, or occasionally in tillage, 4,370 
which never have been cultivated, and which remain con- 
stantly in waste or in pasture, - - 15,830

to the cultivated land of the parish, whether that land were afterwards to 

be kept in occasional tillage, or in permanent pasture, . 1,190 

under wood, the greater part of which has been planted 

within the last 30 years, ... - 1,050 

Rent of Land.— The average rent of arable land per acre in 
the parish is L. 1, 15s. for in-field, and 12s. 6d. for out-field land. 
The average rent of grazing is L. 5 for a milk cow ; L. 3 for a 
full-grown ox or heifer ; 5s. for a black-faced sheep ; and 6s. for 
a Cheviot sheep, pastured for the year. 

Rate of Wages.— Ploughmen fit for every kind of farm-work re- 
ceive L. 12 per annum, with victuals. If married, they have gene- 
rally, in addition to their wages, a free house, a milk cow, the usual 
allowance of meal, half a boll of potatoes planted, and their fuel 
driven gratis. These allowances, together with their wages, may 
be fairly estimated at L.25 per annum. Female-servants receive 
L. 6 a-year ; and masons and carpenters 15s. per week. 

Improvements. — Much has been done with respect to reclaiming 
waste land, draining, irrigation, and embanking upon all the farms 
that have been let within the last twenty years. Almost every 
spot capable of irrigation has been irrigated, and wet land has 
been made dry. The general agriculture of the parish, however, 
has been greatly retarded, in consequence of one-half of the parish 
having been let by the late Earl of Portmore upon fifty-seven years 
leases. The farmers sitting at easy rents contented themselves 
with cultivating the dry and most productive spots, and left the 
rest in a state of nature. These leases expire at Whitsunday 
next, when great improvements may be expected to take place. 
There are no enclosures in this part of the parish, and the farm- 
buildings are in a state of great decay. The steadings in the 
other parts of the parish are most complete and comfortable. Most 
of the farms are enclosed with ring fences, and several of them 
are completely subdivided. This practice it is probable will soon 
become universal, as the opinion is becoming very general that our 
land has been so long under the plough that it cannot be much 
longer cultivated with advantage without being thrown into pasture 
fori few years. This, however, can only be done by means of 
enclosures. One large farm, the property of Lord Cringletie, is 
now managed in this way. It is completely subdivided. The te- 
nant pastures it with sheep for three years after every rotation, 
and the increase of produce is very great. The general duration 
of leases is nineteen years.

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-town and Means of Communication. — Peebles is the 
nearest market-town, and is four miles from the village of Eddie- 
stone. There is a post-office in the village, and a daily post to 
and from Edinburgh and Peebles. The length of the turnpike 
roads in the parish is twenty-one miles, and a public coach from 
Peebles to Edinburgh passes through the parish daily. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is the only place of 
worship in the parish. It is situated two miles from the southern 
extremity of the parish, and eight from the northern. More than 
one-half of the population reside within a mile and a-half of it. 
The greater part of those at the northern extremity either go to 
the neighbouring church at Pennycuick, or to the dissenting meet- 
ing-houses at Howgate and Bridge-end. 

The church was rebuilt in 1829, and contains accommodation 
for 420 persons. Each heritor has a portion of the area allotted 
to him in proportion to his valued rent, which he subdivides among 
his tenants. The space occupied by the communion table is free 
to all, and affords accommodation for 36 persons. 

The manse was built about fifty years ago. The late incumbent 
received only L. 160 from the heritors, which was the estimated 
expense for repairing the old manse. Out of his own funds, with 
the addition of this sum, he built entirely the present manse and 
offices. A large addition was lately made to the manse by the pre- 
sent incumbent at his own expense, amounting to L. 380. The 
extent of the glebe is 28 imperial acres, and may be estimated at 
the yearly value of L.30 Sterling. The stipend awarded by the 
Court of Teinds in 1823 was 15 chalders of victual, half meal, half

barley, exclusive of L. 8, 6s. 8d. for furnishing communion elements. 
But as part of the teinds were surrendered, the stipend, as allocat- 
ed, and now payable to the incumbent, stands thus : 

Surrendered money teind, - - - - L. 96 0 6 

10 chalders, 5 bolls, 3pecks, 1 T 4 0 lip. of grain, at L. 13, 12s. perchalder, 140 5 0 

L.236 5 6 

Deduct for communion elements, - 8 6 8 

L.227 18 10 

Number of persons attending the Established church 736 ; of 
those who attend chapels of Seceders and Dissenters, 100. 

Divine service at the Established church is well attended, those 
at a considerable distance being in general most regular. The 
average number of communicants at the Established church is 212, 
and the average amount of church collections yearly for the support 
of the poor of the parish is L. 22 ; for religious and other chari- 
table purposes, L. 5. 

It is a singular fact in the ecclesiastical history of the parish, 
that the present incumbent and his forefathers have been mini- 
sters of Eddlestone for 137 years. James Robertson, the present 
incumbent's great-grandfather, was ordained minister of Eddlestone 
in 1697, and served the cure for fifty years. He died in 1747, 
and was succeeded by his son, Alexander, who had been his or- 
dained assistant and successor for a number of years. After his 
death in 1772, he was succeeded by his son, Dr Patrick Robert- 
son, who performed all the clerical duties of the parish for the 
space of fifty years. He died in the month of May 1822, and 
was succeeded by his son, the present incumbent, who had been 
ordained his assistant and successor in 1819. There is reason to 
believe that this is the only instance in the history of the Church 
of Scotland, of four individuals of the same family, in uninterrupted 
succession from father to son, serving the cure of the same parish. 

Such a connection is of a more than ordinarily hallowed nature, 
and tends to unite more closely the pastor and his flock in the 
bonds of mutual love and affection. And to a rightly constituted 
and virtuous mind, it must be a matter of pleasing and interesting 
reflection, to consider that many of those who now wait upon the 
ministry of the present incumbent, are the descendants of the very 
men who, 137 years ago, listened in the same place to the pas- 
toral admonitions of his great-grandfather. 

Education. — The parochial school istheonly school in the parish. 
The branches generally taught in it are English reading, writing, 
and arithmetic, Latin, Greek, French, and mathematics. The 



■ 



EDDLESTONE. 



153 



schoolmaster has the maximum salary, amounting to L. 34, 4s. 4d., 
and the school fees from the children of the parish amount to L.42 
per annum. The actual emoluments of the schoolmaster, however, 
are very great, as there is a large boarding establishment attached 
to the parish school, and the number of boys attending it from va- 
rious parts of the kingdom average in general from 30 to 40. 

The school fees are 2s. per quarter for English reading ; 3s. for 
reading and writing; and 3s. 6d. when arithmetic is conjoined. 
The fees for the other branches are at the discretion of the teacher. 
The people in general are alive to the benefits of education ; and 
there is not one person in the parish between six and fifteen years 
of age who cannot read and write. 

The northern extremity of the parish is too remote to admit of 
the children attending the parish school. A private school was 
kept there for several years, and was attended by about thirty 
children; but as there was no salary to the teacher, the emoluments 
from the school fees were so small, that it has lately been given up. 
An additional school might be established with great advantage 
near the northern extremity either of this or the adjoining parish 
of Newlands, which would afford all the additional accommodation 
that is required for both parishes, without materially diminishing 
the numbers attending the parochial schools. 

Charitable and other Institutions. — There are none in the parish. 
Almost all the men, however, are members of some of the neigh- 
bouring friendly societies, from which much benefit and comfort 
are derived in sickness and old age, and a spirit of independence 
excited and maintained. There was a saving bank established at 
the time they were first introduced into Scotland. It was conti- 
nued for five or six years with very considerable success. The 
servant-girls drew from it, when about to be married, upon an ave- 
rage, L. 10. At length it was considered expedient to transfer the 
deposits to the neighbouring bank at Peebles. A considerable 
prejudice at first existed in the minds of the people against these 
banks. Many were of opinion that they were established from a 
desire on the part of their masters to ascertain how much they 
could save, and that ultimately there would be an attempt made to 

 he ex P iellc y of Sl "-'h an appendage to a parochial school is very doubtful. Be- 
fore the boarding system commenced, the number of children belonging to the parish 
attending the school amounted to 100 ; but as the number of boarders increased, the 
number of the parish children gradually diminished, till now they do not exceed 70, 
although the population of the parish is as great as formerly. The people have an 
idea, although probably there is no just foundation for it, that their children must 
be neglected for that part of the establishment which is so much more productive. 
.The consequence of this impression, however erroneous, is, that the children are 
neither sent so young, nor continued so long at school as formerly. 



154 



PEEBLES-SHIRE. 



reduce their wages by that amount. This illiberal suspicion has 
long since died away. The investments for the most part are made 
by farm-servants at the terms of Whitsunday and Martinmas. The 
most numerous class of contributors are the servant-girls. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — Average number of persons receiv- 
ing parochial aid, 1 5. Average sum allotted to each person per 
annum, L. 4. Annual amount of contributions for their relief, 
L. 64 : of this sum, L. 22 are procured from church collections ; 
L. 9 from interest of money; and the remainder by assessment 
upon the heritors and tenants, in equal proportions. 

A poors' rate was established in the parish in 1752, and has 
continued ever since. The heritors and kirk-session meet twice 
a-year, and fix the aliment for each pauper for the ensuing half- 
vear. The clerk is instructed to draw the stent to the amount 
required, and the minister and kirk-session have a discretionary 
power to the extent of one-half of the weekly collections, to meet 
any contingencies that may occur. 

There is still a strong aversion on the part of the poor to apply 
for parochial aid. During the last ten years, not one direct appli- 
cation for aid has been made by the party requiring relief. Many 
of them would rather die of want, than acknowledge their poverty 
and ask the benefit of the funds. 

Fairs. — There is a fair held annually in the village on the 25th 
September. It was formerly a great cattle-market. The only 
business now transacted is the hiring of farm-servants for the winter 
half-year. 

Inns, Alehouses, c— There is only one alehouse in the parish, 
the demoralizing effects of which are rapidly increasing. Twenty 
years ago, almost the only thing called for was a bottle of small- 
beer; but since the late reduction in the duty on spirits, a great 
change has taken place in the habits of the people. Whisky, 
harsh and undiluted, is now the favourite, and almost the only, be- 
verage ; and drunkenness is rapidly extending among a class of men 
who formerly were habitually sober, viz. farm-servants and labour- 
ers. A marked improvement, however, has taken place in the 
habits of the tenantry and the better classes of society; and the 
deep drinking that was so prevalent among them forty years ago, 
is now of very rare occurrence. 

Fuel— The only fuel which the parish contains is peats, which 
the peasantry manufacture for themselves. Coals are procured at 
a moderate expense from the adjoining pits of Mid-Lothian.

PRESBYTERY OF PEEBLES, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND TWEEDDALE. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER FORRESTER, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name and Boundaries. — Linton no doubt derives its name from 
Lyne, one of the tributary streams of Tweed, rising out of that high 
ground which separates the county from Mid-Lothian on the north, 
and is a continuation of the Pentland range. In former times, it ap- 
pears to have been written Lyneton and Lynton. There is a parish 
of the same name in the county of Roxburgh. There is also a con- 
siderable village so called, in the county of East-Lothian and pa- 
rish of Prestonkirk ; and there are several parishes in England of 
the name of Linton. 

It is bounded on the east by Pennycuik ; on the south by New- 
lands, and Kirkurd ; on the west by Dolphinton and Dunsyre ; 
and on the north by West-Calder, Mid-Calder, and Kirknewton. 
It is distant sixteen miles from Edinburgh, and is understood to con- 
tain about twenty -five square miles. 

Meteorology — Climate. — Situated 600 feet above the level of 
the sea, the climate may be considered moist, and more subject to 
boisterous weather than regions of less elevation. It is, however, 
healthy, and not subject to any particular distemper. In common 
with districts of the same elevation, it is subject to autumnal frosts. 
At the same time, it must be remarked, that of late years, this 
peculiarity of our atmosphere has been greatly corrected by the 
draining of our marshy low lying grounds, and it is hoped, as this 
improvement goes on, that in future this part of the country will 
be less subject to this evil. 

Mineralogy. — The rocks in this parish are chiefly those of the 
coal and porphyry formations. Coal and limestone have been long 
wrought at Carlops. At present there is -also a regular sale of 
coal both at Harlamuir and Coalyburn at lOd. per load, which is 
two cwt. Lime is also sold at Whitfield; the price is Is. 6d. per 
boll, and 20,000 bolls have been disposed of in a season. At 
Deepsykehead there is a good freestone quarry. In several other 



156 



PEEBLES-SHlllE. 



places freestone is also to be got in the parish, and at Badensgill, 
limestone of an excellent quality has lately been discovered. 

The hill of Leadlaw, in the immediate vicinity of the village of 
Linton, would indicate it to be possessed, or supposed to be pos- 
sessed, of the mineral after which it is named. Accordingly, at- 
tempts have been made, at different periods, in search of lead on 
this hill. The last attempt was made only a few years ago ; but on 
both occasions the attempts were unsuccessful. It would also ap- 
pear, that, in the neighbourhood of the lead workings, search had 
been made for silver, and the ground in various places exhibits the 
appearance of the operations of the workmen, which to this day are 
known by the name of " the siller holes." 

Amongst the mineralogical productions of the parish, pebbles 
should not be omitted to be mentioned, which are often to be found 
of great beauty, and vying with the celebrated Cairngorum. 

Soil — The soil is various. Generally the sub-soil is sand or gra- 
vel with a mixture of moss, and is of more or less fertility. In the up- 
per part of the parish the land is interspersed with heath, and con- 
siderable tracks of moss of various depths and quality. In the lower 
district of the parish, there is much excellent land, producing good 
crops, and well adapted to the turnip husbandry. There the soil is 
generally a sandy loam, with an intermixture of clay and moss. 

Hydrography. — On the farm of south Slipperfield, there is a 
loch or sheet of water, of about a mile and a-half in circumference, 
and of considerable depth, frequented during summer, by flocks of 
water-fowl, abounding in pike and perch, and resorted to in winter 
by those who delight in curling. This sheet of water is nearly in 
the centre of an extensive track of ground, consisting of upwards of 
2000 acres in a state of nature. It is almost entirely covered with 
heath, and presents every variety of moor and moss. On this moor 
various important improvements are carrying on. 

Besides the Lyne traversing the parish from north to south, 
there are the Esk and the Medwin, both arising out of the same 
range of hills to the north,— the former being the eastern, and the 
latter the western boundary of the parish ; as a proof of the height 
of that part of the country, whilst the main branch of the Medwin 
winds its course to Clyde, a stream goes off from it at Garvaldfoot, 
and finds its way to Tweed. The parish everywhere abounds in 
excellent springs of water. None of them are medicinal, except- 
ing one at Rutherford, which goes by the name of " Heaven aqua." 
Who gave it that name, or first discovered its virtues, is not known. 
Situated formerly so as to be extremely difficult of access, the new 



LINTON. 



157 



turnpike road now passes in its immediate vicinity, and a coach 
travels daily between Edinburgh and Dumfries close by the well, 
where an elegant inn, with the best accommodation, may be got 
by those resorting to it. Scientific analysis ascribes to it the qua- 
lities of Tunbridge. 

Botany. — The botanist will find, on the track of 2000 acres be- 
fore-mentioned, a beautiful variety of the Primula farinosa, which 
it is said is rarely to be found in this country. 

Although situated in the immediate vicinity of the Forest of 
Ettrick, there are no remains in the parish of the natural wood 
which at a remote period unquestionably covered it to a great 
extent, as appears from the remains of various kinds of timber 
which are still constantly dug up in the making of peats, — spe- 
cimens being found in a state almost approaching to petrifac- 
tion. The first attempt to supply the decay of the natural 
wood in this parish seems to have been made in compliance with 
the statutes of James II., III., and IV., which enacted, " that 
trees should be planted;" and there were lately, about the old 
farm-steadings, a few straggling ashes and elms, some of which 
are still to be seen, the result of these enactments. About a cen- 
tury ago, there still remained about Linton, according to tradition, 
a considerable deal of valuable timber about the yards and stead- 
ings, which a person, who had acquired about that time extensive 
property there, cut down, and thereby greatly indemnified himself 
of the price which he had paid, but without putting in a single 
plant in compensation of the desolation which he had wrought about 
the village. It was not till about the beginning of the present 
century, that any plantations were made in the parish deserving 
to be noticed under the head of modern improvements, excepting 
some wood at Garvaldfoot, which had been planted about fifty years 
before in hedge-rows, and also in clumps, a good deal of which was 
cut down several years ago. 

II. — Civil History. 
Antiquities. — In the vicinity of Carlops, immediately opposite 
to Newhall house, on the southern bank of the Esk, there is a 
place called Harbour Craig, which is a freestone projecting rock 
over a deep hollow glen, formed by the precipitous banks of two 
streams which here empty themselves in the Esk. On this dreary 
and secluded spot, tradition states that the Covenanters sat down 
after their defeat at the battle of Pentland, and there found a tem- 
porary refuge in the fastness of this sequestered valley, which, 
perhaps, afterwards received the name which it still bears, from

the shelter which it gave to the fugitives on this occasion. On 
the rock there is still to be seen the initials of some of them, to- 
gether with the date of the period when they took up their abode 
in this solitude, and for some time, undisturbed by their enemies, 
performed those religious services to which they were devoted, and 
cheerfully suffered " the loss of all things." 

In several places stone coffins have been found in the parish, 
and also cairns, about which tradition is silent. They have been 
dug up in a bank upon the Lyne in the Temple lands near Lin- 
ton ; and a Roman urn is stated to have been found in a cairn 
still remaining in Garvaldfoot moor. A few years ago, on a rising 
ground called Castlelaw, immediately above Linton on West Third, 
there stood a cairn where there was found a stone coffin rudely 
put together, the contents evidently showing the remains of bones, 
and, from the height to which the stones had been carried, plainly 
manifesting that the body of a person of no small consideration 
had been buried on the spot.  

III. — Population. 

The population remained nearly stationary for some years after 
the publication of the last Statistical Account in 1790. Since that 
period, it has increased by additional hands being employed in 
cotton weaving, agricultural improvements, and the formation of 
roads. 

In 1801, the population was 1090 males 530 females 560 
In 1811, - - 1100 565 565 

In 1821, - - H94 584 610 

In 1831, - - 1577 f 867 710 

In 1832, - - 1350 725 625 

In the villages of Linton and Carlops, there are 572 inhabitants. 
The number of families in the parish in 1831 was - - - 297 

chiefly employed in agriculture, - - °tJ 

in trade, manufactures, and handicraft, 92 

There are 22 heritors' of this parish, having properties from 
L. 100 to L. 600 or L. 700 of land rent per annum, exclusive of 
lime, coal, and freestone. Two heritors reside in the parish. There 
are 32 tenants occupying the land, upon leases of nineteen years 
generally of endurance, and paying from L. 60 to L. 500 of rent, 
besides some parks that are let to graziers for one year. 

The usual variety of tradesmen is to found in this parish. The 
collieries and quarries employ about fifty hands. At the time of 
the publication of the last Statistical Account, two or three looms 
are stated to have been employed in making cotton cloth for Edin- 

• Some notices of minor antiquities will be found in the original MS. 
+ The increased population in 1831 arose from a new turnpike road being set 
agoing that year, and calling for an additional supply of labour.

burgh and Glasgow. There are at present in the parish 83 looms 
employed in that manufacture. Two dozen looms were also stated 
to be employed in customary or household manufacture. ' There 
are at present only two looms in Linton, and three in Carlops em- 
ployed in that trade. There are 5 tailors, 4 dress-makers, 2 but- 
chers, 5 carriers, 9 retailers of meal, groceries, and spirits, 2 sur- 
geons, 4 innkeepers, in the parish. 

Of illegitimate births there are generally about three yearly in 
the parish.

In the last Statistical Report, the number of sheep kept in the 
parish was stated to be, " by a rough computation, about ten thou- 
sand" The number at present is 9640 ; the decrease being 360. 
In explanation of this, it is to be observed, that in 1790 there were 
no Cheviot sheep in the parish, whereas at present, in the number 
now stated, there are of the- Cheviot breed 3660 ; and, wherever 
that sheep is introduced, a smaller number is kept. There is, 
besides, a good deal of land that was formerly stocked with sheep 
now under the plough, or pastured with cattle ; and the importance 
of light stocking is now better understood. 

Husbandry. — The management of both the Cheviot and black- 
faced breeds is the same. The lambs are sold in the Edinburgh 
market, the best, however, being reserved for keeping up the stock, 
in supplying those sold off in the end of the season, or to be kept 
on turnips. If retained and kept all winter, they are sold off as 
hogs at Linton June market. The practice of feeding the old 
cast off ewes upon turnips had just commenced at the time of 
the last Report, and is now universally practised. Various mix- 
tures are now used as substitutes for tar in smearing, which is much 
disused. The chief ingredient employed at present is train-oil and 
cocoa-nut oil. Ewe- milk cheese is very little made in this parish, 
the attention of the farmer being at present directed mainly to the 
carcase, to which milking is unfavourable. 

There is nothing particular in the cattle and corn-farming to be 
remarked which is not in general practice. It may, however, just

be observed, that the parish is not surpassed by any in the county, 
either in regard to the mode of management adopted, or in the 
spirit with which it is conducted. All the modern improvements 
are here to be -found ; and fewer of the old modes which the new 
school of husbandry has exploded are retained than in most 
parishes of the district. Threshing-machines have long been in 
very general use in every farm of any extent, and the in-field and 
out-field system has long been given up. 

Milk-cows are the cattle mostly kept, and their produce finds 
a ready market in Edinburgh. There are also kept on several of 
the farms Highland cattle bought at Falkirk and Hallow Fair, which 
are kept in winter, and either sold off in the spring, or put to pas- 
ture, to be fed for the butcher on the farm. The milk-cows are 
nearer the Ayrshire breed than any other. The Teeswater are also 
kept, and crosses of these kinds are the general stock of the parish. 

Live-Stock.— The number both of horses and cattle is consi- 
derably increased, from a circumstance already stated. The num- 
ber stated in the last Report was 460 cattle, and 130 horses. There 
are now 772 cattle,— which explains the smaller number of sheep 
kept at present than in 1790. The present number of horses is 

17 Rate of Wages.— Of late, wages have rather declined from their 
former rates. This season wages have been from L. 10 to L. 13 
for men, with victuals. Women-servants were hired at Linton 
spring market on March 29, 1833, from L. 3 to L. 4, and upwards, 
for the summer half-year. Last summer labourers received, with- 
out victuals, from 9s. to 10s. weekly. Cotton-weavers at one pe- 
riod gained as high as 14s. per week. At present they hardly 
earn above 5s. during that period. 

Produce.-The average gross amount and value of raw produce 

yearly raised in the parish, is 

4000 quarters of oats, which at present prices may be estimated at in pounds Ster-

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Markets. — From time immemorial sheep markets have been held 
at Linton, and of late one market is held on the last Tuesday of June. 
The sheep produced are principally one year old or hogs, sls they are 
called, and come from all the surrounding counties.  They were 
brought in former times to be sent to the Highlands ; but of late, 
for the most part, they are sent to Fife, Perth, Angus-shire, Lam- 
mermuir, and the English fairs. Earl Wemyss, as superior, draws 
a custom of Is. Id. per score at this market. Of late years the 
store-masters have established a market here on the Friday before 
the first Monday of April and on the Friday before the 25th of 
September, chiefly for the disposal of stock and hiring servants, — 
which promises to be a great convenience to the district. In the 
month of August a show of stock is held here, and the breeds pro- 
duced are allowed to be creditable to the district. In the winter 
months a ploughing match is held, and four prizes are given to the 
best workmen, which is found to be attended with good effects in 
exciting emulation, both in regard to their particular occupation, 
and in keeping their horses in good plight, as well as their various 
utensils and furniture. 

Villages. — Linton is situated nearly in the centre of the parish. 
It consists of 90 houses, and contains 395 inhabitants, — 160 
males, and 235 females. It is irregularly built, and, from several 
of the houses having their gables to the street, has some appear- 
ance of antiquity. One of the houses of this description tradition 
states to have been contemporary with Drochil Castle 1578, or as 
it is written, Droich holes in ancient deeds. This house, now be- 
longing to Sir John Hay, it is understood, was built by the same 
tradesmen who were employed about the castle, and who, being 
allowed Saturday to themselves, occupied their time in building 
this house, which has been inhabited ever since ; whilst the massy 
stately fortress of Regent Morton was never either inhabited or 
finished. A medical gentleman of much experience, and re- 
sident here for some years, authorizes me to state, " That 
he has found the village to be peculiarly healthy, not having 
observed for several years any thing almost in the shape of dis- 
ease, excepting influenza and scarlatina. This healthy state 

For some years, one market has been held on the last Tuesday of June, where 
the whole business of the season is settled. The Highlands now being fully stocked, 
the sheep are sent as above-stated. To understand the statement in regard to our 
markets, it is necessary to observe, that formerly there were four markets : two in 
the last week of June and first week of July, and two in the second and third weeks 
of July in succession.

of the people he ascribes to the situation of the village upon 
the banks of the Lyne, whose course, through a glen-like conca- 
vity, keeps up an incessant current of air, keen, bracing, and invi- 
gorating, and thus counteracts the ordinary causes of pestilential 
distemper ; whilst, at the same time, a fine exposure to the south, 
and a double range of hills to the north, affords considerable shel- 
ter during the greatest inclemency of the season." 

Formerly six families occupied the site of the village of Carlops, 
now consisting of 36 houses, and containing 177 inhabitants. They 
are mostly cotton-weavers. 

Means of Communication.— The old road from Edinburgh being 
very ill directed, the approach to the village, both from the west 
and the east, was extremely difficult for a carriage of any descrip- 
tion ; but by a new line lately made and opened last year, various 
dangerous acclivities were avoided, and, bringing into view the vil- 
lage, which was formerly quite hid from the traveller, it has already 
been considerably improved in its appearance by new houses being 
erected, whilst two inns also have been built on this road, one at Lin- 
ton, and another at Rutherford, with post-horses and every accom- 
modation which the public could wish. A new line of road from 
Carlops to Ingraston, to the south of the old road, was not long ago 
formed. The trustees of Lanarkshire and Mid-Lothian gave every 
encouragement to this undertaking, but the majority of those in the 
county of Peebles gave every opposition to it. At length, after 
much opposition and delay, an act of Parliament was obtained, au- 
thorizing the new line under the direction of Mr Jardine, cml-en- 
gineer, in which there is not a rise of more than one foot m thirty- 
seven; and six heritors of Linton undertook at their own risk, upon 
getting an assignation of the tolls, to make this road, which has been 
made accordingly, and was opened more than twelve months ago,- 
traversing the parish for six miles, and giving universal satisfaction 
to the public. There is perhaps no trust in the county at present 
whose revenue affords a better prospect of providing a fund at once 
for reducing the debt, and for keeping the roads under it in the 

best state of repair. 

It may be added, that it would be of no small importance to the 
public that a road in continuation of that lately made to Badens- 
gilL towards the Caldstane slap, should be executed, so as to open 
a proper communication with the other side of the hill, and to 
the north by Falkirk, Stirling, and Queensferry It is obvious 
that such a measure appears to be equally beneficial to the other 
side of the slap, the county of Mid and West-Lothian open- 



LINTON. 



163 



ing up to them a more ready and direct communication to the 
south. As nearly three miles of this road from Linton have already 
been made, it remains with the gentlemen to the north of the slap 
to show an equally favourable disposition to the undertaking, and 
they may be assured that they will be readily met by the heritors 
of Linton from the south. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church and manse were built in 1781. 
To the manse are attached the ordinary offices and a garden, with 
fourteen acres of arable land. The stipend consists of fifteen chal- 
ders, half barley and half meal, payable at the rate of the fiars of 
the county. When grain gives L. 1 per boll, it may be calculated 
at L. 240 ; at present it is below that sum. 

There are two classes of dissenters in the parish. One of them, 
the United Secession church, has a meeting-house in Linton. The 
number of communicants belonging to it in this parish at present is 
124, the rest of the congregation being made up from the six neigh- 
bouring parishes. The other sect of dissenters belong to the Re- 
lief, and have a meeting-house in the parish of Newlands, and fifty 
members belonging to Linton form part of that congregation. In 
this parish there are 300 communicants belonging to the Establish- 
ed church. 

Education.— Mr Thomas Brown, a preacher of the gospel, is 
schoolmaster, with the maximum salary of L. 34 Sterling, and a 
house and garden. His terms of teaching are 2s. per quarter for 
English reading; and including writing, arithmetic, and Latin, 
are respectively 2s. 6d., 3s., and 5s. per quarter. The number of 
scholars during the winter quarters is about 100, and nearly the 
same in spring and during the rest of the year. The ordinary 
branches of education, with geography, are taught. Classical li- 
terature here is rather on the decline at present. L. 10 a-year, 
exclusive of wages of teaching, may be the amount of his other 
emoluments. A considerable part of the population being situated 
about three miles and upwards from the parish school, many of the 
children attend two private schools in the eastern part of the pa- 
rish and at Nmemileburn, in Penicuick ; also at Dolphinton, 
Kirkurd, and at Lamancha, in the parish of Newlands. Two Sab- 
bath evening schools are held at Linton and one at Carlops, where 
the Scriptures are read, and examinations of the children also are 
carried on. There are at present attending the Sabbath evening 
school of Linton about 70, and at Carlops, 40. 

Library.— k parish library was begun about forty years ago, 
and consists of upwards of 500 volumes on history, travels, essays, 



164 



PEEBLES-SIIIRE. 



&amp;c. &amp;c &amp;c. It excludes all books on theological and political con- 
troversy. 

Poor.— Certain it is that pauperism has been on the increase. 
No doubt this may be attributed to the late increase of the popula- 
tion, consisting chiefly as it does of the lower orders ; and also to the 
greater liberality of the times, which pays more attention than for- 
merly to the wants of the people, and which, on every occasion of 
the rise of the price of provisions, has led to measures which m 
other days would never have been looked upon as called for. Ac- 
cordingly, whilst for ten years previous to 1782 the parochial ex- 
pense did not exceed L. 20, and for the next ten years the annual 
sum amounted only to L. 25, it has since gradually risen to L. 100 
and upwards annually, and last year it was L.118, from which falls 
only to be deducted the allowances L.8, 14s. made to the pre- 
centor and session-clerk, together with the dues of the beadle, 
presbytery, and synod clerks. For a good many years no heritor 
had a permanent residence within the parish,— an arrangement 
which may be presumed to have been hurtful to the parish both in 
regard to matters of police and in regard to the poor, who could 
not fail to be benefited by the residence of the wealthy. In the 
circumstances of the parish adverted to, and when none of the rents 
are returned to it in the encouragement of the industry of the in- 
habitants, it could not be expected that the church collections, to- 
gether with the usual funds arising from the use of the mortcloth, 
the fee at the proclamation of banns, and the interest of L.229 of 
mortified money, should be adequate to supply the wants of the 
poor, more especially during periods of peculiar pressure and exi- 
gency. Accordingly, it was proposed to the heritors, that they 
should enter into a voluntary subscription, in supplement ot the 
above ordinary funds, and in proportion to their respective interests 
in the parish. This measure was heartily gone into, and the sum 
of L 60 has been raised annually for the above purpose, and in 
times of peculiar distress this sum has been proportionally increased. 
In a parish like this, where there is a small proportion of resident he- 
ritors, whose duty and interest it is to give a helping hand to the poor, 
and a tenantry, all paying pretty tight rents, much occupied about 
their own proper business, and often necessarily absent from home, 
there seem to be insuperable difficulties in carrying into effect any 
measures similar to those recommended and practised with success 
bv Dr Chalmers in the differently constituted parish of St John s. 

Friendly Society, c.-There is a friendly society m the parish;

years, to which the people of this parish have access ; and both 
institutions have been observed to be attended with great benefit 
to those who have had the good sense to avail themselves of the 
privileges which they confer. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

The great body of the people enjoy in a very considerable de- 
gree the conveniences and comforts of life. They are industrious 
and enterprising, as well as exemplary in the stations of life which 
they occupy. In former times the inhabitants who used animal food 
were in the practice of laying up about Martinmas sueh salted pro- 
visions of that article as would serve for the ensuing year. This 
mode is much discontinued, and beef, as well as lamb and mutton, 
being much more generally used than formerly, are obtained of ex- 
cellent quality, at all times, from two butchers, carrying on their trade 
in Linton. Within the same period a considerable change has also 
taken place in regard to dress, as well as the mode of living. The 
reduced number of household or customer weavers in the parish, 
alluded to under a preceding article, is a sufficient proof, if any 
other were wanting, that hodden-gray "of the gudewife's spinning," 
together with some other manufacture of the same material, forms 
hardly any part of the attire either of our male or female population. 

Although at the publication of the last Statistical Account the 
improved system of husbandry had commenced, it was not till some 
years afterwards that it was generally adopted. Among the most 
important improvements has been the draining, by Mr John Hume, 
of Linton bog, a morass of 100 acres, which has been brought un- 
der the plough. Various important operations were also set agoing 
by Mr Goldie and Mr Kerr in enclosing, planting, and draining on 
Leadlaw, Rutherford, and Broomlee, which have greatly improved, 
as well as ornamented, these properties, formerly in a state very 
unproductive ; and whilst a few straggling hogs were all that was 
to be seen, picking up what they could find on these wild moors, 
there have been grazing this summer stocks of excellent cattle and 
sheep ; while there are most extensive fields of turnip, on one of 
which, perhaps the largest and best of the parish, sheep was fed 
off, and the other crops of the rotation were going on. Mr Robert- 
son, tenant in Broomlee, gained the highest prize for black-faced 
tups at the Highland Society's show of stock held at Stirling last 
autumn, and sold them on the same day at five guineas a-head. 
The rental of the parish, which was at the publication of last Sta- 
tistical Account L. 2350, is at present, as taken up by three of the 
most intelligent tenants of this parish, L. 6560.

PRESBYTERY OF PEEBLES, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND TWEEDDALE. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER AFFLECK, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Extent, Boundaries, Name. — The parish of Lyne is between three 
and four miles in length, and about three in breadth. It is bound- 
ed on the west by Newlands ; on the north by Eddleston ; on the 
east by Peebles, and on the south by Stobo. The name is of un- 
certain origin. By some it has been supposed to arise from Una, a 
Gaelic word signifying water, as the largest stream which enters the 
Tweed within the county skirts the parish through its whole extent, 
from the western to the eastern extremity of it. 

Topographical Appearances. — Lyne, in the greater portion of it, 
has a southern exposure sloping from the summits of the hills to- 
wards the rivulet by which it is separated from the parish of Stobo. 
The arable ground in some places is nearly level, but in general it 
has a declivity; and, by declining southward, it obtains the full benefit 
of the solar rays, while it is sheltered from the piercing winds of the 
north. Most of the soil is of a gravelly description, and in ordi- 
nary years, when rain is not deficient, the crops are good. The 
hills are covered with wholesome pasture for sheep, affording that 
variety of heath and grass which is by many accounted so desirable. 
They are of inconsiderable height, stretching in a range parallel 
to the water of Lyne; but about a mile from the eastern limit of 
the parish, they suddenly recede to a greater distance from it, leav- 
ing an ample intervening space well adapted for cultivation. The 
rocks, which seldom appear above the surface, are what is termed 
in the district whinstone, commonly, however, inclining to slate. 

The rivulet is of considerable magnitude ; it rises near the con- 
fines of Tweeddale and West Lothian ; and, taking an easterly 
direction, it runs through the parishes of Linton and Newlands 
and a little below the parish of Lyne is united with the Tweed, af- 
ter a course of about twelve or thirteen miles.

LYNE AND MEGGET.

Whatever may have been the state of Lyne in former times, 
it is at present almost divested of trees, belts of which would be a 
great improvement, as they would not only be ornamental but ad- 
vantageous, tending to diminish the violence with which the wind 
frequently blows from the west and the east. 

The parish is certainly not insalubrious, and there is no pre- 
vailing disease among the inhabitants which might be supposed 
to arise from some local peculiarity. 

Megget, which is situate at the southern extremity of Peebles- 
shire, and which at one time seems to have been named Rodonno, 
is distant from Lyne about fourteen miles, with the river Tweed and 
the parish of Manner intervening between them. It is above six 
miles in length, and in some places more than five in breadth. It is 
bounded on the east by Yarrow ; on the south by Ettrick and Mof- 
fat; on the west by Tweedsmuir; and on the north by Manner. It 
is almost entirely covered with hills, which extend in two parallel 
ranges from west to east, having between them a narrow valley, 
which scarcely in any part exceeds a quarter of a mile in breadth. 
In this valley the soil is extremely various, but the greater portion 
of it seems to be very unsuitable for agriculture. There are parts, 
however, especially near the farm-houses of Cramilt and Hender- 
land, where it is of a much better description, and where crops are 
obtained not inferior to many in lower situations. Through this 
level ground runs Megget water, which rises about the western li- 
mit of the parish, and though its course is short, it soon becomes 
a considerable stream by the accessions which it obtains in its pro- 
gress ; and at the eastern boundary it is received by St Mary's loch, 
a large and beautiful expanse of water, which yearly attracts a 
number of persons who are eager to behold so pleasing an object, 
and to enjoy the amusement of angling. On the hills, which oc- 
cupy most part of the parish, there is a diversity of soil. There 
are places where it is shallow and dry, but commonly it is deep and 
wet, and it affords excellent pasture, which produces superior sheep. 

Megget is in one of the most elevated districts in the south of 
Scotland, and some of the hills rise from their base to a consider- 
able height : there is consequently some degree of damp and cold 
in the climate, but this is not such as to impair the health of the 
inhabitants. 

 Some ancient historians mention that gold had been found in n stream thai runs 
down Glcngaber into Megget water, and traces of the labour employed in searching 
for it are still discernible, but it docs not appear that any has been discovered in mo- 
dern times.

II. — Civil History. 
Antiquities. — As Megget approaches the confines of England 
and Scotland, it may be supposed that when the two kingdoms 
were governed by different sovereigns, its inhabitants would expe- 
rience the disturbance, and be distinguished by the character and 
habits, which were then so prevalent among the borderers. There 
are in it the remains of two old towers, which were probably de- 
signed for security and for defence against hostile aggressions, and 
also as watch towers, from which signals might be perceived and 
given when unexpected incursions were made. — At Henderland there 
are the vestiges of a chapel and burying-ground, and a tombstone 
of Cockburn of Henderland, a noted freebooter, with an inscription 
which is still legible. — About a quarter of a mile west from Lyne 
church is a Roman camp, which, notwithstanding the time that has 
elapsed since its formation, and the operations to which it has been 
exposed, still presents a very distinct appearance. Its situation 
indicates the military prudence which characterized the conquerors 
of the world. A road leading to it is still visible. Its interior has 
often been subjected to culture, and Roman coins are said to 
have frequently been discovered in it ; but what these were, or 
whither they were conveyed, it would now be difficult to ascertain. 

The church at Lyne is a solid and ancient edifice. It can scarcely 
be doubted that it had been built before the Reformation of reli- 
gion in Scotland. On an oaken seat the year 1644 is marked. 
The pulpit, which is of the same material, seems to be of a simi- 
lar age. About thirty years ago a chapel was built in Megget for 
public worship, with an apartment in it designed for a school-room. 

Land-ow7iers. — The land-owners, none of whom reside in the 
parish, are, the Earl of Wemyss, Mr William Murray of Hender- 
land, and Mr William Purdie, proprietor of Lyne Town Head. 

Parochial Registers. — A register was begun in January 1649, 
in which were concisely stated the acts of the session, purposes of 
marriage, baptisms, weekly collections and disbursements for the 
poor. But there have been at times long blanks in the record, or 
large portions of it must have been lost. In the course of time it 
seems to have been almost confined to receipts and expenditure in 
behalf of the indigent. But for a number of years past this regis- 
ter has been more carefully and regularly kept. There has hitherto 
been no register of deaths, and that of births is not quite complete, 
as some parents, especially dissenters, often neglect to record in it.

III. — Population. 

The population of Lyne and Megget appears to have been much 

greater in former times than at present. In the year 1755, it 

amounted to 265, and probably it was then considerably less than 

it had previously been. 

In 1792, it was 152 71 males. 81 females. 



1801, 167 67 100 

1811, 196 95 101 

1821, 176 87 89 

1831, 156 83 73 



The decrease of the population appears to have been chiefly 
occasioned by the junction of farms, by the absence of several clas- 
ses of tradesmen who formerly were in the parish, and by the in- 
creasing number in Megget of non-resident tenants. The parish 
record shows that for a series of years two marriages, and three, 
often four, births, have annually occurred. The population is en- 
tirely rural. About the end of 1833 there were in the parish 159 
persons, males 83, females 76. Of these there were, 

Below 15 years, - 63 
Between 15 and 30, - 53 
Between 30 and 50, - 27 
Between 50 and 70, - 16 
Number of families in the parish, - - 26 

of families chiefly employed in agriculture, - . £3 

in trade and manufactures, or handicraft, 5 
Number of unmarried men, bachelors and widowers, upwards of 50 years of age, 4 
of unmarried women, including widows, upwards of 45, - 3 

There is no individual of independent fortune residing in the 
parish. There are three proprietors of land of the yearly value of 
L. 50 and upwards. 

There is no person in this parish who is insane, or fatuous, or 
blind, or deaf, or dumb, or deformed. 

Character of the People. — The inhabitants of the parish certainly 
enjoy in a reasonable degree the advantages and comforts of social 
life, and no symptom of discontentment with their condition is per- 
ceptible. They are reflecting and intelligent. They have a taste 
for knowledge and for reading ; and, what is of much greater im- 
portance at . a time when scepticism and a disposition to remove 
needful restraints are very prevalent, they show a becoming regard 
to religion and morality. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy.— All the males in the parish 
who have arrived at a suitable age, with the exception of five arti- 
sans, are engaged in rural affairs. 

It is calculated that above 700 Scotch acres are either under cul- 
tivation, or are occasionally ploughed, and that probably more than 
11,000 acres are always kept in pasture for sheep. It is not easy 



170 



PEEBLES-SHIRE. 



to determine whether capital might be used with advantage for the 
extension of agriculture, especially in Megget, where the distance 
from lime and from any additional manure that might be required 
is so very great. It is likely, however, that 50 or 60 acres might 
be added to the cultivated land with a reasonable expectation of 
profit. About 20 acres in separate places have been lately planted 
with the usual varieties of wood. These plantations exhibit proofs 
of the good taste and public spirit of the proprietors. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of arable land is L. 1 per acre, 
or rather more. The rent of grazing is estimated at L. 3 for an 
ox or cow, and 5s. for a ewe or full-grown sheep ; but in some high 
situations, where storms in winter may be very injurious, it is a little 
less, about 4s. 9d. 

Rate of Wages. — The wages of male farm-servants are from 
L. 10 to L. 13 per annum ; of female from L. 6 to L. 7, with vic- 
tuals and lodging. Male-servants who are married, instead of food 
and accommodation in the house of their masters, have a free 
house for themselves and families, six and a-half bolls of oatmeal, 
pasture for a cow in summer, and fodder in winter, ground for 
planting half a boll of potatoes, and coal or peat brought for their 
use, all which, with the payment in money, may amount to L. 24 
or L. 25 per annum. Shepherds, as a remuneration for their labour, 
have pasture for 40 or 45 sheep, with food and lodging in the 
house of their masters. If married, they have, like those who are 
employed in agriculture, a separate habitation, the same quantity 
of oatmeal, six bolls and a-half, pasture and fodder for a cow, com- 
monly a piece of ground for potatoes, and the conveyance of fuel, 
which, with the produce of their sheep, may be estimated at above 
L. 30 Sterling per year. But the amount of their wages is very 
uncertain, varying with the seasons and the state of the markets. 
Masons and carpenters have from 15s. to 18s. per week, with- 
out victuals; and slaters from 18s. to L. 1. Day-labourers re- 
ceive 2s. and upwards per day, in summer, and from Is. 8d. to Is. 
lOd. in winter. 

Breeds of Live-Stock.— The cattle are generally a mixture of 
the Ayrshire and short-horned breeds. One-half of the sheep are 
black-faced ; the other half are Cheviot, or a mixture of these. 

Husbandry.— The farmers are men of capital, intelligence, and 
enterprise. They are very attentive to their flocks and their herds, 
and skilful in the management of them. They readily use anj 
expedient for melioration which experience has proved to be effi- 
cacious. They consider the nature of the land winch they occu- 



LYNE AND MEGGET. 



171 



py, and select the breed, or intermixture of breeds, that seems to 
be best adapted to it. They are connected with local Associations 
that are formed for the purpose of encouraging exertion, by con- 
ferring premiums on successful competitors. The husbandry 
which prevails in the parish is that which is most approved in the 
district. Fallowing, liming, raising of turnips, and artificial grass 
engage a suitable degree of attention. Draining is practised 
wherever it is deemed requisite. Several pieces of waste land have 
been reclaimed. Embankments in various places have been con- 
structed along the sides of the rivulets to prevent the injury which 
might be occasioned by inundations. No hay or straw is disposed 
of by sale ; all is consumed in the parish. Indeed hay from artifi- 
cial grass is seldom produced. Fields sown with the seeds of clover 
and rye-grass are commonly pastured. And, on the whole, agri- 
cultural operations seem to be conducted in that judicious manner 
which renders the ground most productive to the farmer, and most 
valuable to the proprietor. 

The fences which form the enclosures appear to be in a suffi- 
cient state. The farm-houses are good and commodious, well- 
fitted for the accommodation of respectable tenants. The Earl 
of Wemyss has lately caused to be erected in Megget six substan- 
tial houses for shepherds, built of stone and lime, and neatly co- 
vered with excellent slates, which give an improved appearance to 
that part of the parish. Leases generally are for a period of 19 
years. Previous to the death of the late Duke of Queensberry, 
and for some time subsequent to that event, the doubts which were 
entertained concerning the legality of leases which he had given 
had an unfavourable influence on agriculture. But when a deci- 
sion had been finally given in the House of Lords, which ended 
the litigation, and new leases had been obtained from the Earl of 
Wemyss and March, increased exertions were soon perceptible. 
No symptom of deficiency of capital can be discerned. The far- 
mers are active and enterprising, and withhold no expense which 
is needful in their operations. The proprietors facilitate their ef- 
forts by affording every convenience and means of success which 
can reasonably be desired. — There are very few hedges in the pa- 
rish, but stone fences in a suitable state are numerous. These 
have been lately extended over most of the arable land, forming a 
range of convenient enclosures. 

Produce. — The produce of the parish is extremely fluctuating : 
and it is not easy to state an average amount. The following calcula- 
tion relates to the present period, and cannot be far from the truth :

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication. — There are four miles of turnpike 
roads in the parish. Carriers pass weekly through Lyne, convey- 
ing merchandise between Hawick and Glasgow. For some years 
during the summer a coach has passed daily between Glasgow and 
Kelso, but in the winter it has hitherto been discontinued. There 
are two bridges over the stream that separates Lyne from Stobo, 
and one over the water of Megget, all of which are in good con- 
dition. 

Ecclesiastical State— The situation of the parish church in 
Lyne is as eligible as any that could have been selected. It is 
scarcely more than a mile from any of the inhabited houses which 
are placed around it. The precise period when it was built is now 
unknown, but it exhibits evident proofs of antiquity, and probably 
several centuries have elapsed since its erection. About forty 
years ago, on the occasion of a repair, as the population had greatly 
decreased, its length in the inside was diminished by a partition 
wall which was constructed, and was designed to bound the space 
intended for seats. It still, however, affords accommodation for 
about 80 persons, and at ordinary times 20 more might avail them- 
selves of the communion table. In 1830 it underwent a repair, 
chiefly in the flooring and seats, and the windows also were neatly 
supplied with glass suited to their antique form. All the seats are 
free to those by whom they are occupied. 

In 1829 a new and commodious manse was built. It is obvious, 
therefore, that the heritors have manifested no disinclination to the 
cause of religion, and no repugnance to supply the means of support- 
ing it. The chapel in Megget, erected about thirty years ago for the 
convenience of public worship, with an apartment in it designed for 
a school, was built, not at the expense of the heritors, but with 

 The price of sheep, lambs, and wool rose greatly during 1833, and may have 
surpassed the estimate which has now been given, but it should be remembered 

a Trcviously it must often have been below it, and, if there be an excess it ,s 
doubtful whether it would be more than sufficient to counterbalance the effects of 
disease and casualties which yearly occur.

money otherwise obtained, combined with the aid of the resident 
farmers, who assisted in collecting materials for so useful an edifice. 

Mr Mitchelson, who was minister of Lyne above a century ago, 
bequeathed to the parish a sum of L. 50 Sterling, the interest of 
which was designed for the promotion of literary and religious 
knowledge among the parishioners. This interest was given to 
the schoolmaster before the establishment of a legal salary, and 
has always been employed in accordance with the will of the be- 
nevolent donor. 

The stipend is L. 149, 5s. 9d., with L. 4, 3s. 4d. for communion 
elements. The glebe is about fifteen Scotch acres, but in a con- 
siderable part of it the soil is inferior, and it was augmented to its 
present extent in the time of the preceding incumbent, who re- 
ceived an increase of glebe in exchange for a servitude or right of 
pasturage on the lands of Lyne. 

There are 18 families that attend the Established church, and 8 that 
are connected with dissenters. Of the latter, 2 are adherents of the 
Cameronians; 2 of the Seceders; and 4 of the Relief body. Both the 
members of the Established church, and those who belong to other 
denominations, show a becoming regard to public worship and reli- 
gious instruction. The dissenters have no place of meeting in the 
parish, and almost the half of them are so extremely distant from 
congregations with which they are connected, that they have very 
few opportunities of hearing preachers of their own persuasion. 
About 50 communicate in the parish, and some who are prevent- 
ed by requisite attention to flocks and houses, attend in the neigh- 
bouring parishes at their sacramental occasions. 

The people take an interest in the diffusion of religious know- 
ledge, and in the removal or alleviation of human suffering ; but 
• as the parish is extremely small, and as the one-half of it is at a 
considerable distance from the other, it is customary for individuals 
to co-operate with the societies which exist in the more populous 
parishes that are contiguous to them. 

Education. — There are two schools in the parish, — one at Lyne, 
and another at Megget. The parochial school is at Lyne. The 
salary is the minimum, — L. 25, 13s. 3d. The school fees are, 
for English reading, 2s. ; for reading and writing, 2s. 6d. : and for 
reading, writing, and arithmetic, 3s. 6d. per quarter. They may 
amount to upwards of L. 12 annually ; and the teacher's other emo- 
luments may amount to L. 2, 10s. a-year. Reading arrd spelling, 
English grammar, writing, and arithmetic, are taught. The Bible 
is used. The national catechism, psalms, and paraphrases, are 



174 



PEEBLES-SHIRE. 



committed to memory; and means are employed for giving the 
children a juster notion of the meaning of words, that the treasures 
contained in books may be more profitable to them. The teacher 
has the legal accommodations, excepting the garden, which is not 
of the required extent ; but this is compensated by an annual' sum 
of L. 2, paid by the heritors. The school in Megget, on account 
of the state of the roads, — the numerous streams which intersect 
them, — and the usual severity of the weather, is not kept during 
the winter. A teacher is engaged, who begins his labours about 
Whitsunday, and continues them till Martinmas following. The 
heritors have allowed L. 7 yearly for the support of the school. 
The parents of the scholars furnish the teacher in succession with 
board and lodging. The instruction given is the same in every 
particular as that which is afforded in the school of Lyne. There 
is probably not an individual in the whole parish ten years of age, 
certainly none fifteen years old, who is unable to read, and few, if 
any, who are not able both to read and to write. 

There is neither circulating library, nor friendly society, nor 
saving bank, in the parish; but individuals avail themselves of those 
that exist in other places. Generally, the more permanent ser- 
vants in the parish, remote from the dissipation of towns, and cha- 
racterized by frugality and diligence, amass sums, which they de- 
posit in the common banks of the country. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — For a long period of time, there 
have been no poor who were permanently supported by the parish, 
but individuals and families in protracted affliction have often re- 
ceived temporary aid, and for such occasional assistance, the col- 
lections in the church have as yet been sufficient, though, as the 
parish is small and divided, and without any resident heritor, these 
are necessarily of small amount. The average yearly amount of 
church collections is L. 2, 6s. There is a general disposition to 
avoid, if possible, dependence on parochial aid : and for several 
years there have been no poor in the parish. 

Inns, Src. — There is neither inn nor alehouse, nor place of any 
description where ardent spirits are sold. 

Fuel— As the distance from other kinds of fuel is great, peat 
alone is used in Megget. It is mostly obtained on the hills, and 
it requires a considerable expense of time and labour. Coal is 
solely employed in Lyne. It is brought from Mid-Lothian and 
the northern limits of the parish of Newlands. Its costs about 
17s. per ton, with a little more or less, according to the difference 
of quality or distance.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 



ON THE COUNTY OF PEEBLES.</head>
<p> 
BY THE REV. JOHN ELLIOT, 

MINISTER OF PEEBLES. 



This county is sometimes termed the county of Peebles from 
its capital, and sometimes Tweeddale from the Tweed, which runs 
through the whole district. It lies between 55° 24/ and 55° 50' 
north latitude, and from 2° 45' to 3° 23' longitude west from Lon- 
don. Its extreme length, from north to south, is about 30 miles, 
and its greatest breadth, from east to west, is about 22. It is 
bounded on the north by the county of Mid-Lothian ; on the south, 
by Selkirk and Dumfries ; on the east, by Selkirk and Mid-Lo- 
thian ; and on the west by Lanark. By some it is computed to 
contain 338 square miles, or 216,320 English acres. According 
to Armstrong, in his Companion to the Map, who says that he 
made an actual survey with a chain, it contains 251,320 English 
acres. Mr Findlater allows a smaller number of acres to a square 
mile than Armstrong, and gives 229,779 acres. 

General Appearances. — Tweeddale may be considered the most 
elevated county in the south of Scotland, as only a very small part 
of it on the banks of the Tweed where it enters Selkirkshire is so 
low as between 400 and 500 feet above the level of the sea. The 
highest range of mountains is that which forms the southern boun- 
dary, commencing at the eastern extremity of Traquair parish, and 
extending to the borders of Lanarkshire. Along the summit of 
these mountains runs the boundary line, from each side of which 
descend streams which flow into seas on the opposite sides of the 
island. A great part of this mountain range presents a dismal and 
forbidding aspect, where a shepherd's cottage is almost the onlv 
habitation to be seen. Even the names of places graphically de- 
scribe their character and inhospitable appearance, such as Dead 
for caulal in Megget parish. A lofty ridge of mountains separates 
the parishes of Innerleithen and Eddlestone from Mid-Lothian on 
the east; and on the north, the Water of Leith, the Medwin, a tri- 
butary of the Clyde, and the Lyne, a tributary of the Tweed, all 
have their sources in the Pentland Hills, the boundary in that quarter. 
Like most mountainous counties, the boundaries are ill-defined, par- 
ticularly towards the south-east, where Selkirk makes several in-

dentations, and where some land lies of which it is difficult to say 
whether it belongs to that county or to Peebles. A small part of 
the parishes of Innerleithen and of Peebles lies in Selkirkshire.  

Ewers. — The only river is the Tweed which, with three trifling 
exceptions, drains the whole county. None of its tributaries are 
dignified with the appellation of river, f but receive flie name of 
waters, the next in degree. The streams that rise in the county 
and do not fall into the Tweed, are the Medwin, already mention- 
ed, commencing in the parish of Linton, the North Esk, which rises 
in the same parish, and the South-Esk, which has its source in Ed- 
dlestone parish ; the last two streams afterwards unite and fall into 
the sea at Musselburgh. The course of the Tweed is north-east, 
till it reaches the parish of Peebles, when it takes an easterly di- 
rection. There is a circumstance well known to store-farmers and 
shepherds in this district, which I am not aware has ever been ac- 
counted for, but which is worthy of investigation. As long as the 
Tweed flows in a north-east direction, the hills on both sides of it 
are equally healthy for sheep pasture, and the disease called sick- 
ness is very little known. As soon as the river takes an easterly 
direction, the sheep on the right bank become subject to that dis- 
ease, and also to what is termed the louping-ill, to an extent ten 
times greater than what takes place among those on the left bank, 
which has a southern exposure. 

Ecclesiastical State.— All the parishes in this county belong to 
the Presbytery of Peebles, except Skirling and the united parishes 
of Broughton, Kilbucho and Glenholm, which belong to the Pres- 
bytery of Biggar. It is probably owing to this ecclesiastical ar- 
rangement that these last named parishes are often not recognized 
as belonging to the county of Peebles, but are transferred to Lanark. 
There is perhaps nothing more objectionable in our church economy 
than the division or union of parishes, in which it frequently happens 
that very little attention has been paid to the comfort either of the 
minister or his people. Thus a considerable part of Drummelzier 
lies on the west side of the Tweed, which, when flooded, prevents 
the inhabitants of that district from attending the parish church. 
When the parish of Dawick was suppressed in 1742, and added to 
Stobo and Drummelzier, the difficulty of crossing the Tweed to 
attend the church of Stobo never seems to have been considered.

ON THE COUNTY OF PEEBLES. 177 

Why the parishes of Broughton, Kilbucho, and Glenholm were 
united it is difficult to conjecture. It was deemed expedient to 
continue a schoolmaster in each ; it would probably have been as 
advisable to continue a minister in each of them also. If any 
union was to have taken place, it should have been the annexation 
of that part of Drummelzier which lies west of the Tweed to the 
parish of Glenholm. The parishes of Lyne and Megget are united 
ecclesiastically, though the whole of Manner lies between them. 
The distance from the manse of Lyne to the church of Megget is 
14 or 15 miles, and when the Tweed is flooded, the minister must 
go round by Peebles, and he has thus upwards of 20 miles to 
travel. A great error was committed a few years ago by the 
Presbytery, which I the more readily point out, being then a mem- 
ber of that body. Instead of sanctioning the building of the manse 
at Lyne, they ought rather to have recommended that it should be 
placed at Megget, to which part of Ettrick and of the extensive pa- 
rish of Yarrow might have been added, quoad sacra. Lyne, which 
consists of only two farms, might quoad sacra have been united to 
Stobo or Peebles. The Earl of Wemyss and March is sole pro- 
prietor of both parishes, with the exception of the property of 
Henderland and Lyne Town Head, and, from his Lordship's well 
known anxiety on all occasions to meet the wishes and consult 
the comfort of all his ministers, no difficulty whatever on his part 
would have been thrown in the way to prevent the above arrange- 
ments from being carried into effect. 

Roads. Means of Communication. — The county is very well 
intersected by roads, except the parishes on the right bank of the 
Tweed ; and though there is but a scanty population, and there 
never could be a great thoroughfare, it would be of great advantage 
to the inhabitants in that district to have a bridge across the river 
between the bridges of Peebles and Tweedsmuir, and a line of 
communication opened to the road from Selkirk to Moffat. The 
mail-coach from Edinburgh to Dumfries passes daily through the 
parishes of Newlands, Kirkurd, Broughton and Tweedsmuir, and 
a letter bag is forwarded from Leadburn Toll to Peebles and the 
adjoining districts. There is a daily coach between Peebles and 
Edinburgh, and during the summer season two coaches run, chief- 
ly on account of the visitors to Innerleithen. For some years past 
a coach has run during the summer season between Glasgow and 
Kelso passing through Peebles. The tolls of the county are this 
year let lor L.2991, to which may be added L. 360 paid by the 
Post- Office for the mail-coach.

178   HNERAL observations 

Agriculture. — A pretty general impression prevails that the 
plough has encroached too much on the sides of the hills, and that 
much land that is now arable would have been far more advanta- 
geously continued as sheep-pasture. The high price of wool and 
the low price of all kinds of grain will probably induce many of 
the farmers to sow out their upper grounds, and lay them down in 
grass. The importation of grain from Ireland has tended of late 
years to keep down the Peebles grain-market. Formerly, very 
considerable quantities were sent from this county to the Upper 
Ward of Lanarkshire, whereas that district is now supplied from 
Ireland. To counterbalance this depreciation of one kind of pro- 
duce, steam navigation promises to keep up the price of lambs and 
fat sheep, which find a better market in London than in Edinburgh 
or Glasgow. The houses of almost all the farmers whose rental 
exceeds L. 50 are substantial buildings, affording comfortable resi- 
dences for their families. The farmers are an intelligent, respect- 
able class of men ; sober in their habits and industrious in their cal- 
ling. A bankruptcy among them is of very rare occurrence, and 
when it does take place it may be ascribed to some untoward cir- 
cumstances over which the bankrupt had probably very little control. 

Population. — From the annexed table it will be seen that be- 
tween the years 1801 and 1811, there was an increase of popula- 
tion of 15 per cent, and this is easily explained. The scarcity of 
1799 and 1800 made the farmers bring more land into tillage than 
had been under the plough before; more men were employed, and 
as high wages were given, they were enabled to marry and bring up 
families. This impulse ceased during the next ten years, and hence 
there was an increase of only one per cent. The increase of five 
per cent, in the last ten years was owing to the influx of strangers 
to make some new lines of roads. 

From several of the preceding accounts it appears that there 
has been a considerable falling off in the population of certain pa- 
rishes, and a general impression prevails that the county is not 
nearly so populous as it was some centuries ago. By writers on 
political economy the plausible question is asked, how was this al- 
leged population supported, when agriculture was so imperfectly 
understood and practised One very important consideration seems 
to have been forgotten when they maintain, that the population 
bears a proportion to the produce of the land, and it is this,— in 

gress has been made in widening the bridge across the Tweed 

feet to 22 feet. According to contract, the work will be completed in October next, 
at the expense of upwards of L. 1000. 



ON THE COUNTY OF PEEBLES.

former times the produce was consumed on the land, now the greater 
part is exported. Tweeddale at present contains about 102,000 
sheep, a very small number of which is consumed in the county or 
even in Scotland ; almost the whole of the annual produce, such as 
Jambs, cast ewes and wethers being sent to the south of England : 
whereas formerly neither sheep nor cattle ever crossed the English 
border, unless when a few were lifted in a marauding foray. 

It has been said, " we have nothing of the pastorico-poetical 
mania, which would lead to the erection of cottages for idlers, for 
whose labour there is no demand, for the mere pleasure of excit- 
ing poetic ideas."  It were much to be wished that this mania 
prevailed a little, not for the sake of poetry, but of humanity. Cot- 
tages, on the whole, are the nurseries of a sober industrious race of 
people ; and it is surely only reasonable and consistent with hu- 
manity that the labourer should be as near as possible to the 
scene of his daily toil, instead of being obliged to walk several 
miles before he can begin his day's work, and after bearing the 
toil and heat of the day to return the same distance in the even- 
ing. The hardship is still greater, if he be obliged to go to a re- 
mote part of the county, when he must leave his wife and family 
in some confined lane in the Burgh town, and, carrying his week's 
provision with him, must take such accommodation as he can find. 
The bad effects of this cruel system of not affording the day la- 
bourer a cottage in the parish where he earns his subsistence, is se- 
verely felt in the county town, in which, as his domicile, he claims 
his parish settlement. 

Peculiarities of the People. — The inhabitants of this county are 
not distinguished from their neighbours by any peculiarity, if we 
except their almost total want of a taste for music. A stranger 
would be inclined to suppose that a pastoral district must be the 
land of music and song, and yet this is not the case. • Pennecuik 
says " musick is so great a stranger to their temper that you shall 
hardly light upon one amongst six that can distinguish one tune 
from another;" and the editor of Pennecuik, who wrote a hundred 
years afterwards, says « in confirmation of this general want, it 
has been remarked, that from a band of Tweeddale shearers a 
song is scarcely ever to be heard ; that a ploughman seldom en- 
livens his horses by whistling a tune; and that, although the scenery 
is so purely pastoral, the sound of a pipe, or flute, or cow-horn, or 
stock in horn, or even of a Jew's harp, is a rare occurrence in tra- 
velling through it."

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 



Character of the People.— Pennecuik has also said when speak- 
ing of the inhabitants, " pity it is to see a clear complexion and 
lovely countenance appear with so much disadvantage through 
the foul disguise of smoke and dirt." So far from this being the 
case now, they are distinguished by neatness and cleanliness 
both in their houses and persons. They may also be considered 
a well-fed and well-clad people. They have not, indeed, the high 
wages which in a prosperous state of commerce are earned in ma- 
nufactures, but we nowhere see the squalid wretchedness and ab- 
ject poverty which are found in manufacturing districts. With 
the exception of a few individuals in the burgh, and in perhaps one 
of the villages, no man would appear in public on the Sabbath in 
his every-day clothes. Throughout the whole county there is a 
very becoming regard to decency in dress on solemn occasions ; 
some may call it extravagance, but no one who has carefully stu- 
died the character of the working-classes, and can feel an interest 
in their respectability and outward deportment, will ever censure 
this part of their expenditure. It will generally be found that the 
best clad, particularly among the young men, are the most sober 
and industrious, and least given to extravagance in any shape. I 
make these observations with the greater confidence, as my own 
parish contains considerably more than the fourth part of the po- 
pulation of the whole county ; and when I see men who are earn- 
ing their subsistence by the labour of six days of the week appear- 
ing on the seventh clad in good broad cloth, so far from blaming 
them I consider them entitled to commendation. 

But there are higher qualities to which most of my brethren 
have borne testimony. The people may be considered a religious 
people, who are regular in attending Divine ordinances, and, with 
some exceptions, act up to their profession. Liberalism and in- 
fidelity have as yet made very little progress among us, and il se- 
ditious emissaries from other places do not come to poison the 
minds, and sap the better principles of the people, every one who 
wishes their happiness both in this world and the world to come, 
will rejoice to see them continue in the same course of life which 
they now lead. 

Since the last Statistical Account was drawn up, the inhabitants, 
like their fellow countrymen, have shared in the prosperity and m 
the reverses of the country; have rejoiced in the former, and been 
submissive and resigned in the latter. To suggest any improve 
ments by which they would be greatly benefited, I should consider

presumptuous; as an intelligent race of people, who fully under- 
stand their own interests, they might say laissez nous fair -e, when 
any wild and visionary schemes are proposed to innovate on their 
accustomed occupations and their peaceful habits. 

The writer of these observations has drawn up the following 
tables, which contain chiefly a summary of the foregoing accounts, 
and holds himself responsible for their accuracy, — premising, 1st, 
That where Scots acres are given in the text, they have here been 
converted into imperial. 2d, That in stating the amount of raw 
produce, when the quantity of any article has been given, but not 
the value in money, a calculation has been made according to the 
market prices. 3c, That such particulars stated in the tables as 
are not found in text have been ascertained from the writers of the 
respective Accounts.

 A mistake has been made at p. 15. The sheep in the account of the parish of 
Peebles are all of the Cheviot breed, and not partly of the black-faced kind, as I there 
stated. The following should have been the return : 
357 stone of smeared white-faced wool, at 22s. per stone, L. 392 0 0 
6874 stone of unsmeared do. at 32s. per stone, - 1100 0 0 

L. 1492 0 0 

As the annual value of sheep and wool is given, the grazing, amounting to L. 2000, 
ought not to have been inserted. It is now deducted from the amount of raw pro- 
duce in the above column. 

f In this sum, L. 2400, are given as Che pi ice of wool, but there is no return for 
sheep or lambs sold. The number of sheep in Tweedsmuir is nearly he same as in 
Innerleithen j and the amount of the raw produce for them in that parish is L. 021.3. 

£ This number is not given iii the text ; but, as two acres are there allowed for one 
sheep, the above may be considered as the number of uncultivated acres. The same 
applies to Manner.

A fuller detail might have been given of the commitments to 
prison, but on referring to the gaoler's book, I found so much uni- 
formity, that a return for two years appeared quite sufficient. The 
commitments of vagrants for one night have been omitted, as they 
are frequently lodged in prison rather from humanity than from 
any desire to punish them. The more aggravated crimes are little 
known, and there has been only one execution for very many years, 
and I am not aware that the criminal was a native of Tweeddale. 
To the credit of the inhabitants of the four pastoral and agricul- 
tural counties of Peebles, Selkirk, Berwick, and Roxburgh, which 
form the southern circuit, it may be stated that no circuit furnishes 
a smaller criminal calendar. N

 These are the emoluments only of the teacher of the English school ; the grammar school- 
master's are not here noticed. 

•J- These two numbers include occasional as well as regular paupers. 
+ No returns. 

B. — Under the head of parochial expenditure is included not 
only the support of the poor, hut also the salaries of the session, pres- 
bytery, and synod clerks,— the beadle, and frequently the precentor. 
When the expenditure seems to exceed the annual income, it may be 
necessary to mention that the deficiency is made up, as in the parishes 
of Stobo, Kirkurd, and some others, by the liberality of the principal 
heritors, though no formal record is entered. In the parish of Man- 
ner, the deficiency is made up by drawing from the kirk-session funds 
lodged in the bank,— a very questionable mode of supporting the poor.

PRESBYTERY OF SELKIRK, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TEVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. JOHN CAMPBELL, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, Sfc. — The name Selkirk, according to Sir 
James Dalrymple, is derived from two Celtic words, schelch and grech, 
signifying the kirk in the wood or forest. This derivation receives 
considerable support from the fact, that this part of the country 
was formerly covered with wood, and formed a royal chase ; and it 
has been adopted in the former Statistical Account Of this pa- 
rish. It is elsewhere asserted that the name is written in old char- 
ters Seleschirche,  Selechyre, or Selchire, meaning the great or good 
church. 

From the great irregularities, and the capricious windings of its 
boundaries, in which no regard is paid to the natural features of 
the country, it is impossible to convey in words any idea of the 
figure of this parish. It is not even all contiguous, for there are 
two portions of it in the shire of Roxburgh, — the one on the north, 
and the other on the south, of the neighbouring parish of Ashkirk. 
The exent of the principal division, from Cadonlee on the north, 
to the source of Wollburn on the south, is about seven miles and 
a-half ; and from Easter Kershope on the west, to Whitmoor Loch 
on the east, about eight miles. Including the two detached parts, 
and deducting considerably for numerous indentations, the area may 
be computed in round numbers to be about ten square miles. The 
principal division is bounded on the north by the parishes of Gala- 
shiels and Stow, or rather by the river Tweed, which separates it 
from them ; on the south, by those of Yarrow and Ashkirk ; on the 
east, by those of Galashiels, Lilliesleaf, and Ashkirk ; and on the 
west, by that of Yarrow.

Topographical appearance, Climate, 8fc. — The parish is com- 
pletely of a hilly character ; but, from being all very elevated, the 
different peaks have not that marked appearance they otherwise 
would have. The most remarkable lie between the Ettrick and 
Tweed. Of these the Three Brethren Cairn is 1978 feet, and 
the Peat Law 1964, above the level of the sea. The mean tem- 
perature of the atmosphere, as given in the former account, is 43° 
of Fahrenheit ; the medium height of the barometer 29 T 2 5 ; and 
the mean quantity of rain 31 ij inches. The rivers are the Ettrick, 
Yarrow, and Tweed. Their course through the parish is east- 
ward. They are of the most romantic character, and their banks 
beautifully wooded. 

Selkirk parish presents few features worthy the attention of the 
geologist. The rocks belong to the transition series, and are chief- 
ly greywacke, greywacke-slate, clay-slate, &amp;c. which are disposed 
in strata in general pretty highly inclined, and ranging from N. W. 
to N. E. None of the more rare or useful minerals are to be 
met with.  The soil is light and dry, and in consequence the 
crops are early. The whole parish, and all the surrounding- 
district, as already noticed, was in early times one vast forest, of 
which the only traces now left are a few bare and stunted trees, 
overhanging the Ettrick and Yarrow; and for a long time there was 
scarcely the semblance of a wood to be met with. But of late, proprie- 
tors more alive to their true interests, have manifested considerable 
care in planting those parts of their estates unfit for pasture or agri- 
culture ; and there are now, particularly about the Haining and 
Bowhill, large forests, which in a few years must prove very pro- 
ductive, and even at present furnish a quantity of annual thinnings. 
The trees best adapted to the soil seem to be the common pine, 
birch, and oak. There is no natural wood ; but it is affirmed, 
that, were the hills left to the free and unfettered operations of 
nature, forests of spontaneous growth would immediately spring 
up and cover the face of the country. 

II. — Civil History. 
Historical Events— The parish, from its contiguity to the borders 
of the kingdom, was frequently the scene of predatory incursions, and 
its inhabitants furnished their quota in many of the most celebrated 
wars of the Scottish kings. So early as the twelfth century, we find

it mentioned in history; for King David the First founded, close to 
the present town, a monastery, which was shortly after removed to 
Kelso, — a spot more congenial to the habits and dispositions of the 
inmates of such an establishment. In 1309, Edward the Second of 
England mentions its castle as one of the strongholds of Scotland 
in the possession of his adherents. But the event dwelt on with 
the greatest complacency by the people of Selkirk is the battle 
of Flodden- Field. To this fatal encounter, James the Fourth 
was accompanied by a hundred of the choicest citizens of Selkirk ; 
and such was their courage and resolution, that out of that num- 
ber not more than four or five returned ; and these bore with them 
a flag said to have been taken from the English, which is still in 
existence, and in possession of the Incorporation of Weavers, by 
one of whose body it had been carried away. In revenge for their 
gallant conduct, the English burnt the town to the ground; but to 
compensate for that loss, a grant of 1000 acres of adjoining lands 
was made by the Crown to the burghers and their posterity for ever. 
After this we meet with nothing of much historical importance until 
the period of the great civil wars, during which the Marquis of 
Montrose was defeated by the Covenanters under General Leslie, 
at Philiphaugh, a farm about a mile to the north of the town. 

Antiquities. — Two miles to the west of the farm above-named, 
and overhanging the Yarrow, immediately before its junction with 
the Ettrick, are still to be seen the remains of an entrenchment 
thrown up by Montrose ; and in the town stands the house' where 
he spent the night previous to the engagement. Close to Newark, 
on the Yarrow, is a. field called the Slain Man's Lee, where the 
Covenanters, a day or two after, are said to have put to death many 
of their prisoners. Some bones are yet occasionally dug up on 
the spot. Since that period, Selkirk has been undistinguished by 
any occurrences claiming to be remembered in a compilation like the 
present. The ruins of only two castles, those of Newark and Oak- 
wood, now exist. The former of these, which belongs to the Duke of 
Buccleuch, was once the residence of Anne, Duchess of Buccleuch 
and Monmouth, after the death of her husband, who was behead- 
ed for insurrection in the reign of James the Second ; and it is sup- 
posed to be the scene where the Lay of the Last Minstrel was 
sung. Oakwood is in possession of the Scotts of Harden, and was

famous of old as being tenanted by the wizard Michael Scott, 
many traditions of whom are here still current. 

Some coins, apparently Roman, were found three or four years 
ago, but from their decay it was impossible to make out their date 
or inscription ; and it is noticed in the former report that some 
skulls of the Urus, or wild ox, and a Roman spear, were dug up 
in a moss near Selkirk. 

Eminent Men. — The chief characters of eminence connected with 
this parish have been, 1st, Andrew Pringle, Lord Alemoor, a Lord of 
Session during the last century, equally remarkable for his learning 
and eloquence. 2d, Mungo Park, the African traveller, born at 
Fowlshiels, where one of his brothers still resides. And lastly, 
the great Sir Walter Scott, Baronet, who was long Sheriff of the 
County. 

The chief Landholders are the Duke of Buccleuch ; Robert 
Pringle of Clifton ; Charles Scott of Sunderlandhall ; Hugh Scott 
of Harden ; Alexander Pringle of Whytbank ; John Boyd of 
Broadmeadows ; John Dunlop of Whitmoorhall ; Maconochie of 
Greenhead ; and the town of Selkirk. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers, namely, those of 
births and marriages, are kept with great regularity by the session- 
clerk. They consist of several folio volumes, the earliest date of 
which is 1641. Unluckily, however, the register of births is not 
so complete as could be wished, from the circumstance that people 
belonging to the Secession church, who are here pretty nume- 
rous, have a seeming reluctance to enter the births of their chil- 
dren, and, consequently, the enrolments are mostly made by pa- 
rents in union with the establishment. It may be here noticed, 
that there is also a register of deaths, not kept by the session-clerk, 
but by an individual merely for his own amusement. It commences 
in 1742, and has been continued down to the present time. 

Modem Buildings. — There is one church belonging to the Esta- 
blishment, and one Secession meeting-house. At one time there 
were two Secession meeting-houses, but when the dissenting synods 
united, one was found tobe sufficient, and the other has been convert- 
ed into a dwelling-house. There is also a town hall, with an elegant 
spire 110 feet in height; and close to the town there have just been 
rebuilt very excellent mills for grinding wheat, barley, and other grain. 
An inkle manufactory, which existed many years, was discontinued, 
in consequence of the late great depression of trade. There are 
some stocking-looms, and a fulling mill, which employ only a very

few bands. A tannage, on a. small scale, stands about a mile east 
of the town. The principal mansion-houses are those of Hain- 
ing, Bowhill, Sunderlandhall, and Broadmeadows. 

III. — Population. 

The number of inhabitants in the early part of last century, 1700 

In 1755, according to Dr Webster, . . . 1793 

In 1811, ....... 2422 

In 1821, . . . . . . , 2696 

In 1831, ..... 2833 

The number of families is 637 ; of individuals employed in agri- 
culture as occupiers or labourers, 186 ; in trade, manufactures, and 
handicraft, 280 ; of professional and other educated men, 50 ; of 
labourers not employed in agriculture, 77. 

The increase of the population has been owing in the country 
mostly to the improved state of agriculture, and in the town to the 
few manufactories, — the opening of roads, and the greater quantity 
of employment afforded by the landed proprietors. In the burgh, 
the increase might have been yet greater, had not the restrictions on 
trade, and jealousy of the burghers, forced many young men with 
small capitals to places more open to enterprise. In 1755, three- 
fifths of the population resided in the town, and the remainder in 
the country. In the town the population at present is 1800, in the 
country 1033. The number of deaths for the last seven years is 
51 ; of marriages for the same time, 22. 

The number of proprietors of land in the parish of the yearly 
value of L. 50 and upwards is 15. 

Habits and Character of the People. — The habits of the people 
are cleanly, their houses comfortable, and kept in good order ; while 
their dress, without manifesting any peculiarity, is much attended 
to. Strangers invariably remark the neat and decent appearance 
of the lower orders on Sundays. Their food is good and whole- 
some, the bread in the country being mostly made of pease or bar- 
ley, and in the town from wheat ; and there are few families that 
have not butcher-meat almost every day to dinner : potatoes are in con- 
stant use. They are much addicted to the smokingof tobacco. They 
are, for the most part, well-informed, disposed to religion, sober, and 
respectful. Drinking of spirituous liquors, which was of late years 
very common, has in a considerable degree declined, — and the on- 
ly crime prevalent is that of poaching, which is carried on in game 
to a great extent, and is but too often the forerunner of offences of 
a deeper dye. Numbers of idle young men band themselves toge-

ther, and with the utmost audacity set defiance to keepers. It 
were a benefit to society could some scheme be found efficacious 
enough to put an end to their depredations, as the present game 
laws oppose but a feeble check.

is L. 296. 

Rate of Wages. — For male farm-servants in winter, L. 4 ; for 
do. in summer, L. 6; for female farm-servants in winter, L.2; for

out the year, 12s. per week. 

Breeds of Live Stock, Farm-Buildings, Sfc— The sheep are of 
the white-faced breed, and have lately been much improved by the 
attention now bestowed on them by farmers. Formerly, the ewes 
were milked for making cheese, but this is nearly done away with, 
they being found more productive when they only suckle their 
lambs. The farm-buildings are good, with . handsome dwelling- 
houses and offices in excellent repair, and the fields are well en- 
closed either with stone walls or hedges. 

Produce. — The gross yearly amount and value of raw produce rais- 
ed in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, are as follows : — 

800 acres of oats, at 30 bushels per acre, at 2s. 9d. per bushel, L. 3300 0 0 

267 barley, at 24 bushels per acre, at 3s. 9d. per bushel, 120110 0

2300 for sheep pasture, &amp;c. at 5s. 6d. per acre, - - 632 10 0 

L. 10,081 15 0 

Few cattle are reared in the parish, and little of the land is used 
for natural or meadow-hay. The annual thinnings of wood, as yet 
scarce pay the wages of the people employed to cut it down.

A pastoral society was some years ago formed, chiefly through, 
the exertions of Lord Napier, for the improvement of the breed 
of sheep and cattle in the district, and, from the emulation excited 
amongst farmers, has been of the utmost benefit. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market. — Selkirk is itself a market-town, and the capital of the 
county. Formerly it was famed for the making of shoes, in which it 
drove an extensive trade; but this has gradually declined until it has 
fallen to a level with all others, — there being little encouragement 
given to trade or enterprise from the severe burgh restrictions in 
force. Little business is transacted on the market-day. The 
standard of bread is regulated by Haddington and Kelso. The an- 
nual revenue of the town of Selkirk is about L. 1000. 

Means of Communication. — The means of communication are 
excellent, and in no part of Scotland can better roads be found. 
This has been the result of improvements within the last twenty 
years. The mail-road from Edinburgh to Carlisle passes through 
the town, in which there is a post-office, and a regular delivery 
of letters twice a-day, except on Sundays, and then only once. 
There is a stage-coach also daily to and from Edinburgh. The 
mail-road at present runs along the north bank of the Ettrick, 
which it crosses about half a mile from the town ; but a new one 
is now making, which, leading round by Galashiels, will cross the 
Ettrick a little above its junction with the Tweed, and sweep along 
the south side of the river. There are four bridges in the parish, 
one over the Ettrick, and three others over the Yarrow, all in good 
repair. 

 Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situate in the town of 
Selkirk, rather inconveniently for the country part of the population, 
being within amile from the eastern, and between five or six from the 
other extremities of the parish, making it impossible for the peasantry 
to be so regular in attendance on public worship as they otherwise 
would be. It was built in 1748, and has since been repaired more 
than once. The last time of its being repaired was in 1829, when it 
was newly roofed and painted ; and, among other improvements, 
stoves were introduced, adding much to the comfort of the congrega- 
tion m winter. It is calculated to contain about 1200 persons. The 
manse is very good, and was erected in 1806. The extent of the 
glebe is seven acres, and its annual value L.21. The amount of 
the stipend is 19 chalders, or 221 quarters, 2 bushels, 3 pecks, \

SELKIRKSHIRE. 



gallon imperial, half meal, half barley; with an allowance of L. 10 
for sacramental purposes. The average amount of stipend for the 
last ten years, converted to money, is L.302, 2s. 2|d. per annum. 
The number of families attending the Established Church is 220. 
The average number of communicants 650. 

There is no other place of worship in the parish, except the Seces- 
sion meeting-house, which is in the town, and was built in 1759. Itbe- 
longs to the Associate Synod. The stipend, with an allowance in- 
cluded for the rent of a dwelling-house, sacramental expences, &amp;c. 
amounts to L. 150 per annum, and is raised solely from the seat 
rents. 670 sittings were let for the present year; and the number 
of families belonging to the congregation may be 335. From 15 
to 20 poor people are accommodated with seats gratis. 

There are two Societies in the parish connected with religion, — 
one Friendly, composed of females, and the other Missionary ; both 
including indiscriminately members of the Establishment and Seces- 
sion. They are poor. There is likewise a Temperance Society, 
not in a very flourishing condition. 

Education. — The total number of schools is seven ; one of which 
is parochial, one burgh, two others endowed, and three unendowed. 
There are also two Sunday evening schools, taught and superintend- 
ed by the clergymen of both persuasions. In the grammar or paro- 
chial school, are taught, besides the ordinary branches, Latin, 
Greek, French, Italian, astronomy, mathematics, and drawing. 
This school has always borne a high character, and is now under 
the charge of a most able and accomplished master. Three of the 
other schools are taught by females, and afford the usual branches 
of female education. The salary of the grammar schoolmaster, in- 
cluding an allowance for house and garden, is L. 50 per annum, and 
he may receive L. 80 per annum of fees. The salary of the burgh 
schoolmaster is L. 32. One of the females has, since 1813, received 
L. 30 per annum from the town of Selkirk ; and another at Newark 
L. 15, with house, coals, &amp;c. since 1810, from the Duke of Buccleuch. 
Education is very cheap. These schools seem fully adequate for the 
population, few of whom cannot read and write. As schools have in- 
creased, and particularly since the commencement of the Sunday 
schools, a great change for the better has taken place in the morals 
of the young. 

Libraries. — There are in the parish two very good subscription 
libraries, and one parochial. The books are of the best description, 
and much read. 



SELKIRK.

Savings Bank.— We have one savings bank, called " The Et- 
tiick Forest Savings Bank." The average amount invested in it 
for the last five years is L.240, 4s. per annum ; the average amount 
withdrawn, L.263. The greater amount of the sums withdrawn 
is to be attributed to the great number of persons emigrating to 
America, — these of course leaving nothing behind them. The 
amount invested, however,- for the present year, is greater by L.48 
than that withdrawn ; and the whole amount of the fund on hand 
at 5th August 1833 was L. 1673. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— Paupers are divided into two class- 
es, — those receiving aid from the town, and those from the parish. 
The number of poor on the parish is 15 ; and 2s. per week is the 
average allowance to each. The number on the town is 45. The 
average sum paid by the town for the last three years is L. 191, 
Is. 5d. which is raised by assessment. The church collections amount 
to L. 25 a-year. The Duke of Buccleuch gives annually L. 20 
to purchase coals ; and 200 merks were mortified many years ago 
by William Ogilvie of Hartwoodmyres, of which the kirk-session 
are the managers. 

Prisons. — In the prison of Selkirk,[during the last year, at diffe- 
rent periods, seven individuals have been confined. It is not well 
secured, as two prisoners have this season escaped; and others 
have been frequently in the practice of coming out in the evening, 
and returning again before the jailor's visit in the morning. But 
this is now in the course of being remedied. 

Fairs, Inns, fyc. — Five fairs are held during the year. One of 
these, on the 31st of July, was established thirteen years ago for 
the sale of lambs, but has not succeeded well. The rest are for 
the transaction of business of all sorts. There are fifteen inns. 
Happily, however, they have not been of late much encouraged. 

Fuel. — In the western parts of the parish the principal fuel is 
peats ; but in the town and around it, coals brought from the mines 
of Mid- Lothian are chiefly used. The average price per cwt. is 
about Is. or Is. Id. 

VI. — Miscellaneous Observations. 

Since the above pages were in the press, a reading-room has 
been opened in the town, in which a monthly magazine, three news- 
papers, and one of the cheap periodicals are received. It is sup- 
ported by subscription ; the regulations are good, and it is likely to 
prove of much service. The line of road between Selkirk and Gala- 



10

shiels was opened at Whitsunday last, and forms one of the most 
beautiful drives in the south of Scotland. The general appearance 
of the parish has been much improved since the early account render- 
ed of it; farms are better managed,— every acre of land, that can with 
profit be so treated, has been brought under cultivation,— stocks are 
more healthy and productive, and the comforts of farmers and 
tenants themselves have in like ratio increased. Education is more 
widely disseminated, and the people are in general more moral and 
industrious. At the same time, land-owners have been at pains to 
embellish their seats and enclosures, thereby assisting to beautify 
the general features of the country.

rRESBYTERY OF SELKIRK, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TEVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. NATHANIEL PATERSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, 8fc.—Gwala, in the ancient British, signifies 
" a full stream." The United Parish of Galashiels and Lindean, 
the former part in the county of Selkirk, and the latter in Roxburgh- 
shire, is of an irregular figure, the greatest length being nearly eight 
miles, and the average breadth three. It is beautified and rendered 
interesting by the well-wooded and classical streams of Tweed, Et- 
trick, and Gala, which severally unite, and form a large portion 
of its boundaries. The general aspect is hilly, with narrow and 
winding vales. The greatest height, that of Meigle, a hill over- 
looking the town, is i480 feet, and the lowest plain, situated at the 
junction of Tweed and Gala, is 280 feet above the level of the sea. 

Climate. — As to climate there is nothing remarkable, farther 
than may be inferred from the elevation. The hills are for the 
most part green and dry. Sheep-draining, .as the mode of drying 
hill pastures by open furrows cut with the spade is termed, has been 
introduced, and is practised as far as needed, but not to any considera- 
ble extent ; and it is rare that the storms of winter are such as to pre- 
vent the flocks from shifting for themselves. The easterly winds, 
owing to the obstruction of higher grounds, and the tortuous course 
of the vallies, lose much of their vicious humidity before reaching this 
place ; and the inhabitants are but seldom tried by that delicate 
test of rheumatism, an easterly haar. There has not been a case 
of ague in the parish for the last ten years ; and public worship 
has not once, in that time, been prevented by the severity of the 
weather. Many now living remember intermittent fever as a very 
common occurrence ; but they remember also that wild ducks were 
frequently shot in many pools and marshes of the neighbourhood 
where wheat and clover now thrive. No mountains of the district 



12 



SELKIRKSHIRE. 



are so high, nor are the elevated tracts so cold, from sponginess of 
surface, as to attract from the atmosphere more than an ordinary 
share of moisture. The harvest is early ; peaches and apricots 
ripen in the open air ; and, upon the whole, the climate may be 
judged as favourable to longevity as any in Scotland. 

Geology, Sfc. — Clay-slate, greywacke, and ironstone, are the 
principal rocks occurring in the parish; and no coal, lime, or 
freestone, has yet been found. Owing to the great distance 
from coal, viz. twenty-four miles, it is most desirable that that 
necessary mineral should make its appearance ; and search, if 
search could produce it, would not have failed. But alas  on the last 
attempt which I witnessed, it was found that a sort of shale, not bi- 
tuminous, had duped the sanguine excavators, one of whom on 
shewing the deceitful semblance said, " it is as black as a coal, as 
hard as a coal, and as heavy as a coal ; in short, it is coal altoge- 
ther, except that it will not burn." Shell-marl abounds in Lin- 
dean on the south side of Tweed ; and, what is very remarkable, 
there is no vestige of that manure to be found on the north side, 
over a large tract of country. It has been extensively used, to the 
great benefit of agriculture and of pasture lands, but now it is rarely 
driven farther than four or five miles ; lime, though twenty miles 
distant, being preferred since the public roads became so highly 
improved. 

The soil is of all characters, from the black mould to the ochrey 
clay. It is sandy, but fertile on the banks of the rivers. The 
rising grounds to the south of the Tweed have a considerable mix- 
ture of clay on a tilly bottom ; those to the north are dry and 
gravelly, with an everlasting profusion of small stones. The black 
mould is scarce, being found only on small fields of table-land out 
of the reach of the rivers, and enriched at the expense of the slop- 
ing hills. Peat-moss is nowhere to be met with, except in small 
spots where water has been long stagnant; and its use for fuel, 
notwithstanding the great distance of coal, is almost entirely aban- 
doned. 

Hydrography. — As the rivers flow with considerable rapidity, 

and are rarely confined by rocky banks, much trouble and expense are 

occasioned by floods. The Tweed maybe seen a quarter of a mile in 

breadth, rolling its mighty sea, which mountains seem inadequate to 

oppose ; and the Gala less powerful, but more mischievous, would 

spare, if it were not carefully checked, neither corn-fields nor stone 

walls. The best remedy in use is a species of bulwark called puts.

GALASHIELS. 



13 



These are masses of stones loosely piled in the interior, but finished 
on the surface after the manner of a pavement, and shaped like the 
fore half of a shoemaker's last, pointing up the stream, and form- 
ino- with the bank an angle of 45°. This occasions a lodgement 
of gravel giving strength to the work, and thus obliges the river, 
in its wildest mood, to furnish protection to the land. The main 
thing is to guard the base with piles well driven, for if one stone 
be suffered to give way, the whole scheme is futile. 

About fifty years ago, the town of Galashiels was liable to such 
inundations, that boats were occasionally brought from Boldside, 
two miles distant, to rescue the people from their houses. But of 
late, the channel of the river has been found a convenient quarry 
for the great increase of buildings, and the course of the stream 
has in consequence been so much lowered, that there is now no 
apprehension of danger from its assaults upon the streets. Yet 
though personal safety be secured, property is subject to no small 
damage by the presence of floods. Bulwarks reared at great ex- 
pense are liable to be swept away ; and mills, necessarily placed 
near to the water's edge, are often in jeopardy from the erosion of 
the gravelly stratum on which they are built. As soon as the tor- 
rent has made a breach in the bulwark the danger is imminent, and 
all hands are at work. 

In the autumn of 1829 this place had its share in the terrors of 
the floods so destructive at the same period in Morayshire. A large 
new Factory was in peril ; and a multitude of hands were employed 
in collecting and piling up stones, as a barrier against the inroads 
of the water. But at every interval of a few minutes, large masses 
of the bank were falling down ; and the strong pile, losing its 
foundation, was but as chaff to the torrent — when a spectator of 
this toil and dismay suggested an expedient that was then, as it 
has since frequently been, successful, viz. that of cutting down 
trees, making them fast by the trunk with long ropes and stakes, 
and tumbling them with all their branches into the flood. The 
sight was grand : the scheme was novel : a hundred people might 
be employed in hauling along full-grown trees through the more 
quiescent waters to the main stream, being themselves half im- 
mersed in the element with which they were contending. The 
effect was immediate, and the progress of destruction was arrested. 
Spruce and Scotch firs of four to six inches in diameter are the 
most suitable. They are so arranged that the bushy part of one 
tree overlaps that of another, forming a sort of thatch, along which 



14 



SELKIRKSHIRE 



the water smoothly glides, and presses it against the bank ; and 
thus the loose gravel, instead of being hurried away, is upheld by 
the force of the stream. This expedient is now uniformly adopted 
as soon as any encroachment is threatened ; and by the employment 
of a few trees that may be worth sixpence a-piece, and the labour 
of a few minutes, highly improved fields and costly embankments 
have been saved from incalculable damage. . In this country of 
mountain and flood, circumstances must frequently, and in many 
places, be similar to those now described : and this will be deemed 
an apology for the above notice. 

There are two lakes in this parish ; one of which may be a mile 
and a-half in circumference, deep, full of marl, and well-stocked 
with perch and pike. It is ornamented on one side with plantations 
by Sir Walter Scott ; but on the other it is lamentably bare, con- 
sidering its high and exposed situation, as the name Cauldshiels 
implies. The other lake, covering about ten or twelve acres, was 
once partially drained in expectation of marl ; but as none was 
found, the drains have been suffered to close, and the marshy, reedy 
surface is again changed to a smooth sheet of water. It is peopled 
with eels, which always find their way into any pool, whether natu- 
ral or artificial. This lake is not worthy of notice, were it not for 
the beauty it is capable of affording, and the great price at which 
such an ornament must be bought where nature does not supply 
it. Though low in its situation, and surrounded with soil highly 
favourable to the growth of timber, it is yet without a tree for a 
companion. 

Zoology. — The rivers here abound in salmon, common trout some- 
times found in Tweed of the extraordinary weight of 12 lbs., 
whitling or sea-trout, bull-trout, a coarser variety of the salmon tribe. 
A stray pike may be met with in the deep pools ; eels everywhere ; 
minnow, — important to anglers ; and the par, of dubious origin, 
certainly never found except where salmon have access, is so 
abundant, that the least skilful anglers have seldom the mortifica- 
tion of coming home with an empty basket. 

The new act for regulating the period of close time in Tweed 
promises to be advantageous, as its principle is accommodated to 
the natural history of the salmon. The river was formerly open 
so early as the 10th of January, when the fishes were slaughtered 
in great numbers by spearing with torch light ; and when they 
were so little recovered from the effects of spawning, that the 
fishermen of this place, having killed a hundred in one night, 



GALASHIELS. 



15 



would have been glad to get, for the whole lot, the average price 
of one shilling a head ; — a prodigious waste of a valuable article 
of food. The river is not open now till the 15th of February, 
when the condition of the salmon is generally improved. It is 
not easy to say at what time the varieties of this tribe come into 
the rivers, or when they return to the sea. In no month of the 
year is the river Tweed without some of them. They do not leave 
the sea only for the purpose of spawning, but to get rid of an in- 
sect with which they become infested in salt water. This insect 
quits its hold in the course of two days' exposure to the fresh stream; 
and hence, as salmon are sometimes taken in this place with the 
insect adhering to them, their rate of travelling cannot be less than 
twenty miles per day, — a rapidity that is surprising, considering 
the force of the current with which they have all the way to con- 
tend ; for this journey can only be performed when there is a con- 
siderable flood in the river. 

Squirrels have appeared, but do not seem to have gained a 
residence ; which, for the sake of game and singing birds, is little 
desirable. The otter preys upon salmon and large trout in the rivers. 
The swan, the eagle, the raven, the starling, the butcher-bird, the 
ring dottrel, and Bohemian chatterer, are the more rare of the fea- 
thered tribe which occasionally make their appearance. It is worthy 
of remark that wood-pigeons, which have increased in number in pro- 
portion to the increase of plantation, prove destructive to the turnip 
crop; and that crows have lately learned to relieve the famine of win- 
ter by feeding on that root. The moor blackbird, too, has of late 
years become a most troublesome spoiler of the garden. It is 
nearly of the same size as the singing blackbird, but dingy and 
tuneless, — a daring thief that comes before the windows and 
carries off" a plum nearly as large as itself, shewing by its chatter 
more of anger than fear when it is disturbed in the work of depre- 
dation. Currants, gooseberries, cherries, plums, and the finest 
wall-fruits, are its prey. 

Finger-and-toe, a disease of the turnip root, and now spreading 
to an alarming degree, is in all probability to be ascribed to an in- 
sect ; but the subject, so far as I have learned, is not yet investi- 
gated. There is also a fly which preys upon the leaf of that crop 
to its great damage, but whose natural history has not yet been 
ascertained.  The carrot worm is so prevalent in this place that 

• The insect alluded to is a species of the genus IJallica, Stephens, — perhaps the //. 
nemorum. A writer in the Entomological Magazine for July, has related some experi- 



SELKIRKSHIRE. 



little success attends the cultivation of that excellent root. Neither 
trenching, nor lime, nor salt, nor soot, proves efficacious. The 
green fly is very destructive to peach trees; and mildew hurts 
the leaf of the Ribston, and that of several of the finer sorts of 
apples. 

Botany. — Woad  Isatis tinctoria J, used as a dye, and teazles, 
or clothier's brush  Dipsacusfullonum J, for raising the nap of cloth, 
have been cultivated here both in gardens and in the fields ; but 
little is done in that way, as the climate in ordinary seasons is un- 
favourable. The latter plant occupies the ground for two years ; 
and if it fails of abundant sunshine in autumn to harden and turn 
down the spiculse of the seed-pod, which gives it the property of a 
combing instrument, the crop is in a great measure lost. 

Almost all the varieties of fir and hard-wood thrive well. The 
soil is of various qualities ; and planting is now so well understood 
that there is scarcely an instance of failure. In every case of re- 
cent plantation there is a mixture of fir and hard-wood ; the latter 
consisting of ash, elm, oak, beech, sycamore, &amp;c. and as . thinning 
is regularly observed, the most thriving trees are left ; and this ex- 
perimental process proves infallible, as to the accommodation of 
trees to the soil. Want of depth is the cause why no very re- 
markable oaks appear ; there are many fine elms, but the ash and 
the plane attain to the largest size, and of both very superb speci- 
mens are to be seen in the finely wooded park of Gala, and also 
in the estate of Fairnilee. 

II. — Civil History. 

Accounts of the Parish, Sfc. — In Pennant's Tour, printed in 1772, 
are many curious and interesting particulars relative to the anti- 
quities and civil history of this parish. Surveys of all the estates, 
with plans and measurements, were taken from 1790 to 1800, and 
are now in the hands of the proprietors. 

Galashiels was erected into a barony in 1599, according to the 
precept from Chancery bearing that date, and must have been 

ments which he was induced to make for the purpose of ascertaining the source from 
whence this bane of the turnip crops arose, and his investigations led him to the conclu- 
sion, that the ova of the insect were deposited on the seed, and were att ached t o it when 
sown. This conclusion is in consonance with what is known of the unerring instinct of 
many tribes of insects, which leads them to deposit their ova where the young when 
hatched may find their appropriate food ; and in the instance of the turnip crops, the 
same temperature and situation which promotes the germination of the seed, also 
calls into life the parasitic destroyer of the plant — Vide Entomol. Mag. i. 364.

about that time a place of some note, as appears from the report 
by the Lords of Commission for the Plantation of Kirks, dated 
1622. The report bears, " that there lived above 400 people in 
Galashiels ; and so meikle the more as we the ministers of the 
adjoining- parishes find ane house already there, well built, comely 
apparelled, and with small help, as is provided, may easily be made 
sufficient for the whole people in their most frequent assemblages." 
The kirk was accordingly transplanted from Lindean to Gala- 
shiels for this farther reason, as given in the report, that the old 
vicar's church of Lindean had been abandoned for thirty-six years 
preceding. 

Land-owners. — The chief of these are, Jo. Scott, Esq. of Gala; 
Robert Pringle, Esq. of Clifton, proprietor of Fairnilee, in this pa- 
rish ; Miss Plummer of Middlestead, liferenter of Lindean, which 
belongs to this parish ; and Nicol Milne, Esq. of Faldonside. 

Parochial Registers. — That of births from 1672 to 1690 is ex- 
tant. But from this latter date till 1714, there is a blank in all the 
parish records. From 1714 till the present time, the register of 
births has been kept regularly ; but none of burials or marriages 
has been kept since 1776, before which time, during a period of 
thirty years, these were recorded but imperfectly. 

Antiquities. — Traces of two ancient camps, one on the pro- 
perty of Nicol Milne, Esq. the other at Rink, on the estate of 
Fairnilee, and also of a considerable portion of Roman road, are 
distinctly visible. 

Modern Buildings. — These are, Gala House, embowered among 
fine old trees, and the house of Nicol Milne, Esq. of Faldon- 
side. There are also ten large machinery houses, or cloth fac- 
tories, of various standing ; — one recently rebuilt, and one entire- 
ly new. The greatest improvement in buildings is to be found 

 Perhaps the most ancient notice of the town of Galashiels is to be found in Lord 
Hailes' Annals, where it is mentioned that the Scots, after the battle of Crichton- 
dean Krkhtown in the reign of David II. 1337, quartered at Galashiels, and that 
the English crossed the Tweed near to this place ; and the statement is confirmed by 
tradition. At the distance of a mile from the town, on the way to the most likely 
place for crossing the Tweed, near to Abbotsford, was a marsh, now cultivated, and 
long known as the spot where some of the English fell in a skirmish, and which still 
goes by the name of the Englishmen's Syke ; here also were dug up certain imple- 
ments of war in the process of draining the ground. And tradition farther says, that 
the English were taken by surprise in the act of gathering the wild plums with which 
the environs of the town, till of late years, greatly abounded. Hence the proverbial 
expression « sour plums," as they proved to the English, and which was adopted as 
the sarcastic and triumphant motto to the arms of the baronial burgh.

in two new bridges, — one crossing the Tweed, and the other the 
Ettrick, on the road from Galashiels to Selkirk. The distance 
from Galashiels to Selkirk is thus reduced from eight and a-half 
' miles to six : and this saving of the distance will be attended with 
the saving of men's lives, as many travellers from time to time 
perished in fording the waters ; and the dreadful loss of life, a 
century ago, by the sinking of the ferry-boat overladen with pas- 
sengers, on occasion of a Selkirk fair, is yet so well remembered 
as to enhance the value of the bridges. Amongst the modern 
improvements in this parish, ought to be noticed a chain or sus- 
pension bridge, which was the first bridge of that kind erected in 
Britain ; and also a wooden bridge, so far as I know, of original 
construction, having the suspension principle, by which width of 
span is made compatible with lightness and firmness. This last 
erection appears to be an ingenious and successful piece of work- 
manship, the timbers being all so arranged as to act by their ab- 
solute, and not relative strength. Both of these bridges are de- 
signed for foot-passengers only, and are of great convenience, being 
within the precincts of the town, and serving to unite those parts 
which are disjoined by the Gala.

The number of persons residing in the town of Galashiels is 
1 130 ; in the country, 404. The number of families in the parish, 
301. 

The number of persons employed in agriculture as occupiers or 
labourers is 86 ; in manufactures, retail trade, or handicraft, 223 ; 
of professional and other educated men, 14 ; of labourers not agri- 
cultural, 28. ' There are only five proprietors of land amounting 
to more than L. 50 of yearly value. 

Some explanation is requisite upon the fact, that while there 
has been a large increase of the manufactures of this place, the 
number of individuals in the parish has of late years continued 
nearly the same as before. The town of Galashiels contains in 
whole 2209 inhabitants; but of these 1079 belong to the parish 
of Melrose : And it is in the Melrose part of the town that the 
increase of population has kept pace with the progress of manu- 



GALASHIELS.

factures. In that district, on account of its proximity to the river, 
and to the machinery houses situated on its banks, the number of 
inhabitants has risen, within the last ten years, from 651 to 1079; 
and in both districts it is worthy of remark, that the houses are 
generally new, being all built or rebuilt, with the exception of not 
more than two or three, within the remembrance of many of the 
older inhabitants. 

The language of the labouring classes is the native Scottish, 
with a good deal of the accent peculiar to the border districts. But 
it is gradually improving, from the intercourse of the manufacturers 
with other places.

There are no considerable plantations without a proper mixture 
of hard-wood, consisting of oak, ash, elm, beech, sycamore, &amp;c. 
and the management is regularly attended to, and every where well 
understood, except that branches are allowed to get too thick be- 
fore they are, amputated. No destruction is suffered from the crowd- 
ing of trees, and nothing of that barbarous practice, common in some 
districts, is to be seen, viz. the lopping off of all the branches save 
one, with the vain intention of giving magnificence to the bole. 

The rent of arable land runs from L.3 to 10s., and the average 
is about L. 1 per acre. The rent of grazing on the average, and 
for the whole year, is, for an ox or cow, L. 5, for sheep full grown, 
6s. 6d. a-head. 

Rate of Labour. — The rate of labour, summer and winter, is, 

 Among the usual games of the country, that of curling has lately afforded con- 
siderable amusement as a summer exercise, being practised with wooden blocks, 
shaped like a curling stone, on a rink of the ordinary length made of deal, smoothed, 
and rendered slippery with soap. To diminish the friction, the block is made to 
slide, not on its entire base, but on three nobs, equidistant, projecting a few lines, 
and well rounded. Judging by the hard hits, the glee of the players, with their 
vociferations of censure or applause, as remarkable in this as in winter curling, it 
would seem that the artificial method is nowise inferior, except in the fitness of 
scenery, and the effect of wonted associations. The inventor, for such I believe he 
may be termed, is a Mr Kemp, an ingenious mechanic of this place, and the con- 
triver of the wooden bridge formerly noticed.

Breeds of Cattle. — As to the breed of cattle, the Tees-water 
is almost the only one that is encouraged. The sheep are the 
Cheviot and Leicester, and half-bred. There are none of the 
black-faced in the parish, except a few on some lawns, where they 
are kept, owing to a fancy that the mutton is higher flavoured. 
From the effect of annual competition in the district, every attention 
is paid to the improvement of the breeds. 

Husbandry and Produce. — The five-shift husbandry is generally 
observed ; but near the town, where the rents are high and manure 
can be bought, the four-shift has been too long practised. Hence the 
disease called finger-and-toe gets worse in the turnip crops, and red 
clover proves often an utter failure. On clay lands wheat is sow r n after 
fallow ; and on dry lands frequently with success after potatoes ; or it 
is sown in spring after turnips eaten off with sheep. Pease, being found 
a bad substitute for those green crops which require manure and ad- 
mit of cleaning, are now little cultivated. Bone dust, as yet but par- 
tially introduced, is found to raise excellent turnips, and promises 
to be of great service, by eking out the resources of the farm, so as 
to afford annually, to one-fifth of the ploughed land, an effectual 
manure ; and hence the poor and lazy pea-crop may be altogether 
abandoned. The land is in general well-drained : stones are 
plentiful, and the cuts are three feet, filled nearly to the top. 
Though there is little to do in the reclaiming of waste lands, a con-, 
tinual expense is incurred in securing, by puts and embankments, 
what is already in the highest state of culture, along the many and 
furious-running streams already named. Leases of nineteen years 
have generally prevailed ; but of late, some farms, where no great 
improvements are required, have been let for eight or twelve years. 
The farm-buildings are all respectable, — the fields are generally 
well-enclosed with hedges, dry-stone dikes, which are not approved 
of, being as much as possible avoided, — and it cannot be said that 
any obstruction to agricultural improvement arises either from the 
want of encouragement on the part of the landlords, or from want 
of capital and skill on the part of the tenants. 

The average gross amount and value of raw produce raised year- 
ly in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows :

Manufactures. — The several branches of these are woollen 
cloth, stockings and stocking-yarn, white and shoe-leather, and the 
various articles of machinery used in the woollen factories. But 
that which chiefly claims notice is the woollen manufacture ; and, 
in giving a view of this, it will be quite impossible to limit the ob- 
servations to what is strictly parochial, as the line of separation be- 
tween the Melrose and Galashiels parts of the town being once, 
no doubt, the channel of the river, is now so obliterated, that part 
of a house is in one parish, and part in another ; and the factory 
also may be on one side, and the dwelling-houses of the workers on 
the other side, of the ideal boundary. 

The annual consumption of wool amounts to 21,500 stones at 
24 lbs. imperial to the stone, of which 21,000 are home-grown, 
and 500 are foreign, chiefly from Van Diemen's Land. From one- 
half to two-thirds of the home-grown wool is smeared, which, 
if not done with too much tar, is not found objectionable for the 
manufacture of cloth. Nearly a half of the raw material is manu- 
factured into yarns, flannels, blankets, shawls, and plaids ; the 
other half, or nearly, is used for narrow cloths, which bring in the 
market from 20d. to 6s. 6d. per yard ; together with crumb-cloth 
or carpeting, of grey or mixed colours. By the use of foreign wool, 
the flannels of this place have risen to a degree of fineness surpas- 
sing, it has been said by the Board of Trustees, any made in Scot- 
land, if not even the finest of the Welsh manufacture. Blankets, 
partly of the Scotch, and partly of the English mode of manufac- 
ture, are extensively produced from the white or unlaid w ool of this 
country ; and blanket-shawls of many colours, and so full of com- 
forl as to make a had day desirable, have of late been in great de- 
mand : and the gleam of fashion, like a May sun, has given a new 
stir to the working bees of this town. The shawls are accommo-

dated to all dimensions of person or of purse, being from 3s. to 
30s. a-piece. A new manufacture called Indiana for ladies' gowns, 
price 8s. or 9s. a yard, lias lately been tried ; but time is wanting 
to prove its success. There can be no want of success from ina- 
bility to spin a fine thread, as I have seen a specimen of vara so 
delicately drawn, that the eye would doubt whether the substance 
were still in the state of carded wool ; and being told the less in- 
telligible amount of spindles and slips, I thought it more convenient 
to reduce the quantities to lineal measure ; the result of which 
was, that a pound of wool yielded a thread of more than thirty- 
seven miles in length. Attempts have not been wanting to pro- 
duce broad cloths of the finest quality ; but these have hitherto 
been but scantily supplied. The structure of the machinery, and 
the education of the operatives, must undergo a gradual change 
before the finer cloths can become the staple commodity of this 
place ; but neither is there ground for the apprehension that the 
industrious may want employment, should the consumer want a 
more costly apparel, there being here no want of enterprise, or of 
success in the adaptation of machinery to the production of such 
articles as suit the wants or the taste of the public. 

The progress which this branch of manufacture has made, and 
is still making, may be known by comparing the quantities of raw 
material consumed at different periods. According to the former 
Statistical Account, there were used in the year 1774 only 722 stones 
of wool by the clothiers, and scarcely as much more, it is added, 
could be manufactured by private persons; while in the year 1790, 
243 packs of wool each pack containing 12 st. of 24 lb. English 
were purchased by the manufacturers ; besides which, they received 
from different quarters wool, yarn, and weaved cloth, to a consider- 
able amount, to be dyed and dressed for private use or for sale. 
Thus, in 1790, the quantity used by the clothiers was 2916 stones ; 
whereas the consumption during the current year 1832, as above 
stated, amounts to 21,500. At the time of the former Statistical 
Account, 241 women were constantly employed in spinning wool ; 
there were besides occasional spinsters ; and three machines, hav- 
ing each thirty or thirty-six spindles, were employed two or three 
days in the week. At present there are no females engaged m 
spinning wool, and no such thing as a human hand occupied in 
drawing only a single thread. Some of the machines spin up- 
wards of 200 threads at once ; the total spindles are 5336, of 
which 4352 are driven by water, and the remaining 984 by the

hand. In the former statement the looms were 43, now they amount 
to 132 ; but considering the number that are not employed in 
blanketing, or other cloth of greater breadth than that woven at 
the former period, the looms now in use are equal to 187 of the 
old. 

The following is an average list of the operatives now employed ;

branch of manufacture, which owes so much to that cause already, 
will be farther extended. The Honourable Board of Trustees, 
by offering annual premiums for the best cloths at a given price, 
and by encouraging the judicious outlay of capital on the enlarge- 
ment and improvement of machinery, contribute greatly to that 
extension. 

It may be remarked, that children earning 3s. a-week, instead of 
proving a burden, are a help to their parents ; and that in general, 
though employed at the early age of from eight to fourteen years, 
their education is not neglected. It is the practice of parents, 
whilst some of their children are employed in the machinery houses, 
to have others at school ; and so to arrange, that periods of labour 
alternate with those of learning ; and thus, as funds are provided 
by the children themselves, they are much better educated than 
those of many other places where the poor have fewer resources. 
By the habits of industry, too, which they early acquire, they are 
much more qualified for future service, or the duties of active life, 
than such as spend their early years in idleness. It is evident 
from their appearance that they enjoy excellent health, and that 
they are happy at their light though constant work. There can 
be no training of the volatile minds of youth equal to that which 
is maintained at the factories : and it may be observed, that the 
profits arising from a water-wheel are not to be estimated by the 
quantify of human labour, for which the wheel is a substitute, 
but by the steadiness of application which it exacts of all the 
hands co-operating with its own movements. No time may be 
lost ; a moment's inattention is detected ; the diligence acquired

early becomes a habit ; and the same exactness is requisite in all 
departments occupied by old or young. The effect is not con- 
fined to the factories, but goes with the same persons into all 
their other avocations ; and hence, in no small degree, the industry, 
sobriety, and consequent advantages, which distinguish the popu- 
lation of this place. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Markets, Sfc. — The town of Galashiels is a burgh of barony, 
governed by a residing magistrate or bailie. Its markets have 
fallen into disuse, and its annual fairs are but thinly attended. 
The nearest markets are those of Melrose, five miles distant, 
and of Selkirk, six. The means of communication, in all direc- 
tions, are highly favourable. There is but one post-office, and 
the letters are distributed daily through the town by the post- 
master, free of charges. The new line of road for the Carlisle 
mail passing through Galashiels is now opened, and several coaches 
to and from Edinburgh pass daily. There are numerous carriers 
to all the towns and country places around, and the roads are 
every where excellent. A ton and a-half of coal are sometimes 
brought by a single cart; and twenty-five or twenty-six cwt. are no 
uncommon load. There is no want of bridges in any part of the 
parish. Of turnpike road there are five miles ; of statute labour, 
fourteen. A rail-road has been surveyed, designed to communicate 
with that of Dalkeith, and subscriptions were obtained to nearly 
the requisite amount ; but the scheme is abandoned for the pre- 
sent. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church, built in 1813 in the semigothic 
style, terminated with a square tower, is in the best state of repair. 
It is central as to the population, but not as to the breadth of the 
parish, being about 200 yards from one extremity, and six miles 
from the other. It was built to hold between 800 and 900 ; but by the 
help of benches along the areas, it accommodates about 1000 
hearers. It may be explained that this inconvenient seating, and 
the want of room that is still to be regretted, arise from this, that 
the church was built answerable to the population of the parish, but 
that half of the town of Galashiels belongs to the parish of Mel- 
rose, of which the church is distant upwards of four miles. The 
manse, built twenty-three years ago, is an excellent house. The 
stipend consists of 15 chalders of the old Linlithgow measure, or 
174 quarters, 6 bushels, \ gallon imperial, one-half meal, the

other half barley, according to the highest fiars of the county, 
and amounts on the average of the last seven years to L.242, 
lis. 9 Id. But by a strange inconsistency as to this and some 
other counties, only one average is taken in striking the fiars ; and 
ministers have not the means of ascertaining, and, consequently, 
are prevented from drawing, the amount of stipend as decreed by 
the court of teinds. The allowance for communion elements is 
L. 8, 6s. 8d. The glebe consists of somewhat less than 6 acres 
of good land, contiguous to the manse ; and there 'are paid by 
the proprietor of Lindean and Bridgeheuch, 9 bolls, 3 firlots of 
barley, Linlithgow measure, or 7 quarters, 3 pecks, \ gallon im- 
perial, as annual rent of glebe lands lying within that property. 
The number of families in the parish that attend the Established 
Church is 184; but there are twenty-nine families attached to no 
place of worship, and the remainder are Dissenters. The number 
of communicants at the Established Church is now upwards of 600. 

There are three Dissenting chapels, attended by 88 fami- 
lies ; one belonging to the United Associate Synod, one Baptist, 
and one Independent. The stipulated salary of the first is L. 100 
per annum, paid by seat rents, and the contributions of the hearers ; 
but, so far as I know, the ministers of the other two receive no re- 
muneration for their labour. 

A Bible and Missionary Society has for some years been 
established, and it is supported by the contributions of Seceders, 
as well as of persons belonging to the Establishment. Its pro- 
ceeds may be taken at L. 12 or L. 15 per annum. When Cha- 
rity sermons are preached, not annually, but occasionally, and for 
a specific object, the amount of collection is from L. 15 to L. 20. 

Education. — There are five schools in the parish ; whereof 
one is parochial, with a salary of L. 30, and fees to the amount 
of about L. 60 per annum, besides the legal accommodations ; 
one subscription, with no other benefit than that of school fees 
and a free school-room ; one private, and depending solely on 
fees ; two in the country parts of the parish, of which the one has 
a salary of L. 8, and the other of L. 2. Of the one salary of 
L. 8, L. 6 are said to be part of the old parish salary of Lindean, 
and the L.2 to each were granted by the heritors when the pa- 
rochial salary came to be augmented by the present act. In the 
parochial school, long celebrated as an academy, every branch 
taught in the best seminaries is conducted in the most approved 



 u SELKIRKSHIRE. 

manner. School fees run from 2s. 6d. to 5s. per quarter. It 
may be added, that there is no want of schools in the parish. 

Libraries, Sfc. — There are two subscription libraries : one of con- 
siderable extent, instituted in 1797, and containing 1600 volumes; 
the other, as yet small, but well selected, and of excellent use, be- 
longing to the Sabbath school, which has long been conducted by 
the Secession minister of this place. There is one public read- 
ing-room in the town ; and a small printing-office, for no larger 
publications than hand-bills and advertisements. 

Savings Bank, Sfc. — One of these was established in 1815, but 
as it belongs to the district including part of several surrounding 
parishes, no notice strictly parochial can be given. As the main 
thing, however, is to trace the fluctuations or the progress of such 
institutions, the following tabular statement may not be uninte- 
resting.

A friendly society was established in 1802. The greatest num- 
ber of members at any period was 270 ; at present they are redu- 
ced to 200. The quarterly payment in support of the funds is Is., 
and the relief afforded has varied from 3s. to 5s. per week. At this 
. time 3s. are allowed to the sick, and only 2s. to such as receive a 
permanent supply. The society is for the district. Only seventy 
of the members are of this parish. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving aid as enrolled poor is 19 ; the number receiving in- 
terim supply, 6. Both of these receive from assessments. The 
average allowance to each of the enrolled poor is 6s. 6d. per month ; 
but of those receiving interim supply the average allowance can- 
not be stated. There are church collections besides, which, with 
occasional donations, may amount to L. 25 per annum. Of this 
fund weekly distributions are made for the relief of those who 
suffer from sickness or other distress, and are not on the list of the 
enrolled poor. There can be no doubt that the assessments have 
had the effect, both of diminishing the voluntary contributions, 
and of overcoming the natural reluctance on the part of the poor 



GALASHIELS. 



27 



to apply for parochial relief. Yet there are still some examples 
of a virtuous struggle with want ; and these it is the business of 
charity to encourage and sustain ; as it is always found that the 
spirit of independence dies the moment that legal assessment comes 
to its aid. 

Inns.— Of inns and alehouses there are no less than nine in 
the parish, exclusive of the like proportion in the Melrose half of 
the town, as well as of spirit shops abounding in both districts : and 
the evil has recently been aggravated, by granting to toll-keepers 
the license of retailing spirits,— a practice which, the more it is 
vindicated by the increase of toll revenue, the more it ought to be 
reprobated for the demoralization which it creates. 

Fuel— Of fuel, coal is almost the only sort in use. Wood 
is sold in the neighbouring plantations from 2s. to 6s. a cart ; but, 
with the additional expence of carriage and chopping, it is found 
to be dearer than coal. The turnip husbandry has put an end 
to the preparing of peat in summer. Coal is brought from Mid- 
dleton, a distance of twenty-four miles on an average, to the 
parish; and sells from 9d. to Is. per cwt. A large depot has 
lately been established, which, it is hoped, will have the effect of 
equalizing the cost throughout' the year, and of supplying the poor 
with small quantities at the common price ; whereas they have 
hitherto been paying twenty-five per cent, above the rate of the 
market. 

VI. — Miscellaneous Observations. 
Besides the differences before noticed, betwixt the present state 
of the parish, and that when the former Statistical Account was 
written, it may be here observed, that the American slubbing-ma- 
chine recently introduced into this parish, and the first, I believe, 
in this country, gives every promise of success. Made only from 
drawings and partial models, it already works well ; and the in- 
genious constructors have sanguine, and not unreasonable expec- 
tation, that the same principle will soon be applied to the spinning 
department. It may be added, that, besides the greater use of 
water power, there are now four steam-engines at work, — one for 
grinding tanners' bark, and the others for the manufacture of ma- 
chinery ; and that this power has been rendered available in con- 
sequence of the improved state of the roads, which has lowered 
the price of coal. At the former period, the distance of the 
nearest post-office five miles, was the subject of great complaint; 



28 



SELKIRKSHIB E. 



now the mail, to and from London, passes through the town every 
day. The want of capital obliged the clothiers at the former pe- 
riod to sell their goods, at whatever price, as soon as manufactured ; 
now they are wont to lay in a stock of the raw material at the fittest 
season ; and to make half-yearly or quarterly visits to all parts of 
the country, when they take in fresh orders, and receive payment 
of cloths delivered at former periods. 

Though roads are in the highest state of perfection, so far as a 
good line and the Macadam mode of construction are concerned, 
yet there is no doubt that a great benefit would arise to this place 
from the adoption of rail, instead of common roads. For the 
greatest barrier to the industry and fertility of the district is its 
great distance from coal and lime, and the principal market ; all 
of which would be brought nearer by a rail-road. The value of 
land would then quickly be doubled ; and all the branches of in- 
dustry, receiving a new stimulus from this improvement, the most 
economical in the end, would commence a rapid growth.

PRESBYTERY OF SELKIRK, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TEVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. ROBERT RUSSELL, D. D. MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, 8fc. — The ancient name of the parish was St 
Mary's. In some old records, it is called the Kirk of St Mary of 
the Loives, de lacubus, the expletive being derived from its vicinity 
to two considerable lakes. There was formerly a chapel at Deuchar, 
Du-choire, i. e. a small valley, — characteristic of its site, and ano- 
ther at Kirkhope, to which the N. E. and S. E. districts of the 
present parish were attached. They appear, however, instead of 
being separate establishments, to have been subordinate to the 
mother church of St Mary. In the year 1640, the place of wor- 
ship was changed to the banks of the Yarrow, which henceforth 
imparted its name to the parish. This appellation has a common 
etymology with that of several other streams in the kingdom — 
Garic, in the British, Garbh in the Gaelic, and Garow in the 
Cornish, signifying what is rough ; and being highly descriptive of 
the river, whether of its rocky bed, or rapid flow. In the foundation 
charter of Selkirk Abbey, by King David in the twelfth century, 
the original term is translated Garua, which was afterwards soften- 
ed into Zarof, YJiarrow, and Yarn, before assuming its present 
form. 

This parish is perhaps the most extended in the south of Scot- 
land. Its greatest length is eighteen, and breadth sixteen miles, 
with an area of 111 square miles. The figure is very irregular, 
and some parts of it are almost isolated, for which no other reason 
can be assigned, than that they formerly belonged to the royal 
forest. It is bounded on the N. by Traquair, Inverleithen, and

Gospel.

Stow ; on the E. by Selkirk and Ashkirk ; on the S. by Roberton 
and Ettrick ; and on the W. by Meggat, Manor, and Peebles. 

Topographical appearances. — This high tract, approximating the 
great central range, embraces in part three principal mountain 
chains. Their general direction is from W. S. W. to E. N. E. As 
the Ettrick and Yarrow run nearly parallel in their course, the se- 
condary valleys are small ; but where the Yarrow and Tweed diverge, 
the country is drained by longer and larger streams. Excepting a 
considerable table-land to the south, the hills are generally ridge- 
shaped and rounded on the tops, having acclivities of from 10° to 30°. 
There are two features characteristic of the whole. The valleys are 
so formed, .that a projecting ridge on one side finds a corresponding 
recess in the other. In these lateral branches, too, the W. and 
S. W. sides are always steeper and barer than the opposite, insomuch 
that the fundamental strata of rocks are often prominent, or the 
surface is covered with stones, from which the soil is entirely wash- 
ed away. Our forefathers easily accounted for this general ap- 
pearance, by supposing that the sweep of the deluge came from 
the S. W., a point of the compass whence the greater part of our 
wind and rain was still seen to proceed. We subjoin from Ains- 
lie's map a table of different elevations above sea level, but the 
accuracy of his estimates has been doubted. Blackhouse Heights, 
2370 feet ; Minchmoor, 2280 : Hangingshaw Law, 1980 : Shaws 
Hill, 1212 ; Yarrow Lochs, 560 ; Deuchar Bridge, 458 ; and 
Ettrick Bridge, 440. The scenery, which is chiefly of a pastoral 
character, is not unfrequently picturesque. 

Meteorology.— As the welfare of the flocks, and the successful 
labours of the field depend much on the condition of the atmo- 
sphere, we shall now state such facts regarding it in this district as 
have come to our knowledge. The following is an average of six 
years, from 1826 to 1831, according to a diary of the weather kept 
by Mr Ballantyne at Tinnis, about 470 feet above the sea. Ba-

On the 26th February 1808, the barometer stood as high as 
30.80, and on 25th December 1821, it fell to 27.80, indicating a 
range of three inches ; but in general the annual variation is only 
two inches. It appears that the prevailing winds are S. W. and 
W., and that our greatest rains are in August, September, and 
October. There has also been kept at Bowerhope a register 
of the first appearance of flowering of several of the deepest rooted 
plants, which makes the frequent difference of seasons, reckoned 
by this rule, to be eight days, and the greatest a fortnight. The 
Luminous Arch and the Lunar Rainboiv have been witnessed but 
two or three times within the last thirty years. The Polar Lights 
are still often visible. At present, they very seldom pass or even 
reach the zenith ; but about half a century ago they seem to have 
been more common, and to have stretched in fantastic groups and 
sweeping undulations quite to the southern horizon. 

Prognostics from Atmospheric Phenomena. — For an account of 
the various prognostics of the weather applicable to this district, and 
no doubt to many others, we are indebted to one on whose intelli- 
gence and accuracy we can implicitly rely. First, as to prognostics 
from atmospheric phenomena. — When there is a copious deposit of 
clew, and it remains long on the grass; when the fog in the valleys is 
slowly dissipated by the sun's heat, and lingers on the hills ; when 
the clouds apparently take a higher station : and especially when a 
few cirro-strati appear loose or slightly connected, lying at rest or 
gently floating along, serene weather may be confidently expected. 
A change of this settled state is presaged by the wind suddenly 
rising, by close continuous cirro-strati gathering into an unbroken 
gloom, and by that variety known as the goat's hair or grey mare's 
tail. Sometimes a few light fleecy clouds skim rapidly between 
the superincumbent vapour and the earth's surface, and are the 
forerunners of snow or rain. Should the cirri not pass away with 
the immediate fall, but extend towards the horizon, and present 
their troubled edges towards the zenith, there will be stormy 
weather for some time. When a modification of the cirro-stratus

plication throughout Scotland— J.

SELKIRKSHIRE. 



is formed to leeward, thick in the middle, and wasting at both 
ends, with its side to the wind like a ship lying-to, it indicates con- 
tinued wind. After a clear frost, we sometimes see long whitish- 
coloured streaks of cirrus, whose two extremities seemingly ap- 
proach each other as they recede from the zenith. This appear- 
ance is vulgarly called Noah's ark ; and if it point from S. W. to 
N. E., we expect a thaw from S. W. Small blackish boat-shaped 
clouds rising in the west, and moving sideways, indicate a gentle 
thaw, with little or no rain. A short glare of red in the east about 
sunrising portends a rainy and windy day. When the sky shines 
from the watery exhalations around the mid-day sun, rain or snow 
will soon follow; when it has a green appearance to the E. or 
N. E., frost and snow. A crimson red in the west after sunset in- 
dicates fair weather; a purple red indicates sleet. Atmospheric 
changes are more likely to happen a few days after new or full 
moon than in the quarters. The point where she changes, seems 
to have little influence ; if in the N. W., or N. W. by W., it is often 
succeeded by boisterous weather. When her horns are sharp and 
well-defined, we look for frost ; when she is whitish and not very 
clear, for rain or snow. If the new moon seem to embrace the old, 
very stormy weather is likely to follow. This has long been a re- 
ceived opinion amongst our countrymen, as we learn from the old 
ballad of Sir Patrick Spens, supposed to refer to an early period 
of Scottish history. 

" I saw the new moon late yestreen, wi' the auld moon in her arm, 
And ever alack, my master dear, I fear we suffer harm." 

Haloes are seen only when the cirro-strati are slightly but equally 
diffused over the sky ; the sun or moon seems to " wander through 
the storm," which is at no great distance. One side of the halo 
is often open or imperfectly formed, owing to the denseness of the 
vapour, and points to the quarter from which the storm is approach- 
ing. When Parhelia or mock-suns appear, the cloud is more 
stratified ; hence, though, like haloes, they forebode a change, it is 
not so immediate. From the rainbow also, we draw prognostics 
of the weather. Sea-faring men say, 

" A rainbow in the morning — sailors take warning ; 
A rainbow at night is the sailors' delight." 

And shepherds and husbandmen assent to the truth of this old 
adage. In the former case, as the arch must be opposite the 
sun, it appears in the west, whence our rains generally come; in 
the latter it irradiates the east, and indicates that the rain is pas- 
sing from us. Aurora borealis is most likely to appear in change-

able weather, and is often followed by a S. W. wind. From the 
appearance of falling stars, it may be inferred that the equilibrium 
of the atmosphere, held probably by the agency of electricity, is 
destroyed. They generally forebode wind ; and when many of 
them are seen, they are faithful, though silent monitors, warning us 
to prepare, with the earliest dawn, for the coming storm. There 
is often much lightning in the night both with and without 
clouds, which announces unsettled weather, especially if it be 
whitish in colour. If the thunder clouds are low, we may expect 
heavy showers or continuous rains. A thunder storm from the 
south is followed by a genial warmth ; from the north by cold and 
hail. When the wind shifts to the west after rain from S. or 
S. W., it generally fairs up, or there are but a few showers. Frost 
and snow from S. W. are the forerunners of bad weather. If the 
wind turn suddenly from S. W. or S. to N. N. E., while this is ac r 
companied with a smell resembling that of coal smoke, a severe 
storm will follow. Sometimes in the month of May, often in June, 
&amp;c. an undulatory motion may be observed in the air, near the 
earth's surface. This is the land-tide, called by the peasantry 
Startling Jack, which generally takes place when the weather is a 
little sultry; the weather afterwards becomes colder. A haze or ou- 
der, as it is often named, indicates a mild state of the atmosphere, 
and prognosticates a long continuance of heat and drought. The 
summer of 1783 was remarkable for this appearance. It is generally 
accompanied with a moderate S. W. wind, and sometimes a calm, 
but it never remains long with a north or east wind. When eva- 
poration is perceptibly carried on by the sun's heat, we expect 
cold to succeed. 

Prognostics from Animals. — The troubles that befal our spe- 
cies are not without their use in this respect; headach, tooth- 
ach, rheumatism, pain in corns, and old sprains and sores, being 
frequent signs of the approaching storm. Before thunder, many 
have a feeling of listlessness, oppression, and uneasiness. The 
lower animals, but such especially as are still in a state of nature, 
or exposed in the open fields, are very susceptible of atmospheric 
changes. Sheep eat greedily before a storm, and sparingly before 
a thaw. When they leave the high parts of their range, — when 
they bleat much in the evening, or during the night, we may ex- 
pect severe weather. Goats seek a place of shelter, while swine 
carry litter and cover themselves better than ordinary, before a 
storm. Wind is foretold by the cat scratching a post or wall, — 
arid a thaw, when she washes her face, or when frogs come from

their winter concealment. The gathering of grouse into large 
flocks, the diving of sparrows in dry dust, the fluttering of wild 
ducks as they flap their wings, the dismal lengthened howl of sea- 
gulls in an inland place, or around lakes, the mournful note of the 
curlew, the shrill whew of the plover, the wliet-whet-whet of the 
chaffinch perched upon a tree, the crowing of the cock at unusual 
times, — all prognosticate rain or snow. When the fieldfare, red- 
wing, starling, swan, snowfleck, and other birds of passage, arrive 
soon from the north, it indicates an early and severe winter. When 
gnats bite very keenly, when flies keep near the ground, shown 
by swallows that feed upon the wing flying low, we look for wind 
and rain. But the most wonderful influence of atmospheric 
changes is upon those creatures that burrow in the ground. The 
earth-worm appearing in abundance indicates rain. In like man- 
ner, the mole seems to feel its approach, as a day or two before 
he raises more hillocks than usual ; and when after a long severe 
frost he begins again to work, it will soon become fresh. The 
effects of electricity are well known both on the atmosphere and 
on animals ; and the deposition of the aqueous vapours with the 
relaxing damp near the surface of the earth, which in certain states 
takes place, may give rise to this increased activity. 

Additional Prognostics. — Before rain, many plants close their 
petals and hang down their heads, as the trefoil, mountain-daisy, 
and chickweed ; a paved floor of clay-slate and cellars become 
clamp ; in lakes and springs the water rises higher, and the efflux 
is greater. But the barometer excels all these prognostics ; and 
by combining the observations of both, one may predict the wea- 
ther with considerable certainty. If it fall a day or two previous- 
ly, the storm is likely to last ; if shortly, it will neither be so severe 
nor protracted. A similar rule is applicable to the rise of the 
barometer. But allowance must be made for the influence of 
certain winds. With the same quantity of rain or snow, the mer- 
cury stands highest with a N. E. and E. wind ; then N. and W. 
and S. W., and S. in order. It stands lowest of all when the 
wind is N. W. and S. E. The extremes both of heat and cold 
depress, while a moderate temperature raises it. Thus, after long 
frost and snow, it generally rises before a thaw. Sometimes it is 
very low with little rain, or in fair weather. But in this case the 
equilibrium of the atmosphere is destroyed, and nothing is award- 
ing but a sufficiency of aqueous vapour, which may be falling at 
no very great distance. For example : on January 30th 1814, 
barometer 28.70, it was mostly clear in this district ; but in Invcr- 



YARROW. 



35 



ness-shire there fell a great quantity of snow. In like manner, 
when the wind is variable, it often blows hard from opposite points, 
even in this northern part of our island. Thus, 1st April 1813, 
was a stormy day in Inverness-shire, and the wind N. E. ; whereas 
in Selkirkshire, a very severe blast of snow came from S. W. In 
both places the wind went to N. W. by W. at night. We men- 
tion these things, to show that there are often secondary causes in 
operation, and at the time to us unknown, which tend to render our 
calculations incorrect. 

The Climate of the parish is damp and cold. This must be 
ascribed to the mists that rise from the marshy grounds, the vici- 
nity of the central mountain range, which serves as a nucleus to 
embody the hovering exhalations, the prevalence of the W. and 
S. W. winds, and the peculiar exposure of the vallies to those from 
the E. and N. E. The vicissitudes of the weather are extremely 
frequent. Of late years, however, the climate has been much 
ameliorated by draining, and might be still farther improved by 
plantation. The diseases in some measure connected with it, are 
catarrh, rheumatism, consumption, and fevers. These are more 
prevalent in the vale of Ettrick than of Yarrow, owing to the 
greater extent of marshy and meadow-ground ; but the district is 
far from being unfavourable to health or longevity. One indivi- 
dual within the memory of man reached the very advanced period 
of 106 years; and a number have nearly seen the course of a cen- 
tury. There is a woman still alive 1833 who remembers the 
forty-Jive, when she assisted in putting some cattle and household 
articles beyond the reach of the Highlanders. 

Hydrography. Sjjrings. — The greater part of the springs are 
perennial. Their temperature is in general about 45°. Calcareous 
springs are found in fifteen different places ; sometimes near each 
other, and rising in lines. The accumulation of calcareous deposit 
from one of them, amounting to about forty cart-loads, was once col- 
lected for agricultural purposes, but, owing to the steepness of the 
hill, could not easily be removed. There is a sulphureous spring on 
Craig farm, and another on Catslacknow, which probably flow 
from a bed of alum-slate. The latter is sometimes resorted to by 
the peasantry ; but the strength is considerably diluted from its 
situation in the midst of a marsh, the water of which oozes through. 
It is called St Philip's Well ; and its dedication to a patron saint, 
as was usual in Roman Catholic times, would seem to intimate 
that it had been famed for its medicinal virtues. There are two

chalybeates on Bowerhope. The oxide of iron is found in man 
of the mosses, and seen in the water that flows from them. 

Lakes. — The principal lake in the parish, or indeed in the soutli 
of Scotland, is St Mary's, connected by a stream with a smaller one, 
which has the pleonastic appellation, Loch of the Lowes lochs. 
The former is seven and a-half miles in circumference, and in 
some places thirty fathoms deep ; the latter one mile and a-half, 
and eleven fathoms. Both, to high-water mark, are exclusively 
the property of the Right Honourable Lord Napier, who has 
beautified some parts of them by plantation. It is evident that 
they have originally formed one lake, whose margin extended a 
considerable way to the N. E. The difference of level is only 
fifteen inches ; and the narrow neck of land which now separates 
them has been raised by the opposite currents of the Corsecleugh 
and Oxcleuffh Burns. In the introduction to the Second Canto 
of " Marmion," there is a graphic description of the surrounding 
scenery.' It partakes not of the rich or romantic, but has a cha- 
racter of soft repose, — derived from the unbroken slope of the 
hills, the winding of the water as it washes their base, and the 
stilly solitude on every side. The margin of the lake is skirted 
with a few old trees, that serve but to remind us of the ancient 
forest. At a short distance, too, are the relics of Catholic and 
feudal times, which harmonize with such a scene, as we trace the 
vestiges of St Mary's Chapel, with its lone church-yard, — " then 
gaze on Dryhope's ruined tower, and think on Yarrow's faded 
flower." 

In the table-land to the south are a number of small lochs, 
Shaws, Clearburn, Hellmoor, and Akermoor, whose size varies 
from a mile to a mile and a-half in circumference. Some of them 
contain inexhaustible deposits of shell-marl ; one has been drain- 
ed, and the. marl successfully used in agriculture. Our vallies 
seem formerly to have been, like many others in Scotland, a chain 
of lakes. The most marked trace of this kind is at Newhouse, 
where the Ettrick has worn its way in the course of ages. The 
rocks rise almost perpendicularly, — and, overgrown as they arc 
with furze, and overhung with copsewood, present a view of Nature's 
rude magnificence. 

Rivers. — In noticing the rivers of the parish, we shall confine our 
attention to that from which it derives its name; though if includes al - 
so part of the Ettrick and Tweed. " The hills whence classic Yar- 
row flows," form the boundary with Dumfries-shire, and send a

number of streams to the lochs, of which the principal are Meggat, 
and what is sometimes called Little Yarrow. After leaving these 
beautiful sheets of water, and running for fourteen miles over a 
gravelly and rocky channel, the river joins the Ettrick. The length 
from its source is about twenty-five miles. From the country be- 
ing now drained, it swells more quickly than formerly, but not to 
any height till the loch first overflow ; and, on the other hand, a 
strong south-west wind, by acting on St Mary's as a reservoir, 
often makes it rise without rain. The strath traversed by this 
stream has long been classic ground. It is, indeed, singular how 
many men of genius have at once felt and deepened the charm. 
" The sang of the outlaw Murray," and "the Douglas Tragedie," 
both belong to these scenes ; and the oldest verses to " The Yel- 
low-Hair'd Laddie," are also localized by certain allusions which 
they contain. But the best known of the ancient ballads similar 
in subject and style to another fragment, " Willie's drown'd in 
1 arrow," is, " The Dowie Dens of Yarrow," commemorative of 
a melancholy event that had made a deep impression on the popu- 
lar mind. It is supposed to have suggested to Mr Hamilton of 
Bangour, the more modern song beginning, " Busk ye, busk ye, 
my bonnie bonnie bride." Hence, also, the plaintive strain of 
Logan, " Thy braes were bonny, Yarrow stream, &amp;c. ;" and 
Wordsworth's fine effusions, " Yarrow unvisited," and " Yarrow 
visited," to which, it. is hoped, an unpublished piece, entitled " Yar- 
row revisited," will soon be added. In celebration of a female beau- 
ty, the two songs of " Mary Scott," and " The Rose in Yarrow," 
are preserved. We might refer, besides, to " Yarrow Vale" by Mr 
M'Donald ; " The Braes of Yarrow," by Allan Ramsay ; another 
set by Miss Thomson, and many of a similar kind ; while the inci- 
dental allusions to this little stream are without number. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The rocks throughout the parish 
belong to the transition class, and consist almost entirely of grey- 
wacke, with a basis of clay-slate. The general direction of the 
strata is from S. W. to N. E., but it often varies for a short way : 
the clip is generally 45°, though it ranges from the perpendicular 
to the horizontal. At Newhouse Lynns the river Ettrick has cut 
through the barrier' of an ancient lake for three-fourths of a mile, 
and to the depth of a hundred feet. Its course is almost straight 
For a considerable way, when it suddenly diverges ; and in one 
place, the thin strain which are laid bare arc bent to a curve of 
more than '220°. Flinty slate, and loose fragments of porphyry.

feldspar, and quartz, may be observed in glens connected with the 
head of the Yarrow. There is a formation of new sandstone up Dry- 
hope Burn, and also a bed of transition glossy alum-slate, the latter 
being found again in a soft and friable state, from exposure to the 
air, by the side of the river near Yarrow-ford. Iron pyrites occurs 
plentifully on Bowerhope, and calcareous spar on Kirkstead. In 
the rocky bank close by the house of Langhope, is a deep bed of 
rich micaceous earth, having a beautiful metallic lustre. A seam 
of clay between the strata of slate crosses the Blackcleugh in 
Blackhouse, and contains glittering particles of a similar nature, 
which are probably mica also. Pieces of insulated galena have 
been sometimes picked up. No limestone has as yet been disco- 
vered in the parish ; but the number of calcareous springs indicate 
its existence at no great depth. 

The skulls of the Urus described by Csesar, and an extinct spe- 
cies of deer with large palmated antlers, have been found imbed- 
ded in the marl mosses. An old spur, with a rowel nine inches 
in circumference, was found by Sir W. Scott in Huntly Meadow. 
The extensive tracts of peat are full of decayed trees, a great pro- 
portion on the hills being the birch, and in the low grounds the oak. 
As instances of the preservative quality of this vegetable formation, 
two facts may be noticed. There was a tradition of a suicide having 
been buried in a moss near Berrybush more than a century before ; 
and, in digging the place a few years ago, the body was found en- 
tire, with the bonnet, coat, plaid, hose, &amp;c. quite fresh. In cast- 
ing another close to the dwelling-house of Whitehope, a layer of 
lint was met with covered with stones. It had evidently been laid 
out to steep on the subsoil and not removed, and was six feet below 
the surface. 

A great part of our soil is a light, hazel-coloured loam, formed 
from the decomposition of the rocks, and much mixed with stoiu ;s. 
It is common on the sides of the hills, and the gentle acclivities 
along their base. In some places there are Trifolium repens, Bri- 
lls perennis, Plantago lanceolate/, &amp;c. which make an excellent pas- 
ture. Where it is deep, Polypodium vulrjare is found in abun- 
dance ; but, where thin and exposed, it is apt to be overrun with 
musci. On the sunny slopes, as Wardlaw Craig, Catslacknow- 
hill, Deucharhope, &amp;c. Cistus helianthemum, or the rock-rose, 

 A head of the Urus or Bison, in the hall at Abbdtsford, which was found in a 
neighbouring moss, indicates an animal nearly three times the size of the Chilhng- 
hara wild cattle, and corroborates Osai's description.

sometimes covers t he surface, to the exclusion almost of every other 
plant ; and in fine seasons, between June and July, a whole hill- 
side is one entire yellow blow. Along the banks of the rivers, and 
generally at their confluence with the tributary rivulets, there are 
low flat promontories of water-worn gravel, which abound with 
Tormentilla officinalis, Calluna vulgaris, and different kinds of 
lichens. Another variety of soil is clay, having a strong affinity 
to bog, into which it gradually runs, as the subsoil becomes less 
porous. This commonly covers the bases of the hills that slope 
eastward,  but partakes less of sweet palatable plants than the 
light loam already mentioned. The bog soil in this parish con- 
sists mostly of argillaceous clay, with a mixture of fine sand, and a 
little vegetable mould near the surface ; the subsoil being uniform- 
ly stiff cold argil, sometimes interspersed with stones or round 
gravel. It produces abundance of Carices, Jancus acutiflorus, 
Holcus lanatus, with several of the Poa, Aira, and Fcstuca tribes. 
Since draining has taken place so extensively, these have been in 
a great measure supplanted by Cnicus palustris on the mossy 
ground, Aira ccespitosa, Melica ccemdea, and Agrostidce on the clay. 
And lastly, we have tracts of peat stretching for miles, and vary- 
ing in depth from a few inches to seven feet. Scirpus ccespitosns, 
Juncus squarrosus, Nardus stricta, Eriophorum vaginatum, Calluna 
vulgaris, Erica tetralix, Empetrum nigrum, Galium saxatile, and 
Vaccinium myrtillus, are found in greatest abundance; V. Oxycoc- 
cos and Rubus chamamorus only in a few places. 

Zoology. — " Two species of mice have occasionally been met 
with, which, as yet, have been overlooked by scientific naturalists. 
One inhabits the tops of the highest mountains, and is a lit t It- 
larger than the Mus sylvaticus. The fur has a silky softness and 
lustre; and as the animal is turned round, it falls open by iis 
weight in a shed along the body, being apparently attached to the 
skin by a filament of extraordinary fineness and elasticity. The 
other is of a size between this and the Mus aquaticus ; has like 
them a short tailandears; the tail tipped with white. It has very 

 These clay bogs have perhaps been deposited by an eddy of the great western 
deluge. When the current of this tremendous debacle beat violently against the face 
of a mountain, it seems as if the debris and mud transported by the waters had 
settled down along the base of an opposite ridge, or it might have been swept round 
into the lee side of that from which it had been washed away. The soil in question 
rests upon masses of till, i. c. collections of gravel somewhat water-worn, and cement- 
ed by very tenacious clay ; and the hollow parts, where there are springs, arc often 
covered with some feet of peat moss.

large, strong, grooved, semicircular teeth, and inhabits the low- 
grounds, but is extremely rare. Only three have been observed ; 
one of which, when running, stopt at times, and stood upright with 
its fore-paws over its eyes, like a weasel or squirrel."  

The woodlands of this district were formerly inhabited by vari- 
ous animals that have disappeared ; as the urus, the stag, and an- 
other species of deer. The wolf, the mountain-boar, and the wild 
cat, were common in early times. We learn from the old song, 
that Ettrick forest abounded with " the hart, the hynd, the doe, 
the roe, and of a' beasts great plentie j" and hence it was long re- 
served for the royal chace. The names of places too, some of 
them common to different spots, still refer to the animals by which 
they were frequented ; thus we have Ox-cleugh, Deer-law, Hart- 
leap, Hynd-hoye, Faivn-bum, Wolf-cleugh, Brock-hill, Siviiie-hme, 
CW-slack, &amp;c. A few otters may be found about the rivers, but 
badgers are now very rare, and foxes nearly extirpated. Hares, 
however, and in the lower parts of the parish rabbits, are plentiful. 
Black and red grouse, partridges, snipes, with a few pheasants, 
are the principal game. In 1649, and for long afterwards, the 
black-cock and grey-hen were found on the hills, but at length 
disappeared, till they gradually returned from the S. W. border, 
about the same time that means were taken to introduce them by 
the late Duke of Buccleuch. When the season is severe, swans 
arrive from the north. 

Most of the lakes are stored with pike, perch, eels, trout, and 
minnow. It is curious that the pike are now seldom seen in St 
Mary's, where they once were abundant, and larger than in the upper 
loch. Salmon, grilse, whitling, trout, eels, par, minnows, barbels, 
and sticklebacks, tenant the rivers. Formerly many lampreys 
came up to spawn, weighing six or seven pounds, but are now rare. 
A minute species, however, about the thickness of a crow-quill, is 
abundant, and may be seen in swarms during the month of May, 
frequenting the shallow streams, where it deposits its spawn on fine 
sand. In an economical point of view, the different varieties of 
trout, though of late years much thinned, are alone important. 
Salmon and grilse abound only during close-time. They ascend 
the rivers for spawning in the beginning of October with what is

called the Michaelmas flood; and those that have escaped the 
poachers, return to the sea about, or after, Candlemas. 

The whole herbage on the hills around the sources of the Et- 
trick and Yarrow was destroyed by a caterpillar in 1762, long- 
called the wormy year, until 1802, when in June and July a simi- 
lar occurrence happened. The upper parts of this parish, with 
the high lands adjoining, were then overrun by a species of grub- 
worm, belonging, it was at that time believed, to the order Lepidop- 
tera, and genus Papilio.  A few of them were fed in a bottle by Mr 
A. Laidlaw at Bowerhope, when, after undergoing the usual meta- 
morphosis into a crysalis, they emerged beautiful butterflies, — laid 
about one hundred eggs, and died. They made their first appear- 
ance on the dry benty land, consuming every thing green ; and though 
thousands of crows and other birds fed constantly upon them, they 
gradually spread into the boggy and finer pastures. The only plants 
spared were Calluna vulgaris, Juncus squarrosus, and Galium sax- 
atile. When they were feeding, from six to eight might have been 
covered with the palm of the hand ; and where a burn intercepted 
their progress, they lay in heaps by the side. Some heavy rains 
at length drowned or swept them into the drains, many of which 
were literally stopped. They again made their appearance in 1812, 
1824, and 1826; but their ravages were confined to some of the 
heights bordering on Dumfries-shire, f 

A similar infliction was felt more partially in 1829, and since by 
the larva of a Tipida, — the common long-legged fly. This species 
is different from the former in appearance and habits; infesting 
the soft boggy land. It is as thick as a goose-quill ; of a dull pur- 
ple colour; never burrows deep in the soil; works its way like the 
earth-worm ; and eats only the roots, or at least the white parts of 
the grass. The black caterpillar that devoured the turnip crop in 
1805, and has never been seen since, was the larva of a fly some- 
what like a gutter-wasp, of the genus Tenthredo, Lin. The 

• Kirby and Spcnce suppose the perfect insect to have been a moth of a genus call- 
ed Phalanaby Linnaeus, Bombyx by Fabricius, and Charceas grambili by Stephens. 

f It is quite certain that the-devastation of the herbage is occasioned by the larva: 
of the Charceas grambm of Stephens, Phalccna graminis, Lin.; but the causer of 
this insect being produced in certain places and seasons in such destructive numbers, 
has not been ascertained. The injury done to the pastures in some parts of the island, 
however, is perhaps compensated by the increased production of grass in future sen- 
sons; at least, in one case, the herbage of a portion of a hill destroyed in 1824, was, at 
the distance of six years, and in comparison with other parts of the same hill, percep- 
tibly and materially improved. — Ent. Mag. i. 200.

turnip-fly which is now destructive, is a beetle, Haltica nemorum ; 
but from its being generally bred on the manure, to burn a little 
straw over the surface is found an effectual way of killing it. The 
large and beautiful green caterpillar, dotted with pencils of black 
spines, of the Emperor-moth, or Saturnia spiiii, Phalcenapavonia, 
Lin. is often found feeding on the heath, where it fixes the brown 
silk bag it weaves for its winter habitation. But the moth itself, nearly 
as large as a wren, is rarely seen. There are several insects also 
that injure fruit trees, — cankering the leaves, and eating the blossom. 

Botany. — The botany, like the mineralogy of the district, 
and probably connected with it, is very uniform. The more rare 
plants are Rubus chamcemorus, which arrives at perfection only 
on Dryhope, Blackhouse, and Kirksteacl ; Festuca vivipara on the 
N. skirts of Wardlaw and Altrive ; Vaccinium oxycoccos on Gil- 
disgreen and Shaws ; Trientalis Europcea on Blackhouse Heights ; 
Trollius Europc&amp;us and Cnicus heteropliyllus in a cleugh falling 
into Douglas burn; Sedum villosum ; Circea Alpina on S. E. 
verge of St Mary's Loch; Cochlearia officinalis, in the springs 
along the ridge between Newburgh and Eldinhope ; Campanula 
latifolia in a ravine, Deuchar Hope; Drosera rotundifolia, Deu- 
char Hope ; Scutellaria galericidata in pond at Whitehope ; 
Melampyrum sylvaticum in Newhouse Bank; Allium ursinum 
and Adiantum capillus veneris, at Newhaugh Lynns ; TJialic- 
trum alpinum on the opposite bank of Helmburn. The me- 
dicinal plants best known are Tormentilla officinalis, the root of 
which is uncommonly astringent, good for sore throats, and effica- 
cious in curing old ulcers ; Achillea millefolium, which is common 
in Yarrow, and highly astringent also ; Linum catharticum, a pur- 
gative when boiled ; Menyanthes trifoliata, used as a tonic, an in- 
fusion from the leaves being taken for stomach complaints, and 
mixed with L. catharticum for rheumatism ; Digitalis purpurea 
and Alsine media absorbents, and applied for swellings, &amp;c. 

In former times, the straths of the Ettrick and Yarrow receiv- 
ed the appropriate designation of Ettrick Forest. The name is 
still retained, but is no longer characteristic of the country, which 
is almost one continuous sheep-walk. The woods began to be 
cleared several centuries ago ; and the depth of the many mosses 
may point in some degree to the period of their destruction or de- 
cay. The only remnant of the old forest, where the identical trees 
still stand, is believed to be a few oaks on West Faldshope Hill ; 
but they are remarkable for their age alone, being small and stunt-

ed from the dry rocky nature of the ground. There is a great 
deal of fine wood at Hangingshaw, the once beautiful seat of the 
Murrays of Philiphaugh, and now belonging to James Johnstone, 
Esq. of Alva. A plane-tree measures in circumference near the 
root, 16 feet, in solid contents 390 square feet ; a beech, circum- 
ference 13 feet, contents 202 square feet; a lime, circumference 
11£ feet, contents 180 square feet; an oak, circumference 11 feet, 
contents 166 square feet. But Hangingshaw is remarkable chiefly 
for the extent and variety of its valuable trees. Many of the same 
kinds are scarcely inferior in size to those. already specified; while 
the ashes, elms, larches, and Scots firs, raised from Highland seed, 
and the timber of which is of very superior quality, average 8 feet 
in circumference, and 100 square feet in contents. The soil ap- 
pears congenial to trees of every sort ; and so adapted is it to its 
ancient covering, that copses, particularly of birch, will spring spon- 
taneously wherever the ground is enclosed. 

H. — Civil History. 
Accounts of the Parish.— There are no ancient or modern ac- 
counts, so far as we are aware, that refer solely and specially to 
Yarrow parish. Two MSS., however, are to be found in the Ad- 
vocates' Library, which notice its former condition in a general 
description of Selkirkshire. The one was written in 1649, by Wil- 
liam Elliot of Stobs and Walter Scot of Arkilton. The other is 
Hodges' MS., bearing the date of 1722 ; but it is chiefly a detail of 
names, localities, and distances. In the Edinburgh Encyclopaedia, 
Art. Selkirkshire, there is an excellent statistical account by Mr 
William Laidlaw, a native of this parish, and author of the well- 
known song, " Lucy's flittin," &amp;c We may refer also to a prize 
essay on the same subject by the Ettrick Shepherd, written in a 
popular style, and published in Transactions of the Highland 
Society for 1832. The Duke of Buccleuch possesses about 
two-thirds of the parish, and the other land-owners are, in the 
order of the valuation of their estates, as follows: James John- 
stone, Esq. of Alva, the Earl of Traquaire, Lord Napier, Lord 
Elibank, James Mercer, Esq. of Scotsbank, Hugh Scott, Esq. of 
Harden, the Earl of Minto, Miss Williamson of Cardrona, James

Parochial Registers.— A large proportion of the old parochial 
registers was burnt about seventy years ago, along with the manse.

In those extant, the date of the earliest entry is 1G91 ; but from 
the beginning till nearly the middle of last century, with the ex- 
ception of a few years between, there is a perfect blank. Since 
1741, however, .the registers -have been more regularly and care-' 
fully kept. 

Historical Events. — This parish formed a principal part of the 
sheriffdom of Ettrick Forest. It was recovered, with the surround- 
ing districts, from the English by Sir James Douglas, and as a 
reward of his services conferred on him by a grant from his sove- 
reign and friend Robert Bruce, who erected them into a free re- 
gality. These lands were again forfeited to the Crown, on the 
attainder of the family of Douglas in 1455, when a part of them 
was bestowed on Sir Walter Scott, ancestor of the Buccleuch fa- 
mily, who had exerted himself in suppressing the rebellion of the 
Douglasses. In 1503, James IV. endowed his queen, the Lady- 
Margaret of England, with the Forest of Ettrick and Tower of 
Newark, which had formerly been the dowry of Mary of Guelders. 
Hence, probably, our two farms of Deloraine de la reine receiv- 
ed their name, or afterwards perhaps from Mary of Lorraine. It 
would also appear that about this time the wood began to be clear- 
ed away. We learn from Pitscottie, that James V. had " 10,000 
sheep going in the forest under the keeping of Andrew Bell, who 
made the king as good an account of them as if they had gone in 
the bounds of Fife."  This royal demesne was his frequent resort 
to enjoy the pleasures of the chase. 

" Of such proud huntings many tales 
Yet linger in our lonely dales ; 
Up pathless Ettricke and on Yarrow, 
Where erst the outlaw drew his arrow. " 

A pass between the two valleys preserves the traces of one of 
these expeditions. It retains the significant name of the Hart's 
leap ; the distance of the leap, being distinctly visible at the time 
when the ground was covered with snow, is still marked by two 
grey whinstones, twenty-eight feet apart, which are said to have 
been raised by the king and his followers. Under the Crown, the 
proprietors of the forest held their lands as rentallers, or king's 
kindly tenants, as they had done under the Lords of Douglas. 
Very few of them received charters until the year 1587, when 
James VI. came of age. The quit rents paid to the Crown h\ 
the kindly tenants continue burdens on the estates to the present 
day, and are collected by the chamberlain of Ettrick Forest. There

Eminent Characters. — 1. Mary Scott, so well known in tradition 
and in song by the title of Tlie Flower of Yarrow, was a native of the 
parish. She was the daughter of John Scott of Dryhope, and gave 
her hand to Walter Scott of Harden — no less famed for his free- 
bootino- than his bride for her beauty. 2. Connected with this pa- 
rish, was Sir Gideon Murray, who rose to be one of the senators of 
the College of Justice, by the title of Lord Elibank. The appoint- 
ment took place in 1613, — when the Lords dispensed with any trial 
of his qualifications " because of the certaine knowledge they had of 
them." 3. Dr John Rutherford, a man of genius himself, and father 
of a family of genius. He was long known in his professional ca- 
reer as the Yarrow Doctor, from having been a native of this parish, 
where his father was installed clergyman after the revolution. He 
studied under Boerhaave; and in 1727, being elected Professor 
of the Practice of Physic in the Edinburgh University, contributed 
greatly to establish its high character as a school of medicine. 4. 
Elibank was the birth place of Russell, the learned historian of an- 
cient and modern Europe. 5. Equally celebrated in a different 
sphere, was his kinsman, the late Colonel William Russell of Ashie- 
steel, whose heroic military exploits in India, and in particular at 
Manilla, reflect honour on himself and his country. 6th, For ten 
years subsequently to the death of the gallant Colonel in 1802, 
Ashiesteel was the country residence of Sir Walter Scott, who had 
before been appointed Sheriff of Selkirkshire. While living at this 
outskirt of the parish, he won his earliest laurels ; and a small hil- 
lock covered with trees, beneath whose shade much of his poetry 
was penned, is still called "the Sherra's Knowe." 7. Among the 
eminent characters, linked by long residence with Yarrow parish, 

" A curious contract relating to their marriage is still preserved in the charter- 
chest of the present Mr Scott of Harden. From this it appears, that the Laird of 
Dryhope engaged to find his son-in-law in man's meat and horse meat at his tower 
of Dryhope for a year and day — five barons becoming bound, that, on the expiry of 
that period, the latter should remove without attempting to continue in possession 
by force  A notary public, signed for all the parties to the deed, none of whom could 
write their names. A daughter of the Flower of Yarrow was wedded to Gilbert 
Elliot of Stobs, commonly called " Gibby wi' the gowden garters." At their mar- 
riage, as at. Harden's own, a contract was made, equally characteristic of the rude- 
ness ana rapine of the times. Finding it inconvenient to take home his wife, Gibby 
besought his father-in-law to lodge her for some time; — a demand which was com- 
plied with only on condition that he should give as her board the plunder of the first 
harvest moon. From them was descended the late Lord Heathfield.

must be mentioned Mr James Hoyg t author of the " Queen's Wake,"- 
and commonly called the " Ettrick Shepherd." 

Antiquities and Traditions. — The ruins of St Mary's Chapel 
are now level with the dust, and mark only where it stood. It was 
injured by the clan of Scott, in a feud with the Cranstouns ; but 
continued a place of worship during the first part of the seventeenth 
century. The vestiges of the chaplain's house are also visible ; and 
the ancient cemetery is still used by several families. About 400 
yards to the eastward, there is a small mound called Binram's cross 
or corse, with a few stones on the top, — probably, as tradition re- 
presents, the burial-place of some necromantic priest, from decay- 
ed wood and ashes being found on its being opened. 

There are still some remains of the old towers or Peel-houses, 
which were formerly occupied by the feudal barons, and their retainers. 
The oldest of these now standing, and whose figure has been dif- 
ferent from all the rest, is Blackhouse, situated in a solitary glen 
up Douglas  Dhu-glas, i. e. dark-grey burn. This wild tract form- 
ed one of the most ancient possessions of the Black Douglases. 
Godscroft represents them as baronial lords of it in the time of 
Malcolm Canmore ; and this was the usual retreat of the good Sir 
James, when recruiting for Bruce. It is here too, that tradition 
has placed the scene of " the Douglas Tragedie," and seven large 
stones on the neighbouring heights are shown as marking the spot 
where the seven brethren were slain. Elibank Castle, connected 
also in popular story with doughty deeds, still overhangs the 
Tweed. The lower part of the massy walls of Dryhope is nearly 
entire. 

There is a piece of ground lying to the west of Yarrow Kirk, 
which appears to have been the scene of slaughter and sepulchre. 
From time immemorial it was a low waste moor till twenty-five 
years ago, when formed into a number of cultivated enclosures. On 
more than twenty different spots were large cairns, in many of 
which fine yellow dust, and in one an old spear, was found. Two 
unhewn massive stones still stand, about 100 yards distant from 
each other, and which doubtless are the monuments of the dead. 
The real tradition simply bears, that here a deadly feud was set- 
tled by dint of arms ; the upright stones mark the place where the 
two lords or leaders fell, and the bodies of their followers were thrown 
into a marshy pool, called the Dead Lake, in the adjoining haugh. 
It is probable that this is the locality of " the Dowie Dens of Yar- 
row." One cannot easily, however, unravel the details, or fix the

date of the event which the old ballad describes. Some suppose 
it to have been a duel fought betwixt John Scott of Tushielaw, 
and Walter Scott of Thirlestane, that proved fatal to the latter ; 
but, as appears from authentic records, this took place on Deuchar 
Swire. Others have identified it with the fray at a hunting- 
match in Ettrick Forest, in which a son of Scott of Harden, resident 
at Kirkhope, was killed by his kinsman the Scotts of Gilmans- 
cleugh. But the tales of tradition, which are often a few scatter- 
ed leaves torn from the book of time, it is difficult to collect or con- 
nect with accuracy. About 300 yards westward, when the cultiva- 
tion of this moor began, the plough struck upon a large flat stone 
bearing a Latin inscription. Bones and ashes lay beneath it, and 
on every side the surface presented verdant patches of grass. It 
was examined by Sir Walter Scott, Dr John Leyden, Mungo Park, 
and others of antiquarian lore. From the rudeness and indistinct- 
ness of the carving upon the hard block, only the following charac- 
ters can be deciphered : hic memorise et hic iacent 

IN TVMVXO DVO FILII LIBERALI.f 

On Dryhope Haugh, there stood a large cairn called Herton's 
Hill, in the midst of which, when the stones were removed about thirty 
years ago, to enclose the surrounding fields, some urns were found, 
besides a coffin formed of slabs, and containing ashes. There may 
still be seen to the westward of Altrive Lake, on rising knolls, 
five considerable tumuli, probably remains of the ancient Britons. 
None of them have been opened; but the surface of the largest 
exhibits a mixture of charcoal and ashes. Its top was surrounded 
by a circle of stones thirty yards in circumference, with a small 
square of stones in the centre that were taken away to build dikes ; 
a purpose, to which also feudal castles and sepulchral cairns have 
been so often applied. " To what base uses we may return, 
Horatio " 

" To this Sir W. Scott latterly believed the ballad to refer, in which case the stones 
must commemorate a different event, as Deuchar Swire is at a considerable distance. 

f Dr Leyden was disposed to regard it as a relic of the Romans. Such an intro- 
1 iction, however, as lite mcmorUc is foreign to the Latin idiom ; and hicjacent are 
words, which, if they do occur in a genuine prose antique, Bis Manibus Sacrum or 
J. M. S. being almost universal, are at least so rare as to justify a suspicion that the 
stone where they are found is of Christian inscription. Neither does the material, 
which is unhewn greytvacke, seem to smack of classical antiquity. The altars, mile- 
stones, &amp;c. excavated along the line of Adrian's wall, are uniformly of sandntonc, and 
in places where it must have been far transported.

It would appear from the very large average of births registered 
for the ten years previous to 1700, that the number of inhabitant - 
was then much greater than at present. According to well au- 
thenticated testimony, corroborated by the numerous remains of 
old houses, a similar statement is applicable to the middle of last 
century, so that in all probability Dr Webster's report was far 
too low. The depopulation which afterwards began to take place, 
must doubtless be attributed to the monopoly of farms, the num- 
ber of cottagers being limited by the necessary purposes of hus- 
bandry, and the removal of the inhabitants to towns or manufac- 
turing districts. Of late there has also been a considerable emi- 
gration to America. But, notwithstanding, the population has 
remained nearly stationary for the last forty years, which has been 
owing chiefly to the compensation arising from two farms having 
been parcelled out among many small feuars. 

The yearly average of births  for the last seven years was 33 ; 
of deaths, 23; of marriages, 11. Number of inhabitants in villages, 
138; in the country, 1083. Number of resident families of inde - 
pendent fortune, 1 ; of proprietors of land of the yearly value of 
L. 50 and upwards, 1 1 ; of unmarried men bachelors and widowers 
upwards of fifty years of age, 33 ; of unmarried women upwards 
of forty-five, 72 ; of families, 227 ; of children at an average in 
each family, 5 ; of persons insane, 1 ; slightly fatuous, 3 ; blind, 
2. The number of persons employed in agriculture as occupiers 
or labourers is 169 ; in manufactures, retail trade, and handicraft, 
52 ; of professional and other educated men, 5 ; of labourers not 
agricultural, 71. 

It may be remarked that the shepherd's plaid is a standing article 
of dress; but the wide blue bonnets and coarse homespun coats of 
former times are no longer to be seen. 

 The number of births, as stated above, is somewhat greater than the average in 
the parochial registers, as a few annually are not recorded. The number of deaths 
is the result of the most accurate estimate that can be made.

The Scots fir being formerly supposed peculiarly suited to this 
climate, small clumps of it were planted on many of the farms, but 
now with their branchless stems and tufted tops, only add to the 
barenness of the scene. Oak, ash, elm, beech, and plane, are the 
kinds, planted at present where the ground is dry ; with alder, 
birch, larch, spruce, and Scots fir, as nurses. The management, 
though in some places not very systematic, is allowed to be good. 
The indigenous wood consists of oak, cut down periodically for 
the sale of the bark, ash, elder, birch, elm, hazel, hawthorn, hag- 
berry, mountain-ash, &amp;c 

The average rent of arable land in the parish is 15s. per acre ; 
of grazing, L.5 per cow; of pasturing, from 4s. 6d. to 5s. per 
sheep. The rental of the parish may be about L. 12,000. Farm 
servants with families have, in lieu of maintenance, three loads 
of meal, the produce of a cow, and a quantity of potatoes ; be- 
sides which, ploughmen receive on an average L. 9, and shep- 
herds the keeping of 45 sheep, equivalent generally to L. 18. 
The yearly wages of female servants vary from L. 5 to L. 7, exclu- 
sive of their board. Country artisans, as masons, carpenters, and 
smiths, make per day from 2s. to 2s. 4d. ; common labourers, as 
roadmen, Is. 8d. From the records of a society, it appears that 
the average price of wool and sheep in Selkirk county, from 1826 
to 1831 inclusive, has been as follows: — Cheviot wool per stone 
of 24 lb. English, smeared with tar, 10s. 7d.; do. smeared with 
turpentine, 14s. 2d.; do. white or unsmeared, 17s. Id.; stock 
wether hogs unclipt, 12s. 9d. ; stock ewe hogs unclipt, 14s. 2d. ; ewe 
hogs sold at market, lis. 3d.; top wether lambs, 6s. 6d.; second 
ewe and wether lambs, 5s. 3d.; draft ewes, 12s. 8d. ; wethers un- 
clipt, 19s. 9d. ; wethers for turnip feeding, 20s. 6d. 

Breeds of Live Stock, fyc. — About the end of last century, t he 
black-faced breed of sheep was gradually supplanted by the Cheviot. 
The experiment commenced on the lower farms, but from attachment 
to established practice, and an idea that the lambs could not sustain 
ilu' cold or storms of spring, it, was slowly extended, till the rising 
value and demand for fine wool at length made it general. Of late

years, however, when former prices were no longer realized, th 
original race has been partially replaced. They are found to thrive 
best of any on exposed mossy lands, and in stormy seasons are by 
far the surest stock. There are now 1300 black-faced in the up- 
land parts of the parish, which are generally crossed with the Che- 
viot or Leicester breed. On some grassy farms, the Cheviot is in 
like manner crossed with the Leicester, which supplies the most 
valuable lamb for the butcher market. But in this case, when the 
stock is a stationary one, it is apt to degenerate, as second ewe lambs 
are bought in annually in place of the draft ewes, so that this sys- 
tem succeeds best when a flying stock i. e. one changed every year, 
is kept, and this can be done only on enclosed farms. Some store- 
masters let their flocks go unsmeared, others use turpentine and 
different salves, while many retain the old Scottish preference for 
tarry wool. The lambs are now generally three weeks later in being 
sold than they were thirty years since. It has been said that they are 
later in being fit for sale, owing to the less nutritious grasses pro- 
duced by over-draining and mole-catching. But the circumstance, 
it would appear, arises chiefly from the market being first supplied 
with park lambs of finer breed and faster growth, and from the dis- 
continuance of ewe-milking, which made an early sale matter of 
necessity. Great attention has lately been paid to the improvement 
of stock, as far as breeding, pasture, shelter, and shifting are con- 
cerned. The cattle kept for domestic purposes were formerly a coarse 
kind of the Dutch breed. The Ayrshire breed was afterwards 
partially introduced, and latterly the principal attention has been 
directed to the short-horned breed,— a mongrel kind of which is 
now the prevailing stock. They are more readily purchased for 
feeding, and a considerable number is annually reared. The dairy, 
indeed, has not been better replenished, but this is an object of 
minor importance. A number of Highland cattle also is grazed 
on the hills. Where the pastures are coarse, since the complete 
draining of the bogs, they consume what the sheep would not 
eat, and must be left to lodge; and besides, as a new sward soon 
springs up, provision is at the same time made for keeping more 
sheep than before. 

Husbandry and Produce.— The extent of land that had once been 
cultivated is very great. Many spots, on which are gathered heaps 
of stones, seem to have been tilled with mattocks, and formed oases 
in the midst of the forest. The traces of the plough are also vi- 
sible far up the hill sides, which have returned to their natural stale. 



Y AH HOW. 



51 



Some waste land has lately been reclaimed, bnt little more could be 
done in this way with any profitable application of capital, owing to 
the dampness, of the climate, and distance from lime. Indeed, in the 
higher district, much at present under crop might be better laid out 
in permanent pasture, were it not that the farmer must keep a pair 
of horses to drive his fuel and hay. The turnip husbandry is pur- 
sued ; the rotation being the four or five shift. Though in late sea- 
sons there is a greater luxuriance of straw than grain, the crops in 
general are sufficiently ripened ; and winter wheat, which is occa- 
sionally sown, seldom fails to be productive, and of excellent quality. 
The turnips are often nearly destroyed by the disease called finger- 
and-toe, against which bone dust seems to be the best preventive. 

Draining has been much practised in our bogs, and perhaps car- 
ried too far, especially on clay soils. At first, no doubt, it has a 
considerable effect in improving them, but if the drains are kept 
open, the ground will, in eight or ten years, be overrun with Aira 
caspitosa and Agrostida. It is a common observation, that during 
the last twenty years the pastures have become much coarser. Va- 
rious remedies have been resorted to ; — in some cases the drains 
being stopped altogether, and in others allowed to fill up a little 
before a second, but particularly before a third or fourth cleaning. 
For real improvement, it accords with the experience of practical 
fanners to drain closely on mossy bogs, more sparingly on stiff clay, 
and merely to take off the surface water on thin ground covered with 
bent or coarse grass. Irrigation, so much in vogue about the begin- 
ning of this century, has, like all experiments begun without attend- 
ing to local circumstances, been nearly laid aside. The Yarrow is 
too pure for this purpose, leaving the richer particles in the loch 
whence it flows. The water, when first applied to a meadow, tends 
greatly to eradicate the fog, and decompose the half-decayed roots 
and leaves, and will, therefore, for some time, act as a stimulus with 
seeming advantage. But when the meadow is annually mowed 
without an occasional top-dressing, or where there is no extraneous 
matter in the irrigating stream, the system will in the end pro- 
duce, as it has done here, comparative or complete exhaustion. 
Substantial farm-houses with suitable offices are built almost every- 
where, and the farm-servants accommodated with comfortable cot- 
tages. Pretty good slate may be obtained in various parts, but no 
quarries have been regularly wrought. All the arable land, and 
some of the sheep walks, are enclosed. 

The duration of the leases on the Duke of Buccleuch's estate is 



52 



SELKIRKSHIRE. 



only nine years. His fauns are never advertised, and the occupiers 
rarely removed; so that this cannot be considered any great draw- 
back in a district chiefly pastoral. Some of the other land-owners 
grant leases of nineteen years. On Lord Napier's property, the 
rents are paid according to the price of the three leading articles, — 
wool, top wether lambs, and draft ewes, — having a reference to the 
sales of a particular farm. There are restrictions, however, in many 
of the leases, which more than their shortness form an obstacle to 
improvement. Such»is the clause that prohibits moor-burning, with 
a view of protecting the game. It is only in its young state that 
heath is loaded with a profusion of palatable shoots, suited for the 
feeding of sheep. This is the kind, too, which grouse uniformly 
prefer in the morning and evening twilight, when they eat with the 
greatest avidity, requiring the strong bushy parts merely for cover 
and breeding. Let the old heath then be burnt in successive 
patches, and the common interest of landlord and tenant would be 
enhanced by a provision both for the feathered and woolly tribes. 
In many leases also, there is an obligation to catch the moles. Se- 
veral of the store-masters and most of the shepherds are opposed 
to the practice, especially on strong grassy land. Since the long 
proscription thus instituted, the ground, it is said, has been over- 
grown with harsher grasses or insipid fog, and the pining in con- 
sequence introduced. But the mole, by raising its hillocks, which 
are spread either by the sheep or manual labour, and thus supply- 
ing an annual top-dressing, imparts a richness and variety to the 
pasture. As the practice of extermination is, to say the least of it, 
of doubtful utility, the farmer should be left to the exercise of his 
own self-interest and discretion. 

Agriculture suffers in some measure from the want of well-timed 
embanking. More march fences between different farms are requir- 
ed ; and in some upland places, a few enclosures, with better pas- 
ture than the rest for such of the stock as are not thriving, would 
be a decided advantage. So would enclosed clumps of plantation 
generally, upon the hills ; they would beautify the country, ame- 
liorate the climate, furnish fuel from their thinnings, and give ad- 
ditional shelter and value to the sheep-walks. The greatest ob- 
stacle to improvement is the distance from coal, lime, some kinds 
of manure, and markets. 

While too little encouragement has been given by proprietors, 
the influence of a local institution has been considerable and ex- 
tensive. The Pastoral Society of Selkirkshire was established in 



YAH ROW.

1819, under the patronage and through the patriotic exertions of 
the Right Honourable Lord Napier. It meets yearly; but in this 
parish the meetings are only triennial. Besides occasional grants 
of money from the Highland Society, it has expended considerable 
sums for bettering the breeds of Cheviot and black-faced sheep, 
horses, and cattle. Nor have the humble followers of the flock 
been forgotten, as premiums are also given for dexterity in sheep - 
shearing. 

The average gross amount and value of raw produce raised

Means of Communication, 8fc. — There is no market town in the 
parish; and the nearest is Selkirk, nine miles distant from the church. 
The only villages are Yarrow-Ford and Ettrick-Bridge, which 
are but small. The roads are excellent, being made and kept in 
repair by a contribution on the part of the landlords and tenants, 
levied in lieu of statute-labour. Along each of the rivers Ettrick 
and Yarrow runs a line of road — two cross roads between them, 
another leading to Tweedside, besides a small portion in detached 
corners ; which in all extend to a length of thirty-seven miles. 
There is also a rough tract over Minchmoor, which was long I he 
mail road from the south; it was the route that Montrose took after 
his defeat at Pliiliphaugh, and is still the line of march for troops. 
We have three bridges across the rivers ; one of which being old 
and ill-constructed, another is about to be built in ils vicinity. 

Ecclesiastical State. — This parish formerly embraced the pa-

rish of Buccleuch, which was annexed to Ettrick, and some farms 
north of the Tweed, annexed to Innerleithen in 1650 ; the great 
extent of Yarrow being the principal reason of their disjunction 
from it. The church is ten miles distant from the extremities of 
the parish ; but the situation is centrical. It appears to have been 
built in the year 1640. It was put into a state of very complete 
repair in 1826, and affords accommodation for 500 persons. The 
sittings are divided among the heritors according to their valua- 
tions, and by them among their tenantry. The manse was erected 
in 1811. It is singular that the glebe lies eight miles to the west ; 
it is on the side of the loch, and' is the same that was attached to 
St Mary's Chapel, no excamb having ever taken place. The 
original boundaries are forgotten ; but it is altogether hill pasture, 
and will support sixteen soomes of '. e. 160 sheep. The an- 
nual value of the glebe is L. 32, 16s. ; allowance for grass glebe, 
L. 20 Scots, or L. 1, 13s. 4d. ; communion element money, L. 8, 
6s. 8d. ; and the stipend in victual, sixteen chalders, equal to 186 
quarters, 3 bushels, and 1 £ gallon imperial ; or in money, on an 
average of prices for the last seven years, L.259, 6s. 5d. The 
old valued rental of the parish amounts to L. 31,377, 9s. 8d. 
Scots. The deans of the Chapel Royal are titulars of the teinds, 
and generally take a grassum for nineteen years. His Grace the 
Duke of Buccleuch is tacksman, paying a small annual rent. The 
numbers belonging to the Established Church are, of families 210, 
and individuals 1161 ; to the Dissenters, families 17, and indivi- 
duals 60. The average number of communicants at the Esta- 
blished Church is 330, and divine service is generally well attended. 

Two societies for religious purposes are established. " The 
Yarrow Parish Bible, Missionary, and Jewish Society," has an 
annual collection at the church doors, averaging L. 12. There 
is also a Missionary Society at Redfordgreen ; the members belong- 
to the parishes of Yarrow, Ettrick, and Roberton, and the yearly 
contributions vary from L. 6 to L. 10. 

Education and Literature. — The total number of schools is 
four ; of which two are parochial, and the other two supported by 
subscription of individuals. Beside the usual branches of instruction, 
Latin and geometry are occasionally taught. A large and hand- 
some new school-house was built at Yarrow in 1830. It is now in 
excellent order. The schoolmaster's house has been long a great re- 
sort for boarders, to the number frequently of twenty-five ; the board 
being moderate, and the situation particularly healthy- The paro-

chial teachers have the legal accommodations, with the maximum of 
salary between them; of which L. 31, 6s. 6|d. is allotted to the 
school at Yarrow, and L.20 to that at Ettrickbridge ; the fees at 
the former amounting to about L. 10 per annum; and to L.12 at 
the latter. The general expence of education per annum, may be 
rated at from 8s. to 12s., exclusive of books and stationary. One of 
the private schools is particularly necessary to accommodate the 
families in the uplands of Yarrow, and were well worthy of aid from 
those proprietors whose estates are contiguous. There are still two 
points in the parish, Ashiesteel and Redfordgreen, so remote from 
the existing schools, as to prevent attendance on any of them,— 
being five miles across the hills from the nearest. The popula- 
tion around each of these points does not, however, exceed seventy 
individuals. There is also a Sabbath school at Ettrickbridge. 

Libraries. — A circulating library is established in the parish ; 
while many of the farmers and others are connected with those in 
Selkirk. A few years ago, the shepherds had a Debating Society 
among themselves, which, owing to their distance from one another, 
has been discontinued. 

Savhiffs Bank. — A savings bank was established at Selkirk in 
1815, of which a branch exists in Yarrow. At present the amount 
of money belonging to the parish in the treasurer's hands is L. 120 ; 
and on an average of the last seven years, L. 29 has been annually 
lodged, and L. 37 withdrawn. The investments are usually made 
by servants, of whom the greater part are females. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The poor are supported chiefly 
by legal assessment, that method having been introduced in 1751. 
Some parts of its progress may be noticed.

The cases of the poor who are maintained at their own houses, 
are considered twice in the year. The usual allowance for each 
child is Is. and each aged pauper 2s. 6d. per week. The average of 
church collections expended in gratuities, education, &amp;c. is L. 10 ; 
donations and legacies, L. 4. It appears that, shortly after the 
introduction of the poor's rate, the numbers on the list had attained 



56 



SELKIRKSHIRE. 



their maximum, till the scarce and dear years at the beginning of 
this century. It appears, too, that pauperism has not made much 
progress, there being nearly as many persons on the roll, and as much 
allotted to each allowing for the difference of the value of money 
at first as at present. The tendency of the system, however, has 
been partially felt in relaxing industry, and encouraging improvi- 
dence, — in loosening the ties of the nearest kindred, and lowering 
the tone of independence, — and leading to insolence or ingratitude. 
It is not therefore, from the principle of the system, that no great 
evil has arisen but from the countervailing checks, — the aversion of 
farmers to have more, cottagers than what are necessary for their hus- 
bandry, together with the strict economy and surveillance exercised 
by the managers of the poors' funds. Those on the list are chiefly 
old women, widows with young helpless families, and persons weak 
in body or intellect. There were several individuals on it lately at 
the age of 93. 

Inns. — Three alehouses are kept in the parish, which are abso- 
lutely necessary for the accommodation of travellers, but somewhat 
demoralizing within a certain sphere. 

Fuel. — Heath, turf, and wood, are burnt by the peasantry, but 
in small quantities, for coal and peat are the fuel principally 
used. Coal is brought from the pits in Mid- Lothian, a distance, 
on an average, of thirty miles, so that on arriving here, it can- 
not be rated lower than Is. 3d. a hundredweight. A mode of im- 
proving peat as fuel, by compression, has lately been introduced by 
an ingenious gentleman of this parish, Mr Walter Tod, Langhope. 
From his experiments it appeared, that, by taking an equal weight of 
each, this preparation, compared with the best coal, burnt as long, 
and gave six degrees.more of heat. Compared with the original peat, 
it lasted double the time, and raised the thermometer fourteen de- 
grees higher. By this means, also, fuel can be secured in rainy 
seasons, and at any leisure time before frost sets in, so that it is to 
be hoped the improvement will soon become general. 

VI. — Miscellaneous Observations. 

A very considerable change has taken place in the husbandry , 
habits, and household economy of the people in this parish, since 

 Its importance, however, will be still greater in the arts, especially the melting 
of metals. The various specimens we have seen are beautifully black and com- 
pact, and the expence of preparation is trifling ; but for a description of the process 
itself, we must refer to Mr Tod's Prize Essay in Trans, of Highland Society for 1832.

the date of the last Statistical Account. The Cheviot have super- 
seded the black-faced sheep ; and, with the breed, the manage- 
ment has been materially altered. There is no ewe-milking as 
formerly, and no hog hirsel kept, but the different parts of the 
stock roam promiscuously and at large. In very severe snow-storms 
the flocks on the higher grounds used to be removed to the low 
country of Annandale in quest of food, but now a store of hay is 
cut from the bogs, and forms ample winter provision for the sheep 
during any storm ; while stells, or enclosures for sheep, at the same 
time, are more numerous and accessible. Within the last forty 
years, too, the country has been thoroughly drained. Equally 
great have been the improvements in the agriculture of the parish. 
The system of having outfield and infield was long practised ; the 
milk ewes and cattle being folded at night, and the ground thus 
manured for cultivation. Cropping, too, went on till the particular 
spot was exhausted. But now a better system prevails, the arable 
and meadow land being enclosed and subdivided, — the two-horse 
plough used, — turnip husbandry introduced, — a regular rotation of 
cropping followed, — and wheat, so long deemed unsuited to our 
soil and climate, frequently raised with success. During the same 
period, however, the principle of non-residence has been largely 
acted on ; and out of forty-five farms in the parish, twenty are led 
farms. On many of these were formerly large families, with ser- 
vants and cottagers, and there are five such lying adjacent, — a state 
of things the more to be regretted, when its only advantage is a 
trifling addition of rent, and the saving of outlay on farm buildings. 

The new houses of the tenants have for the most part been built 
in better style and situations than the old, which were small 
thatched cottages, placed generally on some sloping bank, or 
up some secluded burn, where security was sought in marauding 
times. The roads also have been greatly improved, and are 
far more frequented. Besides, all classes are better fed and 
clad. The dress is no longer of home produce or manufacture. 
What used to be the luxuries have become the necessaries of 
life, so that, instead of a single carrier on foot as formerly, a 
number of carts supply the Yarrow vale with wheaten bread. A 
solitary newspaper formerly made its passage up the water by 
slow stages and through many hands, contrasting forcibly with the 
regular and rapid circulation of periodicals at present. Withal, 
there 1ms been a striking change in the habits of the peasantry. 
Local attachments have given way to general knowledge. The

legends of superstition are in a great measure forgotten, and it's 
rites forsaken. There is no longer " heard a lilting at the ewes' 
milking," or " The tales at the farmer's ingle." The minstrel's 
strains, however, had lingered long after the deeds which .they com- 
memorated were over. In this pastoral district it was that Sir 
Walter Scott found many of the old ballads which had been handed 
down for ages as a patrimony from sire to son. But, on the pub- 
lication of his " Minstrelsy," the spell that bound them was broken ; 
and these relics of Border song, thus laid bare to the light of day, 
have, like the friendly and familiar spirits of Border superstition, 
on being noticed with peculiar kindness, entirely disappeared, and 
that, too, in consequence of the very effort made to preserve them. 
In this district, too, there existed almost a feudal relation between 
master and servant; there being instances in which the domestic has 
grown up and grown grey beneath the same roof ; but now the half- 
yearly term is too often one of change, and the stipulated sendee 
performed with mechanical unconcern. 

The capabilities of improvement in this parish have been for the 
most part suggested in the course of the preceding account. It may 
only now be noticed, that there is still room for one or two more 
bridges and for additional roads, communicating with Tweed-side and 
along the south bank of the rivers, or at least leading to the farm- 
houses placed there. And farther, were the parish of Meggat dis- 
joined from Lyne, the adjacent parts of Ettrick and Yarrow an- 
nexed to it, and a clergyman regularly to reside, this would prove 
highly beneficial to the people of that sequestered district, and ex- 
tend the ministrations of an establishment by which, pre-eminently, 
" the gospel is preached to the poor."

PRESBYTERY OF SELKIRK, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TEVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. JAMES SMITH, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, c. — In a charter of Alexander II. to the monks of 
Kelso, the Ettrick of Selkirkshire is repeatedly mentioned by the 
various names of " Ettric and Ethyric." The name is] of doubtful 
origin. " Eitrigh in Gaelic signifies a furrow or trench. Eithrach 
in the same language means a wilderness." Again, the Ed of the 
language of the British Aborigenes signifies a current, and Terig, 
mud ; both names being characteristic of this river when its waters 
are raised  and agitated by the mountain-torrents. 

In the last Statistical Account, the parish has been described as 
being at an average ten miles long by ten broad ; but in a late sur- 
vey published by Oliver and Boyd 1829 its area in square miles 
has been stated at 68.69 miles or 43,968 imperial acres. It is 
bounded on the north by the parish of Yarrow, and touched by 
Meggat in Peebles-shire; south and west by the Parishes of Moffat 
and Eskdalemuir in Dumfries-shire ; and on the east, by a part of 
Yarrow and Roberton. Its surface is hilly and mountainous. The 
hills are beautifully rounded, and are almost all covered with rich green 
grass from top to bottom : Two or three indeed are spotted with 
heath, which only adds by its variety to the beauty of the scenery. 

» MrJames Hogg, in his Statistics of Selkirkshire, published in the 181. number of 
the Quarterly Journal of Agriculture, says, « In old deeds and charters it is first found 
written Altcrick, then Attcrick and finally Etterick. Atterick is really as good 
Gaelic as a borderer could spell. Alterick signifies the rising stream, or stream of the 
rapid ascent."

Hydrograjriiy. — The Loch of the Lowes spreads itself at the 
northern boundary of the parish, through which the drain-like 
stream which forms the Yarrow makes its way. This lake is far 
inferior to St Mary's, which is only separated from it by a very 
narrow neck of land ; St Mary's being about three miles long, half 
a mile broad, and from twenty-eight to thirty fathoms deep, while 
the Lowes is only one mile long, a quarter of a mile broad, and 
about twelve fathoms in depth. The Ettrick, on the south side of 
a range of hills, called, " the back-bone of the country," rises from 
among a few rushes between Loch-fell and Capel-fell, two miles 
above Potburn, said to be the highest farm-house above the level 

 It is supposed that these elevations of the hills, as taken from the county map, 
arc somewhat less than their actual height above the level of the sea.

of the sea in the south of Scotland. It is fed by many a little rag- 
mo mountain-torrent. When it is small, and viewed from the top 
of the hills in a fine sunny day, it is like a thread of silver; but 
when raised by the storms and the rain, it bids defiance to all its 
banks, and sweeps over the adjoining haughs with the raging fury 
of a " mountain sea." After a course of about thirty miles N. E., 
the Ettrick loses itself in the Tweed, between Sunderland Hall and 
Abbotsford. Timah, a small rivulet, rises on the heights between 
the parishes of Eskdalemuir and Ettrick, which, after a course of 
about six miles in nearly a northern direction, falls into the Ettrick 
at Ramsay-cleugh, about a mile below the kirk. Rankle-burn, 
another stream, rises also between the parishes of Ettrick and 
Eskdalemuir. It is celebrated by the song of the maid of Rankle- 
burn, and bv tradition, for being the place where the ancient pro- 
genitors of the family of Buccleuch first took up their residence : 
Satchells.J After passing in a direction similar to the Timah, 
it falls into the Ettrick, opposite to the old grey dingy ruins of 
the tower of Tushielaw. 

Geology. — The stratification of the range of hills in this dis- 
trict runs in general from S. W. to N. E. with a variety of 
dips. The rocks are of the transition series. It is wholly 
schistose, consisting of greywacke and clay-slate. The hills 
are therefore of a rounded form, and indicate the formation to 
which they belong. There are no interesting fossils or minerals 
found in the country. A piece of antimony glance was picked up 
in the channel of a little burn near the source of the Ettrick, 
some time ago, but though considerable search has been made 
since, no more has yet been found. Iron pyrites has also been 
collected in the romantic linns of the Ettrick. At Meucra, near 
the Lochs, a black rock has been sometimes visited by the admirers 
of nature, which some have pronounced to be glossy alum slate ; it 
has the appearance of bone. Almost every kind of soil is to be met 
with here. But there is in general a deep moss on the top of the hills. 
This becomes by mixture of sand or gravel, mossy gravelly soil. 
There is often again a cold stiff clay on the sides, or near to the bot- 
tom of the hills ; this again by mixture of sand or gravel, forms a 
new and different kind of bed for the plants and grasses. But the 
haughs on the sides of the river are in general of a fine alluvial soil, 
washed from the hills and formed on the banks. The soil, indeed, 
of whatever kind, is in general good, and would bear crops of wheat , 



G2 



SELKIRKSHIRE. 



but the climate being cold, damp, and late, we could not expect 
it to ripen ; therefore no such crop is ever attempted to be raised. 

Zoology.— It may be noticed under this head, that till of late we 
have been but little visited by small birds of the singing kind. Now, 
among the young plantations, we hear the blackbird and the thrush, 
and a nameless train vieing with their notes to outdo the laverock, 
the ancient songster of the forest. And we may add that the words 
of Wordsworth are sometimes no fiction. 

" The swans on sweet St Mary's lake, 
Float double, swan and shadow." 

Sea-trout and salmon, when the rivers are flooded in the winter 
season, make an excursion up the Ettrick, the Timah, and Rankle- 
burn, and they often even find their way into some of the smaller 
tributaries. But trout, perch, and pike, are the only natural and 
permanent inhabitants of all our waters. 

Botany. — Though the country be alpine, we have not discover- 
ed any rare alpine plants in it. Among the long grass interspersed 
with spretts may be seen the orchis in many of its beautiful varie- 
ties ; the meadow cardamine  Cardamine pratensis J, with its lovely 
lilac petals ; and among marshes, the white Parnassian grass  Par- 
nassia palustris J, and butter plant  Pinguicula vulgaris . The plants 
of Eriophorum  Eriophorum vaginatum J or cotton-grass, in the mos- 
ses or among the black bent, or heath, are like so many little tufts of 
cotton waving in the breeze, or sparkling in the sun. The luck- 
en-gowan,  Trollius Europmus , is met with also very frequently 
among the meadow grounds, or the low sloping sides of the hills. 
And the cloud-berry,  Rubus chamcemorusj, is gathered on some 
of the mountain tops. These are samples of the Flowers of the 
Forest. 

The grasses found here, as connected with soil, and with the 
feeding of the flocks, are more interesting, as they are more useful. 
Deer-hair,  Scirpus ccespitosus J, is generally found on a thin mossy 
soil, mixed with heath ; it is only of service for summer pasture. 
Stool bent,  Juncus squarrosus J, rises where there is a consider- 
able mixture of sand with the soil ; this is an evergreen, and is 
preferable to the deer-hair. It has been called " an excellent 
bait," being a hardy perennial. White bent, Nardus striata J, 
and flying bent,  Aira cceridea J, are also less valuable, being less 
durable, living and dying in autumn with the deer-hair, and leav- 
ing a whiteness on the hills like the decay of winter, and straw-

like rustling leaves, ever borne and wafted by the wind in gusts 
among the lulls. But of the three following, we believe, the shep- 
herd would say, we could scarcely speak too highly. 1. Eriophorum 
vaginatum, which in its youngest state is called moss-crops, is 
greedily pulled up by the sheep ; in a farther advanced state it is 
"ailed ling or laing. This, to speak in the words of one who has 
long observed its advantages, is a very valuable spring pasture ; it 
is a hardy perennial, and affords a grateful and nourishing food. 
2. Sesleria carulea, blue moor-grass, or pry, is also a hardy 
perennial. It resists the severity of the winter. It remains green 
through the spring months, and is one of the most valuable of all our 
mountain grasses. 3. Juncus acutiflorus, sprett, is very abundant 
among the hills. It grows most luxuriantly on a wettish soil. While 
it serves for pasture, it is chiefly cut for hay, during the autumnal 
months ; and, while it is very serviceable for the black cattle during 
the winter, a portion of it is usually kept for the sheep, in case 
of a " lying storm."  

The name Forest, implies that the district was once " the land 
of trees." But the freebooters and moss-troopers in the time of 
James IV. cut and destroyed many of them, and even John Mur- 
ray, the Sheriff of Selkirkshire, who should have protected the 
rights of his royal master, has his name enrolled among the num- 
ber of the delinquents. At last, James V. we are told, " showed 
a disposition to change the forest into what it now is, — a sheep-walk, 
by stocking a part of it with extensive flocks." There are now 
but few remains of the ancient forest. An old tree may be seen 
here and there, and sometimes a few together, to mark both the 
antiquity, and the natural features of the wood of the country. The 
kinds of the natural wood must have been very numerous. We 
have counted between twelve and fourteen in one wide cleugh alone. 
The prevailing, however, are the ash, the mountain-ash, the birch, 
the alder, the willow, the thorn, &amp;c. But while the natural wood 
is dwindling, decaying, and dying, several young plantations are 
rising, flourishing, and waving among our hills, and all seem to 
indicate that the forest can yet support and nourish them.

minister of the parish. He was educated at Selkirk school, and 
originally destined for the church. During the reign of George L 
he was appointed Minister to the State of Venice, and retained his 
functions from 1715 to 1720. Long after his death his Latin his- 
tory came into the possession of Dr Hollingberry, Archdeacon of

In an old house at Ettrick Hall, about a quarter of a mile from

In this parish the truly patriotic and benevolent Lord Napier has

Napier," to use the words of a popular writer, " has, for some years 
past, employed his time and talents, together with much money, in 
improving the stock on the hills, and introducing into a district, hi- 
therto bound up in its own natural wildness, all the attributes and 
amenities proper to the most civilized regions." — " His enthusiasm 
has been one of benevolence, and from the full half of the beautiful 
cottages he has planted in this wilderness, the prayers of the widow 
and the orphan nightly ascend to Heaven in his behalf." 

In this parish rest the remains of the Reverend Thomas Boston, 
sometime its minister. On his monument, on a white marble ta- 
blet, is the following inscription :— " As a testimony of esteem for 
the Reverend Thomas Boston Senior, whose private character was 
highly respectable ; whose public labours were blessed to many ; 
and whose valuable writings have contributed much to promote the 
advancement of vital Christianity, this monument by the permis- 
sion of relatives is erected by a religious and grateful public, A. D. 
1806. He was born at Dunse March 17, 1676.' Ordained to 
the pastoral charge of Simprim September 21, 1699; removed

from thence to Ettrick, May 1, 1707; and died May 20, 1732, 
leaving a widow and four children." 

Land-oioners. — The following noblemen and gentlemen are the 
chief proprietors and land-owners at present. His Grace the Duke of 
Buccleuch and Queensberry, proprietor of Buccleuch Easter and 
Wester, Anelshope, Crosslee, Deephope, Gair, and Roplaw Shiel. 
The right Honourable Lord Napier of Thirlstane, Gamescleugh, 
Scabcleugh, and Craighill. The Reverend T. G. Torry Anderson 
of Tushielaw and Cacrabank, &amp;c. 

Parochial Register. — The parish register of Ettrick commences 
in 1693. The Reverend James M'Mihan stands on the first page 
surrounded with his twelve elders. Each of these elders had his 
proper district assigned him, and the religious duties pointed out 
which he was to perform. One part of the duty was, that " two 
should watch in their turn on the Sabbath, to see that none with- 
drew from public worship, and that there might be no disorder about 
the doors, &amp;c." The records during the ten years of Mr M' Mihan's 
incumbency are interesting. Four years after his translation to 
Hownam, Mr Boston was called to the parish. He has ranged the 
births and baptisms by themselves, — has kept a separate portion 
for proclamations and marriages, — and we have his thickly written 
quarto — " the book of discipline." The records show he was a dis- 
ciplinarian indeed. -}- 

Antiquities, Sec. — This parish has been sometimes called the unit- 
ed parishes of Ettrick and Buccleuch. If we were to take the ex- 
tent of territory, indeed, belonging to the Buccleuch portion as a 
reason for entitling it to the name of parish, these lands are together 
as extensive as the lands of ancient Ettrick ; but, in " a decreet of 
disjunction of certain lands viz. the lands of Deepup, Mount com- 
mon, Gemmelscleuch, Ettrick-side, Anelshope, Buccleuches Easter 
and Wester, Tushielaw, Cacrabank and the Corslies, from the 

 Something of the history of the people and the times may be gleaned from the 
records. At one time we find him with the greatest difficulty obtaining heather, thack, 
and divots, to keep the kirk and manse in repair ; at another he is seen " scraping" for 
the poor ; and anon making collections for the Bursars, — for the captives of Barbary, — 
for the harbour of Cullen,— for the bridges of Lanark and Melrose,— for the Church of 
Holland, &amp;c. We read also that Tushielaw should buy a mort-cloth with the collec- 
tion made at the sacrament,— and " speak for a bell if it be cheap." 

-j- The registration of baptisms is regularly kept, as far we have been able to learn, 
from 1693 to 1711. But there is a blank between 1711 and 1725, which we cannot ac- 
count for ; the baptisms of 1725 being immediately after the baptisms of 1711 in the 
same volume. This may be one reason why there has been in a certain quarter, and 
still is, and may yet be, much fruitless litigation

parish of Yara and annexation of the same to the parish of Ettrick, 
dated 28th May 1650, we find the following reasons for their dis- 
union from the one, and for their annexation to the other; these 
lands were" lyantfar distant from their auinparoch kirk," they were 
therefore annexed to Ettrick " quharunto they ly mair eioest." 

Buccleuch. — In the lonely vale of Rankle-burn, surrounded by 
a dense mass of hills, are the two forlorn farm-steadings of the 
Buccleuchs. A deep ravine, near the road leading from them 
to Hawick, is pointed out as the place where the buck was slain, 
and which gave, according to tradition, their name and title to the 
family of Buccleuch. Let the limping lines of old Satchels carry 
us thither. 

" Good Lancelot Scot, I think liis book be true, 
Old Rankle-burn is designed Buccleuch now ; 
Yet in his book no balls read he, 
It was buck's cleuch, he read to me ; 
He told me the name, the place, the spot, 
Came all by the hunting of the buck. 
In Scotland no Buccleuch was then. 
Before the buck in the cleuch was slain." 

A small crook, in the steepest part of the cleuch, about half-way 
between the east-house and the mill-dam-ford, which is a pool or 
ford on the Hawick road, is pointed out as the place where the 
buck was taken ; but, if Satchels be correct, it was not here the 
buck was slain, for he says, 

" The very place where the buck was slain, 
He built a stone house, and there he did remain." 

Now the foundations of such a house, as we might conceive it 
should be, were dug up between three and four years ago, and up - 
on the spot has been built, within these twelve months past, the 
farm-house of Easter Buccleuch.  In the buck's cleuch are the 
marks of the site of an old mill. 

" For they built a mill on that same burn, 
To grind dog's bran, tho' there grew no corn." 

Fifty years ago, the walls of this mill were "knee high ;" now they 

 " There are no vestiges of any building at Buccleuch, except the site of a cha- 
pel, &amp;c." says Sir Walter Scott in his notes to the Lay of the Last Minstrel ; and all 
the' writers we have seen giving a description of this ancient and famed spot, use near- 
ly the same language. But we are inclined to think that the family of Buccleuch 
had once a baronial residence here." See in the Notes to the Lay of the Last Min- 
strel, an account of this spot written by the person who dug up ho foundations.

are only a rude outline, being a very little above the ground, over- 
grown with moss. About a Scotch mile above the farm-steading, 
and close on the Rankle-burn, is to be seen the lonely spot on 
which once stood the noted kirk or chapel of Buccleuch. There 
is  till here to be seen the feeble outline of the old wall, with the 
kirk-yard dike ; and around the whole is the crumbling form of a 
stell or fa/dd, for the sheep on the farm at certain seasons. The 
marks where houses seem to have stood, are still visible on the 
burn side. 

Tushielaio. — Passing from Buccleuch, we come upon the gray 
ruins of the tower of Tushielaw, on the side of a hill near the road 
on the Ettrick, which seem to request a moment's inspection. It 
is not easy to say whether it is more famous in song, in tradition, 
or in the realities connected with its history. A powerful family 
of the name of Scott were once its inhabitants ; and they were not 
more powerful than famous, as freebooters and moss-troopers. In 
1502, " Patrick Turnbull, in Walchope, produced a remission 
for resetting, supplying, and intercommuning with Archibald and 
Ninian Armstrangis, and William Scott, son of David Scott of 
Tushielaw, in their stouthreifs, slaughters, burnings, and other 
crimes committed by them." And there is a famous tradition that 
Adam Scott, probably brother of the said William, commonly 
called the King of Thieves, on being taken by King James V. one 
morning before breakfast, was hung on an ash tree over his own 
gate ; along the principal branches of which it is said there are still 
to be seen the nicks and hollows formed by the ropes on which many 
an unhappy wight had been suspended by the rigorous and power- 
ful baron. It is to this noted chief of the border we find granted 
a " Remission for treasonably breaking prison, and his warde within 
the castle of Edinburge, apud Edinburge," November 28, 1505. 
Nearly twenty years after this, March 25, 1525, we stumble on 

" The tradition is undoubtedly incorrect. Adam Scot, called the King of Thieves, 
was tried, convicted, and beheaded, at Edinburgh, on the 18th May 1530. Pitcairn's 
Criminal Trials, vol. i. p. 145. The words of the record are as follows : " 1530, 
Maii 18. Adam Scot of Tuschelaw, convicted of art and part of theftously taking 
black mail from the time of his entry within the castle of Edinburgh, in ward, from 
John Brown in Hoprow ; and of art and part of theftously taking black mail from 
Andrew Thorbrand, and William his brother ; and for art and part of theftously tak- 
ing of black mail from the poor tenants of Hopecailzow ; and of art and part of theft- 
ously taking black mail from the tenants of Escheschcill. Beheaded. Juhaerfor 
the king caused hang the 18th May William Cockburn of Henderlande, and Adame 
Scott of Tuschelaw, thieves apprchendit in Edinburgh, to t'errifie otheris; — and they

his name among a list of border barons who agreed to assist the 
Earle of Angus to stanch thift, reiff, slaughter, &amp;c. &amp;c. 

Thirlstane. — About two miles above Tushielaw stands the old 
tower of Thirlstane surrounded by a few venerable ash trees. The 
young springing wood serves as a guard both for the old baronial 
castle and the lately erected seat of the family of Thirlstane. 

Gamescleuch. — On the opposite side of the Ettrick is to be seen 
a pretty distinct outline of the tower of Gamescleuch. In the genea- 
logy of Scott, &amp;c. in the possession of Lord Napier, it is said : 
" John Scott of Thirlestane married a daughter of Scott of Allan- 
haugh, by whom he had four sons, Robert, his heir, and Simon, 
called Long-spear, who was tutor of Thirlstane, and built the tower 
of Gamescleugh. 

Old Chapels, fyc. — Near the farm-house of Kirkhope, on the 
Ettrick, the place of an old kirk steading is still visited; its site is 
so coveied with grass and moss s however, that its dimensions are 
barely discernible. Near the farm-house of Chapelhope on 
the side of the lakes, is the place of the steading of another 
chapel. It is now grown over with moss, but the enclosure and form 
of the foundations of the chapel are still perfectly distinct. There 
is yet something like the appearance of the rows of graves ; and not 
many years back, some " muggers" deposited in these romantic 
and sequestered grounds the remains of one of their dead. 

There have no coins been dug up in the parish in so far as we 
know. An old tripod or urn, and two axiform stones, small toward 
the middle, probably used for the skinning of the red deer, were 
found some years ago, and are now in the possession of Lord Na- 
pier. The cane, and what is said to have been the small sword, 
of Boston, are still preserved in the parish. 

III. — Population. 
It appears from tradition, — from the amount of church collec- 
tions, from the number of paupers on the roll on the sessional re- 
cords, and from the number of small farms, with the farmers and 

their families residing on them, that the population 140 years ago 
must have been much greater than at present. The following is 
the state of the population subsequently.

The average of baptisms for these last four years, viz. from 1829 
to 1832, both inclusive, is 18; of marriages, 3; of deaths, 7. The 
number of families in the parish is 89. 

The number of persons employed in agriculture is 75 ; in ma- 
nufactures, retail trade, or handicraft, 24; of professional or other 
educated men, 4; of labourers not agricultural, 37. The only re- 
sident proprietor is Lord Napier. 

The people speak the dialect of the forest, which is simple and 
soft in its tones, and, we should think, rather agreeable to the ear of 
a stranger. They are a reading people, and well-informed on almost 
every subject. We can still trace amongst them the seeds of the 
gospel as sown here by the venerable Boston. They are quiet and 
inoffensive, and seem to cultivate all the dispositions which tend to 
peace and good agreement, to religion and morality. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy — The number of acres in the 
parish has been stated at 43,968. Of these about 217 are under 
the plough, and about 163 acres more might be profitably cultiva- 
ted. Above 270 are planted and beautified with thriving young 
wood. About 43,086 acres .are constantly waste, or in permanent 
pasture, whereof 120 are meadow. Hard and soft wood alike 
rejoice in the soil ; and were the lands only protected indeed from 
the flocks, we could almost believe " that every foot of ground 
would again spring up in natural wood." There are besides about 
2700 acres now enclosed. Of these there are one or more fields 
of greater or less extent on every farm. 

The parish consists of twenty-nine farms, there being no com- 
mon lands now. Of these, nine are only occupied by resident te- 
nants, the remaining twenty being led farms. Those tenants who 
do reside amongst us are mostly bachelors, — respectable in the 
world, — and as wealthy and well-doing as the pressure of these hard 
past times will admit. But the day seems coming when every 
farm must have its own tenant, with his growing and flourishing 
young family around him, like the shepherds and shepherdesses of 
our border legends. 

Rent of Land, 8fc— The hills and low lands taken together, 
though in general fertile and productive, as far as the climate will 
admit, and rich as pasture, yet, owing to the distance from mar-

kets, and to the nature and quality of the food required for 
the flocks, &amp;c. let at an average of from 2s. 6d. to 15s. an acre. 
A cow can be grazed for 40s. ; an ox for about 45s. ; and a sheep 
for 5s. through summer and winter ; the grazing of an ox being 
about nine times the annual grazing of one sheep. 

Breeds of Live Stock, 8fc. — " From the time of King James," 
says Mr Hogg in his Statistics of Selkirkshire, " down to the year 
1785, the black-faced, or forest breed, had continued to be the 
sole breed of sheep reared in the district, and happy had it been 
for the inhabitants had no other been introduced to this day. 
However, about that period, the farmers in the eastern division of 
the county began to introduce the Cheviot breed, which, for the 
space of ten years, continued to creep westward, by slow degrees, 
till the year 1796, when the demand for Cheviots began to in- 
crease so rapidly, and still to go on progressively, till it absolutely 
grew little better than the tulipo-mania that once seized on the 
Dutch." Ettrick had soon her complement of this new breed. 
They first appeared on the farm of Crosslee. Shortly after they 
were to be seen spreading and feeding on all our pastures ; and 
in spite of the indignation of the old shepherd at the rash conduct 
of his young master, the black-faced " ewie wi' the crooket horn" 
was banished entirely from her native hills. 

On two or three farms a few years back, the " old black-faced" 
had again made their appearance ; but they begin again to de- 
crease ; for they find they are only welcome where the " white- 
faced gentry" will not thrive. Notwithstanding the regrets of the 
" shepherd," therefore, we rather think the Cheviots will continue 
to be our permanent friends and favourites. The number of sheep, 
as near as we can guess, may be about 26,000. The cattle 
here are of inferior concern. The cows are generally short- 
horned, or of the Ayrshire breed. Highland kyloes are begin- 
ning to be introduced on two or three farms, to pasture among 
the flocks on the hills. The practice is most commendable. 
They feed on the leavings of the sheep. They bring the rough 
pasture to a bearing for producing a more plentiful crop of pas- 
ture-grass ; and a double advantage is gained, for a double crop 
is maintained and obtained, while the whole pasturage on which 
they feed is enriched, bettered, increased, and prepared for a 
plentiful revival on the following spring. The whole number of 
black cattle at Whitsunday 1832, was 389, and of horses 58.

yearly raised in the parish may be as follows:

Pastoral Society. — " To facilitate the improvement of live 
stock," says Mr Alexander Laidlaw, an observing and intelligent 
tanner, " the first pastoral society was instituted in 1818, by the 
cnterprizing exertions, and under the immediate patronage, of Lord 
Napier. It can now reckon amongst its members the greater 
part of the landed proprietors of the county, besides a good many 
patriotic gentlemen of the country. And it has not only been uni- 
formly supported by every respectable farmer in Selkirkshire, but 
also by many of that valuable class of men in Peebles, Roxburgh, 
and Dumfries-shires. This society not only stirs up a spirit of 
emulation among farmers in general, but serves also as a school 
where the young farmer will see the real and apparent properties 
of live stock pointed out by the judges, but also hear the relative 
advantages and disadvantages of almost every breed fearlessly dis- 
cussed at the annual general meeting." The society meets an- 
nually, and generally on the 18th June. The meetings are held 
at the three following places, viz. one year at Newark, near Sel- 
kirk ; another at Tinnies, in Yarrow ; and the third 'at Thirlstane 
fair grounds, in Ettrick.

Markets, Roads, 8fc. — The nearest market-town is Moffat, at the 
distance of sixteen miles. But Selkirk, the county town, about 
eighteen miles from Ettrick Kirk, and Hawick, about the same 
distance, are the chief marketing places. The post town is Sel- 
kirk. Letters and newspapers, &amp;c. are conveyed twice a week 
by a regular carrier belonging to the parish ; and there are, be- 
i les, two from Selkirk, two from Hawick, two from Edinburgh, 
and one from Galashiels weekly during the summer months. There 
are about thirty miles of road in the parish on which any car- 

 As to improvements in this parish, we refer the reader to a volume on this .sub- 
ject by Lord Napier, published in 1822, and entitled, « A Treatise on Practical Store 
Farming, as applicable to the mountainous region of Ettrick Forest, and the Pastoral 
District of Scotland in general."

riage may travel. And the trustees, under the unremitting super- 
mtendance of Lord Napier, are still making and mending. « The 
roads and bridges," says Mr Hogg in his Statistical account of 
Selkirkshire, « were never put into a complete state of repair till 
the present Lord Napier settled in the country; and to his perse- 
verance Ettrick forest is indebted for the excellence of her roads, 
now laid out and finished in every practicable direction. With an 
indomitable spirit of perseverance, he has persisted against much 
obloquy and vituperation, and from none more than the writer of 
this article. But honour to whom honour is due, Lord Napier has 
effected wonders ; and the late impervious Ettrick forest may com- 
pare, in the beauty and efficiency of her roads, with any mountain 
district in the united kingdom." 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is in nearly the centre of 
the parish. Two or three families are distant from it more than 
six miles, yet some of them are almost as regular in their at- 
tendance, as the day returns, for public worship. It was re- 
built and enlarged on the same site nine years ago. It is very 
neatly fitted up within; chaste in its style; commodious and com- 
fortable. It is seated to contain 450 free sitters. The manse was 
built within these last twenty years. It is also in good repair, and 
comfortable. How different from the time when the incumbent 
could with difficulty obtain divots and heather to thack it and make 
it habitable  The glebe contains about twenty- three English acres ; 
ten of which were lately allowed as pasturage or grass glebe. The 
whole may be reckoned at about L. 20 a-year. The stipend, in 1755, 
converted to money, was L. 65, 2s. 2d. Immediately prior to the 
30th of June 1808, it consisted of L. 105, lis. ld. in money, 
with two chalders of oat-meal and two of barley, together with 
L. 8, 6s. 8d. as allowance for communion elements  see Survey of 
Selkirkshire, 1829. The present stipend is fifteen chalders, or 
174 quarters, 6 bushels, and \ gallon imperial measure, half meal 
and half barley, with L. 100 Scots, or L.8, 6s. for communion ele- 
ments. The average yearly amount of stipend converted to mo- 
ney may be L. 230. The locality  interim  of the parish of Ettrick 
and Buccleuch commenced with crop and year 1821, and was mo- 
dified in February 1822. 

There are no chapels or dissenting meeting-houses amongst, us, 
but there are several Dissenters. There is a family of four of the 
Relief persuasion. There are above thirty-two united to the Re- 
formed Presbyterian Synod, the old light of which Boston speaks,

who form a part of the congregation of Ettrick and Eskdale. They 
have sometimes sermon here, though they have no stated minister, 
house, or place of meeting. There are two score and ten belong- 
ing to the flock of the United Associate Synod. In all, there 
may be 15 families of Dissenters. Their general place of worship is 
in Selkirk; but as the distance is so great, many of them attend the 
parish church as regularly as the most of our most regular attenders. 

The parish church, it would appear, from the old records of the 
parish, has been generally well frequented, though we do not know 
if we might say well attended. After the admission of Mr Bos- 
ton in 1707, there is a complaint by him on record, of the 
" indecent carriage of the people at the kirk, going out and in, and 
up and down the kirk-yard the time of divine service. The clerk 
was therefore appointed to go out after the first psalm in the fore- 
noon and afternoon, to see if any be found about the church-yard, 
&amp;c." Afterwards, the elders were enjoined to " prevent or correct 
the abuse." But what was to be expected of a people shut up from 
the whole world. The road to their county town was little better 
than the channel of the river. They had long been destitute, too, 
of all the means of improvement. " There had been little know- 
ledge of religion among them," says Boston, " till the time of con- 
fusion and persecution; so. that John Anderson in Gamescleuch 
told me of a time when there was not a Bible in the church, ex- 
cept the minister's, his father's, and another." There was be- 
sides this, a vacancy of four years from the time Mr M'Mihan 
left the parish till Mr Boston was settled among this people 
as their pastor, though every tenant had applied to his laird 
again and again, to endeavour to have them supplied with a Gos- 
pel minister. The kirk of Ettrick is, however, now well attend- 
ed. When Mr Boston dispensed the sacrament for the first time 
July 16, in 1710, he says ' he had only about fifty-seven com- 
municants belonging to the parish.' When he dispensed the same 
ordinance for the last time, June 13 in 1731, the number of com- 
municants was 777. 

 Boston gives the following interesting account of the solemnity. " The tokens distri- 
buted to communicants were about 777 ; the collection on the three days L. 77, 13s. 4d. 
Scots. There were about nine score strangers in M idghope ; four score of them William 
Black, husband of Isbel Biggar, entertained, having baken for them half a. boll of meal for 
bread, bought 4s. lOd. worth of wheat bread, and killed three lambs, and made thirty 
beds. And I believe their neighbour Isbel's brother would be much the same. This 
I record once for all, for a swatch of the hospitality of the parish ; for God hath given 
this people a largeness of heart, to communicate of their substance on these and other

SELKIRKSHIRE. 



As before the times of the Bostons, .so after their days, the 
people of Ettrick had not for any length of time any regularly 
stated pastor. One was translated to another parish, a second died 
in early life, and a third soon acquired evil habits, and lived to an 
advanced age, leaving a "bare subsistence," to a helper, who resign- 
ed his charge always just as soon as he could find another open 
door. He has now been dead between twenty and thirty years, yet 
the writer of this article is the twelfth incumbent from the elder Bos- 
ton, in the period of very little more than a century. The people 
of Ettrick, therefore, have had many changes by no means favour- 
able to spiritual or mental improvement ; yet we can say, that our 
congregation, considering our population, is by no means incon- 
siderable, and that our communicants have increased, and are in- 
creasing in numbers every year. When we first dispensed the sa- 
crament in this place, eight years ago, the number of communi- 
cants belonging to the parish might be about 118. Last year 
August 26, 1832, they had advanced to the number of 147. 

Bible Society. — A Bible and missionary society was instituted 
here in 1819, "having for its object the dissemination of the scrip- 
tures, without note or comment." The present Lord Napier is 
president of that society, and a great proportion of the heads of 
families, both churchmen and dissenters, have enrolled themselves 
as members. There is an annual sermon preached in behalf of its 
funds. The average of the collection and subscriptions for the last 
four years, is L. 11, 12s. 4d. and these have been generally equally 
divided between the Edinburgh Bible and Missionary Societies. 

Education. — There is one parochial school. Mr John Beattie, 
a teacher of this school, died about seven years ago, his father 
and he together having been schoolmasters in the parish for 
the space of 101 years. There are no other stated schools in the 
parish. A woman may be seen sometimes giving lessons to a few 
small children. In the house of a shepherd may be found some- 
times also, a boy or girl teaching the children of two or three fami- 
lies united. Our scattered population, indeed, is unfavourable to 
the education of the young ; yet we believe, there is not one above 
six years old who has not been taught the first lessons of reading, 
and been instructed in the principles of religion. The present 

occasions also. And my heart has long been on that occasion particularly concerned 
for a blessing on their substance, with such a natural emotion as if they had been be- 
gotten of my bod}'. Those within a mile of the church still had a greater weigh on 
solemn occasions."

teacher is the first in the parish who ever received a classical edu- 
cation. All the branches usually taught at a parochial school 
may now be obtained here. The school salary is the maxi- 
mum, and the amount of school fees, &amp;c. may be about L. 15 a- 
vear. The schoolmaster has all the legal accommodations allow- 
ed to teachers, if by this be meant school-house and garden. The 
people are alive to the benefits of education; and we believe, that 
they are not far inferior to those of any parish of the same kind in 
the south of Scotland. 

Library. — A parish library was instituted between twenty and 
thirty years ago. It was long in a weak state, but still it stood 
and gained strength ; now it is vigorous and progressing. There 
are belonging to it between thirty and forty members, and it con- 
tains nearly 600 volumes. A list of its proprietors, with the laws 
of the society, and a catalogue of the books, were printed in 1824, 
a donation of five guineas being presented by Lord Napier for that 
purpose, who is also himself a member, and who, with two or three 
other proprietors of the parish, have presented to it some very va- 
luable volumes. 

Poor. — Regular assessments appear to have been introduced in 
1725, and have continued ever since. In 1791 " the number of 
persons receiving alms was fifteen : the assessment upon the heri- 
tors for their support L.37, per annum." The number of persons 
at present on the roll is five, among whom is a well known charac- 
ter, the original of the " Davie Gellatly of Waverley." The assess- 
ment for the present year 1833, is L. 23, 19s. Id. with an addi- 
tion of L. 4, allowed as collector's fee. But the average number 
of paupers for the last seven years is 7, and the average sum 
of assessment for the same time is L. 41, 15s. 2d. The church 
collections have been generally appropriated to assist the indus- 
1 rious poor. For the last year, these collections have amounted to 
nearly L. 16, but the average sum of the last seven years may be 
-iated at little more than L. 10. 

Prisons.— Though there be no resident magistrate or lawyer 
generally in the parish, or ready way of getting legal redress, yet 
there is a small prison " the round house," near the fair grounds. 
It is placed there, however, perhaps more in terrorem than in pecnas. 

Pairs. — Here there are four fairs held annually. One in the end 
of March for the sale of grit ewes; for the hiring of servants, and 
especially for the hiring of shepherds. Another held in the end 
of July, called the lamb fair, where wool and lambs are disposed

of, and a great deal of other business transacted. The third is 
in the month of September, for the sale of draft ewes and small 
lambs, and for the purchasing of tups and fat sheep. This is the 
largest of the four, and is a very important market both for the 
seller and purchaser. From 8000 to 10,000 head of stock have stood 
in it, and many of them exchanged owners. The fourth, called 
the Little fair, is held in November, and is principally for selling 
and purchasing fat sheep for marts. Sometimes, also, stock for 
keep is exposed and disposed of, and occasionally a master may find 
a servant who has been disappointed at the general time of hiring. 
No custom has hitherto been levied, and we hear that it is not 
likely that ever any will be exacted. 

Inns. — Two years ago a new inn was built on the banks of the 
Ettrick, near the old mansion of Tushielaw. It is neatly fitted up, 
and has several comfortable apartments. 

Fuel. — Peat is the usual fuel ; and it can be cut for about a 
shilling the cart-load. But coal is beginning to be a favourite, 
and many would prefer a " coal fire," were it not for the expence, 
on account of the distance from which the material is to be brought. 
But we are glad to see the long-contemplated road across the 
Moorfoot hills at length commenced. It will be of immense ad- 
vantage to the district of Yarrow and Ettrick in the importation 
of coal and lime. 

VI. — Miscellaneous Observations. 
" I remember," says an old man of eighty, " when there was not a 
cart in the parish, nor above Singlee, ten miles below Ettrick 
kirk, and but one little enclosed park behind Thirlestane." — "They 
carried the manure to the fields, and the peat from the hills in creels 
on horses backs," now there are about thirty-six carts and twenty 
ploughs, and on every farm one or more enclosures. Formerly 
there was a village at Ettrick House, containing thirty-two fami- 
lies ; now there is but one house inhabited by a shepherd, built on 
the ruins of an old tower, which perhaps gave rise to the name. 
Two elders generally resided here, and out of a list of sixteen poor, 
seven had their residence in Ettrick House. Of the " ten pro- 
prietors of the parish," says the writer of the last Statistical Account, 
" none reside in it." At present, Lord Napier, the patron of the 
church and parish, lives amongst us, and from his seat as a centre, 
life and cultivation are spreading and diffusing their happy influ- 
ence all around us.

" The Scotch fir," says Dr Russell, " is almost the only species of 
wood to be seen here, and that in very small quantities." Now there 
is almost every forest tree of every name, mixing with waving pines 
and firs, in all the varieties of their shades and colouring. The 
seat of Lord Napier is embosomed in woods, and many of the farm 
steadings and snug cottages on the Ettrick, are fringed and skirt- 
ed round with a few lovely young trees. Improvement of this kind, 
indeed, is spreading all around us, in something like the impercep- 
tible stealth of creeping ivy. The black-faced sheep depastured 
our hills forty years ago ; their crop of " wool," says Dr Russell, 
" was of the coarsest kind, and little adapted for manufacture ; a 
stone of it being worth little more than six shillings." Now the 
Cheviot breed is introduced, and is in much repute among the 
generality of the store-farmers, both for its wool and for the 
reception it meets with in the fat market. " The farmers in former 
times," adds the above writer, " fled with their flocks into An- 
nandale for shelter and provision during the winter storms :" 
Now they no longer " build up semicircular walls of the dead, to 
screen the living," but have stells or rounds into which the shep- 
herds gather them when the threatening snow approaches, and have, 
besides, a store of bog-hay on the hills as a supply for the flocks 
in case of a severe and continued storm. " The lochs, partly in 
this parish, and partly in Yarrow, says the above-quoted writer, 
formerly lay like two dark deep dreary pools, shut round with an 
insuperable barrier," and, though abounding in fish of various 
kinds, were rarely visited. Now, St Mary's and the Lowes, sur- 
rounded by verdant hills, and associated with many romantic 
legends, form a scene alike interesting to the angler and the lite- 
rary pilgrim.

GENERAL REMARKS ON THE COUNTY OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1247396">SELKIRK</name>.</head>
<p>
This county, the most inland of Scotland, is bounded on 
the north bv " Peebles-shire and Mid-Lothian; on the east by 
Koxburo-hshi're ; and on the south by the shires of Roxburgh and 
Dumfries. Its figure is so irregular as to contain but a small area 
compared with the greatest length and breadth. The extreme 
length from the source of the Ettrick to that of the Caddon is 
about 30 miles; and the extreme breadth from the Borthwick 
Water to the foot of Glensax is nearly 20. 

Topographical Appearance.— Viewed from a commanding height 
the whole county seems crowded with hills, among which neither 
a house nor any mark of human life appears. In the lower parts 
of the district, where the country is more open, and the surface un- 
dulating, cultivation occupies a considerable breadth, covering the 
minor hills, and skirting the base of the mountains ; but in the 
higher parts it is confined to narrow strips along the streams, and 
so deeply seated as to be invisible to the eye from any of the ad- 
jacent summits. The valleys are too narrow to be called dales, 
and are simply named from their rivers. That of Tweed, being 
more important, has obtained the name of Tweedside ; but, in the 
common language of the country, as if the smaller rivers had not 
a side on which a habitation might be placed, it is said of the 
people, as if they lived in waters, " he lives in Caddon, he 
comes from Ale, or he belongs to Ettrick, or to Yarrow." The 
hills vary in elevation from a few hundred to two thousand feet. 
They have an appearance of sameness in their general character, 
but they have often a considerable variety ; in particular those 
around St Mary's Loch and the Loch of the Lowes, where they 
rise in steep dark masses, especially towards the head of the glen, 
having their own tops concealed in clouds. The county has also 
some of the least agreeable scenery which the eye of man can en- 
dure, that of a cold plain black heath ; which lies between Borth- 
wick Water and the Ettrick, and which is relieved only by small 
lakes of no character, serving only to suggest the swampy nature 
of their situation. 

-Rivers. — The Tweed gives ten miles of its beautiful course to 
adorn this county, and the Gala four miles, along the north-eastern 
boundary. The Ettrick, which joins the Tweed three miles higher 

• These remarks have been furnished by the Rev. N. Paterson, Minister of Ga- 
lashiels. 



SO 



SELKIRKSHIRE. 



• than the Gala, is properly the river of the county, dividing it nearly 
in the middle, and having a course of about thirty miles within it. 
The Yarrow flowing out of St Mary's Loch, ends its short and 
sweet career in the Ettrick, near the town of Selkirk. 

Mountains. — The best idea that can be formed of the moun- 
tains of this parish, may be gathered from what they appear once 
to have been, viz. one large high bed of greywacke and clay-slate, 
now cut by the larger rivers into long-shaped divisions, and cross cut, 
by the smaller streams, to a less depth, and into smaller and rounded 
divisions. In the rocky pool there can be no question as to a recent 
cut having been made ; and there stratum answers to stratum on 
the opposite sides ; so is it with the whole valley wide or narrow. 
The dip of the strata is various ; but the direction, from N. W. 
to S. E. is so uniform that it might serve for a guide to the wan- 
derer in mist. There are exceptions, however, to this uniformity 
in construction and in materials. At Newhouse Lynns, seven 
miles above Selkirk, the rocks forming the banks of the Ettrick, 
rise to a surprising height and perpendicularity. There the strata 
deviating from their plain courses are strangely incurvated ; an ap- 
pearance likewise presented at Newark, where the Yarrow, in the 
same manner, has quarried its rocks for the benefit of the minera- 
logist. The component matter of the hills, at the western extre- 
mity of the county, on the borders of Peebles-shire, where ex- 
tensive layers of porphyry alternating with thin strata of slate and 
granite are found, appears also to be changed. The whole county, 
from its great multitude of hills and streams, affords the best illus- 
trations of the coincidence of vallies, and of the exact proportion 
that subsists the rocky substances being so much the same be- 
tween the descending torrents, and their respective grooves. 

Turnpike Roads and Carriages. — The Edinburgh and Carlisle 
road by Galashiels and Selkirk runs eleven miles within the county. 
The public carriages on this road are the London mail, and one 
daily Stage-coach. Belonging to the same line of road are nine 
miles of turnpike from Crosslee by Yairbridge to Selkirk. 
No coach passes this way, the road being hilly, and that by Ga- 
lashiels being preferred. From Hollilee, on the borders of 
Peebles-shire, to Galashiels are nine miles of turnpike. On 
this road there is one daily coach from Glasgow by Lanark to 
Kelso. From the borders of Peebles-shire, in the parish of Tra- 
quair and passing through Etterick, is a road of twenty-five miles 
lately made turnpike ; but partly maintained by Statute labour.

On this road, tolls are exacted only of travellers not belonging to 
the countv, Carriers, but no coaches, pass this way. 

Tolls —The tolls are let annually by public roup. The rates are 
for a chaise, Is. a gig, 6L a rider or a cart, 3d. The amount of 
revenue for this year is L. 1089, including one pontage for the 
new bridges over Tweed and Ettrick, which yields L. 125. 

Character of the People.— The description under this head in 
the account of the parish of Selkirk is applicable in general to 
the population of the county. It may be added, that all persons 
above six or seven years of age can read. 

The following table of the ages of the population has been 
taken from the returns made to government in 1821.

Miscellaneous Observations. -The arable land of the county lies 
on an elevation of from 280 to 800 feet. None of it, therefore, 
is the best as to climate. Yet it is a remarkable fact, that the 
agriculture of this county is equal to any in Great Britain. Wheat 
abounds in the lower districts, and has been raised at the height 
of 700 feet, to what would be called a good crop in the Lothians; 
and considerably higher, near to the head of Ettrick, oats, tur- 
nips, barley, and clover hay thrive in regular rotation. We could 
wish much that the dwelling-houses and farm-buildings in this 
county were as worthy of commendation as the agricultural skill 
which is every where displayed in it. 

 In this enumeration are included those small parts of the parishes of Ashkirk, 
Inverleithen, Peebles, Roberton, and Stow, which belong to the county of Selkirk. 
The ratios, however, may be held to apply to the four parishes before dcscnbed, as 
forming the county of Selkirk.
