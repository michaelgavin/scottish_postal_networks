fufiragan at Bervie, to accommodate the people in that 
qaarter of his pari(h ; and the .Lords for the Plantation 
of Kirks, in the year 1618, dbjoined Bervie from Kinnefi, 
and increafed the ftipends of both incumbents/ The pfwpr 
of prefentation is vefted in the Crown. The extent of 
this parifh is inconfiderable, being only about 2 miles long, 
and 14. mile broad \ from E. to W. it rifes in a gradual af- 
cent, and terminates at the top^ of a high hill. On the eaft 
comer of the paiifh, the burgtit of Bervi€ is fituttedX and 
on the fouthmoft part, the Village of Gourdon (lands. The 
burgh of Bervie confifts, of thtyee ftreets, which form near^ 
I7 three fides of a fquare, and contains about no dwel- 
ling-houfes. The original plan of the town feems to have 
been laid out in a very judicious manner, but it has not 
been adhered to ; for the houfes are fet down irregularly, 
according to the fancy of the builders. Bervie is the on- 
ly royal burgh in the cclhnty of the Meams, and its 
charter was granted by David II. in the year 1342. 
When returning from England, he was forced, by firels 
of weather, to land at the water-mouth of Bervie ; and it 
is faid, that having met with great hofpitality and kind- 
nefs from the inhabitants, he bedowed on the town a 
royalty, as a mark of his particular favour : The place on 
which he landed, to this d ly bears his name, and is called 
Craig David. James VI. in the year 1595, renewed the 
charter, and confirmed all the privileges and immunities 
granted by King David *. 

Tijhtrits^ 

* By this charter, the public property is diftindtly marked ont ; in- 
deed it coinpr,eb«iid« nearly Hbz whole' extent of the parifli ; but the pro* 
perty which now belongs to the town is confined to a piece of barren 
moor, a few acres of haugh ground, and a range of braes, about a mile in 
extent, which atfbrd a little grafs for the cows belonging to tht inhabitanto 
o£ the town, in tbe fummer ieafon. By thi$ charter, " full power is givei^

Tifbtrits^ Manufatiures^ Markets^ yr.— Bervic feems at 
{bme period to have been a.confiderable fiAiing (lationi 
for lines, hooks, and fhells, have been dug up in differ- 
ent parts of the town \ but beyond the memory of man, 
there have been no profefllonal fiOiermen, probably they 
have removed to the village of Gourdon, which is a more 
eligible fituation for carrying on that bufinefs. Bervie has 
been long famous, or rather infamous, for an illicit and ille- 
gal trade in teas, fpirits, tobacco, &amp;c. ; but the ruinous gnd 
baneful trade of fmuggling is now much on the decline, 
being confined to the running * of a few hundred ankers of 
fpirits annually, and by . a fet of worthleis defperadoes, 
who do not belong to the town, but bring their goods to 
Bervie beach, for the fake of conveniency, and an eafy 
landifag. In the year 175c, a branch of a fail-cloth ma- 
nufiidure was eftabliihed by a company of merdiants of 
Montrofe, and was long carried on with great fuccels, but 
about IS years ago was entirely given up ; however, the 

weavers 

to the free burgefles of the faid burgh, and their facceflbrs, to make, 
chooie, cooftitute. and create, a provoil, bailies, dean of guild, treafu* 
Mr, coancillors, oAcen,'* &amp;c. &amp;c. Accordingly a provoft/j bailies, 
dean of guild; treafarer, and 9 councillora, are annnally ele^ed, but not 
bj the *' free burgefles,** as exprefled by the charter, in dircd language, 
but by themfelves : However, I believe felfele^ion is not confined to 
Benrie alone, but is the univerfal praAicc of the Scotch borooghs. The 
tr a d efmen of this burgh have no regular corporations, of courfe they 
have BO oflke-bearcn as in other towns, but they have a. fmall fund efta- 
blilbed, 5y mutual confent, each member pays fo much on entry, and 
]nartcrly. This money is generally applied in purchafing meal, which 
they fell out to the members of their own fociety. Bervie is one of the 
burghs in the Aberdeen diftri^, and accordingly votes for a repreien* 
tttfve in Parliament, by a delegate chofen by the town-council, and the 
eicAion takes place in the burghs by roution of Parliaments.

weavers are ffill, and have long been in die pnBist o^ 
purdiafing flax, which thcj fpin, weave, and bleach, each 
for his own account : The qoantit j fS cloth thus mannfiic* 
tured is inconfiderable, but it finds a ready market in our 
countrj-fairs, and generally fells at the rate of i d« Sterlin|p 
a*jard, above the' current price of cloth of die £une 
qnality, whitened at a regular bleachfield. The bkaching 
of cloth was a confiderable trade five or fix years ago, and 
is fiill continued, though not to half the extent. About 
15 years ago, a nianufadure of cdoored threads was efta* 
bliflied in Bervie, and is ftill carried on. The threads are 
fent to the London market, where they generally find a 
ready fide. This manufadure employs, in all its parts, 
about 50 people. Three years ago^ a machine was eteded 
on the haughs of Bervie, for fpinning linen-yam ^ This 
machine was the firft of the kind in Scotland. Although 
exceedingly imperfect at firft, it is now brought to a coo- 
fiderable degree of improvement; the yam it ^mis is of 
a good quality, and fit for any fort of manofadare what^ 
ever. The proprietors of this machine have alfo the thread- 
manufaSure, mentioned above, fo that all the yam fpuit 
by the machiike is made into threads. The boufe is aoi 
yet filled with machinery, but wfll contain firom 600 ta 
700 fpindles, when fuD, and employ about 60 boys 
and girls, and ao or 30 meir and women. Two yeals aga 
alail-doch manufiiftufe was eftabliflied, which eoqdoys 14 
weavers, and a proportional number of other hands. A 
lint-mill was built laft year on the hanghs of Bervie, 
which is likely to meet with encouragement. There are 
aHo two mills far cutting barley, and they cut about 130a 
bolls yearly, which is generally^ carried up the frith of 
Forth. There is likewife a corn-mill, to which the te^ 
aa^ts of the pariih are thirled* la laft December, a dif-^

1781. The ftipendf is 4 chalders of vidual, 400 merks

not exceed L. 18 or L. 20 jearljr.— The poor are about la

' Village of Gotrrdbn.— ^This village is fituated on the fouth 
comer of the pariih. It confifis of 42 habitable houies, 
befides fiables, bams, and granaries. There is a harbour^ 
but it is neither commodious nor bitf being of difficult 
entry, and much expofed to the violence of the S«

barks, in all about 300 tons burden, belonging to Gour*

it, and from thence they carry grain occafionally coaft*

able to navigate the feas : In winter, th^y are lai^ up, and 
the (ailors betake themfelves to fifliing/at lead the, rnqft 
indoftrioos of them do fo. There are annually imported 
into the harbour of Gourdon about 3000 bolls of lime-. 
ikcBs ; from 700 to 800 bolls of Scots, and about loop bar- 
rek of £nglifh coalsy which fupply the country for a few ' 
miks round. There are about 4000 bolls of grain export- 
ed yearly, and which are genei^lly carried to the ports in 
the frith of Forth, or Glafgow and Greenock, by the ca- _ 
naL About 30 years ago, 50 bolls of Scots coab were 
fufficient to fupply the demand at Gourdon : For many 
ycai» after that period, the inhabitants were mucK in the 
pcadice of ufing peats or mo(s as fuel, but the mofles are 
sow nearly exhaufted ; and the ezpence of labour has be« 
come fo high, that peats are dearer^ than coals ; of courfe, 
the demand for coals has very confiderably increafed with- 
in thefe io or 12 years, for coals are the only fuel which 
is now uied in the town of Bervie, and neighbourhood ;. 
but the partial and unjuft tax on them prevents a greater 
coniiunption ; it is expenfive to the manufadurer, and op- 
prei&amp;vetothe poor; a tax, w4iich by .^o means can yield 
to Gorerament a compenfation adequate to its extenfive 
oppreffion and pernicious effeds. Before the year 1768, 
BO lime was imported to be ufed as a manure ^ and for a 
few years after that period, ubout 2^0 boils were found 
fnfficieot to fupply every demand. About 30 years ago, 
there were 3 fiifaing-boats, of a large fize, befides fmaller 
boats or yaub, which in all employed 30 fiihermen \ but 
DOW there are only 4 fmall yauls, and 12 men employed 
in the filhing, and they earn but a fcanty pittance, being 
dd and decrepid men, they are unable to work at any o 
ther bufinels, and mull linger out a miferable exiftence, 
with little hope of ever being better-, for the fiihing-bu-

finefs feemi to be nmch on .the decline on this coaft« owimg 
to the great Icarcity of fifties, particularly of the fpecies 
called haddocks. Withm thefc lo or xa years, the had- 
docks have left this coaft almoft entirely. In the jear 
1782, a prodigious ftorm happened on this coaft, the wind 
blowing with uncommon violence, railed the fea in iiicb 
mountainous billows, as to produce efFe£b almoft like as 
earthquake \ and fince that ftorm, the haddpcks have e verjr 
year become (career. The grpund on which the h^docka 
were found, was a continued bed of muffelsi (the favourite 
food of that fii&amp;), clufters of which the fiflier^nen nfe to dratv 
up frequently with their lines ; but fince that florm, the 
bottom has been entirely covered with fand. The mnf- 
fels'^being deftroyed in this manner, of courfe it behovej[ 
the haddocks to remove to a more favourable ftation ; how* 
ever, a few cod-iifii are ilill caught, and they fell at a very- 
extravagant price, at leaft five or fix times the price they 
were formerly fold for *• Of late years, a good many |ier. 
rings have been taken in the proper feafon, botl^ hj the 
fifhermen of Gourdon, and the falmon-fifliers of Bervie^ 
which they fell in the neighbourhood at the rate pf 3 d. a? 
dozen. Crabs and lobfters .are alfo taken on the coaft^ 
and among the rocks. 

^ . Country part of tie Par^.— There are about 780 acres 

.'K of arable land here* as much more wafie and uncultivated 

moor, and a few acres of pafture. The low lands are a 
. ^ fine loam of confiderable depth, and the high grounds a 

mixture of clay and gravel. According to the bed cal-

to* be remarked, that they are chiefly compofed^ not uf the 
original inhabitants of the pariihi but of thole who have 
rempv^ hither from other parKhes ; nor can it be expe&amp;ed 
that the prefent generation will return into the bofom of 
the Eftabliflied Church. The examination roll of the £fta- 
blfihed Church contains only 260 perfons, while that of 
the SeiQefiion contains ^73. — The King is patron. The fti- 
pend is 10 chalders barley, with the vicarage-teinds which, 
about 30 years ago, are faid to have amounted in value to 
from L. 16 to L. 30 Sterling ; but at the admiilion of the 
prefent incumbent, tliey amounted only to from L. 6 to 
L. 7, and are ftill finking in value, from the decreafe of 
iheep in the pariih ; fo that it is likely they will foon 
be inadequate to defray the etpenfe of.collcding them* 
There is a good manfe, with offices, which have been 
lately repaired, and a glebe of rather more than four 
acres of good quality .-^There is a parochial fchool, but no 
fchool houfe at prefent ; the heritors, however, have ordered 
one to be built. The falary is only L. 8 : 6 : 8 ; a paltry 
coniideration to induce any young man, who has been at 
the expenfe .of a liberal education, to undertake an office of 
alt others the moft flavifh and fatiguing. The Society for 
Propagating Chriftian Knowledge have been pleafed, of 
late* to appoint a fchool-miftrels for this parifli, to inftruft 
young girls in the diiferent branches of education neceiTary 
for that fex, which, it is believed, will prove of fingular 
benefit to the place ; as heretofore it was impoilible for pa- 
rents to get their children educated, but by fending them 
to towns, which, by reafon of their poverty, and the high 
rate of board wages, very few of them only were able to 
do. — Here, as in moft other pariflies in the North, the 
poor form a confiderable part, whoihaveno funds but what

, , Difaivaniages.'^On^ great difadvantage whtt^ the fiHiner 
in this place labours under, is the high multure which he ' 
pays to the mills. If he fend eight bolls of com to the 
mill, he mall leave one of them for mill-daes. But th^ * 
principal difadvantage, and which above every other thing 
iretards all improvement in agriculture, is the want of itiel,^ 
of which ho kind whateveJf, young fir-tre^s excepted, is to 
be found within the parifli -; and thefe fir trees, or thinnings 
of the woods, are generally fold at fbch 'a rate, that it 
would b^' much tM&amp;ti'tbr iht people t6 provide thetnfelves 
in coab. The fuel'ttfed' inthb parifh conMs chiefly off 
peat and turf, of which' they carry from the diftanoe of 
five or fix miles ; and in cutting and caning which, the 
fafmers atid their fervants* are employed for the whole of 
the fummer feafon, to the total negleft of every thing diat 
might improve and benefit their farms. And what is ftiH 
more diftrefling, many of them are under the neceflity of 
going through the fands to fetch home their fuel, and moil 
therefore by night and by day watdi the' opportunity 
when the tide is out, fo that it is no unufual thing to itt 
theni (et out for the mob at the time when* others go to 
reft. The badnefs of the roads, and the great diftance 
which they have to go, occafion them great ezpenfii i^ 
carts and hamefe ; and after all they have but moft unconr- 
fortable fuel. If the (eafon be wet, they generally kfe 
their labour, being not able to carry their fuel out of the 
mols; and what they carry home is fo wet, that it will not 
anfwer for fire. It was therefore with the higbeft fads- 
fadion they learned, that it b intended to bring a bill into 
Parliament,  to repeal the duties payable on coals carried 
coaftwife to the North, as it will enable them to procure 
fiiel at a cheaper rate, and with far leis drudgery, and at 
the fame time will permit them to direct their attention .to 
agriculture, which at prefent, from Che. aboTe-mendoned 
taufe, is too much negleded by them.

TflET who are judges of the Gaelic, iaj. That Carn* 
bee takes its name from two words, cam and bee^ or 
bray^ which fignif j« *' Birch-hill." This derivation feems 
the more probable, as there is immediately to the nortti 
of the charch, which (lands high, a pretty large incioiure, 
which to thb day goes by the name of the Birch-park^ 
though there is no one alive who remembers having leen a 
fingle birch growing'in it. This pariih is near 4 ftatute- 
miles in length, and about the fame in breadth. From the 
church, all the way to the weft end of the parifh, there is 
a ridge of rifing ground, which llretches in a pretty firaight 
line, nearly through the middle of the pariih. Upon this

Kellie-Law, Gellandihill, and CBiuier*Law« Upon the 
top of fome of Ihf fe, paitacidafly KelUe-Law, is an im- 
meafely large cairn of ftones, of varioos kinds and fixes, 
which evidentlj appear to have been coUeded with muda 
labour, and chrowii tagedier, probably for Ae pnrpofe of 
perpetuating the remembrance of fome great event, or 
with a view to kindle a fire npon the top of the cairn, to 
warn the comitrj at a time of public danger. On the 
iouth fide of thele high grounds, all the way down towards 
the coaft, you have a great extent of fine rich fertile 
ground, which commonly produces moft luxuriant crops o£ 
all kinds. The ibil hete, hasi in general, « mixture of 
day in it ; fome of the fields are of a loamy nature \ others 
eonfift of deep rich black earth ; and almoft all of theia 
have a gentle flope towards the fouth and eaS. That part 
of the pariih, which lies to the north of the rifing groonds 
above mentioned, is much more adapted for pafture than 
tillage, though there are fome of die lands, (ihofe particu-- 
larly at Caffingray), where, in dry feafons, they raife as 
tieh crops of bear and oats as in any pan of the pariih.

cepte4. But from the average of births, takeo from ths 
year 1781 to 1793, there have been only 27 births yearly* 
This decreafe of population is evidently to be afcribed to 
tbe two following caufes. The fird is, that at prefent, the 
^hole lands jn the pariih, (eiccepting what fome of the 
proprietors keep in their own hands), are let in tack to 3X 
farmers -, whereas, in the beginning of this century, they were 
divided among at lead 5 times that number. The fecond 
caufe to be afligncd, is, that fome years ago, there were 
coals wrought to a pretty confiderable extent, at Over- 
Carnbee, Balcormo, Cailingray, and in fome other lands 
in this parifli, whereas now there is not any one coal-work 
going on within the bounds of the parifli ; the neoeflarji 
confequence of which has been, that a great many of tho£b 
colliers, and other work-people in that line, who were wont 
%o tind conllanC employment here, found themfelves under 
the neceffity of going elfewhere for bufinel^, in the way to 
which they had been accuftomed. 

ProfptB from Kellie-Law^ Wr;— The profped from the 
ehurch of Carnbee is uncommonly fine*, it ftands high^ 
and is comfortably iheltered from the north by a clump of 
fine old trees *, but when, in clear weather, you go weft, 
and afcend to the top of Kellie Law, which is about 800 
feet above the level of the fea, and near three ftatute-miles 
from the coaft, you have then one of the moft delightful 
views to be feen in almoft any part of Scotland. Imme- 
diately below to the fouth, the eye is delighted with the 
near view of a rich beautiful ftretch of country, a great 
part of which is enclofed and fubdivided, and in a high 
ftate of cultivation. The fmaU towns and royal boroughs 
upon the cbaft, though far from being in fo flourifhing a 
ftate as before the Union, add greatly to the beauty and 
fichnels of the profpe^ \ fo does the range of towns on the 

oppofite

It is remarkabk in this hill, that the foil of it in general 
is eqiiallj good and deep with the mod fertile grounds be* 
low, and the aicent fo gradual from the weft, that carria- 
ges, with fafety, may go to the top of it. 

Birds ofPaJfage^ \Sc. — ^Thc birds of paflage here ar^ 
dotterel, woodcock, fwallow, cuckoo, and lapwing. Of 
the&amp; laft, it is obferved, that they have of late returned 
much earlier in the feafon than they were wont to do, pro- 
bably owing to the uncommonly open winters we have had 
for fome years paft. But all thefe birds of paflage, the gen^ 
tlemen and farmers too would heartily welcome to a long- 
er vifit among them, could they only get free of the 
crows, which are very deftru£tive in the fpring to the 
wheat, and every other kind of grain. At the fame time, 
the dcfirudion they do in this way, very probably is in a 
great meafure balanced by the very eSedual afliftance they 
give in deftroying the cob-worm: Of this there was a fatisfy- 
ing proof lately in this parifh. A fervant of the Earl of Kel* 
He, who had jufi finilhed the fowing a rich field with oats, 
was much vexed to fee it in a little covered all over with 
crows ; in various ways did he endeavour to drive them 
oS^ but all in vain, till at laft he (hot feme of them, when, 
to his great aftoniihment, upon opening up their ftomachs, 
he found them quite full of cob worm, and not one grain 
of oats.

being the rent of a few acres of land, mortified by a pre-

His fchoolfees are, z s. 6d. for teaching Engliih, 2 s. fat 
writing, and as. 6d. for Latin or arithmetic, the quarter ; his 
"income may be about L. 40. — ^From the lift kept of tl^e ppor, 
it appears, at an average, there are 8 yearly upon th^ public 
funds of charity in the parilh. Some of thefe have ullow- 
ed them 5 s. and others only 2 s. a- month. When induftri- 
ous houfeholders come to be in want, as foon as the feffioq 
have proper information of the fame, they generally get 
conveyed to them what will buy a firlot or two of meal, 

a cart load of coals, or help to pay the iurgeons bill for me- 
dicines and attendance, when they have been long in bad 
health. Poor however as they are, they fecm very averfe 
at firft to take any aififtance from the public funds, in fo 
much that xnftances have occurred of their returning the 
money, though not many months after they found them* 
felves under the neceffity of applying for it. About 60 or 
70 years ago, it was very common here for houfeholders in 
rather poor circumftances, to apply to the kirk-feffion for 
the loan of a fmall iam of moneyi for wfaicfa they granted

gO| General Grant, to render the intercoorie betw ee n Ibn 
veraven and his eftate of Mocaage more eafy and ezpedi-^ 
tious, at hit own expenfe caufed a large road for caniage» 
and carts, to be made from Inveraven to Morange and 
Gleniivet, ever the hill of Gamocaj, (a ridge of hill 
extending from Bclrinnas, foathweft to Aven, as far as his 
right extended \) and when the road reached to the Duke of 
Gordon's property, it was carried on by the ftatute-work.of 
the country. Acrofs this road runs the rivulet or bum of 
Tommope ki Inveraven, (which has its rife in the north- 
welt fide of Belrinnas \) he, therefore, that it might be no 
hindrance, at hb otvn expenfe alfo, put a ftone bridge of 
two arches, 8 or 1 2 feet wide, over it ; but, in a few years 
afterward, (in 1782), the bum, when greatly Iwelled bj 
an impetuous torrent from the hilb, undermined the foun- 
dation, and carried^ it away, together with the meal-mill 
and aH its implements, (wh ch was a quarter of a mile be- 
low it on the fame bum), into Aven. This was a great I0&amp; 
to the parifh "and travelle rs, as the bum, when it is big, 
cannot be pafTed but by a bridge The Duke of Gordon alfo 
caufcd a road for carriages to be made from G]enrimias»

I never heard that oaks grew around thofe places; but 
there are oaks growing between the water of Aven and 
the temple, near Ballendalloch ; and there grow oaks on 
the weft fide of Aven, oppofite to that at Delmore, but

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — ^There are only two houfes 
where t^e ferry-boats on Spey and Aven are kept, that 
ibmetimes keep a dram of whilky to accommodate paflen* 
gers who may lodge with them, but feldom have ale. 
There are alfo two dills for aquavitae, or whiiky, in the pa« 
fid). This fpirit is no doubt hurtful to the conftitution, and 
alfo to the niorals of the people.-^I know only four houfeg 
or cottages which have been pulled down and left uninha- 
Citable within the lafi ten years, and four that have been 
new built in that fpace of time. — The fuel here ufed is 
peats, of which there is no fcarcity in a dry year, becaufe 
in every corner of the pariih there is plenty of mols, or of

but the peats are not in all parts equally good. Some are

Soil, ^^nculturif iyc. — The rental of the p^riih about 
nine jears ago was upwards of L. 92co Sterling a-jear \ 
and by this tiane fome farms have been let*«t more tbaa 
twice the rent of that period. The foil of feveral farms 
towards the fouth end is abundand/ capable of cultivation. 
Not onljthe Molm of DaIvj and of Gj^ennai^ but even the 
hard land of Bogie, and many other farms, when manured 
and well cultivated, yield excellent crops of oats, rye, and 
barley. Such &amp;rms as are unfit for cultivation, which 
dafs includes about nine^enths of thie parifii, are vfi general 
excellent paflure. The greater part of the hills above the 
Black Water are green ; the red are moftly heathy. The 
Earl of Galloway, who is the principal heritor of this parifli, 
in order to raife the rent of his lands around the village 
called St John's Clauchan, has, during that period, oflTei ed 
feus of ground for boiifes and gardens, on reafonable terms, 
to fttch perfons as would build there -, and the plan has 
iucceeded fo well, that the village is already four times as 
large as it formerly wa3 *• 

Thofe 

. • The renin already pay his Lordfliip for the lands which they poffefi. not 
«nly a greater rent than the former tenants paid, but even than others in 
the neighbourhood pay for lands of the fame quality. And as the demand 
lor l«nds genemlly increafcs with the nunber of feuar*, it is probable that 
en a new leafe, the feaars will rather give a little more rent for their poC 
ibffions than be deprived of them. We may add, that the manore and cul* 
tore bePowed upon thefe lands by fo many peribnt, every one of whom 
conld cultivate and manure more than he poflefles, evidently tends to en- 
rich and nieliorate the foil. Thefe fafls fufficiently Ihaw how much it is 
the intereft of the proprieton of improveable lands, to encourage feoingt 
and the divifion of large arable farms into fmall : but befides promoting 
their own advantage, they may by this method do an important fervice to 
their countij. fiy this method, not only a generous iDaii»bot even • mi-

Tfioie fpotB of land which we call crofb are generaBy 
silawed to be at leaft twice as valuable as the fame fpota 
ia their original ftate. Some, iodeedi have alleged, that 
tflds, which arc oaturallj very rich pafture, or have been 
aadc fo by improvements, are damaged by tillage. How- 
ever this be, with refped to lands which are naturally poor 
snd icancy of foil, it is, if not lelf-evident, at leaft an un- 
doubted hStj -well known to every hufbandman of expe- 
nence, that the more they are cultivated and manured, the 
^leT they muft be for pafture, when prepared for and ap- 
plied to that purpofe. Of this b&amp; zaj one may have ocu- 
lar demooftration in the farm of Grennan, which has been 
long almoft entirely ufed for pafturage. The greater part of 
it IS hard land, yet fome of it the beft pafture of any in the 
puiih. The hard land in this farm is of two kinds, com- « 
moolj diftinguiOied by the names of outfield and infield. 
The former is that which has been generally applied to 
paftarage, feldom tilled, and fcantily manured, which^ 
before ftill continues to be the pooreft part of the farm. 
The latter is that which, lying neareft the farm-houfeB, bat 
heca frequently tilled and plentifully manured, which, 
therefore, is now the fineft pafture in the farm, except in 
dry fnmmers, when the holming land, from the depth aa 
well as from the moiftnefs of the foil, is greatly preferable. 
What has been faid, feems fufiicient to convince proprietors 
of arable lands which are not exceedingly rich, that they 
ve Qot damaged, but improved by tillage and manure.

But iiow jhall we convince the fanner, thstt it is his inD 
reft, as well as the prc^ietor's, to manure end cultivsue tis 
pooreft of the arable hsA ia bis farm, even in prefjcrence t 
the richeft ? If be poffefles an ettenfiye farm, we migt 
find it aimoft impofUble to remove all hb objedbos : bt 
if he pofiefies onlj a fmall farm, and has a leale of it for 
coniiderable number of years, the bufinels wiU not be difii 
cult. His neceffities will oblige him, at leaft if he be 
man of any experience, to obferve the very method whici 
we would propofe. If there are any of his lands in fo goo 
a condition for pafture, that he could (carce ezped to mak 
them better, and at the fame time needs them for that pur 
pofe, he will not rafhly break them up to the detriment o 
his cattle : but if there are any of his land which he fee 
to be of little value for pafture, yet capable of cultivation 
will he not naturaUy confider, that here. Without any con 
fiderable lo(s of pafiure, he may, by manure and culture 
raife corn for the fubfiftence of his &amp;mily ? Though, on t 
fuperficial view, it may appear paradoxical, experience 
will foon convince him, that by manure and cnltnre the 
pooreft lands may be rendered the fitteft for corn : foi 
where the foil is very rich, the crop may make a fine ihow 
till it begin to (hoot, or put forth the ears ; but then the 
ilighteft rain lays it down to the ground, where it lies till 
it rots, or, at beft, it produces ears, partly empty, and 
partly not half filled : whereas the pooreft lands, if they 
are dry, and have a moderate depth of foil, though ploughed 
deep, and plentifully manured, will produce crops not apt 
to be too luxuriant, and to be laid down by rain, but hardy, 
and with ears plump and full. The greater part of the 
arable lands in this parifti are naturally fo poor, that with- 
out manure they do not yield a crop of any value j but 
when properly manured and cultivated, they produce com, 
if not in as great abundance, yet of a fupcrior q^uallty to

dwt wluch is ndied in the lower parts of Gallowaj, where 
one maj have at a moderate rate plenty of lime, of marl, 
orofiheUs. 

Thdie manures, at this diftance, are fo expenfive, that 
few £uiners here think of procnring them \ yet, of the two 
former, fome have made trial with confiderable advantage. 
Mr Newall, of Barikeooh, was probably the firft in this 
pariih who improved any confiderable extent of land with 
lime, the effeds of which are ilill remarkable after a period 
of near 10 years. The minifter of this pariih, who was 
fettled in 1783, having bat a fmall glebe, and, excepting 
a few fpocs, of the pooreft quality imaginable, as was ma- 
mSeSt from that fmall kind of broom which over-runs thin 
tilly land \ naj, befides in many parts fo fiill of rocks, 
. diat moft people would have thought it impoffible to ren- 
der thefe parts arable; yet, with great induftry and ex« 
penfe, not only quarried out and removed moft of thefe 
rocks, bat with picks and levers deepened the moft {hallow 
and tilly parts of it, fo as to render them arable: and as, 
after all this labour and expenfe, fuch iland would have 
prodooed nothing without manure, he brought lime from 
Tongland, which is 20 mi}es diftant, and even from Kirk- 
cudbright, which is two miles farther ; and having made 
t compofition of the lime with earth and dung, overlaid 
the greateft part of the glebe, and has thus, for fe'veral 
yean paft, though on fo unpromifing a foil, raifed as good 
crops as any perhaps in Galloway. Many perfons, who 
were acquainted with fome of the fpots which were for- 
merly bare rocks, were amazed to fee them produce fuch 
crops, and could fcarce believe their own eyes, though in 
reality there was no miracle in the cafe : for when the rocks 
were quarried out to ^ proper depth, and plenty of earth put 
in their place, with a'drelling of the coropoft mentioned, it 
would rather have been** a miracle, if fuch parts had not

^fisHded as good a crop as the reft. On one Iktk field te 
made an experiment of the diflferent effiefls of lime, marl^ 
tad dung in producing a crop of oau. The part which 
was limed produced a crop, which, eren in a wet fiuamer, 
fiood firm till it was ripe, or at leaft only leaned with the 
wei^t of the ears, which were indeed very plump. The 
part which was dunged was in every refpeft fimilar: hot 
the part which was marled produced a crop which, thong|&amp; 
not taller than the others, yet was foon laid dob to the 
ground by the raia ^ the confiB^uence of which was, that 
feme of the ears were no better than chaff, and the heft 
were fiur inferior to thofe of the other two. He is not lb 
laflt as from thb fingle experiment to deduce any condu* 
fion to the prejudice- of marl ; yet, as he found that 
though it might be brought in boats up the Dee, and thei^ 
oppofite to NewgaUoway, the neareft poft*town, which ia 
not above three mSes diftant, this land-cartiage, added ta 
the water-carriage from Carlingwork Loch, which is about 
1% miles from Newgdloway, rendered it more expenfive 
than lime, he therefore prefers the latter to the former r

fingle cart-loads, each containing five buftiels, are fofiicient

of oats ; a quantity which is fix times as foon carried the 
fame diftance, and fcattered on the land, as the quantity o£ 
dung or marl which would be faflicient for the lame ex- 
tent. The tenant of B^ue« which is one of the beft arable 
fbrms in the parifliy and the fitteft for lime, has latdy be- 
gun to bring lime from Clofebum or Barjarg, which ta 
him is nearer than Tongland. The good effeds of it are

llioagh we are ftroogly dHpo&amp;d to recommtad to £uinec8 
licre the ufe of limei and are convinoed, that if they have 
a long leafe thej niiift be gainers by it, yet we muft can- 
didly own, confidering the ezpenfe of it at this difiiance, 
that fiurmers who are near the places where plenty of it 
may be obtained, partly from the certainty of not being 
diiappointed as to the quantity whidi they want, and partly 
from the carriage being eafily accompliihed at very little 
ezpenfe, may be greater gainers by the ufe of Itme^ though 
they pay for their lands the acre double the rent which is 
pud by the fiEurmers here ; nay, perhaps the former, with 
the advantages they poflTefi, could pay a higher rent for 
their lands, and yet be greater gainers than the latter, 
thoQgh they had their lands rent-free. Henee it is evi- 
dent, that the proprietors of lands here ought not to exaA 
for them foch a high rent as is paid for thofe which are 
more advantageoufly fituated, and that if they wiihed to 
have a great rent for their lands, they ihould, in the firft 
place, encourage their tenants to render them really valu- 
aUe, by enriching them with lafting manure* If a tenant 
undertakes to lime any confiderable extent of land, the 
proprietor forely ought, on this account, either to give him 
his fiirm at a lower rent, and for a longer period than 
odierwiie he would have done, or to allow him a proper 
reoompenoe for every real improvement. But let 00 pu- 
blic fpirited farmer here, who has a leafe of fuch length as 
to indemnify him, conclude from what has been faid, that 
be ought not to lime his lands, becauie his profit by the 
Iteration cannot be near fo great as that of the farmer, 
who is at fiurleb&amp;flance firomUme or other lading manure, 
or bccanfe his landlord is not difpofed to give him the fiill

the farmers, thongh fome of them do a great deal, jet 
wonM ftill do a little more with fuch as thejr have in their 
power. Bj paring and burning the furface of moflj and 
bentj gronndt as is the cuftom in many parts of Scotland, 
great quantities of a(hes nught be produced, which, for the 
time thej laft, are as good a ntanure as lime. Bj gather- 
ing into heaps, while full of Tap, thiflles, fern, ragweed, all 
forts of green vegetaUes, and covering them with earth till 
they rot, an excellent manure nuy with a little indnftry 
be procured. The dung and urine of animals, which are 
manures that fuit every foil, and are, for .the time they laft, 
as effeAnal as any, might be preferved more entirely than 
they generally are, and mixed with other ingredients to 
make them cover a greater extent of land. The channel 
• of the cow-houfe or byre mighty efpecially in fummer, if 
the cows lie within, be covered with thin turf, or furface 
earth, together with chaff, ftraw, or litter of any kind, by 
which meftns'the ftale of the cattle, and the iap of their 
dung, might be very completely preferved. As the iap of 
a dunghill is the moft valuable part of it, and yet is in the 
greateft danger of being at leaft partly loft through inatten- 
tion, it may be preferved by the following method:— « 
Make the feat of your dunghill either in a place naturaOy 
boUow and dry, whence the (ap may have no defcent, or 
in a fpot naturally dry, and artificially dug to a confider- 
able depth, or banked all round with earth to a confider- 
able thickneis ; cover the bottom two or three feet deep 
-with the fineft furface earth you can coQvcniently find ; on 

this

thb lay dong and fine earth alternately ;. Imooth the fiirfaoe 
of the doo^ill ; cover it entirely with, a little earth to pre- 
vent the &amp;p being exhaled by the air, and keep it always 
pretty broad above, that it may receive and retain as much 
of the xain as may keep it from being too much heated, or, 
as we call it, fire-fanged, which would render it almoft ufe- 
leis. By this method of preferving the fsq, it is evident 
yoa may have your dunghill twice as bulky, and equally 
fit for every kind of crop, as 70a could have it if you ne- 
glefied this method. The cffeft too o^f this manure upon 
the land will be equally lafting with that 4£ dung unmixed : 
nay, upon a thin tilly foil, the fine earth, faturated with 
the lap of the dung, is the beft improvement that can be 
invented; at leaft it is much better than lime itfelf, with- 
out the addition of rich earth.— The holoa of Dairy, and 
Ibme hard lands about the village, are poffeffed by the 
fieoars, who have been at great pains to enrich them with 
manure, as otherwife the hard lands in general, though 
warm and kindly enough, would have yielded no crops of 
com Efficient to repay the ezpenfe of feed and labour, not 
to fpeak of rent ; and even this holm, though naturally 
the bcft land in the pariih next to the holm of Grennan, 
produces in general but a very poor crop without manure, 
jet with manure it produces excellent crops. To a curious 
obferver it is entertaining to fee in this holm the various 
mixture of a foU, whofe component parts are the fame, viz* 
day and (and* Here three varieties deierve fpecial atten- 
tion. One is, where there is too much of the day mingled 
widi the Cuid ; another is, where there is too much of the 
iand mingled with the clay % and the third is, where the 
two are fo happily mixed, that neither of them is above or 
under the due proportion requifite to render the foil fertile. 
It is only on the fpots where this happy mixture obtains, 
that one may expeft a good crop even without manure ; 

but 



54 Siati/Hcal Account 

hat cm tlie parts where cither of die two finrmer virieti«» 
takes place, the crop without manure will be hat of little 
valoe. It is much to be regretted, that when die hofan of 
Dairy was divided and let to the feoars, the divifioos had 
not been made with a litde more attention to pleafe tlie 
eye of the fpeftator, as well as to promote the conrenience 
of the pofleflor. Had the difibrent endofores been laid oat 
as much as was poflible in te£bngnlar fignres, and fenced 
with thorn-hedges, inftead of ftone and turf fences, thej* 
would have been both more beautiful and advantageous. 
For though at the upper end of this holm an embank- 
ment was ereded above ten years ago, which prevents die 
Ken from overflowing a confiderable part of the holm next 
to the high lands, as it formerly did, yet there is ftill a 
confiderable part of it, which is often overflowed, and then 
' the crop is in the utmoft danger of being fwept away bjr 
the deluge. Thorn hedges woold have prevented the crop 
from being carried away by a flood, and would have been 
fufScient fences to the different enclofnres ; fo that if an j 
one of, the pofleflbrs had been at more pains than die refty 
to enrich and prepare a field for fown grals, he might have 
reaped the produce himfelf, without being ezpofed to the 
encroachments of hb neighbours ; whereas the ftone and 
turf fences are infuflicient to fecure this advantage; for be* 
fides being too weak and low to ftop every kind of cattle, 
they are liable to be daihed down and fwept away by the 
floods ; and thus are rather hurtful than beneficial to the 
pofleflbr, though he pays for them a high rate of intereft, 
and is bound to keep them up, or at leaft to leave them fo 
at the end of his leafe. Hence it is evident, that if the 
different enclofnres were fuflidently fenced with thorn- 
hedges, they would be far more valuable to the pofleflbrs, 
by faving them the ezpenfe of herdmen, preferving their 
paflore from their neighbours cattle, and afibrding them an

or more, there are fome natural woods of confideraUe ex«

caafe it was fome time a hunting feat of the Earl of Both* 
wdl, the huiband of Queen Mary, is far the largeft. Here 
are alio fome plantations of fir, feveral of which are very 
old and ftately. Above this are thofe of Todfton, Cleugh, 
Glenhold, and Amdarroch. At Ardoch, which is above 
a mile diftant from the river, there are fome excellent trees, 
both natural and planted. It is much to be regretted, that 
the greateft part of the pafture-farms, towards the north 
and eaft, have no woods or plantations to ihelter the cattle* 
The principal river in this parifli is the Ken, which takes 
its rific near the northern extremity of it, and running fouth 
weft 8 or 9 miles, parts it from Carsiairn till it meets with 
the Deugh, which divides Cairsfaim almoft into two equal 
parts, of which that between the Ken and Deugh was taken 
firom Dairy. There, taking a new diredion, it runs almoft 
ibath till it meets with a rivulet from Kells, called Palhar- 
ron. Thence it runs nearly fouth-eaft, with many beautiful 
windings tiU it meets with the Garpod, a rivulet which, for 
aconiiderable way, is the boundary between this pariih and

the water below, repeating this unavailing labour till thejr 
are quite ezhaufled with fatigue. The Black-water, and 
the bums of Earlfton, and of Stronriggan, are the only ri- 
- Yulets worth mentioningin the parilh, and they all abound in 
trout. The lakes or lochs in the parifli contain excellent 
trout, and are much reforted to by fifliers. Thofe of Bof- 
ton, Knockfling and Knockman, are but finall. That of 
Lochinvar is of confiderable extent, fcarce lels than three 
miles in circuit, and containing an area of jo acres. 

jfntijuities, ifc, — ^In Lochmvar, we fee the remains of 
an old building with bridges, faid to have been a caftle be- 
longing to the Gordons, anciently knights of Lochinvar, 
and lately Vifcounts of Kenmure. Not much above a mile 
# from this loch, there is a large pile of fiones covered with 
a kind of whitifli mofs, which has therefore probably got 
the name of the White Cairn, and no doubt, like many- 
others in Scotland, has been in ancient times a burial place. 
At a fmall difiance from this, is another of fmaller fize, 
which however is faid not to be a fepulchre of the human 
fpecies, but a monument or trophy of an heroic atchieve- 
ment performed by the iirft knight of Lochinvar, who on that 
very fpot had the good fortune to kill a wild boar which in- 
feiled that part of the country. At that period the kings . 
of Scotland were wont to bellow fome iignal honour or re« 
ward on any perfon, who could give evidence that he had 

killed

felves in the Bogie, which commwiicatet with the Der- 
ron, and along with it, rum into the Murray Frith mt 
Banff — Frcfoi the high fituation of Kenethmoht, it is na- 
tural to ponclude, that the air is good, and the climate 
healthy ; and experience ooQfirms the canclnfidu. In win- 
ter, the air is frequently piercing, and the finow fomctinies 
deep \ but in winter, as wdl as in fummer, the people in 
general enjoy good health, and jnany attain to oM age. 
They are not fubjeft to epidemic difeafes. The influenza^ 
which, not many years ago, prevailed over the greateft 
part of Britain, was unknown here. And equally fortu- 
nate have they been fince the above period, in efcaping 
putrid (ore throats, and dangerous fevers, which broke 
out in the neighbourhood, and proved fatal to many. Of 
uncommon longevity, I can produce no inSance. It may, 
however, be mentioned, that MefT. Garrioch and Gordon, 
my predeceiTors, both died of old age. The former offici* 
ated 10 years at Forbes, and 50 at Kenethmont; and 
the latter, 7 years at Gabrach, and 40 at Kenethmont. 
And during my incun^bency , which laded above x i years, 
there died 16 or 17 perfons above 80 years of age. 

Heritont Agriculture^ Sir.— :Thcre arp 4 heritors or 
proprietors of lanjl *, the Duke of Gordon, Colonel Hay of 
Ilannrs, Mr Grordon of Wardhoufe, and Mr Wcmyfs of 
jCraighall. The three laft generally refide, and direft 
their attention to the improvement of agriculture, rearing 
of cattl^. or pLmtations. Some of the heritors have intro- 
duced the modern improvements of agriculture, and ndfe 
excellent crops of grain and fown grafs. They have their 
fi Ida divided into convenient enclofures, and kept in high 
cultivation. But their example has not been hitherto imi- 
tated by their tenants, who in general perfevere in the old 
method of farming. The part of the £u7n fit for cropping

eonfiRs of infield and outfield. The former hsA its nAmo 
from being kept under condnual culture ; and ^he latter, 
from being allowed to go to ley or pafture, zfUtt- bearing- 
a certain number of crops. Of the infield, one-thiHi'is an- 
nmll J prepared for bear* and two-thirds are laid down 
with oats. The third intended for bear received a fallow- 
ing in aatnmn, and remains in thatfiate till fpring, when 
it is harrowed, manured, and gets the feed furrow. 'Af- 
ter reaping the bear, this field is und^rftooJ to be in a ftate 
of culture, capable of yielding tv^o ci'ops of oats fucdsf- 
firelj. Eadi of the other two-thirds, in its turn, under- 
goes a fimilar preparation, and is expfeded to make the 
lame returns. Of the outfield, there are two forts, a 'bet- 
ter and a worfe. One half of each is generally in ley, and 
the other under tillage. The better fort ufually remains 
in a flate of reft for 5 years, and is prepared fqr cropping, 
by watering, liming, folding, or pafturing; adding to 
this lad method, if it can be fpared, a little manure of 
any kind. With this preparation, it is judged fit for 
breaking up and bearing 4 or 5 crops of oats in fucceffion. 
Inftead of the common Scotch oats, when a field has been 
limed or watered, it is not unufual to fow it with barley 
oats, which are reckoned 10 days or a fortnight earlier. 
The worfe fort of outfield receives a ploughing early in 
fiimroer, and remains in that ftate till towards feed- time, 
when it gets a fecond ploughing, and is fown with a fmall 
black hairy oat. This is a bad unproduflive grain, not 
much ufed ; and, with proper culture, might eafily be dif- 
penfed with, and totally extirpated. By the above mode 
of cultivation, the average produce of the bear may be 
5 returns, of the common and barley oats 4, and of the 
imall black oats 3. Turnips and potatoes have, for many 
years, been cultivated by the heritors with great fuccefs, 
9Dd the tenants raife a few of each fort for family ufe only.

not gathered in before ChrifVmas. The crop was remarkably deficient, 
and ■ any would have fnfTered in the oc rth of Scotland, had not the aid 
of Oovernment, atid the exertions of the opulent add humane afforded a 
Icafonable fupply to tho needy. By the iaiiure of the crop in this paiiih.

number of days in feed-time^ mois-time, and harrefi. 
Now, fubftantial redreis of this grievance will not be ea-

altogether, which would depopulate their lands ; or, which 
would be better policy, to break their farms and put tlie 
cottagers in the envied date of fmall but independent te*

to, is as eztenfive, and more feverely felt than the for- 
mer. The proprietor, unle&amp; his eftate be very fmalli re- 
quires only a part, never the full extent of the fervices due

the fmalleft fervice for which the cottager is bound.

been eftabli(hed| a number of families of all ages are em-

knit woollen (lockings, and fpin flax. The knitters, on 
an average, work 6o dozen, at las. the doaen, every

^HE vrord Kiniore is certsdoly Gaelic. I am not ac- 
quainted with that language, but am informed, that it 
%iifies *' the head of the wood/' and it is certain, that in the 
tulieft times, there was a royal foreft in this neighbour-

hft oenturj, being the firft feat of the family of Kititore, 
KH calkd Hall-foreft, remains in ruins indeed, but a ruin, 
that Jhows it once to have been a fortified and ftrong place. 
The foreft is iaid to have extended from the weft part of the 
ptfiih of Kintore, eaftward to the church of Dyce, j or 6 
£ii^fli miles. Dyce was in the earlieft times, called the

on the other, lies along the haughs of the Don, are flat ; the 

rijing is gradual to the W. and S. W. to the N. and to the

Irer nms fo flow, that it has more the appearance of a kdce 
than a torrent. In a flood, the river 15 fometimes more 
than a mile broad. I'hough thefe floods enrich the ibtl, 
thej often mud the grals and hart the crop ; and if thej hap* 
pen after xhe ear is formed, and before it comes out, they 
totally deftroy it. The great flood that was on the xyth 
of September 1 768, carried away the. moft of the crop, it 
being all cut down, and but little of it led off from the 
haugh. The town is alfo in apparent danger of the river 
breaking in upon it, efpeciaUy when ihoals of ice come down, 
which cut the deep banks. Yet the many turnings and 
windings of the river, both make a pleaiant profpeft, and 
moifien and enrich that large traft of haugh. llie hill of 
Creechy and Thainftown, on the N. W. is the higheft 
ground in the parifli, more than 100 £eet above the bed of 
the river at the top ; firoai that there runs foothward be- 
tween Kbtore and Kemnay, a ridge of hills, little lower ^ 
and at the fouth extremity of the pariih, almoft at right 
angles, a ridge turns eaft ward, and terminates at a place called 
Wardhoufe. Near the river, the foil is a rich loam, but 
mixed with fand, and gradually in going from the river 
weftward, it becomes of worfe quality. More than half of 
the parifli is covered with a fiout dry heath, and in the 
places at a fmall diftance from the town, the arable fields y 
are furrounded by heath, not fix inches long. The naarfhyr 
farms, have their foil in many places black, partaking of 
the nature of the adjacent peat-mo(s. 

Rivers and Mills* — ^The Don is the only river which 
touches this pariih ; it bounds the pariih on the N. W. 
N. N. E. and partly on the E. It produces falmon, which 
are caught both by the net and rod, and are fold from 4 d. 
the ^und in the fpring, to ad. in fummer. It produces

thefe are fekiom fold. A ftream rifes in the maribj parts 

of the pariih, and enlarges fo as to have three water-mills in 

its courfe ; for the firil and longeft part of its courfe, it is 

called the Sherrif-burn \ but when it goes on, it is called the 

Cooning-bom, from a burrow of conies that was kept here ; 

and near Kintore, where it falls into the Don, the bum of 

Tuack. There b another mill upon the Don. The moft 

part of the pariih is thirled to a mill ; none now except the 

£mall heritors of Kintore pay multure. Thej pay for fer« 

vice, called knavejbip^ the 33d peck. 

Population. — By the return made to Dr Webfler, die 
nnmber of fouls then, was 830* — No proper account can be 
given of this fubjeft for any time paft, though the people 
formerly were certainly more numerous than at prefent. 
The old pari(h, before the annexation, was faid to contain 
between 700 and 800 fouls ; and about 200 were added by 
the annexed part of the pariih of Kinkell. It contains 
at prefent, including the town, 862 fouls, whereof 392 are ^ 
males, and 470 females. The knitting of ftockings, partly 
accounts for the proportion of females, though that manu- 
fadure is much on the decline, and the price reduced, Cnce 
loom frames have been fo much improved ; and many of 
fte males learn trades, and go to other places, there being 
no tradefman or manufafturer here of any kind, but what 
are necelTary for the work in the pariih. Baptifms in 1792, 
were 13, 8 males and 5 females. Average of births 
for 5 years paft 16, ditto of marriages 6, ditto of deaths, 
or rather burials 14. The air b healthy, and the people 
not much liable to confumptions, fevers, or epidemical 
diftempers. ^ Many of the inhabitants live till between 80 
and 93. One farmer lately held his plough, till feveral 
yean above 80.

pariiii (ezclufive of the to^n) io6 horfes, 800 blade cat* 
tie, and near 2500 flieep. One verj inteUigeot &amp;r- 
mer has, fer more than 20 years* given an excellent exam- 
ple of improTiftf( his land, by bringing in barren patches^ 
ditchingv draining, liming, raifing turnip^ fowing gralst 
fee. and his neighbours, who were not much difpofed to 
fellow the earlieft improvers in the pariih of Kinellar, that 
had other means of living than by their farms, are now be- 
ginning to fee the benefit of following his example. A. 
better kind of plough is introduced, and carts, which 40 
years ago were unknown, are now generally ufed inflead of 
creels and packets and curracks, as they were called, which 
£d little work, with more oppreflion to man and horfe. 
There is another farmer in the pariih that occupies a farm, 
(on which 10 oxen and a proportional number of horfes 
were formerly ufed)r, without any family or fervicc, but 
himfelf and a houfekeeper. He alone manages a [dough 
with four horfes and two cattle, on a farm abounding with 
rocks and great (tones, carries a fpade in his plough, and 
inakes work that is far from bad ; and he thre flies, dries, 
and manages his grain himfelf. There is no manure in the 
pariih but dung and a mixture of foils, to which they now 
add lime frdm Aberdeen. * The chief produdions are oats, 
barley, pcafe, potatoes, and lately turnip is raifed in confi- 
derable quantities : The advantage of turnip for cleaning 
and improving the ground, and alio for rearing and fatten- 
ing cattle, b now generally known. A confiderable quan- 
tity of oat-meal and barley, above what* the pariih needs, 
is fold every year in Aberdeen, and a great part of the 
rent of the parifli b paid in thefe two articles. There is 
reared and fold every year from this pari(fa, anddriven 
fouth, a number of black cattle ; but this part of the coun* 
try has never been able to raife a fufficient fuppljr of good 
horfes. The price of every thing here, is much the fame

Earl fucceededy had beea in general long out of leafe, and 
coofeqaently little would be done to the houfes ; but fince* 
in r782, he gave new leafes, farmhoufes have been much 
improved ; for this he gives encouragement ; but a num* 
her of fiibtenants or cottagers have been removed, from an 
apprehenfion of the molTes wearing out. The old parifh is 
better provided in fuel than the new part, which has no

May ; but the earlier in that time the better, as often frofts aod mildews

from die beginning of Auguft to the middle of O^ber. Turnip gene- 
rally is Ibwn about the longeft day. In Ibme bad feafons, the harveft is 
better. The pariih has fufTered much from thefe : in 1732, harveft was 
sot done in November, and in I7t^3 the bad feed made a very fcanty crop ; 
bnt in T790, had there not been plenty in fome of the neighbouring 
pariflies, this parilh wonld have fuffered much more by a thunder fiona 
that happened npon the 30th of July, accompanied with ince6Suit ihpwera 
of oncommooly large hailftones pointed, and many of them meafuring % 
iaches round. They fell in foch quantities as to cover the ground in « 
great part of this parifh» (or -more than 14 houn, and it was more than Z 
days before they were all diflblved. The hail covered a tnA of country^

the paiifhes of Midmar «id Clunie, on the weft, coming over fome pait 
of Monymoft the mofsof Kenmay, and of this parifh, andfpending itfeif

this parifh, and eome to the moor between this and Kinellar ; the largeft 
dirifioo turned down the Don to Fintmy, and a fmaller tucaed t^a the 
pariih of Kinellar. It did little damage in that parUht except where the 
Urge brandi came over their haughs. This hail, with the Craft that n»

Pricf ef Lalettr, — ^Thc waf^es of common niechanicks, who only work 
for the neighbourhood, is much the ftme as in other pariflies already pu- 
bliflied. Day labourers get 6d. in fummer, and 4d. in winter, befides 
▼idluals : it is not many years fince 6 d. and even 5 d. aday without vic- 
tuals, were their wages. The wages of fann-fervanu have increafed rapid- 
ly for ibme years paft. A fenrant, who two years ago would have a(ked 
little more than L. s a year, for the moft laborious part of a &amp;rraer*s 
work, nowa(ks from L. 8 to L. fo. This it is known, proceeds partly from 
the great demand for fenrants, to maaufadlurers and to undertaker^ for 
different branches of work / but it is chiefly owing to the humour that for 
fome time pad has prevailed among landed gentlemen, for turning out cot- 
tagers. It is acknowledged, that country cottagers are the feed of fer 
vants, and their fituation more favourable for health, induftry, and good 
morals, than a fituation in the vicinity of a great town ; and where a 
•country is much depopulated of them, the deamefs and fcarcenefs of la- 
bourers to work, moft be felt firit indeed by the farmers, but muft foon be 
felt by the landed gentlemen themfelves, in hindering the increaie of their 
rents, and even bringing them down, and impeding the improvement o^ 
their land. Indeed the prefent wages, and maintenance of fenrants, are 
much more than the rent of many of our fanners. This makes it the more 
neceflary to take off" the mod impolitic duty upon the coal ; taking that 
off, would foon increafe the revenue, by increafing the number of people 
who pay taxes, for it would encourage gentlemen to have their eftatee 
better peopled again ; and it would render the work about peats moilly 
unneceflary, which is at prefent the whole fummer-work of moft fanners, 
and it would enable them to employ their labour and horieSy more ufe- 
liiUy, in improving their farms ; and I would not wonder, if purchafing 
coal were in the power of crofters, to hear foon of heritors, in their leafes 
tbltging their tenants to keep fo many famiUcs of cottagers.

Fore/h. — There have not been for fome centuries, any 
remains of the old forefts, only large trunks of black oak 
have been often found in the river and kaugh ; the mofles 
abound with fir, and oak roots very large are found in the 
neighbourhood. A large plantation of fir and other wood 
planted near the cafile of Hall Forefi, in the memory of mn- 
ny perfons yet alive, is now all cut down and the ground 
planted again \ the fir wood of it was reckoned the befl of 
our low country wood, and the prefent Earl of Kintore, 
fmce he came to the eflate and honours in 1778, has plant- ' 
ed a large foreft of feveral hundred acres, and there are two 
confiderable plantations of Scotch fir, well grown, on the

• Kama cf P/aees. — Tic old names of places are gep^rally Gaelic, 
iiich as Creechic, Tillibin, Drumoalieatb, Blairs, Anquhiten, Dalwearic, 
and probably Tavelty, the old toad to Aberdeen, called the RufliUch, 
part of the prcftnt rbad called the Skair, the fordr of Tillikae and Pit- 
ctirn, with many names of Sclds. Oii the extremity and'top of an hill 
bordering with Skene, is Wardhomfe, an Englilh name, which, though it 
has no veflig^ of a camp, nor of an houfe better than ordinar}-, hat pro. 
bably had a watch and guard kept on it in perilous times ; for this, the 
fituatlon dcfcribcd before, renders it very proper, cfpecially, as it ftands' 
po ground nearly as high as any in the parilh, and has an exteniive pro-

.Antiqtttiies and VCrflditions. — I (hall for the fake of pre- 
ferration give all the traditions that 1 have learned, howv- 
ever unimportant fome of them may appear. I have alrea- 
dy medtioned the Foreft, and the Caftle of Hall Foreft, 
which has been very ancient. A part of this foreft with ^ 
the caftle, was given by King Robert Bruce to Robert de 
Keith, Great Marifchal of Scotland, after the battle of 
Banoockhnm, and it remains in the hands of his dcfcen* 
daat the Earl of Kintore to this day, having been difpo. 
ned in the laft century by the Earl Marifchal to his fon or 
farocbcr Sir John Keith, who was afterward created Eafl 
of Kintore. It may be conjedured, that a part of what 
was given to the Marifchal, was bounded by the Sheriff* 
bmn, which feparated it from the reft of the ihire ; f6r,

Afi/ceSaneous OhftrvatUm. — ^Thc people lare in general 
peaceable, and not given to feuds or divifions, charitable 
and isdufirious, flrangers to luxury and vice ; and in the 
Roy^l Burgh, not much given to political fpeculations. 
There are onlj two public houfes or taverns in the parifli, 
and thefe are neceflarj in Kintoce for the great north road. 
The advantages of the parifli are, good foil near the river, 
cafily managed, and producing crops without manure ; the 
fobriety and indufiry of the people, and accefs to Aberdeen, 
die principal market, not being ^ifiScult, and that there 
are few fervices^* or what is called bondage, required* 
The diCidvantages are thefe already pointed out, from the 
overflowing of the river, nearnefs to Aberdeen, raifing 
wages more than in places at a diftance, ihort leafes, none 
of them above 19 years, though the heritors are not difpc^ 
fed to remove their tenants* It is laid, the entail upon the 
lands of Kintore refirids from giving longer leafes than 
19 years. Improper divifion of farms is likewife a^difad* 
▼antage, rents not being exaftly proportioned, and that 
there is in many farms a want of (locking, owing to the po- 
verty of the farmers. — If there are any mines in this coun- 
try, they muft be of Iron, for all mineral fprings here are 
impregnated with iron-ore, and fome of our ftones are co- 
loured by the water ; yet the flones here are generally of 
Hat beft granite. Outliers, as they are called, abounding 
in quantity, are more ufed than quarries, becaufe they are 
both more eafily got at, and taking them away, clears the 
ground. — There are few DilTenters from the Eftabliflied 
Church in the pariOi, only 2 families of Nonjurors, and 
I of Seceders. The living and drefs of the country -people 
are much better within the laft fifty years, and even fince

His lands have been mofilj in his own pofleffioo, fince he 
^porchafed the eftate. The greateft part of them is endofed 
with fubftantial flone fenoes, and in a high ftate of cultiva- 
tion. He has lately let one of his farms, at L. a, 2 s. the 
acre, another at L. i, xos. and a third at L. x, 10 s. Cap- 
tain Laifd has erefied a good dwelling-hoofe, where the an- 
cient fiibric reared its head. The oflkes and garden are 
at a diftance from the houfe. He has enclofed 200 acres of 
the moor, called Clatto, in the fouth end of the parifli, 
with an earthen fence : 5c acres of it have been planted 
with aih, elm, &amp;c. which will in a little time relieve the 
eye, that has been a long time hurt by the black heath. 
150 acres of this moor are defigned for a farm ; and ex- 
cellent offices have been ereded on it. Qn a lew acres of 
this farm, which were pioughed laft feafon, a good crop of 
turnips has been raifed. Thirteen old houfes have 
been dcmoliflied, on the eftate of Strathmartin, fince 
the year 1785. Eight fubftantial houfes have been built 
on or near their fites, each of which might contain 2 fmall 
&amp;milies; they are covered with flate or tile. Several 
new houfes have been ereded for tradefmen, and a good 
houfe for a brewer, with a brewhoufe, malt-bam, kiln 
and bal^houfe. Mr Walter Ogilvie of Tulledaph^hall, 
has qiade very confiderable improvements on that eftate. 
He ha^ enclofed a great part of his lands, with excellent 
ftone fences, and built fome good houfes for his tenants. 
His farms are let from L. i to L. 2 the acre. People 
who underftand the art of farming doubt if the produce

by the heritors, for the plough and wain. Horfes which 
were bought twenty years ago from L. 7 to L. 1 2, now 
coft firom L. 15 to L. 25. A confiderable number of cat- 
tle, fince turnips began to be raifed, have been fed, and 
Hold not only by the heritors, but alfo by the farmers. 
Calves have begun to be reared in abundance, for the mar- 
ket, and farmers ufe. No flieep are kept in the parilh, ex- 
cept a few for private ufe, though formerly almoft every 
fsffmcr had a flock. The ground produces good oats, bar- 
ky and peafe. The manure ufed here, is lime from Fife, 
brought to Dundee by water, marl from the mires of 
Anchtexlioufe parifii, and compofis of dung and earth. 
There are fome excellent (lone quarries in the parilh* 

Watery Bridges and JfsSr.-^The rivulet, commonly called 
Dtghty water, which has Its fource in Lundie parifh, and 
nms into the frith of Tay, glides through the middle of this 
pacilh. Some fine bum-trouts, and a few pikes and perches 
of a middle fize, are to be found in it ; they abound moil 
in fpring, but are never caug^ for fale. By the exertions 
of that public fpirited gentleman, David Laird of Strath- 
martin, 2 bridges have been thrown over Dighty, one on the 
road leading from Ghmmis to the Carfe of Gowry, and the 
other on the road from Sidlaw-hill to Dundee. A bridge has 
likewife been built of late over Dighty, to the eaftward, at 
the expenfe of the corporation of bakers in Dundee. Ther6 
are 10 mills in the parifh ; a corn mills, I flour, i barley,

too fmall for the accommodation of a family. The offices

is too fmall a living for a clergyman, who has a numerous

thus the education of youth is negleded : a remedy for 
this evil has long been defired.— The poor are maintained 
by the weekly coUe£Hons, which amount to % s. or 3 s.

There are 340 fonis in the parifli. The people in general 
are quiet, peaceable, and well difpofed. In the parifli, are 
2 Antiburghersy and i Epifcopalian. Since the year 177O1 
the wages of men-fervants, maid-fervants, and day labour* 
exs are nearly doubled, owing to the flourifliing ftate of ma- 
nofadnres and improvements in agriculture, in this neigh- 
bourhood. There is a remarkable alteration to the better, 
in the drefi of the parifliioners, fince the year 1780. 

Aniiquuies. — On the weft fide of Cktto-moor, are the 
traces of a camp. It is generally believed to have been 
occupied by a part of Agricola's army, and afterward by 
Alpin, Wallace, and Monk. Tradition reports, that ** Wal- 
^ hce pitch'd his camp on Clatto-hill, and ground his com 
^ at Philaw's mill," which is about half a mile from the 
place where the traces of the camp are feen. To the eaft- 
ward of Strathmartin houfe, there is a hiU, called the Gal- 
low-hiU, on which the Lairds of Strathmartin, in the days 
of feudal tyranny, exercifed their power in hanging for 
petty oSences. In the north end of the parifli is a large

THE iinioo of tbie pari(hes of liff and Bervie took place 
in Nov. 1758. Liff comprehended the old pariihes 
of Logie and Invergowrie ; both of which, as appears from 
the records of the kirk-feffion, were united to it before the 
middle of the laft century. But Logie, quoad facra^ has from 
the £uDe remote period, belonged to the parilh of Dundee, and

the interfefiions of the neighbouring pariihes, the form o 
liff and Bervie is very irregular. It may be reckoned, oi 
an average, 3 miles in length, and the lame nearly ii 
breadth. The appearance of the furface is in general high 
ly pleafing. The ground rifes with an eafy afcent for tkc 
fpace of 3 miles from the river Tay, except towards the 
S. E. where the end of the hill of Bolgjty^ which is very 
moderate in height, and either wholly planted or cultiva- 
ted, and a low narrow dale, extending from thence weft- 
ward through the village of Bervie, intervene. Along 
this agreeable expofure, are interfperfed houfes, trees, and 
fields in culture. The higher grounds form, as it were, a 
ridge, ftretching fomewhat obliquely from W. to E. Be- 
hind thefe, is a bleaks extenlive trad of moor, where are 
fome thriving plantations of fir, but hardly any mark of 
improvement or cultivation. This moor falls northward 
in gradual declivity,, and forms, with the oppofite grounds, 
part of that Strath or valley, which beginning in the parifh 
of Lundie, and extending eaftward a few miles, is called 
Strathmartin, an appellation given to one of the pariflies 
adjoining this diflrift. In the middle of thb ftrath, runs 
a fmall and rapid ilream from the loch of Lundie, which 
meets an additional fupply, colleded here from the bills 
above Auchterhoufe, and is then called the water of Digh- 
ty. This brook is the northern boundary of thcfe united 
pariflies, dividing them from Auchterhoufe, and is nearly 
parallel to the courfe of the Tay, the principal boundary

diflempeis. The air is pure and wholefome, owing in a 
great meafore to the ebbing and flowing of the Tay on one 
fide, and the ground riiing from it to a confiderable height 
OQ the other. In one low and confined fpot, occupied 
chieflj by manufadorers» few or no difeafes appear, that 
are not common in the mofi healthy fituations. Among the 
oldeft inhabitants, is a married couple, w\iofe joint ages 
make X75, and who have lived together 59 years. There 
are many of both fexes in this difirid, whofe lives are pro-

the coontry, owing principally to the want of good and 
comfortaUe accommodation among the poorer clais of peo* 
pic, are not more prevalent in this than in other quarters, 
where the fame proportion of the people lead fedentary 
lives. Nay, many perfons from Dundee, of delicate and 
fickly confiitutions, have found their health greatly impro- 
ved by a few months reiidence here in fummer ; and there 
can be no doubt, that the chill wind and damp vapours 
from the eaft, which prove fo unfriendly to the redoration 
of health, are le&amp; fenfibly felt here, than in places more 
immediately adjoining the mouth of the nver. In all ca-

Po^£i/fo«.— According to Dr Webfter*s report, the num- 
' ber of fouls at that time was 1311. The number of inha* 
bitants at prefient in the weft part of this diArift, compared 
with the amount of the whole, bears no fort of proportion 
to what it did at the beginning of this century, nor even 
within a much ihorter period. Two oppofite canfes hare 
united to produce this remarkable diftrence : ift. The ali- 
enation of the lands belonging to the feuars of Liff-, and« 
afly. The late introdudion, and rapid increafe of manu- 
fiBi£hires, to be afterwards explained, particularly in the enft 
(juarter of this diftriA. The lands of Liff were part of an 
endowment to the monaftery of Scoon, and appear to have 
been fcued out by the commendator of that monaftery into 
eight parts, about the time of the Reformation. This bid 
the foundation of a village, formerly denominated the 
Kirkton of Liff, which from limdry particulars in the fief- 
fion-record, but more efpecially from comparing the num- 
ber of elders in it, widi diofe in the other divifions of the 
parifh united, appears to have contained in 1650, one third 
at leaft of the whole inhabitants, who, it is obfervable, ac- 
cording to a report made by the minifter about that time 
to the preftytery of Dundee, amounted to 400 and up- 
wards. This village continued to increafe, and was in a 
flourifhing ftate until fome time after the beginning of the 
prefent century, when almoft the whole of thefe lands 
in fen, came into the poffeifion of a principal heritor, and

they are feldom to be had for lefs than fifty. Milch cows 
are very numerous, every family almofi, whether with or 
)¥ithout land in their poiTcilion, having one or ^ore of 
tbem. No attention is paid, efpecially by the poorer fort 
of people, to their breed, and in general they are of a di- 
fniftotive fize. Their number may amount to 382. In 
Locheye and Milehoule alone there are about 117 for the 
nfe of the families in that quarter. But neither there, nor 
in one or two places more of this diftrift, are thecoma and 
horfies maintained by the produce of the land in pofleifion 
of their refpe&amp;ive owners. A very confiderable ihare of 
the provifion neceflary for them is porchafed trom the 
neighbouring fiinners, who find it their intereft often to 
anfwer demands of this (brt, by expofing to lale in diffis* 
rent lots, one or more fields of ilanding com, grais, or tur« 
nip, as they can beft fpare of each. In thb way it happens^ 
that in fome years a confiderable quantity of oats and bar- 
ley is brought from neighbouring parilhes into this diflrif^, 
but this is nothing equivalent to the difFerent kinds of 
grain, and of barley efpecially fold out of it. The yearly 
amount of what is thus difpofed of^ cannot be accurately af- 
certained ; it is, however, certain that, nnleis in years of 
extnordittary fbarcity, this diflrift will do far more than

weaver being for the mofi part Tupplied with that article 
from Dundee. Some of the cloth manufadured is fold by 
individuals at firil hand, at Dundee and Inchture ; but the 
quantity thus fold does not amount to more than is pur* 
phafed by the merchant weavers in this diftrift, from neigh- 
bouring parifliesy who, therefore, may be faid to deal to the 
lextent of the whole cloth manufadured here. The mer- 
chant weavers are 5 in number, and are themfelvcs included 
in the lift of operative mannfafturers. All of them, one 
excepted, who buys to the greateft eattent, difpofe of their 
whole ftock either in Dundee or Perth, or Cupar of An- 
gus, prefierring a fmaller gain at home, to the rifle of a 
greater in the hands of correfpondents at London. Almoft 
half of their cloth is bleached before it is fold^ and of late 
they have adopted the method, of what is termed here dry^ 
bUacbing^ which is nothing more than after boiling the 
ploth in water, mixed with a due quantity of pot-aihes, to 
wafli the lees from it, and leave it to whiten on the ground 
by the adion of the fun and weather, without, as former- 
ly, fprinkling water upon it. The cloth by this means is 
equally well bleached, and much labour as well as expenfe 
is faved. The following is a pretty accurate flatement of

they are commonly fold by the manufaflurers.

Of the above webs, 2830 were bleached, and la that (late 
being fit for (hirting and roanj important ufes, the profit at 
{econd hand is more confiderable than that on the green or 
unbleached.' Confidering the number o£ weavers who are 
houfeholders, and that feveral among them keep i or 2 
lervants, or more properly apprentices, it may perfeaps be 
ezpeded, that a third more cloth at lead (houM be manu- 
fadured in the year within thb diftrift. In reply, this much 
may be obferved, that fome of thefe houfeholders are a^ an 
advanced period of life, that the greater part have more 
or leis to do of rural labour on their fmall poITelfions, and 
that many quit their own employment entirely, and en- 
gage with the neighbouring farmers, in the time of har veft. 
It would tend greatly to promote and encourage manufac- 
tures here, were a ilamp -office eftabliihed as at Inchture

hiftory of Scotland, which« from its vicinity to the frith of

both the land and fea forces. There were obvious traces 
of this camp remaining a very few years ago, which the 
plough has fince entirely effaced. The fpot, however, is

with any certainty of its original dimenfions, but it has evi- 
dently been of confiderable fajt and ftrength, and furromid-

foflS. In digging about the remains, burnt alhes were found 
and an iron fpur, of the kind long ago worn. It was built

refifled the plough, in paffing along the fpot under whiclx

extremely rude. Many of the ftones that compofed it, in- 
ftead of being laid flat, or in fuch a way as accords with 
(kill in the art of building, were placed endwife in the 
walls. There were no arches, though the feveral compart-

wardly, and the opening or vacuity between covered all 
the way, witb others of a correfponding breadth. At the

placed fo irregularly with refped to one another, and with 
:o little appearance of regard to order or method, unleis in 
fo far as that each (hould communicate with the larger 
and principal one* that nothing could be inferred from 
their relative fituation to one another. On the compart-

rich black mould, which, whether it had been purpofely 
depofited there, or m the courfe of generations pad, had 
iDfinaated itfelf from the fur£ice above, through the cover-

they appeared to be much worn, had no doubt been ufed 
for grinding com of fome kind, although they had beeii 
made with fo little dexterity, that it is not eafy to conceive

ObttTcby Manfi^ Stipend^ School^ Poor^ l^c. — The prcfcnt 
church -fabric, except the aifle, which in every view ought 
either to have been raifed higher or rebuilt, was erefted in 
1774, to accommodate the inhabitants, and refts nearly on 
the foundation of the former building. Either the founda- 
tions muft have given way, or the mafon-work been 
flightly executed, as fome rents already appear • in the . 
walk. When the bulk of the inhabitants refided in the 
weft part of the diftrift, the fituation of the church was 
then mdre convenient. The manfe, which is placed a 
little ' way from the church, is alfo modern, and was 
built aboilt the time when thefe pariflies were united in 
1759— i7tSo. It is a handfome building, but the roof 
is much decayed, and the infide work very fuperficial, 
and by ncr means correfponding with the outiide appear* 
ance. It (lands about 297 feet above the high water mark 
at Invergourie, and commands a varied and delightful pro- 
fpeS, comprehending the Tay in its courfe for fevera^ 
miles, with a well clothed, fertile tra&amp; of country on the 
one fide of it, and the tteepy boundary of Fife on the other. 
The ftipend is 7 chalders vidual, and money about L. 53 
Sterlingp including L. 8, 14 s. which is no part of the teinds 
of this diftrift, but of a grant conjointly to two other mi- 
ni&amp;ers and the minifter of Bervie. The glebe and garden 
contain about 10 acres* Heritors, comprehending thofe of 
Logie parifli, 9. The whole valued rent L. 6680 Scot9. 
—The average number of fcholars at the parochial fchool 
does not exceed 35. The fituation is centrical enough 
with refpeft to the whole difiiriA, but yet not very com- 
modious for one or two places, which contain by far, com- 
paratiTcly, the greater number of the inhabitants. Be-

the firft of which it were diflkult to remedy, are chiefly to 
be alcribed the low ftate of the parochial ichool, and the

I7 taught. At the formeri the quarterly payments are, 
for Engliih, xs. 6 d. ; for writing, a s. ; for arithmetic, a s.

for baptilms and marriages. The whole emoluments are 
too inconfiderable for a teacher of any merit and capacity. 
-—With refpefi to the poor, there has never been any a£. 
feflment for their maintenance. The funds for their relief 
arile from the dues of mortdoths, proclamation of marria- 
ges, rents of a few feats in the church, money at interefi, but 
chiefly from the colleftions at the churdi door. Befides the 
number now on the roll, amounting to xa, there are leveral 
families and individuals which require occafional fupply.

on the eftates of Lord Gray and Colonel Duncan of Lun.

highly beautiful, and certainly do honour to the tafte of 
that acGompliihed nobleman, John Lord Gray, by whom 
they were laid out. The diftriA abounds with what is 
here called freefione, but in ftrata ; the prevailing colour 
is givyt incliniog to blue. Some grey flate has been 
found, but very little whinflone. A proper pier at Inver-

<p>Name^ Extent^ lie. 

TT ENNOWAT is fiud to take its name from its fitua- 
-^^ tion. The church and village are built along the top 
or height of a very beautiful and romantic den ; the fides 
of which are fteep and rocky, and contain fome caves, 
which the feuars and inhabitants ufe as pigeon-houfes. Of 
this particular fituatton, the name is (aid to be ezpreiBve, 
Kennoway fignifying in the Gaelic, " The town above the 
^ cave/' Its form is nearly an oblong fquare ; its length 
from £. to W. about 3 miles ; its breadth about 2. The 
church and village are placed in the S. £. comer of the 

fquare.

fquare. The whole parifli lies on a bank, afcending from 
S. to N. : the profpeft from almoft ^rvery part is extenfiv^c 
and beautiful, commanding' a diftind view of the ifland of 
May, of the Bads, of Inch Keith, of the (hipping on the 
Forth, from which it is diftant about a miles ; of the coaft 
S. of the Forth from Dunbar, to the W. of Edinburgh ; of 
the Lammer moor hills, Slc. From the N* part of the 
parifli, which reaches the top of the bank, there is one of 
the moft exteniive views imaginable, taking in not only 
the forcmentioned profpeft to the S. but comprehending al- 
moft all Fife, and a great part of the counties of Angiis, 
Perth, Stirling, the Grampian mountains, &amp;c. 

Soil^ Climate. — The foil is all arable, and generally fer- 
tile, coniifting on the S. of a light loam, which in fome 
places approaches to fand and gravel, and on the N. of 
loam and clay ; the crops are both rich and early, particu- 
larly on the S. The air is dry and wholefome, and many 
iaftances of longevity have occurred of late. A woman 
died 14 years ago, who remembered to have feen Arch- 
bifliop Sharp at the ^lanfe of K^nnoway, the day before he 
was murdered. Within thefe 7 years, one died whofe fa- 
mily belie ve^ him to be above 100. \ another of 94 for 
certain, and feveral of 90. In the a houfes next to the 
xnanfe, there are 2 men living, the one bom in May 1695, 
the other in July 1700, the oldcft of the two ftill enjoys 
great health and ilrength *.

is one of the difadirantages under which this, and fome of 
tk neighbooring pariihes labour. There are appearances 
cf coal in fieveral parts. Some of it was lately wrought ; but 
as the quality was not very good, nor the feam thick, and 
33 there is great plenty of excellent coal in fevend of the 
ceighboaring pariflies, the mines that had been opened, 
vere fpon abandoned* After this it is unneceflary to add, 
dutthe only fuel ufed in the pariih is coal, and that the 
great plenty of this moil neceflary article, with which the 
Qcigfabourhood abounds, is one of thole advantages which 
it enjoys in common with all the S. coaft of Fife. 

ffipulatum^ ^f.— -According to Dr Webfter's report, the 
population then was 1240. The number of the people and 
^KioSies, feems to have been nearly the fame for centuries. 
I&amp; 1785, the whole inhabitants of the pariih, (of whom the 
v31age contains abojUt one half), amounted, from the age of 
going to (chool, to x2oo, of whom 800 atttended the Eib^ 
bliihed Church, and 400 were Seceders. A Burgher meet- 
ing houfe was ereded in the village, about 40 years ago, 
and all that do not belong to the Eftabliihment, attend that 
meeting, except a very few of the Relief party, for there b 
not a fingle perfon of another perfuafion in the pariih. All 
the hoafes are inhabited, none are allowed to go to ruin, 
aad very few are known to have been built on a new 
^Qoadation. About ao yeas ago, and for fome time be« 
fore, the village exhibited a very ruinou^^ appearance. A 
coofiderable malting buiineis was formerly carried on in it ; 
^e great road, too, between the ferries of Dundee and 
foghorn, pafled through it ; but about 40 years ago, that 
^finels failed, and the road was carried 3 miles to the 
v^ftward. In confequence of thefe events, the malt and

miles of low deep land and meadow, on the bank of the

whether the acquifition would be worth the ezpenfe, which 
behoved to be very great, on accottnt of the great height 
to which Spey rifes at certain times. What increafes the 
difficulty is, the great body of water which, in time of

wterfeds the pari(h, running through or near the fir- 
woods, for above 7 miles, and empties itfelf into the Spej. 
In dry weather, it is very inconfiderable ; but after rains or 
€haws, it fwells fo as to bring down loofe all the timber 
that is cut in the woods, either to the faw*mills or to 
the Spey, whence it is fent in rafts to the fea at Gar- 
moQth. There are feveral lakes in Kinchardine ^ the moft 
confiderable of which, is the oval bafon in Glenmore, near- 
ly two miles diameter. It is in the bottom of the glen, 
furrounded with fir-woods, rififig gradually towards the 
mountains. Here is a pleafant fcene in a fine fummer day. 
In Glenmore likewife, there is a green loch, in extent about 
one acre, fiill of fmall fat green trout. At the foot of Cairn-

regions of cold. Cairngorm commands an extenfive view. 
Rois, Sutherland, and Caithnefs, are feen from it. 

Woods ^ and the Progrefs of ManufaBure. — Befides a 
great deal of birch and alder, there are two very large 
fir-woods in thefe pariflies, almofi meeting in one place. 
The fir-wood of Abcrnethy, belonging to Sir James 
Grant, is of great extent, and of an exceeding good 
quality, and very thriving \ but is kept from coming to 
a great fize, by a conflant manufadure, for about 60 
years backward. Before then, the making of deals by 
faw-milU was little known, and lefs pra&amp;ifed. The firft. 
and early method of making deals, was by fplitting the 
wood with wedges, and then drefiing the boards with the 
ax and adze. A high room in Caflle Grant appears to be 
floored with deals made in this way, and never planed. 
The marks of the adze acro&amp; the boards are ftill vifi*

perfcvere in this, owing to the many difficulties he had 
to encoimter, fncb as the want of roads in the woods, ikill 
in the coontry-fieople, and all kinds of neceflary imple-

at prefent, and cut a paflage through a rock in Spey, witt 
oat which, floating to any extent could never be al 
tempted. Before their time, fome fmall trifling rafts wer 
'lent down Spey in a very awkward and haaardoos mannei 
10 or la dozen of deak, huddled together, conducted by 
man, fitting in what was called a Curraci, made of a hide 
in the ibape, and about the fize of a fmall brewing-kettle 
broader above than below, with ribs or hoops of wood ii 
the infide, and a crols-ftick for the man to fit on ; who 
with a paddle in his hand, went before the raft, to whicb 
his currach was tied with a rope. This rope had a ran^ 
ning-knot or loup round the man's knee in the currach, fa 
that if the raft flopt on a ftone, or any other way, he 
loofed the knot, and let his currach go on, otherwife it 
would fink in a ilrong dream ; and when, after coming in 
behind the raft again, and loofing it, he proceeded again to 
make the heft of his way. Thcfe currachs were fo light, 
that the men carried them on their backs home from 
Speymouih. There is one of them now in the parifli of 
Cromdale below this. The York*bttildin; Company had 
x8 of thefe currachs in their employ at firft, with which 
they made little progrefs, till Mr Aaron Hill, one of 
their number, conftruAed the large raft, as it is at pre* 
fent, confiding of two or three branders of fpars in 
the bottom, joined end to end, with iron or other 
loups, and a rope through them, and coadnfied by two

There were fome inferior companies tried it formerly, but 

vere not fuccefsful. It appears pretty certain now, that 

this Company will fucceed in bringing away all the wood 

within their contrad, before their leafe is out, which was 

16 years V and it ought to be the wifh of every well-think- 

iflg perfon, that they may have profit in the end, as they 

do much good to the country. They are regular and juft, 

and carry on their bufinefs in every department of it with 

mQch exertion and propriety. This was the oldeft, the

^P^Ji by means of the loch before defcribed, that is 

in the heart of it, and out of which a river iflues, that 

brings down even their mafis loofe to Spey, a diftance of 5

fliip-Umber, which they fend to Garmouthi or Speymouth 

Tcarly, is immenfe, and every ftage of the procefs of ma« 

nufaftory, brings money to the country ; generally once a- 

jear, they fend down Spey a loofe float, as they call it, of 

^boQt 11,000 pieces of timber, of various kinds ; whence 

they fend it to England, or fell it round the coall. For

good crofk-road, from Glenmore to the Spej^ Un his £ng-

15 years ago, by Sir James Grrant on the river Neth j, at

What thej complain of chiefly is, the method followed in 
letting their farms when their leafes are expired. It is 
leldoia that the tenants are called on to renew, till within 
a few months of the term of removal, and then perhaps, left 
for years in fnfpence, before they are fettled with, and 
tried for fome addition every year ; and every year recei- 
ving a fnmmons of removal. The ofiers received are gene- 
raOy kept private ; and when they get a leafe, it is only 
for 15 or 19 years, which they think too fhort. The ef- 
fisds of this method are very bad, both for mafter and 
tenant. For during the laft 2 or 3 years of the leaiie, they

both to mailer tnd tenants, i^, That tenants onght to be fettled with, 
at leaft a year before the expiration of their leafed. 2rf, Tliat no pri- 
vate ofTen onght to be admitted at all. They arc' often, when inju- 
dicious, unfafe for the mader and precarioui for the tenant. Becaufe a 
tetiant is at a lofs how to aft, when he'^o^s ncJl* Ivhat is offered by o-

blic roup would be fairer than private offers, becaufe then a perfon fees 
what he is doing. iBefides that when people are prciTed by neceffity, 
or hurried by their paffions, it is dangerous to rely on their offers. The 
method of encouraging people to offer* privately or publicly upon each 
other, is mo^«hurtful.to the very eitence of Chriftianity, by deftroying 
frieo4n«ip and good., will, and introducing much ill will, revenge and 
quarrels. It b common to lie&amp;r of peoples threatening, to. offer for their

CaJttU mariits^^Thc people here, as well as ia many 
parts o£ the Highlands, have hot too much caufe to 

compbdn 

netghboun peflefltom fevenl yetrs before tfaejr expire. In ibort the ill 
temper produced by the(e unlucky interferences, fometiraes lives longter 
than the leafes. It is hird, therefore, to throw unnecef&amp;ry temptatiotis 
in the way of pe^le; and therefore what might remedy all dus and 
anfwer better, is, yify. That the mailer » after being well informed, and 
doe coofideration of the nature, quality, climate, advantages and difadvan. 
tagesofeach farm, fliould fet a fpecific rent on it, aa high as he thinks 
it can bear, and then oflfer it to the pofleflbr, and t^ none other, if he 
does noi rt\f£t it, paying due regard at the fame time to abilities, in- 
duftiy, chara^er and principle ; and if the pofleflbr declines it, then 
to give it to fome other proper perfon, who may think it worth that 
rent. 4thfyt That when a proprietor gets good tenants, he ought to give 
two or three nineteenS| with a certain rife of rent at certain periods. 
, This would make their minds eafy, and induce them to wGt with fpirit, 
becaufe of their having a pretty fiire proipedl that they or thein might 
reap the fruits of their induftry. Fifteen or 19 years leafes are very bad for 
people of circumflances and induftry ; becaufe when an induftrlous man upon 
a (hort leafe puts his farm in the beft order he can, he makes it the greater 
temptation for others t» o&amp;r for it and remove himielf. There is ano- 
ther thing which the tenants of the principal proprietor complain of_ 
much, and which they reckon a grievance, tho* it is only the confcquence 
of their agreement by their leafes, that is, the payiag for the building or 
reparation of church, manfe and fchool-houfe. This was no doubt in- 
troduced in time of wadfets or mortgages, of which there are none nov^' 
on the eftate.. Jt would be equally for the intereft of the heritor to take 
this all on hknfelf, as is generally done over all Scotland, and fubftitute 
an addition to the rent in place of it. This would likewifc be moft-plea- 
fant to any incumbent ; becaufe, when any thing is wanted in that way» 
the people murmur and complain* and look upon themfelves as diftrefied 
by the minifter. 

Cottager s.'^Thcit is a dafs of people much negle^ed, at leaii: very 
little attended to, not only here but in moft countries in the Highlands,. 
I. e, the cottagers. They not only ha^e their houfcs from fnbtenants, but 
fometimes from the fubtenants of fubtenants ; and few of them allowed 
to keep a milch cow or a hbrfe, even for paying for them. This, in a 
country where there is not conftant employment for fuch, by daily laboufy 
mull of courfe keep them mi&amp;nbly p^er, and force them often to beg

ftplain of lofles faflained by the failures of little dro- 
▼eis. It is thought bj fome, that this might be pre* 
vented from being fo frequent. The common method of 
bojing of cattle is, for anj one that attempts droving, to 
can a market for himfelf when he fees proper. The ne- 
ceffitj, ignorance, or greed of many, induce them often to 
venture their cattle, for a (hilling or two more a^head, with 
a man that would be ruined if he loft a crown a-piece by 
bis parcel at Falkirk. Sales are by thefe means often par* 
tial, and feldom general, — ^picking a few beafts here and 
there out of parcels. It is thought, a few public markets 
in centrical places, correfponding to the fairs in the fouth, 
would anfwer better ; that heritors ought to attend to this, 
and that they and their fafiors ihould get the bed informa- 
tion in their power of the prices of the times, and get men of 
charaAer and fubftance to come as buyers ; that the fafiors 
ihould attend them, and perfuade the tenants to fell in a 
reafimable moderate way, according to the times: This 
might make the lale more general, and often prevent much 
money from being loft to tenants, a^d^ of courfe, to heri- 
tors. For, furely, confidering what a fatiguing, hazardous 
bofinefs droving is, men that pay well ought to be mu6h

for diem in centrical places, near the principal firms, from whence labour 
might be czpc^ed moft, and let each of them have a houfe and garden, 
and aboat two acres of ground for corn and potatoes, this would maintain 
a cow, and perhaps a finall horie ; and they might join about ploughing 
their fpoCs. |Fo«r or fix would be enough together ; crowding a number of 
poor people together might defeat the defign. This might anfwer well

Prognfs 0/ Civilization. — ^It is worth obfeirving, what 
change there is in the modes of thinking of the people 
within tfaefe laft 45 years. Two events have contribotetly 
in a remarkable manner, to a better waj of thinking, and 
fiibmifBon to order and government. The rebellion of 
z 745-6 in its good effeds, and the fubfeqaent abolition of 
the jarifdi£tion-aA. Previous to that period, property iw^rs 
chiefly protefted by force, and the exifting laws known in 
theory, but little regarded in many parts of the High- 
lands. Thieving was a trade in many countries, and car- 
ried on on a large fcale, with much contrivance and faga- 
city, and countenanced fometimes in private by thofe who 
undertook, for a certain pay called black meal^ the protec* 
tion of neighbouring diArifts. Prefident Forbes of Cullo*

was thought then, that minifters were to live abftnufled from this earth aU 
together. There is fuch a difference between four acres in fome places or 
countries and othtrs, that there was no juftice in the general rule. What 
furpufe car many glebes of four acres of poor land in many parts of the 
Highlands anfwer ? Will fuch a glebe maintain cattle to plough itself, or 
two horfcs to lead the minifter*s peats ? Which way is his family to get 
fuel brought home, or meal, carried from the low country, at tlic dif- 
tance of 30 or 40 miles or more ? . Was it fufipofed, that minifteri would 
be able, at any rate when old, to go on foot through their large parifiies, 
from one preaching place to another, ^t many miles diftance, through froft 
and fnow ? Thcrerore without regard tp quantity, every glebe ought to 
maintain two cows, and two good horfes fpr ploughing, for the roiriiter*s 
riding, for leading his peats and niealtroraany diftance neceflVry. It is faid 
herrtors reckon it a great hardfliip that the Court of Seflionlhould decern for 
vidliial to niiniftcrs in pariflics which pay no vi5lual-rent, and perhaps 
when enough is not produced for the inhabitants. Some heritors grudge 
every thing that is given to their clergy, as if they had no right to any 
thing. But, befides that viclual is the only payment that keeps pace with 
the times, does it hot appear "a greater hardfhip, that a micKlcr fliould fend

* A few infiances will be enongh to mention, in cafe the reader fhould 
tuagine, tliat tfacic things were lately done in Tippoo Snhan*s domi- 
aiois. One of thcxn lived in this pariih» named Robert Grant, commonix 
olkd Bailie More. It b faid, he ufed to hang people for difobliging 
^am. He feldora called jnries : He hanged two brothers on a tree witfaui 
t tboo&amp;nd yards of this town, and buried both in one grave, on the road- 
tie. The gfmve and ftooes above it are ftiU vifible. Another, aimed 
Jmes Onnt, comtaionly called Bailie Roy, who lived long in this parilh* 
loosed a man of the name of Steoart, and after hanging him, fct a jury 
« Um, and found him guilty. The particulars are too long to be inferr- 
ed here. The Bailie had many reafons for being in fuch a hurry. The 
MO was* wdnckily for htm, wealthy, and abounded in cattle, horfes, 
ihccp tnd gaats^ all of which were ioftantly driven. to the Bailie's home; 
Stoart's children let abegging, and his wife became deranged in her mind, 
isd was afterward drowned in a river : It is not very long fince. This 
^me Bailie Roy, on another occafion, hanged two notorious thieves, par- 
boiled their heads, and let them up on fpikes afterward. At another 
time, he drowned two men in facks, at the bridge of Billimon, within 
1 few hundred yards of this maofe, and endeavoured to compel a man from 
Gkamore, in the barony of Kinchardine, to affifthim and the executioners 
^ bad with him in the bufinefs ; which the man refufiog to do, the Bailie 
&amp;id to him. If yon was within my regality, I would teach you better 
nnaoers than to difbbey my commands. This Bailie bought a good eftate. 
There wu another of them, called Bailie Bain, in this country ; who became 
fo odioas, that the country-people drowned him in Spey, near the church 
of tnteiallan, about 2 miles firom hence. They took off his boots and gloves, 
left then in the bank, and drove his horfe through a nigged place, full 
of large ftones. The tra£l in the fand, boots, &amp;c. difcovered what had 
become of him ; and when a fearch was made for him down the river, a 
Btto met the party near the church of Cromdale, who alked them, what

THE ancient name of this pariih was Betheln j ; the 
church and manfe being at that time fixated in a prart 
of the parilhy which retains that name, and where there isi 
ffill a chnrch^yard, and borial place for the family of Mek 
dram. The prefent church was biult near to the village 
of OU-Meldrum, with a view (it is laid) to ahnex the 
potilh of Bourtj to the parifli of Meldrum, for fo it has 
been called fince this church was built, about the year 1684 ; 
but this annexation did not take place. The figure of the 
parilh is irregular, meafuring about 5 Engltlh miles in 
length, from S. to N. along the poft-road from Aberdeen 
to Banfi^ which paffing through the town of Old Meldrum, 
divides the pariih into two, but not equal parts. The

Eng^ miles, and in othen onlj about 2. It contains 
nearlj 6000 Scotch acres. The air is healchj, and the foiT 
ID general good. The whole pari(h almoft (the mofles ex- 
cepted) might be brought into cultivation by the ploagh 
alone ; and accordingly, a good deal of barren ground has 
already been, and flill more is jufi now bringbg into tillage 
in thb way. In the fouth part of the pariOi, where the 
town of Old Meldrum b fituated, and a good way around 
itt the foil is a flrong rich loam above clay, which, wbea 
properly maniured, bears luxuriant crops. The north part of it 
lies higher, in a thinner (harper foil, does not require fo much 
manure, and yields not fo weighty crops. Inhere are feve- 
ral quarries of the granite to be fiound in the parifh, fome 
of them very eaiily wrought, and of fuch a quality, as that 
the ftones may be drefled almoft for any purpofe* There 
are no fmaU rivulets in this parifti, but fuch as take their 
rife in it ; and yet there are upon the confines of it, 3 meal- 
mills belonging to it, which are moftly driven by water 
rifing in it. 

ViOages.-^^li Meldrum was ereded by charter into a 
burgh of barony m the year 1673. The bailies, 2 in num- 
ber, are eleded by Mr Urqubart of Meldrum, fuperior of 
the burgh, and have the fame authority as the bailies of any 
other burgK of barony have, fince the abolition of jurifdic- 
tions in 1748. There is a very good weekly market in it, 
for all kind of provifions, the beft in the county north of 
Aberdeen. The inhabitants in number about 783, confift 
of merchants, tradefmen of all kinds, and day-labourers ; 
and from thejnhabitants, one may judge of the number of 
feus, aU the houfes in the town being built on feued ground.

Poptilation.^^A,ccoT6mg to Dr We fter*s report, the 
number of fouls then was 1603. In 1785, the inhabitants of 
the town were in number 775, and thofe of the cobntry part 
of the parilh 738, amounting in all to 1553. In 1791-39 the 
town contained 783, the country 707, in all 1490, of whom 
728 are males, 762 females. They are in general of the £• 
flablifhed religion, a few Seceders, Epifcopalians, and Qua* 
kers, excepted. The decreafe of inhabitants in the country 
part of the pariih is to be accounted for by the fize of the 
farms being of late increafed, one tenant juft now poflef- 
fing what was formerly occupied by 3 or 4 tenants ; and 
alfo by an improving tenant choofing rather to occupy the 
gronnd himfelf than to let it to fubtenants. The marriages 
are, upon an average of 10 years backward, 10, and the 
births 26. There is no regifter kept of burials.

of Meldrum is proprietor of the whole parilh, and patron. 
— ^The number of poor receiving alms is 30 -, the annual 
contribution for their relief amounts, at an average, to a- 
bout L. 33, los. which, with fome donations fent from 
time to time by natives of the place at a diftance, make 
the whole of the fund for their fupport. The greater part 
of the poor refide in the town, and the inhabitants in ge-

for the relief of the mod neceffitous *• — There is a very 
gopd ichool at prefent in the town, attended by 40 or 50 
fcholarsin fummery and 50 or 60 in winter. It woald cer- 
tainly be a very eligible place for boarders. The prefent 
Ichoolmafter has only had one or two as yet; but boys or girls, 
at an early period of life, may have a very good education 
in the place. The fixed £ilary is L. 10 ; but from emolu« 
ments of office, fcholars, &amp;c« ^the living may amonnt to 
L.30 or ^•4u altogether. There is alfo a Sunday's fchool 
well^endowed by a native of the place, which promifes to 
be of great fervice to the rifing generation. It has been 
attended by 60 or 70 childreu almoft every Sunday during 
laft winter feafon. 

Agricubun. — ^Agriculture is no doubt dill in its infao- 
py in this part of the country ; but the progrefs it has 
made in this parifh, within thefe laft ao years, is by no 
means inconfiderable. T^ben only the proprietor raifed tur- 
nip in the field, now there are fome &amp;rmers who will have 
from 8 to 10 acres of turnip yearly, and they obferve a 
pretty regular rotation of crops, and every tenant has fome 
part of his ground in green crops yearly. Of late years 
alfo, the quality and fize, both of black cattle and horfes, 
have been greatly improved, and their numbers increafed, 
owing to the improvements which has been made in huf- 
bandry. The plough now made ufe of by many is of the 
Englifh form, drawn by 4 horfes or oxen in autumn and 

winter.

produce of the parifli is oats, barley, peafe, poUtoes, tur-

Mifcellantous Obfirvations. -^It may be worth while to 
obferve, that at firft darting in the way of improvement, 
in this country in general, they had many dii&amp;culties to 
overcome. They be^m with giving fo little lime to their 
ground, that it had almoft no effeft. This, together with 
fon^e improper methods of laying the lime on their ground, 
retarded its progrcis much. After they learned to 
give the ground a greater quantity of lime, and it became 
grateful to them in proportion, they took 6 or 7 crops of 
oats fucceflively, and fo reduced their ground almoft to a 
caput moriuum* They alfo cropped too much after tur- 
nip. They now, from experience, know better things, 
and do not exhauft the ftrength of their ground in this 
manner, but fow it with grals-feed while in good heart. 
About 16 years ago, when the firft Englifh lime in (hells 
was brought to this pariih, they fpoke of it then as fuch an 
ezpenfive manure, as the ground could never repay, and 
confequently the farmer could by no means afford. But at 
this prefent time, the fmalleft crofter in the pariih finds his 
advantage in ufing the EngHih lime in (bells, and will go

the whole, bettered their condidon.

years, with encouragement for good houfes and fences, by 
the proprietors agreeing to pay for the fame at the end of 
die kafc, as they Ihall be then valued by two men mutu- 
afly chofen. All fervices formerly paid to the proprietor, 
arc mofUy converted ; the only fervitude or ufage they 
now complain of, cfpecially improving tenants, is the pay- 
ment of roill-multurcs. The inhabitants of Old Meldrum 
are weU fupplied with fine fpring water ; and the diftillery , 
and brewery have each of them the command of a fmall 
ftream of water. Owing, it is thought, to the quality of 
die water, the porter brewed here is in great repute. The

Proprietors, — I. The Honourable WiDiam Ramray- 
Maule of Panmure, heritor of Ballumbie -, where there are 
the remains of an old fortified cafile. Thb efiate was farmcF-

one Alexander of that family, the celebrated Catherine 
Douglas (wbofe arm was fraAured when attempting to ftop 
the aiTaffins who murdered James I. King of Scotland, in 
the town of Perth) was married, and lived in this caiUe. 
3. John Guthrie, Efq; of Guthrie, proprietor of Wefter 
and Eafter Gaigies, as alfo Muirhoufe. Wefter Gaigie has 
been long the property of that family, where fometimes a 
fon refided. Their principal feat is at Guthrie, where there 
is an old caftle, and tf collegiate church, endowed by Sir 
Alexander Guthrie ; he, or one of his fucceflors of that 
name, was killed with James IV, at the battle of Flowdcn, 
3. Colonel Alexander Fotheringham, Efq; proprietor of Wef- 
ter Powrie, Myretown, Wbitebo^fe, IMiddle Brighty, 9nd 
Mill of Brighty. Wefter Powrie had been a confiderable 
time the refidence of that ancient family. They live now 
at an elegant feat, named Fotheringham, in the parifli of 
Inverarity. 4. Alexander Wedderbum Efq; of Wed-

and more, than what it was 30 years ago. There being no 
towns or villages of any extent, maoufaftures do not exifl \ 
a few weavers here and there excepted. 

Population. — According to Dr Webfter's report, the num- 
ber of fouls then was 623. The number of inhabitants 
is greatly diminiihed, owing to the monopoly of farms, the 
mode of labourihg, and the farmers fome time ago dif- 
charging feVtfal of their fubtenants and cottagers. Ix^ for- 
mer times, they laboured the ground with ploughs, drawti 
by oxen, each of thefe ploughs required 2 fer vants ; where- 
as, they now ufe ploughs drawn by 2 horfes, and i, fervant. 
Upon I farm, it is known that the farmer who occupied it, 
at a former period, employed 13 men-fervants, whereas 
the prefent tenant employs no more than 5. Then 3 
ploughs drawn by oxen were ^employed, and 6 hoifes kept; 
now fix horfes perform the whole labour ; fo in proportion 
over all the parifh. And if the proprietors of Wefler anfl 
Eafter Gaigies, and Muirhoufe, had not let a great part of 
their lands in pendicles or fmall farms, our numbers would 
not have been worthy of mentioning. The depopulation of 
the pariih is afcertained, by comparing the prefent with 
former regifters of baptifms. In the years 17341 1735^ 
1736, 1737, and 1738, the average was 24.6 baptiXms 
yearly. In the years 1761, 1762, 1763, 1764, and X765, 
the average was ao.8. In the years 1787, 1788, 1789, 1796, 
1791, and 1792, the avera^eis 15.5. In that part of Eafier

.4grtculture. — ^Abottt 30 years ago, improvements be* 
gan to take place, and the mode of labouring underwent 
a great change ; then lime began to be uied as a manure, 
afid the land, when let out, was fown with grafs-feeds^ 
Formerly, after ley, two crops of oats ; then giving what 
dung they had, a crop of barley ; then oats, and let out a^ 
gain : Few peafe were ufed.. Since lime was introdu- 
ced, the mode of labouring b as follows : xft year, fallow ^ 
ad year, barley ; fometimes, but leldom, wheat; 3d year, 
oats s 4th, green crop ; 5th year, barley and grals-ieeds 
along with the barley, cut for hay one, fometimes 2 years ^ 
then paftured 2 or 3 years. The fisurmers, from experience, 
find it more profitable to take fewer crops, both of com 
and grals, viss. two years in grais, and 3 years in com. 
Before they began to improve, every farmer had a flock

the pariih there is neither brewer nor baker. Within 
tfaeie 30 years, their fitnation is greatly altered to the bet- 
ter, and I can, with fafety, fay, that more money has 
been acquired by farming in this pariih, and .the vicinity, 
thefe 30 years pad, than for 200 years before that period*, 
though, at the fame time, their mode of living is greatly 
improved, their houfes more comfortable,. and better fiuv 
nilhed ; they even ufe fome of the luxuries of life. I ffaall 
make one obfervation, (which is hardly worthy of notice) : 
When the prefent incumbent fettled here, which was in

Poor, — ^In thb parHht properly fpedung, there are no 
begging poor; they are fupported in their hoofes by the 
weekly colle6tions» the interefts of a fmall capital, and the 
rents of two galleries in the chnrch ; the heritors and their 
tenants being never aflefled for their maintenance. In the 
X782, when vidual was fcarce and high priced, and Go- 
vernment contributed for the relief of the poor in the 
north of Scotland, this parlih declined receiving any part 
of the contribution, judging that other pari(hes might (land

Crodaced in a cburduway* which was an event nnch deAred by the King, 
aod which he had almoft defpaired to obtain. It may be obferved, how-

things cooceming their life, converlation, office^ and benefice, fhoold be 
khjt€k to the cenfore of the General Aflembly. 

As this alteration was made in the government, fo a fimilar one took 
place in the difcipline of the Church. For, in the faoM yeari 1710, the 
King let up the High Commiffion Court, and committed the rod of dil^ 
dphoe to them. The members of tbis court were all the biilkps, all the 
commiflkries in Scotland, with many of the nobility and gentry, and feve- 
ral ainifters. They bad power to judge in all cauies that concerned re* 
li^o or a moral Ufcj either in clergy or laity. They had 00 law, how- 
ever, for their authority, but an adl of Privy Council. They had power 
to fafpeod, deprive, dcpoCr, imprifon, baoilh, fine, 6cc. It was a moft 
arbitrary ooart, and could ufe the perfons and properties of the fubjeA aa 
it pteaied, without form or procefs of law. Churchmen had the power 
of the civil, and laymen that of the fpiritual fword. As by this court, 
tike power of tlie bifliops, (b wai the King's fupremacy, cxaitod to a great 
height 

An alteration was alfo made in the worihip fome years aAer this. In the 
AAembly met at Perth in the yew 1681, the famous five articlo, called the 
Perth articles, were enjoined. Thefe were, privato communion to fick 
people, private baptifm, kneeling at the fKrament of the Supper, confir* 
matioii by the biihops, and keeping ibme holydays. Thefe articlca were 
ntified by ad of Parliament i6ax ; but met with greater oppo&amp;tion, both 
in the Parliament and Ailembly, than the eftabliflitoent of Epiicopacy. 
They were very diiagrecable to both laity and clergy, as appeaii from the 
rumbert who fnfiirred from the High Commiffion Court, during 10 yean, 
ht non-conformity to Epifcopacy and the Perth articles ; till at lail, 
gsiniag the nobiliqr to tbair party, Epifcepacy waa rooted out with all 
its dependencies in 2631. Prior to 1610, the ftaodard of worfhip waa the

Orayfrian Church by a great number of all ranks, cooTcned at Edinbui^h 
for that end. The bulk of the nation having acceded to ihe Covenant, 
they ob^ged the King to grant them a free General Aflembly and Par. 
Itameot. The General Aflembly met at GUrgow, November 21 . the fame 
year, lliey approved the National Covenant, and declared it to be the 
fame in fubftance with that figned by King James VI and his houleholdy 
WHO 1 581. In this Aflembly, all the General Aiftmblies after the year 
9605 were declared null, the High Commiffion Court, the Book of Ca. 
nous, their Liturgy, the five articles of Perth, were declared unlawful; 
the 14 bifliops were all either depofed or excommunicated, except three 
who accepted of fingle charges. They reftored the Prelbyterian govern^ 
ment and difcipline as at firil. 

Next year, the General Aflembly met at Edinburgh, Aug. ly. and with 
the confent of the King*sCommiffioner, condemned Epifcopacy as unlaw. 
foL They appointed the Covenant to be fabfcribed and fworn to by all bia 
Majefty*s fobje^s in this kingdom, of whatever rank and quality. All 
thefe a^ were ratified and confirmed by Parliament in the King's pre- 
fence, Miw 1641. 

Upon renewing the National Covenant, the civil war began betweea 
the King*s party and the covenanters. The firft blow was ftrack at the 
bridge of Dee, and a vi^ory gained by the £arl of Montrofe, at the head 
of the men of Angus and Mearns, for the covenanters.

In the Solemn I.eagae4the govcroment of the Ghurcbiif Scotland is fe- 
coicd, their loyalty to the King declared, but limited vnSk their religion 
and libertiei, and they are bound to extirpate Popery and Prelacy ta 
both kingdoms ; yet they are not bound ezprefily to introduce Prelbyte- 
rici into England. In this particular, the fedarians outvritted the Pref* 
byteriamt. For, though the Epifcopal government wat totally abolilhed 
in England, yet the Frelbyterian never wai thoroughly fettled in that 
kingdom. In a word, the defign of the Preibyterians in the Solemn 
Lca^oe was to introduce an uniformity between the two kingdoms in doc- 
trine, worfliip, and church-government, and they made coniiderable ad- 
vaacci in that work, but the Independents and Sedianani had no fuch 
defign.

The Weftminlter Afiembly agreed on a Coafeflion of Faith, in 1647, 
which was approved by our Aflembly met at Ediobuigh, Augoft 3. 
that year. They agreed aifo on the Larger and Shorter Catechifini» 
wkieh waa approved by our Aflembly in 1 748. Thus thefe two Ai^ 
iemblies carried on the work of Reformation and Uniformity, in fo fu as 
both churches agreed in their principles concerning do^rine, woilhip, 
end govemmenL But after tbe year 1648, no more progreis was made in 
thift intended nnifoiinity. Our diviiions in Scotland, and the prevailing 
power of the ie&amp;aries in Bngland, put a final ftop to ail theie defigos of 
aniibfnity and seformation in both kingdoms. 

King Charles I. being at this time priiboer in the Ifle of Wight, the 
Parliament of Scotland demanded, that the King ihould be liberated, and 
brought to London in lafety and honour, and that religion flumld be efta- 
bliihed in England according to their covenant and treaties, and for this end 
appointed an army to be raifed of 30,000 foot and 6000 horfie. The Gene* 
tal Aflembly infifted, that he (honld be obliged to fettle religion in his 
dominions according to the covenanu. Both parties were loyal, and for the 
King's liberation, but differed on the terms. The Aflembly made an aA,

ibrmerlj went bj the name of Invemochtie. It was fo 
called, from the kirk's being built near to the place where 
the finall river Nochtie falls into Don. Befidesthefe, there 
are 5 or (J lefler rivers or bums, which flow from the fur- 
rounding mountains, in different direftions, and fSUl into 
Don in its courfe through the parifli. Thefe are feparated 
from each other by confiderable hills ; moft of them run 
through deep hollows or glens. The ground on both fides 
of diefe rivulets, in general, as well as on each fide of 
Don, where there are alfo fome confiderable haughs, rifes 
gradually towards the hills -, and for fome difiance from 
their banks, a confiderable part of it is arable, about a 
miles up from the {likes where they refpeAively join with. 
Don. All thefe rivers and bums abound in excellent trout.

the lower end of the parifli. — The general appearance of 
the country is hilly. The hills are moftly covered with 
heath. Tliey afibrd very wholefome pailurefor flieep, and 
moft of them abound in game. The hills of Curgarff ia 
particular are famous for thb produftion \ and in die lea*

parts of the kingdom. The foil, as may be fuppofed, in 
Yo large a traft of country, is various. The greater part 
of it is light and fliarp^.and when properly managed, is 
'fertile enough. In the higheft parts of the parifli, itis fpun^

It of the difference both of foil and climate* Therein 

the groand is more chilled bj the longer continuance of 

Snow in the fprisg, and bj more frequent ihowers in fiia« 

After. The tenaats^ in thofe parts, however, endeavour ta 

obviate tbefe local difiidvantages, bj fowing their bear im-^ 

mediatelj after their oats, without any interval;, and bj 

ofing a fpecies of oats, called birle j* This grain, (which 

is alfo white), is dillinguifhed from the common white 

ootSy in its appearance, Aieflj bj its (hortnefs : It does 

ait produce quite fo good^neal, nor Co much fodder ; nei« 

tfier is it fo hardy in bearing ftrels of weather ; it has alia 

a greater tendency to impoveriih the ground ; but it is con« 

fidcraUy earlier, and ripens nearly as foon in«che higher 

yarta of the country, as the common white oa^ does far* 

tber down, where both the foil and climate w^more £ft^ 

ToarabJe. Befides the above crops of grain, a good many 

potatoes are railed. Turnips are generally fown by the 

proprietors, and anfwer well* T^y alfo lay out theic 

fields with artificial gra^Tes, from wnxcti excellent crops are 

produced, both for hay and pafture. The tenants are not 

iufimfible of the advantages of cleaning and meliorating 

their fields by green crops, but are prevented from trying 

it by tbeir inability to lay out the nepeflary expenfe, by 

the want of eaclofures,.and of longleafes. Another bar 

on improvements in fiurmingi is a number of fervices, 

which the tenants sve obliged to perform to the proprietors^ 

fiuh as cafling, winning, and leading their peats and tur&amp; 

infiumner; harrowing infeedtime} reaping in harvefl;^ 

long carriages from Aberdeen and other places. Some of

phces, efpecially in the upper, parts of the pariik, dang is 
laid on the furrow for bear, and harrowed b with Ae 
feed. In other partly it is laid on the white landt either in 
antumn, or early in the fpring, and covered with a breskk- 
furrow ; and after lying fome time in diis ftatCt is deaa 
ploughed for the feed : This is fMomtd by two fuodeedmg 
crops of oats ; after which, the ground is dvnged agais^ 
and the lame rotation of crops obfcrved as before^ and 
thus, the greateft part of the arable land here has beca

the harrow%i a dry fbafon. Very good crops, howev«r# 
both of bear and oats, are raifed in this way. 

Few of the eftates or farms here have been meaiiired, ex^ 
cepcing on fome of tjjtejargeft farms where there is oatieM 
ground. The tenants m general pay nearly at thCfrate of L. t 
Sterling for every boll's fowing of arable knd they pof« 
lefii ; and as the fdtl is generally thin, and not in great or« 
der, it is believed that a Scotch acre will require almoft a 
hM of oats for feed. Along with this, however, every 
tenant has fome meadow-ground for graft, and a right of 
pafturage in the adjacent hUb or glens. Tliottgh tho land 
in general is little improved, the. rents have been donbledy 
and in fome places tripled within thefe 40 years palK Hiia

part of the pariih, about 8 or 9 Englifli miles in length)^ 
^re rather in a more thriving condition, and pay their rents 
more pundaally tbftn the generality of thofe who live in 
ckie other parts of the pariih. Their pofleffions are as hi^- 
ly Irented in proportion to the arable land on them, but 
they have more extenfive paftorages. They dqiend wholly 
on catde for the payment ^ their rents, and for procming 
thofe neceflaries Which their &amp;rms do not produoei fo that 
they can the more eafily bear a bad cn^ ^now and theni 
and as cattle have fold high for fome years paft, tiiey have 
fuffered leis from the late unfavourable feafons, than the 
farmers in the lower parts of the country, who depend part« 
ly 00 cattle, and partly on vidual. Their poflelBons too are 
moftly finally and they require fewer fervants. The fiirma 
duroughouc the whole pariih in general are ^ot extenfive, 
renting for the moft part from L. 5 to L. ao Sterling. A 
few, however^ are rented higher ; two or three from L. 40

isfli produces more vidual than i^^^cient to fupply the 
inhabitants, and affords a conficllpole fnrplus of butterv 
cheefe, bllu:k cattk, and fheep. Hie butter -and chyfe 
are generally carried to market at Tarland, a village or a-

Po/idla/ioff.— According toDr WeUler's report, the nam* 
ber of fouls then was 1750. The population has decreafed 
more than 100 within thefe 10 or z 2 years paft, owing to 
decayed &amp;rmers and others having removed to manufadu- 
ring towns, and fervants going to the (buth country in queft 
of higher wages. By an accurate lift taken fince this year 
began, the number of parifliioners amounted to 15249 
males 736, females 788, under 8 years of age 306. There 
are a Epifcopalians, uHtods of xoo Roman Catholics, moft-

general throughout the parifli. In one ;omer, (on Kindy 
fide), it has at different times been pra&amp;ifed with great foe-

prietor. The parifhioners at large do toot feem to entertain 
any prejudice againft inoculation, if they could afford the

There are^no natural woods of eoniequence in the parifli, but 
leveral thriving plantations of fir. The late Mr Forbes of 
Ballabeg was the firft in this part of the country who be- 
gan to plant. His improvements^ confidering the fmall- 
aefe of his property, are worthy of notice. He poflefled only 
one bxm of L. loo Scots of yearly rent, and a milL He be- 
gan his plantations in 1745, which he afterward extended 
over opvrards of zoo acres. He built a commodious manfion- 
hoofe and offices ; he improved fome moor-ground, ftraight- 
ed bis fields, fowed them ont with artificial grafles, and en- 
doled a great part of them with ftone fences and belts of 
hard wood ; and fo much did he raife the value of his (mall 
eftate, that, befides a confiderable fum arifing annnaDy 
from the iale of wood, the farm is let for the enfuing year 
at L. 49, 15 s. Sterling. 

jhuifMttUtf lic^ — At a little difiance from the church, on 
|he oppofite (north) fide of the river Don, ftands the 
Doon of Inveniochtie,'a beaudful earthen mount, evident- 
ly artificial, an^ £ome time a place of confiderable ftrength. 
It has been defended on the top by a wall, which is now 
moftly fallen $ part of it, however, on each fide the gate» 
is ftiU to be feen. Its bafe is furrounded by a ditch, which 
has bete filled with water by a fmall ftream (Bardock) 
that comes from the adjacent hill. This (flream, entering 
the ditch at the north-weft quarter, divides in^o two parts \ 
and, purling along each fide of die Doun, joins at the eait- 
cmescremoty, and&amp;lls into Don fome yards below it. 
This mount is of an oval form ; its (iirface on the top mea- 
fures about half an acre -, at the bafe it as more eztenfive.

been built by Ibme of the £aiis of Marr for a hunting feat*

f. e. ** the promontorj of boars/' from muc^ fignifjing a 
fow or boar, and rofs^ a land, promontorj, or peninfula. 
Hence Kinrols, '* bead of the peninfula,*' and Culrois, 
back of the fame. But St Regnlns, (vulgo St Rule), a 
monk of Patr» in Achaia, (warned, as is l&amp;id by a. vifion 
to fail weftward, and) having landed in this neighbour* 
hood, with fome relics of the Apoftle Andrew, about ^he 
year 3 70 ; and having been fucceisful in converting the Pi£b, 
Hergttftus, the King^ changed the name of Mncrois into 
that.of KilrymoQt, n i. Cella regis in monte \ or Cella in 
monee regb \ becaufe the king had given to Regnhis and 
his companions a piece of high ground, adjoining to the har- 
bour, on which he alfo ereded a chapel andtower in honoor 
of the monk, and bearing his name. The walls of St Rule's 
chapel, and the fquare tower, flill remain. The tower is 
about 108 feet high, without any fpire; the outfide, from, 
top to bottom, is of thin afbler work, the arches of the doors 
and windows, femtcircular. The tower has been, at the 
expenfe of the Exchequer, within tbefe few years repaired, 
that is, fuch of the afhler flones as had fallea down, have 
been replaced,. and all tbe joints filled up with cement; and 
a turnpike flair reared within fide, from bottom to top, 
which is now covered with lead within a parapet of 4 
feet. The exemplary virtue of Regulus and his company 
caufed a great refort of people to his chapel ^ and the name 
of the city was foon changed from Kilrymont to Kilrule, 
(Fanum vel Cella Reguli,) which name is ftill retained 
among the Scotch Highlanders* The name, Kilrule, con-

who'chflfiged the name into St Andrew's. At this time 
the Metropolitan church *, which under the Pids had been 
at Abemethjy was tranflated to St Andrew's % and the town 
was new peopled by a colony of Scots, particuhrly by 
tiiofe imder the' command of Fiffos Dufius, whofe great 
fervices to King Kennet were rewarded with ail the lands ly- 
ing in that ihire, formerly called Pichtlandia, and which 
diat captain* from his own name, caUed Fifland. The 
wall funrounding the priory is pretty entire ; it is filled 
with baftions, feme round, and fome Iquare. Part of the 
priors and fnbpriors houfes yet remain. Adjoining to the 
priory, are the ruins of the cathedral, which was 4cmoli(h- 
ed by ft mob, inflamed by a iermon of John Knox's. Both 
toiweiB at the eaft end are fiill Handing, having latf^ly got 
a finaU repair. One only of the weftem towers now re- 
mains, and a part of the weft end of the outermoft fouth wall. 
All the arches in the eaflern towers are femicircular ; thofe 
in the weflem tower, and in that part of the fouth wail ad- 
joining to it, are pointed. The pits are very vifible, out 
of which have been dug the foundations of the 4 great pil- 
lars that fupported the cupola, and the foundations of the 
crols ailes can be traced. The length of the cathedral 
from E. to W. as marked by the towers, as nearly as can 
be meafured, on very rough and unequal ground, is 350 
feet ; and the breadth of the crois ailes from N. to S. 160 

feet.

this port, chiefly is the eaflein part of Fife, for 9 or lo

tons, have within thefe 2 years bem built at this port, 
which are employed by the inhabitants in the wood and 
coafiing trades. In the fpring of 1792, Meflrs Robertfons

augmentations of ftipend, granted by the Commiffioners of 
Teihds, to the parochial miniders. In each college, there 
are apartments for lodging the (ludents, rent free ; there

thefe records at diflSerent periods, where any competent 
number of years conld be traced in fnoceffion. The mar^ 
riages are recorded only when the bride was refiding in the 
pariih, and no regifier of the dead was kept in this parifli, 
in the beginning of thb century.

As 



of Si Afidrevo's. aoy 

As the aven^ of births in ihefe two periods is fo eipnlt 
6e average of marriages fo nearly the fame, and the ave* 
age of deaths in the latter period is fo much below that of 
tbe former, the piefiimption iS| that the number of inha- 
biduBts is increafing. And the reafon why the average of 
deaths has of late years decieafed, may be, that the com- 
aoa peopk now nfe more generous food, are better dothed^ 
ffid more s^ttentive to deanlioeft in their perfons, their 
nanners, and their dwellings. By the foregoing uble ic 
appears, that the modem average of births in this parijh is 
to the real number of inhabitants as x to 37 very nearly \ 
iverage of marriages as 1 to 160 nearly ; average of deaths, 
as 1 to 49t nearly.— The number of ; artificers in the pa* 
lifli, mailers and freemen, is nearly as follows : Smiths, in- 
dnding x watchmaker, a tinmen, a workers in brais, and 
3 glovers, incorporated with the fiouths, ax \ wrigfats, car- 
penters, and mafoos, 50 \ bakers, 19 ; fleihets, 19 ; tailors, 
33 ; iboemakers, 34 ; weavers, 5a ; iaddler, i«— Befides 
the profeffor of medicine in the univerfity, there are in St 
Andrew's other a regular phyficians ; all the three praAife 
in midwifery and forgery, as occafion offers ; one apotheca- 
ry, who is alio a pra£titioner in pbyfic. Several (hopkeep- 
ers vend a few of the more common medicines, fiich as eve- 
ry neighbour prefcribes to another ; 5 writers or attomies \ 
2 meffengers at arms. The courts of law here are the Bailie 
court, the Desn of Guild court, Juftice of Peace court, and 
the Gommifiary court for the diocefe of St Andrew'Si whole 
regular place of meeting is the church of St Salvaus's Col* 
kgc.— There are no known inflances of people dying here 
fiv want, nor of murder, nor of fuicide, excepting the cafe 
of one man who hanged himfelf about foorfeore years ago ; 
Us body was differed, and his Ikeleton remains in the nni- 
yeifity library. No emigrations freia this paxiih; and

thoogh, as in every other towiii a few honfes tizj be occa- 
lioDally unoccupied, yet in general there is a demand, and 
the building of new houfes b found a profitable application 
of monej.— The modem average of ftodcnts at the philo- 
fopby college is loo ; of ditto at the divioitj college is 48. 
No regular authentic lift of ftudents at the phtbliDphj col- 
lege has been kept till of late years ; but by examining the 
matriculation book» and allowing that the number of new 
ftudenta formerly bore the fame proportion to the total that 
it now does^ it fhould feem that the average of fludents at 
the philofophy coUege was, from 173S to 1747* 56 ; from 
1757 to 1766, 79 ; and from 1773 ^^ *78»» 88 : Hence it 
af^ears, that the refort of ftudents to St Andrew's contt^ 
nties to be on the increafe. The greateft ntunber in any 
one year, in recent times, is 137. The number of ftudents 
in divinity alfo increales, as the average from 1773 ^^ 
1782, is only 30. The greateft number in any one year du* 
ruigthat period is 35. Greateft number fince that time, 54. 
The greateft number of ftudents at the uni verfity in any one 
year, i79.**Befides the parochial Eflabltftied minifters, 
there is in St Andrew's an Epifcopal clergyman, who has 
an annual penfion from Queen Anne's bounty, and a mi« 
nifter of the Burgher Seceders} there is but one family o£ 
Aatiborgher Seceders.

Hunips, potatoes^ clover* The quantity of land fown with 
wheat increafes every year. Barley is now more cultivated

died in 1444)* vho eftabliflied a family of the name of 
Wan as herediury keepers of the bridge, for which diey

obliged to wait the reflux of the tide, which canfedfo great

THE parifii of St Leonard's confifts of a few diftri£b in 
dilerent quarters of the town and fuburbs of St Andrew's, 
together with a farms in the country, abotit 3 miles diftaot 
£rom the town, all originally belonging to the Priory, af- 
terward to the College of St Leonard's, and now to the 
United College of St Salvator and St Leonard's. It is pro- 
bable that the eredion of the pariih is of the fame date 
with the foundation of the College whofe name it bears. 
Although the principal of St Leonard's did not always of- 
ficiate as minifter of tfie parifli, and in the inftance of Mr 
George Buchanan, was not even a clergyman, it is certain, 
that for fome time before the Revolution, the two offices 
were held by the fame perfon -, and ever fince that period 
the principal of the College ha^ been a clergyman and mi-

<p>THIS paiifli» formerly called Colbrandfpatb^ is fituated 
upon the fea-coaS^ in the ibire of Berwick, and coa« 
tifuoos to Eaft Lothian. It wa* hnt a iinall pariih till the 
9Qnezatioa of Auldcambus \ bnt at what time this happened 
IS uncertain. The pariih confifis of two parts ; one high 
and meantainous, the other comparatively low and even. 
The upper divifion nukes part of the gteat ridge of Lam* 
mermuir, which, at the weftem extremity of the pariih, 
approaches to within about three miles of the ihore, and 
which runs into the fea in the rocky promontory of Faft- 
caftle, a little beyond its eailern limit. The iame diviiioi^ 
is nearly followed by the minerals* the upper part coniiil* 
ing of fehiiltts rock, the lower, of ilrata of fandftone, coal, 
&amp;c.-,, their line of jonftion paflies through the middle of 

the 



222 Statyiical Acamni 

the parifli, nearly in a diredion from N. £• to S. W. Their 
afiual meeting may be feen at the bottom of feme of the 
glens, but ftiU better in a rock waflied by the fea at a place 
called Sickar Pointy where the ftrata of (andftone lie hori- 
zontally on the broken edges of the fchiftos, whofe beds 
are at that particular fpot nearly in a vertical pofitiMi % a 
fcene highly interefting to thofe who attend to the minera- 
logical hiftory of the globe. Several thick beds of gravel 
lie upon the fandftone of the lower divifion, eompofed of 
rounded pieces of fchiAus* whinfione, porphyry, granite, and 
fometimes limeftone ; all of which it is probable have been 
carried into their prefent pofition by fome great revolntion 
of the globe, fince none of them, except the fchiftus, occur 
in this parifli, in their native place. On the upper fide, 
towards the hills, thefe beds confift of fmall ftones inter- 
mixed with {and, and are loofe and detached ; upon the fhore 
the ftones are large, and bedded in clay. It is probaUjr 
owing to this circuroftance that the foil near the fea is a 
firong clay, and that farther up is light, and fometimes 
gravelly .-*The (here is high, confifting of a fet of clifl&amp; 
about 100 feet above the level of the fea ; they are formed 
either of fandftone, or of the beds of clay, mixed with large 
ftones mentioned above \ they are in fome places rocky 
and perpendicular, in others floping rapidly, but covered 
with grals, affording fweet pafture for flieep. Behind the 
cliSs the country rifes gently cowards the hills in a waving 
iform, and is interfefled by many deep ravines, whofe fides 
are fometimes flbping and covered with grafs, but are in 
general rocky, and finely wooded ; in each a little brook 
flows. This mixture of rocks, woods, pafture, and cultiva- 
tion, produces much piSurefque fcenery, both lively and 
romantic. Owing, however, to the want of hedge-rows, or' 
old enclofures, and to the low fituation of the woods, the 

country,

cnmtrT', as feen by a traveller merely pafling along the 
great poftFToady has fomewhat of a bare appearance. 

^gricubmre.^^ln this pariih we meet with every variety 
both of fcul and of climate, and a general fpirit of indoftry 
and ennilation prevaik among the tenants, which leads 
them to make the mdBt of every fituation. The foil of the 
knrer divifion is partly ftrong and partly light, each good 
of its kind ; bat they aafwer heft when combined together 
in one fiirm, as by this means a farmer can employ his 
ftrength at all feafons, and in all weathers. The rotation 
for the ftrong land, which lies chiefly along the fhore, is 
fidlow , \dieat or barley, with broad clover and rje grafs ; 
after the clover, oats ; then peafe or beans ; and again bar- 
ky or wheat. The heft fiirmers frequently fow barley 
a&amp;er fallow, inftead of wheat ; for it is difBcok upon ftrong 
fand, except after fidlow, to hit the proper feafon for bar- 
ley, and then the ground is in fine preparation for grafs- 
feeds ; whereas wheat upon fallow is often too flrong, and 
confequently falfe, and the grais-feeds fown with it fre- 
quently fiul ; on the other hand, wheat after beans or peafe, 
if the ground is clean, feldom fails to yield a good increafe. 
The rotation upon the light land of the lower divifion of 
the parifli, which lies principally upon its upper fide, is 
turnip, barley, clover, oats. The upper divifion of the pa- 
rifh, making part of Lammermuir, partakes fomewhat of 
its foil and climate ; but by the induftry of the farmers 
and proprietors, in the cultivation of turnip and grafs, and 
the proper uie of lime, the face of the country has been 
greatly changed for the better. 

Great traAs of land, which formerly were covered with 
heath, or over-run with furze, being brought to a fet 
of excellent breeding farms, great part of which is kept in 
pafiure* In thefe farms the iheep have been much im-

rather to fidl ihort of the land upon which the tnrai^ bw*

kept in fach heart, that an excellent crop of tnmips is foin«^ 
times raided after the oats, without dang being laid opoft 
that crop. The upland farmers feldom feed for the biitcher. 
Wit give 9X1 their turnips to the keeping fbck ; they like. 
wife frequently buy turnips from the lower farmers, and 
bring down their ftock to cat them. In the lower divifioti 
of this pariih the harveft is in general very favooraUe, 
and the farmers Ihow great aAiTity on that oocafion ; fo 
that when a bad feafon does occur, they fufier left than in 
many other plaees ; they employ great nnmbers of High« 
landers at that time, who come into the country for the 
purpofe, and no wages are fpared when thi^ feafon requires 
a ftre&amp; of hands. In the upper diviiion the harveft is often 
late, and of courfe fubjeded to more feverc weather.— No 
limeftone has been found in this parifli \ but Ume is got 
from the ktlb at Thomton-loch, at the diftance of three or 
four miles along the great poft-road. ^Ilie lands of the

<p>Sitoatidn, Name^ (/r. 

TH £ pariQi of Clofebiim Is diflant from the town of 
Dumfries I2 miles. The original name of the pa- 
riih was Kiloflsurn, or, as it is fpelled iii a ver^ old deed, 
Kelolbern, from Cella OJburm. It was at firfi but of finall 
extent, and the church feems to have been intended chiefly 
for the accommodation of the family of Clofebum, and its 
dependents. To that very ancient and refpeftable £unily 
the whole parifh belonged, and in their poireffion it re* 
mained for feveral centuries. The prefent repf efentative^ 
of the family has a charter of confirmation, which wtfs 
granted to one of his predeoeflbrs in the beginning of the 
X3th century. To fatisfy the demands of importunate ere* 
ditors, the eftate of Clofebum was expofed to fale in the 
yeair X783» a&amp;d was bought by the Reverend James Stuart 

Montcfttb^

MoDteatb, R«Qor of Banrowby in lincobflure. Clofe* 
burn is quite furroimded by the parifli of Dalgarno, which 
was annexed to it in the year 1697 ; and the extent of the 
two united, is about 9 or 10 miles in kngth, and as much 
in breadthy meafuring from the extremities. Near where 
die church of Dalgarno fiood, there was a Tillage, which, 
though there are now no remains of it, was in former 
times a place of confiderable note, being a burgh of rega« 
Etj, to whofe jurifdidion a very confiderable extent of 
country was fubjed. 

Stipend^ Hc-^Thz patronage of the united pariihes ha« 
Ting been fold along with the efiate of Clofebum, now be- 
longs to Mr Stewart Monteath. The ftipend was aug- 
mented in the year 1786, and is now L. 70 in money, 
2 chalders of meal, and i of bear, with L. 5 for commu- 
nion-elements. The f^hc is very finally, no ground ha-' 
ving ever yet been £et off for pafiurage, either in Clbfe« 
bum or Dalgarno. The glebe of Dalgarno, confiding of 
4 acres and nearly one half, was exchanged in the year 
1731 for 3 acres and one rood, lying contiguous to the 
glebe of Clofebum, which, in confequence of this addition, 
meafiires about 6 acres. The church was built about 50,- 
and the manfe about 30 years ago; confiderable repara- 
tions were made upon both about 15 years ago \ and they 
are now much better than, is common in country pariihes. 

Pofuhtton^ W^.— Accofdbg to Dr Webfter's report, the 
population in 1755, was 999. The number of inhabitants 
in the year 1778, was between 1000 and iioo. Lafi year, 
(1791), they amounted to 1490. This great increafe has 
been occafioned by extenfive lime- works in the pariih, the 
divifion of farms, making of roads, and other improve-

From the increafe of population, it mmj be fuppofed 
dun there is a great number of hottfea lately built in the 
parifli. Some of thefe indeed, being built hy fubMnnta at 
their own topefife, are but indiflferent ; and it is a little 
unfortunate, that thefe poorefl hou&amp;s are built along the 
great road which pafles through the parifli. Travellers, 
from the mean appearance of thefe houfes, are apt to^ form 
an un&amp;vourable opinion of the country. But the princi- 
pal farmers are generally lodged pretty comfortably. The 
new proprietor of Clofeborn has built a very excellent 
hoofe for faimfiilf, large, fubAantial, and commodious *•

inu ^ i flc d for a fchoolmafler. In room of a le^ Ulwrjr 
the proprietor oF Clofeburn has, for t, great many years; 
been in nfe to give a fmall fom of monejr yearly^ to a perv 
ton named by himfelf to teach Englifli, writing and arith*^ 
tnetiCy in any part of the parilh he himfelf thought proper. 
Bot the principal fchool of the parilh is that which, in ho-» 
noorof its founder, is called the (choolof Wallacehall: 
John Wallace, merchant in Glafgow, a native of Glofe* 
bum, in the year 1723, mortified L. 1600, for the purpdfti 
of erefting this fchool *. Tlie reputation of the fchool of 
WallacehaU was raifed very high by thie late reddr Mr 
Alexander Mundell^ and there is every reafon to exped^ 
that Under hi^ (on and fucceflbr, it will preferve that repu« 
ration it has very jufUy acquired. The fituation of thi^ 

fchool 

whofe age, from his own iccdnnt, is 89. He was long gardener to tbe 
baaaXj of Clofeburn ; but for fomc years his onlj employment has beea 
going errands. He is yet a healthy and vigorous man, and walks fome- 
tioes 7 or S miles in a forenoon, without being fatigued. In the church-' 
3rari dfDalgamo there is a tombftone, under which are buried a lather 
and mother, with their ion and his wife» whofe ages, all added together^ 
araotant to 550 years. 

* The preibytery of Penpont were appointed truilees for the manage- 
ment of the fund, judging of the qualifications of the teachers, and 
watching orcr the intereds of the fchool. In the management of the 
fund, the Laird of Clofeburn was to be confulted. Five patrons were 
appointed to nominate the re^or of the fchool, viz. John Wallace of 
Elderilie, Thomas Wallace of Caimhill. and Michael Wallace, merchant 
in Glafgow, three brothers, the miniitcr of Clofeburn, and town-clerk 
%ti Glafgoiv', for the time being. In the ele^ion of a re^or, it is re- 
commended to tlie patrons to give a preference to one of the name of 
Wallace, if equally qualified. Of the money mortified by Mr Wallace, 
U ICO was laid out in building a fcbooUhoufe and dwelUng-houfe for 
the refior, and in pnrchafing 5 acres of ground contiguous to the fchool, 
for the re^or's oi'e ; L. 1145 was laid out in purchafing lands at fome 
diflance ; and the remainder was at firft put out to intcrcll, but has fince 
been applied, towards encloiing the land, and enlarging the reAor*f 

hottle.

redor being aboot to build a large and commodioos new 

houfe i and every attenticm is paid both to the morals aa4 

education of thole under his care. This fchool is indeed 

not only blefling to the parilh, but a public gpod to the 

country.-— The only prqviiion for the poor of the parifli 

is a fund of h* 100, lent to a Banking Conipany at 4 per 

cent, the weekly colleftions amounting to about L. 3 a or 

L. 33 a-year, and fome fmall fines, together with money 

received for the ufe of a mort*cloth, amounting to L. 2 or 

£4. 3 a-year. The number of poor is from ao to 25. Of 

thefe, a few depend wholly upon what they receive out of 

the pariih ; and others are capable of doing a little work, 

7hich, with a fmall aid from the weekly coUeftions, ferves 

for their fupport*

mortification requires to b^ taught at tHis fchool, are, reading Engliih, 
writing, ari(hnietic, book-keeping^ Latin and Greek. But befides^eie, 
French, geography, and fometimes mathematics, tr^ aUb taught. The 
£ngli(h, writing, arithmetic, and book-keeping daflesr are taught by an 
u(hcr, named by the re^lor, and approved of ^y the prefbytery. His &amp;- 
lary is paid by the redlor, and is by the deed of mortification appointed 
to be L. 10 a-year and his board, or L. 18 without his board. The 
redlor is Ukewife obliged to pay L. 5 a-year to a perfon named by the 
minifter, to teach Englifh in a remote part of the pari(h, which, on aq- 
count of the dilbmce, cannot reap any benefit from the other fchools. 
All thefe fchools are fiee to the chilfren of the paiiih. 



ITidi, which forms the weftem baandarj of the pariih, is 
to be £biii|d a fine rich, loamy foil. To the eaftward, the. 
gnmnd rifies a little, and the foil becomes light; drj, and 
limdy. Farther on, in the fame diredion, the ground rifes 
M more, and there the foil is ftrong and deep, with a mix-, 
toie of day ; to the eafiward of this again are extenfive 
moors, unfit for tillage^ bnt affording very good pallure for 
ibeep. The rental of the parifh is about L. 3500. The 
&amp;nnex3 are rather unwilling to publiih the ftock and crop 
opcm their farms ; but according to the neareft calculation, 
the amount of the whole may be about 11,000 iheep, 120Q 
black cattle, and 250 hories, all ages included. 

^liep^'^Thz (beep generally kept are the Ihort black* 
fitted kind, and the farmers ieem to have no inclioatibn to 
change the breed, but are at pains to improve it. It is 
coiBpated that every fcore of fuch Iheep will yield ful- 
ly 3 ftones of wool ; of courfe, there ought to be 1650 
ftooes produced in the parifli annually \ but, owing to a num- 
ber of flieep 3i one and two years old being fold off before 
the time of iheep-fliearing, the quantity a£hially produced 
does not much exceed 1400 ftones. The wool is generally 
(old at 6s. or 7 s. the ftone ; but it has lately become a prac- 
tice with fevcral of t)»e fiarmers in this and the neighbour- . 
ing pariflies to wafh their (heep before they are clipped. 
This no doubt leffens the weight of their wool, but it brings 
them a price for it fo much higher, as more than to com- 
peoiate for the lofs of weight, and for the trouble of waibt 
ing ; wool, which otherwife would not have brought more

IhiJhamiryn'^Thft mode of hnlbandrj is not tmiform 
throughoat the parifli ; bpt that which prevails moft is, 
after liming the ground to take a, fometimes 3 crops of 
oats, after theft a green crop of potatoes, tamips, and 
p^re, and then to laj it oat with barley, or bear and grafs. 
The quantity of ground occupied by each of thefe kinds of 
crop is not ezadly afcertained, but is conjednred to be 
about 1500 acres in oats; from 20 to 30 in wheat; 230 
in barley; 70 in bear; 120 in potatoes ; 30 or 40 in tur* 
nips; 40 or 50 in peafe; and about lee in clover and rye- 
gra(s. The potatoes and turnips are all horfe-hoed, and 
in no country are better crops of thefe nufed than in this. 
Potatoes are fuppofed to be half the food of the labouring 
people through all this country ; and when there are more 
than can be ufed by the people, they are found to be of 
great advantage in feeding horfes, cows, and fwine ; hence 
the raifing good potatoe crops is an obje&amp; of importance, 
and if the farmers of this country have approached perfec* 
tion in any thing, it is in this branch of hufbandry. The 
nature of the foil is well adapted to this l^ind of crop, and 

tlie 

proprietor*! own hand ; from which it ippean, that there were then upon 
that barony ^740 fheep, yieldiBjt 537 ftones of wool. The nuaiber kept 
•t prefeot upon the ftme Iwdt is oAly Jp^o* which« allowing 3 ftoaet of 
wool to the fcort of flieep, will yield 594 ftones ; fo that though the 
number of flieep be left by almoit two-fifths, yet the quantity of wool if 
greater. The reafon of this remarkable difference in the nuinber of (heep 
is, thit at the beginning of this century the flieep were much final ler, con- 
feqnently the landi could keep more of then ; befidesi the farmeia then 
overftocked their (arms; and a third reafon is, that a great deal of land, 
which was then fit only for common (heep-pafture, has finer been im- 
proved, and tt now good corn-land. Farms, upon which at that time ' 
confiderable 'flocks wcrx kept, have not now a fingle flieep upon them. 
The dit proportion with refped to the quantity of wool maybe accounted 
for from the larger fiir of ths flitep» from their being in better condi- 
tion, and from their- being hnatkr fintnred tium they formedy were« * •'

XiVar*worii.*— The lime-works of Qlolebum deferve par- 
ticular notice* By improving the land, and exciting a 
%Mrit of induftry in the people, they have proved a public 
blefling to the country, as well as a fource of weakh to the 
prc^rietor* The lime-rock was difcoveied many years 
ago, but was in a great meafure neglefted till Sir James 
Earkpatrick, the late proprietor of Clofebum, took ic into 
his own management. Ic is juft about ao years fince he 
began to carry on that work, and from that period the 
country has been improving with afioniihing rapidity. It 
has been obferved, that the foil of Clofebum is various; but 
that which prevsdls moft in the arable part, is the light, 
dry, iandy foil ; and the people imagined that in place of 
being improved, it would be quite burnt up, and rendered 
ufelels by lime. To conquer vulgar prejudices 1% always a

mod fometimes be bribed to purfue their own interefi. 
Thej cannot, without fome powerful inducements, be pre- 
vailed upon to give up their old cuiloms, and to adopt 
thofe improvements which, after a fair trial, fufficiently re* 
commend themfelves. In the prefent cafe, the proprietor 
of Clofebum found it neceflary to oblige his tenants in their 
leafes to lime a certain quantity of their land yearlj, he 
fiimiihing the lime, and even paying for the carriage of it; 
and they, on their parts, being bound to pay 5 s. additional 
rent for every 80 meafures, which were confidered as fuffi* 
cient for an acre« To men of a fmall capital, who could 
not aSbrd to be at the expenfe of liming their ground 
themfelves, this fcheme was evidently beneficiaL In place 
of advancing the money out of their own pockets, they had 
to pay little more than the interefl of it -, at the iame time, 
the prpprietor improving his eftate, and receiving good in* 
tereft for his money, was, upon the whole, no lofer, though 
greatly in advance* But even in this way, fo favourable 
to the tenant, the greatefi quantity any of them would 
agree to lime was two acres in the yeaur -, fome of them 
would lime no more than half an acre; and others could 
hardly be prevailed upon at all to make the experiment* 
Such was the averfion of the people in thb country to the 
life of lime as a manure for land, when the lime-works of 
Clofebum were firft begun in the years 1772, 1773, and 
1774 ; but experience has conquered their prejudices, and 
neither compulfion nor arguments are any longer necefltry. 
The lime cofts 9 d. the meafure at the lime- works, each 
meafnre containing two Dumfries pecks heaped, or about 
3| Winchefter buihels. The reafon of this high price ia, 
the deep cover, and the diftance from coal. The coal is all 
brought from Sanquhar, which is 14 miles from Clofebum. 
It is fold at 7 d. the o^eafurc when laid down at the lime-

yrorlu. The meafare is the fame with that by which tfap 
lime is fold ; and one meafure of coals is hardly fufficient 
to burn three of lime. The quantity of lime commonly 
laid upon an acre is from 60 to 80 meafures, and there are 
from 60,000 to 70,000 meafures fold annually at the lime- 
works. There is another lime- work in the neighbourhood, 
which was begun about feven years ago by Sir James 
Kirkpatrick, and at which a very confiderable quantity of 
lime is fold \ but, notwithilanding this, the demand at 
Clofeburn has not in the leaft decreafed ; a ftrong proof of 
the progreffive improvement of the country. Indeed, 
within the fpace of 20 years, the country has been made to 
put on quite a new face ; for dirty croft, and poor outfield 
crops of gray oats, and fmall bear, or big, rich crops of ex* 
cellent oats, barley, wheat and peafe, potatoes, turnips, 
and fown grafTes, are almoft every where to be feen. 
Ground, which formerly paid not more than a s. or a s. 
6 d. the acre, now pays 15 s. and fome of it is even fubfet 
at a guinea. The rents of the farms in general are more ' 
than doubled, yet the tenants live incomparably better than 
when they paid not thehalf of the prefent rents. Clofeburn, 
fron^ being in a great meafur^ a bleak' and barren, has be*, 
come a pleafant and fertile fpot in itfelf, and affords ample 
means of improvement to all the neighbouring country. 
All this has been brought about by the enterprifing fpirit 
of one man, whofe name will long be revered in this 
country *.

HilU and Game. — ^The principal hills are Queenfterry, 

Garrick Heights, and Auchinleck. From the firft of thefe, 

the Doke of Queenfberry takes his title, though only one 

half of it is his property. Upon the top of this hill, grows 

a linall berry, commonly called the Nub Berry. It bears 

fome refemblance to the bramble berry, and is pleafant e- 

nough to the tafte. It is not improbable, that the hill 

might derive its name from this berry, which perhaps 

might be called the Queen of Berrys, or Queeniberry, as 

being thought the mod delicious of wild berries. This, 

however, is but mere conjefture. The hill of Queenf- 

^rry rifes about aooo feet above the level of the fea, 

£rom which it is diftant about ao miles. The moors in

boundary between the psurifhes of Clo&amp;bum and Keir, 
Clofebum Jying upon the eaft, and Keir upon the ^eft of 
that river. But probably, on account of the river's having 
changed its courfe, there are two pretty large farms be* 
lon^g to the parifh of Clofebum^ which now lie upon 
the weftem fide. This beautiful river having been already 
taken notice of, in the Statiflical Accounts of fome other 
pariflies, it is unneceflary to fay much about it here. It 
runs 5 or 6 miles along the weftem fide of this parilh, 
through eztenfive holms, now highly culcivated. Thefe 
holms, on each fide, terminate in floping banks, covered 
partly with natural wood, and partly with thriving planta'* 
tions. Several genteel houfes have lately been built at fmaH 
diftances, and within view of one another. The whole to- 
gether affords a profpefl as rich and beautiful as is to be feen 
almoft in any country. The fiOi in the river Nith are, (al* 
mon, gilfes, fea-trouts, hirlings, and bum-trouts. Befides 
the Nith, there are feveral fmaller waters or bums, as diey 
are called, in the pariih, in all of which there is a good 
deal of bum-trout. The only one of thefe, which deferves 
particular notice, is, that which is called Crichup, remark^

there was a cnrious cell or cave, called the Elf *s Kith, where, acccfrding 
to the foperftition of the times, the imaginary inhabitants of the linn 
were fappofed to hold their meetings. This cave proving a good free- 
ftone-quarry, has lately been dcmoliihed, for the purpofe of ballding

ing of thb caftle, together with an account of the ancient 
and prefent families pofleding it, may be feen in Mr Grofe*s 
Antiquities of Scotland. Upon the farm of Kirkpatriclc 
in this parifli, there are the remains of an old chapel and 
burying ground *, and upon the farm of Auchencaim^ 
there are the remains of an old vaulted building. But no 
traditionary account with refped to either of thefe, has 
been tranfmitted down to the prefent age. There are 
like wife, in different parts of the parifh,feveral large cairns 
of ftones heaped together. But neither is there any tradi- 
tion with refped to them. 

Locb and Mineral Wells. — ^The caflle of Clofebum was 
furrounded by a fofle, which was connefted with a loch of 
nearly a quarter of a mile in length. In this loch, there 
was a remarkable agitation in the year 1756, of which an 
atcount is given in the Philofophical Tranfadions of that 
year. At a fmall diftance from the caftle of Clofebura^ 
there is a mineral well, which was once of confiderable re- 
pute. Its water is fulphureous, and has often been of fet- 
vice in fcrofulous cafes. There is another of the fame 
kind in the Duke of Queenfberry's lands of Lockerben j 
and there is another mineral well -gf a different kind, 
known by the name of the Town Clcugh Well. It is 
pretty ftrongly impregnated with iron, and its name points 
out its fituation. The Cleugh, where it is, is called the 
Town Gleugh, from its vicinity to a fmall village called 
Clofeburn Town, of which the only remains now are a 
part of the Crois, which is not yet totally deftroyed.

Roads itftd Bridges. — Gonfiderable improvements have 
been made upon the roads in this pariih. The great turn- 
pike road in particular, from Dumfries, to Glafgow and 
AjT, which goes through this pariih, does much credit to 
the judgment of the gentlemen who marked out the direc- 
tion of it. Upon this road, there is a comfortable inn at 
Brownhill, in this pariih, which divides the waj pretty, 
equally between Dumfries and Sanquhar, and at which 
travelers maj expeA to be treated with every civility. 
The pariih is alfo well fupplied with bridges over every 
little brook \ where a bridge s at ^U needed, an arch is 
thrown, and the communication of one part of the pariih 
with another, by this means, rendered eafy at all times. 

Ciara£ier of the People. — ^In to populous a pariih, it is 
ifflpoffible but that there muil now and then be a few dif- 
orderly perfons. But it would be very unfair to judge of 
the general charader of the people from the conduA of « 
few individuals, or from a few irregularities committed in 
the intemperate ufe of whilky. Within the memory of 
man, no inhabitant of this pariih has ever been guilty of 
faicide \ none has ever fuSered death by the hand of the 
executioner ; none has ever been baniihed from his coun- 
try ; none has ever been fo much as tried for murder, 
theft, or any capital crime. They are upon the whole a 
quiet, fober, boneil*, and induilrious people. The farmers 
in particular are a very decent fet of men, attentive to 
their buiinefe, juil in their dealings, civil and obliging in 
their manners.

acres. Its form is nearlj an oblong fquare, bat very irre- 
gular, particularly towards the W. and S. comers, where 
it is bounded by Domock and Gretna. The origin of the 
name Kirkpatrick is obvious; being a ceU or church, 
dedicated to St Patrick, who, though a native of Scotland, 
became'the tutelary faint of Ireland, and whofe memory, 
the piety and reverence of his countrymen, feem to have 
honoured with the confecration of feveral churches *• 

The appearance of the country in this difirift, which 
gently rifes from die S. towards the N. by a gradual fuo* 
ceffion of waving fwells, prefents at the fame time no un« 
pleafing variety, and a moft ftriking contrail. In feveral

and iheltered with natural woods and plantations ; while 
here and there large trafis of uncultivated ground, ftill re-

SoiL — ^The foil varies exceedingly ; and foils which ap- 
pear in other refpeds much the fame, become more or le&amp; 
valuable from the bottoms upon which they lie. In many 
parts, it confifts of a ftrong red earth, with a large mixture 
of fand, to a confiderable depth ; which, when lying upon 
a gravelly bottom, as is generally the cafe along the fide 
of the river, is defer vedly efleemed land of the firft quali- 
ty *, and when under proper culture, and good management, 
produces the mod luxuriant crops of every kind. A foil 
nearly the fame, but more ihallow, is frequently tp be met 
with, upon a bottom inclining to clay and grairel, which, 
though land of an inferior quality, is perhaps to the far- 
rier equally valuable as the former ; though lefs capable 
of producing crops of wheat, it is eafier cultivated and 
managed, and generally yidds crops of every other kind, 
in equal abundance. The fame kind of earth, with a very 
|inall mixture of fand, frequently makes its appearance

and odief flimutating matinres, it generally prodnceis oats 
and gfa&amp; in abixndaiiee. Mod of the lands lately broken

.^^iVtf/rtrrr.— The wretched mode of cnkivatioii, which 
formerly prevailed all over this country, begins now gra- 
dmdly to £(appeat, and a more exteiifive and liberal fyftem 
of agncdtnre has been adopted. The intelligent farmer is 
nowfisUy convinced, that a well chofen rotation of crops, and 
reguht ceflation from tillage, by laying his fields out un- 
der grals, are of the utmoft importance in hulbandry. 
Witfr a view to render this more general, the chief he- 
ritors in this pariQi have prefcribed in leafe a particular 

mode 



152 Stati/iical Account 

mode of rotationi which certainly hath not been withoist 
eSsft* The following rotation of crops is moft geoeralljr 
purfued. The fumnver, previous to breaktng up the 
ground, or if convenient, an jear earlier, 15, or if die 
bottom is c6ld and clayej, 30 Gariifle bdbelsof (heU-ltme 
are laid upon each acre. After this preparation, the xft 
crop is oats, which never fail to be ekceedinglj lux- 
uriant ; and a 2d, equally ftrong, might be ezpefied ; bat, 
in this cafe, the ground would be much impoveriflied, and 
require its ftrength to be recruited for a barley crop in the' 
3d year, with a ftrong manure of dung, which every good 
farmer will ftudy to manage with the greateil cscooomy. 
After a flight preparation with a litde dung, barley is fown 
the ad year ; the following crop is oats ; and the 4th year 
it is in potatoes, turnips, and fallow. The 5th year is 
barley, with whidi it is fown down in grals-ieeds, A dif- 
ferent mode of rotation, fometimes is to defer linung until 
after a crops of oats. The 3d year it lies in &amp;Uoim^ or 
yields a potato crop, and receives the fame quantity of 
lime as before mentioned. The 4th crop is wheat, and 
the following barley, with which it is fown down with 
grais feeds. It lies in grals at leaft three years; and du- 
ring the a firft years, the ill crop each year is generally 
cut. To cut it a 3d year, or even twice in x year, is 
deemed extremely prejudicial to the land. By the latter, 
the farmer is certainly more reftri£ted, on account of his 
wheat crop, which requires the liming immediately to 
precede it. In this refpeft, the former has the advantagCp 
as he not only reaps the benefit of the lime during the whole 
time his land is in crop, but enjoys this fiirther advan- 
tage, that be can lime 2 or 3 years previous to the break- 
ing up of his ground, which greatly increa£es the quan- 
tity of grais produced, and is by experience found ta 
be in no degree detrimental to the following cropsi - 

There 



of Kirkpatrick-Flefming. 25 3 

There being no marl in this dKlrid, the manures chiefly 
mde ufe of for meliorating the foil, and raifing crops, are 
]i]iie» and the dung coUefted upon the different farms. Lit- 
tle attention has hitherto been paid to the melioration and 
improvement of pafiure-grounds by manures, and it is 
odIj till within thefe few years that any attempts to raife 
crops of ^grais this way have been made ; from the fuccefs 
with which thefe attempts have already been rewarded, it 
is to be hoped, that they will in future be frequently re« 
peated. The manures u&amp;d for this purpofe, are, aflies, 
fime, and a compofition of earth and lime \ which laft, 
when properly mixed and compounded, fornxs a very rich 
manure; and being fpread plentifully upon the furface, 
never Csdls to be followed fucceilively with a, and fome- 
times 3 very rich and luxuriant crops of grafs. 

The crops to which moft attention is paid in this pa 
lifli, and which indeed moft liberally reward ^ the toils of 
the hnibandman, are oats, barley, and fiotatoes. Of thefe, 
oats are the moft general, and perhaps, upon the whole, 
the moft valuable crop ; a very confiderable part of peo* 
pies food depending on this grain. Yet notwithftanding 
what is exhaufted this way, and in feeding horfes, a large 
quantity is annually fumiihed for the market. The great 
difference between the average produce, and that of the 
beft, is owing to the large quantity of land, not only 
coarfe, but in bad heart, which is annually fown with thb 
grain. Barley may be confidered, in a great meafure, an 
article for the market, though no inconiiderable quantity of 
it too, b fometimes manu£ai6hired into a flour, of which a 
bread is made abundantly pleafant, and efteemed exceed- 
ingly healthful. The potato crop, though in a lefs feu- 
fible manner, with equal certainty, repays the labours of 
the huibandman. As an article of food, potatoes are of 
infinite value in his family, and for feeding horfes and

256 Statijiical Account 

The above table, though containing a pretty accurate 
ftatement of the extent of the prefent cultivation and pro. 
duce of the parilh, muft by no means be regarded as a ftan« 
dard for future years, as annually large fields of land are 
taking in, and that which hath already been in tillage, is 
continually rifing into higher degrees of cultivation. 

Stock, — ^The number of ftock kept in this diftrift» is on- 
ly fmall in proportion to its extent, owing to the large 
quantity of mofs, and the little attention which hath hi- 
therto been paid to the improvement of paftnre-grounds. 
I There is reafon, hoi^ever, to hope, that more atten- 
tion will, in future,' be turned to this objeft, which 
doubtlefs would be an eflential benefit to the public, 
and could not fail liberally to repay both the proprietor 
end tenant. The black cattle, excepting the cows kept 
by one of the principal heritors, and a &amp;w others, are 
moftly of the Galloway breed. They are efteemed more 
hardy and firm, agree better with the pafhire, and in ge- 
neral find a more ready market. There is a confiderable 
number of work-horfes kept in this parilh, many of which 

are 

Note for Page 25;. 

* The only meafure now ufed in the pariih of Kirkpatrick-Fleming^, 
and over the greateft part of Annandale, is the Caflifle peck, 4 of which 
make a Carlifle bufliel. A quart, adjufted by the ftandard meafure. kept 
at Carlifle, being a cylinder of 36 inches diameter, and 6 inches deep, 
contains 64.151 cubie inches ; therefore the gallon contains 25^.608 ; 
and 6 of thefe gallons being the Caflitle peck, it contains 1539.648 inch- 
es, which is a (inali fradlion more than 14 Scots pints 3I mutchkins, or 
is decimally I4.8'77 Scots pints ; and 4 of thofe Carlifle pecks being a 
Carlifle bufliel, one third of the faid bufliel is lefs than a Wiocheiler bufliel 
by 9*7.56 inches, or nearly 3 mutchkins, 3 gills Scots. The Scots pint here 
leferred to, contains 10.34'a.

oonfiderable part is fmall and of low ralue. Befides

MiUs and MifAirr^i.— There are % milk, ooe in each pa- 
rifli. The tenants upon each eflate were formerly zeftiiA- 
cd to their refpedive mills, at a rtrj high multnr^ a* 
amounting in fome cafes to nearlj a tenth part of all the- 
grain carried to the mill \ and what is fomewhat eztraor-- 
dbarjr, the tenant was obliged to pay a very eonfidexahle 
tax for all the grain he carried ta market, without even 
the exception of wheat, which neither of the mills were 
capable of grinding. The proprietor, about 8 years ago, 
by letting the mill of Kirkconnell to that part of his te- 
nantry under aftriftion thereto, gelieved diem of this grie- 

'vaace^ 



of Kirkpatrick'Fleeming. 259 

The proprietor of Kirkpatrick mill likewiie, at 
Wfattfondaj next, liberates his tenants from ^all allriftioas 
of this kind. The cither proprietors of this pariih are un- 
der no grievances of thb kind» excepting 2 farms, which 
aflri&amp;ed to the mill of Kirkpatrick. 



jfir and Climate. — The air is rather moifty yet the in- 
habitants are in general robuft and healthy, and the open- 
nelfl of the country around, and efpecially to the £. and 
S. may contribute to this very confiderably. Few epi- 
demical difiempers have, been known in this parifli  the 
&amp;iail-poXy which was wont to carry off many, is now be- 
come more favourable, by inoculation, which, is every 
year becoming more general. No malignant fevers have 
been known for many years paft \ at times, the (low nervoua 
£ever makes its appearance, but few or none die of it, who 
otherwife enjoy a found conftitution^^ The rheumatifin 
is the moft coounon complaint ; it is pretty general among 
the lower clafs of people, efpecially when advanced in 
life, and is not unfrequent even among thofe of bett^ 
circumftances. The country being open and plam, and 
feldom infefted with fogs, the air, upon the* whole, is 
pure and healthful \ fituated at an inconfiderablediflance from 
the Solway Frith, it enjoys, with refpe£b to falubrity 
all.the advantages, without experiencing, in a high de« 
grce, the thin and nipping chillneis of a coaft fituation ; 
and though expofed to frequent and ftrong gufts of wind^ 
and heavy rains from the W. and S. yet thefe do not ieem 
to be attended with any pernicious effeds to the health of 
the inhabitants, many of whom live to an extended age. 
There is one who is 90, and another generally reputed 
at 100. But the moft extraordinary initance of longevity 
that this pariih can boaft of, was a Thomas Wiihart^ 
who lived upon the eftate of Mr Irving of Wyelbie ; he 



'26o StatifUcal Account 

was born In the parifli of Finglaffie, upon the 26th of Sep- 
tember 1635, and died upon the 19th of December 17599 
and confequentlj lived fometbing more than 114 years i 
be retained the ufe of his faculties to the laft ; had loft none 
of hb teeth \ and had the ufe of his fight in fuch perfedioo, 
that be could thread a needle with eafe. Not a days be- 
fore his death, be travelled fix miles upon very uneven 
^ound ; none ever heard him complain of his infirmit jp 
but he frequently exprefled much regret at funerals ; en- 
vying the deceafed, he was wont to fay, •* every body can 
''die but me." There lives a woman at prefent in this pa- 
rilh, aged 96, who enjoys a confiderable degree of health, 
is able to walk about, and at times to work a little. 

Population, — ^According to Dr Webfter's report, the 
number of fouls then was 1147. The population of this 
diftrifl at any fornier period cannot be precifely afcer* 
twined, there being no parochial regifter, the accuracy of 
which can be depended upon. It muft, however, upon 
fhe whole, have confiderably increafed, though by no 
means in fo bigh a {proportion,, as the prefent ftate of po- 
pulation and health of the people might have led one to 
expeft. This is owing to the greater number of emigrants, 
than the influx of ftrangers, and chiefly to the dd:ay of % 
fmall villages, which about ao years ago contained each 
upward of zoo inhabitants, and which at prefent do not 
contain both above 45. As no manufadure is carried OU' 
in this parifh, the increafe of population muft be chiefly 
owing to the increafing fpirit of agriculture. Many of 
the farms being formerly large, have, by the refpeftive 
proprietors, been divided into 2, 3, and fome even into 
more -, and fome farms have alfo been taken in from 
moors and commons, which were latdy divided. The

* Tbc differcwce between the males and the females in this parilh muft 
ftrike the moft inattentive obferver. This difTerence muft be accounted 
for chiefly from the longevity of the female, who on account of her do- 
mcftic fitnation and manner of life, being lefs expofed to irregularity and 
accidents* may be faid to enjoy a greater certainty of life than the male. 
This opioioo is confirmed by the (biking difference between the widowers 
and widows. A greater number of the males likewifc emigrate. In the 
aoaiul average of births for the laft 7 yean, the males are to the females 
in the proportion of %^ to \^\.^

Both thefe roads are of infinite advantage to this parifli,

day* of health and profpevity, to make provtfion for old age, fickneis, and 
kfirmitj. Societies «f this kind ranft have confiderable influence i\pun the 
profperity and faappinefs of a country, and coniequently n^rit every 
anention and fupport. By combining the interefts of individuals they 
have a tendency to ftrengthen the focial principle, and enlarge the oipcle

edly attempts have been made to difcover it. But whe* 
ther really no coal doth here exift, or the efforts hither- 
to made, have been too feeble to be fucceisful, remains 
for fome more eiFedual attempts to difcover. 

The parifli abounds with freeilone, very diffi*rent both 
in quality and colour ; in that part of the pariib called 
Kirkconnell, the freeftone is of a grey colour, porous, 
but hard and durable ; in Kirkpatrick, and efpecially up- 
on the banks of Kirtle, the freeftone is of a dark red co- 
lour, and in many places fo hard and fine in the grain, as 
to/plit into boards 3 quarters of an inch in thicknefs, which 
are ufed as a flate for covering houfes. But the principal 
freeftone here is found upon the eftate of Cove ; it is 
nearly of a white colour, admits of a fine polifb, and is 
very durable. It is applied in all the neighbouring pa- 
riihes, for flagging houfes, for ftairs, pillars, tomb-ftones, 
lie. for many years paft ; at an average, not lefs than 
1^5 tons of it drefled into flags, have been ihipped for 
Ireland, and 60 tons have been confumed in the country 
annually. Blocks of ftone have been raifed in this quarry, 
which meafured 34 cubic feet, and confiderably above two 
tons in weight. The quarry was rented at L. 1 1 a-year, 
but is now out of leafe. — The fuel chiefly ufed by the he- 
ritors who refide in this parifli is coal, which is generally 
carricd from the Duke of Buccleugh's collieries, in the 
pariih of Cannobie. Owing to the fcarcity there at times, 
oh account of the increafing demand of late years, and 
miferable management which for fome years thefe collie- 
ries have been under, many are obliged to carry their coal 
from Tindall Fell in Cumberlandi though an inferior coal,

however, which are now making for the better manage-

in future, the country will be better ftipplie'd. Peats, with 
which this pariih is remarkably well fupplied, form the 
chief fiiel of thofe of inferior rank. They will, however, 
be leis ufed, and their value confequently decline, as coal 
becomes more plentiful, and is more eafily obtained ; this 
bitter being efteemed not only a preferable, but upon the 
whole, a cheaper fuel.

about the didance of three quarten of a mile eaftward of Redhall, tJiere 
a the veftigc of an old camp or fortification. Some are of opinion, that 
this was formerly a Roman camp ; but this opinion is contradi^ed, bodi 
by the form of the camp and manner ofit^foitificition. Indeed, it uied 
by the Romans at all. it muft have been only as their liiiiplc caftra, and 
arefting place for refreihing the troops, upon their march between the 
ftations of. Nctherbie and Vliddlebic. It is moft probable, that thi^ was 
the camp occupied by the Engliih army, which attacked ' tlie tuwer of 
Redhall. Upon an eminence to the weilward, and nearly at the fame Jif-

Britilh. and which appear to be of the fepulchral kind. The name, indeed, 
of one, feems to favour a conjedlure of iis having been, in ancient times, 
•confecrated to the purpofcs of religion. This, which is alfo diftineiuLhcd

which name it appears to have deri\ed, from iu having been the mount

In 1483, the Duke of Albany, and Earl of Douglas, who for fome 
time had been exiles in England, wiihtng to learn the difpofitions of 
their countrymen towards thetai, made an incurfion into their native 
country. Went to Lochmaben, and' plundered' the market there. In the 
mean time, a Mailer of Maxwell, fon of Baton Maxwell of Caerlarerot:', 
upon whom the wardenihip of the borden had' devolved, in contequence 
of his father's imprifonment in England, receiving intelligence of this 
affair, aflembled his friends ai)d*^dcpendents xx^ repet and chaftiie tfie in- 
folence of thefe rebels. He came up with them at Bumiwork, wheri^ the 
motion commenced, and was Ibnght to Kirkoonnell^ when Donglas waa 
taken priibnei^ and^the DuJre of Albany made his efcape. Having now 
recovered the booty, and obtained a complete viAory, he wu purfuiog- 
the broken remains of the hoftile army ; and being wearied'wtth the fa- 
tigues of the engagement, and the wounds which he is faid to have re«- 
eeived in battle, was fupportthg himfelf with his fpear, lifting by its 
handle upon the crutch of his iaddle, when one Gals, from the parilh 
of Commectrees, who had fought under him in the engagement, cominr 
up, thruft him through, on account of a fentence, which he, as mafter 
warden of the marches, had palTed upon a coafin of Gals. This crofs is 
fftid to have been ere^ed upon the fpot where Maxwell fell, and the cx». 
ecrable deed was committixl, to perpetuate the remembrance thereof t»

THE parifli of Tell and Fetlar is one of the mod nor^ 
therlj in Shetland. It lies in latitude 6i^ so', and 
ys bounded on the N. E. by the ifland of Unft, which is 
a leagues afunder from Fetlar ; on the S. hj the ifland of 
Whelfay, and the Main Land, which is about 6 leagues 
diflant from it ; on the E. of Fetlar is the Northern Ocean, 
and about two diflant on the W. of Fetlar is the other part 
of the minifter of Fetlar's charge, called North Yell parifli, 
which was ereded into one charge, oommonlj called the 
parifli of North Yell and Fetlar, in the year 1709. As to 
the name of Fetlar, it appears to be changed from that 
which it had when it belonge4 to the Danes ; for then, as

coaotry. It is the general opinion that it was firft inhabited by the Nor- 
wegians; the writer is of a different fentiment, and believes that the 
fftds were the firft inhabitants. His reafons for diflenting from the gene- 
ral opinion are as follow :— -ift, We have no account in ancient hiftoiy, 
that the Danes were in pofleifion of this country prior to the year 850. 
In fittd year, Kenneth II. gave the Pidts fuch a total defeat, that they 
never by themielvts adventured to engage with the Scots in battle ther»- 
after ; bat were compelled to fly to the northward, as is recorded by Bede 
and Booetins, and ancient hifterians. ad. The frith that feparates Caith* 
Bcfi ftom Orkney, it called the Finland Frith, from a number of the Fids 
beifig drowned in their pafiiige over to Orkney, in order that they might 
efcipe from the fury of the Caledonians, who had expelled them out of 
die fertile plains of Caithneis and Sutherland, at the fame time that Ken- 
neth had totarlly overthrown them to the fouthward. As the number of the 
PSAs that landed upon Orkney could not be accommodated in that cous- 
try, (for it b plain from Tacitus that it had been inhabited by the Saions, 
from whom the Pi6b originally derived their origin at leail 1000 years 
before)* they fet (ail 4/r movo for the next fpot of land which was m 
tbeir view» which could be no other but the ifland of Fula ; but upoo 
their near approach to Fula, they were in the greateft pain in natuse 
what Goorfe to take. Some of them obferved the appearance of a great 
tkickneis or mift, lying diredly to the N. £, of Fula, and accordingly 
fleered their conife to the fpot where the thickeft of the £Bg appeared^ 
and then, to their very great joy, they efpicd the top of Fitfield Head, 
upon which die one that firft efpied it. cried with great raptures, Zetland^ 
i. $. there is yet land, fo we fliall all of us be iafe. Hence the name of 
Shetland took iu origin, it being very ordinary with the Saxons to u(e Z 
hiftead of Y in their language. And here it may be necefiQuy finally to 
fctttle a qucflion that has long been matter of difpute among the learned 
aoent the fituation of Thule. It is plain from Tacitus, that the Komaa 
fleet con^oexed Oilioey, and made their king, Belus, pay them tribute, in 
the iiae manner as the ceft of their provinces did : This happened in the

danger in lets than an hour's waning. But thi»ftratagem ibmetimes vras 
the caufe of their deftruAion, as Torfeus in his Hillory of Norway ac- 
quaints us. The Pi^ having fecnred themfiilves in the beft manner 
they could, in the iflands of Shetland, which then were uninhabited, they 
lent over fome of the principal men to the Court of Norway, to folicit 
aid againft the Caledonians, that they might fegain the deUcious fields of 
Caithnefs and Sutherland, from which they had been fo Utely expelled ; 
«nd their fequeft was readily complied with by the warlike Harold, who 
vkrarjily efpoufed the caufe of the exiles; and accordingly, a powerful 
Heet was put to fee without delay, and they landed at a place in this ifland 
called Fiinxie, as above ohferved; but as Harold could ntyt procure ancho- 
rage for his ileet, he failed a little to die N E. to a bay on the neighbouring 
lilind of Unft, which fttll retains his name to this day, being called Ha- 
rold*s Week ; and it is handed down by tradition from one genenttion to 
another, that this was the wty that it acquired its name. Harold con-

cabbage, radiih, and crefles feeds, grow better than any we 
import. The quantity of arable ground is but fmall, in 
comparifon of the ground ufed for paflure, and is divided 
into what is here called merks. In the ifland of Fetlar 
there are nigh 800 merk-lands ; and in North Yell there are 
636 merks ; there is no determinate quantity of ground 
aiiigned each merk-Iand. In the ifland of Fetlar there 
may be one half acre to each merk-'land ; but in North

were reduced to the difagreeable neceffity of returning to Orkney and

Climati.r-^Tht climate of this country in general is very- 
damp; we have no great fnows in winter, but a raft qnan^ 
tity of rain, and what is here called fleet, i. e, wet fnow. 
Neither are our frofts fo fevere as in England. In the 
year 17449 the Thames freezed to 1 7-} inches duck, and 
iee here at that time did not exceed 9 inches. Before traf- 
fick and commerce were introduced, this remote comer was 
the moft healthy fpot in the kingdom. There was one 
man that reached his 140th j^ear ; he married in his loodth, 
and in the year that he died, pulled afliore alone in hb 
fmallikiffin very fevere weather; and within thefe 20 
years thtre died a man in North Tell parifli, aged 120 ; 
at prefcnt there is one man in Fetlar, aged 93, suid fome 
few more above 90. But thefe are rara aves, Traffick.

and maladies of every kind prevail here perhaps with 
more violence than any where upon the Continent. But 
within thefe 20 years by-paft, tlie great Giver of every 
good and perfe£l gift to mankind, has been pleafed to vouch- 
fafe this poor land one of the moft merciful difcoveries ever 
beftowed upon finful mortals, (the fending of a Saviour ez« 
eepted), I mean inoculation, which is here pradifed with 
very great fuccefs. Befides the fmallpox, fevers of divers 
kinds prevail amongft us, particularly intermittents, which, 
though long kept under by the ufe of the bark, rarely fail 
to land either in dropfies or confumptions. The leprofy

going up to our loughs, where they depoiit their fperma 
during the winter ; fome of them are exceedingly l^rge, 
and weigh no lefs than I5 lb. a-piece ; if they are caught 
in the month of July, are nothing inferior to the richeft 
Ialmon caught in the kingdom. We have oiany mineral

of iron ore depofited at the bottom. A little below tht 
manfe of Fetlar there i^ a pretty large loch, where there is 
a kind of black fand thrown up by the N. W. wind on the 
oppofite Ihore. How fand of fuch a quality comes there 
(there bein^ no iron-ftone in its vicinity) was for a long 
time a myftery to the writer, till of late he, by accident, 
found upon the declivity of a rifidg ground, about 3-4ths 
of a mile difiant from the loch, a confiderable quantity of 
what is called bog-iron, richer and more ponderous thaii 
any he has feen at Carron, or in any other part of the

out of one pound we can extraft bj the magnet i of black- 
iron particles, nothing inferior to that which is imported to 
us from Hungary. Woods we have none in this country^ 
and it is the opinion of the writer, that there never were 
any. He has been at confiderable pains to invefligate the 
mode in which the feveral trees found here made their ap- 
pearance, but could never find one root in an horizontal 
dire£Hon, as the roots of trees are placed in other parts of 
the kingdom where wood has grown ; all were depofited 
in the earth, lying fideways in fwamps, and sfpear to 
have been conveyed thither (however diftant the period) by 
water. He is more confirmed in this opinion, when he 
confiders that no wood will thrive here above the gardea 
walls. To this may be added, that hazzle, monntain^aih, 
and elder (hrubs, are found in the mouotams, ibme miles 
from all fea, but they never grow above 8 or 9 inches bight 
and not a inches thick; which can be attributed to no other 
caufe, but that the air from one fide of the country to thfe 
other, is fo impregnated with faltifh particles^ as to fiop 
vegetation in a great meafure, unlels (as laid above) where 
there is a Ihelter. There are alfo found in the ifland fome 
veins of copper-ore, and we have great reafon to believe, 
that there is black lead, but our fmall finances prevent us 
from working them. There is alfo found here the ia^i§

lately newly bnilt, and the manfe, though an old one, is 
in tolerable good repair ; it was bnilt 37 years ago by the 
prefent incumbent out of the vacant ftipend, and he ima- 
gines it will ferve all his lifetime, as he is now 66 years of 
age, 38 of which he has been minifier in this very fiitiguing 
charge. We have few regular bred artificers here ; the 
people ure all of a mechanical turn; we have 3 fmiths in 
this miniftry, and one carpenter; but the people in gene- 
ral, according to the Daniih mode, are their own artificers. 
They are in general very quick in comprehending any 
branch of literature, or mechanical employments which 
they apply to. But tl^eir great misfortune feems to be this, 
that they never will have the patience to apply fo long to 
any one employment as to become proficients in their pro- 
feiEon. I fpeak here of the commons ; for with refpe^l to  
the gentlemen, it b believed there is no part in the king- 
dom, where genius is more difplayed, or who make greater 
progrefs in academical literature, and in the polite arts, 
which they apply to. The people in general are very 
bofpitable to ftrangers. We have here three gentlemen in

back witl) them again the King's rent, viz, cefii, fcau and 
wattle : for which there, was paid butter, and a kind of cloth 
called wadmall. This trade continued during all the time that 
this Lbrdfliip was fubjed to the Danes. At the end of the 
1 2th century the people in this Lordibip began to trade ta 
Norway on their own bottoms *, this trade continued till 
the time of Patrick Earl of Orkney, who, among the reft 
of his enormous crimes, robbed the Nifbets of Kirkabifcet- 
ter, heritors in this pariih, of the lad veiTels ufed in the 
trade. About this time the merchants in Bremen had the 
whole trade in this county, till fuch time as the gentlemen 
in the country found it convenient to take their filheries 
into their own hands, when Government thought proper to 
encourage thereto, by giving them fuch large debentures 
for the fifli exported. Within thefe 40 years trade has 
undergone the greateft change perhaps of any finall part ia 
the kingdom. At that period we had no trade with Eng- 
land, and our trade with Scotland and Hamburgh was very 
trifling. Now we have no lefs than 8 veflels, who trade 
to England, Leith, Holland, Hamburgh, and Bergen, ex 
clufive of 5 or 6 flxips^ which we annually load for tlie 
Mediterranean.

fapplj them with meal for the fdpport of their &amp;milies. 
One great advantage that we . enjoy is, that we have 
abundance of fiiel at a verj reafonable price. £ut on 
the otbe.r hand we labour nnder many hardibips. Our 
lanns are divided, into fuch fmall p arcels, that the peo- 
ple who cultivate thefe fmall fpots are a good many 
of them poor; and with the greatefi difficulty live upon 
their (mail farms the half of the year. Our crops are fee- 
ipiently bhfted w^ frofts and .mildews, and this has been 
the cafe for thefe feveral yesM» bypaft ; fo that we bend our 
thoughts more to improve our liberies than our crops, a&amp; 
they are fo very precarious in this climate. But in this, 
whidi IB a. principal article of commerce, we labour under 
xonfiderabk clogs. The high duty that muft be paid for 
home fait, that we are under the neceffity of uiing, bears 
very heavy upon us ; but this hardflup has been fet forth 
by a much abler pen than the writer can pretend to, and 
theref^r^ he does not choofe to {ay more on that fubjed. 
To condode this narrative, the writer is forry to fay, that 
withia thefe few years a very pernicious and ruinous policy 
has taken place here. Our very prudent anceftors would 
not have let their lands to any one unleis his moral cha- 
rafler was good, , and he had a vifible fund to fupport him« 
felf and his family \ but now a contrary method of proce- 
dure is greedily adopted by fome of the heritors of this pa- 
rilh, for they let their lands to perfons of abandoned cha« 
raders, if they are only good fi(hers ; but this piece of poli-* 
cy is abfurd to the higheft degree. Every one knows that

The commons, on the other hand, are eqoallj inconfiflenr 
in their condnd, for formerly their elodiing was only foch 
as was manufadnred about their own hoofes, bnt now they 
mttft be habited like ^gentlemen, and many of them are 
more extravagant in the luxuries of life than the gentlemen 
formerly were in this country. Though their mafien af- 
ford them a higher price for their fifli, butter, and ofl, than 
was ever given in the land, yet it anfwers no end ; they are 
fo addified to drefs, fpiritous liquors and tea, that a confi- 
derable part of their gain is fpent in that way. They ftill 
retain a good deal of the difpofition of their anceftors the 
Danes ; they think themfelves the greateft flaves in nature, 
and that their maders take every thing from them for no- 
thingi vainly imagining, that they would be happier in nay 
place than in their own native foil* They accordingly enter 
on board the navy in crowds, where they are efteemed failors 
inferior to none in the kingdom. In one word, the writer^ 
after 40 years ftudy of the conftitution of this conntry, muft 
frankly own, he can fee no way of preventing the impend- 
ing ruin of the poor land in general, and of every hone(( 
man in particular, unlefs the gentlemen of the country, una 
voce, enlarge their farms in the firft place, and then let them 
to none, unlefs fuch as are of approved morals. Next, that 
rfiey put the laws of their country in execution againft 
fome few of the many culprits, that have infefted this 
country for a number of years bypaft. Laflly, it would 
contribute greatly to the profperity of the country in ge- 
neral, that the one half of the fuperfluities imponed an- 
nually were curtailed -, were this done, it would tend greatly 
to the advantage of the landholders, and flill more fo to 
^e people in general. Bnt fuch a happy change the 
y^rriter is afraid he never wDl fee. However, he has this

SOUTH UIST, or, as it b called South WIft by fome 
modem writerSi is a Danilh name, and the deriva- 
tion of it cannot be traced back with anj degree of cer^. 
taint J, hy anj of the prefent inhabitants, at this period 
of time. Perhaps it might originallj be called Uifta, 
or Wifta, as I am informed that there are fome places, 
both in Orkney and Shetland, called Unfta ; for the high* 
efi hiU^n the pariih,.is named I^eckla, and the largeft moan^ 
tain in Iceland is Heckla, in the Norfe language. Thepa*^ 
riih is of an oblong figure, feparated from the parilh of 
North Uift, to the eaftward and northward, by an arm of 
the fea, which ebbs at low water. It is alfo feparated 
from the pariih of Barra, to the fouthward and weftward.

bj a channel or found, nearlj 8 or 9 miles broad, which 
never ebbs \ towards the W. and N. W. it is bounded bj 
the great Atlantic ocean, and to the eaftward and fouth* 
ward, it is feparated from the ifland of Sky bj a channel, 
perhaps 18 or 20 nules broad. The pariih is long, from 
N. £. to S. W. 30 computed miles, and its greateft 
breadth maj be edimated from 7 to 9 miles. 

5oi% Smfaciy ChtiM^^ iSc. — ^Towards the weft fide of 
the pariih, the foil is totally light, and perfeAly fandj, 
and the moft part of it rendered quite ufdeis, by the fe- 
verity of the conftant ftorms, that blow from the W. with 
the force of the fea, during the winter and fpring feafons ; 
further back, there is one continued chain of fwamp and 
lakes, abounding with the greateft variety of the fineft 
tronts ; and ftill to the eaftward, there are high and lofty 
mountains, covered with heath and verdure, fit enough 
&amp;r pafturing black cattle, horfes, flieep, and goats, during 
the fumme^ and autumn months. The well known har- 
bours in the pariQi, worth mentioning, v/2. Lochikiport, 
Lochunort, and Lochboifdale, arq fo accurately and clearly 
hud down by Mr Murdoch Mackenzie, the furveyor, in 
his draughts of this coaft, that it is quite unneceflary to 
mention them here. As the foil to the weft fide of the 
pariih b for the moft part light and iandy, it of courfe 
muft be barren of itfelf, without the force of manure* 
There are delightful fields to be feen covered with the 
fineft natural grais in fummer; yet, in the winter feafon^ 
many of tbefe very fpots are covered over with drifted 
land in fuch a manner, that the leaft trace of verdure can- 
not be leen for many months. Were it not for the im« 
mentt quantity of floating fea-ware that is thrown a-ihore 
during the winter-ftorms, the inhabitants never could ma*

nure the ground, fo as to raife % crop that fignifiedy of any 
kind. Barlej, oats, rje, and potatoes, with filh, are the 
chief produdions for the fupport of the inhabitants of th e 
parilh. It ought to be obferved, alfo/that the produce of 
the country does not ferve the people for 9 months in the 
year, at an yearly average. 

From the great number of fwamps and lakes in the pa* 
rifli, the air o^ courfe mull be moift and damp. The 
inhabitants are often fubjeft, in open feafons^ to fever and 
rheumatifm ; notwithftanding, there are feveral inftances 
of long-lived people in the parlihy to die advanced age of 
90 years. 

ProduRtons* — The well known article of kelp is the fta- 
ple cothmodity of the pariflii of which 11 00 tons may be 
yearly manufafihired at an average ; and this quantity^ in 
a great meafure, depends on the drynels and ferenity of 
the feafouy for making fea-ware into kelp. Next to kelp, 
black cattle is the only article that brings any return to 
the pariih. There may be fold, at a moderate calculation, 
about 450, or even 480 head of cows and young ozeh year- 
ly, (hould the preceding fpring-feafon turn out favourable ; 
and in bad years, the number of cattle fold in the pariih 
will not amount to what is fpecified above. Confidering 
the great rifk, expenfe, and trouble that the buyers and 
dealers in black cattle are at, in coming to this remote 
ifland to buy them ; again, the di&amp;idvantage of ferrying 
the cattle, purchafed in the pariih, to the contipent of 
Scotland \ it cannot be a matter of furprife, ihonld their 
price be low, which is nearly, at an average, L. 2, 10 s. 
a-head yearly ; and with refpefi to the price of kelp, 
which, for a great number of years, is confiderably fallen 
in its value, it ought to be obferved, in giving an account 

of 



tf South Uift. :a95 

•f that once valaable commodity^ that its fudden low pricci 
is owing to the great importation of barilla and other fo« 
reign aflieSy at a (ow duty. 

Shgep* — The number of (beep in the parifli does not ex- 
ceed 7000. The (beep are, for ordinary, of the fmall 
Highland breed, their mutton fweet and delicious, and 
their wool of a very good quality, exceeding in finenefs 
the wool of any fheep imported to the parifh, from the 
main land of Scotland. There was an attempt made 
ibme years ago, by fome gentlemen, to import fome black- 
bced (beep ; but a diforder, well known by the name of 
braxy, got among them, and the crofs-breed flill die of 
that diforder, though not in fuch numbers as the low-country 
breed, originally imported. There are no (beep, to any 
valne, fold in the parifh, only a few to vefTels, who put 
ID to harbours by contrary winds ^ the inhabitants find ufe 
both for their wool and mutton, 

Hor/es.'-^Tht number of horfes in the parifli, at an a* 
verage, may be called 800 ; they are of a fmall breed, 
incredibly ftrong and hardy, confidering their fize. Tho 
great fatigue and toil they undergo, during winter and 
fpring« in leading fea-ware from the ihore to manure the 
ground for barley and potatoes ; add to this, the making 
of kelp in fummer, and their feeding on fandy foil, for the 
greateft part of the year, all this of courfe mud foon render 
them ufeleis. Rearing, and buying horfes in this pariih, is one 
of the greatefi difadvantages ; for without the labour of hor- 
fes, the kelp is unmanufa&amp;ured in fummer, and the ground 
Qnmannred in winter. A young horfe or mare, fit for 
labouring, cannot now be purchafed below L. 5 Ster- 
ling.

^Goats, Game, lie. — There are foms goats- in the ptfiflu 
that pafture the ,eaft fide, belonging to £dme gentlemen, 
but thej are few in number, and of no confe^uence ; there. 
18 fomc deer and rabbits, which are pre&amp;rved by the pro- 
prietors. The panfb abounds in game of the aquatic 
fpecies, of every kind to be fcen in the Hebrides, namely, 
Avans, wild-geefe, lierons, cormorants, ducks, tealst, fo- 
Ion geefe, and curlews. Game, to be found in the moun- 
tains, are, moor or heath- fowls, woodcocks, and pigeons, 
carnivorous birds in great numbers, fach as, eagles, hawks, 
falcons, ravens, and grey crows, in ail fealbns of the 
year. ' 

Fi/beries^ Uc. — ^There is no trade or manufadares car- 
ried on in the parifli, either in the iooportation or exporta- 
tion line, only the kelp and black cattle, mentioned above. 
It is very certain, that the coalb of the parifh, both to- 
wards the eail and weft fide of it, abound wjith every fpe*- 
cies of fiih, to be found in the Hebrides ; fuch as, her- 
rings, lingY cod, mackerel, turbot, ikate, and flounder, 
befides the greateft variety of Ifaell-fifli, viz. lobftcrs, 
crabs, cockles, oyilen, mufclcs, and fpout^fifli. There are 
numbers of whales, feen at all feafons of the year, on the 
coafls of the parifli \ but the fiibermen, as yet, do not un- 
derftand the proper method of harpooning them, as the 
whales do not remain above the furfisce of the fea for any 
length of time. The fail fifli, or barking (bark, appears on 
the coaftsof the pariih early in the month of May, if the fea- 
fon is warm ; he is a ftupid and torpid kind of fiih ; he allows 
the harponeer often to feel him with his hand, before be 
darts at him. ^ The inhabitants to the eaft fide of the ifland, 
(fuch as are able to fit out boats, lines, and harpoons,) have 
been for fome years vttj fuccelsfiil during die fttmmer

months. In this branch of bufioelsy owing entirelj to the 
fauidable exertions of the truflees for managing the fiflieries 
in Scotland, in granting premiums to the owners of boats, 
that extrad the greateft quantity of oil from the liver of 
tiie barking^ fliark. The lucky adventurer in this fiihing, 
ihould he chance to harpoon a large one, may have 9 or 
10 barrels of liver, from which the return in clear oil is 
about 8 barrels. The ling and cod fiOieries along the 
coafis of the paiifli deferve the attention of the public,' 
ibould this branch of trade be carried on with diligence and 
pcrfeverance by monied people. The banks for ling, cod, 
Ikate, and turbot, are now difcovered in the fuUeft extent, 
Co anfwer as well as the Shetland coaft. Colin Macdonald 
of Boifdale, £fq; one of the heritors in the parifli, is the 
only perfon here who attempted to carry on this branch 
of the fiiberies with any degree of fucceis, excepting fome 
adventurers from Peterhead, who come to the coaft here 
to fiih in March, and return in July generally pretty fuc« 
ce&amp;ful. The herring-filhing is the great objed in the fiih- 
ing trade, to the inhabitants of the pariih ; notwithftaad- 
ing, this branch of the fiflieries cannot be carried on to any 
great degree, while the fait laws, continue in their prefent 
form. The fevere laws, with refpe&amp; to the importation 
of fait to thefe remote parts, is the greateft fliackle that 
the invention of /nan could find out, to put a ftop to the 
indufiry of the poor inhabitants of the pariih. It is there* 
fore hoped, that our wife legiflators will remedy this evil 
in a ftiort time, according to their acpuftomed goodnefi, 
and prevent the misfortunes that follow of courfe to many 
of the poor inhabitants of the Hebrides. 

Population. — ^According to Dr Webfter's report, the 
jmmber of fouls in 1755 was 2209. The population of 
the parifii has of late years confiderably dimini(hed« Its

inhabitantB may now amount to 34509 of which number^ 
there are 500 Proteftants, and the remaining 2950 Ron[iaQ 
Catholics. The great caufe of the decreafe of populatioo 
in the pariflii is owing principallj to the vaft numbers that 
have emigrated of late years to the ifland of St John 's» 
Nova Scotia, and Canada, Emigration from the parifli 
commenced in 1772; and again, no leis than 400 ftout 
young feUows iince that period, have gone as recruits to 
the army and navy from the pariih. The inhabitanu are 
induftrious, and a very hardy fet of mankind, able to un- 
dergo great fatigue *, they are particularly attached to the 
I^oyal Family, and the Eftabliihed Conflitution. 

Stipend^ Heritors^ Poor. — The value of the living in the 
pariih, including the glebe, is about L. 50 Sterling. It is 
a royal patronage. The heritors are, John Macdonald of 
Clanranald, £fq; and Colin Macdonald of Boifdale, £fq^ 
The manfe is in ruins, and quite uninhabitable -, the incum- 
bent dwells in a farm-houfe in the middle of the pariih. 

In a didrift of the pariih, called Benbecula, a miflionary 
reiides, with L. 30 of a falary, paid by the truilees for 
managing the royal bounty. There has beep no church 
built in the pariih fince the time of the Reformation. 
The Proteftants aflemble in two fchool-houfes, which are 
now in good order and repair, and the Roman Catholics 
have three mafs-houfcs in the pariih. As to the ilate of 
the poor of the pariih, there is only a fund of L. 10 Ster- 
ling yearly, which was mortiiicd by Alexander Macdo- 
nald of Boifdale, Efq; lately dcceafed ; the fund is diilri- 
buted impartially by his fon Colin Macdonald, Efq; with 
additional donations of his own. The people of both per- 
fuafions, in general, are attentive and generous to the poor, 
in fuppljing them with meal, according to their abilities, 
in feafoRs of fcarcity.

out in paying the kelp manufadnrers. One heritor refides 
now in the parifli. 

AtUiquities.^-^Yht only thing remarkable in this way to 
be obferved in the parifh, are the remains of the Danifli 
forts, which are all built in a circular form, of large whin 
fioneSy without any kind of cement ; thefe towers, or forts, 
are to be feen in all the Hebrides. In the ifland of Ben-

Vealla, the remains of one of thefe towers, of a very large 
fize, are to be feen ; the name is Dun Elvine nean Ruarie, 
or the Tower of Elvina, the daughter of Rory ; this £lvina 
being the daughter of fome Danifli chieftain, as traditionary 
account telb. There are alfo the nemains of Druidical tem- 
ples ftill vifible in many parts of the parifli. Although 
by tradition, it is faid, that this ifland, in old times, abound*

wood of different kinds, but there is the greateft probabili*

to it by the Danes, when in poiTeffion of thele countries*

quented by (hips trading from Ireland, and the W. of 
England and Scotland to the Baltic. It extends 5 or 6 
miks into the country, and, on account of the great nnni'i*

which are all £ife and commodious. Thb is certainly one 
of the heft ftations for a village in the Weftem Iflands, *

IJlandi* — A league to the northward of North Uift lies 

Borera jy a fertile ifland, a mile and a half long, and half a 

mile broad. It is prelentlj poflefled by a gentleman of 

the name of Maclean, whofe predeceflbrs have been in 

poiTcflion of it for feveral generations back, one of whom, 

for Cervices done to the family of Macdoaald, obtained, 

for the iinall yearly rent of L. xa Sterling, a very long leafe 

^^^^ 57 7^^n of which are to run after the prefent pof* 

ieflbr's demife. Between this ifland and the main land of 

North Uift lies Orinfay, an ifland only at high water half 

a mile long, the foil fandy for the moft part, but fertile in 

fiLvourable feafons. 3 miles weflfward of the laft mentioned 

ifland, but fiill N. of the main land of North Uift, lies Val- 

hj, alfo an ifland only at high water, and iieparated from 

the fliore, when the tide is out, by a fand % miles broad. 

It is a mile and a half long, not half a mile broad, the 

Ibtl for the moft part fandy. It is beautiful and fertile in 

com and grals, when the fummer is rainy, but yields 

very little of either when the feafon b the reverfe. In 

t|^e winter and fpring it is quite barren, the furface 

being covered with &amp;nd, which a gale from the N. W* 

never fails to blow over it. a leagues to the weftward 

of North Uift lies Heiiker, nearly 2 miles in length, but 

very narrow. The foil is fandy, yields very little grafs 

at any time, and is only valuable on account of its kelp 

ihores, and a (mall quantity of grain it produces. The 

iflands of Kirkboft and Ileray lie ftretched along the W. 

coaft of North Uift, pretty clofe to it, and feparated 

from it, and from one another, by a iand which the £ea 

overflows at high water. The former is x mile long, but 

very 



304 Stati/lical Account 

very narrow; the foil fandj, lies quite ezpofed to the 
Wefiern Ocean, which makes yearly encroachments, and 
b in danger of being foon blown away by the wind. The 
latter b 3 miles long, and half a mile broad in moil places. 
The foil is partly (andy, and partly black groond, yielding 
tolerable crops of barley and pafture for cattle. South of 
the main land of North Uift, between it and Benbecula, lies 
Grimfay, an ifland only at high water. This is a barren 
iiland, % miles in length, and covered with heath ; but is 
very valuable on account of its kelp ihores. It is in the 
pofleflion of Mr Maclean of Boreray, and is included in 
the long leafe already mentioned. 

Product' — ^Barley and fmall oats are the only kinds of 
grain that this parilh produces; the quantity and value of 
which can hardly be afcertained, on account of the variable- 
neis of the feafons. The only method of findbg out, with 
any degree of precifion, the average quantity, is firom a 
ftate of the multure. The 13th part of the grain ground 
in the mills is taken up by the millers for multure, of 
which they are obliged to pay 180 bolls to the prqrietor. 
As they are bound to keep the mills (of which there are 3 
in the pariih) in repair, they will require 8 bolls each for 
that purpofe; and alfo 18 bolls each for the fupport of 
their families, fo that the 13th part will amount to 258, 
a^nd confequently the whole that is brought to the mills 
will amount to 3354 bolls, Befides thb quantity, there 
are at leaft joo boUs given as provender to cows and horfes. 
In favourable feafons, indeed, the quantity will be a great 
deal more ; but in bad feafons it will fall far ihort of it. A 
dry fummer fcorches the fandy foil, and a wet ftormy au- 
tumn deflroys every thing the ground produces. A fcarcity 
is the confequence. In this cafe, recourfe mud be had to the 
importation of low*country meal, which is purchafed at 



Of North Vijl. 305 

an average for 17 s. the boll ; bnt in very bad years, fiich 
as the years 1783 and X784, at 243. The feafon, indeed, 
mail be very favourable, when the country produces a 
quantity fufficient for the fupport of the inhabitants. The 
returns in barley are from 15 to 20, though there are a few 
joftances of more than 50 fold. The boll of this country 
meal confifts of 16 pecks \ and if at any time a pr rfon has 
any that he can difpofe of to his neighbour, it is fold at 13 s* 

4 d. Potatoes are alfo a confiderable part of the pro- 
duce of this parifli, being cultivated for a few years back 
to a much greater extent than fotmerly. The quantity 
cannot be afcertained ; but it is become fo plentiful, that it 
makes the principal part of the food of the inhabitants for 

5 months of the year. The manure chiefly ufed here is 
fea-weed, which is thrown upon the fliores in bad weather. 
This manure, though favourable to the produftion of bar- 
ley, does not at all enrich the ground fo much as dung, 
which is alfo ufed, though not in great quantities. Kelp 
is the principal part of the produce of this pariih, the ma- 
nufafluriflg of which was totally unknown here, as well as 
in every other part of the Highlands, till about the year 
1735, when it was but imperfeftly introduced by one 
Rory Macdonald, whom a gentleman in this country 
(Hugh Macdonald, late tackfman of Ballifliar) had invited 
over from Ireland, for the purpofe of making experi- 
ments*. The quantity of kelp manufadtured yearly in

Cowsy Hor/eSf and Sleep. — Though there may be about 
aooo cows, yet the number exported yearly will not ex- 
ceed 300, owing to the numbers that die of want, and to 
diftempers, to which they are^here more liable than in any 
other part of the Highlands. They are fold in the month 
of June at a public fair, to drovers from different countries, 
at different prices, according to their value, £rom L. 2, 5 s* 
to L. 2, 15 s. a-head ; and there have been a few inllances 
of parcels drawing L. 3. llie riik and expenfe of ferrying 
cattle to the ifle of Sky, make them of lefs value here 
than in that country. The price of a milch -cow is at an 
average L. 3, 10 s. The ntimber of horfes may amount 
at lead to 1600. Their value in general is from L. 2 to 
Ja. 6, excepting a few that the principal tackfmen keep for 
the plough, which may be valued from L.8 to L. 15 *,

• It may be a matter of furprife, that one parifli fliould require as many 
horfes as a county in fome other parts of th« kingdom. But when it is 
confidered, that the fandy foil here requires a greater quantity of manure 
than any other ; that this manure is carried (not in carts, but in fmall 
creels on hoifeback) to the diilance of a mile in fome places; that th^ '

nant endeavours to rear as many as will furnifli kim

thrive fo well as to enable the tenant to export any. The 
aomber of (heep in the whole partlh may amount to near 
5000, of a very fmall unmixed breed, covered with fine 
ihort wool, of which about 1 5 fleeces go to a ftone. The 
price of a flieep trith lamb is 4 s. 6 d. and of a wedder the 
fame. 

Implements of Hujbandry. — -Although no country can be 
more capable of being improved than this, little has hi- 
therto been done to recover it from a ftate of nature. The 
implements of hufbandry, with very few exceptions, are the 
fame kind that were ufed a century back. The plough ge- 
nerally ufed is little known any where elfe beyond the 
Long liland. It is drawn by 4 horfes, has only one handle, 
which the perfon who directs it holds in his right hand, ai 
he walks befide it, having in his left a lafii to drive the 
horfes. Before this plough is a machine drawn by one 
horfe, to which is fixed a crooked iron, of the form of a 
reaping-hook, to cut the ground, fo that the plough may 
torn it up with greater facility. The number of men and 
horfes requifite to keep this plough a-going, makes it very 
ezpenfive. It requires one mian to dired the plough, and 

another 

ploofli ufed here retjuifei more horfes to keep 2t agoing than any other ; 
that the fuel is can ied in the fame manner that the manure is, at the 
diftance of a mile and a half, and % miles in fome places; that the kelp 
ware is led bj horfes from the ihore to the drying ground, and iv. m thence 
to the kilns, in which it is to be burnt ; the occaHon for fuch a number of 
l.orfe« will in fome meafuri be accounted for. The great number of 
working Iiorft« requifite to carry on the bulinefs of the farmer does not 
allow him to keep breeding maref^, fu that horfes are in great numben 
yearly imported from the ifle of Sky and Lewis, which occafiom a con.

another to lead the horfes, one to direft the iron that cuts 
the ground before the plough, and another to lead thehorfe 
that draws it. The gentlemen who pofleis the principal 
ferms have given np this auk ward machine, and introdnced 
in its place the plough generallj ufed in the low country^ 
which they find much more convenient. The thin gnnmdy 
which does not admit of the plough, is turned up with an 
' inftrument called the crooked fpade, which is defcribed bj 
Dr Johnfon in his tour. There are only 8 carts in the 
parifli, where fome hundreds might be ufed to advantage \ 
moft of the farms being fo level, that carts might be eafily^ 
drawn over them. 

Climate, — In no cq|intry can the climate be more varia- 
ble than in this. There are inftances of froft, ihow, fleet, 
and deluges of rain, in the courfe of the fame day. High 
gales of wind are frequent throughout the year, but parti- 
cularly the vernal and autumnal equinoxes are attended 
with florms that fometimes prove fatal in their effirds upon 
corn and cattle. Weflerly winds, with hazy weather, 
prevail for two-thirds of the year. At the fame time, the 
climate is not unhealthy, there being no diftcmpers pecu- 
liar to it; coughs, colds, and the rheumatilm, prevail 
here as in other places. 

Frejh IVater Lakes, — ^There is fuch a number of freCi- 
water lakes in this parifh, that a perfon flanding on the 
top of a hill in the middle of it, would imagine, that ith 
part of it is covered with water. Some of thefe kkes 
are very large, and contain a great number of rocks 
and iflands, where wild-fowl, fuch as geefe, ducks, fea- 
gulls, &amp;c. build their nefis, and hatch their young. The 
whole of them are full of trout, which, in fiie and quality, 
are equal to any in the kingdom.

State of Propirty. — ^Lord Macdonald is fole proprietor 
^£ this pariili, and his predeceflbrs have been in polTeflioii 
of it for feveral centaries back. He is the reprefentativc 
of the Eark of Rofs, whofe hiilorj is well known, and 
^wrho, in point of power and antiquity, yielded to none of 
€he Scots barons. The rents in the year 1763, including 
kelp-ihoresy amounted to upwards of L. I2C0. In 177 1, 
ihey amounted to L. 1800, including kelp-fhores. The 
prefent land-rents amount to L. 2100, befides the profits 
arifing from the fale of 800 tons kelp, the amount of 
which cannot be afcertained, on accouilt of the flufiuating 
ftate of the price of that article. The tenants may be di- 
^ vided into a clafles : ift^ The gentlemen farmers or tackf^- 
Hien, who poifefe one or more farms each \ and, 2dly^ The 
fmall tenants, a number of whom live together in a farm, 
according to the value and extent of it. The division of 
tenants into thefe two clafTes is not peculiar to this parifh, 
but extends to all the weftern iflands, and the adjacen^^ 
parts of the continent. The firfl of thefe clafTes,' name- 
ly, the gentlemen farmers, are for the mod part the de- 
fcendents of the different branches of the families of the 
chieftains, on whofe eflate they live. Of old, when the 
chieftains lived upon their own eftates, and had no encou- 
ragement to fend their younger fons as adventurers to a 
foreign land, they planted them about them upon their own 
properties, and gave them portions of lands for fmall year- 
ly rents, which were continued with their defcendents from 
one generation to another. At the expiration of ouq 
leafe, another was granted nearly upon the iame terms *.

The prefent fet of geDtlemen farmers in, this pariih, are/ 
though few in nambefy men of a liberal education, iw'bo 
ivould be an ornament to focietj even in a more public part 
of the kingdom. They are renowned for their hofpita* 
lit J, which the flrangers, who travel through the country, 
can atteft, and which they find very convenient, there be- 
ing no inns or public houfes for their accommodation. 

The 2d clafs of tenants have the lands divided in fmall 
portions among them. The divifion of farms is into pen- 
nies, half-peiyiieSy and farthings. The greateft part of 
this clafs of tenants poflefs half a-penny each, fome one- 
third of a penny, and fome one-fourth, or a farthiojf 
lands. All the cattle on the fame farm feed in comoion, 
each tenant being reftrided to a certain number, according 
to his divifion of lands. The (late of this clais of tenants 
will bed be illuftrated by an inftance ; fo that when the in- 
comes and expenfes are compared, a difcovery will be made 
«on which fide the balance lies. A tenant polTefling half a 

X penny 

the guardian of his cblldren, and the executor of his will ; which truft 
was in general executed with fidelity. On the other hand, when the 
chieftain was threatened with danger from the invafion or encroachmenty 
of his neighbours, his gentlemen flocked to his caitle to affill in his deli* 
bcrations, and to offer their fervices. If war was determined upon, they, 
with their adherents, followed him to the field, to fupport his pretenfions, 
and (hare his fate. By this means the ftrongeft attachment was eftablilh- 
ed between them, partly on the ties of confanguinity, and partly on mu- 
tual fervices. This attachment continued unimpaired, till the rebellion 
in tbe year 17451 which, though attended with the happy confequence of 
civilizing the Highlanders, and making them good and loyal fubjedls, 
yet was attended with this difad vantage, that it weakened the attach- 
ment between the chieftains and their people ; for Unce that period, the 
chieftains, from different motives, have withdrawn themfelves from' 
their eliates, have bccv^me unacquainted with their people, whom they 
vifit but feldom, are not fo attentive to the ties of confanguinity, and aire 
become lefs fcnipulons in removing the tackfmen from their farms, if t'

will be killed, in order to have 2 of the cows coupled, a- 
nother may be fuppofed to die by accident, or through

that this man has only one cow yearly to difpofe of, for 
whl^b he may be allowed to draw L. 2, 8 s. at an average, 
and which, added to the L. 6 above mentioned, will a- 
mount to the fum of L. 8, 8 s. This is his whole year- 
ly income, having nothing elfe that he can turn into 
money. On the other hand, this man pays L. 5, 4 s. rent, 
including public burdens. As he muft keep 6 horfes, he 
will be under the necefiiAy of buying one every fecond 
jear, at the average price of L, 3, 10 s. which makes L. i, 
15 s. a-year. Though in an extraordinary good year, his 
loads may fupply his family with meal, yet he is for or* 
dlnary obliged to buy that necefTary article; fo that 
matters are not exaggerated, when it is faid, that he buys 
I boll ay ear, at the average price of 17 s. From thb 
Ratement, this tenant has only a balance of 12 s. in his 
favour, for the purpofe of buying all his other nccefTaries ; 
fuch as timber, for keeping his houfes, implements of huf« 
bandry, and perhaps boat, in repair ; for buying iron, tar, 
fpades, flax, and feveral other articles that a tenant has oc« 
cafion for throughout the year. This man, therefore, will 
\ either fall in arrears to the proprietor, or become indcbt- 
I ed to thofe from whom he buys his neceiTaries ; fo that if 
the proprietor's chamberlain fhould be rigorous in taking 
pp the rents, and others in exading their lawful debts,

' Km^atums, — ^The fudden rife of the Itnd-rents was 
/Dertaiolj the original caufe of emigrations from the iile of 
Sky and Uift Co America. Thofe who found a'difficultj 
in fupporting their families when the rents were low, could 
not be perfuaded that any exertions in induftry would e« 
nable them to live with any degree of comfort, when raifed 
a third more at leaft. This determined feyeral of them to 
look out for an afylum fome where elfe. Copies of lettess 
from perfons who had emigrated feveral years before to 
America, to their friends at home, containing the moft 
flattering accounts of the province of North Carolina, were 
circulated among them. The implicit fidth given to theiie 
accounts made them refolve to defert their native country, 
and to encounter the dangers of crolfing the Atlantic to 
iettle in the wilds of America. From 1771 to 1775, fe- 
veral thouiSuids emigrated from the weftem Highlands to 
America, among whom w^re more than 200 from' North 
Uift. Thefe in their turn gave their friends at home the 
fame flattering accounts that induced themfelves to go, fo 
that thefe countries would in a fliort time have been drained 
of their inhabitants, had it not been for the American war. 
However, it will be acknowledged, that in this pariih, 
thofe who took the benefit of the leafes granted at that 
that time, never lived in greater affluence than during the 
currency of them, owing to the fiidden and great advance 
in the price of kelp, occafioned by the American war. 
Since the clofe of the war, the rage for emigration has 
broke out again in diflPerent parts of the Highlands. To 
produce this, other caufes have concurred with that already 
mentioned. The fenfe of grievances, whether real or ima- 
ginary ; the fear of having the fruits of their induftry called 
for by their landlords, many of whom think they have a 
right to the earnings of the tenants, except what barely 
Rapports life \ the want of employment for iiich as have

no lands to ctiktvate; the encoangemcatB held out to them 
by their fneods, who are already fettled in that country, 
of living in a fiate of much greater affluence with le&amp; la* 
hour ; and the facility of procuring a property for a fbiaU 
fuoB of money« the produce of which they can call their 
own, and from whieh their removal does not depend oa 
the will of capricioua maften. Thefe are the principal 
motives that determine people now to emigrate to America, 
without at all attending to the difficulties and diicourage* 
ments in their way, arifing from the danger they muft ea- 
eonoter in croffing the feas ; the expenfe and trouble of 
removing with their fiEimilies fome jiop miles from (bore, 
for the benefit of enjoying the fociety of their friends, who 
have gone before them ; the inconvenience of buying ^11 
their neceffariesy till fuch time as they are enabled to live 
by the fruits of their own labour, and die di&amp;creenble ef- 
fcAs that a change of cUmate may have on their healths 
and eonftitutions. This contagion has not, indeed, done 
much to the psejudice of this pariih finoe the dofis of the 
American war, excepting, that after a leafe that. Lord Mac- 
dooald had of his lands lately, there were fome murmnr- 
ings, which produced a general defire to emigrate, but 
which his Lordlhip in fome meafure removed by augment- 
ing the manufaduring fees of kelp ; however, the people 
are ftill in fbch a ftate of fufpenfe, that very trifling cir- 
cumflances may weigh down the fcale in favour of emi- 
gration. To put a flop to the prefent rage for emigration 
requires very nice management in the proprietors. The 
old attachment between them and their people mufi in 
Ibme meafure be renewed ; .long leafes.muft bfS gt;an|Dtd to 
fecure the tenants the polTcffion of their lands fer a period 
of years, to remove their apprehenfions .of frequent calls 
upon them for an augmentation of rent. A melioration

The Highlands have a claim upon the attention of Go- 
vernment, being inhabited by as loyal fnbjeds as can be 
found in his Majefty's dominions, aad having ftimiflied; 
{reqnently, ikimbers of brave fellows, who have figna- 
Uz d themfelves in all the comers of the world, fighting foir 
their Kin^ and country. It is a matter of furprife, that the 
Highlands have fo long been neglefted by Government, and 
that while they lay out fo much of the public money in 
fettling diftant colonies, a channel fliould be left open, 
whereby a confiderable part of the mother country may be 
drained of its valuable inhabitants ; but this cannot long be 
the cafe ) it is to be hopedt that the time is approachbg when 
a relaxation from war, and other objeds of importance, will 
afford them leifure to direft their attention to thefe remote 
comers. Then means will be made ufe of that will be 
adequate to an objeft ^ fuch magnitude as the improve- 
ment of the Highlands. Towns and villages will rife in

fiill makes a rapid prqgreis, will then increaiie tb a mach 
greater degree » an entire ftop will be put to the ipirit for 
emigration ; new fources of wealth will ipring up from an 
extenfion of commer^ and manufiiAbresi a nnrierj for 
feamen, in which the ftrength of the Britiih nation in a 
great meafure confifts, will be eftabliflied : So that the High-

a flouriihing part of the Britiih empire. 

Antiquititu — ^There. is a number of Druidical temples 
in this pariih, differing little from others in feveral parts of 
the Highlands, which are already defcribed, particularly by 
Dr Smith of Campbeltown, in his hiftory of the Iniidi» 
There are a very large heaps of ftones, thrown together 
without order or regularity, near the tops of two hills in 
the middle of the pariih. What makes thefe any way re- 
markable, is their great iize, and their di&amp;ance from any 
place where ftones could be found. Some of the ftones are 
fo large, that it is inconceivable by what mode of convey- 
ance they were carried up hill to the ground where they 
lie. They feem to be the tumuli of leaders of great in- 
fluence, who have iignalized themfelves by their valour or 
accompliihments *•

low-country meal, and fome other ufefnl and neceflary ar-

arifing from the number of horfes they muft keep, the la- 
bour and expeufe of iecurihg fiiel, and the want of tioi- 
ber, which they muft buy from other countries at a dear 
rate, have already been obferved : but one great difadvan- 
tage they labour under, and for which a remedy has been 
offered, is, that the means they enjoy of being inftruAed 
in religious and ufefiil knowledge, are not adequate to 
thefe great ends. For it is impoffible that one clergyman,

* For it is evident, thit the Uin makes conliderable encroacIimentK, evea 
in the courfie of one generation, fo that in the courfe of many, it may be 
fuppofed to have waflied away a great extent of coiuitry. The rocks and 
ihoais, and banks of faad, extending a great way to the weft, corroborate 
this hypotheiis. There are 2 rocks to the weftward, the one at the dif- 
tance of i6, and the other, of 4 miles from fliore, inhabited only by 
feals, which the pof&amp;flbrs of the firms thefe rocks belong to^ attempt to

purpofei they ufe clubs or long fti^, heavy at one end, and with which 
they ftrike them on the head, a blow in any other part being ineffc^ual. 
Thefe rocks have once been very valuable ; bat for fome years back, their 
inhabitants have, for the moft pnt, deferted them, and betaken diemfelves* 
to other habiutions, where they probably meet with milder treatment. 
This pariih once abounded with deer ; but on atccoont of the increafe 
of population, the ground that afforded them the beft pafture formerly, is 
now partly cultivated, and partly coveM with cows and flieep. There is 
a variety of wild fowl, which may afford recreation to the fportfman, fuck

of fuch extent, and where^the people are not rich enough 
to fend their children to ichool at a diftance from their own

CbaraBer ^ the Ptefle^-^Thc common people of this 
pariih are fober and induflrious, fagadous'and acute, in 
4ifcovering their own interefi, when placed within the 
Iphere of their obfervation, and perfevering in the pur- 
fttit of it. Though living on a poor fimpk diet, they 
aaay be ufefully employed in matters that require patience 
and &amp;tigue, Nvhen their exerdons are intperly dire6ted. 
They are fuU of curiofity, which makes them inquifitive, 
to a degree bordering on impertinence, and rather offenfive 
to firangers. They are infinuadng and artful in their ad« 
dreis, obliging and peaceable in their difpofitions, except- 
ing when their interefis interfere ; and in that cs^e, if any 
difierence or quarrels fublift among them, they plead their 
own caufe before the baron-b»Uiie, who is the only magi- 
firate in the pariih, with furprifing eloquence and addre£i ; 
and reft quite fatisfied with his dedfion, without ever ap. 
pealing to any higher tribunal. They are honeft for the 
moft part ; but among the poorer fort of them, petty pil« 
fcring, and even ifaeep-fiealing, is too common, for v^ch 
there is no adequate puniihment, for want of a proper

Methods of meliorating the CMtikion of the Peopk. — Lon[^ 
leafed are certainly the btft means that can be put in the peo* 
pies' power to better their condition. It is not to be fuppofed, 
that without this encouragement, they will difcover any 
Qew exertion in induftry, or be at the expenfe of introdu* 
ciog any new implements of hufbandry, or give them* 
(elves the trouble of making any improvements that will 
turn out to no advantage to them before the expiration of 
their leafes, which were only 9 years at tfateir commence** 
ment. It will be fiud, in anfwer tq tfats^ that though 
there were tp years leafes granted in the year 1769, there 
has not been much done to improve the coimtry. But to 
obviate tliis objediop, it may be obfervedv tlhat iudi as 
were in the vigour of life at that time did a good deal in 
that way, that the mod to whom thefe leafea were grant* 
ed were people on the decline of life, attached to the old 
method of farming, and ignorant of any other. But the 
cafe diftrs widely no^r ; The gentlemen who poAe&amp; the 
principal farms in the parifli now are aQ young aftd ac- 
tive, and difcover a fpirit for improvements. They have 
likewife, by their intercourfe wiA the low country, ac- 
quired a knowledge of the methods of cultivating the grouo4 
there, which they are inclined to introduce in tbiscoaniry 
upon proper encouragement.

A melioration to a certun extent for building good hoofiss^ 
would alfo contribute much to the improvement of this 
country. There h not a ilated houle in the parifh, but the 
churchi one mill, a houfe at Lochmaddie, that was intend* 
ed for a public houfe, and another in the Ifland of Vallay, 
in a ruinous conditileih But if the ab^vo encouragement 
was granted, the principal tackfinen would foon have flated 
hoiofes ; the great quantities of ftraw now ufed for thatch 
to their houfes, would then become provender for cattle ; 
and the time employed by their fervants in making 
heath ropes to fecure the thatch, would then be laid out in 
improvements of different kinds. The fmall tenants have 
|iot much time bdeed to improve their lands on account of 
the round of employment already mentioned. But if any 
method could be fidlen upon, that would enable them to 
le^en their number of horfes, nothing could turn out more 
to their advantage ; ufing carts in place of creels, would 
help much to bring about this defirable end. If the pro- 
prietor fliould fend a quantity of feafoned wood, and fome 
cart-wrights to the country, fo as to have carts made, a- 
dapted to the finall file of dieir horfes, which might be 
fold at prime coft, a great reduftxon of the number of 
hor&amp;s might be the confequence. In that cafe, a part of 
the com now given as provender for horfes might be 
faved; a part of the money fent out of the parifli to 
purchafe them, might be otherwlfe employed, and the peo- 
ple enabled to keep a greater number of black cattle. 
It is almoft unneceffary to obferve, that eftabliihing ma« 
nufaAures, and erefting villages, would help much to 
better the eondicion of the people, as then the tenant 
would be furiiidied with a market at band for many arti* 
^les that now turn to no account.

better calculated for a fheep-walk, than for rearing black 
cattle, but lie at too great a diilance from market. 

Agriculture^ Soil^ ifc, — Agriculture has been almoft in- 
variably the fame here (as in moft of the weftcrn ifles) for 
time immemorial, till within thefe lad 5 years, when Mr 
Macneily the proprietor, returned from viliting foreign 
countries, has begun to introduce the method ufed in the 
low country, as far as he thinks the foil and climate can 
admit of. The foil in general is thin and rocky, (except- 
ing the north end, which is a mixed foil, and almoft free of 
rock) ; there is alfo a great deal of fand, which is blown one 
way or other with every gale of wind, fo that a great part 
of the beft corn land has been thus blown away, or covered 
with fand. There is fome meadow grouad between the hills. 
The ground here requires that the manure be thick laid, 
in order to procure a tolerable crop ; thtre are lome mea- 
dows that yield three fucceflive crops with one coat of ma- 
nure, vrx, one of potatoes, and two of oats. The people 
here ufe the plough for the moft part ; but in their rocky 
ground they dig or turn up the ground with a kind of 
lever, wliich they call the crooked ipade, and which Dr 
Johnfton has deicribed in his tour through the Hebrides. 
They lay their potatoes for the moft part in lazy beds, in the 
following manner : — (ft, Tht-y nurk out a ridge of about 
four feet wide, then lay on the manure, and with a fpade 
cover it with earth taken out of the furrow ; in this Itate 
it remains till the beginning of April, when they begm to 
plant the potatoes by means of a dibble, or pointed itick, 
with which they penetrate the earth thus laid on, (making 
a hole to receive the feed), then break the earth with a 

V01..XIIL Tt hand-rake. 



33^ Statijlical Account 

hand-rake, which ferves the purpofe of harrowing ; this is i( 
more tedious operation than laying the plant upon the ma^ 
nure before it is covered with earth, but is the only method 
that can be ufed on thefe meadows, which are deep and 
wet, and the feafon mufl be very bad when they do not 
make good returns. They have of late begun to plant po- 
tatoes in light fandy foil, which anfwers very well ; and 
Mr Macneil, the proprietor, plants almoft all his with the 
plough, which gives ample fatisfadion, and every one be- 
gins to follow the example. The principal crop here is 
barley and potatoes ; there is fome fmall black oats, and 
little rye. The returns in barley are from lo to 15 ; in 
potatoes from 15 to 20. Sea-weed is the principal manure 
here ; as that is fometimes precarious, the crop muft be fo 
alfo, for when a fuflicient quantity of fea-weed is not caft 
ijpon the fhore, a plentiful harvcft is not to be cxpeded. 
Formerly the fea-weed that grows upon the fliorc was 
ufed for manure ; but iince kelp has become fo valuable« 
the proprietors every where have reftrified the people from 
cutting it for that purpofe, which is certainly prejudicial to 
agriculture. Tlie .people alfo make fome compoft. In 
good feafons they raife as much crop as will be fuflicient 
for their fubfiftence, otherwife there is a fcarcity ; but the 
proprietor fupplies the country with low-country ipevA at 
the mat ket price. It is to be hoped, that a fcarcity may 
not happen fo frequently henceforth, if the people in gene- 
ral could adopt the improvements lately introduced, in 
railing crops and rearing cattle. The cattle here are gene- 
rally finall. Mr Macneil, who has an extend ve farm in 
his own hands, having bought from the bed folds in dif- 
ferent parts of the Highlands, can now produce a fold of 
his own rearing equal to any of them; The lands here, as 
in many other places in the Highlands, are diflinguiflied 
into fingle and double lands, and the divifion of them is into 

pennies 



of Bar ray. 33 1 

pennies, halfpennies, and farthings. No tenant here pof- 
feffes more than halfpenny, for which he pays from L. 3 
to L. 4 for fingle lands, and L. 6 for the halfpenny of ^ 
double lands. The foaming of the halfpenny, that is, the 
number of full grown cattle, is 8, young ftock arid flieep in- 
cluded ; ^ three -year old queys, or 3 two-year olds, are 
equaita^ foum, and 8 iheep. So that the ftock of the pof- 
felTor of a halfpenny o£ fingle lands, confifls of 3 horfes, 4 
cows, and 8 or 10 iheep. The tenants pay their rents by 
manufa&amp;uring kelp and fale of their cattle. The proprie- 
tor employs a number of them in making kelp upon his 
fkrm, for which he pays from L. i, 10 s. to L. 2, 2 s. and 
for the kelp made upon their own ihores, which he alfo 
has at his own difpofal, L. 2 : 12 : 6 the ton, which is the 
higheft manufaAuring price given in the Highlands, fo far 
as I know. So that, from the fale of their cattle, and 
making of kelp, the people live very eafy, excepting in 
bad years, when there is a fcarcity of bread, they are un- 
der the neceflity of buying low-country meal. There arc 
5 farms which were let for 19 years at ftipulated rents ; 
the leafes are nearly expired *, 

/ Population. 

* The diitance of this place from market, and its infular fituation, has 
prevented the pric^ of cattle from advancing in the fame proportion as it 
has done in places more acceflible, and more conveniently fltuated. 
Notwitliftandiog this difadvanUge, the price has advanced to a third 
more at leaft ivithio thefc i8 years ; for a cow that fold then at L. i, lOs. 
would fell now at L. 2, 5 s. or L.i, 10 s. ; and parcels that fold then at 
L, 2. fell now at i:. 3 ; milch«cows fell at from L. 3, 10 s. to L. 4 ; whereas, 
mt the period above mentioned, they fold for L. 1, and L. 2, 10 s. accord- 
ing to their (Quality. They are bought by drovers who come hither from 
diferent places at ftated times. The ezpenfe in carrying them from this 
to the neareft part of the continent, which lies at the diftanceof 20 leagues, 
is a s. 6 d. the head, befides the buyer's ezpenfe and trouble in coming 
lor them, and the rUk of lofiog fome by the way, as tbcy fometimes mi]^

Population.'^Accorditkg to Dr Webller's report^ the 
number of fouls in 1755 was 1150. There has been no 
exa&amp; lift taken of the number of inhabitants here fince it 
was erefted into a parifli \ at leaft I could find none. But 
it is evident that population muft have increa/ed confider- 
ably within thefe lall 20 years, from this circumftance, 
that then there were fome lands unoccupied, and many of 
the tenants pofleffed a whole penny ; whereas, lately, the 
proprietor was obliged to divide the lands into fmaller 
portions, in order to accommodate the inhabitants. At this 
time, no tenant occupies more than 4 penny, and manj 
have but i and *** of a penny. In the laft cafe, it is to be 
obferved, the land is what is called double ; at prefent» the 
number of fouls in this parifh is 760 males, and 864 fe- 
males, in all 1604, of which only 80 are Proteflants. Be. 
fides thb number, upwards of 2:0 left this country within 
the lad 2 ybars ; fome emigrated to the iiland of St John's, 
and Nova Scotia, in North America, being inveigled thither 
by a Mr F»»* upon promifes of the undifturbed profeiBon 
of their religion, (being all Roman Cathdlics), and of free 
property for themfelves, and their offspring for*ever ; but 
how foon they were landed, he left them to their ihifts, 
and returned back to his native country *.

ihip was feizcd upon the cpafl by Roderick Macniel, then 
Laird of Barraj, furnamed Ruarj 'n* tarter, or Rory the 
turbulent, probably fo called, from the frequent depreda- 
tions he committed in different places, which were not un-

the Court of Scotland of this aft of piracy committed up- 
on her fubjefts ; upon which, the Laird pf Barray wa* 
fummoned to appear at Edinburgh, to anfwer for his un- 
juftifiable behaviour ; but he either refufed or defpifed the 
fummons* Several attempts were made afterward to ap- 
prehend him, which proved unfuccefsful. Mr Mackenzie, 
commonly called the tutor of Kintail, predeceiTor to the late 
Lord Macleo^, undertook to effeft by (Iratagem, what o- 
thers could not do by more direft means. Having come, 
under cover of a friendly vifit, to the Caftle of Kifimul, 
where the Laird then refided, he invited him and all his 
retainers on board, who not fufpefting any hoflile defign, 
fuHered themfelves to be overpowered with exceis of li-

The Danilh duns are 11 in number, 5 on the ifl^d of 
Barray, 2 in Waterfay, 1 in Sanderay, i in Perbay, i in 
Mengalay, and i in Berneray, the laft of which is taken 
notice of by the learned Dr Macpherfon of Slate, in his

pardonable injury done by the Queen of England to his own Sovereign^

don, but forfeited his eftatc, which was given to Rintail, who reftored 
it back to the Laird of Barray, on condition of holding of him, and pay.

James Macdonald of Slate, great-great-grandfather of the prelent Lord 
Macdonald, married a daughter of Kintail's, who made over the fuperi-

extend from the mouth of Loch Boifdale to Barrayhead ; 
from 70 to 30 boats are generally employed in this bufi- 
nels from the latter end of March, or the beginning of * 
April, to the end of June, and five hands in every boat j 
at an average they kill from 1000 to 1500 ling to each 
boat. Mr Macneil of Waterfay, who took an ezad account 
pf the number of ling fent to Glafgow in the year 1787, 
found it to amount to 30,000, befides a great number fold

* At one time, the Dani(h governor made alliance with Macneil of 
Barray, by marrying his daughter. But after the battle of Largs, the 
power of the Danes began every where to decline ; and fuch of them as 
remained here after the Ebudfe. were rellored to the King of Scotland, 
were expelled or maflacred by the natives. In one of the adjacent iflands, 
there is a coUe^ion of human bones, where it is faid the laft of the Danes * 
were murdered. In Kilbar are two churches, built by the monks, be- 
longing to Icolumkill; another at Borne, dedicated to St Michael. 
In Caftle-bay, it a fort, built upon a rock, which muft have formerly been 
alrooft covered with ihe ff a. This fort is of a hexagonal form ; the wall 
is near 30 feet high ; in one of its angles is a high fquare tower, on the 
top of which, at the comer immediately above the gate, is a perforated 
ilonc, through which the gockroan or watchman, who fat there all night, 
let a ftone fail upon any per Ion who attempted to furprife the gate by 
night. Within the wall are feveral houfes, and a well dug through the 
middle of the rock. The tradition here is, that this fort was built up. 
wards of 500 years ago. Buchanan cklls it an old caflle in bis time. 
It has always been the refidence of the Lairds of Barry, till the begtnniof

ifles are all Roihan Catholics ; the prieft goes there only 
twice a-year, unlels by a particular call to vific the fick, 
and to adminifler extreme unftion. What renders this 
pariih fingularly troublefome, is its diftance from the feats 
of Prefljytery and Synod ; the firft.is in North Uift, at the 
diftance of 40 miles, beiides a ferry of 8 miles, where he 
attends two ftated Prefbyteries in the year, the one in the 
beginning of December, and the other the middle of 
March ; befides occaiional meeting?, and attendance upoti 
facraments in North Uift and Harris, the laft of which is 
at the diftance of near 60 miles, beiides the ferry already 
snentiotted, and that between North Uift and Harris, 12 
siiles in length ; thisdiftance the minifter is fometimes undet 
the neeeflity qf walking on foot^ though at other timeSy 
when horfes are in good order, he is obliged to the gene* 
rofity of the principal gentlemen on the way for the iife of 
their horfes, which he takes this occafion to acknowledge. 
The feat of the Synod, which is Glenelg, on the continent 
of Scotland, is at the diftance of 30 leagues by fca, when he

Servants^ Wages^ iic. — ^Thc number of fervants depends 
upon the extent of land a man pofiefles ; a farm of any 
confiderable extent, according to the prefent mode of farm- 
ing, employs 5 or 6 men, 4 or 5 maid fervants, and a or 
3 bojs ; the wages of a labouring man fervai»t, for th« 
whole year, are from L» i« ids. to L. 2. ; the bojs have 
from 15 s. to L. i, 5 s. ;- women from 15 s. to L. 1. BeGdes 
the above wages, the men and bojs get a feventh part of 
the crop to divide among them, the grieve has double wa- 
ges. Giving them a ihare of the crop, makes them more 
induftrious, and binds them fafter to the matter's intereft» 
as it is for the time infeparably conneded with their own. 
Such a number of fervants muft be verj burdenfome to a 
farmeri and muft run away with a great ihare of the pro« 
duce of hb farm ; but the difficulty of winning their peats, 
which is the only fuel ufed here, renders it neceflary to 
keep fo many fervants, and double the number of horfes 
that would be fufficient for their ploughing -, for a farmer 
that muft keep fuch a number of fervants, muft alfo keep 
X 6 or 18 horfes, both which are almoft wholly employed 
drying and carrying home their peats, from the beginning- 
of June, when the fowing b at an end, till the latter end 
of Auguft, when the reaping comes on. If the Legifla- 
ture thought proper to take the duty off coal, it might, in 



Of Barraj. 34I 

a great mearate, alleviate this grievance; and if the hx^ 
Tiiefs could nfe coal, inftead of peats, tfiej might employ 
their fervants for verj ufefid purpofes, fuch as, making 
Kelpv buflding walls, making indofures, compofis, ^c. iSc.

guage commonlj fpoken here, and I believe the pureft 
diftleA of it to be met mth in any country; though by 
their frequent ezcnrfions to Gfatlgow, the people have in« 
troduced a number of Engliih words. Numbers of the in- 
habitants, who attended the fchool, fpe^k Engliih tolerably 
inrell.— There are 200 tons kelp fent annually to the mar- 
kets of Liverpool and Leith, and fetch the beft price 
that is given for any that is fent from any part of the 
Hi^Iands ; fifli and oil are fent to Glafgow ;' price as for- 
merly mentioned. There are alfo from 200 to 250 head

The number of horfes here is 557 ; cows, 11 70, the num- 
ber of foums in iheep, 277, which, at the rate of 8 Iheep to 
the foum, is 2216. — ^The weather is rather inconftant. The 
W. and S. W. winds blow moft frequently here, and prove 
very deftruAive to corn. This lafl winter was very wet 
and flormy, much the fame with that of 1790, both which 
have been the mofl diftreiEng to the people here, in the 
memory of any man living. We have had very little 
fnow this winter or fpring, and none at all the two pre- 
ceding. The fea feems to have made fome encroachmenta 
here. The tradition here is, that 3 or 4 generations back, 
(he cattle ufed to feed in places, where kelp is made at this 
day i but now it can hardly go any farther, as the (hore

to be obfetred, that notwithftanding the great quantities 
of filh killed upon this coaft, the proprietor never claimed 
any emoluments from that lucrative bufinefe, but allowed 
the people to make the beft of it for themfelves ; and he 
alii^ays gives premiums to the firft people that diicover

IN old records, refpe£Hng this parifhy dated about 60 
years ago, it is fpelled Anwotb^ fometimes Anweth^ 
and at other times jlnwortb^ but the name Anwoth is at 
prefent retained, and its origin, we believe, cannot now be 
sdcertained. The parilh is about 6^ miles long, from N. £• 
to S. W. and 34 broad. The fea-fliore, which bounds 
the parifli for about %\ miles from the mouth of the river 
Fleet, to the confines of Kirkmabreck, is generallj flat and 
^ockj, though in one place it is bold and elevated. It 
contains no harbours. The land which lies upon the fea^- 
(hore, and near the mouth of the river, is in general flat ; 
tl^e foil is dry and fertile, lying for the mbft part on a bed 
of fand or gravel. This part produces excellent crops of 
gr;un and grais \ but the foil bebg thin, it is much injured

by dry fieafons. Farther np the river, towards the north, 
the furface becomes more uneven, broken, and barren, 
and hills, which are not very elevated, every where aip* 
pear. The leffer part here is arable, excepting a finall 
ftrip on the banks of the river. On the borders of Kirk- 
mabreck, the country becomes rather mountkinous ; the 
hills are covered with heath, intermixed with grais, and 
principally appropriated to feeding flieep. As foon as the 
traveller turns his pye towards that part of the pariQi, 
which lies along the river, and on the fea-ihore, a beauti- 
ful profped opens to his view. This fpot, liatare has em- 
belliihed with fome of her fined ornaments, to which have 
been added fome of the improvements of art. There is a 
great variety of profpeds. For about 6 miles along the 
banks of the river, and at fome diftance from it, there is a 
confiderable quantity of natural and planted wood, which 
being intermixed with gentlemen's feats and cultivated 
£elds, having the river on one fide, and the hUls on the 
other, rifing at proper diftasces, forrn^ one of the moft 
beautiful profpeds that is to be found in this part of Gal- 
loway. Thefe woods grow on the eflates of Mefirs Max- 
well of Cardonefs, MaccuUoch of Ardwell, Murray of 
Broughtion, Hannay of Rufco. They confill moftly of oak, 
alh» birch, and fir, and it is believed, that if fold at 20 
yeara growth, they would give L. 7000 Sterling. 

ClimaU.-r^Tht climate here, like that of all diftrias 
Inhere the elevation of the land, in one place, difiers- fo 
much from that of another, varies, in different parts of the 
parifli. It is often (harp and cold on the hills, while it is 
warm and comfortable on the ihore, and in the vallies. In 
winter and fpring, the tops of the hills are fometimes co 
vered with fnow, when,, about a mile or two diflant, on the

pfariih about 7 miles ; one branch of Trhich iifues from a 
fmd lo^'of'' the fame name, in the parifli of Girthon ; 
the other branch has its fource in the parifli of Kirkma- 
breck, near the bafe of a very high hitt, called Cairnfmuir. 
It is navigable for fmall veflels- of about 50 tons as far as the 
viQige of Gatehoufe, which is fituated about 3 miles from 
t^e moiithof the river. Fifli are not plenty in this river; 
a few falmon, fea troitt, yellow trout; and flounders, are 
caught in it/ The falmon and fea trout are taken with 
draught nets, but the quantity h fo fmall, that it will fcarce 
defray the expenfe of hbour, and is not a tenth ^wX. of 
what it was 50 year5 wgo. They are caught from May to 
the middle of Augufl. and fold in Gatehoufe and the neigh- 
bonrhood at about 3d. the pound. 

Hills. ^^The moft remarkable hill in this parifti is Cairn. 
harrah, which is fituated partly in this parifb, and partly in 
Kirkmabreck. It is elevated above the fea about x too

bitants. In every pariih in which no town is iituated, and 
where fiew people of fottune refide, the inhabitants moil be

oUerver that they ate in general fober and induftrioos, 
and, with fevend ezeeptions, enjoy in a moderate degree 
the comfiMts and conveniencies of life. 

!^jiamiiif of Acrts^ Rattf C/f.-— There is no map of die 
whole pariih. The quantity of acres amounts to about 
8600, nearly 1900 of which is arable. The valued rent of 
the pariih is L* 2871 Scots ) the real rent is about L. aaoo 
Sterling. Some fiurms are rented fo low as L. 10 a-year ; 
others fo hij^ as L. aoc 1 it is believed the average is 
aboot L. 6o. Beil araUe land is in general let at 15 s. the 
acre; but fome contiguous to the village is taken in fmall 
^piaatities at double that price. The improvement of land 
in this pariih and the neighbourhood has been very rapid 
widiin thele few years. Fortnerly there were but few en- 
dofures, and the ground was in its natural itate ; confe- 
qoendy, when tilled, it yielded but fmall returns to the 
farmer, fometimes two, fomedmes threefold. Now the 
land is generally endoled, and before it is broken up, it is 
improved with ihells, marl, or lime. There is fome marl 
in the pariih, and the ihells on the iea-ibore fetm to be in* 
exhanfiibie. Lime is brought from Cumberland, and fold 
at 1 8. the Carlifle bnihel, 50 of which are commonly laid 
on an acre. For the moft part 3, fomedmes 4 crops of

Animal and Vegetable ProduBianst^^A. n^iich greater 
qnantity both of grain and cattle is produced ib the parifli 
than is neceffarj for the fuftenance of its inhabitants. Abont 
650 acres are employed in railing oats, 70 in barley, and a 
few acres in potatoes, about i at an average to each farm. 
The foil is not confidered to be well adapted to the produc* 
tion of wheat, though in fome'fpots good crops of it have 
been raifed. Little attention is paid to the cultivation of 
hemp and lint, Oats is the principal crop. The grain 
not confumed in the parifh is partlj fold in the neighbour- 
hood, and partly (hipped for Whitehaven, Liverpool, and 
the Clyde. There are about ti6o black cattle, 140 
horfes, and 40C0 (heep in the parifli. A few catde are 
fatted for home confomption, or fold to butchers, who 
{laughter them in the neighbouring towns and villages \ 
but the greater part are fold when three years old to dro- 
vers, who take them to the Engliih market. They are of 
a middle iize, fatten well, and weigh far beyond their ap- 
parent bulk. The fheep which pafiure on the mooriih part 
of the parifh are of a middle fize ; their face and legs are 
black, the body white. They fell at about L. 7 a fcore, of 
21 to the fcore, before they are fatted ; their wool is rather 
coarfe, and is fold about 9 s. the done, of 38 pounds. 
There is another- kind commonly called muggs ; they are

the Tower of Rufco, and Caftle of Cardoneb. The for-

had no roof in the memory of the oldeft perfon living. 
Both are nearly of a fquare form, and like many of the old 
buildings feem to have been dcfigned for ftrength and mag. 
nificence rather than convenience. They have no charaAeia 
on them by which dieir age can be afcertained ; nor can 
we find any records in which it is mentioned. Both thefe 
ftand on the banks of the Fleet ; the Tower about 2\ 
miles above where the river ceafes to be navigable, and 
the Caftle a mile below where it becomes navigable. This

BY fodie perfotis who underftand the Gaelic, it is fkid 
that Garvald b compounded of two words iii that 
khguagCi vi%. Gar, rough or rugged, and Vald, a fmall 
watet 6r bum. This etymology is exafUy defcriptive of

Annexation, at Garvald and Baro,^rr alUrnatat vices f till about the jear 
1 743 or 1 744, when the kirk of Baro fell into dlfrepair. It is now a 
complete ruin. In old papers/ the name of this place is always #rittea

npon a fmall water or barn, the bed or run of which thread j 
abounds in .ones of Various fizes, as there are a great many 
freeftone quarries along ita banks. When this water is 
flooded, fuch b the immenfe force and rapidity of the 
ftream, that it fweeps along, and throws out upon the low 
grounds,* ftones of a great weight and fixe. In Qdaber 
1775 this water was prodigioufly flooded, overflowed all its 
banks* and had it not cut out a new run for itfelf, the whok 
village would have been infallibly fwept away by thb 
fudden inundation. The depth of the water in fooie 
houfes of the village was upwards of 3 feet. The united 
parifbes of Garvald and Baro extend from £. to W. about 
8 or 9 miles, and from N. to S. about 4 or 5. Their fi- 
gure is irregular, being interfeded by feveral of the adja^ 
cent pariflies. The air is extremely pure and healthful* 
Having at all times a free and full circulation, its lalubrity 
is feldom injured by noxious vapours. The inhabitants are 
of a robuft and healthy coilflltutibn, and generally enjoy 
the bleflings of life to a remote old age. There died lately 
in tbis pariih a man upwards of 90, and there are living in 
it juft now ar nmnber of perfons on the bohlei's of 80, who 
fupport the fatigues of their refpeftive employments with 
a confideraUe degree of ftrength and aftivity. No epide- 
mical diflempers are peculiar to the inhabitants; colds, 
fevers, of different kinds, and the fmallpox, fometimes 
prevail here •. The grounds that lie in the S. and N. of 
thefe p»riihes, exhibit fo different an appearance, that they 
are a ftriking contrail to each other. The grounds that lie

ID the S. are mofilj cpvered with heathy of a thin gravelly 
foil, others are of a deep mo&amp;, abounding with fwamps 
and mlrfhes.. The whole range of the L^oimeroiqor Hills, 
which in thefe pariihes extend from £. to W. about 8 or 
9 toxXeSj are for the mofi part covered with heath, inter- 
fperfed with large plots of grafs. The grounds that lie in the 
N. are of a deep, rj^h clay (oil, and produce excellent cro^s 
of wheat, barley, oats, Uc. Thefe towards the E. are of 
a fine light gravelly foil, excellently adapted for the culture 
of turnips and potatoes both of which are here rai&amp;d to a 
great extent* A great part of the foil in thelie pariihes is 
either of this deficription, or of a deep rich .day. 

^gricukure^ W^.— Agriculture is the prevailing occupa- 
tion in thefe j)ariihes, as the farmers who rent the Lam- 
mermoor Hills rent at the iame time the adjacent low 
grounds to a con£derable extent. The lands which lie on 
the N. of thefe hills are moflly encloled, and their agricul- 
ture in a (late of very high improvement. Lime brought 
from the didance of 4 or j miles is extenfively ufed, aad 
l^roves an excellent flimulus. Turnips, as they are always 
raifed with dung, and frequently cleaued, have a furpriling 
efie6l in meliorating and enriching the foil. Fallow is an- 
other fpecies of improvement pra&amp;i&amp;d with great fuccefs, 
and to a confiderable extent. But the greateft improve- 
pient in agriculture is that of fowing the land with grals- 
feeds, and turning it into pafture for a few years. This 
^cies of in^provement is found to be the bed reftorative 
where manure cannot be procured. Excellent crops of all 
kinds of grain are raifed, but the moft prevailing are thofe 
of oats and barley ; wheat and peafe to a leis extent. As 
a great part of the foil of thefe pariihes is of a fine light 
gravelly foil, excellently adapted for the culture of turnips 
fl^ potatoes, both of them are raifed to a confiderable extent. 

On 



i Siaii/Kcal Accwnt 

Oi\ two farms adjacent to this village, for fcveral yesn 
paft, from 80 to 90 acres of turnip have Been ndfed ; and 
on fcveral other farms to the weflward, from 20 to 30 acres. 
A few (heep, and a great nuoiher of black tattle, were fed 
with thefe turnips, and fold to the butcher. Potatoes like* 
wife are raifed to a confiderable extent ; for, befidca what 
the tenants and their cottagers raifc for the ufe of their 
families, a number of people iff the village and neighbour- 
hood rent land from the tenants, and plant it with potatoes, 
at the rate of L. 4 or L. j the acre. They efteem this root 
both an agreeable and wholefome food, and it is one of the 
principal articlts on which they fubfifl for a con{iderabI« 
part of the feafon. The plouj;hing with two horfes with* 
out a driver is a method which is univerfally adopted in 
this country. Some affirm, that a plough with two horfes 
will perform as much work in a day, as one with four 
which was formerly ufcd. Others are of a different opi- 
nion. There are in the pariih about 20 tenants, remark- 
able for their induAry, application, and knowledge in agri- 
culture. Indeed, a fet of more inteUigent and refpcftable 
tenants are fcarcely to be found any where. One of thefe 
lately wrote an eflay upon the beft method of raifing a green 
crop, for which he was adjudged a gold medal, value L. 5, 
5 s. by the Truftees for the Improvement of Filheries and 
Mar.ufi^ures, ir'r. He hath fince written another effay 
upon the fame fubjed^, for which he was alfo adjudged a 
gold medal of the fame value. But it is now faid, diat in 
lieu of thefe medals, the Truftees intend to compliment 
him with a piece of plate. There are about 46 or 47 
ploughgates in the parifh, and each ploughgate is aflefled 
in L. I Sterling, fo* making and repairing the ro«ds. The 
heritors meet every year, according to a6i of Parliament, 
fbr the allocation of this aficlTment, and are extremely at- 
tentive to tliis impoi cant branch of police. On this ac-

tice which here univerfally prevails. Store farmers are 
of opinion, that ^thjs operation matly contributes tQ ^re- 
fcrve the animal from vermin, to render it more ^healtbj, 
to improve, and even increafe the quantity of wool. Thq

Villages. — ^There are a villages in thefe parifhest Gar- 
vald and Bare. The village of Garvald contains 114 in- 
habitants. Within thefe 14 or 15 years upwards of 30 
new houfes have been built in this village \ but prior to 
this period, and even fince, almofi an equal number of old 
ones have been pulled down. All the new houfes (except 
a or 3) are feus at the rate of L. 3 the acre, built by mn^^ 
fonsy Wrights, weaven, s'€. In the vicinity of the village 
there is a great number of freeftone quarries, of an ex- 
cellent quality, fome of which are only at the diftance of 
200 yards. The grounds in this neighbourhood are almoft 
all enclofed with fiones from thefe quarries. There are 4 
public houfes in the village \ befides thefe, there is an inn 
or public houfe at Danikine, on the great road from Had- 
dington to Dunfe, where travellers receive proper accom- 
modation. Thefe, however, have had no bad efieft on the 
morab of the people. Drinking to ezcefr is lefs prevalent 
here than it was ao years ago. The inhabitants of tbele 
pariihes, with a very few exceptions, are fober, virtuous, 
induftrious, and remarkably s^ttentive to their di&amp;rent em« 
ployments. The village of Baro is fjoaallf thinly inhabited, 

and

and does not contain half the number of people whidi are

Nanraw and Hopes. The houfe of Nunraw fome centu* 
ries ago was a nonoerj beloa^g to the priory of Had^ 
dington, and tbongh modernized, ftill exhioits evident 
marks of great antiquity. The houfe of Hopes is plea£uit- 
Ij fitoafeedy very near the bottom of a glen, and to the 
weftward of one of the Lammermoor HiUs« on which there 
IS an eztenfive and flourifhing plantation of various forts of 
trees. This, and feveral others upon the eftatCi were raifed 
by the late Charles Hay of Hopes, £fq; a moft polite and 
worthy gentleman* Adjacent to this plea&amp;nt and roman- 
tick villa, there is a large garden, well flocked with a va- 
riety of fruiC trees, through which a rivulet gently glides, 
and plentifaUy fupplies it with water.

meritOf which was ratified by the Queen of Hungary. 
In 1744, he went AmbaiTador to the Court of Raflia, 
where he continued till the end of 1749, and was 
very inftrumental in accelerating the peace of Aix la 
Chapelle. On his return to Britain* he was appointed 
tmt of the Lords of the Bed-chamber, and of the fttvj 
Council. While he thus ferved his country in a public 
capacity, he was highly ufeful to the place of his nativity, 
by employing, for many years, a great number of work- 
men in the buildings, and extenfive plantations, carried on 
at Carmichael, and at Weflraw, in the neighbouring pariih 
of Pettinain. Upon thefe, the whole rent of the eflate, 
and fometimes more was expended* There are at Carmi* 
chael laoo acres enclofed and fubdivided by him. The 
enclofingand planting was begun about the year 1738, and 
^oftly completed in the 176a. The (tone and earchen 
fences at Carmichael alone, are faid to meafore 35 miles. 
The enclofures are of difierents iizes, containing from 20 
to 30 acres, and upwards, furroonded by belts of plantation 
of various breadths, from 40 to above xoo feet. The 
quantity of ground oeoupied by the plantations has not 
been afcertained, but the weedings here, and at Weflraw, 
yield near L. 200 annually. The prefent Earl is adding 
to the plantations, having planted ibis lafl feafbn about 
ic,coo trees. In the plantations here, is % great variety 
of pines. The larix grows fait in every foil, at die finne 
time yielding a clofe |ored tough wood. There was a la- 
rix tree cut here, when 24 years old, the root cut 9f which 
8 feet long, was fqnared into planks of tile tpean bivadth of 
X7 inches. The Scotch fir thrives well in dry ground, as 
does the filver fir in feveral fbib, where it rifcs to a great 
height, making a beautiful and itiiking appearance. The

Weymouth, or New England pine, fecms much more de- 
licate, and does not attain to an j great fize. The fpruce 
fir, when yonng, grows fSail, from its conical figure, makes 
an excellent aorfe to hard wooj trees, but appears fhort 
lived, as here, even in the rooft favourable fituations, when 
about 40 years old, it begins to die at top, and quickly 
decays. In planting the lariz, which is now fo jufily va 
lued, there generally prevaib what appears an error. It 
is commonly planted out from a foot to x8 inches, or more 
in height, with feedling, Scotch, or fpruce firsasnurfes, grow- 
ing much fafter than either, its tender ihoots are always 
expofed to the violence of the ftorm, and much waved by 
the witid* It might perhaps fucceed as well to plant the 
nurfcs 3, 4, or even 5 years before, by which time, ha- 
ving attained feme (ize, they would be a better fhelter to 
the larix *, there feems no danger of this being fmothered 
by the odiers, as no tree gi'ows better in the ihade, and by 
coafieqoence it anfwers well for filling up wants in planta- 
tioes. The enolofures here are generally let from year to 
year in pafture, and in that way yield perhaps an higher 
re^t than they would do in tillage. There are in the pa« 
rifli a fbw endofures, and feme plantations belonging to 
Mr Carmichael of Eaftend. Lcrd Douglas has alfo enclo* 
fed a hiH, containing near 300 acres, to be planted next 
feafon, which, when grown, will be an ornament to the 
cottrttry, being feen in feveral dire£hons at a great di- 
ftance.

00 in the old mauner. The (fivifion into croft and outfield 
is generally rotaioed. Formerly the eroft was kept con-

their croft onder pafture, and cleaning other parts with ^€' 
tatoeSy and (bme with turnips. The general crops are oats, 
bear or bigg, and a few peas ; the latenels of oor faanreOs 
are unfavourable to the laft fpecies of grain. The leafotis 
of fowing are generally, for oats and peas, from the mid- 
dle of March till towards the end of April ; for bear, from 
the be^ning to the end of May \ for turnip, from the ik of 
. June to the end of the month. There are as yet but &amp;w 
ofthefcy-and little gra&amp; fown. They are however &amp;irly 
introduced; and as the fiumers begin to lee the advan- 
tage of them, they are likely to be more generaDy 
ibwn. The feafons of reaping are various* Bigg is gene- 
rally cut from the ift to the 20th of September, and oats 
from that to the beginning of November. The greatefi 
improvement that has been made in any branch of hut 
bandry in this pariih, is in the management of the dairy. 
Farms which 50 years ago made little hotter for iale, and 
not as much checfe as was fufficieot for the conlumption of 
the fiumer's family, now depend upon thofe articles for the 
payment of fome, the half, and others the greateft part of 
their rent. If the produce' of their cows and bear crop wiU 
not pay the rent, it is reckoned too high. The can£es 
which formerly retarded improvements in agriculture ia 
this pariih were its diftance from markets for its produce, 
bad roads, and the latenels of its climate and foil. The two 
firll of thefe are in a great meafure removed. The efia- 
blilhment of cotton-works at Lanark and Donglas has 
brought ready markets for butter, cheele, and grain, within 
a few miles, whereas formerly the principal market for the 
two firfi of thefe was Edinburgh, and for the laft Glafgow, 
the one above, the other near 30 miles diftant, and the

i^eat difcpuragementa to the etertions of the farmer. For

tjouance of rainy weather in harveft, his hopes are oft(n 
4ifappointfdy and he feldom knows what it is completely to 
iaye a fitlly ripened crop. The oats generally fown arc 
what .are here called the Tweeddale or Blaiaflie, and the 
moprlaqd Ayr feed. The laft is about a week or ten days 
earlier than the firft. Earlier kinds of oats have been tried, 
but they are fo apt to fliake if not cut before fully ripe, and 
on poor land yield fo little fodder, (a circumftance much 
attended to, where fo much depends upon rearing and keep- 
ing cattle), that in the prefent ftate of the grounds, they 
are not thought to be profitable. They might fuccecd bet- 
ter w^re the* fields more fheltered, and the foil made richer; 
a^ in ibme linall rich and fheltered fpots, they yield abun-

the diftrifti Only one fnicide has been heard of. They 
are much addided to drinking of whiiky ; whence, at their 
public meetings (fucb as buriak, &amp;c.) iquabbles are fre- 
quent ; their fondneis for fpirits is owing to tbe eafy acceis 
to it, there being no lels than 13 houfes in tbeparifb* where 
drams are fold without a county or excife licence, to the 
very great prejudice of the pur£e, conftitution, and morals 
of the natives. Such a nuifance to fociety is overlooked 
by the proper officer, on account of the trouble and diilance 
from the county town, the proprietors alfo refiding at a di-

MifctUaneous Oi/irvations. -^The inferior tenants arc 
▼erj poor, owing to their fmall holdings, and their habi- 
Utions wretched ; they pay from L. a to L. 6 rent, which 
may be from 5 8« to los. the acre arable, affording a fcaiity 
fabfiAence to a &amp;mily, which af!edd their morals, fo that 
their veracity or honeily b not always to be depended on* 
They have no idea of trade or mannfadures, and confe« 
quendy no defire to leave their native land ; they prefer 
living on the fmalleft pendicle of land as tenants to the beft 
fcrvice, and are extremely averfe to the military. They 
procure their little neceflaries from the market-towns, by 
the fale of fmall parcels of wood they bring thither (diftant 
40 miles). They are very ignorant of the principles of 
. religion, as but few of them can read. There is no Diifen- 
ter of any defcription in the parifli. There b but one place 
of worihip, and that in the extremity of the parifh. The 
incumbent frequently preaches in the kirk of Inch, as being 
nttre contiguous to the greater part of the pariihioners than 
the parilh-church. The climate is dry and healthy, and 
there is lels of ftorm than what is at a few miles diftance on 
, either hand, probably owing to its being equidiftant from the 
' £. and W. feas. The natives live to a good old age -, there 
are feverals at prefent beyond 80 years. The laft minifter 
died at 10 1, and preached till within fix months of his 
death. The principal difeafes are fevers, rheumatifms, and 
confumptions*' The prejudice againft inoculation is hap- 
pily removed, fo that very few die now of that naufeous 
diforder, the fmall-poz.

Papulation. 

« With reipcdi to tbe tgricalture of the parifli, it may be in general 
obfeffcd, that the quantity of grain produced, in good yean, is confider- 
ably moie than fufficient to fupport the inhabitants; but in cpid apd wet 
leaibns, oar oats and barley do not ripen properly, and are often very ill 
got. In harve^ 1781 and 1783, the fituation of the farmers, and in- 
habitants in general, was truly deplorable. It was the end of December 
before the harveft was finiflied, after the greateft part of the crop had 
been dellroyed by froft and fnow. Without a fupply from other ^Mat- 
ters, a real Csmine would have taken place ; oar ftmers were obliged to 
bay the whole of their fee^-corn for crop 1783, from the cad parts of 
the county, and from tbe Lothians. Some Dutch oats were alfo brought 
from Leith, at an exorbitant price. The red 9at$, io called, I prefume, 
from their colour, prevail very much in the parifli at preient. They are 
fotend to fuft the foil and climate, better than any early fpecies that has 
hitherto been tried. They ripep u loon as the Dutch and Polifli ; are 
more luxuriant on the ground ; and not fo apt to fall by the wind. The 
principal crops in this parifli are oats and rough bear ; peafe grow very 
readily on our light foil, but from the celdnefs of the climate, very fiel- 
dom attain complete maturity ; oati are fown aa early in March as die 
froft will allow ; bear from the middle of April to the end of May. The 
time of harveft is very uncertain ; it is very feldom general, however, be- 
fyrt the end of September.

fine trout; but the infamous praflices of taking them with nets, and de- 
ftroying them with lime, which have for fome years pail been very pre-

reAangular, but there is noDc of them in this part of the 
countrj. 

Adnamagts and Difadvantagii^^^Tht chief advantage of 

this fituation is a contiguity to the public road, which leads 

from Edinburgh to London. It i» kept in excellent repair 

bj the money colleded at the toUbars, and by the fiatute* 

labour commuted into money, according to the number of 

fervants and horfes kept by the farmers ; without this, 

improvement of every kind would have been impradicable. 

The diiadvantag^ of our fituation are, the coldneis of our 

climate, and confiequently our frequent cold and wet har- 

vefls. Were the pradice of enclofing land and planting 

more general, the climate would be confiderably improved. 

Clumps of fir and white wood, judicioufly difpofed on the 

heights, would ihelter our flocks from the (lorms of winter, 

and defend our habitations from the N* and N. W. winds, 

to which they are at'prefent much ezpofed. Our landed 

gentlemen are beginning to fee the advantages of enclofing 

and planting; about 500 acres are already encloled, and I 

doubt not but thb improvement will advance with confide* 

rable rapidity. This part of the county of Berwick, from 

the number of iheep which it fupports, and its vicinity to 

the public rood, fisems well calculated for the eftablifliment 

of an woollen manufa£hire ; and from the prefent flou- 

riihing (late of that which was eftabliflied many years ago 

at Gala£biels, the Noblemen and gentlemen of Lauderdale 

might promife themfelves the higheft advantages from a 

fiiQilar ere&amp;ioa in the neighbourhood of Lauder.

Ted, that there is a ^ot in the neighbous^ood of the churchy 
called Brakenhaugh *, and a farm named Rannachie, i. e, the 
Brakenfield. This parilh is fitoated in that diftriA of

there is generally a great variety of foil ; and this pariih 
-affords no exception to the general mle. In one comer the 
foil is a light loam, extremely rich, on a bottom of clay ; in 
another it is th n, but abundantly fertile, on a red mud. 
Some places are very iSmdy, and others clayey ; and, in 
general, with the exception of what is iandy, an amazing 
number of fmall roundifli fiones cover the ground. The 
furface is variegated with hills and eminences, ftreams of 
water, and fiertile plains. The Binhiil, in the S. £• end of 
the pariih, is moilly planted with trees. It is covered with 
heath, and of fo confiderable an altitude as to ferve as a land- 
mark to the fiihers, being perceived by them, according to 
their way of reckoning, at fall 15 leagues diftance. The hilla 
of Maud and Adie, alfo covered with heath to the top, are 
contiguous to it, but of leis elevation, and proceed in a 
we^rly dire&amp;ioB to the confines of the pariih. The 
greatcfi part of the pariih has a N. W. expofure, and fuf- 
£ers from the llorms which blow from that point ; but this 
inconvenience is greatly over-balanced by a fea-coaft, in-

Nethef Buckie, Mr Stuart of Tanachy, and Mr Stuart of 
OxhilL Only a of them, the proprietors of Letceficoiuie

gentlemen has laid out a part of his fortune in embellifk* 
ing his paternal property, and in building elegant hoofes on 
his different eftates ; and the latter direds his attention to 
the improvement of his eftatOi and the cultivation of his 
farm* 

Modi ofCuhivatkn.'^'Tht climate is early « and the foil 
in general good, and fufceptible of the higheft cultivation. 
Some of the heritors have availed themfelves of all the 
modem improvements in agriculture ; and of late the te- 
nants have begun to improve their fyftem of farming. In 
their feafons, one fees fields properly cleaned, ridges 
ftraighted, fmall ftones removed, and luxuriant crops of 
grain and of graft growing. By means of planting, noi- 
fances are converting into beauties, and the country is gra- 
. dually afluming a pleafanter appearance. In (hort, as a fpi« 
|:it of induftry and of imitation is becoming prevalent a- 
mong the tenants, with, a proper degree of encourageineiit, 
the face of the country would, in a ihort time, be mightily 
improved. Wheat, barley, oatSi and peafe are the grains

tsfiutUy culdvated. A fummer fallow is the ordliiaty pre* 
p^^nuion ibr w^eac ; and after the field is thorcmghtj^ clean* 
ed, and voeU manured wilih dung from the fiiher- towns, if it 
can be procured, the crop is laid down in Odober. Barley 
ia fowo withont manure, after oats from a ley-furrow, and 
with manure ofcer peafp or turnip. The turnip £eld is ^e« 
aevaUj .ploughed once, and the peafe twice, before laying 
op the^ung for the ieed-furrow. Oats are town on ley 
ploughed in Ecbruary, and frequently after barley. WhiO 
the oats after barley are reaped, the field gctsa ploughmg 
in autumn, and remains in that ftate till fpring, when it re- 
ceives the feed furrow, and is fown with peate. On the S. 
fide of the poft^oad, towards the hills, the acre fows irom 
from M to 14 pecks ; on Ae N. fide, towards the coaft; 
from v6 to 18 ; of gray peafe the fame quantity is allowed 5 
but of the late kind, which is feldom ufcd, as they do not 
ripen infeafon, andfo prove unprodudive, 13 or 14 fufBce. 
About a peck lefs of barley, than of the above kinds of 
grainj 13 allowed to the acre, and of wheat the ufual allow- 
ance is a boll. Of wheat the average produce is 10 returns 5 
barley 7 ; oats 4 ; and p6rfe 3. On many places peafe do 
not thrive ; and oats, on a field that has been manured with 
dung from the fifter-towns, generally fails, and on that ac- 
count they are feldom a lucrative crop, except after ley. 
As a common tenant does not often lay down his beflf 
ground with graft feeds, many excellent fields have been 
u&amp;der a regular courfe of cropping time immemorial. A 
fmallfpot of about \ of an acre, in Mr Baron Gordon's eflate, 
has produced barley -croj)s for 47 years, without any luj^ 
of fertility. It is fitu^ited pear the beach at Buckie; has 
been uniformly twice ploughed, and gotten fome loadb of 
fea-weed, or other manure annually. It fows i': pecks, 
and has produced from 4 to j bolls. Turnips and potato^ 
are cultivated for home-confumptioo  and flax is pretty

i\.boot the year I750» the firft (bop was" opened iir Bockie, 
at that time known as a fifhing. ftation only ; ^t prefent 
there are 8 merchants or ihof keepers in it who trade to 
the extent of L. 5000, ezcli^ve of graiat annually. Origi- 
nally unbred to bufinels, and poOefted of a fmaU ftock, 
they began their merchandife on a very narrow fcale; aa 
their ftock increafcd, they extended their views, and 
launched out into new branches^ They import coals, {alt» 
iron, and other necefTaries -, and export fiih and grain. 
About 500 bolls of {alt are imported annnally -, and this 
fummer (1793) 2500 bolls of wheat,r barley, oats, and meal^ 
have been exported fiom Buckie. 

ManufaQures. — Two or three weavers manufadure linen 
to the amount of L. 200 yearly \ and fome months ago a 
fmall manufaAure in hemp was eflabliibed at Buckie. A 
man from Dundee is employed to dreis the hemp, and it 
is afterward converted into lines, canvas, and nets. We 
have no flax-drefTer in the parifli, and yet the fpinning of 
flax into yarn is an important article. In 1750, a manu*' 
fadurer * in Cullen introduced this branch here ; and in 
1759* ^ weaver, dill alive, was the firft refiding agent em- 
ployed in this new li^e ; fince the above period, confider- 
able progreis has been made in it. The flax, moftly Dutch, 
is fent drcffed from Aberdeen, Fraferiburgh, Banff, Portfoy, 
Cullen, Huntley, Keith, and Fochabers, to diiFerent agents,

I. Buckie, the moft wefterly of the fiiher-towns, is fitoated 
at the month of the rivulet or bom of Buckie. Mr Boron 
Gordon is proprietor of the lands and houfes on the £• Sdt 
of the bum, and Mr Dunbar on the W. On the W. fide 
there are 102 houfes, and 400 inhabitants; of whom 175 
«re males, and 225 females: And on the £• fide, 63 hoafcSt 
and 303 inhabitants; of whom 136 are males, and 167 
females. The W. fide has been a fiihing fiation for 150 
years, and is, according to my information, the oldeft in the 
parifii. The date of the other fide as a fiihing ftation, I 
have not been able to afcertab. In 1723, a fiihing* boat 
and crew belonging to the Duke of Gordon, removed from 
Gollachie, which lies a mile wefiward, to Buckie, as being 
ft fafer and more commodious ftation. At that period the 
proprietor of Nether Buckie, who held his lands in feu from 
the Duke, had only one boat ; and as he was out of the 
kingdom, and in arrear to his Grace, the defired accommo* 
dation was the more eafily obtained. At prefent, there are 
14 boats and i yawl * employed in the fifheries. The boats 
are about 9 tons, and the yawl 4. Of thefe, 3 boats and I 
yawl belong to his Grace, 3 to Mr Dunbar, and 8 to Mr Ba-

a. Porteafy is fituajed at the diftance of fcatce 2 miles 
from Buckie. It became a fiibing ftation in 1727, when 
j houfes were built bj the proprietor of Rannes for the 
accommodation of the original fifliers from Findhorn. This 
information was obtained from a man aged 90, iliU alive, 
and a native of this parifli, who helped to man the firft boat* 
At prelent this filhertown contains 44 houfes, and 178 in- 
habitants ; and of thefe 84 are males, and 94 females i 
Thej have 5 large and 7 fmall boats. At the commence- 
ment of this ftation, Buckie had 5 boats, Findochtie 3, and 
Portnockie 5. 

3. Findochtie lies at the diftance of 2 miles from the for- 
mer ftation, and has 45 houfes, and i6a inhabitants ; 74 
males and 88 females. It was fettled in 1716 bj fiibers 
from Frafer(burgh, according to the information of a wo- 
man aged 91, who was married to one of the originiil fifli- 
ers in 172 1. Portnockie, of which ilie is a native, at the 
time of her removal, had 3 boats. There are at prefent 4 
large, and 6 (mall boats in Findochtie. 

4« Portnockie is at the diftance of 2 miles from Findoch- 
tie. The following anecdote afcertains its origin as a fiib- 
ing ftation : About 20 years ago died Kattie Slater, aged 
96. like many old people ftie was unable to tell her age 
precifelj ; but flie recoUe&amp;ed that flie was as old as th6 
houfe of Farlkane, as her father had often told her that he 
built the firft houfe in Portnockie the fame year in which 
the houfe of Farlkane was built, and that flie was brought 
from Cullen to it, and rocked in a fifliet's fcull inftead of a 
cradle. Now bj the date on the houfe of Farfl^ane, it ap- 
pears to have been built in 1677. Thus the origin of 
Portnockie is fixed with fufficient accuracy. At prefent

and the fmaU ones 4. The original coil of one of the foraer, inclndrng 
ftil, mail, oan, and lines, is abont L. 14 » and of the latter, half that iaa. 
In coniidefatioo of receiving a fpedfied rent aanyailjr, the prafinetor al^ 
lows L. II to evcty ocw to puichaie a new boat, which is uaderilood to 
laik 7 years, called here the long nin. Then a matnal contrad is entered 
into between the proprietor and the crew, wherrm he engages to iecvre 
them in the property of the boat ; and they bind dieaielves to ferve in it, 
and pay their rent during the teim of 7 yeark If the boat is jodgcd unfit 
for iea before the end of the leafe, and application b made for a new 
one, a dedndlion is made for every deficient year of the boat's mn to the 
extent of L. 1 , 15 s. which goes in part of the L. 1 1 for another boat. In 
the different towns the rent is different. The average rent of each boat ia 
L. 5 : 3 : 3, and 6 dried cod or ling. ThefnaaU boats are the property of 
the fiihen, and pay no rent. As they have no ijaiall boao at Buckie, the 
large ones are ufed at all fealbns. In the other towns, the large ones are 
nfed from the end of February to the end of Jolj ; and the fmall one* at 
all other times. 

Every large boat has a crew of 6 men and a boy. Each man has a line 
containing from 100 to 120 hooks, at the diitance of 7 fathoms from one 
another. The boy*s line is half the length of a man's. From the end of 
February, when the feafon for grett fiih begins, till the end of April, tbej 
leldom go above 16 leagues from the fhorein queft of cod and ling. From 
the beginning of May they launch out to the diftance of 23 leagues in 
Search of flute. They are foond in gieateft number in a particular place 
of Caithneis, called the Skate-hole. Cod, ling, flcate. halibut, and a few 
toik, are the only g^at filh eanght in the Moray frith. Cod, ling, and 
tnik are failed in pits on the beach, as they are caught and dried on the 
rocks for iale. Skate is dried without (alt, and the halibut is ufed frelh. 
Of thefe, ling and ikate are the moft valuable to the fiibers, becauie their 
liven yield much oil. Cod, ling, and tufli are in feafon from May to Fe- 
bruary ; flute is good through the whole year, and halibut in higheft 
fiate of perfeAion about July. About the end of June, the dry fifli ia

as much at the end of the fiihery. Thofe, again, who 
prefer the boanty, receive L. 8 certain, with the nfnal 
quantity of whiiky, 5 s. arrival money, as they call it, 2 s. 
weekly for their Saturday's pint, and 5 s. at the time of 
their departure. When .the fiihery fails, this is the prefer- 
able plan, but when it anfwers tolerably well, the for- 
mer is moft lucrative. In a good feafon, a boat may take 
40 barrels in a night ; however, from 50 to 100 barrels b 
the ufual rate of fiihing in fiivourable feafons. The gene- 
ral 

ctrry from L. 60 to L. 70 worth. The great fi(b generally bring froa 
JL. 8 to L. 12 a man, and half that fam for the boy. 

The crew of a (mail boat confifts of 5 men and a boy. In the fame 
fiHiing fiation, every man*s line is of equal length ; but in the different 
lUtions they are of different lengths. It contains from 600 to 900 hooks, 
at the diftance of one fathom from one another; and a boy*s half as many. 
The fmall boats arc ufed for catching hadd-^cks, whitings, flounders, Ice. 
Befides thefe, a good many great fi(h are caught with the fmall lines, and 
pickled for the London market. Haddocks are in prime from Aufuit to 
February; whicing* are worft in Auguft; the gray fluunder is bed ia 
hanreft ; and the fpotted, which is inferior to the gray, is heft in fpriog. 
Mackerels are caught from the beginning of July to the end of Auguft, by 
% line funk with lead. Herrings are fometimcs plentiful on the coai^, and 
tliesr feafoa is the fiune with that of mackerel. Haddocks, 10 yetrs ago* 
were caught within half a mik of the ihore ; for fereral yean none have 
been found nearer than from 7 to 10 leagues off lajni, till of Iate» that they 
have again made their ^^carance hard by tb« fliore. The income of the

ral coarfe of their fifliiog has been at Scazigo, and in die 
bead of the Moraj frith ; and their engagements with the 
owners of veflels cleared out on the bount j. The herrings 
on this coaft are generally better than thofe caught fiurther 
fouth, and bring a higher price by 2 s. the barrel at leaft 
for home ufe. Montrofe, Dundee, the towns on the frith 
of Forth, and Newc^e, are the beft markets for large her- 
rings ; and Jamaica, and the Weft India iflands, for the 
middle fized and fmall herrings. They are exported froia 
IfOndon, Newca(Ue, Greenock, and a few from Leith. The 
berring-filhery is flu&amp;uating and precarious. When the 
fiihing is fmall, the adventurer lofes \ when a full cargo is 
caught, or nearly fp, the profit may amount to about 4s« 
the barrel ^. 

Cod'Fi/hny.^Thls is fufceptible of confiderable improve- 
ment. From ift Odober to the middle of February, « 
great many cod are caught on the fmall lines, which, if 
they are not loft, are fold for a trifle, as they cannot be 
dried. From 300 to 40c barrels of cod, and from 100 to 
aoo of codlings, a fmaller cod, might be cured annually, 
during the period fpecified above, in the 4 fiiher-towns be- 
longing to the parifli. Two attempts have been made in

In 1 787, Meflf s Falls employed feveral boats on the coaft with great fuc

herrings, lliefe gentlemen dropped th^s fifhery after one Uial; and it 
remained negle^ed, except by the country people* who, in fine nightsb 
were very fuccefsful, till 1791 and 1793, when fome boats were employed

long as neceflary in the fait, are generally dried for a few 
days, and even the winter feafon» after (alting, will dry 
them fufficien^tly. The beft markets in Scotland for fsJt 
cod, are Edinburgh, Glafgow, Leith, Borrowftounoefsi 
s^nd all the coaft-towns on the firith of Forth. The prin* 
cipal market for pickled or barrelled cod is London, 

Lobfitr-Fi/bery, — ^In 1 792, all the fiihers on the coaft en- 
tered into a contraft for j years with Meflrs. Selby and 
Company of London, or with the Northumberland Fiihery 
Society, to fiih for lobfiers, when they did not find it pru-

take all their lobilers at %i d. a-piece, provided they mea- 
fare 6 inches from the point of the nofe to the end of the 
bois, and when under that iize, two are efteemed equivalent 
to one. Lobilers are in feafbn from zil February to the 
end of June, and from lil November to Chriihnas. Laft 
year lobilers to a confiderable value were caught on this 
coail ; but leis attention has been paid to them this year, 
owing partly to the great fucceis of the white fiihery, and 
partly to the amazing quantity of lobilers caught on the 
coail of Caithneis, which the Companies have at a cheaper 
rate, vi%. at i4 d. for the largeil fize. I am unable to ilate 
the produA of this fiihery for the lail year in all the 4 towns, 
by reafon of the removal of fome of the Companies agents.

do not engage in it. 

I have only farther to obferve on the fubjeft o^ the 
filheries, that a few £dmon are caught in the parifli. at the 
mouths of the rivulets or bums of Goilachie and Tynct. 
They are commonly called ftall fifiieries. Of thefe there are 
a at Tynet, belonging to Mr Stuart at Tanachie, and 2 at 
Gollachy, belonging to Mr Baron Gordon and Mr Dunbar. 
The 4 might produce about L. 24 annually to the pro- 
prietors.

and are kept in repair by the Aatute-labour. The poll-

road pafles through the parifli in a weilerly direffion for 
upwards of 8 miles. The firft j from Cullen to the bora 
of Buckie, are almoft equally good in all feafons, and eafil j 
kept in excellent repair. The other 3 miles not having, 
fo good a bottom, are apt to become deep in rainy wea- 
ther ; it is in contemplation to change the diredion of this 
road in part ; and it will require great attention to pre- 
vent the public from fuffering by the alteration, when car- 
ried to the intended extent. On entering the parifli^ the. 
beautiful arch of the bridge over the rivulet at CuUen, 
houfe, ftrikes the eye of the beholder on the left hand. 
After paffing the bridge in the line of the public road, 
which is too narrow and wants parapets, fine fields, and 
thriving plantations adorn the fceneiy for the firft 3 miles, 
and cheer the weary traveller, in fpite of a mois on the

nies him for more than a miles. A bleak and dreary pro-

* To the right, on thii moor, at the diftance of lOO paces from the 
road, is an eminence evidently artificial, called Tarrieclcrack, and fup- 
pofed by fome to be a burial-place. The yiew is confined, - at before, by 
hills and moors, covered with heath. Hardly does any pleafant obje^ 
appear to break the barren uniformity, and relieve the mind. At length 
a peep of the Moray frith, and of the Caithnels hills, at the diilance of 
99 miles, dii&amp;lves the gloom, and awakens the attention to a fertile 
country, finely variegated with little hills and fertile plains* in a high 
ftate of cultivation. The bum of Tynet, which feparates this parifli 
from Belly, ftands in need of a bridge. Though its courfe be but fliort, 
and- quantity of water trifling in dry weather ; yet in rainy ieafons, it is 
frcqoeotly fwelled into a torrent, which the traTeller ctonot pals with^

quays would be necelTarj. In their prefent ftate, tbe nn!' 
ted exertions of the men and women are employed in 
dragging the boats up the beach, to fecure them from be- 
ing brdcen by the waves, and fimilar efforts mnft be made 
in launching. Thefe daily operations are very hurtful to 
the boats, and fometimes fatal to the men. At Buckie and 
Findochtie only can piers, or quays, be conftrufted. Their 
advantages are many and important, and the want of them 
is feverely felt by people of all defcriptions. The land- 
carriage of heavy goods from Aberdeen, Banff or Portfoj, 
adds confiderably to their price, and operates as a tax oa 
the confumer. Coals, fait and iron are fometimes unload- 
ed in the fummer feafon at Buckie, but at the rilk of lo- 
fing the veffel. With the laudable view of obviating thefe 
inconveniencies, the proprietor of Buckie, not many yean 
ago, caufed a furvey of the harbour, and plan of a pier to 
be made on the eaft fide of the bum ; and languine hopes 
were entertained by the public, of the advanuges that 
would accrue from the execution of a plan which promifed 
fafety, and 14 feet of water at neap tides. But this ufefiil 
and meritorious undertaking has not hitherto been execu- 
ted. It is, however, I would fain hope, only fufpended, 
not abandoned. A pier at Buckie would be a Handing 
monument of the Baron's generofity, and ferve to hand 
him down to future ages as the father of his people, and 
friend of mariners *. Findochtie, though at prefent oe-

Buckie merchants and fiihers to effedluate it. To render this aadertap 
king fafer and more extenfively ufeful, it was' judged proper to have a 
fmall pier or bulwark on the eaft fide of the burn, which cosld not be 
done without permiffion from Mr Baron Gordon. A petition was therefbie

It as fufceptible of being improved into one of the beft and

by the hand of nature, for a fafe and eafy retreat in tern- 
peftuousi weather to veflels in the Moray &amp;ith, that are 
unable, to make Cromarty on tbe oppofite ihore. The di- 
Aance between &amp;em is 60 nules due eaft and weft. It is 
find that Grovernmeot once ordered a furvey of Findochtie 
to be made, but from what motive I never heard. I em- 
ployed one of the fiihers to take the breadth of the en* 
trance into this beautiful bafoo, at a rock called the Bea- 
con, 00 the weft, and low- water foundings at a neap tide, 
in the central point, where the water is moft iballow ; and 
from an.exad menfuration, the entrance was found to be 
90 yard^ v^de, aod the water a.i feet deep* Hence, it is 
capable of receiving a fliip of the line, and .capacious c- 
noogh to contain all the vefTels belonging to the Moray 
frith. Language can hardly paint it in a more advanta- 
geous light than it deferves. It attrads the obfervation, 
and arrefis the attention of every beholder. I am well af- 
fured that it might be made a moft complete harbour, for

Tcd could not hurt his intereft. This petition was unfortunately pre* 
fented at a time, when the Baron, by reafon of a circunnftance in which 
he was deeply interefted, took little or no concern in j^uiinefs of any 
kind. It has therefore, in all probability, efcaped his notice, or it is 
moft likely, that he would have granted a requeil that could not pofll- 
bly be hurtful to him, and might be beneAcial to hi« own people. It b 
imagined, that L. 3^3 would build a tolerably comoiodioos hirbour at 
the bum mouth ; L. 230 would make it a good creek at all fcaTjns ; aa4

The different ages in the whole annexed part could not 
be conveniently obtained. To account fatisfaflorily for fo 
great a difproportion between the males and females is not 
ao eafjr matter. Owing to the difference in our religious 
tenets, no regular regifter of baptifms can be kept. Con- 
fequently there is no means of afcertaining the proportion 
between the males and females bom in the pariih. The 
great difproportion obfervable from the above ftate, may 
be attributed to loffes fuflained at fea, no numbers enga- 
ging in our fleets and armies \ and to an influx of poor 
women from the Highlands, for the convenience of living 
more comfortably.

Ftf^/.~-Peat or turf from the hill of Oldmore, and the

in winter often very fcarce. The {Jtnall cart4oad of peats

the confunier pays at the rate of a halfpenny for 4 peats 
and I turf. Under fuch circumilances, as the few only are 
able to afford this heavy expenfe, it is evident, that Mr 
Dundas has done an eflential fervice to the many, in pro- 
curing a repeal of the duty on coals, and merits well

with their children in the chincough ; but as nothing ii faid of the be- 
nefit reaped from it, it *s prefumed, that its vogue is owing more to cu- 
|lom than to its medicinal qualities. There are two chalybeate fpringf

therefore Mr Dundas, Sir John Sinclair, or any otlier gen- 
tleman diftinguiflied for Patriotifm and Parliamentary in- 
tereft, would procure a revifion of the falt-laws, the aboli- 
don of the duty on fait, and the extenfion of an adequate 
duty to boats, as well as bufles ; he would endear himfelf 
to the prefent generation, and tranfmit his name to the 
future, as the friend and benefador of his country. And 
were an ad of Parliament procured, to enable proprie- 
tors in general, and others, who expend their money in 
making commodious harbours, to impofe a wharfage or 
tax on the trade, propordoned to the fum expended, or the 
advantages fecured \ and the foftering hand of Govern* 
ment ilretched out to aid the public to conftrud harbours,

^ There is t lirge hrap of ftones on an eminence in one of Lord Find- 
later*! enclofurcs, near Woodfide, fouthward of the public read, com- 
lAonly called the King's Calm. And tradition Ayi, that it is the grave 
of Indolphut, the 77th King of Scotland, vho, after obtaining a com- 
pete Yi^ory over the Danes, was onfortunately kiUed ncnr this fpot. 
According to Abercromby, this vidtory was gained A. D. ^i : accord- 
ing to Buchanan, in 967. In this pariih, the above event is diitinguilhed 
by the name of the Battle of the Bauds, then an eitenfive moor^ now a 
plantation belonging to Lord Findlater : and it is believed, erfoneoaily 
indeed, that by it the Danes were finally expelled from Scotlnd. Bu. 
chUian places their final eapulfion in the reign of Duncan L and 84th 
King of Scotland A. D. 1043 ; when, after receiving a great overtbroiv 
in Fife, and refle(5ling on their many unfortunate expeditions to Scotland, 
they bound themfelves by a folemn oath to return to it no more as ene- 
mies. On the moor between Findochtie and the plantation of the Bauds, 
a great number o( fttiall cairns are diflingaifliable, and fuppoTed to be the 
burial places of the Danes, who were flaio in the engagement witli Iq- 
dulphus. About 30 years ago, a country man difcovered, in a tumulus 
kr cairn, on the lands of Raones, which he was removing, a ftone coffin, 

containing

ranfack this grave, I found it covered with a Urge Hone, 4 feet long

4 other ftones, fet on their edges, which ferved as a coffin to part of a 
fcull, and jaw-bone, with fevenl teeth, and fonie fragments of a thigh 
bone. The dimenfions of this coffin were 3 feet i inch in length, 2 feet 
wide, and ai inches deep. There was no ftone in the bottom. The 
bones were removed into a fimilar cheft, a few feet northward of this 
one, kt the fame tumuius; this laft one was difcovcred 4 or 5 years ago, 
by a map in the neighbourhood, who was removing a few more of the 
ftones for building a houfe. It is of fmaller dimenfions than the other

They affift in dragging the boats on the beach, and in

at unfeafonable hours, carry their hulbands on board, and

When northerly winds, or a high fea, prevent the boats 
from going a-fiihing, the men are employed in repairing

the advantages that local fituation can give. ' And ita 
greatcft difadvantages have already in part been mendon-i 
cd. Man J melancholy examples of the fatal confequencea 
arifing from the want of harbours have been ptOi.uced ; 
and extreme inconvenierlcj and frequent dangers are ex* 
pet fenced, from having no cuftom-houfe nearer than In- 
vemelis, which is 50 miles diftant. The failure of the plan 
in agitation, for obtaining a cuftom-houfe at Banff, muft ' 
prove a great iois to the fiiheries and manufadures in this 
comer. Stiort leafes, and what is here termed run rigging, 
are hurtful to the farmer. It has already been oblerved, 
that a great part of the pari(h is expofed to the north- weft- 
erly winds, which are often hurtful to the crop. And 
even this inconveniency is fufceptible, in fome meafure, 
of being rethedied. For proper encouragement, to enclofe, 
and plant hedges, on a judicious plan, would contribute to 
counteract the ill efFefts of thefe wmds, by {heltering the 
fields from their influence.

ning through a deep and narrow glen *• The parilh is ez« 
tenlive ; of an irregular form ; at an average it may be 
reckoned 8 miles in length from S. to N. and 5 in breadth 
firom £. to W; It is bounded by the pariihes of Beath, 
Daigety, and Inverkeithing on the £. ; of Camock aad 
Torryburn on the W; of CUefhaad Saline on the N. ; and 
on the S. by the frith of Forth. The air in general is dry 
and lalubrious, but there is a very perceptible difference as 
to climate in the pariih, being much milder in the fouthem 
party which flopes gently to the fea, than (owards the N. 
where the ground continues to rife, and is more hilly and 
ezpofed. The pariih conuins a variety of foils : In gene- 
ral towards the S. of the town, called the laigh land, the 
foil is fertile, moftly in tillage, and in many places in a 
ftate of high cultivation; towards the N. the foil is greatly 
inferior in quality, in many places covered with heath, and 
containing mofies of coniiderable extent, though many fpots 
are well cultivated, yet the land in general is chiefly adapt- 
ed to pafturage. 

Borough^ ProfpiS, Conjlitutionj C/r.-— Dunfermline is a 
Royal Borough^ the feat of the Prelbytery, and one of the 
mod confiderable manufaduring towns in Fife. It is 3 miles 
from the (ea, and about 190 feet above its level ; the great, 
er part of the town b iituated on a hiU or rifing ground, 
having a pretty bold declivity towards the S. ; the grocmd, 
however, foon flattens, fo that what is called the Nether 

towa 

• Tbe Btoatioii mtift have accorded ftill more eziAly witfatbe name, if 
tve fappofe, as feeros highly probable, that Dunfermlioe owes its appella- 
tion to a little peninfnlated hill Iituated in the glen ; from this hill the* 
borongh has borrowed its arms ; it is of finall circomference, but of con- 
ridcrable height, very ragged and fteep towards the N., and appears to 
hare bem anciently a place ofllrenglh; a tower bvUt upon it was tbe 
r;fidence of Malcolm Canmore.

the borough is a tower, or fort, fapported by two lions, en- 
clofed in circles ; round the exterior circle is written, 5f^t/- 
bun Civiiatis Fermfloditm\ and round the interior one, Efi^ 
Rupts Inacceffa ; on the reverfe, is a female figure with a 
iceptre in her hand, and on each fide an invened fword, 
point npwards, and round Margaretta Regina Scotorum. The 
annual revenue of the borough is confiderabi j above L. 500 
Sterling. Eight public fairs are held thfough the year *, 
and two days in the week, Wednefday and 'Friday, are ap- 
pointed for markets ; the maiket on Wednefday has for 
ibme time fallen into difufe. 

JlfAns^0«m.— This town has long been diftingoiihed 
for the manufiaidure of diaper or table linen : For many 
years paft, no other cloth has been woven in the parifli to 
any confiderable extent. In the infancy of the tradte, it was 
the cuflom to weave diaper only during the fuikimcr, the 
winter being employed m weaving ticks and checks. This 
pfaAioe continued till about the year 1749, ^hen the ma* 
niiiifiure of ticks and checks was in a great meafure re- 
lini|aiikedt- Since the above period the diaper trade has 
been gradoaUy increafing; in 1788 there were about 900, 
and laft year (179a) no left than iico looms employed in 
the trade ; ^f this number, above 8co belonged to die pa- 
riih» The value 'of goods annually manufadured has for

f AboQt'7 or % yean ago when the diaper trade was low, fooie of the 
manafa^uren had recoorfe to the making ticks and checks; but the tradef- 
men being unaccuftomed to the work, engaged in it with diflike, tad it 
was given up as foon as the diaper trade revived.

fbme time paft been from L. 50,000 to L. 60,000 Sterliag, 
.and the trade was on the increafe. Aftonifbuig improve- 
ments have been made within lefsthan half a century in the 
art of weaving, and in the manufafture of table-linen : Bjr 
^he introduSion of machinerj labour has been greatly a- 
bridged. Formerly, in weaving diaper, two, and fome- 
times three perfons, were requifite for one w«b ; now, by 
means of the fly-ihuttle, and What is called a frame for rai- 
fing the figure, a fingle weaver can work a web 24- yards 
broad without the leaft ai&amp;ftance. Many of the tradefmen 
in this place difcover confiderable genius in drawing figures 
for the diaper, and feveral of them have obtained premiums 
for their draughts. Table cloths can be fumiihed of any 
defired breadth, length, and fineness ; and noblemen and 
gentlemen may have their coats of arms and mottos 
wrought into any table-linen they choofe to commifSon. 
In the cheft of the incorporation there is preferved a vtrj 
carious fpecimen of the weaving art : It is a man's ihirt 
wrought in the loom about 100 years ago, by a weaver of 
this place of the name of Ingles. The fliirt is without feam, 
and was finiihed by the ingenious artifan without the leaft 
^fiiflance from the needle ; the only necefifary part he could 
not accompltlh was a button for the neck *. 

^own-Improvements. — In fpeaking of thefe, it would be 
injuftice to pafs oyer in filence the name of Mr George Chal- 
mers, late of Pittencrieff. To the enlightened and fpirited 
exertions of this gentleman, in order to promote the feuing 
put of his lands, Dunfermline is indebted for one of its

greateft improvement! $ we mean the bridge bailc by him 
over the glen, by which an eafj (nd healthful commnnioe* 
tion has been opened up to the town on the W. immediate- 
I7 oppofite to the principal flreet. Formerly, the otilj 
road from the W. was by the bcidge at Makolen's Tower, 
running eaftward, clofe by the Qj^n s Heufe, and then N. 
to the town by a confined narrow koe. The bridge was 
a work of great labour and eapenfe *. Within theie 30 
years the trade and population of this place have rapidly 
increafed. On the S. the Abbey Park has been fcued, 
and feveral ftreets built upon it, and immediately on the 
W. additions are daily making to the eztenfive feus on the 
lands of Pittencrieff: The population on this eilate at pre* 
fent exceeds izco fouls. It is but joftice to obierve, that 
the police of the borough has within thefe few years been 
much improved : A laudable attention has been paid to the 
paving of the ftreets, and fumiihing them vrich additional 
lamps ; and much greater care has of late been uken to 
keep the ftreets clean, a pradice highly worthy of imita- 
tion. Nothing is more necefiary to the health of the in- 
habitants than cleanlineiS) efpecially where the ftreets of a 
town are narrow, which is the cafe with moft of our Scotch 
boroughs : This confideration, and the high price which

• The briflge is of a peculiar Arudure. An arch 197 feet lonjf, 
I a broad, and 15 feet 5 inches high, was thrown over the bum, in the bof- 
tom of the glrii, and the remaining hollow filled up by a mound of earth 
68 feet 6 inches thick at the centre, having a gradual 6opc on both fidaa 
to the eirremitiet of the ftone arch below. On the top is tbe road now 
almoit completely enclofed en both fides by houfes forming a very ncit 
•ftreet. On the fides or Hopes of the mound, and at the back of the houles, 
are vfry c^^nvenient hanging gardens. The whole was finilhed by Mr 
Chalmers at his own expenfe, the town only allowing a fmall piece of 
ground necefiary for carrying on the undertaking. Mr Chahners fubjeAcd 
|i acres of his eftate to the payment of ceft to the town, and thc^ bur- 
dened 3 of their acies with the payment of x d. to Fittancrieflf.

of magiflrates idezcufaUe when they do ikot attend to this 
moft neceffiiry branch of p(lioe *. As another very com- 
metfdaUe improvement, tvemay mention the removal of the 
bttWbers (formerly icattered through different parts of the 
town) into one public flefh-market, and the obligmg theai 
to kiH their cattle in a flaoghter-houfe bnilt for the purpofci 
at ferae diftancefrom the market, and entirely removed out 
of the town. An officer has lately been appiMnted, whofe 
conftant employment b to overfee the pdice of the bo« 
rough : He faperintends the cleaning of the ftreets, attends 
the fifli and butter matkets, and examines the weights, fei- 
zing on what be finds deficient ; thas an immediate and 
confhmt check is given to irapofitions on the public : He 
fikewife difmiflcs all vagrants found begging in the town. 
Formerly the inhabitants were very much harafled with 
ftranger poor, but are now efledually delivered from that 
bufd^n. The oflicer of police has L. 25 a^year ; and from 
hxseiW and diligence he weU deferves it. 

jUwntiqget and Oi/advaniaget of the Towii ^— •The great 
abiisdance of coals in the parifli, the ibort carriage, and 
comparatively eafy rate at which they can be purchafed, 
render Dunfermline highly favourable for carrying on ex- 
tei^ive manufa£hires. Coals may be had at half a mile's

might accrue to Dunfermline as a place of trade, and much

charity from different funds are numerous. No vagrants 
have been permitted for fome time paft to aik alms in the 
borough. The poor belonging to the fedaries are not admitted 
on the parifli funds ; the money coUeded at fome of their

There b no fcheme refpeding the poor to which objec-

and of great importance, to difcourage vagrants, and to 
confine beggars to their refpe&amp;ive pariflies, who ought to 
fupport their own poor ; thus the worthlefs and fturdy beg- 
gar will be difcovered, and the public no longer impofed 
Upon by pretended objeds of charity. With regard to the 
beft mode of fupporting the poor, there is a variety of opi- 
nions. It is no doubt unreafonable that the burden fkould 
fall chiefly on thofe who are leaft able to bear it, and that 
non-refiding heritors, though they draw confiderable rents 
from a parilh, ihould contribute little or nothing towards 
the fupport of its poor \ on the other hand, poors rates are

ereded into a temporal Lordihip in 15931 and beftowed 
on Queen Anne of Denmark, James VPs Queen. This 
Lordfliip included all the lands which belonged to the mo-

accounted for, from the church having never been legally 
divided among the heritors, the non-refidence of fome of

Eminent Per fans. — Dunfermline was the birth place of 
the Princefs Elizabeth from whom hk prefcot Majeily is 
defcended. As Dunfermline was the ufoal refidence of 
Malcolm Canmore and his illuftrious Queen, fome (hort 
notice of* thefe perfonages will not, it is prefumed, be ixn- 
proper. Malcolm Canmore was the eldeft fon of Duncmo, 
King of Scotland, who was aflaiUnatcd by Macbeth. Upon 
the ofurpation of Macbeth, Malcolm fled into Engknd, 
and during his exile in that country, reiided a confiderable 
time at the court of Edward the Gonfeflbr ; throu;;h the 
exertions of Macduff, Thane of Fife, and Siward, Earl of 
Northumberland, the ufurper was flain, and Malcolm af- 
cended the throne of his father in 1037. About 1070 
Malcolm efpoufed the celebrated Margaret *. Malcolm, 
(fays Lord Hailes), " was a prince utterly illiterate, of in- 
trepid courage, but of no diftinguiflied abilities/' With 
refped to the internal polity of Lis kingdom, he appears 
to have been guided by Queen Margaret. An incident 
is related of Malcolm, which is highly defcriptive of his 
charaSer. Having received intelligence that one of his 

nobles 

* Margaret was the daughter of Edward, fon of Edmund Iron- 
fide, King of England. Upon William the Conqueror afcending the 
Engliih throne, Edgar, fon of Edward, with his mother Agatha, and 
two fillers, Margaret and Chriflian, retired into Scotland. Sume authors 
fay that being on a voyage to Hungary, they were accidentally driven 
thither by a ilorm. The place in the Frith where the ftiip anchored is 
a fmall bay, abonl a mile N, W. of the N. (Jueensferry. near the pre- 
fent toIUbar. This bay is called St Margaret's Hope. On a ftair-cafe ia 
the houfe of Pennycutk, in Mid Lothian, there is a painting which rc[ie. 
ients the landing of Margaret at the Hope, the proceflkn from thence 

^to Dunfermline, and the King and Q^cen. the day after their marriage, 
entertaining a number of mendicants^ The proceflion is faid to have 
been on foot. On the fide of the prefent road, near Pitrtaviey about two 

miles from Dunfermline, is a large ftone called St l^Iargaret's ftone. 

Here fiie is faid to have rcfted. leaning on this ftone. N. and S. Queens- 

ferry derive their name from St Margaret.

nobles had formed a defign agdinfl hn life, he fought aa 
opportunity of meeting the traitor in a folitary place.* 
'* Now, faid he, unfheathing his fword, we are all alone) 
and armed alike, jou feek my life, take it." The peni- 
tent threw himfelf at the King's feet, implored forgiveneiSy 
and obtained it. At the earned requeft of Margaret, 
Malcolm is faid to have aboliihed an abominable law of 
King Evenus or Eugenius. " Uxoris eriam precibus de- 
diffe fertur, ut primam nova nnptae nodem, qu« proceri- 
bus per gradus quofdam lege Regis Eugenii deUeb^tur; 
fponfus dimidinta argenti marca redimeri pofTet : quam 
penfionem adhuc Marchetaa mulierum vocant." Buch. 
lib. 7* 21. 

Malcolm was flain at the fiege of Alnwick in Northum- 
berland 13th September 1093, his bodj was depofited at 
Tin mouth, and afterward brought to Dunfermline. 

The charader of Queen Margaret is fully and elegantly 
delineated by Lord Hailes in his Annals. " She reft^red 
(fays he) the religious obfervance of Sunday, an inftitu- 
tion no lefs admirable in a political than in a religious 
light. In the adminiilration of her houfehold, ihe fo 
blended fevcrity of manners with complacency, that (he 
was equally revered and loved by all who approached her. 
She entertained many ladies about her perfon, employed 
their leifure hours in the amufensents ot the needle, and 
gave iiri£^ attention to the decency of their condud. la 
her prefence, fays Turgot, nothing luifeemly was ever done 
or uttered. On the education of her children, (he beftow- 
cd the moft confcientious care. She enjoined their pre- 
ceptors to chaftife thtm ;ts oft as they needed chsflifement. 
On them flie bellowed her tendered thoughts in her dying 
moments. Turgot pathetically defcribes his lad interview 
with this afFe£tionate mother. After long difctmrfe on her 
fpiritual ftate, (he thus addrefled him, " Farewell, n^y life

is ufed as manure. Kelp is occaOonallj made in Dnull 
quantities. Salt is alfo made, which is reckoned of an cs* 
celltnt quality. Soap is mann&amp;Anred in fmaller qnanti- 
tics than formerly. There are two ezceDent harbours. 
The one is (ituated at the village of LiAiekihs, and the o- 
ther at Charleftown. They admit vefiels at ftream tides, 
from 260 to 300 tons. Many of the articles imported in- 
to the country are conveyed to thefc harbours ; and from 
them, a great deal of its valuable prodnfllions are exported 
to other parts. 

Agriculture^ 6^. — The foil is various. The low ground 
is a deep, ftrong, black loam, which gradually becomes 
lighter towards the N. Clay is found in ev^ery field, at no 
great diftance from the furface. In fome places it b cover- 
ed with earth that is brown and gravelly, and in other places 
with what is dark, extremely rich, and fertile. Above 
the town, the foil is much inferior to the foil below it. 
Though greatly improved of late years, yet many acres of 
moor and morafs fiill remain in a wild and uncultivated 
ftate, of which the one half is improvable. In this, as in 
the other diflridb of Scotland, hufbandry was in a languid 
ftate till about the middle of this century. Inattention, in- 
dolence, fervitudes, bad roads, the want of wheel carriages, 
and other neceflary implements of hufbandry, prevented all 
improvements. The land is divided among 80 proprietors, 
of whom the Earl of Elgin is the principal. His Lordfliip 
lately gave new leafes of moll of his farms, and buik excel- 
lent farmhoufes and offices upon them. His lands are 
fuISciently enclofed, and regularly fubdivided, with fences

kinds, in a profperous condition. His Lordfhip i» alfo

of the cquntrj. George Chalmers, £fq; late of Pitten- 
crieff, about 1760, begai) improving his lands after the 
EngliOi mode. Regajrdlels of the ancient cufioms and 
prejudices of the people, he perfevered in hisexpeniive im- 
provements, which for many ages will probably remain as 
monuments of his ingenuity. Much about the above men- 
tioned period, or foon after it, the late Sir John Halket of 
Pitferran began his judicious improvements. Unlike many 
thoughtlels landholders, who repair to populous cities to 
fpend their time, health, and fortunes in falhionable amufe- 
ments, extravagance, and folly, this Honourable Baronet re- 
fided on his eftate, infpeded his operations, and influ^aced 
his neighbours to cultivate the ground. Accordingly, it 
foon aflumed a new appearance. Agriculture became an 
objed of importance. Every landholder began to ftudy 
what kind of culture might ultimately become moil bene- 
ficial. A great deal of wafle land was drained, levelled, 
and enclofed. In fome places, the fences confift of (lone 
aad lime, and in other pUces, of fingle or double ditches, 
hedges, and plantation. On the barren and unimproveable 
parts of the country, many hundred thoufand trees are 
planted, which are profpering, enriching the foil, and be- 
coming a fource of wealth to the proprietors. The mod 
numerous and thriving are, the Scotch fir, beech, elm, 
plane, larix, fpruce, aih, and oak- AVith thefe, the town of 
Dunfermline lately planted 170 acres of its wafte land, 
which was not worth 6 d. the acre, but in jo years hence 
may bring L. 200 Sterling the acre. The climate and foil

ferent from the northern, the mode of cultivating and crop- 
ping is alfo different. The arable land on the S. is ploughed 
with Small's chain-plongh, drawn by two horfcs. In feme 
places on the N. the Scotch plough, drawn by four horfes, 
is ufed, and the ancient diftinftioa between croft and oaN 
field preferved. The whole manure is laid upon the cro&amp;) 
which is conilahtlj in tillage, while the outfield is occa- 
fionally ploughed, and afterwards left to reft. But tiiii 
mode of culture prevails only in a very few places, where 
manure cannot be obtained without great expenfe. On the 
S. of the town, the land is highly cultivated, and produces 
as luxuriant crops as any in the kingdom. Farms are ufu* 
ally divided into different portions, and the crops are in the 
following order : After fummer fallow, wheat is fown, the 
next year, barley, the following year, grais, and laft of all^ 
oats^ fome, after fummer-fallow or potatoes, fow wheat, 
peafe and beans, barley, grafs, and oats, in thdr order. 
Wheat is generally fown in September and Odober \ peafe, 
beans, and oats, from the middle of February to the end of 
April \ and barley, from the middle of March to the end

beginning or middle of April. Hay is made from the 
middle of June to the end of July. The other crops are 
ufually reaped from the middle of Auguft to the middle of 
Oftober ; fometimes the harveft is earlier, and fometimes ic

wheat b exported. 

Rent. — ^The valued rent of the pariih is L. 22,127 Scotch. 
It is difficult to afcertain the real rent, as many of the land- 
holders poffefs their own lands. In general, it b valued 
according to its quality, and diftance from the town of Ian- 
ferroline. In the immediate vicinity, it is feued from L. I 
to L. 20 ; and lets annually ft'om L. 3 to L. 5 Sterling the

acre. On the S. of the town, it lets annually from L. 1 to 
L. 3, and pn the N. from j s. to L. 1 Sterling the acre. 
One-third of the furface would let at L« if 5 8. and two- 
thirds at 10 s. Sterling the acre. Valuing the land in this 
xnanner, the whole furface, confifUng of 36 fquare miles, or 
23«040 fquare acres, would let at L. 17,280 Sterling a-year. 
Of this yearly rent, the fourth part may perhaps be fpent 
in the pariih. The value of farms is various. Many have 
fjoaall portions of land. About 50 &amp;nners pay annually 
from L. 50 to L. 100 } 30 from L. 100 to L. aoo ; 10 from 
L. aoo to L. 300 ) and 6 from L. 300 to L. 400 Sterling.

. JKfhvfr^.r— This parifli ^bounds with^ valuable mines and 
miiierals. In naanj places .there are prodigious rocks of 
frecAoney extremelj white, durable, and fiifceptible of a.fine 
palifl)' Granite, or blue whin, is alfo found in great quan- 
tities, and (of an excellent quality for paving fireets, making 
roads, and other u&amp;ful purpofes. Limeftone is found in 
various parts of the pariih, near the furface. This valuable 
foflil has lately been wrought to a great extent. Several 
{earns are quarried, and Aianufadured in the lands of Craig- 
lufcar, belonging to Charks Dury, Efq; and alfo in the 
lands of South Fod, belonging to Mr John Stenhoufe. Be« 
fides fupplyi^g the interior parts of the country in the im- 
mediate neighbourhood, the lime is carried to a confider- 
able diftance for manure and building. But the moil ex- 
t^ttfive Umeworks in this parilbi or even in Britain, be- 
l^cHiging to any par^c^lar perfon, are thofe of the Earl of 
Elgin, (ituated on the coaft of the frith of Forth. From 
the veiUgies oS limekilas along the fhore, the village of 
Limekilns derives its name ; and it appears from thefe 
ancient rains, that the limeworks were carried on at 
s very remote period. The f^am of limeftone is op- 
pofite to the Forth. It is a mile long fcom £. to W. from 
so to 50 feet thick, and dips to the £. and W. from about 
the centre. The late Earl, his Lordfiiip's father, who was 
no le&amp; diftinguiflied for his intelledual than his moral qua- 
lities, conceived the idea of extending his limeworks on a 
larger fcale th^n had ever been .a|ten^ted by any of his 
anceftor$. Accordingly, in the years 1777 and 1778, his 
Lordihip began to build nine large draw-kilns, a harbour, 
waggon- ways, for drawing the ftone from the quarry to the 
kilnheads, and a village for accommodating his wo]:k people, 
which, after himfelf, was called Charleilown. As the 
works were great, the expenfe was proportionable \ before 
they were finiflied, the neceflary utenGb for quarrying pro- 
cured, and the difficulties infeparable from new and great 

undertakings

undertakings fnrmoiQnted, it is &amp;id tbey coft mbove 
L. 14,000 Sterling. But great as thb expeafe was, it has 
been repaid. By prudent arFangements, and conflant at- 
tention, the works have fucceeded beyond ezpe£ladrsu 
Their fuocels was partly owing to the fidelity and difere^ 
tion of the managers, and party to the valuable qualities of 
the lime, which fccured for it a ready and an exf enfive 
fale. Ever fince their commencement, the public has pro« 
greffively increafed its demands. From 80,000 to 90,000 
tons of limeftone are quarried annually. It b partly mana- 
faftured into lime at the works ; and partly fold in the nn- 
burnt ftone. Of the manufadured lime, about aoo,300 
bolb of iheUs, or unflocked lime; and from 30,000 to 
40,00c chalders, at 18 bolb the chalder. of flocked lime, 
are annually fold in 1300 feparate cargoes. The total aa* 
nual value b above L. 10,000 Sterling. Lime Ihelb, in- 
cluding all expenfe at (hipping, are fold at L. 4 Sterling the 
hundred boUs ; flacked lime at 5 s. 3 d. the chalder, or 3-r d. 
the boll; and limeftone at x s. 8 d. the ton. The principal 
market for the lime b along the coafts of the frith of Forth 
and Tay, and the N. of Scotland. From 30 to 50 vefieb 
are ufually Ijing at Charl^ftown, waiting their turns of 
loading limeflielb during the fummer months *^.— From the 
very liberal credit that has always been given at thefe 
works, it is obvious, that a large capital is necefiary for 
carrying them on. But neither the money funk in ereAing 
nor conducing them has been \tA. While they have am- 
ply rewarded their noble proprietor, they have oocafioned 
an extenfive circulation of money *, retained in their native

'^vorks for the good of the country, that have ever been un- 
dertaken in this part of the kingdom^— Ironfione is found 
in, the lands belonging to Sir Charles Halket, Baronet. Of 
this mineral there are two fcams at a fmall diftance from 
each other. The uppermoft is 4 inches, and the lowermoft 
24 inches thick. Being above a feam of coal, they are 
wrought along with it. They are of an excellent quality 
for making cannon/ and have been exported to the Carron 
Company for that purpofe. The ironflone began to be 
iTvrought by that Company in 1771, and in 1773 ^^ 1774» 
there were 60 miners, and as many bearers employed in 
the mines. Since that period, the ironftone has been 
ivrought by the tackfimen of the coaL — Coal is alfo found 
in great abundance in almoft every part of this pariih. The 
coal mines of this parifli are the moft ancient in Scotland. 
The earlieft account of coal ufed as fuel, is a charter of 
William de Oberwill, in which he granted liberty to the 
Abbot and Convent of Dunfermline to open a coal-pit 
wherever they inclined, excepting on his arable land, and 
permitted them to take as much as was neceflary for their 
own ufe, and to open a new mine whenever the old was 
exhaufted ; but not to fell any part of it to others. The 
charter is dated at Dunfermline, on the Tuefday immedi- 
atoly before the feaft of St Ambrpfe xapi*. But at that early 

period

diftindion in the conntrj. In progrels of time it was moce 
generally n(ed as fiiel; and when trade began to flomiihy it 
was exported to foreign parts. Although it waa worked 
by crop levels ever fince the above motioned period, there 
was little exported till about the middle of this centary. 
Even fo late as X763« the annnal value of exported coal 
was only L. 200 ; and in 1771, it did not exceed L. 500 
Sterling. The coal-mines, fince 1771, have been ibarces 
id great wealth to many of the proprietors. 

Defcription of ibe Suhterramout Coal Straia.-'^The fixil 
appearance of coal on the S. W» extremity of the pariih« 
is a feam about 2 feet thick, fituated under the £arl of 
Elgin's lime-rock at Charlefiown. Northward, near broad- 
hills, there is another feam, from 4 to 6 feet thick, which 
dips very rapidly towards the N. £. the crop of which 
has been wrought by a level in the fame diredion. Ad- 
vancing flill northward, about 3 miles from the Frith, 
through a fine level country, we again find various feams 
of excellent coal in the lands of Sir Charles Halket of Pit- 
ferran, immediately above the village of Crosford. From 
a remote period, the family of PitCerran, obtained from 
Government, the privilege of exporting thefe coak to fo- 
reign parts, free of all duty whatever. The original pri- 
vilege was renewed by Queen Anne on December ai.

ling, when the property that could injure the revenue was 
nearly exhaufied. 

The mod remarkable,^ in thefe lands, are the (earns, con- 
fifting of 5 feet, 2 feet^ and 4 feet each. They are all 
found within the fpaCe of 14 yards, at the diftance of 3 
fathoms and a half from each other, and in their natural 
Hate, they dip from one foot in four, to one in fix towards 
the N. £. Immediately above the two feet feam, are the 
firata of iron-fione already mentioned. The furface being 
irregular, the pits are from 10 to 80 yards in depth. £aft- 
ward from the mines of Pitferran, are thofe of Urquhart 
and Pittencrieff, which are nearly exhanfied, untir deeper 
leveb are made or engines ereded. 

Northward from thefe are the numerous feams of coal 
that appear above each other, (as per fe£tion), fituatea un- 
der the lands of Weft and M idbalbridge, Clune, Lufcar,

Having mentioned the collieries in the northern direc* 
tion, it may be proper to return to thoft in the middle of 
the parifh. Of thefe middle, Baldridge colliery, the pro 
perty of Robert Wellwood, £fq; of Garvoch, deferves at- 
tention. It 18 in many refpeds fimilar to that of Pitten- 
crieS, and the other mines in the fame direfiion. The • 
lowed feam is a fine fplint coal. This colliery has been 
worked for many years, and been extremdy advantageous 
to the proprietor. Eafiward, in the fame line, are the 
collieries of Venterfair, Dunfermline town coal, and White- 
field. They ^re worked level free, and contain an im* 
menfe quantity of excellent coal, which is moftly fold in 
the country. The town fupplies its inhabitants with this ' 
important article at a reduced price, which makes the fuel 
cheaper than in any other town in Scotland. 

To the eaft of thefe is the colliery of Halbeaith. It 
contains £ or 9 feams of good workable coal,' amounting 
in all to upwards of 30 feet. The loweft or fplint feanx 
is the fame as in the other collieries, and is in high repute.

below the farface level, and be loft without the affiifauice 
of the engine, which wins from N. to N. ia all the feams 
to the fouth of it. 

 K a level mine were driven from the bottom of the pit, 
at H. to L. it would win the upper feams tb the north of 
it, between the levek £. JE. and H. It alfo fiiows, that 
if it were not for fuch dikes, the coal would foon run too 
deep to be raifed to any advantage. Suppofing the lowed 
lieam to be lOO fathoms deep at the north engine pit, then 
the uppermoft feam will be xoo fathoms deep at L, and 
confequently the loweft feam wiU be 2co fathoms deep at 
that point. 

The proportion will alv^ys be, according to the dip of 
the coal, and the elevation of the fiirface towards the 
north. 

The level E. E. £. would be about 40 jkthoms iron^

ted on the fouthem divifion of the parilh. 

MifceUaneaus Ob/ervations.^Tht advantages of this pa- 
rilh are various. It abounds with lime. Coal i^ compa- 
rativelj cheap. Houfe rents are moderate. There is a 
regular poft-^office, which annually brings to the revenue 
Inwards of L. 400 Sterling. There is a readj market for 
the various produdions of the land ; and tlKre are fea* 
portSy with convenient harbours, for exporting or import* 
ing hj water, all the neceflaries of lifo. 

In this, as in every other parilh, there are fome dilad* 
vantages. Owing to the numerous mines and fubterrane- 
ons levels which have lately been opened, the water is 
greatly drained from the furfisure, and in fome places it is 
foarce, and but indifierent. The roads are often in difire- 
pair. Within thefe few years, fince turnpikes were rai- 
fed, they are however greatly improved, and it is exped- 
ed they will be flill better, when the ftatute-laboor fliaU 
be paid in money, and properly expended. The removal 
of the SherifT-fubftltute from this, diflrid is another difad- 
vantage deferving attention. Being near 30 miles from 
Cupar, the inhabitants are expofed to much trouble and 
e3q;enle, before they obtain dedfions in litigated quefiions. 

Tbe language is a mixture of Scotch and Englifh* The 
voice is radfed, and the emphafis frequently laid on the 
laft word of the fentence. Many of the names of places 
are derived from the Celtic. 

There are about aoo ploughs, almoft all of the Engliih 
or lately improved kind ; about 300 carts i 8 gentlemens

wheel-carriages, 400 male-fenrants, dnd 300 female-fei 
vants emplojed in huibandrj. From 6000 to 10,000 bolls 
of barley are annuallj manafadured into fpirits, porter, 
ftrongi and fmall beer. 

In general, the people are ftrong, and abundantlj quick 
in learning mechanical employments. Many are remarluu 
bly ingenious, induftrious, and frugal. Such perlbns en« 
joy the neceflaries and comforts of life, and are happy ia 
their prefent fituation. It mud be acknowledged, that 
there are alfo many idle, fa£Uous, difcontented perfons, 
ivho are greatly divided in their political, moral, and re« 
ligious fentiments. In gratifying their aqricious humours^ 
and fupporting their refpedHve parties, they fometimes in* 
yolve themfelves in unnecefiary expenfe, and defraud their 
juft creditors* * Their expenfe in dreis, furniture, and li- 
ving, too often exceeds their income. Increafing trade»^ 
manufa£hires, and the rapid circulation of money, have 
had an unhappy influence on their morals. — ^At public 
works, nothing is required but labour. Education is too 
pften neglefted. Many cannot read. Proprietors are not 
fui&amp;ciently attentive to the inftrudion of youth, and pro- 
viding them with teachers. Many come to the pariihy 
and go from it, whofe chara^rs are never attefted* The 
profligate repair to thefe works, where they are under no 
reflraint, and their infedious example is as hurtful to the 
morals of unguarded youth, as their unfeafonable labour is 
hurtful 10 their conllitutions. Being too early removed 
from the watchful eye, and faithful admonitions of their 
parents and teachers, the young and the thoughtlels fre- 
quently become groisly ignorant, and openly profane. 
With regard to the religious fentiments of the people, it 
may be obferved, that m general, they are more mild than 
they were about the middle of this century. The rigid

in bnfineis, as well as in aU the focial, relative, and donic-

general fober, induftrious, and religious. They have juil 
views of religion and morality. All attend public wor- 
fliip, and are apparently decent and devout, excepting a

tnit this, thtt fire was tpplied to the fhmie, not by friends who wiihed 
to ftrengthen the tort, bat by enemies who wiihed to derooli(h it. (See 
EiTay on Vitrified Forts in Phil. Tranf. Ed. Vol. IT.) But by whatever 
proceis the vitrifications on other hiUs have been effedled, it appears pro- 
bable, that the vitrifications on this hill have been effe^ed, neither at 
the conftruAion nor demolition of itsfortrefs,! but at a different period. 
When that period was, it is not eafy with precifion to tell ; but furely a 
fuppofition which occupies little time, vrhere fuppofition only is to be 
had, can do no htrm. In A. D. 838, the Pldla had been finally expel« 
l^d by Kenneth II. whofe- father King Alpin, in a battle fought on a. 
plain K. W. from Dundee, they had taken prifoner, and with barbarous 
cruelty flain. Moft of the Pi^ at their expulfion fought Ipr flielter in 
Denmark, whence, it is faid, their anceftors fprung. Incited by them, 
the Danes rofe far revenge, and frequently invaded the eaftem cotft of 
Scotland. From thefe waftinjr invaders, the fortrefs on this hQl might 
afford a temporary refuge. On the £. end of it, which is moft confpi. 
cuous, fires might be kindled to alarm the more diftant parts of the coun- 
try, when thefe incurfions happened in the night ; and the frequent firet

ly, be originally fpelled Bwrgbtey^ from Borgfa, a fiecnritj, 
and Tay \ or, the fecurity of the Tay. When it was biult 
will not, perhaps, be eafily afcertained. It ctnnat be one 
of the caftella, or forts, which Tacitus, in his life of Agri- 
cola, fays that general ereded, in the third year of his ex- 
pedition, when he came to the Kftoary of the Tay ; for 
thefe forts, we are informed by Boece, in the fourth boc^ 
of his Hiftory, were ere&amp;ed not on the north, but on the 
fouth fide of the aeftuary ; not in the county of Angvis, but 
in the county of Fife. Dr Macpherfm feems to be ri^t, 
who fuppofes that the fquare towers, like Broughty, were 
built at a much later period. The earlieft mention of it 
with which I have met, is in the year 1492, when, accordimg 
to the credulous Boece, in the Delineation of the Scottilh 
Kingdom, prefixed to hi? Hiiloly, it witnefled a foolilh pro- 
digy. 

ftion, BS fomedoi whether Broughty belongs lo this paurilh. Towards the 
end of hit century, a own committed a trefpafi within the bcnuMls of 
Broughty, for which he was fommoned to appear at the tribunal of the 
Kirk-feflion. He refufed obediepce» under pretence that Broughty be- 
longed not to this parifli, hot to that of Caputh, in the neighbourhood of 
Dunkeld, about a6 miles N. W. To afcertain the Uue fituatioa of 
Broughty, the mioiiter wrote to a Mr Webfler, then its proprietor; who 
replied, that it lay neither in the pariAi of Monifieth nor of Capnth, but 
in that of Kirriemuir, about 16 miles N. On this the minifter qiplied to 
the prelbytery, who by their deed annexed Broughty and its pertinents 
for ever, quoad facra^ to the parifli of Monifieth. Had the Kirk*feiBcn 
records been fully confulted, it would have been found that Bronghty 
was already annexed, not only quoad faerat but quoad temporalia^ to tbas 
pariih ; for there it is exprefsly faid, that on December i%, 1658, Broughty 
among othen paid for the reparation of the church. It follows not in- 
deed always, that a place belongs to that pariih for the reparation of 
whofe church it pays. It feems, however, an acknowledgment of Brough- 
ty 's belonging to Monifieth pariih, that it paid for the reparation of the 
church there. For had there been any evidence that Bronghty belonged 
not to this pariih, Mr Webiler, its proprietor, when caUed on, would 
furely have been able to produce it, and not have founded his opinion 
wholly on tradition.

it€ds not unworthy to mention, and which are connefted 
ndth events that form a ftriking sera in hiftory. 

On the death of James V. of Scotland, Henry VIIL of 
England, to fave that hlood and treafure which were ex* 
pended in defence of either nation, fought to unite the two 
neighboQiing kingdoms, by the marriage of his young foft 
Edward, to Mary, the infant Queen of Scots. To thu 
mealbre^ all that nation bad fwom agreement : But, in^ 
ciced bjr Cardinal Beaton and the Queen Dowager, who 
dreaded the downfal of the Popiih religion, by an union 
with a heretical nation, they were prevailed on bafely to 
break dieir oath. To enforce acquiefcence, Henry arofe in 
his might, and at his death the caufe was efpoufed by Ed- 
ward Seymour, Duke of Somerfet, who was ele&amp;ed Pro- 
testor of the kingdom during the minority of Edward his 
nephew. Moving along, the eaftem coaft of Scotland with 
a numerous army, which was feconded by a powerful 
fleet, on Saturday, September 10. 1547, he met the 
30,000 Scots under the conduA of the Earl of Arran, Re- 
gent of the kingdom, on the weft of the river Eik, near 
Mnflelbnrgh, and difcomfited them with great daughter ; , 
but was foon after, by reafon of the advanced feafon of the 
year, and intelligence he received of defigns forming againft 
him in England, forced to return thither, without cont- 
pletely profecuting his vidory. Immediately on this his

and hold a few ^pres of a proprietor ; and the forty-two 
pottagers, who have each a bottife an4 im acre 6t two from

C!ar//r.-r-Befides a confiderable number of cattle fed on

ererj iummer in grab enclofures, and about a fifth pare of 
that number fattened hj turnips in winter. A few fheep 
paftuTie part of die links. 

Witiun the laft jO years, the agriculture of the pariih 
has been much improved. It ought not to be omitted, 
that this was entirely owing to Mr Hunter, then proprie- 
tor of Grange, a gentleman whofe name deferves to be re- 
corded. Some years before 1750, he, firft of this parifli, be- 
gan to enclofe land, and between the years 1750 and 1752, 
to ufe lime as a manure. In the year 17531 he introduced 
the culture of turnips, and in the year following, that of 
potatoes. By fallow, dung and lime he prepared his grounds 
for the crop, and he fowed them at the proper feafon with 
grals-feeds. Now had his fields begun to afiume a fairer 
furface and a taker ipaould.; but ftUl their upleafing fionrm 
Bcnsttoed. The ridges were wide at one end, narrow at 
the other, and .bent in various curvatures. They were 
foon rendered regular and. flraight. His fields lay befide 
the road to the pariih-church^ and' the pariihioners, as they

What they beheld they imitatedy and many £mb fiw widi 
fittis&amp;Abn their own fields covered with a fimilar beautj 
and fartility. The old Scotdih pkmgha were dilmifled 
apace ; and at prefent there is not one in the parifli. The 
old Scotdih plough improved, howeveti continues in ge- 
neral ofe. A^few of Small'lB newly invented make, have 
been introduced, hot are fonnd to focoeed only in lands 
that are level and £rec^£rom inc umb rance* TThcre is but 
one thrafliing machine in the parilh, nfed on die htrgeSk 
ftrm. The other fiirmers employ men to tfarafli out their 
grain, called lot-men, who generally refide in the neigh- 
bourhood, and receive as wages the twenty-fifth boD of 
grain they thrafh out, with breakfaft, and a finall allow- 
^mce for dinner. 

None can ever hope to fee the agriculture of this pa- 
riih increafed, but by a very (mall part of the links. Thej 
muft either be aUowed to remain, as at prefent, in paftnre ; 
or be planted with trees. If they were planted, the roots 
of the trees would harden the foil, and prevent the en- 
croachment of the fea. An eztenfive clump of firs plant- 
ed in the links of the neighbouring parilh of Barrie baa 
thriven well. If fome plan of this fort be not adopted, 
the period perhaps, is not diftant, when they will all be a- 
gain completely inundated. From the links between the 
light-honfe and the village of Monifieth, (a fpace of abont 
2 miles,) within the laft 40 yean, the fea has plundered up- 
wards of jo acres.

and in Dundee at i| d. the lb. Since that period, a pound

thod could be invented, bj which the porpoifes, or Gacr 
J!/b as they are called, which devour fo many (almoo, 
might be deftroyed. But it is to be confidered, that the 
fear of the porpoifes forces the Cidmon nearer to land thaa 
the J would otherwiie be willing to come. If the porpoi- 
fes were defiroyed, the ialmon would be iaCer i but the 
fiflier would catch left in his net. 

About 10 years ago, the white fiihing bn this coail be* 
gan to decline. Soon after, the haddocks, which wero 
caught in the greateft abundance, totally left the cqafi. 
While they remained, they chiefly had given conftant em- 
ployment to 3 large boats belonging to this parifh, which 
earned annually, at an average, L. zoo each. The 3 boats 
are ftill retained, aikd frequent their old fiihing grounds $ 
but as they fddom catch any other kinds of fiih than fome 
eod and ling, or when any other kinds chance to b^ 
caught, as it is in fmall quantity, they afford a very lieanty 
and precarious fubfiftence. Whether the haddocks were 
baniihed by lack of proper food, or purfued by Ibme vo- 
racious enemy, it is the left important to inquire ; as they 
have now begun, in fmall quantities, to revifit our coafls. 
A few fmaU (hell fi(h might be found within the bounds 
of this pariih, if one were at pains to gather them. LoU 
iters and crabs are caught in their greateft perfeftion on 
this coaft, in the pari(hes of Panbride and St Vigeans.

pariih, the^quantity of cloth which they weave cannot ea-

Mr Dempfter of Duimichen, fo well kaown for his pa«

watch over the ftate of the poor. Great was then the noed for 
infpefting parochial condnd. Little regard was paid to the 
Sabbaths. On thefe dajs fome were occafionally conviAed 
of having fifiied with the rod or the net. Soarcdy was there 
a Sabbaih on which fome delinquent was not juftlj and pu- 
blic! j reproved ; and it was feen neeeffary, after public 
worfhip was fini(hed, to fend a committee of the kitk* 
feilion to periuftrate the tons of the parifli. Bj degree^ 
decency and devotion began to reign. The pious exhorta- 
tions and worthj example of Mr Dempfter and his kirk- 
feflion were long remembered and imitated, after death 
had ftilled their voices, and withdrawn their prefence. At 
this day the parilhioners attend the church with the utmoft 
regularity and gravenefs of deportment \ and they are ex- 
tremely fteady in their religious principles. About two 
yrars ago, the fefts called Burgher and Antibutgher built 
each a conventicle in this vicinity ; bu^ they are thinly at- 
trended, and^iave not been able to gain over from this parifli 
more profelytes than 20, of whom 13 are Burgbeis, and 5 
Antiburghers. There are only two other frdaries in the pa- 
rifii, the one an Intiependent, and the other a Methodift. But 
the inhabitants of this parifli are not only regdar and decent 

in 



in their attendance on church, (leady in their religions princi* 
pies, but diftinguiflied for their induftrj and fobrietj. Sue-

Wheat is generally fown in September, and reaped in Sep-

Angus, paifes through the fouth fide of this pariih ; and 
there is another turnpike road in contemplation firom Perdi

KILTARLITY confifts of two united pariflics. Con- 
vent or Conveth and Kiltarlity ; but how early thefe 
^riih,es have been united, is not known. Convent or 
Conveth is a vicarage, depending on the priory of Beauly. 
Conveth, (in Gaelic Conn-Cheatbacb^ a ravenous animal), 
has, according to tradition, received its name from fome 
extraordinary reptile or ferpent, which infefted this diHrxStf 
snd had proved fatal to fome of the inhabitants, fiut from 
Jbme old records in this country, it appears, that there was 
originally a convent in this parifti, or fmall glen ; and there- 
fore it b much more probable that it got the name of Glen« 
convent, or pariih of Convent, from this circumfianoe. 
RUtarlity is a parfonage dedicated to St Thalargns. AT//, 
in Latin Cetla, originally meant the etU or place approprii-

fmall portion of ground around fuch a place of worihip^ 
which was confidered a» confecrated^ and ufcd fior barying 
thofe who died in the peace of the church, the word kit 
or cilk came in proceis of time to figniij a burial-phce, 
which is now the common meaning of the word in the Gsie- 
lic language *. 

From the various windings of the road paffing through 
Kiltarlitji this parifh, in the line of the road, b upwards 
of 40 miles long ; but in a ftraight line, it is at leaft 30 mea- 
fured miles from the N. £. to the N. W. At an average, 
it is fuppofed to be at lead 6 miles broad : thus cootaining 
x8o fquare miles, or 91,638 Scotch acres. Of this eztmty 
there maj probably be a 30th part arable, or 30547 acres, 
all under com and potatoes, excepting a few acres under tur- 
nip and fown grals. The fame number of acres, or rather 
more, may be under meadow-grais. The remainder is un- 
der wood and heath. The church and manfe are fitvated 
within three meafured miles of the eaft end of the parifli. 
£a(lward of the church, the north fide of the parilh is pret- 
ty level ; but the fouth fide is high ground, mollly covered 
with wood and heath, excepting a fmall piece of culti- 
vated ground, called Clunes, fignifying, in Gaelic, tiie 
gradual declivity of a hill, and poflefied at prefent by 
about 12 finall tenants. Clunes is near the very height 
of the ground, with a fouth expofure. To die weft 
of the manfe, the pariih is interfered by 4 fmall boms, 
which run from the S. S. W. and W. fo that this 
part of the parifii is divided into 4 different ridges v

Small fpots of cultivated ground are interfperfed through 

the birch wood, which forms a beautiful landlcape. In this

It is about a ihile and a half long, and near a mile broad. 
Four different kinds of black trout are found in it. It alfo

Birdst BeaJii.^^Vf€ have all the land birds that are ia 
the neighbouring pariib of Kirkhill, and which have been 
formerly defcribed, only this parifli abounds much moie 
with moor fowl and black game than IPrkhilL We have 
alfe fome ptarmagans, though not in fnch numbers as they 
are to be found on the tops, of the high moontains in the 
neighbouring parifh of Kilmoracltu In die higher parts of 
this parifli a great number of ravens neftle among the rodcs. 
The large blue hawk, about the fize of a common hen, 
nettles in the rocks of Mayne. This b one of the moft raven- 
ous^birds in this country : though not fo ftrong as the eagle, 
it is much more fierce and agile } and when the eagle and 
this bird fight, the former is commonly worfted. We have 
alfo two different fpecies of glede, or kite, which breed in 
this parifli. The caperkaily, or king of the wood, faid to 
be a fpecies of wild tux^ey, was formerly a native of this 
parifli, and bred in the woods of Strath-glais : one €if thefe 
birds was killed about 50 or 66 years ago, in the church- 
yard of Kiltarlity.

Of wild animals, hares are very numerous, 6wing to 
the abnndiuiGe of cover they have among the wooers, and in 
the broom, with which ihrabs the lower end of ihis pariib 
aboonds. We have aifo many foxes, otters, and polecats; 
fome mountain hares, and a few wild cats ; the lafi are not 
fo numerous now as formerly. The number of blac^ cattle 
in thefe united parifltes may be about 3016. Thty are o£ 
various fizes, but in general fomewhat larj^er than the old 
highland breed. Some of the proprietors, and a gentleman 
£u-mer, have for fome years pafi greatly improved their 
breed of cattle. Major Frafer of Belladrum is fuppofed to 
have the beft breed of cows in this country } though not 
quite fo large as the Fifeihire cattle, they are much hardier 
aadhandibmer ; and when fold, commonly fetch from L. 6 
to L. 9 Sterling each cow. The number of iheep may 
be about s%%6. About aoo of thefe are of an excellent 
breed from £ngland; 400 or 500 more are confidcrably 
larger than the common breed of this country : the reft are 
of the old Scotch fliccp, fmall fized, with ibort wool. The 
number of goats is about 429. There were formerly many 
more flieep and goats in this parifli than at prefent. Since 
the gentlemen have begun to endofe their grounds and to 
plant, iheep and goa^ have in a great meafure been baniih* 
ed from the lower end of the parifb* There may be about 
719 horiies of difierent fizes, but in general they are fmalL

having a tafie for improvement, employ a number dfidii(^« 
labourers throughout the year, who crowd in to us from 
the neighbouring parifhes *. 

Proprietors and J2M/.-*There are 6 proprietors, and x 
viradfetter, 4 of whom refide conftantly, the other two oc- 
cafionally in the pariib. The valued rent of the parifh is 
L. i455f 15 s. Scots. The real rent may be about L. aaoo 
Sterling. The rent of land is various, from 5 s. to ao s. 
the acre.

fbunfas of the year. There is alfo fome flax nufed by the 
. fitf mers for their own uCe. Major Frafer of Belladmm, 
one of the proprieteis, has commonly upwards of an acre 
of \ ground annually under flax. This gentleman, by his 
fiiperior fluU in farming, his tafle for improvements of ▼»- 
rious kbds, and his indefatigable adivity and induftry, has 
perhaps done more than mofi gentlemen in the N. to intro- 
dnce a fpirit of improvement and induftry into this part of the 
country. By various iniprovements, he has confidcrafaly rai* 
fed the value of his lands, which originally were but a poor 
fttbjed. He has aifo upon his eftate valuable plaatatioas 
of foreft trees of aU kinds, oak, alb, elm, beech, plane, 
poplars of various kinds, mountain afli, fome mapk and 
fervice trees ; alfo laryx,. fpruce, filver fir, New England 
pine, and the common Scotch fir, befides a number of o-

The pariih does not produce as mnch grain of every* 
kindy as is fufficient for the maintenance of the inhabitants. 
The common tenants make nfe of the old Scotch plongh, 
fome of them ufe it upon an improved plan. The gen« 
tlemen make ufe of the Englifli and ^ord Karnes's plongh 
with a chain. The number of ploughs in the whole pa« 
riih maj be about 214. Mnch le6 than half this number 
would be fufficient to turn up all our arable ground, were 
the J properly employed. There are 376 carts, 40 coups 
or fioaall waggons, and 361 fledges employed in the pariSi. 
About 50 years ago, there was not a wheel-carriage of 
any kitfd in the whole pariih, Lord Lovat's coach except- 
ed. At this period, even iht gentlemen employed, only 
fledges, in carrying home their peats, and in the other bu- 
finefs of the farm. What manure was ufed was carried 
to their fields in ieaUachs^ a creel in the form of a cone, 
with the bafe turned upwards, placed upon a fledge. Ma» 
ny of thefe keallachs are flill ufed in the heights of the 
parifli. There is a confiderable number of fruit trees in 
this parifli, which, with favourable feafons, are perhaps as 
produdSve, as in any part of thb north country. 

The principal proprietors have very good gardens. Lo- 
vat's principal garden mecdures about feven Scotch acres- 
It is fenced with a wall 18 feet high lined with brick. 
The wall is contrived to have a great variety of curves, fo 

as 

Flax, from the middle. of April to the bcglooiog of Mtf . Tnriiip, froa 
the middle of Jooe to the middle of July, and a fiaiaU quantitj of wheat 
is fown from the ipth October to the loth of November. 

Harveft feldom begins before the month of September, and is general!; 
finilhed before the end of Odiober. In the heights of the parifli, our har- 
veils were formerly very late and precarious ; but fince the year I7t5t 
early oats have been introdnced into the higher parts of the parifli* which 
has been of infinite fervice to the inhabitants, as their hanrcft is now 
almoft as early as in the low grounds, and coniequeotlj not fo precarious

as to catch the heat of the fan in everj direfilon. Throagfa 
the middle of the garden rant a fine clear ftream, which 
formerly had two Chineie bridges over it, and was reple- 
niihed with fi(h. There is alfo a verj large hot-hoofir. 
Bttt the ri valet pafling throagh the garden, and the hot- 
hottfe, have been oot of repair for Ibme jean paft. The 
wall of the garden, from its various curvatures, meaiures 
upwards of 800 yards, fo that with favourable ieafons, a 
confiderable quantity of fine fruit is produced on wall- 
trees. There are befides a great number of good 
ftandard trees in this garden. On two ftandard apple-trees 
here, mifletoe grows, which is a very rare plant in this 
country. In our meadows and woods are produced almoft 
all the plants found in the lower parts of Scotland, and 
there is (Scarcely an Alpine plant that is a native of this 
ifland, but is to be found in fome of our high hills, or among 
our rugged rocks. 

Cburcif Stipend^ ScbooJ, Poor. — ^The fituation of the pre- 
ient church is called, '' Tom na Croifle," or « The hiUock 
** of the Crofs -" about ^ of an acre are enclofed round the 
church. This piece of ground has been planted by order 
of the late General Frafcr with Scotch firs, interfperfed 
with a few oaks, elms, and beeches. Thefe trees have 
now almoft eclipfed the church. Thus we worihip God 
in a grove. The patron is Frafer of Lovat. The living 
confifts of 48 bolls I firlot and i peck of barley, L. 317, 
^d. Scots, of money. The vicarage and gra&amp;money, b/ 
• compofition of the prefent incumbent's predeceflbr in of- 
fice, is L. 39 : 19 : 5 Sterling. The glebe is rather larger 
than the ordinary glebes in this country, but the foil is 
very thin and poor.— The emoluments of the parochial 
fchool are 18 bolb i firlot and 1 pecks of barley, x s. the 
quarter for every fcbokr taught to read, zs. 6 d. the quar-

There ia no fond for the poor of this pariOi, but the week* 
\j coUeAions, the hire of a mort-clotb, the rents of a few 
feats in church, and fines for immoralities ; which maj 
amount to L.9 or L. 10 Sterling yearly. The number of 
poor on the roll is 45. The greater part of thofe on the 
xoU can partly provide forHhemielves by their own labour; 
few of them beg from door to door. In the heights of 
this parifh, and that of Rilmorack, a miflionary paid by the 
Royal bounty officiates ; t\e has 4 different places of preach* 
ingt fame of them at a confiderable diilance from each 
ether, fo that this is a laborious charge f. 

Language- 

* No Latin or Greek it taught here, the {choolmafter being incapable 
of teaching thefe languages, which is a difadvantage to fomc of the inha- 
bitants. As ieflion-clerk and precentor, the ITchoolmafter receives L. I» 
13 s. 4 d. Sterling out of the feffion-bcs, befides i s. for every marriage^ 
and 6 d. for every baptifm. Two young inen are prefently employed by 
the Strath-glafs tenants, to teach their children to read and write. Appli- 
cation is jttft now made by the Prelbytery of Invemefi to the Hononrabte 
Society for Propagating GhriiUan Knowledge, Sec. and reqaefting fooe 
encouragement to a fchoolmafter in this diftriA. From the great extent 
of this parifh, at lead two Society fchools would be abfolutely neceflary 
to accommodate the inhabitants.

iMraoch of the xiver, near the eaftem eztremit j of the ifland, 
ftinds the faw-milly in a hollow, eztremelj well flieltered 
on all fides by the forrounding hills and rocks. The mill 
confifts of three fliades, the length of the whole three is abo^t 
126 feet. In thele (hades 7 fiiws are moved by 4 different 
wheels ; the wheels are about 4 feet deep, and % feet 8 
inches in breadth. Above the mill is a natural fall of about 
6 feet, and a firong artificial dam, of a feet high, is raifed 
above -this fall. Thus, from having the command of a 
great body of water all the year round, with a confiderable 
fell, the wheels go with amazing rapidity. They turn 
firom 80 to 90 times in a minute, and when the faws are 
in good order, they eafily cut through a log of 10 or even 
I a feet long in 4 minutes. This manufedure has been 
carried on from the year 1765. The prefent manufadurer 
pays to Chifliolm for his wood from L. 250 to L.3C* 
Sterling a-year. The greateft part of the timber manufac- 
tured grows in the neighbouring pariih of Kilmorack* 
The trees, when cut, are from half a mile to a miles frook 
water ; and after being cut into logs of xo or la feet long, 
they are carried by horfes to the water edge, and af^r- 
wards floated on the riven Glais, Cannich, and Beauly^ 
from 30 to 40 miles, before they come to the faw-milL 
As there is a confiderable fall about 2 or 3 miles below 
the mill^ the manufadurer is obliged to carry all his planks 
and deals from the mill, three miles by land. They are 
afterwards floated in rafts, 4 miles ferther down the Beauly, 
and lodged in a wood-yard at Lovat, in the pariih of Kirk- 
hill ; and as veflels from 50 to 90 tons burthen can, by the

is a yellow deal, the moft doraUe perhaps in Scotland. 

jiiUiguiiies.^^ There are 6 dmidical temples, wirhia 
a mile of the prefent church, one of them in the pre* 
lent church yard. I have obfenred, that fiich of tliefe 
temples as are entire in this pariifa, confift of two ood- 
centric circles, the external circle is from 74 to 64 yards 
in circumference, and uniformly confifts of 9 large ftones. 
Four of thefe ftones, placed to the W. S. W. and N. 
W. are always confiderably larger than the odier 5, be- 
ing from 5 to 6 feet 4 inches high, and broad in propor- 
tion, while the other 5 do not exceed 4 fieet in height ; and 
the iaid 4 ftones are always 3 or 4 £eet farther diftant 
from each other than the other 5. The inner circle is ge« 
nerally about xo or xx feet diftant from the outer one, and 
confifts of a number of fmaller ftones, placed near each other 
firom 18 inches to a feet high ; the area of the inner cirde 
is fometimes filled up with a heap of fmall ftones. Tw« 
difierent places in the parifti are named af^ thefe circles, 
viz. Bal na Carrachan, the town of the circles, and Blar 
na Carrachan, the moor of the circles. A fmall fiu-mer 
village, near the church, is called Arddruighnich, or the 
high place of the Druids *. 

A 

♦ A Vitrffitd F«rf.«*About 2 milea K. W. of the charcb* by the hAc 
of the Bcaulj, is a Yitri^ fort, ciUed Duii.Thi6on» or Fingal's Fort. 
It if fitnated on the top of a conical hill, only acceifible on the call fide. 
The wall of this fort is a complete circle, aboat 60 yards in circomfe- 
rence. The wall is only vifible above the far&amp;ce of the ground ; but the 
fubftance of which it is fenned, both above the forface, and for a or 3 feet 
below the lame, is completely vitrified. Mr Williams, the engineer, is 
the only one who feems to have given a rational account of the manner 
of conttniAing thefe forts. That they are artificial works, intended for 
defence, andnotvolcaaicprodttdions^ is evident at firft view} and thu

A WtHtb Tower. — Aboat % miles due eaft from the 
churcbt is fitoated Caftle Sp/miie, in Gaelic^ Caftall Spu- 
)nnidh, or Foitreifl of the Spoil or Prey. The wall of 
this building is a complete cirde, whofe circumference is 
about 54 yards. It b 9 or zo feet thick, built of dry 
fione without cement. It ftands on the fummit of a hill, 
which is about 700 or 800 feet, above the plain below, 
commanding a moft extenfive profped to the N. N. W. 
and N. E. From this caftle, Dun«Thionn to the W. *, and 
Knockfuril, in Strathpificri to the N. are clearly feen *. 

Beaufortt — ^The prefent feat of the family of Lovat was 
originally a fortrels, as the name denotes. Scarcely a vef- 
tige of this ancient building now remains. The prefent 
houfe is built on a part of the ground, originally occupied 
by the (aid fort. From its fituation, it muft have been of 
old a place of confiderable firength. It lies about a mile 
; to the north of the church, on a beautiful eminence, near 
; the river Beauly ; it is defended on the N. W. N. and 

, the vitrificttiom is not accidental, as Mr Tytler fuppofes, is abandantlj 
clear frooi this rtry rcaibn, that no fucb accidents^ as he fuppofes* 

' were adequate aniformly to produce fuch effe^. There is an old record 
in Ouiirobbin in Sutherland, which perhaps throws fome light on this 
fufajedl. U is mentioued in the faid record, that a firanger, who came 
to Sutherland from the South, had ditcovered an excellent . cement for 
ftrong buildings. That this cement confifted of iron-ltone, or ore, part- 
ly mixed With other ftooes, (probably the pudding-ftone mentioned bj 
Mr Williams), and cemented together, or nitrified by the force of fire, 
prot^ably applied in the manner defcribed by the forefiud Mr Wil- 
liams. 

^ Within a gnnihot to the north of the church, is a flone coffin, in 
Gaelic, called Uamh GilUchuinne ; or grave of Giltichuinne ; onAy the 
fides of the coffin now remain. Two urns, filled with alhe», were found 
in this coffin in 17^3. Who this Oiilichuinne was, even tradition doet

Mifcelkmeous Obfervations. — ^The people, In general, are 
fober and induftrious, humane, generous and hofpitable, 
and ieemingly contented with their fituation ; but I am 
perfuaded, the number of diftiUeries in this and the neigh- 
bouring pariihes, have been rather prejudicial to the health, 
morals and induftry of fome of the inhabitants. Here, it 
is common for five or fix, and femetimes more poor peo- 
pie, to have different (hares in one difUUery ; and wbOe 
their profits by this manufa6hire are very &amp;nall, thu 
prafiice has introduced a habit of .drinking in thefe diftiOe- 
ries, and has rendered fuch of the people as are engaged in 
this bufinels, indolent and ina&amp;ive, never inclining to ap- 
ply vigoroufly to any other buiinels. There are alfo ao 
leis than 8 dram-houfes in the parifii, where fpirits are ibid 
at a low price, which muft alfo be unfriendly to the morals 
of the inhabitants ; half the faid number would be fiiUj 
fufficient to accommodate travellers. — ^There ave feveral 
mofles of confiderable extent in die parifli ; thofe who Eve 
clofe to thefe moflfes are well fupplied in peats, but manj 
of the inhabitants are at the difiance of 3 or 4 miles from 
thefe mofles \ the acceis to them is alfo very bad. Thus, 
a great part of the fommer is employed in cutting, dryiag 
and carrying home fuel, to the great difad vantage of the &amp;r-

(County or Perth, Synod of Pjerth and Stirling, 
 Presbytery of Dunkeld.) 



By the Rev. Mr J. P. Bannerman.</head> 



<p>Name^ Extent f Surface, Soil and Climate. 

/^ ARGILL, like mod places in the neighbourhood, takes 
^^ its name from the Celtic language, Caer, fignifjing 
a village, and Cill, a place of worihip, or burial. It was 
formerly called the JVeJl Parijb, and is faid to have been 
only a part of the pari(h of Cupar of Angus, but has 
long fince been disjoined from that, and ereded into a di« 
flind parochial difirid. Bifliop Spottifwood mentions, that 
as fiurback as the year 15 14, Andrew Stuart, brother to 
John Earl of Athole, got the benefices of Cargill and Ay** 
lith. It lies about 9 miles from Perth, and 4 from Cupar 
of Angus, making part of that extenfive plain called Strath- 
more. Itjeztends from W. to £. about 6 miles in length, 
and from N. to S. about 4, on an average, in breadth, 
forming nearly an oblong fquare. This pariih exhibits a 
Vol. XIII, 3 X furface 



5 30 Stati/lkal Ac^wtnt 

furface diverfified by wood and water, and variegated hj 
afcents and declivities. Rifing gradually tn the fenn of a 
ridge for about a mile from the river Tay, which bomids 
it on the N. it reaches a plain of near % miles in breadth, 
which, with fome unevenneiTes, it prefenres till it conoes to 
the Sidla hills, which boimd it onihe S. Elxcepting the wood- 
lands, it is moftly all arable \ and if improvements go on 
as they are doing at prefent, it will be foon all under cul- 
tivation, .and laid out in regular endofives. The ibii is ex- 
tremely various and different. In the lower part of the 
parifli, along the banks of the river, it is a wet mortary 
clay, which produces ftrong crops ; inclining as you rife in 
elevation to a rock nuul, which is cold and vnprodufiive. 
The level grounds on the top of the ridge are partiy loamy 
and partly moorifli. Towards the foot of the hiUs the fHl 
b a light dry gravel. 

The air is extremely pure and falubrious. Owing to 
the rapid courfe of the river, the high elevation and va- 
ried pofition of the grounds, it has at all times a free and 
ftrong circulation, and is hurt by none of thofe noxious 
damps, which prove fo detrimental in low lying grounds. 
Accordingly the inhabitants are in general ftout and 
healthy, and many of them live to a very advanced old age. 
Not to mention many who are upwards of 80, it is wor- 
thy of remark, that the late Dnchefi of Perth lived here 
withqut an ailment, to her 90th year ; and there is now 
reiiding in the pariih a Lady of Quality bom in the laft 
century, who has ftill the entire nfe of all het facullies, 
enjoys life as much as Ihe did at 20 ; and to the wifSom 
of age, adds all the chearfulneis, and much of the gaiety 
of youth. If there be any particular difeafes more preva- 
lent in this parifli than others, it is the confumption and 
rheumatifm ; and thefe are probably owing to the feden- 
tary life of many of the inhabitants, who are weavers, and

are- Imt badly bdged, and ftiU worfe provided with fuel. 
It is not Imown that^tbis pariih wao ever viiited with any 
epidemical difteoiper. The prqudioe againft inoculadon 
is worn off; and it is now pradifed wich the happieft 
effeas. 

Rhersi WcfidSf Biiii^^Tht river Tay forms the N. W. 
boondaiy of this parifh, and abounds with ialxnon, trout, 
and pike. Its courfe is here all along ikirted with yoods, 
its banks are fleep, its current rapid, and its channel rocky; 
nor. is it any where elfe fo well calculated to afford the 
diverfion of angling for faluMm. Near the W. end of 
the pacifh, this river forms what is caUed the Linn of 
Gampiey, by falling over a rugged bafiiltic dike, which 
crofl^ the water at. this place, and is found to extend in a 
right line many miles to the N. and S« of the Tay. At 
the diftance of ao mites, Dmmmond caftle ftand^ on a fi- 
milar rock, which is. fiippofed to be a continuation of the 
fame range. Hie moft romantick and magnificent views 
on the Tay are in this pariih. About half a mile above 
the village of Gargill, the river Ik runs into the Tay. It 
18 a flow running river, and abounds alfo with ialmon, 
though of a fize inferior to thofe of the Tay. Salmon 
caugbt in the Tay here, at an average, weigh 20 lb : Ila 
falmon only 10 lb. It is reckoned that the fize of falmon 
bears a proportion to the fize of the rivers in which they 
are bred. The fifheries of this pariih are of confiderable 
value, and are moftly all held in leafe by a Company in 
Perth, who preferve the falmou in, ice, and fend them freih 
to the London market ; few of them are fold in this coun- 
try during the fpring ieafon ; and even in fummer, when 
they are moil plenty, never under 4 d. the lb. It is ob« 
ferved by old fiftiermen, that there b not now x fiih in the 
river here for xo that were in it jo years ago ; but this ' 
2 fcarcity 



532 Statiflicdl Account 

fcardty is probably not owing to fewer fiih being fpawa- 
ed in the river, but to the many fiihings carried on in the 
lower parts of the Tay now, where formerly there were 
none *• 

There are 3 ferries in this parifliy 2 over the Ti^y, and 
I over the Ila ; but it b in contemplation by the gentle- 
men of the county to build a bridge over the Da, near 
the confluence of the rivers, which will fuperfede the ne- 
ceflity bf the Ferry there, and prove highly beneficial to 
the country at large. The ferries are put under excellent 
regulations, the fare paid at them is nioderate, and the 
paflage fafe and commodious. 

In former times, the parilh of Cargill abounded with 
wood much more than it does at prefent. The Shortwood- 
(haw is mentioned by Blind Harry, in his life of Wallace, 
as an immenfe woody faftnels, remarkable for being the 
fcene of many of that great warrior's achievements. For 
though there be only a few fcattered trees remaining there 
now ; yet in this place, owing to the extent of the woods, 
Wallace is faid to have eluded the fearch of a thoufand of 
his enemies. There are at prefent about 400 acres of 
planted wood, moftly Scotch firs ; and upwards of xoo acres 
of coppice, or natural woods, conGfting chiefly of birch 
and oak. There are no hills of any note in this parifli, 
excepting the Round Law and King's Seat, the laft of 

which 

* Befides falmon, the riTen in this parilh produce ftlTo a number of 
horfe or pen 1 mulTcls. About ao years ago, there w»s a great demand 
for pearU, and many people here were occupied in fiftiirg for them; 
confiderable numbers were caught, for which there wis a readj market, 
and good price. The demand however ceafing, this fpecies of fishing has 
been dropped for fome time. There b now in the cuftody of the Ho- 
nourable Mrs Dniinmond of Perth, a pearl necklace, which has been in 
the poflcflion of the 'ladies of that noble family for fcveral generations, 
the pearls of which were found here in the Tay, and for fize andlhape 
Ijrc not to be equalled by any thing of the kind in Britaia.

Minerals. — There is no marble nor flate here ; but fe- 
deral quarries of freeftone of an excellent quality, and good 
colour, have been wrought to a confiderable extent. Lime- 
ilone alfo is to be found, and might, it is faid^ be wrought 
to great advantage. Thofe who have tried it aflert, that 
after counting all expenfes of quarrying and burning the 
(tones, they have the lime much cheaper than what it 
cofts them at Perth. It is a pity that a proper experiment 
was not made to afcertain this, becau(e even on the fup- 
poiition of its being as dear, yet tHe faving of fuch a 
long carriage would be an aftonilhing advantage to the 
country at large, and to the proprietors of the limeflone 
in particular. Rock marl, of a reddifli colour, is found 
here in great abundance. Little ufe has hitherto been 
made of it as a manure; but it is thought that it would 
be of fervice to the light moorilh grounds in the upp^r* 
part of the pariih •• 

Antiquities^ 

* About 30 yearf ago, an ineffcdual fcarch was made after coals near 
the village of Whttefield in this pariih. The trial however, by aU ac- 
counts, was not carried on with that ardour, nor continued with that 
perfeverance as to be deemed fatisfadlory. The expenfe of it was de- 
frayed by public contribution, and when the money failed, the fearch' 
was abruptly given over, leaving as ilrong an iir.prcffion on the minds of 
the people in the country, that there are ftill coals there, as before the 
trial was made. As people (killed in thefe matters allow that this place 
has every appearance of having coal, it is to be hoped that a public fpi- 
rited Company, who are offering terms to the proprieton here for a leafe 
of their mines and minerals, in order to make a thorough fearch tor coaIs» 
will fucceed in their endeavours to ^ifcover an article fo very dear, ani 
fo much wanted in this part of the country.

guard it on all other fides where it was any how aocefiible. 
The foSm are perfedly difcemible, and the aquednd hj 
which they were filled from a neighbouring rivulet, is fiill 
in high prefervation ; but the fite of this encampment is 
now converted into a com field— jCf Jifes e/l M VCrqfa

feet broad, and compofed of rough round flones nxdel j laii 
together, can be plainly traced from Inncrpcffiry, tiirough 
the parifli of Galk, (where there is a camp), to Duplia 
Parks : from thence to Bertha few veftiges of it can be 
difcovered. About a quarter of a mile above Bertha, 
(which feems to have been a Roman ftation from the num- 
ber of urns that have been difcovered there}, a ridge ot 
ftones which extend far into the river, and a great number 
of large oak-trees which have been dug up there, and 
many of which fiill remain in the water, give ilrong ap- 
pearances of a military Roman bridge over the Tay there. 
From thence the road is to be traced to Rome, (which pro- 
bably got its name at that time), paft Sherifftown and In- 
nerbuift, where there is a large camp and feveral tumdi, 
through the parifli rf St Martin's to Byres, keeping the 
ridge of the hill through the eftate of Stobhall, and paffing 
near Gallowhill, where it is very difcernible, it bends its 
courfe to the Ila at Windyedge, where the remains of an- 
other military bridge are difiindly to be traced, and the 
houfes adjacent to which (llll go by the name of Bridgend. 
This bridge feems to have communicated with differeat 
Roman (lations, which are to be feen in different places on 
the extenfive plain on the other fide of the river towards 
Blairgowrie, where the Romans, as Boethius informs ns, 
fought a bloody battle with the united armies of the Cale- 
donians and Pifts. When this military road was made is 
uncertain ; probably by the army at Ardoch, to prefcnre a 
communication between their different camps, and as con- 
venient for their after marches had 'they conquered the

Caat-ridifigt which feems worthy of obfervation. The lands 
of Cargill were formerly fo verj much overrun by a 
"Weed with a yellow flower that grows among the coms^ 
•fpecially in wet feafons, called Gool^ and which had the 
moft pemidoiu efifeds, not only upon the corns while 
growing, but alfo in preventing their winning after cut 
down, that it was found abfoluteiy necefiary to adopt fome 
cffedual method of extirpating it altogether. Accordingly, 
after allowing a reafonable time for procuring clean feed 
from other quart/ers, an ad. of the baron*court was pafled, 
cnfordog an old a£t of Parliament to the fame effed *, im- 
pofing a fine of 3 s. 4 d. or a wedder iheep, on the tenants, 
for every fiock of gool that ihould be found growing among 
their corns at a particular day, and certain perfons, ftyled 
,£Ooi-ridtrif were appointed to ride through the fields, fearch 
for gooly and carry the law into execution when they dif- 
covered it. Though the fine of a wedder iheep, originally 
impo&amp;d for every ftock of gool found growing in the ba« 
rony, is now commuted and reduced to z d* Sterling, the 
pndice of gool-riding is ftill kept up, and the fine rigidly 
exaded. The effeds of this baropial regulation have been 
ialntary, beyond what could have been well expeded. 
Five ftocks of gool were formerly faid to grow for every 
ftock of com through all the lands of the barony, and 20

Near the village of Gallowhill is a field called the GaUowlhade, which

coofiderable quantity, and are uled as food by the poorer 
kind of the inhabitants. Of late years aUb» the culture 
of liaz has been mnch attended to, and the returns it makes 
have encouraged the frrmer to fow mnch more of it than 
formedy. The modes of cultivation are fo Tarious, that it is 
dificttk to pre any accurate idea of the average quantity o 
land employed in any particular crop, or to afcertaih the 
amennt of the produce. The tenants, too, are averfe from 
difidofing the returns made to them. It is fuffident, there-

gill, which conftitute three-fourths of the parifh, were un- 
der the direftion of the Commiflioners for managing the 
aonewd eftates, the lands were rented at fo low a race as 
to afford no fpur to induftry, or excitement to exertioii. 
If the farmer could pay his rent, and live like his neigh- 
bour, by following the old mode of buibandry, his ambition 
feldom carried him farther. Since the efiate was redored 
to the prefent proprietor, the rents have been ratfed ; a

xnarli all our improvements are carried ni by lime bronglit 
from Perth, diflant about 9 miles. The foil is fo difierent 
in different places of the parifli, that no ftated rotncioi&amp; of 
cropping is oniverfallj purfued. White and green crops 
. alternately fcem beft calculated for cleaning and enricbing 
grounds fo &amp;r removed from the means of artificial manure 
as this parifh is. Some, accordingly, have divided dieir 
farms, after they have got them all thoroughly fidlowcd 
and limed, into four parts ; fowing one-fourth with peafe, 
potatoe, and turnip, to which they give all their dang; 
this crop is followed next year by barley, or wheat, if the 
feafon anfwers, and is laid down with grais-iieeds ; next 
year it is grafs, cut green for feeding cattle in the honfe, or 
made into hay for private copfumption, or public iale; 
this fourth is broke up next year, and never fiuls to yield 
an excellrnt crop of oats. Thb rotation excludes paftonq, 
but it abundantly compenfates for the want of it by the 
turnips in winter, and the great quantity of fown grais in 
fummer. The turnip, and every other fpecies of drill huf- 
bandry, begins to prevail here, and the good effeds of fown 
gralTes are well underftood. An attempt was lately made, 
v^ith much probability of fuccefs, of rearing cattle in the 
houfe on green cut clover in fummer, and on turnips in 
winter. The quantity of dung raifed by this method of 
feeding is aftoniihing, and the cattle attain the fame fize, 
and bring the fame price at 3 years of age that they for- 
merly did at four. The farms in this parifli are very un- 
equal, both as to fize and rent. We have fome large farms

expire, to convert feveral fmall farms into one large one. 
A third part, at leaft, of all the grounds in the pariih are 
cndoled, and the advantages of enclofures, where the 
grounds can be watered, are univerfallj acknowledged. 
Hedge and ditch are generally made ufe of, though (lone 
fences are found to be the only fubfiantial enclofure. 
Ploughibig here is performed altogether by horfes ; light 
two-horfe ploughs, with iron heads, and call mould- boards, 
prevail univerfedly -, and carts drawn by two horfes are gi- 
ying p}9ce to thofe drawn by one. Few black cattle are 
reared in the pariih ; and no flieep are bred, except for £au 
mily ufe, but the farqiers generally breed what horfes they 
have occafion for. The inilruments employed in hufbandry 
have been much improved of late, the farmers being ready 
to copy after the mod approved models. Few cottagers 
are employed ; the labour is moftly carried on by fervants 
living in the farmer's houfe, who are looked upon as lels 
expenfive and more dtfintereflcd than thofe who have fa- 
milies of their own. There are 144 ploughs in the parilh, 
and a proportional number of carts. W^eat is fown gene-

Population^^Kccot&amp;ng to Dr Webfter's report, the nuni« 
1er of fouls in 1755^ was i897.^-«The population in thb 
ptxiSti has dccreafed of late years, owing to the praftice of 
converting feveral fmall farms into one lurge one, and the 
abolition of pendicles and cottagers. In the year 1784^ 
when the prefent incumbent entered on his office, the 
number of pariihioners on an exad furvey, was found to 
amount to 1850. By an accurate enumeration of the in*" 
habitants made in February 1793* there were then in the 
parifli of Cargill, 376 families, containing 1720 fonb. Of 
thefe, the males bear a near proportion to the females. 
The annual average of births for 10 yean preceding X79I9 
is 45; of marriages, 8; and of deaths, 17. As fome of 
the people, and particularly Diffimters, are remifs in regi- 
ftering the births of their children, to evade the duty on bap- 
tifm ; and others get them regidered in the pariflies where 
Aey happen tq be fituated nearer, the information on this 
fttbjeft cannot be perfedly accurate. The number of deaths 
alfo is no le£i dtfficnlt to be ascertained, becanfe many of 
the parifliionersbury in other pariflies, and fome from other

ned by a committee of Pre&amp;ytery. At laft vifitation, tliere

the year 1787, by the tenants in the weft end of the pa- 
rifh, for the benefit of their children, on account of their 
^reat diftance from the parifli-fchooL The fchoolmafter 
has a free houfe, but no fixed falary. His emoluments, 
therefore, depending on the number of his fcholars, and di« 
ligence and fiicceis in teaching, prove happy excitements

^}^t to an aft of the Juflices of Peace for the fliin of Perth 
in 1775/ notification is made here on the two Snndajs im- 
mediatelj preceding the day of meeting, from the reader's 
de(k, to the heritors, mintfier and elders of the parifli, to 
meet on the iirfi Moodaj of January, and £rft Monday of 
July, half-yearly, in order to make op a lift of our poor, 
and provide for their maintenance. At this meeting, af- 
ter eleding a prefes and clerk, the heritors, minifter and 
ciders prefent, proceed to make up a lift or roll of all the 
poor, young and old, which have either heen bom in the 
pariih, or have had their refidence in it for the laft 3 years. 
The meeting then compute and eftimate what fum may be 
necefTary for the maintenance of each poor perfoo, whofe 
name is entered on faid lift, according to their different ne« 
ceiTities, till the next half-yearly meeting, and then fam 
up the quota, which fhall be found neceflary £ar the 
maintenance of the whole for the current half year. 
The meeting proceed to alTeis the one half of this fum 
upon the heritors of the parifli, according to the va« 
luation of their refpcftive lands within the parifli, and 
the other is colleAed from the parifliionexs, accord- 
ing to their circumftancts, and then appoint a colleAor 
to levy faid proportions. The other fhnds for the fnpport 
of the poor, arife from the contributions at the church on

nient, is from is. 6d. to 73. 6d. according to the. differ- 
ent necei&amp;ties of the poor. None are permitted to beg« 
In appointing the different quotas the poor fhall receive, 
care is taken not to encourage idleneis, and no more is 
given to the neceflitous, than what, with the exertion of 
their own induftry, will fupport them. But fo high is the 
fpirit of independence, that it is looked upon as difgraceful 
to receive charity from the parifli, and none will fubmic 
to it till they are necefBtated by diftrels. The number of 
Aated poor on the roll at prefent, is more than double of 
what it was ao years ago.. As the crop of the year 1782 
proved very unprodudive, more poor received fupplies 
than ufual ; and the aflelfments, by confequence, were high- 
er. Our colle£tions at church are now double what they 
were 20 years fince. Se&amp;arifts contribute nothing to the 
maintenance of the poor on the parilh lift ; indeed they are 
generally the po- relt themfelves -, but the charity ot the 
parifh is not confined to thofe of the Eflablilhed Church. 
The effe£b belonging to thofe on the poors lift, are, at 
their death, fold by the fefllon, as belonging to the pa« 
jriih. 

CbaraBer of tbe People. — The people are generally fo- 
ber, honeft and induftrious, pundual in their attendance 
on religious ordinances, and more knowing in general than 
what might be conceived. Their manner oi living and 
drefs is much altered and improved of late years \ and to 
their credit, it may be added, that none of them have been

not more diftinguiihed by their high ftations, than by their 
perfonal merit ; among a variety of thefe which might be 
j^ecifiedy the brevity of thb iketch permits only one to be 
mentioned-— An&amp;abella Drummond, daughter of Sir John 
Drummond and Lady Mary Montefix. She was a Lady 
of the moft ezquifite beauty and diftinguiihed accomplifh-

King of Scotland, and crowned at Scone with him in the

jidvantages and Bif advantages * — Our diftance from mar-

of land carriage on that and every other commodity, to- 
gether with the badnefs of our roads, check the rifing fpi- 
rit of agriculture, and retard the progrefs of improvements 
in this parilh. The want of fuel alfo, is another great dif- 
advantage under which this place labours, being 30 miles 
from the neareft coal-pit, and 9 miles from the port of 
Perth. The (hortnefs of the leafes here alfo, in an impro- 
ving cocuitry, where fo much remains to be done, affords 
neither time for extenfive improvements, nor encourage- 
ment for expenfive operations. Thefe natural difadvan- 
tages are fomewhat counterbalanced by a grateful foil, and 
temperate climate, which raifes good grain, and ripens it» 
were proper encouragement allowed for improvements, 
and longer leafes granted, upon progreilive rifes of rent. 
The abolition of all fervices, and not being aftrifted to any

Long Lea/es. — The greater part of the people of Locbcat- 
TOO have lately got leafes for 35 years. This has excited 
a fpirit of induftry and improvement. They arc now build* 
ing comfortable houfes, and turning their lands to the beft 
advaotege. The great error, however, of the Highland 
farmers b overftocking. If they kept only two cows for 
every three they do at prefent, they would improve their 
breed of cattle, and be in no danger of lofing them by fe- 
vcre winters or fprings. Three bad ^ows will devour more 
grafs and ftraw than two good ones, but will never fetch 
as good a price from any drover. The price of cattle was 
Tery high for fome years pad. A Highland cow would 
fell for L. j or L. 6, and fometimes for L. 7 Sterling. If 
this be a good caufe for augmenting the rents, it is to be 
hoped, that proprietors will fee that the fall of the price of

Difeafes.^-Tht mod common difeafes in this parilh are 
rheumatlfms and fevers. Thefe diftempers, it is very like-

In i79f, there was a remarkable herring-fiibing in this 
loch. During low water, the children of Kirktown went 
often to the ftrand, and carried lapfulls of herring with 
them. The people fed entirely on fiih. They were vifit* 
ed by a fever. Their blood was vitiated. When they 
were let blood in the fever, it had the appearance, wheQ 
it congealed, of the blood of a boiled pudding, or of an ug-

longevity in the pariih. There have been likewife inflan- 
ces of foroe old couples in this pariih, who have felt the 
fweet pal&amp;on of love, after palling their grand dimaderick. 
Their union has given rife to feme curioos anecdotes and

Gaelic PM//.— Lochcarron has produced fonie good High- 
land poets, William Mackenzie, and Alexander, his bro- 
ther, compofed good Gaelic fongs. Some of their poems 
are to be found in Macdonald's collection. John, their bro- 
ther, was equally good \ and from the fpecimens we have 
of their poetry, we may fay, it is caufe of regret^ that 
more of their verfes were not committed to wnting, both 
on account of the language and i'entiment. The thoughts 
ar( juil and natural ; and the language, for the moft part, 
beyond the reach of criticilm. There have been likewife 
other poets in Lochcarron, who have compoied verfes, 
that are far from being defpicabk. And indeed many of 
them would have given the higheft pleafure to the greateil 
admirers of Homer, Virgil, or Milton, had they heard and 
underftood them. Gaelic is the language of defcriptive 
poetry. It is Aroug, nervous and comprehenfive. No 
. language can do greater juftice to the fineft feelings of the 
human heart.

tion of a clergyman at that time very difagreeable. A 
wife Providence, however, which always raifes fit inftru- 
ments for carrying forward its plans of -mercy towards 
men, fent among them Mr ^neas Sage, a man of an un- 
daunted fpirit, who did not know what the fear of man was *. 
He had, however, the fear of God, and great zeal for the 
good caufe in its higheft perfection. He was the determi- 
ned enemy of vice, and a true friend to the gofpel. 

Seafons* 

* The people were fo barbtrous, that they altempted to fet fire to the 
houfe he was boarded to, at a time when there was a meeting of clergy 
there. Such uiage made it ncceflary for him, not only to make ufe of 
the fword of the Spirit, bat likewiXc to have recuurfe to the arm offlelb. 
He was a true foldier in every fen£e o'' the word. For fome time he had 
the overfight of the parifli of Applecruls. as well as Lochcarron. There 
was a wicked fellow in Tofgag, who kept a miilrcfs in the fame houfie 
with his lawful married wife. When Mr Sage went to fee him, Malcolm 
Roy drew hit dirk; Mr Sage drew his fword ; and tlie con(equence wa% 
that Malcolm Roy turned his midreis off. Mr Campbell. Seaforth's fac- 
tor, fent him once a challenge upon the morning of a Lord's day. Mr 
Sage knew his owi) iituation, and accordingly accepted the challenge. 
He went out with his claymore, and no fooner did he begin to draw it 
out if the fcabbard» than Mr Campbell made a pair of heels, and did not 
look behind him for fome time. 

He was very hofpitable and benevolent He was warm and afie^ionate 
in his friendlhip, and perfe.'*ly fincere in his profeiTions. A gentlemia 
who had the misfortune to be concerned in the late rebellion, came to lee 
Mr Sage, as he was going ro leave the country. Mr Sage made him to 
cfier of his pnrfe. Altliough the gentleman did not accept of this offer, 
he always retained a grateful (enfc of Mr Sage*s friendlhip He was fub.

ences among the people, he reduced them to a date of civilization. He 
ploughed up the fallow ground, plucked up many of the thorns a^

•• Whatlball we do to be &amp;vcd ?" Mr Sage did not build with onteai- 
pered mortir ; he did not make them believe th«t an ontwtrd conrie of 
decent behaTiour would bring them tp heaven, though they were tttu^ 
gen to a work of the Spirit. He preached the dodrmes of the new birth, 
the porniption of human nature, and the neccffity of the infloenccs of the 
Divine Spirit, to break the power of 6n in the fouL The tSk^ weie 
correfpondent. People did not then reckon tbemfetves to be good Chri- 
ftians, becaufe they abftained firom fuch adlions as cxpofed them to the 
lafli of the taw. They were perfuaded that they moft have a principle of 
grace in the heart before they could pleafe Ood. This made diem not to 
reft ifatisfied till they experienced the power 6f religion upon dicir foola. 

They were warm Chriftians ; and fuch u made a public profeffion, 
evidenced their fincerity by a fuit&amp;ble praAice. They were animated wfth 
love to God, and to their fellow men. Kenneth Mackeoxie, one of hh 
firft converts, ofed to kill a cow in the fcarce time of the year, which he 
divided among the poor. The reft of the profoflbrs of religioB in Loch* 
carron were equally xealous of good works in conformity to their czr- 
cumftances. 

Mr Sage's charaAer is infcribed upon his grave-ftone in thefe vrords : 
«* He fought the good fight of fkith, and finiflied hi« comfe; ezclaiminf 
with the Apoftle Paul, for me to live is Chrift, and to die is gain.** A 
carnal minifter may fay with Balaam of old : Let me die the death of 
Mr Sage, and let my latter end be like his. His fucceflbr, Mr Donald 
Munro, lived but a fliort time among them. He was an agreeable man, 
and preached the gofpel in its purity. As Mr Sage made the parifli vesy 
orthodox, the people feero tp think, that they have at kaft as much reli- 
gion as their neighboun. They feem to have a ftrong attachment to reli- 
gion, and yet they would be the better for a little more. They appear 
willing at times to hear what they (hall do to inherit eternal life. Tbe^ 
are hoQ^uble, charitable, engaging, and obliging. Although many of 
them do not diOike the prefent world, it cannot be faid that they have 
entirely forgot the next ; but it rouft be owned, that very lew of them 
would refufe a dram if it was offered them. There is a great appearance 
f]f religion in Lochcarron ; and as the fire of God*s word is hereafter to try 
^very maa's work, there is caufe to hope that fome of it will bear the trial.

There it one opinion, however, which nuiny of thcoi enterttin, ^d 
which, indeed, is not pemlitr to thia pftrilh alone, that a Popiih prieil can

MANY diftrids in Scotland afford little infornuitioii or

tbefe may be ranked the pariih of Glentrathe&amp;» or lantra-

Elevated- on the ikirts of the Grampian momitains, from 
500 to icoo feet above Stratbmore, this diflxift has 
8 bleak and barren afped. The farfikce is nnoTen, oon- 
iifling of hills, valliesi and mountains. Near the fouthera 
boundary there is a bank of tolerably fertOe land, about a 
mile, in length and half a mile in breadth, fronting the S. 
and gently flbping to the rivers Melgam and Ha. A milr 
northward of the church, in a deep valley, there are fome 
well cultivated and fruitful fields. But the greater part of 
what is called arable land, is a thin and moorilh foUj which 
t yields

yields corn of a very inferior qoalitj. Sevend vallies, fit 
only for pafturagey extend northward among the hiUs, 
ivhich are covered with fkort heath, and buried in fnow 
during winter. There are few trees of any age or grow^ 
in this part of the country.

is no town, no village of note, no feat, no mines, nor mine- 
rals, no natural curiofities, few manufaftures, and little

butcher, no apothecary, and one Seceder only. Hamletsi, 
coarfely built of flone and earth, and covered with thatch^

teinds ot the chapel which he built or repaired in .Glentrathen, were 
transferred to the prior and convent of Inchmahomo. This priory, and 
othen, were granted by James VI. to John then Earl of Mar. and ere^ed

at prefent may be computed at nearly 900. Of thefe about 
50 are deoominated farmers, who occupy certain propor- 
tions of land, out e( which they tearwTcanty fubfifteuce. 
Few improvements have been made there in agriculture. 
The old fyftem prevails. Some plots of turnip, flax, and 
fown grais appear ; but oats and barley are the principal 
produAions of the ill cultivated foil. Of thefe a fufficient 
quantity is raxfed to fupply the neceflities of the natives;: 
but there is no proper encouragement to indufiry. How« 
ever facred the promife of a feudal lord may be held, little 
exertion will be made, or can be expeded, where no leafes 
' are granted, and where heavy fervitudes are impqfed; 
while a tenant fubfifts at the pleafure of the proprietor, 
and is bound to perform twelve carriages to the diilance of 
20 miles, even in feed-time or harveft, he will not difplay 
that vigour and enterprize, by which his brethren in other 
parts of the country have arrived at eafe and opulence. 
This is a difgraceful remain of a fyftem humiliating to man, 
and hoftile to all improvement \ a fyftem which, about 50 
years ago, prevailed in all its rigour throughout the nor- 
thern part of Scotland, but which every enlightened land- 
lord, defirous of the profperity of his country, and of hia 
own intereft, has now abandoned. There are no enclofures 
nor plantations of trees, and fcarcely one fifth of the pariih 
is arable. The whole, perhaps, ought to be converted into 
grab farms, the coldnefs of the climate, and poverty of the 
foil, being inimical to cultivation. No marl has been 
found in thb parifli ; and fuel for the purpofe of burning 
lime cannot be obtained. With difficulty the inhabitants 
procure peats, turf, and heath for domeftick ufe. Thefe are 
dug out of Newton mofs, or torn from the furface of the 
mountains ; and the preparing and carrying home of that 
fuel confumes a great part of fummer.— There is no trade 
nor manufadure in this comer, but foch as is neceflary

the parilh lies nearly 60 miles fcmth of Edinburgh, axid 
18 miles north of the Solwaj Frith at Port Annan. 

IVatiTs. — ^The water of Drjfe takes its rife in TiOchfell, 
at the N. W. comer of the pariih of HnttoUy and mas 
through it about 7 miles. The watei of, Corrie takes its 
rife at the north march of thefe annexed pariihes, and txxds 
between them, or along them, about 6 miles, where it josss 
the water of Milk at Balfiack. 

Apptaranct or AfftQ* — ^The view or afpeft of both pa- 
riflies is very different from difierent points. Within fight 
of Dryfe* till near its {burce* the hilb are of a fine Terdorr, 
the banks moftlj covered with wood. The water alter- 
natelj on rock and gravel, makes the whole romantick and 
pleafing. In fight of Milk, the view is fomething fimilar, 
but leis hilly, lels woodj, and leis rocky. In fight of 
Corrie, the extent of rich pafture and meadow is ftrikbg. 
But on the heights between thele waters, the fcene is mudi 
the reverfe. It is partly moffy, and generally bleak, bur 
not barren. 

Vamtt and Denvation.-'^Tht name of Hutton is from 
the farms of Upper and Nether Hutton, ficuated within a 
mile of the church. In the i6th century the leamd and 
elegant bifhop of Dunkeld ufes the word Holt^ £ot eleva- 
ted and hilly grounds, and Hdut for a wood. Both the 
farms of Hutton anfwer this defcription, being fitutated on 
elevated ground rifing from Dryfe, having Ceveral frnail 
hills, and bordered with natural wood. But how verlattk 
the meaning of words in livbg languages i HoU or Hottf 
is now diminiflied to a very fmall hay cock, or a fmall 
quantity of manure before it is fpread. The word is here 
now not knowp in any other fenfe. Came is from the 
Gaelic. The water of that name, iiets out from a narrow 

glen

glen fimilar to many of the fmall glens named Carries in 
the Highlands ♦. 

Soil. — The foil of the high or north parts of the pariHi 
is partly mofly or mooriihy excepting what lies within View 
of the waters. The corn-lands upon Drjfe, exdufive of 
the holms, are a rock gravel of a good quality. Thofe upon 
Corrie are generally a fine clay, and the holms excel as 
meadow for producing large quantities of hay. . The fame 
clay foil prevails over the heights of Corrie, until it ap« 
proaches the water of Milk, where again the rock gravel 
foil comesin. % 

Farming J and Different Kinds of Sheep.-^The farming or 
management of farmers in this parifh is various. The upper 
part of the parifh is all under (heep, and chiefly breeding 
iheep. The middle and lower parts of the parifh have com, 
cattle, and iheep, moftly changeable (locks. The iheep in 
the higheil farms are of the black- faced kind, called ihort 
iheep, and in farms rather lower fituated are white-faced, 
called long iheep*, now known under the name of the Che- 
viot breed ; each kind is held to have its qualities. The ihort 
iheep are generally fuppofed the moil hardy, and the wool of 
the Cheviot iheep brings moft money. It is more generally 
allowed, that when manufadures are low and feafons not 
good, the ihort iheep have mod buyers -, when circumilan- 
ces are different, there is moil demand for long iheep. It 
is agreed on all hands, that there are many farmers ia 
Yorkihire, Lancaibire, Weilmordand, Cumberland, and

coiintiesy who would on no account buy any odier yHayi 
ihort £beep. Tbey lay thefe of a year old on commons and 
high feUsy where they fay long flieep would not tfarxre. 
There are as many farmeis in the &amp;nie counties, who pre- 
fer the long iheep, and buy no other ; both fimm an idea 
that the kbds they graze thrive heft on their grounds, and 
confequently make the fureft return. The flieep of the 
fouth of Scotland may be faid to be driven whoOy to thefe 
counties, and while fo decided a preference is by dtibrent 
buyers given to each kind, it feems at leaft prudent in the 
Scotch breeders, to continue the kinds fer which tb^ find 
the heft demand. 

From the trials made of breeding long flieep upon higjb 
ferms in this parifli and the neighbourhood, it docs nor 
feem to be well afcertained that black-faced fiiecp are the 
mod hardy. On the farm of Mackmaw, the fecood faigheff 
in this parifli, long flieep were laid in the year 1759 ; they 
were continued for 9 years, and it is granted that no 
farm of the neighbourhood returned more to the tenant 
than Mackmaw did. This tenant removed in 1768. Ife 
was fucceeded by a man from Tweeddale, who ftocked with 
the black-feced flieep he was acquainted with. This man 
cannot be faid to have thriven, but there is a difference in 
men as well as in flieep. The prefent tenant with black* 
faced flieep thrives. It b obferved, when there is a gene- 
ral failure in fheep by wet and cold feafons, that long 
flieep are more generally affefied with the rot« This it is 
believed is the cafe ; but it is alfo the cafe, that fliort fheep 
generally inhabit the driefl grounds. Let the farmers who 
poflefi wet grounds in feafons fuch as 1.790, 1791 and 
179a, and have ihort flieep, fpeak to the advantages they 
have had. If they had fuch, it b unknown to their 

neighbours.

The white-faced iheep, however, are rather on the k- 
crealie. The maoagement of one farmer, may not be 
thought impertinent. Mr Graham of Shaw in the year 
K7761 had his farms flocked with (hort iheep« About this. 
time, the improvements in flieep by Mr Bakewell were 
much fpoken of. The kte Earl of, Hopetoun fo known in 
rural OBConomicSi thought the Annandale iheep might be 
improved by Bakewell's breed* He bought rams, and 
fome df the tenants thought they paid a compliment to his 
Lordfliip, by giving a few of their ewes to try the crois 
breed. It is laid the (lambs got the run of the flock, and 
did not thrive. This is likely ; the hilb of Ajinandale 
head are deep and high, and the prejudice of the fitrmers 
againft fo ftriking am alteration in the appearance of their 
iheep was great. Mr Graham was the only farmer who 
perfevered in changing his breed ; without . getting xmc 
^white-faced ewe, he had a whi;e*faced flock in a few yean, 
by putting out the lambs which went moft to the face and 
wool of his former fheep. An unlucky circumffamce wa5 
like to have deftroyed his whole flock ; and 10 his I0&amp;, 
add the mortification of his ne^hbours fuppofing, that it 
was the reward of his temerity in adopting Englifh fheep* 
He had fent a few of his tup-lambs to be wintered near the 
fea-coaft, in the view of their returning ftrongcr, than if 
wintered on his own farms. They brought home, undif* 
covered, the fcab. The whole flock was feized. Every 
remedy, then known, was applied for 4 years without e£» 
{e&amp; ; and the farmer was on the eve of defpair of ever re- 
covering them, after having lofl many hundred pounds by 
the difeafe. The prefcription, publiihed for this diforder 
by Sir Jofeph Banks, was obierved in the newfpaper, and 
immediately applied, which had the efie£l to clear the 
flock totally in a few months *• This was only 3 years 

ago.

ago. Since then, the flicep fold from this fiock brought 
more money than any of their neighboors. The flock

each five fleecesi and fold before the prefent fall of the 
price of wool, at aboot 148. the fiooe. 

The lower part, and nearly the half of die parifh, is oc* 
cupied for raifing corn, and grazing cattle and Iheep ; aod 
the tenants, ^ho* generally keep marss for their wark« 
breed each a foal yearly, of a good draught kind. For &amp;- 
veral years pad, the raifing of com has been gradoally 
giving place to the other porpofes, This may have been 
partly owing to the increafing prices of iheep and cattle, 
but may more particularly have been owing to the tenants 
having had no lea&amp;s, or leafes whidi did not exceed 9 
years. The want of roads, and difiance from lime, 
prevented the advantages of art and improvement from 
keeping pace with the ezpenfe of labour \ and the ac- 
cuftomffd multures were no lefs than the ninth coin. 
Thele fignal difadvantages are in a great meafure got, and 
-getting the better of. The chief proprietor of thefe pa- 
riihes has lately annihilated the thirlage of his tenants in 
every degree. He ha^ granted leafes for ax years, and 
communications to the lime-works, and markets are open- 
ing up. Though thefe are but recently fet abonti and hi 
from being complete, the ttk&amp; of them is already vifibk.

neighbourhood of London. The younger and lefler are 
kept on till Auguft, and fold in the north of England^ 
Sometimes thefe are changed oftener than once or twice 
in a year. Of the young cattle bred here, the ftots, at 18 
months old, are fold at Dumfries, and bought by the Gal« 
loway graziers ; and the heifers not kept for breeding are 
fent into the north of England in September. Thefe are 
confidered a true good breed of cattle, and bring as much 
money in proportion to their bone as any in Scotland, ex- 
cepting only Weft Highlanders. The (heep kept here are 
got in lambs from the breeders, and fold in hogs, i. e. jt9X 
old's. For particular farms, reckoned the higheft or bleak- 
eft, they are bought in hogs, and fold in dinmonts, i. e. 
wedders rifing two years old. 

This mode of £u:ming, by changing ftocks, has advan- 
tages and difadvantages in the extreme. When managed 
with attention and (kill, and fuiBcient funds, the return is 
certain, and the difference of high or low psites wi^ af- 
fe&amp; the farmer very little. If he fell cheap, he buys pro- 
portionally ; and when he fells even at the {ame prices he 
bought in at the year before, he may dill have enough 
left to pay his rent. Hu rilk however is great. He fells 
his whole ftock yearly, or oftener, in place of felling only 
the yearly caft of his ftock as the breeder, does. He has o- 
ther material difadvantages. He is led often away from 
his home and farm, which mufi fnfier in his abfence \ and 
if he have not more than an ordinary Ihare of prudence, he 
is led to dif^patiottt

fome particular farms of dry land fold oats for feed, yet the

Farmers^ Heritors^ Hujbandry^ fSc, — ^The pari&amp;i is di- 
vided into 32 farms, which are held io leafe by 27 fanners. 
The prefent rental is about L. xxoo. The heritors are five 
in number, only one of whom refides within the pariih. 
The farmers look toward their black cattle and (heep for 
the payment of the mafter and their own profits. There 
are yearly fold by them about 364 black cattle, of a fmall 
breed, but which, when removed to rich land, fatten in a 
ihort time. The other article they have to difpofe of is 
Iheep, of which they fell annually about 1480^ and about 
672 ftones of wool. The mutton of this place hath long 
and defervedly been efteemed for its excellent flavour. The 
wool is alfo of a good quality, and hath, for thefe fome 
^ears bypaft, fold from 9 s. to 13 s. the ifone. The paxiih hath 
not hitherto fuf^lied itfelf with grain, but in time, I doubt 
not, will be able to remedy this dtk&amp;. The land, in its 
natural ftate, makes \)ut very poor returns to the farmer ; 
but when drelTed with lime, pays handfomely, a trial ha- 
ving already been made in three of the farms. As the 
great body of the farmers did not think of improving their 
land at the commencement of their prefent leafes, now 
that they are willing, they are difcouraged on account of the 
fbortneis of their leafes, mod of them expiring in the courfe 
of five or fix years. The expenfe of drefling the land with 
lime is too great for the farmer to be paid in the courfe of 
fo ihort a leaCe, having to cany it upwards of five nules, 
and befides to pay at the rate pf i s. 2d. the buihel, of 
which from 45 to 50 are required to an acre. Thefe, 
though the great obftacles towards the improving their land 
at prefent, are not the only, the roads in the pari(h being 
in fuch a ftate as to be almoft impaflable with carriages of 
any kind j even the principal road is at times fo, only a 
fmall part of it as yet being formed. Although other cir-

oil, or African greafe, inftead of butter ; and it is aficrted 
bj fome of them, that after trjing the experiment^ they 
not only find it cheaper, but that it alfo improves the 
wool both in quantity and qtiality. The black cattle are 
calculated at 300 in Langholm, and 86 x in Halfinorton. 
It may be proper to obferve, that in Halfmorton, the num*

breed, their wool is omitted in the calcoktion, as being 
greatly inferior in quality to that of the white-faced kind.

made ap Wanchopedale next fpring, to fborten the comiiiB* 
nicatioQ between Langholm^ Lockerbie, and £cclefecban» 
and other places to the weftward. There is a bridge of 3 
arches over the Eflc, where the road leading ap into £&amp;• 
dale begins, which unites the town and the village (or 
New Town) on the W. fide of the river. It was built in 
the year X7759 by fubfcripdon. A little way N. there is 
another of a arches, upon the poft-road over the Ewes. Tbey 
fiand nearly parallel, and are not above a gun-fliot fioai 
each other, the two rivers immediately uniting between 
them. About half a mile S. of Langholm, there is another 
of 3 arches, which is fuppofed to be at leaft more than co- 
eval with the current century. Befides feveral fmaHer 
arches, there are 3 other bridges, which do not merit any 
particular notice. 



lUo^i«-^Having already had frequent occafion to 
rion the rivers in this pariih, it needs only farther to be ob- 
ferved, that the Ewes, after interfering the parifli of that 
name, runs about a mile through tlys pariih, and inter- 
mixes with the Elk, immediately before itpa£Ges below the 
bridge that communicates with the village or New Town, 
and that the Wauchope alfo joins it from the W. about a 
hundred yards below. After floods, excellent falmon are 
caught in the Elk; but the quantity, it is alleged, is 
much diminiibed ,by the obflru6tion they meet with from 
the mound acrois the river at Netherbie, that conveys wa- 
ter to Sir James X^rrabam's mills ; it may alfo be owing, 
perhaps, to the falmon-fiiheries upon the Solway frith, to 
which, of l«te years, great attention has been paid, and 
which, of courfe, muft diminiih the quantity in the Elk, 
and in the other tribijitary rivers. Suffice it to (ay, ]that 
from the great quantities caught in both plates, and fent 
Co York and London, little of it reaches Langholm market.

now finifliing. The offices are alfo to be rebuilt next year. 
It is a vice patronage between the Crown and the Duke 
of Buccleugh. The (lipend, cxclufive of the ^lebe, is 
L.83:6:'8 in money. The fchool and fchoolmafter's 
houfe are at prefent ruinous, but they are foon to be rebuilt. 
As the prefent mafter is but newly deded, and has not 
yet opened fchool, the number of fcholars cannot be afcer- 
tained. Many years ago, when the parifli was le(s popu- 
lous than at prefent, they often exceeded a hundred.- Th^ 
falary, including the intereft of L. 50 bequeathed by John 
Read for the education of poor children, is about L^ij. 
A Burgher meeting-houfe was built a few years ago in the 
town. Above a j heads of families belonging to the pariih 
attend it ; but fuch is the liberality of the age, that mofi, 
if not all of them, occafionally attend the church. They 
arc in general peaceable fiibjcfts, and many of them are 
ufeful and valuable members of fociety. Their clergyman 
is paid from the feat-rents. There are 8 peribns of the 
Epifcopal perfuafion, who aUb attend the church. It is 
gratifying to every liberal mind to dbferve bigotry and in- 
tolerance, among every denomination of Chriftians, giving 
place to that charity which is the bond of peace, and ranks 
higheil among the Chriftian virtues.

fer ten years paft is 125 ; of births, 820 ; of funerals, 333 ; 
of which, the annual average is 82 births, 12 marriages, 
and 33 funerals. As the Seceders have no regifter of bap- 
tiftns, and as irregular marriages frequently occur, and ma- 
ny are buried out of the parifli, whofe names are not regi-

ManufaBttreSy Ac. — A branch of the cotton mano&amp;c- 
ture was eftabiiihed about 4 years a^ in New Langholm^ 
which employed from 80 to 100 people ; but by the late 
(hock of commercial credit, which has deranged the Com* 
pany's affairs, it has been at a (land fince July laiL There 
is every reafon however to think, that from the many of- 
fers already made for a leafe of the houfes, utenfib, i^c, 
it will foon be refumed. Fortunately for the weavezsp 
mod, if not all of them, are now employed by Meflrs For* 
refter and Ferguffon. two refpeAable manufafiurerg in Car- 
lifle, in weaving checks, Ifc. (fo called, from being chec* 
quered or ilriped \) by which means, they are kept from 
emigrating into other parts of the country in queft of 
bread for themfelves and their families. The manufac- 
ture of checks and thread has lately been begun in Lang- 
holm, and promifes to fucceed* Dnring the lad year, one 
man alone, Mr Carruthers, manufadured and fold above 
20,000 yards of checks^ and other coarfe linens. Stoo 
kings have alfo begun to be manufadured, and fuch al« 
ready is the demand for them, that the manufadurer can- 
not anfwer hb orders. They are fold at from a s. to 5 s. 
a-pair. Confidering all the advantages which Langholm 
enjoys, it is matter of furprife, that a woollen manufac- 
ture, upon an extenfive fcale, has not long ago been efta- 
biiihed. Inexhauftible moiTes, within a miles of the town, 
fumifh peat in abundance at i s. 6 d. the cart-load, and 
eoal b fold at the pit at the lame price, and delivered at 
Langholm, at the average of 4 s. or 4 s. 6 d. the cart. By

the fifie bridge thrown over the £ik this fummer (1793) 
tt GUnocky, his Grace's coal-pit at Bjrebam is cmlj 5 
miles diftanti where there is a profpeft of a plentifbl fop- 
ply by a large water-engine, and other machinery, con- 
fimfled upon a new plan by the ingenious Mr Keir. Wool 
, of the beft quality, is the ftaple commodity of the coontrj. 
Three rivers meet dofe by the town, upon which foiling 
mills, or other machinery might be ereAed to any extent, 
and the raw material, every where around, can be procu- 
red, without the expenfe of carriage. Solway frith, from 
which goods can be exported to any quarter of the globe, 
is only 14 miles diftant. Uniting fo many advantages, the 
eftablifliment of fach a manufa&amp;ure In Langholm, cannot 
fnrely be far difiant. Deprived of many of thefe advan- 
tages, Hawick and GMlafliiells are making great progrefs 
in the manufadure of carpets, iSc. particularly Galla- 
Ihiells, the (lockings and narrow cloths of which, by the 
indufiry of a few indiTiduals, are now arriving at great 
perfeftion. Exclufive of cloths, grocery, and other goods 
fold in the (hops, wood, Welih flate, ur, greafe batter, 
palm oil, (or African greefe), are imported at Sarkfoot, 
and fold in Langholm, to the amount of L. 4009 and up- 
wards. In Ihort, there feems to be a fpirit of indoftry and 
enterprife arifing, which, if properly cheriflied, may ulti* 
mately lead to the introduftion of difierent manufafiures, 
particularly to that of the woollen, for which, every thing 
confidered, Langholm, of all other places in Scotland, feems 
beft calculated. This wiihed for event, fo beneficial in its 
confequences, as keeping money in the country, and gi- 
ving bread to the natives, is not however to be accom- 
pliQied, but by people of capital, and of profefGooal ikil|.

Population^ E^c— From the many veftiges of old houfeSi 
it is evident, that in the landward part of the parifli, po« 
jpulation has decreafed confiderablj daring the prefent cen^ 
turj. This may be owing, in a great meafure, to the u- 
nion of farms, many of the prefent tenants holding, in one 
farm, what was formerly about the beginning of this cen- 
tury, divided among 7 or 8. Waving the difcuflion of 
the advantages or difadvaatages refulting from a monopo- 
ly of fiairms, it appears that the lands now occupied by 14 
tenants, about the beginning of the cm-rent century, were 
divided among no fewer than 80 bmilies, mod of whom, 
people now alive, or lately deceafed, remembered. This 
decreafe, however, is morp than fupplied by the increafed 
population of the town, vrhich did not then perhaps con- 
tain above 250 or 200 fouls, and which now exceeds 1500. 
In the beginning of Odober 1793, the population of Lang- 
holm and Halfmorton confifted as follows.

it happened, in one or two inftances, that the town was in 
^veat diftrels for want of it, either from a monopoljr in 
thoie who dealt in it, or from a fiifficient quantity not 
being imported to anfwer the demand. This perhaps 
ihows the utility of a public granary, in order to provide 
againft any temporary Icarcity, from whatever caufe it 
-may originate. There are 4 fairs in the year, of which 
the greateft is held about the a6th of July, called the Lamb 
fair. It as the gieateft &amp;ir for lambs in Scotland. 

CoaclnJimg Oi/ervations.'^ln the years 1781, 1781, and 
1783, the inhabitants, both in the town and country, humane- 
ly interpofed to alleviate the calamities of the poor, refult- 
log from the almoft total fitilnre of the crops in this quar- 
ter, (which were blafled by premature frofts). Peafe were 
imported from Newcaftle and ground into meal, and oat- 
meal from Annandak and Nithfdale, by public fubfcrip- 
tion, and fold to the poor greatly below the current prices 
of the country. This beneficent plan not only relieved 
the indigent, but was alfo the means of bringing to market 
the meal, which avarice for a time concealed in the coun- 
try, in order to gradfy itfelf at the ezpenfe of the public 
calamity. A Friendly Society was inftituted in Lang- 
holm about that feafon of fcarcity, which has been prodnc- 
iive of beneficial confequences. It confifts at prefent of

from a town or county for a limited time, by wkidl 
axieaaa they are let loofe to commit thw depredations ii|

of their fentence, allowed to retttm, confirmed in their wic* 
Icednels, would it not tend more to reclaim rfaem from 
"vice, to have a bridewell, upon a fmall fcale, built at the 
united ezpenfe of the 5 pariihes, where they could be con« 
fined at hard labour and folitary confinement, for a period 
proportioned to their crimes : Such a plan, it is appre* 
bended, would be attended with the moft falutary e&amp;fis, 
and reclaim many, who otherwife may be loil to fociety, 
and become viftims to the violated laws of their country. 
It has already been obferved, that it muft always be more 
grateful to the feelings of a humane magiftrate to prevent 
crimes than to punifh them. This humane purpoie could 
not, perhaps, be more effedually promoted than by fuch 
a fcheme. The dread of folitary confinement, and the 
ihame of being thus ezpofed in a diftrid where they are 
known, would operate in many inftances as a powerful 
preventive. It may be proper, before concluding this ac- 
count, to obferve, that though it is much to be regretted, 
that there are too many inftances of idleneis and diffipa 
tion arifing from the caufes already aifigned, yet thele 
vices are by no means the general charafteriilic of the 
people. In hofpitality, and other offices of humanity, they 
yield to none, and there are many among them who are 
exempbry, no lels for their induflry, fobriety, and de- 
cency of manners, than for a flrift obfervance of every 
moral and religious duty, afiing at once the part of good 
fubjeds and pious Ghriftians *.

General CbaraSer. — ^Thc people arc in general fober, re- 
gular, and indaftrious. They are economical rather than 
expchfive, yet humane and hofpitable. They are of fimple 
manners, peaceabte in their difpofitiony and inoffenfive in 
their behavionr. They enjoy in a reafonable degree the 
comforts and conveniences of focietj, and /feem contented 
ivith their fituation and circumftances. They are of the 
- ordinary fiature^ healthy, and flrong enough for their iize. 

CropSf State of AgricuUure^ i^^ .-^Tbe principal crops 
raifed in the parifli are oats and barley. Some rye and 
peafe, and, of late year8»fome turnips and hay are alfo rai« 
fed in the pariih, and potatoes, cabbagesi and greens, fuf- 
fiicient for the confumption of the inhabitants. The old 
method of forming is by £ar mod generally ufed in the di- 
ftridi and improvement is as yet juft only in its infancy. 
The ridges are crooked, and in many places the tops of. 
them raifed more than two feet above the level of the fur- 
rows. All the infield grounds are kept almoft conftantly 
in crop. The common, indeed it may be (aid the only, 
rotation, is barley and oats. About \ part, or as much as 
can be got dunged, is annually fown with barley, and the 
reft with oats. The only preparation for a barley crop is 
a ribbing, after the field is dunged, and. a fingle ploughing

for trees, which one of the proprietors of the eftate of £cht planted in the 
laft centory on the fummit of the hill, but of which there are now no Yet-

perceptible through the ditches and the inner wall. On the S. of the

• In the years 1789 and 1783, the parifh of Echt was by no means 
exempt from the general calamity. It fuffered confiderably from the Jate-

ing to the earlinefs of the foil and climate, moft of the-barley was ripened, 
'end a good deal of the oats filled, and tolerably ripened, before the intenfe 
frofts and foow came on ; but the latrft both of barley and oats was hurt 
bj the froft, and a conliderable deficiency found in the crop. The poorer 
of the inhabitanu were kept from feeling the extremities of want by the 
exertions of the kirk-feflion, who bought a confiderable quantity of meal, 
and diftributed it among the poor upon the parifli-roll inftead of money, 
and fold it out to other indigent perfons in the parifli at a reduced price. 
The paridi received but a fmall proportion of the meal and peafe granted 
by Government in fummer 1783 for the relief of the poor in the northern 
ii&amp;n{ii of Scotland, t«». five bolls of meal, and two bolls of peafe.

Borthwick Vm about zi miles S. E. from Edbbiirgli, and 
X mile N. £. from Middleton. Its limits are fomewhat iite- 
gular ; but, on an average, its extent from £. to W. is about 
6 miles, and from S. to N. about 4 miles. The climate is 
various ; but upon the whole, mild and temperate. In this 
tra£t of country there is coofiderahk lels rain than &amp;Hb on

doads, and with the attraftion of the frith of Forth on

while our neighbours are threatened with a deluge. The

Borthwick itfelf ftands in a pleafant valley, farronnded oq 
every fide by rifing grounds of confiderable beigfat, bet 
fcarce fo high| or of fuch rapid afceot, as to defenre the 
name of hills. The general furface is uneven, and when 
viewed from the church, very much refemblesthe waves 
of the fea. The foil is exceedingly various, bat for the 
moft part kindly and light. Some portion of it, indeed, 
con fids of clay -, fome part of it is loamy ; and the iiigfaer 
grounds rather cold, and fomewhat marlby. 

Proprietors^ State of Property and Cuknatum^^^^Thtt^ arc 
in this diftrid fix proprietors, all of whom refide ui the 
pariih except one, who has in it only a (mall farm. Thefe 
proprietors retain in their own hands about one half of the 
property, and feveral of them have fbade, and mre ftifl 
making, on their eftates moft fubftanttal improvements. 
In point of cultivation, indeed, this parilli has long been 
thought coniiderably behind \ but the prefent farmers, whe 
ther proprietors or tenants, are, by rapid ftridcs, follow- 
ing their mote ikilfiil and induftrious, and confequently 
more fuccefsful neighbours. Encloiing, partly by hedge 
and ditch, and partly by ftone and lime walk, has been of 
great fervice; and the ftrips and clumps of plantation, which 
meet the eye in every dire£tion, have b^utified the coun- 
try, and tend very much to warm and fertilize the foil. 
The rotation of crops, like the foil, muft be various ; but 
the introdudion of green crops and fummer fallow, have 
been of nnfpeakable advantage, both in cleaning the ground 
and in procuring plenty of nourifliing food for black cattle 
and horfes, and confcquently in increafing the quantity of 
manure. There is in every corner plenty of lime, which in 
this part of the country is not now much ufed as manure, 
cither becaufe being fo much within reach, it is not )icld in 
fufficient eflimation, or what is paore probablei becaufe a

refpeflable Committee of the Dalkeith farmer Sodcty. 
This iiitlrumeiit has double coulters and moiild-boanls, and

Since the year I78pt the inhabitants in thb quarter ha:ve

There are now in this parifli 85S finds ; 41a males, and 
446 females; of thefe 134 are children under 8 years of

204 Suiiiltes, io that fenethiag more than 4, or about 4^

in this part of the country for the ehiUren of Seceders to 
attach themielves to the Church, than for the children of

the fide of the water, a ruin, which is laid to \tiirt hteh 
the refidence of the family of Bofthwicky before thej wer^ 
created Peers, or had rifen to fuch eminence in this coiid« 
try. About the end of the 14th and beginning of the i jth 
century, lived a Sir William Borthwick, Who,- beftig a mafi 
of very great parts, was employed as an ambaflador on fe« 
veral important negotiations, and concerned in moft of th^ 
public tranfadions of hb time. Thb William apfAmrs to 
have been created Lord Borthwick before the year 1430 i 
for, in Ofiober that year, at the baptifin of the King's two 
fons, feveral Knights were created, and among the reft 
William, fon and heir of Lord Borthwick. He obtained 
from King James L of Scotland, a licence to build a caftlfe 
on the lands of Lochwarret, jtd conjlruendam arenti 
in Uh toco qui vutgarittr dtcitur ie mottt de Lochwarret. 
This grant was obtained by a charter under the Great Seal 
in the year 1430; A ftately and moft magnificent caftk 
was accordingly reared, and aftetAvard became the chief 
feat and title of the family. This amazing tnals of build*

a confiderable breach ; but whether this hath been occa- 
fioned by a flafli of lightning, or by the influence of the 
weather, or by fome original defeft in the building, cannot 
now with ceruinty be determined. The form of this ve- 
nerable ftruflnre is nearly (quare, being 74 by 68 fett

whom they have been depofited. The fpot on which they are fouad has 
in all probability, been a military ftation ; but whether Roman, Danifii 
or Brittih, we fliall not pretend to decide. From the united teftimooy 
of travelTen and hiftorians, there feems to be little reafon to doubt, that 
the practice of burning the dead did once prevail among fome of the 
northern nations, and Dr Heniy, who was inde&amp;tigable in his re&amp;arrhes, 
and whofe veracity hath never been called in queftion, obiervet, in hit 

'iiiftory of Britain, that " the ancient bhabitants of Sosth Britain burnt 
** the bodies of the dead, according to the cuAom of the ancient Gaols, 
*' firofm whom they were dcfcended.*' This the hiftorian thinks evident, 

- from tKe the great number of urns, of Britilh workmanlhip, which have 
been found in various comers of the ifland, full of aihes and human 
bones, half burnt. Difcoveries too, of a late date, tend to corroborate 
the circumftances which the Do^or brings in proof of bis conjec-

cbcriihed a&amp; atuctment to the place of his imtivky, and- to 
the lateft period of life, talked of the icenes of his jovA 
with a pkafing and interefting warmth. Such a ihining 
charader needs no panegyric. The figure which he made 
in the church is jtt btSh in the memory of the order to 
which he belonged. The digpity of his manner, the 
fhength of his. argumenti, and precifion with which they 
were jfiatedi the (moothneis of^his period^i and* the clear 
but nervous language in which he at all times ezprefled 
his lentiments, but more efpecially on particular oocafions, 
gained the attention of his audience, and comQianded the * 
admiration of fiich of them as had any tafte for pulpit ora- 
tory. His talents for couTerfation and engaging manners 
were no lels remarkable. His writings mt known and 
l-ead with avidity in every quarter of the globe ) his fnb- 
jeds are interefting, and handled in a mafterly manner ; 
and in all the produftioss of his pen appear fiich a pro- 
found knowledge of human nature, fuch accurate difcri- 
jninatioo, and fuch a power of eloquence, that his &amp;me 
will live when the prefent and many fuoceeding genera-

In the law department, the Onndafes of Amifton have

patch in bufinefi, as well as by their unwearied attention 
to the particular caufes which came under their review,

fibky which muft be obfiervtd with pfeafure by every one

proceeds from a diftrent behaviour, being inconfifient 
with their worldly int^reft, and expofing them to the ri-

X7869 the fiimily of Maghie of Bahoaghie poflefled exten- 
fiye eftates in this part of the country, and here they reii- 
ded. Hence the etymology of the name of the pariih is ob- 
vious. The difbid is quadrilateral \ but as it has not yet 
been completely furveyed, its form cannot be accurately de- 
fcribed. Its length may be about 8 or 9, and its breadth 
firom 3 to 6 Engliih miles. The general appearance of the 
iiirfiice is very £u: from pkafing the eye. A great pan of it 
is covered with heath, and wi^ rocks. There axe fome bogs

forms the Ene of feparation between it and Kelb. At the

with the Ken is formed. Here the two rivers, made one

Walter bloan Laurie, £fq. of Redcaftle. Of this the fol-

It is a chalybeate water, and perhaps one of the firongefl 
of the kind in North Britain.. Being chemically tried by 
many, it has been found to contain a ftrong impregnaticHi 
of that ore. Perfons afBiSed with aguiih complaints have 
always found relief from its ufe ; and, even in obftinate 
intermittcnts, perfed cures have been made by it. In 
other complaints of the ftomach, and in many female

Scotland in general, rains are frequent and heavy. They art

The air in the moors is rather piercing and c6ld ^ but ijie 
diftrid, on the whole, cannot be coniidered as unfavourable 
^o health and longevity. No epidemical difeafes are pre*

ment have neither been thrown into farms of immoderate 
extent, nor broken down into imall pofleftlons. Cot-crofts 
(as they were called) have been aboliflied *, but the influence 
of this in promoting depopulation, has been fufliciently

The horfes are either reared in the coantrj,' or imported 
frmn Ireland. The cattle are xskdHy of the true GraDo^aay 
breed, which is too well known to need a particular deichp- 
tion* Several of the farmefs deal in Iriih black cattle to a 
confiderablc extent. Thefe they frequently keep in winter 
to confume part of their fodder in the fieids^ and about Cao* 
dlenias they fend them op to the Englifii markets. The 
fhecp in the mooia are of the common bhck-faccd kind: 
thofe on the lower lands are of the white-faced half-mog 
fpecies. A. few Shetland ftieep have been introduced lately^ 
but are not in a thriving date. Live-ftock of every kind 
ha? fallen very much in price in the courie of lafi year. This 
is afcribed by fome to the war in which this country is en- 
gaged. Others again, who fpeak with more caution on pu- 
blic affairs, afcribe it to the icarcity of money* Whatever 
be the caufe, the effed is to many poor farmers a foorce of 
very ferious diftrels. The bed arable and meadow lands are 
let at IDS. or 12s. the acre, in farms of confiderable ex- 
tent. Some fmall encloiures yield at the rate of 18 s. or 
L. t the acre. Moor lands, let by the lump, are had for 
is. the acre, and fome even lower. As feveral of the 
eilates are entailed, there has not of late been any confider- 
able transference by fale. In the year 1786, the eftate No. i. 
containing 2900 acres, was purchafed for L. 10,700; and 
Xoon afterward let at L. 758 a-year. About the fame time 
the eltatc No. 3. containing 2400 acres, and let for L. 42c, 
was bought for L. 9300. 

Agriculture.'^^On the arable lands the modes of improve- 
ment and management are fo fitnilar to thofe in neighbour- 
in// 'ari(hes already defcribed, that a particular account of 
die :. need not be given at prefent. It need only be ob- 
&amp;j:ve4» tha^ Inch Aicceis has attended them, that the pariih

bat yields^ at the fame time, confiderable quantities of gram 
fior exportation. In ibme of the moor farms the praftice of 
paring and bnming is ftill purfiied«. Land fo managed ge« 
XLerallj {uroduces two or three good crops \ but, in many 
«aiies» the foil itiielf muft be thereby exhaufted. Thoie, 
therefore, who have. crops at fuch an expenUe, feem to be 
in the fituation of a man^ who, by fpeoding his fortune, lives 
more fiilly than he could do by confining himfelf to the aa« 
nuairent of it ; but will certainly be.', di&amp;ppointed, if he 
exped to maintain himielf fo long. Great trads of headi 
in the moors are fet on fire in fpring, to make young grais 
^ow for the lambs. The length of the winten, and Ham 
tains which generally fucceed themi feldom allow this ope- 
ration to be finiihed fo early as the law requires ^. The 
tenour of leafes, granted by landlords, (or, as they arc fre- 
quently called, matters), is not in ^very refped calculated to 
encourage and reward the induftry of the tenant. Perfonal 
fervices are fliil required. AiBgnees and fubtenants ^e .al* 
moft univerfally fecluded. Some have begun to proceed 
further, expreisly fecluding the legal diligence of creditors \ 
and declaring the leafe to be irAtated in the event pf the fta- 
tutory bankruptcy of the tenant, or fequeftration of his ef« 
fcds. The Board of Agriculture lately eftablilhed, would 
do well tp coniider what the effeds of fuch a daufe as this

* To the rportfraan, this prores a fource of the moft ferious alarm ; at 
it fometimcs prevents the mulri^lication of thofe animah which are, ia 
his eve, of more value than aiiy with which the earth is repleniOied. For 
this evil there feems to be but one reoieiiy. As a^t of haman legiflatima 
cannot accelerate or retard the rr volution of the feafons, thofe who pre- 
fer moor-fowl to muttcn, ihould keep their lands m their own pofTeflion ; 
for while they are held in leal'e, the tciAnts mufl be allowed to ut*e the

female aduallj attempted the. execution of it, and would probably hare 
ciTeAed her puipofe, had he not interpofed his hand between his throat 
and a reaping fickle, with which (he was armed. His fingers were cut to the 
bone. The glore which he wore was carefully preferred, as a memorial 
of the providential efcape he had made. Another woman who was pre- 
fent, exclaimed, find no blood, and her advice was followed. It was re* 
marked by the country people, that the intending aflbflin never profpered 
afterward, and that by her own hand (he terminated a life which (he 
felt herfelf unable to endure. At lengthy after the ftruggle in the parilh 
bad continued about la years, Mr Macmtllan retired voluntarily, and 
became an itinerant preacher, an^ founder of the Ce€t of the Macmillaa-

Mackie entirely overcame the averfion of his people, and lived long 
among them refpeAed and ufefiil. Some indeed retained, and fome ftiU 
retain, a prediledion for principles, in defence of which they have con- 
fidered their fiithers as having fuifered unjultly. But of the Diilentrrs ta 
Scotland in general, it may with troth be laid, that they are as induilri* 
ous and as peaceable members of fociety, as their fellow fnbjeds who 
belong to the £ftabli(hed Church. Perfedl unanimity on fpeculative pointi 
ts never to be ezpe^ed, and attempts to produce it by the application of

to all who invade not the rights of their neighbour, is worthy of an en*

of material fervice to Galloway. Still, however, it is to 
be regretted, that* it is neither fo fhort nor lb level as it 
might have been made. It has been fiud of it, that it 
feems well adapted to the purpofes of a military road, be-

Union of Farms. — As the climate is unfavourable for 
any other than green crops, and the farms eztenfive, a few 
of the mpft adventtirous of the inhabitants, about 35 years 
back, began each to take farms, which were formerly oc* 
cupied by 4 tenants, and to turn, iheic attention to th6 
rearing and jobbing of black cattle ; a ihort time thereaf- 
ter, a of the heritors introduced a few low countrymen, 
who rented fheep-fiurms in their own country, and were

Che fiurms flocked with flieep are more calculated for tfaeia

but I am apt to imagine, that upon the whole the decreafe

two villages in the parifli inhabited by 184 fouls at prc-

ring the winter months, and half of the fpring, are em*

ring-fiibing. There are 30 boats annually employed by 
the fmall tenantry living upon Lochfine fide in the her- 
ring-filhing ; each boat requires 4 hands, and from what 
I can learn, every one, on an average, clears from L. 20

fometimes very bad fevers among the lower dais, conv 
mencing generally in the fpring months, which are fprcad 
and continued by their vifits and intercourfe with one an- 
other, and often prove very mortal. 

Rents. — The valued rent of the pariflx is L. 3531 Scots ; 
the real grols rent for the year 1793 about L. 5700 Ster- 
ling. There is only a (mall portion of the pariih furveyed, 
fo that the rent the acre cannot be afcertained. The heri- 
tors have been very aflive for the laft 10 years in meliora- 
ting their property with march-walls, and endofures, which 
have greatly enhanced their value ; for the tenants pay 
without a grudge ^i per cent, for any money expended in 
thefe improvements ; which clearly point them to be the 
beft mode of improving their country. I muft do them 
the juftice to fay, that fome of them have been very atten- 
tive to beautify the pariih by planting, for there are feve^ 
ral coniiderable belts, and dumps of various kinds of tim-» 
ber, planted on different parts thereof, which at prefect ex- 
hibit a beautiful and agreeable variety to the traveller, aad 
will be a fnture fund of profit and advantage to the cftates 
wherein this improvement was adopted *.

former are very inadequate to the confumption of the peo- 
ple ; but with the aid of the latter, they fubiill themfelvea 
for eight months of the year. 

5/ori.— There are 490 horfes, 3200 black cattle, 12,000 
flieep. I cannot aicertain the yearly fales with any preci- 
lion ; but fo far as I can learn, the average prices of the 
horfes reared in the parilh, taking good and bad, for the 
fix years ending 1792, were from L. 6 to L. 6, 6 s. each ; 
that of the black cattle from L. 2, 15 s. to L. 3 Sterling; 
the lambs brought from 3 s. to 5 s. Sterling ;* the hogs from
