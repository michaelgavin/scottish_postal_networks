<p>
Origin of the Name. 

TT Is eftabifhed by records, prior to the 1226, that the 
ancient name of the town, which communicates its name 
to the parifh, was Elgyn, or Helgyn *. Various etymologiesi, 
and interpretations of it,^ have been fuggefted. Whitaker 
, Vol. V. A fays, 



* Cartularium Moravienfe, ,Fol. 5. v. Befides the town, there is an ex- 
tenfive country parifh, about lo Englilh miles in length, and fix in breadth,

fays *, that Elgyn fignifies a peninfula or cherfonefus ; and 
Bullet afferts f , that El is a town, and gin agreeable. But 
were thefe derivations juft, the fame name would have 
been applied to an infinite number of places, in fimilar li- 
tuations, which is far from being the cafe. It is more 
probable, therefore, that it derives its origin from Helgy, 
general of the army of Sigurd, the Norwegian Earl ot 
Orkney, who, about 927, conquered Caithnefs, Sutherland, 
Rofs and Moray. It is faid, that he built a town in the 
fouthern part of Moray, which, it is probable, was Elgyn, 
particularly as it is fituated to the fouth of DufFeyrus, or 
the burgh in DufFus, where the Norwegians had a harbour 
for their ftiipping %. Many Norwegian princes were alfo 
named Helgy, and the infcription upon the town feal 
is, " S. commune civitatis de Helgyn," engraved in Saxon 
charafters, in a ftyle earlier than the middle of the fix- 
teenth century. 

Cajile. — In thofe ages a caftle was always neceffary to 
protedt any town, and one was probably built, at an early 
period, for the defence of Elgyn. In the reign of Wil- 
liam the Lyon of Scotland, there was a royal fort on a 
rifing ground, now called Ladyhill || ; the ruins of which 
are ftill vifible. 

°Ihe Borough. — At what particular period, Elgyn was e- 
redted into a royal borough, does not appear. The fii-ft

charter, in the" archives of the town, is from Alexander II. 
anno 1234, who grants to the burgeffes of Elgyn, a guild 
of merchants, with as extenfive privileges as any other bo- 
rough enjoys in Scotland. 

It was the policy of the fovereign, in the middle ages, to 
give great privileges and immunities to the towns, for the 
purpofe of balancing the dangerous power, which had been 
acquired by the nobles. But when the regal government 
became at any time feeble, thefe towns, unequal to their 
own proteaion, placed themfelves under the flicker of the 
moft powerful lord in their neighbourhood. Thus the 
town of Elgyn found it neceffary at various periods, be- 
tween the years 1389 and 1452, to accept of many char- 
ters uf proteftion, and difcharges of taxes, from the Earls 
of Moray, who .held it in fome fpecies of vaffalage At 
laft, Charles I. in 1633, eftabliftied and' confirmed all the 
grants of his royal predeceffors, in favour of the borough ; 
and the fet, or form of its government, was ratified by the 
convention of boroughs, in 1706*. 

BiJJjoprick. — At the beginning of the eleventh century, 
the biftiops in Scotland wore blue gowns, with their hair 
tucked under a cap f, and, having no particular diocefe 
alFigned them, were itinerant. The precife time, that Mo- 
ray was erected into a biiTioprick, is uncertain, the char- 
tulary going no farther back than the 1200 ; but it appears, 
that before that period, the bifliops occafionally employed 
the churches of Bruneth or Birney, of Spyny and Kinnedor, 

as 

* Elgyn has been frequently deftroyed by fire ; but, for hiftorical fadls, 
Shaw's Hiftory of the Province of Moray, muft, in general, be referred to.

as cathedrals, and refided near ihem * ; and that bifliop [ 
Briceus, foon after the 1200, had the cathedral eftablifhed j 
at Spjny. In 1224, Bilhop Andrew tranflated it to the i 
church of the Holj Trinity near Elgyn. This building j 
was deftroyed by Alexander, .Lord of Badenoch f . About I 
1397, however, it was begun to be rebuilt, but it was not ' 
finiflied till after the 1414. From the ruins which ftill re- 
main, it appears to have been a large and fplendid edifice, 
in the Gothic ftyle of architedlure, in length above 260 
feet, and above 34 feet broad, and was not furpaflcd in 
beauty, by any building, of that nature, in the kingdom J. 

The revenues of this biflioprick, were not contemptible, 
even prior to the 1239-, but afterwards, in confequence 
of royal grants, and private donations, they became very 
confiderable indeed. On the eve of the Reformation, 
feveral eftates were feued off at low ftipulationsj yet the 
remainder would now produce a yearly income of above 
L. 4000 Sterling. In 1565, the rents were, L. 273 : 16 : 2 
Sterling, 10 bolls of wheat; 41 chalders, 7 bolls,"2 firlots 
farm bear ; 23 chalders, 3 bolls dry multure 5 13 chalders, 
II bolls of oats with, ftraw ; 60 marts, or fat beeves ; 162

\ A large fpace of ground was furrounded with a high wail, in many 
places vet entire, which inclofed wh.it is now called the college, and con-

Surface and Soil. — The furface of this parifla is flat, with 
little variety from riling grounds, except towards Black- 
hills, where the fields gradually afcend. The foil varies ; 
here, a rich loam, there, a clay, but, in general, it is fandy, 
abounding with calcareous particles, and, on the whole, is 
fertile, producing plenty of grain, and of good quality. 
Within thefe few years, the quantity of palture is enlar- 
ged, and abundance of hay raifed, by the introdu£lion of 
artificial gralTes. This is greatly promoted by a climate 
friendly to vegetation, wliich, at the fame time, gives fo 
little interruption to the operations of the hulbandman, 
that, it is reckoned, there are about three months more, of 
fair weather here, than in many places of the neighbouring 
county of BanlF. 

Agriculture. — Even in very remote times, the cultiva- 
tion of the foil feems to have been properly attended to, 
in this part of vScotland : Our hiftorians, it is- true, chiefly 
employ themfelves in retailing legendary ftories, or giving 
inaccurate accounts of foreign or domeftic wars, and poli- 
tical contefts, overlooking unfortunately, the more impor- 
tant details of induftry, trade, and population. In an in- 
veftigation of this nature, therefore, fcattered fads muft 
be colledled, and cafual and contingent fources of informa- 
tion relied on ; the refult of which, however, is, that this 
country was anciently well cultivated and produftive.

* To thele fadls, and the rental already mentioned, of the Biftiop of 
Moray's ellate in 1565, may be added the following evidence, arifing from 
the teftament of James Ogilvie of Findlater, dated 15th September 1565. 
In the inventory of his moveables, there are the following articles, " S* 
" drawing oxen; 28 fteers; 4S cows; 16 ftirks ; 18 calves; 400 (heep, 
" whereof 11 fcore ewes, and four fcore lambs: Item, fown on his Mains,

' bolls, eftimate to the fourth corn; of wheat 2i bolls, eftimate to the 

fourth corn ; of peafe, feven bolls : Item, in the barn-yards, three ftacks 
«« of bear, extending to fix fcore bolls bear; one ftack of oats, extending to 
«' fix fcore bolls of oats ; one flack of wheat, extending to 30 bolls wheat : 
«' Item, five work horfes." The original is among the Earl of Findlater's 
papers.

Thefe fa3:s tend to prove, that tillage, in thofe early 
periods, was attended to, and indeed confiderably advan- 
ced. It was probably in an improving ftate, until the ac- 
ceffion of James VI. to the throne. During his minority, 
and thence to the year 1620, Scotland in general, and the 
northern parts of it in particular, were torn by fa£li ns, and 
laid wafle by rapine and bloodlhed, piore than any other 
country in Eorope. When beginning to recover, the ci- 
vil wars in the reign of the unfortunate Charles I. the 
perfecutions under Charles II. and the famine in the reign 
of King William, materially affefted the induftry of the 
people ; fo thai" the nation did not breathe, in pea/ j and 
quiet, till the beginning of this century. Nor wa/^ it cu- 
red of its languor, till after the 1740, when the people a- 
woke, as it were, from a profound flumber. Within thefe 
laft 30 years, their induftry has become a''vtive, and, in ge- 
neral, has been diredled by intelligence. 

The prefent pradlice of farming, and fucceffion of crops, 
varies, according to the nature of the foil, and the genius of 
the farmer. Three plowings are generally given to a field 
for bear ; one after harveft, another in March, and a third 
in May, with the manure. The fucceeding crop is oats, 
with grafs feeds, or peafe, and next year it is drefled for bear, 
with a fprinkling of dung. Others, fallow, or have turnips 
or potatoes, which is followed by oats or bear, fowed down 
with grafs feeds. In very light foils, rye is fown after 
bear to great advantage, and the next crop is bear with 
manure and grafs feeds. Sometimes old leys are broken 
up in Auguft, and after another plowing in fpring, the 
crop is oats, and the fucceeding feafon bear, after three 
plowings and dung. 

This is the general rotation of crops. Fallows are daily 
becoming more univerfal, as are turnips, which feveral

farmers begin to ralfe on a large fcale, either to feed cattle 
for the butcher, or, which is found to be more advantageous, 
to give them to their young cattle, as it greatly improves 
their lize. 

The practice of fowing clover and rye-grafe, is daily 
gaining ground. Six pounds of red clover feed, and from 
8 to lo of white, with 2 buftiels of rye-grafs, is the general 
quantity to an acre. Hay is taken for two years, and 
pafture the third, and then the field is broken up for oats 
or barley, according to itS ftate. A few fow red clover 
alone, at the rate of about 20 pounds to the acre. 

Sowing wheat was much run upon, about 20 years ago, 
in this parifli and the neighbourhood, but now is juftly on 
the decline ; for the returns from the wheat, however high 
the price, did not compenfate for the injury done to the foil, 
by fo exhaufting a crop. 

Potatoes were introduced into the fields, about 60 years 
ago, and are now planted in ^reat quantities all over the 
country. Their quality, from the di-ynefs of the foil, is 
excellent, and the produce confiderable. Sometimes they 
are exported to Newcaftle, and other places. 

Mr Lellie of Balnagight, a very accurate obferver, has 
.lately adopted a method of managing a potatoe crop, which 
many imitate with fuccefs. It is this : He plows his po- 
tatoe field before winter, and, if the ground is full of 
weeds, propogated from the roots, he plows again before 
he plants. If not, he dungs as for barley, and plants early 
in March, putting the feed in every furrow after the plough, 
and harrows well immediately nfter. As foon as the 
weeds get up, and the potatoes begin to appear, (perhaps 
one in a fquare yard or two,) he gives ^t a third plowing 
and harrowing, about the firft of May, according as the 
plants are advanced. This culture, with one hoeing when

the weedi appear again, never fails to produce a good crop. 
But what is alfo of great advantage, it leaves the ground 
cleaner and mellower, and in a fitter condition for wheat, 
or any other crop, than a complete fallow. Thofe who 
grudge the few feeds, that may be turned up by the plough 
or the harrow, have only to caufe a boy replace the plants, 
on the face of the furrow, where it may be neceflary. 

A confiderable quantity of grain, of different kinds, has 
been annually exported from Moray in general, principally 
from the ports of Findhorn, Loffiemouth, and Germach, to 
London, Leith, and the mouth of the canal at Carron. Laft 
year, above 10,000 bolls were fliipped from thofc ports. 
This is almofl: the firft export in any quantity, fince 1783, 
when by the failme of the crop in 1782, about 100,000 
bolls of corn and meal were imported to both fides of the 
Moray frith. 

The whole low part of the county df Moray is fruitful 
in corn, and the parlfti of Elgyn, among the reft. Befides 
what is exported by fea, and fent to the Highlands, the 
licenfed flills in the county, confume a great quantity. 
There are 19 of thefe ftills, meafuring in all 635 gallons, 
which, by law, are in titled to diftill 3863 bolls of bear an-» 
nually, and a brewery, eftabliihed of late in this town, 
malts above 1500 bolls. Were the finuggling of foreign 
fpirits into this country effeftually fuppreffed, the exporta- 
tion of corn would probably greatly diminifli, if not total" 
ly ceafe. 

Many year's ago, the land was tilled by 6, 8, or 10 oxen, 
in a plough, and fometimes by 2 or 4 oxen, with 1 or a 
horfes. The late Sir Robert Gordon, of Gordonftown, 
about 30 years ago, introduced the practice of plowing with 
only two horfes, managed by reins, without a driver. This 

Vol. V. B tnodc

mode is now generally adopted, and, within thefe 12 years, 
2 oxen in traces, are alfo ufed by feveral farmers, and in 
the light foils, with fuccefe. For this reafon, and as the 
pafture is improved by artificial grafles, and green food 
being occafionally given them in winter, the breed of 
black cattle has been greatly improved, though in the coun- 
try at large, the numbers on the whole are diminilTied. 

12 Sterling is often paid for an ox raifed in this neigh- 
bourhood, and above L. 20 has been given for a fatted ox. 
Farmers, however, prefer in general, horfes for the plough, 
particularly when they are bred on their own farms, which 
is done by many. The ftyle of farming utenfils is greatly 
improved, in regard to ploughs, as well as carts and wag- 
gons. Two-horfe carts are coming into ufe. The average 
rent of the Scotch acre of arable land, in the immediate vi- 
cinity of the town, is from L. i, 10 s. to L. 2 Sterling, and 
in the country part of the parifti, it is from 15 s. to 18 s. 
Sterling ; but this varies, as a great proportion, perhaps too 
great, of the rents, is paid in bear and oats. Rents arc ad- 
vancing daily. The price of labour is amazingly raifed 
within the laft 30 years. Then a plowman had from 40 s. 
to 50 s. a-year \ and now they receive from L. 5 to L. 7 
Sterling, and other fervantsare paid in the fame proportion. 
There is no fuch thing as fervices exafted by any of the 
proprietors, in this parifti. 

The moft confiderable heritor is Lord Fife, next the Earl 
of Moray, &amp;c. There are great numbers of proprietors, in 
the immediate vicinity of the town, who have only fmall 
pieces of land belonging to them, and, in general, moft im- 
properly feparated, and detached ; fo that they cannot culti^ 
vate their grounds, to the fame advantage , as if they were 
more contiguous to each other. From this caufe, there are 
but few inclofures or hedges about the place. 

Commerce. 



ofElgyn.

Commerce. When King Alexander gave Elgyn the char- 
ter of guildry, there doubtlefs exifted fome foreign, as well 
as domeftic trade. It is certain, that in 1249, a Frencli no- 
bleman, (the Count de St. Paul and Blois,) had a fliip of wgjr 
built at Invernefs, at no great diftance from Elgyn *. It ap- 
pears, that in 1383, the burgeffes of Elgyn had a trading vef- 
fel, named Farcoft, that failed up the Loflie, which then had 
diredt communication with the loch of Spynie, at that time 
an arm of the feaf . This veflel was loaded with barrels of 
beer, tallow and flour. Iii thole days, alfo the bifhop's fifli- 
ing boats failed from the town and caftle of Spynie, to the 
Moray Frith |. In regard to the more recent commerce of 
Elgyn, about 40 or 50 years ago, it was principally carried 
on with Holland^ but now the trade is chiefly with London* 
Leeds, Manchefter, Birmingham, Newcaftle, Carron, &amp;c.&amp;.c. 
for the importation of manufa£lured articles, rather more than 
the country can well afford ; as the exports, independent of 
cattle, a few horfes and corn, are but confined, and moftly 
confift of dreft flcins for gloves, to the amount of between 
L. 300 and L. 40c-, and of linen yarn, to the value of about 
L. 2000 Sterling. There are now 44 fhaps opened in this 
town, principally for the fale of imported goods. 

In the end of laft century, and about the 1722, there was 

a confiderable export of malt, from this place to Norway. . 

There were then above 30 malt barns, always employed 
but the people at Dunbar fupplanted them greatly, and the 
malt tax completed its ruin. Gloves were made here, fome 
years ago, in great perfeftion, and a number fent to different 
markets. That^trade is much on the decline. The fpinning 

of

of lint has prevailed over a manufaflure of woollen ftufFs, 
which formerly exiflied in this town and parilh, toacon- 
fiderable amount. The great number of ftieep, then in 
the neighbourhood, did not fupply the demand, fo that it 
was neceffary to purchafe wool from the highlanders in 
Strathfpey, &amp;:c. The plantations of wood, and fown grafl'es, 
have thrown flieep fo much out. of the low country, that 
thirty years ago, more hundreds were annually fold out of 
it, than there are now fcores in it. The wool was then of 
a very fine ftaple, from a fmall wliite faced breed, and in- 
deed approached in quality to that of Shetland. Now the 
large bodied, black faced flieep, whofe fleeces are of a very 
rough and inferior nature, are in requeft among us. 

That fome eftimate may be formed of the occupations in 
this parilh, it may be proper to obferve, that in the country 
part, there are 9 tailors, 19 weavers, 9 wrights, including 
mill -Wrights, 5 flioemakers, and 7 blackfmiths. In the town 
are 16 blackfmiths, 70 weavers, 70 wrights, including ma- 
kers of ploughs and waggons ; 55 flioemakers, 32 tailors, 
8 glovers, 3 tinmen, 6 barbers, 4 bakers, 2 furgeons, and 2 
phyficians. There are alfo 2 tanners, who carry on their 
bufinefs, though not on a large fcale-, and a foapery, in which 
the partners propofe to manufacture a confiderable quantity. 

Funds of the Town. — The grofs amount of the public re- 
venue of the town, is about L. 2C0 Sterling, arifing from 
lands, feu-rents, petty cufl;oras of the markets, &amp;c. and from 
the village of Lofliemouth, of which the magifl;rate3 ac- 
quired the property, from the family of Brodie, in 1694. 
They poflTefled it many years, without any advantage. At 
length fome public-fpirited members of the magiftracy, 
propofed to improve the harbour, at the river mouth. From 
the funds of the town, and voluntary contributions of the in

of FAgyn. 



13 



habitants, with a grant from the Convention of Burghs, and 
other liberal donations, one jetty head has been eredled, aijd 
another carried out a confiderable way, but not completed. 
This has rendered the harbour more commodious, fo that 
veffels of 80 tons can now enter with a fpring-tide. The 
harbour could, without doubt, be much more improved, but 
this partial amendment has already encouraged a fpirit of 
building at that place. The town can give in all, 180 feus 
on their property there, of various meafurement, at the rate 
of from 5 s. to I guinea each, of yearly feu-duty. Sixty 
of thefe feus are already granted, more are daily taken, and 
many are adtually built on. 

Charitable Funds. — The guild-brethren, in 17 14, began 
the eftablilhment of a fund, for the widows of their decayed 
members. The yearly contribution, from each individual, 
is 23 s. but by their care and oeconomy, they have pur- 
chafed lands, in the vicinity, toa the mount of L. 76 Ster- 
ling, of yearly rent; and they have alfo fome money at inte- 
reft. But of this revenue, they diftribute L.40 annually in 
penfions to widows, and the remainder is added to the ca- 
pital. The fix incorporations of fmiths, glovers, tailors, 
flioemakers, weavers, and wrights, have alfo, each of them, 
various capitals, arifing from yearly affeffments, on their re- 
fpeaive brethren, for the aid of their poor, and decayed 
members and widows. Thefe capitals are from L.ioo, to 
L. 300 Sterling, and they have very properly followed the 
example of the guildry, by laying out their favings in the 
purchafe of lands and houfes. There are alfo two charitable 
foundations in the town, begun in 1785, and fubjeft to cer- 
tam regulations. The one is called the Friendly, and the other 
the 5t Giles's Society. The members of each contribute 
7 J. a month, and the funds' of the firfl amount to a- 

bout 



14 



Statijlical Account 



bout L.350, and of the other to about L.230 Sterling. 
The town, from mortified money, diftributes yearly a- 
bout L. 18 Sterling, which is under their management. 
They have alfo four beidmen, eftabliflied on the prc- 
ceptory of Meffindew, in their gift. Provoft Gumming 
alfo mortified lands, with houfes, for four decayed guild- 
brethren, to which his heir, and the magiftrates of Elgyn, 
prefent alternately. Each of thofe, fo prefented, have L. 2 
Sterling, quarterly, with a houfe and a fmall garden. Here 
alfo, it may be mentioned, among the other fources of cha- 
ritable donations, that there are two mafon-lodges, one of 
which is opulent. The Sunday colleftions amount to about 
L. 45 a-year, and the intereft of the money, under the manage- 
ment of the kirk-feffion, is L.8, 11 s. Sterling. Altogether, 
what is fet apart for charitable purpofes, in this town and 
parifli, amounts to no contemptible fum. 

Schools. — Inconfequence of fomeRoyal grants *, the magif- 
trates have been enabled to build two fchool-houfes, which are 

kept 

* Andrew, Bifhop of Moray, between the years 1225, and 1237, founded 
a. Domus Dei, near the brook Taok, and Leper-houfe at Elgyn, and efta- 
blifhed fome brethersjand fiflers in it, for charitable and pious purpofes; and 
endowed it, for that defign ; as did alfo King Alexander II. On the Re- 
formation, the Crown feized it ; and aid IVIarch IJ94, King James, by a 
grant, gave the magiftrates of Elgyn the lands and fuperiorities, belonging 
to this hofpital, or Domus Dei, vulg. Mejfmdew, for fupporting forae poor, 
agreeable to the defign of the original foundation. The magiftiates were 
appointed patrons. This \ya5 confirmed by a royal charter, Jth December 
1599. On the la-ft day of February, 1620, the magiftrates obtained another 
charter, under the sreat feal, confirming the original grant, and appointing 
them; not only to maintain a few poor out of thefe lands and fuperiorities, 
but, to fupport a fchoolmafter, " ad docendum muficaui, aliafque liherales 
" artes, intra diiium noftrum hurgum in pojicrum." The original charters 
are in the archieves of the town. Agreeable to this, the magiftrates have 
built, and kept in repair, a houfe for lodging four beidmen ; and give eacf^ 
of them four bolls of bear yearly, with a gown, and a fmall piece of garden 
ground. The reft of the fund is applied to the maintenance of fchools, 



ofElgyn. 15 

kept in proper repair. To one mailer, who teaches church- 
mufic, writing, reading, and arithmetic, they give L.io 
yearly. They have alfo eftabHflied a fchoolmafter for claf- 
fical learning, the teacher of which has L. 2i Sterling of fa- 
lary, arifing partly from this endowment, and partly from 
mortified money; to which the heritors of the town or 
country, contribute nothing ; fo that it is not a legal paro- 
chial fchool, though it anfwers that purpofe. 

The magiftrates, and fevral refpedable inhabitants, wifli- • 
ing to have the plan of education in the town enlarged, and 
that the children might be inftrudled in fome additional 
branches of learning, immediately under their own eye, 
have propofed a plan, for an academy in the t«wn, in 
which, not only reading Englifh, arithmetic, and clafiical 
learning, is to be taught, but Greek, French, geography, 
book-keeping, and various branches of the mathematics, 
with land-furveying, and drawing. The magiflxates have 
fubfcribed, for carrying this plan into efFe£l:,L. 42 Sterling a- 
year, and the inhabitants have contributed already about 
L. 500 Sterling; and, depending on the liberality of the pub- 
lic, have addreffed their friends at home and abroad to af- 
fift them, — There are alfo Sunday fchools eftablilhed in the 
town, and with fucceCj. 

Populatiofi. — The population of the parifli of Elgyn, ia 
the country part of that diftrift, is, from various caufes, 
conliderably on the dechne. The town, indeed, has increa- 
fedin the number of its inhabitants, but not of late in pro- 
portion to the decreafe in the country. The number of 
fouls, in the country parifli is 1614, divided into 377 fami- 
lies, among which are 43, that have but one pcrfon in each. 
In the town are 2920 fouls, divided into 658 families, of 
which 140 contain one perfon in each. The total number 

13 



i6 



Statijlical Account 



is 1035 families, and 4534 fouls, which is nearly 4^.10 a fa- 
mily. The return to Dr Webfter, from this parifh, being 
6306, fully proves to what an extent depopulation has been 
carried. 

The annual average of baptifms, for the laft 7 years, is, 
by the regifter, but 89. At leaft 15 more may be added, 
to fupply the deficiencies in the regifter, or thofe baptifed 
by feftaries. The annual average of marriages, for the fame 
period is 33. No accurate ftate of burials can be given *. 

Stipend. — The ftipend viftual of the parifti of Elgyn to 
each minifter, (it is a collegiate charge,) ftiould amount, by 
the decreet in 17 14, to 104 bolls of bear, but the aftual 
payments are only 103 bolls 2 pecks. The money ftipend 
to each, is L. 49, 9 s. Sterling, but in this are included L. 6, 
as the rent of half of the glebe, and L. 2, 2 s. as his ftiare of ' 
the rent of the ground for a manfe and garden. But from 
this fum is to be deduced lis. id. as the vicarage of the 
college, which does not nov? exift. There is no manfe, 
though the ground for building on, had been fet apart, with 
a fuitable garden. The Crown is patron of both livings. 
The congregation in the parilh church, is numerous and 

refpedablci 

• In 1643, a Ml- Douglas, town-clerk of Elgyn, by order, and at fight of 
the niagiftrates, and upon their credit, attefts, that, by the rolls at their muf- 
ture, there were only aucht fcore, (one hundred and fixty) able bodied tnen, 
fit for bearing arms in the town, and to pafs fix months, in fuch bufinefs ; and 
of thefe only fourfcore could be furniflied, with fnufcaths, pickes, gmwis^ 
halberds, denfaixes. or Lochaber aixes. This bears, to be taken up, by the 
direftion and warrant of the Committee of Eilatcs. There is another attef- 
tation in 1645, figned by the fame Douglas, and the Provoft and Council 
of Elgyn, that bears there were only fourfcore fenfible men within the 
burgh, many having fled from the town, for fear of their enemies. In this 
tteftatlon, the Provoft, after his name, adds Prfli/o/? of Hilgejnc. 



refpe6lable. There is alfo a feparate meeting, confifting 
partly of perfons belonging to this parifti, but principally 
from the neighbouring ones. They contribute L. 40 Ster- 
ling a-year to the maintenance of their clergyman. The Se- 
ceders have one, and the Epifcopalians two meeting-houfes. 
None of thefe are numerous ; neither are the Roman Ca- 
tholics, nor Metliodifts. 

Difeafes. — The difeafes mod prevalent, in this town and 
parifli, are fluxes, confumptions, and the King's evil. Chil- 
dren have the common routine of chincoughs, meafles and 
fmall -pox. The type of fevers is much changed within 
thefe laft thirty years. Before that period, the pleuritic and 
inflammatory kinds prevailed. Now, they are low, linger- 
ing, and nervous. This alteration may arife, from our 
wanting the hardinefs of our forefathers. Every thing 
cold is in difufe. Clothing is warmer. ' Warm liquors, as 
punch, tea, &amp;c. are the fafliion, even among the lower 
elafles. On the whole, we are become more efieminate ; and 
labour more fevere, whilft the mind is deprefled, from 
the anxieties of life, and the difficulty of procuring a fubfift- 



ence. 



The progrefs of the fcrophula is alarming, by intermar- 
riages, and the imperfea: cure of the lues, with a low 
diet. Confumptions are frequent among the young. Ma- 
nufadurers and tradefmen, in particular, are fubjed to 
them, from the nature of their employment. The women 
lead fedentary lives in fpinning, from which arife obflruc- 
tions,&amp;c. that often terminate fataUy; and from the fame 
caufes, difficult labours are more common than formerly. 

Borough Lands. -Th^rt is a large field of arable land, to 
the weft of Elgyn, through which the Loffie runs, divided 
into what are called auchteen parts, but confifting oiftxty-fouvy 
^' C which

■which vary in extent from 4 to 6 acres each. Originally, 
they belonged to 64 diftinft proprietors, burgeffes of El- 
gyn. The foil of a great part of this ground is good, being 
a rich loam, over a clay bottom ; and the whole might be 
greatly improved, were the feparate parts thrown into one 
connefted field; but they lie in run-rig, and fo disjoined, 
that different portions, of the fame lot, may be almoft an 
Englifli mile afunder. The Loffie is making great encroach- 
ments on fome of them ; and as they ftill are the property of 
a number of different perfons, though many of them have 
been acquired by one individual, no common meafure hasbeen 
adopted, to imbank the river, which might be done by 
piles, at a fmall expence. Thefe havocks of the river, have 
difcovered in different places, a foot or two thick of excel, 
lent peat mofs, buried from 4 to 6 feet, under the loam and 
clay. It is uncertain, who originally granted thefe lands to 
the 64 burgeffes of Elgyn. Tradition has uniformly re- 
ported, that they were given, as a compenfation, to the fami- 
lies of men who had fallen in battle, on fome important oc- 
cafion *. 

Plufcarden. — The ruins of the priory of Plufcarden, in 
the weft end of this parifh, are truly magnificent. The 
church was never completed, as the foundations of the weft 
part of the crofs were only laid. There are fmall pieces of 
frefco painting, that remain under an arch in the church, 
which are tolerably accurate in the defign, and the colours 
lively. The mill .for grinding their corns, was within the 
high free-ftone walls, that furrounded their burying-ground, 
§cc. ' Their gardens were excellent. A fig-tree was there

a few years ago, which annually produced fruit. The Gleii 
of Plufcarden, after pafliiig through the hands of many pro- 
prietors, has become the property of Lord Fife. 

Mifcellaneons Obfervations. — In the year 1754, a fliip 
loaded with coals, came to Lofliemouth. The demand was 
then fo fniall, that the importer could not difjpofe of 100 
barrels. Now, the demand is fo great, that upwards of 
twenty fliips arrive with Englilh coals, and fix with Scotch, 
and it is daily encreafing. It is particularly unkind in go- 
vernment, not to fay opprcjjive, that thofe who are necelTa- 
rily fubjefted to a high freight, and an inland carriage, 
fliould pay an exorbitant duty on that indifpenfible accom- 
modation of life, from which thofe at the pit mouth are 
exempted. It is an odious difcrimination of the fubjefts of 
the fame kingdom, and, in its effects, it is equally hollile to 
the agriculture and the manufaftures of the country. 

The inhabitants of the towns, in the northern parts of 
Scotland, are tolerably induftrious •, but, in general, they have 
not as yet eftablilhed any manufacture, for employing young 
children, and giving them early habits of induftry, which 
would operate greatly in their favour through life. A pin- 
work, or any fuch employment, that demands no great ca- 
pital, and yet requires a number of feeble hands, would be 
of the greateft confequence, and produce happy effedts. 

Throwing a bridge over the Spey, would open the com- 
munication between the north and fouth, would facili- 
tate the land-carriage of goods, and would prove of Angular 
advantage to the traveller ; fo that it is, in fa£t, a national 
object, to have this fpeedily accomplidied. 

The hiftory of a plantation of common firs, made by the 
late Lord Fife, many years ago, deferves notice. It is in the 
vicinity of the boat of Bog, near the Spey. It was twice 

planted

planted over, and as often failed, from its northern expofure, 
the neighbourhood of the fea, and a fterile foil. A fagacious 
country gardener raifed a nurfery on the moft expofed place of 
this plantation, from which he took the plants, and they 
throve well. By this mode, were it uniformly adopted, plan- 
tations might be raifed, even within the reach of the fea fpray, 
or on any expofure, the plants being habituated, in early life, 
to their lituation. There is mofs, in many parts of Scotland, 
at flood-mark; and, in North America, trees grow within 
the reach of fpring tides. 

It may not be improper, to conclude this paper, withfome 
obfervations on the caufes of depopulation, in fome parts of 
Scotland, by which this diftridt in particular feems to be 
diftinguiflied. 

1. Our Handing armies, from diffipation and .other caufes 
are hoftile to marriage, and the rearing of children ; nor 
are the children produced, in general, either healthy or 
long lived. A great navy, and multitudes of failors em- 
ployed in foreign commerce, miaft have the fame elFe6l. 

2. Increafe of manufa6lures. It is allowed, that where 
manufafturing families are fcattered over a country, and I 
each of them has a few acres of land, in the culture of I 
which they are occafionally employed, a numerous and ' 
healthy breed is the neceffary confequence. But when num- 
bers are cooped up, in ill-aired . low, damp houfes, neither the i 
parents, nor the children are healthy. Befides, a fedentary, 
and confined fituation, is adverfe to longevity, and to a healthy 
progeny. 

3. Sheep farms in the Highlands of Scotland, and in other 
places, have obliged numbers t6 emigrate ; and when once a 
country becomes depopulated, by the removal of it's native 
inhabitants, it requires ages to recruit them. 

4. In the Lowlands, the fpirit of the times, has introduced 
a fyltem, of converting many fmall, into one large farm.

The individual, who occupies fuch a farm, having fewer 
mouths to maintain, can afford, perhaps, a greater rent, than 
what many families, on the fame furface of ground, could 
pay at once. But the population being thus greatly dimi- 
niflied, the value of the property may, in procels of time, 
fuffer by it. Numbers, made fuperfluous by this meafure, 
flock into towns, where with difficulty, they earn a fcanty 
fubfiftence. They, no doubt, increafe the population of 
thefe towns-, but towns, on aim oft anyfcale, are adverfe to 
either the keeping up, or the increafing of numbers. A 
country life was the original deftination of man, is the moft 
favourable to wealth and population, and ought, on every 
account, to meet with all poffible encouragement and protec- 
tion. The moft favourable fize of farms to make a country 
populous, is from 15 to 40 acres of arable land. The oc- 
cupiers of fuch farms marry early, as they have the prolpedt 
of bread, if they are induftrious. But when farms are over- 
grown, they are moftly inhabited by fervants and day-la- 
bourers ; and every meafure is tried to keep wages and the 
price of labour low, by which marriage is difcouraged. 
Day-labourers then become afraid of marrying, and fervants 
very feldom can; and thus the numbers of a healthy pealan- 
try are daily diminillied. 

5. Thefe circumftances alfo lead to emigration, and to this 
it may be added, that incited by the profpedl of making a 
fortune, as it is called, the flower of our young men, of every 
clafs and dcfcription, go abroad; and for one, who returns 
in a comfortable fituation, and raifes a family, how many 
hundreds, I had almoft faid thoufands, drop by the road. 
Their wealth, however accumulated, cannot furely compen- 
fatc for the lofs of fo many citizens ; indeed, fcarcely re- 
paying the original expence of fitting them out.

Laftly, luxury and its certain attendant , an exorbitant ex- 
pence of living, moft materially alTefts population. It dif- 
courages marriage, until perfons acquire an income, adequate 
in their eftimation, to that ftate ; or, in other words, until they 
are advanced in years, and then a puny helplefs race of chil- 
dren is produced. Hence, how many men of every defcrip- 
tion remain fingle ? and how many young women of every 
rank are never married, who, in the beginning of this cen- 
tury, and even fo late as the 1745, would have been the 
parents of a numerous and healthy progeny?

    TOWN AND PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q420303">MONTROSE</name>. 
(county of ANGUS.) 
By the Rev. Mr Alexander Molleson.</head> 



<p>Origin of the Name. 

npHE ancient name of Montrofe feems to have been Ce- 
hirca *. Many derivations have been affigned for 
its modern appeUation. The moft probable is from the 
Gaelic, in which language Moinrofs fignifies " the fenny pro- 
" montory," and it is called by ^the vulgar, Monrofs to this 
day f. Buchanan and others, have given it a derivation 
more flattering than juft, when they affert, that it proper- 
ly means the Mount of Rofes (Mons Rofarum). Yet, in 
allufion to this fancifiil derivation, the feal of the town is 

imprefled 

* See Boethius. To this name alfo Johnfton alludes in the following 
lines : * 

" Auieolis urbs pidla rofis ; mons, molliter urbi 

" Immmet; hinc urbi nomina fada canunt:

irnprefled with rofes *, and the motto is, " Mare ditat, rofa 
" decorat" (the fea enriches, and the rofe adorns). 

Situation. — This parilh is fituated in the prefbjtery of 
Brechin, in the fynod of Angus and Mearns, and in the 
county of Angus or Forfar. It may be confidered under 
two heads, the town and the country diftri(3:. We fhall be^ 
gin with giving a concife account of the country part of 
the parifli. The town will require a more minute and parti- 
cular defcription. 

I . Country diJlriB. 

Extent, ISc. — The length of the parifli, from north to 
fouth, is about 3 Englifli miles. Its breadth from eafl: to 
weft, is about 2|. The general appearance of the diftrift is 
flat ; but towards its northern extremity it rifes gradually, 
and terminates in a hill of no very confiderable height, called, 
thehillofMontrofe.Thecountry in the neighbourhood, being 
fertile and well cultivated, affords a delightful profpecl in 
almoft every part of this parifli. A beautiful and extenfive 
expanfe of Ocean ; fliips frequently failing in all diredlions 
the town and bafon of Montrofe ; the arches and ornaments 
of the bridge of Dun ; the windings of the river Southelk, 
with the rich fields upon its banks ; the charming valley of 
Strathmore ; a number of gentlemen's feats, and the plan- I 
tations around them ; the venerable fteeples of the ancient 
city of Brechin, and the celebrated Grampian hills ftretch- 
ing from the German Ocean, farther to the weft, than the eye 
can penetrate, muft charm every traveller of tafte. They af- 
ford alfo a permanent entertainment, to every inhabitant 
of Montrofe, who takes a pleafure in contemplating the fub" 

Jime and variegated works of nature.

Jliyers. — To this painfti belong two very confiderable rivers. 
The one, the Northelk, feparatesthe fliire of Angus from that 
of Kincardine or the Mearns, and runs through the north- 
ern extremity of the parifli, into the German Ocean. The 
poft-road from Montrofe to Aberdeen, crofling this river 
near its mouth, and the ford, often varying, it frequently 
proved fatal to travellers ; the inhabitants of Montrofe, ex- 
cited by the activity of Alexander Chriftie, Efq; provoft at 
that time, and aided by a generous public, together with a 
liberal donation from the annexed eftates, built, in 1775, a 
handfome bridge, confifting of feven arches, acrofs this ford. 
This bridge is of great advantage to the neighbouring 
country, and opens, upon the eaftern coaft, an eafy commu- 
nication with the northern part of this kingdom. The river 
fometimes fwells to a great height ; and, as its banks are low, 
the adjacent fields in thisparifh, fufFer, on fuch occafions, con- 
fiderable damage. The proprietors, however, cannot com- 
plain, for it fertilizes their lands, and the falmon fifliing ou 
both fides renders their eftates much more valuable, than they 
would otherwlfe be. The Southellc feparates this parilli 
from that of Craig. After many beautiful meanders, gli- 
ding through the bafon, and pafling by the harbour of 
Montrofe, this river falls into the German Ocean, about a 
mile from the town. 

Over this river it is propofed to make a bridge, firft from 
the Fort hill to the ifland of Inchbrayock, and then a fmall 
one, from Inchbrayock to the lands of Craig. Eftimates 
have already been given in, of one bridge with the piers of 
ftone, and the reft of wood, of another entirely of wood, and 
of a third intirely of ftone. Subfcriptions, to a confiderable 
amount, have been obtained, and an aft of parliament ha- 
ving alfo palTed laft fefTion for that purpofe, this great work 
will probably foon be accomplilhed. It is certainly a great 
Vol. V. D undertaking 



26 



Statijlical Account 



undertaking for fuch a placq; but it will doubtlefs contribute 
much to the advantage of Montrofe, will add to th-. va- 
lue of lands in that neighbourhood, and, if the roads are once 
put in proper order, wdll be an additional inducement, to 
bring the mail-coach, along this coaft, to the north of Scot- 
land, the benefit of which will be very great. 

Bafon. — The bafon of Montrofe is a beautiful piece of 
water, nearly circular, and about three miles in diameter. At 
low water, it is moftly dry, but at high water, it has a charm- 
ing effedl from the weft fide of the town, waflies the garden- 
walls, and tends much to the cleanlinefs of the place. Vef- 
fels, of 50 or 60 tons burden, come to the eaft and weft fide 
of the bafon, without any rifk. This is of great advantage 
to the furrounding heritors, as they can bring lime and coals^ 
by water, very near their different eftates. 

In the laft century, an attempt was made to cut off a con- 
fiderable part of the bafon, and convert it into arable land, 
by running a dike from near the Fort hill, along the bank of 
the river Southelk, towards the eftate of Dun, The fcheme 
was nearly carried into execution ; and, as the foil is a ftrcng 
clay, it would have been very advantageous to the proprie- 
tors. But the perfons who had the management of this un- 
dertaking, quarrelling among themfelves, the work went on 
but flowlyi and when the dike was nearly completed, a 
ftorm arofe, and levelled the whole with the ground. The 
foundation of this dike is ftill vifible, and the fcheme ap - 
pears rational ; but all thoughts of carrying it into executi(jn, 
even on a fmaller fcale, feem, at prefent, to be abandoned. 
Some houfes in the town, are known to have been built of 
ftones, which compofed a part of this dike. It is ftill called 
the Iirai?iers dike.

State of Property, l^c. — The country part of the parifh, be- 
Udes many fmail feus, is divided into eight larger properties; 
of theff, the eftate of Kinnabar, which once belonged to the 
famiij of Montrofe, one of whofe titles, to this day, v\ Baron 
of Kinnabar, is the moft confiderable. It is rendered more 
valuable by the fiftiing, and the improvement of fome wafte 
ground. The prefent manfion-houfe is undergoing confi- 
derable repairs, and lies in a romantic elevated fituation, 
furrounded by trees. The foil of Kinnabar, and of the eftates of 
Charleton, Newmanfwalls, Borrowfield, and Hedderwick, 
is, in general, very good, and cultivated with fpirit, accor- 
ding to the beft fchemes of modern improvers. Even where 
the low lands have a light foil, as they have long received 
town manure, they are very produftive of all kinds of 
grain and turnips, efpecially, when, before breaking up. they 
are clayed upon the grafs. The upper grounds, are, in 
general, of a thin and muirifli foil, but much improved, 
of late, by the above manure, and lime from the adjoining 
parifh. 

The valued rent amounts to L. 2200 Scotch, or L. 183, 
6s. 8d. Sterling. There are in the parifli about 3080 acres 
occupied as follows :

No earths ufeful in manufaftures have as yet been difco- 
vered, except clay for bricks, which is very good for that 
purpofe. The trees are moftly young, and principally con- 
fift of planes, elms, birch and larix. 

Mineral Sp7-iugs. — There are feveral fprings in this parifli, 
of the chalybeate kind, but none of them ftrong. There 
is one nigh the town, of a diiFerent fort, which is certainly 
worthy of a chymical analyfis. About 50 years ago, Dr 
Thomfon, phyfician in Montrofe, made a variety of experi- 
ments on the water of this well, by which it appears, that it 
bears aconfiderable refemblance to that of Scarborough, and 
has nearly the fame qualities j notwithftanding which, it has 
not been of late much frequented bj ftrangers, nor even by 
the people of Montrofe. Other wells are more reforted to, 
not, perhaps, becaufe they are more efficacious, but becaufe 
they are at a greater diflance, and in greater vpgue with 
people of fafhion. 

Sea Coajl. — As far as this parifh extends, the ihore is 
fandy and very level. There are no rocks or currents, 
from the mouth of the one river to that of the other. The

tide of flood runs S. W. along the fliore. The two neareft 
head lands are the Red-head on the fouth, and the Tod- 
head on the north. At the former, with olF-fliore winds, 
the anchorage is very good.r.— In the beginning of this 
century, hdwever, a fleet of merchant ihips, failing to a 
Dutch fettlement, with ftores of all kinds, were wrecked 
upon this northern coaft, and one or two were loft in the 
mouth of the Northeik. 

2. I^own of Montrofe. 

Situation, %£c. — The latitude of the town of Montrofe is 
36° 34' north ; and its longitude from London is 2^ 10^ 
weft. It is pleafantly fituated on a gentle eminence in a 
peninfula, formed by the bafon, the river Southelk and the 
German Ocean. The neck, which connefts with the main- 
land on the N. E., formerly, muft have been much nar- 
rower than at prefent ; as, from the appearance of the 
links, it is evident, that the fea has retired from its former 
limits, almoft a mile. This is the voice of tradition, to 
which every fpeftator muft aflent. 

Air, Difeafes, i^c. — From the fituation of Montrofe, it 
may naturally be imagined, that the atmofphere is replete 
with aqueous particles, and very piercing in cold wea- 
ther, and when the wind is f^om the eaft. But, as the 
town is built, on a fandy dry foil, and there are hardly any 
ftagnant waters or lakes in the neighbourhood, it is not 
fubjeft to thofe march miafmata, which occafion agues and 
fevers. The moft prevalent difeafes of Montrofe, are, of 
the chronic fort, fuch as, rlieumatifm, toothach, fore-throat, 
fcurvy, fcrophula, &amp;c. Phthifis pulmonalis, frequently pro- 
ceeding from fcrophula interna, is not uncommon in this 
place. The hypochondriac, or hyfteric difeafe, prevails 

much, 



3° 



Stati/lical Account 



much among all ranks, efpecially the vulgar. When fevers 
occur, they are almoft conilantly of the nervous tribe. Eve- 
ry malady proceeding from a relaxed ftate of the fibres 
prevails here. This relaxation is occafioned, by our at- 
mofphere being replete with marine vapours, and a copious 
mephitic exhalation, emitted from the bafon, when the 
water retires. From this account, putrid difeafes might 
be fuppofed to be among our endemics, but they are not. 
The true putrid fore-throat is a rare diftemper here ; and 
our nervous fevers, unlefs neglefted, or improperly treated, 
rarely affume the putrid diathefis. The humidity of our 
atmofphere is probably corre£led by a confiderable mix- 
ture of faline particles. — The water is excellent, and to be 
had in abundance. It is conveyed about 3 miles in pipes 
of lead, and iffiies from wells in different parts of the 
town. 

Antiquitm. — Among the few antiquities, which Montrofe 
can boaft of, the Fort hill, which takes its name from the 
caftle, built on its fummit, deferves to be particularly men- 
tioned. From its polition, it was well adapted to command 
the town, the harbour, and the fhipping in the river. The 
main current of the river probably flowed, in former times, 
on the other fide of the ifland of Inchbrayock, and it has 
evidently made tery confiderable encroachments on this 
hill. A well was difcovered a few years ago on the brink, 
and, when the water is clear and fmooth, another has been 
feen a good way into the river. Both of them, in all pro- 
babUityj have been once within the fort. The inhabitants 
remember, that the river at the Fort hill was not near fo 
deep, nor fo broad, as at prefent. Tradition fays, that in an- 
cient times, perfons on the oppofite banks could almoft 
^ake hands. Another memorable and valuable piece of 

antiquity 



of Montr of d, 



antiquity belonging to Montrofe iv an hofpital, or maifo?i de 
Dieu, which has been ailowed to go to ruin ; but the reve-. 
nues are prefervecl, and are under the management of the 
Town council, and a mafter of the hofpital of their ap- 
pointment. One of the moft ancient houfes in the towp, 
(now belonging to, and poffeiTed by Mr Scott of Logie), 
is famous for being the houfe, where the celebrated Mar- 
quis of Montrofe was born and in which the pretender 
flept on 13th February 1716, the night before his 
efcape. Next morning he went on board a frigate, which 
lay in the road, and conveyed him fafe to France. 

Population. — ^The following ftatements will pretty clearly 
prove a progreflive increafe of population.

ending 177c. ending 1790,

Burials, 118 i5o 

The lifts of marriages and burials may be depended 
on. The lift of baptifms is as exadl as could be pro- 
cured. But the inattention of parents, and the backward- 
nefs of many to pay the fchoolmafter his dues, is a matter 
of very general complaint throughout Scotland, and contri- 
butes to render fuch lifts lefs accurate, than might be wifti- 
ed. If we multiply 127, which was. the number of bu- 
rials from ift January 1685, to ditto 1686, by 36, the 
panfh, at that time, would contain about 4572 inhabitants. 
A.ccording to this method of computation, the number of 
fouls, from 1740 to 1750, were, at an average, only 4248 
nu, from 1780 to 1790, they increafed confiderably. 

The following lifts were extraded from the minifter's 
parifti rolls, which are made up with all poffible accuracy :

When it is confidered, that the manufadture of canvas, 
fince the peace of 1783, has been, in a great meafure, given 
up, and, that trade, fince that time, has not been verybriflc 
in Montrofe, it will be acknowledged, that the population 
in this town, has, of late, increafed, more than might have 
been expedted. Gloomy fpeculatifts predidted, at the con- 
clufion of the American war, that many would emigrate ■ 
from this corner. A very few did emigrate, and thefe 
few have given no encom-agement to others to follow their 
example. 

Puhlic Buildings. — The public buildings in Montrofe- 
moft worthy of notice, are, i. The old town-houfe, which 
is fituated in the middle of the principal ftreet. A part 
was fitted up for the grammar-fchool, and a part for the 
public priibn. As the rooms and cells in the prifon were 
too few, and ill-contrived, this houfe is repairing, in fuch 
a manner, that men and women, debtors and criminals, 
may have feparate apartments, correfponding with their 
ftation and their crimes. 

a. The new town-houfe, built in 1763, towards the 
fouth end of Murray-ftreet, with its front diredted to the 
Port. It is conftrufted according to the modern tafl:e, with 
rooms, where the magiftrates aflemble, i^c. 

3. The Parifti Church. — The old church of Montrofe was 
a Gothic flirudbire, rendered very gloomy and irregular, by 
large additions to the galleries and 0 the building it- 
felf. It was originally, however, venerable and well pro-- 

portioned^. 



of Mont r of e.

portioned. Having fallen into decay, the heritors, town- 
council, kirk-fellion, trades, and proprietors of feats, agreed 
unanimoufly to build another in its ftead ; the dinaenfions 
of which, are 98' by 65 feet over walls. The plan has 
been formed with deliberation •, — it has been compared 
with modern churches j — it has been fubmitted to the in- 
fpeftion of fome Ikilful architeas; — and, it is to be hoped, 
will be executed in fuch a manner as to merit public appro- 
bation *. 

4. The Epifcopal chapel. — This chapel was founded in 
1722. It is an ornament to the town, and was even praifed 
by the author of the Rambler, in his Tour through Scot- 
land, as a neat and cleanly place of public worihi|). 

5. Public Schools. — In this town there are a great num- 
ber of private fchools, in which all ordinary branches of 
male and female education are taught; but the public 
fchools, patronifed by the town-council and kirk-feffion, 
are three. The grairimar-fchool, in which Latin alone is 
taught. The writing-fchool, in which, befides writing, 

are 

. * It is but juftice to the inhabitants of Montrofe, to take this opportu- 
nity of dating the very liberal and Chriftian-like manner, in which the dif- 
ferent fe6ls have uniformly condudled themfelves to each other. The 
town-council and feffion, lately petitioned the managers of the Epifcopal 
and Anti-burgher churches, that the members of the eftabli(hed church 
might have the liberty of enjoying divine fervice in their meeting-houfes, 
till the parifli-church was rebuilt. They, and their congregations, not 
only granted this petition, but declared, in the handfomeft manner, their 
■*illingnefs to fubmitto confiderable inconvenienciiss, in order to accommo- 
date their fellow Chriftians to their wifhes. It is not long fince the Anti- 
burgher congregation applied for liberty, to;have their minifter ordained in 
the eftablithed church, as their own was repairing at that time, and liberty 
was readily granted. Thus they have foon found an opportunity to exprefs 
their gratitude in kind, and given occafiau to remark, that a generous 
adlion may meet with a returii in a way little expeifled.

are alfo taught arithmetic and book-keeping. The Eng- 
liili fchool, in which are taught the reading of Englifli, ac- 
cording to the new method, and the principles of Englifli 
grammar. Some of the mailers of the public fchools, teach, 
in private, other branches, fuch as French, mathematics, 
geography and mufic. The public fchools were formerly 
in different rooms in the middle of the town ; but, two 
years ago, very handfome and fpacious fchools were built, 
in an open area in the links, where the boys and girls en- 
joy falubrious air, and have ample fcope for amufement, 
without endangering either their health or their morals. 

6. The Public Library. — Some literary gentlemen, eager 
to read a variety of publications, not to be had in the 
place, and which they could not conveniently purchafe, 
refolved to enter into a fociety, for the purpofe of forming 
a public library. It was begun in 1785, and is, at this 
time, in as flourifliing a condition as could well be expected. 
Such inftitutions, evidently tend to increafe knowledge, 
and to diffufe a tafte for learning, and therefore ought, as 
much as poffible, to be encouraged *. 

7. The Lunatic Hofpital. — This is one of the moft ufeful 
and patriotic inftitutions belonging to this or any other 
town. Before ft was built, the magiftrates were frequent- 
ly under the necefllty of confining lunatics in the common 
prifon, fituated in the middle of the town, where they were 
liable to have their diforders increafed, by the publicity of ' 
the place of their confinement, and often exhibited the 
moft fliQcking fcenes of blafphemy and defperation. At 

length,. 

* The public teaehers of youth and fludents at the univerfities, have the 
benefit of the library gratis. Convinced of its great utility, feveral gentle- 
men have already prefented to the library valuable books, and fome hav&amp; 
prefented works of their own compofition. 



of Montrofe.

iengtli.in 1779, Mrs Carnegie of Pittarrow, juftlj celebrated 
for her public fpirit, fuggefted the plan of a lunatic hofpi- 
tal, to be ere£ted in the links near Montrofe. By her in- 
fluence, a petition, iigned by fome perfons of diftinftion in 
the town and neighbourhood, was prefented to the magi- 
ftrates, requefting their aid for erefting fuch an hofpital ; 
and foon after, a fubfcription was opened for that purpofe, 
which fucceeded beyond expedlation. Sixty nine lunatics 
have already been admitted into the houfe, fome from 
places fo diftant as Perth, Aberdeen and Edinburgh, of 
whom 14 have been cured, 6 removed greatly better, 21 
died, and 28 remain in the hofpital *• 

Conjlitution 

* It is propofed, as foon as the funds will permit, to fit up a lick ward ; in 
the mean time, 57 patients, labouring under dangerous difeafes, have been 
taken into the hofpital, manyjof whom required chirurgical operations. Twen- 
ty fia have been cured, 10 relieved, 8 removed incurable, lo died, and 6 are 
under cure ; I324 out-patients have received advice and medicine gratis, 
410 of whom have been cured, 389 relieved, and 2 died. Such was the 
ftate of the hofpital at the beginning of 1790. As it was creeled by fub- 
fcription, it has been hitherto fupported by funds annually granted by the 
magiltrates of Montrofe, by coUedlions at the church and Epifcopal chapel, 
■by a coUedlion through the Synod of Angus and Mearns, and the voluntary

from the parifli of Montrofe have been admitted, gratis, and, frora other 
pariflies, whence liberal contributions have been received, at fo low a 
rate as L. 8, L. 7, L. 6, and even L 5 a- year. But, without further liberai;do- 
nations, and the continuance of annual fubfcriptions, the funds muft be ic- 
adequate to fupport the inftitution, in fuch a manner as its friends would 
.wifh. The medical gentlemen of Montrofe, give both advice and atten- 
ii&amp;nce gratis ; and the treafurer is equally difinterefted. The humanity and 
frugality of the matter and miftrefs, and the order and cleanlinefs of the 
lioufe, merit the higheft commendation. Several pieces uf coarfe (heeling 
•iiave been made, from the yarn fpun by the lunatics in their lucid intervals. 
At fuch times, they are alfo occafionally employed in painting, reading, 
|;ardening, knitting ftockings fpinning, and working with the needle. A 
piece of painting, in the miftrefs's room, done by one of the lunatics, is, as 
fach, a conliderable curioCty,

Conjlitution and Income of the Borough. — ^Montrofe is ^ 
royal borough, united with thofe of Aberdeen, Bervic, 
Brechin, and Arbroath, in chufing a member of Parliament, 
The corporation has continued in nearly the fame ftate, for 
about 450 years. It is compofed of 19 members, Wz. the 
provoft, 3 bailies, dean of guild, treafurer, hofpital mafter, 
10 merchant councillors, and i councillors from the trades. 
The old council eledl the new, and they may continue theni- 
felves, in office, as long as they pleafe to hold together. The 
conflitution requires no change of merchant councillors 
yearly ; but the 2 trades councillors muft be changed every 
two years. They may, however, be fucceeded by their pre- 
deceffors. The revenues of the town are not very ample, 
and have been confiderably burdened by building an ad- 
dition to the pier, making a new market for butchers 
meat, erefting lamps, improving public walks, fubfcribing 
to public works, building new fchools, and augmenting the 
number of teachers and their falaries, &amp;:c. ; but they are 
managed with care ; and if nothing unforefeen happens, wilj 
receive an addition not many years hence. The provoft 
has L. 40 yearly, allowed hira to defray the expences of 
making burgeHes, and entertainments on the King's birth- 
day, or at the eleftion of magiflrates, &amp;c. That ap- 
pears to be a very economical meafure, as probably, more 
than double that fum would be infufficient to defray thefe 
expences, without fuch a regulation. 

Commerce and MamifaBures. — As the harbour of Mon- 
trofe is the moft commodious of any, between the river 
Tay and the bay of Cromarty, the trade of this town, has, 
for a long time, been confiderable. In the beginning of: 
this century, and till about the year 1744, Montrofe was; 
diflinguilhed by its Ihipping. It was alfo famous for ai 

market ; 



of Montr of e.

market for linen jarn, which was brought from all parts 
of the counties of Angus and Mearns, and fold here, whence 
it was fent to London and Manchefter. A great market, c^- 
led Rood lair, was held here in the beginning of May, which 
was formerly much reforted to, but is now much on the de- 
cUne. About 50 years ago fmuggling was much pradlifed here, 
and indeed almoft every where on the coafl of Scotland, 
and fcarcely any fort of manufa£kire w^s carried on. 

The lirfl; manufadlure, of any confequence, that of 
canvas, was eredled here by a company in 1745. It was 
carried on, for many years, to a great extent, and anfwered 
well. Soon after, it was followed by another company on 
a large fcale, and afterwards by many fmaUer ones, parti- 
cularly during the laft war. As the fame thing happened 
in other places in the kingdom, this article was fo much 
overdone, at the peace of 1783, that all the great companies 
here, and moft of the fmaller ones, gave up, turned their 
working-houfes into dwelling-houfes, and fold off their 
machinery and utenfils, &amp;c. Little, therefore, is now at- 
tempted in that line, compared with what was done before. 

During this period, two different companies fet up a large 
manufafkire of coloured and white thread, and were follow- 
ed by others on a fmaller fcale. One of the larger compa- 
nies has given up •, but the other continues, and has found it, 
as yet, a very profitable branch of bulinefs. It is at prefent 
the moft confiderable article of manufaaure in the town. 
Some brown flieetings and Ofnaburghs are alfo made here, 
and a pretty confiderable trade is carried on, in the commif- 
fion line, in Ofnaburghs and yarn fent to Glafgow. The 
cotton manufaflures have been lately attempted, and various 
fmaller articles, as (lockings, &amp;c. are manufadured. There 
is a good tannery, and rope- works belonging to different 
pompanies.

This town has been long diftinguifhed for making and ex- 
porting excellent malt, and for making good malt liquor of 
all kinds. A public brewery, efpecially forfmall beer, has 
been lately fet up. But private families, in general, brew 
for their own ufe. The ftrong ale made here, is efteemed, 
by good judges, equal to the Burton ale. 

To Montrofe, there belong, commonly, about i6 or 18 
fifhermen, but many of them are old, and for fome years 
paft they have had very indifferent fuccefs. Haddocks are 
juft now remarkably rare, and confequently extremely dear. 
The mufiels belonging to this place are excellent, both for bait 
and eating, and they are never dangerous. They are to be 
found in great plenty, all over the river and at the harbour. 
Oyflers have been laid in a deep part of the river, to try if 
they will fucceed there, but a fufficient time, for a full trial 
of the experiment, has not as yet elapfed. Incredible num- 
bers of lobfters were, fome years ago, taken on this coaft. Pen- 
nant, in histour (1772,) p. 2, mentions, that 60,000 or 70,000 
were, at that time, fent annually to London ■, but that branch 
of commerce is now laid afide, as not fufficiently advanta- 
geous. Quantities of white fifh, as cod, turbot, &amp;c. might be 
taken on the great fand banks off this coaft. The Long for- 
ties extend parallel thereto ; and beyond that, lie, Montrofa 
pits, (fee Hammond's chart of the North Sea), a great bank 
with lix pits in it. If we i-eckon from the furface of the 
water, they are from 40 to 100 fathoms deep. Thofe banks 
fwarm with fifh, but are neverthelefs much neglefted, At^ 
tempts have, indeed, been made for fome years paft, butunfucr 
cefsfully, owing to the mifcondudt of the perfons employed. 

There are at prefent 3 ftiips, belonging to Montrofe, con- 
cerned in the whale-fifhing bufmefs. They generally go to 
Davis Straits. The trade is very precarious, but they have, 
upon the whole, been more fuccefsful than many others. 



of Montrofe, 

At the harbour of Montrofe, there is a good wet dock 
where fhips are built and repaired, not onlj for this' but 
for other ports. 

In 1783, a plan was adopted, and patronifed by feveral 
gentlemen and merchants of Montrofe, for infuringlliips and 
goods at fea. It has been carried on ever fince. As there 
is alfo in this place a branch of the office at Dundee, for in- 
furing houfes and furniture againft fire, moft of the proper- 
ty, belonging to the inhabitants, maybe infured in the town 
itfelf. 

The port of Montrofe, which comprehends within its 
bounds, all the coaft, from the Tod-head on the north, to the 
lights of Tay on the fouth, had, in 1789, the following 
number of Ihips, and quantity of tonnage belonging to it.

Butyon Coals.— ThQ duty on Scotch and Englifli coal, paid 
in Scotland, amounts to about L. i i,ooo a-year. Of this fum, 
the diftrifts belonging to the cuftom-houfes of Aberdeen and 
Montrofe, pay the principal part. In the year 1788, Montrofe 
paid L. aciS 5, and Aberdeen L. 4735- The heavy duty im- 
pofed on Scotch coal, carried coaftwifeby fea, begins at the 
Red-head, between this and Arbroath. Montrofe is, of 
confequence, the firft town to the northward of the Frith 
of Forth, where it is paid. It is a duty undoubtedly impo- 
litic, partial and oppreffive. It is impolitic, as it difcou-

parts of Scotland pay no part of it, and the mofl remote 
and pooreft parts of the kingdom pay the whole. A grie- 
vance of this kind, merits the attention of Parliament, and 
ought to be redrefltd, by abolilhing the tax altogether, or 
fubllituting an equivalent in its ftead on fome other article, to 
be levied throughout all Scotland. Such a tax would be the 
meereft trifle to the kingdom at large, could be grudged by 
none, who had any regard to fubftantial juftice, and would 
deliver this part of the country from a grievous burden, 
without the removal of which, neither its commerce nor 
its agriculture can profper. 

Poor.— The number of paupers in this place is very 
great. This is owing in part to the many charitable infti- 
tutions in Montrofe ; — to the charafter its inhabitants have 
long maintained of kindnefs to llrangers, and liberality to 
the poor and partly, indeed, to the difFerent manufac- 
tures, to which men advanced in life, and reduced in circum- 
ftances, repair for bread to themfelves and numerous fa- 
milies, and who, within a few years, become a burden on 
the public. 

Of the funds allotted for the ufe of the poor, thofe be- 
longing to the church-feilions are the largeft, and managed, 
in general, with the greateft impartiality ; without any re- 
fped to perfons, ftation, employment, or principle, religi- 
ous or political. The monthly penfioners amount at prefent 
•Q about 1 68. Belides thefe, occafional fupplies are ordered 
for others at the monthly meetings. Such perfons as, in the 
interval, are reduced to temporary diltrefs, apply to the elder 
or church-warden, belonging to the divilion of the town 
or country parifh, where they refide, who recommends them 
[o the moderator of the fellion. Upon this, the moderator 
iflTues out an order to the treafurer, called a precept, to give

them a fupplj, feldom exceeding half a crown. The paiTm^ 
traveller, who is well recommended, as an objedl deferving 
the compaffion of the public, receives alfo occafional fupply, 
upon producing to the treafurer the moderator's precept. 
Thefe occafional fupplies, during the interval of the meet- 
ings of the feffion, amount to from L. 30 to L. 40 a-year. 

A tolerable idea of the nature and extent of thefe funds, 
now and formerly, may be deduced from a brief detail of 
the income and expenditure, towards the conclufion of the 
laft century, and at the prefent time.

The hofpital funds, which are under the diredlion of 
the town-council, have been fo much improved, that they 
amount, at prefent, to about L. 108 Sterling a-jear. They 
are reftri£led, entirely, to the relief of decayed burghers. 
Mortified money, to the amount of aboutL. 1600 Sterling, was 
left by John Milne, Efq; of Old Montrofe, Baillie Aughter- 
lonie, Mrs Grahame, Provofl Thomas Chriftie, &amp;c. under

icreft is diftributed, at particular feafons of the year, among 
the poor at large, belonging to this parifh. The family 
)f Hedderwick, mortified a fmall fum to the poor at large, 
both in the town and country parilh, and another to pur- 
chafe for the poor in the country parilh, Bibles and New 
Teftaments. 

The failor's box is not rich, as many of the mariners 
fcruple to pay the dues. It affords, however, to the widows, 
&amp;c. of fuch as are connefted with it, occafional fupplies to 
pay houfe rent, buy coals, &amp;c. Shipwrecked failors, tra- 
velling to their own homes, if their ftory is judged to be 
genuine, may alfo expe£t fome charity from this fund. 

The trades funds were formerly confiderable; but fome 
years ago, they were more than exhaufted by a ruinous 
law-fuit. By perfevering economy, and fome donations, 
they are at prefent emerging out of debt. 

As, notwithftanding all thefe funds, and the generofity of 
many individuals, there are fome poor perfons, belonging 
to Montrofe, who could not fubfift without applying to the 
public at large ; the magiftrates, and church-feffion, meet at 
a particular time of the year, and give out badges to fuch 
as they know to be under the neceffity of begging. Thefe 
licenfed beggars go through the town the firft day of every 
month, but are not allowed to beg at any other time, nor 
to go beyond the bounds of the parifli. They are fup- 
plied fo liberally, that they receive nothing from any of 
the public funds, except when lying on a fick-bed. Their 
number, at prefent, is about 40. 

At the fame time, as idlenefs is very pernicious to mo- 
rals, efpecially to the morals of the youth, the council and 
church-feffioa give a monthly penfion to fome orphans, and 
other poor children, to reftrain them from begging, to 
which they would otherwife be obliged to have recourfe. 

Convinced I 



46 Statijlical Account 



Convinced, alfo, of the importance of an early Chriftian 
education, the church-feflion fend a number of poor children 
to fchool, and pay for their education, till they are able, at 
leaft, to read the fcriptures. There are, at prefent, about 
50 fuch on the roll. They are at different fchools, which 
are vifited annually, that their progrefs in learning may be 
afcertained. 

Ecclejiajlical State. — There are few people in Montrofe, 
■who do not, occafionally, at leaft, attend fome place of pu- 
blic worfliip. The great body of the people are preibyte- 
rians. Hitherto, there has been only one church belonging 
to the eftablilhment •, but it is large, and much crowded. 
The charge is collegiate* The ftipend of the fenior clergy- 
man, is in money L.48 : 14 : 7|4- with 48 bolls 3':firlots 
a-^ pecks of bear, 55 bolls 2 firlots 2\ pecks meal, and 3 
bolls 2 firlots of wheat, but without a manfe or glebe. The 
ftipend of the fecond minifter arifes from an annuity, laid 
on houfes within the royalty, by a£l of Parliament, at the 
rate of 5 per cent, of yearly rent. It amounts, at prefent, 
to upwards of L. 100 ; and if levied with ftridlnefs, woujd 
confiderably exceed the ftipend of the firft charge. 

The following, is as accurate an account, of the numbers 
belonging to the religious fefts, in this place, as could well 
be obtained.

Though the religious fe£ls in Montrofe are thus nume- 
rous, and perfons belonging to three or four different kinds, 
are fometimes to be found in the fame family, they live, in 
general, in great harmony. About the beginning, and to- 
wards rhe middle of the prefent century, religious zeal, car- 
ried to an extreme, produced very bad effefts ; and, if the 
clergy were not difpofed, to go as great a length as their 
hearers, they were perfecuted much by anonymous letters, 
threatenings of profecution, and evil fpeaking ; but, in this 
refpea, the times are happily changed. Some bigots may 
be found every where, but here they are much reduced ia 
number, and are daily diminifhing. The clergy belonging 
to the different feds, are on a friendly footing ; the people, 
m general, attend public worlhip very regularly, and 
behave with becoming decency in the houfe of God. There 
are few places, where, upon the whole, the Sunday is better 
kept ; though it muft be confeiTed, there is, in this refped, 
a falling off here, as well as elfewhere. 

^mufements.—Th^ people in Montrofe have amufements 
of various kinds, both in fummer and winter. Social vifits 
take place at all feafons, and fuch recreations as commonly 

sLttend

attend them. The gentlemen hold a monthly club, which 
is well attended by perfons of diftinftion, both in the town 
and neighbourhood. During fummer, many go to the wells, 
or retire to the country to enjoy rural felicity. Such as re- 
main at home are frequently entertained with exhibitions 
calculated to gratify curiofity, or to increafe knowledge. Play- 
ing at the golf is a favourite and wholefome amufement. 
There is excellent ground for this purpofe, and alfo for walk- 
ing; as a large part of the links is level, and dry at all fea- 
fons. Playing at bowls and billiards is alfo frequently 
praftifed. Cards, fometimes, engrofstoo much time. In the 
proper feafon, fome retire to the hills for ftiooting, and their 
friends at home judge of their fuccefs, by the prefents they 
receive. During the winter feafon, there is an affembly eve- 
ry three weeks. It is conduced with the greateft decorum, 
and none but proper company are admitted. Aftors occa- 
lionally perform here, and undoubtedly meet with too much 
encouragement, though their mode of living is fuch, that 
they generally depart in poverty, and leave debts behind 
them. At Chriftmas, and the new year, the opulent 
burghers begin to feaft with their friends, and go a round of 
vifits, which takes up the fpace of many weeks. Upon fuch 
occafions, the gravell is expefted to be merry, and to join in 
a chearful fon?. Inftrumental mufic has been, for many 
years pa ft, much neglefted. Public or private concerts are • 
rare. This is the more to be regretted, as mufic is a very 
innocent, chearful, and rational amufement, and if more cul-' 
tivated, might divert the attention from other objefts^ 
which injure the health, or deftroy the morals of the people. 

Conclujion. — Montrofe is juftly accounted one of the firft 
provincial towns for its fize in Scotland, or perhaps m

cief.nly appearance, many encomiums from ftrangers. The 
honfes, if not elegant, are, on .the whole, well built and 
regular ; but, like thofe of Flanders, their gabel ends are 
often turned towards the ftreet. With one or two excep- 
tions, they are now all of ftone, and many of them covered 
with blue flates. In the principal part of the town, each 
family polTeffes a feparate houfe. But beyond .the port, 
and at the ftiore, the cafe is otherwife. Hence it is more 
populous, than a ftranger would be apt to imagine. As it 
is a town more diftinguifhed by the refidence of perfons of 
opulence and faftiion, than of commerce and induftry, and 
bften, but efpeciaUy in time of war, full of foldiers and 
failors, tb^ vices, which predominate in thefe diflipated 
times, are not uncommon. But, on the whole, the charac- 
ter of the people is refpedlable, polTeffing a degree of pu- 
blic fpirit, of hofpitality to ftrangers, and of charity to the 
poor, rarely to be equalled.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6918986">MOULIN</name> ., 

(county OE PERTH.) 
By the Rev. Mr Alexander Stewart.</head>  


<p>
Name, Situation, Extent and Surfa-ce. 

THE ancient and modern appellation of the parilhis Mou- 
lin; lb called from a fmall village, where the church 
ftands. That word is probably Celtic,. Jike all the other 
names of places in its neighbourhood, but the etymology is 
uncertain. A fmall lake once flood in the neighbourhood 
of the village, and has been converted, by means of drain- 
ing, into meadow ground. The word Moulin feems to have 
fome reference to this lake perhaps it may be rnaoth linne, 
a fmooth pool ; or magh lifme, Pool-field. This parifti is fitu- 
ated in the county of Perth, prefbytery of Dunkeld, and Sy- 
nod of Perth and Stirling, extending from N. E. to S. W. 
about thirteen miles in length. It may properly be divided 
into two diftri6b, the Atholl, and the Strathardle diftriftj 
the former lies on the banks of the rivers Tummel 
and Garry, which meet within the bounds of the parilh. 
— The latter includes Glenbriarachan and Glenfernat,. 
(which are watered refpeflively by the Briarachan and the- 
Arnot) and a part of Strathardle, fo called from the river 

Ardle, 



of Moulin. 



51 



ArdJe, formed by the junftion of the two laft mentioned 
'flreams. Thefe two divifions of the parifla, are feparated 
from each other, by a hill of inconfiderable height, and about 
■four miles over. They lie in a direftion nearly parallel to 
each other. The Strathardle divifion extends in length 
about 7 miles from N. W. to S. E. and in breadth 6\ miles- 
The length of the AthoU divifion, from N. W. to S. E. is 
7 miles, its breadth varies from 4 to 6 miles. 

Soil, Climate, and Difeafes.—ThQ greater part of the pa- 
rifh is mountainous, with feveral high and abrupt preci- 
pices, though there are no mountains of extraordinary 
height. The hills are almoft wholly covered v^^ith heath. 
Thofe of Glenbriarachan and Glenfernat, yield the moil 
grafs ; affording pafture for feveral flocks of flieep. The 
arable land is, in general, floping, but not very fleep.— In 
the Atholl diflria the foil is tolerably deep and fertile. 
The fields round the village of Moulin, a fpace of a mile 
and a half long, and half a mile broad, are among the mofl 
fertile in the Highlands of Perthfliire ; the foil in the 
Strathardle diflridl is flialiower, and yields lighter crops. 
The air is dry and extremely healthy. 

Chronical diilempers are very rare. Sudden cold or heat, 
or violent exercife, fometimes occafions fevers. The itch, 
which ufed to be very frequent, has, in a great meafure, dif- 
appeared, owing, chiefly, to cleanlinefs' of clothing. Def_ 
trudlive epidemical diflempers are alfo extremely rare. In- 
oculation for the fmall-pox, which is beginning to be pracli- 
fed among the lower clafTes, is almoft always fuccefsful, in 
rpreventing the fatal efFedls of that difeafe.

Rivers. — None of the rivers are large, nor is it polTible to 
render them navigable ; the channels are often rocky, an4 
very lineven ; in fome places deep, in others fhallow. Great 
quantities of fmall ftones, or of fand, are carried along by eve- 
ry flood, fo that the depth is perpetually varying ; and the 
rivers frequently fhift their beds. The flat meadows on the 
banks of the Briarachan are frequently overflowed, and, in 
winter, often covered with water. A fall on the river 
Tummel, called the Lin ofTummel, about 8 feet high, is 
remarkable only for the quantity of water, and the force 
with which it is thrown over the rock ; and for affording a 
convenient pool for catching fifh. The only lake is Loch 
Broom, fituated in a hill on the confines of Moulin and Lo- 
gierait pariUies. 

FiJJj. — The rivei-s contain trout, eel, par, minnow, but of 
no fuperior quality. Loch Broom has abundance of trout, 
fuperior in fize and flavour to the river trout. Thefe kinds 
of fifh are caught with the rod for fport, or for the ufe of pri- 
vate families, but never for fale. Salmon are found in the 
Tuuimel and Garry ; the flftiing continues from the begin- 
ning or middle of March, to the middle of Augufl. The nfli 
are almoft all bought up for the London market, at6i-. d. or 
7d. the lb. till the firft of May, then at 4d. or ^l^.. the lb. 
The fal mon are nioft in feafon in the middle of fpring, and 
degenerate through the fummer months. They are caught, 
for the moll part, with net and bait ; fometimes with a kind 
of fpear, armed with three or five prongs, barbed at the 
point, which is plunged into the fifh, while it lies motionlefg 
in flill water. Sometimes they are taken in a kind of large 
wicker bafket, placed fo as to intercept their progrefs up the 

river,

river. The rent of the fdmon fifliing on the Tummel and 
Garry, within the bounds of the parlfli, is L. 42. 

Minerals. — There is abundance of Hmeftone in the pariili, 
but very little is burnt into lime, on account of the dearnefs 
of fuel. There is a rock ou a liill, from which inill-flones 
have been fometimes hewn, and rolled down the hill on an 
axis ; the ftone is of that kind, called by the country peo- 
ple, crow's fpur. Several pieces of granite, of a beautiful 
kind, have been lately found. 

Animals. — The quadrupeds are horfes, cows, i}ieep,fvvine, 
dogs, cats, wild cats, pole-cats, weazels, martins, foxes, bad- 
gers, rabbits, roes, deer, hares in abundance, a fpecies of 
hare of a light blue colour in fummer, and perfectly white 
in winter. The fowls are common hens, geefe, ducks, pigeons, 
wood pigeons, jays, woodcocks, magpies, rails, plovers, he- 
rons, ovv^ls, partridges, muirfowls, black cocks, crows, hawks, 
ravens, kites, eagles, and all the kinds of linging birds common 
in the Highlands of Scotland. A kind of brown hawk, which 
neftles in a rock, half a mile from the village of Moulin, is 
much efteemed by falconers, who come from different parts 
of Scotland, and even of England, to carry away the young 
anes. The cuckow appears in the woods about the end of 
April, or beginning of May, and difappears about the begin- 
ning of July j fwallows appear, and breed in May and June, 
md difappear the middle of September. The woodcock 
:omes about the middle, of September, and goes away the 
niddle of March. 

Pqpulatio?i.~Ey an exaft enumeration made in September 
179^? the number of perfons in the parifh was found to be

The annual average of births for the laft 7 years, as 
taken from the parifli regifter, is 46. The average num- 
ber of children, produced by each marriage, may be about 
6. The return made, . from hence, to Dr Webfter about 
1755, was 2109 fouls, and the average of births from 
1 75 1 to 1757, inclufive, was 64; fo that, the population, it i 
would appear, has confiderably declined within the laft 40 ^ 
years. The chief reafon, feems to be, that many corn ; 
farms, (particularly one whole glen, Glenfernat, which 
contained upwards of 20 families), have been denuded ■ 
of their inhabitants, and converted into ftieep-walks and , 
grazings. Probably the prefent high rate of wages may i 
have had fome eifeft, in decreafmg the population, by ob- 
liging the tenants to keep fewer fervants than formerly. J 
To this it may be added, that numbers of young men and : 
women, from 11 years of age to 28 or 30, leave the parilli i 
yearly, to go to fervice, or to learn trades in the low 
countries •, fome of whom, however, occafionally return tp \^ 
fettle in their native place. , \ 

Number of Heritors, Farmers, i^c— The number of j 
heritors is 14, of whom 7 refide conftantly in the parifli, | 
and other 3 occafionally. The number of farmers, afcer- \ 
tained by furvey, is 194 ; of thefe 89 poffefs a plough-gang, ;

10 ; half a plough-gang ; the families of the former gene- 
rall/ confift of the tenant, his wife, 4 children, and a fer- 
vant, in all 623 perfons ; and the families of the latter, 
may be reckoned to confift of man, wife, and 4 children, 
or 630 individuals. There are in the parifti 28 weavers, 
13 tailors, 8 carpenters, 7 flioemakers, 6 iliop-keepers: 
5 blackfmiths, 5 mafons, 4 flaxdreffers, 4 coopers, 3 
iievemakers, i dyer, in all 81. Of labouring fervants, 
there are 17 males, and 18 females, in gentlemen's families 
the number of both fexes, among the tenants, may be 
eftimated at 89, as tenants who, hold a plough-gang, gene- 
rally keep one fervant, who is of the female fex, if any 
of the fons are able to aflift their father in managing the 
farm ; but if otherwife, the tenant is obliged to keep a 
male fervant, and, in that cafe, can fcarcely afford to keep 
a female fervant alfo. There are in the parifh, i clergy- 
man of the eftablillied church, I ftudent of divinity, and 5 
gentlemen's families, containing 46 perfons, including fer- 
fants. AU the inhabitants are of the Eftablifhed Church. 

Houfes, &amp;c. — The number of inhabited houfes is 440, 
confequently the number of perfons in each houfe is, about 
4, at an average ; but, it is to be obferved, that many are 
pofleffed by widows and widowers, who have no family, 
and by unmarried tradefmen. There are 110 houfes unin- 
labited, nor any farms unoccupied. New houfes are 
irequently a-building, efpecially near the liighways, and in 
he villages •, and fmall farms are often broken down into 
ingle acres, to accommodate tradefmen or fli op-keepers 
with ground for gardens and fown grafs. There are two 
(tillages in the parilh ; one called Pitlochry, fituated on the 
military road, containing' about 30 families; the other 

Moulin J

Moulin, three quarters of a mile from Pitlochry, contaiHing 
.37 families. •} 

Natural ProduHwns.— There are fome confiderable oak 
and birch woods on the lower grounds, along the fides of 
the rivers. Some oak bark, for tanning leather, is yearly 
fold, and, next to linen yarn, is the principal commodity 
which the parilli exports. The foil is, in general, favour- 
able to the growth of foreft and fruit trees. Some planta- 
tions of larch and Scotch firs have been made, on the hills 
and moorifii grounds, and are ftill going on, particularly 
on one eftate, where there are 400 acres planted. The other 
plantations, may be about 300 acres. Oak woods, withia 
the parilh, are worth, at a cutting, L. 4500. Birch, a- 
bout L. 500. 

The ordinary crops raifed by the farmers are, oats, bear^ 
flax, and potatoes. Turnips, and clover, with rye-grafs, are 
cultivated by a few gentlemen. Small quantities of rye and 
peafe are alfo raifed ; but no wheat nor beans. Efculent plants , 
of all kinds are cultivated with fuccefs. Along the banks of: 
the Tummel, where there is good flicker from the north; 
the climate is favourable, and vegetation ufually very for.| 
ward. In the Strathardle divifion, where there is lefs fliel-| 
ter, the feafon is more backward. Inclofures are few, h\iti 
they are multiplying yef..rly. j 

Crops.— The number of plough-gangs, in the hands of te-,. 
nants, is about I4ii, and in thofe of gentlemen, Sf; reck-i- 
oning 13 acres of arable land to each plough-gang, the^f 
whole number of acres in cultivation, will be about 1950.' 
Oats are fown in April : then lintfeed and potatoes •, bear is ; 
fown between the middle, and the end of May. The time of ,"

/eft is extremely variable, beginning fometimes the end 
of Auguft.and fometimes not till the icith of Oaober. The 
parilh fupplics itfelf with provifions, except an inconfider- 
able quantity of oat-meal imported from the low country, 
but, which is not equal to the tenth part, of what ufed to be 
imported 20 or 25 years ago, before potatoes were fb ge- 
nerally cultivated. The quantity of bear, fold in the pa- 
riOi to whiiky diftillers, is probably greater than the quan- 
tity of meal imported ; fo that the quantity of graia, raifed 
in the parilh, is greater than the quantity of meal confumed 
in it. No articles of provifion are exported, except mut- 
ton and beef; and oat-meal and cheefe are the only articles 
of that kind imported. Confiderable quantities of marl 
have been found in|different parts of the parifti, which have 
been ufed in farming by fome gentlemen, but rarely by 
the tenants. 

Implements of HuJhandry.—ThQ humbcir of ploughs in 
the parifh is 141, belonging to tenants, and 5 belonging to 
gentlemen. The ploughs are rather fmall and clumfy, 
drawn by four hotfes yoked a-breaft, and driven by a man, 
who holds the horfes by the halters^ and walks backwards. 
The gentlemen, and two or three tenants, make ufe of 
two-horfe ploughs, driven by the man who holds the 
plough. No waggons. A farmer, of the fuperior order, 
has ufually two pair of pretty good cartwheels, 40 or '42 
inches in diameter, and two bodies of carts fit for any ordi- 
nary kind of load ; alfo two pairs of {lighter wheels, em- 
ployed only in carrying fuel, or dung to the field. He has 
four cart bodies, made of clofc boards, for carrying dung ; 
and as many for carrying peat, made with a light open 
frame interwoven with twigs. The whole number of cart-

wheels may be eftlmated at 581 pairs. There is one four- 
wheeled chaife in the parifli. 

Re?it of Laml.~The valued rent of the parifli is 
L. 4026 : 3 : 10 : Scotch ; the real rent has been eflimated at 
mne times that fum, or fomewhat more than L.3000 Ster- 
ling. Single acres of good arable land, in the neighbourhood 
of the villages of Moulin and Pitlochry, pay from 30s. to 
34 s. of yearly rent. A field of good arable land may pay 
a rent of 12 s. the acre. Ordinary land is let at the rate 
of 17 s. the acre. The rent of infield pafture ground is the 
fame with that of arable. A horfe's grazing on hill ground, 
IS valued at 5 s. a month ; a cow's at 2s. 6d. A plough- 
gang confifting, at an average, of 13 acres arable land, 
and hill ground fufficient for pafturing 4 horfes and 10 cows, 
pays L. 17 of yearly rent. — A third part of the landed pro- 
perty has been fold within the laft thirty years, but it is not 
often changing. The average price of thofe lands may 
have been about 30 years purchafe ; but they now yield 
111 genera!, a rent equal to 5 or 6 ^er cent on the purchafe- 
raoney. 

Prices of ProDifions, Fuel, l^c. — Beef is 3 d. the lb. but very

Prices of Labour. — A day-labourer's wages at ordinary 
work are 6 d.; at hard labour 8 d.; a taylorgets 6 d. acarpenter 
IS. or I s. 2d. ; a mafon i s. 2 d. Thefe wages are given be- 
fides vidbials. If visuals are not given, an addition of 4d. or 
4^ d. is made to the wages. A mill-wright has 2 s. the day 
without vi£luals. The wages of a fervant man, employed in 
hulbandry, are, from L. 6, 15 s. to L. 7. the year ; of a woman 
employed in hufbandry, or as a domeftic fervant, from L. 2, 
15 s . to L. 3. A man engaged during the harveft fea^bn,from 
the time the corn begins to be cut down, till it is Hacked and

Although there thus appears to be a deficiency of earn- 
ings, after the charges have been eftimated in the nioft fru- 
gal, and even fcanty manner, and no allowance made for 
cafual expences; yet it is certain, that, in this country, 
people, who feem to have no livelihood but the fruits of 
their daily labour, do, by fome means or other, bring up 
families, and even give their children fuch education as 
the neareft fchool affords. 

ManufciElures. — The people are in general induftrious. 
The principal branch of manufafture, carried on in the 
parifli, is the fpinning of linen yarn, the ftaple commodity 
of the country. In winter, it is the only employment of 
the women. A woman fpins, at an average, 16 cuts the 

day, 

* A woman, who is a good fpinner, and employed in nothing elfe 
may earn 3s. the week; but is. is a high enough eftiir.ate of the' 
earnings of a woman, who has a family of 2 or 3 young children to take care 
pf.

day, the fize of the yam being ordinarily a fpindle or 48 
cuts from a pound of lint. The price of a ftone of lint 
from the mill, is, at an average, 13 s. 4d. ; and this, when 
dreffed or heckled, yields about 1 1 pounds of lint ; the rc- 
fufe, confifling of tow, backings, &amp;:c. being equal in value 
to the price of dreffing. From thefe 11 pounds of lint, n 
fpindles of yarn are fpun, which are fold at the average 
price of 2s. 4d. the fpindle, or L. x : 5 : 8 ; the profit on the 
whole is, therefore, 12 s. 4d. or is. i-^-d. the fpindle, which 
generally takes three days to fpin ; therefore, the daily 
earning of a fpinner is 4^d. In fummer the women fpin 
woollen yarn. Woollen cloths, for common wear, fuch as' 
hooding for mens coats and walftcoats, tartan for hofe, 
breeches, kilts and plaids, camelot for women's gowns, 
plaiding for under petticoats and women's hofe, are entirely 
manufadured in the country. The art of fpinning with 
both hands has of late been introduced, and is coming 
fall into praftice. 

A fair, held at Moulin the end of February, has always 
been the principal market for the fale of linen yarn. 
Hither the weavers and yarn -dealers from different parts 
of Scotland ufed to refort, and buy up, for ready money, the' 
yarn which had been fpun in the preceding 4 months. But: 
for fome years paft, the yarn has been bought up, in the 
courfe of the winter, by fliopkeepers and yarn-dealers iij! 
the country, who fend it off to their employers in manu- 
fafturlng towns, fo that the quantity fold at the fair is no " 
inconfiderable. The yarn has fold this winter and fprin 
1 791 at 2 s. 6 d. and 2 s. 7 d. the fpindle, which is reckone 
a good price *. The confequcnce of yarn felling high is an

immediate rife in the wages of women fervanta Should 
the machines for fpinning linen jarn come to be much 
and fuccefsfully ufed, fo as to reduce the price of fpinning 
that efFe£l will be feverely felt in this country. Single 
women may, perhaps, find employment in fome other 
branches of manufadhire ; but it does not appear in what 
other way married women, who muft fit always at home 
with their children, can contribute any thing to the fup- 
port of their families. 

Exports — The principal export is linen yarn, which 
may be eftimated thus:- The women, from lo years old 
and upwards, employ themfelves in fpinning linen yarn, 
almoft wholly for fale, from the beginning or middle of 
November, till about the end of March, a period of 21 
weeks. Of the 789 females above 8 years of age, 272, 
who are married, may be fuppofed to fpin at the rate of 
one fpindle the week. From the remainder, 517, one 
fifth part, 103, may be deduded, confifting of girls, old 
women, &amp;c. whofe work cannot be reckoned of any ac- 
count. The reft, 414, may be fuppofed to fpin at the 
rate of two fpindles. Hence the quantity fpun in the a- 
bove period of 21 weeks, will be : 

Spindles.

Thus it may be reckoned, that 23,000 fpindles, fpun 
for fale, during the fpinning feafon, and fold out of the 
parilh at 2s. 4d. the fpindle, bring a return in calh, of 
L. 2683 : 6 : 8. This quantity of yarn exhaufts about 
l2'2co ftones of lint, in the ftate it comes from the mill.

The remainder of the produce is either fpun in fummer, for 
home wear, in the intervals of other labour, or fold to 
neighbouring diftiias, lefs fertile in producing flax. 

The oak woods are valued at L. 4500 kt a cutting. Be- 
ing cut once in 20 years, they are worth at the rate of 
L. 225 a-year. The oak bark, by itfelf, is eftimated at 
the fame price, as the wood is allowed to the merchant 
to defray the expence of cutting, peeling and carriage 
Sheep, fold yearly, may be worth L. 900. Black cattle, 
L,300. Wool, 9000 fleeces, at 8d. worth L.300. One 
half of the wool is manufaaured in the parifti,"and the 
other half exported. 

Mills.— Th&amp; number of mills in the parifli is 10 meal-- 
mills, 3 fulling mills, and 7 lint-mills. The number of the 
latter is much more than fufiicient for the quantity of flax 
raifed; this is, however, a conveniency to the people, as they \ 
get their flax all dreffed at the proper time for fpinning it. | 
The rate of multure paid at the meal-mills is, in general, one 
eleventh part of the viftual that is ground. j 

Language.— T\iz language principally fpoken is the Gae^j 
lie. Mofl: of the people, however, underftand fo much of 
Englifh, as to be able to tranfaft ordinary bufinefs with their 
neighbours of the low country. The reading of Gaelic has. 
come to be much more taught and ftudied in this part of the 
country than formerly, Cnce the publication of the late Gae- 
lie verfion of the fcriptures. There can be no doubt, that this I 
publicatiqu will have a powerful efFeft, in arrefting and pre- - 
. ferving pure the Gaelic language, which has been for marty r 
ages yielding gradually, to the encroachments of the Eng- • 
lifli. It was once thought an objeft worthy of political at- -

tention to ufe means for eradicating this language from the 
Highlands of Scotland . It is to be prefumed, that the legif- 
lature now entertains different views ; for experience has by 
this time iufficiently evinced, that induftry and good order 
arc not incompatible with the ufe of the Gaelic, and of 

tartan philabegs. 

All names of places in the parifli, whofe etymology 
can be traced with certainty, are Gaelic.

It is uncertain when the church was built \ a ftone, which

The front wall was taken down, and the church widened, 
in 1704; the infide repaired, and new-feated, the windows 
enlarged, the walls plaftered and the roof cieled, in 1787. 
The manfe was built in 1758. 

Schools. — In the parochial fchool there are about 50 
fcholars, of whom 7 are taught Latin. The reft learn 
reading, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, and fome 
branches of mathematics. The falary is 300 merks Scotch, 
(L. 16 : 13 : 4 Sterling), of which 200 are paid by the

heritors, and loo given out of the confifcated bifliops 
lands. The fchool fees are, each quarter, i s. 3 d. for reading, 
IS. 6d. for Writing and arithmetic, 2 s. or as. 6 d. for 
Latin, and 3 s. for Greek. Belides the flated fees, the 
mafter receives fome fmall gratuity, generally 2 d. or 3 d. 
from each fcholar on handfel Monday, or Throve Tuefday. 
As feflion-clerk, he has L. i, i s. of falary, 2 s. for regifler- 
ing eyery marriage, and 3 d. for each baptifm. There are 
5 other fchools in different parts of the parifh, taught by 
perfons who have undertaken that employment of their 
own accord, where children learn to read Englifti and 
Gaelic. The number of fcholars in thefe laft mentioned 
fchools, from the beginning of November to the end of 
March, is about 180. The parochial fchool is the only 
one kept up in fummer, but the number of fcholars is then 
inconfidei-able, becaufe- almoft all the children of both fexes 
are then at fervice ; very few remaining in the neighbour- 
hood, the greater part going, at that feafon, to the low coun. 
try, where they are employed in herding, or tending cattle- 

Poor. — The number of the poor, who receive regular 
fupplies, is about 16, and thofe who receive occafional aflift- 
ance are about 16 more. The capital of the poors fund 
is L. 234, made up from legacies, donations, and favings, 
under the management of economical truftees, yielding an 
annual income of L.8, 14s. The annual amount of colledlions, 
fines, &amp;c. is, at an average, about L. 18, 10 s. fo that the whole 
produce of the funds comes to L. 27, 4 s. Out of this is to 
be dedufted the fees of Synod, prefbytery, and feflion-clerks, 
officers, ^c. equal to L. 2 : 3 : 6 ; which leaves the revenue 
of the poor about L. 25 : 0 : 6. A confiderable rife in 
the coUeftions at church, took place in 1788, when the 
church was newly repaired and feated. The heritors, ob,

ferving that the weekly colle£tions had long been very 
Iraall, intimated to their refpedive tenants, that if they 
would make a decent contribution for the poor, they would 
have their feats in the church free ; that, otherwife, every 
tenant would be charged with a fmall yearly feat rent, to be 
applied to the ufe of the poor. This intimation, accompanied 
with fome exhortations to charity, by the minifter, which, for 
the credit of his people, he is willing to fuppofe, had fome 
influence, increafed the yearly colle£tion from an average 
of L.6, 6s. to L. 15, 12 s. in 1788, and L. 15, 2 s. in 1789. 
From 1775 to 1784 inclufive, the heritors affeffed them- 
felves in 20 bolls of oat-meal annually, for the fupport of 
the poor; but fince the year 1784, this contribution has 
been difcontinued as unneceffary. In 1782 and 17S3, the 
people were much diftrefled from the fcarcity of ptovifions, 
particularly oat-meal, the price, of which rofe to i s. 3 d. 
and IS. 4d. the peck. In 1783, the kirk-feflion aiid heri- 
tors diftributed 40 bolls of meal among the poor of the 
parifli. 

Mifcellaneous Ohfernations. — The general fize of the men 
is 5 feet 5 or 6 inches ; of the women 5 feet. The talleft 
man now living in the parifh is 6 feet 4 inches ; and the 
oldeft man now alive is about 95 years of age. The people 
have no idea of a feafaring life, and are very averfe to 
a military one. They are humane, very obliging, well 
enough contented ; enjoy the necefTaries of life in a toler- 
able degree, and the comforts of fociety in abundance ; are 
frugal in their diet, but ftudy a neat and £howy appearance 
in their drefs and furniture. None are known to have 
emigrated beyond fea from the parifti ; there are no in- 
ftances, for many years paft, of any perfon dying for 
want ; and but one has laeen baniflied. 

Advantage s, 



68 



Statiftical Account 



Aihantages and Lifadvantagcs. — The parifli is totally 
free from the baneful confequences of religious controverfy. 
Some jears ago there were a few Epifcopalians ; but thefe 
now join in communion with thofe of the Eftablilbed 
Church. The name of Seceder is unknown. The 
juftices of peace, in the diftrift, hold regular quarterly 
meetings, for the purpofe of deciding diflerences among 
their tenants. One obvious good effedl of this meafure is, 
to put a fpeedy end to their difputes, and to fave them the 
heavy expence of attending the tedious proceedings of a 
fherifF-court, at the diftance of 30 miles. The parifh en- 
joys the benefit of good roads, and an eafy accefs to the 
low country, and to the neareft market towns, Dunkeld 
and Perth. A few farms are ftill intermixed together, in 
the way called run-ridge ; that is, the ridges of arable land 
belong alternately to different tenants, a moft incommo- 
dious and abfurd arrangement. Much time and labour is I 
fpent in procuring fuel, and loft to agriculture. This dif- 
advantage is yearly increafing, becaufe the moffes which 
ufed to fupply the people with peat, are in fome parts j 
exhaufted, and thofe which remain, either lie at a greater I 
diftance, or are of more difficult accefs. Some parts of the | 
parifti muft foon labour under a fearcity of fuel, an incon- j 
venience which will not eafily be remedied ; for coal is at | 
a great diftance, there is no water carnage, wood is dear, j 
and wood plantations neither extenfive nor much advanced  
ingrowth. One caufe which accelerates a fearcity of fuel, 
is the diftilling of whiflcy ; for one ftill confumes as much 
peat as would ferve five families. j 

J 

Bijlilleries, Alehoufes, ISc, — There are 2 licenfed ftills of ' 
30 gallons each in the parifli, and 24 licenfed retailers of ale, j 
beer, and other excifeable liquors. The number of diftillers 

and : 



of Moulin. 

and retailers may be confidered as a circumftance unfavour- 
able to the health, and the morals of the people. How- 
ever, it cannot be faid, that the people are addided to 
drinking. Even at weddings, and on holidays, inflances 
of perfons drinking to excefs are few, and a drunken fquab- 
ble is extremely rare. It is fomewhat remarkable, that 
among people who hardly know how to make a bargain, 
or pay a debt, except over a dram of whilky, moderation 
fliould be fo generally obferve^ ; particularly when it is 
confidered, that at the fairs, every houfe, hut, and flied in 
the refpedive villages, is converted into a dram-ftiop. 

Antiquities. — An old ruin ftands'in the neighbourhood of 
the village of Moulin. It appears to have been nearly a fquare, 
meafuring 76 feet by 80, and had a round turret at each of 
the four corners. It flood within a fmall lake, which has 
been drained : The veftiges of a caufeway, leading from 
the building to the neareft riling ground, a diflance of ijo 
yards, are quite diftinct. A part of the fouth wall, 50 feet 
in length, 25 in height, and 5 in thicknefs, are ftill ftanding ; 
alfo fome fragments of the north and weft walls, and moft 
of the north-weft turret. The ftones of the wall are placed 
in regular horizontal rows, but not hewn, pinned with 
fmall flat ftones, and cemented with lime and fand, which, 
mafons fay, muft have been mixed with water to a thin 
conliftence, and then poured in among the ftones, as each 
row was laid. One fide of a window, or fome fuch open- 
ing, is to be feen in a part of the turret which remains j 
there is no appearance of an aperture of any kind in all the 
reft of the wall. No authentic accounts whatever, refped- 
ing this building have ever been found. Some fuppofe it 
to have been a religious "houfe, as the lands about it are 
known to have been church lands. It is faid to have be- 
longed

longed fome time to the Cummins, who were earls of 
AthoU and Badenoch in the 14th century. A tradition 
prevails, that a number of perfons, infefted with the 
plague, were fliut up, and afterwards buried in it. 
Hence it is thought unfafe, by the country people, to re- 
move any of the ftones, left the infedlion break forth. It 
has been known, for many years back, by the name of 
the Old Caftle of Moulin. The veftiges of fmall circular 
buildings fuppofed to have been Pidlilh forts, are to be 
feen in diiferent parts of the parifli. Two or three 
Druldical places of worfhip are difcernible, each having the 
veftiges of a circular, or an elliptical ftone fence, and a 
fingle tall ftone in the centre, or the focus.^ 

Fojpls. — The fcull of a large horned animal was found, 
fome years ago in a marl pit, half a mile from Mouhn, and 
is preferved at Atholl Houfe. The head is ftiaped like that 
of an ox ; the horns are loft, but the pith is entire ; the 
length of the fcull, from the edge of the bone between the 
horns, to the extremity "of the upper jaw, is 26^ inches ; 
the greateft circumference of the pith, 13 inches; the dia- 
meter of the eye focket, 3 f inches ; and the diftance be- 
tween the eyes, 10 f inches. It is fuppofed to have be- 
' longed to one of thofe animals which Csefar calls Uri, and 
which were found in the Hercynian foreft in Germany*. 

Battle. — There was a battle fought in this parifti, on the 
17th July 1689, between King William's troops, com- 
manded by General Mackay, and a body of Highlan- 
ders, headed by Graham, Vifcount Dundee, which is 
known by the name of the battle of Killicrankie. A 
fmall mount, on the ground where the battle began, is call- 
ed 

* Bell, Gall. lib. 6. cap.

ed in Gaelic Tlomh Clavsrs, that is, Mount Clavers ; a num- 
ber of human bones were found in it, in digging for gravel. 
At this fpot, it is faid, Lord Dundee fell ; but it is believed 
that he was afterwards carried to Blair, where he died of his 
wounds. The fkeleton of a man was found in the garret 
of Mr Stewart of Urrard's houfe, which ftands near the 
place where the battle was fought, fome years afterwards, 
fuppofed to have been the bones of a foldier, who had ta- 
ken refuge in the houfe. 

Eminent Men. — Captain Campbell of Finnab was born 
here. This gentleman is renowned for the gallant defence 
he made of the Scotch colony at Darien, and the honour- 
able terms of capitulation he procured for the garrifon, 
when that fettlemenc was evacuated. 

Roads. — The great road from Perth to Invernefs pafles 
through the parifh, and is always kept in good repair, by 
the ftatute-work of the country, together with the occa- 
fional affillance of military parties. The crofs roads are 
few, and are kept in pretty good repair, by the attention of 
the country gentlemen, in applying the ftatute-work where 
it is moil needed. The ftatute-labour is generally exaded in 
kind, though fometimes a commutation is allowed at the 
rate of lixpence for a day's labour. There are no turnpikes, 
nor does there feem to be any occafion for them. The on- 
ly bridge of note is that over the Garry, at the fouth end 
of the pafs of Killicrankie, built by fubfcription, and finifh- 
ed in 1770. There was formerly a ferry on the fame ri- 
ver, near the place where the bridge was built, after the 
ferry-boat was loft, on the evening of a Fair day, in Fe- 
bruary 1767, and eighteen perfons drowned, among whom 
were four men with their wives. Soon afterwards a fub- 
fcription 



^2 Stattjlical Account, &amp;c. 

fcription was opened for building a bridge, and the contri- 
butions were liberal. 

Reniarkahle Ciifloms, &amp;c.— A number of trifling ceremo-. 
nies, which had their origin in fuperftition, are Itill conti- 
nued at chriftenings, burials, and other folemn or feftive occa- 
fions ; but they feem to be retained rather from an attach- 
ment to old ufages, than from the beUef, that the obfer- 
vance or omiffion of them is attended with any important^ 
efFea. It is obfervable that thofe gymnaftic exercifes, 
which conftitutedthe chief paftime of the Highlanders 40 or 
50 years ago, have almoft totally difappeared. At every 
fair or meeting of the country people, there were contefts 
at racing, wreftling, putting the Hone, &amp;c. and on holidays, 
all the males of a diftrift, young and old, met to play at 
footbaU, but oftener ^tJJnnty*. Thefe games are now prac- 
tifed only by fchool-boys, having given place to the more ele- 
gant, though lefs manly, amufement of dancing, which is 
become very common, efpecially on holidays. A footing 
match, for fome fmall prize, occupies part of the day ; and 
in the evening, they repair to a ball, in a barn or tap-room, 
where they enjoy all the pleafures of rural feftivity. 

* Shinty is a game played with flicks, crooked at the end, and balls of 
wood.

Situation, i^c. 

THIS parifh is fituated in the fliire of Perth, in the 
prefbytery of Dnnkeld, and in the Synod of Perth 
and Stirling. Its eaftern extremity is about half a mile 
below the jirnftion of the rivers Tummel and Tay. The 
principal part of the parifh is of an irregular triangular 
ftiape, lying either between thefe two rivers, or on the 
north fide of the Tummel. The traft extending along the 
Tay, is denominated Strath-Tay. South of Tummel, is 
Slcfoeg, or the 7iarrow country. Thefe two diftri61s are 
feparated by a ridge, which is terminated on the eaft end 
by precipitous rocks, and is interfered at five or fix miles 
diftance from thefe rocks, by another chain crofl!ing it ob- 
liquely, from fouth-weft to north-eafi. The diftance be- 
tween Tay and Tummel, may be about feven miles. One 
detached part of this parifli ftretches about a mile fouth of 
Tay, upon the road to Tay mouth. Another divifion of it is 
fituated in Rannoeh, at thirty miles diftance. 



Scenery 



76 



Statijlical Account 



Scenery^ Hills, Lakes, Rivers, i^c. — A rock, not abo^'s 
a mile from the church, commands a profpeft of a great 
part of the parifh. The windings of the rivers, the i ich 
vales, the doping corn fields and paftures, the hanging 
woodlands, and the awful mountains which rife at a dif- 
tance to confine the view, form, all together, one of the 
nobleft landfcapes, for extent, variety, beauty and gran- 
deur, that the eye can behold. The land upon the banks 
of the rivers is chiefly arable ; much of the rifing ground, 
too, which confines the vales, is alfo cultivated, where the 
declivities are not too fteep for the courfe of the plough. 
About the middle of Strath-Tay, and in feveral places on 
. both fides of ':he Tummel, the woodlands extend to the 
very brink of the river. The hills are partly covered with 
heath ; but in fome parts exhibit nothing but bare rocks. 
The lands, wherever arable, are moderately fertile. The 
air is dry, and not unhealthy. The water through the 
parifli is abundantly pure and wholefome. Befides the ri- 
vers Tay and Tummel, there are feveral fmall lakes ; and 
fome farms belonging to Logierait, border upon Loch Ran- 
noch, a body of water ten miles in length, and, from a mile, 
to a mile and a half broad. The rivers frequently over- 
flow their banks and on fuch occafions never fail to en- 
large their channels, by breaking down fome part of their 
banks, in one part or another. The greateft floods that 
have been known here, within the prefent century, hap- 
pened in the year 1761. 

Minerals, Vegetahles, and Animals, — Our rocks have no- 
thing fingular in their compofition or afpeft. They afford 
indeed a variety of talc ; which is found in many other places 
through the north of Scotland. On one fide of Strath-Tay, 
too, are feveral ftrata of lime-ftone. Foflfil wood is occa-

fionaJly dug up il^ our moffes. The woods growing througli 
this parifli, occupy about 800 acres of ground. The treea 
are oaks, afties, elms, beeches, planes, poplars, birches,, 
krches, allers, willows, the Scotch and the fpruce fir, the 
liburnum, and the walnut-tree. The foil and fituation are. 
friendly to fruit trees, and equally fo to the currant and the 
gooleberry bufh, and to other flirubs of a fimilar charafter. 
The vegetables cultivated here, as articles of crop, are bar- 
ley, oats, rye, peafe, potatoes,, and in our gardens, the com- 
mon pot herbs^ 

Jgricultzire. — Of the lands in this parifh, between 2500 
and 3000 acres may be arable. Several thoufands of acres 
are wafte, and in common •, 200 acres are annually planted 
with potatoes •, 50 may be covered with rye and peafe ; 
200 are kept for pafture in gentlemen's inclofures ; about 
1200 are fown with oats; 100 acres "have been fown with 
artificial grafs feeds, of which the farmers made the firft 
trial in 1790 ; 200 are fown with flax ; and the refb of the 
ground which is annually plowed, is fown with barley. 
The fields, whether in crop or in pafture, are in genera}- 
open j but of the advantages of inclofures, we are all fully 
fenfible. About 200 ploughs are employed in the cultiva. 
tion of our lands \ on the uplands, the plough is drawn by 
4 horfes yoked a-breaft, and the driver walks backwards. 
On the plains, when 4 horfes are employed, they are yoked 
two and two ; and in fome inftances, a horfes draw the 
plough, without a driver -, 400 carts are ufed in the parifti, 
alth9ugh 30 years fince, we had not 50 among us. 

Exports and Imports, — An hundred ftone weight of but- 
ter, 200 ftone weight of Scotch, and from 3 to 4000 lbs 
«f Suffolk cheefe, are annually eonfumed in this parifli, in 

addition

addition to fuch quantities of thefe articles as are produced 
in it. We need an yearly fupply of about 300 bolls of 
oat-meal. Formerly, we required at leaft four times as 
much. But lince potatoes have been introduced among us, 
and have come to be generally ufed as an ordinary article 
of food, we ufe much lefs meal than before. In the 
diftillation of whilky, we ufe icoo bolls of barley, above 
what is produced in the parifli. But in return, we annual- 
ly fell olF, for the confumption of other parts, 400 wedders, 
20Q hogs, about 100 lean cows to the fouth country gra- 
ziers in fpring, and a great quantity of poultry. We ma- 
nufadure alfo a confiderable quantity of whifky, for the 
ufe of the low country. But our ftaple article of manu- 
fafture and export, is linen yarn. 

Population. — The population of the parifh of Logierait, 
bears no unequal proportion to the quantity of its lands 
which is cukivated. It has continued nearly the fame, for 
thefe many years, though, on the whole, there has been a 
decreafe fince 1755, when the return to Dr Webfter was 
2487 fouls, whereas, at prefent, they do not exceed 2200.

Did not numbers emigrate, every year, to the lowlands, 
our population would rapidly increafe. The annual births 
are, to the whole population, nearly in the proportion of % 
to 29. The proportion of the annual marriages to the 
whole population, is that of i to no. The deaths arc 
not regiftered. Not the 20th man, in the parifli, remains 
unmarried at the age of 35.— As many men, but few fe- 
males, leave the country for life, the old maids are more 
numerous than the bachelors. Twice or thrice, within 
thefe 30 years, numbers have been fwept away by a putrid 
fever. A fever, accompanied with a fore-throat, has, at 
times, been very mortal. The common epidemical difeafes 
prove occafionally fatal among the children. But, fmce the 
praaice of inoculation has been introduced among us, we 
fuffer much lefe than formerly from the fmall-pox. 

State of Property. -T\,^ proprietors of this parifli, of 
whom the Duke of Athol is the principal, are 17. There 
are alfo 5 fmall feuars. Five of the great heritors, and 6 of 

• the 



Statijlical Account 



the feuars refide conftantly in the parifh. The whole rents 
of the lands and mills, in the pariHi, may amount to about 
L. 3000. The rents of the ferries, filhings, and houfes, that 
are fet feparate from the lands, do not exceed, altogether, 
L. 100. 

The bell inclofed ground is let for L. i, 10 s. an acre ; 
but a few acres bring even L. 2. Land of an inferior qua- 
lity is rented at from 15 s. to L. i an acre. A farm confifting 
of as much arable ground as can be cultivated with one 
■plough, affords, upon an average, through this parifli, L. 18 
of yearly rent. 

Churclj and Poor.— The value of the living, with the 
glehe, may be about L. 90 a-year. The Duke of Athol is 
patron. A broken crofs upon the church, indicates it to 
liave been built in the times when Popery was the efta- 
bhlhed religion of the kingdom. The manfe was built in 
1 7 56. Forty poor perfons receive the alms diftributed by 
tlie feffion •, and a few more beg. The weekly colleftions, 
made at the church, produce about L. 14 a-year ; the other 
funds afford L. 6 more ; and this is all the feffion have te 
diflribute. 

School— Thtxt is a parochial fchool, with a yearly falary 
from the pariib, to which there is added igo merks/er an- 
num, given by the truftees for managing the rents of the 
biihoprick of Dunkeld. The church dues may be about 
L. 5 Sterling. The fcholars paj from is. to 1 s. 6 d. a 
quarter. 

There is i charity fchool in the parifti, and another prin- 
cipally for its ufe, though it be fituated in a detached part 
of an(.ther parilh. In the winter months, there are 4, 5, 
or 6 mrlvate fchools kept up by the tenants. The whole 

• number 



of Logierait. , 8 1 

number of fcholars may exceed 300, of which fcarcely a 
third are girls ; as from the age of 8 or 9, the girls are eifa- 
ployed in fpinning. 

Manners, Ceneral aJjaraBer, 6c.--T\it general charafler 
of the people of this parifh is fnfficiently refpeftable. The vir- 
tues of humanity, frugality, and induftry, the beft ornaments 
of human nature, flourilh among them. In the war, which 
terminated happily in the beginning of his prefent Majefty's 
reign, many became foldiers, and were diftinguilhed for 
their valour. But the military life has no longer the fame 
charms in their eyes. In an inland place, fuch as this, there 
are few temptations to a feafaring life. In winter, the wo- 
men fit clofely at their wheels j in fummer, they are em- 
ployed in field work. The men labour hard in fpring, 
fummer, and harveft ; in winter they enjoy fome relaxa- 
tion. The ordinary ftature of the men, in this parifh, is 
about 5 feet and a half; none exceed 6 feet 2 inches. 
The modes of drefs, and of living, in general, have altered 
and improved within thefe laft 20 years. No part of the old 
highland drefs is retained, except the philabeg, and the tartan 
hofe. The coat has fliort iklrts. Great coats are now more 
generally ufed than plaidsi The Sunday vefts are com- 
monly of ftriped cotton. Many of the young men wear 
watches. Many of the young women have printed cotton 
gowns, and duffle cloaks. And feveral of the farmers and 
handicraftfmen have now clocks in their houfes. Many of 
the young women affe notv taught to few and knit {lock- 
ings. Cleanlinefs is more carefully attended to, than it was 
20 years fince ; and cutaneous diforders have accordingly 
ceafed to prevail among them. Although abundantly fen- 
fible of the beneficial influence of law, as the guardian of 
property, they are now lefs difpofed to litigation, than they

once were. Twenty years lince, they were univerfally Jaco- 
bites ; they are now, however, well alfefted to the prefent go- 
vernment. The language fpoken here, is a corrupted dialed • 
of the Gaelic. The Saxon dialeft of the lowlands is, how. ; 
ever, pretty generally underftood here. The natives of this i 
parifli are acute and ingenious ; and it muft not be omitted, ' 
that Dr Adam Ferguflon, fo refpedable for his literary ta- , 
lents, his learning and eloquence, was born here. ;

, Roads and Bridges. — The intercourfe has not yet been \ 
fo confiderable, any where through this parilh, as to fuggeft 
the idea of making roads, with money borrowed upon the \ 
fecurity of tolls to be eftabliflied upon them. The road j 
lying north from the river Tummel, was firft made at the • 
expence of government, and is kept in repair by the fta- ' 
tute labour, with a little occafional affiftance from the fol- , 
diers ftationed in the country. The bridges upon that river, 
were built, and are ftill occalionally repaired by govern- 
ment. The road leading through Strath-Tay was made, • 
and continues to be kept in repair, by the ftatute labour ; 
it is good in fummer, but in many places deep and miry i 
in winter. The bridges upon the Strath-Tay road, were \ 
built by the county, with the affiftance of a fubfcription, \ 
and are at prefent in complete repair. The ftatiite labour : 
has not been yet converted into money ; and perhaps this 
faft may ferve better than any other, to mark the ftate cf 
induftry, and the progrefs of the fubdivifion of labour 
among the people.

Superjlitious Opinions and Praclices. — In this pariHi, and • 
in the neighbourhood, a variety of fuperftitious praftices 
ftill prevail among the vulgar, which may be in part the 
remains of ancient idolatry, or of the corrupted Chriftianity 
of the Romilb church, and partly, perhaps, the refult of 

the 



of Logierait.

the natural hopes and fears of the human mind, in a ft?tfe 
of fimplicitj and ignorance. Lucky and unlucky days are 
by many anxioufly obferved. That day of the iveek upon 
which the 14th of May happens to fall, for inftance, is 
cfteemed unlucky through all the remainder of the year ; 
none marry, or begin any ferious bufinefs upon it. None 
chufe to marry in January or May; or to have their banns 
proclaimed in the end of one quarter of the year, and to 
marry in the beginning of the next. Some things are to 
be done before the full moon ; others after. In fevers, the 
illnefs is expefted to be more fevere on Sunday, than on 
the other days of the week if eafier on Sunday, a relapfe 
is feared. 

Immediately before the celebration of the mai-riage cere- 
mony, every knot about the bride and bridegroom, (gar- 
ters, ftioe-ftrings, firings of petticoats, &amp;c.) is carefully loofen- 
ed. After leaving the church, the whole company walk 
round it, keeping the church walls always upon the right 
hand. The bridegroom, howdver, firft retires one way 
with fome young men, to tie the knots that were loofed 
•about him ; while the young married woman, in the fame 
manner, retires fomewhere elfe to adjuft the diforder of her 
drefs. 

When a child was baptifed privately, it was not longTmce 
cuftomary, to put the child upon a clean baiket, having a 
cloth previoufly fpread over it, with bread and cheefe put 
into the cloth ; and thus to move the baiket three times 
fucceffively round the iron croo'k, which hangs over the fire, 
from the roof of the houfe, for the purpofe of fupporting 
the pots when water is boiled, or vidluals are prepared. 
This might be anciently intended to counteraft the ma- 
lignant arts, which witches and evil fpirits were imagined 
to pra£life againft new born infants. 

Recourfe 



84 Statijlical Account 

Rccourfe is often had to charms, for the cure of difeafes 
of horfes and cows, no lels than in the human fpecies. In 
the cafe of various difeafes, a pilgrimage is performed to a 
place called Strathfdlan, 40 miles diftant from Logierait ; 
where the patient bathes in a certain pool, and performs 
fome other rites in a chapel which Hands near. It is 
chiefly in the cafe of madnefs, however, that the pilgrimage 
to Strathfillan is believed to be falutary. The unfortunate 
perfon is firft bathed in the pool, then left for a night bound 
in the chapel, and if found loofe in the morning, is expedted 
to recover. 

There is a difeafe called Glacach by the Highlanders, 
which, as it ajQfeds the cheft and lungs, is evidently of a 
confumptive nature. It is alfo called, " the Macdonald'.s 
" difeafe," becaufe there are particular tribes of Macdon- ' 
aids, ,who are believed to cure it with the charms of their 
touch, and the ufe of a certain fet of words. There mull 
be no fee given of any kind. Their faith in the touch of 
a Macdonald is very great. 

On the ift of May, O. S. a feftival called Beltan is an- 
nually held here. It is chiefly celebrated by the cow-herds, 
who alTemble by fcores in the fields, to drefs a dinner for 
tHemfelves, of boiled milk and eggs. Thefe diflies they 
eat with a fort of cakes baked for the occafion, and having 
fmall lumps in the form of nipples, raifed all over the fur- 
face. Tlie cake might perhaps be an offering to fome 
deity in the days of Druidifm. On the evening of the 31ft 
of Odober, O. S. among many others, one remarkable 
enough ceremony is obferved. Heath, broom, and dref- 
fmgs of flax, are tied upon a pole : This faggot is then 
kindled •, one takes it upon his flioulders, and running, 
bears it round the village ; a crowd attend : When the firft 
faggot is burnt out, a fecond is bound to the pole, and 

kindled

kindled in the fame manner as before. Numbers of thefe 
blazing faggots are often carried about together, and when 
the night happens to be dai'k, they form a fplendid illumi- 
nation. This is Halloween, and is a night of great feftivity. 

Thefe feveral particulars, if confidered feparately, may 
appear trifling ; but, taken all together, they form no incon- 
fiderable part of what, (with only fome flight variations,) 
the religion of the vulgar will always be, in every age, and 
in every ftage of fociety, and indeed, whatever be the religion 
which they profefs, unlefs they are fo grofsly ftupid, or fo fla- 
gitioufly immoral, as to be incapable of feeling the reftraints 
of any fyftem of religion, whether rational or fuperflitiouS. 

Curious Remains of A7itiquity, — None of the ftones called 
obelilks remain here \ but many of thofe ftones which are 
faid to have belonged to Druidical places of worftiip. The 
ruins of fome Popifli chapels are ftill to be feen. A Roman 
urn was found at the diftance of 8 miles from the village 
of Logierait. A medal (of Trajan it is believed) was 
found in this parifli, and has been given to Profeflor Fer- 
gufon of Edinburgh. A flint arrow-head, found near the 
village, was given to the late Duke of Atholl. In feve- 
ral places through the parifti, cairns of ftones, which are 
believed to h^ve been the fepulchral monuments of the 
rude ages, in which they were raifed, were lately to be 
feen. But the ftones of many of them have been ftnce 
carried away, and ufed in building walls. On the top of 
a rock, % miles from the manfe of Logierait, are the ruins 
of a building, which is thought to have been intended as a 
place for giving fignals by fires. About half a mile fronju 
the village, upon a high bank, near the ferry of Tummel, 
are the ruins of a caftle, which is faid to have been the re- 
sidence of Robert II, after he gave up the adminiftxation of 

the

the government into the hands of his brother, the Duke 
of Albany. The fituation commands a noble profpeft. 
The fojfe is flill pretty entire. The area within, is of an 
elliptical figure, having its long axis parallel to the ferry 
of Tummel. Near the caftle is a field, called Cannon-brae, 
upon which, if might believe tradition, was a battery. 

Remarkable NaturalPhenomena. — About thirty' years ago, 
a fliock of an earthquake was felt here ; its direftion was 
from eaft to weft ; its duration about a fecond or two. On 
the 25th of June 1778, a water fpout did confiderable da- 
mage upon a farm belonging to this parifli, but fituated in 
Rannoch. It was accompanied with a tremenduous thun- 
der-florm. The air was, at the fame time, darkened, and 
was felt to be fultry and ftifling, at the village of Logierait, 
but without thunder or rain. The globe of fire, which was 
feen in many places about eight or ten years fince, pafled 
very rapidly through our horizon. 

Seafons of Famine. — In 1782, the crop was bad, and the 
harveft late ; and, to add to the misfortune, the potatoes 
were generally deftroycd by frofts, which came on, in that 
feafon, earlier than ufual. Accordingly, in the fummer of 
1783, oat meal, made of bad foreign oats, was fold for i s. 
5d. a-peck-, and bear meal for is. a-peck. We received 
16 bolls I peck of barley meal, from the grant voted by 
Parliament, for the relief^ of the Highlands. The kirk- 
feffion, with the confent of the heritors, advanced a part of the 
mortified money under theirmanagement, in the way of loan, 
for the fa'ine purpofes ; and in better feafons, it has been 
fince repaid. Great humanity was Ihewn to the begging 
poor. Potatoes were ready for ufe, earlier in that leafon 
thaij ufual. And linen yarn happened luckily to bring, at 

the. 



of Logierait. 



the fame time, a very high price. By the beginning of 
Aug"ft» the general diftrefs was greatly relieved. In 1756, 
or 1757, corn and meal were nearly as dear as in 1783; 
but the price of yarn one third lower ; and the poor, by 
confequence, fuffered more in that feafon, than in 1783. 

It might have been mentibiied before, that as the pre- 
valent language of the parilli is Gaelic, the proper names 
of places are all of Gaelic derivation. Logierait, for in- 
ftance, is compounded of the two Gaelic words, Logan, a 
hollow place ; and Reite, tBe ending of differences ; and the place 
feems to have received the name from its low lituation, 
and from its having been the feat of the regality court of 
Atholl. The farm next adjoining to that, properly called 
Logierait, has received the name of Ballintoin, or Marfh- 
town, from its lituatiori, and the nature of the ground in it. 
Another, Ballinearn, or ^//i?r^ozf«, becaufe furrounded with 
brufli-wood of this fort. Another farm, which once belong, 
ed to the old Abbacy of Cupar, bears, in the fame man- 
ner, a Gaelic name, expreffive of that circumfknce. 

Improvements fuggejied. — It would tend much to the ad- 
vantage and cultivation of this country, if the fer vices perform- 
ed by the tenants were converted into money. At prefent 
they perform inany carriages to a diftance ; make the peats 
and carry them home : In part they till the ground of the pro- 
prietor in fpring, and cut down his corn in harveft. The efta- 
blifliment of manufaftures ; the enlargement of the farms, 
fo as to enable every farmer to keep a plough for himfclf ; 
the inclofure of the fields ; the divifion of the commons ; the 
ftraightening of the ridges in plowing; the giving up the 
prevalent praftice of r2/«-rz//^ej; and the fpreading of plan- 
tations of larches and Scotch firs over the wild and barren 
hills, would, no doubt, contribute greatly to improve the 
condition, and increafethe population of this parifli.

(county of BERWICK.) 
By the Rev. Mr Alexander Duncan.'</head>  


<p>
JSfame, Situation, and Extent, 

IT is faid that feveral perfohs of the name of Gordoii 
came to Britain with William the Conqueror, one of 
whom, having vifited Scotland during the reign of Malcolni 
Canmore, and having fortunately killed a wild boar, th^t 
had greatly infefted this neighbourhood, received, as a re- 
ward, a grant of certain lands in Merfe or Berwicklhire, to 
■which he gave his own name of Gordon. From him the Dukes 
of Gordon are defcended, and in memory of this gallant ac- 
tion, the white boar makes a part of the family arms. The 
Duke of Gordon is ftill fuperior of fome lands in the parifli. 
Thofe of Eaft and Weft Gordon, Huntly, and Huntly-wood, 
belonged in property to his anceftors; one of whom, how- 
ever, having obtained very confiderable poflTeffions in the 
north, was thence induced to change his place of refidence, 
and to live in that part of Scotland. 

The parifh wss formerly of very large extent ; but has' 
fince been difmembered, and part of it called Durrington- 
laws, annexed to Ldngformacus, 12 miles diftant. Out of it, 
about the year 1647, was alfo ereded the parifh of Wef- 
truther, or Woolftruther, comprehending Baffendean, a 

church' 



of Gordon. 



89 



:hurch and parifti, formerly in the prefbytery of Melrofe. 
Gordon is fituated in the county of Berwick, in the prefty- 
tery of Lauder, and in the fynod of Merfe and Teviotdale. 
The church (lands at Weft Gordon, 33 miles diftant from 
Edinburgh, and 23 from Berwick. The great road from 
Edinburgh to London, by Greenlaw and Cornhill, runs 
through the northern part of it, for about two miles. 
Gordon is ftill apariih of great extent, being 7 miles long 
from \V. to E. but unequal in its breadth, one half being 
about 1 miles, the other half 4 miles broad ; the figure is con- 
fequently irregular. 

Soil, Climate, Rivers, iSc.—The furface is uneven. There 
are three or four rifing grounds, or hills, one of which is of 
fome height, and is not yet entirely cultivated, though two 
fides of it are plowed ; the others are all cultivated to the 
top. There are many pieces of good arable land, fome of 
it clayey, but more light and fandy. There are alfo great 
trafts of mooi', of mofs, and bfcg. The air is not unwhole- 
fome, though, from the quantity of mofs and bog, damps 
muft arife. Some years ago agues were prevalent. Of 
late confumptions have been more common than former- 
ly. The river Eden runs through this parilli from to 
S. and Blackadder runs on the north fide for a mile or two, 
both fmall rivers, in which there are fome trouts and eels. 
There are whinftones in great abundance, and fome white 
and red freeftone. The former are on the furface, the latter 
dug out of the ground ; both are ufed for building. 

Cattle. — Improvements in the breed of fiieep and cattle 
have made rapid progrefs, fince the turnip hufbandry com- 
menced 15 or i^^ears ago. At that time Iheep were fold, 
at a year old, for fix or eight Ihillings. By raifing for them

Statijlical j4ccount 



better food, and mending the breed by crofTing with Mr Cul- 
ley's rams, they have, this year, been fold at the fame age, 
for fifteen and fixteen fliillings. Black cattle alfo are greatly 
improved in number and value. In winter 1775-6, there 
were only 1 1 beafls fed with turnips for the butcher, and in 
winter 1781-2, at the diftance of only fix years, there were 
2,00 fattened in the parifli, beficfes fome fcores of fheep. 
This bufmefs is flill continued and increafed, though not fo 
much in the numbers of cattle fed, as in feeding them to 
greater value. L. 10 Was, at that time, reckoned a great 
price •■, now they are fed to L. 15, L. 18, and even L. 20 
value. 

Population. — Since the ereflion of the parilh of Wellru- 
ther, the parifli of Gordon has been confidered as confifting 
of about 600 examinable perfons. The returns to Dr Web- 
fter, in 1755, was 737 fouls. In 1771, when the firftliftof 
examinable perfons was taken by the pref9nt incumbent, 
they confifted of 630, in 177^, of 530. In 1790, they rofe 
to 676, and, in 1791, a particular lift of all defcriptions and 
ages having been made, the number of fouls was found to be 
912. Of thefe 472 are females, and 440 males. The number 
of inhabited houfes is 217, fo that there are more than four 
to each family. Although a regifter is kept, as appointed 
by aft of Parliament, of marriages, chriftenings, and bu- 
rials, it is fo inaccurate, that no confidence can be placed in 
it. The feflion-clerks, in place of taking 3 d. for each mar- 
riage, take it for each proclamation of banns ; fo that a cou- 
|)le, proclaimed in the pariflies where each refided, and 
married in a third parilli, \iave paid three times inftead of 
once.

Though there are no remarkable inftances of longevity, 
iftany perfons have died, aged from 70 'to 90. One or two 
are now alive aged 92 years. The number of Seceders 
amount to 130. There are neither Epifcopals nor Roman 
Catholics in theparifli. The diminution of the number of in- 
habitants, from 1771 to 1778, was owing to two or three 
fmall farms, in different' places in the parifh, having been let 
to onetenant. The increafe of population from 1778 to 1790, 
was vifibly owing to feuing ground by a plan for a village 
at Weft Gordon, where, though purchafers have built good 
houfes for themfelves, and fome for tradefmen and day-la- 
bourers, the farms being better cultivated, yet the tenants 
have been obliged to build houfes to accommodate their fer- 
vants and labourers. Many of the tenants and their fervants 
have 6 or 7, and fome 8 and 10 children by one wife. A 
farmer died this year, who had 15 children by one wife, 9 
of whom furvivedhim. Amealmaker died lately, who had 
been twice married, and was the father of 18 legitimate 
children, 9 of whom furvived him. A labouring man died 
a few years ago, aged 80, who had been the father of 20 le- 
gitimate children, of thefe only 3 furvived him. He had 
been thrice married.

■Agriculture. — Since the turnip hufbandry commenced, 
much greater quantities of corn have been raifed in the pa- 
rifh. In the year 1775, one farm produced no more rough 
bear, than what was ne'ceffary to fow the ground again, pay 
the fervants their proportion of wages, and maintain the fa- 
mily. The fame fann, within thefe three years, produced 
barley for thefe neceffary purpoles (which is fnperior to bear 
IS. 6d. or 3s. the boll,) and from it were fold 240 bolls, 
in the Lothian markets, at 18 s. the boll and upwards. The 
proprietors, fenfible of the induftry and aftivity of their te- 
nants, have adopted a wife plan to promote further improve- 
ments, by giving them a renewal for 21 years, feveral years 
previous to the expiration of the old leafes. 

Chtrch. — The king is undoubted patron of this parilh. In 
1767 the Earl of Home claimed the patronage, and raifed 
an aftion of declarator, when, after a litigation of 18 
months, his claim was difmiffed for want of evidence. The 
incumbent, in confequence of that decifion, was fettled in 
1770. The number of heritors is 8. None of themrelide 
in the parifli. 

Poor. — The poor are regularly fupplied by a meeting of 
the heritors, minifter and elders, who alTefe the parilh half 
yearly for that purpofe. Their numbers have been from 12 
to 24, young and old, yearly. In 1783 oat-meal was at 2 s. 
6d. and upwards, the ftone, bear and peafe-meal were fcarce- 
ly to be had. The heritors of the parlfli gave money to the 
kirk-feffion, to enable them to fell oat-meal to poor houfe- 
holders at a difcount of 8 d. and 6 d. the ftone, which was of 
great ufe to preferve them from want. White peafe were 
imported at Leith and Fifhen ow in fpring and fummer. 
The farmers and miiiifter brought white peafe from Leith, 

&amp;c,.

Sec. carriage free, and then ibid the meal at the prime coft of 
the peafe at Leith, to all in the parifli who had no horfes 
of their own; this was continued for five months. 

Wages, Fuel. — Men fervants wages arc L. 6 and L. 7 a- 
year ; women's L. 3 and L. 4. ; day-labourers get i s. a-daj, 
more or lefs according to ability ; mafons is. 8 d. car- 
penters IS. 6 d. tailors i s. Peat and turf is the commoa 
fuel, but from the expence of labour to obtain them, coals 
are more ufed than formerly, though purchafed at is. the 
hundred weight, or brought 24 miles from the Lothians. 

Antiquities. — There are two farms in the pariih, called 
Rumbleton and Rumble tonlaw, which, tradition fays, is a 
corruption of Romantown and Romantownlaw. At the 
latter farm, there were lately appearances of extenfive forti- 
fications on a law or hill, which is now all plowed over, 
and inclofures made with the ftones. At Huntly there are 
remains of walls, like fome caftle or fortified place. Near 
the manfe, appearances of fortifications flill remain, and the 
place ftill retains the name of the Cajlles. There it would ap- 
pear the anceilors of the Duke of Gordon's family had for- 
merly refided. 

Ma7i7ifaBures and Commerce. — There have been, for many- 
years, three corn mills driven by water, employed in grind- 
iag corn for the Lothian markets ; which have manufactu- 
red more than ten or twelve thoufand bolls in one year. The 
mill mailers, and many other people called meal-makers, 
drive the meal to Edinburgh, Dalkeith, Muffelburgh, Pref- 
tonpans, Sec. Formerly they ufed to carry it on horfes backs ; 
but, for upwards of 25 years paft, fince the turnpike roads 
■were made through Berwicklhire, they have carried it in 
- carts, 



94 



Stati/lical Account 



carts, drawn by two horfes, and, in return, they bring fait, 
coals, merchant goods, oyfters, iron, wood for building, and 
great quantities of burnt limeftone, which greatly forwards 
the improvements in hufbandry. ij 

Mifcellaneous faBs and Obfervations.— 'During more than 
30 years, only one eftate has been bought or fold. The reft 
have all gone by fucceffion. By the fale of that eftate and 
fucceffions fince, the property has been in five diSerent hands 
during the courfe of 24 years. Some families have been, 
for many generations, in the fame farms. One of them had 
been proprietors of the land they now rent: Another of 
thefe families fay, that their forefathers have been in the ? 
farm for 200 years, and the other two, that their anceftors , 
have been 300 years in the farms*. • | 

The roads are repaired by converting the ftatute labour, 
according to an aft of Parliament paffed 16 or 18 years ago. 
But there is ftill little amendment made, confequently they 
are in very bad order. The beft land is let at 20 s. a guinea, 
and L. I, 3 s. the acre. The inferior at all prices, according 
to comparative value : no acres of moor lands were feued 3 
or 4 years ago, the beft quality at L. 5 the acre, the fecond 
beft at L.3,and the worft at L. i 163. with i s. the acre o£. 
feu annually. The people are fenfible of the great benefit 

of inclofing land. 

A rage for raifing tobacco prevailed in 1782, and many 
acres of the beft land were occupied with it, which diminifli- 
ed the crops of corn. But a bill, paffed in parliament in 1783, 

cured 

*A great grandmother of one of the prefert tenants, in one of thefe: 
farms told his neighbour, who died not many years ago, that flie flood m. 
her own door, and faw the walls of Hosnc Caftle beat down by OUver-

red the frenzy. That bill allowed only 4 d. the pound for 
ic tobacco, though it was no illicit trade ; whereas,'to many, 
. the pound would fcarcely have paid the price of land rent, 
e expence of labour, &amp;c. 

The manner of living, drefs, and manners of the people 
0 greatly improved, within thefe laft 20 years. Learning, in 
particular, is more generally difFufed than formerly, in,proof 
of which it may be remarked, that feveral of the farmers 
here, have become fubfcribers to the public libraries in the 
neighbouring town of Kelfo, by which they are enabled to 
acquire an extent of knowledge and information, to which, 
otherwife, they could not have had accefs.

Situation, and Extent. 

r-pHIS parifli belongs to the prelbytery of Deer, andSy- 
^ nod of Aberdeen *. It lies along the Murray Frith, 
in a reaangular form, its eaftern extremity being two miles 
weft from Kinnaird's head, a confpicuous point in Aber- 
deenfhire, where a light-houfe was lately erefted by go- 
vernment. It extends 3 miles and a half in length w^eft- 
ward, and is 3 miles broad in every part, from the fea-coaft 
to the fouth. A public road, leading from Fraferburgh weft- 
ward to Banff, interfeas it nearly in the middle, from which 
there is a gentle declivity on each fide, to the fouth and 
north. 

6*027, Climate, ^ c— The face of the country is, in general, 
level, there being no hill in the pariQi ; neither is there any 
river or lake in it, nor fo much as a confiderable Itream. 

In 

" It is the lad eredted parifli within that prefbytery. ITie lands of Pit- 
tendrum were formerly in the parifli of Fraferfburgh, and a few farms be- 
longed to that of Tyrie, but the greateft part of it to Aberdour, from which 
it was disjoined, upon an application frora,Lord Pitfligo, in 1(534, about the 
time when he obtained his patent of peerige.

in fummer, the mills can fcarcely perform any work,- owing 
to a deficiency of water ; but there is a fufficient fupply of 
that valuable element for the common purpofes of life. As 
there is little marihy ground in the parilh, there are feldom 
any fogs in it. The air is dry and wholefome, but the nor- 
therly ftorms are fometimes hurtful to the crops, as the court- 
try is deftitute of trees, and every kind of ftielter. On the 
fouth fide of the road above mentioned, the foil is generally 
black and Ught, very well adapted for grafs, but not fit for 
producing weighty crops of grain. Towards the north, the 
foil is generally a yellow clay, which produces barley of a 
good quality, and is moftly all in tillage. In this quarter, 
the farmers make ufe of ffea ware as a manure. They have 
iikewife the advantage of an inexhauftible bank of fea fiiells, 
which extends along the whole coaft; arid a due quantity of 
which, when laid on .the fields, produces the fame efFedt as 
iime, marie, or any other calcareous fubftance. This parifli 
abounds with ftones of all fizes, and is therefore extremely 
well adapted for being laid out in inclofures. 

Cairns.— Qn the fide of the high road, from Fraferlburgh 
to Banff, are fome cairns or tumuli, about 60 feet in. circum- 
ference at the bafe, compofed of round ftones, piled up in a 
conical fhape to the height of 30 feet. There are feveral 
fimilar cairns in the neighbouring pariflies, and they are evi- 
dently monumental repofitories of the dead. On opening 
one of them fome years ago, large flag ftones were found 
placed in the ground, in the form of a cheft or coffin, and 
containing aflies of burnt bones. Some arrow heads of flint 
were alfo found, but no weapons of metal of any kind ; 
whence it may be conje£tured, that they are of great anti- 
quity. Tradition fays, that they are the burying places of 
ioftile invaders from Denmark or Norwaiy, who were de- 

VoL. V. N feated

Statiftical Account 



feated in that neighbourhood, and feem to have been purfued 
with flaughter a great way along the coaft, where feveral 
I'uch tumuli are ftill to be feen!" 

T!rees. — It has been a generally received opinion, fhat 
trees will not grow in thk neighbourhood, by reafon of the 
fea fpray being hurtful to their vegetation ; but with more 
probability, becaufe of the N. W. winds, which fweep the 
whole face of the country, and check them in their growth. 
Yet it is certain, that the greateft part of this country muft 
have been once covered with wood, as appears from the 
roots of very large oaks, ftill exifting in mofles nigh the 
coaft. Sir William Forbes of Pitfligo has planted, within 
thefe few years, a piece of ground with foreft trees of all 
kinds, adjoining to the old houfe or caftle of Pitfligo, and 
within about a mile of the fea, which h-atherto feem to thrive 
very well And this experiment will probably determine, 
whether the prejudice, againft the poffibility of rearing tim- 
ber upon this coaft, be well or ill founded. 

ManufaRurcs, Fijheries, iic. — A confiderable quantity of 
kelp is made upon the fhore of this parifti, which is about 
3I miles in extent. At the diftance of half a mile from its 
eaftern extremity, is the fiftiing town of Pittaly, belonging 
to Sir William Forbes, which contains 23 houfes, and ii5 
inhabitants. It fends 4 fiftiing boats to fea, with 6 men in 
each. Two miles further weft is the fiftiing town of Rofe- 
hearty, which employs 7 boats, with the fame number of men 
in each. From autumn to the end of January, haddocks 
are the moft valuable fifti, being then in greateft perfeftion. 
When bought upon the ftiore, they coft i s. the dozen, 
though 4 years ago, they were fold at 6d. This rife in the 
price is afcribed to the greater fcarcity of fifli, to their being 

of

of a larger llze, and to the advanced price of provifions in 
.reneral. The worfl feafon for fifliing is from January to 
March, little elfe being then caught but fmall cod. But in 
fummer, befides cod, both fkate and ling are taken in great 
abundance. In July and Auguft, the greateft attention is 
paid to fiftiing for fea dogs, which are chiefly valuable for 
their oil. The value of lobfters has increafed greatly of 
late. They are caught in nunabers, and are fold at 2 d. or 
2i-d. a-piece for the London market. Thefifliermen fait up in 
caiks the haddocks and cod taken during the winter, and in 
April, or, as foon as the feafon will permit, take them out 
and dry them. Thefe, with what fiili are caught and dried 
during the fummer, they cajrry about in large boats, and 
difpofe of among the diiFerent towns on the Frith of Forth, 
and bring home cargoes of coals and fait. Tt is faid, that they 
get even lower prices for their filh in the fouth country, than 
at home; but to this the filheraien reply, that as they can- 
not difpofe of the whole at home, it is of little advantage to 
fell a part ; that they wifh to make up a cargo, and receive 
a fum of money at once. Thus the price of the article is 
kept up in this part of the country. 

V illage o/Rofehearty. — ^Four miles weft from Fraferfburgh, 
upon the fea coaft, is the village of Rofehearty, which 
belongs to Lord Gardenfton; and contains 42 houfes, 
and 213 inhabitants. There are feveral fhopkeepers in it, 
and mechanics, fuch as joiners, blackfmiths, coopers, turners, 
flioemakers, &amp;c. Two merchants have fliares of floops, 
and import wood from Norway ; they likewife bring groce- 
ries from the fouth country. 

Agriculture, Farms, Sifc. — This parifli is divided into 
farms of various extent. There are fome of 200 acres, but 
•the generality are much fmaller. Some part of the land is 

the 



100 



Statijiical Account 



the befl: in the country ; other parts of it are very indifferent, 
lo that it is not eafy to afcertain tlie average rent. The 
beft land, nigh the fhore, where ware can eafily be obtained, 
is let at from 20 s. to 30 s. an acre. Excepting one or two 
farms in the fouth part of this parifh, the foil is not fit for 
producing oats : it yields more profitable crops of barley and 
beans, which laft is prevailing generally ; and a newly intro- 
duced praftice, of drilling and hoeing them, is a great im- 
provement to the crop and to the foil. Beans and oats are ; 
fown as early as the feafon will permit, commonly in the be- ' 
ginning of March ; after which, the time is taken up in 
dunging and plowing the land for barley, which is the prin- / 
cipal crop nigh the coaft, and which is fown during the laft \ 
three weeks of May. The month of June is occupied in ^ 
preparing the ground for turnips, and fowing them. The 
iremaining part of the fummer is employed in making hay, 
drying and leading home peats, and repairing the highways 1 
until harveft, which lafts commonly through the months of 
September and Oftober. Moft of the farmers fow fmall ; 
quantities of flax, which they fell to manufa£lurers, when \ 
fpun into yarn, or employ for the ufe of their own families. 1 

1 

Cattle, Produce, i^c, — The chief articles, which the farmer 
has to difpofe of, are, firft, black cattle, which, for fome years 
have fold high, and have been of confiderable advantage to \ 
this country. The number kept upon each farm has, of 
late, been as large as it will maintain. The higheft price 
of an ordinary ox is L. 10 Sterling, but the prices are very 
various, bearing proportion to the quality, and the demand 
which may be at the time. Moft farmers rear what horfes 
are neceflary for themfelves, but they do not pay fo great at- 
t;ention to the breeding of horfes for fale, as of black cattle. 
Xs this parifli contains no extenfive paftures, there are but

-vv flieep in it. The common kind are fold at lo s. each j 
:hofe of the Englifh breed are reckoned worth double that 
fum. The next principal commodities, which the farmers 
difpofe of, are meal and grain. A fmall proportion only is fold 
111 the coimtry, as moft of the inhabitants have crofts of their 
own. Meal is exported to Norway, or fold in the weftern 
3 ifles ; grain is commonly difpofed of in the Frith of Forth. 
3 Barley weighs from 1 6 to 20 ftone the boll, of i6 pecks ; the 
i price is from 8d. to lo d. the ftone. Beans are fold at 12 s. 
6 d. the boll of 3 firlots, oats at from 10 s. to 12 s. the boll of 
4 firlots ; and oat meal at from 10 s. to 13 s. the boll of 8 
ftone. Butter and cheefe are alfo articles for which the 
farmers draw a confiderable fum yearly. Some advantage 
is likewife derived from the labour of women fervants with- 
in doors, who are employed, efpecially in winter, in fpinning 
linen yarn, or making cloth. 

Wages. — The wages of a labouring man in fummer is 
8 d. the day. Moft of thefe labourers rent a fmall piece of 
land, at about L. 2 Sterling yearly, upon which they keep a 
cow, and raife grain to aflift in fupporting their families. 
Thus they live pretty comfortably. But no complaints are 
made by fuch as have not this advantage, except when they 
have large families, or are vifited with ficknefs. The daily 
wages of a mafon are is. 4 d. ; of a joiner is. ; but other me- 
chanics are commonly paid, not by the day, but by the piece. 
The wages of a man fervant are L. 5 Sterling yearly, and of 
a woman, L. 2, 10 s. befides vidhials. 

Fuel. — One of the moftexpenfive articles in this place is 
fuel, the mofs, where peats are got, being five miles diftant. 
Peats are eftimated by the leet, which is a folid body, piled 
pp like bricks, 24 feet long, and 12 feet broad at bottom, and 

12 



102 



Statijlical Account 



12 feet high. This quantity is not fufficient for an ordinary 
farmer one year; itcofts L. i, los. for cutting it out and dry- 
ing it in the mofs, and when brought to this place, it is worth 
about L. 5 Sterling. The.farmers bring home their peats 
with their own horfes, in the end of fummer ; but it is a la- 
borious and expenfive work, und detains them long from the 
improvement of the land. Englifh coals are fold here at 
_5 s. the boU of 36 ftone ; Scotch coals at 4 s. 6 d. The high 
duty upon coals, which are brought to the north country, is 
Juftly complained of, as an improper and partial tax. Were 
that article furnillied at a moderate expence, it would be 
one of the moft important advantages which this country 
could receive. In this cafe, the more judicious farmers would 
£hew an example of the ufe of coals to others, and devote 
their time more clofely to the cultivation of the foil. But 
whatever improvements are or may be propofed here, either 
with refpe£t to agriculture or manufaftures, the dearth of 
fuel, is, and muft continue to be an obftacle, which, without 
the aid of the Legiflature, can never be removed. 

Population. — The number, returned to Dr Webfter in 
1755, was 1224. The number of people, at prefent in this 
parifli, (^a?ino 1791) is 1300, viz. of males 600, of females 
700. There is therefore anincreafe of 76 ; of thefe there are 
under 10 years of age 400; above it, 900. With refpeft to 
religious perfualion, there are jO Epifcopalians, and 20 Sece- 
ders. The annual average of births for fome time paft has 
been 34, of deaths 18, and of marriages 9. 

Heritors, Rent, l^c. — The manlion-houfe of Pitfligo, 
(now in ruins,) the gardens and adjoining farm, the feat of 
the ancient Lords of Pitfligo, to the extent of 2 miles along 
the coaft, belong to Sir William Forbes of Pitfligo, the 

reprefentative 



of Fitjligo. 



cprefentative of that family. The remaining part of the 
cllate of Pitfligo, extending about a mile and a half along 
the fea-coaft, belongs to Lord Gardenfton. The lands of Pit, 
taly and Pittendrum belong to Sir William Forbes, having 
been lately purchafed by him, from the deceafed William 
Cumine, Efq; of Pittaly. The reft of the parifh is the pro- 
perty of Lord Saltoun, and of Alexander Frafer, Efq-, of 

dchen. The valued rent of Pitfligo is L. 2400 Scotch. 

Emifient Men. — The firft minifter of this parifli was Mr 
Andrew Cant, who had formerly been chaplain in Lord 
Pitfligo's family. From this place he removed to Aber- 
deen, where he is faid to have preached before K. Charles II. 
after his return from the continent, but before his Reftoration. 
The Speftator mentions this Mr Andrew Cant, No. 147, 
here he fays, that he was minifter of an illiterate part 
i the north of Scotland, and derives the term canting from 
'his name, though it feems more probably to have been de- 
rived from the Latin. 

Church.— The King is patron. The manfe was built a- 
bout 22 years ago; but the church ftands much in need of 
reparation, which, it is hoped, will take place in a fliort 
time. The value of the living, including the glebe, is 
about L. 65 Sterling. 

Poor— The capital of the poor's funds belonging to this 
parifli, is about L. 100 Sterling, the greateft part of 
jvhich is lent at intereft; and the weekly colleaions amount 
to L. 22 Sterling yearly. The number of poor, at prefent 
receiving charity, is 28, to each of whom the kirk.fefl5on dif- 
tributes yearly i6 s. fometimes more or lefs, according to 
their neceffities. This cannot fupport the poor ; it only 

affifts 



104 Statijlical Account 

afllfts them. There are fome, however, in greater neceflity^ 
who receive yearly more than twice that fum. The poor 
in Sir William Forbes's lands, and in other parts of the pa- 
rifti, have been greatly affifted for fome time paft, by liberal 
donations of meal and money from that gentleman. 

ImproiiemenU Suggepd.—TY^-^ parifti prefents a very ob- 
vious means of improvement in agriculture, which is, to 
divide and inclofe the ground with ftone dikes, or other fen- 
ces. There is no fpot in the country better adapted for that 
purpofe. The inclofures ought to be fo contrived as to con- 
tain water in them; and if proper terms were concerted be- 
tween the heritors and their tenants, for inclofing the fields, 
it would contribute greatly to the convenience of the far- 
mer, and the melioration of the foil. The heritors feem to 
be fenfible of the propriety of this improvement, and are ta- 
king meafures for carrying it into effea. Sir WiUiam For- 
bes has lately, at his own expence, inclofed and laid out m 
grafe about lOO acres of his lands in this parifh. Mr WHliam 
Gordon has inclofed about the fame extent of a farm, which 
he holds in leafe from Lord Gardenfton, and has, in a very 
few years, brought the land into a ftate of high improve- 

Another improvement, which this place (lands greatly irx 
need of, is the introduaion of manufaaures, by which cm- 
ployment might be given to more hands, and more money 
brought into circulation. Between Peterhead and Banff, 
which is a diftance of nearly 40 miles, there is no manufac- 
ture of importance. Hence the large towns have increafed 
greatly, and the country is drained of people and of money. 

Might' 

■ » An error ftill prevails, airong many farmers in this place, of keeping too- 
many fmallhorfe,. and doing, no work with oxen, which ar* on mnny ac 
counts more profitable. 



ofPitJligO. lO: 



Might it not be proper for the heritors of the parifli, who 
are all very refpedable gentlemen, and diftinguiflied for at- 
tention to the interefts of their country, to attempt the efta- 
bliHiment of fome fuitable manufaaures in it ? In a place 
where living is cheaper than in large towns, they certainly 
might be expeded to fucceed, with very little encourage. 



ment 



The laft improvement, which the parifti Hands much in 
need of, is the making of a harbour at Rofehearty. There is 
already a quay, or one fide of a harbour at that place, 
where floops lie between AprH and September. But even 
then, fo changeable is the weather, that they are in danger of 
fuftaining great damage. This brings an additional expence 
upon trade, as goods muft be brought from Fraferfburgh, 
the neareft port, by land carriage. Lord Gardenfton has 
generoufly ordered a confiderable fum of money to be laid 
out in the improvement of this harbour, and meafures will 
foon be taken for carrying that pubHc fpirited intention in- 
to effed. This is a neceffary and important alteration ; and 
it is hoped it will be the means of introducing other effen- 
tial improvements.

NO fatisfaftory account can be givea of the origin of the 
name. In old records, it is written Skuny. The old 
church was fituated upon a fmall eminence, like an artificial 
mound, ftill employed as a burying ground, with a deep 
hollow on all fides. Such as are acquainted with the Erfc; 
language may, perhaps, be able to trace fome conneftion be- 
tween the name and fituation. Like the names of many 
other places in this country, it is probably of Celtic origin. 
The parifh is fituated in the county of Fife, and prelbytery 
of Kirkcaldy ; from which place it is 9 ftatute miles diftant- 
It is about 5 miles long, from fouth to north ; and nearly two 
miles in breadth. At the N. E. extremity, the three pa- 
rifhes of Scoonie, Largo, and Ceres, and the three prefbyte- 
ries of Kirkcaldy, St Andrew's, and Cupar, meet in one 
point. 

The ground rifes by a gentle flbpe, all the way from the 
Forth, nearly to the north end of the parifli ; and almoft 
every part of it commands an extenfive and beautiful view 
of the Forth, Leith, Edinburgh, and the Lothians, from 
St Abb's head to the Queensfcrry : The greateft part of 

the 



i)f Scoonie,

the parilh is inclofed with ditch and hedge : There are no 
hills, but feveral fwells or rifings of the ^;round, wJuch, 
with belts and clumps of planting, afford a finely variegated 
■profpeft. 

5oz7, Climate. — ^There arc not lo acres of unarable ground 
in the whole dillridl, but the foil is of different kinds : The 
fouthern and lower part of the parilh, comprehending about 
two thirds of it, confifts pstrtly of a dry lharp foil, yielding 
good crops of all forts of grain, and of excellent quality, ex- 
cept in very dry weather ; and partly of a rich heavy loam, 
yielding large crops in all feafons. The northern and higher 
part of the parilh is a moift black foil, of which a large pro- 
portion is generally in pafture, for which it is well adapted; 
and when broke up, after lying 8 or lo years, yields two 
or three very heavy crops. The climate in the lower part 
of the parilh is, in general, very mild and temperate ; but 
the E. and S. E. winds, blowing from the fea, are, efpe- 
cially in the fpSring months, extremely fharp and penetra- 
ting. In the northern part of the parifti, the climate is more 
unkindly, and the harveft two or three weeks later, owing 
to the greater moifture of the foil, and its more elevated 
fituation. The inhabitants are, in general, healthy, and not 
fubjeft to any epidemical difeafe. Inoculation has not yet 
become fo general as in fome other parts of the country, but 
the people's prejudices againft it are gradually fubfiding* 

Produce, Agriculture. — The crops in the lower part of 
the parifli are wheat, peafe and beans, barley, oats, pota- 
toes, turnips, cabbage, flax and grafs. Almoft all the 
ground, defigned for pafture^ is fown with artificial grafe. In 
the higher part of the parilh, the crops ace, barley, oats, po- 
tatoes, a fmall proportion of peafe, fome turnips and flax. 

There 



io8 Statijlical Account 

There is fcarce anj flax raifed, excepting what is for pri- 
vate life. The produce of oats, peafe and potatoes, is whol- 
ly confumed in the parifh, and a confiderable quantity of 
oat meal is brought from the inland parts of the country. 
There is no fixed mode of cukivation. Wheat is fometimes 
fown after fallow, drilled beans, potatoes, or grals that has 
lain a year or two. Some fields produce wheat and beans 
alternately, and generally yield very good crops. Every far- 
mer raifes a confiderable quantity of turnips, which are now 
employed rather for rearing young beafts, than in feeding cat- 
tle for the market. Since the price of black cattle has been 
advanced to fuch a rate, the farmers have reared a much 
larger quantity than formerly. Such as occupy a farm of 
200 acres or fo, raife annually 14 or. 16 calves, which are 
fold at 2, 3, or 4 years old. Veal is now become a very 
rare arjiicle in our markets. 

Within thefe 20 years, there is a very great alteration in 
the mode of plowing. In place of 4 horfes, or 4 and fome- 
- times 6 oxen, yoked in one plough, the land is now ge- 
nerally plowed with 2 horfes ; one man holding the plough 
and managing the horfes. 

Rent. — The valued rent of the parifli is L. 46g2, 8 s. 
Scotch, and the real rent L.2000 Sterling. Land lets at from 
L. I, 10 s. to L. 3 Sterling per acre. In large farms with 
old leafes, the rent is from 5 s. to 15 s. But as the leafes ex- 
pire, there is always a very confiderable rife. Pafl:ure 
grounds let at from L, i, to L. i, 10 g. per acre. 

River and Fijloing. — The river of Leven, which hath its 
fource from the lake of that name, runs along the foutli 
fide of this parifh, from welt to eaft, and, takes a turn to the 
fputh, about a quarter of a mile before it is difcharged into 

'the 



of Scoonie. 



z fea. It abounds with excellent trout of various kinds ; 
and at the mouth of the river, there is a falmon fifliing, which 
belongs to the eftate of Durie. The greateft part of the 
falmon caught here is carried over land to Perth, or Nevv- 
burgh, where they are fliipped for the London market. On 
this river there are from 36*10 40 mills, of different defcrip- 
tions, within the fpace of 11 or 12 miles. 

; Population. — The return to Dr Webfter in 1755, was 
1528 fouls. The number of inhabitants in this parifli at 
prefent-, («7Z«o 1791,) is 1675; confequently the increafe 
amounts to 147.

Heritors.

' StatiJUcal Account 



Heritors. — There are feven large proprietors in the parifli, 
and two fmall ones : Only two of the greater heritors refidc 
in it, viz. Mr Chriftie of Durie, and Mr TuUidelph of ' 
Kilmux. The proprietor of Durie pofleffes above three 
fifths of the valued rent of the parifti. The houfe of Du- 
Tie is an elegant modern building, fituated on a rifing 
ground, about a mile north from the Forth, and commanding ; 
a moft delightful profpedl ; with an extenfive policy, laid 
out in very good tafte. Few places in the country can boaft: . 
of a more eligible fituation. No eliate in the parifli is un- . 
der entail. 

Eminent Men. — Till within thefe few years, the eftate of 
Durie had been, for near two centuries, the property of the | 
refpeflable family of Gibfon, fome of whom were particular- 
] y eminent in the law department. One of that family was Lord 
Regifter, and another a Lord of Seflion. Of the latter an anec- i 
dote is reported, which ftrongly marks the barbarity of the . , 
times. There being an important caufe between two noble-- 
men, in dependence before the Court of Seflion, Lord Durie, , 
•while taking an airing on the fands of Leith, was forcibly 
carried off by one of them, in order to prevent him fromi 
giving his vote at the decifion of the caufe, which the party r 
apprehended would be unfavourable to his intereft. 

But of all the eminent men born in this parifli, noije has 
been more remarkable for genius and learning, than Mr Je- 
rome Stone. His father, (a reputable feafaring man,) dying 
abroad, when Jerome was but three years old, the mother, 
ivith her young family, was left in very narrow circumftan- 
ces. Jerome, like the reft of the children, having got the or- 
dinary fchool education, reading Englifli, writing and arith- 
metic, betook himfelf to the bufinefs of a travelling chapman.

not fulting his fuperior genius, he foon converted his little ftock 
into books, and, for fome years, went through the country, 
and'attended the fairs as an itinerant bookfeller. There is great 
reafon to believe, that he engaged in this new fpecies of traf- 
i\c, more with a view to the improvement of his mind, than 
for any pecuniary emolument. Formed by nature for li- 
terature, he poflefled a peculiar talent for acquiring lan- 
guages with amazing facility. By a ftrange prediledlion, 
lie firft applied to the ftudy of the Hebrew and Greek ; and, 
by a wonderful effort of genius and application, made him-- 
felf fo far mailer of thefe languages, without any kind of af- 

. fiftance, as to be able to interpret the Hebrew Bible and 
Greek Teftament into Engllfh ad aperturam libri. At this 
time he did not know one word of Latin. Senfible that he 
could make no great progrefs in learning, without the 
knowledge of Latin grammar, he made application to the 
ihen parifh fchoolmafter, Mr John Tufcan, (who is ftill 
alive), for his afllftance. Some time after, by the countenance 
and patronage of the late Reverend and learned Principal 
Tullidelph, an heritor of this parilh, he was encouraged to 
profecute his ftudies at the Univerfity of St Andrew's. Ant 

(Unexampled proficiency in every branch of literature recom- 
mended him to the efteem of the Profeffors : and an uncom- 
mon fund of wit and pleafantry rendered him, at the fame 
time, the favourite of all his fellow lludents, fome of whom 
fpeak of him to this day, with an enthufiaftic degree of ad- 
miration and refpeft. About this period, fome very humo- 
rous poetical pieces of his compofition were publiflied in the 
Scots Magazine. Before he had finiflied his third felfion at 
St Andrew's, on an application to the College, by the 
Reftor of the fchool of Dunkeld, for an afliftant, Mr Stone 
was recommended as the beft; qualified for that office; aad 
ibout two or three years after, the Redor being re- 
moved

moved to Perth, Mr Stone, by the favour of his Grace the 
Duke of Atholl, who had conceived a high opinion of his 
abilities, was promoted to the reftorfliip. 

When he firfl went to Dunkeld, he entertained but an un- 
favourable opinion of the Erfe language, which he confider- 
ed as a barbarous gibberifli : But in order to inveftigate the 
origin and defcent of the ancient Scots, he applied to the 
ftudy of their primitive language. Having, with his ufual 
afliduity, endeavoured to matter its grammatical difficulties, 
hefet himfelf to difcover fomething of its true genius and 
' charafter. He colledled a number of ancient poems, the pro- 
dudions of Irifti or Scottifti bards, which, he faid, were da- 
ring, innocent, paflionate and bold. Some of thefe poems 
he tranflated into Englilh verfe; which feveral perfons now 
alive have feen in manufcript, before Mr Macpherfon pub- 
liflied any of his tranflations from Offian, 

He died while he was writing and preparing for the prefe, . 
a Treatife, entitled an " Inquiry into the Original of the 
« Nation and Language of the ancient Scots, withconjeaures 
".about the primitive ftate of the Celtic and other European 
" nations •," an idea' which could not have been conceived by 
an ordinary genius. In this treatife, he proves, by the 
cleareft reafoning, that the Scots drew their original, as well 
as their language,, from the ancient Gauls. Had Mr Stone; 
lived to fini£h this work, which difcovers great ingenuity,, 
immenfe reading, and indefatigable induftry, it would have- 
thrown much light upon the dark and early periods 'of: 
the Scoftifh hiftory, as he opens a new and plain path, for: 
leading us through the unexplored labyrinths of antiquity.. 
But a fever put a period to his life, his labours and his ufe- 
fulnefs, in the jear 1757, being then only in the 30th year: 
of his age. He left, in manufcript, a much efteemed and 

well 



of Scoo?u-e, 



well known allegory, entitled " the Immortality of Au- 
" thors," which has been publiflaed, and often reprinted 
fince his death, and will be a lafting monument of a lively 
fancy, found judgment, and correft tafte. It was no fmall 
ornament of this extraordinary charadler, that he paid a 
pious regard to his aged mother, who furvived him two 
years, and received an annual penfion from the Duchefs p£ 
AthoU, as a teftimony of refped to the memory of her fon. 

Village of Levefi. — The only village in the parifli is Le- 
ven, which belongs to the barony of Durie, and is fituated 
upon the eaft bank of the river, where it runs into the fea. 
It contains 335 families, and 1165 inhabitants. The rents 
of houfes are from 10 s. to L.8 Sterling. There are 6 
trading veflels of from 90 to 140 or 150 tons, belonging to 
this port, employed moftly in the Holland and Eaft fea 
trade. There is no port on the coaft of Fife better calcu- 
lated for the timber and iron trade, having eafy accefs, by 
roads perfectly level, to a populous adjacent country ; and 
the head of the river affording a fafe and commodious har- 
bour. The beach is fandy, and the fhore quite flat. 

Commerce. — There is a fair in the fpring forlintfeed, and 
one every month, from May to Oftober, for white linen. 
There are two inns in the town, and fix fmall beer brewers, 
befides four or five ale and porter houfes, &amp;c. 

Minerals. — There are very extenfive feams of coal in 
the eftate of Durie, which have been wrought for upwards 
of a century. One feam is of an excellent quality, andufed to 
be exported from Leven to Holland, where it met with a 
more ready fale, than moft of the'^other coals carried from

this part of the country. This feam, fo far as it could b&amp; 
drained by the prefent water engine, is now exhaufted'* 
The feams now working are of an inferior quality, but an^ 
fwer for land fale, and furnifli fuel for two or three fait 
pans, which are very produftive. By an additional engine, 
the proprietor will have the command of a large field of the 
principal or better feam.. 

ManufaElures. — The chief manufaflure in the parifli is 
that of brown linen, from 8 d. to 10 d. a yard. A confiderable 
quantity is whitened, andfold at from lo d. to 20 d. andfome 
of a finer textm-e from as. to 4 s. a yard. There "are about 
140 looms in the parilh, moftly employed in that manufac- 
ture. In the near neighbourhood of Lev^n, there is an ex- 
tenfive bleachfield, which may employ about 16 or iS 
hands. The bufinefs is yearly increafing, as the people's 
prejudices againft public bleaching are daily wearing oflF. 
There is alfo a confiderable roperie eftabliflied at Leven, 
and a good number of flioemakers are conftantly employed 
in making flioes for public fale. 

Church. — The church, a neat and modern building, with 
a fpire, was erefted about 1 6' years ago, in the immediate 
neighbourhood of Leven, being more convenient for the 
greater part of the parifli, than the old fituation at Scoonie, 
which is about half a mile diftant. The Manfe has been in- 
habited above 15 years, and is fituated within an hundred 
yards of the church. The right of patronage, which belonged 
formerly to the priory of St Andrew's, is veiled in the 
Crown. The ftipend confifts of 54 r bolls of bear, 4,4

Poor. There are no begging poor in this parilh. About 

«5 or 16 families receive from 6d. to is. of weekly fup- 
vplies, according to their refpeftive circumftances. Three or 
-.four have a fmall monthly allowance, befides occafional cha- 
^lities given to families in diftrefs. The members of the 
kirk-feflion are very careful, in guarding, on the one hand, 
•againft impofitions, and, on the other, that no neceffitous 
perfon be neglefted. The only funds for the fupport of the 
poor, are the weekly colledions at the church doors, amount- 
ing to about L. 26 ; the colleftion at the communion, dif- 
penfed twice a year, L.ii ; feat rents L. 4, and a trifling 
fum arifing from the mort-cloth, amounting all together to 
about L. 45 or L. 46 Sterling per annum. 

General Charaaer.— The people in this parifh are, in ge- 
neral, fober, induftrious, and thriving. If any behaVe in an 
irregular and diforderly manner, they are avoided by their 
neighbours, it being reckoned difcreditable to be feen in 
their company. They are focial in their tempers, liberal in 
flieir fentlments, refpe£tful to their fuperiors, and hofpitable 
to ftrangers; regular in attending upon the public inftitu- 

tions 

* As a tribute to the memory of a worthy -clergyman, it may be proper to 
mention, that Mr Thomas Melvill, the late incumbent, who was fettled in 
1718, being, by years and infirmity, laid afide from duty, was obliged to 
employ an afliftant; and, underftanding that the admiflion of his afliflant to 
be his fucceflbr, would be acceptable to the parifli, he, to make way for his 
fiicceflion, although he had no natural connexion with him, readily and ge- 
■neroufly refigned his charge in 1764, ending his days 3 years after, in a flatc 
«f the moft chearful tranquillity.

tions of religion, and remarkable for external decency in 
the houfe of God. Few people are more compaffionate to 
the indigent, or contribute more liberally to their fupport, 
riot only by their public colleftions, but by private dona- 
tions. Such as feparate from the eftablifhed church, have 
little of that referye or moroferlefs, which is the general 
charadleriflic of feparatifts of almoft all denominations. 
There have been, as in all fociieties, fome idle worthlefs 
perfons among thertl ; but in the memory of man, there has 
not been one convifted of a capital crime. 

ScJjools. — There is one eftablifhed grammar fchool in the 
parifli. The mafler, who is fully qualified for his office, 
teaches Englifti, Latin, Greek, writing, arithmetic, book- 
keeping, the praftical parts of mathematics, and naviga- 
tion. There is a commodious fchool, and fchool-houfe fur- 
niftied by the heritors. The falary is L. 200 Scotch, and, 
with the other emoluments, may amount to L, 40 Sterling 
a year. There are, belides, two or three fmall fchools, in 
which young children are taught to read Englifti, at the ve- 
ry ea!fy rate of i d. per week. 

Antiquities. — The only antiquities this parifli can boafl 
of, are fome ftone coffins, which have been found to the 
6aftward of the river, with human bones, fupi^ofed to have 
been depofited there in the 9th century, when a battle was 
fought upon thefe grounds between the Scots and the Danes. 

Advantages, — It is no fmall advantage to this parifli, par- 
ticularly to the town of Leven, that they have no connexion 
with corporation or borough politics, which, for the raoft 
part, are attended with fuch bad effedls upon the induftry and 
hiorals of the people. The manufadurers have the benefit 



of Scoonie.

of g. ready money market for their cloth, as foon as cut from 
the loom, without travelling 100 yards from their own 
doors. It is alfo a matter of great convenicncy to have a 
Poft-office at Leven, with an arrival every day from Edin- 
burgh, Monday excepted, and a departure every day, ex- 
cept Saturday. The turnpike road, from Kirkcaldy to the 
eaft coaft of Fife, interfefts the parilh in a ftraight line from 
weft to eaft, at the diftance of about half a mile from 
the town of Leven, and the turnpike road from Kirkcaldy 
fO' Cupar, by Cameron bridge, runs diagonally through the 
northern part of the diftri6l. In a lliort tinie, there will be 
an excellent road from the fhore of Leven to Cupar, the 
county town, which is diftant about 10 ftatute miles. The 
principal advantage of the parifta, is, the having abundance 
of coal in the near neighbourhood, the ordinary fuel of the 
pooreft families. Peats are a fort of rarity, of which fome 
families purchafe a fmall qiiantity yearly, for their conve- 
nicncy. To all thefe advantages, it may be added, that eve- 
ry perfon in health, may, with moderate induftry, earn a 
comfortable livelihood. 

Difadvantages. — As Leven is a thoroughfare from the 
weft to the eaft coaft of Fife, the inhabitants are much op- 
preffed with beggars and vagrants. Largely as they contri- 
bute to the fupport of the indigent among themfelves, they 
complain, that they give three or four times more to ftran- 
ger poor. It is an obvious defeft in the police of this coun- 
try, that no efFedtual method is devifed for reftraining va- 
grant beggars, who lay the public under fuch heavy contri- 
butions. It may, perhaps, be faid, that the people are not 
obliged to ferve them : But fuch as are acquainted with the 
ftate of the country, know well, that while thefe vagrants are 
permitted to go about, the people mujl give them fomething. 

It 



Statijlical Account 



It is a confiderable inconvenience to this parifh, that there 
is no bridge upon the Leven, nearer than Cameron, about 
2 miles up the river. But there are two good fords in the 
neighbourhood, always paflable, except i ni h floods, 
or for an hour or two at high water, during fpring tides; 
and near the town, there is alfo a coble or boat for paflen- 
gers. It is likewife a very great inconvenience, not only 
to this parifti, but to travellers in general, that there is 
no bridge over Scoonie river, upon the great turnpike road 
to the eaft coaft. The water is often regorged with fuch 
banks of ice upon each fide, that there is no paffage for car- 
riages, but with manifeft danger. Though in fummer it is al- 
moft dry, yet the water fometimes rifes to fuch a height, as 
not to be fordable with fafety. Some years ago, a farmer and 
his wife attempting to crofs upon horfeback, were carried a 
confiderable way down the ftream 5 the woman not lefs.than 
400 or 500 yards. Had they not been feen, and opportunely 
aflifted by the neighbourhood, both of them muft inevitably 
have perilhed. 

It is to be hoped, for the credit of the gentlemen 
of the diftria, that this inconveniency will foon be re- 
medied. The want of good free-ftone quarries has been 
a great difcouragement to building in this parifli, as ftones 
cannot be got, but with much labour and expence. Never- 
thelcfs the greater part of this parifli have reafon to acknow- 
ledge with gratitude, the goodnefs of a wife and gracious 
Providence, which hath rendered their fituation, upon the 
wfaole, fo eafy ^nd comfortable. ,</p>

INTRODUCTION. 

/^Ities, towns and villages, generally owe their origin 
to fome natural or accidental advantage of fituation. 
The bottom of a bay, the mouth of a river, a fertile plain, 
the proteftion of a fortrefs, or the fanftity of a'place of re- 
ligious worfliipj invite men, even in the rudeft times, to af- 
lemble and fettle together. Where any numbers of man- 
kind meet, it unavoidably happens, that they muft often 
mutually compare, combine, and oppofe their abilities and 
exertions. Human induftry and genius, become, in thefe 
eircumftances, more vigorous and adlive ; and what was, at 
firft, disfigured by the fcattered huts of a few rude and help- 
lels favages, comes, by degrees, to be improved into a fplea- 
did or commodious city. 

Situation 



120 Statijiical Account 



Situation of Dumfr ies. — The town of Dumfries is fitu- 
ated in 55° 8' 30" of northern latitude; and, as nearly as 
has been afcertained, 4° 25' 15" from Greenwich. It ftands 
upon the banks of the river Nith, about 9 miles above 
where the river difcharges itfelf into the Solway frith. It 
is the capital of the ftiire diftinguifhed by its name, and the 
feat of a prefbytery and of a fynod. 

Antient State. — Of the precife period, at which it was 
founded, no record has been preferved. The Selgovae, who 
feem to have been a tribe of the Cumbri, the raoft ancient 
inhabitants of the fouthern parts of Britain, were found by 
the Romans in the trad of country, comprehended .: the 
prefent fhire of Dumfries, and in the S. E. part of the ftewar- 
try of Kirkcudbright. The Roman province of Valentia, 
bounded by the two walls between Solway and Tyne, and 
between Forth and Clyde, extended over Dumfries-fhire 
and Galloway, with the other intermediate counties be- 
tween thofe boundaries. After the Romans had relinquifli- 
ed Britain, a new kingdom, founded by Ida and the Angles, 
in 1547, fpread its authority from North Cumberland, ovei 
the fouthern and weftern parts of Valentia. The Pifts pe- 
netrating to the N. and N. E. difmembered Galloway and 
Dumfries -fliire from the Northumbrian monarchy, and ef- 
tablifhed themfelves in thefe diflrifts, in the end of the 8th 
century. 

But, although the fituation of the town of Dumfries be 
nearly at the moft fouthern part, where the Nith has evei 
been fordable, and confequently at the very place where, it 
is likely, that this river would be paffed moft generally, ir 
travelling between the north of England and the weftern 
parts of Scotland •, yet the authors, who. have commerao 
rated the above particulars, concerning the ancient inhabl 

tanti 



of Dumfries. I2i 

tants of the neighbouring country make no mention of any 
town or village exifling in thofe times, tliat can be thought 
to have been the fame witli Dumfries. Ptolemy, in his geogra- 
phy of Britain, fpeaks of the Novios, by which he is eafily 
difcerned to mean the Nith ; but fays nothing of any town 
feated any where upon the banks of this river. 



Confitution of the Burgh. — Dumfries is, in its municipal 
conftitution, a Itoyal Burgh. The mechanics are divided 
into 7 different incorporations. A deacon from each of thefe 
corporations, with 12 merchant councillors, a treafurer, a 
dean of guild, 3 bailies, and a provoft, making altogether 
25 members, compofe the town-council. The deacons of the 
trades are annuallyTchofen by the freemen of the feveral in- 
corporations. The new council are eletSled by their prede- 
ceflbrs in office. The mode of election is fomewhat particu- 
lar. Previous to the eleftion of magiftrates, the old council 
choofe four merchant counciUofs in addition to the irnumberi 
Thefe, with the ordinary members of .the council, make up 
22, exclufive of the deacons of the trades. At the eledlion, 
although thefe be only 7 deacons of incorporations, the 
trades enjoy, (in confequeilce of a contraft, * entered into ia 
1623, between the merchant councillors, and the reprefen- 
tatives of the trades) j no fewer than ii votes, which are half 
as many as are given by the other members of the council. 
Although the eleftion be annual, the fame perfons areulual- 
3y continued for two years in office. But 4 of thofe wha

have been merchant councillors, muft be every year ex- 
cluded, and 4 new members fucceed in their room. The 
newly elefted office-bearers, therefore, with the 7 deacons 
of the corporations, and the 4 new merchant councillors 
proceed to purge the council, by the exclufion of 4 of the 
old members. 

Armorial Bearing. — The ancient arms of the town are 
faid to have been a cheveron, with 3 fleurs de lis, which 
are ftill to be feen on the front of the prifon/ The ftone 
which bears them may haye been a part of the old prifon, 
which is faid to have been built 350 years ago. But in- 
ftead of thefe arms, St Michael, (who was venerated in Po- 
pilh times as the tutelary faint of Dumfries,) reprefented 
■with wings, a paftoral ftalF in his hand, , and treading a 
ferpent under his feet, has been ufed for thefe many years, 
as the armorial bearing of the burgh. The motto Alorhur7i, 
is now unintelligible ; nor can its etymology ever be cer- 
tainly traced. It is believed to have been a watchword. 
Some think it is a corruption of the French words alors 
BIEN but it is more generally fuppofed to mark the place, 
where the townfmen of Dumfries ufed anciently to aflemble 
in arms, (upon the approach of an enemy fi-orn the borders, 
of England,) by the lide of a rivulet, which ftill retains the 
name of the lower or lorhurn. 

Markets. — The community of this burgh, among their 
other privileges, are empowered to hold 2 weekly markets, 
upon Wednefdayand Friday, and three annual fairs, one on 
Rood day in Oftober, and the other two in the beginning of 
February and July. The fair in July, and the weekly 
market upon Friday have, indeerf, fallen into difufe. 

Brieves, 



of Dumfries. 



123 



Brieves, however, are ftill executed on Friday, as a market 
day. 

Revenue.— Tht revenue of the town may be etllmated at 
L. 1300 Sterling a-year, befides L. 220 annually railed, in 
virtue of an aft of parliament lately obtained, for the better 
regulation of the police in Dunxfries. Tiie latter fund is 
placed under the direaion of a particular council, or com- 
mittee, confifting of 16 members, 8 of whom are chofen from 
the town-council, and as many from among the citizens at 
•large. The provoft prefides at their meetings. 

Streets.— ThQ principal ftreet of Dumfries extends full 
three quarters of a mile, the whole length of the town, in a 
direaion parallel to the Nith. Towards the middle of the 
town, this ftreet may be nearly 100 feet wide. Befides this, 
there are 7 or 8 other ftreetsj and 5 or 6 lanes. The 
breadth of the town is, for two thirds of its length, from 
a quarter to the third part of a mile. The houfes being 
built of brick and redfree-ftone, have alight and airy appear- 
ance. The fituation of the town, rifing gradually from the 
river, is beautiful and advantageous. It is allowed by 
ftrangers to be neat, and well built. It is very well light- 
ed, and the pavements are likely to be, in a fnort time, 
much improved, by the application of the police tax to that 
purpofe. 

Public Buildings. — The town hall forms part of a build- 
ing, erefted about the beginning of this century, and ra- 
ther incommodioufly placed in the middle of the high ftreet. 
Under the hall are the weigh-houfp and town-guard houfe. 
This ftru£lure is alfo adorned with a fteeple and fpire.. 
Nearly adjoining is the prifon. The council chamber, in a 

feparatje

feparate building, is decorated with portraits of King, Wil- 
liam and Queen Mary, and of the late Duke of Queenfber- 
ry ; the latter, a fine painting. A houfe of correftion has 
been lately built. The gentlemen of the county meditate 
the erection of a new prifon. A playhoufe is now build- 
ing. The inhabitants are already accommodated with an 
elecant fuit of affembly rooms. Tiiere are 2 churches for 
tRe reception of the parochial congregations, belonging to 
the Eftablifhed Church ; an Epifcopal chapel, and, a Metho- 
dift, a Relief, and an Antiburgher Meeting-houfe. The 
bridge over the Nith, with occafional repairs and alter- 
ations, has been kept up for thefe 500 years *. It is nar- 
row, and begins to be ruinous ; but the foundation is now 
laid of a new bridge, which will be much more fpacious and 
elegant. The flefli-market is a fquare, fliaded around, with 
proper conveniencies behind for flaughter. The Infirmary 
is a neat building. In a fquare, neai ly in the middle of the 
town, there is ahandfome Doric column, which was eredled 
on a plan of Mr Robert Adams, 10 years ago, by the gen- 
tlemen of the county, to the memory of the late Duke of 
Queeniberry. 

Covimerce. — The induftry of this town is employed 
rather for the immediate accommodation of its own inha- 
bitants, and of thofe of the adjacent coiuitry, than in any 
confiderable manufadure of articles for diftant markets, or 
in any extenfive commercial tranfadtions. Almoft every 
branch of mechanical or commercial induflry is, however, 

pradtifed. 

* The toll paid for cattle, pafling along the bridge, aftoicls the town p.n 
yearly revenue of L. 200 a-year. It is levied at the rate of 3 s. 4 d. a fcorc. 
Half the cattle that pafs are Irifli.

^iracHfed. Leather is made in 2 or 3 tan-works, which feem 
to fucceed pretty well. Some ftockings and hats too, and 
lome fmall quantities of linen, and coarfe woollen cloths 
' Ave been manufaiSured here, with fiifficient advantage. 

iich quantities of flour, meal, and barley are made in the 
I'lills belonging to the town, as to enable the tackfmen to 
pay L. 400 of yearly rent. Thefe mills were lately burnt 
down, and have been rebuilt upon an excellent plan of Mr 
i-.feikle's. A company from Glafgow have of late attempt- 
ed a tambour manufaflure here, the fuccefs of which is gene- 
rally and earneftly wifhed. It may be mentioned too, that 

ere are from 1500 to 2000 dozen of hare Ikins annually 
lold in Dumfries. 

Bnnh. — Branches of three different banks are eftabliflied 
here, in which tranfaitions to a very confiderable amount 
are carried on. 



Trade and Shipping. —The port of Dumfries extends 
from Southwick, in the parilh of Colvend, up the Solway 
frith, to the foot of Sark water. In this whole track of 
coaft, veffels receive and difcharge cargoes no where, except 
in the river Nith, below Dumfries, and at Annan, where 
only a very fmall fhare of bufmefs is done. About 8 or 
10 coafting veffels belong to this town, befldes two or three 
which are employed in the Baltic, and in the wine trade. 
The annual entries and clearances, are, at an averatre for 
^hree years, ending the 5th of January 1789, as ftatedln the 
iljooks of the Cuftom-houfe, as follows : *^

Forty years ago a confiderable tobacco trade was carried 
on from Dumfries. At an average of four years, 1250 
hogfheads were then annually imported. It is alledged, that 
the importation was confiderably greater, and that in confe- 
quence of the deteftion of fome attempts at fmuggling, the 
trade in this article came to be difcouraged. The coafting 
veffels bring in lime, coals, and merchant goods of various 
forts; they export potatoes and grain. 

Upon fair days, and upon the firft Wednefdays aftet 
the terms of Martinmas and Whitfunday, great quantities ot 
horfes and black cattle are fold on the fands of Dumfries. 
Even on feveral of the other market days, cattle are to be 
bought here. Many thoufands are annually fold. 

J«7W, Uc—As Dumfries enjoys the advantage of a very 
confiderable thoroughfare, it has 2 principal inns, a cof- 
fee-houfe, and feveral taverns. But, upon an average, no 
fewer than 75 perfons take out licences for the fale of fpin. 
tuous liquors, and about 20 more may be annually fined for 
felling thefe without licences. The London mail coach 
paffes through Dumfries every day of the week, and a daily 
poft between Edinburgh and Port Patrick. 

Priutmg Office.— A printing-houfe is eftabliflied here, and 
a newfpaper publiflied weekly- Befides circulating public 
news, this paper is now found to be very ufeful, as a vehi- 
cle 



of Dumfries.

ele for advertifements, to facilitate the tranfa£lionsof bufinels 
throughout the country. 

Schools, — The eftablifliments for education in Dumfries 
have long been in conliderable reputation. There are 
fchools for Latin and Greek ; for writing, French and draw- 
ing ; for arithmetic, and the various branches of mathema- 
tics ; for Englifh reading, and for dancing. Thefe are al- 
moft all public eftablilhments, under the protection and pa- 
tronage of the magiftrates, who, on every vacancy, are at 
great pains to fill the fchools with teachers of character and 
ability. There are aifo two or three boarding fchools for 
the education of young ladies. 

Courts, i^c. — As the capital of the county, Dumfries is 
naturally the feat of the Sheriff and of the Commiflarj 
Courts. The Commiffioners of the land tax hold their 
meeting here. It has been already mentioned as the feat 
of a Prelbytery and of a Synod. The Jufticiary Court fits 
here during the fpring and autumn circuits. Aflemblies are 
held at thefe feafons, and never fail to bring together a con- 
fiderable difplay of elegance and beauty. Here, too, the 
Juftices of the Peace for the county hold their quarter fef- 
fions. 

Infirmary. —TX-iQ Dumfries Infirmary is an eftablilli- 
inent, which it in fome meafure owes to the circumflance of 
its being the county town. It was eftabliflied at firlt, and is 
ftiU maintained by fubfcriptions, from the town and county 
of Dumfries, and from Galloway. It was opened in 1777, 
and the patients reforting to it, have, fmce that period, been 
gradually and uniformly increafing. Dr Gilchrift and 
Mr Alexander Copland, furgeon, have attended them, with 



i 2,8 Statijllcal Account 

a degree of generous care, that does honour to the medical 
profeffion ; and the inftitution feems to have hitherto fully 
anfwered the expedlations and benevolent intention of its 
promoters. 

Roads. — The roads paffing through this town and neigh- 
bourhood, are, in general, in very good condition. Toll 
bars have been erefted on thofe leading towards Edin- 
burgh, Annan, and Lochmaben, within 4 or 5 miles of this 
town. The firft of thefe roads was made 20 years ago, 
from a fund raifed by fubfcription, at the head of which 
was- the late Duke of Queenfberry . About the beglnniilg 
of the prefent century, a gentleman from England purcha- 
fed a quantity of tobacco here, and paid down the money for 
it, but went away without diredling whither it fhould be 
fent. Every enquiry after him proved fruitlefs. In con- 
fequence of this, the town at length obtained leave from 
the court of Exchequer to difpofe of this tobacco, and apply 
the price, to the purpofe of making a road, through Locker- 
mofs, towards Annan. The other roads m the parifli have, 
been made, and are kept in repair, by the ftatute laboui 
This was converted into money, in 1777, at the rate of 12 e, 
the hundred merks of valuation from the county heritors, 
and of I s. 6d. from every houfeholder in town, Avho pays 
15 s. of yearly rent. — The advantages arifmg from the im- 
proved ftate of the roads, within thefe 20 or 30 years, have 
no Avhere been more fenfibly felt, than in this parifla and 
neighbourhood. 

Prices of Provijions. — Butcher meat and poultry of 
all kinds, are fold at double their price twenty years ago-. 
The natural progrefs of luxury, the increafing circu- 
lation of paper money, the additional taxes, and, of cwrfe, 

the 



of Dumfries. 



129 



^he raifing of the rents have all concurred to produce this 
gradual rife on the price of provifions. 

A pound of beef, of 16 ounces, is fold from 3d. to 5 d. ; 
mutton 3 d. to 4id. ; veal 3 d. to 4^ d. lamb 3 d. ; pork 3 d. 
to 4 d. ; geefe, each, from i s. 6 d. to 2 s. 6 d. ; ducks, from 
6 d. to 8 d. i a pair of chickens, 7 d. to 8 d. ; a pound of butter, 
34 ounces, 7 d. to 9 d. ; Scotch cheefe, 3 d. The fiars of this 
county are ftruck by the peck. At an average for the fix years 
ending in 1790, from the ftatements in the books of the 
Sheriff clerk, the value of the peck of wheat is 43.; of 
barley 2 s. 9 d. ; of oats 1 s. 10 d. The Dumfries peck of 
oats and harley is accounted better than the Winchefter 
bufliel. The fame meafure of wheat one third lefs. The 
Winchefter bufhel of the beft wheat weighs 60 lb. of 16 
ounces each; barley 5 2 lb, ; and oats 38. The Dumfries 
peck of wheat weighs only 45 lb. 

Prices of Lahojir. — A labourer's wages are I 3. a-day ; for 
a few months in v;inter, he receives 2 d. or 3 d. lefs. Car- 
penters and mafons have from i s. 6 d. to 2 s. ; tailors 6 d. and 
their vidhials. Till within thefe very few years, the wages 
of carpenters, mafons, bricklayers and flaters were 2 d. a- 
day leis than at prefent. This rife has been occalioned, in 
a great meafure, by the building of a number of new houfes 
jn the neighbourhood within thefe few years. 

Fuel. — The fuel ufed is coals from Sanquhar, or by water" 
carriage from Cumberland, and peats from Locher-mofs. 
The coals coft from 7 d. to 9 d. per cwt, and are, after all, 
» cheaper article of fuel than the peats. 

Servant's Wages. — A ploughman's wages are from 7 to 
8 guineas a-year, with his board. Dairy maids have L. 3 
Vol. V, R ox

or L. 4, and maid fervants in town from 50 s. to L. 4. Meu 
fervants in town receive from L. 7 to L. 9. 

Wheel Carriages. — No waggons belong to this town, 
the Carliae waggon, drawn by fix horfes, comes hither once 
a- week and returns. Eight or 10 poft-chaifes are kept at 
the inns for the road. Five families in the parifh keep each 
a four-wheeled chaife ; and four have whiikies. 

Country P^zrj/^.r— -Befides the town, the parifli of Dum- 
fries comprehends a confiderable extent of country. The 
whole length, including the fpace occupied by the town, is 
about fix miles ; the breadth, at an average from 2 to 3. 
The Nith, bounding it on the W. and S. feparates it from 
Holywood, from a fmall part of Terreagles, and from Tro- 
quire. On the N. W. and N. it is bounded by the parilhes 
of Kirkmahoe and Tinwald; on the N. E. by Torthor- 
wald ; and on the E. and S. E, by Moufwald and 
Caerlaverock parifhes. This traft of country may be con- 
fidered as an extenfive vale, fpreading from the N. W. to- 
■wards the Solway frith. A ridge of low hills, indeed, rifes 
at the S. E. end of the town, and runs towards Caerlaverock, 
in a direftion nearly parallel to the river. The hills, in ge- 
neral, which bound this plain, are either cultivated to the 
fummit, or planted with clumps of wood ; and the whole 
fcene is very pidlurefque. 

Soil, Lochermofi.~Th&amp; foil of the N. E. fide of the parifli 
is a reddifli earth, upon a freeltone bottom ; but that on the 
S. W. is, in general, a pretty ftrong clay. Near the confines 
of Torthorwald lies Lochermofs, an extenfive morafs, inter- 
fered by Locher water. The mofe, except where cultiva- 
tion has gained a few fields from it, is one great dead flat, 
fpreading from the head of the parifli, along its N. E. and 

E. 



of Dumfrieso 



131 



E fides, down to the Solway frith, and is at leaft 10 tniles 
long, and from 2 to 3 broad. It feems to have been once 
an inlet from the Solway frith. A ftratun^ of fea fand is 
found at certain depths, pieces of velTels, dug up in various 
parts of it, have been feen by perfons who are ftill alive. A 
kind of a canoe, with an iron anchor or grapple, is faid to 
have been found as far up as Tinwald-houfe. Large pieces 
of the roots and trunks of trees are alfo found in it, betwixt 
the furface and the fand. Indeed, many large trees, chiefly 
fir, have been found in this mofs, and uniformly; laid with 
their tops to the N. E. From thefe circumftances it ftiould 
feem that this track mutt have been once covered with wood. 
Some have thought, that the Nith may have formerly 
empiicd itfelf into the Frith, either in part or entirely by 
this channel. The fummer of the year 1785 being very 
dry, the mofs was, for a great way, dried like a common 
peat •, and having been accidentally kindled, it burnt for a 
great extent, proceeding in a diredtionagainft the wind, till by 
the coming on of heavy rains, it was at length extinguiflied. 

Air and Water.-^ThQ air here is rather moift, but the 
drynefs of the foil, and the high winds, which occafionally 
prevail, obviate, in a great meafure, the ill effefts which 
might Dtherwife be produced by the moift ure of the atmoC- 
phere. There are here and there in this parifti a few fmall 
fprings, and one in particular in the middle of Lochermofs, 
caUed Crichton's well, having a pretty ftrong impregnation 
of fteel. There are 2 or 3 Inconfiderable lakes. The Nith 
is navigable to the town in fpring tides for veffels of 30 
or 40 tons. A canal was once propofed to be drawn through 
Lochermofs, which, befides draining the mofs, might 
have afforded navigation for fmall boats from the head of 
the mofs to Solway frith. The eftimate of the expence, as 

given 



Statijlicat Account 



given by Mr Smeaton in 1754, amounted only to » 1.295*. 

At the foot of the pari/h the Nith is about one third of a 
mile in breadth. The fhore is there flat and fandy, and 
confiderable quantities of fleech are carried from it to be 
ufed as manure. 

Singular Rock. — About a mile eaftward from the town 
h a craig or rock, curioufly hollowed, known by the name 
of the Maiden-bower crag. It is faid to have been famous 
in the times of druidifm ; and may have received its name, 
from being the fcene of fome rites praftifed as a teft of vir- 
ginity. 

FiJJj.- — The river Nith produces falmon, trouts, floun- 
ders, pikes, eels, and a fpecies fome what larger than her- 
rings, called hirlings. The flounders are, however, taken 
rather in the parilh of Caerlaverock, at the mouth of the 
river. From fpring to the middle of fummer, falmon are 
fold in the town, at from 6 d. to 2| d. a-pound ; the flounders 
are fold at from 4d. to 1 d. a-pound. Cod from the Solway 
frith have, for thefe three winters, been fold in Dumfries, fo 
low as at I d. or even a halfpenny a-pound. The improve- 
ment of the adjacent lands, by the quantity of lime employ- 
ed, is faid to have rendered the fifli in the rivers lefs a- 
bundant. The price of falmon is now almofl: double what it 
was 12 years ago. 

^adrupeds. — The breed of horfes has been greatly im- 
proved here within thefe 20 years ; and the black cattle are 
of the well known Galloway kind. There are few llieep, 
' but

but many milk cows. A confiderable number of hogs are 
fed through the parifh. Thefe hogs are killed on the fpot, 
and feat to the borders of England to be cured. In this ar- 
ticle fome perfons in the neighbourhood deal to the extent 
of feveral hundred pounds per annum, 

Agriculture. — The improvements in agriculture have, 
■.vithin thefe 30 years, been very great. Oats were fown 
in 1790 upon 720 acres of land in the parifh, barley upon 
Z40, wheat upon 180 ; and, at leafl, 300 acres were planted 
uith potatoes ; 20 or 30 acres were fown with peas, and 
Q early as many with turnips. Confiderable quantities of 
Hax are raifed in the parifh. Within 8 miles of the town, 
;here are no fewer than 5 or 6 lint mills, which are all well 
employed. To the cultivation of this article, the attention 

f the truftees, &amp;c. has greatly contributed. About a third 
bf the arable land may be referved for paflure. Grafs feeds 
irc carefully fown. Wheat is fown here between the mid- 
"le of September and the middle of November ; oats, from 
he middle of March to the middle of April; barley in A- 
3ril, and in the beginning of May, if the feafon has been fa- 
.'ourable. Wheat and barley are reaped here in Augufl, 

nd oats in September. 

^ /^^oo^.— Several plantations are fcattered through the pa- 
ifh; oak, elm, beecl^ afh, and fir, are the mofl common 
rees. Around the town there are numerous inclofures, fur- 
•ounded with trees, which have a delightful eiFed. 

Rents and Valuatio7uJ~-T\i^ valuation of the lands withia 
the royalty, in the cefk books, is L. 2243 : 9 : 8 Scotch; 
iat of the houfes, L. 12,293 ; the country part of the parifh 
3 valued at 401 7 merks, 6 s. 8 d. Scotch. The falmon fifhing 
nay be valued at L. 100 Sterling a-year. The rents have 

rifeQ 



Si 34 'Statijiical Account 

rifen greatly within thefe 40 or 50 years. The land through 
the country part of this parifh yields from 10 s. to 30 s. an 
acre of yearly rent. The burgh roods, confifting of above 
500 acres, are let at from L. 2 to L. 3 an acre. Befides thefe, 
the land rent of the country part of the parifh is full L. 3000 
Sterling. The whole rental of the town is about L. 6200. 
A houfe of 3 rooms and a kitchen, the apartments 12 feet 
by 14, yields L. 10 or L. 12 a-year. The burgh roods are 
» t»arcelled out among many fmall heritors and feuers. The 
country part of the parifh belongs to 12 on 4 different pro- 
prietors, of whom only 3 are refident. 

Churches, Sif The town of Dumfries, with the traft 
of country' parochiaUy connefted with it, forms only one 
parifh. The whole charge was, for fome time after the Re- 
formation, under the care of one minifter. After feveral 
fucceffions, Dumfries became, in 1658, for the firft time, 
a collegiate charge. Till 1727, both minifters continued to 
officiate in St Michael's church. This had been originally 
a Popifh chapel, in which religious worfhip began to be ce- 
lebrated, foon after the excotnmunication and demolition of 
the friary; and was kept up, with various reparations and! 
additions, till 1745. ^hen it was taken down and rebuilt.. 
In 1727, that which is called the New Church was firft- 
opened. 

The minifter of St Michael's, or the Old Church, enjoys ai 
living, the value of which, including the manfe and glebe,, 
may be computed at L. 200 a-year. The minifter of the 
New Church has neither manfe nor glebe ; his ftipend is 
L. 140. Both are under the patrqnage of the Crown. 
The prefent minifter of the Old Church is Dr Thomas 
Mutter, who is married, and has five daughters. Dr Burn- 
fide, minifter in the New Church, is alfo married, and has 
fix daughters and two fons. 

Poor. 



of Dumfries. 

Poor.-T-There are at leaft 150 poor perfons who receive 
alms from the public funds. From 45 to 50 are fupported 
in a poor's houfe, eftablifhed in the town. Such as chufe to 
go about begging, are fupplied with badges to diftinguifli 
them as the only mendicant poor belonging to the town ; a 
precaution which, however, does not hinder it from being 
infefted with numerous vagrant beggars. The whole funds 
for the maintenance of the poor, whether arifing fiom col- 
leftions or mortifications, amount to nearly L. 400 a-year. 
The infirmary* has already been taken notice of. 

Population. — From the circumftances already mentioned, 
rcfpefting the town and parifli, it will naturally be inferred, 
that the population cannot be inconfiderable. In a fort of 
ronjunft aft of the town and the prelbytery, dated in 1727, 
iie examinable perfons in the town alone, of the age of 10 
years and upwards, are ftated at 2030. Since that period, 
this number has been greatly augmented. In 1755, 
number of fouls, as returned to Dr Webfter, was 4517. 
The prefent population of the town, as appears from an e- 
numeration lately taken, may be fairly eftimated at 5600 
louls. The inhabitants of the country part of the parilh 
are 1400 ; total 7000 fouls; fo that the increafe within thefe 
35 years amounts to 2483 fouls. The number of feparate 
^amdzes m the town, is from 1400 to 1500. The families 
m the country are fomewhat above 300. The numbers of 
the different incorporated trades in the town are refpedive-

The females refiding in town, by an account taken in 1780, 
were, to the males, in the proportion of nearly 3 to 2* 
The latter leave the place in confiderable numbers, in pur- 
fuit of more lucrative employments, than any that are to 
be found in the town or neighbourhood. Within thefe ig 
years, the population has very rapidly increafed. In a di- 
ftridl belonging to the new church, the inhabitants were in 
1780, only 550 j but in 1790, they were found to have in- 
creafed to 750. This is indeed the quarter to which the 
lower clafles chiefly crowd. The natural progrefs of in- 
duftry and population, the advancement of agriculture, and 
the improvement of intercourfe through all the adjacent 
country, the termination of the war in 1783, and the reco- 
very of the town and neighbourhood from the fliock fuffer- 
*d by the failure of the Ayr Bank, are the moft general 
caufes, to which the increafe of numbers, during the late 
years, may, with the greateft probability, be afcribed. 

Climate. — If the extent, population, and manufactures of 
Dumfries be not very confiderable, it is exempted in a 
great meafure, from thofe evils of which, in large cities, a 
high degree of luxury, fedentary labour, and confinement 
in unwholefome air, are produdive. Though not reeular-

ly built, the town is open, and on the whole, well venti- 
lated ; and there is a fufficient defcent to the river from al- 
imoft every quarter. The ground on which it ftands is a 
gravel or fand, and the Nith, with a good current, and of a 
tonliderable widenefs, runs pretty clofe to it. It may be ex- 
pefted therefore, that the town and parifh fhould be, as 
they certainly are, abundantly healthy. From their fa- 
vourable fouthern expofure, and from being defended by 
high lands, or mountains to the north, the town and neigh- 
bouring country partake of that mild temperature of the 
air, and often enjoy thofe mild winters, which in general 
are obfervable from the Solway Frith, all along the coaft 
of Galloway. The ftate of the weather in winter is, fof 
the moft part, very different in this tra£t, from what it is 
in places which lie 40 or 50 miles to the N. and E. of us. 

Difeufes. — Confumptions and rheum atifms are frequcirt 
here, as they are indeed in all variable climates, efpecially 
when due pains are not taken to defend the body, by fuit- 
able clothing, againft the bad effe£ls of fudden changes of the 
.weather. 

The prevalence of the palfy, and of infanity,has, of late^ 
been particularly taken notice of amongft us. Whether or 
not they are really more frequent than .they ^)vere 20 or 3a 
years ago, it would not be eafy to determine. The efta- 
blifhment of the Infirmary of this place, where patients have 
been received for thefe 15 years p aft, has brought within 
our knowledge and obfervation, a eonfiderable number of 
perfons unhappily labouring mider both thefe diforders. A 
good part of them might not have been heard of here, if an 
Infirmary had not been eftablifhed. The debilitating effe£is 
of fome cold and wet feafons, may, perhaps, have contribu- 
ted to the frequency of the palfy. Some old people tell us, 
(and there may be fome truth in the obfervation,) that wc 

have

have not now thofe warm fummers, which they remember 
fifty years ago. 

With refpeft to infanity, that moft deplorable evil, there 
were received at the Infirmary here, in the courfe of the 
lith year from its inftitution, ending April 1788, 13 lu- 
natics. In the 12th and 13th years, there were received 14 
each year; and in the 14th year, ending April 1791, 20. 
Thefe proportions are far greater than they were previous 
to 1788 ; but this muft in a confiderable degree be afcribed, 
to the increafed refort of patients to the Infirmary, in con- 
fequence of what had been experienced, of the beneficial ef- 
fects, of regular treatment and fafe cuftody. The exceflive 
and increafing ufe of fpiritous liquors, amongft the lower 
ranks of people, is juftly to be conlidered as a great caufe of 
this, as well as of other difeafes, to which they are liable. 

The practice of inoculation for the fmall pox became 
frequent here, as foon, or fooner than in many other parts 
of Scotland. It began as early as the year 1733, about fe- 
ven years after its introdudlion into Britain ; and has, in ge- 
neral, been attended with its ordinary good eflPeds. Agues 
were very prevalent here 40 years ago, but now occur but 
rarely amongft us. Since the year 1623, it is not remem- 
bered that Dumfries has fuffered, in any extraordinary degree, 
from any epidemical diftemper. The fmall-pox was indeed 
very fatal in 1734; and the death ofatleaft 100 perfonsby that 
difeafe, in a few months, might contribute towards the encou- 
ragement of inoculation, then beginning to be introduced. 

Many perfons in Dumfries and the neighbourhood have 
attained to the age of 70 and 80 years ; and two or three 
are now living who have paffed their 9cth.

in the Celtic. The name of the town is, by fome, fuppofcd 
acompound of Gothic or Celtic, with a Roman word, 
Drumfriars ; by others, it is confidered as more entirely 
Celtic, Drwnfre/h, a hill or riling ground, clad with furze 
or fcroggy bulhes. It is a curious circumftance, that the 
Saxon names of places in this neighbourhood, feem to be 
confined, in a great meafure, to the eaft lide of Lochermofs. 
This might lead us to think, that the ancient Northumbrian 
monarchy muft have been bounded upon this fide by that 
extenfive morafs ; did not Bede relate fo diftinftly, that it 
comprehended Galloway, and even fome part of Ayr- 
fliire ; and were not various other Saxon, or at leaft 
Gothic names to be met with, in advancing weft ward along 
the coaft of Galloway. 

Eminent Men. — Amongft the eminent men, that have be- 
longed to Dumfries, mzy be mentioned Mr Alexander Cairn- 
crofs. He was minifter here in the laft centqry, in the fliort 
reign of Epifcopacy, and was afterwards tranflated to the 
fee of Brechin, of Glafgow, and of Raphoe in Ireland, 
where he died, and where his memory is ftill refpefted. A 
Mr George Campbell, too, in the laft century, after being 
minifter here, became Profcflbr ef Divinity in the Univer- 
fity of Edinburgh. The late Dr Ebenezer Gilchrift, who 
died in 1774, was a man of confiderable eminence in his 
profeflion, and highly diftinguiihed for general literature. He 
publiftied ^n ejffay on the ufe ofjea voyages in cotifumptive cafes, 
•which was favourably received. The late Commiffary John 
Goldie, who died in i']']6, is allowed to have been one of; 
the moft refpedlable inferior judges in Scotland. The late 
Andrew Croft)ie, Efqj of Holm, advocate, and Dr William 
Wight, late profeflTor of divinity in Glafgow, both natives 
of this place, well deferve to be enumerated among thofe ; 
whofe talents have done honour to their profeflion.

Antiquities. — Of our antiquities, the ancient caftle of the 
Comyns, and that of the Maxwells, more remarkable in 
the courfe of our hiftorjr, have already been mentioned. 
Notice has alfo been taken of the convent of Francifcans 
which flood anciently here. The ftreet in which it flood, is 
ftill called Friar's Vennel. A fmall part of what is thought 
to have been the kitchen or dormitory is ftill to be feen. 
The bridge over the Nith, founded at the fame time, has 
never yet been taken down ; and amidft all the repairs 
which it has lince received, fome confiderable part of the o- 
riginal work muft ftill remain. In the fquare, in which the 
monument to the late Duke of Queenft)erry has fince been 
erefted, there ftood formerly a ftrong building, called the 
New Wark, confifting of feveral ftories, with vaults under 
ground. The date of its ereftion is faid to have been in 
1583 or 1585. There is a tradition, which its centrical fi- 
tuation renders, not improbable, that the inhabitants of the 
town ufed formerly to convey their moft Valuable efFedls hi- 
ther, as to a place of fecurity, when threatened by the bor- 
derers, or alarmed by the feuds between the Johnftones 
and Maxwells. About the time of the Revolution, the 
vaults are faid to have been ufed as a magazine for the mi- 
litary ftores belonging to the town. No veftige of this 
building now remains ; but it is remembered by all the old 
people in town ; and the vaults were found, within thefe 
12 or 15 years, in digging for the foundation of the Duke's 
monument. 

At the entrance into the town from the N. E. are ftill to 
be feen the remains of the foundation of an old chapel, na- 
med the Chryftal, or more properly St Chriftopher's chapel. 
It was built by Bruce, as a place in which mafs might be 
faid for the foul of his father-in-law, Sir Chriftopher Seton, 
who was hanged on this fpot by order of the Englifli mo- 
narch, 



Statijlical Account 



narch, King Edward I. * The walls of this chapel were de- 
molilhed in 1715, and the materials employed in the tern- 
porary works then raifed for defence againft the rebels. 

A field near the Caftle-dykes, formerly mentioned, ftill re- 
tains the name of Kingholm, which may either have been 
impofed upon it by Bruce, after the flaughter of Comyn, or 
may have been gradually formed by corruption from Co- 
myn's holm, a name which it once bore. At the oppofite 
end of the town, and upon the bank of the river, is another 
field ftill called Nunholm, as lying adjacent to the nunnery 
which was once eftablifhed at Lincluden. 

Towards the lower end of this parifli, and correfponding, 
asis thought, to another fimilar one, near the caftle of Caerla- 
verock, and within that parifli, is an eminence, called Tro- 
haughton, which has been noticed by Pennant, as a Roman 
ftation. Hard by this town, is a third eminence, feeming- 
ly of the fame nature, called the Kirkland Moat. Thefe, 
in the time of the border feuds, may have been ftations for 
the communication of intelligence. 

An antique, fuppofed to be a Roman fandal, which was 
found towards the eaft end of this parifli, is now in the pof- 
feflion of Mr Riddel of Glenriddel. In the fame gentleman's 
coUeftion is alfo a fmall gold coin, fcarcely fo broad as a fix- 
pence, but nearly as thick as a half-crown, and bearing the 
infcription Augustus, round the impreflTion of a Roman 
head. It was found, 3 or 4 years ago in the Nith, nearly op- 
pofite to the town mills. In digging for the foundation of a 
hQufe, feveral years fince, near the Duke's monument, there 
was an earthen pot found, which contained a leathern bag 
much decayed, and within it feveral old filver coins, with 
four or five broaches or fihulce^ linked together. Two of 
thefe have appeared, upon comparifon with the plates in

It is worthy of being mentioned, that, behind the New 
Church, and what is ftiil ftiled the Caftle Garden, there is yet 
to be feen the deep tra^l of a road, leading for a fpace of 
300 or 300 yards, down to the Nith. A caufeway had been 
formed acrofs the river here, by which the family at the 
caftle could come and go, between it and their feat at 
Terreggles, without palEng through any part of the town 
OS its fuburbs. 

As to remarkable natural phenomena in this neighbour- 
hood, few permanent curiofities of this fort are to be feen 
here, unlefs the Maiden bower craig, and fome rocks adja- 
cent to it, be confidered as fuch. Thefe rocks prefent bold 
precipices to the N. E. and decline gradually to the S- W. 
in a manner which feems to fuggeft, that they muft have 
been caft into their prefent order and form by fome convul- 
fion of nature. — A ftorm of wind in 1758, unroofed feveral 
houfes here, and apart of St Michael's church. — The meteor 
upon the i8th of Auguft 1783, was diftinftly feen here.— 
That in November 1758, defcribed by Sir John Pringle, 
-in the Tranfaftions of the Royal Society of London, was 
alfo obferved in Dumfries. — A Ihock of an earthquake was 
felt here on the nth of Auguft 1786. 

CharaBer and Manners. — The town of Dumfries fer- 
ving in fome meafure as a capita], not merely to this Ihire, 
but alfo to Galloway, and having fuch eafy and regular 
intercourfe with London, with Edinburgh, and even with 
the capital of Ireland, has thus become remarkable as a pro- 
vincial town for elegance, information, rnd varied amufe- 
ment. The gentry from the neighbouring country, are thence 
often inclined, either to prefer it as a place of refidence, or to 
pay it occafional vifits. Its eftablifliments for education hold

out confiderable inducements to perfons of moderate for- 
tune, who may wifli their children to enjoy the advantages 
of a well-condu£i:ed public education, without being remo- 
ved from under their own immediate infpeftion. The cha- 
rafter of the inhabitants, is allowed to be, in general, very 
refpeftable. They are charitable and benevolent, hofpitable 
to ftrangers, and mix frequently amongft themfelves in do- 
meftic intercourfe. In their difpofition and manners they 
are focial and polite ; and the town, together with the 
neighbourhood a few miles around it, furniihes a fociety, 
amongft whom a perfon of a moderate fortune may fpend 
his days, with as much fatisfa£lion and enjoyment, as, per- 
haps, in any part of thefe kingdoms.

    PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q15059193">MENMUIli</name>. 

(county of FORFAR.) 
By the Rev. Mr JoHN Waugh.</head> 



<p>Origin of the Na?ne. 

IF Men or Mufi in the Celtic, aa has been faid, means a 
mofs or bog, then Menmore will fignify the great mofs, 
tvhich etymology receives confiderable credit from the face 
of the parifla to the fouth, and the remains of marlhy grounds 
in that quarter. 

The name was anciently Menmure and Menmore, the 
laft fyllable of which is well known to be a common 
termination to names of places in this kingdom, fuch as 
Strathniore, the great valley, Kenmore, the great head, and 
Benmore, the great hill. It fhould feem, not only from le- 
gendary report, but from a fine fpring which ftill goes by 
his name, that in the times of Popery, the church here had 
been dedicated to St Aidan, which appellation was alfo 
given fometimes to the parifh itfelf. This holy man was 
Britifti ; his name appears in fome of our kalendars ; he flou- 
rilhed in the 7th century, and is faid to have been Bifliop 
of Lindisfarne before that fee was transferred to Durham. 
Under the aufpices of Ofwald, king of Northumberland, he 
converted his fubjefls to the Chriflian faith. That he was 
in deferved efteem in that country, along with Bede and St 
' Cuthbert, there is no doubt.

Situation, Extent, Surface and Soil. — This parlfli is llttf- 
ated in the Ihire of Forfar, in the prefbytery of Brechin, and 
Synod of Angus and Mearns. It is rather more than 5 
Englilli miles in length, and about 2, at a medium, in 
breadth. The general appearance of the country is flat, e- 
fpecially to the fouth and eaft, except the northern divifion 
of the parifh, which is hilly and covered with heath. The 
reft of the grounds, particularly on the flopes, are very fer- 
tile : The foil feems to be a fandy clay, not very deep, and 
towards the water fide {harper, with lefs loam and more gra- 
vel intermixed. 

Climate and DiJIempers. — The air may be called healthy, 
though, from the vicinity of the hills, it is cold, and very 
often in the fummer evenings after fun-fet, there is a chilly 
breeze from that quarter. In the low lands it is rather mar- 
shy, and the air is moifter, which, with the nature of the 
food, may encourage the fcurvy and King's evil. This 
latter complaint, with the flow inflammatory fever, are the 
prevailing dillempers. The difeafe called Sibbins, and de- 
fcribed fome years ago by Dr Gilchrift, has made its ap- 
pearance once or twice in this parilh ; and this diftemper, 
called, in the account of a neighbouring parilh, the loupin^ 
gout, was firft noticed here. 

Mineral Spring. — On a farm called Bathall there was a 
mineral well, which was in confiderable repute fome years 
ago ; but is now very little re for ted to. It is of the chaly- 
beate kind, and good for ftomachic complaints. But the 
poor people in thofe difeafes, for which Spa waters are re- 
commended, commonly prefer that of Panana or Arbroath. 

Population. — The number of people in this parifli, accor- 
ding to Dr Webfter's ftatement, amounts to 743. By x 
very corredl lift taken laft fpring^ (1791,) there were 900 

fouls, 



of Menmuir. 



Touls, viz. 432 males and 468 females, which makes an in- 
:reafe of 157; although, from examining the regifter of 
baptifms for a confiderable time back, it appears, that the 
population is rather on the decline. The births are, at an, 
annual average, nearly 27, deaths 22, marriages 8. Of the 
two latter no exaft records are kept, and confequently the 
calculations may not be fo perfedlly corred. The number 
of farmers is 36; of manufadlurers, the weavers, who are 
the only people of that defcription that are here, 12. The dif- 
ferent feftaries or diffenters, are about 60, viz. a Roman 
Catholics, who do not properly belong to the parilh, but 
ome from the north ; 10 Seceders, who attend a meeting 
in Brechin j and 48 Epifcopalians. 

Farming and Produce, X^c. — There are 5 5 ploughs in the 
parifh and 100 carts. The old Scots plough is commonly 
ufed. On 2 farms they ftill ufe oxen. In fome places the 
fmall plough is introduced. The parifli fupplies itfelf with 
provifions, excepting butcher meat and fmall groceries, 
which people in a country fituation need from market towns ; 
but in return for thefe they fend in fat cattle, and export 
pretty large quantities of grain, efpecially oats and rough or 
Chefter bear. On fome of the larger farms, where they 
have a greater proportijn of pafture, a good deal of cheefe 
and butter is made and fold at Brechin or Kirrymuir. The 
foil, in feveral places, feems peculiarly favourable for railing 
flax. Four or five perfons have lately obtained premiums 
for this article ; and this fummer, with the affiftance of the 
Board of Truftees, a mill for drefling lint has been ereded 
on the water Cruick, which, it is to be hoped, will meet 
with encouragement. Peas and oats are fown here as foon 
after Candlemas as the weather will permit, though, in fome 
iate feafons, they are hardly finifhed by the middle or even 
the end of April. Flax is fown about the beginning of that 
»onth, and through the whole of it. When it is a dry 

fpring, 



148 



Statijlical Account 



fpring, the farmers wifh to get their bear earlier fown, 
than in more foiithern or in lefs expofed fituations, as the 
cold nights and frofty air of Oftober have frequently injured 
this grain of late years. Barley is little cultivated, though 
rather coming in ; both it and the Cheller bear will fome- 
times anfwer very weU, when the fummer is warm, though 
not fown till near Whitfunday. Turnips begin to be fown 
after that is over, which thrive very well here, feldom mif- 
give, on account of the fly and flugg, as they do in Eng- 
land, and are univerfally fown with the hand or a machine 
in drills, and afterwards cleaned repeatedly with the com- 
mon plough. A good many potatoes, red cabbage, bori- 
cole, and fome yams for horfes, are cultivated with fucce{s 
in the fame way : Thefe are reckoned a profitable crop, be- 
lides preparing the ground for oats. By this intermediate 
produce, and the fucceeding one, with the help of manure, 
being very plentiful, the farmers reckon themfelves greater 
gainers than thofe who raife wheat at the expence of ex- 
haufting their land, and lofing a crop by fallow. 

Difadvantages. — The improvements in agriculture, and 
the parifh in general, lie under certain difadvantages, which 
deferve to be mentioned. There is neither lime nor marl 
in the parifli, and it is a great labour, and occupies a good 
deal of the fummer's work to bring them from pits or hiUs 
at 4, 6, and even at 12 miles diftance. Another hindrance 
to improvement, and a great difadvantage to the parilh, is 
the kind of fuel and the manner of obtaining it. There are 
few peats ; turf is the principal firing. Thefe are none of 
the beft, tedious in calling, winning and leading, in wet fea- 
fons very difficult to dry •, and by the cultivation of wafte 
lands, the whins, divot and uroom, are almoft worn out. 
Thus, the poor houfeholder, after all his fatigue, has fome- 
times nothing but his labour for his pains, and is obliged to 

buy 



of Menmuir, 

buy coals from the ports of Arbroath and Montrofe, the 
firil 15, the other 10 miles from Menmuir. Thefe coals, to 
fiich as have them to purchafe, will come to 12 s. and 13 s. 
the cart-load. If they go to Arbroath, the diftance is very 
great ; if to Montrofe, they are i s. 6 d. or 2 s. the boll dearer, 
from the heavy duty that is exafted whenever fea coal paf- 
fes a little promontory called Redhead. So heavy is this 
burden, that it is found to be more frugal to burn fmall 
coal from Newcaftle, than what comes from the Frith of 
Forth. This grievance, which hurts the poor, and checks 
very much all fpirit of enterprife and manufadlure, might 
be removed by a new tax on fome lefs needful commodity, 
or by an equalization of the duty ; perhaps an additional 
halfpenny levied in general on Fife and Lothian coal might 
anfwer the end. 



Heritors and Rent. — There are 6 heritors, only two of 
whom refidein the parifli. The valued rent is L. 283 : 3 : 11 
Sterling. The real rent is L. 1599 a-year. The average rent 
of farms may be L. 50. The general rent of the beft ara- 
ble land is about 12 s. the acre. The farmers are convinced 
of the advantages of inclofures, although they are as yet but 
rare. In feveral new tacks the tenants have bound them- 
felves to inclofe with dry ftone-dikes, for which they are to 
receive 10 s. a rood at the expiration of their leafe. The 
vifhial raifed annually amounts to 5704 bolls. There are 
ai8 horfes j 1030 black cattle, and 1447 Iheep, 

Wages.-^A flout day-labourer may be hired for 8 d. 
with viduals. In winter wages are lefs. In harveft a 
man's wages are i s. a-day, and a woman's 10 d. Day-la- 
bourers, when induftrious, can bring up their families with- 
out difficulty. The wages of domeftic fervants, at a me- 
dium, are L. 6 for a man, and L. 3 for a woman. The wa-

ges of artifans vary much : Some carpenters will be got for 
8 d. a-day, others can hardly be hired for is. 6d. The 
cafe is fimilar with regard to tailors. Some of them only- 
demand 4d. and others 8 d. a-day, juft as they happen to be 
dextrous at their trade, or much employed. 

Poor. — There are 10 at prefent on the funds. The an.

Church. — ^The church was built in 1767. Theftipend! 
Varies with the price of vidlual. It confifts of 6 chalders, 
viz. 32 bolls of bear and 64 of oats, with L. 25 Sterling, in- 
which it is chiefly paid. Including the glebe, which va 
fcarcely 6 acres, but very good ground, the ecclefiaftical be- 
nefice is, communibus annis, rather above L. 90 a-year. 
The patron is John Erlkine, Efq; of Dun. 

School— Thtvt is but one fchool in this parifti, and thai: 
but ill attended. There are hardly 10 fcholars in fummer, 
and in winter the greateft number never exceed 30. Thcr 
encouragement given to the mafter is extremely poor. A^: 
paltry houfe, about 100 merks of falary, and the emolu--,

Antiquities. — On the top of a hill called Caterthun,: 
there are the remains of a very remarkable fortrefs. It 
confifts of an immenfe quantity of loofe ftones, rangeda 
round the fummit of the mountain in an elliptic form/ 
Whether thefe are the ruins of a ftupenduous wall, or whe- ■ 
ther they were at firft only heaped together, does not cer^ 
tainly appear though, from their prefent ftate, one fliould ; 
iimagine the latter was the cafe. It is fuppofed by anti-H 

quarianS; I 



of Memnuir, 



quarians, that this was a Danifli or a Piftilh camp and what 
puts this hypothefis beyond doubt, is, Jirji, plain indications 
of a fofl'e or ravin all around ; and, idly, on the next hill, a 
fortification of the fame figure, but of lefs note, being com- 
pofed of earth ; whereas, in Caterthun, the great curiofity 
is the vafl: number of ftones. Whether we confider the 
fize of fome of thefe, the whole mafs in cumulo, the height 
to which they have been conveyed, the diftance from which 
'tis likely they were brought, there being no quarry or rock 
in the adjacent moors ; or, in fine, whether the curious reft 
on one, or on all thefe circumftances, this ftrudlure, rude as 
It is, may well excite wonder, and affords much fubjeft for 
refearch. Some travellers, who have narrowly examined 
thefe ftones, tell us, that on fome of them they difcovered 
coarfe outlines of birds, beafts, &amp;c. Within the ring or oval 
circumference, the earth is covered with foft grafs and 
bent ; whereas, without the ing, the heath and mofs is ve- 
ry luxuriant over the hill. The fpace inclofed by the 
ones may be near two acres. Among thefe ftones fome 
iierbs appear, but the Digitalis or foxglove is moft confpicu- 
0113. There are up and down flight eminences, or fmall 
tufty hillocks, underneath fome of which, 'tis not improba- 
ble, lie concealed arms, bones, urns, or fome notitia: of the 
original formation of thefe remarkable ramparts. But 
:here is another objeft vifible at firft glance, which muft be 
mentioned. It cannot be better defcribed than by borrow- 
ing fome of the words of a writer, who obferves, when fpeak- 
ing of the appearances on the top of Craigphadrick, 
' Withm this inner fpace, there are other marks of artificial 
' operation, viz. a portion of ground, feparated from th« reft 
; near the weft fide. This is in the flxape of . parallellosra.:, 
• the dike and ditch of the inclofure eafily to be difcerned. 
^ ^ut what has been the intention of this piece fet apart, 'tis 
difficuh to determine. It might perhaps have marked 
'•he refidence of thofe of high rank, or been a place appro-

• priated to religious ufe.' As Caterthwiy at a little diJ 
ftance, appears to be o£ a conic fhape, and has a rangtf 
of ftones about its fummit like a crater, forae travellers 
imagine it to have been formerly a volcano. This may be 
the cafe with fome other hills in the north of Scotland ; but 
the llrufture in queftion is plainly a work of art, and not of 
nature. There is nothing like lava which might point out 
the operation of internal fire ; nothing like the vitrification 
of thefe Highland caftles formed by artificial fufion, neither 
is there any mark of mafonry ; fo that it muft rank with 
Buneval and Dunjardel in Tnvernefs and Nairnlhire, and o- 
ther fortifications of dry ftone. With regard to the main ob- ■ 
jedt, the time when, and the people by whom this ftrong ; 
hold was firft erefted, hiftory is filent, and confequently re- • 
courfe muft be had to the moft probable conjedure. Little ; 
need be faid on this head after the fuppofitions of Meffrs 
Pinkerton and Pennant, whofe writings with thofe of others 
may eafily be confulted. The laft of thefe authors has gi^ 
ven, in one of his firft tours in Scotland, a view of Cater- 
thun, with its dimenfions. Some people in this country 
would trace the origin of Caterthun no higher than what 
in the Celtic its name implies, ' the Thieves-hill but this 
feems to fix it to an sera much too recent. That the- 
northern freebooters, or Catterin, as they are vulgarly call- 
ed, availed themfelves in their expeditions fouthward, of 
this and other places of ftrength, there is no doubt. On this 
account alfo it might receive its prefent name ; but it has 
been clearly a ftrong camp before the period of their incur- 
fions, probably in the Danifti or Caledonian wars. Some 
fuppofe Tacitus fpeaks of this place in his hiftory, and 'tia ■ 
alfo faid, that in later days the celebrated Marquis of Mon- 
trofe and his army figned the Solemn League and Covenant

on the top of this mountain*. There is a cluftcr of burrows, 
about a mile to the north of the church, which werehelieved, 
by the common people, to be graves of Pidls or Danes kill- 
ed in battle ; but as, upon one of them beiiig opened, bones 
were found very entire, one fliould imagine they belonged 
to a later tranfa£tion. A little rivulet hard by has two 
pafles, called the Scotch and Englifhman's ford, which 
feems to confirm this opinion, and to fix their date about 
the reigns of Charles I. or 11. when there were frequent 
Ikirmifhes in this country between the Prefbyterian and 
Royal forces. There is one burrow detached from the 
reft, which is called Beattie's Cairn, and the place * the 
* Man/worn Rigg,' i. e. the perjured land. There is a tradi- 
tion which agrees with this appellation, and aiFords a ftri- 
king pi6lure of the fpirit of ancient times. Two lairds 
quarrelled about their marches, and witnefles were 
brought to fwear to the old boundaries. One of thefe 
chieftaii^p, provoked to hear his opponent's fervant declare 
on oath, that he then flood on his mafter^s ground, pulled a 
piftol from his belt,, and Ihot him dead on thefpot. It was 
found, that to fave his confcience, be had earth in his 
flioes brought from his laird's land. The perfon who pu- 
nilhed fuch prevarication, in fo fummary a manner, wa§ 
proprietor of Balhall. Before the Carnegies bought the 
principal eftate here, thefe lands were poffeffed by a fami- 
ly named Collace or Coleffy. Their funeral vault is in the 
church yard. One of them diftinguiftied himfelf as fol-

lows in the battle of Brechin. When the Earl of Craw- 
ford fought in this engagement, to revenge Lord Dou- 
glas's murder by James II. there was in his army one 
CoUace of Balnamoon. This man being affronted at not re- 
ceiving a promife of the lands of Fern from Crawford, on 
their eventual viftory, left him, while the combat was yet 
doubtful, and brought over to Huntly and the loyalifls 
thebeft part of his commander's forces, confifting of battle-ax, 
long fpear, and broad fword men. This turned the for- 
tune of the day, and forms a very important fa£l in the 
hiftory of that time, as feveral writers acknowledge it was 
a moil critical event to James, and eftabliftied the Crown, 
which, till that decifive engagement, had only tottered on 
his head. 

Mifcellatteous Obfervations. — The inhabitants of this pa- 
rifh are difpofed to induftry and economy. The women, 
in particular, fpin a great deal of lint into coarfe yarn for 
the duck or fail-cloth fadtory. They fpin with both 
hands, a pradice little known in the fouth of Scotland, 
which enables them to earn 3 s. a-week. This makes it 
fometimes difficult to get domeftic fervants, feeing they 
can make their bread eafily at home. There are three 
perfons in this place who take in the flax undrelTed j one of 
thefe keeps conftantly two hecklers employed, to prepare 
the lint for fpinning ; which, on being returned in yarn, is 
carried to Montrofe, as the few manufa£birers who refidc 
here 'are principally employed in making coarfe plaidingg 
and linen of a finer quality for home confumption. The 
roads are itpproving. They are ftill made and repaired by 
the ftatute labour, which is not commuted. There are no 
tolls, and the general idea is that they would be oppreffive. 
There are a bridges over the water called Cruick, on the 
great road to Brechin. One pf thefe was built 3 years ago,

for which purpofe L. 30 was obtained from the county, and 
L. 40 raifed by fubfcription. There are 5 corn mills on 
Cruick water, and a fulling mill on a fmall rivulet to the 
north. At one of thefe mills about 400 bolls of pot -bar- 
ley are annually made for the London market. There is 
only I licenfed ale-houfe in the parifti, and it is rather a 
convenience than a nuifance. Cottagers are here almoft u- 
niverfally employed in labour. Several farmers think that 
they are both cheaper and more Heady labourers than birwl 
fervants. Many of the cottagers live very comfortably.

(county of KINROSS,) 

By the Rev. Mr Andrew Grant.</head> 


<p>
Namcj Situation^ Extent, Surface^ and Soil. 

THE name of this parifh is derived from St Moak^ 
in honour of whom a priory was erefted on the 
banks of Lochleven. Port was prefixed to it, from its being 
the neareft land to the ifle of Servanus, and confequently 
the ufual landing place from the priory of Lochleven, 
which was fituated in that ifland.. It is in the prefbytery 
of Kirkaldy, and Synod of Fife^ It is of a very irregular 
figure ; the length, at one place, is 7 miles, and the breadth 
5, and contains in all about 6404 acres Scotch meafure. 
Ofthefe 4054 are arable, 300 mofs, 300 meadow, 1400 
hill, and 350 muir. The furface prefents a great variety of 
obje£ls to the eye, a mixture of fertile fields, barren mofs, 
rich meadows, craggy mountains, and/thriving plantadons, 
lying around a beautiful and extenfive lake. In fuch an ir- 
regular furface, the foil muft be various. There is a trafl: 
of arable ground, which is very fertile, having the loch and 
the river of Leven to the fouth, and being flieltered from 
the north by the Lomonds ; its length is about five miles, 

and 



of Portmoak, 



157 



md its average breadth one. It is a fandj warm foil, pro- 
ducing, even in its prcfent ftate, rich and early crops. There 
is no ground in this county, capable of making more quick 
and ample returns for the labour bellowed upon it ; and 
yet, with all thefe advantages, it is far from being well 
cultivated. That part of the arable ground, which lies 
fouth of the Leven, is fomewhat later, and in its prefent 
Itate lefs fertile, but it is alfo very valuable and capable of 
much improvement. The greater part of the mofs is co- 
vered with heath, and could not be cultivated without 
much labour and expence. It appears to have been once 
covered with wood, as the roots of large oak trees are fre- 
quently found in it, ftill fixed where they firfl; grew. Va- 
leriana Sylveftris, an herb well known to the apothecary, is 

, found here in great abundance. The meadow ground pro- 
duces plenty of coarfe hay, fit only for black cattle. The 
hill grounds of the fouth-weft Lomond, and part of Ben- 
artic, having no heath, are green to the top, and afford ex- 
cellent pafture for flieep. At the bottom of the fouth 
Lomond or Biftiop's hill, there is a number of copious 

i fprings of excellent water. One of thefe is fo remarkable, 
that the hofpital of Lochleven, which flood near it, was call- 
ed Fons Scotice, now Scotland Well. The height of this 
branch of the Lomonds has never been mcafured. 

Lake, IJlands, River, Wf.— -Lochleven, which is half fur- 
tounded by this parifli, is a fpacious and beautiful lake. 
It is about 15 miles in circumference, and interfperfed 
Swth iftands of various appearance and extent. One o£ 
thefe contains about 48 Englifh acres of good pafture. In 
this, which is called St Serfs ille, was fituated the ancient 
priory of Lochleven. About 2 miles N. W. of this, there 
fe' a fmall ifland, almoft covered with the ruins of a caftle, 
•once belonging to theDouglaffes of Lochleven, and former-

Mary Queen of Seots was kept a clofe prifoner, and fuf-

Lochleven is not merely an ornament to the country. It 
is a fource of very confiderable emolument to the pro- 
prietors. It abounds with fifli of various kinds. The 
Lochleven trouts are well known in the Edinburgh mar- 
ket. The diiferent kinds of them, the feafon when they 
are in greateft perfeftion, with their fize and prices, will 
naturally find a place in the account of Kinrofs. They 
are all landed there and fold to the inhabitants, or fent to 
Edinburgh. The wild fowb, that frequent this lake, are 
the heron, fcart, bittern, fnipe, teal, water rail, king's fiflier, 
coot, fwan, gulls, wild geefe and wild ducks. The river 
I^even, the moft confiderable in Fife, takes its rife from 
this lake, and runs for two miles through the parilh. The

gxound through which it pafles is rich meadow, but fo le- 
vel, and the windings of the river fo many, that great part 
of it is laid under water during the winter. It abounds 
with very large trouts, which are fometimes found alfo in 
the lake •, but thofe of them that are caught in the river are 
larger, many weighing 5 pounds, and fome of them much 
more. It abounds alfo with pike. But the moft remark- 
able fifhing in this river is that of eels. In the month of 
September they begin to go down from the loch in great 
aumbers to the fea, but only during the night. When this 
feafon arrives, the fifhers place their nets in the river, which 
they draw every two hours during the night, and frequent- 
ly find them full. As the bulk of the people have an a-, 
verfion to them as food, from their ferpentine appearance, 
this fifliing turns to little account in the view of profit. 

Climate, Difenfes. — Perhaps it cannot be faid, that there 
is any thing peculiar to the climate of this parifh. It is, 
in fome degree, flieltered from the cold eafterly winds, 
■which, in the fpring, are feverely felt upon the fouth and 
eaft coafts of Fife. But it lies expofed to the north-weft 
wind, which, blowing acrofs the Ochil hills covered with 
fnow, and along the furface of the lake, becomes intenfely 
cold. On the whole, however, it may be fafely afferted, 
that the air is falubrious, the people vigorous, and fubjeft 
^0 few diftempers. Inoculation for the fmall-pox being un- 
known here, that diftemper is fatal to children. To inocu- 
2 is here regarded as criminal. It is hoped, howevtr, 
that thefe prejudices will foon difappear, and fufFer a prac- 
tice to be introduced, which has been attended with the 
happieft effeas in other places. There are at this time 50 
people living in the parifh, upwards of 70 years of age. Of 
thefe, 19 are 75 ; 9 are 80 ; 2, 90 ; and i, 97. The father of 
jthis laft one died at the advanced age of 106. 

State 



i6o Statijiical Account \ 

State of Property, — There are 2 greater and about 50 ( 
fmaller proprietors. Of the greater only one refides in the 
parifh. The reft are moftly feuers upon the eftates of Kin- 
rofs and Arnot. Thefe almoft all reiide upon, and farm their 
own property. The extent of thefe feus is from 100 to 400 
acres. The valued rent of the parifli amounts to L. 4515, ; 
6 s. 8 d. Scotch. The real rent of land around the two vil- 
lages is about L. I, lo s. per acre.— About 900 acres of the 
parifh are inclofed. The only fence known here is a 
coarfe, but cheap one, the Galloway dike. The lands fo 
inclofed, let from year to year, at higher rents for pafture, 
than, upon a leafe of 19 years, for tillage. The demand 
for fuch inclofures continues to increafe, which begins to 
diminifli the number of farmers in this diftrift. 

Cultivation and Produce. — There are about 50 ploughs li 
in the parifli. Of thefe, 4 are of the Englifh, and the reft : ' 
of the old Scotch make. Some of them are drawn by a [ 
horfes and 4 oxen, fome by 2 of each, and a few by z 
horfes only. The foil being light, eafily wrought, and the 
* greater part of it without ftones, the fmall Englifli plough . 
would anfwer beft. The bufinefs of farming is not fully 
underftood in this diftrift. Turnip and grafs feeds, two of : 
the greateft improvements in agriculture, are only begin- • 
ning to find their way into the parilh. This is the more : 
furprifing, as the foil is uncommonly well adapted to both. . 
There is fcarce a farm in this parifh, and few in this part : I 
of the country, properly divided, and fubjefted to a regu- • j 
iar rotation of crops. The old divifions of outfield and in- • jl 
field, and the old mode of managing them ftill prevail. . jl 
The infield receives all the manure which is produced du- - [ 
ring the winter, and is cropped without interruption..! 
From the outfield, after being dunged by feeding the cattle 
»pon it, the farmer takes four fucceffive crops of oats, and'-

then, without fowirig grsfs feeds, trufls to the fpontaneoua 
prbdu^Hon of nature, for pafture the enfuing feafon. The 
farmers, ho\vever, are beginning to lay afide bid prejudi- 
ces, and to adopt imprbvements, which, in other places, 
have long been the fource of opulence and plenty. The 
ufual crops are wheat, barley, oats, peas and flax. Till 
very lately, little br no wheat was raifed in the parifli j 
but, at prefent,- it does more than fu'pply itfelf with that 
article. Peas ate reckoned aln uncertain and unprofitable 
crop. This is fiot owing either to the foil or climate, but 
to mifmainagement. Flai is raifed for ptivate ufe only. 
But oats, oat-meal and barley are exported in cofifiderabl6 
c^uantities *, 

Cattle. — There are aboiit 240 h'orfes in the parifh. Some 
of them are very good draught hoffes, but many bf them 
Vol. V. X are 

* wheat is fown from the begmnin'f of Odloljer to the middle of No- 
•ember ; oats, peafe and flax, from the beginning of March to the middle 
of April ; and barley from that to the 2oth of May. Harveft begins a- 
bout the middle of Auguft, and is generally ffniflied by the end of Sep- 
tember. Fefore the fubjeft of agriculture is difmiflcd, it is proper to take 
notice of a difcouragement to it, arifing from the lands of one proprietor 
being thirled to the mHl of another. At the time this cuftom took place, 
the confequences of it could not be forefeen, and therefore the rigorous 
■:nterpretat'ioh of it feems to be improper. When the farmer raifed little 
grain, except what he made into deal, fo ferve his own family, or to dif- 
i)afe of among his neighbours, it was no great hardfhip to be obliged to 
manufaaure it at one mill in preference to another. This wis the ftate 
of the country when thirlage bonds were given. But in the prefent ftate 
if things, when the farmer fells great quantities of grain to the corn-mer- 
irhant, for exportation, or to the brewer, to be made into malt, to make 
him pay multure fof this pirt of the produce of his land, t6 a" mill from 
which he receives bo advantage, is furely a grievance which ought to be 
redreffed ; and as no multure for the grain fold to the brewer or corn- 
merchant was demahde'd for many years after thirlage bonds w-re in 
tife, it is evident, (notwithftanding the prefent interpretation of rhem, 
that It was not in the view of the contraaing parties, when firft granted.

are of a fmall fize, and ill kept. At an average, they may 
fell at from L. 9 to L. 10 each. A few may be worth 
L. 20 a-piece. Fife and Kinrofsfliire have always been 
more remarkable for their breed of black cattle than horfes. 
This parilh ufually maintains 1290 black cattle. Thefc 
are very different in fize and value, according to the nature 
of the farms on which they are reared. Stots of 3 or 4 
years old, fell, at an average, for L. 8, and cows for L. 6. 
But on feveral farms they are much more valuable ; feme 
of them, when fit for the butcher, weighing 50 or 60 ftone. 
— The flock of flieep upon the Lomond hills is, of late, 
much diminiihed. The number at prefent in the parifh is | 
1384. They are moftly of the white faced kind, which, | 
by experience, are found to thrive beft on this pafture. j 
They are very hardy, but of a fmall fize, being fold for a- j 
bout 9 s. a-piece. The wool which they produce is not 
fine. From 8 to 10 fleeces go to a ftone, which ufually 
fells at 15 s. By a little attention, the value both of the 
carcafe and the fleece might be improved. 

Prices of Provijions and Labour. — A boll of oat-meal 
fells (January 1792) at 15 s. 4 d. a boll of wheat at 19 s. ; 
barlev at 16 s.; oats at 12 s. A boll of wheat, barley and 
oats, Linlithgow meafure, is about i s. 6 d. or 2 s. cheaper 
than upon the coafts of Lothian and Fife, owing chiefly to j 
the diftance of the markets, and the badnefs of the roads, j 
Beef, veal, mutton, pork and lamb, are generally bought 
below 4 d. per pound of 177 ounces. A fowl fells from 
10 d. to IS.; a duck at 6 d.; eggs at 3 d. /)(?r dozen ; but- 
ter at 7 d. or 8 d. per pound ; and cheefe, according to its- 
quality and age. The rife, which has taken place in the 
prices of thefe articles, is very great. About 60 years ago,

• A charter granted to one of the proprietors of this parifli, about aoa 
years ago, contains a curious proof, how much the value of money has 
diminiflied, and the price of provifions increafed fince that time. His 
lands are held of the Crown, for payment of a feu-duty of a certain num- 
ber of bolls of grain, and other articles, to be paid either in kind, or at 
the following converfion : ' For ilka boll, half a merk Scots, and for ilka 
hen, fix pennies.' 

■f The expence of employing married or unmarried men in hufbandry, 
is nearly equal. The following is the account of the earnings and ex-

eighty-five married men, widowers included, have 525 chil- 
dren alive, which is nearly 3 to each marriage. Since 1783 
there is an increafe in the number of weavers, of 19 ; and 
of population upon the whole, of 65. The increafe fince 
1755 is lap. — The regifter of baptifms for 10 years, from 
1735 to 1745, contains the names of 133 males, and 120 
females, in all 253; fo that the average number of chriften- 
ings was 25^^ per year. The fame regifter from 1 781 to 
1 79 1, contains 131 males, and 114 females, in all 245 ; fa. 
that the average number of baptifms, for the laft 10 years, 
is 24^^ per year. The average number of marriages recorded 
for the laft 5 years, is 6| per year. From the above regifter 
of baptifms and marriages, no certain conclufion can be 
drawn with regard to the population, at leaft during the 
laft period, on account of irregular marriages, and fome of 
the children of the Seceffion not being regiftered. In the 
above divifion of the people into profeffions, there are 2 
parchment makers. This branch of bufinefs has been efta- 
blifhed in Kinneffwood above 150 years. Great quantities 
of this manufaflure are fent to Edinburgh and Glafgow. 
The continued encouragement they have received from the 
public, is the beft evidence that the manufadlurers are fkil- 
ful in their bufmefs.— There are 2 villages in this pari/h, 
one of which contains 293 fouls, and the other 169. The 
inhabitants of thefe are moftly tradefmen and manufac- 
.turers, many of whom are alfo proprietors of houfes and 
land. ^ In thefe villages there are 5 ale-houfes, where great 
quantities of fpirits are fold ; but as yet their bad effedls on 
the morals of the people have not been very extenfive. 

General CharaBer.^Tht feceffion from the Eftablifhed 
Church had a confiderable efFeft, for fome time, upon the

kept them at a diftance from each other, but was frequent- 
ly the occafion of injuries and abufe. The virulent con- 
troverfial writings of the day contributed, not a little, to 
keep alive this intolerant fpirit. This violence has now 
difappeared, and people of different perfuafions live toge- 
ther in the utmofl; harmony and peace. They are uncom- 
monly regular in the dilcharge of religious duties, and,  J ih 
a few exceptions, are induftrious, fobcr, and peaceable. Du- 
ring the refidence of the prefent incumbent, the e is no in- 
ftance of any one being puniftied, either by fine, banifh- 
ment, or death. In a colledlion, made fome years ago for 
the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, and in one lately, for 
a poor widow in the pariih, the charity and humanity of 
the parilhioners appeared confpicuous. 

Minerals. the Bilhop's-hill, there are inexhauftible 
quarries of limeftone. The vein, which has been worked 
for fome time palt, is 12 feet thick, lying under a roof of 
mofs, ochre and calm, 1 2 feet deep. Upon trial, it has 
been found to be as good as any in Fife, if not the beft. 
ASout 340 chalders are annually fold at L. i : i : 4 per 
chalder. This is fumilhed by farmers and others, who, 
during part of the fummer, quarry and burn limeftone to 
anfwer the demand of the country. Thefe men cannot be 
fiippofed to do as much work as the fame number of hands 
would do, if, by a proper divifion of labour, and under the 
diredlion of oneperfon, they were confined, each to that part 
of the work to which he was bred and accuftomed. Thus 
the price is high, and exportation checked. Whei-eas, if it 
were furnifl^ed in the way above mentioned, the emolu- 
ments of the proprietors would be increafed by exporta- 
tion; thofe farmers in the neighbourhood, who have not lei- 
fure to burn it for themfelves, could buy it at a reafonable 
price, and their induftry would be confined to their own 

farms,

farms, where, if properly directed, it will ever be moft pro- 
duftive. There is abundance of freeftone and muirftons 
alfo, in feveral places of the parifh. 

Commerce, Roads, tiff. — Portmoak inaports ale, fpirits, 
coals, yarn, calf and Iheep Ikins. It exports oats, oat-meal, 
barley, black cattle, butter, cheefe, poultry, lime-ftiells, 
green linen, checks, vellum and parchment. The raw ma- 
terials, wrought up annually by the weavers in this parifh, 
receive an additional value, from their art, of about L. 900. 
The limeftone fold produces upwards of L. 350. — The only 
bridge in the parifli is that acrofs the Leven, which was 
built about 100 years ago. — The roads, which are in very 
bad order, were originally made, and are ftill repaired by 
the ftatute labour, which is now commuted. 

Church and School. — The church was built in 1659, till 
which period, part of the old priory ferved for a place of 
worlhip. It was repaired about 5 years ago, and is tole- 
rably decent. The manfe was built about 50 years ago, 
and is in very good order. The ftipend is L. 50, and 4 
chalders of grain ; of which 26 bolls are meal, 22 barley, 
and 16 oats, vpith 50 merks for communion-elements. 
The glebe contains about 13 acres, one half of which is 
good foil, and the other very bad. The patron is George 
Graham, Efq-, of Kinrofs. — The parochial fchoolmafter's fa- 
lary, (which is 100 merks), together with his fchool-fees 
and other perquifites, may amount to about L. 22 ; a re- 
ward by no means adequate to the abilities and application 
necelTary to difcharge, with fuccefs, the duties of ib impor- 
tant an office. There were lately built a good fchool and 
fchool-houfe,. The number of fcholars who attend the 
v/hole year may be about 60,

Statijlical Account 



Po6r.-«-There are no begging poor in this parifh. For 
fotne years paft, lo has been the average number upon the 
poor's roll. The monthly allowance given publickly in the 
church, to each of thefe, is from 2 s. to 4 s. Befides thefe, 
fome have their houfe rents paid, fome receive money, 
once a-year, to buy lint or liritfeed, and others are aflifted 
in educating their children. By thefe annual donations, 
many poor people are encouraged to fupport themfelves, 
without coming upon the monthly roll. It ha? never been 
found that thefe annual gifts were ill bellowed. They are 
received with thankfulnefs, and prove a motive to induftry, 
by keeping alive the hope of independence. Thefe month- 
ly and occalional diftributions, amount annually, for 9 years 
paft, to the fum of L. 24 : 13 : i\. This arifes from the in- 
tereft of upwards of L. 300, and the weekly coUedtions at 
the church doors *. 

Eminent 

* Perhaps there never was a fund managed with (Iriifler economy, Cl- 
one that anfwered better the purpofes for which it was deftined, than 
that under the care of the Kirk-feffions in Scotland. No clafs of men 
could be fitter for diftribiuing the public charity, than the elders in coun- 
try pariflies. Their acquaintance with the circumftances of the people, 
prevents all impofition ; the laudable vanity, they ufually have ia better- 
ing their funds, leads to economy ; and their time and labour are bellowed 
cheerfully, and without reward. This is the reafon, why few or none of 
the pariflies in this country have had recourfe to the legal method of fup- 
porting the poor, by jffeffing the heritors. Of all the methods of fupply- 
ing the poor hitherto devifed, I believe that is the worft. Whilft it is a 
heavy and increafing burden upon the landed intereft, it ruins the charity 
of the middling clafs of people, and encourages idlenefs and diffipation 
among the poor. As foon as the middling ranks of the peojile (who, to 
tieir honoui^ hear almuft ail the burden of fupporting the poor,) find, 
that there is a legal provifion for them, they withhold their contributions 
as unneceflary, and the poor themfelves, having a legal claim to fupport, 
are tempted to layafidc their Induftry, and economy : Add to thefe the hard- 
fliips they muft fubmit to, and the leftraints impofed upon them, in rerac- 
ving with their families from one place to another. That thofc who poflefs the

Eminent Men. — Under this article may be mentioned 
Andrew Wintan, who was prior of Lochleven in the reign 
•of James I. He wrote what is called the Lochleven Chro7iicle, 
or, ' hijlory of the world, from its creation to the capti^ 
' vity of 'James I. in Scotch metre.' There is a copy of it 
flill in the Advocate's "^library, which is frequently appeal-

wealth of a fociety, are bound to fupport its poor, there is no doubt ; but to 
.proportion this burden to the ability of individuals, and without encou^ 
raging indolence, to aflign the neceflaries of life to thofe who are unable 
to earn them, fcems to be extremely difficult. All the methods which 
law hath eftablifhed for this purpofe, are liable to great abufes. There it 
one, which, though it never had the countenance of law, has produced 
good effedls. Many incorporations in to,wns, and feme diftricls of the 
country alfo, have raifed funds for the fupport of thsir poor, by fubfcrip- 
tion. Each fubfcriber, by contributing a fmall fum annually, while in 
health and flrength, is entitled, when deprived of thefe, to a weekly or 
monthly allowance. Thefe funds have been the means of preventing re- 
gular afleflments upon the heritors in many parifbes. To e.xtend them 
-to the whole country, would perhaps be the beft method of providing for 
the poor. A law.eftablifhing one or more funds of this kind in every 
parifli, and obliging every perfon, of whatever ftation, to become a fubfcri- 
ber at a certain age, would raife a fum equal to all the wants of the poor. 
In moftof the parifhes in this neighbourhood, an affeirraentof x s. upon each 
perfon above 2o years of ag«, together with the produce of their prcfent 
funds,- would raife a fum equal to their prefent diftributions. This burden 
could not be much felt by any clafs of men. It would be lighter ftili, if 
"proportioned to the circumftances of the contributors ; fuch as 6 d. from 
fervants and day-labourers annually, i s. from manufaiflurers, 2 s. fvom 
farmers, and more from proprietors, of a certain extent, or fome fuch pro- 
portion. In fome pariOies, where there are large or populous towns, the 
afTeffment mufl be higher. But from the number of poor, and the fums 
diftributed to them, mentioned in this work, an exaft eftimate of the 
^ura wanted in each parifli, could eafily be calculated. The advantage 
of fuch a fcheme to the landed intereft is evident. Their fubfcriptions 
would amount to an inconfidcrable fum, compared to that which they 
muft contribute, if the poor are to be fupported by affefTments ; a plan 
which is already adopted in the fouth of Scotland, and is likely to be 
•«xtejided over the whole country. With regard to the lower clafles

ed to by later hiflorians. — John Douglas, of the family of 
Pittendriech, was a man of leajrning. He was Provoft of the 
new College of St Andrew's, and afterwards Redtor of the 
Univerfity of that place. In the year 1571, he was ap- 
pointed Archbifhop of St Andrew's, and was the lirft Fro- 
teftant who enjoyed that See. — Mr John Mair, late Re£lor 
of the Academy at Perth, received his education in this 
parifti. His numerous produftions, to facilitate the educa- 
tion of youth, are well known in all the fchools. — Michael 
Bruce muft not be omitted under this head. He was born 
in Eanneffwood, and very early difcovered marks of ge- 
nius. His parents, though in indigent circumftances, fent 
him to the Univerfity, where he made great progrefs in fe- 
veral branches of literature. After his death, v/hich was 

about 

the people, fuch a law would be reafonable; for if tradefmen, day-labourers, 
and fervants, while healthy and in employment, can, by their earnings, 
enjoy the comforts of their Itatlon in a reafonable degree, and, at the 
fame time, fpare a little to aflift themfelves in ficknefs and old age, it 
feems equitable to make them contribute to fuch a fund. It is only ob- 
liging them to referve a part of what they can fpare, far a feafon in which 
it will be needed, while it gives fociety a fecurity, that they will not 
become a burden upon it. Befides, the fum propofed is not more than 
they ufuaily contribute at the church-doors. Such a law indeed would 
bear hard upon fuch as can, with difficulty, fupport themfelves and 
their families. But the law obliging to fubfcribe, might not only 
admit of different rates of contribution, proportioned to the circumftan- 
ces of the contributor, but of feme exemptions altogether. The allow- 
ance to which opulent fubfirribers would be entitled, in cafe of ficknefs 
or old age, which it is not to be I'uppofed they would accept of, would 
go to increafc the fund, and to afford foraething to thofe whofe 
circumftances did not permit them to fubfcribe at all. By this plan, the 
poor would be relieved from the bsrdfliips and reftraints impofed upon 
them, in removing from one place to another, and gaining fettlements. 
They would be at liberty to fettle undifturbed, where wages were 
higheft, and the neceflaries of life moft plentiful, fecure, that when they 
needed fupport, they would find it in that fund, to the formation of which 
jthey had contributed.

ftances, and without his corredions, they difcover ftrong 
marks of poetical merit. In the immediate view of death, 
fays Logan, the editor of his works, he wrote the Elegy to

which is wrought up into the moft paffionate ftrains of the 
true pathetic, and is not perhaps inferior to any poetry in 
any language. 

Antiquities. ~V\\t moiiaftery of Portmoak ftood on the 
eaft bank of Lochleven, a little north of the river which 
rifes out of that lake. It was founded by Rogafch, king of 
the Pifts, derived its narpe from St Moak, and was confe- 
crated to the Holy Virgin. It originally belonged to a fort 
of Mon'l., called by the Scots and Britons Culdees, Whdfe 
convents originally eledled the bifliops in the feveral places 
where billiops were eftablifhed. It had confiderable pof- 
feffions. Kirknefs was given to it in the reign of David 1. 
by Mackbeth, fon of Finlach, aifid was afterwards tbe refi- 
dence of the prior. It was united to St Leonard's Colleg^, 
by John Winram, prior of Portmoak, and fiibprior of St 
Andrew's, the 5th of Oftober 1570. The monaftery is fo 
entirely demoliifhed, that only as much of one corner of it 
remains, as to fhew the place where it ftood. — ^The priory 
of Lochleven, dedicated to St Serf, or Servanus, was fitua- 
t'ed in an ifland in Lochleven. It wa5 faid to have beeii 
founded by Brudus, the laft except one of the Piftifli kings, 
who gave the ifland to the Monks or Culdees of Servanus,

the court and clergy, he was fent prifoner to the caftle of

§ Among the antiquities of this place might be mentioned a bank or 
mound of ftones and turf, raifed by the Englifti army acrofs the Leven, 
where it iflues from the lake. This was in 1335, during the feeble reign 
of David II. when Edward III. of England had feized the greater part 
of the country. It was made with a view to raife the water of the lake 
over the ifland on which the caftle ftands, into which many of the Scots, 
had retired. Fart of the garrifon under Sir Allan Wypont, in abfencc of 
John Striveling the Englifli general, made a breach in this mound, through 
which the water rulhed with fuch violence, as to carry along with it a 
namber of the enemy, with their horfes, tents, &amp;c. into the fea. Thofe 
with were out of the reach of the torrent, fled and left the befieged to re- 
turn v^ith the fpoils of their camp, and the provifions which they had col- 

leded 



of Portmoak. 

Advantages and Li/advantages. — The advantages of this 
parifh are confiderable. Fuel is cheap and in great abun- 
dance. Peats are eafily got in feveral places of it; and 
what is of more confequence, the coal pits of Lochow, Kel- 
tic and Lochgellj are in the immediate neighbourhood. It 
labours, however, under great difad vantages ; among 
which may be reckoned diftant markets for the produce of 
the lands, and very bad roads. The value of the property 
might be increafed, and the circumftances of the people 
bettered in various ways. By ftreighting the courfe of the 
Leven, and draining the adjacent meadows, perhaps 3C0 
acres of arable ground would be added to the parilh. This 
is not only pradicable,. but would foon repay the expence 
of doing it, and contribute to the health of the inhabitants. 
But the moll valuable improvement which this diftrift 
could receive, is a turnpike road from Kinghom or 
Burntifland, northwards, through the pariflies of Kinghorn, 
Auchtertool, Auchterderran, Ballingry and Portmoak, to 
join the road from Perth to the Queensferry, about two or 
three miles north of Kinrofs. By this travellers from the 
north of Scotland to Edinburgh would reach the Forth, by 
a road fliorter than that to the Queensferry by feveral 
miles. This, added to the diftance betwixt the foutb 
Queensferry and Edinburgh, which would alfo be cut ofF, 
would be a faving to the public of great importance. Ivt 

this 

ledted for a long fiege. (Sec Hetlor Boece and Buchanan).— Thh was 
■ot the only time the EngJifli vifitcd this place in an hoftile manner. 
Oliver Cromwell, (after defeating the royal army at Inverkeithing. un- 
der Sir John Brown of Fordell), in his way to Perth, made a halt ia 
thij panfli, and lodged himfelf in the houfc of Kirknefs. This eftate then 
belonged to, and is ftiil pofTelTtd by a branch of the Morton family. In 
the eaft corner of this parifli are to be feen the ruins of the caftk of Ar-

this way, indeed, the paflage acrols the Frith would be 
longer ; but this would fcarcely be felt, if paflengers were 
as readily ferved at Burntifland, (which, it is hoped, will 
foon be the cafe) as at the Queensferry. The advantages 
which the farmers, and confequently the proprietors of this 
diftrift, would derive, from giving tliem accefs to the maif- 
ket-towns upon the coaft of Fife, are obvious and great. It 
is to be hoped, that the public fpirit of the gentlemen con- 
cerned, added to the confideration of private intereft, wilt 
foon lead them to execute a plan of fuch general utility.

<p>
Name, Situation, and Extent. 

a "HE ancient name of this parifh was Conveth, but it 
is now much better known by that of Laurencekirk. 
It is faid to have received the latter appellation upon the 
dedication of the church to St Laurence, not long before 
the Reformation. It is fituatcd in the county of Kincardine, 
in the prefty tery of Fordoun, and in the Synod of Angus 
and Mearns. Its form is triangular. Its greateft "length 
from eaft to weft is rather above 4 miles j and its greateft 
breadth between north and fouth is about 3. A map of 
the parifli has been drawn, from which it appears, that its 
fuperficial contents amounts to 4381 fquare acres. 

Surface^ Soil, Rivers.— -The parifli confifts of one large 
ridge, extending longitudinally from eaft to xveft, and 
floping gently to its northern and fouthem extremities. 
Its appearance is not diverfified by hills, rocks, or any ftri- 
king inequalities in the furface. The foil is fertile, moftly 
on a clayey bottom. The fmall river Leuther, which ri-

fes in the Grampian hills, and falls into the North Efkt^ 
pafles through it. In its courfe it turns many mills of dif- 
ferent forts, in this, and in the adjoining pariflies of For- 
doun and Aberlethnot. Neajr its jundion with North Elke, 
it abounds in trouts. Nine brooks likewife interfefl th$ 
pariih of Laurencekirk ; feven upon the fouthern and two 
upon the northern fide of the Leuther. 

Climate, l^c. — This parifh and the neighbourhood are 
fubjedl to frequent viciffitudes of weather j but, on the 
whole, they are not unhealthy. No particular difeafes 
prevail. Forty or 50 years ago the inhabitants were fre- , 
quently attacked by agues in the fpring. But fince the I 
marflies have been drained, that difeafe feldom makes its 1: 
appearance. Several perfons have reached the age of 90. i: 
One is remembered to have lived above 100 years: A I 
Hian aged 95 is now living, and has ftill ftrength to walk jj 
4 or 5 miles, and return within the famie day.

ProduBio/is, Agriatlture, \3c. — Seventy acres of the lands 
in Laurencekirk are covered with woods, confifting of all 
the Variety of foreft trees which grow commonly through 
Scotland. Marfhes and meadows occupy 120 acres. la 
fome farms a third part, in others a half of the farm is laid 
down with artificial grafles, which are partly ufed as pa- 
fture, and partly cut for hay. Somewhat more than a half 
of all the land in the pariHi is cultivated for the produ6tioo

of grain and roots. Flax is raifed only in fmall quantities, 
and for family ule. Oats, barley, peas, potatoes, and 
turnips, are the chief articles of crop. All forts of garden 
fluff for the kitchen are produced in abundance. Agricul- 
ture has certainly arrived at a confiderable ftate of im- 
provement, yet little wheat is fown. There are fome 
ploughs fitted up with wheels in the Engli'fh fafliion. But, 
jn general, they are of the conftrudion common throughout 
Scotland, with iron heads, and the boards upon both fides 
covered with plates of iron. The inconvenient ploughs, 
with clumfy timber heads and rough unfhod boards, which 
were formerly ufed here, are now entirely laid afide. The 
number of ploughs employed in the parifli are about 6c. 
There arc between 70 and 80 carts, and 2 p»ft chaifes. 
The number of black cattle is fuppofed to be about 
1000 ; and that of the horfes 200 Thefe, and a few Iheep, 
are the chief domeftic animals. — Seed-time ufually com- 
mences about the middle of March ; harveft in the begin- 
ning of September. The parifli annually fupplies the neigh- 
bouring towns of Stonehaven, Montrofe, and Brechin, with 
large quantities of meal, barley, &amp;c. — The price of provi- 
fions has been increafed to nearly double within thefe 20 
years. Beef, mutton, and veal, are now fold at4d. a- 
pound, and every other article of provifion in the fame 
proportion. — Labourers in hufbandry earn from pd. to is. 
a-day ; mafons and joiners from 15 d. to20 d.; tailors fome- 
what lefs. The wages of a man fervant, living in his ma- 
iler's houfe, are from L. 6 to L. 7 &amp;-year ; of a female fer- 
vant from L. 3 to L. 4. 

Rent. — Houfes are let at from 6 to 7 per cent, on the 
rate at which they are built. The beft arable land is ren- 
ted at a guinea an acre, but fometimes higher. The beft paf-

from 10 s. to 15 s. The average rent of fuch farms as were 
let on leafe about 36 years ago, does not exceed 5 s. an acre. 
Sonie farms confift of 200 acres, fome of 300 and upwards. 
The whole farmers in the parilh are only 29; the farms 
have, of late, been increafing in extent, and diniinifhing in 
number. The vakied rent is L.4294 : 19 : 8 Scotch ; the 
real rent is about L. 2000 Sterling, 

Village of Laurencekirk. — The village of Laurencekirk, 
in this parifli, the property partly of the Earl of Kintore, 
and partly of Lord Gardenfton, is, at prefent, thriving and 
populous. In 1730 the number of its inhabitants did not ex- 
ceed 80. In 1762, when the eftate of johnfton was pur- 
chafed by Lord Gardenfton, they had decreafed to 54, In 
1765, he began to build a new village, and marked out 
ground upon his own property, for a ftreet to extend fix 
furlongs in length. This is now nearly filled up with hou- 
iies on both fides, and contains about 500 inhabitants. la 
1779, the new village was eredled into a burgh of barony ; 
its territory fixed to the length of the king's highway, 
within his- Lordftiip's eftate, and to 838 yards in breadth on 
each fide of the road-, the burgeflTes are empowered to eleft 
every three years, from June i. 1780, a magiftracy, con- 
lifting, of a bailie and four councillors, to regulate the police 
and manage the concerns of the burgh, with the privilege 
of holding weekly markets, and an annual fair. The pu- 
blic-fplrited proprietor of this village has alfo built and fitted 
up an elegant inn, with a library of books adjoining to it, 
chiefly for the amufement of travellers who may ftop there. 
He has likewife encouraged and contributed liberally to 
the eftablifliment of a bleachfield, in which about 17 hands 
are at prefent employed, and an additional number will ve- 
ry foon be needed. One refidenterin the burgh manufac- 
tures linen to &amp; moderate extent, for the ufe of the adjoining

country, and for other markets ; 23 operative weavei-s are 
employed principally by him. The village has alfo a 
fmiths, 3 mafons, 4 fhoemakers, 5 tailors, 10 Wrights, and 
I ftocking-maker, befides an attorney, a furgeon, and an ar- 
tift for drawing. 

Church and Poor. — The church was built in 1626 ; the 
manfe in 173 1. Thefe buildings have been both repaired 
from time to time, but atprefent they ftand greatly in need 
of farther reparation. The church is by much too fmall for 
the congregation. The mailers of the New College of St 
Andrew's are patrons of the parifli. They were firft con- 
ftituted titulars of the tithes, by Archbifliop Hamilton in 
1550. Sixty two years afterwards they were ordained by 
the Commiilioners of Parliament, perpetual patrons; and a 
ftipend of 250 merks Scotch, the kirk lands pertaining to the 
college, as glebe, and a manfe decerned to the minifter. 
The prefent value of the living, including 19 acres of glebe, 
and kirk lands, and eftimating the viftual ftipend at I2S. 
Sterling a boll, is, at leaft, L. 90 Sterling. — About L. 25 
Sterling, the annual amount of the Sunday coUeftions, 
with the intereft of fome fmall mortifications, is divided a- 
mong 12 poor houfeholders. 

Population. — The inhabitants of this parifli are chiefly of 
the eftabliflied church. Few Seceders or Epifcopalians, and 
only two Roman Catholics relide here. The whole num- 
ber, to which the population at prefent amounts, including 
perfons of all ages and denominations, is about 1200, which 
is about 450 more than the amount in 1755, being at that 
time, according to Dr Webfter's ftate of the population of 
Scotland, only 757 fouls. The annual average of births is 
33, of deaths 30, and of marriages, 15. 



Roads, 



i8o Statijlkal Account 

Roads, Bridges, Minerals, Fuel.— The roads and bridges 
through this parifh are in a tolerably good condition. 
They were originally made, and are ftill kept in repair by 
ftatute labour. The bridge at the village of Laurencekirk, 
indeed, has been lately raifed and widened at Lord Gar- 
denftone's expence. — Moor-ftone, and free or fand-ftone,are 
to be found through this parifli, — Peats, whins, and broom 
are the only fuel it affords. Coals are brought from Mon- 
trofe, which is lo miles diftant. The boll cofts 8 s. 6 d. on 
the fhore, befides 3 s. 6 d. for carriage. — One weak chaly- 
beate fpring rifes near Johnfton. Its water is ufed indif- 
criminately in various cafes, and fometimes not without 
fuccefs. 

Mijcellaneous Ohfervations. — It is a happy circumftance 
in the fituation of this parifh, that it lies in the middle of 
the Mearns, and is interfefted by the great north road, lead- 
ing from Edinburgh to the north, through Perth, Aberdeen, 
BanlF, Elgin, Invernefs,&amp;c. It is thus a confiderable thorough- 
fare and derives no fmall advantage from the numbers of 
travellers who are perpetually paffing. In tlie fpring of 
that calamitous year, 1783, when a general fcarcity took 
place, from the failure in the preceding crop, the kirk-fef- 
lion agreed to advance L. 50, and the adminiftrators of the 
burgh L. 20, for the purchafe of a quantity of meal, to be 
retailed in the courfe of the fummer, in fuch fmall quanti- 
ties as the kirk-feflion Ihould refpeftively direft, to the in- 
duftrious poor within the parifh ; the diftribution to be re- 
gulated by tickets, and the price fo reduced, that the feflion 
ihould lofe L. 25 Sterling, and the burgh L. 10, by the pm*- 
chafe and the fale. By thefe precautions the poorer peo- 
ple were fupplied with meal throughout the whole feafon, 
at the rate of i d. a-peck cheaper than it was fold any 
where in the neighbourhood, and loft no time in wandering 
about in fearch of it, which was the cafe in other places.

The fame dialed of the Englifh language is fpoken here, as 

along the greater part of the eaftem coaft of Scotland No 

murders or fuicides have been committed in this parifh, 
nor have any emigrated, or been baniflicd from it, fo far as 
can be remembered. None have died for want, there 
being plenty both of bread and work in the place. — There 
is very little wafle ground, and no cfommon in the paxiih. 
There is a great deal of inclofcd ground. The peo- 
ple are fenfible of the advantages of inclofures, when 
made properly fencible, which is feldom the cafe where 
ftones cannot be had, but at a great diftance and expence. — 
As a fpecimen of the change, that has taken place within 
thefe 20 years, with regard to drefs, it may be worth 
mentioning, that about i8 or 19 years ago, a hatter 
came from Edinburgh to fettle in the village, and having 
arrived upon a Saturday, he attended public worfliip on 
Sunday ; but feeing only three hats in the whole church be- 
fides his own, he was fo difcouraged, that he dropped his 
fcheme, and left the place on Monday. But were he now 
here, he would hardly fee a fingle bonnet in the whole 
congregation. The drefs of the women has kept pace 
with that of the men, and the ftile of living, in general, is 
proportionally altered.

Extent and Situation. \ 

UNST is the moft northern of the Shetland ifles. It 
belongs to the Prefbytery of Shetland, which en- 
joys Synodical jurifdiftion. It extends 8 computed 
miles in length from S. W. to N. E. and is, in breadth, 
from 2 miles to 3 and a half. Its form approaches to an ; 
oblong fquare. The ifland of Yell lies at fome diftance 
from it, on the S. W. fide ; Fetlar on the S.-, to the N. W. 
the N. and the E. nothing appears but the wide expanfe of 
the German Ocean. Unft lies in the latitude of 610 12/ 
north ; and conftitutes a part of the county and ftewartry 
of Orkney and Shetland. • 1

Surface and Scenery. — In comparifon with the other ; 
Shetland ifles, Unft is reckoned level, yet its furface is diver- j 
fified by feveral extenfive and moderately high hills. \

Vallafield, fifing within a mile and a half of its fouthern 
.'Xtremity, runs in a diredlion parallel to the wefterncoaft, and 
under different names, to the very northern point. Saxaforth, 
a hill of confiderable height, and the higheft in the ifland, 
lies towards its northern end. Crofsfield ftands nearly ia 
the middle, and at right angles to Vallafield. Vordhill 
tretches out parallel to the eaft coaft. Tra£ts of level 
ground are interiperfed among thefe hills. The higheft of 
the hills are ftiU covered with mols, or black peat earth, to 
the depth of fome feet. On fuch as are lower, (and there 
are feveral befides thofe which have been enumerated), the 
mofles have been exhaufted, and the bare rocks appear here 
and there, through a thin layer of mould, covered with a 
green dry fward, which yields excellent pafture. The 
hill of Saxaforth is not lels than 700 feet high, and may be 
feen 14 leagues off the coaft. Vallafield rifes to the 
height of 600 feet. The ifland is interfered by no rivers ; 
but contains, (in proportion to its extent at leaft) many 
fmall frefli water lakes. Loch Cliff is two miles long, and 
nearly half a mile broad. The fcenery is pleafant along its 
banks. A chain of fmaller lochs run from Cliff to the 
fouthern end of the ifland. 

Sea-coaji. — The fea-coaft of Unft being broken and in- 
dented by fo many bays and creeks, its extent cannot be 
eafily afcertained, nor has any accurate meafurement of it 
been yet attempted. Several iflets are fcattered here and 
there around it. All the fliores expofed to the main ocean, 
but efpecially the head lands, are confiderably high and 
rocky. The higheft of the head lands rifes to the height of 
60 or 70 fathoms. The fliores of the bays and harbours 
again are low, flielving, and fandy. The little ifle of Uya, 
about a fqnare mile in extent, and inhabited, lies fouth of 
Unft, and forms, upon that quarter of this ifland, the . har- 
bour

hour called Uya found. Balta, on the eaft of Unft, an 
iflet on which cattle are put to graze, forms the fine road 
or harbour of Balta found. Watfwick, on the S. W. fide of 
the parifh, is another harbour, but much more open and 
lefs extenfivc, than either of the two already mentioned. 
The principal bays are Harlfwick, Norwick, Burra-firth, 
Woodwick, and Wick : In any of thefe, veffels may an- 
chor for a tide or two, but none of them is a fafe harbour. 
Befides the fmall ifles of Uya and Balta, which protedl the 
harbours named after them, the iflets of Hafgruna and 
Hunie, with the holms of Sha, Burra-firth, Woodwick, 
Newgord, Hogaland, and Weatherholm, are alfo appenda- , 
ges of Unft. The tides flow nearly fouthward, and ebb : 
northward : The windings of the coaft, however, occafion j 
them to vary flightly from thefe diredtions. The 
greateft velocity of the current in fpring tides, is at the rate ^ 
of 6 miles an hour. Off Lambanefs, the N. E. point of 
Unft, and of all Shetland, where there is a free communi- ' 
cation between the Atlantic Ocean and the northern feas, I 
the current flows with fuch rapidity, as to rife to an high j 
fwell that proves dangerous to the fiftiermen, even in 
calm weather *. 



Caves and Rivulets. — Around the coaft there are a va- 
jiety of natural caves. At Sha there is one, the roof of which 
is fupported by natural pillars of an odlagonal figure. At 
Burra-firth there is a number of caves, opening from the fea, 

and 

* The ancient inhabitants of thefe idands fet up, on the eminences a- 
round the harbours, warts, or marks to diredl the conrfe of veflels failing 
along the coaft, placing one near the point of each arm of the har- 
bour, and a third near the bottom. But although this be the northern ex- 
tremity of the Britifll dominions, and although thefe parts be not a little 
frequented, and even late in the year, by (hips trading to the White Sea, 
and the northern parts of Norway, yet government has not hitherto been 
induced to cre€l a light houfe any where on the fliores of this ifland.

and riuiiiing backwards under the hills. The greater part 
of thele are too low and narrow to admit a boat, but are 
not acceffible by any other means. One only is vifited 
once a-year, and plundered of the feals by which it is fre- 
quented. Eaftward from the bay of Burra-firth, under an 
arm of the bill of Saxaforth, there is a grand natural arch, 
wide enough to admit a boat to row through it, 300 feet in 
length, and of confiderable height. A fliort way eaftward 
from this, there is another, but ofalefs magnificent appear- 
ance. This ifland has not yet been difcovered to afford any 
mineral fprings. The waters of a copious fpring, called Ycla- 
burn, or Hiclaburn, (the hurji of health *), although pure 
from all mixture, are elleemed, in the neighbourhood, to be 
highly beneficial to health. 

Fojfils. — Unft abounds in iron ftone, which, however, has 
not yet been applied to any ufefiil purpofe. It affords 
large veins of jafper, fome pieces of which are beautifully 
variegated with black and green ihades and fpots. Rock 
cryflal, remarkable for its purity and hardnefs, has likewife 
been found here. A beautiful piece of garnet §, having 
twelve equal parallelogramic fides, was lately picked 
from a rock. Through the fparry rocks, cubical bits of 
Tulphur, of a bright gold colour, are often found. A fpeciesof 
rough ftone, of a long. grain, a greyifh colour, in appearance 
fdmewhat fimilar to decayed wood, fit for building, and ve- 
•y fuitable for lintels, is found at Munefs and Norwick. At 
Jtlagarth there is a vein of dark brownifh freeftone, of a 
I'ery durable nature. A foft ftone, commonly nanied Clemely

and fit for moulds, is alfo among thofe which this ifland af- 
fords. Great plenty of white fpar, or perhaps quartz, 
rounded by the aftion of the waves, is thrown up upon the 
fea beach. Some fpecimens of a grayifh flate have 
been tried ; but no quarries of it are wrought, Limeftone 
abounds at Cliff, from which the vein proceeds in a fouth. 
wefterly direftion to Saxabernefs, the fouth-weft extremity 
of the ifland. The whole ifland abounds in clay of a very 
tough quality, and apparently very fit for bricks or potte- 
ry. A whitifli fubftance, which feems to be an inferior 
fpecies of marl, is found at Uya-found. Subfl;ances which 
feem to be ochreous, or bituminous, are alfo to be feen here 
and there ; and matter of a naphthalic appearance has been 
pbferved upon the edges of fome wells *. 

Produce. — Black oats, bear, potatoes, cabbages, and va- 
rious garden roots, and greens which grow in great per- 
feftion, are the mofl; common vegetables in this ifland. 
Artichokes, too, of a delicate tafl:e, are produced here, v/ith 
fome fmall fruit, and mofl; of the garden flowers that grow 
in the north of Scotland. There is little or no fown grafi. 
but the meadows are rich in red and white clover, and in 
the feafons of vegetation, are enamelled with a beautiful 
^jrofufion of wild flowers. The pafture grounds, in tlie

* No mines of any kind have hitherto been wrought in this ifland. 
But Mr Ciichton^of the Anglefea mining company, (who are now working 
for copper in the fouthern parts of Shetland,) declared immediately upon 
landing at Belmont, that the whole Ihore gave indications of its contain- 
ing great abundance of coal near the furface. A variety of beautiful 
fliells are fcattered upon thefe fliores, among which are the John o'Groat's 
'buckie, and the Unicorn's liorn. The fponge, called Mermaid's glove, is 
often taken up, upon this coaft, by the fifliermen'i hooks. A great va- 
riety of corals, blanching out in irregular forms, is likewife found here. 
The fea apple is alfo plenteous. The alga marina, with different oth?.t 
(ta-\veeds, are d/iveii on fliore by high furges.

commons, are generally covered with a fliort, tender, 
flowering heath. Some curious and rare plants have been 
difcqvered in this ifland by fome gentlemen Ikilled in bo- 
tany. The common people gather fcurvy grafs, trefoil, 
and fome other plants that grow in the ifland, for their me- 
dicinal qualities. The roots of the tormentil ar» ufed in 
tanning hides. 

^ladrupeds. — The quadrupeds of this ifland, which, 
indeed, are common through the refl: of the Shetland ifles, 
are black cattle, horfes, flieep, hogs, rabbits, dogs, cats^ 
feals, and otters. The oxen weigh from 300 lb. to 5 00 lb. 
which may be valued at between L. 2 and L. 4 Sterling. 
The cows are of various colours. Some are curioufly 
fpeckled and fpotted, and weigh from 150 lb. to 200 lb. 
The beef of thefe is of very fuperior delicacy and flavour *. 
The whole number of cows and oxen in the ifland is not 
fewer than 2000. Of thefe 11 50 are milk cows. In

* Prices of Promfions. — There are no regular markets for previfions 
in this ifland. But the prices may be eftimated at the following rates : 
beef at three halfpence ^er pound ; live calves, a week old, from 14 d. 
to 16 d. each; flicep, between two and five years old, from 3s. to 4 s. 
6 d. ; pigs, ready for the fpit, rarely to be bought under i s. ; chicksns 
three halfpence each ; coarfe butter twopence halfpenny ^er pound; eggs 
1 d. a dozen; geefe, is. each; hens, 4 d. cocks, ad. The prices of 
meal and grain vary with the crops. In a plentiful year, oatmeal is fold 
at 2 s. the lifpond, of 30 lb. Dutch weight, or 32 lb. 13 oz. Englifh; whefi 
the crops prove bad, the price fifes to 3 s. or 4 s. a lifpond. In the years 
1783 and 1784, meal from Scotland was fold here at 30 s. a boll. In 
years of lefs exceflive fcarcity, Scotch meal is bought here at 3 s. or 4s. a 
lifpond. The price of cattle has rifen confiderably within thefe lad 13 
years. In confequence of the increafed Value of the hides chiefly, of 
which confiderable quantities are every year exported from Shetland to 
Leith, the value of a cow or ox has rifen, in this fpace of time, from 153. 
or 20 s. to 30s. and 40 s. and fometimes even confiderably more. Flour, 
barley, bifcuits, peas, fugar, wines, teas, fpirituous liquors, 5cc, are all ini-. 
ported, and chiefly frum Leith.

fpring 1784, 570 cattle died for want of food, of which 280 
were milk cows. The horfes are well known for their 
fmall fize and hnrdinefs. They are called Jhelttes in Bri. 
tain. Though they meafure only from 9 to 11 hands 
high, they are fit for riding, and all the ordinary fervices 
of hufliandry, and are now frequently ufed in noblemen's 
and gentlemen's carriages. Of thefe there may be nearly 
1000 in the ifland. But numbers of them die in fevere 
winters, as they never enjoy the protedtion of a liable. 
The Ihogp weigh ufually at full growth, from 30 lb. to 40 lb. 
each, and are covered with fleeces of the very finefl: cf 
wool. The mutton of Unft, Fetlar, and DunrolTnefs, 13 
elleemed the beft in the country. The whole ftock of 
Hieep in this ifland having been lately numbered, in order 
to afcertain the value of the teind, was found to amount to 
660c. A fevere winter has, fince, however, dellroyed a- 
bout a third of that number. Hogs abound alfo in confi- 
derable numbers, and weigh from 60 to 100 lb. each.

The dogs are of the common cur kind, and the cats 
often defert the houfes and live wild among the rocks. 
Rabbits are more numerous in the iflets of Balta and IIu- 
nie, (appendages of Upft,) than in any other pare of Shet- 
land, of equal extent. Rats, mice, frogs, toads, and adders 
are unknown here. Otters and feals are tlie only amphi- 
bious animals to be found on thefe fliores. The feals breed 
in the caves above mentioned, and are found in great num- 
bers on the Chores of Uya, HafFgruna, Weatherholm, and 
Burra-firth. The otters are ftill more numerous. But nei- 
ther are now found in the fame abundance as formerly. 

Birds. — The tame fowls are geefe, ducks, pigeons, 
dunghill fowls, and a few turkies. The wild land fowls 
are plovers, pigeons, curlews, (commonly called wlaap)

miles weftward, is frequented by innumerable flocks of 
migratory birds. The Kittiweaks are, however, -mofi.

heights of rocks, and on the brink of precipices, 60 or ■100 
fathoms high *, and la many places projefting awfully over

bank above, and let each other down by ropes. Even at night, fo fearleft

Fi/b.—Tihe lakes produce trouts and flounders. Ling, cod, 
tuik, Ikate, hoUibut, and dogfifti are caught in abundance on 
the coaft of Unft, as well as of all the other Shetland ifles. 
Piltocks, fiUocks*, haddocks, mackarels, and flounders, are 
got immediately upon the fliore. The fhell-fifh are fpouts, 
mufcles, cockles, cidlocks, fmurlins, partans, crabs, limpets, 
and black wilks. A few fturgeons are fometimes driven a- 
lliore here, by high winds. The porpoife is frequently feen, 
but feldom caught. Large lean whales are fometimes 
ftranded in the creeks, and fometimes chafed afliore by 
boats. Thefe commonly meafure from 60 to 90 feet in 
length, and are denominated jinners. The fpermaceti 
whale, a much more valuable prize, fometimes wanders to 
this cpaft, and is here entangled and taken. 

Fijhery. — Fifliing is an important branch of the induftry 
of thefe iflanders. By the fale of the ling, cod, and tulli 
which they take, the tenants obtain money to pay their 
rents. About 80 tons of thefe fifh have, upon an average, 
been annually taken, for thefe laft feven years. Thefe are 
falted and dried, and in this flate exported to Barcelona, 
Ancona, Lilbon, Leith, and Hamburgh. The feafon for 
taking them, is from the beginning of June to the middle 
of Auguft. All the men, in health, from the age of 16 to

tities upon the coaft, and contribute greatly to the fuftenance of the poorer 
inhabitants. They are a very nouridiing article of food, and good oil is 
alfo prepared from them. In the prcfent feafon, they have been taken 
in fuch abundance, that about 100 hogflieads of their oil will probably be 
exported, befides what may be ufed in the ifland. The oil is prepared 
from the livers of thefe fifties. They are fiflied with rods, and the bait 
ufed in angling for them is limpets, which have been previoufly boiled, to 
part them frem the fhell.

60 years, are commonly employed in this fiftiery. Five or 
fix row in each boat, And there are at prefent no fewer 
than 78 boats in the parifti, appropriated to the ufe of 
the fiftiing. Thefe boats meafure- from 15^ to i8» feet 
in length of keel; are rowed with fix oars, by a number of 
rowers proportionate to the fize of the boat ; and ufe from 
30 to 60 ground lines, each 55 fathoms in length, and ha- 
ving from 18 to 20 hooks faftened to it, by a fmaller line, 
half a fathom long. Piltocks, which are almoft always to 
be obtained near the fliore, are ufed as baits. The fiflier- 
men direft their courfe in failing, by obfervations on the 
land, called tneeths^ and formed from the bearings of two 
high emioences. They diftinguifli the fpots frequented by 
the fifti from obferving the nature of the bottom. Wheij 
fuccefsful in fifliing, the fmaller boats bring in about 300 
lings ; the larger from 500 to 606 in the feafon^ befides con- 
fiderable quantities of cod and tulk. Before the prefent 
year, the value of frefti ling was about 4 s. a hundred 
weight, of frefti tufe, nearly the fame, and of cod, 2 s. 8 d. 
Thefe prices have fallen, however, 20 per cent, in confe- 
quence of the increafed attention to fifliing throughout all the 
north of Europe. The price of the dried fifli is from i x s. 
to 14s. 6d. the hundred weight; and Government allows 
the curer a bounty of 3 s. a hundred weight, which is call- 
ed the debenture. The attention of both landlords and te- 
nants is turned towards the improvement and extenfion of 
this fifliery, as their beft fource of emolument. The num- 
ber of men employed in fifliing is about 350, who go out in 
70 boats. The boats are put together here, but the boards 
are brought, ready fliaped and drefled, from Norway. 
Two large boats, with decks, of 10 or 15 tons burden 
efch, are alfo employed in conveying fifli, fait, &amp;c. between 
tl^e creeks of this ifland and the port of Lerwick. 



Kelp.

Statijlical Account 



Kelp. — The manufadure of kelp was tried here, for the 
firft time, in the year 1780. But the bays are, in genera], 
too fliallow, and the fliores too miich expofed to the ocean, 
to afSard any great quantity of fea- weeds for this purpofe. 
About 10 tons of kelp are annually prepared here ; the ex- 
pence of making it may be from L. a to L. 2, 10 s. a ton, 
■varying as the Ihores are more or lefs accelBble j and the 
price which it brings is about L. 4 the ton. 

Agriculture. — Before the fifliery became an objed of 
fuch general attention, agriculture was in a more thriving 
ftate. The farms have been fince fubdivided into fmaller 
portions, and the number of the ploughs has decreafed. 
The land annually plowed for black oats, bear, and potatoes, 
may be about 1500. acres. Tang and fea ware are ufed as 
manures, * wherever they can be procured. The plough 
is of a peculiar ftrufture, light and fimple %• It has only one 
llilt ; the flock is double feathered ; the ploughman walks 
not behind the plough, but at the left fide ; the driver walks 
backwards; 2 horfes and 2 oxen, 4 oxen or 4 horfes are 
yoked abrcaft in it. A man may bear this plough to any 
diftance in one hand. The greater part of our ground, how. 
ever, is too rocky to be plowed, and is therefore delved 
with fpades ; and thefe are often ufed in the culture even of 

what 

* The people in this parifli have a fingular mode of preferving the 
dung for manure. It is not, as in other places, carried daily out of the 
ftalls or byres in which the cattle ftand, but is fpread through the whole 
area of the houfc, and left to accumulate, till the cattle can no longer find 
entrance betweeu the floor and the roof. D17 earth is fometimes carried 
in, and ftrewed as a mixture among the dung. And quantities of grafs 
and fhort heath are, in Auguft, every year, mown upon the hills, and af- 
ter being left for fome time to wither, carried home, put up in ftacks like 
hay, and ufed from time to time in fpreading the bires, fo as to keep the 
cattle dry and warm amidft the dung accumulating under them. When 
the houfe is filled, the dung is carried out to be/pread upon the fields,

vvhat might be tilled with the plough *. No land is plowed 
lere before fpring. Oats are fown in the end of March, 
iind beginning of April ; bear begins to be fown in the end 

of April. The crops are fit to be reaped in September ; 

and, by the end of Oflober, the corn is ufually in the yards, 

and the potatoes in the houfes. 

Mi//s. — The water-mills, like the ploughs, are of a An- 
gular conftru6lion. They are without wheels. A round 
piece of wood, about 4 feet in length, and fitted with 12 
fmall boards, in the fame manner as the extremity of the 
exterior wheel of an ordinary mill, with a ftrong ironfpindle 
fixed to its upper end, fupplies the place of a wheel in thefe 
iniUs. The iron fpindle, palling through the under mill- 
ftone, is fixed in the upper. A pivot in the under end of 
1 the ttrl (the piece of wood above mentioned,) runs in a 
hollowed iron plate. The water falls upon the awes or 
feathers of the tzrl, at an inclination of between 40 and 45 
degrees. The miliftones are commonly from 30 to 36 in- 
ches in diameter. The ti?-/ occupies the fame fituation un-

a-year; and receives, befides, his board and a pair of flioes. A farm fer- 
vant of inferior fkill receives from 20 s. to 25 s. a-year. A boy, or young

the tirl is always equal to that of the millftones. 

Commerce and MamifaBures. — Notwithftanding the num- 
bers of cattle, and the large proportion of milk, cows, no 
cheefe is prepared in this ifland. The milk is almoft all 
made into butter. Of this article, between 120 and 150 
barrels, each of which may contain fomewhat more than 
2oolb. are annually exported. Of beef, too, from 10 to 
20 barrels, with tallow in proportion, are every year ex- 
ported from the ifland. Almofl every woman in the 
ifland manufa£lures fine woollen ftockinss. Thefe are 
much valued for foftnefs and warmth. Confiderable quan- 
tities of them are fent every year to Edinburgh. The 
price which they bring, is from is. 4 d. to 2s. 6d. the 
pair. Articles of finery for female drefs are chiefly re- 
ceived in return. Some coarfe cloth for the inner cloath- 
ing of the common people is likewife manufaflured here. 
But of this the quantity is butfmall. Few of the inhabitants 
have been regularly bred to any mechanic art. Yet there are 
a number of felf-taught builders, flaters, wrights, carpenters, 
tanners, flioemakers, weavers, and tailors, whofe proficien- 
cy in thefe different arts is wonderful, when compared with 
their opportunities of improvement *. 

Fuel. — Peats are almoft the only article of fuel ufed here. 
Some fmall quantities of Scotch and Englifli coals are ufed 
by the more opulent inhabitants. But the expence of the 

freight,

freight, and the exorbitant duty which has very unreafon- 
ably been laid upon Scotch coals, exported beyond the Red- 
Head of Angus, render this article of fuel by much too dear 
for general ufe, through the Shetland ifles. Even peats coft 
no little labour and expence ; for although all the hills ap- 
pear to have been originally covered over, in a great meafure, 
with peat earth ; yet, upon the whole eaft fide of the ifland, 
except only in the fouth eaft corner of Munels, this natural 
fund of fuel has been, by degrees, entirely exhaufted. The 
hills of Vallafield and Saxaforth are, at prefent, the princi- 
pal refources. But many of the inhabitants are at a very 
inconvenient diftance from thefe. Some find it more com- 
modious to import their peats from the neighbouring ifiand 
of Yell. Others, efpecially the gentry refident about Balta 
Sound, are obliged to employ from 10 to 20 horfes, for the 
fpace of fix weeks, every year, to carry home their annual 
provifion of peats. 

Heritors and Rent. — The property of the ifland is at pre- 
fent divided among 37 heritors *. Of thefe 26 are refident. 

The 

* The tenures of landed property, the fubdivifions cf the lands, and 
the forms in which the rents are paid, are, in feme refpedt?, peculiar here. 
The lands are underftood to be divided into merks. A merk uf land, 
ho wever, does not confift uniforinly of a certain area. In Tome inftances, 
a merk may be lefs than an acre; in others, perhaps, equal to two acres. 
Every merk again confifts of fo much arable ground, and of another part 
which is fit only for pafturage, but the arable part alone .varies in extent 
from lefs than one to two acres. Several of thefe merks, fometimes more, 
fometimes fewer, form a town. The towns vary in extent, like the merks 
of which they^are compofed. All the lands, not lying in common, are in- 
clofcd, (although aukwardly en jugh indeed,) by what are called toivn- 
dikes. Thefe wind about with the utmoft irregularity of form, in zig-zag 
diredlions, fometimes inclofing only one town ; fometimes uniting feveral 
within the fame inclofnre ; and, in certain places in the ifland, extend- 
ing

The principal heritors are, in the order of the extent of 
their property, Mr Mouat of Garth, Mr Sanderfon of Bunefs, 
Mr Scot of Greenwall, and Sir Thomas Dundas of Kerfe. 
Within thefe two years, a confiderable part of the lands 
in the ifland have been fold by the former proprietors, and 
bought chiefly by gentlemen, who were before rendent he- 
ritors, at from 40 to 70 years purchafe of the neat rents. 
This circumftance is a clear proof of the great difference be- 
tween the nominal and the real income, which the lands in 
the ifland afford. The whole rents of the parifli, including 
fcatt, teinds, land tax, and rents paid for fifliings, may be e- 
qual in value to L. 790 Sterling. The valued rents, how- 
ever, 

ing around 30 or 40 farms together. Every farmer is obliged to repair, 
whenever it may become neceflary, a certain part of thefe dikes, propor- 
tional to the extent of the land which he pofTeffes. The whole lands with- 
in the dikes cultivated or referved for pafture, are 2267 merles. The 
land-tax payable from this ifland amounts to about 5 d. for every ir.crk of 
land within the town-dike?. The hills and commons are again divided 
into Jcattolds, from each of which a certain tax, called fcatt, was anciently 
paid to the Crown of Denmark, when Shetland made a part of the Danilh 
dominions ; became payable to the Scottilh monarch, when thefe iflands 
were finally ceded to Scotland ; fell at length, by donation from the 
Crown to a fubjedl fuperior, and is at prefent payable to Sir Thomas 
Dundas of Kerfe, Bart. Each merk of cultivated land within the town- 
dikes is burdened with the payment of from i s. to 15 d. of corn teind, 
in butter or oil. The proprietors of the lands receive for the arable part 
of every merk, 16 d. of yearly rent ; and for the pafturage part, under the 
denomination of grajfurn, 8 merks of butter, each confiding of 2o ounces 
Troy. The fcatt may amount to 6 d. for each meik of land, and is paid 
chiefly in butter and oil. The farmers pay likewife cafual teinds from 
their cows, flieep, and hanf or fifhing boats ; for each cow, 3 merks of 
butter in the year; for their flieep, in lambs and wool, to the value of 
1 d. for each, and for every haaf\o?it, 12 ling. Some of the common peo- 
ple poflefs lands upon what is called itdall tenure But the increafe of 
luxury is daily tempting them to expences, which, in the end, force them to 
difpofe of their landed property It is probable, therefore, that this mode 
of tenure may, in a fliort time, entirely ceafe here.

ever, do not amount to near this fum. The largeft farms 
let at L. 2, 12 s. ; the fmalleft at 15 s. All the farms are 
not conftantly occupied. The landlords rather court the 
tenants, than the tenants the landlords. The rents remain 
nominally nearly the fame as they were 20a years ago. 
But thefe being paid in fifli, in oil, in butter, the landlords 
continue to receive thefe articles nearly at the ancient pri- 
ces but they fell them at advanced rates proportionate to 
the increafe of wealth, of induftry, of population, and 
of luxury throughout Europe ; and thus in reality enjoy 
an augmentation of income, as well as the proprietors 
of lands in other parts of the Britilh dominions. Befides, 
circumftances render it neceffary for them to aft in 
fome manner, as contraftors with their tenants ; fupplying 
them with boats and the other implements for fifliing, and 
'with almoft every article whether of neceffity or of luxury 
which is imported for their ufe from foreign markets; 
while they purchafe, in return, almoft all the articles that 
the tenants can oiFer for fale ; a dralBc, by which they are 
naturally and reafonably gainers. The butter, it is aifo tb 
be obferv-d, is delivered to the landlord in certain cafes 
by the lifpond. This denomination of weight coriiifted o- 
riginally of only 12 Scotch or Dutch pounds. By various 
arts, however, and different imperfeft agreements, it has 
been gradually raifed to 30 lb. The fame number of lif- 
ponds ftill continue Jo be claimed by the landlord for his 
graffum rent, and by the proprietor of the teinds and crown 
rents, for what is payable to him in butter ; notwithftknding 
To great an augmentation in the value of the lifpond. This 
circumftance has operated very confiderably to increafe the 
revenue of the landholders. Complaints have^ indeed, 
been made of the injuftice, with which the proprietors of 
the teinds and the crown rents have availed themfelves of 
it.

Church and Poor. — The whole income of the minifter, 
confiding of the old money ftipend, an augmentation ob- 
tained in 1785, and payable in butter, ling, wool, and 
lambs ; a glebe of 1 2 merks of excellent land ; an annuity 
allowed, in confequence of an agreement by the heritors, 
and three days work by die pariihioners, may be eftimated 
at L. 108 Sterling a-year. The manfe is rather in a ruin- 
ous condition, but the prefent minifter preferred the annuity 
above mentioned to a new manfe. The church, which was. 
built in 1764, and repaired in 1789, ftands at a place call- 
ed Balcafta, at the diftance of 3 miles from the minifter's 
abode. It Ihould feem, that the ancient inhabitants of this 
parilh, if not more numerous, muft have been, at leaft, 
mor;e religious than the prefent ; for the remains of no 
fewer than 24 chapels ftill fubilft in the ifland. So late as 
1740, the clergyman was obliged to preach in three dif- 
ferent places of worlhip in rotation. There are 6 burying 
places in the ifland, at the ruins of as many old kirks *. , 
Sir Thomas Dundas is patron. — The number of poor de- 1 
pendent on alms is generally from 25 to 30. For their I 
fupport, the parifli is divided into 14 parts, called quarters, , 
through which the whole poor are difperfed. To each of I 
thefe a proportional number is afligned. In every family, , 
within each quarter, the poor belonging to it receive their ! 
board for as many days as the family occupies merks of I 
land; and after proceeding in this manner through the 
whole families in that quarter, return upon the firft again.

put upon the quarters, (as it is called) the minifter gives 
notice of the application from the pulpit; and if nothing be 
urged againft his charafter or circumftances, as renderinghim 
an improper object of the charity, he immediately obtains 
his requeft. The weekly contributions made at the church, 
together with the more liberal one at the celebration of the 
facrament, are expended in the purchafe of clothes, and o- 
ther neceflaries, for the poor, who are maintained upon the 
quarters. None are fufFered to go about begging. Chil- 
dren, if in moderately comfortable circumftances themfelves, 
are obliged to fupport their aged parents, when they fall 
into extreme poverty ; but are affifted from the funds in the 
hands of the kirk feflion, with money for the purchafe of 
elothes to them. 



' Population. — The number of inhabited houfes in this 
ifland is at prefent 300. The whole number of the inha- 
bitants, as returned to Dr Webfter in 1755, was 1368. In 
1780, it had increafed to 1853 ; and at prefent, (in 1791) 
amounts to 1988* The females are more numerous than 
the males. The annual births have been, upon an average,

* If the numbers have increafed, however, within thefe laft 30 or 40

to vifit the Ifland nearly every 20 years, and to carry off, with the rage of 
a peftJence, great numbers of all ages. In 17,0. inoculation became ge- 
neral here among all ranks. In 1783, a general inoculation was repeated

anchor every year in Balta Sound, both in failing to the 
North Seas, and in their return. Unft furnifhes the tenth 
part of ICO feamen whom the Shetland ifles are, by agree- 
ment, obliged to furnifli to government for the Royal Na-

fometimes Iqft, too, by accidents at fea. From the wafte 
of the peat earth upon the eaftern fide of the ifland, it fliould 
f(?em, that Unft muft have been peopled at a very remote

* The Norwegian or Norfe tongue appears to have been the ancient 
language of this, as well as of the other Shetland ifles. Mod of the pro- 
per names have their origin in that tongue. On each fide of the ifland 
there is a line of old buildings, at moderate diftances from one another, 
which are faid to h ave been Pi(flilh caftles. Thele are round towers, open 
above, and having very ftrong and thick walls built of very large ftones. 
The interior area of each of thefc may be about 20 or 30 feet in diameter. 
The walls are penetrated by galleries, into which probably the neigh- 
bouring inhabitants might retreat in times of danger, while their move- 
ables were fecured in the open area of the building. Some of thefe fland 
in the middle of lakes; fome are guarded on three fides by the fea; and 
they are generally furrounded by three or four moats of confiderable 
depth. At Munefs there is a ruinous feudal caftle, which appears, by an 
infcription in Saxon charaders above the gate, to have been built in the 
year 1598 by Laurence Bruce, who is faid to have been from Cultmalun- 
die, in Perthfhire, and to have fled hither in confequence of having llain 
a neighbour in an affray. It is an oblong fquare, 60 feet long, by 18 
feet wide within, and 24 feet in height. At each of the four angles there 
is a tower. Two of thcfe are hanging, and the other two rife from the 
ground. On the eafl fide of the parifb, between Balta Sound and Harlf-

treated as children of the families into w^hich they are ad-

.' pecially in winter. Many of the common people play with 
ikill upon the violin. Gin is the fpirituous liquor moft ge- 
nerally in ufe ; and although there are no ale-houfes, is 
often drunk by the lower clafles in too great quantities. 
Violations of chaftity happen now and then. An inordi-

into money, and any fortunate concurrence of circumftances, 
that might induce the natives to turn their attention more

Hall. A caufeway leads to it from the foot of the rock. On the hill of 
Crofsfield are forae concentric circles of earth and ftone, with eminences 
raifed in the middle. Upon the fame hill there is a fmall heap of ftones 
in the form of a grave, furrounded with a row of rude pillars. Two an- 
cient obelilks remain ; one near Lund, a thick and fliapelefs rock ; the 
other near Uya Sound, feems to have been a mark for direifling into that 
harbour, and is ten and a half feet high, flender and tapering to the top.

ded to Scotland b_y the Danes, the fcatt was fixed as the 
only land-tax that ftiould ever be levied upon thefe iflands. 
Since a new land-tax has, however, been impofed, it 
feems reafonable, that government flaould abolifli the pay- 
ment of the fcatt, by a compromife with the prefent pro- 
prietor, and a compenfation made to him for the lofs which 
he would thus fuftain. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — No roads have yet been 
made through this ifland, either by llatute labour or other- 
wife. Only a very few carts are ufed in it, and no 
carriages for pleafure. Inclofures have been tried by two 
gentlemen, and have been found of the utmoft utility. 
There is no poft-office in this ifland. The only poft-houfe, 
indeed, in Shetland, is at Lerwick, which is 40 miles di- 
fl;ant from this. 

Perhaps the moft extraordinary circumfl:ance refpeding 
this and the reft of the Shetland iflands, is this, that 
the landholders have hitherto fupinely waved their in- 
herent right of ireprefentation in Parliament, lately 
confirmed by a folemn judgment of the Houfe of Peers, 
and have tamely fufFered the freeholders of Orkney alone, to 
chufe the reprefentative for both countries j thereby de- 
priving theaifelves of all that Parliamentary influence 

which their neighbours hold in fuch high eftimation. Yet 

being thus exempted from the evils of political difl:ention. 
It is queftionable, whether their lituation is not, on the 
whole, the better of the two, being more favourable to 
peace, to union, and to. virtue, if it is lels calculated for 
promotion and preferment.</p>

UNITED PARISHES of 
    <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7901103">URQJJHART AND LOGGY WESTER</name>, 

(County of Ross.) 
By the Rev. Mr Charles Calder.</head> 


<p>
Origin of the Names. 

H E particular period, when the pariflies of Urquhart 
and Wefter Loggy were united, is. not known. None 
of the parochial records are of 'an older date than the year 
1709 i at which time they, made but one parifh. One of 
thefe pariflies derives its defignation, according to a tradi-, 
tion current in the place, from the firft church, on its for- 
mation into a parifh, having been built by a lady of emi- 
nent piety, Sophia Urquhart by name, of the family of 
Cromarty. The landed property of that family in this 
country was anciently of vaft extent and to that lady, it- 
is faid, the lands of Urquhart had been allotted as her dow- 
ry. Though they have long fince paffed from that to a 
different line of proprietors, yet ftill many of the inhabi- 
tants of this, and fome of the heritors of the adjacent pa- 
riih, are of that n^me. Hoggy^ the name of the other uni- 
ted parifh, is a Gaelic word, deicriptive of the fituation of 

the

the old church of that parifli, of which the ruins are flill 
extant in a pleafant valley, on the water of Conan, with 
the contiguous grouncls gently floping towards it, and o- 
verlooked by thofe on the oppofite fide of the river. It is 
called Loggy IVeJler, to diftinguifli it from another parifli 
of the fame name, within the bounds of this Synod. 

Situation, Extent, Proprietors, i^c. — Confidering thefe 
pariflies, which were thus originally divided, as now but 
one, and Urquhart, (agreeable to- general ufe), as compre- 
hending both, its extent is about 9 or 10 ftatute miles in 
length, and from 3 to 4 in breadth. It belongs to the Pre- 
fbytery of Dingwall, and Synod of Rofs. It lies along Cro- 
marty Frith, terminating in the river of Conan, in a direftion 
nearly from E. to W. and in a pofitlon in general gently 
declining towards the fhore. At high water the tide flows 
to within about ^ rpiles of the weftern extremity of the 
parifh, and at low water retires much the fame diftance 
from its eaftern extremity, leaving expofed a flat beach, 
with the river lying about half way between the oppofite 
fhores.r — There are only 3 heritors in the parifli, by whofe 
eftates it is formed into as many diftinft divifions. each of 
them occupying a continued extent of fome miles along the 
ftiore, (including under that defignation, both the fea coaft 
and the bank, of the river), and running from thence to the 
uncultiyated heights or ridge of moor lying between this 
parifli and thofe of Killearnan and Kilmuir-Wefter. The 
principal feats of the heritors, and the bulk of the fortunes 
of fome, if not all of them, lie in other pariflies. They 
have,, however, feats in this parifli. There is an old, but 
a good houfe, and lately repaired, at Findon, in the eaftern 
divifion of the parifli, belonging to Sir Roderick Macken- 
zie of Scatwell. It is pleafantly.fituated between Cromar- 
ty Frith on the one fide, and a beautiful oak wood on the 

other.

ither. There are a good many other foreft trees of confi- 
lerable fize, fcattered about the place ; and it is furniflied 
with an excellent garden. Fields and trees interfperfed, 
and alternately interfefted by a purHng brook, which runs 
by the houfe into the fea, form altogether a pleafmg 
fcene. The proprietor does not refide at this place. 
On this eftate there is a market town on the high road 
from Dingwall and the ferry of Scuddale to Cromarty. It 
is provided with an inn; and 4 fairs ar? held at it through- 
out the year. 

The chief proprietor of this pariih, Mr Forbes of Cul- 
loden, whofe eftate here lies between thole of the other 
two heritors, and is known by the name of Ferrintofti, has 
only a fmall, but neat and commodious lodge in it, occu- 
pied by his fador. As Ferrintofti does not conftitute the 
principal, fo neither is it the oldeft part of the landed pro- 
perty of the CuUoden family. It lignifies in Gaelic the 
T:hane's Landsy and made anciently a part of the Thane- 
clom of Calder. That family being heritable Sherifis of 
Vhe county of Nairn, Ferrintofti, whilft their property, Wa3 
on that account, (notwithftanding the diftance, and the in- 
tervention of the Moray Frith,) annexed to that county. 
It pafled from their pofl'eflion, about the beginning of laft 
century ; but its connexion with that county in fome re- 
fpefts ftill fubfifts. Hence Mr Forbes of CuUoden, as Ba- 
ron of Ferrintofti, votes in Parliamentary eledlions for the 
county of Nairn. The houfes, on fome parts of Ferrin- 
tofti, are extremely numerous. There is an oak wood on 
Ids eftate of confiderable extent. It abounds with delight- 
ful walks, and adds much to the ornament of the place. 
But the oaks in this parifti attain not in general to any 
confiderable fize, and are much retarded in their growth 
from not being inclofed. — Sir Heftor Mackenzie of Gair- 
-och, the only other heritor belonging to this parift), has

a handfome modern houfe at his place of Conanfide, in the 
weft end of the parifh, where he refides a part of the year. 
Situated on the banks of the river Conan, this place pof- 
fefles manj natural beauties ; and it has of late been much 
improved by art. There are plantations of firs on this e- 
.ftate, of confiderable extent. Some of them are intermix- 
ed with foreft trees, and all of them in a thriving condi- 
tion. Where difmal bleaknels lately prevailed, the eye is 
now prefented with refrelhing verdure. 

Population.— 'The population of this pariQi, as appears, 
from the following ftatements, has been very variable.. 
Occafional chafms in the old regifters, are partly the caufe ! 
of feledting the particular periods in the fubfequent ta-- 
ble of births and marriages. No regifter of deaths hag i 
been kept in this parifh ; nor could the number be fo ea- • 
fily afcertained as in many other pariihes, there being two 
burial places.

Ferrintojh Privilege. — The great decreafe in the num- 
ber of inhabitants ia this parifh, which appears from the 
above difference of its population in the years 1779 and 
1789, began to take place in 1786, and was occafioned by 
an event of.general notoriety, and which was at that time 
the fubjeft of Parliamentary difcuffion. The lands belong- 
ing to Mr Forbes of Culloden, which go by the name of 
Ferrintolh, and form the central and largeft divifion of the 
parifli, poflefled from 1690 to 1786, an exemption from 
the duties of excife on fpirits diftilled from grain of their 
growth. This privilege was originally granted to the pre- 
fent proprietor's great grandfather, Duncan Forbes of Cul- 
loden, one of thofe patriots, who, at the glorious period of 
the Revolution, flood up in defence of the religion and li- 
berties of their country. By oppofmg the dilaffefled, ard 
fupporting the loyal fubjedls in his neighbourhood, at 
much expence, he was materially inftrumental in qualhing 
a rebellion, which at that time threatened the north of 
Scotland. Going fome time thereafter to Holland, in pro- 
fecution of the fame patriotic plan, the Popilh faftion, du- 
ring his abfence, laid wafte his eftates, particularly the ba- 
rony of Ferrintofli, and deftroyed extenfive dillilleries, 
of which it was the feat at that time, and before the in- 
troduaion of the Excife into Scotland. In compenfation 
for the lofles, which he had thus fuftained in the fervice of 
Government, the Parliament of Scotland, by an aft paffed 
in 1690, farmed to him and his fucceffors, the yearly ex- 
cife 



of Vrquhart.

tile of the lands of Ferrintofh, for the fum of 400 merks 
Scotch, fubjeft, as explained by a pofterior aft, to n pro- 
portion of any additional duties of excife, that might 
thereafter be impofed by, law upon the kingdom. This 
privilege his fucceffors enjoyed without interruption, till 
the year 1786. As a mark of public favour, it was not 
more honourably acquired at firft, than it was amply me- 
rited afterwards, by a continued fucceffion of irriportant 
fervices in their country's caufe. In 171 5, the original 
granter's fon, adhering to the principles of the Revolution, 
raifed all the men upon his eftates, and deeply impaired 
his private fortune, by keeping them in arms at his own 
expence, till that rebellion was happily quelleci. The fer- 
vices rendered to Government in 1745, by that great man 
and ornament of his country, the flonourable Duncan For- 
bes of Cnlloden, Prelident of the Court of Seffion, are u- 
niverfally known. At the breaking out of that rebellion, 
he applied himfelf with zeal to nip it in the bud. He 
fucceflively invited the chieftains to Cnlloden houfe, and 
whilft he delighted them by his coiiverfation and winning 
manners, he fo wrought on them by his perfuafive elo- 
quence, that he was the happy inftrument of keeping thou- 
fands from joining the Pretender's ftandard. His exertions 
at that critical conjunfture, whilft they brought his own 
liberty, and even his life into imminent hazard, involved 
his family in a debt, double to that with which he had 
found it loaded, from his predeceffor's zeal in the fame 
caufe, and amounting together to upwards of L. 30,000 
Sterling. About two thirds of that fum, and lefs than 16 
years purchafe of its proven increafing value, was the al- 
lowance made by Government to the prefent proprietor, 
oil their refumption of this immunity in the year 1786. —

inhabitants of this parifli, have led to this fliort account of 
Its origin, and of the fervices bj which it was earned. 

Upon the extindion of this right, many of the people, 
being deprived of employment, were obliged to feek elfe- 
where for that fuppoi t, which they had na expedlation 
that the place could any longer afford j and in a little time 
thereafter, the inhabitants of the parilh were found to 
have decreafed fome hundreds in number. Few of them 
however, left the kingdom ; their fuppofed fuperior Ikill, 
in the bufinefs to which they had been inured, occafioned 
a demand of hands from Ferrintolli, wherever diililleries 
were erected under the new adl of Parliament, refpedting 
that branch of revenue, which took place about the fame 
time with the deprivation of their privilege. This de- 
creafe of inhabitants ceafed, however, in the courfe of two 
or three years after the event to whkh it had been ow- 
ing. Since that time, the population of the place has been 
uniformly advancing, and amounts at prefent to little flaort 
of what it has been at any former period. The extent to 
which their original occupation, though ftripped of its for- 
mer advantages, h now again carried on, partly occafions 
this returning increafe of the population ; but it is owing, 
in a ffill greater degree, to that attachment to the natak 
folum, which induces the poor people, to fettle in the 
moor grounds in the Ikirts of the pariih, rather th^n to 
leek for fubfiftence by emigration, and becaufe the pro- 
prietors are beginning to fee, (what, it is to be hoped, 
they will fee ftill more), the good policy of giving them 
all due encouragemeht in their little improvements. But 
It was n6t folely the population of the parilh, that was af- 
feded by Government's refuming the Ferrintofti privilege. 
The people of that diftrift, who eonftitute the great body 
of the parim, underwent in general a great deterioration, 
as to their circumflances and mode of living, from that 

event, 



of Urqiihart.

tvent, agamft which few of them comparatively had made 
any provifion. The monopoly they enjoyed, and the ac- 
knowledged fuperiority of the fpirits produced from their 
fmall ftills, occafioned a demand for them from all quarters, 
and a conftant circulation of cafh in the place, which brought 
the people in general an eafe in their circumftances, and 
a fulnefs of the neceflaries of life, beyond what commonly 
falls to the clafs of farmers. A tranfition in thefe refpefts 
to the level of their neighbours, fo abrupt, would have 
been more feverely felt, had it not found fome mitigation 
in the diftinguifhed humanity of the proprietor of thefe 
lands. But the bufinefs of diftillation is now refumed in 
Ferrintofli, and diffufed throughout the parifli in general, 
to an extent that requires a very confiderable annual im- 
portation of barley, and gives employment to 29 licenfed 
ftills. There are, however, very few who derive from it 
any benefit ; but the mifchief refulting from it is mani- 
feft ; and there is too much caufe to apprehend, from the 
low price of fpirits, and the reftriclion as to a foreign mar- 
ket, that the country in general may furnifh multiplied in- 
ftances of the pernicious tendency of this trade, as an inlet 
to intemperance, and a bane to the induftry and morals of 
the people. 

Rent, Churclj, Schools, 'iJc. — The valued rent of the pa- 
rifti is L. 301 1 Scotch. The real rent, exclufive of the fal- 
mon fiftiing on the water of Conan, is fuppofed to be up- 
wards of L. 2000 Sterling. Mr Forbes of Culloden is pa- 
tron of the parifh. The minifter's ftipend is paid partly in 
viftual and partly in money 5 of the former, five chalders 
of barley, and one of meal ; of the latter, 600 merks, with 
100 more for communion elements. Befides the glebe in 
the neighbourhood of the manfe, there is another adjacent 
to the ruins of the old churcli of Loggy, and within the

improvements at Conan-fide, the proprietors of which place 
have farmed it for a feries of years pail. 1 he manfe was 
built in the year 1777. The prefent church has been re- 
cently condemned, as unworthy of reparation, and a new- 
one is begun to be built in a different and more eligible 
lituation ; for which, and a wall to inclofe it, a fum of 
L. 580 Sterling is allotted. Befides the parochial fchool, 
there are two others, in the more remote diftrifts of the pa- 
rifli, eftabliftied by the Society for propagating Chriftian 
Knowledge, and to the fupport of which, the refpeftive ' 
proprietors laudably contribute. All thefe fchools, for a 
great part of the year, are pumeroufly attended, and pro^ 
dudlive of the moft beneficial confequences, in diifufing a- 
mong the people religious inftruftion, and civilization of | 
manners. j 

FarmSy Produce, ti'c.— -The farms in this parlfh are fmall, . j 
paying, at a medium, it is fuppofed, about 18 bolls, or nearly \ 
that value, between money and vidual. After payment of | 
N the rent, the fubfiftence they yield to the tenant is extremely 
fcanty. Tradefmen and day-labourers occupy a great many 
crofts, or fmaller poflelTions, which pay from a few fhinings 
to L. 2. of rent. There are, however, a few farms in the 
pariCh, of confiderable extent, and of w^hich the poffelTors 
enjoy more favourable circurpftances. Some of thefe are 
furnifhed with cattle of large fize, and implements for huf- 
bandry of a correfpondent good quality. Very little of 
the ground has been inclofed. The crops commonly raifed 
are barley, oats, and potatoes, with fome peafe and rye. 
No wheat, and but an inconfxderable quantity of^grafs 
feeds, are fown in this parifli. The horfes ufed here are 
generally of a fmall fize. The black cattle are of rather 
better quality. The flieep are inconfxderable in number, 
and of the common Scotch breed. 

Freejlone, 



of Urquhart. 



213 



Freejlone, Fijhiiig, ^c— Through a great part of the 
parifh, along the fea, and the rivulets running into it, quar- 
ries of freeftone abound, which fupply the country around 
in millftones, and from whence other hewn work is occa- 
fionally fent by boats acrofs the frith. There is a falmon 
filhing belonging to the Cromarty eftate, on the water of 
Conan, from whence the fifli are fent to Invernefs, to be 
{hipped for London, Except the few hands employed 
ibout the fifli, nets and coops, at that place, there are no 
Elhermen belonging to this parilh; nor are any fiflx worth 
mentioning to be found elfewhere on this fliore, except an 
mconfiderable quantity of falmon, and fmall fifli of differ- 
ent kinds, in a wear belonging to the Ferrintofli eftate. 

Fuel. — This parifh is very ill fupplied with fuel. Thofc, 
whofe circumftances can afford it, make ufe of coals ; but 
the bulk of the inhabitants have no other fire, but what 
the furface of the moor furnifties them with, or what they 
can procure from moffes of a light unfubftantial quality, at 
the diftance of 2 or 3 miles, and at a great expence of time 
and labour. Such as are engaged in the bufinefs ot diftil- 
ling, ufe partly coal, but chiefly peats got from other pa- 
rifhes, on each fide of the frith, and at high prices. 

Poor. — In this populous parifh the poor are very nume- 
rous. The number of them on the kirk-feflion's lift com- 
monly exceeds 3100. The funds allotted for their relief, 
being partly of a fludluating nature, cannot be afcertained 
with precifion. They admit, however, one year with an- 
other, after payment of falaries to the feffion-clerk, and 
other parlfli officers, of a diftribution among the poor, of a- 
bout L.23 or L. 24 Sterling annually. The general and fevere 
fcarcity, of the years 1783 and 1784, called for a more un-

reftrained ufe of their funds ; and for thcfe two years their 
ufual allowance was nearly doubled *. 

Language, Antiquities, ISc. — Gaelic is the language com- 
monly fpoken, and univerfally underftood in this parifti. 
The Englifli is, however, underftood by a great many of 
the inhabitants. Public divine fervice is performed in 
both languages. The names of places throughout the pa- 
rifli are evidently of Gaelic origin At the S. W. extre- 
mity of the parifli, in an cxtenfive high but level moor, 
there are feveral tumuli, or large conical heaps of ftones. 
There is not any tradition as to the particular occafion of 
coUefting them. By the directions of the proprietor, one 
of them was lately laid open, when 3 ftone coffins were 
found in it, ranged in a line from eaft to weft f . 

l^erries, 

* There being no manufaaures, (that of grain into fpir its excepted), 
eftabliflied in this place, nor improvements going on in it of any con- 
fideration, together with other circuraftances, occafions the number of oyr' 
poor being fo great. There arc, however, very few places in this coun- 
try, into which manufaftures, that would afford general employment to 
people of different ages, and of both fexcs, could be introduced, with fuch 
profpeft of advantage, or bid fairer forrefcuing numbers from the penury 
and dirtrefs, in which they languifli at prefent, from want of employment. 
Befides inducements of a more important nature for fuch an eftabliftiment, 
there are buildings, which, during the exiftcnce of the Ferrintofh privilege, 
were ere£led by a company for the purpofe of diftilling, and now lie un- 
occupied. They are of very confiderable extent, fituated about the middle 
of the parifli, and contiguous to the fhore, where there is occafionally a 
depth of water, fufficient for veflels of 100 tuns burden. 

f As to climate, ivages of fervants, prices of promftons, and feveral 
other objefts of a ftatiftical nature, there is nothing peculiar to be ob- 
ferved with regard to this parilh, or different from the accounts already 
prefented to the publit from other parifhes in the neighbourhood ; only 
^is to the laft of thcfe articles, and mercantile goods in general, a confi- 
derable additional expence, and much inconvenience are incurred in this 

place. 



of Urqubart. 



Ferries, i^c. — There are two or three ferries In this pa- 
rifli, one of them is at its eaftern extremity and oppofite to 
Fowlis, from whence it has its name. This is not a much 
frequented ferry, and is incommodious at low water, from 
the ihallownefs of the fliore. Towards the weft end of the 
parilli on the river of Conan, and beyond where the tide 
at any time flows, is the ferry of Scuddalc, on the poft 
road from Beauly to Dingwall. Befides thefe ferries, there is 
a fmall boat for foot paflengers, which, at high water, plies 
between Dingwall and Ferrintoftx. On the tide's retiring, 
and when the river is not high, there is accefs to Dingwall 
from this fide of the water by different fords. Some of 
thefe fords have a zig-zag direction, which they retain a- 
midft partial variations, to which all of them are very 
fubjeft, from the united force of high tides, and frequent 
fwellings of the river. Thefe circumftances, together with 
the rapid flowing of the tide at particular times, render this 
a hazardous paiTage, which proves fatal to many. Since 
the fettlement of the prefent minifter, in 1774, fcarce a year 
has paffed vvathout the lofs of fome life on it. Some years 
it has brought 2, 3, or more, to an untimely end. With- 
in the courfe of 14 months, about 8 years ago, 7 perfons 
periflied in croffing the water of Conan, at different places 
within the limits of this parifli. Humanity ftrongly folicits 
the long promifed public aid, for erecting a bridge on a 

river, 

place, from not having accefs to either Invcrnefi or Dingwall, (the only- 
towns which can fupply it in thefe articles), without the intervention of a 
ferry. Its fituation with regard to a poft-ofSce is fubjcft to the fame in- 
convenience, and occafions a heavy drawback on the pleafure of public 
intelligence and private correfpondence. From the great number of in-

river, in which the hopes and fupports of many families 
have fallen by a premature fate. 

CharaBer. — Whilft the people of this parilh enjoyed 
peculiar advantages, as to their external fituation, their 
character was ftrongly marked, by a correfpondent hofpi- 
tality of difpofition, and liberality to thofe in diftrefs. 
Though,, as to the generality, their ability is now circum- 
fcribed, the fame difpolitions ftill prevail, and are ready 
to fliow themfelves by fuitable exertions on every proper 
occalion. Every general coUeftion, for any charitable pur- 
pofe, vindicates their title to this praife. The people, in 
general, are very regular in their attendance on public 
worfliip ; nor are there DilTenters in the parilh of any de- 
nomination, except fome Epilcopalians, who live in the 
weftern diftrift, and attend a place of worfliip in a neigh- 
bouring parilh. Populous as this parifh is, there has not 
been an inftance during the time of the prefent incumbent, 
which is 1 8 years, nor long before, to the beft of his know- 
ledge, of an individual belonging to it being guilty of a 
capital offence, or even fufFering banifliment. This happy 
exemption from criminal profecutions, and thefe favoura:ble 
traits of charaSer, are owing, in a very confiderable de- 
gree, to the advantages which this parifh has long enjoyed,, 
for the education of its youth *. The early eflablifhment of " 
a fchool in it, by the Society for propagating Chriflian 
Knowledge, at which, for a long traft of years, about loo 
children, (befides thofe enjoying fimilar advantages at the 
parochial fchool), have annually received inflru6tion in the 
great duties of religion and morality, as well as the firfl 

principles

principles of literature, could hardly fail. In fuch a courfe of 
time, to have a happy influence on the charafter and man- 
riers 'of the people. From the recetit extenfion of the fame 
advantages by that excellent inftitution, in confideration of 
the extreme populoufnefs of this parifh, to its weftern and 
moft remote diftrift, fimilar good effefts are expefted. And 
much room, it mull be confeffed, there ftill remains with 
us, for advancement in that purity of manners, of which 
"the principles of Chriflianity, when duly inculcated and 
received, muft ever be produaive.

Name, Situation, Soil and Clijnate, ISc. 

npHE ancient name of this parilli was Strathdightj/, 
being part of that pleafant ftrath, through which 
Dighty direfts its courfe to the frith of Tay. The pre- 
fent .name is Mains of Fintrj, from the old family feat of 
Fintry, which is near the church. It belongs to the pref- 
bytery of Dundee, and fynod of Angus and Mearns. It is 
4 iniles long, and 3 broad about the middle ; but becomes con- 
hdei-ably narrower toward the extremities. The water of 
Dighty, which runs from weft to eaft, interfeds the parifli 
into nearly two equal parts ; and from the banks of this beau- 
tiful ftream, the ground rifes gently to the north and fouth. 
The face of the country has a fweet and delightful appear- 
ance, bemg all inclofed with thorn hedges, which are in a 
very flouriflaing ftate. They fhelter and beautify the 
fields; but at the fame time attrad great flocks of birds,

which deftroy much of the grain. There is alfo a good 
Tjumber of large oak and afti trees, and fome thriving 
plantations in the parifli. The foil in the haughs is a deep 
loam, and produces excellent crops. The reft of the pa- 
rifli, with, fome little exce;ption, is a pretty deep mould 
upon till, . and is very iertUer The air is dry and falubri- 
0U3, there being no ftaghated water in the 'parifti. Hence 
;here are no epidemical or topical dileafes, and the people 
m general enjoy very-good health ; only they are now and 
then viiited by confumptions and fevers. 

Population.— Yxom the regifter of baptifms, this parifli 
appears to have been much more populous 80 years ago 
than at preferit. At that period, the number of fouls was 
above 1200. In the year 1768, ircontained only 660. This 
decreafe was occafioned hy ejefting the fubtenants, and en- 
larging the farms ; and from the. people removing into the 
neighbouriag town of Dundee, where employment was more 
eafily procured. It is now increafing very rapidly, from 
the encouragement given to"labourers, and from the ama- 
zing number of hands employed in bleaching, and other ma- 
nufa6lures carried on upon the water of Dighty. Hence, in 
the year 1790, the number of foula was found to be 878, 
which is confiderabiy greater than it was 40 years ago.

Church, School, Poor, fee—The King is patron of the 
(jving of Mains. The ftipend is worth about L. 90. The 
-hurch feems originally to have been a Roman Catholic 
hapel, as the fount is yet to be feen, and a fmall 
piefs in the wall, with an iron door, in which perhaps 
were depofited fome of their facred relics. It is very an- 
cient, and, though it lately received fome repairs, is ftill 
hi a ruinous condition. The manfe * was built in 1760, 
jnd, though not a large houfe, is very fufficient and com- 
modious. The poor are all maintained in their own hoii- 
les; their funds arife from the colle6lions on Sabbath, 
which may be about L. 10 per annum, from the produce 

of 

• There is an old caftle near the manfe of great antiquity. It was 
built in the year 1311, but by whom is uncertain. It was for a great fe- 
ries of years, the property and refidencc of the Grahams of Fintry. The 
buildings are in the form of a fquare, with a flrong tower in the front. 
There is only one principal gate, which is towards the weft. It has a good 
deal of out-works, and feems to have been a place of cbnfiderablc ftrength. 
Tradition relates, that during the feudal fyftem, its proprietors maintain- 
ed almoft a conftant war with the family of Powrie, another ftrgng hold 
in the neighbouring parifli. Above the principal gate there is a paflage, 
which feems to have been defigned for the inhabitants to pour down boil- 
ing water, or ftones, or any other offenfive materials, upon theiraflailants 
when they attempted to force it. This old caftle ftands upon a pretty 
fteep bank of a fmall rivulet, which feparates it from the minifter's garden. 
It is furrounded with very high trees, which, when covered with foliage, 
almoft conceal it ; and the chimney heads appearing over their tops, with 
here and there a peep of the old ruins, have a very pidlurefque appearance 
from the windows of the manfe. The foundations of the old caftle, one 
of the proprietors of which (viz. Claverhoufe) diftinguifhed himfelf in 
perfecuting the Prcfbyterians, under Charles II. were lately dug up by a 
farmer. There appeared to have been a Popifh chapel belonging to the 
houfe, as the fount, altar piece, &amp;c. were difcovered. There are in the 
church yard two ftone coffins, of about two and a half feet deep, which 
confift of four large ftones, fecured at the corners with bars of iron. Tra- 
dition relates, that the plague once raged in this parilh, and that the bo- 
dies of fome of the unhappy fufFerers were there inclofed.

fchoolmafters ought not to be negledted. 

^Agriculture, and , Produce. — Land here , is rifing in. its 
value, and is generally: ., fold at 28. ,or 30 years pur- 
chafe. The ufual rent*' is 30 s. jftf^r-iacre at an average. 
Xhey b^gin to fow about the latter end of March, aM i-eap 
in the months of September and October. The rotation 9f 
crops is 3 of grafs, i of oats,' and i of barley ; then a green 
crop, followed by a crop of oats, or barley fown with grafs 
feeds. Sometimes, inftead of the green crop, the land is 
fummer fallowed, and fowii .with wheat ; after which the ■ 
ground is manured, and a crop of o^ts or. barley , taken. 
The farmers find the artificial grafles to be very profitable, as 
they fell very high, either on the ground or when turned 
into hay. It is very cornmon to receive L. 5 the acre for 
rye-grafs and clover uncut, and 8 d. the ftone when cut and 
dried. The cultivation of turnips, too, amply recompences

the hufbandman, whether he fells them on the ground, 
or feeds cattle with them ; and he fcarcely ever fails to have 

0 o-ood crop of barley after this valuable root. Some of the 
farmers alfo raife a few yams, which are good feeding for 
horfes, given raw, for they are not fit for boiling. The 
potatoes alfo thrive here pretty well, but they are generally 

J planted too thick in the drills, which are too near each 
Dlher. The drills lliould be always fo far feparate, as to 
lUow the plough to get up amongfl: them, to lay to or take 
away the earth, as may feem neceflary. The farmers feem 
n erfe to fowingof flax, as they think their ground notproper 
it ; it would furely be a very valuable crop if it could 
•jc raifed,as there are fo many Jinen manufaftures carried on 
lere. But of this the farmers, who underftand their bufi- 
^efs very well, are the bell judges. The horfes are almoft 
ill employed in huibandry. They are generally ftout, 
'veil made, and of a good lize. The black cattle are of a 

1 ,iddle lize, about that of the Galloway breed. There are 

ew cows, however, approximating to the large Englifli 
and. Many more calves are produced than can be reared, 
rience they are fattened and fold to the butchers in Dun- 
lee ; but it would, perhaps, be a more profitable plan, if 
he farmers could afford to keep them, till they were 3 or 4 
^ears old, and tlien fell them to the graziers. There is lit- 
le or no cheefe made in the parilli. Much more emolu- 
ncnt arifes from felling the milk in Dundee. 

Minerals, Fuel, %£c. — There are freeftone and Hate quarries 
11 the parilli. Some years ago there was a mineral fpring, 
vhich was reckoned medicinal, and frequented by many 
ocople, who received much benefit from it ; but its fource 
Jeing covered by the building of a bridge, it has difappear- 
■ d for fome time paft. The only fuel now made ufe of 
'f^re is coals, brought by Water from different parts of Fife.

They coft at the fliore 6 1 d. per cwt. Here they are frefc 
of duty, but this is a burden feverely felt by many othei 
parts of the country. It is much againft the increafe anc 
profperity of manufadures, and fbould be removed by thi 
Legiflature. 

Advantages, £5'^.— This parifti being fituated near Dundee 
finds a ready market for every article the inhabitants hav( 
to fell ; who can, with equal eafe, procure any thing the; 
want from that town. The farmers have plenty of ma 
nure from it, and being fo near the fhore, the lime is pret 
ty reafonable; which, with dung, anfwers all the purpofe 
of manure. This parifh alfo poffefles advantages over fe 
veral places of the country in point of climate. Non 
of it lying very high, (being moftly dry and ftieltered witl: 
hedges) they have their harveft more early, and do notruiii 
fuch a rilk of lofing the crop by fliaking winds or earl :i 
frofts. And in an exigence, plenty of hands can always 
got from Dundee to cut down the crops fpeedily. Man; 
of the people look upon it as a great inconvenience, to pa 
toll, when they fcarcely touch upon the turnpike, and whil 
their own bye-roads are almoft impaffable ; but it is to b 
hoped this difadvantage will foon be removed. 

A 

Ma7tu/aau}'es.—Dighty, the only nver m the panll 
drives more machinery for its fize than, perhaps, any wate . 
in Britain; every fall upon it turns a mill; fo tha 
within this parifh, though not above 4 miles in lengtl 
there are no fewer than 33 mills erefted for different pui 
pofes. There are feveral corn mills, barley mills, an; 
mills for wafhing and cleaning yarn. There is one erefi " 
ing at prefent for fpinning flax, upon a capital of L. 400c 
which, it is fuppofed, will give bread to a great numbt 
of both young and old people, and bring confiderable emi 
laments to the proprietors ; one frame is already up, b

which they have had a fpecimen of the work. They fpin 
ivith amazing quicknefs, and make very good yarn, only 
as it is drawn out dry, it appears rough. This might, 
iierhaps, be obviated, if they could fall upon any method 
of wetting the flax while it is fpinuing, which would ren- 
der the cloth more fmooth, and give it a finer appearance. 
There are nine bleachfields in the parilli, three of which 
ire carried on up'bn a very large fcale. They bleach a 
greac quantity of coarfe cloths, which they call Soldier's 
forking and Ofnaburgs,' moft of which they export. This 
demand for yarn and cloth, alFords a profitable employment 
to the women in this -place, who, as they fpin with both 
hands, can eafily make 8 d. a-day. There are alfo upon 
the water of Dighty, a wauk mill and a fnuff mill. In 
fhorf, a perfon has only to come to this water to fee the 
happy efFeas of induftry and manufaaures, and to what a 
height they may be carried. While the manufaaarer en- 
riches him.felf, he does a real benefit to fociety,.by employing 
thofe hands, whomuft have either become burdens upon the 
public by a&amp;ing charity, or nuifances by worfe praaices. 

aaraaer.—ThQ inhabitants of this parilli are of an or- 
dinary fize, and generally ftout and well proportioned. 
They are humane, induftrious, well difpofed, and, in gene- 
ral, regular in their attendance upon the ordinances of reli- 
gion. They enjoy the comforts of life to a confiderable de- 
gree, and, though they are by no means niggardly, are pru- 
dently economical, and contented with their circumftances. 
The young men do not feem much inclined either to the army 
or the navy. A few of them, however, have made choice 
of a feafaring life. Though there are 3 petty public houfes 
in the parifli, that fell ale and whifliy, ytt they have no- 
bad efF^a upon the m.orals of the people. There have been

to obferve the progrefs of manners in the fpace of 30 years, 
the following comparifon is added, between the ftate of this 
parifti in 1760 and in 1790, in fundry particulars. 

CoMFARATIVE STATEMENT of the pariJJj in 1760 and

In 1760, Land was plowed with 
oxen : only a few horfes were 
kept to draw the harrow in 
feed time, and bring in the 
common harveft. L. 7 was 
thought a great price for a

were merry over it without any 
ceremony. 

In 1760, Beef and mutton were 
2 d. per lb. ; butter 5 d. fcr lb. ; 
cheefe as. 6 d. per Hone, and

often ; a few neighbours are in- 
vited to one houfe to dinner ; 
fix or feven difhes are fet on the 
table, elegantly drefled ; after 
dinner a large bowl of rum 
punch is drunk ; then tea ; again 
another bTwl ; after that fiipper, 
and what they call the grace 
drink.

By the Rev. Mr John Davidson, 
Minifler of the ParifJj.</head> 


<p>
Origin of the Name. 

■J/" Irk or Kil-patrick takes its name from St Patrick, 
the tutelar faint of Ireland, who, tradition fays, was 
a native of the parifh. There are many circumftances fa- 
vouring this tradition ; though Mr O'Halloran, an Irifh 
writer, fuppofes that he was rather a native of Wales. In 
a burying place in the church yard, there is a ftone of 
great antiquity, with a figure faid to be that of St Patrick 
upon it ; and fome go fo far as to alTert, that he was bu- 
ried under it. In the river Clyde, oppofite to the church, 
there is a large ftone or rock, vilible at low water, called 
St Patrick's ftone ; and Pennant fays, " Ireland will fcarce 
" forgive me if I am filent about the birth-place of its tu- 
«' telar faint. He firft drew breath at Kirkpatrick, and 
" derived his name from his father, a noble Roman, (a

Statljlteal Account 



Situation, Extent, Soil, i^c. — The parifli is beautifully 
fituatcd upon the river Clyde, in the Prefbytcry of Dunv. 
barton, and Synod of Glafgow and Ayr. The church ftands 
near the turnpike road, 10 miles below Glafgow. Before , 
the disjunftion of New Kilpatrick, the parifli was of great 
extent. It is Hill, however, larger than the ordinary fuc - 
of parifties in this part of the country, being about 8 miles 
long, and, in fome places, from 3 to 4 miles broad. The 
foil of the arable part of the parifli is generally thin, fan- 
dy, or gravellifli ; but it is in fome places clay, and in o- 
thers clay with a till bottom. The furface of the low 
part of the diflri^t, towards Clyde, is rather plain and le- 
vel ; the north part is hilly and mountainous, and in many -. 
places covered with heath and wood. 

Rivers, Hills and ProfpeBs. — The principal river is tho 
Clyde, and it is the boundary of the parifli upon the fouth. 
It abounds with falmon, fmelts and trouts, which are 
caught in great plenty ; and herrings have been taken, as 
.high up the river as Lord Sempill's houfe, about a mile 
above the church. There are feveral fmaller rivulets, I 
which, as will be afterwards dliown, have added very 
much, by the number of vporks erefted upon them, both 
to the wealth and population of the parifh. From tl-. 
hills above the church, which are continuations of the 
Grampians, and from one in particular, called Dumbucks, 
there are excellent difl:ant views, terminated on the one 
hand by the lofty mountains of Arran, with their beads 
fometimes above the clouds, and on the other, by the : 
foaring top of Benlomond. From the Chapel hill, the. 
property of the family of Blantyre, and from Dalnotter : 
hill, the property of the Lord Prefident, both fituated up-- 
on the turnpike road from Glafgow to Dumbarton, with- 
in half a mile of the churrh, the obferver is delighted 
with the variety of the fcenery, and xichnefs of the pro-

jpeft. The banks of fo fine a river as the Clyde, the 
ftriking figure of Dumbarton caftle, the wonderful divi- 
fion in the ridge of mountains above Bouling Bay, and the 
numerous woods,— all unite in rendering this profpedl per- 
haps one of the beft in Scotland. Mr Farrington, Royal 
f\cademiciaQ of London, fome years ago was employed to 
:ake different views upon the rivers Forth and Clyde. He 
3 a man of eminence in his profeflion, and the view from 
Dalnotter hill is fuppofed by many to be the beft of the 
;olle6lion. 

Climate and Difeafes. — The climate is mild and temperate, 
ihough, as is the cafe upon all the weft coaft of Scotland, 
; ery rainy at fome feafons of the year. No epidemical 
lifeafe, however, prevails among the inhabit^mts. They 
c generally healthy, and though inftances of extreme lon- 
.evity cannot be produced, yet a man of the name of Da- 
'iiiel Montgomery, belonging to the parifh, died within 
faefe 2 years at the well authenticated age of 93 ; and du- 
ring the incumbency of the prefent minifter, he has known 
oi^iany perfons of both fexes live to the age of 85. 

Proprietors and Rents. — There are about 33 heritors, 
preat and fmall, in the parifh, the principal of whom are 
Lord Blantyre, the Lord Prefident, Sir Archibald Edmon- 
ftone, Mr Hamilton of Barns, Mr Buchaiun of Auchintor- 
y, Mr Stirling of Law, Mifs Buchanan of Aachmtoihan, 
and Mr Dreghorn of Ruchill. The valued rent of the parifh 
is L. 4441 : 13 : 8 Scotch. The real rent is about L. 5000 
Sterling. Almoft all the arable lands in the pari lb are in- 
clofed and fubdivided. The average rent of arable land, in 
Ihe low part of the parifh, is from 20 s. to 30 s.per acre. 

Cultivation, 



232 Statijiicai Account 

Cultivation. — When the prefent incumbent became 
nifter of the parifli in the 1745, the ftate of agriculture was 
moft wretched. The rent of arable land, even in the low 
part of the parifli, at an average, did not exceed from 25, 
6d. to 7 s. 6d. an acre. The diflinftion of outfield and 
infield, or croft land, univerfally prevailed. There 
were few or no inclofures, and the tenants were miferably , 
accommodated with houfes. The croft land, though every , 
year ploughed, produced little crop. There were no carts in 
the parifli. The difference is now wonderful. In few 
parts of the country are the farmers in a more profperous 
fituation, the rents better paid, or the beft mode of cultiva- 
ting the foil better underftood. In general, the tenants oT., 
ferve ftriftly the following method : They never have above 
a third of their farm in tillage at a time. They take but 
two crops of grain and one of hay from that tliird, and it is 
never broke up again till it remains in pafture grafs 3 or 4 
years. To this is to be afcribed the flourifhing ftate of the 
tenants*. Their grounds being thus treated, and wtil 

dunged 

« Tills change tosk place about 2o years ago. The example was fet 
by fume of the principal he. itors, who were at great pains and expence to 
introduce it, and it is now becoming general over the parift. The method 
purfiied with fo much effedt by the heritors, was either to furamer-fallo^^r 
and improve their eftates themfelves. and then let them out ii lea'.e ; or, 
where they were f. large as not to admit ol this, to let out the parts 
which they had not fu'nmer-fall'owed. allowing the tenant a dcduaion of

their former fyftem of cultivation, and they continue in the new courfe, 
the beneficial confcquences of which are abundantly felt. They bring.!

(tiuftion of outfield and infield is totally fupprefled. Carts 
ire univerfally ufed. Convenient and centrical farm hou- 
fes are built upon aim oft every farm, many of them flated. 

Produce arid Cattle. — The crops raifed are corn, bear, 
barley, wheat, peafe and potatoes ; and there are ready mar- 
kets for all thefe, either at the different villages and works 
in the parifli, or at Glafgow. The horfes and black catlle 
in this diftrift are of the beft kinds. Several of the tenants 
rear them. On the grounds of the upper part of the parilh, 
great numbers of cattle and flieep are paflured. The hills 
of Cockney always produce remarkably fat cattle and Iheep. 
Better feldom appear in the Glafgow or Paifley markets. 

ManufaElures. — This pariih,frora its local advantages, (ha- 
zing a great many falls of water, ifluing from the high 
' ounds,) from its good roads, and its vicinity to Glafgow, 
3 full of different manufaftories, all of which are in a thri- 
ving fituation, and employ at high wages a very great 
number of people *. To give the reader an idea of the num-

is clay, 3 and 4 horfes are thought neceflary. As all perfonal fervices arc 
juftly confidered as deftruaive, they have been neceflariiy aboliHied in a 
part of the country where agriculture has arrived to fo high a pitch of 
perfedlion. Thirlage, however, and mill fervices, ftill remain. But 
thefe, it is hoped, will foon alfo be fupprcfTed. Even ftatutc-Iabour. 
Inown in almoft every county in Seotland, is here converted into money. 

* The prices of labour and provifioris, in this and in all the parifl:es ad- 
joining tu Glafgow, are regulated in a great mealurc by Glafj-.ow. As 
thefe have been detailed by fome of the clergy in the neighbourhood, it 
is thought unnecelFary to repeat the particulars here. In general, ic may 
only be obferved, that they hear a proportiun to one another, and that all 
ranks and degrees oi pei Ions in the parifh arc now mnrh more wealthy, 
and in a much more profperous fituation, in every refpefl, than their ance-

One of the printfields pays a weekly duty of near L. 200 
Sterling to Government, and is fuppofed to be the fourth 
or fifth largeft in Scotland. The works and machinery of 
the wool mill are complete for making and finilliing 1000 
yards of cloth a-4ay, which requires 1200 lb. of wool. 

Roads and 5 rzV/^«.— Thirty years ago there were no paf- 

fable roads for carriages in the parifli, owing to the want of 

bridges, for, in floods, the rivulets were unfordable. Even the 

great road from Glafgow to Dumbarton, which communi- ■: 

cates with the Weft Highlands, was at times in the like fitua- -I 

tion. About 10 years ago, the Duke of Argyle, Lord Frede- I 

rick Campbell, and Sir Archibald Edmonftone, in the moft 

patriotic manner, undertook to make the part of the high 

road, from the Eaft confines of the parifti, to the town of 

Dumbarton, aftretch of 8 miles, and to take their chance of 

the tolls for indemnification, which, at the time, was a.

very uncertain fecurity. The road was accordingly foon 
made in the complctcll manner ; and thefe gentlemen have 
now the fatisfadion of having conferred a lafting advantage 
on the country ; while, from the increafe of the manu- 
fadures of Glafgow, and the number of travellers, the tm n- 
pike duties have repaid their advance of money. As thefe du- 
ties are nowperfedly fufficient to fupport the road,independ- 
ent of the ftatute money, the latter is applied to the other 
roads in the pariOi, which, owing to the good management 
of a refiding heritor, who takes charge of the application, 
are all likewife in good order. The ftatute money of the 
parifli amounts to L. 63 : 6 : 8 Sterling yearly, and is upon 
the increafe. It is raifed by an afleffment of 18 s. Sterling 
upon each L. 100 Scotch of valued rent, and of 2 s. Sterling 
upon each houfeholder. Good roads ftiould be the firft ob- 
jed of improvement in every coi;ntry. It is to their being 
fo good in this parifli, that a great part of its profperity 
may be afcribed. 

Ferry. — The ferry of Erflcine, almoft oppoilte to the 
church, is the communication for foot paffengers, horfes, 
and carriages, acrofs the river in this part of the country. 
The quays have lately been removed to more proper fitua- 
tions, and it is now a very convenient and ufeful ferry. 

Church, — The church is a very ancient building, and was 
formerly a branch of the abbacy of Paifley. The ftipend 
is 89 bolls .2 firlots i peck 1 lippies of meal, and L. 45, 
13 s. 4d. Sterling of money, including L. 4 : 3 : 4 Sterling 
for furnifliing communion elements. The manfe is plea- 
fant and commodious \ and, fince an exchange with the fa- 
mily of Blantyre, who very liberally made a confiderable 
addition to the glebe, it is now a. very good one, confifting

P opulattofi, — From fin accurate account taken in fummer 
1792, the number of fouls, including thofe employed at the 
public works, but exclufive of the 280 non-refident perfons, 
are, 

Males above 8 years of age, - • . 961 

Males below 8 years of age, - - 265 

Females above 8 years of age, - 9^3

In whole, 245a 
In Dr Webfler's report in 1735, parifli is 

faid to have contained 128 i fouls, - 1281 



Increafe, 11 71 

This important increafe of inhabitants is, in a great mea- 
fure to be attributed to the number of works carried on 
in the parifh, and the great influx of people which they heve 
occafioned ; for the number of inhabitants, independent of 
the works, has not increafed in a great degree, the number 
now being only 1409 fouls, whereas, in 1755, there were 
1281 ; an increafe of only 128. 

Poor. — The poor in the parifli are few, confidering the 
number of inhabitants, and even thefe conlifl of old or difea- 
fed people who are unable to work ; for it has been obfer- 
ved, that none but the truly necefiitous ever defire to re- 
ceive public charity. In this part of the country, the peo- 
ple have a proper pride, and jire naturally averfe at coming 
(as they call it) upon the poor's box. There have never, 
therefore, been any alTelTments for the poor. They are 
fupplied out of the colledlions at the church door, and from

the ftock of the poor's fund ; but, owing to the few refiding 
heritors in the parilh, and a degree of fanaticifm among 
fome of the lower fort of people, which takes them to other 
meetings than the Eftabliflied Church, the colleftion at the 
church door is lefs now than formerly, and it is to be feared 
that an afleffment may foon be neceflary, which, wherever 
it takes place, is attended with many pernicious confe- 
quences *. 

Minerals. — In feveral parts of the parilh, there are coal 

■ and lime pits which have been wrought, and at prefent 
there is one coal work going. Freeftone in great quanti- 
ties is to be found in many places, fome of it of an excel- 
lent quality for building. The ftones ufed in building the 
fea-locks at Bowling Bay, and many of the bridges upon 
the weft end of the canal, were taken from the eftate of 
Mifs Buchanan of Auchintofhan, and are conlidered to be 
pf the beft kind of freeftone. 

Antiquities. — The Roman wall, (or, as it is commonly 
called, Graham's dike, from a tradition, that a Scottilh 
warrior of that name firft broke over it,) between the 
Forth and Clyde, which was firft marked out by Agricola, 
and completed by Antoninus Pius, and which terminated

• Under this article, the minifter is happy in having an opportunity of 

■ 4( ing juftice to the proprietors of the numerous works. While they have 
^dded, in a great degree, to the wealth and populati m of the parifli, he 
can fafely fay, that in no inftance have they increafed the number of poor. 
Their poor are uniformly fuppurted from funds eftablifhed among them- 
fclves. At feveral of the works, weekly colledions are made by the work- 
men, which are accumulated into a capital, and, by the judicinus ma- 
nagement of the proprietors, they are thereby enabled, not only to main- 
tain their poor, but alfo to employ furgeons and frhoolmaders for the ba- 
ndit of the workmen and their families ;— a line of condufl highly proper, 
and meritorious, and well worthy the imitation of every mafter manu-' 
faiflurcr.

at Dunglafs * is ftill difcernible in many parts of the pa- 
rifli as are alfo feveral Roman camps in the neighbourhood 
of it, particularly one upon a hill at Duntocher f.— At 
Sandyford, near the village of Kilpatrick, before the road 
was repaired, and before a bridge for horfes and carriages ; 
was built over the burn there, a large ftone, fuppofed to have 
been an obelifk, intended to commemorate fome remarkable 
event, had been taken from near the Roman wall, where, 
it is faid, it had ftood, and was ufed by the country people 
as a bridge for foot paffengers. It is now in the poffeffion

* Dunglafs was once a fite of the Romans, and, in Oliver Cromwell's 
time, a caftle and a place of fome llrength, but was blown up by the trea- 
chery of an Englifh boy. The ruins of fome of the buildings are (till to 
befeen. It was formerly the property of the Colquhouns of l.ufs, who 
likewife enjoyed the whole traft of country from that to Dumbarton, and 
. it at prefent retains their name, being called the Barony of Colquhoun. 
This caftle, however, and the barony have, for many years, been in the 
poffeffion of Sir Archibald Edmonftone's family, and his vaffals. But 
tho^h the family of Lufs have now no property in the parifli, they have 
ftill very large eftates in the county. The maffacre of the Colquhouns by 
the Macgregors in 1602, is an inltance, among many, of the barbarous ftate 
of this country at that time, and occafioned afts of Parliament prohibiting 
any perfon from ufing the name of Macgregor. Thefe adls are now very 
properly repealed. 

t In 1775, a country man in digging a trench upon the declivity of; 
this hill, turned up feveral rery uncommon tyles. The tyles are of 7 dif- 
ferent fizes, the fmalleft being 7 inches, and the largeft 2i inches fquare. 
They are from 2 to 3 inches in thicknefs, of a reddifh colour, and in a con- 
dition perfeaiy found. The lefler ones compofed feveral rows ot pillars,-, 
which formed a labyrinth of paffage s of about 18 inches fquare. and the, 
larger tyles being laid over the whole, formed a floor; above which, when i 
it was difcovered, there lay about two feet deep of earth. The buildios 
was furrounded by a wall of hewn ftone. Various conjeftures have beer 
• made with regard to the nature of thefe remains of antiquity. The mod 
probable is, that it was ufed as Tifudorium, or hot bath, for the ufe of th: 

neighbouring garrifon. ^Near this, there is a Roman bridge, over the 

Duntocher burn ; which, though it has been often repaired, ftill reta;p:

CharaBer. — The people of this parilh may be faid to 
anfwer the general charadler of the Scotch, for they are fo- 
ber, honeft, and induftrious. The demand for workmen 
and artificers is fo great, that there is not an idle perfon to 
be feen. At the wool mill and printfields, great numbers 
of young perfons are conflantly employed, many of them 
below 8 years of age, who earn from 4 d. to 8 d. a-day. 
And, as there are fchoolmafters in the vicinity of all thefe 
works, the youth, when not engaged at their employments, 
go to fchool. In this way their bufinefs and education are 
united, while their morals are not endangered by idlenefs. 
— All the young people of the parifli drefs well. The men 
wear hats and coats of Englifti cloth. The young women 
put on filk and calico gowns, and black caps and cloaks. 
They meet together occafionally, and make merry. Their 
chief amufement is dancing, and upon thefe occafions there 
is a pleafing cheerfulnefs and innocence among them. 

Mifcellaneous OiferDations. — Inoculation is now generally 
praftifed in the parifh, which is a happy circumftance, both 
on account of the popvilation, and the difference it occafions 
in the look of the people. The praftice is not, however, 
of above 30 years ftanding. The minifter was among the 
firft who began it. He tried it with fuccefs in his own fa- 
mily about the year 1 761-2, fince which the cuftom has 
.gradually crept in, and is now univerfal. An inftance of 
the proper and rational conduft of a tenant in the parilli, 
towards his family, may be here mentioned. He has had 
12 children, and he inoculated every one of them. The 
eictenfion of the great canal to Bowling Bay, where it joins 

the 



Statijlical Account 



the Clyde, mufl be attended with very advantageous con- 
fequences to the nation. The number of veflels that fail 
upon it, loaded with all kinds of merchandife, and feme of 
them from fea to fea, is daily increafing. — The hiftory of 
the Bargarran witches, in the neighbouring parifli of Er- 
ikine, is well known to the curious. That this parifh, in the 
dark ages, partook of the fame frenzy, and that innocent per- 
fons were facrificed at the fhrine of cruelty, bigotry, and : 
fuperftition, cannot be concealed. As late as the end of the i 
laft century, a woman was burnt for witchcraft at Sandy- | 
ford, near the village, and the bones of the unfortunate vic- 
tim were lately found at the place. While we review 
with pity and regret, the deplorable fituation of human na- 
ture at that time, we feel a fenfible pleafure in contempla- 
ting the change that has already taken place, which is in- i 
deed highly increafed, by indulging the fond hope, that the | 
period is faft approaching, when all kinds of fuperftition and | 
bigotry, will forever be banilhed, from the face of the earth. " 1

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1018505">CAMBUSLANG</name>, 
(county of LANARK.) 
By the Rev. Dr James Meek.</head> 



<p>Origin of the Na?ue. 

CAmbuslang was anciently called Dnmifargard* ^ 
from a barony, which feems to have comprehended 
the greateft part of the parifli. For feveral centuries, 
however, it has been known by its prefent name ; which 
it appears to have received, from the place where the kirk 
has flood for time immemorial, and from the faint to 
whom it was dedicated. Cam-eas, now changed into Ca- 
mus or Ca?nbus, in the Gaelic language, lignifies a crooked 
torrent or rivulet ; and Lan or Laiimis, now changed into 
lang, was the name of a faint, famous for being the found- 
er of many monafteries f. The prefent kirk, which oc- 
cupies the very fpot where "the old kirk Hood, is fituated 
on the bank of a remarkably rapid and crooked rivulet ; 
and as moft of the kirks were anciently put under the pi o- 
teftion of fome tutelar faint, it is highly probable, that

the firfl: kirk erccled here was dedicated to St Lan or ' 
Launus. 

Situation ond Extent. — Cambuflang is fitiiated in the 
county of Lanark, the Prefbytery of Hamilton, and the 
Synod of Giafgow and Ayr. It is fomething lei's than 3 
miles fquare, and may be ftated as containing about ^,'\ 
fquare miles in fuperficial extent. The kirk, which is 5 
miles S. E. from Giafgow, and 6 miles W. from Hamil- 
ton, is nearer to the N. W. corner, than to any other 
boundary of the parifla. 

Surface ajid Soil, — Thougli beautifully diverfified with 
hill and dale, there are uo high grounds in the parifli, ex- 
cept Dichmount and Turnlea hills, which form a ridge a- 
bout half a mile broad, and extending near two miles from 
E. to W. From this ridge, which is nearer the fouthern 
than the northern fide of the parifli, the ground declines 
gently, and with many beautiful fwellings, to Clyde on 
the N. and to Calder on the S. and E. In fo confider- • 
able a trad of country, there are different kinds of foil. . 
Upon the ridge juft now mentioned, and the adjacent : 
fields, the foil is thin and gravell3% Along the banks of^ 
Clyde, it is partly a light loam, and partly a light fand j . 
but by far the molt common, is a clayey foil, with a till 1 
bottom. 

Rivers, i^c. — Clyde, which bounds this parifh for near : 
3 miles, is from 200 to 250 feet broad. It is a fines 
fl;ream, when fo full of water as to cover the whole chan-- 
nel. Some high fpring tides come up to the confines off 
this parifli ; but in general they do not reach them by ' 
more than a mile. Clyde overflows its banks, at an ave- • 
rage, between three and four times yearly. In floods, the-?

water feldom rifes more thfin 17 feet above the bed of the 
river; but in the flood of 12th March 1^82, the greate 11 re- 
membered, or on record, it rofe 20 feet above the bed of the 
river, and i foot 6 Inches higher than a memorable flood on 
the 24th September 1712. There is only one haugh, con- 
filling of 18 acres of very rich land, liable to be overflow- 
ed Calder water, which is the boundary of this panfli, 
for upwards of 4 niUes, is rapid and Ihallow ; the channel 
about 30 feet broad i but, in its ordinary Hate, never co- 
vered with water. There are feveral rivulets in the pa- 
rifh ; but none of thefe, except one, fo confiderable as to 
merit particular notice. The principal branch of this one 
rifes on the confines of the parifli of Garmannock, and af- 
ter a courfe of more than 3 miles, firft E. and then N. 
falls into Clyde, about 3 quarters of a mile below the 
kirk. It has different names at different places ; but is 
here called the Kirk Burn ; having loll its ancient name, 
which was probably Cam-eas, or the crooked burn. This 
rivulet, for about a mile before it falls into Clyde, is un- 
commonly wild and romantic. Agreeably to its ancient 
name, it makes feveral turnings and windings. In fome 
places, its banks are open and covered with trees and 
bufces ; but for the moft part, it is confined by bold and 
perpendicular rocks, from 50 to 100 feet high. 

ProfpeBs. — This parifli is diftinguiflied by its beautiful 
fcenery, and from the top of Bichmount, there is certain- 
ly one of the fined inland profpects in Scotland. From 
Stirling caftle, and from Moncreifl"'s hill, there are pro- 
fpedls in fome refpe£ls fuperior ; but neither of them 
comprehends fuch an extent of cultivated country, and fo 
great a variety of hills and valleys. The higheft part of 
Dichmount is only about 700 feet above the level of the 
fea J but even this fmall elevation gives it a commandinp; 

view.

view, bounded in every diredlion, by diflant high grounds, 
hills and mountains. Parts of 13 or 14 counties are vifi- 
ble. Placed on this eminence, the fpeftator beholds to 
the S. £. Tinto, the Tweeddale and Pentland hills ; and 
to the N. W. Ben Lomond, many of the hills of Cowal 
and Breadalbane ; and among thefe laft, the conical fum- 
mit of Ben Loi, which is partly covered with fnow, fi-om 
the end of Odlober to the beginning of July. But the 
beauties of this profpeft lie nearer at hand, and more im- 
mediately in view, comprehending the ftrath of Clyde, from 
Lanark on the one hand, to Dumbarton on the other. A- 
midft the amazing variety of objedls, which here prefent 
themfelves to the eye of the fpeftator, the moft ftriking 
are, the windings of the river, and its banks adorned with 
villages, towns, and gentlemens feats ; the extenfive woods 
and plantations about Hamilton ; the magnificent ruins of 
Bothwell caftie ; but above all, the large and populous city 
of Glafgow, with its numerous fpires and venerable cathe- 
dral. 

Air and CVmate. — The air varies confiderably here, as it 
does in every other parifli, the furface of which is unequal. 
It is often mild and tt^mperate on the banks of Clyde and 
Calder, w hile it is fliarp and cold in the internal and more 
elevated parts of the parifli. The air, however, is favour- 
able to health ; and this part of the country is not fubjeft 
to any peculiar epidemical diftempers. Though there be 
no iiiftances of extraordinary longevity yet there are fe- 
veral pcrfons now alive, who are confiderably above 80 ; 
and during the incumbency of the prefent minifter, fome 
have furvived 90. As a proof of the mildnefs of the cli- 
mate, it may be obferved, that no fnow has fallen in the 
lower part of the parifli for many years paft, which exceed- 
ed 6 inches in depth on plain ground ; and, unlefs when it is 

blown

blown into hollow and flieltered places, it feldom lies more 
than 4 or 5 days. The quantity of rain which falls at Glaf- 
gow, on an average of more than 20 years, is found to be al- 
moft 31 inches. The quantity which falls here is probably 
fomewhat lels *.

ed from the following abridgment of a regifter, kept for 7 years, (from ift 
January 1785 to 31ft December 1791,) at Cambuaang manfc, which is fitud- 
ted about 200 feet above the level of the fea.

State of "Property. — On the fuppofitlon, that the parifh 
contains 8 fqnare miles in fuperficial extent, there are, oa 
the whole, about 4032 Scotch acres ; and allowing 232 
acres for braes, planting, roads, and wafte ground, there 
remain 3800 acres of arable land. The rate of arable 
land is from 10 s. to 40 s. per acre; but the average rate 
of land does not exceed 15 s. per acre. Now 3800 acres, 
at 15 s. per acre, amount to L. 2856, which is about the 
prefent rental. The property of the parilh is divided a- 
mong II heritors. His Grace the Duke of Hamilton, to 
whom about two thirds of it belongs, may be confidered 
as the only non-refiding heritor. Three others, indeed, 
dwell within the confines of neighbouring parifhes ; but 
are fo very near this parifh, that they farm part of their 
own lands in it. Below is a ftate of the number of acres 
belonging to the feveral heritors, with their valued rent, 
and alfo their real rent, eftimating the land which the re- 
liding heritors poflefs, at the ordinary rate of fuch land in

To the above fum of L. 2850 muft be added the produce 
of a confiderable colliery belonging to the Duke of Hamil- 
ton, amounting to L. 250 a-year, which makes the prefent 
yearly rental L. 3100. About 330 acres are in the pof- 
feflion of the- 10 heritors above mentioned. All the reft of 
the parifti is in the hands of jo tenants, who may be clafled 
differently, according to their refpeftive rents. There is one 
tenant who pays above L. 600, two who pay above L. igo, 
ten who pay L. 50 and upwards, 19 who pay L. 20 and 
upwards, and 18 who pay lefs than L. 20. 

Cultivatio7i and Produce. — Almoft the whole parifli is ara- 
ble, and the greateft part of if as well cultivated as any lands 
in the neighbourhood. It yields all the ordinary kinds of 
gr^in produced in Scotland. Oats, peafe, beans, and barley, 
have beeti raifed from time immemorial; but fince the 
middle of this century, wheat, potatoes, rye-grafs, and clo- 
ver have been introduced, and it is chiefly by the produce of 
thefe laft, that many of the farmers now pay their rents.

About 40 years ago, oats were almoft the only grain fcwn 
here, the quantity of black fluff and barley being inconfi- 
derable ; and though there be ftill a greater number of 
acres in oats than in all other kinds of grain, yet that num- 
ber is daily diminifhing. All the oats raifed at prefent are 
not fufficient to fupply the demands of the parifli. The 
praftice of fowing wheat was introduced about the year 
1760, and fince that time, the quantity fown has been gra- 
dually increafing. It is now the favourite crop with thofe 
farmers, who poflefs that half of the parifii which lies next 
to Clyde. Wheat is fown on all kinds of foil ; but 
the clayey, which is indeed the moft common, is found to 
anfwer beft, becaufe the crop fufers leaft by the frofty 
nights and funflune days in the fpring. The greateftpart of 
the wheat fown here is on fummer fallow, and after 4 or 5 
repeated plowings. It is doing the farmers no more than jur 
ftice to fay, that they fpare neither labour nor expence to 
raife great crops of wheat ; and, from the yearly increafing 
quantity, it may be prefumed, they find that their labour 
and expence turn out to a good account. Glafgow dung 
is the principal manure employed for raifing a wheat crop. 

A 



of Camhujlang. 249 

Acart of dung in Glafgow, by the time it is carried to the 
unghill without the town, cofts i s. 6 d. ; but this cart is 
Q large, that two of them make three of thofe that are 
brought to the country, which therefore coft only i s. each. 
The expence of carriage depends on the diftance ; but the 
carriage of one cart to the diftance of 6 miles, cannot be efti- 
niated at le&amp; than i s. 6d. and it requires 45 carts to dung 
an acre of land for wheat. Befides dung, lime is alfo com- 
monly employed. The lime is brought from the neigh- 
bouring parifti of Kilbride. When carried to the diftance 
of 4 miles, it cofts about 10 s. the chalder, and 4 chalders, 
are neceflary for an acre of wheat land. The whole ex- 
pence, therefore, of preparing and fowing an acre of land 
with wheat, at the diftance of 6 miles from Glafgow, and 
4 miles from Kilbride, fuppofing every -article to be paid 
in money, ma}'^ be eftimated thus : 
' 5 plowings at 8 s. - L. 2 o o 

45 carts dung at 2 S. 6d. - 5 12 6 
4 chalders lime at 10 s. - 200 
\ boll feed wheat at 20 s. - o 10 o 

1 years rent at 15 s. - 1100

It may well be fuppofed, that the farmer's labour and ex- 
pence will feldom be paid by the iirft crop ; but if it be 
nearly paid, he muft be a confiderable gainer ; for land, 
which has been treated in this manner, will be in fuch or- 
der, that he will be amply repaid by the fucceeding craps. 
The practice of planting potatoes in the fields, was introdu- 
ced about the fame time with that of fowing wheat, and is 
now common over all the parlfh. Though potatoes coft a 
great deal of work, yet they not only make a plentiful re- 
turn, but alfo leave the ground in fuch a condition, that 
the farmers fow it with wheat, and have good crops, but 
VoL.V li, not

not equal to thofe after fummer fallow. All the wheat, ex, 
cept what is preferved for feed, and, at leaft, a third of the 
potatoes, are fold in Glafgow. 

Imple?nents of Hujbandry. — In, this parilh there are about 
70 ploughs, moftlj of the old Scotch fafliion, but not fo 
heavy and clumfy as formerly. Every confiderable farm- 
er has at leaft two ploughs, a larger and a lefs. The lar- 
ger is drawn by 3 horfes, and always employed where one 
plowing only is neceffary, and alfo for the firft plow- 
ings, where more are necefiary. The lefs is drawn by % 
horfes, and employed in all fubfequent plowings after the 
firft or fecond. Many of the farmers are of opinion, that 
Small's chain plough, drawn by 2 horfes, does not turn' 
their wet ftifF clayey foil effeflually. It is ufed, however,- 
by fome farmers, in light dry land, and, by others, in gi- 
ving the laft plowings to fummer fallow, and both find it 
to anfwer abundantly well. There are two corn mills, one 
on the Calder, and another on the Clyde ; the latter is ca- 
pable of grinding 30 or 40 bolls a-day, and it is almoft 
conftantly employed, in winter and fpring, fcy the farmer? 
in the neighbourhood, and in fummer and autumn by the 
dealers in foreign grain, in and about Glafgow. In fomg 
feafons aooo bolls of foreign oats have been milled here^ 
and in every feafon above 1000. Here thirlage ftill conti-. 
nues. 

EffeBs of conneBion with Ghfgo'w.-r-T\^\s and the neigh- 
bouring parlfhes depend, in a great meafure, on Glaf, 
gow, which is the market where they fell every thing they 
can, fpare, and buy every thing they want. The ftate 
tnanufaftures and commerce in that city extends its influ- 
ence over all the adjacent country. Glafgow is happily 
fjtuated for carrying on trade with America j and pve^ 

fince 



of Camhujlang. 251 

nee the Union of the two kingdoms, has availed itfelf, in 
ome degree, of this advantage. Its manufaftures and 
ommerce had been advancing gradually, though flowly, 
rom that period to the middle of the century, when it 
Ifirft began to make a rapid progrels. This was chiefly 
owing to the great increafe of the tobacco trade, which 
had hitherto) been much obftru(fted by the dealers in that 
;ommodity, refiding in London, Briftol, Liverpool, arid. 
^Vhitehaven. Thefe dealers, after all their attempts to de- 
Iroy this trade had proved abortive, were obliged to aban- 
3on them, and from that time, which was towards the mid- 
iie of the century, the tobacco trade of Glafgow was car- 
ried on with equal vigour and fuccefs. In confequence of 
this lucrative trade, the city and its inhabitants, in a Iliort 
time, affumed a different appearance. A new and better 
[tile was introduced in building, and in furniture, as well as 
\\\ drefs and living. Thefe improvements in Glafgow foon 
began to fliew themfelves in the furrounding country. An 
increafing demand for the articles which land produces, and 
a confequent rife of pricfes in the market, gave life and vi- 
gour to the exertions of the farmer. Growing wealth begat 
new wants, and a tafte for imitation began to operate. The 
farmer, as Well as the merchant, came by degrees to relilh 
the conveniencies, and even the luxuries of life ; a remark- 
able change took place in his lodging, clothing, and manner 
of living. The diiference in the (late of the country, in the 
value of land and mode of cultivation, in the price of pro- 
vifions and the wages of labour, in food and cloathing, be- 
tween the years 1750 and 1790, deferves to be ^particularly 
recorded.-

• Thefe articles, relating to the value of oat-meal, are talcen from the re- 
cords of the UmverCty of Glafgow. It merits particular notice, that though' 
oat-meal has rifen in price a good deal, yet it has not rifen in proportion t»' 
other articles of provifion. This, it is apprehended, may be afcribed to the 
folWng caufes i The price of oat-meal has been prevented from rifing 
aa highl it would naturally do. by adts of Parliament, allowing the im- 
portation of oats and oat-meal from other countries, when they exceed a 
certain rate. 2. The demand for oat-meal is lefl^ened by the increafing de- 
mand for other kinds of .provifion ; fuch as butcher meat, flour, variou- 
kinds of vegetables and roots, but efpecially potatoes, which may be faid, 
without exaggeration, to fupply the inhabitants of this country with food 
for three or four months annually. It may be thought, that the price of 
oat-meal is hindered from rifing in proportion to other kinds of provifion- 
by the greater quantity of oats now raifed, in confequencc of the late im' 
provements in agriculture. But, whether the quantity of oats no^v raifed, 
be muck greater than formerly, may be queftioned. It is certain, that, irf 
^onfequence of a better fyftem of agriculture, much heavier crops of oats are 
raifed upoH the land in tillage ; but it is equally certain, that there is much 
lefsland ,n tillage, and that there are many thoufands of acres now in 
wheat, potatoes, bay and pafture. which were formerly in oats. Some good- 
judges are of opinion, that the quantity of oats now raifed, is not much 
greater than it was 40 years ago ; and that the principal caufe of the rife irf

Colliery, i^c. — The greateft part of the inhabitants are far- • 
mers and day-labourers ; but befides ordinary tradefmen and : 
artificers, fuch as mafons, wrights, &amp;c. there are a good : 
number of colliers, weavers, and 'cotton fpinners. The coal- 
•work has been of long ftanding, and is faid to be the oldeft ia 1 
the neighbourhood of Glafgow. There are about 100 coal- 
pits which have been wrought. If each of thefe, at an a- • 
verage, be fuppofed to have lafted only 4 years, the coal- -i 
work muft have been wrought for 4 centuries, and this car- 
ries it back, till within little more than a century, of the firft f 
knowledge of coal as a fuel in Scotland*. The field, iai 
which the coals are found, lies on the fouth fide of Clyde^, 
and may be about a mile fquare. It has a general flope to- ■ 
wards the river, with confiderable fwelllngs here and there j; 
and, in feveral places, is cut and broken by rivulets. In this, 
field there are known to be 5 ftrata, or feams of coal, of dif-- 
ferent thicknelTes, and at different diftances from one ano-- 
ther. Thefe feams are always nearly parallel to one anoi"^ 
ther, but not parallel to the furface of the earth, having their: 
dip or declination towards Clyde. At the river they lie; 
many feet deep, but rife gradually till they crop out, or 
reach the furface within lefs than a mile and an half of it,. 
The nearer you approach to Clyde, the dip is fo much th§; 

lefs,, 

*Thc eailieft evidence ofthe ufe of coal as a fuel in Scotland, is faid taa 
be a chsrtei of William de Obei vill, in which he grants liberty to the ab, . 
bot and convent of Dunfermline, to open a coal-pit upon his lands of Pe«» 
tyncrieff. This charter is dated the day before the fealt of St Ambrofe, ,

lefs, but is one foot in 4 or 5, at a diflance from it *. One 
of the mofl important points to be attended to, in Avorking 
coal, is to do it in fuch a manner as to keep clear of water? 
and this till lately was done by a level, which condufted the 
Avater from the dilFerent coal pits to Clyde. But the^coal 
could not be Avrought dry in this way, whenever it was 
lower than the bed of the river. This difadvantage in- 
duced the prefent poffelTor to ered a fteam engine in 1787 
by means of which, the coal can be wrought dry at a much 
greater depth than formerly. The colliery gives employ- 
ment to 62 men, young and old. Of thefe 42 are employed 
below ground, and 20 above. As tlie work of the former 
is laborious, hazardous and difagrecable, fo their profit is 
great in proportion to that of other workmen. They are 
furniined with a houfe and coal for fuel, and have 6 d. for 
every cart. An ordinary collier can eafily dig 4 carts, for 
1 which he receives 2s. 2d. a-day ; and, if he works every 
day, 13 s. a-week. Thofe who work above ground, are al- 
fo furniflied with houfes and coal for fuel, and have from 
10 d. to I s. 2 d. a-day. The wages of colliers and other 
incidental expences may amount to L. 2cco per annum. 
About 600 carts of coals are put out weekly ; and confe. 
quently above 30,000 yearly. The ancient and prefent 
price of coals cannot be compared with accuracy, ■ on ac- 
count of the diiTerence in weight and meafure. About 
Vol. V. Kk 175°. 

* The colliers call the declination of a team downwards the dip cf the 
coal, and its incliiiption uinvards, the crop of the c ial. ]t is a curious fadt 
and well worthy of nolio;. that not only all the fc. ata of coal, but alfo all 
the ftrata of treeftoiie, have their dip towards Clyde, on both fide! of it, 
that is, the coal and ftone on the fouth fide of the rivei', have their declina- 
tion to the north ; aad, on the contrary, the ci;i\ and ftone on the north 
fide of the river, have their declination to the louth. How tliis hCt is to be 
accounted for, it is not cafy to fay.

weighed 900 weight, the price of coals was jiift i d. per 100 
weight. At prefent, the cart fells on the coal-hill at 2 s. 3 d. 
It is faid to weigh 1200 weight, confequently the price of 
coals is 2^6.. per 100 weight, which is more than double 
their price 40 years ago. ^ 

Weavers. — The weaving of holland, or fine linen, was 
begun here about 60 years ago, and gave employment to a 
few looms. The weavers bought the yarn, wove it intot ^ 
cloth, bleached the cloth and carried it to market ; fo thae*f' 
they engrofled feveral bufinefles, which are now almoft en- I 
tirely feparate. Towards the middle of the century, the ' 
weaving of lawns and cambricks came in place of holland, 
or fine linen. The yarn was now furnifhed by dealers in 
that commodity in Glafgow, to whom the weavers return- 
ed it in webs, for which they received payment according 
to their quantity and quality. In 1783, the weaving of 
muflin was introduced, which, for feveral years paft, has 
given employment to all the weavers here, except a few 
who make webs for their country neighbours. About the 
fr ae time, the art of weaving received a confiderable im- 
provement, by the introdudlion of the fly-fhuttle, which is 
now generally uled. It enables the weaver to' do more 
work, with greater eafe to himfelf, and which is of ftiU 
higher importance, the ereft pofition of his body is favour- 
able to health. An ordinary weaver can eafily make 10 s. 
a-week. In this parifh there are 120 Aveavers, including 
journeymen and apprentices, who may be fuppofed to gaii| 
about L. 2800 per annum. 

Cotton Work.— In 1787, a cotton work was eftabliftied at 
a village called Flemington. At prefent, it confifts of 2 
cardmg machines and 17 jennies, including i for roving and 

2 for 



oj Camhiijlang. 259 

) for flabbing. Each of the jennies fpins 84 thrqads at once. 
The carding machines are driven by water, which is col- 
lefted from many diflPerent fprings, into a refervoir at the 
foot of Dichmount hill, and conveyed from thence to the 
cotton work, about ^ of a mile diftant, partly by an open 
runner, and partly by wooden pipes. An ordinary cotton 
fpinner can gain about 10 s. a week. This work gives em- 
ployment to 50 people old and young, and occafions a circu- 
lation of about L. 700 a-year. 

Roads and Bridges.— Koads have of late become objeds 
of great confequence, and much labour and expence are 
now beftowed upon them. The moft public road is that 
from Hamilton to Glafgow, which paffes through the pa- 
rifh from eaft to weft. This road was originally made by 
the ftatute work ; but was fome years ago improved, and 
has fmce been kept in repair, by a toll levied at a turnpike 
near Glafgow. There are two other roads, much fre- 
quented by coal, lime, and ironftone carts, which crofs the 
parilh from fouth to north. Both of thefe were made, and 
are ftill fupported by the ftatute work, which is converted 
into money, at the rate of 15 s. for each plough, and 7^^. 
for each houfeholder. The only bridges within the parifli 
are on rivulets, but there are two bridges on C alder water. 
One of thefe, probably the oldeft in this diftrift, is called 
Prior bridge, either becaufe it was built at the expence, or 
for the convenience, of the priory in Blantyre. 

Church, 6c. — The minifter's living confifts of laS bolls 
12 pecks of oat-meal, L. 30 of money, 100 merks for 
communion elements, a manfe, and about 44- acres of 
glebe ; which, in whole, valuing the oat-meal at 11.4-d. the 
peck, is worth L. 140 j6(?r annum. The kirk, which is a 
neat plain edifice, was built in 1743, and the manfe in 1 756 ; 

but

but both have been repaired fince, and are at prefent 
in good order. His Grace the Duke of Hamilton is patron 
and titular. 

School. — For feveral years pafl, the fchool has been in a 
flourifliing condition. The fchoolmader has 200 merks of 
falary, with a houfe and garden. The rate of education 
per quarter is, Englifli is. 6d.; writing 2 s. ; arithmetic 
2 s. 6 d. ; and Latin 3 s. The number of fcholars within 
the parifli is from 60 to and of boarders, at L. 20 fier 
annum, from 10 to 15, The fchoolmafter's living, exclu- 
five of the profit arifing from his boarders, is about L. 40 
yearly. 

Poor's Funds. — There are in this parifh two confiderable 
mortifications in favour of the poor. Irl 1615, James Mar- 
quis of Hamilton, in conjunction with Mr John Howifon, 
minifter of Cambuflang, mortified a fum of money, the 
yearly intereft of which was dired^ed to be employed for 
maintaining in an hofpital at Hamilton, 8 poor men, 2 of 
''whom were always to belong to the parifli of Cambuflang. 
Gabriel Hamilton, of Weflburn, in 170Q, mortified 600 
merks, the intereft of which was to be laid out in buying 
flioes and hofe to the indigent. Befides thefe mortifications, 
the poor's ftock amounts to L. 350 ; the intereft of this 
ftock, with the ordinary colleftion on Sundays, and mort- 
cloth dues, which may be about L. i j, yield a fum fufficient 
without any affeffment, to fupply the wants of the poor. 

Population. — The ftatc of population for the laft 46 
years, may be exadly afcertaiaed by the report made to 
Dr Webfter in 1755, and by three feparate lifts taken by 
the prefent incumbent:

Houfes. — For feveral years fince 1767, when the 
Duice of Hamilton let his lands in larger farms than 
formerly, there were a confiderable number of houfes un- 
inhabited ; and fome few of them allowed to go to ruin. 
But all of them that remain are now repaired, and full of. 1 
people. Since 1783, 16 good new houfes have been built, 
in which about 24 families are well lodged. Seven years 
ago, there were only 8 families living in a paltry village 
near the kirk •, but at prefent, there are 3 times that num- 
ber. 

Horfes, Black Cattle and Sheep. — In this diftria, there 
are 180 horfes, all of which, a very few excepted, are era- 
ployed in the cultivation of land. Thefe horfes are moft- 
ly raifed in the fhlres of Renfrew and Ayr, and bought " 
by the farmers, in the markets of Glafgow and Ruther- 
glen. The number of black cattle is 630, of which about: 
300 are milk cows. The reft are partly black cattle, in- 
tended for the market ; but chiefly young cattle reared • 
ly the farmers, for prefer ving their ftock. The yearly- 



of Cambujlang, 2,63 

profit of milk cows, at an average, may be about L. 3. 
The farmers find it more advantageous to make their milk 
into butter than into cheefe \ of which laft, they make no 
more than what fupplies their own families. Almoft all 
the butter and chilrned milk they can fpare, is fold in 
Glafgow. The ftieep are 410 in number, and all of the 
Scotch breed, except about 120. Moft of thefe laft, are large 
Englifti llieep, which the farmers pafture along with their 
cows. A public fpirited gentleman has lately got a fcore 
of the Cheviot breed, which are fmaller in lize, but finer 
in wool, and promife to do well in this part of the coun- 

Minerals. — Befides plenty of coal and fome ironftone, 
tliere are vaft beds of freeftone over the whole parilh ; 
except on the ridge formed by Dichmount and Turnlea 
hiUs, which confift of whin, and furnifli abundance of good 
materials for making roads. On the banks of the kirk- 
burn, there is a fpecies of freeftone of excellent quality 
white, hard and clofe of the grain ; confequently capable 
of bemg made very fmooth and beautiful. This fpecies is 
held in high eftimation, and fometimes carried to a great 
diftance. A ftratum of marble, from 6 to 12 inches thick, 
IS known to extend over a confiderable part of the parifh' 
Like the coal, it has its dip towards Clyde ; and wherever 
coal-pits have been funk, it has been found at the depth 
of from 180 to 200 feet. At fuch a depth, it could not 
be eafily come at ; but there is a place on the kirk-burn 
Where it has been dug at dift-erent times. It is of a dark 
brown colour, beautifully variegated with white, and 
takes a good polifti. Of this marble, there are feveral 
fl^bs in the palace of Hamilton, a chimney-piece in the

Fami/ier 

« Dichmount hill, * feems to have been anciently a place of ftrengtln , 
or defence. There are appearances of a fort of earthen rampart, which V 
cncompalTed it a little below the fummit ; and on the very fummit, there'"!; 
are ftill plain veftiges of buildings. The ruins of thefe buildings were'^i 
confiderable about 10 years ago ; but fince tliat time, the flones and ru^. • 
bifli have been removed for making dikes, and repairing roads. The 
prefentpoffeffor, when digging a few years ago on the fummit of the hill, | 
difcovered the foundation of a circular building, about 24 feet in dii-* 
meter. The ftones had been carefully joined together, but no figns qf B 
mortar could be obferved. They were freeftones ; and mull have beeni 
can-ied with much labour, from a diftance, as the ftones, which are found' 
in great abundance upon the hill, are all whin. From the figure of : 
this building, and the place where it flood, it is conjeflured to have i 
been a ■ turris fpeculatoria, or watch-tower : and for fuch an edifice, 1. 
a better fituation could not have been chofen. From it one could ^ 
fee and be feen almoft in all divecftions, more than 15 miles; and in a 
fome, more than 50. About a mile E. from the kirk, there is a fmain 
ridge' terminated on the W. by a circular mount, level on the top, about^ 
dO feet in height, and 140 feet in diameter. This mount, from its regu-V 
larity is plainly the work of art, and refembles thofe artificial mounts, 
on which the Britons and Saxons built their fortvefles f. When the* 
fouth of Scotland was poffefled by the Britons and Saxons, it is probable 
that one of their fortreffes might ftand on this mount ; but however this 
may be, it is certain, that the caftle of Drumfargard X flood upon it. A 
great barony was annexed to this caftle ; which muft have ueen a plac;

^families. — There are few confiderable eftates in this pa- 
rifh, and all of them have probably at diiFerent periods, 
been detached from the barony of Drumfargard. On the 
S. fide of Dichmount, ftands Latrick, which, about the 
beginning of the laft century, was the feat of a Sir John 
Hamilton, whofe family is extinft, and the eftate is now in 
the poffeflion of the Duke of Hamilton. On the N. fide of 
the fame hill, ftands the houfe of Gilbertfield, which, from 
an infcription above one of the windows, appears to have 
been built in 1607. This place was long the refidence of 
a family of the name of Cunningham. About the begin- 
ning of this century, the eftate was purchafed by the laird 
of Weftburn. Lieutenant William Hamilton, the friend 
and poetical correfpondent of Allan Ramfay, lived many 
years, firft at Gilbertfield, and then at Latrick, where he 
died, 24th May 1751, at an advanced age. The moft 
confiderable refiding family at prefent, is that of John Ha- 
milton, Efq-, of Weftburn. This gentleman is defcended 

Vol. V. L 1 from 

that could eafily be flooded, except on the E. where it is faid to have 
been defended by a draw-bridge. The fituation was doubtlefs well 
chofen for a place of fecurity in diforderly times ; and, though only a- 
bout 60 or 70 feet higher than the adjacent ground, the profpscT: from 
it would always be extenfive and commanding, but is now highly rich 
and beautiful. About 20 years ago, there were fome remains of this an- 
cient callle ; but now no veftige of it is to be feen. The ftopes of it 
were employed in building the farm houfes, called Hall-fide, becaufe 
they flood in the near neighbourhood of the great hall. The tenant, 
who is now in poffeflion of it, has dag from its ruins many carts of ftones, 
fome of which ^vere hewn and had iron crooks' in them, upon which doors 
had been hung. Among the rubbifh human bones have been found, 
once a pewter plate, and on many occafions pieces of coin, but ot what 
reign is not known. — The barony of Drumfargaid has been the proper- 
ty fucceffively of feveral families of great name; the Oliphants, the 
Murrays, the Douglafes, and the Hamiltons. At prefent it makes a part 
©f the entailed eftate of Hamilton.

from the Hamiltons of Torrence and thefe from the Ha- 
miltons of Raploch, who were one of the oldeft branches 
of the houfe of Hamilton *. His anceftors took, up their 
refidence at Weftburn near two centuries ago. 

Religious HoJifes. — No veftige now remains of any of 
thofe religious houfes which were in this parifli, during 
the times of Popery. There was, however, on the banks 
of the Kirk Burn, about ;J of a mile below the kirk, a 
chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mary, to which belonged 
4 acres of land, which ftill retain the name of Chapel. 
There was alfo an hofpital 2 miles E. from the kirk, to 
which about 130 acres of land, called Spittal and Spittal- 
hill, feem to have been annexed. But the perfons by 
whom, and the time when thefe religious houfes were 
founded, are equally unknown. The parifli of Cambuflang 
itfelf, was firft a redlory, and then a prebend. John Ca- 
meron, of the family of Locheil, was reftor when he was 
promoted to the Biftioprick of Glafgow. In 1429, Bifliop 
Cameron, at the delire of the patrsn, Archibald Earl of 
Douglas, made the parifli of Cambuflang a prebend ; and 
at the fame time, appointed the prebendary and his fuc- 
ceflors, perpetual chancellors of the cathedral at Glafgow. 
In confequence of this appointment, the prebendary was 
obliged to refide at Glafgow, and to ferve the cure at 
Cambuflang by a vicar, who had for his fupport the vica- 
rage teind, now valued at 100 merks, with a houfe and 
6 acres of land, known to this day by the name of Vicar- 
lajid f.

ed " Cambuflang converfions." In treating of this fubjedt, it will be 
proper to give a brief hiftorical view, fiiil of the fadls, and then of the 
opinions entertained concerning them *. 

The kirk of Cambuflang being fmall and in bad repair, the miniller, 
when the weather was favourable, ufed to preach in a tent, eredled clofe 
by a rivulet, at the foot of a bank or brae near the kirk, which is ftill call- 
ed " the preaching or converfion brae." No place could be better form- 
ed by the hand of nature for field preaching ; as the brae rifes gradually 
from the place where the tent flood, in the form of an amphitheatre, fo 
that every perfoninthe audience could fee and hear the preacher diftindlly. 
Mr M'Culloch, for about a year before this work began, had preached on 
the do(ftrine of regeneration ; and upon the Sabbath evenings after fer- 
mon, frequently read to his hearers, millives, atteftations and journals, he 
had received from his correfpondents, giving an account of converfions, 
which had taken place in different parts of the world, efpecially in Mew 
England under Mr Whitefield's miniftry. Thefe miflives, atteftations and 
journals, were at the fame time publiflied weekly at Glafgow, in halfpen- 
ny pamphlets ; and had an extenfive circulation in this and the neigh- 
bouring parifhes. The fruits of thefe inftru(flions were a more than or- 
dinary

ilinary concern about religion. Towards tlie end of January 1 742, tws 
perfons, Ingram More, a flioemaker, and Robert Bowman, a weaver, 
■went through the parifli, and got about 90 heads of families to fubfcribe 
a petition, which was prefented to the minilter, defiring that he would 
give them a weekly ledlure. This petition the minifter readily 
granted, and Thurfday was fixed upon as the moft convenient day of the 
week for that purpofe. On the two firft Thurfdays after the lc(fl:ure was 
over, fome perfons came to the minifter's houfe, much concerned about 
their fpiritual intereft ; but the number was not great. On Monday 
15th February, and the two following days, all the fellowlhip meetings 
in the parilli convened in one body in the minifter's houfe, and were em- 
ployed for many hours in fervent prayer for the fuccefs of the gofpel, and 
for an outpouring of the Holy Spirit in their bounds, as in other places 
abroad: The next day, being Thurfday I Sth February, nothing remark- 
able happened during the ledure, except that the hearers were apparently 
all attention : but when the minifter in his laft prayer expreffed himfelf 
thus : " Lord who hath believed our report ; and to whom is the arm of 
" the Lord revealed ? where are the fruits of my poor labours among this 
" people ?" feveral perfons in the congregation cried out publicly, and 
about 50 men and women came to the minifter's houfe, cxprefling 
ftrong convidlions of fin, and alarming fears of punifliment. After this 
period, fo many people from the neighbourhood reforted to Carabuflang, 
that the minifter thought himfelf obliged to provide them with daily 
fermons or exhortations, and adlually did fo for 7 or 8 months. The 
way in which the converts were affeifted, for it feems they were all af- 
fected much in the fame way, though in very diflerent degrees, is thus 
defcribed. They were feized all at once, commonly by fomething 
faid in the fermons or prayers, with the moft dreadful apprehenfions con- 
cerning the ftate of their fouls, infomuch that many of them could not 
abftain from crying out, in the moft public and frightful manner, " be- 
" wailing their loft and undone condition by nature ; calling themfelves 
" enemies to God, and defpifers of precious Chrift ; declaring that they 
" were unworthy to live on the face of the earth ; that they faw the 
" mouth of hell open to receive them, and tliat they heard the llirieks of 
" the damned;" but the univerfal cry was, " -what fiall ive do to be 
" fnvcd The agony under which they laboured, %vas exprefled not^ 
only by words, but alfo by violent agitations of body ; by clapping their 
hands and beating their breafts ; by ftiaking and trembling ; by faintings 
and convulfions ; and fometiraes by exceffive bleeding at die nole. 
While they were in this diftrefs, the minifter often called out to them, 
not to ftiflc or fmother their convidionS, but to encourage them ; and, 

after 



of Camhujlang.

after fermon was ended, he retired with them to the manfe, and frequent- 
ly fpent the beft part of the night with them in exhortations and prayers. 
Next day before fermon began, they were brought out, commonly by 
More and Bowman, and having napkins tied round their heads, were 
placed all togetlier on feats before the tent, where they remained fobbing, 
weeping and often crying aloud, till the fervice was over. Some of 
thofe who fell under convidtion were never converted ; but moft of 
thofe who fell under it were converted in a few days, and fometimes in 
a few hours. In moft cafes their converfion was as fudden and unex- 
pected as their convidtion. They were raifed all at once from the low- 
«ft depth of forrow and diftrefs, to the higheft pitch of joy and happi- 
nefs ; crying out with triumph and exultation, " that they had over- 
«' come the wicked one ; that they had gotten hold of Chrift, and 
« would never let him go ; that the black cloud, which had hitlierto 
« concealed him from their view, was now difpelled ; and tliat they 
" faw him with a pen in his hand blotting out their fins." Under 
thefe delightful impreffions, fome began to pray and exhort publicly ; 
and others defired the congregation to join with them in fmging a par- 
ticular pfalm, which they faid God had commanded them to fing. 
From the time of their convidtion to their converfion, many had ho 
appetite for food, or inclination to fleep, and all complained of the fe- 
verity of their fufFerings during that interval *. This Angular work foon 
became public, made a great noife, and brought vaft numbers of people 
from all quarters. The minifter, who at firft was affifted chiefly by- 
preachers in the neighbourhood, foon got abundance of afliftance from 
his brethren ; fome of whom came at his defire, and others of tlieir own 
accord. Among thofe who reforted to Cambuflang on this occafion, 
there were many of the moft popular minifters in Scotland ; fuch as, 
Mefli-s. Willifon of Dundee, Webfter of Edinburgh, M'Knight of Ir- 
vine, M'Laurin of Glafgow, Currie of Kinglaffie, Bonner of Toi-phichen, 
Robe of Kilfyth, &amp;c. Mr Whitefield, who had been in England for 
feveral months, did not arrive till June. The facrament was giveii twice 
in the fpace of 5 weeks, viz. on lith July and 15th Auguft. Imnienfc 
multitudes of hearers and fpedtators were prefent at both, but efpecially 
at the laft. On the Sunday, befides the tent at the foot of the 
brae above defcribed, where 'the facrament was difpenfed, other two 
tents were eredled. At each of thefe there was a veiy great congrega- 
tion,

tion. Mr Whitefield, who was accuftomed to numerous audiences, fup. 
poled, that at the three tents, there were upwards of 30,000 people ; u 
greaterniimber probably than was everfeen on any other facramental occa/. 
fion. Molt of the above mentioned minillers and others were affiftants 
at this folemnity. Four preached on the faft-day, 4 on Saturday, 
probably I4 or 15 on Sunday, and 5 on Monday. There were 25 ta- 
bles, about 120 at each, in all 3000 communicants. A great many 
of thefe came from Glafgow and the neighbourhood, about 200 from 
Edinburgh, about 200 from Kilmarnock, about 200 from Irvine and 
Stewarton, and fome from England and Ireland. " But," fays Mr 
M'CuUoch, " what was moll remarkable was the fpiritual glory of this 
«' folemnity ; I mean the gracious and fenfible prefence of God. Not 
" a few were awakened to a fenfe of fin, and their loft and perilhmT 
" condition without a Saviour; others had their bands loofed, and were 
" brought into the marvellous liberty of the fons of God. Some decla- 
" red that they would not for a world have been abfent from this fo- 
" lemnity. Others cried, now let thy fei-vants depart in peace from this 
" place, fince our eyes have feen thy falvation here." The Cambuflang 
work continued for about 6 months, that is, from the 18th Febniary till 
the fecond communion. Few or none were convidted or converted 
after this laft period. The daily preachings and exhortations, except 
the weekly letflure, ceafed. Public worfliip, however, was kept in the open 
fields till the month of November, when the inclemency of the weather 
rendered it neceflary to repair to the kirk. The number of perfons 
convidled and converted during this period, cannot be afcertained with 
accuracy. The former are faid to have been by far tlie greateft number., i 
In a letter of Mr M'Culloch's to Mr Robe, dated 30th April 175 1, af- ! 
ter acknowledging and bewailing die many backlliders, he aflerts, that i 
he had then in his pofleffion a lift of about 400 awakened at Cambuflang  
in 1742, who from that time to the time of their death, or the date of 
,his letter, had been enabled to behave in a good meafure as became the 
gofpel. About 70 of thefe 400 were or had been inhabitants of Cam- \ 
buflang. iji 

After the 1742, fome day about the 18th of February was obfen-ed 
yearly, in commemoration of this extraordinaiy work. " It was obfer- 
" ved," as Mr M'CuUoch exprefles it, in the papers which he read from 
the pulpit on thefe occafions, " partly as a day of thankfgiving for the 
" remarkable feafon of grace to many in the Britifli colonies, and par- 
" ticularly in this fmall comer, in the years 1 741 and 1742; and partly 
" as a day of humiliation and fafting for mifimprovement of mercies ;

«' than ordinary concern about their fouls, but have fince fallen away, 
« and turned as bad, or worfe than they were before." Since Mr 
M'CuUoch's death, fome day about the fame time, and for the fame 
pm"pofe, is ftill obferved by the fellowlliip meetings in the parifli. 

To what caufe this memorable work ought to be afcribed, was a que- 
ftion which occafioned much debate and great diverlity of opinion. 
Some afcribed it to the influence of the Holy Spirit ; others to the in- 
fluence of the devil ; and others to' the influence of fear and hope, of 
fympathy and example, aided by peculiar circumftances. Thofe who 
entertained the two firft opinions, agreed in thinking that this work 
ought to be afcribed to fupernatural agency, but differed widely as to the 
agent to whom it ought to be attributed ; the one confidering the agent 
as the bell of beings and the. other as the worft. Thofe who entertained 
the lait opinion, thought this work might be accounted for by natural 
caufes, and confequently that there was no occafion for having recourfe 
to fupernatural agency. 

I . That this work ought to be afcribed to the influence of the Holy 
Spirit, was the opinion of many of thofe, who are commonly known by 
the name of the high party in the Church of Scotland, and efpecially of 
thofe clergy, who attended and affifted at Cambuflang, while it was 
going on. The fruits of it in the hearts and lives of men were fuch, ac- 
cording to them, as might be expedled from the renewing and fancflify- 
ing influences of the Holy Ghofl:. Zeal for the glory of God and the ho- 
Miour of the Redeemer, flione with peculiar luftre. The lives of the pro- 
fane were reformed. Relative duties, where they had been negledled, 
Vere confcientioufly difcharged. Harmony and peace fucceeded ftrife 
and contention. Families, once the fynagogues of Satan, became tem-' 
pies where God was worlhipped. Perfons of all ranks formed them- 
felves into focieties, which met frequently for prayer and experimental 
converfation. With regard to the external effedls, by which this work 
maniiefted itfelf on the bodies of men, they acknowledge them to be un- 
common, but not Angular. The fcriptures furnifli inftances of fimilar 
effefls of an awakened confcience : fuch as St Paul at his converfion ; 
the jailor at Philippi ; and Felix who trembled as St Paul reafoned of 
righteoufnefs, temperance, and judgment to come. Inftances of fimilar 
effects have happened at the converfion of many particular perfons ; nay 
of great numbers at once even in our own country ; fuch as in feveral 
pariflies of Cunningham about 1625, and in the parifli of Shotts in 
.1630.

2. It is well known that the High Party of the Church of Scotland, 
ami the Seceders, are of the fame fentiments, as to dodlrine, difcipline 
and church government ; and that whatever was thought defedive or 
blameable in the Eftabliflied Church by the latter, was alio thought de- 
fedlive or blameable in it by the former ; though not in fo high a degree, 
as to juftify a fcparation or feceflion. It might therefore have been ex- 
pecfled, that the Seceders would have entertained the fame opinion with 
the high party concerning the work at Canibuflang ; and this would 
probably have been the cafe, if this work had happened a few years ear- 
lier, and while they were members of the Eftablillied Church. But cir- 
cuniftances were now greatly altered. The Seceders had left the Efta- 
bliflied Church, and formed themfelves into a feparate community under 
the name of the AlTociate Prefbytery ; they had publiflied a teftimony a- 
"•ainft the corruptions and defections of the Eftabliflied Church ; difown- 
ing her authority, and declaring her judicatories to be ill conftituted and 
unlawful courts. They could not therefore believe, that God would i 
countenance fo corrupt a church, as they had reprefented it, by fuch a 
gracious outpouring of the Holy Spirit. But as tlie work at Cambuf- n 
lang was extraordinai7 in itfelf, and as they could not believe it pro- n 
ceeded from the Holy Spirit ; fo they concluded it muft proceed from 11 
the devil. Thefe fentiments they openly avowed, by preaching and ^vri- :|i 
ting againft it ; and efpecially by an atfl, dated Dunfermline, 15th July j, 
I74Z, appointing the 4th of Auguft following to be obferved in all their it 
congregations, as a day of fafting and humiliation ; one of the principal 1^ 
grounds of which was, " The delufions of Satan, attending the prefent |j: 
«' awful work upon the bodies of men, going on at Cambuflang."^ j[ 
When this adt was publifhed, their ancient friends, who, for many years i 
fucceffively, had exerted their whole influence to bring them back to • il 
the bofom of the church, were filled with indignation, and even with . |j 
hon or. To afcribe tlie Canibuflang work to the influence of the devil, , :1 
appeared to them, a fin little inferior in guilt, to that of blafphemy agaiuft 
the Holy Ghoft. Mr Robe affirmed, " that this adl of the Aflbciate 
" Piefliytery was the moft heaven-daring paper, which had been publifli- 
" ed by any fet of men in Britain for a century paft." A paper war 
enfucd, in which the parties treated each other with abundance of free- 
dom ; but at the fame time, with many profeflions of Chriftian love and 1 
charity. .

influence of the Holy Spirit, nor to the influence of the devil, but to the 
influence of fear and hope, of fynipathy and example, aided by peculiar ^ 

circumftances, ■ 



of Cambujlang. 273 

• nimftances, was the general opinion of tliofe, who are known in the 
Church of Scothind, by tlie name of Ac Moderate p^rty. The only ex- 
traordinary circumftance relating to this work, is the external effedls on 
the bodies of men, by which it manifefted itfelf ; and thefe, they thought, 
might be fufficiently explained by the operation of natural caufes. The 
foul and body, they obferved, are fo intunately connedled, that they mu- 
tually fympatliife with each other, and whatever gives pleafure or pain 
to the one. gives likewife pleafure or pain to the other. All the paffions 
of the mind, efpecially thofe which are of a violent naUire, difcover 
tiiemfelves by fome correfponding outward expreflion. When an event, 
whetlicr joyful or forrowful, is communicated In mch an interefting 
manner as to affedl our minds ftrongly, it will aha affeA our bodies in 
proportion. As this is the cafe with regard to fuch of men's concerns as 
are prefent and temporal, is it not reafonable that it fliould alfo be the 
cafe with regard to fuch of them as are future and eternal ? If they be 
deeply affeaed by the preaching of the word. If, on the one hand, their 
fears be alarmed by the threatenmgs of the law, and the dreaJ of ever- 
laaing puniOnnent ; or if, on the other hand, while in this wretched fi- 
tuation, their hopes be elevated by the affurance of pardon, and tlie pvQ- 
fpeaof etei-nal happinefs ; is it not natural that the feelings of their 
minds fliould difcover themfelves both by their words and ad:ons ? 
The fermons preached at CambuQang, during this memorable work, it is 
alledged, were addrefled, not to the undevfcandings of the hearers, but to 
their imaginations and paffions ; and efpecially to the paffions of tear 
and hope. " Their loft and undone condition by nature was reprefent- 
" ed in a manner tlie moft awful and alarming. They were brought to 
" Mount Sinai, where thunder roars, and lightenings flafh. They were 
" encouraged by the precious promifes of the gofpel, by the confolacions 
" which are in Jefus, and the wonders of his grace. They were con- 
" ducted to Mount Calvary, and exhorted to behold, with the eye of 
- faith, the healing virtues, which fiowed from the wounds of their Sa- 
" viour, expiring upon the crofs." The natural tendency and effecls of 
thefe inflrudions were aided and ftrengthened by peculiar circumltances. 
The opinions of the Metliodiits, refpecling the fenlible operations of the 
Spirit of God in the work of regeneration ; the fudden and almoft m- 
ftantaneous converfions, which took place under Mr Whitefield's mim- 
ftiy, were well known at Cambuflang. Mr M'CuUoch was a great 
admirer of Mr Whitefield, and employed him repeatedly to preach in 
his pulpit. He frequently difcourfed on die wonderful converfions in 
New England ; and was at great pains to communicate to his people, the 
papers which gave an account of them. In this tafk, he,jvas fucceisfully

aflifted by More and Bowman *. They themfelves had been convertej 
by Mr Whitefield ; and were ever ready to defcribe the manner in which 
they had been aftedled, to thofe who were difpofed to lillen to them. 

That this preparation gave rife to the work at Cambuflang, they aflert- 
ed, was manifeft ; becaufe the perfons convided and converted there 
were affedted in the Tame manner, and exprefled themfelves in the fame 
words, with thofe who were convi(fted and converted in New England - 
A facT: which can no otherwife be accounted for, than by fuppofing, that 
the manner and language of the latter were perfedly familiar to the foi-- 
mer. When this work was once begun, they maintained, that the effedls 
of fympathy and example fufficiently explain its future progrefs. Every 
day's experience, fliows, that we are difpofed to imitate the adions of o- 
thers, and that we are naturally and as it were mechanically moved by 
feeing them, either in the depth of diftrefs, or in the height of exulta- 
tion. The operation of thefe principles was vifible alnioft in every in- 
ftance. Whenever any one was aft'edled, many others were afTecled in 
a fimilar manner. Whenever any one cried aloud, either through ex- 
ce/Tive grief or joy, but efpecially the former, many others cried aloud 
likewife, ufing the fame words, or words of the fame meaning. When 
all thefe concurring circumftances were taken into confideration, they 
thought it by no means furpriling, that there fliould be fome hundreds of 
converts among the many thoufands who attended at Cambuflang, during 
the courfe of feven or eight months. 

* The folio-wing faa, related by the one party, and not contradiBed by 
the other, is thought to place the character of More and Bomiman in a 
-jeryfu picions light. When any perfon ivas affeaed in time of fertnon, 'A 
they H ere always at hand to git-e their affljiance. One day, nuhen a luo- I 
man, ivho had fainted, began to revive, Bowman fays to her, " Chrift is . 
" juft a-coming; He is on the way ; He will, not tarry and a little ^ 
ajter More added, " Do you hear the found of his chariot wheels ?" 
Upon which the woman got up, in a tranf port of joy, crying, « He is 
" come ! I have got him, and will not let him go !"

traced. Slains is faid to iignifj health in the Gaelic lan- 
guage •, and indeed the lingular healthinefs of the inhabi-

River, Lake, and Mineral Waters.— The river Ythan dl- 
vides this pari/li from Foveran, and a part of Logie-Buchan. 
Ships frequently come in at the foot of it, and it is very 
convenient for exporting what meal, bear, oats and peafe 
the farmers can fpare, to Aberdeen and Peterhead. The 
river abounds with falmon, flounders, muflels, and cockles ; 
fmall pearls, and fome years ago, even large ones, 
were found in it. There is a very large lake, called the 
Loch ofSlains, in extent about 54 acres, and about 25 feet 
deep, in general, and in one place about 50; it abounds 
with pike, perch, and eel, and is encompaffed with plea- 
fant green banks, which, if planted, would make a truly 
pifturefque appearance. There are feveral good mineral 
fprings. They are moltly chalybeate. Some of them 
have been ufeful to perfons afflifted with gravelifh and bi- 
lious complaints.

Errol family, is fitilated in a ftrong peninfulated rock, the foot of which 
is waflied by the fea. It was demoliflied in IJ94, by James VI. on the 
rebellion of the Earl of Huntly. There is another piece of antiquity on ■ 
the eftate of Captain Gordon, viz. the ruins of a very ancient Roman 
Catholic chapel, called St Adamamnan's Chapel ; it has one arched Go- 
thic window entire, and mud be of -very great antiquity, as St Adamam- 
nan was a follower of St Columba, whofe life he wrote, and who was born 
in Ireland in the year 559; and died ift November 615 ; fo that if this 
chapel was not founded during his life, it is highly probable it was built 
not long after. It is fituated in a hollow at the fide of a fmall rivulet. 
The proprietor intends making a fmall plantation around it, which will 
add both to its beauty and p.-efervation.

are taken with lines, baited with muflels and hig, which are 
found in the bed of the Ythan at low tides, for nearly two 
Englifh miles above the fea *. The women are generally

this bait. At fii-ft they paid only 5 s. yearly, each ; now every man 
that goes to fea pays 20 s. a-year for liberty to gather it. As they 
are allowed to gather only on their own fide of the water, and muf- 
cles within their reach are fometimes fcarce, they are, on fuch occafions, 
obliged to buy them at 6 d. the peck, from tlie tackfmen of the water. 
They have alfo about 3 Englifli miles to carry them on their backs in 
Sill creels ; which makes their bait dear enough, though they paid no- 
thing

employed to gather the bait. About the one half of the fi(h 
caught here is carried in boats to Leith, Dundee, or Perth j 4 
the other half is carried by the women to AberdeeQ,t, 
Old Meldnim, or the country, or fold at home. For thr^ 
years paft, the tackfman of the water of Ythan has bargain- . 
ed for all the ling and cod caught here, from ift Odtoberi 
to ift February, at 6 d. each ling, and 4 d. each cod, abovee 
18 inches long, and at 2 d. between 18 and 12 inches each.« 
At this feafon they cannot get their fifti dried, and fo cau-. 
not carry them to a better market, not being in the prac^j.

Caves. — Along the fhore there are many caves. Theyr 
feem to be natural ; fome of them are very large ; one of themi 
is nearly 200 yards long, and at fome parts about 20 feett 
high. Another of thefe caves, well known by the name off 
the Dropping Cave, or the White Cave of Slains, is vifitedi 
by moft ftrangers, who come near the place, it being juftly • 
efteeraed a rarity. The fea reaches to the mouth of it, att 
high water. Upon entering, one fees the water oozing j 
through a fpungy porous rock on the top and fides, which i 
falls down in pretty large drops, like a very moderate; 
Ihower ; thefe drops are of a remarkable petrifying nature.. 
They gradually and imperceptibly, (not inftantane-- 
oufly, as has been faid.) line the cave with curious fta-- 
ladlitical incruftations, in very different and ftrange forms ; a i 
great deal of thefe incruftations was taken out fome years ; 
ago, and turned into lime. It is again petrified all over, ,

proprietor of the fifli towns, not adverting perhaps to tliefe confequences, 
exchanged his chance of the fifliing for tire whole profits of the ferry* 
boat, on that part of the water, with the proprietor on tlie oppofite fide, 
about 15 years ago.

and has the look of white marble. There are fome others 
of the caves of a petrifying nature, though none fo re- 
markable for that quality as this. 

^tadrupeds and Birds. — The quadrupeds and birds are 
inch the fanaie here as in other parts of Scotland. A 
jreat number of Bohemian chatterers made their appear- 
ance here, in the year 1788. This bird is about the fize of 
bulfinch, with a beautiful top, and the wings tipped with 
[garlet. It was never feen before nor fince in thefe parts,

Agriculture a?id Produce. — The parifh is in general unin- 
lofed,nor dothepeople feem fufficiently fenfible of theadvan- 
ages of inclofmg. They have indeed one great difcourage- 
sent, there being no ftones in the whole parilh ; any thing, 
herefore, that is done in the inclofing way, muft be with 
artben dikes. The ploughs are yoked fome with 4, and fome 
ith 6horfes; others with 4,6, 10, or even 12 oxen* Some 
oke oxen and horfes together. The principal crops are 
ats and barley; there are a few acres of peafe and beans, and 
confiderable quantity of clover and rye-grafs, but little

and red cabbage, greens, &amp;c. are planted in yards *. The 
ftate of this parifti in the years 1782 and 1783, was in ge- 
neral better than that of any other around it. Notwith- 
ftanding the great number 01 fiftiers, had there been no graia 
fold to pay the rents, this parilh could have fupplied the 
parifliioners with bread. The bear was good, and the oat* 
meal whiter and ftronger, as well as more plentiful, than ia 
almoft any other parifti in the country. All kinds of vege- . 
tables, common in the north of Scotland, thrive exceeding- 
ly well here j but there is not a tree in the whole parifh, , 
except a few around the houfe of Captain Gordon of Pit-;, 
lurg, called Gordon Lodge, on his eftate of Lealk. Thefei 
few are of a pretty confiderable fize. This gentleman isi 
every year making fmall plantations that feem to thrivet 
perfeftly well •, but the want of wafte or barren ground inn 
this parifti will never allow great plantations in it. 

Mfl«am— There is a great deal of marl of differen 
Idnds in this parifti, fome of which is very rich, and pro* 
duces excellent crops ; limeftones are always found amongfl 
it, which, when gathered and burned, produce very fin] 
lime. A ridge of irregular hillocks runs acrofs the pariihlj 
which confift of large fand, or rather gravel, mixed witii'J 
fmooth round limeftones, many of them little larger than; 
a man's hand, and none of them larger than one man can-

ftells being found in them. So that the limeftone here has 
a very curious appearance to ftrangers, whether in a whole 
or a broken ftate. This gravel, has of late been ufed, with 
great fuccefs, as a manure for the land in the neighbour- 
hood. Its excellency was difcovered about 20 or 25 years 
ago. They ufed this gravel for repairing the highway be- 
tween Aberdeen and Peterhead, and fome years after were 
furprifed to fee fine white clover, growing very thick on 
thofe places of the joad, which had been repaired with this 
gravel, and every other place as bare as ever. This indu- 
ced them to try the gravel as a manure, which they conti- 
nue to ufe, and find it uncommonly rich and durable. A- 
bout 10 years ago, there was another kind of calcareous 
fand difcovered. This fahd is quite fmall, and has a very 
great proportion of fea-fljells, ground to a powder, amongft 
it. There is plenty of it on many farms, where it produ- 
I ces moft excellent crops, and continues for many years. It 
was firft tried by ^ poor man at fome diftance from the o- 
ther kind. 

Heritors and Rent. — There are only two heritors in the 
1 parilh, which, for ages, has been the propertj'- of the Earls 
of Errol and the Oordons of Pitlurg. The antiquity and 
honours of both thefe families, being univerfally known, 
need not be enlarged upon. It is proper, however, to ob- 
ferve, that, about Martinmas 1791, the Earl of Errol, to 
whom the greater part of the parifh, together with the 
patronage, belonged, fold the whole of his property in this 
parifti, to the late Alexander Callander of Crighton, Efq; 
M. P. Captain Gordon refides in the parilh. The valued 
rent is not exactly known ; the real rent is about L. 1250 
Sterling, and rather on the increafe. The land, not poflfefled 
by the proprietors, is divided among 58 or 60 tenants, at 
various rents, from L. 1 to L. 80 Sterling, or rather more ;

Church, School and Poor. — The flipend is about L 25 Ster- 
ling in money, 2 chalders of bear, and 2 chalders of oat-meal, 
with a glebe of nearly 4 acres. The Rev. Mr William 
Paterson, who is now minifter, is nearly 87 years of age; 
he has be'en fettled here upwards of 42 years, and is highly 
and jullly refpe£led, and efteemed by all within the bounds 
of his parifli.— He enjoys uncommon good health for his 
years, and preaches almoft every other Sabbath, but was 
not able to undergo the fatigue of drawing up this account. 
The church was built in 1599  the manfe in 1761. Major 
John Callander of Crichton is patron. — The fchoolmafter's 
falary is 6 bolls 2 firlots 2 pecks of meal, and los. 7 d. 
Sterling in money. The fchool fees and other perquilites are 
much the fame as in other parilhes in the neighbourhood. 
Scholars taught Latin and arithmetic pay 2s. a-quarter ; 
Englilb and writing i s. 6 d. Sterling. There are but few 
who learn any thing elfe. The number of fcholars, though 
at an average, about 40 in winter, is fcarcely 20 in fummer. 
This difference is chiefly owing to the fea towns, as none 
come from them in fummer, every child from 6 or 7 years 
old being employed about their filliing lines. The year- 
ly colleflions for the poor amount to about L. 18 Sterling. 
There are befides 25 merks Scotch given yearly among 
4 poor families, from a fum mortified by one of the late 
Earls of Errol for that purpofe.

The roads are kept in pretty good repair by the ftatute 
labour, though this is not fully fufficient. There are no 
turnpikes. — There are at prefent 7 ale-houfes or tippling 
lioufes, but two of them are fo only occafionally. Their 
effeft upon the morals of the people i^s in general very im- 
material. Their fale indeed is very mconliderable, unlefs 
from the filhermen's families, who buy their ale every day

they may be laid to live.: — There are fewer perfonal fer-

Services in general haA'e been commuted for money, at 
certain rates, mentioned in the tenant's leafes, for years paft. 
Under tenants work only at mofs and fold ; if they are called

/ work to the farmer they live under, for a fet fee du- 
ring the harveft.. The mills here are all farmed, except 
one, at which tenant^ and under-tenants pay for multure 
the 1 7th peck ; alfo out of the multured grain for fervice,

Propofed Improvements. — The chief, and indeed the only 
effeflual means of betterin^tlre, condition of the people, would 
be to grant them longer leafes, even although it fhould be at a 
rifing rent. In this country, leafes are feldom granted for 
more than 19 years. As the prefent tackfman is far from 
being fure of renewing his leafe, during the laft 3 or 4 years 
of it, he faves all expences, and takes out all the ftrength he 

had

had infufed into his farm, both that he may be compenfs(4 
ted for his paft trouble, and that he may prevent another's s 
being tempted to offer for it. Either he, or another, enters s 
again for 19 years ; if the old, or entering tenant, have not l 
a confiderable Hock, (which is generally the cafe), the one .» 
half of his time, at leaft, is over, before he can have even his 1 
vifield in any tolerable order ; confequently, as he has t 
made nothing of it, he is unable to do any thing to his 1 
outfield. The end of his leafe is at hand, and, as he is not : 
fure to get it renewed, if he has a young family, they i 
muft be fet off to fome bufinefs, that they may provide for.r 
themfelves another way ; and, if poffible, for their parents, , 
who are in great danger of being turned out of their ufual I 
way of making bread, when they are fcarcely able to ap- - 
ply themfelves to any tiling elfe. His leafe being nearly • 
expired, this tackfman, like his predeceffors, begins diredl-- 
ly to take out of his farm what little fubflance he had put • 
in. Thus the land is regularly impoveriflied every 19  
years. But if they had long leafes, even on the condition i 
of an increafing rent, and that at different periods, which . 
would anfwer the proprietor's purpofe equally well, they ' 
could improve with their whole fubftance, and, as foon as i 
their children came up, they would all exert themfelves ; 
upon the farm, as being a fure fource of provifion for their 
family for many years. Thus would the appearance of . 
the country be rendered unfpeakably better, the young ; 
men would be induced to ftay in the place of their nativi- ■

NUMBER XVIII. 
PARISH QF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q219530">INVERARAY</name>, 

(county of argyle.) 

By the Rev. Mr Paul Eraser.</head> 


<p>
Origin of the Name. 

tNvERARAY, in Gaelic, lon-ar-^ao-reidh, is the modem 
name of the parifh. The appellations by which it was 
formerly diftinguillied, viz. Kilmilieu and Gleneray, were 
cither given in confequence of its being the cell of fome 
monk, or from a glen which forms a conliderable part of 
the diflrift. In the Highlands of Scotland, although the 
jiames of rivers are fometimes descriptive of their appear- 
ance, yet this, in many inftances, may be juftly called the 
region of conjedVure. The river which runs by Invera- 
tay, in Gaelic, Ao-reidh, is a contradlion of Ao^ a priva- 
tive (not,) and Reidh, fmooth. This etymology fiiits 
•with the appearance of fome parts of the river at this 
day, and was veiy applicable to the whole of it, before its 
channel was cleared. Ao-rcidh, is evidently contrailed 
^ith Sio-reidh, always fmooth, the n^ame of another river 

near

near the town, remarkable for its fmoothnefs. From Ao. 
reidb, is derived Glenao-reidh, the valley through which 
the river pafles, and lonar-ao reidh, the fla' ground on 
both fides the mouth of the river. It is probable, that 
agriculture was firft attempted on fuch fertile fpots as were 
thus fituated. The name univerfally given in Gaelic to 
fuch pieces of ground, favours this idea. lon-ar (or Inver) 
means, worthy of tillage, from /o«, deferving of, and Ar, 
to till. lon-ar-ao-reidh, may therefore fignify a piece of flat 
fertile ground at the mouth of a rapid rough river ; or, 
Aorath, may fignify unlucky, from the frequent accidental 
drownings, which may be fuppofed to have happened in a 
rapid rough river, before bridges were built on it, and 
which, from the contiguity of the hills, is apt to be over- 
flowed in a very fliort fpace of time, an inftance of which 
happened on the 3d of Auguft 1792, when, in confequence 
of a high flood, falmon and trout were caught on the very 
roads and meadows. ^1 

'Situation, Extent, Fuel, i^c. — Inveraray is the capital of 
Argyleftiire, and near it is one of the feats of the noble 
family of Argyle. It is pleafantly fituated on the fide 
of Lochfyne, in the prefbytery of Inveraray, and provin- 
cial Synod of Argyle. The length of the parifli from 
North to South is about 17 miles; its breadth is va- 
rious, but above 3 miles at an average, and its form 
nearly a crefcent. Its appearance is hilly, and even 
mountainous, though interfperfed with feveral trads of 
flat land, particulary about Inveraray, and the whole of 
Glenfiiira, which is in length about 5 Englilh miles. A 
confiderable part of the high lands in the parifh may be 
called good pafture, particularly Benhuie, where there is 
at prefent one of the beft and largeft Iheep ftocks in the 
Highlands ; but the greater proportion of the hills may be 
called barren. The whole of Glenfiiira, and feveral fields 

near 



of Inveraray.

jiear the caftle of Inveraray, are of a deep rich foil, and 
excellent arable land, yet a very confiderable part is flial- 
lovv, and not naturally fertile ; though that part which lies 
within the Duke of Argyle's domain, has been confidera- 
bly meliorated by cultivation, and particularly by the vaft 
quantities of lime annually laid upon it a fpecies of ma- 
nure well adapted to moft lands of this country, but from 
the ufe of which, all, except the rich and affluent, are al- 
moft totally precluded, by the dearnefs of coals, and the 
fcarcity of other fuel neceffary to bum it. The inhabitants 
are fatisfied, if they can make as many peats as will barely 
ferve their domeftic ufes •, and it is a well known fa£l, 
that, in the year 1790, many were reduced to great ex- 
tremities for want of fuel. The heavy duty, laid on 
coals carried coaftwife, appears to be as unrcafonable as it 
is impolitic, and is univerfally complained of, as an into- 
lerable burden •, and, with refpedl to the whole of Argyle- 
fhire, fo unproduflive that it is not equal to the expence of 
the officers employed in colleding it. There was a plan in 
agitation, a few years agOj for having this grievance re- 
moved by means of a fair commutation, but the project 
feems to have been relinquiflied ; though it were to be hoped, 
that whatever difficulties have formerly occurred, they 
may yet be overcome. A change of the laws in that re- 
fped, would, therefore, be very defirable for until that 
takes place, an infuperable bar lies in the way of every 
improvement in agriculture, and of every eftabliffiment in 
manufa£l;ure. Coals at Inveraray are feldom bought under 
i6 s. per ton, and are often as high as 18 s. 

Climate. — This parifli is in general confidered to be 
healthy, though it is in a rainy climate, which maly be 
partly owing, to the high hills and woods, with which it is 
furrounded. It has been remarked, that after good fiffi- 

VoL. V. O o ing 



290 Statijlical Account 

ing feafons, the lower Ibrt of people have been liable to 
epidemical fevers and fluxes, probably in confequence of 
their excefs in eating too much, of a rich and nourifhing 
food, fo different from the fpare diet they are accuftomed 
to, during the greater part of the year. 

Rivers and ProfpeEis. — The run of the water of Ao- 
reidh before it lofes itfelf in Lochfyne, is about 8 Englifli 
miles. It takes its courfe partly through rugged and un- 
even ground, covered •vVith wood, and forms feveral natu- 
ral cafcades, that, in wet weather particularly, cannot fail 
to ftrike the ear as well as the eye of the traveller. At 
fome dillance from the caftle, the valley opens to a confi- 
derable extent, and the traveller is prefented with rich 
meadows, interfperfed with ftately trees of various kinds. 
Here the river as well as the grounds affume a new and 
pleafing appearance, formed both by the hand of art and 
of tafte. In this part of the river, there are many beautiful 
artificial cafcades, which, together with Lochfyne, Duni- 
coich, (which is covered with wood to the height of 700 
feet perpendicular), the banks towards Effachofan and the 
diftant hills and mountains, form together fuch an aflem- 
blage of grand and beautiful objects as are rarely to be 
leen. Indeed, in regard to extent of pleafure ground, and 
of fine plantations, hardly any place can vie with Invera- 
ray. At two feafons in the year in particular, the profpedl 
is highly variegated, and truly delightful ; and fuch- is the 
refort of travellers to it, that in 1790, a hundred have 
viewed it in the fpace of one week, and in 1792 that num- 
ber has been doubled in the fame fpace of time. — This 
perhaps, may not be confidered as ftriftly fpeaking analo- 
gous to the ftatiftical account of the parifti : at the fame 
time, it would have been unpardonable, to have paffed over 

in 



of Inveraray. 291 

in filence, a place which is fo defervecUy an obje£l of curiofity 
to travellers of all ranks \ and the defcription would 
have been much more extended, had not the mafterly pens 
of a Kames and a Pennant rendered fuch an attempt un- 
neceffary.— The only other confiderable river in this pa- 
rilli is the water of Shira, which glides fmoothly through 
the rich deep glen of that name. Its banks are in a ftate 
of high cultivation, and yield luxuriant crops of hay, corn, 
and barley. It difcharges itfelf into the only freih water 
lake in this parifli, which is worthy of notice : It is called 
the Bubh Loch, from the darknefs of its bottom, or the 
depth of its water. This lake has a communication with 
the fea by a fmall river, about a quarter of a mile in 
length, and which, with high tides, is navigable for fifliing 
boats. Owing to this circumftance, it is not uncommon, 
that herring and other fait water fifh, fuch as cod, whi- 
tings, mackarel and flounders, are caught in the fame 
draught net with falmon and trouts, the native fifh of the 
lake. 

Coaji, Lake, and Fijh.—Th&amp; fea coaft of the parifli is 
miles in extent, and is in general flat, except about two 
miles at the fouth end, where it is high and rocky. The 
fea ware on the coaft is of the ordinary fort, and is only 
ufed for manure. That part of Lochfyne, by which this pa-

immemorial noted for its herrings, which are fuperior in 
quality to any found in the weflern feas. The harbour of 
Inveraray was anciently called Slochk Ichopper, which 
means the Gullet where vefTels bought or bartered for fifh ; 
and there is ftill reprefented in the Shield of the town 
of Inveraray's Arms, a net with a herring, with this motto,

French merchants ufed to come and barter their wines for 
herrings, as there is a point of land, about 3 miles fouth of 
Inveraray, ftill called the Frenchman's point ; and the tradi- 
tion of the country is, that it was to that particular fpot 
the herrings were in ufe to be brought, in order to be cured 
and fold. The herring fifliing commonly begins in the* 
month of July, and has been known to continue till the firft 
of January. In fome years, when herrings came in a con- 
fiderable body, there have been at leaft 500 boats employed 
m catching them, each boat having 4 men at an average. 
From the beft information, it is beheved, there have been 
canght and cured in fome feafons 20,000 barrels, valued then 
at 15 s./)fr barrel. Lochfyne is alfo famous for haddocks, 
whitings, cod, %lc. and is well adapted for fifliing, having a 
clean bottom and no banks or hidden rocks. Its depth may 
be from 30 to 100 fathoms, 

Fojfils. — The only remarkable foflil in this parifh is the 
rtone, of which a great part of the caftle is built, which is 
taken fi om a quarry about 4 miles fouth of Inveraray. It 
is of a blue colour, and ranked under the micaceous clafs of 
Hones. There is likewife a quarry of grey clouded marble, 
a mile north of Inveraray, out of which fome confiderable 
blocks have been taken, but of a middling quahty. 

Poptilation- — The population of the parifli of Inveraray, 
has confiderably decreafed, within thefe 40 years. THfe caufe 
of this decreafe is principally owing to the lafl: enumeration, 
fent to Dr Webfter, having been made up, about the time 
when the caftle of Inveraray was linifliing, which required 
a great number of hands, that became no longer neceffary, 
when it was completed. The following table, exhibits its 
prcfent ftate, as accurately as could poffibly be afcertained,

of the Duke of Argyle •, but if wholly let to farmers, it is 
believed, it might be worth about L. 2400 Sterling, belides

The whole parilh is the property of the Duke of Argyle,.^ 
except two farms, which belong to three fmall heritors. 

Town of Inveraray. — The town, except one houfe or tencri 
ment,alfo belongs to the Duke, who gives leafes, for three 19 
years, of ground to build upon, to the inhabitants, at a fmaH. 
rent ; but, as many of the inhabitants could not afford to l»i 
at that espence, his Grace has built a confiderable parti 
of the town himfelf, from which he draws in all a rent i 
L. 372 : 2 : 6 per amtum. About 15 years ago, the ol| 
town, which was fituated on the north end of the bay, wi 
removed, and a new town was built on the fouth end of it?' 
and, if the ftreets were completed, no town in the kingdonij 
of its dimenfions, would make a better appearance. T 
houfes are commodious and well built, and there is not 01 
thatched houfe in the whole of it. It is probable that thi 
town of Inveraray was little more than a place for fiflieri 
men, who lived by their occupation, prior to the beginni 
of the fourteenth century, about which time the family 
Argyle fixed upon it as the place of their refidence. 
what period it was confidered as the county town, is uncen 
taiu*. Its becoming fo, muft have been a confequence oii

* Though few places are better adapted to gratify the eye of a 
veller of tafte, yet tlaere is little to engage the refcarches of the antiJ 
quarian, or to throw much light upon hiftory. There are no remains: 
of any ancient buildings or obelilks, except the veftiges of one of tht. 
old forts fo common in the Highlands, which may be traced at Duni- 
coich, and one large ftone at fome diftance from the front of the DukeMj 
of Argyle's caftle, with regard to which there is no tradition.-' 
Among the more recent events in this parifh may be mentioned the: 
fuffeiings and execution of many of tli€ name of Campbell, (fome of them J 
people of family and fortune), at Inveraray in the 1685, for their firm a -M

the hereditary jurifdidHons of Jufliclary and Sheriff-fliip, 
with which the family of Argyle were, for fome centuries 
nvefted, as their courts would fall, in general, to be held at 
Inveraray. It was erefted into a royal burgh by charter 
from King Charles I. dated at Cariftrook caftle, in the Ifle of 
Wight, 28th January 1648. The only revenues belonging 
to it, as a burgh, arife from the petty cuftoms, (among which 
included a fmall toll on cattle paffing through the burgh, 
the lowland or Englifli markets, the number of 
pvbich, may amount, at an average, to about 4000,) and the 
■ent of a common, which, from the firft eredlion of the 
mrgh, has been bellowed upon it by the family of Argyle. 
Joth thefe articles may amount to about L. 30 Sterling an- 
ually. About 42 years ago, Archibald Duke of Argyle, 
eeing how inadequate this revenue was for the occafions of 
he Burgh, added to it a perpetual annuity of L. 20 per an- 
um, for which he granted fecurity upon his eftate. 

Cajlle. — Although the family of Argyle, upon their co- 
ning to Inveraray, conformed to the cuftoms of the times, by 
■ juilding a very large and ftrong caftle, within a fmall di- 
i llance of the prefent one, towards the river, (which has 
mly been pulled down within thefe 24 years) ; yet it does 
lot appear, that for many ages, they did any thing conlider- 
ible, towards the improvement or embellifliment of the 
)lace, till about the middle of the laft century, when the 
vlarquis of Argyll, began to plant a few trees, fome of 

which 

■lerence to the Prelbyterian intereft. As a tribute due to their memory, 
a monument is eredted at Inveraray, near tlie centre of the town. Such 
was the barbarity which marked thofe times, that the plantations and 
' I'rferies at Inveraray were then almoft totally deftroyed. It ought alfo 

ie remarked, that by the wife and vigorous exertions of Lord Iflav, 
burgh of Inveraray was fecured, when General Gordon, with an army 

3000 men, came to fuiprife it, in 171 5.

which are ftill extant. It is probable, that he was early di- 
verted from this purpofe, by the confufion of the times, and 
that nothing was afterwards done, till the re-eftablifhment 
of the Earl his fon, fome time between the 1663 and 1670. 
During the fliort period of his poffeffion, it appears, that he 
had particularly bent his thoughts towards beautifying the 
family feat, and almoft the whole of the old trees about In- 
veraray, are of his planting, and ftill remain a lingular in- 
ftance of his good tafte and difcernment, refpefting that 
which was beft adapted to the nature of the foil and cUmate. 
Some of the moft admired avenues, rows of trees, and 
plantations, are of his defigning, and plainly {how, had he li^ 
ved longer, that much would have been done, upon a very 
large fcale, even at that early period. Since the beginning 
of the prefent century, the feveral fucceffors to the eftate 
and honours of Argyle, have been particularly attentive to 
extend their plantations, and to embellifh the place. 
bout the year 1 745, the prefent caftle was begun, by Archi- 
bald Duke of Argyle, and. after a fliort interruption du- 
ring the rebellion, it was refumed and finiflaed. Since that 
time, a great fum was annually expended by him, by his 
fuccelTor the late Duke, and by the prefent, in making ex- 
tenfive inclofures, in ,building, planting, improving, ma- 
king roads, (which in this parifli are highly finifhed, and 
kept in excellent repair,) and in other works of utiUty and 
decoration. It is faid, that the fums laid out at Inveraray, 
fmce the 1745, do now amount to the enormous fum oi. 
L. 250,000, and that the prefent Duke, fmce his acceflionxl 
to the eftate, has expended at the rate of at leaft L. 3000:) 
per annum. Happily for his family and his country, New^^ 
market had not engroffed his attention ; and hence a con^a 
fiderable part of his great revenue was fortunately employ-;' 
ed, for more ufeful purpofes, in promoting the general im-s 
provement of his eftates, in giving employment to the poor^^ 

anc-; 



of Inveraray. 



and in extending induftrj and manufactures. Thus, alfo, he 
was enabled to give liis lands to his tenants, on reafonable 
terms ; and hence, if they are fober and induftrious, none, in 
their ftation of life, need live more comfortably. Accord- 
ingly, the numerous tenantry on his Grace's eftates, are fo 
much fatisfied with their fituation, and fo much attached to 
their great proprietor, who even, in thefe peaceable times, 
refufes to liften to any propofals of an augmentation of 
rent from Ihepherds or ilore-maftei-s, which might have a ten- 
dency (unlefs when conduced on proper principles *,) to 
difpoflefs the natives, and to difpeople the country, that, 
were it neceflary, there is, perhaps, no fubjeft in Great Bri- 
tain, who could bring fo great a number of perfons into the 
field, in defence of his Sovereign and. of his country. 

ManufaBures. — Archibald Duke of Argyll, about the 
year 1748, introduced the linen manufaflure into this pa 
rilh, which has fince been attended with beneficial confe- 
quences to the country; and, about the year 1776, the 
prefent Duke firll eftabiiflied an woollen manufafture, ha- 
ving, at a very confiderable expence, built houfcs, erefted 
machinery, and provided every material neceflary for car- 
rying it on fuccefsfully, at the water of Douglas. At the 
fame time, his Grace, as an additional encouragement, gave 
the farm upon which the fa£lory was built, at a very low 
rent, took fome fliares in tjie concern, and did every thing 
in his power, to infure fticcefs to fo patriotic an iindertaking. 
The plan was alfo feconded by many gentlemen of the 
county, who advanced money to the manufadlurer at 2\ per 
cent, interefl. Notwithftanding which, and, that his 
Grace gave the ufe of the whole buildings and utenfils gra-

its, the bufinefs was not conduced with advantage. It b 
ftill, however, carried on, and the prefent occupiei has the 
fame encouragement which his predeceffors enjoyed. The 
want of fpinners is what he principally complains of, which, 
in a great meafure, may be accounted for, by the time ta- 
ken up in fo moill a climate, in preferving their peats. That 
is almoil the only fuel at prefent in the country. In pre- 
paring them, females are chiefly employed, and they are of- 
ten the principal work to be attended to for feveral months. 
This imavoidably interferes with, and retards the bufmefs 
of the whole year, and is, infadl, a very greatobftacle to all 
improvement in this country, the bell part of the fcafon be-.' 
ing thus confumed in providing fuel *. 

Commerce. — The quay, fcarcely deferves that name, as it 
does not at prefent anfwer the intended purpofe. Were 
there, however, a little addition .made to it, it would be a\ 
fafe and commodious harbour. There is one veffel belong-

* In tlieyear 17S4, a company from LancaCiire, under the firm of the 
Argyll Furnare Company, ereifled a blaft furnace for fmelting of iron 
ore, by means of woo ' charcoal, in the fouthern extremity of this paiilli. \ 
They were much encouraged by the late Archibald Duke of Argyll, who ; 
gave them a tack of three cuttings of his wooils, in this and feme other 
pariflies, upon very reafonable terms. The Company import ore and iron- % 
ftene in vefiels of their own, from the weft of England, which they return 
loaded with pig iron of very fuperior quality, timber, oak-bark, &amp;c. 
The eftabli/hment of this Company was particularly advantageous to this 
country, in railing the price of woods, and ferviceable, in giving employ- 
ment and bread, to a confiderable number of hands, both male and female, 
annually employed in cutting and peeling the woods and making char- 
coal. The bufinefs of this Company, is believed to be carried on, much to 
the advantage of all concerned, and with the good-will and to the great 
fatisfaflion of all who had any dealings with them. For many years paft 
it has been coiidudled by Mr Jofeph Latham, proprietor of a confider- 
able (hare in it, whofe attention, candour, and humanity, have gained him 
univerfal efteem as a valuable member of fociety.

X dozen fmall veffels, moftly employed in importing meal, 
coals, porter, and merchant goods, and in exporting wool, 
oak-bark, and timber. Were the coal-duty aboliflied, the 
wool of the country would, in time, be manufadtured at 
home. 

Pro^///«— .Corn, hay, and potatoes, are the principal crops 
raifed in this parifh, the foil, in general, being too wet for 
barley. The climate and foil feem well adapted to the 
cultivation of turnips, as the fly and drouglits, which are fo 
unfriendly to this plant in other countries, are unknown 
here. The grain raifed in the parifli is, by no means fufE- 
I cient for the confumption of the inhabitants. The town 
and parilh are chiefly fupplied with meal from the Clyde, 
Dumfries, or Ireland ; and there are annually imported, 
from 8000 to 10,000 bolls, part of which is carried to fome 
of the neighbouring pariflies. Meal, in general, is as high 
priced here as in any part of the kingdom *. 

Animals. — A breed of the beft Highland cattle in this 
ountry, are reared at Inverary, where there are alfo fome

* There are no re_2;ular markets in the parifli for bu cher's meat,

ccommodations, which moft of the principal inhabitants of Inveraray enjoy, 
y their having low rented farms from the Duke of Argyll. From the farm 
of Stronfliira alfo, it is intended to fupply the town with milk and butcher's

cattle at the Highland dairy, are worth about L. lo each,

near 600, may be worth L. 8 at an average. Here are al- 
fo fome Englifli flieep of the Bakewell breed, fome of the 
Linton, many of the fmall Highland kind, and a Spanifli ram. 
At Benbuie there is a confiderable flieep ftock of the Gal- 
loway black-faced breed. The fbeep and cattle ofthe parifli 
in general, are not of a fuperior quality or value to thofe of 
the iieighbourliood. The diftrift abounds with game, par- 
ticularly deer, roes, hares, heath-fowls, and groufe. 

Ecclejtajlical State. — The Duke of Argyll is patron of 
both livings. The family of Argyll have at all times 
countenanced the clergy, particularly the minifters of this 
plstce, and ha-ve uniformly accommodated them with farms 
at alow rent, near the town, indeed on fuch moderate terms, 
as fcarcely to have exceeded a twentieth part of their va- 
lue. The livings are good, though the amount of them 
cannot be exaftly afcertained at prefent ; they arife from 
the teinds of theparilh, now exhaufted, (which have been 
voluntarily given up by the Duke of Argyll,) and from 
the Bifliop's teinds in the gift of the Synod *. Both mini-

« Upon this fubjetSt it may be obferved, that a Committee of Parlia- 
ment for the valuation of the teinds of Argyllfliire, fat at Inveraray in 
1629-33, and reported an accurate ftatenient of tlie fame ; which forms 
at pi efeiit part of the records of the Teind-office at Edinburgh, and is uni- 
formly approven of by the High Court of tlie Commiffion of Teinds in 
Scotland. The minutes of the proceedings of this Committee, are ftill 
extant, and in tlie poffeflion of the Synod of Argyll, then defigned the 
Provincial Aflembly of Argyll, which met regularly twice every year 
from the 1639 to the 1661, and went through much bufinefs with great 
deliberation, and witliout being molefted or interrupted by the com- 
motions and troubles, which at that time prevailed in Scotland. Ano-

le proceedings of tliis Committee, which are ftill preferved in the poflef- 
fion of the Synod of Argyll, a regular report of their decrees was made 
out, and authenticated, which alfo remained in the polTeffion of the Synod, 
until of late years, that it was brought from them, by warrant of the Court 
of Seffion, and alfo lodged in tlie l eind-office. Many of the benefices and 
livings of the minifters m the Ihire of Argyll, at this day, are founded 
ijpon.no other title than thefe decreets. The parifli of Gleneray in par- 
ticular, was thereby disjoined, and eredled into two diftindl charges, name- 

,-, tlie Highland charge, which was given to the firlt minifter of the pa- 
rifli, and the Lowland or Englifli congregation, which was given to the 
lecond. Fart of the provifion of the latter was compofed of 3 chalders 
vidlual, payable out of the Bifliop teinds of Bute, the teinds of the parifli 
itfelf being inadequate to the ftipend payable to the fecond minifter. 
Thefe 3 chalders were regularly received by him, from the 1652 to the 
J 724; but the Earl of Bute, having obtained a grant from the (. rown of 
all the teinds of the Ifle of Bute, he withheld payment of thefe 3 chalders. 
The Synod acquiefced in this grant, not knowing that it was out of the 
power of the Crown, without confent of Parliament, to difpofe of the 
bifliop's rents, or grant any deed fo as to invalidate the decreet of locali- 
ty 1651, in favour of the charge of the Lowland congregation at Inve- 
raray ; which decree had been awarded by a Commilhon fpecially ap- 
pointed by Parliament 1649 ; was confirmed by the refciifory adls (61) an- 
no x66i, and (28) anne 1663, and the adts 1689 atid 1690 ; was approven 
of by the High Commiffion ift December 1690, and fortified by the horn- 
ing i69r, the acl of treafury, in July following, and uninterrupted poflef- 
fion from the 1651 to tlie 1661, and from the 1698 to the 1714- ^"t, in 
a procefs brought at the inftance of the minifter before the Court of Sef- 
fion, in 1770, for the recoveiy of thefe 3 chalders, the caufe was un- 
fortunately argued by both parties, as if the decreet in his favour, had been 
pronounced by the High Commiffion for Plantation of Churches, whicli 
always fat at Edinburgh, without ever attending, that in fadl the decreet 
had iflued from a commiffion of Parliament, appointed for the province 

of Argylc, by the unprinted ftatute 1 649, which actually fat at Inveraray 
for the years 1650 and 1651, and carried on bufinefs as if no civil war had

charge has alfo an allowance for a glebe. There are two 
good commodious manfes built about 14 years ago, with 
fufficient ofFice-houfes. Since the demolition of the old 
town, there have been only temporary places of worfhip. 
Two new churches, under one roof, are to be built 
next feafon. The defign, by Mr Milne of London, is partly- 
Gothic ; it is ornamented by a handfome fpirc of 107 
feet in height, riling from the centre of the building, and the 
whole is calculated to unite elegance with utility and conve- 
nience. 

Schools. — The Englifh fchool has been long well attend- 
ed ; and, for feveral years paft, there have been, at an a- 
verage, about 8o fcholars in winter, and 60 in fummer. , 
The falary amounts to L. 19 : 3 : 4, befides quarterly fees, ; 
and other perquifites ; and a fmall allowance for a Sunday 
fchool, which has been kept about 7 years, and is well at- 
tended. The grammar fchool, has not, of late, been fo well 
attended as at fome former periods. This may be attribu- 
ted, chiefly to the great number of private teachers, of late 
employed in the education of youth, and partly to the ex- 
pence of boarding, which is high at Inveraray. The fala- - 
ry amounts to L. 31 : 11 : 8, befides quarter fees and perqui- 
fites. The fchoolmafters have each a houfe, garden, and 

grals 

tlien exifted. This comraon error of parties, is laid to have been fatal to 
the caufe. On the report of the Lord Ordinary, grounded on a hi- 
ftorical detail of the iinpradlibility of the High Court of CommilTion ha- 
ving fat at Edinburgh, on the date of the decreet, (which correfponded 
with the time the caftle of Edinburgh was in pofleffion of Crorawell's 
troops, and no CommilTion of the Scotch Parliament fitting at Edinburgh,) 
the Court of Seffion, not attending to the common miftake of parties, 
conchided the decreet fpurious, and gave fentence of redudlion in favour 
of Lord Bute, fetting it afule as void. This annihilation, of fo much of 
the proviCou for the minifter, of the fecond charge of the parilh, after 
being in pofleffion of it from 1651 to 1724, points out the danger of relt- 
ing judgments in courts of law, upon conjedtures or nice criticifms, with- 
out examining into facfls.

-rafs for a cow, gratis, from the family of Argyll. A fe- 
.iiale academy has been inltituted here this feafon. His 
Grace, ever attentive to what might redound to the benefit 
of the town and county, has generoufly made an addition to 
the falary from the burgh, befides a good and commodious 
houfe, rent free, as an encouragement to the miftrefs of the 
academy, by whom are taught the ufeful and ornamental 
branches of female education ; and, as every precaution has- 
been ufed, to obtain a perfon properly cjualiiied, it is hoped 
:fiat this inftitution will be of confiderable benefit, both to 
the town and the county in general-, and, though the opinion 
may appear fomewhat lingular, it is believed, that good 
breeding, as well as a liberal education, may be acquired in 
fmall, as well as in large focieties. There is a fociety fchool 
I in Gleneray : The number of fchdlars who attend it may be 

bout 35 for the one half of the year ; but a third part of 
that number do not attend conftantly the other half. The 
Duke of Argyll allows a falary to a fchoolmafter, who' 
teaches near the bridge of Douglas, where the woollen ma- 
nufadory is eftabliflied. There is alfo a fchool at the fur- 
nace, in the fouthern extremity of the parifh,

from L. 40 to L. 50 Sterling; but, as this is not adequate to 
the maintenance of about 40 perfons, who are on the poor's,

more than tripled their rents, many of the eftablifhed clergy |j

danger of lofing their rank, ufefulnefe and influence in the 
fcale of fociety. In this parifh the munificence of the no- 
ble patron has left no ground for this remark ; yet he muft 
be totaUy void of all fenfibility, who would not feel for 
fuch as have been thus fituated, and whofe lines have been 
caftinlefspleafant places*— As an inftance of longevity 
in this parifh, it may be mentioned^ that Provoft Brown, 
late of Inveraray, when . 100 years old, headed one of the 
contending parties at a Jhinty match, (a game peculiar to 
North Britain, fomething fimilar to the golf,) and carried the 
town's colours in proceflion among the vidors. He died in 
the ii6th year of his age.— It isbelieVed that the farmers of 
a country, when not opprefled by too heavy rents, are among 
the moft happy, and, upon the whole, the moft virtuous clafs 
of the community. To diminilh their number, by the union of 
farms, will neither add to the population, nor to the morals 
of a ftate, though it may augment the rent roll of an eftate, 
particularly one, better adapted for pafture than cultivation. 
On the other hand, to fubdivide farms into very fmall fepa- 
rate lots, unlefsthefe be occupiedby artificers or day-labourers, 
who will have it in their power, conftantly to earn day wages, 
when not ufefuUy employed on their poffeffions, muft be 
equally prejudicial to the interefts of proprietors and pof- 
feffbrs. In this, as in all other matters, extremes ought 
to be avoided. It were devoutly to be wiflied, that the 
general improvement of the country were promoted as 
much as poflible ; and, it is believed, that it would have a

happy efFeft, if proprietors would encourage and reward the 
indultry of farmers more than fome of them do, by allowing 
them a greater ftiare of the fruits of their labour. At pre- 
fent, that is far from being always the cafe \ the principal, 
if not the fole view of many proprietors being, to augment 
their rents^and to fleece their tenants as much as poffible. In 
this, indeed, they are often too fuccefsful ; for it is a well 
known fa£t, that very many of that valuable clafs of men-, 
after a life of hard labour and abftemloufnefs, without any 
other vifible caufe, but folely the high rents they pay, die 
poorer than when they firft became farmers. There can be 
no doubt, but that fliort leafes, muft be detrimental to the 
improvement of a country, as well as farmers changing their 
poffeflionsy fo often as they do in many places. At the fame 
time, to introduce ftrangers endued with knowledge in a- 
griculture, and poffefled of fubftance, may be attended with 
beneficial confequences. Thefe remarks, however, do not 
apply to the fituation of the people in this parifli ; for many 
of the prefent farmers are the defcendants of thofe who have 
occupied the fame lands for many generations. 

Character. — The Scotch Highlanders, in general, as well as 
the natives of this county and parilh, in particular, are a high 
fpirited, generous, and brave race of people. From the nature 
of their country and climate, as well as their' early habits, 
they are inured to bear wet and cold, fatigue and hunger ; and 
confequently are well qualified to fuftain the hardfliips of 
the field, and have ever been diftinguilhed for their adivity 
and valour, in every quarter of the globe. They feem 
not averfe to a military life, and have proved an excellent 
nurfery to the Britifh army. During the laft war, it may 
be proper to mention, that a battalion of the 71ft, almofl: 
the whole of the 74th, and the Weft Fencibles, were chiefly 
levied in the county of Argyle, towards which the parift 
of Inveraray largely contributed its proportion. — ^With re- 
gard 



of Inveraray, 



gard to their religious opinions, all the people of this parifh 
are of the Eftabliflied Church. They are, in general, humane 
and peaceable, orderly and decent in their behaviour; 
and there are ftill perfons living who remember them 
diftinguiflied for their good attendance on divine worfliip, 
and for their decent obfervance of the Sabbath. At prefent, 
though they merit no peculiar commendation cn that 
head, yet it is not meant to convey any particular ceKiure 
on them, as being lefc attentive in this refpeft, than tha peo- 
ple of other pariflies. It is certain, at the fame time,^ that 
the daily refort and frequent interccurfe, which they have, 
with their more fouthern neighbours, though attended with 
many beneficial confequences, yet has unfortunately been 
produftive of one evil ; namely, that a lefs ftria regard 
' to the inftitutions of religion, feems to be gradually gain- 
ing ground, through the fecret,but powerful influence of bad 
example, in the conduft of the greater number of thofe 
(for there are exceptions) who, from all parts of Britain, as 
well as from other countries, come to view a place, fo high- 
ly deferving the attention of every traveller of curiofity, 
tafte, or obfervation. Whatever refpeft thefe ftrangers may 
Ihew to the religion of their country, when at their refpec- 
tive homes, they feem to confider it here, as a matter of in- 
difference, whether, as travellers, they may not employ Sun- 
day as a day of amufement, or of travelling. But if, at any pe- 
riod, the lower ranks of men, come to difregard the inftitu- 
tions of religion, as much as thefe fafliionable travellers do, it 
-can hardly be doubted, that very fatal confequences will en- 
fue to fociety. — A regard to the rules of temperance, may 
be juftly faid to prevail, particularly among the people of 
condition. Too lavifli an ufe of fpirits, has been often com- 
plained of, amongft the inferior ranks. Dram-drinking, 
however, though ftill too much pra£lifed, particularly by 
females of the lowefl: xlafs, is happily lefs prevalent than

a pradlice could be completely abolifhed. — No inftance of 
fuicide has been heard of in this diftrid ; and though Inver- 
aray, be one of the feats for the Courts of Judiciary, when 
going their circuits, as well as of a Sheriff court, few crimi- 
nal trials occur-, and it is very remarkable, that fince the 
year 1754, there has been no public execution.</p>

but is not navigable. 

Cultivation,' Produce, i^c. — The produftions of the parift ; I 
are barley, oats, peas, turnips, and potatoes. It does much i 
more than fupplj itfelf with provifions. The grain is ge- . 
nerally fold at Aberdeen, or at Newburgh, for exporta- 
tion ; the butter, cheefe and poultry, at Aberdeen. The ! 
oats fown in March and April, are generally reaped in i 
September and Oftober ; the barley fown in April and i 
May, is reaped, about the end of Auguft, and firft of Sep. . 
tember. There are 50 acres of Scotch firs at Tolquhon, , 
fome of them of confiderable lize, planted above 50 years 5 ^ 
ago •, with fome afhes and planes. There are no ^other r ^ 
woods in the parifh. P; 

Proprietors and Rent. — ^The valued rent is L. 488a 1 '• 
Scotch ; the real rent about L. 2000 Sterling ; but, as a 1 ^ 
confiderable part of the rent, is payable in oat-meal, bear, . »' 
and feveral cuftoms and fervices, it cannot be precifely af» - 
certained. — There are only two proprietors ; the Earl o0 
Aberdeen, and Hugh Forbes Efqj of Shives : The latter r vj' 
is the only refiding heritor. 

Chiirc/j, School and Poor.— The ftipend is 104 bolls 3:ji 
pecks oat-meal; la bolls 2 firlots 3 pecks bear, and ij si 
L. 40 Scotch, paid from the lands of Tolquhon, as the con- fi

<p>Name, Extent j Surface^ and Soil. 

THE parilh of Currie lies about 6 miles W. of E- 
dinburgh. It includes a traft of country from 5 to 
6 miles in every direSion, but its greateft extent is from 
E. to W. where it advances even to 9 miles in length. 
It may be confidered as claffic ground, being fititated in 
the neighbourhood of that little romantic dale^ that form- 
ed the fcene of the Gentle Shepherd, the favourite pafto- 
ral of the Scotch nation. From its name, (anciently Ko-

name of this parifh alfo has probably given rife to the fir- 
name of Corrie or Currie ; for anciently it was the prac* ' 
tice for men of property to take their firnaroes from the 
lands they poflefled, of which there are numerous ex- 
amples in Scotland ; while, in modern times, we find this 
cuftom reverfed, men of property being now more inclined 
to confer their firnames on the property they acquire. 

Situation and Climate. — The fituation of this parifii is 
very elevated. At Ravelrig, about the middle of it, (but 
by no means the highefl: point,) it is, according to a late 
very accurate meafurement, not lefs than 800 feet above ' 
the level of the fea. This extreme height, and its vici- .! 
nity to the range of the Pentland Hills, renders it cold and 
damp, and, what is a remarkable proof of the moifture of 
the atmofphere, there is almoft no houfe in the parifh, 
however high its fite, but difplays marks of this ftate of the . 
climate internally on the walls. In fpite of this, however, \ 
it is pretty healthy, which may be confidered as an effed ! 
of the conftant winds that prevail here, and carry off thofe 
feeds of difeafe, which are generated by the cold and 
dampnefs of the climate. Rheumatifm feems the chief 
diforder to which its inhabitants are fubjeft. But if oc- 
cafional difeafes are not frequent, yet the conftitutional 
diforder of fcrophula, which is ftill worfe, is very preva- 
lent here, and the fame remark may be extended, it is be- 
lieved, to all the pariflies where the climate is cold and 
damp, and where the living of the inhabitants is poor, and 
principally of the vegetable kind. The miferies this dif- 
order .

the manor of Inglefton, from a pillar dug up there, which place is like-

:order produces to fociety, would, in many places in Scot- 
-land, feem to require the interference of the Legiflature, 
to prevent, if pollible, its increafe. 

Population. — The population of this parifh is not equal 
lo its extent, or even to what it was abont 60 or 70 years 
=ago. In the year 1720, it is faid to have contained about 
1800, though that nuiTiber is merely conjeftural. Since 
that time, it is fuppofed to have decreafed confiderably *. 
Its prefent amount is 1300, of whom 200 have been add- 
ed, only within thefe 4 or 5 years, by the introduftion of 
the paper manufadlure. The return to Dr Webfter in 
1755 was only 1227 fouls. The proportion of married 
people, and fingle perfons, is, at prefent, pretty nearly e- 

qual ; 

-* The decreafe of population here may be afcribed to feveral caufes. 

r. The firft and leading one here, as well as elfewhere, has been the 
extenfion of farms, by which feveral fmall ones have been fu^allowed up 
in one large one. This caufe has operated very powerfully in thinning 
the inhabitants in the upper parts of the parifli, where there is now much 
pflfture ground. At prefent there are only three villages in the parilh, 
Currie, Balemo and Hermifton ; but formerly there were a great many 
more, though of lefler note ; and many different places, where, in th-e 
beginning of this century, from 20 to 30 families refided, are now with- 
out an inhabitant. 

2. A fecond caufe of depopulation has been the eredion of toll-bars, 
and improvement of roads. About 40 years ago, fo bad were the roads 
m this parifli, that eveiy thing was conveyed on horfeback. In carrying 
hay, for example, to Edinburgh, each horfe load was lo ftones, and one 
man had the care of two horfes ; fo that to tranfport 150 ftones that far, 
required then the affiitance of 15 liorfes and 7 men, which is performed 
now by a common cart, with a pair of horfes and one man. 

3. The modern improvements in hufbandry have been attended with 
the fame effedt. Formerly four horfes were requifite for one plough, 
with a man to drive tliem. Now two are deemed fufficient, and they are 

trained 



3i6 Statijlical Account 

qual ; and, except thofe employed in the paper manufac- 
ture, and a few mechanics of different occupations, not cxt 
ceeding la, the reft of the inhabitants are confined to the 
bufinefs of agriculture. In their religious opinions, one 
half of the parifla are Seceders, which occafions a confider- 
able decreafe in the weekly coUeftions at the church. 

; Kcclejiajlical State. — The ftipend, including the value 
of the glebe, (which confifts of a fmall inclofure pf four a- 
cres,) does not exceed L. loo Sterling. It is paid partly 
in grain, and partly in money. On that account, it has 
rather of late years been on the rife. The patronage o£ 
the church may be difputed, but the Town-council of E- 
dinburgh have for fome time paft aflumed the right of no- 
mination. The parilh feems originally tq have belonged 
to the collegiate church of Corftorphine, dedicated to St 

John 

tra.'ned to go without a driver. The fame may be inftanced in many o- 
ther departments of hufbandry. 

4. A fourth and very powerful caufe has been, the preference given 
of late to the occupation of the mechanic, over that of the huftandr 
man. For here, as in all fituations near a great town, where manufacr 
tures are flourifhing, the young generation, tempted by higher encou-. 
ragement, have forfaken the employment of agriculture, the inconveni- 
encies,of which were more immediately before their eyes, and have en- 
tered into a new life, the profpe(fls of which are more promifing. Hence 
the number bred to agriculture in this parifh is very fmall, in proportion 
to whsct it was formerly. 

S- To thefe general caufes of depopulation, a fifth and peculiar one 
here may be added, viz. the fuppreflion of fmuggling. As this part of the 
country, is the opening to the fliire of Ayr, (the chief feat of that trade,) 
it formed the retreat of thofe adventurers engaged in it, when bringing 
their goods to Edinburgh, being at a convenient diftance, fo that when a 
fit opportunity offered, they could eafily tranlport them. Hence that clan- 
deftine commerce added formerly to the nufnbers of this parifli, efpecia\- 
ly in the remote parts of it.

John the Baptift, and founded by Sir John Forrefter. E- 
ven fo late as the reign of Charles I. it does not appear to 
l^jive been a feparate parifli, for no mention of it is made 
ip the Royal decree of the Eredion of the See of Edin- 
burgh, though all the adjoining pariflies are noticed *. 
fhe prefent kirk is a neat modern edifice, built a few 
years ago. It is fituated on a height above the village of 
Gjirrie, on the fouth fide of the water of Leith, and the 
Ipire, rifing out of a clump of ancient plane and afli trees, 
that grow on the banks of the river, exhibits at a diftance, 
when they are in leaf, a very beautiful and pifturefque ap- 
pearance. 

School. — The falary of the parifli fchoolmafter here, 
with his different perquilites, amounts to from L. i6 to 
%. 20 per amutm, independent of his fees. He has gene- 
rally from 45 to 50 fcholars, and no lituation about Edin- 
burgh, would be better adapted for a grammar fchool, if 
the heritors would be at the expence of a proper fchool- 
houfe, that the mafter might be enabled to take boarders. 
It is in a healthy country, at d diftance from any town, 
where bad examples are apt to be fet, and it has the con- 
venience of a ftage paffing twice a- week through it. 

Poor. 



* That Currie, however, though not perhaps a feparate parlfli, had 
very anciently been a place of religious worfhip, is clear from this proof, 
that in digging for the foundation of the prefent church, on the fite of the 
old one, there was difcovered a round hollow piece of filver, having the 
remains of gilding on it, and which feems evidently either a part of the 
ftalk of a crucifix, or of an altar candleftick. It has a fcrew at each end. 
Its length is 7^ inches, and its diameter inch. In a fpiral fcroU 
from top to bottom, there is the following infcription, " Je/u Fili Dei 
" miferere mei." The letters, which are Saxon, are veiy well engraved, 
and each ^ of an inch large. It is at prefent in the Mufeum of the So- 
'.'■iety of Antiquaries in Edinburgh.

Poar.—The poor of this parifli are not very numerous 
amounting generally to 28 or 29, Who receive a fupply ^ 
d^ptecl to the exigencies of their cafe. The funds for that 
purpofe are very good. They confift of a capital of near 
500 Sterling, which has been gradually accumulating, 
without any fpecial donation worth mentioning*. What 
is much to the credit of the prefent heritors, rather than' 
allow this- fund to be encroached upon, where particular 
exigencies have demanded a" more than ordinary fupply in- 
bad feafons, they have readily advanced the money need- 
ed from their own pockets, - and after the annual refource* 
of the parifh, which amount to L. 50 Sterling, could af. 
ford to repay them, they have generoufly refufed a re- 
turn. The yearly mortality is from ix to 25, and the 
yearly baptifms, which, from the number of Seceders, 
cannot be fo exa.flly afcertained, amount to about 34 or 
and are even increafing. 

Longevity. parifh can boaft, perhaps, as much as- 
any in Scotland, of the longevity of its inhabitants f.

two former clergymen, MefTrs Park and Moubray, who being the moft 
l^opular preachers of the time, drew after them a concourfe of people

double their natural amount.

:tshie, a farmer, who is 105 years old, and, what is fingu- 
Idr in the hiftory of this man, he incurred the cenfure of 
the church, for his connexions with the fex, after he had 
■attained the 90th year of his age. There are feveral other 
inhabitants of the parifh who exceed the age of 90. 

v Wood and Planting. — In the lower parts of this parifh, 
to- the north, there is a good deal of wood, but in the high- 
er grounds to the fouth, where fhelter is moft needed, it is 
viery bare, and feems a refledion on many of the proprie- 
tors, that they have neglefted it fo long. By planting, the 
climate, which varies confideral;ly in diiferent parts of the 
parilh, would be a good deal meliorated, and the high 
winds, which are a confequence of its elevated expofure, 
,nd which fweep impetuoufly from the hills, would not 
have fuch a baneful influence during the harveft in fhaking 
the crops *. 



Soil and Cultivation. — The foil of this parilh is, for the 
greater part, a tough clay, foon hardened by the heat of 
khe fun, unlefs when well cultivated. It requires, there- 
Ifore, a good deal of working, and, in this diftrift, the crops 
are obferved to be richeft, after much winter froft, and a 
jod deal of rainy weather in fpring. 'Of about 9000 a- 
cres which the parilh contains, more than \ are arable, or, 
at leaf! might be brought into tillage. The reft confifts of 
mois or hills. A good deal of grain is raifed here, of all 
the different forts ; but, from the heavy rains, which often 
f ill in autumn, the harveft is frequently retarded, and it 
, requires 

* The winds generally blow here in one of two diredlions, either E 
or W. for the greater part of the year. The former fets in pretty ftea- 
■ ly in the end of fpring, and beginning of fummer, when the fog, wit'i 
'ich they are accompanied, proves often ihurtful to the young fruit 
'e weft winds are moll prevalent in autumn.

requires the winter froft to ripen, or rather to whiten tlift ? 
grain, before it can be reaped. It would therefore be  
more for the intercft of the farmers, at leaft in the higher ; 
grounds, to keep lefs of their farms in tillage, and more ; 
in pafture. A confiderable number of black cattle, how- - 
ever, are reared in the pafture grounds, which find a ready r 
fale in the Edinburgh market ; and feveral of the tenants ? 
pay their rents in that way. The dampnefs of the climate^ , 
renders it rather unfit for breeding flieep, as they are very r 
fubjeft to the rot in winter ; but from its vicinity to the e 
capit^, the farmers find it very profitable to purchafe, in i 
the fpring and fummer months, a certain number, for the 8 
purpofe of fattening them, by which they make a hand- ■ 
fome return for the Abort time they are kept on their : 
grounds. The fuccefs of this buSnefs depends on chufingj 
the kinds that are the eafieft fattened, fo as to have twoo 
or three returns in the courfe of the feafon. A good ma- 
•ny horfes alfo, are brought up in this parifli ; and at Herj-. 
mifton, one of the mott extenfive dealers in the ifland, io^ 
that branch, with an uncommon fair charader for a joo^ 
key, refides in it. The manure ufed here, is either duni 
from Edinburgh or lime* The latter is driven from thi 
diftance of 5 miles, though there is abundance of limefl:ott( 
in the parilh itfelf, if coal Were Wrought to burn it. 

Improvements. — Moft of the improvements in this 
rilh, are the work of the prefent race of inhabitants ; a fi; 
gular enough fadl in a diftridl, only 6 miles from the capM 
tal. Mr Craig of Riccarton was the firft who fet the ex-- 
ample of inclofmg land on his own eftate here, which he 
has now brought to the higheft ftate of cultivation. The i 
late clergyman, Mr Craig, was the firft who introduced i 
into it the modern praftice of hulbandry from Eaft la-o 
thian. He was fucceeded in the fame fyftem by the in- 
genious

genious Profeflbr Ferguflbn, who has made .a variety of a- 
gricuhural experiments, on a fmall property he poffeffes in 
the parifli, which he has changed, in a few years, from a 
bare heath, to a fcene diftinguiflied for beauty and fertili- 
ty. If ever the ftipends of the clergy flionld come to be 
increafed, (as has been of late propofed), it would be of 
much benefit to the country in general, that this increafe 
fliould confift folely in the extenfion of their glebes. The 
life of a country clergyman, always allows him a great 
deal of fpare time, which muft hang heavy on his hand, if 
not occupied either in the purfuits of literature or of agri- 
culture, fince the conftitution of the church bounds his 
views, in regard to clericd preferment. I" rom the fociety 
of his parifliioners, he would unavoidably become conver- 
fant with fubjefts of agriculture ; and if his glebe is made 
cxtenlive, fo as to render it an obje£t for him to ftudy that 
bufinefs fcientifically, from his more enlarged education, 
and often, fuperior abilities, he will frequently be enabled 
to point out a new mode of procedure, which cannot fail 
to be of much fervice to his parifliioners •, for whatever 
example the minifter fets, if popular, is generally much 
followed by them. Perhaps too, the duties of his office, can- 
not be more properly fulfilled, than by teaching his flock, 
by his own example, habits of induftry and exertion, in 
order to better their fituation in this life ; which probably 
would not be found, the worft preparation for the next, as is 
illuftrated by our Lord, in his beautiful parable of the ta- 
lents. As it is, many of the improvements in the diffe- 
rent pariflies, of late years, may be traced to the exertions 
of the clergy, in which they ought certainly to receive e- 
very poflible encouragement. 

Rent, and State of Property.— .The land in the parifii of 
Currie, rents, on an average, at from 20 s. to 25 s. the 
Vql. V. Sf acre,

acre, and it has been on the increafe for fome years 
paft * The valued rent of the parifh amounts to L. 4408 
Scotch, and the real rent to upwards of L. 5000 Sterling. 
This property is all in the hands of 13 heritors, only 3 of 
whom live conftantlj in the parifli, though fome of the 
other proprietors occafionallj refide in it. As there are 
no overgrown eftates here, the proprietors are pretty much 
on a footing, and hence the public bufinefs is conduced 
■with a regularity and attention, greater than in moft other 
parifhes. The property here, like that near moft great 
towns, has been very fluftuating, and the only eftate, if it 
merits the appellation, that can be traced in the pofleflion 
of one family for 300 years, is a fraall farm of about L. 40 
Sterling yearly rent, the proprietors of which, cultivating 
their little Sabine field, and purfuing the fimple life of 
their forefathers, have kept their inheritance intire, while 
the pofleffions of their more powerful and wealthy neigh- 
bours, fvvallowed up by the devouring gulph of luxury 
and extravagance, have pafted into other hands f . 

Roads, 

* The lands in this paiilh, as might be expedled from its nearaefs ti : 
the capita], have greatly rifen in value. The eftate of Baberton, which 
fold about 2D years ago, for L. 4000, now pays L. 400 of yearly rent. 
The farm of New-mills, confifting only of 94 acres, which had formerly 
been let for los. 6d. the acre, was fold within thefe two years, for 
L. 4200, and now pays 30 s. the acre. The eftate of Maleny, from bare- 
ly L. 530 a-year, now lets for upwards of L. 900, and the farm of Ravel- 
rig, which, in the time of the former proprietor, paid onlyL.70 a-year, 
now yields L. 212. 

f This parifli, it may be obferved, ftill fumiflies one inftance of nin- 
rig, a divifion of property, neceflai7 ii this country in former times, to 
unite the jarring interefts of individuals in the common caufe, when the 
bufmefs of the age was folely war and depredation. But, what was then 
confidercd as the very fafeguard of property, the pofleflbrs in modem 
times, juftly account the greateft bar to all improvement, and are ansiom, 
to do away as rapidly as poffible. 



of Currie.

Roads. — The roads in this parifli are uncommonly good, 
which could not fail to be the cafe, as the two principal 
openings to the weftern parts of Scotland are through it, 
and there are abundance of materials in every quarter for 
repairing them. The upper road, paffing through Currie, 
forms the communication with Lanark and the county of 
Ayr ; which, fince the ereftion of the cotton works, has be- 
come a conliderable thoroughfare, two ftages paffing regu- 
larly that way twice a-week. The lower road, is the com- 
mon Glafgow road at prefent, which pafles through Hermif- 
ton. 

Manufa&amp;ures. — With refpeft tiD the manufaftures of the 
parifh, little can be faid. The only one, that of pa- 
per, has been lately introduced. The mill of MefFrs 
Nifbet and Macniven, in that branch of bulinefs, is, 
perhaps, the moft extenfive, on one water-fall, of any at 
prefent in the ifland ; and, fince its ere£lion, it has increafed 
the population of the parilh about 200 fouls. While the 
advantages of manufadures in Scotland cannot be too ftrong- 
ly inculcated, thofe, in particular, that employ the very 
young and the aged, ought to meet with every encourage- 
ment. The paper trade employs children from 10 or iz 
years of age, a period when they can do nothing very la- 
borious, and when their morals, from idlenefs and negled, 
are very apt to be corrupted. It employs alfo, in fome 
departments, people who are a good deal advanced in life, 
and after they can no longer work at thofe occupations 
without doors, that require much exertion. The annual 
wages, earned in the work of MefTrs Nlifbet and Macni- 
ven, may amount to from L. looo to L. 1200 Sterling, 
which is moftly fpent in the parifli, and chiefly in purcha- 
fmg the very neceflTaries, of life.— There are alfo feveral 
corn mills in this and the adjoining parifli, whofe chief em- 
ployment 



Statijlical Account 



plojmcnt is the making of barley to fupply the Glafgow 
market. Part of it, indeed, is exported to the Weft Iq, 
dies, where it ferves for the food of the negroes, being pre- 
ferred by fome to rice. The carts that convey the barley 
to Glafgow, are loaded back with rum and fugar, for the 
Edinburgh markets, which back carriage is their fole pro- 
fit, and allows the dealers to vend thefe articles on the fame 
terms with thofe in the immediate vicinity of Glafgow. A 
fingle horfe, in this trade, will tranfport often near 2 ton 
weight ; a ftrong proof of the goodnefs of the turnpike, 
roads in this quarter. 

River. — The river Leith, takes its rife in the weftern 
extremity of this parifti, at a place called Leith-head, from 
3 large fprings, which receive various additions in their pro- 
grefs, particularly at the village of Balerno, where they 
are joined by Bavelaw burn. Its whole courfe includes a 
track of not above 14 miles ; yet, in this ftiort fpace, it drives 
no lefs a number than 80 odd mills of different defcrip- 
tions ; the rent of fome of which, in the immediate vicinity 
of the capital, is upwards of L. 20 Sterling ^^r foot of wa- 
ter-fall. 

Advantages and Difadvantages. — The only difad vantage 
to the introdudtion of manufactures into this parifh, is the 
want of coals, which are brought from between 8 and 9 
miles diftance. At the fame time, every part of this and 
the adjoining parifties exhibits ftrong indications of the 
prefence of coal. A number of fmall crop feams have been 
found in a variety of directions and, in one place, at the 
weftern extremity of the parilh, a feam of no lefs than 2^ 
feet thick has been difcovered, at the depth of only 10 fa- 
thoms. Befides, this diftriCt of country is furrounded with 
V coal on all fides, and according to the report of one perfon 
ftill living, coal was actually wrought in one part of the pa- 
rilh. At any rate, if once the intended inland navigatioa 

, from 



of Currie. 



frdm Lanarkfliire by the Shotts hilb were' completed, 
he inhabitants of this diftria will then, as it paffes to the 
north of it, have a ready opportunity of being abundant- 
ly fupplied with this article. It is now a certain faft, 
(#iich the inhabitants of Edinburgh are already beginning 
to feel,) that the prefent collieries in its neighbourhood, are 
feft exhaufting of this valuable mineral. The proprietors of 
febfem have, at prefent, the power of raifmg the article con- 
fiderably, and the difmal profpeft prefents itfelf, that, before 
Hiany years elapfe, it may be raifed to double its prefent 
extravagant charge. Wheh this fcarcity happens, one of 
two alternatives then orlly remains, either opening pits m 
new fituations in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, or bring- 
ing coals from a diftance by water carriage. Would it not 
then be more for the honour of the prefent day, if, without 
waiting till impelled by the laft neceffity, the completion of 
the intended navigation, fliould be immediately refolved oh', 
and the capital put, in a fliort time, in poffeffion of this moft 
valuable article of coal, at an eufy rate? No period can be 
fo favourable as the prefent, when money is plentiful, com- 
merce in fo flouriibing a Hate, and the advantages of 
tlie fpeculation fo evident, as not to admit of the fraalleft 
doubt. 

At prefent, the heritors of this parifli, with a laudable 
fpirit of patriotifm, as well as a juft fenfe of their proper in- 
tereft, intend fetting on foot a fubfcripdon for the difcovery 
of coal, and to invite fome olthe adjoining parilhes to join 
them, in the fame praife-worthy attempt. If fuccefsfid, which 

hardly to be doubted, it will give a new face to this 
diftri£t of country. It would be well, if fuch a condudi: were 
imitated in many other places of Scotland, where the want 
gf fuel is fo feverely felt •, for the expence by fubfcription 
beingthus divided amongft a great number, amountstoamere 
trifle to each individual, and the lofs, if the attempt prove 
unfuccefoful, is attended with no material difad vantage. 

Antic^uities.

Statijlical Account 



Antiquities. — In this parifti there are few antiquities. dii'« 
the eftate of Captain Scott of Maleny, there are the remains i 
of an old caftle, commonly called Lennox Tower, faid to' ) 
have been a habitation of the family of Lennox, and which i 
had formed , according to tradition, the occafional refidence ! 
of Mary Queen of Scots, perhaps 

« When love was young and Darnley kind." 
It became afterwards, according to the fame tradition, a feat : 
of the Regent Morton. It ftands on a very elevated fitu- . 
ation, above the'' bank of the river, commands a beautiful I 
profped of the Frith of Forth, and in thofe times, muft have • 
been a place of very confiderable ftrength, being inacceflible : 
on all fides. It had a fubterraneous paffage to the river, 
(fo that no enemy could deprive the inhabitants of water), 
which has been only fhut up within thefe few years, from 
the cattle being apt to go down into it. The extent of 
the rampart, or out wall, which goes round the brow of the 
hill, is about 304 paces, or 1212 feet. The under part of it 
is now occupied as a hogftye. Sic tranjit gloria mundi *. 

Efninent 

* Not far from this caftle, on the Oppofite fide of the river, are the mins 
of motiier ancient edifice, the manfion of the Skenes of Curriehill, the 
date ofwhofe creation, as Baronets of Scotland, is unknoj^rn; b';?they had 
pofl'effed very extenfive property in this parilh. The family of BalmerinOj 
originally, had here alfo, a confiderable domain, which wouldy no donbt, 
be forfeited on the attainder, and tlie execution of their laft and brave chief,' 
who died with a heroifm worthy of a better caufe. On the top of Ravel- 
rig hill, the property of Mr Davidfon, there are to be feen the remains of 
a Roman ftation, or exploratory catnp,vT\AA affords a farther confirmation' 
of the name of this parifli having been originally derived from the 
Latin. This ftation has never yet been obferved by any of our Antiquaries. 
It- is fituated on the fummit of a high bank inacceflible on three fides, de- 
fended by two ditches, and faced with ftone, with openings for a gate. It 
is named by the country people Cajlle-bank. Farther eaft, are the 
appearances of another ftation or poft, which commands an extenfive view 
of the Strath towards Edinburgh, and is ftyled the General's Watch.— 
They are both very diftiniflly rnayked, in an old plan of the Ravelrig eftate, 
\ in the poffeffion of Mr Davidfonj' |ut diey are now much defaced, the 
former proprietor, having carried ol^ihe greater part of the ftones, to buildl 
fences. '%

Eminent men, — This parifli was celebrated, in former days, 
for the refidence of many eminent lawyers, and the princi, 
pal heritors were, at one time, all of that profeflion. Sir 
John Skene, of Curriehill, Lord Regifter in the reign of 
James VI. was of a family nearly related to the blood royal. 
Sir James Skene his fon, was Prelident of the Court of 
Seffion. Sir Thomas Craig, of Riccarton, was Lord Advo- 
cate in the fame reign, and the defender, in a learned trea- 
tife, of the independence of his country, and the expounder 
of the feudal fyftem. Being a man of Angular modefty, (a 
trait by which his defcendents have been alfo charafterifed), 
he refufed the honour of knighthood, nor would he ever 
give the King an opportunity of conferring it upon him. 
He enjoyed it, however, during his life, without any crea- 
tion, which was ftill a higher honour, by the exprefs order of 
the Sovereign, The Scotts of Maleny, father and fon, were 
likewife eminent lawyers at the fame period, and the latter 
had a feat upon the bench. Thus it appears, that the princi- 
pal property in the parifti, at one period, belonged to the lead- 
ing men of the law. It is proper alfo to mention, that the fa- 
mous Sir Archibald Johnfton, of Warrifton, whofe charac- 
ter is drawn, in a mafterly manner, by his nephew Bifhop 
Burnet, was a confiderable heritor in this parifti, and that 
one of his fons, James Johnfton, was envoy to Branden- 
burgh, and fecretary of ftate, in the reigns of King William 
and Queen Anne. 

CharaBer. — Till within thefe few years, the people of 
this parifti, were fober, induftrious, and economical. The 
vices of the capital, however, are beginning to fpread faft 
amongft them, and the introdudtion of thofe baneful articles 
to the poor, tea and whilky, will foon produce that corrup-' 
^ of morals and debility of conftitution, which are al- 
ready

ready fo feverely felt in many parillies, and which mufti 
foon materially injure the real ftrength and population off 
Scotland. The introdu£lion of thefe articles, is one bad ef- . 
fe£l, of the prefent pradice of debafing and vitiating malt l 
liquor. Formerly, when that liquor was the only beverage ini 
ufe, excefles from it did not alFedl the conftitution, as it con-- 
talned a good deal of nouriflament. But now, fince it has beem 
debafed, it is entirely given up. Tea, as a dietetic article, is, 
fubflituted in its place, and it is not uncommon to fee a la- 
bouring man here dining upon it. In this parifli, there weret 
feveral inftances fome years ago, and there are one or twos 
ftill, of common labourers faving to the length of L. jo andi 
L. 100 Sterling out of their days wages. Many of the far-- 
mers alfo, have rifen here, from the fame fituation, by theiri 
economy. 

Mifcellaneoiis Ohfervattons, — Freeftone abounds in a great; 
mimber of places in this parifh. At the village of Baler- - 
no, a freeftone quarry has been wrought for fome years,, 
and goes to fupply many of the buildings in the New Royal- 
ty of Edinburgh. There appears alfo plenty of ironftone, , 
of a very good quality, along the banks of the river, ini 
every diredlion ; a valuable acqulfition, if coal ihould comes 
to be wrought here. Limeftone, alfo, is abundant, fome off 
which is intermixed with a vein of copper ; fo that thee 
poffeffion of coal is only wanting, to enrich this part of thet 
country in a high degree. On Captain Scott's eftate, aa 
good many years ago, fome attempts were even made for as 
copper mine, but they failed — The wages of fervants of allJ 
kinds, are, within thefe 30 years, more than doubled, i s, . 
a-day, and maintenance, are common ia harveft ; labour-- 
era, formerly at 5 d. and 6 d. a-day, are now at is. and J 
I s. 2 d. Services of every kind are here aboliflied ex- •

cept upon two eftates, where the fervants drive all the coals, 
«nd the cottagers are bound to aflifl: in cutting down the. 
crops of the landlord. In the fouthern parts of the parifti, 
on the high grounds, the feed-time and harveft, are, at an a- 
verage, about two weeks later than about Edinburgh ; but 
in the lower parts, to the north, they are nearly the fame. 
The harvefts of the years 1782 and 1784, were here re- 
markably bad. The former, was fo every where in Scotland; 
but the latter, was equally fo here, from a long trad of 
wet weather, which prevented the grain from ripening. 
The prices of provifions here, are much the fame, as in the 
Edinburgh market ; as, from the eafy conveyance to that 
quarter, all the produce of the fields, can eafily be fent there, 
if the fame price, or fomething near it, cannot be obtained 
on the fpot.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3070901">FETTERGAIRN</name>, 
(county of KINCARDINE.) 
By the Rev. Mr Robert Foote.</head> 


<p>
Name and Situation. 

J^ETTER fignifies a pafs, and Cairn a heap of flones ; 

and there are two large cairns at the top of the mountain, 
and many fmall ones lower down, near to which, according 
to tradition, a great battle was fought, from which it is 
probable that the diftridl got its name. The parifla is fitu- 
ated in the prefbjterj of Fordoim, and Synod of Angus 
and Mearns. 

Cultivation, Produce, Soil, &amp;c. — The ground, on the weft 
part of the parifti, is of a light fliarp quality, with forae 
mofs. On the eaft, it is of a deeper mould, and fome of it 
clay. The ufvial crops are oats, bear, peafe, and occalionally 
fome wheat. Turnips are very general, and within the laft 
15 years, the tenants have made very rapid progrefs tn the 
improvement of their farms. Rents arc from 10 s. to L. I, 
7 s. 6 d. The number of farmers, who pay rent to the pro- 
prietors, is 170. There are feveral handfome farm houfes, 
barns, &amp;c. built on Sir Alexander Ramfay's eftates, which 

are-

are highly commodious to the tenants, and ornamental to the 
eountry. . A great part of the parifh is inclofed with ditch 
and hedge. There is of late, a great quantity of afti, fir, and 
birch trees planted. The greateft exertion in this way is 
' made upon the lands of Wotton and Burn, belonging to 
Lord Adam Gordon. There are 600 acres planted on his 
eftate. His Lordfliip has built a very elegant houfe, of mo- 
derate dimenfions, but exceedingly fubftantial work. It 
ftands at a fmall diftance from the river Northelk, along 
the fide of which, there is a very long walk of the moft 
beautiful kind. The money Lord Adam Gordon has ex- 
pended, in planting and building, has given employment to 
many work people, and adorned a very barren part of this 
pariQi. In due courfe of time, thefe improvements, it is 
hoped, will be profitable, as well as ornamental. 

Extent, Heritors, and Rent. —Ey a general meafurement 
taken in 1774, there are 14,359 Englifli acres. The rea 
rent is about L. 3500 Sterling. The valued rent by the cefs- 
book is L. 6533 : 3 : 3 Scotch. Four eftates, have gone by 
purchafe, to new proprietors, fince 1775.— There are 8 heri-

is very high, from the duty levied on coals carried ceaft-

plained of by all ranks.

viftual, but the greateft part in money ; befides a glebe of 
6 acres, including grafs. The manfe was rebuilt in 1774' 
The church is a very old houfe, too narrow for its length, 
as moft of thefe old kirks are. — The poor in the parifh are nu- 
merous. Their chief fuppott comes from the coUetlions 
after worfliip on the Lord's day, and the money arifing 
from the ufe of the mortcloth. The failure of crop 1782, 
increafed their number. Some favings, which were then in 
the box, were employed in purchafing meal ; but the effefts 
of that, and the following year, are ftill felt. The only doi- 
nation, lately given to the poor here, is L. 50 Sterling by 
Provoft Alexander Chriftie, of Montrofe. The intereft, is 
to be dillributed in the month of January ^very year.

The reafon that benevolent gentleman alTigns, for the gift, 
is, " That he bellows it in memory of his father, who was 
« born in the parilh of Fettercairn." 

School. — A new houfe and teaching room, were lately 
built. The falary is L. 8 : 6 : 8 Sterling, with half an acre 
of land, and a fmall garden. The fees, for teaching Eng- 
lifh, are, i s. 6 d. ; for Latin and arithmetic, 2 s. 6 d. The 
fchoolmafter is a very old man, and has been blind thefe i6 
years. Several young men have ferved as affiflants ; but 
having no fixed falary, they were always changing. The 
inconveniencies arifing from this ftate, determined the heri- 
tors to feciire an affiftant, by prefenting him to the fuccef- 
fion. To encourage a qualified perfon to accept, L. lo 
Sterling is given by a Lady to the affiftant, to continue dur- 
ing the life of the old fchoolmafter ; but on that account, 
the affiftant is to teach a Sunday fchbol. The pious and 
iefpe6lable benefaftrefs, vifits that fchool herfelf, and be- 
ftows fui table rewards upon fuch of the fcholars, as Ihew a 
defire to profit by that ufeful inftitution j remembering well 
that it is written, " 'Train up a child iit the way he jhould 
" ^0, and when he is old he will 7iot depart from it" 

Roads and Bridges. — The two great roads which pafc 
through this parilh, from the fouth and weft, are in excel- 
lent condition, as are alfo the fmall bridges upon them. 
The principal heritor p^id much attention to thefe matters, 
and is juftly praifed on that account. There is a remark- 
able bridge, called Gannachie Bridge, upon the weft fide of 
this parifti. It is thrown acrofs the Northeflc river, con- 
fifts of one arch, 52 feet over, ftands on two tremenduous 
rocks, and is juftly admired as a fingular curiofity, both in 
regard of its fituation and conflxudiion. It is with plea-

fure the writer hereof takes the opportunity, of making pu- 
blic the name and condition of the perfon, at whofe expence 
that ufeful work was raifed. James Black, who was te- 
nant in the farm of Wood, and parifh of Edzel, agreed 
•with a mafon for 300 merks Scotch^ and to lay down all 
materials. James, was a very ingenious man, and built the 
parapet walls with his own hands. Though, from the dif- 
ference of times, 300 merks Scotch, carries only a fmall 
found, it was a large fum for a' tenant to give 60 years 
ago, and the deed deferves to be recorded. The bridge 
was built in 1732. Befides the above 300 merks, Mr 
Black left 200 merks to the poor of the pari/h of 
Fettercairn, and 50 merks for upholding the bridge. Both 
fums were left to the management of the kirk-feflion here ; 
and from this circumftance, the incumbent thinks it proper 
to pubUfh thefe good deeds, as worthy to be remembered 
and imitated. 



Atitiquities.—K mile weft from Fettercairn, the founda- 
tion of a very large old building is ftiU vifible. It is upon 
the eftate of Balbigno, the property of the Honour- 
able Walter Ogilvy, Efq; of Clova. Tradition calls it Fe. 
nella's Cqfile, and the people believe it to have beea her re- 
fidence. If fo, this is the place where Kenneth III. the 
thirtieth king of Scotland, was flain. The ftory of the 
brafs ftacue, which threw out the arro^vs, and killed Ken- 
neth, IS often told. The faft, however, of the king's mur- 
der IS certam. Crathilinthus, the fon of Fenella, had been 
put to death by order of the king, for crimes which hiftory 
relates, to have deferved that punilhment. She bore Ken- 
neth a deadly grudge on that account, and executed her 
hornd purpofe in the caftle near Fettercairn, in the year 
994- The king's train coming after their royal mafter,

and difcoVering his cruel fate, fet fire to the building, and 
reduced it to aflies *. 

CharaBer. — The people, here are not deficient in dili- 
gence, and their outward deportment to their fuperiors is 
decent and refpedtful. There are a few litigious people, as 
is the cafe among every multitude, but the inhabitants in 
general, are not inclined to law-fuits. They give regular at- 
tendance upon^ public worlhip, on the Lord's day, and no 
doubt the example of their fuperiors, in rank and ftation, 
is ufeful in that refpedt. They, who cannot fpare one daj 
in feven, to the honour of theirRedeemer, and to the care of 
their fouls, muft foon find, that the finful cares of time, will 
ufurp the regard due, to the more important concerns of 
eternity. 

* A mile to the eaft of thb town, tlie ruins of a caftle, where Kenneth 
is reported to have refided and occafionally lived, are vifible. It is in th«' 
adjoining parilh of Fordoun, and near, to the remains of Kincardine, an- 
ciently the county town, where the Sheriff courts were held, till the year 
1600, when they -were removed by adl of Parliament to Stonehaven. At 
this fame Kincardine, the unfortunate Baliol, made his fubmiflion t» 
Edward I. Some hiftorians, who mention this matter, fay, that it happened 
at Montrofe ; others, at Brechin, Sir David DaJryrapIe, in the ift volume 
of his Annals of Scotland, informs us, that the refignation was made at 
Kincardine. The accuracy and candour of Lord Hailes deferve the high- 
eft confidence. He fixes the matter indifputably, by quoting the record 
itfelf, which is the beft of all evidence *. Sir David Dalrymple fays, 
« The record bears, that Baliol made his fubmiflion at Kincardine on 
" the ad of July 1296 and then he adds, " All the hiftorians whom I 
" have had occafion to confult, place this remarkable event on the loth, 
" and not on the ad of July."— The place in the Imdcra, to which Lord 
Hailes refers, is in torn. a. p. 7 18.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5052163">CATHCART</name>,  
(Counties of Renfrew and Lanark.) 
By the Rev. Mr David Dow.</head> 



<p>Origin of the Name. 

THIS parifti evidently derives its name from the Cart 
or Kert, a confiderable ftream- which takes its courfe 
through it, from S. to N. or N. W. dividing it nearly into i 
two equal parts. In old papers it is called Kerkert and 
Kethkert, but how far thefe names are defcriptive of any ■ 
circumftances peculiar to this water, or the grounds in the 
neighbourhood, we are not fufficiently acquainted withi 
the ancient language of the country, with certainty to de-- 
termine. As a parifli, it is of confiderable antiquity, ass 
far back as aririo 1160, when Walter, Lord High Stewardi 
of Scotland, founded the monaftery of Paifley, the kirk oft 
Cathcart and its pertinents, (of which it would appear het 
had then been the proprietor^, are exprefsly mentioned as J 
part of the donation originally appropriated to that pious » 
ufe. It continued to depend on the monks of Paifley, from  
that time to the Reformation, and contributed its fliare to j 
fupport the fplendour and dignity of that powerful and 0- - 
pulent abbacy. It alfo gives both name and title to thet 
very ancient and noble family of Cathcart. There arcr

authentic records, extending to a very remote period, to 
ihew, that the anceftors of this family were formerly per- 
fons of very great confequence and authority in the neigh- 
bourhood, and it is probable that the greateft part of the pa, 
rlfli was their property ; but,being involved in difficulties by 
the troubles of the country, (in which their loyalty and 
public fpirit always led them to take a didinguiilied ftiare), 
about the year 1546, this, their ancient hereditary eftate, 
was alienated by Alan, the third Lord Cathcart •, fmce 
which time they have had no footing whatever in the pa- 
riHi. 

Situation, Extent, Sac— It lies partly in Renfrew, and part- 
ly in Lanarklhire, the much greater proportion of it belonging 
to the former. The disjundion of a confiderable part of that 
divifion, of it which belongs to Lanark, including the lands 
of Dripps, took place yi. D. 1725, by an amicable concert of 
all the parties concerned ; to which the Lords CommiiTion- 
ers for Plantation of Kirks, and Valuation of Teinds, gave 
their fanftion. It was, however, exprefsly provided, that 
no matter of a civil nature ihould be affected by this mea- 
fure. The objeft of it was folely to accommodate the inha- 
bitants of thefe lands in church privileges, being much more 
contiguous to Carmunnock than their own pariJli church. 
The church of Cathcart is fituated within the fiieriffdom 
of Renfrew, belongs to the prefbytery of Glufgow, and the 
provincial Synod of Glafgow and Ayr. The extent of the 
parilh, from N. to S. (the direflion in which it ftretches to 
the greateft length), is about 4 miles ; and, if the disjoined 
part be included, it is upwards of 6, and in no place above 
2 miles in breadth. Its mean breadth may be about a 
mile and a half. It lies in a fouth-weft direftion from 
Glafgow*, the centre of the parilh being two miles diftant 
from the fuburbs of that city, and is diftant, on the other 

Vol, V. Uu hand, 



238 Statijlical Account 

hand, 19 miles from Kilmarnock, the great road to A.yr. 
Ihire, by that town, running diredly through the parilh. It 
may contain about 3000 Scotch acres, including the lands 
of Dripps above mentioned, and is almoft wholly ara- 
ble, except fome few fpots, upon the deep banks of the 
Cart, to which the plough cannot have accefs. The 
diftria is rich and fertile above many in the neigh- 
bourhood, and pours in its furplus ftores, to fupply the de- 
mands of the populous commercial city of Glafgow. On 
entering the parifli from Glafgow, ftrangers have been 
much pleafed with the face of the country. Inftead of a 
dull uniform level, as is the cafe with the moft fertile tra6ts 
of Scotland, the farface is remarkably diverfified with hill 
and dale. The hills do not rife in ridges, but are altoge- 
ther feparate and diftind from"each other, and prefent to 
the eye thofe alternate rifings and falls, which conftitute fo 
material a part of pifturefque beauty. The hills, in the 
northern extremity of the parifli, never attain to fuch a 
height, or afcend with fuch fl:eepnefs, as to prevent them' 
from being cultivated to the top \ and their floping fides 
are, in their feafon, always covered with the richeft crops 
of grafs and corn. Through thefe hills, the Cart winds its 1 
way in a very irregular courfe, fometimes difappearing al- • 
together, by the fteepnefs of its banks, and again fpreading ; 
itfclf out into the plain • On advancing farther into the pa- - 
rifti, in the fame direftion, a fucceflion of hills of greater ■ 
height, and lefs pleafing afpeft, takes place, and the land \ 
becomes gradually more bleak and barren. Great part off 
it, however, is raifed but little above the level of the fea, .. 
which is known by its being almofl: on the fame plain with 
Glafgow, to which the tide regularly ebbs and flows. 

Soil and Small as the parifli is, it is diftinguiflied 

by a great variety of foil and expofure. In general, the low-: 
er parts of the parifli are light and fandy. The centric- 
part?

|)arts confifl: of deep rich loam, and the higher grounds are 
clay, in many places thinly fpread over a till bottom* 
On the riling grounds, complaints are made, of the want of 
fprings, to fupply the inhabitants with water. The wells, 
that are dug, never fail to become dry in fummer. This feems 
to be owing to the peculiar Conftrudion of the hills above 
mentioned, and to the clay foil, which retains the water on 
the furface. From the circumftances above ftated, a great 
inequality takes place, in the value of the lands. The fields 
in the lower parts of the parilh, although adjacent to Glaf- 
gow, to which they feiid their produce, and thence receive 
their manure at an eafy rate, do not rent fo high, as the 
lands at a greater diftance ; and again, the farms in the up- 
per part of the parifh, having to ftruggle, both with the dif- 
ad vantage of their] greater diftance from markets, and an 
inferior foil, are, in comparifbn, rented very low. While 
fome farms, are let as high, as L. 3 per acre, others, fall be- 
low 7 s. This inequality cannot altogether be afcribed, 
to the difference of the foil \ and, as there are two turnpike 
roads, which are always kept in excellent repair, leading 
through the parifh, in convenient direftions to Glafgow, 
the diftance from the market, in any part of it, cannot be 
complained of. It muft be allowed, therefore, that the 
grounds in the upper part of the parifti, till of late, have 
been much neglefted. As the gentleman, to whom the 
greater part of them belong, has come to refide in the pa- 
rilh, he will naturally be led, to take fach meafures, as will 
render them more, valuable, both to himfelf and to the com- 
munity. The vicinity of fuch a rich andinduftrious city, as 
Glafgow, fhould give a powerful fpring to the exertions of 
every landholder in its neighbourhood, who may be fully 
affured, that the produce of their eftates, however much in- 
crcafed, either in quantity or quality, will immediately be 
fold to the beft advantage. One gentleanan in. this parifti, by 

adopting 



340 Stat'ijlical Account 

adopting a very fpirited mode of improvement, has convert- 
cd a piece of ground, which, till he gained poffeffion of it 
lay almoft wild and uncultivated, into rich palJure, for which 
he receives annually L. 2, 5 s. per acre, without the liberty of 
tillage ; and his fuccefs may encourage others, who have it 
in their power, to follow his example. Upon the whole, it 
mull be allowed, that the value of this parilh has increafed 
in a very rapid progrefs. Its valuation in Scotch money is 
L.3167. In 1771, when the late minifter applied for an 
augmentation of ftipend, the ftock and teind were found to 
amount to no more than L. 1850 Sterling, and now 
the rental is above L. 3400, exclufive of minifter's fti- 
pend, cefs, and fchool falary. This rife in its value, muft 
be accounted for, by the increafed price, of all the difFerent 
articles, produced by the ground, (of which Cathcart. from 
its vicinity to Glafgow, is in a lituation fully to avail it- 
felf), as well as from a more improved mode of agriculture. 

Bufincfs. — This parifli may be confidered almoft entirely 
as an agricultural diftria. While the manufaftures, of 
Paifley and Glafgow, have diffufed themfelves through all 
the neighbouring pariflies, to a much greater diftance, they 
have as yet made but inconfiderable progrefs in Cathcart. 
How long this may be the cafe, it is difficult to determine. 
Indeed, manufaflurers have little encouragement to fettle 
here, from the hopes of finding a cheaper market; as every 
article of provifion fells as high as in Glafgow, with the 
additional expence, of fending to that town, for thofe necef- 
faries which the parifli cannot afford. There is neither 
butcher, brewer, nor baker, within its bounds: At the 
fame time the parifh abounds with many other articles, ef- 
fentially neceflary to the manufafturer, and without which 
indeed, he cannot go to work ; fuch as coal, lime and wa- 
ter. Upon the Cart, there are many favourable fituations 

for 



of Cathcart. 341 

for erecting machinery for cotton fpinning ; it la not to be ex- 
"peAed, that they will much longer remain unoccupied. In- 
'deed, we believe, propofals have already been made, by one 
of the chief adventurers in that bufinefs, for erefting a 
work of this kind. How far fuch works may ultimately 
; prove beneficial to the perfons immediately concerned, 
;time alone can determine •, but perfons living in the neigh- 
iboiirhood have no great reafon to wifli for their eftabliih- 
iment, as, by all accounts, they bring along with them, ma- 
jny caufes of difturbance, and many other inconveniencies. 

Cultivation.— AgvicvXlnxG, being the prevailing bufinefs 
in the parifh, the inhabitants have chiefly direfted their at- 
tention to it. Although few of them underftand its fcientific 
principles, yet it is believed,'that their own fagacity, has led 
them to adopt fuch a method, as, upon the whole, is moft 
beneficial to themfelves. Farming, has been too long prac- 
tifed and underftood here, for its followers to ftand upon the 
antiquated ceremony, of only beginning to plow at a certain 
day in the year. In this inftance, prejudice and fuperfti- 
tion have yielded to reafon and felf-intereft. Plowing is 

■ carried on through the whole year, and the farmer begins 
to fow, whenever circumftances permit. The people have 
found, by experience, that a judicious fyftem of hulbandry does 
not admit any ceflation of labour, but that there are ways, 
in which they may conftantly convert their own and tiieir 
horfes work, to a very good account, in the bufinefs of their 
farms. The farms, in general, are fmall, being rather un- 
der, than above 50 acres ; and, in few inftances, do they a- 
mount to 100, Of thefe, in the beft cultivated parts of the 
parifii, they plow a half, and frequently two thirds. As 
this repeated cropping, would, in time, exhauft the produc- 
tive powers of the very beft ground, the farmers make a 
liberal ufe of Glafgow dung, for which their vicinity to that 



town 



342- Statijlical Account 

town affords them a great advantage. This, of all others, ^ 
is found to be the moft permament and fubllantial manure* 
Lime, although it is to be met with every where through- 
out the parifh, has, efpeciallj of late, been but fparingly 
ufed. Nay, there are farms in this parilh, which, by be- 
ing conftantly limed, without receiving any other manure, . 
have become altogether barren. Lime acts upon the foil, as 
a powerful ftimulant, and brings forth whatever nourifh- 
ment it has. Unlefs, therefore, its vegetative powers, be « 
feafonably reftored, by fome other fpecies of manure, the r 
ground may, and, in many cafes, aftually has been reduced td » 
a caput mortuum. 

'Produce. — Summer fallowing is not much practifed. In-t- 
ftead of this, the ground is prepared for potatoes, by giving j 
it repeated plowings, and laying upon it from 40 to 66 0 
carts per acre, of the manure above mentioned. Each carf^t, f 
cofts from 2s. 6d. to 3 s. before it is laid upon the fiddit jc 
The potatoes being planted in drills, are firft cleanfed witlill i 
the hand hoe, when beginning to appear above the ground,! \ 
after which, (as their perfeaion,it would appear, in a greati 
meafure, depends much upon their being taken the beftU pj 
eare of when young, till they arrive at a certain length,),! 
they are repeatedly drejfed with a fmall Jingie-horfe ploughs 
The profit arifing from this crop, properly managed, is foR 
great, as fcarcely to be credited in places lefe favourablyj 
fituated. L. 10, L. 15, and even L. 20 per acre, have beeni 
received for them, before they have been dug up. Itl 
muft be owned, indeed, that nothing but fuch a market asa 
Glafgow, to which a bulky article like this can be tranf- 
ported, and immediately fold, could enable the farmer to: 
derive fo much profit. But the advantage of this manage- 
ment does not end here. After the potatoes are taken up,; 
wheat is fown, and we have fcarcely known an inftance, 

■vvheH 



of Cathcart. 343 

vhen the ground has been thus properly prepared, that 
refult has not been a very abundant crop. There 
may be from 100 to 150 acres of wheat, fown annually in 
this way, the produce of which is, from 1000 to 1200 
bolls. Such, either is the richnefs of the foil, m fome 
parts of this pariih, or the advantage of this mode of ma- 
nagement, that an exceeding good crop of oats, has been 
obtained after the wheat, without any interval or addi- 
tional manure. After this, the ground is either allowed 
to reft fome time, or the fame procefs is repeated without 
Intermiffion. This is pretty much the pradice, purfued by 
the farmer, in the lower parts of the parifti, which includes 
by far its moft fertile and populous divifion. Thofe, alfo, 
i„ the immediate neighbourhood of Glafgow, make a good 
deal by fending in their milk as it comes from the cow. 
The lands, at a greater diftance from town, and thofe of 
m inferior quality, are, in general, plowed to the extent 
of one third, and nothing is raifed in them but oats, and a 
little barley. In thefe places, the farmer chiefly depends 
upon the produce of his dairy. Here, as well as in the 
parifties at a greater diftance in the fame direaion, the 
country people find great advantage in fending their but- 
ter-milk to Glafgow, during the fummer feafon, and it 
proves a cheap and wholefome beverage, to the ,lower 
claffes of the inhabitants, of that great and populous city. 

ManufaBures.—KM^^ongh. the bulk of the inhabitants, 
as above ftated, are employed in hulbandry, yet there are 
fome perfons of other occupations among them. At pre- 
fent, there are 30 looms for weaving in the parifh, which 
chiefly find employment from the manufafturers of Glaf- 
gow.— A confiderable bleachfield was occupied for fomc 
time, by a Company in Glafgow, who carry on the ma- 
nufadure of ftockings to a great extent. But it being com- 
plained 



344 



Stati/lical Account 



plained of by them, that they could not clear their goods or 
bring them to fuch a degree of whiten efs as they wifhed 
owing to the water being fo often rurbid,. they fliitted their 
ftation to the parilli of Neilfton. Since this change took 
place, the bleaching carried on by their fucceffors, has been • 
but in a languifliing ftate, and we believe is now entirely 
given up. If this be an incurable defect in the water of 
Cart, it accounts for its having been fo little occupied for . 
iifes of this kind ; as otherwife, there are certainly very fa. , 
vourable fituations in the parilh, for profecuting the bufi. 
ne6 of bleaching. — The paper manufadlure, too, was very j 
early attempted here. One Nicholas Deflian, a paper- - 
maker, who, we are told, was driven from France, his na- 
tive country, in confequence of the revocation of the edift 1 
of Nantz, took refuge, and eftablifhed his bufmefs, in this i 
parifli, about the end of the laft century. Having conned- 
ed himfelf with an opulent family here, they conjunftiy ir 
erefted very large buildings for carrying on the paper ma-j. 
nufa£lure. His defcendants continued to make paper tilil 
very lately ; but not finding it a profitable bufinefs, ?, 
the prefent proprietor of thefe buildings, has converted'! 
them into a fnufF manufafture, which yields him a morei 
certain and permanent profit.— Higher up the ftream, a,!' 
paper work is Hill carried on. In this bufinels a confi-l 
derable ftock is engaged, and 8 men ufually find employ- • 
ment. Here lapping paper, and only the coarfer kinds of ' 
writing paper, are manufadlured. It would appear, that \ 
the fame defeft, which is complained of in the bleaching 
bufinefs, prevents them alfo from carrying this manufac- 
ture, to any confiderable perfedlion or extent. 

Mills. — In the parlfti there are two corn-mills, befides 
one for the lands of Dripps above meniioned. Two of 
tliefe, are kept np by the fervices, which the tenants in the 

neighbourhood 



of Cathcart. 345 

neighbourhood are bound to perform, who are obliged to 
pay a confiderable fum anaually, under the name of mul- 
ture. The other depends, for its fupport, upon the em- 
ployment which it may occafionally meet with. It is 
well known, that wherever fuch fervitudes are fuffered 
to exift, they are neceffarily attended with much trouble 
and inconvenience, and lay the foundation for many te- 
dious and expenfive litigations. A fmgle doubt, therefore, 
cannot be entertained, but it would be for the good of the 
country, to abolilli them altogether, by buying them off, at 
a reafonable converfion ; fo that the farmer might brmg 
his grain, to any mill he pleafes, and fhould only pay a fum 
adequate to the improvement which it receives. 

ir^,._Various caufes have contributed to diminifli the 
quantity of trouts in the Cart, which, it is faid, once, greatly 
abounded with them. Of th.fe, the ufe of lime for ma- 
nure, but efpecially the crouds of people, who, m fuch a 
neighbourhood as this, inceffantly harrafs and perfecute

angling, and who have time and patience to follow it, are 
fometimes fuccefsful. Of eels, at all times, there is to be 
had a plentiful ftore. 

Minerah.~\xv the parifh there are four tackfmen of 
lime quarries, who ufually employ 16 men, and who may 
put out yearly 6000 carts of burned lime, or lime in the 
Ihells, as it is called. This is moftly fent in to Glafgow 
for building, or carried away by the farmers in the neigh- 
bouring pariHaes, for manure. The price of each is 3 s., of 
which 34, is paid to the proprietor, for lordfbip and fur- 
face damages. Each cart contains 5 bolls, Winchefter 
meafure, of flaked lime. Thefe feams of lime, are wrought

of the furface, or dip, as it is called, being one ell in fi^g 
fo that from the increafing labour, and expence of putting 
cut the ftone, they muft foon be obliged to defift. But, it 
IS faid, there is no fcarcity of lime in other parts of 'the 
panlh, which may be wrought more eafily. Coal is alfo 
found in all the different parts of the parifli from N. to S. 
The coal under the lands of Corfehill, forms a part of the 
great Govan coal-work, which furniflies a confiderable part 
of the fuel confumed in Glafgow, and that populous neigh- 
bourhood ; befides exporting large quantities, by the river 
Clyde, to remote countries. This work, however, is at 
prefent carried on within the parifli of Govan. In the 
fouthern part of the parifli, the coal is alfo wrought, but 
upon a fmall fcale, and what is put out, is chiefly ufed for 
the fmithy, or for burning lime. It would appear, that 
liitherto, it has only been the crop coal, which has been 
wrought in thefe places. There is little reafon to' doubt, 
but upon finking deeper, other feams of coal, of greater 
thicknefs and value, might be found. But thefe will re- 
main as magazines, to fupply the demand of the manufac- 
turing city of Glafgow, when other coals, more contiguous, 
are exhaufted.— It has alfo been affirmed, that iron-ftone is 
to be found in the parifli ; although, from the great quan- 
tity of this fubftance to be met with every where, there is 
little reafon to esped that it will foon turn out to any ad- 
count.— The curious and inquifitive have found many un- 
common minerals and foflils, in the channel of the Cart, with 
which they have amufed themfelves. There is a Itream 
which falls into it, a little way above the bridge, which, it 
would appear, has the power of petrefying vegetable fubftan- 
ces: Pieces of wood and mofs, completely converted into ftone, 
have been picked up, bearing all the marks of their former 
texture and organization. Spars and chryftalUzations, 

of

of very curious form and appearance, have alfo been 
found. 

Plants and fVoods. — The banks of the Cart, have long 
been reforted to, by the botanical ftudent. Such is the 
warmth and Ihelter, in fome of thefe fequeflrated fpots, 
that almoft a perpetual verdure is to be found. Here, fpe- 
cimens of moft of thofe plants, which the clearing the 
grounds of the woods, with which they were originally co- 
vered, have baniftied from the country, ftill ftioot up in 
thdr native luxuriancy and vigour. Of thefe, we could 
ealily produce a catalogue, but we are confcious that there 
are none, but what are fufficiently known to the lovers of 
botany, and to others, their bare names will afford but lit- 
tle entertainment. It is much to be regretted, ' that fuch 
indifcriminate havock, Ihould have been made of the origi-^ 
nal plantations of the country. By the war, which, for 
ages paft, has been waged againfl the forefts of Scotland, 
they are now indeed reduced within very narrow limits ; 
and the fmall remnants, Avhich have been fortunately left, 
in glens and on the fteep banks of rivers, more from negli- 
gence than defign, are dwindling fall away. Hence we 
will not only be deprived of many of thofe beauties, 
which nature, in its rude forms, prefents to the view of e- 
very perfon of tafte and difcernment ; but alfo many of 
thofe humble plants, which grew up under their flielter, 
will only be known by their names. The boar, the wolf, 
and even the deer, to whom thefe woods proved a defence, 
are now no more to be found in this country ; and it is to 
be feared, that their more harmlefs vegetable inhabitants, 
will alfo fhare the fame fate. The complaint of a late ce- 
lebrated feholar and moralifl, although no favourite of the 
inhabitants of this country, is but too well founded, when 
he refle£b upon the fcarcity of trees in Scotland. They

Langjide.—ln this parifh, lies the field of Langfide, me- 
morable for being the fcene of the laft and decifive effor J 
of the unfortunate Marj, to regain her crown and autho! 
rity. The circumftancej which led to this battle; the 
form and manner of the engagement ; and the confequen- 
ces refulting from it, are too well known, to require any 
illuftration from an account of this kind. The place 
where this affair was decided, is an eminence upon the 
northern extremity of the parifh. The ground gradually 
nfes to a confiderable height on the S. and £. fides, but 
defcends pretty rapidly towards the N. and W. Hence, 
it is eafy of accefe in the firft of thefe direftions, but on 
the other, is fteep and difficult. On the fummit, and ra- 
ther 

* There are evidences every where, that this parifh, at no very re- 
mote period, was in a great meafure, or almoft wholly, covered with 
wood. This affords the means of accounting, for many of the moft com- 
mon names of places in the parifh. Thus, Aikenhead, which is the refi- 
dence of the patron of the parifh. WiUiamwood is the houfc of another 
very confiderable heritor. Hagton-hiU. Hagginfliaw, and Woodfide, are 
names of farms evidently bearing a relation to circumftances of this kind. 
In many places thefe woods have been fo recently cut down, that the 
roots ftill retain vegetation ; and when a field is allowed to reft any time, 
flioots of birch, hazle, and even oak, fpring up. At prefent, however^ 
there are very fmall remains of thefe woods, except upon the inacceffiblc 
banlcs of the Cart, above mentioned, and about lo acres on the weft-fide of 
Langfide hill, which the proprietor cuts periodically, in the manner prac- 
tifed in the more extenfive forefts in the Highlands. In the neighbour- 
ing parifh of Eaftwood, tliere are more confiderable remains of tlie natu- 
ral wood of the country.

ther inclining to the N. fide of the hill, there is a circular or 
elliptical inclofure, about 360 feet in circumference, which, 
it would appear, had been a fmall Roman encampment. 
By moft of the hiftorians, and by the editors of Camden's 
Antiquities, it is mentioned as a place of this kind. There 
are not wanting, in this neighbourhood, fimilar military 
nations of the Romans. As they appear to have been too 
fmall, for an ordinary encampment, it is probable, that they 
were the cajira exploratorum, or flations for centinels. In 
this refpeft, the place here mentioned, is extremely fuita- 
ble. From it, an extenfive view of the counties of Dum- 
barton and Argyle, which were beyond the limits of the 
Roman province, prefents itfelf to the eye. Here then, 
a detachment of Roman troops, might difcern the firft 
movements of our rude anceftors, and take meafures to re- 
pel their irruptions. By the common people in this coun- 
try, the place " is called Queen Mary's camp. But, it is 
well known, that no encampment was made by either 
party, in this more recent period of hiftory. Murray, the 
regent, having drawn his forces from Glafgow, on the 
fame day in which the engagement happened, made a 
ftand here, in order to intercept the Queen, in her progrefs 
j to Dumbarton, when a fkirmifh enfued ; the Queen's par- 
I ty was routed, and a confiderable number of her friends 
killed •, but many more were taken prifoners In the pur- 
fuit. A place is yet pointed out, upon an oppofite emi- 
nence, fully in the view of the field now defcribed, and 
near the old caftle of Cathcart*, where Mary flood until

to have been a very ftrong building. It ftands upon one of the moft 
commanding iituations in the country, and has two of its fides complete-

the affair was decided. A hawthorn bufh, cotntnonljr 
known here by the name of ^een Mary's thorn, mark- 
ed out the fpot, till it decayed through age but another 
has lately been planted in its place by the late James Hillj 
Efq; proprietor of the ground, to preferve the remem- 
brance of thefe interelling circumftances. 

Heritors and Population. — There are 1 7 heritors at pre- 
fent in the parifli, who rank upon the cefs roll of the fhirci

a narrow entry, which might have been fecured by a ditch and draw- 
bridge, is pretty fteep and difficult ; fo that in times when the art of at- 
tack was not fo well imderftood, it might have made a confiderable de- 
fence. The fquare tower, of which the original building confifted, ap. 
pears to have had annexed to it, a more modern houfe, which is now 
completely removed. The caftle, was within thefe 50 years inhabited, 
but was given up by its proprietbr to be demolifhed, upon removing to 
another dwelling. The materials were fold to a tradefman in Glafgow, 
who hoped thereby to enrich himfelf. Having taken off the roof, he was 
proceeding with the reft of the building, when he found himfelf obliged 
to flop by the refiflance he met with, fi-om" the ftrength and thicknefs of 
the walls. Having been left fince that time in a difmantled ftate, it has 
fcarcely fufFered any farther injury from the influence of the weather. 
Few parilhcs have experienced fuch a frequent change of proprietors. 
Two confiderable families fprung up immediately after the removal of 
the Lords of Cathcart. The Semples of Cathcart defcended from the 
Xords of Semple, and the Blairs of JBoghen, who were alfo Blairs of Blair, 
in Ayrfliire. Their eftates again, have long ago been parcelled out, a- 
mong many different proprietors, who are continually alienating their 
lands. In fuch a neighbourhood, this is naturally to be expedted. 
Some perfons wldi to fell their lands, and try their fortune in trade ; o- 
thers again, from the fruits of their induftiy, are enabled to purchafe; ' 
and to retire to the country. This is attended with a double advantage 
to the community. The profpedl of obtaining an independent lituation 
in the counti-y, gives a more vigorous fpring to the exertions of the man 
of bufinefs, while the lands benefiting by the renewed efforts of the fuc • 
ceeding proprietors, attain to a higher ftate of cultivation and improve^ 
ment. Hence we may fafely conclude, that whatever has a tendency to 
obftrudt the free fale and difpofal of landed property, efpecially in com- 
mercial countries, ought to be removed.

probable Impro'vements.— With regard to the means by 
which the fituation of the inhabitants of this diftria may 
be improved, we ihall confine our attention to thofe who 
are employed in labouring the ground, wlro are the moft 
numerous. The misfortune of the tenantry here, as well 
as in many other parts of the country, is, that having no 
capital, they poffefs not the means of bringing their farms 
into that complete ftate of improvement, of which, we ap- 
prehend, they are capable. The produce is barely fuffi- 
cient for fupplying the demands of each feafon ; for paymg 
their rents, and procuring for their families the neceffaries 
of life ; for, to luxuries, or even conveniences, they mult 
not pretend to afpire. Beginning in poverty and deprei- 
fion, they muft neceffarily remain fo, and, at the end ot 
their leafe, their land returns into tlie hands of the pro- 
prietor in no better, but, frequently, in a worfe condition 
Ln it was before. It ought, therefore, to be the fludy of 
country gentlemen, either to look out for tenants who 
have a ftock, and to give them fufficient encouragement, to 
employ it in meliorating their lands, or previoufly to put 
them into fuch a fituation, that they may reafonably ex- 
pea an advanced rent. It is apprehended, that whatever 
expence, (efpecially in fuch a fituation as this,) might 
thereby be incurred, would turn out to good account. 
One very obvious improvement, required in this country, 
is building better houfes to the tenants, in which there is 
ftill a very lamentable deficiency. The contrail in this 
refpea, between this clafs of men, and thofe employed 
in the manufaaures, muft ftrike every obferver Be- 
fides the tendency, which this improvement would have, 
to preferve the health of the inhabitants, and to enable 
them better to endure the fatigues of their occupation, it 
would raife their fpirits, place them upon a more refpea- 



35^ Statijlical Account 

able footing, and make them profecute, with greater ardour 
and affiduitj, the improvement of the ground. 

Manners and CharaBer. — The manners and charafter of 
the people here, as well as in all other parifhes, are vari- 
ous. It would be doing injuftice to many individuals of 
every ftation, not to make many favourable exceptions ; 
but, at the fame time, it muft be acknowledged, that the 
neighbourhood of fo great a city as Glafgow, has, perhaps 
unavoidably, a very pernicious influence on the morals of 
the inhabitants. The frequency of their communication, 
with that town, has extended their knowledge, at the ex- 
pence of their virtue ; and they have acquired a tafte for 
many of thofe vices, which flourifti luxuriantly in fo rank 
a foil. Converfing, not with the moderate and rational 
part of the citizens, but with the violent and intemperate, 
they imbibe their notions, which they tranfplant with 
them into the country, greatly to the annoyance of their 
more peaceable neighbours. Thus, there is reafon to la- 
ment the decline of that primitive innocence, and fimplici- 
ty of manners and charader, by which people, living in 
more remote fituations of the country, are happily diftin-, 
guifhed. </p>

PARISH OF <name ref="NA">LOCHLEE</name>, 

(county of ANGUS.) 
By the Rev. Mr John Pirie.</head> 



<p>^ame. Situation, and Extent.  

LOCHLEE is evidently derived from a loch fi- 
tuated in a deep bottom, almoft furrounded with 
lleep and high hills •, at the eaft end of which, the parifh 
church ftands. — The parifh is fituated in the north corner 
of Forfarlliire, in the prefbytery of Brechin, and Synod of 
Angus and Mearns. It is furrounded with high hills, part 
of the Grampians, a narrow opening at the eaft end ex- 
cepted, through which the river North Efk palTes to the 
low country •, and it is nearly interfered in two or three 
places by hills. It is about 12 miles long from E. to W. 
and 6 miles broad from N. to S. if regard is had to its pa- 
fture grounds ; and there are about 8 miles betwixt the 
moft diftant dwelling houfes from £. to W. and 4 from 
N. to S, ; it is nearly of the fame breadth from end to 
ynd. 

Surface 



357 



35^ Statijlical Account 

Surface and Soil. — The hills are for the moft part fteep 
rocky on the fides, and covered with heath. There is no 
thing in the parilli deferving the name of meadow ground 
even the valleys being covered with heath, the grounds un- 
der tillage excepted, and a few fpots of inconfiderable ex- 
tent, producing bufhes, fpratt and bent, intermixed with 
other coarfe grafs. The foil under culture, is thin and 
light, generally on a bottom of gravel, and in many places 
fullofftones. The extent of the arable land is very in- 
confiderable, when compared with that of the whole parilh, 
there being only a few fmall ftripes under tillage, along 
the different branches of the river ; and it does not appear 
prafticable much to increafe the quantity. 

Prodt/Siwns.—The amount of grain produced, is very 
inconfiderable, and, at an average, does not fupport the in- 
habitants. This, in a great meafure, is occafioned by an 
unfavourable climate. The ground being locked up with 
froft, or covered with fiiow, during the winter and great 
part of the fpring feafon, it is commonly the ift or 2d of 
April, before the tillage for the enfuing crop commences, ^ 
few farms in the eafl end of the parifli excepted. The 
feed time being late, and generally very cold, the crop is 
oftentimes checked in the following September, by frpft and. 
unfeafonable weather, before it has had time to come to 
maturity. The bear, if it efcapes the September froft, is 
for the moft part well filled ; but the corn is often very 
unprodu6tive, it being frequently as late as the middle of 
November before the harveft is concluded. In 1789, a' 
great part of the grain remained in the fields, till the fecond 
week of December. Potatoes and turnips have lately been 
iptroduced, and if the climate would permit, thefe ufeful 
foots would thrive well.

. Climate and Difeafcs. — The climate varies in difFerent 
parts of the parifh. Although much colder than in the low 
country, jet, in the eaft end of the parifh, it is more tem- 
fiierate and warmer than in the weft end, where the win- 
ter fnow frequently lies upon the hills, until the end of 
May, and fometimes the middle of June. The air is rec- 
koned healthy ; the inhabitants are not fubjedt to fevers of 
any kind, nor is there any other difeafe peculiar to the 
place. The ague never makes its appearance in any form, 
within the bounds of the parifli, although that difeafe is 
common, in the adjoining parifties of Fettercairn and Ed- 
zell. In May 1782, after an exceeding eold and wet 
fpring, the wind blowing generally from N. E. a fever 
made its appearance in the parifli, which, in the fpace of 6 
weeks, cut off 35 perfons. It^was attended with fymptoms 
fimilar to what accompanies an inflammation of the Pleura: 
The perfons afFedled had their fpittle mixed with blood, 
within a few hours after the fever feized them ; they felt 
a pain at or below their left pap ; and died upon the 5th 
or 6th day. The pain, however, did not affeft their 
breathing fo much ; nor did it feel fo acute as is common- 
ly the cafe in a pleuritic fever. The greater part of thofe 
who died, were 30 years of age and upwards ; they were 
all above 18. Two only recovered of all that were feized. 
It is not remembered that a fever, fimilar to the above, 
has happened in the parifli. 

Population. — From an account taken in 1723, when 
Lochlee was disjoined from Lethnot, there appears then to 
have been, 400 examinable perfons in the parifli ; in 1765, 
the number of fouls in it amounted to 600 ; at prefent ' 
(1792) there are 178 men, 237 women, and 193 children 
below 12 years of age, making in all 608 fouls. Al- 
though, from the above ftatement, jt might be concluded, 

that 



360 



Statijiical Accouhi 



that the population has varied little or nothing fince 172^ j 
yet it appears, in faft, to have been a little on the increafe, 
at leaft lince 1766. The natives had formerly a ftrong at- 
tachment to the place, and feldom left the parifti. Al-l 
though the fame attachment ftill continues, yet the price o£ 
labour in the low country has advanced fo confiderably,,- 
within the latt 20 years,'as to induce feveral of the young metfs 
to leave the parifti ; a circumftance, which will account fori 
the great difference, betwixt the number of men and 
men at prefent refiding in it. The return to Dr Webftery 
in 1755, was 686 fouls.

gether with the weekly colleftions, amounting together trti 
about L. 6 Sterling yearly, is divided among them ; anm 
if at any time, one or more are bed-rid, it is cuftomary ti: 
hang up a bag in the mill for them, into which the tenanti 
put a handful of meal, when they grind their corn. Therir 
are no travelling beggars, belonging to the parifti, andvee 
ry few pals through it at any time, except in the month^ 



of Lochlee. 36,1 

of June and July. At that feafon 120 and upwards, tra- 
verfe yearly, begging wool ; of whom, many feem to be 
real objefts of charity, but numbers of them appear to be 
of a different dcfcription. They come from Dundee, Ar- 
broath, Montrofe, Brechin, Stonehaven and Aberdeen, for 
the above purpofe; 

Rent, Proprietor, Sif^.— The yearly rent of the parifli ia 
1714, amounted to L. 218 ; 39 wedders, at 3 s. 4.d. a head j 
31 ftone and iq lb. of butter, at 4 d. the lb ; and 46 dozen 
and 2 poultry, at 3 s. 4 d. the dozen ; the tenants paying, 
every fifth year, the double of the money rent : By ad- 
ding a fifth of the money rent, and taking the value of 
the wedders, butter and poultry, in cafli, the yearly rent 
of the parilh in 1714, amounted to L. 284 : 4 : 6| Sterling, 
Theprefent rent (1792) is L. 385, 12 s. SterUng. From 
time immemorial, the whole parifli belonged to one heri- 
tor. For fome centuries before 17 14, the proprietor's fa- 
mily name was Lindfay. His manfion-houfe, called In- 
vermark, a place about half a mile from the church, conti- 
nued to be the ordinary place of his refidence, until he mar- 
ried the heirefs of Edzell, which happened at leaft 200 
years ago, when he removed to the caftle of Edzell. The 
walls of Invermark are ftill entire. In 17 14, David Lind- 
fay, the laft proprietor of that name, fold both Lochlee and 
Edzell, to the Earl of Panmure. The Honourable Wil- 
liam Maule of Panmure, is the prefent proprietor of the 
parifli. 

Trade/men.— i:\icx&amp; are 4 Wrights, 4 tailors, 3 weavers, 
2 fmiths, and one ftioemaker in the parifh. The Wrights 
and fmiths are but occafionally employed, and therefore 
have time to attend to fmall crofts of land, a few black cat- 
tle and flieep. There is nothing but coarfe woollen cloth 



3^2 Statiflical Account 

and fome ftieeting manufaaured ; but thefe articles afford 
conftant work for the weavers. The inhabitants have been 
long in the praftice of wearing flioes made of coarfe leather 
which go by tlie name of Forfar brogues, or black leather 
llioesj the flioemaker, therefore, is able to accomplifli all 
the demands made upon him in his line, as thefe black 
leather flioes are to be had in Brechin and Forfar, and in 
moll of the markets in the neighbourhood. A day-labourer 
receives 6 d. Sterling, and his meat per day, or 9 d. with- 
out viauals. In 1 772, a day-labourer received 4 d. and his 
meat ; a wright receives 8 d. and his meat ; and a tailor 6 d.. 
and his meat per day. In 1772, a man fervant's wages for 
the half year was from L. i, 5 s. to L 1, 10 s. Sterling, with 
pafture for a fcore of ftieep ; his fee for the half year is now 
from L. 2, 10 s. to L. 3 Sterling. 

Rivers, Loch, and i^j/^.— The'principal branches of the ri- 
ver North Elk, which falls into the fea about 2 miles N. E. 
from Montrofe, take their rife in the parilh j thefe are the 
waters of Lee, of Mark, and of Tarf. The water of Leepaf- 
fes through the loch, from whence the parifli takes the de- 
lignation of Lochlee.— Lochlee abounds with trouts,. 
eels, and char. The trouts are generally of a large fize, but 
very poor, not only in the loch, but alfo in the water of 
Lee, while it runs feparately from the water of Mark ; the 
trouts in Mark and Tarf are clear and fat, but not fo big as 
in Lee. The loch is a mile long, and about the fifth part of 
a mile broad. 

Sheep, y^.— There are 9200 flicep. lambs included, 130 
goats, 192 horfes, and about 600 black cattle in the parifli. 
The horfes and black cattle are fmall. About 6000 of the 
Iheep are of the black faced kind ; above 2000 are of a crof- 
fed breed, obtained by keeping black faced rams witli ewes 

of 



of Lochlee. 



3^3 



of the white breed \ the remainder are reckoned white 
fheep. It is believed, however, that, by not attending to the 
rams in the proper feafon, the true breed of white fheep is 
entirely gone. The firft of the black faced iheep were 
brouRht into the parifh about 30 years ago. Before that 
period, three glens in the weft end of the panlh, viz. Unich. 
Mark, and Lee, extending to feveral fquare miles, were fet 
apart for the pafture of black cattle during the fummer- 
Unich is ftill employed for that purpofe, and had m it du- 
ring the months of June, July and Auguft laft, upwards of 
Jo black cattle, for which the glen-keeper received about 
IS 6d.Sterling/.rhead. The other two glens are now chiefly 
eifiployed in the pafture of flieep. There are about ic.oo 
blackfaced lambs reared in the pariQi yearly. The remainder 
are bought, either in lambs, from L. 5, to L.5, 10 s the 
fcore, orinhogs, fromL.9,to L. 10 the feore, but chiefly m 
hogs, in regard many of the bought lambs die m the au- 
tumn, of the ficknefs. The wool of the black faced ftieep 
is very coarfe, and is fold at diff-erent prices, according to 
the manner in which it is treated; a confiderable quantity of 
it is fold nnwafhed, for about 8 s. the ftone, part of it is 
waftied, but very indifl-erently, viz. by driving the Iheep 
three or four times through a pool of water, and fells at a- 
bout 10 s. the ftone what is cleanfed by hand waflimg fells 
at about i^s. the ftone. The tenants are unanimoufly of 
opinion, that Ihe pafture has an influence upon the quality 
of the wool. Perhaps, it might be proper alfo to take the 
climate into the account. The weft end of the parifti, where 
the greater part of the black faced ftieep pafture, is very 
cold, and in the winter much expofed to ftorm. The crof- 
fed breed and white ftieep, are all brought up m the parifti, 
the wool of the latter fells at i6s. the ftone •, and, in a few 
farms in the eaft end, where great attention is paid to the 
{heep, it fells from i s. 2 d. to I s. 3 d. the pound. Some of 



3^4 Statijllcal Account 

the old people remember the time, when wool from this pa^ 
rini, was fold in Aberdeen, at 30 s. Sterling the w' 
Smearing with tar and butter, is not much pradifed, except 
when the fcab is fufpefted ; man j of the lambs, are, in the 
autumn, fmeared with tobacco juice, mixed with black foap, 
and a little ftale urine, allowing about four pounds of foap to*, 
twentj pints of tobacco juice. The tobacco juice effeftually 
kills the vermin. 

Wild yJnimah.— There are many foxes in the parifti ; they 
commit great depredations among the young Iheep. Although 
the parifh is at a confiderable expence yearly, in paying a fox- 
hunter, there are fo many rocks and large cairns, where the 
foxes find flielter, that it appears fcarcelyprafticable to extir- 
pate thefe animals by hunting. A few of them are poifoned 
in the winter feafon, by dragging a piece of falted fiih well 
Ipiccd with powdered nux vomica,z[or\g a hill fide, and leaving 
it near water. If the fox comes upon the traft, he foon finds 
the bait, eats it, drinks and expires inftantly. The only dif- 
ficulty lies in finding open water in time of a fevere ftorm, 
and without this, the nux vomica does not kill. If he does 
not drink immediately after eating, he commonly efcapes 
by throv^ing it up. Arfenic would, no doubt, prove an ef- vl 
fedual polfon with or without water ; but as the inhabitants 
are very inattentive, it might be dangerous to ufe it. There 
are many wild cats alfo in the rocks and cairns, but they do 
little or no hurt among the fheep. There are plenty of 
white hares in tlie hills, and feveral deers, and a few roe- 
bucks traverfe the glens. The rocks abound with eagles 
and hawks, and the hills with moor fowl. There are but 
few partridges in the parifti. 

Roads and Bridges — Until 1764, there were no roads 
within the parifli fit for wheel-carriages, fince that time the 
inhabitants have, by ftatute labour, made a tolerable cart 

road 



of Lochlee, 



365 



oad from the eaft end of the parifli to the weftmofl dwel- 
ing houie in it. The only place of accefsfor wheel carriages 
.i at the eaft end; and, it is probable, this will always con- 
tinue to be the cafe, the furrounding and fteep hills, in every 
other quarter, rendering it difficult to make a cart road to 
Glenmuick, Glcntamir, Navar or Clova ; and the little in- 
tercourfe with thefe places rendering it unneceflary. Many 
of the tenants have alfo made private cart roads for their own 
onveniency, fo that carts are now much ufed. Before 
764, there were no carts in the parifh. There are 3 Hone 
^bridges, one upon Tarf, another over .Mark, and the third 
about a mile below the jundlion of Lee and Mark. The 
above bridges were all built fince 1 749. 

Fuel. — Hitherto the inhabitants have been well fupplied 
with peats ; but as the mofles, in feveral places upon the 
lov/ ground, are riearly worn out, their fuel will be obtain- 
ed with greater difficulty and labour, in a few years hence ; 
in regard that the hills, although in many places covered 
with inexhauftible mofs, are, at prefent, inacceffible ; and it 
would require very confiderable fums of money to make 
pven tolerable roads of communication.. 

Ecclejiajlical State, is'c. — From the time of the Reforma- 
tion to 1723, Lochlee and Lethnot made but one charge; the 
minifler refided at Lethnot, where he had a manfe and glebe. 
It appears by a decreet pafled in 1717, that the ftipend a^ 
mounted to loco merks Scotch, with L. 50 Scotch for com- 
munion elements. During the above period, the minifter 
preached two days at Lethnot for one day at Lochlee, and 
in tempeftuous feafons of the year, the inhabitants of Loch- 
lee remained without public worfhip altogether. As a re- 
medy for this difadvantage, John Llndfay of Edzell, at that 
$jme alfo proprietor of Lochlee, by a deed of mortificationj 

dated

dated at Edzell, " the twentle twa day of Auguft, ane 
" thoufand fix hundereth fyftie nyn years," fet apart two 
crofts of land, adjoining to the church of Lochlee, loo merks 
Scotch, 6 bolls of oat-meal, with pafture for one horfe, one ; 
cow and 20 flieep, for the maintenance of a catechifing j 
reader at Lochlee, whofe office was to convene the pa. 
riftiioners in the minifter's abfence, to read a portion of 
fcripture, and to pray with them. In 1723, Lochlee wase 
made a feparate charge. Lethnot and Navar being joined v 
together, and the manfe and glebe of Navar with nine hua-i 
dred merks Scotch of ftipend, andL. 50 Scotch for commu-: 
nion elements, were decerned to belong to the minifter of* 
Lochlee. In 1726, the heritor agreed to build a manfe at; 
Lochlee, and to the defignation of a new glebe there, in ex-;- 
cambion for the glebe and manfe of Navar •, in the executionn 
of which, it was found, that the glebe of Navar was equal inn 
value to four feventh parts of a farm, near the church of t 
Lochlee, called the Kirk-town. The minifter of Lochlee,-, 
therefore, now enjoys as a glebe, four feventh parts of thee m 
arable land, grafs and hill pafture, that formerly belongedjjfoi 
to that farm, and L. 54 : 3 : 4 Sterling of ftipend and com- J'ef 
munion element money. The manfe was built in 1 750^1, 
and is at prefent in tolerable repair. The walls of the* 
church, although apparently very old, are ftill in good re 
pair •, the roof was thatched with heath till 1784, when im 
was covered with flates. Since the year 1723, the morti-i- 
fication above mentioned has been enjoyed by the paro- 
chial fchoolmafter, he having no other falary. The Ho- 
nourable Society for propagating Chriftian knowledge, have, 
for many years appointed a fchoolmafter, to teach in corners ■ 
of the pariih moft diftant from the parifli fchool, a meafuree 
that has tended very much to diffeminate knowledge in it. . 
The church and parochial fchool are near the centre of thee 
parifli, if regard is had to the boundary of the hill pafture;

fcut thej are far otherwife in refpedl of the inhabited part, 
there being only three families refiding weft from the church. 
The King is patron of the parifh. The church of Lochlee 
is fituated about 8 miles from the church of Glenmuick, 
10 from the church of Edzell, 9 from the church of Leth- 
not, 8 from the church of Clova, and 20 miles from Bre- 
xiim, the neareft poft town. The only road for wheel car- 
riages from Brechin to Lochlee, lies in a diredtion north 
from Brechin for about 7 miles, till it crofs the Gannachy 
bridge, in the parifli of Edzell ; when, for feveral miles a- 
long the north fide of the river North Elk, it takes a north 
wefterly diredlion. It enters Lochlee at the eaft end, and from 
thence to the church. There are 6 miles in the diredion of 
weft, or rather W. S. W. 

Mlfcellaneous Obfevjations. — The farmers are fiibjeded 
to no fervices by the heritor, with the following exception, 
that each tenant is to furnifli a man and horfe for two days 
in the year, to attend the proprietor, if deftred ; and in pro- 
portion to their rents, to carry materials for building and 
repairing the church, manfe, fchool, and public buildings in 
the parifli. The rents are paid forehand, that is to fay, the 
rentfor crop 1793, is paid, the firft half, at Whitfunday 1792, 
and the laft half at Martinmas 1792. — The rocks abound 
with limeftone, but fo full of fand as to require no addition- 
al mixture when ufed as mortar*. It makes, however, a 
ftronger cement, when ufed in building, and ftands the froft 

better than the lime brought from the low country. There 

is a vein of lead ore that runs through theparifti, in a diredion 
nearly caft and weft. About the year 1728, a company 

of

of miners were employed for fome time in making a trial i 
of it. They gave it as their opinion, that it was well worth 
the working ; but as they had no overfeer, and their employ- 
ers relided at a great diftance, the trial came to nothing, and : 
was given up. 

CharaBer. — The inhabitants are, for the moll part, re- ■ 
gular in their lives, none of them, fince the commencement : 
of this century, having been fubjedled to any criminal profecu- • 
tion, except one accufed of murder, who was fugitated in i 
1776. Dram drinking, indeed, has, of late, become more : 
frequent among them, and may be produftive of other bad i 
pradlices. The charadler of the people, however is, on the : 
whole, refpeftable ; and if they want fomewhat of that po- ■ 
lilh, which prevails in more fertile and more populous di- 
ftrifts, they are alfo free from many of thofe fafliionabic ■ 
vices, by which the others are diltinguilhed. </p>

NUMBER XXIV. 
PARISH OF <name ref="NA">CRAIGIE</name>. 
(county of AYR.) 

By the Rev. Mr Andrew Shaw.</head> 



<p>Name, EreBion, &amp;c. 

THE name Craigie appears to have been given to this 
parifh, from feveral craigs or rocks, which are fituated 
near the church . This parifh and that of Riccartoun, 
were formerly united, but were disjoined in 1647. It ap- 
pears from records, that there were, at that time, in the two 
pariflies, above 2000 communicants, which far exceeds the 
number in both at prefent. What caufes have produced 
this decreafe, it may, perhaps be difficult to afcertain. A 
confiderable part of a fm all pari (h, called Barmbell, v^Xiidi 
was fupprefled in the year 1673, when that of Stair was 
eredled, is now annexed to Craigie. 



Exte?it, Situation, Surface, and Soil. — This pariih is about 
7 Englilli miles in length, and i^'va. breadth. It is fxtuated in 
Vol. V. 3 A that

that diftria: of Ayrlhire, called Kyle, in the preQjytery of 
Ayr, and in the Synod of Glafgow and Ayr. Near the 
church and manfe it is hilly. One may walk, in the ftiort 
fpace of 5 minutes, from the manfe to the top of one of the 
neighbouring hills, which, though not p erhaps more than 
5C0 feet above the level of the fea, yet commands a moft 
extenfive and delightful profpea. It may be fafely faid, that, 
above loo fquare miles of rich land may be feen ; and that 
in all that extent, almoft every nobleman and gentleman's 
feat, every town and village, every garden and wood, ap. 
pear diftinftly. Here alfo are beheld the venerable Ben- 

lomond, and feveral of the other Grampian hills, the frith 

of Clyde flowing beautifnlly to the ocean the ridges 
in the Ifle of Jura,— the lofty tops of Arran, and the maje- 
ftic rock of Ailfa, beyond which the hills of Ireland feem to 
rife from the fea. — The foil in general is rather light and 
gravelly. Some parts of if confift of a thin poor clay, but 
there are many fields of a deep ftrong clay, which, when 
properly cultivated, produce, in favourable feafons, very 
rich crops. The greateft part of the pariHi is arable, and 
inclofed with hedge and ditch, but fome parks are furround- 
ed with ftone dikes. There are likewife fome good fields of 
meadow ground. The hills are covered with verdure, and 
afford excellent pafture for cattle. 

Minerals.— M^ny parts of this parifh contain coal, 
though only one pit is at prefent wrought. In fome pla- 
ces which were wrought not long ago, two feams were 
found ; the one a hard and lafting, and the other a light, or 
what is called a candle coal. When thefe were burnt to- 
gether, they made an excellent fire. There are alfo 2 oa^ 
great lime-works, whofe diftance from coal is not above 2 
Englifli miles. About 60,000 bolls of lime may be raifed, 
annually. The profit thence arifing muft be confiderable, 

while

while the neighbourhood is greatly benefited by the lime, 
forae of which has been carried fouthward, above 9 Eng- 
lifh miles. Thefe lime works are in the eaftern parts of 
the parifh, and the weftern part of it is fupplied with lime 
from quarries, furrounding the limits of this pariih to the 
norths 

Climate, Difeafes, &amp;c. — The air, in general, is pure, and 
there are no diftempers peculiar to the pariih. Many of 
the inhabitants arrive at the age of 8b, fome at that of 90 
years. They live neither in towns nor villages ; they are 
employed chiefly in the open air, and are aftive, fober, and 
induftrious ; they are of late much improved in their drefs 
and manner of living, and dwell in houfes more neat and 
cleanly than formerly ; circumftances which mud contri- 
bute to health. 

Produce and Cattle. — The grain chiefly cultivated in this 
parifli, is oats. Peafe, beans, and barley, are alfo raifed, 
but in much fmaller quantities *. Potatoes are planted by 
almoll every family for their own fubfillence. Confider- 
able quantities of rye-grafs and clover feeds, are alfo fown. 
No turnips, cabbages, or hemp, are raifed, and little flax^ 
excepting fome for private ufe. More grain is raifed than 
is confumed in the parifti ; and much butter and cheefe is 
fent to the markets of Ayr and Kilmarnock, and even to 
Paifley and Glafgow f . — Great attention is now given to 

the 

* Peafe and beahs are fown in the beginning of March, oata. from the 
middle of March to the end of April, and barley foon after the middle of 
April. Harveft generally begins about the middle of September, and is fi- 
nilhed about the middle of Odlober. 

t The price of every article of provifion has rifen greatly of late, parti- 
cularly of beef, butter, cheefe, hens, and eggs ; and may rife ftiil higher, in 
proportion as manufa£lurcs increafe, and as this country becomes more rich

the improvement of the breed of cows and horfes, which 
have rifen greatly in value within thefe few years. The 
number of horfes, young and old, may be 246, and of 
cows 738. There are only a few flieep. 

Population. — Upon comparing the prefent amount of an- 
nual baptifms, with that of any particular period, for a confi- 
derable timepaft, the ftate of this parilh, with refpeft to po- 
pulation, does not appear to have been materially altered. 
Owing to the enlargement of farms, to the demolition of 
cottages, and to the increafe of manufaftures in the neigh- 
bourhood, (to which perfons of all ages refort), its popula- 
tion might, perhaps, be fuppofed on the decline. Yet it is a 
faft, that the return to Dr Webfter amounted only to 
551 ; and, at prefent, the number of parifliioners, young 
and old, are not under 700 *. They are moftly farm, 
crs, fome are lime quarriers, fome day-labourers, and there 
are a few of thofe tradefmen, who are effentially neceffa- 
ry in every country parifti -j-. At an average for the laft 
5 years, there have been 6 marriages, 14 baptifms, and 9 
burials, annually. 

Heritors, 

and populous. The prices of the above mentioned articles are reg'.'hted by 
the markets of Kilraarnook and Ayr; and they are alfo, in a great raeafure^ 
a£Fe£led by the more diftant markets of Glafgow and Paifley.

have very confiderable eftates ; the property of the o- 
ther 6 is fmall. The valued rent is L. 3236 : 13 : 3 Scotch. 
From the improvements made by the fuperior ikill and in- 
duftry of the tenants, and alfo from the advanced price of 
the produce of land, the rent has greatly increafed within 
thefe lafl 30 years •, yet the tenants are in a better condi- 
tion than they were before that time. The leafes are com- 
monly for 19 years. The ground is cropped for 3 years, and 
refts 6. The number of Scotch acres is aibout 5500. The 
rent is from los. t0 20s. /)fr acre, taking the average of 
which, the prefent rent of the parifti muft be about L. 4000 
Sterling per annum. But, as fome of the land is in the 
hands of the proprietors, that cannot be exactly afcertained. 
The farms are very unequal. Some are fo fmall, as to be 
under L. 20. Some are from L. 40 to L. 60, and others are 
as high as L. 140 per aimurn. 

Church, Manfe, and Stipend. — The church was built an?iaf 
1776, is a neat and commodious place of worfliip, and may 
contain about 600 people *. The manfe was built anno 
1745, and has fince been at different times repaired. The 
ftipend confifts partly of viftual, and partly of money ; and, 
including the glebe, may amount to L. 96. The right of 
•patronage belongs to William Campbell, Efq-, of Craigie. 

Schools. — Here is a parochial fchool, and the mafter has 
a legal falary, a houfe adjoining to the fchool, and alfo a 

garden. 

• The kirk of Craigie is faid to have been formerly called the Kirk in the 
^Forejl, which name was probably given it, from its being fLirrounded by 
woods ; but few trees aie now to be feen near it. It is alfo faid, that in this 
church, fchemes were concerted by fome of the principal reformers, whofc 
eftates lay in the neighbourhood, for oppofing the meafures of the Queen 
Regent, and for promoting the interefts of the Reformation, at its com- 
mencement.

garden. The number of fcholars is much greater in win- 
ter than in fummer; and, at an average, during the year 
may be about 60. The wages, per quarter, are, for Eng! 
lifli, IS. 6d. ; for writing, 2s. ; for arithmetic and Latin, 
2 s. 6 d. ; and a complete fyftem of book-keeping is taughti 
forios. 6d. The fchoolmafter's place, including all per- 
quilites, may amount to L. 30 Sterling. 

Poor. — There are, at prefent, 12 perfons who receivce 
public charity. The fum fpent yearly, for their fupport, iss 
about L. 20. This arifes from the weekly coUcftions madec 
in the church, and from the intereft of a fum of money t 
belonging to the parifli. None who refide here are vagrants... 
Attentl on is given, that the children of thofe who are needyr 
and indigent, be properly educated. 

Roads. — The roads were formerly made and kept in re 
pair by the ftatute labour, but this is now converted intoo 
money ; 3 d. is paid for every pound Scotch of valuation, . 
which may amount to about L. 40 Sterling yearly. Thee 
roads are kept in good order, conlidering this great num- ■ 
berof coal and lime carts that are conftantly pafling over: 
them. 



CharaBer — The people are regular, peaceable, and induM. 
ftrious ; anxious, in their feveral occupations, to provide forf 
themfelves and their families ; and what they acquire bjT 
aftive labour, they enjoy with moderation. Few of them may 7 
be called rich, though almoft all of them are fax removedi 
from poverty. When circumftances occur, that call forthh. 
their humanity, they are charitable. They enjoy, in a . 
reafonable degree, the benefits and comforts of fociety, anfd4 
are, in general, contented with their circumftances and fi- 
tuation in life.</p>

<p>Situation, Extent, i^c. 

^ I ^HE parifh is fituated on the north fide of the Grampian 
mountains, in the bounds of the Synod of Aberdeen, 
ind prefbytery of Kincardine O'Niel, about ico miles 
lorth from Edinburgh, and 21 nearly weft of Aberdeen, 
t reaches'from the top of the Cairnie-mount to the river 
Dee, which meafures 11 miles, and comprehends, accor- 
ilng to furvey, 31,659 Scotch, or 40,230 EngHlh acres. 
The arable ground is but fmall in proportion to the extent, 
perhaps only a fifteenth part of the whole. Over the 
Sairnie-mount there is a moft excellent road, well accom- 
nodated with bridges, which lays open the communication 
rom the fouthem, to the northern and eaftern parts of 
Scotland, and the refort of travellers is very confiderable. 



Hills. 



37^ Statijiical Account

Hills. — The altitude of the higheft hills, from the level 
of the fea, according to a furvey made feme years ago, is J o'd 
as follows: Kerloack. 630 yards, Montbattack 11 ro 1 tf 
Kloachnabane 790. On the top of this lafl; mentioned hill, 
there is a large rock, commonly called the ftone of Kloach- » iei 
nabane, acceffible only on one fide. It is a land mark for 
fliips at fea, and commands a moft extenfive profpeft of the 
adjacent country, and a long tra£t of the fea coaft. 



Heritors and Rent. — The proprietors are Alexander 
Burnett, Efq; of Strachan, Francis Ruffell, Efq-, of Black- 



hall, and John Douglas, Efq-, of Tilliwhilly, proprietor of : ^ 
the lands of Gellan. At Blackhall there is an excellent ; 
modern houfe lately built, and there are large plantations ii 
of fir and birch along the banks of the Dee, for 2 or 3^ 
miles. The valued renj; of the parilh is L. 2033 : I4 :3|i jc 
Scotch. 



Church, School and Poor. — A new manfe was built about 
15 years ago, for the accommodation of the minifter, and 3 
new church laft year, which is very well finifhed in evetj^ 
refpeft. Mr Burnett is patron. The ftipend, including the 
value of a fmall glebe, and L. 20 Scotch of grafs money, 
may amount to nearly L. 70 Sterling. — The funds for the n 
fupport of the poor amount to L. 8 Sterling, arifing from ? 
intereft of money, and from L. 9 to L. 10 of colleftions on ■: 
the Sundays, and when the facrament is difpenfed. It goes 
a great way to relieve the moft necefficous poor. — There is 
a parochial fchoolmafter, with a legal falary ; but fome parts r 
of the parifti reap little benefit from the fchool, being at a 
great diftance, and waters intervening ; which particularly 
is the cafe, as to the glen of Dye, the upper part of which 
is about 6 miles diftant. The encouragement given to 
fchoolmafters is by no means adequate to their ufefulnefs ;

for which feafon, in country pariflies, they are generally 
obliged to put up with fuch as have not had the opportuni- 
ty of much education, or may have made choice of that 
line of life, only for a temporary convenience, having other 
fchemes in view. It were to he wilhed, that fuch an ufeful 
clufs of men were put into a fituation, that would make 
them more refpedted, and confequently more ufeful to the 
public. 

Population, ISc — The parifh contains about 700 fouls. 
They follow, in general, the farming line, and there are but 
few tradefmen among them. The number of males and fe- 
males, births, marriages, and deaths, are much in the ufual 

, proportion. The population, it would appear, has decreafed 
of late, the return to Dr Webfter in i755 amounting to 
796 fouls principally owing to fome of the farms having 
been converted into Iheep pafture, and fome leffer ones 
conjoined. The pariftiioners all regularly attend public 

, worlhip, and, with a very few exceptions, are of the Jlfta- 
blifhed Church. They are fober and induftrious. 

Agriculture and Produce. — Improvements, though now 
begun, have made as yet but fmall progrefs. One great 
obftruftion is the fituation of the farmers, who confift moft- 
ly of fuch as have faved a little money, while in fervice, 
with which they fettle upon a farm, and owing to the 
fmallnefs of their ftock, muft of confequence contrad debt, 
which, by their utmoft exertions afterwards, they are rare- 
ly able to extinguifti. There is as much grain raifed, as 
may be fufficient to fupport the inhabitants. The farmers 
now begin to raife hay, turnips, and potatoes •, but oats and 
bear are the chief produce of this part of the country. A 
good many black cattle and flieep are reared on the feveral 
farms, which, during the fummer months, generally pafture

m the hills. They are, for the moft part, of a fmall fize 
Sheep, brought from the fouth of Scotland, commonly turn 
out well, and there are a great many of thefe in the glen of 
Dye. It is a general praftice, among the farmers, to put 
their flieep into houfes during the night, which is hurtfiil 
to the ftieep, and likewife to the .wool. 

MiJ'cellaneoiis Ohfervations. — There is no marl as yet 
found out, in this part of the country, but limeftone is to % 
be had in the neighbourhood in great plenty. It is moft 
commonly burned with peats and turf, from the hills, 
which is the fuel generally made ufe of, and with which 
the country is well fupplied. — There are two waters, which 
run through this parifh, the Feugb and the Dye, which take 
their rife in the Grampian mountains, unite about a quar- 
ter of a mile above the church, and fall into the Dee 2 
miles below. On both thefe ftreams there is, in the feafon 
excellent rod-fifhing for grilfe, fea and burn trout. On the 
hills, which are moftly covered with heath, with grafe 
grounds interfperfed, moor game abound. Hares, partridges', 
and wild ducks, are likewife to be found in the more cul- 
tivated parts of the parifli. There are a good many deer 
in the woods. — A man fervant, who is reckoned a good 
hand, will draw yearly upwards of L. 5 Sterling of wages. 
A woman fervant about half that fum. A day-labourer will; 
earn about lod. a-day. The women's chief employment 
is knitting worfted ftockings, and fpinning fadtory yarn. 
The manufafturers fend out the wool, properly drfifled, 
and afterwards come and receive the ftockings, when 
manufa£lured, for which they pay according to the quality. 
They have agents in the countiy, who give out the flax 
and receive the yarn.</p>

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q33980">CERES</name>, 

(county of fife.) 

By the Rev. Robert Arnot, D. D. 
Minifler of that Parijh.</head> 



<p>Origin of the Name. 

THE parifli of Ceres is one of the diftrifts, which con- 
ftitute the prefbytery of Cupar, within the bounds of 
the Synod and county of Fife. It takes its name from the 
village in which the church ftands, fituated 2 miles and a 
half S. E. of Cupar the county towri, and prefbytery feat. 
From records, and old papers, if appears, that the ortho- 
graphy of the name was very indetermined, previous to 
the prefent century. Sometimes it was written Siras, at 
other times Sires, Cyres, Cyrus, Clres.— It is now under- 
ftood, that Ceres is the true orthography, and in this way 
the name is now almoft always written. There is no reafon 
for believing, that the name of the parifti, although the fame 
with that of the heathen goddefs, believed to prefide over 
corn, is derived from her. It is highly probable, that it 

i^,

is, like the names of mofl other places in this part of the 
ifland, of Gaelic original, bearing an allufion to the fuua- 
tion of the village, or to fome hiflorical faft concerning it. 

Extent, Soil, Mi7ierah, The greateft length of the 

parifli, from Magafk moor on the N. E. where it joins the 
parifli of St Andrew's, to Clatto-den on the S. W. where it 
joins the parifli of Kettle, is about 8 ftatute miles. The 
breadth is various, from half a mile to 4 miles. The con- 
tents may be about 8000 acres. The foil, as may be ex- 
pedled in fo great an extent of ground, is of diflferent qua- 
lities. Along the banks of the Eden, in the N. W. part of 
the parifli, it is light, inclining to fand, and lies upon free- 
ftone rock. The greater part of the parifli, is a deep cold 
earth, lying upon whinfl:one rock, limeftone rock, or tilly 
clay. A fniall extent, around the village, is a free earth 
lying upon gravel. There are two conflderable moflTes, and 
Several moors, fome of greater, fome of fmaller extent. 
The parifli, in general, is hilly ; but none of the hills are 
of great height, or very flieep : Almofl: all of them are /cul- 
tivated to the fummit. A beautiful little valley runs about 
a mile weft, and about as far eafl:, from the village. A- 
long the north lide of the parifli, there is plenty of free- 
ftone rock, not diflicult to be wrought. The fouth fide 
abounds with whinftone rock. On the farm of New- 
bigging of Craighall, there is a little hill called Gather-cold- 
, craig, the wefl; fide of which confifl:s of a mafs of bafaltie 
pillars, of an hexagonal form, of various heights and dia- 
meters, and joined at irregular diflances. There are 3 
lime works, and i coal work in the parifli, all wrought to 
a confiderable extent. The value of the coal work is 
much diminiflied by the expence of a fteam engine, for 
drawing off the water. Two coal pits, wrought in the 
parifli, about ip years ago, are now given up. 

Rivers, 



of Ceres, 



RiverSf Fijlj^ Climate, is'c. — Eden, the principal river in 
the county of Fife, abounding with excellent trout, runs 
ilong the N. W. fide of the parifh about a mile and a half. 
Three burns or brooks, one from the eaft, one from the 
ibuth, and one from the weft, unite near the village of 
Ceres, and form what is called Ceres burn ; which, after 
running a mile and a half, in a N. E. direftion, through this 
parilh, turns north through the parifti of Kemback, and 
falls into the Eden a little above Dairfie bridge. In Ceres 
burn there are a good many trouts, but the number is pre- 
vented from increafing, by the ochre water from the coal 
mines, and by the great quantity of lint, fteeped annually 
in the burn itfelf, or in the rivulets which fall into it. 
Every part of the parifh, is well fupplied, with fprings or rivu- 
lets of excellent water ; and this advantage it derives from 
its hilly fituation. On the banks of the Eden, and in the 
valley around the village of Ceres, the air is temperate 
and mild. Snow feldom lies long. Harveft begins com- 
monly about the 20th of Auguft. But in the higher parts 
of the parifh, the air is colder,— fnow lies longer, — and 
harveft does not begin till about the firft week of Septem- 
ber. The parifh is healthy, and not diftinguifhed from the 
adjacent diftridls by any particular difeafe. With regard 
to longevity, the inhabitants are on the fame footing with 
thofe in the neighbourhood. 

^^ri culture and Produce. — Within thefe laft 30 years, 
much has been done in the way of inclofing ; in fome pla- 
ces with ftone dikes, in others with hedge and ditch. 
Within the fame period, much has alfo been done in the 
way of planting : And this, together with inclofing, has 
added much both to the beauty and value of thefe eftates, 
where they have taken place. Much, however, in both 
fefpefts, yet remains to be done. The cultivation of 

wheat 



382 



Statijlical Account 



•wheat, barley, oats, peafe and beans, flax, clover, rye-grafe, 
potatoes, and turnips, is general, according as the different 
foils are fuited to them, and in fuch rotations as experience • 
has fliown to be moft profitable. Since the introdudtion of 
clover, the cultivation of peafe and beans, has been lefs at- 
tended to. The quantity of wheat, fown annually in the 
parifh, is ten times greater now, than it was 40 years ago; 
and the confumption has increafed in equal proportion.. 
The grofs produce of all kinds of grain in the parifh, may ' 
be about 12,000 bolls, which, after deducing the quanti- - 
ty neceffary for feed, will do a great deal more than fup- • 
ply the inhabitants. Potatoes form a confiderable part of f 
the food of the people, and are alfo ufed as food for hor- . 
fes. The quantity raifed is about 2000 bolls yearly. The ; 
foil being excellently calculated for flax, a great deal is cul- 
tivated; the annual produce may be about 1500 ftone : 
xveight. It will not be wide of the truth to calculate, that : 
three tenths of the ground in the parifh are yearly in til- 
lage ; fix tenths in grafs for cutting, and for paflure ; and 1 
one tenth in mofs, moor, and planting. In ploughing,, 
horfes are chiefly ufed ; where oxen are employed, 2, , 
together with 2 horfes, are reckoned fufficient. Thirty • 
or 40 years ago, 4 oxen and 2 horfes were employed in : 
each plough ; 2 good horfes are now found fufRcient ; and ; 
the fame man, that holds the plough, alfo drives it. Both 
the old Scotch plough, and the Englifli, with a curved . 
mould- board, are ufed. The latter now, is the more fre- 
quent of the two.

Far?ns, l^c. — The farms in the parifh, are of various ex- 
rents ; from 20 to 400 acres, and the rents different, from 
5 s. to L. I, 10 s. the acre, according to the foil and fitua- 
tion. A great many farms in the parifli, belonging to the 
•ftate of Craighall, were feued about the beginning of the 
prefent century ; thefe, owing to the rife of the value of 
land, and improvements in agriculture, although feued out 
at the full rent, are now become of greater value to the 
feuers than to the fuperior. — Upon the different farms, a 
cottager, or, as he is commonly called, a cotter, is kept for 
each plough employed on the farm. He is bound to ferve 
the farmer in all forts of neceffary labour, and is allowed, 
belides his houfe, a fmall yard for railing kitchen fluffs, 
ground for a certain quantity of flax and potatoes, has a 
cow kept for him throughout the year, and receives L. 4 
or L. 5 in money. Experience has proved this plan to be 
advantageous both for mafl:ers and fervants. Thefe cotta- 
gers are generally married, and have families, which afford 
a fupply of ufeful hands, both for agriculture and manufac- 
tures. The wages of a man fervant, not a cotter, are a- 
bput L. 8 yearly ; the wages of a maid fervant, L. 2, 10 s. 
or L. 3 a-year. Day labourers receive i s. a-day, in the 
time of harveft and on preffing occafions, more is given. 

Trade 

* About 50 years ago, there were not fewer than 20 flocks of flieep 
kept in the parifli ; which, allowing ten fcore to each flock, would make 
the whole number of Iheep, 4000. The flocks are now reduced to two.

It would appear, thaf the population of the parilh had 
incrcafed- very faft towards the beginning of the prefent 
century. But for a good many years paft, it feems to 
have decreafed ; the return to Dr Webfter, in 1755, a- 
mountlng to 2540 fouls. The army, navy, and diffe- 
rent purfuits in life, carry away many young men; and 
this, as it prevents the increafe of population, is likewife 
the reafon, why the number of females is fo much greater 
than that of the males, although the births of the latter ex- 
ceed thofe of the former.

the provoftry of Kirkheujjh, a religious houfe at St Andrew's, Jbrne re- 
mains of which arc ftill t, be feen, immediately above the harbour on the 
weft, ar.d feparated from the Abbay wall by a deep hollow way A confi 
derable part of the eaft end of the parifli formerly belonged to the parilh 
of St Andrew's, and about the year 1620. was annexed to the parifli of 
Ceres, quoad fcuru tuntum. The church is a very old fabric, to which 
great additions have been made at difte.ent times. At fome remote pe- 
riod, an a.le hHs been conjoined to it, on the eaft end, by the family of 
Craufnrd, and rti-l continues to be their exclufive property. An aile has 
alfo been conjoined on the Ibuth, which is the exclufive property of the 
Hon. John Hope of Craighall. This, before the Reformation, was a cha- 
pel dedicated to St Ninian. and the fchoolmafter of Ceres, whofe place is 
in the gift of Mr Hope, receives a prefentation to be chaplain of the cha- 
pel of St Ninian. founded within the church of Ceres, and to be reader 
of that parifli. A fmall ,alary of L. 3 Scotch was payable in former times

fchools, one fupported by fubfcription, at which about 5c 
young perfons attend throughout the year; and 3 taught by 
women, at which there may be about 50 or 60 fcholars. 

Poor. — The funds, for the fupport of' the poor, arife from 
colleftions at the church-door ; money for the mortcloths at 
burials ; dues on marriages ; the rent of 3 acres of land ; the 
intereft of L. 80 Sterling lent out on bond, and the rents of 
fome feats in the church. The whole amounts to about 
L. 46 Sterling yearly. The number of poor, at an average, 
is about 20, who are relieved at their own houfes, as their 
fituations may require, according to the difcretion of the 
feffion. Occafional donations are made by fome of the he- 
ritors, of whom but few refide in the parilh. In the year 
1782, the heritors affefTed themfclves in the fum of L. 25

for the relief of the poor, during the fcarcity occafioned by 
the failure of that crop.

Rmarkalle Places. — Struthers, or, as it is called in 
/ome cldpapers^ Juchter-uther-Sti-utber, formerly the feat 
• of the Earls of Crawfurd, flands a mile and a half fouth 
.weft from the village .of Ceres. The houfe is old, with 
towers and battlements, which give it a venerable and a 
iprt of warlike appearance. — In the defcription of Fife, in 
. (^ambdcn's Britannia, Struthers is faid to derive its name 
I ^pra the number of reeds growing around it. There is, 
I indeed, a wet meadow to the fouth of the houfe, but no 
reeds are npw to be feen. The park around the houfe, in- 
' plofed with a ftone wall, contains about 200 acres of 
j ground ; there are a good many trees in different places of 
the park, particularly fome venerable beeches of a very 
large fize. 

Upon the eftate of Scot's-Tervit, or, as fome v»^rite it, 
Scotjlarvet, (the property, from which Mils Scott takes 
Iier title), there is a beautiful tower of free ftone, well hewn 
and nicely jointed. This tower is about 24 feet fquare, and 
about 50 or 60 feet high It ftands upon an eminence, and 
is feen at a great diftance in different .direftions. It has 
evidently been intended for a place of ftrength; the walls 
are thick, and the few windows in it are very fmall. The 
tower is formed by one lofty vault, on the top of another ; 
upon the top of the uppermoft, which is furrounded with a 
battlement, there is an apartment covered with flate. The 
tower flands a mile and a half weft from the village of 
Ceres. 

Craigiiall, now in ruins, formerly the feat of Sir 
Thomas Hope, already mentioned, (from whom the prin-

Eminent Perfons. — i. That branch of the noble family off 
Lindfay, diftinguifhed by the title of Byres, which, after firftt 
attaining the title of Earl of Lindfay, acquired alfo that off 
Crawfurd, had its chief refidence, for about two centuries- 
preceding 1774, at Struthers in the parifli of Ceres. This; 
branch of the Lindfay family has produced many eminent t 
flatefmen and foldiers, the account of whofe charafter and i 
tranfaftions, may be found in the general hiftory of the country. . 
3. Lindfay of Pitfcottie, author of a very entertaining hi-- 
flory of Scotland, abounding with many curious anecdotes,, 
was a native of the parifli of Ceres, and proprietor of ai 
fmalleftatein it. 3. Thomas Buchanan, redlor of Ceres; 
immediately after the Reformation, was a man of confider- ■ 
able abilities, and of great influence in the church. Owing to  
an emulation between him and Mr Andrew Melvill, Princi- ■ 
pal of the divinity college in St Andrew's, by which the ; 
peace of the prefbytery of St Andrew's was deftroyed, it : 
was found neceflary to feparate from that preflaytery, a

Others, the parifh of Ceres which were ere6ted into a new

pre%tery appointed to hold their meetings in Cupar, the 
county town. By thefe means a diftinft field was afforded 
to each of the rivals, in which he might difplay his abilities. 
Spottifwood, in his hiftory of the Church of Scotland, men- 
tions this, as having taken place in the year 1591. 4. Mr 
Thomas Haliburton, minifter of Ceres, and afterwards Pro- 
feffor of divinity at St Andrew's, was efteemed both as a 
divine and as a fcholar. Several treatifes, written by him, 
give proof of his piety and learning. 

Remarkable Occurrences.~On Wednefday the 5th day of 
Oftober 1785, Sig. Vincentius Lunardi, a Florentine, ha- 
lving afcended at Edinburgh, in an air baUoon, at 3 o'clock 
afternoon, defcended a mile to the eaflward of Ceres at 20 
minutes paft 4 P. M. This was the firft aerial voyage 
jnade m Scotland, and the daring adventurer, in performing 
:it, paffed over about 20 miles of fea, and about 12 of land. 

-Advantages and Lifadvantages.-.T:\,^ £xcife laws, and

wherever men have fafe and permanent habitations, with , || ' 
abundant fupplies of the neceffaries and conveniencles of ' "I 
life, the popiilation will increafe, in proportion as thefe ad- 
vantages are enjoyed. The highways in the parifli are 

in general very bad, owing to the depth and wetnefs of the 
foil through which they pais. ^ An act of Parliament has 
been lately obtained for making turnpike roads through the 
county of Fife, one of which is to pafs through the weft, . 
and another through the eaft end of the parifli. Thefe, 
with the bridges to be built where neceffary, in the linejjfl 
thefe roads, will be of great fervice to this neighbourhood 

i 

Mifcellaneous Ohfervations. — V/ithm thefe 30 years, mot^ 
than a half of the houfes in the country part of the parifli^ 
have been rebuilt, and in the village a good many new^n 
ones erefted ; all of them, in point of neatnefs and convex, 
nience of accommodation, far excelling the old ones. M 
great change has taken place in drefs, within the periodf^ 
above mentioned •, the plaid is now almoft wholly laid 
fide by the women, and the ufe of the cloak and bonni 
has become general. Among the men, the Scotch b 
net has given place to the hat ; the fervant men are 
nerally clothed with Engliili cloth, and many of thrift 
have watches in their pockets. The ufe of barley aflj H 
peafe for making bread, is much on the decline 5 and th|i

* The parifh of Ceres cannot boaft of any lemaikable antiquities. 
There are fome tumuli or hiliochs in the parilh, in which, upon their 
being dug into, ftone coffins, compofed of thin broad Hones, fet on edgey 
for the CJes and ends, and laid flat for the top and bottom, have been 
difcovered. The bones found in them were reduced to adies. Some 
urm have alfo been dug up, in which the aflies of human bones were, 
found. In an urn, dug up near the boundaries of the pariih of Ceres . 
and Cults, a finaller urn v.-as found inclofed, and in it, bcfulcs fomr' 
afhes of bones, a fmall brafs inftrament like the iron of a fiwemaker's 
awl, and a fmall black bead cut in a diamond form, were found.

life of bread made from wheat is now very general. It ^ 
may be fafely faid, that tea is,ufed in three fourths of the 
families in the parifh. The quantity of butcher meat 
eonfumed, is at prefent double what it was 30 years ago *. 

* In the year i'77o, a young rook, commonly called a crow in Scot- 
land, was taken out of a neft upon a tree at Struthers ; tlie bird was per- 
feaiy white, without one black featlier ; the beak, legs and claws were 
alio white ; it was tamed, and lived about two years in Struthers hoUfe. 
In voice, manner of living, and feeding, it differed not from other birds 
. of the fame fpecies. 

In the year 1788, a white fwallow was feen by many perfons, at diffe- 
rent times, through the whole of the fummer feafon, flying about the 
Tower of Scotftarvet in the weft end of the parilh. Both of the above 
particulars fell under the immediate obfervation of the compiler of this 
ftatiftical account.

(County of Ayr.) 
By the Rev. Mr William Logan.</head> 

<p>Situation, Extent, Soil, Surface, &amp;c. 



T HE parlfh of Symington, in the fliire of Ayr in thr r 
Synod of Glafgow and Ayr, and in that diftrid oft 
the county called Kyle Stewart, affords few materials for r 
ftatiftical in ve (ligation, as it contains neither any antiquities* • 
natural curiofities, nor has been the fcene of any lingular or e- 
ventful tranfaflions. The length of the paridi from S. W. to 
N. E. is little more than 4 miles, and its mean breadth about 11 ^ 
a mile and a quarter. The foil, in general, is clayey, a few | ^ 
fields excepted, of a fine vegetable mould, on a bottom of :| „ 
~ rotten rock. It prefents a furface beautifully diverfified 
•with gentle rifing grounds and floping fields. The pubhc 
road from Portpatrick to Glafgow and Edinburgh, one of ' 1 ^ 
the moft pleafant and bell frequented ia North Britain, I '

mins the whole length of the parifli ; which, in this diftria, 
as made of very durable materials, being land or whin 
ftones colleaed oifthe fields, beaten fmall, laid onto a great 
.thicknefs, and kept in excellent repair. On every fide 
there is an eafy defcent, for the rain water to run into the 
ditches, which are well fcoured from time to time. This 
road from the Monkton road, till it reaches the middle length 
of Symington, rifes by a gradual afcent, and from thence 
defcends to Kilmarnock. On the higheft parts within the 
parifh, the traveller is prefented with extenfive, beautiful, 
grand, and diverfified profpedls, confifting of the wide and 
fertile plains of Kyle and Cunninghame, with their nume- 
rous inclofures, belts, clumps of planting, and gentlemens 
feats. Thefe moft rich and delightful views are bounded 
on the fouth, eaft, and north, by difhant cloud-capp'd moun- 
tains, and on the weft by the frith of Clyde, in which . are 
feen the magnificent, and wave-furrounded rock of Ailfa, 
-the ifland of Arran, with its towering fummits, and the 
Ihips failing to and fr,om iVyr, Irvine, Saltcoats, Greenock, 
and Port-Qlafgow^ 

Water, Climate^ and Bifeafes. — There are no rivers in the 
parifii, nor even a ftream, which deferves the name of a I'lvu- 
let •, but the inhabitants are generally fupplied with excellent 
water from open fprings, or from funk wells. — From the 
quality of the foil, and the local fituation of the parilh, the 
air 13 dry and falubrious. The clouds which rife from the 
Atlantic, being attracted by the diftant hills on every lide, 
fioat in fogs on their fummits ; and, when they break into 
rain, the greatefi part of it falls on them. Hence, the 
inhabitants are remarkably healthful, and no local diftem- 
pers of any kind prevail among them. Even when they 
rare vifited by the natural fmall-pox, the difeafe is general- 
ly more mild, than in the neighbouring pariflies. Inoculation

has pnl J taken place in two or three inftances, and it were 
earneftly to be willied, that the minds of parents could be 
reconciled, to adopt that happy method of faving their 

offspring, from the ravages of a moll virulent difeafe 

There are no remarkable inftances of longevity ; but what 
is of more importance, than a few accidental examples of 
uncommon old age, great numbers enjoy the bleffings of 
health and ftrength, to an advanced period of life, and a few 
are living at prefent, who, between 80 and 90, can undergo 
confiderable fatigue in their refpeflive callings, and with 
chearfulnefs entertain the young with the tales of former 
times. 

Improvements. — About 50 years ago, this parilb, like o- 
thers in the neighbourhood, was almoft in a ftate of nature. 
At that period there were no inclofures, except the glebe, 
and a few acres adjoining, which, about 70 years ago, were 
mclofed with hedge rows. The country in winter was a 
naked wafte, fcarce a tree appeared to gratify the wan- 
dering eye, except a few about the feats of refiding heri- 
tors ; and the roads were all deep and unformed. The un- 
manured and half ploughed fields yielded fcarcely three re- 
turns ; which, after fervants wages, and a trifling rent were 
paid, afibrded only a fcanty fubfiftence for the farmer and 
his family. About the year 1740, the proprietor of the 
lands of Dankeith, who was a bachelor, and refided occa- 
lionally, planted, with tafte, feveral belts and clumps on his 
property, dreffed a few of his fields with compoft, and was a- 
mong the firft who introduced rye-grafs into Ayrfhire ; but 
as he did not refide conftantly, his improvements were par- 
tial, nor were the minds of his neighbours fufficiently enlar- 
ged, to adopt the example he had fetthem. They continu- 
ed their wretched hulbandry, without any attempt to melio- 
rate or improve the foil ; until about 20 years ago, when the 

land^

lands of Rofemount, on the S. W. end of the parifli, were 
fertilifed and beautified, by the ^kill and attention of the pro- 
prietor, who holds them moftlj in his own polTeffion. This 
gentleman, diftinguiflied by fortune and public fpirit, be- 
gan to improve his paternal inheritance, with *an ardour 
and affiduity, becoming an enlightened and generous mind. 
He laid out his fields with tafte, furrounded them with 
planting, iiaclofed them with proper fences, and meliorated 
a naturally cold, ftifF, and clayey foil, with calcareous and 
other manures. The good effedls of his improvements 
foon appeared, not only on his own property, but alfo on 
that of other proprietors, who laudably imitated the exam- 
ple, and, in a fhort time, fimilar improvements were made 
through the whole parifh, which was inclofed, and made ara- 
ble ; and the land, which before that period was let, on an 
average, for 2 s. 6d. per acre, is now let at L. i, i s. It is 
a fingular faft, and worthy of remark, that the rental of the 
lands of Rofemount, vi'hich, at the period above mentioned, 
was only L. 70 per annum, and thought to be high, is now 
nearly ten times the value ; and about 20 acres of that pro- 
perty, which was then let for one pound of butter per acre, 
and believed to be a fair rent, is now let at L. i, 5 s. 
From a fpirited and well managed hulbandry, not only the 
value of thefe lands is thus furprifingly increafed, but alfo 
the population •, for, befides a number of labourers from 
the neighbourhood, who find conftant employment, and 
unmarried fervants, there are 17 families in ftparate hou- 
fes with a numerous and healthy progeny, well lodged, 
fed, and clothed, where formerly there were but 7, every 
way poorly accommodated. 

Agriculture and 'Produce. — The mode of culture general- 
ly praftifed in the parifti is this : Every farm is divided in- 
fo three parts. Each of thefe is plowed in its turn for 3 

years, 



la 



39^ Statijlical Account 

years, and remains in grafs for other two. The tenant ' 
bound to fow grafs feeds with the third years crop,and is allow 
ed only to cut his hay for one feafon. This, however, de^ 
pnves him of the power of trying any ufeful experiments oi 
of ufmg any other kind of rotation; which, perhaps, mighn 
be more advantageous to himfelf, and more improving to the » 
foil. Hence the principal produdlions are oats and bear ( 
with fome barley. Wheat is reckoned to be a precarious t 
crop, and very little of it is raifed, from a conviftion, thati 
two crops of oats are more profitable. Green crops, fuch: 
as turnips, peafe and beans, are fown in fmall quantities,?) 
though the foil feems excellently adapted for the latter.r 
There is lime in the parifh and in the neighbourhood.! 
100 bolls, confifting of 5 Winchefter bufliels each, wheip 
flacktd; are commonly laid on each acre, before it is brokeo 
up by the plough. After this manure, the farmer may ex-s 
ped, when the feafons are favourable, two excellent fucceffiver 
crops of oats, yielding generally from 6 to 10, which may 
be eftimated to produce, at an average, 7 returns *. Littlei 
lint is railed but for domeftic ufe. Potatoes are only raife^ 
for the fame purpofe, or feeding of cattle. The farms a^i 
prefent in leafe are 25. Two of thefe confift of about 20^ 
acres each ; one of 160, two 120, two 100, two between 70*: 
and 80, fix from 50 to 60, five from 30 to 40, and the reft; 
from 25 to 12, befides a few acres rented by fome of then 
-villagers. New leafes for 19 years are granted at fronjaa 
17 s. to L. I, 5 s. and fome land about the village at L. 1,1 
iO s. /»er acre. Many of the tenants being bound to pay \ 
the cefs and ftatute labour, the latter is commuted at L, 
5 s. on each L. ico Scotch of valued rent. 

Catt/c,&amp;cc. — There are in all about 120 horfes in the parilli} 
fome are hired for farm work during the winter andfpring,;

Theprice of draught horfes is generally from L.20 to L. 25. 
W\ the ploughs, except one or two, are of the Scotch kind, 
\nd drawn by 3 horfes, becaufe the foil, in general, is deep, 
Myey, and ftifF.— There are about 290 cows, of a middle 
slz-e, and generally of a good milk kind, giving from 10 to 14 
Scotch pints per day*. The young ones reared annually may 
be between 50 and 60. Few cattle are fattened, for they do 
not yearly exceed 150. The profits in this way, no doubt, 
are fluftuating, and depend on the rife and fall of the mar- 
];ets for lean and fat cattle ; yet, as feeding is attended 
with lefs trouble and expence, than the management of the 
dairy, it may be frequently more advantageous. The 
iheep are moftly of the domefticated and improved kind, 
but the inclofures are too fmall for their walk, and they 
I re deftru6live to the hedges. 

Fi//age and Population. — The village of Symington, is 
moft delightfully fituated, in the centre of the parifli. It

f cheefe and butter made in the parilh, is L. 1276, which, at an average, is 
L. 4, 8 s. per cow. Little milk is fold in the parilh, as moft of the villa- 
Tcrs keep one or two cows. Three fourths of the butter and cheefe are 
:jld in Ayr, Kilmarnock, Glafgow, and other places. It may be thought, 
that this is a very profitable produce to the farmer or cowkeeper; but let 
it be confidered, that his rent is high, and the price of his cows general- 
ly from L. 7 to L. 9 per head ; that, to manage a dairy well, requires ex- 
pence, labour, and attention, and the hire of maid fcrvants, who under- 
(land it, is, from L. 3, 10 s. to L 4 per anvum. The wages of men fervants, 
who can plow, are, from L. 8 to L. 9 Thofe who keep cows, and rent 
no land, pay L. 2 for the giafs of each, and it will (;o(t from L. i, 5 s. to 
L.I, 10 s. to maintain them through the winter. The balance on their 
produce is but a trifling reward "for the time, co(t, care, and attention be- 
llowed on them.

It is to be regretted, that in fo fine a fituation, the houfes

population of the parifli has increafed within thefe 30 
years, owing chiefly to the many married ploughmen, and 
labourers, who live on the lands of Rofemount. One

* This mafon is alfo a farmer, but mafon work is Ifkewlfe performed 
veafonably by the cooper and the plough makers, who are very ufeful and 
expert at various otlier handicraft employments. 

f Thefe are all married, and are either hired by the day or the year, at 
the lime quarries, &amp;c. The wages of tradefmen and labourers, are the 
fame as in the neighbouring parilhes ; and the prices of provifions are re- 
gulated by the markets of Ayr and Kilmarnock. 

% The total produce of oats per annum is about 4500 bolls. Thefe bolls 
raeafure 8 Winchefter bufliels each. Of thefe oats 2 125 bolls were milled 
taft year in the parilh, / 



Statijlical Account 

Church and Heritors.— The church is old, and bears no 
date ; it is alfo dark, and too fmall. About 40 years ago, it 
received a thorough repair, being furniflied with new pews 
all painted, .and the roof was plaiHered. It has received 
fome partial repairs fince that period. The walls and roof 
which is oak, and faid to have grown in the parifli, where 
there is now no natural wood, are ftill good, but the ceiling 
begins to fail. The Earl of hglinton is patron. The fti- 
pend is 106 bolls 2 firlots of meal ; 13^ bolls bear ; and, by 
a late decreet of the Court of Teinds, L. 35, with L. 4, 33. 
-8 d. for communion elements, making in all, at the old con- 
verfion, L. 100 ; but, according to the average price of 
meal and bear, for fome years paft, its real value may be 
L. 120, exclufive of the glebe, which is not 4 acres. — In 
1786, the heritors, unfolicited, and with a liberality which 
diftinguiflies their charadler, built a large, commodious, fub- 
ftantial, and well finifhed manfe and offices. The two prin- 
cipal refiding heritors live in elegant modern houfes, plea- 
fantly lituated. One of thefe in particular commands the 
view of a rich, various, and extenfive landfcape ; and 
though by no means in an elevated fituation, yet part of 13 
different counties are feen from the top of the houfs. The 
fields, orchard, garden, and pleafure grounds around it, do 
honour to the judgment and tafte of the proprietor. 

School and Poor. — In 1788, a houfe, with a flated roof, 
was built for the fchoolmafter, confifting of a fchool-room, 
kitchen, and fmall bed-room. The falary is only 100 
merks Scotch, or L. 8 : 6 : 8 Sterling. The fees of the ma- 
fter are, for teaching Englifli i s. 6 d. ^er quarter ; for wri- 
ting, as. for arithmetic 2 s. 6d. with fome/mall emoluments, 
as feffion-clerk, and for regiftering baptifms and marriages. 
The whole does not exceed L. 23. — The number of poor in 
the parifli, who, at prefent, receive aid from the charitable 

funds, 



of Symington. . 403 



funds, are, 2 poor widows, with their young families, 3 in- 
firm and aged perfons, and i infane. There were more till 
of late. They receiye a large monthly allowance, and 
none are permitted to go a-begging. Before they are re- 
ceived on the roU, they muft acknowledge the feflion to 
have a claim on their efFeas, if they leave any. As the 
great road from Portpatrick to Glafgow, &amp;c. runs through 
the parilh, it is infefted with Irifh vagrants, and with 
ftturdy beggars from the neighbouring towns. Our funds 
for the poor on the feflion roll, are the weekly colkaions, 
which, at an average, is 6 s. per week, making L. 15, 12 s. 
per annum, and the intereft of L.260 accumulated in former 
times, when few or no poor were on the box. This fum is 
lent out on proper fecurlty, and brings yearly about L. 1 2, 
4 s. which, with the colkaions, amount to L 27, 16 s. and is 
adequate to the prefent exigencies of the poor •, but fome 
years paft, when they were more numerous, the feflion, 
who manage the funds, with the confent of the heritors, 
were obliged to encroach upon a few pounds of the capital. 
Befides afliftance to regular penfioners, occafional fupplies 
are given to diftrefled families. No parifli, perhaps, be- 
llows more liberally on the poor. It appears from an old 
:feffion record, that, about 70 years ago, the weekly coUec- 
tions, at an average, did not exceed 8 d. Sterling. 

CharaBer. — The inhabitants of this parifti, in general, 
are fober and induftrious, attentive to their refpeaive call- 
ings, and exemplarily regular in their attendance on di- 
vine ordinances. They are, for the moft part, moderate 
in their religious fentiments, charitably difpofed, and feem 
contented with their condition. They have a tafte for 
drefe, and young women of the middle, and even of the 
lower ranks, would now blufli to be feen in the blue cloaks/ 

xed plaids, and plain caps, whichonly 20 years ago, adorn- 
ed

ed their fex : Nay, even the fcarlet mantle, which lately 
was a badge of diftinftion among the daughters of farmers, 
is now defpifed ; and, 0 tempora ! 0 mores! the filk-worms 
of the Eaft muft be pillaged, to deck the heads and fhoul- 
ders of our milk-maids. The bonnet-makers of Kilmar- 
nock, no longer find demand for their manufacture, from the 
fervant men and labourers in this part of the country ; but 
hats are worn both by men and boys of all ranks. Our young 
men are not to be feen, at church or market, in a coat of 
their mother's fpinning, but drefs themfelves in EnglifK 
broad cloths, fafhionable cotton ftripes, and^fine linen. E. 
very ftripling, as foon as he arrives at puberty, muft have 
a watch in his pocket j whereas, only 40 years ago, there 
were but 3 in the parilh. 

Advantages and Dif(tdvantages. — The parifh derives fe- 
veral advantages from its local fituation, which is in a po- 
pulous, well cultivated diftrift of the country, and not a- 
bove 6 or 7 miles froni 3 principal market towns, where 
the farmer finds ready fale for the produce of his dairy 
and farm. Both limeftone and coals are in the parifh. 
The latter, at prefent, is not wrought, but it abounds in the 
neighbourhood, and the roads to the pics and quarries are 
all in excellent repair. The farms are well inclofed and 
divided, and the tenants comfortably lodged. But among 
the many advantages of the parilh, there are a few difad- 
vantages, and the want of manufaftures in the village is 
none of the leaft. An individual, for 3 years paft, has 
made an attempt to carry on a branch of the woollen ma- 
nufiiflure, by which he ernploys a few fpinfters ; but want 
of ftock obliges him often to purchafe the materials on 
credit, and confequently, at a high price ; and to fell the 
produce inftantly, at whatever ready money it will bring. 
Were moderate feus granted, and encouragement given to 

woollen

vooUen or cotton manufafturers, to fettle here, the plea- 

mtnefs of the fituation, the purity of the air, the excel- 
lence of the water, the goodnefe of the roads, the nearnefs 
of coal, and the vicinity of Symington to fo many mar- 
ket towns, would render it a moft eligible place. Were 
inch branches carried on to any confiderable extent, the 
property around would be rendered ftill more valuable, 
mA old and young, who could work, might be profitably 
-mployed. There are 2 corn mills in the parifti, where, 

vhen fupplied with water, (which fails in froft or drought), 
the beft oat-meal in the country is made but this ad- 

. antage is clogged with a material difadvantage. Many 
the tenants are reftrifted to a heavy thirlage, which is 
a pernicious check on agriculture, and is a fpecies of vaf- 
fallage, that ought to be abolilhed in every civilized and 
improving country. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — There are only two houfes 
where ale and Britifli fpirits arc fold ; one in the village, 
which is not much frequented ; and the other by the fide 
of the public road, where the weary traveller may find 
refrefhment. — No perfon belonging to the parifti, has been 
judicially impeached or convifted of any crime, in the 
memory of the oldeft inhabitant, except' one unfortunate 
^oman, who was baniflied many years ago.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1521500">HOLME</name>, 
(county of ORKNEY.) 

By the Rev. Mr James Alison.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, Kxtent, Surface, and Sea Coajl. 

^ t ""HE word Holme is of Danifh origin, and is defcriptive 
-t*- of the local fituation of the parifli, which ftretches 
along the meandering banks of that beautiful and well fre- 
quented frith, to which it gives the name of Holme Sound, 
leading from the Caledonian to the German fea, bj Strom- 
nefs. It belongs to the prefbytery of Kirkwall, and Synod 
of Orkney, and was formerly a part of that bifhoprick. It 
is fituated 4 miles diftant from the town of Kirkwall, on 
the S. E. fide of Pomona, or Main. Land, and declines gen- 
tly to the fouth. From its pofition, detached from the 
fcenes of buftling life, nothing but a bare recital of ordina- 
ry incidents can be expedted. It extends 6 Scotch miles 
froqa W. to E. in length, and between i and a in breadth 

from 



of Holme.

'rom N. to S. A promontory, named Howquoy Head, 
cms the entrance to the found on the weft. Another 
..omontory, called Rofenefs, limits its departure into the 
eaft fea. In the middle of the found, neareft the weft en- 
try, there is an ifland aim oft circular, termed Lambbolme, 
about 3 miles in circumference, belonging to the parifli, in 
which there is one farm, which forms a pretty fecure an- 
chorage, between and the Main Land, for flaips of 200 tons 
burden, and a fmall pier, where veffcls of 50 tons may lie 
alongfide \ it is named Holme Sound Bay. Through this 
part of the found, the poft between Kirkwall and Edin- 
burgh cioffes, to the diftance of about half a league. The 
lliores in general are low and rocky, yielding to the pro- 
prietors, communihus annis, 50 tons of kelp, befides a very 
confiderable- quantity of fea-ware for manure. The interjacent 
fpace, betwixt the four adjoining parifhes and this, is an 
undivided common, feparated from the arable ground by 
an earthen dike. This common is covered v/ith heath and 
mofs, from which the inhabitants of thefe furrounding pa- 
riflies are fupplied with pfeats and turf, their only fuel. It 
abounds with moorfowl, ducks, teals, fnipes, green and 
grey plovers. 

Soil. — The foil in this parifli is, in general, light, thin, and 
loamy, intermixed with fmall ftones, but apparently com- 
pofed of the remains of the original mofs, with which it 
feems to have been formerly covered ; and the unduous 
and tilly bottom, which, by long culture and manure, 
mixed with ware, has fertilifed it to that degree, as to pro- 
duce, in ordinary feafons, more than fuflicient for the de- 
mands of the inhabitants. 

Produce. — The vegetable produftions are big, (a fmall 
fpecies of barley), of which meal and malt are made, and 

which

which more than fupplies the demands of the parifliioners j 
and the furplus is transferred to the burgh of Kirkwall 
moftly in malt, being the kind of rent the farmers are 
obliged to pay to the fuperior and landmafter. There is 
likewife an inferior kind of grey oats, of a lean quality, of 
which is made a weak but wholefome meal, not exceeding 
the demands of the parifh. No other grain is propaga- 
ted here, nor feems to fuit the foil or climate. Experientia 
docet. — The ufual time of fowiug' oats is from the begin- 
ning of March, and of big from the beginning of May, 
both O. S. and they are ufually reaped in September. 
This parifh has been in the practice of fowing flax-feed 
for loo years back, and for the laft 30 years to a very 
confiderable extent ; by their manufacturing whereof, their 
domeftic requifites are furniflied complteely, and no contemp- 
tible quantity is fent annually to the eaft coaft of England. 
The common grift of the cloth is from 900 to 1200, and 
fome have exceeded 1800. By an accurate account, taken 
for feveral years previous to the 1787, there were upwards 
of 20,000 yards manufa£tured and bleached yearly in this ; 
parifti, of its own growth. This feed is fown the firft of : 
May, and pulled after the middle of Auguft. Since the year ■ 
1765, (when the crop was blafted by a hurricane on the 7th 1 
of Auguft, over the whole of this county), potatoes have r 
been introduced and propagated with much fuccefs ; and 1 
every individual nowfhares in this ^public benefit. They 
are planted in the end of April after the plough,, 
and raifed about the end of Auguft. The climate and foil i 
is peculiarly favourable for cabbages, both in gardens ^ 
and in the fields, although in the latter not fo common. 
They ftand out the feverity of winter, and are whole- • 
fome and firm in April. The feed is fown in June, in a 
{m2M pennorhught, and the plants are tranfplanted into the; 
gardens, in the March following, and into the ^fields about 



of Holme. 4^9 

the middle of June, and fucceed well. Turnip feed fown 
here whether in the gardens or fields, thrives well, and 
Sives large returns. The feed is fown in May and June. 
Rye-grafs and clover feeds, from the luxurious crops pro- 
duced feeai fuited to this foil and climate, whether fown 
alone or with grain; although the latter method is found to 
be moft advantageous, as the ftubble ftielters the tender 
plants from the inclemency of the feafons. 

Agriculture and {7«#?/^.-Improvements in agriculture 
are at leaft, a century later than in the more fouthern coun- 
ties of Scotland. A plough with one ftilt, correfpondmg to 
the Italian, defcribed by Virgil in his firft Georgic, is gene- 
rally ufed. 

Continuo in Sylvis magna vi flexa domatur 
In burim, et curvi formam accipit ulmus aratn. 
Huic a ftirpe pedes temo protentus in ofto, 
Bina aures, duplici aptantur dentalia dorfo. 
Cseditur et tilia ante jugo levis, altaque fagus, 
Stivaque, qu« currus a tergo torqueat imos. 

This very imperfeft inftrument for improvement, is drawn 
by 4 horfes, two and two a-breaft, and fometimes by three 
a-breaft, of the breed of horfes from Strathnaver, and the 
ploughman carries it under his arm, around the end of the 
ridge. A few two-ftilted ploughs in miniature, a faint i- 
mitation of the old Scottirn plough for tearing out leys, 
are beginning to be ufed, but feldcm on other occafions. 
Harrows of two bulls, with wooden teeth, are drawn by an 
ox or heifer. Want of timber is a great bar to the progrefe 
of improvement here. Manure is carried in ftraw baf- 
kets on horfes backs, to the more diftant fields, and to 
thofe nlgher, upon men and womens backs. A few carts in

miniature are beginning to be ufed, drawn by an ox iathe 
fliafts. All the cattle are of an inferior fize. The flieep 
though fuch beneficial creatures, are much neglefted and ill 
treated ; inilead of fliearing the fleece, it is pulled ofF the 
very fkin ; and to undergo this cruel operation, they are 
caught with dogs. A fleece, in general, will not weigh above 
3 lbs. Amfterdam, and for the moft part is mixed with hair. 

Po/)«/«^zo«.— The ancient ftate of the population cannot, 
with any degree of precifion, be afcertained, owing to the 
parifti regifters being inaccurately kept. The return to Dr 
Webfter, in 1755 was 1185 fouls. Since the 1766, theregifter 
of bapt fms, marriages, and burials, have been exaftly kept. 
In that year, the number of fouls was 810 ; and, by an 
accurate enumeration made in 1792, there were only 300 
males, and 402 females. Thisdecreafe is not owing to more 
diltempers or fewer births, but to a difpofition in the 
youth to leave their native country, and follow the fea- 
faring life, wherein they generally acquit themfelves with 
reputation and advantage. Although there are upwards of 
50 farmers, who pay from L.6 toL. 12 Sterling of yearly 
rent, and who have brought up from 5 to 10 children of 
both fexes, yet there are not four of them who have the 
afllftdncc of a fon at home of 20 years of age. from 1 5 to 
that p-ricd, the youths go to the fea, and often never return 
to fettle in ,he parilh. The females are the chief alMants in 
cultivating the farms. By the regifter of baptifms and bu- 
rials regularly recorded, the former has exceeded the latter 
one third. Marriages are annually not exceeding 4. The 
farms are Imall and trifling. Services are required from 
the cottert, who, when employed, are always maintained. 
The people are fo her, regular, and indultrious, neat in their 
drefs, and domeftic economy. The farm houfes are moflJy 
built of ftone and clay, and the yard dikes of the fame ma- ' 
terials. 

* Climate, 



of Holme. 



411 



Climate, i^c. — The climate, though moift, being impreg- 
nated with faline particles, is neverthelefs lalubrious, and the 
inhabitants live to a good old age. There are lome now 
living above 90. They are not fubjeft to uncommon chro- 
nic difeafes. The people are employed in manufadui ing 
flax and wool, for their own wearing apparel and for lale, 
to the great emolument of the inhabitants. 

'Trade/men. — There are a fufficient number of artifts, to 
anfwer the demands of the place, viz. weavers, tailors, 
fhoemakers, houfe and fliip carpenters, fmiths and coopers. 
There are none of the medical fraternity, — temperance ren- 
dering their aid unneceffary. 

Shipping and Fijh. — Two veffels belong moftly to the 
parifh, greatly to the advantage of this and the neigh- 
bouring diftrifts. — Although Holme lies contiguous to the 
fea on the S. and S. E. yet the people are but indifferently 
ferved with fifh, owing partly to the inclemency of the 
feafons, and partly to there being no fifliers by trade, living 
in this parifli. Every individual during the fummer and 
harveft months, has a feat or fliare in a fifhing boat, and 
catches filb for his houfe and family, principally ling, cod, 
hollibut, haddocks, whitings, flounders, Ikate, andeniths or 
fole filh, lobfters, partans, crabs, and other inferior fliell fifh. 

Wages and Provijions. — The wages of men fervants, 
engaged by farmers for the year, are, from L. i, 10 s. to 
L. 4 titerling ; women fervants, from 10 s. to 20 s. Ster- 
ling ; day labourers from 6 d. to 8 d. without vi£bials ; arti- 
ficers from I s. to I s. 6 d. — The prices of provifions within 
thefe 30 years, are nearly tripled, though the quality is no- 
thing better. In the year 1762, a good mart cow was pur- 
chafed at 13 s. Sterling, and the whole carcafe did not 

exceed 



412 



Statijlical Account 



exceed i d. the lb. ; and now one of the fame quality 
will fetch L. 2, los. Sterling. Every other article of 
confumptioa is heightened in the fame proportion. 

Church, Heritors, Refit, &amp;c. — St Nicholas church in this ^ 
parifh was rebuilt in 1781. The manfewas built in 1763, 
The glebe, which confifts of 44- acres, was inclofed with a 
ftone dike by the prefent incunibent. It is lituated by the 
Ihore, and every three years produces about fix tons of kelp, 
The ftipend confifts of 86 ?nails m-slt, (each mail weighing • 
about 12 ftones Amfterdam weight), and of 6 barrels . ^ 
greafe butter, which, with the vicarage tithes, including thg : 
glebe, may, communihus annis, amount to L. 70 Sterling. . i 
Sir Thomas Dundas is patron, whofe charitable donations ''i- 
to the Orkney and Zetland Ifles, in their indigency at dif- • 
ferent times, deferves notice, and will leave an abiding im- I 
preflion of his noble, humane, and generous feelings. Capt. in 
Alexander Graeme, of his Majefty's navy, whofe behaviour t 
on the Dogger Bank acquired him the efteem of the public, « 
and his Sovereign's approbation, is almoft fole proprietor. 
The family, for upwards of 100 years, refided at the family n 
feat of Grtemes-Hall, and by their example and encourage- Ie 
ment promoted a fpirit of induftry in the people. From the ■ 01 
family's firft fettlement, to this day, the proprietor has not 
raifed the original rents ; and fome of the anceftors of the i 
prefent tenants have poffefled the fame farm, time immemo- ■ rl 
rial. In general, they are a fober, temperate and active race, ii 
There being no villages in this parifh, the people are lefs i 
corrupted in their morals, than thofe in towns and cities. p 
They are patient, hardy and induftrious, decent in their de- • 
meanour, rational in their religious fentiments, and regular 
in their attendance upon divine ordinances. There are no ■ 
religious feftaries of any denoniination. The valued rent 
pf the parifh is L. 2365 : 12 : xok Scotch. The real rent ig 
iuppofed to be about L. 700 Sterling, bi£hoprick included. 



of Holme, 



p^Q^ There is no other fund for the maintenance of the 

..digent, but what arifes from the colledions, on the Sab- 
bath days, and at facramental occafions, with the dues of 
marriages', mortcloth, and fines, amounting to between L. 3 
id L. 4 Sterling. The lift is feldom under 12. Such of 
;em,"as are able to travel, beg, and the infirm are fupplied 
irom 'this fund, and the charitable donations of the people. 

Mifcellaneous Oh/ervatiom.— There is one corn mill that 
aoes by water, and two by wind. There is no lint mill, al- 
Though it is much wanted. The Honourable Society for im- 
provements, would, doubtlefs, upbn a proper reprefentation, 
advance money for the firft ereaion of one. At prefent, the 
flax is manufaftured with brakes, fwitches, and coarfe hec- 
kles. There are no foxes nor badgers, but fome otters. 

There are no rivers, but fome fmall rills of water run 
into the fea. Oppofite to their junftion are caught delicioiis 
and large fea trout, from one to 8 pounds weight.— There 
are no trees cr fiirubs of any fpecies. There are a few finging 
birds, as larks, linnets and wrens ; and a number of the ra- 
venous kinds, as eagles, hawks, ravens, crows and owls ; and 
fea-fowls of various forts, fuch as are to be met with through- 
out the north of Scotland. No perfon has been criminally 
profecuted or banifhed this pavifli in the annals of time. There 
arefeveralnew improvements made upon the commons, but 
of no confidcrable extent. The proprietor encourages the 
induftry of fettiers, by exading no additional rent during 
their lives. But the turf has been fo long peeled off for com- 
poft in their dunghills, that it is next to impoffible to improve 
the ground, which difcourages their attempts. There arc 
feveral barrows obfervable in the parilh and its environs. 
Some of thefe have been opened and found to contain 
fmall ftone urns, with afhes in them. Nothing elfe remark- 
able has been obferved and difcovered therein.

    PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1235112">KEITH</name>,

<p>Namey Situation, and Extent. 

THE ancient and modern name of this parifh, as far as 
can be afcertained, is the fame. Like all other 
old names in it, it is evidently of Gaelic origin, and derived 
from the word ghaith, which, in that language, fignifies 
■wind, and which, when pronounced by a native Highlan- 
»feT, is not very dillimilar in found from the word Keith. 
This etymology is countenanced by the local fituation of the 
tirk and old village, near which lies an eminence, peculi- 
arly expofed to violent gufts of wind, vulgarly calle Ar- 
ieithj an evident corruption of the Gaelic words Ard- 
Ghaith, pronounced Ard Gui, and lignifying high wind. It 
is. alfo fupporied by the ancient manner of fpelling the 
arame: In fome old charters it is written Gith, which 
&amp;U.iaore re£embles the vfoxdi ghaoth. It is an inland parifh,

9 miles from any fliore. It is fituated about the middle "of 
die county of Banff, in the prefbytery of Strathbo^ie and 
Synod of Murray. It is about 6 miles long, and as manjr 
broad, being nearly circular. Suppofing the church the centre, 
a radius of about 3 miles would almoft defcribe it. It lies 
in the middle of a large ftrath, called Strath-lfla, or Stryla^ 
from the water of Ilia that runs through it ; and contains a 
trafl of as clofe, extenfive, and fertile a field of arable 
ground, as is to be found in any ftrath in the north. 

Soil, Produce, Minerals, lie. — The prevailing foil is 
.oam and clay ; the reft of it is light. It is in general fertile 
in its produflions,' though, on account of its depth and moi- 
fture, it is commonly late in bringing them to maturity. 
For, though the oat feed-time begins generally about the 
end of March, and the barley feed-time about the end of 
April ; harveft feldom commences before the end of Aia- 
guft or beginning of September. At prefent, the parifti is 
entirely deftitute of trees, except a few aflies and elms in 
country gardens ; nor are any of its furrounding hills 
planted, but the hill of Mildary, belonging to Lord Find- 
later, where the planting is in a .thriving way. Its gene- 
ral produce in grain, is "oats, barley and peafe. The firll 
is the prevailing crop ; but what quantity may be raifed, 
or what proportions the different fpecies of grain bear to 
each other, cannot eafily be afcertained. Wheat has beea 
feldom tried, though with one farmer, before 1782, (fincc 
which the feafons have generally been wet, late and cold,) 
it profpered well, for he reaped 12 returns. Almoft e- 
very tenant has annually a plot of ground under flax, 
but feldom above an acre; except one gentleman, fm'vey- 
or for the truftees, who has annually from 16 to 18 acres 
under flax, and feems to be perfedly mafter of its whole 
economy. In general, it is a thriving and proiitable crop,

and feems well adapted to the foil of Keith. Could a rea- 
dy market be found for it, as it comes rough from the 
mills, (of which there are 3 in the pariili), the quantity 
raifed would be inconceivably increafed. The manufadhi- 
rers, wifliing, (as is fuppofed, by thofe who have confidered 
the fubjeft moll attentively), to monopolize the flax trade, 
difcourage the railing flax at home, as much as poflible, by 
ufing none but Dutch flax. The parilh abounds in Hone, 
which, in moft places, may eafily be obtained, only by 
digging a few feet ; though not of an excellent quality, it 
anfwers tolerably well for,.building and inclofures. It has alfo 
plenty of a coarfe gray flate, fit enough for flating houfes. 
Liraeftone is to be had in abundance, on almoft every 
farm, with plenty of peats at a moderate diftance, for con- 
verting it to the purpofes of building or agriculture. Not- 
withftanding that great advantage, agriculture is here juft 
in its infancy ; the long drawling team of 8 or 10 oxen 
in yokes, fometimes preceded by a couple of horfes, is 
yet often to be feen creeping along, dragging after them 
an immenfe log of a clumfy Scotch plough ; when 2, or at 
moft 4 good horfes, or even good oxen in collars, with 
the modern light plough, (which has been found to an- 
fwer well by thofe who have tried it), would perform the 
fame work, equally well, in a much fliorter time. This 
laft mode begins now to take place, particularly about the 
village. The farmers have at laft perceived the advantage 
of a proper rotation of crops, and of cultivating fuch as 
are green, though, for want of inclofures, they can only 
be cultivated in an imperfeft manner. A confiderable 
quantity of the produce of the parifh is exported. Were 
not that the cafe, it is believed, that populous as it is, it 
could maintain its own inhabitants. It has feveral mine- 
ral fprings of the chalybeate kind, fending forth large 
ftreams of pleafant water, which, upon trial, has been

found to be equally light with the Peterhead water. Its 
flrengthening influence on the ftoaiach, and power of increa- 
ftng digeftion, many of the inhabitants have experienced, 
though it has not yet been diftinguiflaed for any very power- 
ful, or particular medicinal virtue. 

Climate and Lifeafes. — The climate, as may be expedted, 
from the fituation and nature of the foil, is moift and cold. 
It is not, however, peculiarly unhealthy, though the inha- 
bitants are by no means careful to guard againft the defedls 
of their fituation ; for their houfes are generally low, and 
confequently very damp in the floors ; nor is there, for the 
moft part, any accefs to the houfes of the lower ranks, but 
over a dunghill, which reaches to the very threfhold ; and 
whofe peftilential fleams, increafing the moifture of the air 
•M their dwellings, muft concur, with the nature of the cli- 
mate, to multiply difeafes, or to increafe their power. A 
regard to their health, independent of cleanlinefs, ought, 
therefore, to excite the mofl: indolent, to remove fuch nui- 
fances to a greater dillance. The difeafes moft frequent 
are, fevers, rheumatifm, toothach, inflammation of tiieeyes, 
coughs, pulmonary confumptions ; and, in fome old people, 
humid afthma, efpecially in the winter and fpring. Acidities 
in the ftomach, flatulency in the bowels, and other fymptoms 
of dyfpepfia, are frequent complaints ; more efpecisUy 
fince potatoes have become fuch a common article of food, 
and chiefly among the lower ranks, who ufe no pepper. 
Thefe two laft years, many more have been afilifted with 
jaundice than formerly, both in this parifh and neighbour- 
hood, and even in the adjacent parts of Murray and Aber- 
deenlhire, but from what caufe is uncertain. Scropbulous 
habits are alfo unhappily too common, particularly among 
fuch as are employed in the linen manafadure. It is com- 
monly obferved, that many more fevers ot the low ner-

vous kind, and greatly fewer of the inflammatory, haVe 
prevailed for the laft 20 years ; and that patients do not 
now bear fuch liberal evacuations by blood-letting, as be- 
fore that period. Wiiether this be not owing to fome par- 
ticular alteration in the feafons, may be a queftion not eafily 
folved. 

proprietors and Rent. — There are 6 proprietors in thepa- 
rifli, the Earls of Findlater and Fife, Stewart of Whitely 
and Achanacy, Stewart of Birkenburn, and Brodie of Le- 
then. The valued rent is L. 5332 : 18 : 4 Scotch. The 
real rent cannot exa£tly be afcertained, as fome of the heri- 
tors have declined giving any information on the fubjecl. 
As nearly as can be conjectured, it is rather above, than 
under L. 3000 Sterling. Within the prefent century, there 
were 14 heritors in the parilh, m oft of them refident. Of 
the 6 exifting heritors, only i is refident, vi%. Mr Stewart 
of Birkenburn. 

Population. — By the return made to Dr Webfter, ia 
1755, it appears thai the population of Keith was as follows: 

Papifts, - - 305 ^ 

In 1783, according to a roll, kid before the heritors and 
gentlemen of the pariQi by ihe minifter, the population was 
3583 fouls: At prefent, (1791) from a very accurate fur- 
vey it appears, that there are only 3057 fouls. 

Of thefe, the number who live in Between 30 &amp; 40, - 476 

villages, is, - 1662 40 &amp; 50. - 422 

In the country, - 1395 5° &amp; 60, - 347

It is, however, to be obferved, that few of the Diffenters 
enter their childrens names in the parilh regifters. The a- 
verage of marriages for the laft 3 years, is 14^- From the 
above ftatement it appears, that fmce 1755, population m 
Keith has increafed upon the whole 374. but fince 1783, it 
has decreafed 5 26. Since the writer of this had the charge 
of the parifti, or for three years back, it has decreafed 90. 
This may eafily be accouuted for, from the ftate of the ma- 
jiufaitureSo 

ManufaBures.—Tht principal branches of manufadlure 
carried on in Keith are flax-dreffing, fpinning, and weaving. 
The two firft of thefe, during the above mentioned period, 
•have been in a very unprofperous condition ; fo much fo, 
that many fiax-dreffers have been difmiffed by their em- 
ployers, and, with their families, have left the place. This 

decline 

• It is obfervable, that the Papifts have Increafed 92 fince the year 1755. 
This increafe is not owing to new converfions, of which very few occur, 
but to the migration of feveralPopini families from the Enzie, where, wHen 
the family of G .rdon. the fuperiors o " that country, were Popilh, tliey 
greatly abound ::d, and where they are ftill very numerous. There are no 
inftances of longevity, except as above. It may, however be oblerved, 
.that there is a couple yet alive, whofe ages together make 171, and who 
have now eaten 64 Chrillmas dinners together, fmce they were man and wife.

decline in the yarn trade arifes fro m three caufes, the pre- 
vailing demand for cotton cloths, which are now afforded 
at a very cheap rate ; the advanced price of Dutch flax 
the only flax uCid by our manufacturers of ya.n, and a ve- 
ry large i portation of linen yarn from Ireland to Glaf. 
gow, the principal mart for Keith yarn. It may alfo be 
added, from their neglecting tu take care, that all the yarn 
manufaftured by them was of good quality, owing to which 
it had fallen nto difreputc ; this laft caufe, however, will fcon 
be removed, as the manufadlurers have refoived to receive 
no yarn from their fpinners, but what is of the very beft 
quality. There are alfo in the parifh, a tannage, a diftillery, 
and, of la e, a bleachfield, very complete in its apparatus, 
which has been ereiSled at a very confiderable expence on 
the banks of the Ifla, and is allowed to equal in execution 
any bleachfield in the North. 

Villages and Markets. — There are 4 villages in the parifii, 
one of old ftandhig, the Kirk-town of Keith, partly feued by 
the predeccffor.- of the family ot Findiater, and partly feued 
by the muiifters, and ilanding on the glebe. This vjllsgq 
is greatly on the decline, and almoll a ruin •, it contains 
192 inhabitants. About the year 1750, the late Lord 
Findiater divided a barren muir, and feued it out in fmall lots, 
according to a regular plan. Hill adhered to ; on which there 
now flands a large, regular, and tolerably thriving village, 
called New Keith, contaming 1075 inhabitants. The feus 
contain 30 feet in front by 70, at a feu-duty of 10 s. per 
annu7n. This village is the refidence of all the manufactu- 
rers of note in the parilh : according to the fuccefs of their 
buiinefs, therefore, it muft either profper or decline. It 
cnjojs the benefit of a well frequented, and plentifully 
fupplied weekly market ; '\. has, therefore, provifions of all 
kinds in plenty, and at a moderate price. It has alfo 4 an- 
nual

which, fome 60 or 70 years ago, was the general mart for 
merchant goods from Aberdeen to Kirkwall ; it is ftill the 
beft frequented market in the north for black cattle and 
-lorfes * Soon after the commencement of the village of 
New Keith, the late Lord Fife bega.i to ereft a village 
on the north fide of the parilh, and then feued out a confi- 

lerable traft of land, called the Neu Town of New Mz//, 
to diftingullh it from another town nigh it, called .V... 
Mill which is alfo his Lordlhip's property, but was never 
feued This New Town contains 330 inhabitants, of 
;vhich there are a very few weavers, who are the only ma- 
nufaaurers ; the reft, excepting 5 or 6 famihes, confift of 
very poor people, who have fixed their abode there, for the 
' conveniency of the land and mofs. The old town, called 
New Mil!, contains 65 inhabitants,

'Tenantry f Servitudes, and Cattle. — The farms in general 
are finall, renting from L. ao to L. 40, which is paid partly 
in vi£lixal, and partly in money, but without any Itated 
proportion. There are a very few farms fiom about L,6o, 
to L. 100 ; only one farm is completely inclofed, and two 
partially. The villagers occupy many parks and acres, 
which are in a rapid ftate of improvement, and which arc 
not yet rented, even when moft contiguous, above L.20 
Sterling per acre. The rent of the farms is very various, 
according to the quality of the foil, and ftate of improve- 
ment ; probably from js. to 15 s. per acre. The farmers 
are exceedingly fober and induftrious, and yet they are far 
from being in a comfortable fituation. There is hardly 
fuch a thing as a farmer, with a family, betttering his cir- 
cumftances -, but many inftances of farmers of fobricty and 
induftry, in fpite of all their care, fpending the capital with 
which they began. The expence of labour is now fo great, 
and the rent of land fo high, that the profits of a fmall 
farm are not fuflicient, with the utmoft frugality, or even 
parfimony, to maintain a family; the holders of fuch farms 
find it exceedingly difficult to fupport credit at all, and 
very often, particularly when the landholders or their fac- 
tors are rigid in exadling their dues, fink to poverty. 
However hurtful it may be to the produftion of a nume- 
rous and healthy population, large farms are increafing, 
and muft increafe, in order to afford their holders a fubfilt- 
ence ; and the tenartts of fmaller poiTeffions will be under 
the necelFity of devoting themfelves to manufactures of

L. 1 i 2 s. befides board and lodging. Now.befidesthefe, menfervants receive 
from L. 4 to L. 6, according to their llrength and capacity ; maids, from 
L. X to L. 1, 5 s. It is difficult to afcertain the expence incurred by a day- 
kbourer and his family. When fuch a family is not extremely numerous, 
and both the man and the wife are fober and induftrious, they generally 
cnjoj the neceflaries of life in plenty.

fome kind or other. To them, if they were better in- 
'^ormed. that (liould not be a difagteeable necefiity •, for, it 
certain that, in moft places of this lOand, tradefmen, if 
loberand induftrious, of aim oft every denomination, can 
live and bring up their families, much more comfortably 
than they can do. Here the tenants are fubjeded to very 
few fervices, and thefe few are feldom exafted. 1 hey are 
bound, however, to carry their farm viftual to whatever 
porr it is to be fliipped at, and to perform kirk and mill 
fervices, as- is ufual in moft pariOies. The multures belong 
to the proprietors of the feveral lands, except in one m- 
ftance ; the fmall eftate of Edlnteve being thirled to a mill 
of Lord Fife's. The heritors, however, think proper to 
oblige their refpeftive tenants to grind at their own mills, 
the multures of which vary ; fometiraes the loth, fome- 
times the i^th part is exaded, which is accounted a great 
bar to improvement. Among thefe tenants, with the vil- 
lage feuers, there are 381 oxen, 523 horfes, 645 cows, 99* 
young cattle, 39 young horfes, and 2240 fheep. 

Language.— In this parifli, and in all the neighbourhood, 
the language fpoken is the Scotch dialeft of the Englifli 
language. All the old names of places are evidently de- 
rived from the Gaelic, which language is generally fpoken 
in a detached corner of the parifti, by a colony from va- 
rious didrias of the Highlands •, who being indigent, and 
fupported by begging, or their own alertnefs, are allured 
there by the abundance of mofs, and the vicinity of a very 
populous and plentiful country. Many inftanccs of the a- 
bove mentioned derivations might be given : for exanple, 
Aultmore, fignifying * the great burn, or brook Alton- 
huy, ' the yellow ifland Bog-bain, * the white mofs 
Achanacyy ' the field in the muir or defert,' &amp;c ; all

•which derivations are evidently confirmed by the local fi. 
tuations, and natural appearances of the feveral places 

Church and Poor*.— The church is a capacious, though 
not very commodious building. At prefent it is in good 
repair, being lately put into that condition, at the expenec 
of feveral hundred pounds. The manfe and offices are in 
a ftate of rapid decay, though repaired fmce the prefent 
minifter's incumbency. The living is L. 88 : 17 : 6 in mo- 
ney, 32 bolls of meal, and about L. 12 of feu-duty and 
rents from the old village. The poor within the parift, 
receiving alms, are extremely numerous, occalioned prin- 
cipally by the great influx of highlanders above mention- 
ed, moft of whom are very indigent ; and during the fum- 
mer months, they range this and the neighbouring parillies, 
and are a great encroachment on what is truly the proper- 
ty of the native poor. For the fupport of thefe, there are no 
mortified or public funds, befides the intereft of the very 
fmall fum of L. 30 Sterling, and the weekly or occafional col- 
leftions, which may amount to about L. 32 annually; which 
fums are almoft entirely devoted to the ufe of fuch poor, 
as are unable to leave their beds or houfes, or make any 
exertion for their fupport at all, which, at prefent, and ge- 
nerally, may be about 30 in number. This flatement evi- •

* The oldeft feffion-records in Keith, bear date only 1686; at which 
time Sir James Strachan of Thornton, was miniller of Keith. In the 
year 1 690, he was deprived of his living for non-conformity to the new 
Government. After his deprivation, for fome time the people of Keith 
were very feldom accommodated with preaching. On that account the 
pjrilhioners and heritors agreed with a Mr Lachlan Rofe, to officiate as 
minifter at Keith. In 1694, fome complaints againll this Rofe were lod- 
ged before the Committee of Aflembly for the north, then fitting at El- 
gin ; which Committee declared Rofe an intruder, and proclaimed the 
"kirk vacant . This vacancy, however, was not fupplied till Mr John 
Chriftie's adiniffion in i "00.

dentlj fliews, that thefe fmall funds are by no means fuffi- 
cient, for the maintenance ot thofe to whom they are de- 
voted. This deficiency, however, is, in general, amply 
made up, either by the generofity of their relations, or by 
the charity and liberality of their neighbours. For it 
ought to be recorded, to the honour of the nhabitants of 
Keith, that in liberality to the poor they are not exceeded, 
it is believed, by any people of their circumftances and I'a- 
tion in Scotland. Befides the above fum, there is annual- 
ly collcaed from L. 5 to L. 6 Sterling, for the benefit of 
the Infirmary of Aberdeen. 

The parifti of Keith has long enjoyed, with lit- 
tle interruption, the benefit of a good fchool, to which, be- 
fore other able fchoolm afters were fo frequent, there was a 
great refort of young lads for the benefit of education. At 
prefent it is in a very profperous ftate, the office of fchool- 
mafter being filled by a gentleman fully capable, and of the 
moft indefatigable application. Befides the ufual falary :.nd 
perquifites, he enjoys annually 300 merks Scotch from a 
mortification, of which a brief account is fubjoined *. 

2 H Eoads, 

* Tn the year 1647, Alexander Ogilvie oi" Edindeach, clerk to the 
Signet, vnortined his lands and mill of Edindeach, " for building and up- 
" holding a fchool-houfe, and maintaining a fchoolinaftcr in the parocinii 
' of Keith," appointing the minifter and elders truftees for the faid mor- 
tification. In the year 1687, the laird of Brace, anceftor to Lord Fife, 
raifed a procefs as lilular of teinds, for abftracted teinds, againft the per- 
fon who was then fchoolmafter ; obtained decreet before the ..ommiflary 
of Murray, and. got the lands adjudged to him for thefe teinds. In confe- 
quence of that adjudication, the laird of Brace, got poffeffion of the mor- 
tified lands, paying annually to the fchoolmafter only L. 68 Scotch. In 
the year 1747, a fchoolmafter of fpirit fuccfeeded, who being affured by 
good counfel, that he had a right to thefe mortified lands, raifed a procefs 
of redu(n;ion of t'.f deed of adjudication. This procefs he maintained for 
ten years before the Court of Seflion. His little funds being then exhauft-

Roach, Bridges, and PoJt-qffice.—The roads are, In gg. 
neral, in very bad repair partly owing to the wetnefs and 
depth of the foil ; partly to the injudicious and imperfed 
mode of repair, and partly to the llatute labour not being 
regularly exaded, by which the roads in this corner were 
originally made, and which is the only means of their fup. 
port. Within thefe few years, Lord Findlater's faclor in 
that diftria, has exerted himfelf in a very laudable manner 
to remedy that defeft; has introduced a more judicious and 
perfed mode of repair, and is more regular and ftrift in ex- 
aaing the ftatute labour ; for which, "though the inhabitants 
in the mean time, murmur a little, he deferves their baft 
thanks; and were his commendable zeal properly feconded, 
by the other heritors and fadors, the complaint of bad roads 
in Keith would foon be no more heard of. The parifli is to- 
lerably fupplied in bridges, moftly new and in good repair. 
In the new village there is a Poll-office, to which the letters 
are brought by runners from Fochabers thrice a week ;— 
an office, which, from its increafing confequence, ought to 
be more liberally fupported and fupplied with runners. It 
ought to have at leaft 6 inftead of 3. Without this increafe 
of runners, it can never properly anfwer the purpoie ; for 
when there is a neceffity of anfwering any letter in courfe 

of 

ed, anJ finding no fupport from feffion, prefbytery, or public funds of

Remarkable Events. — Tradition has recorded only two 
fliirmillies, that have happened in the parifli : One in 1746, 
when about 70 of the Campbells, and 30 of Kinglton's 
horfe, were furprifed by the rebels in the old village, and 
difperfed or taken after confiderable flaughter. The other 
about a century before, when a Peter Roy Macgregor, the 
head of a band of robbers, who infelled that country, was 
taken, and his gang completely difperfed by Gordon of 
Glengerack, then one of the heritors, after a defperate re- 
fiilance. In July 1789, during a violent thunder Itorm, there 
fell a very remarkable lliower of hail, which fortunately ex- 
tended only to a few farms on the fouth fide of the pariih : 
where it fell, it fo completely ruined the crop, that feveral 
fields were plowed down, and thofe, that weie fpared, pro- 
duced nothing worth the expence of cutting. The hail- 
llones were fully the fize of plftol bullets, very irregular in 
their Jhape, ra^oftly angular, bearing the appearance of two 
or three large hail-ftones joined; though the weather was 
exceedingly fultry, and the ground very wet, they were not 
completely diilolved in three days. In the year 1782, there 
was the greateft deficiency in the crop, that has happened, 
at lead fince the years of famine, at the beginning of the cen* 
tury. Had not the noblemen, gentlemen, and principal in- 
habitants exerted themfelves, (which they did in a very 
^ laudable manner,) and procured a very large impcrtatioa

of viflual, thoufands might have perlfhed for want. Verj 
little of the grain was found fit for feed, and by a furNty^ 
made under the infpedion of gentlemen of Ikill, to afcertain 
the real ftatc of the crop, it was found, at an average, to 
be fufficient to fupplj the inhabitants only five montks, 
without refervlng any for feed. In fomc of the latell farms, 
the produce could not fupply the farmer's family, above fix. 
weeks or three months. Ten bolls of oats frequently yield- 
ed no more than one boll of meal, and that too of a quali- 
lity which, in other years, would not have been ufed, but 
deemed only fit for hogs. Notwithftunding fuch dreadful 
fcarcity, not one fingle individual perifhed for want, though- 
many hundreds were on Ihort allowance. 

Manners and CharaEler. — As there are no perfons of in- 
dependent fortune v/ithin the parilli, the inhabitants are di- 
ftinguiniedly fober and induftrious. Several of them have 
thus raifed themfelves to eafy circumftances, which enables 
them to enjoy the comforts of life and of fociety, in the 
greateft perfeftion. Unaccufiomed to the elegancies and 
luxuries of life, or ignorant of them, they feel not their 
want ; they are not difquieted with their defire ; fatisfied 
■with their neat abundance, they enjoy it with iatisfaftion; 
they (hew it with pleafure among their equals, and extend 
it with liberality to fuch as are in want. The taverns are 
now nearly dcferted ; 23 years ago, there was morefpentin 
alehoufes in one month, than is now fpent in 12. All 
ranks are regular in their attendance on the ordinances of 
religion ; maintain, in general, great decorum of behaviour, 
and value themfelves on refpedlability of charafler, which 
excites them, of ccnfequence, to fupport it. Nor are 
they, in any gradation of fociety, notorious lor any parti- 
cular vices. They have no paftimes or holidays, extept ;

dancing on Chriflmas and New Year's day. They are ge- 
nerally lenfible, ihrewd, and intelligent. The tradefmen 
^nd manufaaurers appear more chearful, and feem happier, 
than the farmers and their tenants. This evident difference 
naturally arifes, from the difficulty the latter now find, to 
procure a fubfiftence. For though the generality of the 
tradefmen and manufaaurers live more expenfively, than 
molt of the farmers, feveral of them are, notwithltandrng, 
improving theb drcumilances, while the farmers, with a 
very few exceptions indeed, are doing the reverfe. 

Miscellaneous Ohfervations.—T'aXs parilh cannot boaft of 
having given birth to any eminently diftinguiftied charac- 
ters, if we except the illutlrious Mr James Ferguson, well 
known for his mechanical and philofophical genius and pu. 
blications.— There are no birds or quadrupeds, either fta- 
tionary or migratory, but what are common in this corper 
of the country 5 nor are there any breeds of animals peculiar- 
ly valuable.— There are no curiofities, either natural or ar- 
tificial, in the parilh, worth recording. There are the remains 
of feveral Druidical circles, which are now moftly demolifli- 
ed, for the fake of their ftones. There is one yet very diftina 
on the top of a hill, vulgarly called the Card's hill, proba- 
bly from the Gaelic word carald, which fignifies a friend; 
the true name of the hill may therefore be the hill of friends, 
originating from the brotherly Druids, who worfliipped on 
its top. A little below this circle, there is a very fine foun- 
tain of excellent water, called 'Jaber-chalich, an evident 
corruption of the Gaelic words, Tciber-chalaich, fignifying 
the Old Wife's Well, having been perhaps, of old, frequented 
by fuch perfons, for fome fuppofed fanative power, though 
now fallen into difrepute. Near another of thefe circles, 
there is another well of the fame kind, to which fome per-

loft Its fame. A little below the old village, there is a bea^ 
tiful fall of water, called the Lin of Keith, where the Ifla 
precipitates itfelf over a pretty high rock, forming a very ' 
pleafant cafcade. On the top of the rock, which overhan/s 
this cafcade, ftand the fcanty remains of a once laro-e ruin 
faid to have formerly belonged to a gentleman "of the 
name of Oliphant, who had been one of the Senators of the 
College of Juftice. Tradition gives no particular account 
of this rum ; it does not, however, feem to have been of ■ 
any very great antiquity. </p>

<p>Origin of the Name. 

/^RuDEN, or Crudane, as it is fpelled in old records, 
^ takes its rife from the famous battle, which was 
fought in the beginning of the iith century, between Mal- 
colm II. and Canute, the fon of Sueno, who was after- 
wards King of England, Denmark, Norway, and part 
of Sweden. The armies met about a mile to the weft of 
Slains caftle, the family feat of the Earl of Errol, upon a 
plain in the bottom of the bay of Ardendraught *, near 
which the Danes then had a caftle, the ruins of which are 
Hill to be feen. The Scots had the vidlory. The night 
fucceeding the battle, both parties lay at a fmall dlftance

from each other, and the next day prefented fuch a view 
of the field, as turned their thoughts from war to peace. 
The conditions were foon drawn up and agreed upon *. 

Malcolm and Canute fwore to the obfervation of the ar, 
tides, and faithfully performed their refpeftive obhga- 
tions. Canute, with all his countrymen, left Scotland ; 
and Malcolm not only caufed the dead bodies of the Danes 
to be interred with honour and decency, but alfo com- 
manded a chapel to be built upon the fpot, which, to per- 
petuate the memory of the event, he dedicated to Olaus, 
the tutelar faint or patron, both of Denmark and Nor- 
way f . The village, near which the chapel was built, :

* The tenns concluded on were, 

I. That the Danes and Norwegians fliould withdraw tlieir perfons and 
effedls from Scotland, and witliin a limited time evacuate thofe places 
which they held in Murray and Buchan. i 

1. That during the lives of both Kings, Malcolm (and Sueno, neither 
of the nations fliould attempt any hoftiUty againft the otlier, nor be af- 
fifting to fuch as fliould. ^ 

3. That the field of battle fliould be confecrated, after the rites then w'« 
ufe, and made a cemeteiy, or burying place for the dead. 

4. That in it the Danes, as well as the Scots, fliould be decently ani:s 
honourably interred. 

f No veftige of tliis chapel is now to be feen, but the place is well 
known ; and, as the ground about it is fandy, the bones can be' dug up 
in feveral places. None of the houfes of the village now remain. But 
fome of the hearth ftones, with aflies upon them, were dug up fome time 
ago, in cafliing a ditch for an inclofure. In the prefent church-yard, 
which is about a mile to the weHward of the place, where the old church

■of the battle, the Danifh military cheft was hid near that 
place, but it has never ^et been found. 

Extern, .Situation, Surface and SoiL—Tht parifli is a 
very regular compaa field, extending about 8 or 9 miles 
alona the Britiih Ocean towards the fouth, and about 7 or 
8 miles into the land ' weflward. It is fituated in that di- 
vifion of AberdeenOiire, called Buchan, in the prefbytery 
of Ellon, and Synod of Aberdeen. The foil is various. 
A largj; portion of it is deep rich clay, which, with very 
little exception, extends along the coaft till within a little 
«f the eaftern extremity, which is the only ftrong piece of 
ground in the'parifli.' AH the reft of it, except the moffes 
and a few banks, could eafily be made arable. Tow;^rds 
the W. andvN. the ground in general is light an J gravel- 
ly, or black and mofly. There is very little loam in the 
parilli, but fome excellent fields of yellow foil, upon a clay 
bottom. There is an immenfe quan^ty of peat 'mofs, 
which extends all along the march to ft N. There are 
alfo patches x)f molV in other places.^^nd a pretty large 
portion of the mofs of Loch Lundie, o^^- the iide next to

been much negkaed of late. The whole only employ 8 
boats, with 6 men and a boy to each boat when fully 
manned ; but at prefent, few of them have their full com- 
plement of men, and fome are laid up. It appears very 
probable, that a tolerable harbour could be made out at 
Ward. It is the eaftern boundary of the bay of Arden- 
draught, which extends about two miles along the coaft, 
with a beach of fine fand, and a pretty large field of 
bent at the back of it. If a fmall brook, which paffes a- 
long the S. end of the Earl of Errol's gardens, were in- 
troduced into the fea, at the end of the beach next the 
Ward, there is every re afon to believe, that a very fafc 
landing place could be made for boats or larger veflels, and 
perhaps it might be the means of forming a very valuable 
falmon fifhing, 

Cliimte and Difcafes, is'c. — The climate is various. The 
E. end of the p'arifli is often involved in fog, when there 
is none in the W. And in warm weather, the fog will 
fometimes extend, from a quarter, to a half or even a 
whole mile, over the land, next the ocean, when all the reft 
of the parifh, except a little at the E. end, will be quite 
clear, at leaft from about 8 or 9 o'clock in the morning, to 
3 or 4 in the evening, when the fog becomes general. 
Some parts of the parifli have their crops as early, and others 
as late as any where in the county. Epidemical difeafes 
fometimes prevail, yet the place, upon the whole, cannot 
be faid to be unhealthy. One man died in the end of laft 
year, in the loift year of his age; another a few years 
ago, in the 09th, and feverals above 90. There are fome 
now living above 80, and even 90. Since 1788, epide- 
mical difeafes have prevailed' much, and been terribly fa- 
tal. The malignant fore throat, and putrid fever, fucceed- 
ed one another, and, notwithftanding every warning, were

much fpread, by the imprudence of thofe, «ho went to vi-

namely, that of all thofe, who attended the hu ^ahe * of 
, perfon, who died of the putrid fever, not one efcaped 
catch n. the infeffion. The praffice of tnoculaung for 
mdl-pox is become pretty general, and few hve. are 
loft by that diftemper. Rheumatic and confumpttve com- 
plaints are nAoft prevalent. 

Waters.^T\.^r^ are no rivers, properly fpeaking, in thd 
parifh, but two or three very good ftreams of water One 
of them drives 8 mills. There are two chalybeate fpnngs. 
One at the foot of the rocks at Buller's Buchan, faid to be 
full as ftrong a mineral as that of Peterhead ; the other 
upon the top of the rock befide Dunbuy, over which the 
late Earl of Errol built a houfe. This is a very ftrong 
mineral water, though weaker than that of Peterhead. 

mturalCurioMics, ^c.-Thc Pot of BuUer's Buchan is fo 
well known, that a defcription would be fuperfluous. The 
rock of Dunbuy, to which the migratory birds refort, and 
in which there is one of the moft magnificent arches upoix 
the coaft, is furrounded by the fea, and at no time ran be 
got at, but by a boat. The Bow of Pitwartlachie, a grand 
arch to which the kitty-weaks refort, has a long ravine 
near it, of prodigious height, and very narrow, through 
which the noife of the waves is fo reverberated, as to re- 
femble the found of a multitude of carriages driving fun- 
oufly upon a caufe^way. There are two very grand arches, 
one above the other, at the E. end of the pemnfula of 
Slains caftle. There is another near them, high up on a rock,

form of a round tower, and feeminglj fet upon its bafe 
with a very open joint. A famous antiquary, who few it 
this fummer, is of opinion, that it will not ftand much above 
10 or r2 years longer. Of caves, there are a good number 
but none of them very remarkable. There are the remdifa^ 
of a Druidical temple, upon a rifing ground, about a mile to 
the W. of the church. There is an artificial mount, about 
a mile to the S. of it, called the High Law, and another 
pretty near the Druid's temple, called the Moat, at the 
foot of which a fmall ftone box was plucked omtj i few 
years ago, by the harrows, When dreffing th|§-«|[eld befide 
it. There was "nothing iciv the box, which was compofed 
of feparate pieces of (lone, neatly put together, without 
any cenifent, and placed in the earth. A little to the E. 
of the Moat, is the Gallow Hill, where the graves are ftill 
very diftlnd, and mark the eflias of feudal tyrany. 

Agriculture and ManufaBures. — Hufbandry can only be 
faid to be in its infancy here. There are but few farms 
in good order. The fpirit of farming feems, however, to 
be fpreading abroad, and from the appearances of marl, 
which have lately been difcovered, great espedlations may 
be formed. The crops are barley, bear, oats, peafe slsi^ 
turnips ; with wheat and potatoes, for domeftic ufe. The^ 
incumbent has feen 15 acres in one farm, laid out in tur- 
nips ; and the general run is from about a half, to 7 or S 
acres. There is feldom any fallow, till this year, that the 
Earl of Errol has 20 acres. Much the greater part of 
farm work is done by horfes ; oxen, however, are em- 
ployed in ail the different branches of hufbandry. The 
farms are of all fizes. From 16 or 20 acres, they rife to

Population.-^The number of inhabitants amounts to 
028. In 1778, the number was 212©. But the malig- 
ant diftempers, which have prevailed lince 1788, account 
1 lome meafure for the difference. The return to Dr

ber of communicants of the Eftablifhed Church this year 
was 713, and it is fuppofed, that thofe of the other two, 
do not, between them, exceed 360. The parifh church 
was rebuilt 16 years ago. And, what is rather a fingular 
circumftance, all the outer walls, which are rough afhler 
work, are built out of one Jlone, upon which hallow fires 
formerly ufed to be burnt, and which alfo ferved as a 
land-mark to the fifhers, when at fea, being upon the top ; 
of a gravelly eminence. The Earl of Errol is patron. 
The ftipend is L. 35 : 11 : in money, 48 bolls of meal, 
and 16 bolls of bear ; with a manfe and ofBces, and 6 acres ■ 
of glebe. A procels of augmentation, by defire of the Earl 
of Errol, is going on. His Lordfliip has alfo given orders 
for building a new manfe, as the prefent one is very oldi ^ 
and ruinous. This, to be fure, is rather an uncommon ex- 
ample, but, at the fame time, worthy of the Lord Highh 
Conftable of Scotland, and the fon of a man, who made the 
happinefs of mankind his ftudy ; and who poffeffed that:t 
amiable talent, fo rare to be met with, of fecuring the re- ■ 
gard of all who approached him, and fending them away t 
pleafed with themfelves. The poor's funds confift of) 
L. 130 laid out at intereft, the weekly coUedlions, and the 
penalties. There are about 70 people upon the poor's ■ 
roll. The contributions from the two chapels, for their,; 
fupport, are not confiderable. 

General CharaBer.' — The people are fober and indaftri-: 
ous. Except one fmuggling bulinefs, there has been no c 
trial, before the Court of Jufticiary, of any one belonging 
to the parifli, thefe 14 years. ' Some time ago fmuggling 
was carried on to a great extent, but it is now almoft en- 
tirely given up.

Mifcellaneous Ohfermtions. — ^In 1782 and 1783, the pa- 
rifh fufFered exceedingly by the bad crops, and fome of the 
tenants have hardly yet recovered them. At the fame time, 
In fome places, the meal was very good and wholefome, and 
the parifli, upon the whole, would have been able to have 
fupported itfelf. The crops of late years have been ex- 
ceedingly good. The parifli is a beautiful field, and a noble 
fubjedl for improvement. If the fmall brook, formerly 
mentioned, could be carried into the fea at Ward, and 
% harbour made out, that could receive fmall veflels, which 
might lie in fafety at all feafons, (of which there ap- 
pears the higheft degree of probability,) a flourifliing vil- 
age would be the certain confequence. But if the bottom 
of the brook could be deepened, fo as to receive fuch vef- 
"els as generally trade upon this coaft, then, a very fine 
town would foon be built, and many a veflel faved, which, 
[n time of danger or diftrefs, durft not look at Peterhead, 

and would not be able to reach Aberdeen. Were the 

Earl of Errol to employ a fmall fum annually, in carrying 
brward fuch improvements as the fituation of the parifli 
points out, and refolutely to perfift in feeing them judici- 
oufly executed, he would not only have the glory of im- 
jroving and beautifying a large tra£l of country, but the 
fatisfaftion of being proprietor of one of the finefl: pieces of 
property, in the North of Scotland.

<p>Situation^ Extent, and Surface. 

THE parifh of North-Berwick is Ctuated near the 
mouth of the Frith of Forth, in the preibytery and 
county of Haddington, and in the Synod of Lothian ana 
Tweeddale. It extends along the fea coaft about 3 Eng-^ 
lifti miles, from W. to E. and from N. to S. It has : 
never been exaftly meafured, but may contain fomewhat^ 
more than 4000 acres, the whole of which is arable, ex- 
cepting the hill, called North-Berwick -Law, and about . 
89 acres of links. The grounds in this parifli are, U i 
general, inclofed, and as the utility of inclofures, is uni- 
verfally acknowledged in this part of the country, they 
will probably be entirely fo, in the courfe of a very few

years. The inclofures are either ftone dikes, ditch and 
hedge, or hedges with a fmall Hone dike, two, or two feet 
and a half in height, behind them. This laft mode of in- 
clofing has been only adopted of late, but is much appro- 
ved of. There are many ftripes of planting and clumps of 
trees, not only round the feats of the gentlemen in the 
parilh, but in different quarters of it, which both afford 
much Ihelter, and greatly adorn the face of the country. 

Soil, Cultivation and. Produce.— The foil of this parifli 
is, in general, rich, fertile, and well cultivated, producing 
large crops of all the different grains fown in Scotland, as 
' wheat, barley, oats, peafe and beans. No hemp is raifed, 
and the quantity of flax is iuconfiderable, being only for 
private ufe, Turnips are cultivated, but not to a great 
extent, as the farmers reckon the ground to be in general 
too ftrong and wet for that ufeful plant, and on that ac- 
count commonly prefer fowing wheat upon their fallows. 
Potatoes are raifed in coniiderable quantities, and, during 
the winter, form a principal part of the food of the poorer 
claffes of the people. A large extent of ground is al- 
ways in pafture ; but the quantity cannot be afcertained, 
as the farmers are conftantly employed in plowing up 
feme fields, and fowing others with grafs feeds. A good 
deal^jf red clover is alfo fown annually, for the fupport of 
the forking horfes, as, during fummer, they are generally 
fed in houfes with cut grafs. The four different kinds of 
grain above mentioned, (reckoning peafe and beans as 
one,) are fown in nearly equal quantities. The proportion 
of barley has, of late, been the leaft. Beans were intro- 
.duced here only about 30 years ago, but, where the foil 
will admit of it, are now generally fubftituted inftead of 
peafe. They anfwer equally well, either on itrong clay 
or light loam, but can never be fown with advantage,

either on thin clay, or on light land with a gravelly bot- 
tom. The common method of fowing them is after the 
plough, in every fecond furrow, which fets them in drills, 
feparated from each other at the diftance of about i8 inches. 
The intermediate fpaces are cleaned, either with a fmall 
plough drawn by one horfe, or by hand hoeing, or both 
yrays, which, indeed, is the beft method. Beans, when pro- 
perly managed, yield very large returns, particularly in 
moift and wet feafons. The quantity fown is from 6 to ^ 
firlots or WInchefler bufliels, /)fr Scotch acre. The fpecies 
is the Scotch or Fife bean. When this culture was firft 
introduced, the fmall Englifli horfe bean was frequently 
tried, but is now entirely laid afide, being found by ex- 
perience to run too much to ftraw, and to be too late ia 
ripening for this climate. 

Proprietors, Rent, i^c. — There are 7 heritors in this parifli. 
The three principal proprietors, who polTefs together above 
9 tenths of the whole property, ufually refide in it. One 
farm confifts of more than 400 acres, and a few of lefs than 
100, but by far the greateft number are from 100 to 200 
Scotch acres in extent. The number of farms has neither 
increafed nor diminifhed for many years. 'The rent 
of land is here from 15 s. to L 2. 16 s. per acre. It has been 
gradually increafing for a confiderable time, and on every 
new leafe it ftill continues to rife. 

Population and Trade. — The number of the inhabitants of 
this parifti amounts to about 1300 of all ages, of whom 
above 700 live in the town of North-Berwick. The re- 
turn to Dr Webfter, in 1755, was 1412. North-Berwick 
is a royal burgh of confiderable antiquity ; but its old char- 
ter having been accidently loft or deftroyed, it obtained a 
new one from James VI. No manufadures are at prefent 

carried 



of North-Berwick.

can-ied on in it, to any extent. The only regular trade 
from the harbour confifts in the exportation of grain. — A 
i'mall quantity of kelp is annually made, from the fea weed 
cut from the rocks at low water ; but the driven fea ware 
is made ufe of as a manure. 

Church * aiid Poor.— The ftipend of North-Berwick is 
worth, at an average, about L. ii6 Sterling, and the glebe, 
which confifts of 6 acres, is, from the richnels of the foil, 
of confiderable value. — ^^The poor of this parifli, although 
pretty numerous, are enabled to live comfortably, and none 
of them find it neceffary to beg. They are fupported 
partly by the kirk-feffion, partly by a fund of rather more 
than 20 guineas a year, left fome time ago for their behoof, 
and partly by the liberality of the patron of the parifli. 
I The fum expended annually for their fupport amounts to 
about L. 90 Sterling. 

Tamtallan. — The caftle of Tamtallan, Hands about 2 
miles to the eaft of North-Berwick, on a high rock, over- 
looking the fea, by which it is furrounded on three fides. 
It is encompafled by two ditches, the innef of which ap- 
pears to have been very deep. The entrance to the caftle 
was by a draw-bridge. From the ftyle of its architedlure, 

it 

* At a fmall dillance to the S. W. of the town, there afe the rains of a 
manafteiy. The eminence, on which they ftand, commands a delightful 
profped of the Frith of Forth, the coaft of Fife, and feveral little iflands, 
\vhich lie about a mile or two from the fliore. The mouaftery was founded 
by Duncan, Earl of Fife, who. is fuppofed to have died A. D. 1154. It 
was governed by a prior and priorefs, and poffcfTed a very confiderable pro- 
perty in Fife and Ayrfliire. A fmall ruin, fuppofed to have been a chapel, 
belonging to the monaftery, or to an hofpital, ftands a little to the eaft of 
the harbour. The adjacent ground was probably a burial place of the fa- 
mily of Douglas. In 1788, a feal with the infcription ' SigiUnm WUlielmi 
Domini de Douglas,^ was found in one of the vaults. This Lord Douglas 
Lived about the year 1353.

it feems^ to have been of confiderable antiquity, but the 
precife time, at which it was built, cannot be afcertained 
It was formerly one of the ftrong holds of the family of 
Douglas, and was fold by the Marquis of Douglas to Pre- 
fident Dalrymple. Lindfay of Pitfcottie relates a fiege of 
It by James V. when it held out againft him for a confider- 
able time. It was dellroyed in 1639, by the covenanters, 
the Marquis of Douglas having favoured Charles I. A 
great part of it ftill remains, but is entirely in ruins. 

mi and North-Berwick Law is a very beau- 

tiful conical hill, about half a mile from the fea. Its height 
is rather lefs than 800 feet, but the country round it is fo level, 
that it is feen from a great diftance on every fide.— The Bass 
is a fmall ifland, or rock, within the frith, which lies about 
a mile from the fouth fliore, and is accelTible only by one 
narrow paffage. On the top, there is a fpring of frefli wa- 
ter. It affords excellent pafture for 20 or 30 Iheep, and is 
frequented hj immenfe flocks of fea birds, which continue 
there tlirough the fummer, and cover the fides of it with 
their nefts and young. This rock, and the iflands of ^ilfa 
and St Kilda, are the only places in Scotland, which are fre- 
quented by the folan goofe. It is a bird of paflTaee, and 
continues here from the end of March, till the beginning of 
November. The family of Lauder were formerly pro- 
prietors of the Bafs, and refufed to fell it to feveral of the 
Scotch Kings, who wiflied to purchafe it. Upon the decay 
of that family, it was fold, in 167 1, to Charles H. Du- 
ring the reign of that Prince, and of James II. it was em- 
ployed as a ftate prifon. After the Revolution, a defperate 
banditti got poffelTion of it, and by means of a large boat, 
which they hoifted up and down the rock at pleafure, com! 
mitted feveral robberies on fliorc, and took a number of vef-

for James ; but having at length loft their boat, and not re- 
ceiving their ufual fupply of provifions from France, they 
were obliged to furrender. The ifland was foon after 
given to Prelident Dalrymple, and is ftill in the pofleffion 
of his family *.

    PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1011252">OCHILTREE</name>, 
(county of AYR.) 

4y the Rev. Mr William Thomson.</head> 



<p>Extent, Situation, &amp;c. 

nnHE parlfli of Ochiltree is fituated in the prefbytery o 
J- Ayr, and in that diftrift of the county of Ayr, de- 
nominated Kyle. The church and village of Ochiltree lit 
about 1 1 miles eaftward from the town of Ayr, on th( 
fouth fide of the river Luggar, and on the road that leads 
from that town to Dumfries. The extent of the parifh ii 
about fix miles from north to fouth, and about five miles 
from eaft to weft. The parifli of Stair was formerly in- 
cluded in that of Ochiltree, and many of the lands of Stair 
ftill continue to pay ftipend to the minifter of Ochiltree ; 
but they were disjoined about 300 years ago. 



Rivers. 



of Ochiltree, 



447 



Rivers. — The Luggar, running to the north weft, bounds 
j the parifh for about two miles, and a little farther down 
j forms a conjunftion with the river Ayr. The water of 
I Burnock, rifing on the fouthern extremity of the parifh, 
I runs nearly due north, and joins the Luggar, at the village 
of Ochiltree, and cuts off a ftripe of the parifli of about half 
! a mile broad to the eaftward. The Coyl, running in nearly 
i the fame diredion, touches the parifli of Ochiltree in foine 
I points on the weftward. 

General Appearance. — The face of the parifli is pretty 
level, undulated by gently rifing hillocks, but towards the 
fouth it fwells into higher ridges. There is a thriving 
plantation, belonging to the Countefs Dowager of Glen- 
cairn, which ftretches from eaft to weft, almoft: acrofs the 
parifli, nearly parallel to the Ayr road. And the neigh- 
bouring plantations of Barflcimming, Auchinleck, and Dum- 
fries houfe, afford a fine profpe£t to a great part of the pa- 
rifli of Ochiltree. 

Cultivation, is'c. — The land is moftly employed in til- 
lage, and feeding black cattle, there being only 3 or 4 flieep 
farms upon the higher grounds towards the fouth. The 
farmers chiefly cultivate and depend on an oat crop ; they 
fow alfo a little bear, but no wheat or rye. The land con- 
fifts of a ftrong clay foil, fpouty in fome places, but pro- 
ducing good crops. Black cattle thrive very well, and 
confiderable quantities of butter and cheefe are made for 
fale. 

Minerals. — There is only one fmall coal pit, in the wef- 
tern extremity of the parifli, which produces a kind of coal 
without much fmoke, ufed for drying oats ; but there is a- 
bundance of coal in the neighbouring parilhes of Stair, Cum- 
nock, 



448 



Statijlical Account 



nock, and Auchlnleck. There is no limeftonc in the pa. 
xifh, that can be advantageouflj wrought, but it is brought 
from the neighbouring parifhes. — There is feme marie 
though not of the belt kind. 

Roads. — The parifli might be much more improved, were 
there any roads through it ; but at prefent there is not one 
made road, excepting the turnpike road to Ayr formerly men- 
tioned, and another fmall portion of road, that crolTes a cor- 
ner of the north weft fide of the parifh. It would be much 
for the intereft of the proprietors, to attend to the ftate' of 
the roads, and to the funds allotted for that purpofe, there 
being L. 60 annually colledled, of which L. 20 goes to the 
repair of the toll road to Ayr. The reft is otherwife applied, t 
but unfortunately not to roads within the boundaries of this i 
parifli. I 

Proprietors, Rent, Church, is'c. — The proprietors are tea » 
in number, but Lady Glencairn is poflefled of about three ■ 
fifths of the whole parifli. On her eftate there is an old 
manfion houfe, fituated at the eaft end of the village of 0-: - 
chiltree, which is. the prefent refidence of the minifter, thc'^ 
manfe being entirely in ruins *. The valued rent of the pa-v- 
rifli is L. 5213 Scotch. The veal rent at prefent is about t 
L. 3000 Sterling and upwards. There is a good new church I 
built about three years ago. The prefent incumbent was s 
fettled in April laft. The ftipend, on an average, is aboat t 
L. 95 Sterling. The right of patronage is vefted in the i 
Countefs Dowager of Glencairn. The fchool in the vil- - 

lage ; 

* There is another old rain on the Luggar, a niile to the north weft of : 
Ochiltree, oppofile to the old houfe of Auchinleck, which formerly was  
the feat of the propiietor of the Ochiltree eftate. And there is an old i 
fquare tower, in the foiith part of the parifli, named Auchencloigh. t

viJIage is in a floiirilhing condition. . The falary, however, is 
only L. 8 Sterling. There is alio a private fchool, or two. 

Poor. — There are a great number of poor in the pariih 
About 5,0 receive regular monthly lupplies. The only 
funds are the weekly collections, which amount, on an a- 
verage, to about 12 s. week, belides the extraordinary 
collections on facramental occafioub, which, for fome years 
paft, have been about L. 9 Sterling per annum- \ hefe col- 
lections are chiefly, if not folely, contributed by the com- 
monalty, there being but one fmall heritor refiding in the 
parifh. 

Population. — The number of inhabitants, according to a 
lift taken this year (1792), amounts to 1150. The return 
to Dr Webfter in 1755, was 1210 fouls. The average of 
births for 5 years preceding 1792 is about 37. The ave- 
age of marriages and burials cannot be afcertained, on ac- 
count of the inaccuracy of the parochial regifters There 
are about 220 families in the parifh, and 67 of thefe in the 
village. There are about five to a family, taking country 
and village together, but taking them fepar.iteJy, there are 
fix in the former and four in the latter ; a circumftance 
which ftrongly proves the fuperior healthinefs of a country 
life. There are 30 more females than males. 

Mifcellaiieous Ohfervations. — ^There are about 9 families 
o: Seceders, fome of the Burgher, and fome of the Anti- 
bargher perfuafion. All the reft attend the parifh church, 
and are regular in their attendance, on ordinances. The 
inhabitants in general are remarkable for the fimplicity, in- 
tegrity, and purity of their manners. Except a few fhop- 
-ceepers, mafons, joiners, and weavers, chiefly in the vil- 
lage, they are all farmers, who are not muph in the world,

and for the tnofl: part dwell in folitary houfes, at fome dl- 
ftance from each other. The children of the farmers are 
pretty numerous, four neighbouring farmers having two of 
them 8, and two of them 9 children a-piece. The patron 
on the two laft vacancies which happened, gave the people 
a paftor agreeable to their wiflies ; and what are called the 
New Ltjyht DoBrincs, contrary to our Confeffion of faith, 
though prevalent in other parts of Ayrlhire, have obtained 
very little countenanpe in Ochiltree. </p>

By tie Rev. Mr John Martin.</head> 



<p>Situation and Extent. 

TTHIS pariil^ forms a' part of the prefbytery of Dunbar, 
J- and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. It was an- 
ciently a prebendary of the College church of Dunbar, 
near which town it is fituated. There are three diftrias in 
it, ift, the Lowland diftrift, from Spott to Dunbar ; 2dly, the 
Lam^ermuir Edges, from Spott to the Muir, the grounds 
gradually rifing to a great height, about 700 feet above 
the fea adly, the Muirland Farms, interfefted by a large 
common, called Dunbar Common, faid to be the property 
of .the town, the parifh, or the prefbytery of Dunbar, but 
which is paftured on by the fheep belonging to the contigii- 
ous farmers. 

Agriculture.— In this parifh, agriculture is much in the 
fame fituation as in other parts of Eaft Lothian. In the 
lower parts of the parifh, wheat and beans, or clover re- 
peated, are not uncommon \ in the higher farms, turnips, 

oats. 



402. Statijlical Account 

oats, grafs, l^c. The raulrland farms are chiefly for fhec» 
which are thought of a very good kind, and the farmers' 
here are particularly attentive to this article, fo important 
as a national concern. The quantity of fheep, horfes, cat- 
tle, &amp;c. is very variable, many having different farms in 
this and other pariflies, on w hich they do not refide, and 
their mode of flocking of courfe frequently changing. 

Church, School, and Poor .—The ftipend was augmented 
in 1759 to L. icou Scotch. The visual ftipend being at 
the ordinai-y converfion, the heritors willingly confented 
to the augmentktion, provided the minifter reftrifted hinx- 
felf to that fum. Mr Hay of Spott is patron, and titular of 
the teinds. The church and manfe were repaired In 1790. 
The parifh fchoolmafter has L. 100 Scotch, and the other 
ufual emoluments. The average number of fcholars is a- 
bout 40. The number of poor on the roll amounts to 13. 
They are maintained by the^ntereft of L. 200 Sterling, and 
400 merks Scotch, mortified by Lord Alexander Hay of | 
Spott, along with the weekly colleilions.

Mifcellamous Obfervations — Spott houfe, romantically fi- 
tuated on a rock, in a dean, den, or glen, about a mile long, 
though appearing in a very low fite, has a profpeit of the 
German ocean, Dunbar, the Bafs, Ifle of May, and the 
neighbouring very rich coaft of Eaft Lothian. On each 
fide of the houfe there are rivulets, falling in beautiful caf- 
cades, over rocks, into very deep pools. The banks in many 
places are almoft perpendicular, covered with very tall 
old plane, alh, elm, and beech trees, many of whofe trunks 
and branches are twined about with ivy. There is no fpace 
between the banks, but what the burn occupies, which 
runs into Spott water, or Brock's-burn, and enters the 
German ocean at Broxmouth, a feat of the Duke of Rox- 
burgh near Dunbar. On the banks of all the burns there 
are excellent fprings. St John's well, in the neighbour- 
hood of the village of Spott is the moft remarkable ; it ig 
carried in pipes 2 miles to Dunbar, for the fapply of wa- 
ter to- the inhabitants. Kiftliill well, near Both well, (a feat 
of the Earl B.) v^ns formerly reforted to for fcorbutic com- 
plaints. Spartleton-hill is one of the higheil: in Lammermuir. 
Downhill, about 500 feet above the fea, is remarkable for 
being the place on which General Leflie had his camp, be- 
fore ( what is fometimes called) the Battle ofBmihar, but in 
general over this country, the Battle of Doiviihiil, fought 

on 



45^ Statijlical Account 

on the eaft fide and neighbourhood of the hill, between Oli- 
ver Cromwell, and the Scotch army under LeHie's command. 
From this ftrong entrenchment Leflie was perfuaded, con- 
trary to his own opinion, to come down, — was defeated by 
Cromwell, who was juft about to embark his troops at- 
Dunbar for want' of provifions, and purfued with great 
flaughter. Mulket bullets, fwords, human bones, and pie- 
ces of fcarlet cloth, are ftill found in the neighbouring 
fields 9 many of the killed were buried in and about Spott- 
dean. The Edges of Lammermuir are beautifully fkirted 
with natural wood, the property of Mrs Hamilton of Bel- 
haven, confining chiefly of oak and hazel. There is a range 
of 4 beautiful fmall lochs in her property ; in one of which, 
called the Black Loch, are excellent pike. — The farm of 
Spott, formerly let to three, is now in leafe to one farmer. 
New houfes are intended to be built by Mr Hay of Spot, 
in place of old ones now in ruins, and others are to be re- 
paired. </p>

<p>Origin of the Name. 

THE ancient and modern name of this parifti is Bre- 
chin. Some imagine it to be derived from the 
Gaelic word hraechin, which fignifies fern ; but this 
feems not verj probable, as that plant is by no means a- 
bundant in the parifli. Others, with more probability, 
trace its origin from the Scotch word brae, which fignifies, 
the declivity of a hill, and is indeed very defcriptive of 
the local fituation of the town of Brechin, whence the 
name of the parifti is derived.

belongs to the Synod of Angus and Mearns. The town 
is the ordinary feat of the prefbytery, and lies about 7I 
Englifli miles N. W. from Montrofe. The parifh extendi 
about 5 Scotch, or 7I- Englifli miles, from E. to W. in 
length, and towards the weft fide, is nearly as broad from 
N. to S. It rifes gradually on the north fide of the river 
South Elk, and to a much greater height on the fout^ 
fide. To the weft of the bridge on the fouth fide, there 
is a large plantation of pines, birch and hard wood, which 
decorates the north brow of the hill, fronting the town of 
Brechin, and is a great ornament to the country in gene- 
ral. There is another in the moor of Dubtown, about an 

Englifli mile weft from Brechin, but it lies low. The cli- 

mate is dry, and in general healthy, except in warm and 
calm weather, when .fogs arife from the river. The moft 
prevailing difeafes are fevers, confumptions, and the kind's 
evil. 

Soil, River, Fi/Jj and Minerals. — The greater part of the 
foil is rich and fertile, efpecially on the north fide of the 
river, and contiguous to it on the weft. The river South 
Elk runs through the middle of the parifli, all the way ' 
from the bridge. It produces excellent trouts, and in the \ 
fpring, when the river is fwelled, fome falmon. The high \ 
grounds on both fides of the river, are rocky, but not ex- \ 
tenfive, except where there is wood, and where the high i 
roads run. — There is a deal of freeftone on both fides of 
the South Eflc, efpecially on the fouth fide, to the eaftward ^ 
of the bridge. 

Jhimals. — There are no uncommoa animals in the pa- 
rilh. There are a confiderable number of horfes and black 
cattle, but few flieep, the ground being moftly laid out in 
grain. Cuckoos, lapwings, fwallows, and other birds 
of paflage, vifit the parifli in their feafons.

coft 8 s.per boll at Montrofe, fometimes more, befides the

which is feverely felt by the poor ; but although a redrefe 
of this grievance has been often talked of, nothing has as 
yet been done in the bufinefs. 

Bridge, Antiquities^ l^c. — The bridge of Brechin is fup, 
pofed to be one of the moft ancient ftone bridges in Scot- 
land, but there is no tradition when, or by whom, it was 
built. — The monument in the church-yard is one of the 
moll remarkable pieces of antiquity, perhaps in Britain^ 
It is a circular pillar, hollow within, clofe by the fteeple 
of the church, and confiderably higher ; and, as tradi- 
tion fays, was built by the Pi£ts. It is undoubtedly a 
piece of very ancient architefture. The ftair-cafe within 
it is much decayed, and is now hardly paffable, though, 
within thefe few years, one could have afcended to tl^e 
top of it without danger. The pillar is feen at a confider- 
able diftance from the E. and it is faid to bend like a wil- 
How in high winds, fo as almofl: to touch the fleeple. 

Commerce and ManufaBures. — A confiderable quantity 
of oats and bear is exported by Meffrs Gillies and Com- 
pany, and meal is fometimes imported. Moft of the mer- 
chants deal in the linen and yarn trade, of which great 
quantities are bought and fold every market day. This 
trade gives employment to moft of the women, in this and 
the adjoining parifhes, who all fpin on the two-handed 
wheel, and are well paid for their labour. There was alfo 
a cotton manufafture, which was lately given up, but is 
expected to be refumed foon ; and there is a bleachfield, 
which gives employment to a number of people of both, 
fexes ; befides ftrong ale and porter breweries, which fur- 
nifh the town and neighbourhood with excellent liquor^ 
The fpirited exertions of Mr Colin Gillies have been of 
Sreat benefit to the population and commerce of Brechin.

CharaSier. — The people, in gener^, are aftivc and iiu 
duflrious, honeft in their dealings, and by no means fuper- 
flitious ; but cannot be faid to be altogether free from 
thofe vices, which generally accompany an influx of 
wealth from trade and manufaftures. They are alfo oc- 
cafionally infefted with a fpirit of litigation, and fpend 

confiderable fums at the law, often about mere trifles 

In public fpirit, they are inferior to none. They are, in 
general, of the ordinary ftature, from 5 feet, to 5 feet 9 or 
10 inches ; fome near 6 feet, and there is one man feveral 
inches above it. 

Mifcellaneous Olfervations. — The low grounds on both 
lldes of the river are occafionally overflowed by great in- 
undations. The laft memorable flood happened in the 
year 1774? when the whole bleachfield to the S. E,. of the 
caftle * was overflowed, and the people poffeffing the te- 
nements, which lie along the E. fide of the river, were 
obliged to go up to the higheft apartments of their houfes, 
the under ftories being quite overflowed. There is an 
echo at the caQ:le, and another at the cathedral. — There 
are neither Jews, Negroes, nor Roman Catholics in the 
parifh, but fome of thofe fturdy beggars, called gypfies, 
occafionally vifit it. No perfon has been known to die 
for want. Indeed, there is work enough for all who are 
able and willing to work, and thofe who are not able, are 
provided for. — There have, therefore, been few or no in- 
ftances of emigration •, only a few left the parifh, upon the 
failing of the cotton manufadtory. — None have been ba- 
nilhed for a confiderable time paft. There are very few

Panmure, who refides in it, is commonly called the of Brechin.

uninhabited houfes. — The language ufually fpoken is the 
common Scotch dialeft, but moft of the names of places 
are derived from the Gaelic. — An event often related by 
tradition, but now almoft forgot, which occurred in the 
reign of the unfortunate Queen Mary, deferves to be re- 
corded. On the 5th of July 1572, Sir Adam Gordon of 
Auchindown, who was of the Queen's party, and was be- 
fieging the caftle of Glenbervie, hearing that a party of 
the King's friends were in Brechin, came upon them by 
furprife in the morning, and cut off the whole party. — 
Another battle was fought in this neighbourhood, between 
the Earls of Crawford and Huntly, on the 18th May 
1452, when the former was defeated, and the latter did 
King James II. very effential fervice. This battle is call- 
ed Battle of Brechin, though the fpot, on which it was 
fought, is not in the parifh, but a little to the N. E. of it, 
on the road leading to the North Water Bridge.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q28001576">INVE.RCHAOLAIN</name>, 



(county of argyle.) 

By the Rev. Mr Hugh Mactavish, Minijler.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation and Extent. 

INvERCHAoLAiN is derived from the Craelic language, 
inver, fignifying fit for crop, or inner, (as it is fomc- 
times fpelt), fit for tillage, and caolain, or caolamhain, a 4 
fmall water or rivulet. This etymology of Inverchaolain 
is very defcriptive of the place, being a plain at the foot of 
a rivulet, fit for tillage or cultivation. It is fituated in the | 
diftria of Cowal*, and fliire of Argyll. It is interfeded by 
an arm of the fea, called Lochftreven, which runs about 8 

miles « 

» It has been humoroufly obferved, fince flocks ofjheep have expelled ll 
the droves of COWJ-, which formerly were kept in this part of the country, 
that the diftridt fhould be called Sheep-all, inftead of Cow-fl« ; but the 
word Cowal is derived from the Gaelic, and not from the Englifli.

anlles into the country, the two fides of which, with the 
channel that divides the ifland of Bute from this part of 
Cowal, prefent a fea-coaft in this parifh of above 3 miles. 

Lake, FiJJj, Surface and 5o//. — l och ft re ven abounds 
■with fifti, haddocks, whitings,' fmall cod, flounders, 
feath, and falmon ; and in fome feafons there have been re- 
markable captures of herrings. In the years 1789 and 
1790, the herrings caught in Lochftveven, might be valued 
at L. 3C00 Sterling. The furface of this parifh is for the 
nioft part rugged ; a ridge of mountains rifes with afteep a- 
fcent all along from the coaft. In fome places, there are 
fmall flat fields nigh the fhore, but for the molt part the a- 
fcent from the fea is immediate ; and about half a mile a- 
bove its level, the foil is thin and fandy, more calculated 
for grazing than tiilage. All the mountains, fome years 
ago, were cov ered with heath, but many of them nov/, by 
being paftured vnxh fiieep, aie moflly green, and it is 
likely, (from the rapid change that has already taken place, 
1 in the appearance and value of thel'e mountains, in this and 
the neighbouring paridies), that the heath will foon be en- 
tirely extirpated, and the value of the ground by that 
means confiderably increafed.— It may be proper here to. 
add, that the extirpation of heath, and the produftion of 
grafs in its room, very much depends on a proper f^-ftem 
of burning the heath, which {hould always be done in the 
month of March or April ; and if the ground burnt, is 
kept free from cattle, for 18 months afterwards, the im- 
_provement is very great indeed, many new graflfes fpring- 
ing up, from the enriching quality of the allies of the 
heath, which were never known before. But, if the land 
is too foon paftured on, the grafles are weak and tender, 
and the flieep or cattle pull them up root and all, by which 
the pafture is very materially injured.

ji::iriculUirc,Sh€cp-gva'x.i?ig,'iJc — Though the Innds in this 
.parilh are better calculated for pnflure than tillage, yet the 
few fields along the fca coaft, might he turned to much 
better account. The people, however, are fo prejudiced 
in favour of the ancient mode of farming, that they can 
hardly be perfuaded to adopt any other ; fo that the fame 
bad hnfbandry, that prevailed in this country 40 years ago, 
ftill obtains. Inftead of a rotation of crops, fuitcd to the 
foil, they have, for the mofl part, a fuccelTion of the fame 
crop for two or three years. The crops, principally raifed, 
are oats, bear and potatoes. After the firft break they ge- 
nerally fo'w bear, then two crops of oats fucceflively. 
Sea weed is ufed as manure for oats, and, where the land 
has .reited for two or three years, produces good crops. 
The ground is manured for bear and potatoes, with the 
dung of their black, cattle, houfed in winter ; and though 
there is limeftone in the parifli, the oppreffive duty upon 
coals, and the diftance of every other fuel, make the ex- 
pence of burning lime fo enormous, that the people cannot 
afford to lny it on their land. — The only pcrfon in this pa- 
rifli, who has paid particular attention to farming, is James 
Lament, Efq; of Knockdow, a gentleman of confidera- 
ble landed property, who, under many difadvantage? of 
climate and foil, raifes green crops, equal to any in the 
■well of Scotland, He manures his ground ftrongly, fomg- 
tin^es with lime, and at other times with a mixture of 
lime and earth, cis it fuit.-. his land. His returns of bear 
are frorp 8 to IQ bolls a;i acre; and of oats from 6 to 8. He 
has pracHfed, with fuccefs, what was never known before 
in this country, however frequent in the fcuthern parts of 
Scotland, — the plan of i'ee3ing fheep on turnips in the 
fields. In this manner, the fheep are fattened with httls 
frouble, th^^ land manured, and the neceffity of fuipmer 
fallow precluded. — Ihe farmers, in his immediate neigh- 

bcurhoodj 



of InverchaoJain,

bourhood, are fo fenfible of his fuperior mocle of cultiva- 
tion, that they have, (with great advantage to ihemfelvcs), 
adopted it on a fmall fcale j and it is hoped, in due time, 
his example will have more general influence over all this 
country. — There are 40 ploughs in the parilh. Some 
plow with 2, fome with 3, and fome with 4 horfes.. The 
average produce of oats, on ground cultivated on the old 
plan, is from 3 to 4 bolls per acre \ of bear from 4 to 5.— 
The prices of all our produdlions, are regulated by the 
Greenock market. The produce in grain being Ikorr of 
the confumpiion, an annual importation, of about 400 bolls 
of oat-meal, is necefiary. Some poultry, butter and cheefe 
are exported. 

Sheep. — ^Our mountains, which were of old paftured 
vvith black cattle and horfes, are now covered with ftieep, 
which has not only made a pleafant change on the furface, 
iaut has alfo encreafed the rents confiderably, and enables 
the graziefs to live better, and make money. There may 
be about 14,000 fheep in the parifli ; the Crawford muir 
black-faced (beep, are the kind that are thought to fuit 
beft but many of the graziers here, are liberal minded 
gentlemen, fond of making experiments, and of im- 
proving their breed of flieep. Some of the Cheviot, or 
long-faced white flieep, have lately been brought to this 
parifh. Some of them are pallmed in our mountains, and 
others on our low ground. Thofe on the mountains feem 
to thrive equally Avell with thofe in the lovv lands, which 
its a proof of their hardinefs . and fitnefs for the climate. 
The prices of ftieep and wool have encreafed of late 
three year- old wedders are fold at from 10 s. to 14s.; 
ewes, (commonly called old or draught ewes), from 6 s, 
to 8 s. ; lambs, from 3 s. to 5 s. ; wool laid with tar, from 
5 s. to 6 s. a ftone, (Trone v/eight, 24 EngliHi ounces to

the pound) ; white, from 7 s. to 8 s. The Society for frsr- 
tending Filheries ar\d Improvements, have been the means 
of improving the fheep of this comitry confiderably, by 
the premiums, which they have been 'm the ufe of giving, 
of L. 14 Sterling, to the perfon who grazed the three bcflr 
parcels of tups, 6 to each parcel. — This has raifed an e- 
mulation among the graziers 5 and as the flock of the per- 
fon, who gets the premiums, is efleemed the beft, he con- 
fequently obtains a liigher price for his ftxeep, in addition 
to his premium. The judges, appointed to determine the 
qualities of the raps, prefented for a competition, are at a 
lofs, whether to give it in favour of thofe whofe wool h 
of the beft quality, or in favour of the ftrongefl. and beft 
made rams, not Icnowing which of thefe points the Society 
have principally in view ; but they generally determine, 
in favour of thofe of the greateft ftrength and beauty, in 
preference to thofe who have a greater quantity of wool, 
or of fuperiority in quality, but an inferior fliape or carcafe. 
Befides the braxy, (a difeafe common to llieep of the firft 
year, or hogs, as they are commonly called), by which 
nearly a fourth are cut off, there is another difeafe fatal 
to fheep of all ages, during the fummer months, called the 
Jlurdy, or dizzlneis in the head. The f^iuptoms of this dif- 
eafe are watery tumours in the fore or back part of the 
head ; and the only cure, that has been tried, is cutting a- 
way thefe tumours, by wJiich fometimes the animal's life 
is preferved ; though many die immediately after the o- 
peration is performed. The caufe of this difeafe has never 
been afcertained, nor any preventative difcovered. 

Black Cattle and Horfes. — The rage for ftieep flocks has 
banifhed the prailice of rearing many black cattle ; though 
fome judicious farmers think, a few on the hills, in fum- 
mer, along with tlie flieep, would pafture on thofe graftes 

which 



of Inverchaolain, 



469 



^hich the flieep do not like, and which are otherwife en- 
firely lod. There may be about 400 cattle in the pa- 
rifli, and 140 horfes. Aged black cattle are fold at from 
L. 4 to L. J Sterling ; horfes, from L. 10 to L. 12. 

Antiquities. — At the S. E. extremity of this parifh, upon 
ja farm called Ardein, there Hands an artificial hill, on which 
jthe ancient judges of the country held their courts, and ad- 
inillered juftice. On a dry heath, near the fliore of the 
me farm, and alfo at Achavuillin in that neighbourhood, 
re are many veftiges of graves, fome marked by cairns 
ftones, others by a lingie ftone at each grave. A few of 
hem were opened, and found to contain human bones. — It 
probable, that all thefe, either buried under the cairns, or 
hofe graves are marked, by the more fimple monument of 
fingle ftone at each grave, were men either of rank and fi- 
e, or who had diftinguiflied themfelves by their warlike 
ploits; and that thefe monuments were meant to point out, 
hat the bodies of people of eminence were depofited under 
hem. — About the year 1226, Olave, King of the Ides, in- 
aded Bute, and having befieged the caftle of Rothefay, he 
ook it, with the lofs of nearly 300 of his men. Four of 
is ftiips were driven from their anchors by a ftorm, and all 
the people on board peri/hed. It is fuppofed, that the graves 
ilang the Ardein and Achavuillin coaft, (being oppofite 
: J the bay of Rothefay), are the dormitories of thofe deadbo- 
diss, v/ho were driven upon that Ihore, after the lofs "of 
c'lv fliips. By tradition we are told, that Ardein was 
iihe fcene of a very bloody conflidt, which took place be- 
veen the people of that neighbourhood, and a party of 
young courtiers, who attended the palace of Roh-^rt III. at 
'othefay. The gallant courtiers, coming on a ' anting ex- 
rfion to this part of the country, were fo en" loured with 
- c charms of the young women they met with, that they

males of the diftrift, drove thefe intruders to the fhore y 
where, an engagement taking place, many of them attoned 
for their gallantry with their blood *. 

Climate and Difeafes. — Being furrounded with hills, whof© 
tops intercept the clouds, we have great and frequent falls 
of rain. This, and not fowing our oats, before the middle 
of April, make the harveft late, and our crops are, confe- 
quently, much hurt by the equinoftial rains and winds; 
Though the air is rather moift, there are many inftances of 
longevity ■■, there are two men now living, in the parifh, a^ \ 
bove 90 years of age. A man died lately that was faid to' 
be 100, and there are feveral between 70 and 80. Th^

".eluding the glebe, fcommum'bus anm's J, to L. no Ster- 
ng, yearly. The inhabitants are of the Eftabliftied 
imrch, excepting two Seceders. The manfe was built 
i the year 1736, with offices of ftone and lime, and 
plated in the 1791 ; and the church in the year 1745. The 
-nanfe is in very good repair, and the church is in as 
Qod order, as mod country churches. — The poor are fup- 
norted by the colleftions at the church upon Sundays ; the 
mtereft of a fund faved out of former colledions ; the dues 
^ of marriages and chriftenings, and fines exaded from delin- 
-iients. There is an eftabliftied fchoolmafter, with a falary 
L. 7 Sterling, befides a fmall allowance, as precentor and 
!'-]Tion-clerk. — He profefles teaching of Englifti, Arithmetic, 
..nd Book-keeping. The number, who attend liim, are a- 
nt 12 in fummer, and 20 in winter. In the fummer 
ionths, many of them are employed in herdincr, as fome 
of their parents cannot aftbrd to hire people ; befides, if 
r leir children can read Englifti, write, and underftand a lit- 
tle of arithmetic, they think them fufficientJy well edu- 
cated. 

Farmer Society.— A fociety has been lately eftabliflied 
n this, and the neighbouring parifti of Dunoon, called the

Farmer Society, which, it is hoped, will in time fuperfede 
the neceffity of making any piovifion for the poor £, " 
very member, at his admiffion, has the option either to 
pay L. I, I s. Sterling, and be exempted from any future 
payment, or 6 s. at entry, and i s. yearly. This money 
is lent upon proper fecurity \ and when it amounts to 
L. 100 Sterling, the inrtereft is to be applied to the relief 
of the indigent, and the widows and children of the mein». 
bers ; and, if there are nxine of this defcription, to any o» 
ther neceffitous perfons in the parifhes in which the mem- / 
bers refide. The office-bearers and managers are appoint- ' 
ed yearly, to take charge of the bufinefs. This fociety ig ' 
only as yet in its infancy, but many of the gentlemen of . 
the country, fenfible of its being founded upon good prin- ' 
ciples, have joined them •, and, it is hoped, it will foon be 
put upon fuch a footings as to afford an ample provifio^ a j 
for the poor, and preclude the neceffity of poor's rates, 
which have been much and juftly complained of, as preju, 
dicial to induftry and virtue. ' i 

Population. — The return made to Dr Webfter of the 
population of this parllh, in the year 1755, was 944 fouls, 
From the regifter of baptifms, of that and later dates, 
there is evidently a confiderable decreafe. This has bee:i 
owing to a pradice, that has become general for feme 
years paft, of letting large trails of ground, to one or two 
individuals for ffieep-grazing, which were formerly occur 
pied by 8 or 10 diiFerent tenants. The landholders found 
it their advantage to let their lands in this manner, as one 
or two people, who had money to ftock the land with 
fheep, and underftood how to manage them, could afford 
to pay a higher rent, than many of the former pofleflbrs, 
who neither underftood grazing nor tillage, and could 
hardly, by their poor unfldlled efforts, gain a miferable 

fubfiftence, 



of Lwerchaolaiti. 473 



mbUftence for themfelves and families. Happily for them, 
they were moftly removed to the neighbouring towns, 
where they found fufficient employment, and where many 
of their children, by the advantages of education, (which 
they could not enjoy in their own country), have raifed 
themfelves to independence, become ufeful members of the 
community, and a fupport and comfort to their parents in 
their old age. The number of families, at prefent, is 83, 
of fouls, 504. The annual average of marriages is 4, and 
of births, 12. There is no regifter of burials kept. 

Proprietors and Rent. — Seven heritors have property in 
this parifli, one of whom, (Mr Campbell of South-hall), 
has nearly the one half. Not influenced by the general 
tafte for dillipation and extravagance, fo prevalent among 
moft young men of fortune, he paffes the greateft part of 
his time upon his own eftate, ornamenting his delightful 
place of refidence, which commands a beautiful profpe6l of 
the Frith of Clyde, ifland of Bute, and village of Largs, 
with that much admired place belonging to Lord Glaf- 
gow, called Kelburn. He, and Mr Lamont of Knock- 
dow, are the only refiding heritors. The valued rent of 
the parifli is L. 204 : 8 : 5 Sterling, and the real rent may 
be about L. 1500 Sterling. 

Mifcellaneous Ohfirvations. — Natural woods, fuch as oak, 
afli, hazle, birch, &amp;c. are a confiderable article of fale. They 
are cut down at 20 years old. The only planting is about 
Mr Campbell of South-hall's manfion houfe, and Mr La- 
mont of Knockdow's. There are groufe in the hills, and 
black cocks in the woods, a few partridges in the low 
grounds, and 'plenty of hares. The manners of the peo- 
ple, drefs, prices of labour, and language, are the fame 
with thofe of the neighbouring parifhes, which have been 
already communicated to the public.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1002133">DUNBAR</name>, 



(county of HADDINGTON.) 



By the Rev. Mr George Bruce.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, Surface and ProfpeB. 

TH E parifh takes its name from the town ; and the 
name of the town, Dunbar, or Barodunum accord- 
ing to Buchanan, is probably derived from fome eminent 
hero of antiquity of the name of Bar, whofe place of refi- 
dence it was. — It is fituated in the county of Haddington, 
in the provincial Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale, and is 
the feat of the prefbytery of Dunbar. It is about 9 miles 
in length along the coaft, from E. to W. and, at a medi- 
um, nearly 2 miles in breadth.— The face of the country 
is pleafant, rifing gradually and moderately, for the moft 
|)art, from a loiv coaft. It forms a very agreeable land- 
fcape, the back ground of which, in ever^ direftion, ex- 
hibits a variety of ftriklng objefts. Eaftward is St Ebb's 
Head, with a bold and high coaft to the S. the rifing 
hills on the fkirts of Lammermuir, and the high grounds 



of Dujihar. 



475 



of Whlttingham; — weftward, are Dumbender Law, Garle- 
ton Hills, and North-Berwick Law •, and on the N. the 
Bafs, the Ifle of May, the Frith of Forth, the coaft of Fife, 
and the lofty mountains of Angus. 

Soil.—Tht foil is rich, and the parifli of Dunbar is per- 
haps the moft fertile fpot in Eaft Lothian, which is the 
mod fruitful province in North Britain. It is partly a 
rich loam, partly clay, and partly a light mould. It is 
well cultivated, and produces great crops^ chiefly Wheat, 
barley and beans, but little oats, and lefs rye. Rich crops 
of broad clover and rye-grafs are raifed, and the land an- 
fwers well for turnips and potatoes. Sea-ware is much 
ufed for manure, and with good fuccefs. Limeftone is 
got in the E. end of the pariih, and there are draw kilns 
for burning lime, which is ufed by the farmers, and fold 
to thofe in the neighbourhood. The fields are inclofed, 
fome with ftone walls, fome with thorn hedges •, and fome 
of them are ftill open. The greater part of the land is 
dry, and the feafons are early. 

Rent, Proprietors, tifc— The land is, in general, high 
rented. The burgh acres give from L. 4 Sterling to a- 
bove five guineas the Englilh acre, and confiderable farms 
from 30 s. to two guineas. The land is divided among 
7 great heritors, (of whom 3 refide in the parifh,) and about 
the fame number of very fmall ones. There are 30 great 
farmers, who pay of rent from L. 60 to L. 600 Sterling. 
They are generally opulent and refpeftabl'e. There are 
7 or 8 fmall ones. There is one grazier, who deals to a 
confiderable extent, in breeding and feeding for the but- 
cher market. A good many cattle are ftall-fed, atjd fheep 
are fattened with turnips. The valued rent of the parifli 
is L. 16,953 Scotch, and the real rent about L, 8coo Ster- 
ling.

ling. The Duke of Roxburgh has a fmall houfe at ^ror^ 
mouth, pleafantly fituated. Sir Peter Warrander ha^ 
Lochend. Nineware belongs to Mr Hamilton of Bangour 
and Belton to Mr Hay. Mr Anderfon has a fmall houfe 
beautifully fituated at Winterfield, from the fummer houfe 
of which there is a delightful profped, very extenfive 
and much diverfified. The Earl of Lauderdale has built 
a very elegant houfe at the W. end of Dunbar. 

Villages, Rivers, Mills, &amp;c — There are five villages in 
the parilh, m%. Belhaven, within the royalty, Weft Barns, 
Hedderwick, Eaft Barns, and Pinkerton. — There are two 
rivers ; both have their fource in Lammermuir hills. The 
largeft of thefe is the Tyne, which, after a pretty long 
courfe, empties itfelf into the Frith of Forth at Tyn- 
inghame. There the tide flows about two miles, and has de- 
ftroyed on both fides of the river feveral acres of good land, 
which Dutch IkiU and induftry would have preferved. 
The other river is the Biel, which runs by Whittinghame, 
the Bield, Belton, and Weft Barns, and empties itfelf into 
the Frith at Bielmouth. On this river, at the village of 
Weft Barns, a cotton and flax mill is juft now begun to be e- 
refted, from which we have great expectations. The cot- 
ton manufacture is at prefent one of the moft flourifliing 
and ufeful branches of commerce in Britain. It employs a 
number of hands, and efpecially young people. This mill 
is a new thing in this county, and, if it fucceeds, will be a 
great blefting to this corner. It is generally efteemed a pa- 
triotic attempt, and has the good wiflies of every perfon of 
public fpirit.— At Weft Barns, there are flour mills of the 
beft fort, where a confiderable quantity of wheat and bar- 
ley is manufadlured. There are three other corn mills in 
the parifli.. To thefe mills, the town and fome eftates in 
the country are thirled ; a wretched piece of police ! 

Thirlage 



of Dunbar, 



477 



Thirlage to a mill, and all kinds of feudal fervitude to the 
landlord, are extremely inconvenient to the farmer, and ho- 
ftile to all improvements. Indeed, thefe Gothic cuftoms 
are juftly falling into difufe among the fenfible part of the 
gentlemen in Scotland. 

Population. — Bj an accurate furvey, in the prefent year, 
(1792), it appears, that there are 3700 inhabitants in the 
parilh, of all ages. The return to Dr Webfter, in 1755, a- 
mounting only to 3281, there is cojifequently an increafe of 
419 fouls. The following is an abftraft from the fefiion rc- 
gifter, of births, marriages, and burials for the laft 10 years :

This account is pretty accurate, in refpeft of marriages 
and burials, but is confiderably deficient in regard to births, 
as many negled to get the names of their children entered 
in the public regifter. If any regulation could be made to 
fupply this defed, and to enable the felTion-clerk to keep 
the parifti regifter exad, and to oblige him to give in annu- 
aUy to fome public ofKce, a true lift, figned alfo by the mi- 
nifter, of aU the births, marriages, and burials, which have 
happened in the parifli for that year ; it would afcertain 
the population of every particular parifti, as well as of 
Scotland in general ; and might anfwer many valuable na- 
ional purpofes. 

Burgh. 



478 



Statijlical Account 



Burgh. — ^Dunbar is a royal burgh, erefted- by a chartet 
from King David H. about the middle of the 14th century. 
It is centrically fituated between Edinburgh and Berwick.- 
upon Tweed, being 27 miles diftant from each. It ftanda 
on a moderate eminence, and a dry bottom. The princi- 
pal ftreet is broad and well aired, and the houfes are much 
improved of late, and make a very genteel appearance. 
There are in the town, two large inns for the accommoda. 
tion of travellers. At fome diftance, among the rocks, 
there is a retired place for fea-bathing, with a room to un- . 
drefs. The town is remarkably healthy, as is the parilh 
in general. There are many inftances of longevity, of per- 
fons who have arrived to the age of 80 or 90 years, and 
upwards. It is expofed to cold and lharp winds, from the 
eaft and north, chiefly in fpring. The town of Dunbar 
is fupplied with plenty of good foft water, conveyed in 
leaden pipes from the diftance of above two miles. This 
was done in 1766, at a confiderable expence ; and the me- 
rit of this great benefit is due to the public fpirit of the ma* ,■ 
giftrates, who were then in office, and in which they were ; 
aflifted by the liberal contributions of the inhabitants On  
that occafion the ftreets were new paved. In 1758, a piece 
of ground was allotted for a wafliing green, and inclofed 
with a hedge, and a drying houfe ereded on it. — The go- ,• 
vernment of Dunbar is by a Provoft, three Bailies, a Trea- •- 
furer, and 15 Councillors. The revenue, axnounts to aboW : 
L. 500 Sterling a-year. Dunbar, with Haddington, North i 
Berwick, Jedburgh, and Lauder, fend one member to Par- - 
liament. The ufual unhappy effefts of borough-jobbing ; 
at eleaions, are, intemperance, political enmity, and negleft I 
of bufinefs. Though Dunbar has not been quite exempted ,i 

from thefe evils, it has fuffered as little, in this refpefl, per- -

haps, as any royal burgh in Scotland. If our members for 
burghs would exert themfelves to advance, not only the 
public good of the nation, but alfo fome material concern 
jf the towns, which they reprefent, they would found an 
intereft on real merit, which would be more folid, as well as 
more honourable, than that which is founded on eleftion 
dinners, expenfive entertainments, and drunkennefs. Thefe 
ferve only to debauch the morals of the inhabitants, and to 
hurt the families of thofe very perfons, whofe friendfliip they 
wifh to fecure. There are in 1) unbar, no fewer than 46 
licenfed alehoufes, where low-priced fpirits are retailed, and, 
\vhere the execrable cuftom of dram- drinking is praftifed. 
This we may juftly pronounce to be the bane of all good, 
and the fource of all ill ; the ruin of health and morals, 
and of all domeftic duty and comfort 5 the reproach of man, 
and the difgrace of woman. 

Harbour and Shipping. — The harbour was originally at 
Belhaven. The eaft pier of the prefent harbour was be- 
gun in the time of Cromwell's proteftorftiip, to the expence 
of which Oliver granted L. 300, as appears by a letter of 
General Monk from Dalkeith. For a long time after that 
period, the harbour continued very imperfed:, capable of 
containing only a few fmall veflels. Early in the prefent 
century, it was enlarged and deepened, by digging into the 
folid rock, 8 feet deep at an average ; and at the fame 
time very commodious quays were built. This was a 
work of incredible labour and expence, and reflefts no 
fmall honour on thofe who had the management of public 
affairs at that time. In reality it was the moil capital im- 
provement of the place, and the very making of the town, 
and its trade. The harbour, though very fafe, is ftill but 
fmall, and of difficult accefs. There was lately a new 

pier 



48o 



Statijlical Account 



pier built on the rock, that forms the weft fide of the en- 
try, to the expence of which the Convention of Royal 
Burghs gave L. 600 Sterling. The harbour is defended by 
a battery mounting twelve guns, 9, la, and 18 pounders. 
Very lately a large and convenient dry dock was built.

33 — employed in the coafting trade, 
67 — in foreign trade, 
50 — in the- whale-fifliing trade. 

Fijheries. — Thei-e are 12 fiftiing boats for white fifti and 
lobfters, which employ about 40 men. There is a cuftora- 
houfe, in which there are a coUedlor and comptroller, a land 
furveyor, a tide furveyor, 4 tide-waiters, and a cuftom- 
hoiife boat, with 7 men belonging to it. — The Ihips belong- 
ing to the Eaft Lothian and Merfe fifbing Company, are. 
ftationed at Dunbar. They were once 5 in number, but 
are now reduced to 2. This Company was eftabliflied in 
1752, and has continued with various fuccefs. It is the 
oldeft of the kind in Britain, and, upon the whole, has 
been the moft fuccefsful. — The herring filhery was former- 
ly more confiderable and regular. It is of great benefit to 
the town, and to all the country round ; but, for feveral 
years paft, it has become very precarious and uncertain. 

Trade and ManvfaBures. — The corn trade is the 
moft confiderable branch. It is fold, chiefly by famples, 
in the weekly market, which is held every Thurfday.

Split peafe and beans, 23 tons ; hulled barley 118 tons. 
About 8000 bolls of barley are malted yearly. Dunbar 
malt is famous for its quality, being remarkably well made. 
Above 6000 tons of coals, are landed annually at Dunbar. 
The price of coals is between 5 s. 6 d. and 6 s. 6 d. 
per boll, which weighs iiicwt. — There is a very fine 
ropery at Dunbar, where there are employed from 20 to 
30 men ; and another new one at Weft Barns. The cord- 
age manufaftured is above 100 tons annually. — Kelp, in a 
fmall quantity, is made on the coaft. — Soap and ftarch are 
manufaftured in the town and neighbourhood. 

Church. — The fabric of the church is very old, and the 
form of it is very bad for an auditory. It is built exadlly 
in the form of a crofe. The body of it is 100 feet long, 
and it is only 24 feet wide within the walls. It was found- 
ed anno 1392, by George Earl of March, for a Dean, an 
Archprieft, and 8 Prebendaries. Thefe were named from 
their feveral refpeftive prebends, or benefices ; 'uix„ Dun- 
bar, Pinkerton, Belton, Spot, Pitcox, Linton, Dunfe, and 
Chirnfide. The patronage fell to the Crown, by the for- 
feiture of the Earl of March. The Duke of Roxburgh is

Statijlical Account 



the prefent patron, and is titular of the tithes, which arc 
very confiderable in this parifh. — The church, till lately, 
Was, in the infide efpeclally, one of the. worft, and moft in- 
convenient, perhaps in Scotland. The floor was funk be- 
low the ground without, which made it always danip and 
cqjd. It was repaired by the heritors in 1779, floored 
with deal, and ceiled in the roof. A part of the long bo- 
dy was cut off, by a partition, as ufelefs, and it was regu- 
larly feated ; fo that it now looks clean and neat, the 
quire only remaining unaltered. — There were two mona- 
lleries in the parirti, both founded b}' Patrick Earl of 
March : One of Red Friars, in 1218, the other of White Fri- 
ars, in 1^63.— The living at prefent confifts of 23 bolls 
wheat, 65 bolls barley, 23 bolls oats, and 7 bolls peafe, 
with L. 34 Sterling. A decreet of mere locality, without 
any augmentation, was obtained in abfence of the minifter 
in the year 1767. There is a very good manfe, which 
was built in 1776. The glebe confifts of 5 Englifli acres. 
There is no grafs. — There are two Seceding Societies in the 
parifli ; a Burgher meeting in Dunbar, and an Antiburgher 
one in Eaft Barns. Their congregations are made up of a 
colleftion of people from all the pariflies in the neighbour- 
hood. 

Schools.- — There are 3 fchools in Dunbar, a grammar 
fchool, a mathematical and an Englifli one. The mafters 
of thefe fchools have each a houfe and genteel falary. 
They are chofen and paid by the town. This parifli 
never had a parochial fchool till 1790, w'hen one was 
fettled by the heritors, (with a falary of L. 8 : 6 : 8 
Sterling,) at Weft Barns, where it was much wanted, 
to accommodate the inhabitants of the weft end of the 
parlfli, which is populous, containing about 800 inhabi- 
tants. There is a private fchool in Eaft Barns with a 

falary, 



of Dunhaf'. 



483 



faliry, being the intereft of L. 100 Sterling, mortified 
for that purpofe by Mr William Hume, late farmer ia 
that village. To this fchoolmafter the family of Spot 
gives a houfe and garden gratis. The importance of a 
parochial fchool feems not fufficiently attended to. The 
moral principles, and future ufefulnefs, of the lower clafe of 
people, depend very much upon thdr early education. This 
was the fenfe of the Legiflature, when the law eftabliflied 
a fchool, with a legal falary, in every parifti in Scotland. 
Notwit^ftanding which, it is but too evident, that thefchool- 
toailer, however valuable a member of fociety he may be, 
is often neglefted, and ill ufed. How diflionourable to 
grudge and withhold from fo ufeful an officer, the fmall 
pittance which the law has affigned, as the wages of fevere 
labour and attendance ! How unjufl, when it is confidered, 
that the fchool mailer's falary is no part of the heritor's 
property ; for when an eftate is purchafed, that falary is 
deducted from the rental. The heritor, in that cafe, is only 
a truftee, and when he refufes or declines to pay his 
proportion, he keeps money in his pocket, which does 
not in fa6l belong to him, but to another. 

Poor. — The number of poor is very great, as is the cafe 
in all country towns, efpecially fuch as are fea-ports. The 
frequent misfortunes, happening to feafaring people, often 
throw whole families of helplefs children on the charitable 
funds. This indeed affords an opportunity of Ihowing 
Chriftian benevolence, and the true Chrlflian will readily 
embrace all fuch opportunities. To rear up orphans, defti- 
tute of friends, and to make them ufeful members of foci- 
ety, — to feed the hungry, and clothe the naked,— to fnpport 
the aged, and relieve the diftreffes of the widow, will gra- 
tify the feelings of humanity, aad, at the fame time, ful- 
fil 



484 



Stntijlical Account 



fil the duties of that religion which we all profefe. Tlie 
provifion for the poor is an annual afTelTment, by die he- 
ritors, according to their valued rents, in a joint meeting 
with the minifter and elders. — The town pays a fixth part 
of this affeffment ; the remainder is paid, one half by the 
heritors, and the other half by their tenants. To this are 
added, the weekly colledlions at the church, and the pro- 
fits arifing from the mortcloths and a hearfe. There is 
alfo the intereft of a fmall mortification of L. 83 : 6 : 8 
Sterling. All thefe fums are intrufted to the minifter and 
kirk-feffion, as the fitteft perfons to judge and proportion 
the fupplies according to the neceffities of the poor *. 

Antiquities. — The venerable ruins of the caftle of Dun- 
Tjar, are juftly efteemed a remarkable piece of antiquity. 
There is no hiftory nor tradition to fix the date of this 
building, or to point out the perfon by whom it was ereft- 
ed. Camden narrates, that Gofpatrick, Earl of Northum- 
berland, retiring into Scotland from the Norman Con- 
quell, was honoured by Malcolm Canmore with the caftle 
of Dunbar, and earldom of March, and that his pofterity 
afterwards took the firname of Dunbar. King Edward II. 
of England, efcaped to this caftle, (then in the hands of 
the Englifli), after the battle of Bannockburn, and thence 
fled to Berwick in a fiftierman's boat. It has been large, 
and built on feveral rocks, within the fea-mark. It was 
exceeding ftrong, and before the ufe of artillery, quite im- 
pregnable.

iiegnable. In fome old records, it is called Earl Patrick'5 
Strong Houfe. It was always efteemed a place of import- 
ance, and the key to Scotland on the S. E. border. Dun* 
bar was, for many years, during the cruel wars between 
the two nations, the fcene of much aftion and bloodlhed. 
The town was frequently ravaged and burnt. The caftle was 
often befieged, and fometimes bravely defended ; particu- 
larly anno 1336, when under the government of a lady, 
called, Black Agnes of Dunbar, the wife of Patrick Earl 
of March, and the fifter of Randolph Earl of Murray. 
This manly heroine, in the abfence of her hufband, by her 
vigilance and military courage, forced Lord Montague to 
raife the fiege, and leave the country. To this caftle, Earl 
Eothwell fled, and left the unfortunate Queen Mary in the 
hands of the affociated Lords at Carberryhill. It was ta- 
ken afterwards from Both well's dependents, by the Earl 
of Murray, the Regent of Scotland, and demoliflied, and 
'he artillery was carried to Edinburgh, by order of the 
Parliament. 

Within the parifti of Dunbar, lies a part of Down Hill, 
amous for the encampment of General Leflie, with the 
Scotch army, before their defeat at the battle of Dunbar. 
This battle was fought in the low grounds, E. from Brox- 
mouth. At Broxmouth, there is a mount of earth, which 
'^ill retains the name of Cro?nwell's Mount. At the church 
yard, there is an elegant monument, with a fine marble 
fcatue, erefted anno i5io, to the memory of George, the 
laft Earl of Dunbar, and Lord High Treafurer of Scotland. 
In the church yard, there are two grave-ftones, marking 
at the burial place of two ofFicers of the caftle ; they are 
Icely cut, with Latin infcriptions in Saxon charafters ; 
:he date of the one is MCCCL. and of the other MCCCLI.

Mifcellaneoux Ohfervations. — There is but little wood, 
which makes the couatry look naked. The land is thought 
too valuable to admit of much planting. About Brox- 
mouth there are forae large and venerable old trees. On the 
Links of Weft Barns, there is a fmall young plantation, and % 
very fine fituation for a houfe. The poft road runs from 
E. to W. the whole length of the pariQi, and is kept 
in good repair. There are two toll bars, one at 'the Kirk 
Hill, eaft from Dunbar, and the other on the weft fide, at j 
Belhaven. There arc four bridges maintained by the coun- * 
ty. The crofs roads are kept in good order by the ftatute 
labour. — The expence in drefs, in furniture of the houfe, , 
and in the table, is greatly increafed from what was the 
mode half a century ago. This is indeed the cafe in general 
throughout every part of Scotland, in proportion to the pro- } 
grefs of refinement and wealth, in the prefent advanced pe-,'- 
riod of fociety. The yearly wages of a man-fervant in a ji 
family is 7 guineas, or 74- guineas, and a woman -fervant 
gets 3 guineas •, a day-labourer, i s. a-day, and a woman 
for working in the fields, 6 d. ; a gardener i s. 2 d. ; a ma- , 
fon or carpenter, i s. 8 d. In harveft, the corn is cut down I 
by day-labourers, and their wages vary according to cir--- 
cumftances, fuch as the weather, the number of reapers^ 
in the market to be hired, &amp;c.— There is a good butcher 
market in Dunbar ; beef and mutton bring 4 d. or

Introductory Observations. 



IT cannot be expefted, in a work of this kind, that a com. | 
plete hiftory of this city fhould be given. It is there^| 
fore only intended, to give a concife view of various par- , 
ticulars, tending to illuftrate its ancient and prefent ftate ; ^ 
referring thofe, who wifli to have a fuller account of its • 
rife and progrefs, its public buildings, Sec. to the hiftories 
of it already publilhed, by M'Ure and Gibfon. , 



Glafgow is fituated in' the nether ward of Lanarklliire 
or Clydefdale, on the banks of the river Clyde, which JiJ 

takes

takes its rife about 50 miles nearer the head of the ftiire. 
its latitude 55° 51' 3^'' north, and its longitude 4° 15' weft 
from London. A very accurate map of the city was pu- 
blillied fome years ago, by Mr M'Arrhur, and a map of 
the royalty, under the infpeftion of the Magiftrates, by the 
town's iurveyor. It is propofed to publifli a map of its 
environs for 7 miles.— The tide flows, (at leaft at Iprir.g 
tides,) nearly about 4 miles above the city \ but he Cl de, 
itntil of late years, was only navigable to Glafgow by 
fmall velTels, and even thefe met with many obitrudions 
from the numerous fhoals and fand banks which were in 
it. This inconvenience was much felt b} the inhabitants, 
and many propofals were made to have it remedied. As 
far back as the reign of Queen Mary, it Is reported, that 
many hundreds of the citizens of GU.fgow, in conjunaicn 
with the inhabitants of Renfrew and Dnmbartcn, under 
the infpeaion of oflRcers appointed by the ]\;agiltriites, 
lived for fix weeks, per vices, m tents and huts, about 13 
miles below Glafgow, endeavouring to remove the obflruc- 
' tion of the river at Dumbuck Ford. Thefe, or limilar ef- 
forts, however, had not the defired efi^ed ; and hence, af- 
ter feveral furveys, an ad of Parliament was obtained in 
1759, in order to render it navigable for large veflels, by 
means of locks. Many difficulties, however, having oc- 
curred, this fcheme was dropped, and another aft was af- 
terwards obtained, for improving the navigation of the ri- 
ver, from Dumbuck Ford to Glafgow, by deepening the 
bed of the river, and ftraitening the channel by means of 
jetties on the fides of it -, for defraying the expence of 
which, a tonnage duty of 8 d. a-ton on coals, and 1 s. a-ton 
on all goods and merchandize, that fhould be carried be_ 
tween Dumbuck Ford and the city, was allowed to be levied. 
In the year 1775, the work was fo far finilhed, that the depth 
was increafed fo much, as to allow veflels drawing 6 feet 



490 



Statijlkal Account 



water to navigate to the city. By the ftrength given t? 
the current of the river, by the jetties, and by the opera- 
tions fince th;it time, vefiek drawing 7 feet 6 inches are 
now navigated to Glafgow, and veffels drawing 9 feet to 
Renfrew ferry. The money expended in thefe operations, 
with the intereft thereon, amounts to upwards of L. 50,000. 
The firft tonnage dues, that were levied, (from ift July 
1770 to ift July 177 i) amounted to L. 1021 : 5 : i, fince 
which they continued to increafe gradually until July 
X790, when the increafe became flill more rapid. Fiom 
that time to July 1791, they amounted to L. 2144, 16 s. 
The next year they let for L. 2400, and this year (from 
July 1792 to July 1793), they are let for L. 3205. The 
debt on the river is now conhderably reduced ; and as the 
tonnage is every/ year increafing, it is hoped, that it will 
foon be altogether paid off. As it does not appear, that 
there are any rocks or great Hones in the river, it is ex- 
pected, that, by a continuation of the operations of dragging, 
and erefting jetties and dikes, the bed of the river may be. 
brought to a level, from Dunglafs to the quay of Glafgow ; 
and that, in the courfe of a few years, veffels drawing 
9 or 10 feet water, may be able to navigate to the city. 

The See of Glalgovv is faid to have been founded about ' 
the year 560, by St Mungo, or Kentigern, and afterwards \ 
erefted into an Archbifljopiick in 1484. The cathedral, i 
though by no means the moft elegant or magnificent in ' 
Scotland, is ftill a very venerable monument of Gothic ar- \ 
fhitefture, and the moil entire in the kingdom. It is 284 
feet long, 65 broad, and 90 feet high within the walls, with j 
two large towers, on one of which a fpire was built, a- \ 
bout the year 1420, making the height 220 feet. The 
chiirch itfelf was begun to be rebuilt, in the beginning of 
the 1 2th century, and was enlarged by Joceline, abbot of 
Mekofs, then biiliop of Glafgow ; and, from an infcription 

upon 



of Glafgow, 



491 



upon a ftone, above the entry to the choir of the church, it 
appears to have been dedicated during thiit prelate's incum- 
bency, in the year 1197. 

This cathedral is one of thofe few (lately fabrics of Gothic 
architecture, which efcaped deftruftion at the time of the Re- 
formation,(when the indifcreetzeal, of the firft reformers, le- 
velled to the ground, almoft every place of religious worfhip 
in the kingdom), being faved by the public fpirit of the citi- 
zens. It appears, however, from the records of the Town- 
council, 19th January 1573, that, notwithftanding the care 
t)f the citizens to prevent the cathedral from utter deftruc- 
tion, a great part of the lead, flates, and other materials of 
the church, had been, through the diforders of the times, 
dilapidated : And that, although the city was not under a- 
hy legal obligation, to uphold the fabric in repair, (that be- 
ing incumbent on thofe then in polTeffion of the See), yet they 
voluntarily taxed themfelves in L. 200 Scotch, to repair 
the cathedral, though under exprefs proteftations, that fuch' 
contributions fliould infer no precedent. Archbifhop Spot- 
tifwood relates, that, in the year 1578, it had nearly been 
demoliflied, but was faved by the public fpirit of the crafts, 
tvho took arms to prevent its deftruftion. 

This cathedral was dedicated to St Mungo or Kentigern, 
It had 39 prebends attached to it, the prebendaries of which 
had houfes and gardens .in its neighbourhood,, being obliged 
to refide there, and to employ curates or vicars in their 
refpedive pariihes. After the Reformation, thefe houfes 
were either fold or given to the noblemen or gentlemen, who 
Were at that time favourites at court. One of them, which 
belonged to the prebi^ndary of Douglas, was given to the Earl 
of Eglinton, and, after paffing through feveral hands, was 
^urchafed by the city of Glafgow in 1635, who have fince 
nfed it as the correction houfe. Another, which belonged 
%a the parfon of Glafgow, was given to Lord Kilmarnock, 

and

and is now an alehoufe ; and a number of the others, whrch 
are ftill ftanding, are in limilar fituations. The cathedral 
is now divided into three feparate places of worfhip, and 
confiderable attention is paid every year to keep it in re- 
pair. 

Nigh the cathedral, was the bifliop's palace or caftle, the 
great tower of which was built by John Cameron, former- 
ly fecretary of ftate, and afterwards confecrated bifhop of 
Glafgow in 1426. It was augmented by Biftiop Beatoun, 
in the beginning of the i6th century, who built another 
tower, and inclofed the whole with a high ftone wall of 
excellent workmanfliip. His fucceflbr, Bilhop Dunbar, 
built a handfome gateway to the palace, fronting the 
clmrch, on which his arms were engraven under the royal 
arms of Scotland, and which was ftanding a few years ago ; 
but both it and all the reft of the building having gone 
to ruin^ The remainder has been ordered to be taken down, 
having been granted by the Grown, to ere£t an in- 
firmary on the ground where it flood. In order to ftiew 
the fituation it was reduced to, when this took place, two 
accurate drawings of it have been taken, which are to be 
framed and hung up in fome of the rooms of the new 
building. 

Almoft all the towns of any antiquity, in Europe, owe 
their origin, to the fituation of a caftle, a cathedral, an ab- 
bacy, or a fea-port. Thefe naturally gathered round them 
a variety of different perfons, connefted with thefe efta- 
blifliments, where they found proteftion and employment, 
amidft the diforders and violence, to which the inhabitants 
of the open country were frequently expofed. Glafgow e- 
vidently derives its origin from the eftablifliment of its 
cathedral, near to which the houies of the old town were 
built, and which extended gradually towards the river, as 
the inhabitants turned thek attention to commerce. — ^About 

the 



of Glafgow. 



the year 1 1 7 2, Glafgow was erefted by William, firnamed the 
lyon, into a royal burgh, in favour of St Kentigern, and 
Joceline, bifhop of Glafgow, which was confirmed and ex- 
tended by fubfequent kings. In 1450, King James the 11. 
erefted the city and barony of Glafgow into a regality, in 
favour of the bifhop, who, the more effeftually to fecure 
the obedience of his vaffals, tenants, and other inhabitants 
of the barony, appointed powerful nobles, bailies of the 
regality. This office was long m the family of the Dukes 
of Lennox, who, in 1621, acquired from the biftiop an ab- 
folute grant ot the office. The Buke of Lennox at length 
refigned it to the Grown, who, after the Revolution, until 
1748, appointed bailies of the regality. And as this right 
•was not aboliftied by the jurifdiftion ad, it is fuppofed to 
be ftill competent to the Crown to revive that office. 

In 161 1, King James VI. granted the city a very ample 
charter, by which he erefted it into a burgh royal, to be 
holden under his Majefty in free burgage. In 1636, King 
Charles I. granted a charter to the city, to be holden of his 
Majefty, containing very ample powers and privileges, and 
confirming its power of elefting a bailie on the river Clyde, 
■whofe diilria extends from the bridge to the Cloch, in 
which he exercifes a maritime, civil, and criminal jurifdic- 
tion. This charter was afterwards ratified by aft of Parlia- 
ment, in 166 1 ; and, after the Revolution, all former charters, 
and a6b of Parliament in the city's favour, were confirmed 
by an a6t in 1690. 

Although, from the period, in which Glafgow was firft - 
eredted into a royal burgh, it held its commercial and poli- 
tical privileges by fucceffive grants from the Crown ; yet, 
as thefe grants were in favour of the bifhop, he, afterwards 
the archbiQiop, and then the Lord of regality, (who, upon 
the abolition of Kpifcopacy, came in place of the archbi- 
fliop), had the privilege of elefting the Magiftracy. In 

times, 



494 



Statijiical Account 



times, however, of violence and diforder, this right W3 

fometimes interrupted, and occafionally exercifed by the ) 

King, by the Convention of Eftates, by Parliament, or by j 

the citizens themfeives ; but, according to the legal confti- J 

tution of the burgh, before the Revolution!, the bifliops and « 

Archbilhops, and the Lord of Regality, on biu coming in their ; 

place, did, previous to the 1641, ele6t the Pro voft annually, ; 
and alio the Bailies, from leets for the latter, fent them by 

the To wn-council. In more early times, the Gcuncil were I 
nominated by the Provoft and Bailies ; fo that, ii reality, 

the Bifhop, or Lord of Regality, had the nomination of - 

the whole Magiftracy of the town. But, in 1641, an aft • 

of Parliament gave to Glafgow free liberty of elefting ; 

their own Magiftrates yearly, v/ith this exception, that the \ 

Provoft, Bailies, and Council fliould prefent to James Duke • 

of Lenox, then, in right of the Archbilboprick, Lord of \ 

the Regality of Glafgow, a leet of three perfons to be Pro- ' ] 

voft, one of whom the Duke fliould be obliged to nominate "\ 

yearly, by himfelf or his commiffioners prefent at the ca- ^ 

ftle; and, in cafe of their abfence, the eleftion of the Pro- \ 

voft was vefted in the Magiftrates and Council. This con- \ 

ftitution continued till the refti tution of Epifcopacy in 5 

1662, which reftored the Archbifhop to his ancient right j 

of naming the Provoft annually, and of chufing the Bailies 'i 

out of the leets fent him by the Council, which gave hin | 

entirely the controul of the whole Magiftrates and Coun- \ 

oil. At the Revolution, King William, with the advice of i 

his Privy-council, authorifed a new and free elei9;ion of the ) 

Bailies and Council, by poll of the burgefFes, and empower- j 

ed the Magiftrates and Council to ele£t the Provoft. Af- ] 

terwards, by an adt of Parliament in "1690, the Town- '| 

council got the power of chufing their own Magiftrates,- ' 

and other officers of the burgh, as fully and freely as the j 
city of Edinburgh, or any other royai burgh. The form- 

and 

f 



of Glafgow, 

and manner of this eledtlon, by the Town council, has Gnce 
varied, according to the differentyf/j, or conftitutions, adopt- 
ed by the Council at different periods. In 1711, the for- 
mer fet underwent fome alterations, which were confirmed 
by the Convention of Royal Burghs. In 1748, another fet 
was adopted and agreed to by the Council, Merchants, and 
Trades Houfes J and, being confirmed that year by the Con- 
vention of Royal Burghs, forms the prefent fet, or form of 
government. 

By it, the care of the public intereft and revenue, is com- 
mitted to the Lord Provoft, three Baiiies, Dean of Guild, 
Deacon Convener, Treafurer, Matter of Works, 13 Mer- 
chant and 12 Trades Councillors. The Magiftracy, or 
executive part of the government of the city, is vefted in 
(I the Lord Provoft and Magiftrates, who find it a very labo- 
3 nous fervice, and the difficulties attending it are every day 
increafing, as the eflitfts of an annual or biennial Magiftra- 
' cy, are fcarcely able to reftrain the irregularities of a nume- 
rous, increafing, and opulent commonalty. More than 200 
years ago, when the Bifhop was in ufe to chufe two, and 
fometimes three Bailies out of the leet fent him by the 
Council, the latter ufed frequently to complain, that the 
number was not adequate to the bufinefs of the office, and 
requefted him to add one or two more to their number. 
This curious fadt may ferve to give fome idea of the trou- 
ble attending upon it now, when the inhabitants are fo 
much jncreafed. 

The citizens are divided into two ranks, merchants and 
tradefmen, which laft confift of 14 incorporations. Thefe, 
befides holding a monopoly in their different branches, are 
poflefled of confiderable funds for their own poor, and 
each of them have a fubordinate government over their re- 
fpeftive members, but no civil or criminal jurifdidion. We 
have no record vvhen this diftinaion firft took place ; but 
we find, that, about the beginning of the 17th century, 

various 



the 



496 Statijlical Account | 

various difputes had arifen refpefting their fevcral rights ' 
and privileges. Thefe were fixed, on a reference between ^ 
the different parties in 1604, by a decrcet-arbitral, known j 
by the name of the Letter of Guildry, which was con- ; 
firmed by the Town-council that fame year, and after- ] 
wards by an a£t of Parliament in 1672, by which the ). 
rights of the burgeffes, the regulations of the Dean of Guild | 
court, the eleftion of the Dean of Guild and the Convener, 
and the conftitution of the Merchants and Trades Houfes, 
were fixed and fettled. 

The Town-court, for the decifion of all civil caufes, is 
held every Friday by the Bailies ; who have alfo a court on 
Monday, for deciding all caufes under 20 s. by a fummary 
procefs j and, befides thefe ftated weekly courts, the Magi- 
ftrates daily decide in caufes, which require fummary dif- \ 
cuffion, without waiting the ordinary forms of court. They | 
alfo exercife a criminal jurifdiftion, in crimes whofe pu- | 
nifliment does not infer death or demembration, or far- 
ther banifhment than beyond the liberties of the burgh, i 

The Dean of Guild, with the affiftance of 4 perfons cho- j, 
fen by the merchants and 4 by the trades, holds a court i 
every Thurfday, for determining in all matters relative to I 
buildings, and differences arifing from neighbourhood of 
property within the city, and alfo for regulating and over- 
feeing the weights and meafures. The Sheriff of Lanark, 
or his fubftitute, holds a court here every Wednefday. 
The Commiflariot Courts of Glafgow, and of Hamilton and 
Campfie, are held on Thnrfday, and the Lords of Jufticiary j 
hold the affizes here in fpring and autumn. \ 

The revenue of the city. In the management of the Town- ] 
council, is about L. 7000 per annum, and arlfes from the 
rents of land and houfes belonging to the community ; from 
the rents of the church feats ; from an impoft of two pennies 
Scotch on every Scotch pint of ale, brewed or fold within 



of Glafgow.

.he citj or village of Gorbals, from certain dues, payable 
on all meal or grain brought into the citj, and from the 
dues of cranage, &amp;c. at the quay and weigh-houfe, and 
other fmall cuftoms ufual in royal burghs. 

This city is joined with Rutherglen, Renfrew and Dum- 
barton, in fending one member to the Britifli Houfe of 
Commons, which feat is at prefent filled by William Mac- 
dowall, Efq; of Garthland. The armorial bearing of the 
city is, on a field parti, p. fefs, argent and gules, an oak 
tree, furmounted with a bird in chief, a falmon with a 
gold ftoned ring in its mouth in bafe, and on a branch in 
the finifter fide, a bell kngued or, all proper. The motto, 
* Let Glafgow flourift.' Before the Reformation, St Man- 
go's head mitred, appeared in the dexter fide of the (hield, 
which had two falmon for fupporters. 



II. COMMERCE- 

The firft branch of trade, in which the citizens of Glaf- 
gow engaged, feems to have been the curing and exporta- 
tion of falmon, caught in the river Clyde. About the 
middle of the i6th century, they appear to have had vef- 
iels at fea, which made attacks on the fliipping of the Eng- 
lifti. In the end of the i6th, and beginning of the 17th 
century, they, together with the inhabitants of Renfrew 
and Dumbarton, profecuted the fifhery of falmon and her- 
ring with great fpirit, and to a confiderable extent. In 
the reign of Charles the II. we find a privateer was fitted 
out in the Clyde, to cruife againfl the Dutch. In the lat- 
ter end of the lafl: century, the merchants of Glafgow con- 
tinued to export their falmon and herrings, the principal 
market for which was France, from whence, in return, 
they imported confiderable quantities of brandy, fait and 

Vol. v. 3 R wines. 



493 



Statijlical Account 



wines. About the fame time, alfo, they fent^'fome vcffels 
to the Baltic, from whence they imported iron, and as the 
fpirit of enterprife had now taken root, they adventured 
boldly in the unfortunate expedition to Darien. • 

The Union with England, in 1707, opened new views 
to the traders in Glafgow, having then liberty of a free 
commerce to America and the Weft Indies, which they 
had not before. Immediately, therefore-, after this event, 
they began to take advantage of it, fending out goods for 
the ufe of the colonies, and returning with cargoes of to- 
bacco. At firft, they had no fliips of their own in that 
trade, but employed Englifli bottoms ; and it was not un- 
til the year 1718, that a lliip, the property of Glafgow, 
croffed the Atlantic. The tobacco trade of Glafgow was 
now, however, in fuch a thriving condition, that it fp much 
excited the jealoufy of the merchants in London, Bri- 
ftol, Liverpool and Whitehaven, that they entered into a 
combination for the difcouragement, if not the ruin of it. 
For this purpofe, they accufed the merchants of frauds a-^ 
gainft the revenue, firft before the Commiffioners of the 
cuftoms at London, afterwards by petitions to the Lords of 
the Treafury, and when both thefe failed, by a direa ap- 
plication to the Houfe of Commons. Though no fraud a- 
gainft the revenue could be detefted, yet the powerful in- 
fluence of the Englifti merchants prevailed, and new offi- 
cers having been appointed at Greenock and Port- Glaf- 
gow, in whofe power it was to teize and harrafs the mer- 
chants, their fcheme became fuccefsful, and the trade lan- 
guiftied and declined until about the year 1 735. At this 
period, it again revived, though not with its former 
vigour, the number of veffels belonging to Clyde, and 
at that time trading to America, the Weft Indies, the 
ports in the Mediterranean, Baltic, Ireland and the diffe- 
rent towns upon the coaft of Britain, being only 67, and

their burden about 5600 tons. Between this period and 
the year 1750, the trade of Glafgow advanced, however, 
but flowly ; and though the merchants then began to efta- 
blifh fadlors in America, and to increafe the extent of their 
dealings, by difpofing of the goods they fent out upon cre- 
dit •, yet the rilk was thereby rendered infinitely greater, 
than it had been before, and the trade more fpeculative 
and uncertain. From that time, it continued to increafe 
annually Until the late war ; arid the reader may fee in 
Gibfon's Hiftory, an accurate ftatement of the imports and 
exports of the river Clyde, from the 5th January 1 771 to 
the 5th January 1772, the greateft part of which belonged 
to the merchants of Glafgow. ' The importation of goods 
from America and the Weft Indies, in the year 1775, will 
give fome idea of the extent of the trade, and was as fol-

merica was nearly put a flop to j and as the greateft part

of the fortunes of the merchants in Glafgow was embark- 
ed in that trade, and very large fums owing them, which 
they were prevented from recovering, it proved the ruin 
of many ; and would have been fatal to more, had it not 
been the great rife on the price of tobacco, which then 
fortunately took place, which enabled thofe who had a 
large quantity of that commodity, to ftand the fhock which 
their credit at that time received, and to make up in part 
for the immenfe lodes fuftained by them, in their Ameri. 
can debts. Scill, however, many individuals, who reckon- 
ed themfelves poflefled of independent fortunes, found 
themfelves and families reduced to indigence, and unable 
to fulfil their engagements, with thofe to whom they were 
indebted ; thus extending the mifery, which this unfortu- 
nate war had brought on them, to a very wide circle, 
which is ftlU felt by many, as debts, to a' very large a- 
mount, are ftill due. 

Though the commerce of the city was thus interrupted, 
yet the fpirit, which had been raifed, was not extinguiflied. 
The merchants, therefore, on being deprived of the Ame- 
rican trade, began to look out for new fources, and ac- 
cordingly extended their commerce to the Weft Indies 
and the continent of Europe, confiderably more than be- 
fore ; and though the flaipping, at the time of the greateft 
extent of the American trade, was more than it is at 
prefent, being then fuppofed to amount to near 60,000 
tons, yet it appears to be confiderably on the increafe, as 
the Hiips belonging to Clyde in 1783 were only 386^ and 
their tonnage 22,896; whereas in 1790 their number 
was 476, and their tonnage 46,581. This lofs, however, 
in the foreign trade is amply compenfated by the great in- 
creafe of manufadtures ; the merchants having, of late, 
turned their attention more to improve the manufaaures, 
which had been begun among them, and to eftablilh new 

ones, 



of Glafgow. 



501 



ones, which promife to be a fource of much more per- 
manent wealth than the other. Hence an event, which 
lor a time diminiftied, and, it was feared, would ruin the 
trade of Glafgow, has eventually produced to its inhabi- 
lants the moft folid advantages. The capital and enter- 
rife of its traders, have, fince that period, purfued different 
direftions of employment. The combined powers of fo- 
reign trade, coafting trade, and manufa£lures, the two lall 
of which have of late years made fuch prodigious ftrides, 
now operating on each other with redoubled energy, are 
plainly difcernible, in the rapid increafe of inhabitants and 
of new buildings ; and bid fair to fecure to its induftrious and 
enterprifing citizens, a growing and permanent fund of 
wealth and profperity. 

III. Manufactures. 

Little information can be got concerning the manufac- 
tures of Glafgow before the Union, though, it is faid, that 
of plaids was confiderable ; and though, at that time, a 
ropework and foapwork, and a refining of fugar were be- 
f gun at Glafgow, yet neither thefe, nor any other manu- 
fadture feem to have been carried to any great extent, un- 
til they began to perceive how advantageoufly articles of 
manufadlure could be difpofed of, in their commercial in- 
tercourfe with America. It was, therefore, in the period 
between 1725 and 1750, that the fpirit for manufadlures 
iirft became prevalent •, and though it has ever fince beea 
increafing in energy, and difFufing its influence, its efFecb 
for a few years paft have been wonderful. The variety of 
manufaftures now carried on in Glafgow, which have ex- 
tended in almoft every branch, are very great ; but that 
'vhich feems, for feme years paft, to have excited the 

moft 



562 Stati/iicai Account 

iTioft general attention, is the manufadhire of cotton cloths 
of various kinds, together with the arts depending on it. 
For this purpofe cotton mills, bleachfields, and printfields, 
have been ereded on almoft all the ftreams in the 
neighbourhood, affording water fufficient to move the 
machinery, befides many erefted at a very conliderable 
diftance j and though the number of thefe mills have c 
increafed greatly of late, yet they are ftill unable to: 
fupply the neceflary "quantity of yarn, required by the! 
increafed manufa6hires, as a conliderable quantity is ftilll 
daily brought from England. This trade not only em-t 
ploys a great number of perfons in Glafgow, but is extend-i 
ed over a very large trad of country in the neighbourhood,! 
many weavers being employed by the Glafgow manufac-: 
turers, 20 and 30 miles from the city. In 1791, it wasc 
computed, that they employed 15,000 looms; that eachi 
loom gave employment to nine perfons at an average, in-i 
eluding women and children, in the different ftages of that 
manufadlure, from picking the cotton wool, until thee 
goods were brought to market, making in all 135,000; 
perfons ; and that each loom, at an average, produc-edi 
goods to the value of L. 100 per ann. making L. 1,500,600,1: 
The increafe, fince that calculation was made, has been very) 
great ; but to what extent it is at prefent carried, cannot be 
faid with any precifion, for want of fufficient data. This:; 
manufafture is not only important in itfelf, but is produc-c 
live of work to many thoufands of bleachers, tambourers,'s 
callico printers, &amp;c. many of whom, being women and chil-1 
dren, whofe work was formerly unprodudlive, renders it ol? 
ftill more importance to the country. Though this great 
manufafture has, in fome meafui-e, fupplanted the linen 1 
trade, whichiufed to be theftaple manufadure of the wefl 
of Scotland, there is yet, however, a very great quantity; 
of linens, lawns, cambrics, checks, diapers, &amp;.c. ftill made 

thottgt 



ofGlafgow. 

hough the demand for cotton goods, has much diminiflied ' 
the confumption of thefe articles. There i? alfo a confider- 
ible manufaftory of carpets and coarfe woollens, for which 
noplace feems to be better adapted, being in the neigh- 
lourhoood of a country where great quantities of flieep 
re raifed. As the gentlemen in Scotland feem now to 
have turned their attention to the improvement of the 
breed of fiieep, in fuch a manner as to give hopes of bring- 
ng the wool to its greateft perfection, there is no doubt, but 
this manufadlure may be on cairied to a very confiderable 
xtent. — As it is now managed in this part of the country, 
it bids fairer for continuing to thrive, and being more 
ufeful than formerly ; being confined to thofe kinds of 
cloth, which are bcft adapted to the wool that is^.-moft 
commonly to be met with ; fuch as, carpets, blankets, 'Ken- 
dal goatings, &amp;c. .^whereas, formerly, fuperfine cloth was, 
in general, aimed at, an article for which our native wool 
was not originally calculated. 

Thejilk gau%e manufa£lure was carried on here for more 
than 20 years, with confiderable fuccefs, but is now almoft 
entirely gone. 

This was the firft place in Britain where the hide loom 
was eflablilbed, Mr Alexander Harvie having, in the year 
1732, at a very great rifle of his life, brought over a model 
lof a loom, and one of the workmen from Haerlem, and 

■ begun the manufacture here. Since that time they have 

■ b^n erefled in Manchefter, and- other places of the king- 
dom, but ftill foxm"^^' Vgty exteniiYe_.bFanch in tliis city. 

Delft ware, in imitation of the Dutch, was likewife firft 
begun hereof any place in Scotland; a work of that kind 
having been erected in 1748; fince which it has been al- 
tered into the manufacture of ftone or Queen's v^are, in 
which very confiderable improvements have been made of 
late, both in the quality, lhapes, jind colour of the ware ; fo 

that 



504 



Statijlical Account 



that it nearlj rivals fome of the fineft works of that kind 
in Staffordfliire. All the coarfer kinds of pottery, together 
with hricks, tiles, &amp;c. are alfo made here in great abundance. 
A very confiderable quantity of hats are likewife manufac- 
tured, not only for honne fale, but for exportation to America 
and the Weft Indies, together with nun's thread, filk, cotton 
and worfted ftockings, and gloves of all kinds. During the 
time of the American trade, large quantities of tobacco 
were manufaftured into fnufF, &amp;c. and immenfe quantities 
of fhoes and faddles made and exported to that country, for 
which purpofe very extenfive works were erefted for 
tanning leather. Thefe manufaftures ftill continue, though 
perhaps not to the extent that they did at that time. 

The manufaflures of ropes and cordage of alL kinds, 
the making of foap and candle, and the refining of fugar, 
which appear to have been the firft that were begun here, 
are ftill carried on to a great extent, though they have loft 
the privileges, granted for their encouragement before the 
Union. The art of type founding, has been long prac- 
tifed here, and, (together with that of printing bj Mr 
Saunders, Mr Urie, and the Meffrs Foulis), has been brought 
to as great perfeftion, as in any part of the world. The 
introduftion of the cotton manufafhire, and thofe trades 
depending on it, has given rife to many new manufaftures, 
and to the making machinery of all kinds, which, toge- 
ther with all kinds of work, in caft or malleable iron, and 
in brafs and lead, are now made here in great quantities. 
The manufaclure of bottles, or green glafs, has been long 
eftabliftied here, and is now confiderably increafed ; and 
has of late been extended to flint glafe, in which they have 
come to great perfedHon. 

About the year 1760, a very extenfive brewery was 
erefted near Anderfton, from which large quantities of 
ale and porter were exported to Ireland and to America. 

Since 



hf Glafgow. 



505 



Since that time, a number of others of the fame kiiid 
have been erefled in the city, and fo great is the additional 
increafe in the ufe of malt liquors, that moft part of what 
they now manufaflure, is confumed at home. As porter 
brewed in; the city, and its vicinity, is now much more 
drunk in public houfes by tradefmen, than formerly, it 
has confequently diminiftied the confumption of whilky, 
that article fo deftrudlive to the health and morals of the 
people ; though ftill it is to be lamented, that fo much of 
it is yet made ufe of. 

It would be difficult to enumerate all the different bran- 
ches of manufafture carried on here ; nor is it poffible, with 
any precifion, to afcertain their extent, and therefore any 
thing on that head would be mere conjefture. The confe- 
quence, however, of thefe works, is a very great increafe 
in the wages of all kinds of manufafturers, mechanics and 
labourers ; and notwithftanding the great increafe of the in- 
habitants, and the many late inventions for abridging la- 
bour, there is ftill a difficulty to procure a fufficient number 
of hands, to perform the work of the different under- 
takings, which the people here hav,e ftock and fpirit to 
carry on. — The weekly wages of journeymen tradefmen in 
Glafgow at prefent, are nearly as follows : fhoemakers from 
9 s. to 12 s.*, women employed in binding Ihoes, from 5 s. 
to 7 s. ; ordinary wrights, or carpenters, from 8 s. to 12 s. 
and fome of the beft workmen- fo high as from 12 s. to 
18 s.; timber fawers, about 12 s.; ordinary mafons, from 
ICS. to 12 s. and the beft workmen from 12 s. to 16 s. - 
printers compofitors, from 10 s. 6 d. to 18 s. 5 prefsmen^ 
from los. to 12 s. j bookbinders, from 7 s. to ic s. 6 d. ; 
weavers, from 12 s. to 14 s. and fome of the beft work- 
men, from 14 s. to 18 s. and even 20 s. ; women and girls 
for winding yarn and tambouring, about 4 s. ; old men and 
boys and girls, at different branches, (fpinning, preparing

the yarn and cotton wool, Stc for weaving), from 6 s. to 
8 s.; flocking weavers, from 5 s. to 10 s. and feme of the 
beft workmen, from 10 s. to 16 s.; women at feaming 
ftockings, from 3 s. to 5 s. a-week. The foregoing rates 
of wages are earned by the different perfons employed, by 
the job, or piece work. When labourers, fuch as barrow- 
men to mafons, and others of fimilar defcription, are hired 
by the day, their wages are from I s. 3 d. to i s. 6 d. a- 
day. 

The increafe of the commerce and raanufaftures of the 
city gave rife, in the year 1783, to a fociety, known by 
the name of The Chamber of Commerce and ManufaSiures ; 
the intention of which was, to unite the influence of the 
merchants and manufafturers, and thus render them more 
ufeful to the communities, to which they belonged •, and, bj 
eftablilhing a public fund, to give ftrength and efficacy to 
the meafures of thofe who fliould intereft themfelves for the 
public good. A number of the merchants and manufac- 
turers of Glafgovv, Paifley, Greenock, &amp;c. forefeeing the 
utility of this fcheme, fubfcribed to it, and obtained a royal 
charter, incorporating them into a body politic, managed 
by 30 directors ; and they have lince employed their in- 
fluence and funds, for the benefit and protedlion of the trade 
and manufadtures eftablilhed among us ; and by their exer- 
tions, have been, in many inftances, of eflential fervice. 



IV. PoPULATIOir. 

The information, with regard to the population of Glaf- 
gow, is copious and authentic. In Auguft, 1609, a regifter 
of baptifms was begun fince which time, it has been well

kept, and carefully preferved. Faffing over the firfl year, 
in which feveral perfons might regiftrate the names of their 
children, though they had been born fome time before, we 
find, 

In 161 1 there were 268 children regiftrated.

1617 314 

The average number of which 7 years, is 294, which mul- 
tiplied by 26, would make the number of fouls in Glafgow 
7644. In taking a view of the fame regifter, before and 
after the Reftoration, in 1660, we find it as follows : 

In 1656 

1657 i^i 

1658 591

The average number of which, being 564I, multiplied by 
the fame rule, gives 14,670.

1663 438 ^ 

The average number of which, being 473, makes, by the 
fame rule, only 12,298. Whether this decreafe in the po- 
pulation arofe from fome caufe about the time of the 
Reftoration, or whether, from fome defeft in the regifter 
of baptifms, cannot now be determined with precifion ; 
but, if the regifter is accurate, and to be reckoned a

rule for calculation, the city does not appear to have re 
covered the fan.e population it had in X659, until „ ; 
the year 1720. 

The regider of deaths appears to have been very re^u 
Jarly k^pt, from the year 1694 to 1777, after which there 
IS a blank for five years, owing to the perfon who kept .he 
regifter having become fuperannuated ; but from 1785 it 
has again been kept very regularly and exadly. At the 
begmnmg of this century, there were only two buryin. 
grounds, but fince that time others have been opened both 
m the city and fuburbs. And, as a number of the inhabi- 
tantsofGlafgoware buried in thefe church-yards in the 
fuburbs, andfome of the inhabitants of the fuburbs are in 
terred within the city, it is neceffary to take the numbers 
m all thefe burying grounds, in order to afcertain the popu- 
lation and increafe of the inhabitants. The following ta 
ble exhibits the average number for every 10 years, from 
the beginning of this century to the prefent time, of bap- 
tifms, proclamations of banns and burials. But it muft be 
remarked, that the regifter of baptifms and proclamations, 
relate only to the royalty, whereas the bills of mortality 
include alfo the fuburbs.

From this table it may be -remarked, that the city of 
. ^lafgow has been gradually increafing, but more remark- 
ably fince the Union of the two kingdoms, though moft 
of all within the laft 20 years. In making calculations, 
however, from thefe tables, it (hould be obferved, that the 
lilt of baptilms for a confiderable number of years paft, is 
fuppofed to be confiderably lefs than the truth, for the fol- 
lowing reafons : That, about the year 1738, the unfortunate 
reparation from the Church took place, which is known 
by the name of the Seceflion. This party carried away a 
confiderable number of the inhabitants to a fociety by them.- 
felves ; a very able and refpeftable clergyman preiided in 
their meetings ; they were at variance with the Eftablifli- 
ed Church, and, fond of conlidering themfelves as the 
Church of Scotland, they not only declined regiftrating their 
chiidrens names in the common manner, but they opened 
feparate regifters, as well as feparate churches. This fepa- 
jration Hill continues, and muft, therefore, in a confiderable 
idegree, affeft the regifter of baptifms, not only in this, but 
in every other place where the Seceffion has taken root. 
Another caufe, which tends to leffen the number, is, that 
fome of the inhabitants, not of the loweft rank, have of late 
years omitted the regiftration of their children's names, 
through inattention. In order, however, to affift any cal- 
culations in this matter, the refult is fubjoined of three dif- 
ferent numerations which have been taken of the inhabi- 
tants. The firft is the numeration procured by Dr Web- 
fter about 1743, when he was making his calculations 
for the widow's fund, which makes the number 18,366-, 
but in his report made up anno 1755, the population of 
Glafgow and its fuburbs, is ftated at 23,546 fouls. The 
other two were taken under the authority of the Magi- 
ftrates, and done with preci0on and accuracy ; though it 
mull be obferved, that all thefe only relate to the royalty, 

or

Statijlical Account 



or eight parifhes of Glafgow, excluding the fiiburbs. One of 
thcfe numerations was in the year i785, when it was found, 
thaft there were 9285 houfes in the city, from which deduft- 
ing 183, being warehoufes, or not inhabited, there remain 
9102 inhabited houfes. The number of males was i6,^6'^-^ 
of females 19,776 ; total 36,139, which gives the number 
in each houfe 31^^, and the proportion of males to fe- 
males about j to 6. The other numeration, which was 
made in fummer 1791, was under fuch a variety of checks, 
that great confidence may be placed in it; the feafon of 
the year did not allow the ftudents to be taken in, and the 
military were alfo excluded, as not being inhabitants. The 
refult was 10,291 inhabited houfes, and 41,777 inhabitants, 
male and female, within the royalty and New Town, 
•which gives the number in each family about /\x-g. In 
thefe years the number of baptifms and burials within the 
city, exclufive of the fuburbs, were,

But a more juft opinion of the population of Glafgow 
will be found, by confidering it as connected with its fu- 
burbs, from an enumeration of thefe alfo made in the year 
1791, as follows :

Shettlefton, N. Woodlide, and the other parts of the 
Barony parifli, are not confidei ed as part of the fuburbs, be- 
ing about from 2 to 3 miles from the centre of the city. 

In looking over the bills of mortality the following years 
appear to be unhealthy, as the number of deaths, in each of 
them, very confiderably exceeds the average, 1723, 
;74o, 1741, 1748, 1751, and 1772. 

The total bill of mortality in 1792, was 2479. 

In addition to thefe accounts, the following tables, may 
appear to be interefting, by furnifhing materials for ccm- 
parifon with other places.

V. Police. 

The increafed population of the city, arifing from the 
various branches of manufactures eftabliflied in it, has ne- 
ceffarily occafioned a greater diffolutenefs of manners and 
more crimes •, and hence the neceflity of a bridewell, or 
workhoufe, for the punilhment and corre6lion of leffer olFen- 
ces, became evident. This inftitution was begun in the year 

V0L.V. 3T 1789, 



Statijlical Account 



1789, when, in order to try the cfFefts of a plan of foli- 
tary confinement and labour, fome buildings belonging 
to the city, and formerly ufed as granaries, were fitted up 
as feparate cells, for the confinement of perfons guiliy of 
crimes meriting fuch punilhment. Thefe have been gra- 
dually increafed to the number of 64, where the priloners 
are kept feparate from one another, and employed in 
fuch labour as they can perform, mider the management of 
a keeper, and under the infpedlion of a committee of 
council, who enquire into the keeper's management, &amp;c. 
The members of the town council, alfo, in rotation are ap- 
pointed to vifit, not only thb, but the prifon and cells 
near the hofpital, once every week, and report whatever 
appears to them proper, either to be redlified or altered. 
The keeper has a record of the fentences, on which each 
prifoner is confined, — keeps an exaft account of the wages 
of their labour, and after 4efraying the ej^-pence of their 
maintenance, the furplus is paid to them, when the period 
of their confinement expires ; and fome have received frorn 
L. 5 to L. 7. Experience in this and other great towns, 
where this inftitution has been eftablillied, has demonftrated, 
that of all the fpecies of punifhment for offenders of a 
certain defcription, foHtary confinement and labour is not 
only the mofl humane, but the befl calculated to anfwer 
one great end of punifhment, the arnendment of the 
offender. — Such an eftablifhment is now become abfolutely 
necelTary in a inanufafturing city ; for feveral Britifh fta- 
tutes affign the houfe of correftion, as the punifhment of 
workmen and apprentices, who offend againft the laws in- 
troduced for the proteftion of maufadlures, and for the re- 
gulation of that numerous and ufeful body of the commu- 
nity •, and it tends to give habits of induftry, to thofe whofe 
offences arife from a difTolute and idle life. The growing 
:rianufa6hires and population of the city requiring inoie 

estenfive

extenfive accommodations, than the prefent bridewell can 
aftbrd, the Magillrates and Council propofe to ereft a new 
one, more properly calculated for the ends propofed, and 
on fuch a plan, that additions can be made to it from time 
to time, as the clrcuniftances of the, city may require. The 
good efFeas of this will, it is hoped, be experienced by 
the community, and towards the expence of it they have 
already received two confiderable bequefts. 

About the middle of laft century, the fleili market was 
held on the fides of the Trongate, the moft public ftreet of 
the city, and the fame place ferved for the Ihambles. The 
difagreeable objeds, prefented by fo naufeous a pradice, 
fuggefted a public market near the fpot where the late guard- 
houfe flood.— Still however the flefh market and lhambles 
were within the fame area.— A few years ago a farther 
improvement was introduced ; the fliambles or (laughter 
houfes were placed by the fide of the river, near the old 
bridge, and the market was removed to King-ftreet froni 
whence there is an eafy communication to the lb ambles, 
and where a very fpacious beef market is ereded on the 
eaft fide of that ftreet, the ftalls of which are under roofed 
pillars, having in the centre a large paved area opeti 
above.— On the oppofite fide of the ftreet there are fimilar 
buildings, part of which are ufed as a mutton market, and 
the reft as markets for fifti, potatoes, butter and cheefe.— 
The flefti markets being now found too fmall for th? fupply. 
of the inhabitants, the Magiftrates and Council propofe to 
remove the potatoe, cheefe and butter markets to a fitua- 
• tionj behind the weigh-houfe, where fuitable accommoda-. 
tionsare to be made for them, and to appropriate the whol« 
of the markets in King ftreet for flefti markets.— There is 
alfo a very commodious market for the difpofal of garden 
ftr.fFs, the confumption of which is very confiderabiy m- 
creafed v/ithin thefe few years. '■ 

Among

Statijlkal Account 



Among the improvements propofed at prefent in the 
city, we may mention that of building barracks for the 
accommodation of the military ftatioued here. — Thefe have 
hitherto, from the peculiar circumftances of the law ia 
this country, been quartered among the loweft fet of the 
inhabitants and in a large and populous city, not being 
under the immediate eye of their officers, have occafioned 
much iiregularity and many inconveiuencies, both to them- 
felves and the citizens. — It is much to be wiftied, that the 
fcheme, at prefent in agitation by the Magiftrates, may be 
accomplilhed ; as it will tend much not only to the com- 
fort of the military, but to the eafe of the inhabitants. 



VI. The Church. 

. It has been already mentioned, that Glafgow becanie at 
a very early period, the feat of a religious eftablifli- 
ment. From the time of Kentigern to the Reformation, 
an almoft uninterrupted fucceffion of bifliops, and latterly 
of archbifhops, continued to prefide in this fee. Upon the 
Reformation, one minifter, who was fuperintendant of the 
weft of Scotland, officiated in Glafgow, and had the pa- 
ftoral charge oi its inhabitants. The feffion of Glafgow 
was regularly conftituted, of one minifter, 35 elders, and 
16 deacons, on the 7th November 1583.. At this period, 
and for a long time fubfequent, the feffion was affifted in 
judging of matters of fcandal, by an inqjieft fummoned 
from the neighbourhood. As late as May 1622, this inqueft 
was fummoned, for the purpofe of trying the behaviour 
and life of John Baillie and Agnes Wilfon. In 1635 
public worfliip was performed in three different churches^ 
the High Church, the Tron Church and the Bfeck Friars 
Church ; and the fame number continued till after the Re- 

rolutiott. 



of Glafgow. 

roiutidn.— In 169 1 a fourth was added.— Glafgow, though 
originally only one pariJfli, was afterwards, for the benefit of 
the poor, and eafe of the minifters, divided into 7, and late- 
ly into 8 pariihes •, which is the number of the churches, in 
which public worlhip is performed by minifters of the 
Prefbyterian eftablifhment. The churches are, the Inner 
Hic^h Church, the Outer High Church, the Tron Church, 
the'' College Church, the Wynd Church, fhe North Weit 
Church, St Andrew's Church, and St Enoch's Church. 
The minifters are, in the fame order,— Dr WilliaTn Baylor, 
Mr Robert Balfour, Dr Joh?t Maccaull, Dr John Gillies, 
Dr William Porteous, Mr Alexander Rankin, Bx IVilliam 
Lockhart, and Mr William Baylor. 

Thefe ecclefiaftical charges are all, except the Inner High 
Church, under the patronage of the Town Council. The 
ftipend of each of the minifters was at firft L. 90, which 
in 1723, was, augmented to 2000 merles, in 176a to 250a 
merks, and in 1788 to L. 165, without manfe or glebe. 
The Inner High Church is under the patronage of the 
Crown, and its minifter enjoys a glebe. 

Befides the above churches, there are alfo three chapels 
of eafe, -under the infpeftion of the Prefbytery of Glafgow. 
The College Chapel, in which divine fervice is ordinarily 
performed by preachers, or licentiates in divinity. The 
free Preibyterian meeting-houfe, formerly connefted with 
the Prelbytery of Relief, but reftored to the communion of 
the Eftablifhed Church in 1774. This congregation is ve- 
ry numerous, and divine fervice is at prefent performed in 
it, by Meffrs John Macleod and Archibald W illiamfon, with 
falaries, the former of L. 100, the latter of L. 70 Sterling- 
There is alfo a Gaelic chapel, in which the fervice is per- 
formed partly in Gaelic, partly in Englifli, by Mr An^vs 
Madintojh, with a ftipend of L. 113 yearly. 

Befides 



5i8 



Statijlical Account 



Befides thefe houfes and eflablifliments for the exercife of 
the public ordinances of religion, agreeable to the infti- 
tutions of the Church of Scotland, there are. various o- 
Iher places of worfhip, occupied by Diffenters. There are 
two Burgher and one Antiburgher meeting-houfes ; an 
Englifli chapel, with two officiating clergymen •, a place of 
worfliip belonging to a congregation of Independents j one 
or perhaps two for Anabaptifts ; one for Glaffites ; a large 
Methodift meeting-houfe, the congregation of which are 
not at prefent on the increafe; two large houfes and two con- 
gregations of the Relief communion ; befides a large church 
in Anderfton, another in the Caltoun, and a Popifti meeting, 
which is conduced with fuch difcretion, that it cannot give 
the flighteft caufe of offence. 



VII. Charitable Institutions. 

Before the Reformation, almoft every charitable dona- 
tion was vefted in the church •, and its revenues, together 
with thofe charities, whofe object went no higher than the 
prefervation of life, were difpenfed by the clergy. Cha- 
rities of a higher order, which regard the charader and 
former fituation of their objefts, were fcarcely known, ex- 
cept by their hofpitality \ and when the church was over- 
turned by the Reformation, the facrilegious rapacity, which 
accompanied it, feized on every thing within its reach, lea- 
X-^ing very few remains of ancient beneficence. 

St Nicholas Hojpital. — Of all the charitable inflitutions, 
connected with the Roman Catholic cathedral of Glafgow, 
none has defcended to the prefent time, except St Nicholas 
hofpital, founded by Bifhop Muirhead, about the middle of 
the 15th century, for the maintenance of 12 old men and 
a prieft j but its revenue has been almoft entirely dilapida- 
ted. 



of Glafgow. 



red, and even now, after the greateft efForts, yields little 
more than L. 2C a-jear. 

Merchants Hofpital- — It is not known, at v/hat time the 
..erchants of Glafgow firft formed themfelves into a focie- 
V, but that they had an hofpital for the relief of their poor, 
,'revious to the year 1605, is evident from the letter of 
Guildry. Neither can it now be afcertained, what were 
die funds of the fociety at that time •, but, in the year 1659, 
this hofpital, beins foimd to be in a decayed' condition, was 
»rreed to be taken down, rebuilt, and enlarged ; which was 
accordingly done, and the expence chiefly defrayed by 
contributions from the members. The ftock, at that time, 
feems to have been about L. 2000, but has now arifen, 
from payments by the members, and from mortifications, 
to above L. 17,000. Their revenue is at prefent above 
L. icoo per annum, part of which is employed for particu- 
'ar purpoles, exprefsly fpecified by the mortifiers ; and the 
eft is applied for the relief of decayed members, their wi- 
.'ows and defcendants. 

Trades Hofpital. — The Trades Hofpital alfo exifted be- 
fore 1605, and its funds have increafed in the fame manner. 
The prefent revenue exceeds L. 500, and arifes from the in- 
terell of their ftock, and rents of houfes ; together with fome 
annual payments from the 14 incorporations, each of whom 
have a certain number of poor people fupported by it. 

Incorporations. — The different incorporations have alfo 
each of them a revenue and fund of their own, diftindl 
from the general fund, which is deftined for the fupport of 
decayed member-s, their widows, and children. And in 
the fame manner, the Faculty of Phyficians and Surgeons, 
cftabliftied by charter in 1559, and the Faculty of Procura- 
tors, have each confiderable funds for the fame purpofes. 

Hutchefon's Hofpital. — Hutchefon's Hofpital was founded 
))j George Plutchefon of Lambhill, in the year 1639, and 

farther 



5^* Statijlical Account 

farther endowed by his brother Thomas, in the year 1641 
for the fupport originally 01 12 old men and 12 boys. The 
patrons of this hofjiital are a Preceptor, the Magiftrates and 
Council, and minifters of the city, and, from their good 
management, and various donations which the hofpital lias 
received, the funds have increafed very confiderably ; 
that the annual income is now above L. ijoo; which is em. 
ployed fo as to have the leaft poffible bad influence on the 
induftry of the people, by following out the intentions of 
the founders, in fupporting old men, who have been of cha- 
rafter dnd credit in the city, by giving them penfions from 
L. 5 to L. ao per annum. And of late years the charity 
has been extended to women of the fame defcription, in 
penfions of from L. 5 to L. 15. A part of it has alfo been al- 
lotted, to give clothing and a penfion of L. 3 per annurn, to a 
number of boys for 4 years; during which time they receive 
a complete education in reading, writing, and common arith- 
metic i after which they are bound apprentices to different 
trades. 

Town's Hofpital.— Th&amp; Town's hofpital, or Poor's Houfe, 
was founded in the year 1730. It was intended to main- 
tain and give good education to orphans, or thofe who were 
left deftitute, to aiford an afylum to the old, and to promote 
the beft interefts of all, in the cheapeft poffible manner. 
The fixed revenue of this hofpital is.

In this hofpital the poor are well lodged, cloathed, and

inftrufted in the principles of religion, in reading Englifh, 
and a little writing ; and are employed in fuch labour as is 
fitted for them, as making thre'ad lace, tambouring muflins, 
fetting card teeth, &amp;c. The old women are employed in 
fpinning, cleaning the houfe, and, as far as they can, doing 
the work of the family. Some of the old men weave, and 
others are employed in fuch bufinefs as they can perform. 

The hofpital alfo contains a fmall infirmary, where the 
fick are accommodated with medical alTiftarice, and where 
operations are performed when necefiTary ; and it has alfo a 
number of cells for the reception of infane perfons. The 
whole is vifited in rotation, and a written report figned 5 
days in each week, by one of the directors, who are an- 
nually appointed, and of whom 8, with the preceptor, lit

gy: — 8. The Humane Society, eftabliftied in 1790, on the 
fame principles with the one in London, for recovering 
perfons fuppofed to be drowned :— 9. Coulter's Mortifica- 
tion, 1790, of L. 1200, the intereft of which is to be ap- 
plied, for the relief of perfons who had been in a refpe£la- 
ble fituation in life : — 10. The Society for the Relief of Sick 
Strangers, begun in 1791, and fupported by fubfcriptions : 
— II. Stirling's Mortification, in 1791, of L. 20CO, as a 
fund for beginning a public library, which is now increa- 
ling very confiderably by fubfcriptions. 

There is alfo an Infirmary begun upon an extenlive 
plan, towards eredling which, fuch a fum is already fub- 
fcribed, as has induced the managers to begin it. The 
plan of the building is by the late Mr Adams ; and there 
is little doubt, but that this benevolent inftitution will be 
fupported by fuch future, fubfcriptions, as will render it of 
general utility to the weft country. 

Independent of thefe public charities, there are in Glaf- 
gow a number of focieties, known by the name of Friend- 
ly Societies, inftituted for the purpofe of fupporting their 
members when in dlftrefs. Thefe arofe vv'ith the manu- 
failures, and have advanced and increafed along with 
them ; and in thefe, we may trace with pleafure, the va- 
rious connexions of fociety, leading men into the field- of 

benevolence.

benevolence, and engaging in a mutual infurance againft 
poverty. Perfons either of the fame ntune, or conaing from 
the fame county, or. employed in the fame trade, or living 
in particular fb-eets of the city, or having been in fimilar 
lituations, are affociated together ; and by weekly or 
monthly payments, amounting to about 4 s. in the year, 
create a fund and revenue, out of which their wants are 
fupplied, when they are dilabled from attending to their 
ordinary occupations, either by occalional diftrefs, or the 
infirmities of age ; and this as a fight, and without the 
humiliating idea, that they are receiving charity. 

The frugality and good fenfe, with which thefe focieties 
are generally managed, deferves a more particular expla- 
nation. When any of their members are fick, or other- 
wife difabled, they are vifited by fome of the fociety, 
accompanied by a furgeon". If the difeafe is pretended, 
or brought on by debauchery, they are not found entitled 
to the' filpply ; but if the cafe is real, they report. :w hi- 
ther the patient is confined to his bed, or otherwife in- 
capable of working. If he is confined to bedv tli£y or- 
der the higheft provifibn that their regulations allow, 
which in moft cafes amounts to 5 s; a-^week, and whidi 
is inftantly and regularly paid, during the"'-'time he con- 
tinues in that fituation. If the patient is not confined to 
.bed, a lower provifion is ordei-ed, agreeable to the nature 
of the cafe, and which is commonly from 2 s, 6 d. to 4 s. 
per week.- At the expence of the fociety, he is vifited by 
a furgeon while neceffary, and afterwards during his con- 
valefcence, by fome of the niembers who have the charge 
of that department, and who regularly report his fituation to 
the fociety ; and as foon as he is able to work, the weekly 
payment is withdrawn. In fome of thefe focieties, a cer- 
tain fum is allowed to defray the funeral of a poor mem- 
ber, and a fam is given to his widow on his deceafc. 

Thofc

Thofc, who incline, may become members of more than 
one fociety, and when they are in diftrefs, they receive 
the ftipulated fnpport from each ; fo that a perfon, who 
chufes to fpare a little money, in the time of health, has 
the pleafure of feeing plenty in his family, when he is no 
longer able to provide for them. Thefe focieties feem to 
be the beft fupport, for the relief of the work people in a 
manufa£turing country, as it makes them look forv/ard In 
time of health and profperity, to the calamities and mif- 
fortunes which are fo incident to human life ; and by ap- 
propriating a part of their earnings, which they can then 
eafily fpare, affords them the fatisfadion of knowing they 
will be fupported, when reduced by ficknefs or old age, to 
be unable to work for themfclves, Without the humiliating 
tieceffity of fupplicating the charity of the benevolent, or 
being a burden on their friends.— Befides, this method of 
fupport is no bar to induftry, which many of the charita- 
ble inftitutions of this country has been reproached with, 
as it holds up no certain fubfiftence for the idle or the 
profligate •, and by fupporting the induftrious tradefman in 
the midft of his family, does not loofen the bands of natu- 
ral affeaion, or take him out of the world, and the fo-

VIII. Education. 



As Scotland has been always honourably diftlnguiaied, 
by the f perior education of the lower clafles of her in- 
habitants, fo this important article has had confiderable at- 
tention paid to it in Glafgow, by inftitutions of various 
kinds 5 many of which, at the fame time that they provide 
for the inftruaion of the youth, alfo provide for their com- 
fortable clothing.

gets them into fervice. — The Highland Society clothe a- 
bout 60 boys annually, binding them apprentices to trades, 
and attending to their education during their apprenticq- 
iliip. 

Mr IVilfon of London, who formerly had gone from this 
city, imprefled with the advantages of education to the 
lower clafs of people, in 1778, mortified L. 3000 for the 
purpofe of educating and clothing boys. This fund has 
been augmented by fundry doYiations from other perfons, 
and now educates 48 boys, who, at the end of 4 years, 
are alfo completely clothed, and bound apprentices 
to trades. — Befides thefe, Crawford's School gives e-du- 
cation to 48 boys and girls, Tennent's to 96, and Bax- 
ter's to 48, though without clothing. — There are alfo, of 
late, fome fchools fet apart for girls, fuch as Lennox's 
fchool, which educates 48, and Peadie's, which educates 
about 30, in reading, fewing and knitting. — A fund of a- 
bove L. 7000, has likewife been lately left by Mr "Ar- 
chibald Millar, for educating and clothing girls in a gen- 
teel way during a courfe of 5 years. — A neat fchool-houfe 
is now building for that purpofe, where it is propofed to 
inftruft them in every branch of education fuited to their 
ftation. 

To all thefe, are to be added 1 1 Sunday Schools, which 
were begun in 1787, and have fince been fupported by 
voluntary fubfcriptions, intended to preferve the educa- 
tion formerly given, to increafe knowledge, and to form 
good habits, in which fchools there are at prefent about 
640 boys and girls. So that there are thus about 1200 
children, regularly educated in fuch branches as are proper 
for them, without any expence to their parents. — At the 
fame time, the children of fuch as are able to afford them 
education, are, in general, not negleded, as the prefbytery 
of Glafgow, having a few years ago ordered all the fchools 
Vol. V. 3 X withiix

within their jurifdiftion, to be vifited by fome of their 
members, they found in tliis city above 60 fchools, in 
"which the mafters were entirely fiipported by fchool wa- 
ges, from 5 s. to I s. 6 d. the quarter. In the greater pare 
of thefe, nothing was taught but reading Englilh, the Ca- 
techifm, and perhaps a little writing. It may be proper 
here to obferve, that in the prefent ftate of this city, it is 
of the greateft importance to prevail on parents, to fend 
their children to fchool at 6 years of age ; for if their edu- 
cation is then negledled, it is in great danger of being loft 
for ever. The manufaftures find employment for chil- 
dren between 7 and 8 years of age, and even then their 

work will bring from i s. to i s. 6d. per week.. This 

becomes a temptation fcarce to be refifted by poor fami- 
lies. — The only method, therefore, by which the educa- 
tion of the poor can be fecured, is by giving it early, and 
fupporting the Sunday fchools, which may prevent fuch e- 
ducation as they have got being loft. 

"With regard to the education of the higher claffes of the 
inhabitants, there are many public teachers of the living 
languages, Writing, Arithmetic, Book-keeping, Mathema- 
tics, &amp;c. whofe fees are generally from 5 s, to 10 s. 6 d. 
the quarter, and fome of them confiderably higher. 

Be fides a confiderable number of private fchooL, in 
which the Latin language is taught, a very elegant build- 
ing has lately been erefted for the public grammar fchool, 
in which the courfe of education is 4 years, and is conduc- 
ed by 4 matters, who each carry on their claffes the whole- 
time, having equal falaries of L. 25 each for the three firft 
years, and L. 35 for the fourth year. Each fcholar pays 
5 s. per quarter, befides a prefent at Candlemas ; and for 
fome years each of the claffes has generally confifted of 
from 80 to 100 fcholars. Great care has been taken in 
the choice of the matters, both as to their worth and pro- 
feffional abilities. To this, and to the great attention, 



of Glafgow. 



.531 



which has for fome years been beftovved on it by the 
Town-council, is the flour ilhing ftate of the fchool to be a- 
fcribed. A committee of gentlemen of the Council are 
chofen annually, who take the fuperintendance of it, and 
who, with the advice of the Profeffors of the Univerfity, 
fettle the plan of reading, &amp;c. in the different clalTcs ; and 
along with them the minifters, and other perfons of learn- 
ing vifit the fchool frequently, without giving any previous 
notice. At thefe vifitations, the fcholars go through their 
different exercifes, and the particular ftanding of each boy in 
the clafs is marked down in a book ; and at the end of each 
feafon, when there is a public examination, before the Ma- 
giftrates, the gentlemen of the college, and many of the in- 
habitants, prizes are diftributed to the boys, not according 
to the fituation in which they may be accidentally found at 
that time, but according to the average of their places at 
the different examinations through the year ; and this prac- 
tice has been found to have a very good effea, by keeping 
up the attention of both matters and fcholars through the 
whole courfe of the feafon. Prizes are alfo given for good 
attendance, in order to form habits of attention, which may- 
be ufeful to them in their after life, in whatever fituation 
they may be placed. 



IX. Miscellaneous Observations. 

The AIR, though very healthy, is moift, when compared 
with the eaft coaft of Scotland and England, but not fo 
much as thofe places which lie nearer the Weftern Ocean, 
or as Lancalhire and Cornwall. The average of rain, 
which has fallen in the city of Glafgow for 30 years, from 
1761 to 1790 inclufive, is 29 inches ^-^-^ parts. The 
greateft quantity in any year during that period, was in 



53^ 



Statijlical Account 



the year 1775, which was 43 inches ; and the leaft 
quantity was in the year 1788, which was 19 inches 
parts. 

April 7. 1653. A. mod affeftlng and even elegant repre- 
fentation to the public, was made by the citizens of Glaf- 
gow, fetting forth the diftrefs occafioned by an accidental 
fire on the 17th June 1652, which had confumed one third 
part of their city, confifting of the dwellings of almoft 
1000 families. This is certified by Oliver Cromwell, Ge- 
neral Lambert, and 22 other perfons of rank, where the 
lofs is eftimated at L. 1 00,000 *. 

The moft remarkable flood, that has been in the river, 
was on the 12th March 1782, when it rofe about 20 feet 
above its ufual level, by which all the lower part of the town 
was laid under water, and many of the inhabitants obliged 
to be carried out of their houfes in boats. This flood was 
18 inches higher than in 1712, at which time it was higher 
than had ever been remembered. 

The GROUNDS in the neighbourhood are highly cultiva- 
ted, but, from the great increafe of inhabitants, owing to 
the numerous manufadlures now eftabliflied, the quantity of 
grain raifed is not nearly fufficient for the fupply of the in- 
habitants ; and therefore they are almoft always obliged to 
depend upon fupplies from other parts, which they get by 
the river Clyde from Ireland, and by the great Canal 
from the eaftern parts of the ifland. 

There is great plenty of freestone of different qualities, 
and of whin, in the neighbourhood ; but no marble, lime- 
ftone, flate, or granite, in any quantity, within fome miles. 
There is alfo plenty of clays proper for making bricks, 
tiles, and the common kinds of pottery, but none of the 
finer kinds. — The foffil to which this city owes its greateft 
advantage is coal, which is found in great abundance in 

the 



* VideGMoru 



of Glafgow. 533 



tlie ground toward the eaft j in which there are five different 
ftrata, or feams, from 3 to 4^ feet thick, all of which 
are wrought at prefent to a very confiderable extent. 
Thefe feams have been wrought for many years, fo that 
all near the city, at a moderate depth, has been dugout. 
Some of the pits are at prefent above 60 fathoms deep, and 
moft of them are obUged to be wrought by the affiftance of 
fleam engines. The price of coals varies at the different 
pits, being from 2 s. 9 d. to 3 s. 3 d. per cart, of 12 cwt. ; 
when delivered in any part of the city, from 3 s. 6 d. to 
4 s. In fome of thefe pits, there is a vein of iron ftoneof 
very good quality, of a whitifli colour, which is ufed in the 
fmelting furnaces in the neighbourhood, There is alfo in 
the tiU found in thefe pits, many impreffions of fern and 
other plants, and fliells of different kinds ; and in the neigh- 
bourhood there are many foffile marine bodies, particularly 
different fpecies of fliells and entrochi. 

The WATER, with which the city is in general fupplied, 
is not of the beft quality, as moft of the fprings contain fe- 
lenite in greater or leffer proportion ; and fome of them 
contain iron, which is for the moft part fufpended by the 
carbonic acid. One fpring, not far from the city, contains 
calcareous earth, which it depofits, in its courfe^ on the ve- 
getables, i^c. forming therewith fundry incruftations. To- 
wards the weft part of the city, however, the water is much 
purer than towards the eaft ; and there is in the Green, be- 
longing to the community, a fpring of water of the very 
beft quality in the country. The quantity of it, however, is 
not fufiicient to afford a fupply to the whole inhabitants ; 
and it lies fo much below the level of the greateft part of 
the city, that it has prevented its being conduded into it. 
Many propofals have been made, for fupplying the city 
with water from fources in the neighbourhood, but the 

quantity 



534 



Stati/lical Account 



quantity of fpring water, to be found in any one place, has 
been thought too fmall to fupply the wants of the inhabi- 
tants ; befides, a very great expence muft be incurred in 
conveying it into the city, and in preparing rcfervoirs for it, 
which has hitherto prevented this ufeful fcheme being put 
in execution. Perhaps the only permanent fources, and 
the beft fupply in point of purity, would be from the ri- 
ver Clyde ; but this would ojcafion it to be forced up by a 
fteam engine, and a large refervoir to collet it in, in order 
to fupply the pipes neceffary for the different parts of the 
city; which would be fuch an expence as could not be gone 
into, without a probability of being reimburfed by a tax, 
which would not, perhaps, be an agreeable meafure. 

As to the MANNERS of the people in general, they are, 
for the moft part, induftrious, and Jlill oeconomical. They 
are in general contented and happy in their fituation. They 
grumble at taxes, and the high price of provifions ; and^ 
fome of the more ambitious wilh for fome more political con- 
fequence, than they at prefent enjoy, under the laws of the 
Scottifli burghs ; which they confider as confining the pre- 
fentation of minifters, and the power of eledion and offices 
to a few, in exclufion of the reft, and thefe they wifli to 
have put on a broader bottom. As they are getting rich, 
this defire will increafe among the people ; yet, notwith- 
ftanding, there is at prefent much difficulty to get proper 
perfons, of the merchant rank, to accept of the offices of 
councillors and magiftrates, almoft every year furnifliing 
inftances of their paying a fine rather than ferve. 

Riches in Glafgow were formerly the portion of a few 
merchants. Thefe, from the influence of the manufaftures, 
are now diffufing themfelves widely among a great num' 
ber of manufadlurers, mechanics, and artifans. This has 
made an alteration in the houfes, drefs, furniture, education 
and amufements of the people of Glafgow within a few 

years. 



of Glafgow. 535 

years, which is aftonifhing to the older inhabitants •■, and has 
been followed by a proportional alteration in the manners, 
cuftoms, and ftile of living of the inhabitants. And 
as many of the merchants have of late years been en- 
gaging in manufaaures and trade, the diftance in point of 
rank and confequence, between merchants and tradefmen, 
has now become lefs confpicuous, than it was before the 

American- war. 

The ftriftfe verity and apparent fanftity of manners, for- 
merly remarkable here, have yielded to theoppofite extreme. 
There is now a great deal more induftry on fix days of the 
week, and a great deal more difllpation and licentioufneCs 
on the feventh. Great crimes were formerly very uncom- 
mon; but now robberies, houfebreakings, fwindling, pick- 
pockets, pilferers, and confequently executions are become 
more common. Thefe delinquents, as well as common 
proftitutes, are often little advanced above childhood; and 
yet a healthy child of 7 or 8 years, or at moft of 10 years 
of age, can now earn a very decent fubfiftence from fome of 
the numerous manufa£h.\res eftablifhed among us. 

In an account of a city like Glafgow, a defcription of A- 
NIMALS is not expefted; it may not be improper, however, 
to give a lift of the different kinds of Fish, which arc 
found in the river and frith of Clyde, though it is not gi- 
ven as complete, as many other kinds m^y ftill be found.

P\A.R1SH OF THE <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3643362">GORBALS of GLASGOW</name>, 



(county of LANARK.) 
By the Rev. Mr William Anderson.</head> 



<p>Name, Ere£iion, Extent, i^c. 

THE Gorhals of Glafgow was disjoined from the parifh 
of Govan, and erefted into a feparate parifli the dill 
of February 1 77 1. The ancient name of the village was 
Bridge-end. Its modern name is the Gorhals of Glafgow. 
The village and burying ground only were at firft ere£ted 
into a new parifh, containing about 12 or 14 acres. The 
lands of Rea, of Little Govan, and Polmadie, containing 
about 500 or 600 acres, and the barony of Gorbals, be- 
longing to the city of Glafgow, the patrons of Hutchifon's 
hofpital, and the Trades-Houfe of Glafgow, (containing 
upwards of 400 acres,) were afterwards, at the defire of 
the inhabitants of thefe lands, annexed to the parifli of 
Gorbals by th« prelbytery of Glafgow. 



Climate, 



54® Statijlical Account 

Climate, Floods, and ProfpeBs. —Th^ air is rather moift- 
the country flat, with a very fmall rife for fome miles ; the 
difeafes are confumptions and fevers, tending to putrid. The 
tide nfes fome miles above the place, or at leaft forces 
back the water of the river ; and the water itfelf fometimes 
taftes fait or brakifti. The village and lands near the river 
ate fubjea to inundations, but they are feldom great. 
There have been two remarkable floods, however, in the 
years 1712 and 1782. On the lath March 1782, boats 
might have failed through many ftreets in Gorbals, as they 
really did on that occafion in the Bridgegate of Glafgow. 
The whole ground appeared fea for a mile weft, and about an 
eighth of a mile from the river, a fmall ifland appearing a- 
bout the fouth end of the church, and the field weft from 
it. The church was filled with water, except about 3 pews 
in the fouth end.— There are a variety of profpefts from 
Gorbals ; as Langred, (where the battle between Queen 
Mary and the^ Barons was fought, about two miles fouth), 
the Ifle of Arran, Paifley, the windings of the river Clyde' 
Benlomond, which often appears with a fnowy top when 
the feafon is advanced, and Tintock, from above Lanark. 

Refit, Soil, and Minerals. — The ground rents high, being 
fet for 19 years paft, from L. 3 to L. j an acre ; the foil is va- 
rious, fome of it a black ftrong loam, others a rich clay, and 
much of it, where the Gorbals is fituated, fand fome fathoms 
deep, little more than 9 inches foil on the furface. It abounds 
with coal. The Go van colliery has two excellent machines, 
the one for drawing up the water, the other a fteam-engine 
for bringing up coals 100 fathoms, which faves a number of 
horfe. There are 3 feams of coal, the undermoft 14 feet 
thick, It is thought that there is fuch a quantity of coals 
in the colliery, (which belongs to Dunlop and Houfton,) as

would of itfelf ferve the city of Glafgow for ico years to 
come. Upwards of 200 men are employed about it. 

Church, l^c. — The parifli belongs to the preibytery of 
Glafgow, and Synod of Glafgow and Ayr. The ftipend is 
exaftly L 100, befides L. 6 for communion elements furnifli- 
ed twice a-year. There is neither manfe nor glebe. The 
village and barony of Gorbals, iii the year 15 71, were 
feued by George Elphinllon, merchant in Glafgow, from 
Archbilhop Porterfield. There has been a burying-ground 
eaftward from the fouth end of the old Bridge, called the 
Leper's Cmirch-yard ; and there is an old building, about 
the middle of the village, on the eaft lide, called the Chapel. 
The lower part of it is at prefent occupied as the parifli 
fchool ; the two upper ftories are ufed as a prifon. On fe- 
veral places of the roof there are three capital letters, 
S. G. E. being the initials of Sir George Elphinjion. The 
chapel of Gorbals was under the patronage of St Ninian, 
and the Leper's Houfe was founded and endued by a lady, 
of the name of Campbell, about the year 1350. There 
was formerly a prebend of Polmadie *, and there ftill re- 
main fome veftiges of religious houfes in the neighbourhood. 
It is probable that the bifliop or archbilhop might have had 
his country feat there, as the ground is exceeding good, and 
the lituation pleafant, 

Schqols and Poor. — The public fchool is good, and coil-- 
tains upwards of 100 fcholars, the emoluments may be a- 
bout L. 8o/)er annum. There are other five fchools, at 
each of which there will be upwards of 30 fcholars. — The 
poor are numerous, and are fupp'orted by the coUedions 

made

made at the church door. There are alfo five fociety boxes 
amongft the different trades, which may give their poor a- 
bout L. loo a-year. The people in general are very cha- 
ritable, and the paridi would maintain their own poor, and 
prevent begging, were it not fome of the poor people who 
lodge for a penny a-night, wandering beggars, who hang 
about the avenues to the city, and give out that they live 
in the Gorbals. 

Population,— The village, it is faid, about the beginning 
of this century, confifled only of a few thatched houfes on 
each fide of the great road from the fouth end of the old 
bridge. Thefe were moftly polTeffed by maltmen, who 
made malt and brewed ale. In the year 1730 it was much 
increafed, the intermediate fpaces betwixt the old houfes 
being filled up with houfes occupied by weavers. In the 
1732, the prefent church was built, as a Chapel of Eafe to 
Govan. In the year 1748, the greateft part of the village 
was burnt, after which it rapidly increafed. The houfes 
built were good, fome of them confifting of 2, and others 
of 3 ftories and garrets. In 1771, the village was compu- 
ted to contain 30CO perfons, befides 500 more connefted 
quoad facra. The village at prefent conlifts of upwards 
of 5000 fouls, befides about 800 who are joined quoad 
facra. Within three years, it is expeaed, the number 
will be doubled, and in 20 years a new Glafgow will 
probably be raifed on the fouth fide of the Clyde, It is 
impoffible to afcertain either the births or burials 
precifely, as the inhabitants of Glafgow both baptife 
and bury in the Gorbals, and thofe of Gorbals in the city. 
There are at leaft above 200 baptifms in the year. The 
people are induftrious ; there are feveral reputable manufac- 
turers, and many good operative weavers ; there are 555 
looms, befides a number of gunfmiths, nailers, flioemakers,

will contain upwards of 50,000 inhabitants. The feuing

PARISH OF NEW <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1786145">PORT-GLASGOW</name>, 



(county of RENFREW.) 



By the Rev. Mr John Forrest.</head> 



<p>Nafne and Ere&amp;ion. 

NEW Port-Glafgow is a modern parifh. The ancient 
name of the place, which was only a fmall vil- 
lage, was Newark, fo called from a gentleman's feat of 
that name, which lay contiguous to it. It was formerly a 
part of the parlfli of Kilmalcolm ; but the Magiftrates and 
Qouncil of Glafgow having, in the year 1668, fued about 
II acres of land adjoining to the old village, upon which 
they erefted an harbour for the accommodation of their 
fliipping ; and forefeeing that it was likely foon to become 
a populous place, and, perhaps, as an encouragement to its 
more fpeedy population, they applied, with the concurrence 
of all concerned, to the Lords^of Plantation gf Kirks, and got

it, together with a few farms in its immediate vicinity, e- 
refted into a feparate parifli in the year 1695, by the name 
of Nexv Port-Glafgow, i. e. the new port of Glafgow, by 
which name it has been invariably known ever fince. 

Situation, Extent, Soil, and Surface.— Th\s parifli is fitua- 
ted within the bovmds of the prefljytery of Paifley, and 
Synod of Glafgow and Ayr. It is nearly an Englifh mile 
fquare— The land in this parifli is partly flat and partly 
mountainous. Along the coaft, and for about 130 yards 
back, it is nearly a dead level, little higher than the high 
water mark. This flat part, except that on which the 
town ftands, is at prefent entirely converted into garden 
ground, belonging to the inhabitants, who fued it from the 
proprietor of the lands in the parifli ; and although the foil 
was originally barren, and in fome places very fliallow, yet 
it is aftonifliing what happy effeds cultivation has produ- 
ced •, all kinds of pot herbs and common fruits, both fmall 
and 'big, being now raifed here, of the richeft quality, and 
in the greateft abundance. Immediately behind the flat 
part of the parifli, there are mountains confiderably lleep 
and high, moftly of a poor foil, a fmall part of which is in 
tillage, and the refl: in pafture. 

Climate, ^r.— The air of the parifli is moift, owing, it 
is fuppofed, to its vicinity to the river Clyde, to the many 
lochs, which lie between the mountains on the oppofite coafl: 
of Argylefliire, and to the peninfular form of this weft 
country in general. Upon a comparifon, between the rope- 
work books of this place and thofe of Glafgow, when^ that 
branch of manufaaure was carried on in the open air, it has 
been found, that the inhabitants of the former place have, 
at an average, about 14 days more rain in the year, than 
thofe of the latter. Notwithftanding this, New Port-

Statijlical Account 



Glafgow is a very healthy place. It has no diftempers 
pecuUar to it, and it has frequently been remarked, that 
the wetter the weather is, the healthier the inhabitants are. 

Coajl — The fliore, as f^r as the parifh extends, is flat 
and fandy, with fome loofe ftones fcattered here and there, 
except the fpot oppofite to the old houfe or caftle of Newark, 
which ftands upon a prominent part of the land ; where the 
ihore, for about 150 yards, is very fteep, being almoft up- 
on the brink of the deepeft part of the river, or the Channel, 
as they call it. The common Sea- weed is cafl afhore in' 
this parifh ; and though the water, in which it grows, be 
only brakilh, or half fait and half frefh, yet it is faid to be 
very good manure, at leaft, for one crop. The farmers 
here, however, pay little attention to it. This negleft 
feems to be owing to two cifcumftances ; the one is, that 
the farmers depend chiefly upon the produce of their cows 
for the payment of their rents ; and the other is, that all 
the farms are fituated in the mountainous part of the parifli, 
which renders accefs to them, from the fliore with carriages, 
very difficult and expenfive. 

River, Fijh, and Birds. — The river Clyde, oppofite to 
this parifh, is fuppofed to be about two miles broad, but it 
is only a fmall part of it that is navigable by vefTels of bur- 
den. This part, commonly called the Channel, lies along the 
New Port-Glafgow Ihore, is about 200 yards broad at an 
average, and is every where fo deep at high water, that the 
largeft veffels^ which enter the frith of Clyde, can eafily be 
moored in the harbour, without difcharging any part of 
their cargo. The tide rifes here about 9 feet at an average. 
There are fome fmall cod and haddocks in the river, oppo- 
fite to this parifh, but they are not in fuch quantities as to 
render it worth any one's while to make a trade of fifhing.

The boys frequently catch them for their amufement. 
There are alfo occafional vifits of the herrings. Thefe vi- 
fits, however, are rare, having happened only thrice during 
the prefent century, vi'Z. in the years 1718, 1753, and 
1786, continuing commonly twd or three feafons at each 
vifit. No migratory birds are feen on this eoaft, except 
thofe which are common to the whole ifland, unlefs fome fea- 
fowls of the duck kind are to be reckoned among the num- 
ber. When there happens to be a hard froft in the depth 
of winter, thefe never fail to vifit this part of the river in 
immenfe flocks. Thoufands, nay millions of them have 
been feen at once but when the froil: breaks, they inftant- 
ly difappear, and are feen no more till the next froft comes. 
As the two laft winters have been very mild, there have 
been few or none of thefe vifitors. 

Population.-^ Ah6\xt the time that New Port-Glafgow 
was erefted into a parilh, the number of its inhabitants muft 
have been fmall. Though the writer of this paper be not 
poffeffed of materials, fufficient to enable him to afcertain, 
with precifion, what that number was, yef, from tradition- 
al report, as well as from an old regifter of births and 
marriages, now in his hands, it would feem, that, before 
the commencement of the prefent century, the number of 
inhabitants did not exceed 350, or 400 at moft. From the 
year 1700 it gradually increafed, till the year 1718, when 
the prefent parith kirk was built. At this laft period, the 
nuinber of inhabitants could fcarcely have amounted to 
800, as the kirk can hardly contain that number. From 
the year 17 18 it had, in like manner, gradually increafed 
till the year 1775, when the prefent incumbent was ordain- 
dd. If it be true, as is generally underftood, that the po- 
pulation of a parifti may be known with fufficient accuracy, 
by multiplying the number of births ij 26, the ftate of

the population of this parifli, in fome of the intermediate

From the year 1775, to the year 1783, the population of 
this parifh was ftationary.. The caufe of this was undoubt- 
edly the American war. There is not, perhaps, a port in 
Britain, upon which that event had a more immediate in- 
fluence, tlian upon this port. In confequence of it, together 
with fome incidental circumftances, (the enumeration of 
which does not belong to the writer of this paper), Glaf- 
gow, upon which the people here chiefly depended hither- 
to, became no longer a commercial, but a manufafturing 
city, and confequently was no longer the immediate fource 
of wealth to them ; and their own internal vigour not be- 
ing yet fufficiently roufed for their fupport, their number 
could not increafe, as it had done for near a century 
before ; but muft have inevitably taken a contrary diredlion 
in due time, if, during the war, and efpecially about the 
conclulion of it, a fpirit of enterprife had not happily feized 
fome of the inhabitants who have embarked in trade upon 
their own bottom, to fuch an extent, as not only to keep 
their number from decreafing, but even to make it rcfume, 
though not with equal rapidity, its former progrefs. 

From different lifts of the inhabitants, taken between 
the years 1775 and 1783, it appears, that the population of

The lifts, from which the above account is taken, do not 
enable the writer to fay precifely, what may be the propor- 
tion of males and females in the parifti ; but, from the 
regifter of baptifms, it would feem, that they are nearly 
equal. There are feven farms in the parifh, fome of 
them very fmall, containing 7 families and 40 fouls. 

The annual average of births, marriages and deaths, as 
appears from the regifters, at prefent, are,

Siatijlical Account 



Though this lall fum, multiplied by 36, does not nearJjt 
amount to the prefent number of inhabitants in the pariftj, 
yet this circumftance does not contradifl: the mode of cal- 
culation propofed by Sir John Sinclair, in a note fubjoined 
to his queries addrefled to the clergy of Scotland, and that 
for two obvious reafons : The one is, that many of the in- 
habitants of this parifh are either loft or die at fea, or fettle 
abroad ; and the other is, that, as many of the inhabitants 
came to this place at firft from the neighbouring pariflies, 
they chufe that, when they die, their bones fhould reft in 
the fame fpot, where their forefathers refted before them ; in 
either of which cafes, their deaths are not inferted in the 
public regifters of the parifli. The great difproportion, be- 
tween the annual births and burials, is to be accounted for 
in the fame way : The proportion between the annual 
births and the whole population, is as i to 27-,%; be- 
tween the annual marriages and the whole population, is 
as I to 109 ; between the annual burials and the whole 
population is as i to 58I. Each marriage produces, at an 
average, about 3 children. Each family confifts, at an a- 
verage, of near 3^ fouls. 

ProduBions. — Ffom what has been faid above, refpeSing 
the extent, the foil, and the population of this parifli, k 
will readily appear, that its produdlions are, by no means, 
equal to the fupport of its inhabitants. It is true, the flat 
part of the parifti, which is entirely converted into garden 
ground, except that on which the town ftands, is in a ftate 
of the higheft cultivation, and produces the richeft crops. 
All kinds of vegetables, belonging to a kitchen garden, are 
raifed here in the greateft abundance. The gardens are ho 
lefe remarkable for producing common fruits, both big and 
fmall J and particularly that fpecies of plumbs commonly 
called magnum honums ; for all which the public garden- 
ers 



of New Port-Glafgow. 



ers find a ready market in the neighbouring towns anji 
villages. 

But as for the mountainous part of the parifli, by far the 
largeft proportion of it in point of territory, it contains on- 
ly the 7 poor farms already mentioned, ftill nearly in a 
ftate of nature ; and, from the fteepnefs of their lituation, as 
"ivell as the barrennefe of their foil, likely to continue fo 
for ever. The productions of the arable part of thefe farms 
are little more grain, than what is fufficient to fupport the 
farmer's own families, together with fome potatoes for 
which, after fupplying themfelves, they find a ready mar- 
ket in the town. It ' is upon the produce of their cows, 
as was obferved above, that the farmers chiefly depend for 
the payment of their rents. 

From this account of things, it is evident, that the parifli 
does not fupply itfelf with provifions, no not for a fingle 
week in the year. The fole dependence of the inhabitants, 
for provifions of every kind, is on the neighbouring|pa- 
riflies, (as far as their fertility, compared with the general 
ftate of population in the country, will admit ;) and onDum- 
fries-fliire, from v/hich confiderable quantities of oats and 
oat-meaj are imported ; but chiefly on Ireland, from 
•which, not only grain and meal, but almoft every other ar- 
ticle of provifion is brought to this place. 

Proprietors. — In the parifli of New Port-Glafgow, 
there is only one manour, or barony of lands, or rather on- 
ly a fmall part of one, (the greatefl; part of it lying in the 
neighbouring parifli of Kilmalcolm), and that is the eftate 
of Finlayfton-Maxwell. At the time that the magifl;rates 
and council of Glafgow made their, purchafe, for the pur-: 
pofe of erecting a harbour, this eftate was in the poflfeflion 
of a Sir Patrick Maxwell of Newark ; but, at prefent, it 
^jelongs to William Hamilton, Efq; of Wifliaw. The man- 

fion

Statijlical Account 



fion houfe of the cftate lies contiguous to this town, clofe 
by the fhore. From an infcription on one corner of it, it 
would feem, that this houfe was built in the year 1599. 
It is a fortified building, pretty large, with a caftle or 
tower at one end of it, which feems to be of an older date 
than the reft of the houfe. In the conftruftion of this 
building, one can eafily read the fpirit of the times. 
Here is the great hall, in which the Baron: convened his 
TalTals, and iffued forth his mandates to them ; here too 
are painted, or rather daubed, the arms of all the great 
families with which he was connefted, either by the ties 
of blood or friendlhip ; and here ftands the great gate with 
the iron door, which was triple bolted every night, that 
he might not be furprifed before the morn by fome other 
chieftain, with whom he might have a deadly feud. At 
prefent, however, this ancient fabric is in ruins, and has 
not been inhabited fince the beginning of the century. 
That part of the eftate, which lies within the limits of this 
parifli, comprehends the 7 farms already mentioned, and 
draws about L. 200 Sterling of yearly rent. 

Town. — Though the name of the parifli be New Port- 
Glafgow, that of the town is t^ew Port-Glafgoiv, (vulgar- 
ly Port-Glafgow,) and Newark. .The occ^fion of this 
double name is, that one part of the town, indeed by far 
the greateft part of it, ftands upon the piece of ground 
which was feued by the city of Glafgow, and to which 
they gave a name, taken from the purpofe to which it 
was applied ; and that another part of it is the original 
village, but now conliderably enlarged, which was ftand- 
ing there when that feu was made. Thefe two parts are 
adjoining, and form one town ; the proprietors of houfes 
in the former being vaiTals of the city of Glafgow, and 
thofe in the latter vaflals of the proprietor of the eftate of 

Finlayfton 



of "^ew Port-Glajgow. 



553 



Finlayfton-Maxwell. — Before the year 1775, the city of 
Glafgow, and the proprietor of the lands of Finlayfton- 
Maxwell, exercifed the fame jurifdiiSlion over their refpec- 
tive parts of the town, that a liege Lord exercifes over his 
vaffals. But at this period, the feuers of Port-Glafgow 
and Newark, with the concurrence of theii: immediate 
fuperiors, applied to Parliament, and got themfelves ereft- 
ed into a burgh of barony, with a council of 13 perfons, 
called truftees, appointed to regulate and manage the pu- 
blic police of the place. Thefe truftees are feuers poflef- 
fed of, at leaft, L. 10 Sterling a-year of heritable property 
within the town. They were elected for the firft time by a 
general poll of all the feuers, and ever after are elefted 
by themfelves ; four of them being difqualified yearly by 
a plurality of votes, and four others, who had not been in 
the council for three years before, being chofen to fill up 
the vacant places. Of thefe truftees, two are bailies ; the 
one, called the oldeft bailie, is chofen annually by the 
Town-council of Glafgow, and the other, called the young- 
eft bailie, is chofen annually by the truftees themfelves, 
^' which two bailies, (fays the aft of Parliament), or either 
" of them, are authorifed, empowered, and required to ad- 
«' minifter juftice, and to exercife all the power and autho- 
" rity, by the laws of Scotland, committed to ihe bailies 
" of a bui'gh of barony." 

Revenue. — The public revenue of the town amounts to 
about L. 500 Sterling a-year. It arifes chiefly from a tax 
of L. 2~ Sterling per cent, upon houfe rents •, from another 
tax of two pennies Scotch upon every pint of ale, ^ either 
brewed in the town or brought into it ; from the rent of 
the kirk feats and flefli market, and from the harbour 
dues. This revenue is expended in paying the minifter's 
ftipends, and the different fchoolmafters falaries ; in keep-

It is to be obferved, however, that though tlie above

property of the merchants who refide in the port. Some 
of the veffels, particularly thofe employed in foreign trade, 
are either wholly or in part the property of fome houfes 
in Glafgow. It is alfo to be obferved, that the trade of 
the port is, by no means, carried on only by the veffels 
belonging to it. From the cuftom-houfe books, it appears, 
that the veffels to and from the port, in the year 1790,

American and Well India markets. The .coafters are 
chiefly employed in carrying coals and merchant • goods 
upon the river, and in bringing grain and other provi- 
fions from Dumfries-fliire and Ireland. — The head cuftom- 
houfe for the trade of Clyde is ftationed here. The offi- 
cers employed in it, having the King's commiffion, or ra- 
ther a treafury-w^arrant, are, a coUedor, a comptroller, a 
land-furveyor, a tide-furveyor, a weigher, 6 land-waiters, 
17 tide-waiters, and 6 boat-men. 

Church. — The Magiftrates and Council of Glafgow are 
the patrons of the parifli, by purchafe from the Earl of 
Glencairn, patron of the parifli of Kilmalcolm, from which 
this parilh was disjoined. It is faid, that the old feuers 
of Port-Glafgow, i. e. the proprietors of the feus which 
exifted at the time of the erection, have a joint right with 
the Town-Council of Glafgow to the patronage ; but this 
claim has never been legally afcertained. Certain it is, 
that the prefent incumbent holds the' benefice by a pre- 
fentation from the Magiftrates and Council of Glafgow on- 
ly. The living is L. 100 Sterling, with L. 10 Sterling for 
a houfe, and L. 2 Sterling for a yard per annum, with- 
out either manfe or glebe. 

As the parilh kirk bears no proportion to the number 
of the inhabitants, fuch of them as could not be accommo- 
dated with feats, applied to the prefbytery of Paifley, a- 
bout the year 1767, for liberty to employ an alEftant 
preacher in communion with the Eftabliflied Church, to 
difpenfe the ordinances of religion to them- For feveral 
years, this afliftant officiated in the houfe which was the 
firft place of public worllnp in the town, and which is now 
occupied by a fail-maker. But in the year 1774, the 
flock of this affiftant, or the chapel-people, as they are 

called,

called, built an elegant houfe of worfliip, in the fuburbs of 
the town, fufficient to contain about 1800 people, in which 
, I hey are accommodated, for the purpofes of public wor- 
ikip, in a ftile fuperior to moft kirks in Scotland. The 
annual revenue of this chapel, arifing from the rents of the 
feats, amounts to L. 140 Sterling ; and the living of the 
minifter is L, 100 per an7ium. 

Schools mtd Poor. — There are three public fchools in 
this town, viz. a Grammar, a Writing and Arithmetic, 
and an Englifli fchool. The Grammar fchoolmafter's fa- 
lary is 100 merks Scotch, and that of the other two isL. 10 
Sterling each per annum. The fchool wages are, for teach- 
ing Latin, 5 s. ; for teaching Writing and Arithmetic, 5 s. ; 
and for teaching Englifh, 3 s. per quarter. The number 
of fcholars, is, at an average, about 50 at each fchool. — 
Perhaps in no parlfti of Scotland are the poor more libe- 
rally fupplied than 'in this. The roll of ftated penfioners, 
at prefent, amounts to 140. The fum allotted to them is 
from 6 d. to 3 s. per week each, according to their circura- 
ftances. Belides, fuch perfons as are reduced to indigence, 
from any tranlient caufe, partake of the charity of this 
place, in proportion to their neceffities, fo long as that 
caufe continues to operate. The power of fixing the fum 
given to each penfioner, whether ftated or occafional, is 
lodged in the kirk-feflion, under the controul of a com- 
mittee of the heritors or feuers. The funds, from which 
the poor are fupported, arife from the coUeftions at the 
parifli kirk and chapel ; from money given for proclama- 
tion of marriage banns ; from fines for clandeftine or irre- 
gular marriages; from the intereft of L. 290 Sterling, 
which the heritors hold upon a bill to the feffion, and from 
an afleiliiient of the inhabitants. In the year 179c, the 

fum.

fum given to the poor of this parifli amounted to L. 297 
Sterling. 

CharaBer. — The better fort of people here are fober, in- 
duftrious, and charitable. At all times they are attentive 
to the interefts of the poor. They were peculiarly fo in 
the years 1782 and 1783. In that period of extraordinary 
dearth and fcarcity, they imported large quantities of meal, 
and fold it to the poor at a reduced price, chearfully taking 
the lofs fuftained upon themfelves ; and fome of them gene- 
roufly advanced confiderable fums, free of intereft, to car- 
ry on this humane and benevolent trade. The inferior 
claffes of inhabitants are of a different completion ; fobrie- 
ty and induftry are certainly not their charafteriftics 5 though, 
to this general alTertion, there are many exceptions, It is 
aim-oft incredible what quantities of fpirituous liquors, and 
efpecially of the vyorft fpecies of whiiliy, are confumed in 
this town ; and it is painful to add, but truth requires it, 
that not a little of it is confumed by women. 

Mifccllaneous Olfervations.--\xi the channel of the river, 
oppofite to the caftle of Newark, feveral pieces of wreck have 
at diiferent times, been difcovered. The tradition is, and, as 
far back as the memory of the oldeft inhabitant, now living, 
reaches, has been, that when the Spaniih Armada was defeat- 
ed and difperfed by the Engiifh, in the year 1588, and fome 
of the Spanifli fliips of war were feen hovering off the weit 
coa(l; of Scotland, either one or more veflels were ordered to 
be funk in this part of the river, (whether by public authority 
or not, the tradition does not fay,) to prevent thofe fliips of 
war, if they ftiould attempt it, from furprifing the caftle of 
Dunbarton, which is about 4 miles above this place. — The 
magnificence of the profpecl, from the hill behind the town, 
and even from the quays, is a njitural curioiity, which de-

ferves notice. Immediately before you is the river Clyde, 
having all the appearance of a frefh water lake, as the out' 
let to the fea is not vifible, with numbers of large and fmall 
veffels failing upon it. Next to this, the oppofite coaft of 
Dunbarton and Argyle fiiires, abounding in gentlemens 
feats, meets the eye ; and the profpeft is terminated by 
the weftern range of the Grampian mountains, at unequal 
diftances, and fo ragged and craggy on the tops, that, by 
way of contradiftion, they are known here by the empha- 
tical name of the Duke of ' Argyle' s Bowling Green.— In 
this town there are no fewer than 8i houfes which have 
a licence for felling ale and fpirituous liquors, befides feveral 
others which deal clandeftinely in thefe articles without any 
licence at all. This is no very favourable fymptom of the 
fobriety of the place, when fo many venders of ale and fpi- 
rits can make a living by their trade. 

The old Scotch dialed is fpoken in this town, efpecially 
by the common people, and is pronounced by many of 
them with a good deal of the Gaelic accent, owing, it 
is fuppofed, to their intercourfe with Highlanders, of whom 
great numbers refort occafionally to this place, and not a 
few fettle in it. </p>

OLD PARISH OF GREENOCK. 

Ere&amp;ion, Name, Situation, and Extejit. 

ON the joint application of the proprietors, in the year 
1636, to the Lords of Commiffion for Plantation of 
Kirks, valuation of Teinds, iSc. certain lands were disjoin- 
ed from Innerkip and Houfton, and ere£led into a parifli, 
which, from the lands of greateft extent and valuation, was 
named Greenock *. This name is doubtlefs derived from 

the

But this is a mere quibble. What fort of an oak is Gourock? and what

the Gaelic Grianeg, fignifying, according to Gaelic ctymo- 
loglfts, the Sim?iy Baj, or, the Bay of the Sun. — This parilh 
is fituated in the N. W. part of the county of Renfrew, 
within the bounds of the prefbytery of Paifley, and Synod 
of Glafgovv and Ayr, having the magnificent and pidu- 
refque frith of Clyde on the north. Indented by fereral 
convenient bays, the chief of which is the united bay of 
Greenock and Crawfurdfdike, it ftretches along the frith 
about 44- Englifli miles ; to the fouth it extends confiderably 
farther, reprefenting altogether the ftiape of a capital D, 
of which i r curvatur has been too far protracted. 

Hills, Surface, Fuel, &amp;c. — Excepting a ftrip of level 
ground of different breadths, along the fhore, the 'parifli 
of Greenock is hilly. To a fpedtator from Garval, a point 
of land, on the eaft fide of the bay above naentioned, a 
range of ^^ills appear rifing at Finlayfton, the feat of the 
Earls of ^lencairn, oppofite to the Rock of Dumbarton, 
Louch, and Port-Glafgow thence they recede fouthward, 
heightening as they recede, till, at the diftance of about 2 
miles S. E. from the town of Greenock *, having attained 
the height of almoft 800 feet above the level of the fea, 
they agaia decline, bending to the bay of Gourock, where 
they terminate ; thus forming to the eye a fweep of a large 
circle, including, with the frith, a great extent of furface, 
very agreeably diverfified, except by wood, which is fcarce. 
Beyond the hills feen from the fliore, there are others at 
different diftances, fome 100 feet higher, and one at leaft 
200, with here and there intervening fwamps and moffes, 
affording the country people abundance of peat for fuel to 
themfelves, and for fale in the neighbouring towns and vil- 
lages. From the fartheft hills, the ground declines to the 

riv&amp;r 

# The fummit of the hills is here intended. 



&amp;f Greenock, 



river Grife, which, rifing in the weftern confineo of the di- 
ftrift of Kilmalcolm, runs through the fouthern part of the 
parifh of Greenock ; and, increaling as it flows, by number- 
.iefs rivulets from the high grounds on both fides, glides, 
in a winding direction, through a long flrath or valley, to 
which it gives name, and falls into the Black Cart, near 
Paifley. — Along the coaft, except where it has been cleared 
by induftry, it is ftielvy, rough, and much incumbered 
with large ftones. Thefe ftones, however, are not unpro- 
dudlive ; they yield annually a luxuriant crop of fea weed*, 
which, though deemed inferior in quality to drifted ware, 
the neighbouring farmers cut, efpecially in the beginning 
of May, and fpread on the grounds they are preparing for 
barley, with great advantage to the crop. 

Soil. — The foil, clofe upon the fhore, is, in general, very 
light, fandy^^and full of gravel, requiring frequent ihowers 
to produce tolerable pafture. After reft, however, and the 
aid of a little manure in favourable feafons, fea ware, for 
inftance, of which from time to time, by ftrong wefterly 
and northerly gales, there is no fmall quantity thrown on 
the fliore, it produces very good crops of oats and barley ; 
and, (which annually becomes a greater objedt of culture), 
l^rge quantities of potatoes of the beft quality f . In the 
afcent, to a confiderable diftance from the flat ground on 
the ftiore, there occur foils of various kinds, earth, clay,

from the fliore, the foil for the moft part is thin, in fbme 
places mclTy ; the bare rocks here and there appearing. 
On the other fide of thefe hills, except a few cultivated fpots 
in the defcent to and on the banks of Grife, heath, com- 
monly tall, and a coarfe benty grafs prevail. 

Minerals. — With refpeft to foflils, the parifli of Gree- 
nock, as far as has been hitherto difcovered, affords none 
that are any way remarkable. Along the coaft, freeftone,' 
moftly of a red colour, and fometimes beautifully variega- 
ted with regular fpots of a light gray colour, occa- 
lionally intermixed with a great variety of what is called 
fea pebble, of different fhapes and hues, is moft common. 
The ftrata of this flone on the Ihore, and a great way a- 
bove it, as if the vaults of caverns below them had fome 
(time failed, are very irregular, fcarcely ever horizontal, 
but dipping or inclining, at diiferent angles in every di- 
re£tion, and chiefly towards the fouth, Limeftone, though 
much needed for building, and improvement of coarfe ftiff 
grounds, has only been of late difcovered, and but in fraall 
quantities •, nor is it of the beft quality, being mixed with a 
confiderable proportion of fand. Farther fearch, it is to be 
hoped, may be rewarded with better fuccefs. In the fteep 
banks of fome of the numerous rivulets from the hills, and 
in a thick bed of fchiftus, there appears a thin feam of it, 
divided into pieces about the fize of a man's head, and of 
exi client quality. Thefe, as they fall, (for the expence of 
ground and labour, would far exceed their value,) are care- 
fully colleded, and ufed with good effeft by the attentive 
farmer. 

Whether it would be advifable to make trial for coal 
in any part of the parifli, thofe fkiUed in that bufinefs will 
be beil able to determine. From the vaft quantity ufed in

Greenock and Port-Glafgow, and annually exported * by 
the merchants of both places, a mafs of that neceflary com - 
modity would, it is evident, be a fource of great wealth 
to the proprietor, and a very great benefit to the inhabi- 
tants of thefe towns, and the places adjacent. In digging 
pretty deep wells, l^c. there have occurred ftrata of earth, 
clay mixed with tticUs, fea fand, gravel, frceltone, whin, 
l5-c. but no appearance hitherto of that valuable foffil. 
The hills, for the moft part, feem to be a mafs of whin, 
very compadl and folid in fome parts ; in others, efpecially 
toward their fummits, chinky and friable. In not a few 
places, the rocks feem once to have been in a ftatc of fu- 
lion, and loofe ftones fcattered here and there, exhibit fo 
much the appearance of the cinders of a fmithy furnace, 
that there can be little doubt of their having undergone, 
fome time or other, the adlion of fire. What minerals the 
Gceenock hills may contain, is not known. The deep 
chafms made in them by fundry rivulets, which, after 
heavy rains, ddfcend in torrents, have been carefully exa- * 
mined. In the drought of fummer, the loofe ftones, peb- 
bles, and fand, in the channel of thefe ftreams, have been 
examined by the writer of this Iketch ; but excepting iron- 
ftone of a poor quality, which is frequently found, and a 
little copper rarely in freeftone, no metallic fubftance has 
been hitherto difcovered. 

ProfpeBs. — From the broWs of the hills viewed from the 
town of Greenock, were the dreary fombre heath extirpated 
by culture, or hidden by thriving pLmtations, the landfcape, 
which abounds in other beauties, would be very agreeable. 
Tliat trees would grow in fuch a fituation, is little to be 
doubted. Young plants of the Scotch fir, (from feeds

dropt probably by birds,) have been found by the writer 
of this Iketch, in great vigour on the very tops of thefe 
hills ' \ near which, as is abundantly evident from their re- 
maining roots and trunks, which are now and then dug up 
in mofles, a variety of large trees, principally oak, have 
formerly grown.

the town, rendered more acceffible, which, at fome ex- 
pence, they certainly might be, by roads conduced in a

diftance from fo flourilhing a fea-port, might, doubtlefs, 
in a Ihort time, be greatly beautified and improved, when 
we confider the natural inclination which town's people, 
as they become wealthy, difcover to have houfes, gardens, 
and little patches of ground in the country. Though the 
town, as may afterward be noticed more particularly, is 
far from being unhealthy, yet people, whofe circumftan- 
ces can afford it, know how defirable the ftill more faluta- 
ry air of the country is. Along the fkirts of the hilb 
there are many eligible fituations, for thofe who have a re- 
lifli for- the beauty and magnificence of nature. Below

eail part of which is a caftle of the Dukes of Argyle, with 
flourifhing plantations. 

In afcending the Greenock hills, the profpedl is ftill va- 
ried and extended. From Corlic, the hlgheft ground in 
the parilh, may be feen in a clear day, befides that of Ren- 
frew, part of the counties of Bute, Arran, and Argyle ; 
with the weftern part of the Scotch Alps, the Grampian 
mountains of Perth, Stirling, Clydefdale, Lanark, and Ayr. 
From this height, people, who are fond of the varying 
fcenery of nature, will fometimes obferve the fmooth fur- 
face of the frith begin to be ruffled by the wind, whidi 
here and there feems to pour down upon it, moving the 
water in all direftions. At other times, they will mark 
the Ihadow of thick ftationary clouds, which appear as fo- 
many iflands ; and at times a light fleecy vapour, frequent- 
ly mentioned in Gaelic poetry, fufpended over, or by a 
gentle breeze, flovvly moving in the direclion of the Clyde. 
Sometimes, though rarely, during an intenfe froft, a. 
very thick fog ftretches from beyond Glafgow far be- 
low Greenock. Keeping a level, it covers the hollows 
on both fides of the frith. While people in the low 
grounds, all bepowdered with hoar froft, pafs a dark and 
otherwife difagreeable day, a ferene Iky may be enjoyed 
on the Greenock hills, without the leaft fpeck of cloud ; as 
the fog feldom rifes more than 400 or 500 feet above the 
level of the fea. The furface of the vaft mafs of vapour 
on- which you look down, is fo exaftly defined, and feems 
fo compad and firm, that people might think they could, 
from the brow of the hill, ftep upon it, and fafely walk o- 
ver to the hills on the oppofite fide of the river. Thefe 
waves of vapour exhibit the fwelling of the waves of the 
fea without their motion ; and, according to their fituation, 
form, and denfity, are varioufiy tinged with the rays of the

Thefe rivulets are at lall colkaed into four ttreams, two of 
which are in many refpefts ferviceable to the town of 
Greenock.

different forts of game common in this part of the coun-

ducks repair to the frith for their fubfiftence, and in fnow,

bling Shakefpeare's ' unwedgeable and gnarled oak,' it will 
not be eafy to account for, on the principles of any of thofe 
theories of the earth, which in fucceflion have been, with 
too much confidence, ulhered into the world. Though 
fome of the fprings, with which the Greenock hills abound, 
are, in fome degree, impregnated with iron, in general 
they emit the pureft water f, which is collefted into fun- 
dry refervoirs, and thence conduced, in leaden pipes, to the 
different parts of the town. In widening the crevices of 
the rocks, from which the water ifliies, one is furpriled to 
pbferve, fometimes ten or a dozen frogs of different fizes, 
and of a dark colour, forced into day by the increafed 
ftream. Whether they were natives of the place from 
whence they came, entered in their tadpole ftate, or foon 
after, it is certain, that if the opening had not been enlar- 
ged, they could not have got out ; and it is remarkable, a 
circumftance on which one might moralife, that all of them 
make the utmoll effort to return to their cold dark dungeon.

Situation, Extent, and EreBion. 

ON the weft fide of the united bay of Greenock and 
Crawfurdfdike, formerly called the Bay of St Lau- 
rence, from a chapel near it, dedicated to that faint, and a- 
bout half way between the eaft and weft boundaries of the 
parifti, is fituated the town of Greenock. In the beginning 
of the prefent century, it confifted of a row of houfes, cover- 
ed with thatch, along the bay, and had no harbour what- 
ever for veflels. ' Now, with its fuburbs, and the village of 
Crawfurdfdike, adjoining to it on the eaft, Greenock may 
be faid to extend along the frith fomething more than an 
Englifti mile. Its greateft breadth is fcarcely an eighth pf 
a mile. A few years previous to the year 1745, a new 
parifti was ereded in Greenock, with confent of Sir John 
Shaw, who made over the right of patronage to the heri- 
tors and elders.

Population.— From the beft calculation that can now be 
made of the number of inhabitants in the year 1745, they 
did not exceed 4000 in both parifhes. Ten years later, 
they had rather decreafed, the return to Dr WebHer in 
1755 being, from the old parifh, 1886 7 . „ 
and from the new, - ,9725 ^" ^" 3858. 

— But about the year i 760, the town began to increafe ra- 
pidly, and continued to do fo till the American war, which 
occafioned almofl an entire flagnation of its trade. Imme- 
diately, however, on the peace in 1783, trade revived, and 
Greenock is now in a much more flouriftiing ftate, than it 
was at any period previous to that unfortunate conteft ; 
containing in all no fewer than 15,000 fouls. From the re- 
gifter of the Old Parifli of Greenock, is extradled the fol- 
lowing lift of marriages and births *, for 10 years preceding

Poor.— hi taking the account of the Inhabitants, it was 
alfo particularly noted, with much concern, that there are 
in the twoparifhes no fewer than 1 185 children, whbfe 
parents are unable to defray the expence of their education ; 
and that 883 of that number are the children of parents 
from the counties of Scotland above mentioned. To ac- 
count for this, it is to be obferved, that moft of the labour- 
ers, boatmen, failors, &amp;c. in Greenock, are from the High- 
lands, and that they often fettle there with large families, 
to fupport which recpiires their utmoft induftry and applica- 
tion. The wealthier people in Greenock, and even thofe in 
moderate circumftances, are uncommonly generous and li- 
beral ; and there are, perhaps, no people in Scotland, 
whofe genefofity and liberality have been better tried. 
Though charity fhould not end at home,, it is reafon and 
found policy that it Ihould 6egm there. In no part of the 
Highlands or Ifles of Scotland, perhaps, would the benevo^ 
lent intentions of the Society for propagating Chriftian 
Knowledge be better anfwered, than in Greenock, The e- 
redllon of a free fchool or two, for the education of the chil- 
dren of poor people from the Highlands, wotrld be attend- 
ed with the happieft effefts. That their charity would be 
applied according to their pious intentions, the Society 
would have the beft fecurity in the difinterefted zeal of the 
wealthier part of the Highland inhabitants, of which they 
have lately given a very good proof. Nothing, for a num- 
ber of years part, has been more needed, than a place of 
public worfhip, for a vaft number of people who do not 
well underfland the Englifli language. By a voluntary 
fubfcription, amounting to L. 1500, the wealthier part of 
the Highland inhabitants have lately erefled a large, ele- 
gant, and commodious Gaelic chapel, and endowed it with 
L. 100 per annum. They are to eleSt a minifter of the E- 
(laTiliflied Church, who is to preach one half of the Sab-

bath in Gaelic, and the other in EngliHi. The funds 
for ths maintenance of the poor, who are very numerous *, 
are the weekly coUeftions at the churches, the Marine So- 
ciety, and the trades boxes. Thefe being inadequate, and 
to put a flop to vagrant begging, with which the town was 
intolerably infefted. the inhabitants of both pariflies, in 
1785, agreed to affefs themfelves in a fum that might fup- 
ply the deficiency. The fcheme, which is conduced as 
the law direfts, has been continued j and, but for the 
fimplicity of people who ftill give encouragement' to va- 
grants, would completely anfwer its important end. 
The fum raifed by affeffment from the beginning has 
not greatly increafed. The affeffment for 1791 was 
L. 360. Where there are many feparate funds for the 
maintenance of the poor, it is not to be fuppofed, that 
an equal diftribution can be made. It is therefore 
much to be wiflied, that as many of them as poffibly could, 
•were thrown into one, for the benefit of the indigent. The 
annual amount of charities, in Greenock, is not lefs, it is 
believed, than L. 1200 Sterling. 

The Merchants Houfe Society in Greenock was eftablifh- 
ed in 1787. The fubfcription money on admiffion is 
L. 5, 5 s. and 5 s. annually. No part of the fund is to be 
expended, till the ftock amount to L. 1000, when the in- 
tereft may be diftributed in charities among the decayed 
members. 

Churches^ i^c. — The church and manfe of Greenock 
%vere not built till the year 1759. The ftipend is 100 
guineas per annum, exclufive of the manfe and garden. 

The

common failors fqiiander their money. One of diem who, foon after the 
commencement of the American war, received L. 1 800 of pri^-money, . 
fpent it all in about two years ; and dying, left fome young children to be 
ajaintained by the parilh. 



574 •5' tatijlical Acco unt 

The late minifter was the fecond fince the ereflion of the 
new panfli. Befides the two parifli churches, there are in 
Greenock a Chapel of Eafe, built about 20 years ago, the 
Gaelic chapel, above mentioned, a Burgher and an Anti- 
burgher meeting-houfe. In the adjoining* village of Craw- 
furdfdike, the Burghers have another place of worihip. 
The number, however, of thofe who hpve entirely fepara- 
ted themfelves from the church, is by no means great. It 
is curious to remark, that about 156 years ago, the churches 
of Kilmacolm and Innerkip were neighbouring churches. 
There are now between them 10 * places of worftiip, -vi^. 
three churches and three chapels of the Eftablifliment,' and 
four houfes belonging to the Seceffion ; and, where 'there 
were fcarcely as many hundreds about the beginning of 
the prefent century, there are now about 19,000 people. 

Government.— T^it town of Greenock, which is govern- 
ed by a Council of 9 feuers, two of whom are bailies, is a 
burgh of barony, ereded in the year 1757, by Sir John 
Shaw, who was then fuperior. The village of Cart/dike, 
or Crawfurdfdike, which has a good harbour and quay' 
older than thofe of Greenock, is alfo a burgh of barony'. 
It was erefted in 1633, ^7 King Charles II. 

Road and Harbour.— 0£ the road and harbour bf Green- 
ock many things might be faid, but a few muft fuiHce. 
By a fand bank of confiderable breadth, ftretching from 
Dunbarton to a little below the town, the road is made 
narrow, and the navigation to Port-Glafgow rendered 
fometimes tedious and difficult. At low ebbs, (except

two flanting gaps * through it), it is dry, and abounds 
with Ihell filh of various kinds. In high gales of N. E. 
wind, it is of no fmall feryice to the road and harbour of 
Greenock. At the bottom, or tail (as it is ufually called) 
of this bank, and which, as a loofing place, experienced 
mariners prefer to any other harbour in the frith, there is, 
at all times, fufficient depth of water, abundance of room, 
and good anchoring ground for hundreds of ftiips, of any 
burden hitherto built. Direftly oppofite to the tail of the 
bank, where the channel is narroweft, tradition fays, there 
was anciently a fort or caftle. On the fpot, which Rill 
retains the name of The Forth, or Fort, a battery was raifed 
during the war before laft, on occafion of the alarm given 
the weft coaft'of Scotland, by the fmall fquadron, command- 
ed by the juft, the humane and the gallant Frenchman, 
M. Thurot ; and, on a fimilar alarm, by fome privateers 
in the beginning of the American war, a ftill more formi- 
dable one. It mounted twelve 24 pounders, and was 
flanked by feveral brafs pieces, 12 and 9 pounders, en bar- 
bette, on a private quay jutting into the channel ; all under 
the direftion of a party of the artillery. People, however, 
who know the winds neceffary to bring veffels into the 
port, and to carry them out to fea, will probably be of 
opinion, that all this labour and expence might have been 
fpared. None but a madman would think of attempting 
a port, from which his efcape would be almoft impoffible. 

As to the harbour, properly fo called, the inhabitants 
of Greenock, in the year 1700, petitioned the Scotch Par- 
liament for a fund to build it which petition, for what 
reafon does not appear, the Parliament abfolutelyrefufed. 
Some time after, they entered into a contraft with their

fupenor, Sir John Shaw, and for the above purpofe, a vo- 
luntary alTelTmcnt of i s. 4 d. Sterling, was laid on each 
lack of malt brewed into ale within the limits of the town. 
In confequence of this, the harbour was begun in 1707. 
Within two circular quays, (a mid quay or tongue inter- 
vening, confifting of above aooo feet of Hone), are inclofed 
more than ten acres. The expence was upwards of 
100,000 merks. Alarmed by the greatnefs of the debt in- 
curred, on Sir John Shaw's agreeing to take it upon him, 
they refigned to him the harbour and aflTelTment above 
mentioned. After the Union, however, the trade of the 
port increafed fo rapidly, that, in the year 1740, the whole 
debt was extinguiftied, and there remained a furplus, the 
foundation of the prefent town's fiinds, of 27,000 
merks *. 

The fund, arifing from the harbour, in 1783, was 
L. Ill : 4 : 8 ; in 1792, L. 812, 9 s. ' The other funds of 
the town are the rents of warehonfes and markets, the fur- 
plus of feat rents in the New Church, after paying the 
mmifter's ftipend ; and a water tax of 2-|- per cent, on the 
rents of houfes above 40 s. The whole funds of the town 
laft year, all expences being defrayed, were L. iioo Ster- 
ling.

* It may feem ftrange, at tliis time, that the above tax on mall fnould 
have produced a fund for executing a work of fuch magnitude and ex- 
pence ; but furprife ceafes, when it is confidered, that at that time, and a 
good while after, ale was the only drink of the labouring people. De- 
voutly is it wilhed, by thofe who painfully obfei-ve the pernicious effedts 
of fpirituous liquors, on the conftitutions and morals of the people, that 
it had ftill continued to be fo. The quantity of thefe not very flow poi- 
' fons, annually confumed in Greenock, is almoft incredible. For retailing 
them in the year 1792, the number of licenfes granted in Greenock qnly, 
exclufive of the village of Cartfdike, is 247.

Dry Bock, ^^r.— The proprietors of the harbour in 
1783 began to build a dry dock, which was finifhed feve- 
ral years ago, and is reckoned a very complete piece of 
workmanfhip. This dock, however, from the y early in- 
creafe of (hipping, being inadequate to the demand, more 
of the Xame kind have been projeded. An addition to the 
harbour, on an extenlive plan, including great part of the 
bay of Cartfdike, was long thought of. The weft part of 
it is almoft finifhed. When the plan is completed, which 
it may be in the courfe of a few years, the harbour of 
Greenock, confidering the eafy navigation of the Clyde, 
will be one of the firft in Great Britain. 

Trade,— To this fhort account of its harbour, may be 
fubjoined a few notes refpeding the trade of Greenock *. 
Before the Union, the merchants of the town had fome 
trade to the Baltic for timber, in exchange for herrings ; 
and to France, Spain and other parts of Europe. In the 
year 1714 a cuftom-houfe was eftablifhed at Greenock, as 
a member of Port-Glafgow. From the Union to the be- 
ginning of the American war, a very great trade was car- 
ried on from Greenock, principally by the Glafgow mer- 
chants, who were owners of almoft all the fhips failing 
from that port. At prefent, the merchants of Greenoek 
are the principal fhij)-holders, and carry on the greateft 
part of the trade. 

The following extradl from the Cuftom-houfe books, 
gives a comparative view of the ftate of the tonnage of 
the fhipping from that port, in the year 1784, the firft year

From America, rice, naval ftores, pot-afli, oil, timber, Sz.c. 
and from France, Spain, Portugal, and the Mediterranean, 
wines, fruit, &amp;c. The trade to the Baltic for timber and 
naval ftores is very confiderable. The coafting trade is car- 
ried on to all the ports of Ireland, and of the weft of Eng- 
land, for grain, &amp;c. and the Canal between the Forth and 
the Clyde has opened an extenfive trade to the eaft coaft of 
Scotland, and to London. — From Greenock are exported 
herrings, coals, and all forts of Britifti manufadures. From 
that port, there are, by the Cana), 44 packets, to Leith, 
Dundee, London, to all parts of the North Highlands and 
Ifles, as far as Orkney; and packets to Liverpool, fine 
floops of 80 tons and upwards, well fitted up for the accom- 
modation of paffengers.

Fijheries. — As to fillieries, ; (in which the inhabitants of 
Greenock, juftly confidering them as a principal fource of 
their Avealth, have been much interefted,) it may be pro- 
per to mention, that in the reign of Charles II. and under 
the patronage of the Duke of York, a fociety of Herring 
Fijhers was eftabliflaed on the Clyde, with particular privi- 
leges. At the eaft end of the town of Greenock, in 1675, 
they inclofed a large piece of ground, which they called 
the Royal Clofe, (the name which it ftill retains,) for the 
purpofe of curing herrings. The Company was afterwards 
diffolved, and the buildings of the Clofe, which belong to 
the city of Glafgow, have been long occupied as ftorehoufes 
for tobacco. 

The herring fifliery, however, was continued by indivi- 
duals, and not without fuccefs, in boats on the river and 
neighbouring lochs, and in larger veflels to the Ifles. The 
Society of the Free Britijh Fijhery, being eftabliflied by adt 
of Parliament, in the year 1750, they granted a bounty to 
herring fifliers, of 30 s. /)£r ton, which, in 1757, they ex- 
tended to 50 s. j and, in 1771, with fome other alterations, 
reduced to 30 s. On the bounty laft year, (1791,) were 
cleared at the Cuftom-houfe, Greenock, and outports, 
129 buffes, on board 88 of which were 938 men. Belides 
large quantities of herrings, caught in the river and neigh- 
bouring lochs, which were fold for immediate confump- 
tion, there were entered, from the 5th of January 1791 to 
the 5th of January 1792, Bar. Her.

In the neighbouring bays and lochs, excellent falmon arc 
caught in their feafon, but none for exportation. Cod, 
haddocks and whitings, are got in great plenty from the rock 
of Ailfa upward, with which, befides Greenock and Port- 
Glafgow, are fupplied Glafgow, PaiHey, and the adja- 
cent country. 

The Whale Fijljery from Clyde has been by no means 
fuccefsful. It was firft attempted in the year 175a, when 
fome adventurers fent feveral ftiips to Greenland ; but not 
finding their account in it, they foon gave it up. This 
trade was again revived in 1786, at which time five large 
fliips, three from Greenock and two from Port-Glafgow, 
well equipped, and commanded by men of experience in 
the bufinefs, failed for Greenland. The Greenock mer- 
chants foon tired of this trade, which, however, is ftill car- 
ried on by the people of Port-Glafgow. Notwithftanding 
the high bounty paid by Government, it is faid to be but a 
poor concern. 

The Newfoundland and Nova Scotia fifheries are carried 
on to a very confiderable extent, by fome of the Greenock 
merchants. 

Manufa&amp;iires. — As to manufadlures, it is to be obfcrved, 
that fea port towns are by no means favourable to them. 
The boys generally prefer, (which, indeed, is fortunate,) a 
feafaring to a fedentary way of life. In the year 1725, 
a ropework, and fome time afterwards, a duck manufa^hire

river, where large quantities of cordage and failcloth arc 
made, for home confumption and for exportation. In Gree- 
nock there are three foap and candle works, one faddle and 
flioe manufaftory, and two fugar-houfes, all carried on for 
exportation to a great extent.

Ship-Building,— With, refpea to fliip-building, it may not 
be improper to mention, that formerly all the large yeflels 
belonging to Clyde were built in America ; but fince the 
Americans eftabliflaed their independence, fliip-building has 
gone on brifkly in the ports of Clyde, and in other ports 
all over BHtain. The largeft merchant veffel, ever built 
in Scotland, was launched at Greenock about a year ago- 
She belongs to a company in the town, who have a con- 
traft with Government, for fupplying the royal navy witli 
mails from Nova Scotia, of which flie has already cieliver- 
ed at one of the King's yards iioo tons. 

Climate. — The town of Greenock, though it certainly 
occupies too fmall a fpace for the number of its inhabitants, 
though one of its two principal ftreets, and a number of 
the lanes between them are very narrow, and though, 
from its vicinity to mountains, it is fubjeft to frequent 
rains *, is not, in the opinion of the medical gentlemen in 
it, unhealthy. Fevers of the infedious kind, and the fmali-' 
pox, among the lower fort of people, who will not be per- 
fuaded to avail themfelves of inoculation, are fometimes 
fatal f. 

Nuifances. — The ftreets, which in winter, of late 'years, 
have been pretty well lighted with lamps, are kept tolera- 
bly clean. It muft furprife a ftranger, however, to obferve, 
that in a fea-port, where, at a medium, the tide flows 9 or

* From an accurate account of the weather, however, kept for three 
years fucceflively. by the Profefibr of Natural Philofophy at Glafgow, 
and a gentlenian in Greenock, the balance appeared confiderably againll

to feet perpendicular, meeting feveral rivulets, the flaught- 
cr-houfe fliould fend, chiefly by means of pumped water, 
all its blood and filth through the greateft breadth of the 
town. This fliocking nuifance the Magiftrates and princi- 
pal people of Greenock have repeatedly attempted to re- 
move ; but all their endeavours have been hitherto 
thwarted. — The mention of one nuifance introduces ano- 
ther, which, as it gives pain to inhabitants and ftrangers of 
humane feelings, ought, if poflible, to be immediately re- 
moved. The earnings of the carmen, who ply the quays, 
are very confiderable. The fober among them grow rich ; 
the diffipated drink whilky, negleft their families, and 
ftarve their horfes. Deprived, by intoxication, of the lit- 
tle reafon they had, they deem it very eafy for fomething 
that had once been a horfe, — with nothing on its bones but 
Ikin, (and, from horrid ufage, not the whole of that), — to 
drag, on a low-wheeled ponderous car, to any ftore-houfe 
in Greenock, 15 cwts. of fugar or tobacco. When difap- 
pointed the reft may be eafily imagined *. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — About 15 years ago there 
was only one ftage-coach from Greenock to Glafgow ; now 
there are, every lawful day, four ; with one to Irvine, and 
in winter one between Greenock and Port Glafgow ; be- 
fides poft-chaifes, of which there are in the place, eight. — On 
the quays of Greenock, as hold-fafts for the fliips, and in o- 
ther parts of the town, may be feen a number of iron guns, 
of different fizes, which were many years ago recovered 
by a London diver, from the wreck of one of the fliips of 
the unfortunate Spanilh Armada, which funk off the old

inches, (fo little curiolitj have many people), ftill lies ne-

A refpeftable gentleman in the town, a relation of the ce- 
lebrated Principal Carstairs, has in his pofleffion the i- 
dentical thumbikins, with which the Principal was fevere- 
ly tortured *. — In 1783, a number of gentlemen in Green- 
ock, to fave themfelves the expence of purchafing many 
books, and to avert the fatal effefts which are fometimes 
occafioned by circulating libraries, inftituted a fubfcription 
library ; which now confifts of more than 200 volumes, 
for the moft .part very well feleded. 

CharaBer. — The fuperior ranks of people in Greenock are 
very civil and well bred ; the^people in general kind and hof- 
pitable to ftrangers. To this virtue, befides other induce- 
ments, many of them have the powerful motive fuggefted by 
the Jewifli Legiflator, " They know the heart of ftrangers, 
" having been ftrangers themfelves f ." One may at times 
walk from one end of the town to the other, pafling many 
people, and many people pafling him, without hearing a 
word of any language but Gaelic. Of this, their native 

tongue 

* The ftory of the thumbikins is, that Carftairs alked, and obtained 

them in a prefent from his tormentors. ' I have heard, Principal', 

faid King William to him, the fii-ft time he waited on his Majefty, 
' that you were tortured with, fomething they call thumbikins; Pray 
' what fort of inftrument of torture is it ?' ' I will fliew it you,' replied 
Carftairs, ' the next time I have the honour to wait on your Majefty.' 

The Principal was as good as his word. ' I muft try them,' faid the 

King ; — ' I muft put in my thumbs here — now. Principal, turn the fcrew.— 

' O not fo gently — another turn — another Stop I flop 1 no more— 

« another turn, I'm afraid, would make me confefs any thing.'

the pooreft people from the Highlands to boaft of their de-

them : " They are not fo wealthy as their neighbours, but 
to compenfate and more than compenfate this, they are of

confidering the great number of its inhabitants, and of ftran- 
gers, chiefly feafaring people, in fucceffion .from different 
parts of the world, has been fpoke of as remarkably quiet 
and regular. Very feldom, even in the night-time, is 
there any difturbancc or rioting in the ftreets ; and except- 
ing by a few, a decent refpe£l is paid to the Sabbath.

FORTH AND CLYDE NAVIGATION.</head>

<p>'''Y^HE advantages arifing to commerce from artificial na- 
-^^ vigatious, are now fo generally acknowledged, and 
their utility fo well known, that, wherever they are 
prafticable, the greateft encouragement has been given to 
undertakings of this kind. 

Scotland is almoft divided into two parts by the rivers 
Forth and Clyde ; the Forth falling into the Eaft fea be- 
low Edinburgh, and the Clyde into the Atlantic ocean be- 
low Glafgow. Thefe two rivers, thus falling ill oppofite 
direflions, into the two feas which furround the ifland, 
early fuggefted the idea of forming a communication aerofs 
the kingdom, by cutting the narrow neck of land between 
them, and thereby faving the long and dangerous naviga-

tion by the Land's End, or the Pfentland Frith. A navJ- 
gable canal betwixt the Forth and Clyde, was firft propo- 
fed by Charles II. for fmall fhips of war-, but the expence 
appearing too great for the finances of the kingdom at that 
period, the defign was laid afide. It was again revived in 
1723, when a furvey was taken by a Mr Gordon ; but no- 
thing was done in confequence of it, until the year 1762, 
•when the then Lord Napier, at his own expence, employed 
Mr Robert Mackell to make a furvey and eftiraate of a Ca- 
nal, which Ih'.nild leave the river Clyde at Tocker Burn, a- 
bout five miles below Glafgow, and join the Forth within 
about two miles from the mouth of the river Carron. In- 
duced by Mr Mackell's favourable report, the Board of 
Trultees, for the encouragement of fiftieries and manufac- 
tures in Scotland, employed the late Mr Smeaton to make 
another furvey and eftiinate for a canal, 5 . feet deep, which 
was to cofl: L. 80,000 ; an expenditure, it was feared, too 
great for the trade which was likely to pafs through it. 

In 1766, a number af refpeftable aierchants in Glafgow, 
feeing there was little probability of the fcheme being ta- 
ken up by the public, formed the defign of making a fmall 
eanal, 4 feet deep, and 24 feet wide, eftimated at L. 30,000; 
and a fubfcription for this purpofe was foon filled up. But 
when the bill was brought into Parliament, it was oppofed 
on feveral accounts, the principal of which were, the fmall- 
nefs of the fcale, and the little utility which the country in 
general would derive, from any veflels which it could pof- 
fibly admit and alfo that, if the proprietors of this canal 
flionld once obtain a right to the water, it would for ever 
preclude the poflibility of making one of larger dimen- 
fions. The bill being thus loft in the Houfe of Commons, 
a number ef noblemen and gentlemen began a fubfcription 
at London, for uniting the two feas by a canal /even feet 
deep ; and the next year they obtained the fandtion of Par- 
liament, 



qf the Forth arid Clyde Navigation, 587 



liament, by the name of the Company of Proprietors of the 
Forth and Clyde Navigation. 

By the aft, they were likewife empowered to make a 
collateral branch to the city of Glafgow, for the better ac- 
commodation of the trade there. Their joint Itock was 
declared to confift of 150c (hares of L. 100 each, making 
in all the fum of L. 150,000, with liberty to borrow 
L. 50,000 more ; and the fabfcribers for five lhares were 
entitled to vote by themfelves or proxies, and to be eleft- 
ed managers of the Company. On the loth of July 1768, 
under the direftion of Mr Smeaton, the Compcxny began to 
break ground, and, after having met wita many and al- 
moft unfurmountable difficulties, the Canal was rendered 
navigable on the loth of July 1775, as far as Stockingfield. 
which is the point where the fide branch to Glafi^ow goes 
off. In November 1777, the fide cut was brought for- 
ward to Hamilton Hill, where a large bafon was made for 
the reception of veffels, and the proprietors of the neigh- 
bouring grounds erefted granaries and other buildings. 

At this time, the expence of the navigation had far exceed- 
ed the original eftimate The whole of the money fub- 
fcribed by the proprietors, as well as the toll-dues hitherto 
received, and a fubfequent loan was expended, while the 
tonnage-dues did not much exceed L.400C annually. As 
there was therefore little probability, that the Canal would 
ever be carried forw^ard to join the Clyde, the (hares in 
the Company's (lock were frequently fold L. 50 per cent. 
under par. 

The Canal remained in this fituation until the year 1784, 
when the Company obtained an aid from Government of 
L. 50,000, from the annexed forfeited eftates in Scotland. 
Upon this aid, Government was to draw proportional di- 
vidends with the proprietors ; but the original fubfcribers 
■"were allowed to add the intereit on theii: advances. Ha-

ving received this affiftance, the Committee of Management 
again began with great fpirit in July 1786, to carry the 
Canal wcttward from Stockingfield towards the river 
Clyde, under the direftion of Mr Robert Whitworth. 
And although the moft arduous and difficult part of the 
undertaking was ftill to execute, yet, owing to his great 
abilities and unremitting attention, on the 28th of July 
179c, the navigation was opened from fea to fea. The 
Committee of Management, accompanied by the Magi- 
ftrates of Glafgow, were the firfljvoyagers on this navigation. 
On the arrival of the veffel at Bowling Bay, after defcend- 
ing the lad lock into the Clyde, the ceremony, of joining 
the EASTERN and WESTERN SEAS together, was performed 
by the chairman of the Committee, with the affiftance of the 
chief engineer Mr Whitworth, by the fymbol of launching 
a hoglhead of the water of the Forth into the Clyde, 
amidft the acclamations of a vaft number of fpeclators, who 
exprefled the greateft fatisfac^ion on the completion of a 
work which promifed 10 many advantages, not only to 
that part of the country in particular, but to the kingdom 
at large. 

The bafon at Hamilton Hill, having been found inade- 
quate for the reception of the great number of veffel^ 
which navigated the Canal, the Company parchafed 
eight acres of ground within half a mile of Glafgow, 
where they have made one on a inuch larger fcale, and 
likewife another- for timber and rafts of wood. Here they 
have built a commodious granary, as well as many other 
buildings, and are felling off the ground for a village, 
•which they have named Port Dundas. When the plan of 
this village is complete, it will exhibit one of the moft ex- 
traordinary fcenes to be feen, perhaps, in any country. It 
will ftand on the fide of a fteep hill ; when viewed from 

the 



of the forth and Clyde Navigation, 



the plain below, the houles and buildings will appear inter- 
mixed with trees, mafts, and fails, while 'no river or water 
is to be feen. From Port Dundas, the Company have 
formed a junction with a canal, which runs 12 miles to the 
eaft, to the collieries in the parifties of Monkland, and 
which bids fair in time to bring a confiderable addition to 
their revenue. This great undertaking, which was 
years in finifliing, was one of the moft arduous to execute 
in the kingdom. In its courfe, it palTes over rocks, preci- 
pices, and quickfands ; in fome places it runs through 
a deep mofs, and in others, it is banked 20 feet high. 
The Canal, in its courfe, croffes many rivulets and roads, 
as well as two confiderable rivers, the Luggie and the Kel- 
vin. The bridge over the latter confiils of 4 arches of ex- 
cellent mafon work, which carry the Canal over a valley 
400 feet long, and 65 feet deep •■, and, confidering the 
length, the width, and the weight of water it has to fuftain, 
may be juftly reckoned, the moft ftupenduous of its kind, 
in the world. This great inland navigation is fupplied 
with water by feven refervoirs, covering 409 acres of 
ground, and containing 12,679 lock- fulls of water; and 
when the increafe of the trade lhall require, the Company 
have it in their power to add two other refervoirs, capable 
of containing 15,958 lock fulls more. 

The affairs of this Company were originally under the 
direftion of two general meetings, one held.at London, and 
the other at Edinburgh ; each of whicii met quarterly, and 
the firft of thefe chofe a Committee of Management annu- 
ally. The two general meetings having iaterfered with 
each other, and their orders to the Committee of Manage- 
ment being fometimes contradictory, an aft of Parliament 
was pafled, in the year 1787, forming a new conftitution; 
whereby the diredion of the Company was placed in a 

Governor

Governor and Council in London, and a Committee of 
Management at Glafgow ; who meet monthly, or oftener 
as occafion may require. Both of thefe are chofen by a 
general meeting at London, in the month of March yearly. 

At the firft of January 1791, the Company had expend- 
ed in this undertaking above L. 330,000 ; the aquedudl 
bridge over the Kelvin alone having coft L. 8509. 

Since the year 1777, the tonnage and wharfage dues 
have been greatly on the increafe, but more particularly 
fo, fince the junction of the two feas in July 1790 ; as the 
communication between Ireland and the eaft fea is thereby 
fliortened above 800 miles. The grofe revenues this year 
(1792) are expected to exceed L. 14,000; in confequence of 
which, the original fliares in the Company's ftock are now 
felling 25 per cent, above par.
