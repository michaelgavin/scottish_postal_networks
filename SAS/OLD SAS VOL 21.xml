ADVE^LTISEMENT 



TO 



VOL. XXI. 



As this Volume contains the Additions and Con 
Rdions fent to the Author, together with a co- 
pious Index, the Statiftical Account of Scotland, is 
BOW as complete, as could poffibly be expelled, in the 
firft edition of fuch a work ; and Qothing now re- 
mainS) but to draw up an Analyfis of the Political 
State of Scotland, or, the refult of the whole en- 
quiry, which I propofe fetting about without delay. 

Tlie Reader will perceive, that there is no fepa- 
xate account of the Univerfity of St. Andrews; 
which, indeed, wa3 not eflentially necefTary, as Dr. 
Adamfon has given, in his very fatisFadory defcrip- 
don of the town and parifh of St. Andrews, a ihort, 
but diftin^ account of thac ancient feminary of 
learning. Nor is there any account of the Univer- 
fity of Edinburgh. For information on that fubjed, 
I muft beg leave, for the prefent, to refer, to the 
hiftories of the Metropolis of Sen. land, written by 
Maitland and Arnot. I have the fatisfadion, how- 
ever 



I 

I 



( vi ) 

ever, of adding, that ProfelTor Babel is drawing 
up an hiftorical work, on the Univerfity of Edin- 
burgh, which, from what I havefeen of it in ma* 
Burcript, promifes to be a very interefting and va- 
luable performance. 

I cannot conclude, without once more returning 
my beft acknowledgements to therefpeftable^fembers 
of the Church of Scptl^iqd, fo^: having enabled me to 
complete an undertaking, which certainly ftands unrU 
▼ailed for extent of ufeful information ; and which 
may be imitated, but, confidering the ability and 
exertions which they have exhibited on the occa^ 
fion, cannot be furpaffed, in any other country.

s . On peadipg Dr. Johnficm's Tery intelligent atcount.of Ho^ 
lywDod^ the foUowing remarksi and additions occitfTod : 

xjl. It does not fceni probable, that the name, cither of the 
tnonaftery cr the parifli, could be derived from any* grove of 
oak trees that mtght have furroundcd the Druidical temple^ 
-which the Doctor dfcfcrib^s : Becaufe, in the jJlr^ pUcc, the 
order of Druids, according to the befli acocmnts, had coaled 
in Scotland 7 oi* 8 centuries before the monaftcry was feuhd- 
cd 5 and of conicquence, any groves of their planting would 
have pcrifhed, and any holii*ft afcribcd to them been for- 
gotten, for fcveral ages prior to its foundation. *ido. When 
the order of Druids exifted, and "for jcnany years after it be- 
caune extin^, the Gaelic was tl\e general krguage, fiot on^ 
}y of Saotlandy but of the whole ifiand ', a^id it i$ hardly 
credible, thatl either the. founder of the monaAery^ or the 
monks that were to ferve in it, vrould have given a name to 
it, in the Sdxori language, tranflated from the ancient lan- 
guage of tlie country, which had then cc^ifed to be fpokeh 
for fome ages. 3/;o. The Druidical temple, iii queftioD^ 
iftands half a mile and rather more to the S. W. of the old

Sheep and JTiw/.— Under the article, '* Sheep and wool/' 
addf Calves and young iheep, not only come fooner to their 
fize when fed on turnip, but they rife to a far greater fizc 
than they would do if fed upon grafs, at leaft on the natur- 
"si grafs of the high lands ; and this no doubt b partly the 
reafon that cattle in the low country are generally of a lar- 
ger fize than in hilly diftri£ls.

17s. 6d. This laft kind is bj many dealers preferred to the 
white. One guinea was given for the wool of Pafton, lower 
in the country on the Englifh fide, and the higheft price 
given for wool on the horder; 19s. was but rarely given in, 
1790, when wool fold rather higher than it has ever been 
known to do. Of laid wool {even or eight fleeces go to the 
ftone ; of white wool nine or ten \ of the long wool near 
the foot of the water Kale, 4 or 5 fleeces go to the ftone^ 
and it (ells at i6s. per ftone. The farmers are under the ne- 
ceffity of going from home to feek a merchant for their com- 
modities. People of fubftance, moft commonly firom Eng- 
land, travel the country at a ftated feafon, for the pvirpofe of 
buying the wool, generally at the end of June or beginning 
of July. The price is ufually paid when the wool is bought^ 
or on a near day. The fame mode takes place with regard 
to the difpofal of the fheep at a different feafbn, which is 
ttfaally the end of harveft. People firom England, and the 
low country of Scotland, buy the ewes and wedders at this 
time of the year, for feeding fat on turnip through the win- 
ter. The wedder fheep fell about 5s higher each than ewes. 
It is generally fuppofed by the farmers in this diftrift that 
a manufaAory eftablifhed in this part of Scotland would be 
of confiderable advantage to the country. It is true there 
is a carpet manufactory at Hawick, but that makes ufe only 
of coarfe wool, and is generally fupplied with wool from the 
weft part of Scotland. There is alfo a manufaftory at Haw- 
ick and Galafliiels for cloth ; but, though flouriihing and 
highly creditable to the undertakers, yet they are eftabliflied 
on a finall fcale, and at a diftance from this part of the 
country where the beft wool ab6unds. Kelfo, or its neigh- 
bourhood, one WQtild imagine, ihould be a favourite fpot for 
that purpofe. TThe beft wool would be at command, and 
the carriage would be inconfidcrablc. The advantages to

the ooUDtrf would certainly be great. It Is a pity but that 
the gentleman of the Merfe and Teviotdale would take the 
hii^. They M-c by no means dcfc&amp;ive in public fpirit. Un- 
left fttch an undertaking be fupported by the lauded inter- 
eft, th^i¥ woii)J be little hope of fucccft. ' A private indivi- 
dual^ fearful of the event| -wiU not be willing to launch into 
ftt^ a wprk ^•^-i-^nd few, if they had fpirit, have the means 
requifite to carry it on with advantage. Such a plan, pro* 
^oriv c^ecutfrd, would facilitate very feisHbly the rife of the 
.vdue -ef land in this diflrid. It would at the fame time 
- obviate * c-onxplaint, perhaps juftly made by the farmers^ 
Ih^t thoiigl;^ the wool briags a good price, yet tliey receive 
not its ffiiU value, becauie there is no competition, but what 
arlfes fi^om. different perfons carrying wool to the fame

By a wanufaftory lb near too, the farmers might eafily 
eor»e to acquire the art of forting the wool properly, which 
might turn confidcrably to their emolunient^ 

A .ffla^L of this kind will not fail, it is to be Ixoped, to re* 
ceive affiftance, iliould the propofcd canal take place be- 
tween Kelfo and Berwick : a work which would alfo re- 
, dound to the great benefit of the country, fliould it be on* 
: ly to roufe a fpirit of enterprife in the nation. But other 
•. Qtvius advantages arc not wanting. The prafticability of 
; carrying the canal up the Teviot, as £p as Ancrum bridge, 
. is net diiputed, perhaps it may be carried much higher upr 
the river. Com, which is raifed in far greater quantities 
than is wanted for the fupply of liome confumption, by the(c 
meanS) would eafily be conveyed to Berwick, where there is- 
often a confidcrable demand for it, and which cannot be fent 
but at great expence, the diftance between Berwick and An-^

Ztate of the Churchy and of the P«w.-— With regard to the 
legal method of proviflon for the poor in Scotland, the 
mode of procedure obfcrved in this pariih is as follows— In» 
timation of the meeting is made from the defk by the clerk 
of the kirk fcfllon after divine fervicc. Ten free dajs in- 
tervene between the intimation and the meeting. On the 
day of meeting the heritors choofe a prefes The clerk thcii 
ftads over the minutes of the former fe4cnmt» All applica- 
tions of the poor are made to the prefes. To thofe, who, 
through accidental misfortune or difeafe, apply for fupport, 
is given interim fupply *, that is, fupply for that quarter on« 
Iji or fo long as the prefent occafion may require* The roll 
of the poor being made up, the nances arc read over by the 
clerk \ and each have a fum allotted to them according to 
their circumftanccs, as can be learned from the petitioners 
themfclves, the minifter, or any of the elders, or tenants prc- 
ient. The fum to each is marked oppofite to their names. 
The names being gone through, the amount is fummed, and 
ordered to be levied equally on the heritors and tenants. On 
the admiillon of any perfon on the roll, an inventory is taken 
by the clerk of his efFe6ls, which th^n become the property 
of the heritors. The money thus rfilflld is levied by the 

clerk.

ckrfc, anJ put into the hands of two or three perfons chofen 
annually as overfeers for the poor.^ Thefc perfons living in ' 
dificrent parts of the parifli, the money is fpcedily and faith- 
fully diftributcd to the poor. The minifter alone, if nobody 
attends according to the intimation, can aiTefs for the poor. 
They are not fuffered to want on account of the negligence 
of heritors, and the deed of the minifter is valid. 

The weekly colleftions in the church are, by law^ the pro- 
perty of the fcfGon, for behoof of the poor 5 and are ufually 
^ven to fuch as are known by the minifter and elders to be 
in ncceffitous circumftances, and who tlarough modefty do 
not apply for the legal provi/ioh. 

There are no records of the poor rates farther back than 
the year 1749. That year 10 names are on the roll. The 
higheft fum given to one perfon per quarter is 9s : the total 
fum is L.'3 : 3. The lift of names from that time does not 
much increafe; fome years it decrcafes. In the year 1756, 
a year of great fcarcity, the names on the roll are 1 1, and 7 
to whom interim fupply is given ; in nil 1 8. The total fup- 
ply is L. 9 : 1. But the heritors, at fame time, uplifted money 
belonging to the poor, and out of that fund they bought up 
oat meal and bear-meal, and fold it to the poor on the roll, 
and to others who could produce a line from the minifter of 
their ncceffitous fituation, at 2d per ftone below market price. 
In the year 1759, the price of viftual was greatly fallen. Thofc: 
on the roll being only 9, and for interim fupply 4 ; the fum 
to the whole is L. 4 : 16. In the year 1767, the number of 
poor IS 14; the fum aflcfled for L.3 : 16. In the year 17&amp;3, 
a yenr alfo of fcarcity, the number of poor is 19, including 
thofe for interim fupply 5 the fum affclTd 1^.I2 : 10 : 3. In 
1784, the number of poor is 14 •, *the fum afljfled L. 10 : 1 1. 
In 1790, the number of poor is 13; the fum afleflcd

From the above account, it appears that the number of

lowed them.

this was not given by me. I was rather furprifed when I

Caujis of Depoffulaticn.^'As the number of births, from the 
Union to about the time of the laft rebellion, acccording to 
the records of the feffion, was diminiihed, it is natural to 
fuppofe that the number of inhabitants was. diminished in the 
fame proportion. This diminution may eafily be accounted 
for, from the free and fafe communication which the Union 
immediately opened, between two formerly hoftile and con. 
tending nations. By the union of the two crowns and the 
tiro parliaments, an open intercourfe would take place, na- • 
tLonal antipathies would ceafe, the efieAs of intereil and am- 
bition would operate, and the refult would be, as was eafily 
forefeen, that many would emigrate from the poorer to the 
richer country. This fpirit of emigration might be increafed 
by a law in our natures, which leads men in cafes where they 
have been reflrained in any great degree to run, where it h 
in their power, to an oppoiite extreme. 

The above is a^avfe no doubt affignable for the decrease 

of 



id General Appendix to • [VoK i. 

of inhabitants on this fide of the border at large during the 
period here referred to. But 1 believe it is not the caufe of 
the late great depopubtion. The emigration from either iidc 
feeifis to be mutual. It is fomewhat remarkable thatTeveral 
of the fhepherds, and fome of the moft fubftantial farmers in 
the parifli have come over to refide here from the Englifh 
fide. This however does not in general happen in othfcr pa- 
rities -, and I know not in any inftance, that an individual 
from the Scottifli fide, has emigrated to England, (I mean in ^ 
this diftria of pariflaes,) and fettled there as a refident farmer^ 
althongh many rent fmall farms in England, which often fuit 
well for railing young iheep, to be afterwards laid on the large 
forms here. 

The number of deaths in the parifli is to the births as 4 
to 12: there muft be an increafe therefore, at leaft, of 8 
fouls every year to the parifh. This would foon occafion a con- 
fideruble furplus of inhabitants more than could be accom- ^ 
modated with houfes, or with the means of life : they there-  
fore muft feparate and difperfc annually in all dircftioBS j 
fome to the towns and villages of the neighbourhood, fome ' 
to England, where fervants wages are rather higher than in 
Scotland, and fome to America and the Indies. 

The great and moft obvious caufe of the decreafc of the 
inhabitants, within the laft thirty or forty years, is owing 
to the (perhaps too general) pra5tice of letting the lands ia 
great farms, and to the mode of agriculture now almoft 
univerfally adopted, efpecially fince flicep and wool brought 
fo high a price, of laying down the whole lands in grafs. 
The lands formerly, from 40 to 100 years. back, were par- 
celled out into four times, at leaft, the prcfent number of 
forms : there was alfo much of thefe farms in tillage : and 
confequently a greater humber of people could be main- 
tained, sind more hands would be neceflSry for carrying on

the labour of the lands. So late as the year 17561 there 
vere no fewer than (even tenants^ with large families^ on the 
lands of Hoiinam, now all rented by one tenant, who em- 
plop only one Ihepherd, There were alfb ieveral fmall 
lairds : their lands are loft in the large £uinst their names 
CTrinpiiflied» and their manfions confounded »jn the duft. 

Though this kft caufe operates nuft ftrongly in dqpopu** 
htisg the ptfllhes where the monopoly of farms is freqaent» 
jet it is by fooie made a queftion whether it tends to depo«« 
palate the country at large in any great meafure* No doubt the 
towns and villages will inoreafe as the country pariflies di- 
minifli } and therefore, in this diihiA, the villages of Tet- 
bohn and Mortxittle have of late confiderably augmented in 
tbe number of inhabitants and houfes : yet it does not feem to; 
be in the fame proportion as die country diftri^b around them 
bave^Bniniihed. In this parifhy wherethe real rent is L.27209 
were the farms fiur tiiaes the prcfeat number, namely 56, 
^ the lands divided into farms of L.50 each, which would

It is obfervablcy that in England^ which is far more popu- 
lous and richer than Scotland, the monopoly of farms is lit- 
tle known. In many places of Scotland^ particularly th» 
diftridl to which Hounam belongs, a fingk individual has 
not only united four or five farms into one, in on^ parilby 
but has federal farms united in this manner, in difierent pa«» 
rilhes. Theie circumAances taken together furely make 
it very evident, that the monopoly of farms, and iacreafe 
ef pafturage, is a great injury tQ the papulation of the 
country at large, 

ff02^x.«-^As the number of inhabitants has rapidly AU 
minifhed, of courfe there are many empty houfes in the 
parifli, and many have of late been demcdi/hed. In the 
year 17759 there were no fewer than nine houles, with cot- 
tagers in them, at a place called Mainfide, aU of whom I 
vifited on my admiffion. In one year after, or two at moi^ 
the whole of them were thrown down, to make way for • 
£ngle furmhoufe and its offices* The farmers, too, paying 
more attention to their iheep wa^s than firmerly, wilt 
hardly allow a fingle houfe to ftaad on any part eiS their 
£irm, except fuch as are neceflkry for their ihqhen!Ps ac«

only one, and that one not very much finequented. The

from being good. Whiiky, in particular, is fo cheap, and in

Duke of Buccleugh's efbite ten tenants ; on the laird of Had- 
den*s four ; oh Sir George Douglas's eftate two. The intra- 
trodudtion of turnips, which takes place in every farm in a 
greater or lefs degree according tp the drynefs of the foil, has 
contributed greatly to improve the foil, and to bring great 
profit to the farmer ; producing, when fed off by flieep, at a 
mean price, L.3 per acre, and afterwards fine crops of barley, 
oats, and (pring wheat. It is not above twenty years fince 
this improvement has taken place* 

There \&amp; a very large common in En^and, called Wark Com- 
mon, to which the farmer at Sedan, belonging to the Duke 
of Roxburgh^ all the tenants of Hidden, and aU the tenants 
of the Duke of Buccleugh, have a right to pafture flieep and 
young cattk. About fixty years ago, this right was difputed 
by the tenants of the Earl of Tankerville and Sir Henry Grey 
of Howick; they drove away to Wark the beafts belonging to 
the Scotch farmers, who maintained their right by force, go- 
ing in a body with their fervants armed with clubs, and, after 
broken heads on both fides, recovered their cattle, and fent 
them to the common, where they have paftured unmolefted 
to this day. I have converfed with farmers who aAed as 
principals in this fray. This common is very large, and com- 
prehends in it feveral miles. There are plain veftiges of its 
having been cultivated with the plough \ and ve^y fit it is for 
that purpofe.

roodhoufe had the direction of this chapel, and that the 
Duke-s property in the parifh once belonged to the town of 
Edinburgh ; certain it is that the Duke pays yearly L. 34 fter-

more numerous formerly, and who ftill pay a fmall rent year-

which the prefent Dul^e draws a very confideraUe rent. Ma« 
ny of theie cottars have been deprived of their houfes, and

was depoied foon after the rebellion in 1715 for fuppofed Ja«

There is an eftabliflicd fchoolmafter in Sproufton. Of latc 
the heritors have augmented his falary from lOo merks to 
100 pounds Scots. He has, at a medium, forty fcholars, ia- 
ftni£kd in reading, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, and 
menfuration. His wages are very low \ a ihilting a quarter 
for reading, and eighteen pence for writing and arithmetic. 
There is a fchoolmafter at Hadden, paid only the intereft of 
io«o pounds Scots, arifing from xooo merks, mortified by 
Lady Yefter, and afterwards augmented by" Sir Gilbert £llioc 
pf Stobs, then proprietor of Hadden. 

The tenants of Lempetlaw contribute to obtain a teacher 
of their children, being too remote from the pariih fchool. 

There are three alehoufes in the pariih ; one at the fefry- 
boitt, one at a toll bar, another lately in Spipudon j yet little 
frequented by the inhabitants, who are of a fober induilrious 
charaAcr, yet complained of as a haunt for vagrants. With- 
m thefe twenty years, the Duke of Roxburgh has built eight 
ianners houfes, with office-houfes for them, and many coN 
tagcs ; the Duke of Buccleugh fix farm houfes ; the laird of 
Hadden three ), Sir G, Douglas two. 

There has been no perfon in the parish confined to jail or 
corporally puniihed during my incumbency, except a few wo* 
nen, who refcued a young man unjuftly prefied, during the 
war carried on in def mce of our colonies. 

Farmers now prefer generally carrying on their huflandry 
by cottagers, who are obliged to furnifii a female {hearer to 
hoe turnips and to work during hay time, to hired fervants, 
who arc dieted in their houses. There are feveral ruinous 
tiodes in the village of Sproufton, chiefly the Duke's cottars. 
There is an excellent freeftone qunrry on the Duke of Rox-

arc lefs frequent than formerly, owing, I fuppofe, to their eat- 
ing more animal food. 

There is a difpcnfary at Kclfo, to which the poor are re- 
commended by the minifter, the feffion paying to it one gui- 
nea yearly. 

The fchoolmafter's income, including all his perquiiites^ 
does not exceed apl. fterling yearly. 

Hiere is a great ftore of lime ftone on the Duke of Rox- 
burgh's eftate, and that of Hadden. The laird of Hadden 
has laft year built a draw kiln for burning limeftone, which 
will be very profitable, worth, it is fuppofed, 300I. or 400I. 
yearly. Two of the Puke of Roxburgh's tenants burn lime- 
ftone for their own ufe. During the Duke's minority, a draw- 
kiln was built in the village of Sproufton ; but, to the great 
comfort of the mhabitants, the limeftone foon run out, and k 
continues ufclefs, though the ftones when fold would pro- 
duce a confiderable fum. 

When I was fettled here, there was not a cart belonging to 
% tenant. The corn was carried to the place of fale on the 
back of horfes \ the dung led to the field, and the com to 
the barn-yard, in wains drawn by oxen. Now every farmer 
has carts. I believe my cart was the firft ufed in the parifli. 
For feveral years paft I have had none, but have every part of 
hufbandry, and the leading of coals from England, done hj 
hire ; as I could get no land to cultivate, and the keeping of 
two horfes and a mare coft more money than the profit aris- 
ing from the glebe. The raifing of potatoes in the fields, 
which has taken place fince my fettlement here, and which is 
now very general, has been a great blefiing to the inhabitants. 
Every farmer almoft allows his cott&amp;gers to fet potatoes ; and 
many of them let fomc acres for that purpofe at a very high, 
ycnt. I let every yealr a part of my glebe to the inhabitants

a good crop of wheat in fucceflion. I reckon 4ut above 200 
bolls of this root are coniumed by the inhabitants of this vil- 
lage, in their diet, and in the feeding of fwine, which they 
kill for their own ufe« Mr. Stevenfon, then of Mongrenan, 
in the fhire of Air, who about 15 years ago reiidedat IVIarlc^ 
field, to manage Mr Nifbet of Dirleton's affairs, brought firom 
that county a fpecies of potatoes of an excellent quality, and 
pleafant to eat, and very whokfome, which is now preferred 
to every other kind for human ufc : it is hot^ very large, but 
very produ^ve, and lies .near the furface in a round form* 
Without this valuable root, many families of induftrious la-

EKtent and Form of the Part/h.-^Thc prefcnt parifli of Ayr 
tvas formerly divided into two, Ayr and Alloway. Ayr, in- 
cluding the town and Borrowficld, was a collegiate charge 
from the Reformation. The other half made the feparate 
parifli of ADoway ; which, having but a fmall ftipend, was, 
about the beginning of the prefent century, annexed to Ayr, 
and its ftipend divided between the two collegiate miniftcri 
of that pariih. The ruins of Alloway church arc yet to be 
feen, near the old bridge of Doon. 

The river Doon, near its mouth, has, at fomc former pe- 
riod iince the divifion of tho county into pariihes, altered its 
channel. For, befides the marks of its old courfe, there is 
now on its north fide a farm of fome extent, named Ccming* 
park, which muft have been formerly on the fouth fide, in 
the parifh of Maybole, to which it ftill belongs. It may not 
be eafy to account for this alteration, whether it was the 
pure work of nature, or afiifted by art. But it is certain 
the river now empties itfelf into the fea in a much ftraighter 
courfe than by its former channel. 

Within a quarter of a mile of its mouth, a paper mill 
has been lately ereAed, on the fbuth fide, by David Earl of 
Cafiillis ; and, a Kttle above that, a fine ftone bridge, of on* 
arch, was thrown over by his brother Thomas the pth Earl. 
This bridge is little more than half a mile below the old one i

E. to W. is litde lefs than 6 miles ; its greateft breadth^ from 
N. to S. is between 3 and 4 miles ; and from thence it lef- 
fens gi^dually towards the weft till it comes to the fhore» to 
one mile and a half. The foil is nowhere rocky, but for 
the moft part deep and wet, and not very fertile naturally \ 
yet every part of it is improveable, and generally mnch- im- 
proved of late years, both in refpeA of crops and elegant 
plintations« There are no lime quarries in the parifh $ but 
they have lately found, in fome places of the higher grounds, 
a kind of Uue n)arle, which has been ufed with fuc;eis. 
There is much limeftone daily imported from Irelandy in the 
coal veflels. 

Agncidture^^h2s made great progref» here as wdl as in 
other parts of the country, within the laft thirty or forty 
years. The lands of Alloway, being the full half of the pre- 
fent country parifli of Ayr, were formerly pofieflied by te- 
nants at the yearly rent of is, 3d. per acre, whieb they were 
not able to pay, and often became bankrupts and beggars. 
In.thc year 1755, thcfe lands were fold by the town to pri- 
vate proprietors, who continue to pay the anttent rent as a 
perpetual feu-duty, and the fale produced a capital of Ij,']2oo*^ 
Since that^ period, the lands have been brought into good 
cultivation, and are now finely. indofed, and adorned with 
plantations . and country feats ; Roflell, Doonholm, Grecn« 
ficU, Mount-Charks, Bcllifle, &amp;c. 

The lands of Borrowfi6ld the other divifion of the coun- 
try parifh of Ayr^ feem to have, been alienated from the 
town at fome far diftant period, when money was extremely 
fcarcc J for though they ftill pay a feu-duty, it is a mere trifle, 
compared with what is paid for the AUowa; lands..

There is fcarcc any part of the parHh .which is not arable, 
and moft of it aAually bears crops, chiefly of oats ; yet it is 
by no means ^ble to fttpply itfdf, including the townj with 
provilions. Large iupplies, both of vegetable and animal 
food, are brought in from all the neighbouring country, 
from Galloway, and often from Ireland. Qoyer aiid rye 
grafs are frequently fown with great profit. 

Hie town has ftill in its pofleffion a finall ftripe of pafture 
ground along the fands, for.about a quarter of a mile to die 
S. ; as alfo at fome diftance to the S. £. a cammon, of be- 
tween 80 and 90 acres, for feeding milk cows, and free ta 
every burgefs. The greateft part of the common to the S. 
a large circular field, has been of late inclofed with a good 
ftone wall, which has imipediately within it a fine race courfer 
The field has likewife been cleared of whins or furae. 

The whole land rent of the parifh amounts at preient ta 
about L.37CO fterling; and the extent is faid to be fomc- 
thing more than 5000 acres. 

Though the climate is healthy, many examples of that ex« 
traordinary longevity, which are reported from other placesj^ 
cannot be produced.* Several perfons among us are above 
80 years, and we have four at«prefent on the borders of pa.. 
It is faid that, in the year 1745, one of the inhabitants, at 
*the age of 1 14, walked firom Ayr to Leith, and there took 
fhipping for London, where he died, after a ftay of only twa 
months. The town ftands on a dry iandy foil, and has fields 
adjoining, than which, none, can be fitter for. walking, or 
for the diverfions of racing, golfing, .&amp;c. Evtry one has. 
eafy accefs to the turf, covered at allieafbns with a beautiftil 
verdure, and in Spring and Summer • adorned with w&amp;d

almoft quite acrofs the mouth of it. This, however, is ia 
part cleared away, when the river happens to be greatly fwcU- 
ed bj rains ; fometimes it is necefTary to dredge it ; and the 
inconvenience is likely to be further remedied, by a good 
ibne wall, built on both fides of the river, which is now car- 
rying on, and more than half iinifhed. Formerly the fouth 
fide of the river, Jeyond tjic Quay, was fenced by large trian- 
gular wooden boxes, filjed with ftones. But thefe were found 
to be voy expenfive, by the frequent repairs which they wan* 
ted } and therefore, an atten^pt has of late been made, and is 
already far on in the execution, to procure the iame con- 
venience, by building, inftead of wopden boxes, a wall of the 
fame height, but entirely of ftone, perpendicular on the fide 
next the river, and floping off on the other fide. This, It is 
hoped, will anfwer the fame end, and be more durable. lu 
the courfe of laft year, there were built at fome diftancc from 
pnc another, but uniting in a line when viewed from the bar, 
two reflcfting light houfes, to direft ihips into the entrance 
of the river. From the niouth of the river fouthward, near- 
ly in a direft line, and about a quarter of a mile diftant from 
one another, there lie four different heaps of large ftones; of 
which three are ,always to be ieen at about half tide, but the 
fourth or northmoft ooe, only at feme very low ebbs. Thefe 
ftones, being many of ^em of great weight, and all of them 
loofe and unconnected, are lifted by grappling irons fixed to 
a crane, and coaveyed on pontoons, and are found to be ufc- 
fiil materials for fencijig the river, on both fides, by the walU^ 
fonneriy mentioped.

plenty of falmon^ at leaft for home confumption every year, 
and a great variety of excellent white fifli, cod, ling, had- 
docks, whitings, {kate, flounders, &amp;c. No fhell fiQi, except 
3 few crabs and lobfters. Cod are in ftafon from the end of

cftaft of Scotland. They uftd to ftll their fifii for a penny 
per pound, *till a man came from Edinburgh of late, and of- 
fered them lid. for all that they could fpare. They likewife 
fend large fupplies to Kilmarnock, Irvine, Paifley, and Glaf- 
gow. They catch their fifh by long lines with hooks and 
bait$ fixed on them, at proper diftances, and fluik to the bot- 
tom with weights at either end. The falmon fifhing is ma- 
naged by people of this country ; and there are feven^ coblcj 
or fifhing boats, ufually employed with four men for each 
boat, three for the river of Ayr, and four for the Doon, but 
more or fewer as occafibn requires. Tlicy arc permitted to 
ufe fi:^ for each of the rivers, if needful. The falmon fifhing 
at the mouth of Doon, which belongs to the Earl of CafHlis, 
pays a rept pf L. 90 per annum, and there is a cruive about 
fix miles up the river,' which pays L. 13 more. The fifhing 
of Ayr river formerly belonged to Sit Thomas Wallace of 
Craigie, but is now the property of the focifcty of writers in 
Ayr i and is rented at L. 85, together with the payment of

the Boworhill, or. Heads of Ayr *, and another not fo high^ 
about half a mile farther eaft, called Greenan, with the re»

CZv/rr^.— The prcJent church of Ayr was built in 1654; 
and might Icontainj if well fiUed, near 2000^ litters. The 
old church, nlix\ied St.. John Baptift's, of whrch only the 
tower oV fiecple now remains, ftood on the other fide of 
the town, next the fea, in what k called the Citadel. But 
Oliver Cromwell, judging it proper to build a fortrefs at thi# 
place, for keeping the weft country in awe, tbok poflcffioii 
of St. John's Church for an armoury, and, by ¥ray of com- 
penfation, gave the tpwn 1000 m^ks Engtifh for building 
another. — ^Tfce walls of the Citadel inclofe about lo or 12 
acres of ground, and were originally furroundecf with a wet 
ditch, which had a draWbriclge over it on the fide next the 
town. It was a very regular fortrefs, with four baflions'^ 
three wells, a magazine, a fallyport, &amp;c. ;*but built at £0 
great expcnce, that the Protcftor, w"Een he had tlic account 
laid before him, al^ed if it was built of lilver. For it feems 
na ftone quarries near Ayr were then known ; and the ftonc^ 
employed in building the Citadel were all brought from fome 
diftance by fea, and partly, it is faid, from tlie caftle of Ar- 
droifan, belonging to the Earl of Eglihton. After the Rc- 
fioration, therefore, the £arl ai£:ed, ahdT obtained 'a grant of 
the Ctadel of Ayr from the Crown, to* indemnify him, ixi

took place, even when they were moft in fafhion. 

The people in general are hmnane and charitable, live 
comfortably, and are contented with their circumftances. 
Their morals in many inftanccs have fuffcrcd by the prafticc 
cf finuggling, which is not yet entirely fuppreffed in this

lives of this place, who were diftlnguiflicd in the republic of 
letten. Only in the 9th century it produced the famous John 
acot, firnamcd Erigena^ or bom in Ayr, to diftingui(h liint 
from a former bom at Melrofe, and from another born in 
the 13th century in the to^Tn of Dunfc, Erigcna is faii to 
nave excelled all the men of his time» in the knov/Iedge of 
Janguages and phUofo'phy, as alfo in acutehefe of judgment^ 
readinefs of wit, and fluency of elocution. He ftudied at 
Athens, lived in grdat favour with Charles the Bald of France, 
and wrote many books upon different points of philofop^y 
and theology, of which fomc remain at this day. To hiui 
may be added AAdrew Ramfay, better known by the name 
of Chtwdier Ramfayy the author of Cyrus's Travels, and otlier 
works. And laftly, Robert Bums, the poet, born in the 
country part of the p^rifli of Ayr, and by his genius at Icaft,' 
as much diftinguifhcd as cither of the former authors.

A lime quarry has been found in this parifli, excellent in 
its quality, and promifes to be very great in quantity j the

of great confequence to the proprietor, and to this whole 
pariQi and neighbourhood, as formerly lime was brought at 
^a great expcnce, and of courfe iii fmall quantities. There 
is abundance of coal to burn the lime ; and the foil of thi^

<p>To^ fatisfy yoy concerning the number of oyr paupers—^ 
that we have no more than ,two receiving charity, is a certain^ 
faA, both (dd women, and widows; and what is ftill more^ 
one of them does not properly belong to us, but to a neigh- 
bouring parifh, and came to refide with a daughter married 
to a labouring man here. A few years ago, I hinted to Mr: 
Howlett a rcafon why we have fo few paupers here, viz. Wc 
have neither brewers, nor beggars, nor baftards, nor bank- 
rupts \ but a fober, frugal and laborious people'; no idlers, 
nor drunkards \ every family brew their own beer ; no fcc- 
taries. We have indeed a family or two with a number of 
young children that ^e occafionall}^ relieve whh fmall fiims ; 
and it is fometimes ^ith diiHculty that they will be prevailed 
upon to accept of theip, but np Ipngg: than they can do fo^ 
themfelves, which is often at a very early age.</p>

AddHkml Comtrtunicisims frzm the RH), John Frafer, 1790.</head> 

<p>The funds fo^ the fupport of the poor in this, soul I be^ 
lieire hi alxnofl: all the pariilies in this part of the Country^ 
arife from the Toluntary cQlle&amp;ioils at the d^urch 4oor oar 
Sabbathj fro^i ^he proclamstfion and mortdoth mOnej^ to^' 
gether with tihe intcTcft of any fm^l fum tliat may have beeri- 
faved. 

The expeaces for the fupport of the poor, in this psoifh,- 
are lefs at prefent, than they were 30 or 40 years ago. This I 
can afcertain from written accounts kept at the two periods 
refpeAively. Ftom the feffion record, which juft now lies 
before me, I find that the fum diftributed among the peoi^ 
of this parifh from 1750 to 1760 amounted exa£Uy to L.220' 
fterling, and the number of families annually reKeved by thisr 
fum I find to be generally 13. From the fame record, i 
£nd that the exa6t f^m diifaib'uted among them from 1780 
'to 1790 amounted only to L. 178, and that th^ aoxtiber of - 
^'families relieved by it were alfo about 13. It i$ neceilary 
^ to expWnthe r^afpn of thb difference. From 174a to 1760^ 
the heritors met quarterly, and" aflefled themfelves for \\\€ 
fupport of the poor, in proportion to their r«fpeSive po^ 
feffions in the parifh : but this wife regulation was' foon at 
%tT dropt, through Ac negligence of the then tninJftcr ofThc " 

parifh.

paiiik, and has Bever been revived to thk daf; and conie-» 
quently our poor have been fb(pported by the above fpecifiedf 
fum fat thefe ten years^ becaofe We kiid no more to give 
them. 

The minifter and his elddrs ki^ow the partictiiar fituatioit 
6f eveiy individual poor pevibii in the parifh ; and confer 
quently xrc are in no danger of being impofed upon by idle 
daimants. We oiadce it indeed a part of i^iir bofinefs to get 
acquainted with th^ elfcmnftances of pobr people in the de- 
dine of life ; and if we can turn to any account the Utile in*' 
duiby compatible With their finntioni we never fail to do it 
by pointing otit to them fomcf kind of employment. There 
IS one regulation^ however, which has been followed in this' 
parifh fbr thefe cfaany yesfts, which has been attended with 
the happieft eHe^ It is this— ^when any perfon* applies' 
to be taken on the poors roll, we always make them fign a 
bond, in which they bequeath all thdr clkSa d every kind 
to the ie£Bon. If they kave a young (family at their death. 
We gei3ferally expofe all their boufehold i&amp;tenfils to fale, and 
empio;^ the xAoney in bringing up the children and i^ctting 
them to imSncfk \ and if they leave no young children be«« 
hind them, but have 6ther poor relations advanced in life, 
St is generally given to them according to their neceffities^ 
I fiiould have obfefved before, thai, when the^ (ign the 
bond, tre tate an inventory of all their efifeAs ; and if any 
liuQg be wanting at their death, the rehtions or friends who^ 
haiK been going about them mtft aceetmt to u^ for ti!. This 
^gulation 1 have always rigoroufly sidhered t6 ; and . have 
Aerebf prevented ieveiU idlers from booming ^ burden 
nponthei^ih. 

The crop of 1 7 81 was ttemarkably deficient ; and, from Ac 
feffion records, I find that there were L. 40 fterling diftribu-' 
ted among the poor of ibis pari£b in 1783. The landed 

proprietors

proprietors nobly ftept forth for the fupport of their pboret 
brethren in that calamitous year. In foine parifhcs, they 
fent money to kirk feifions to be diftributed ^iccording td 
the neceffities of the poor. In others, they imported grain 
firom foreign countrids, and fold it out t6 them at a reduced 
price. The fcarcity of that year has had no efied on ouf 
voluntary coUeAions at the church door; they dre much the 
fame at prefent that they were then: neither has it tended 
to render the people left fenipubus in applying for parifh 
•fupport; 

There were Very few fedarifis in tliis parifli 40 years ago^ 
at prefent' they amount to 99. The defpottfm of the law of 
patronage had driven greslt numbers, and is ftili driving more 
and more every year frim the eftablifhed church. Theie fee* 
tarifts never contribute one £lrthing towards the fupport of 
our poor. We make however no diftindion between thenf 
and our own pebple j trhcn they M into diftrefi^ they ob- 
tain fupplles from the ordinary parifh funds, in the fame pro- 
portion with thofe of Our own community. From the feffionr 
records, I fee that the fe^brifts have all along been tbe great « 
eft burden tipon our funds. There are four families df ibcai 
at this prefent moment, each of whdm hate Ixien x^ceiving 
annually 408; fterling fcnr thefe 26 years; It i^ of juftice then; 
and the call of humanity that they fhoujd contribdte towards 
the maintenance of our poor, in the fame proportion witb 
the reft of the inhabitants of the parifli* But under the pare* 
fent exifting laws, there is no way of bringing them in bat 
by a pfurochial afleffinent upon the heritors and hdufeholders^ 
and this I am vb^ averfe to on many accounts, but paefticu- 
larly, becaufe I am perfuaded that it tends to.enCeOurage idle- 
nefs and vice among the tower claflTes ef the people. The: 
dread of poverty is the great, and- almoft cmiy incentive tor

inoft, a very icanty iabfiftence. Idlenefs, th«dPe£ore, mnft 
yield to exertion ia ord^ to better their cimdition ; and thus 
they are prevented from falling into that toipid ftate fo na- 
tural to men wfaa are void of ambition. At the fiuiie timi; 
it is quite equitable tl^t men of att ranks and denominations 
ihould contribnte their mite for ^le relief of the poorer bre- 
thren of their nature. But tl^ is hr from being the cafe in 
Scotland at prefent. Of the 99 fe&amp;uifts ii^ this parifli, not 
oDe of them, as I l&amp;ve already otaGnrvedi contribute one far- 
t^g tear the ibpport of our poor. The cpIle^Uons at the 
doors of their different meeting houfes, go entirely to fupport 
their own cloggy; a iet of men' who are not only a ufelefs 
burden upon fociety, but pernicious alfo to the morals of 
the people, by preaching antinbmian do£bines, and by which 
diey looien their obligations to reai. virtue* We have like- 
wile 9 heritors in this parilh, yrho are nearly as blameabk in 
this reipefi as the feAaiifts. None of them refide in the pa- 
rifh ; and, except what they contributed in 17^3, tbey have 
not given us a iingle penny' for the reUef. of the poor thefe 
20 years. The burdeli of maintainii^g them ]k^ entirely up-

creafe in ihipping fince that period, and alfo from the te- 
Slants and proprietors having fewer cottars upon their grounds 
than formerly— this I think a bad plan, and an evil attend-

<p>fix the month of Fcbruaiy i79i there was fent to yoir air 
account of the parifh of Kirkinner, foch as I -could make 
out at the time, with a drift regard, I am conicious, to the 
true ftate of fafks, as far as after Tome coniiderable pains to- 
be well informed, they were known to nae. Not doubting^ 
that yoo would make the beft de of the materiab I had fent, 
^igreeably to ttic plan aAd laudable defign of your ftatiftical 
nndercakingt I thought no more on the matter^ until^ in the: 
month of OAober. I»ft« I was infonned, by a letter from » 
friend) that n^yaapae ftood as a voucher for ibme very ex^ 
traordinary jparticalars rektiog to this pariih. This induced 
^e to apply for that volume of your work ia which you havc^ 
puUilhed the account of thb {Sarifh. k is in the 4th voiume« 
In page 140 of that volume, you pnbliflv tot the world, un^^

are really found in the lake. But it is oerta^niy long fince I 
ItU^e been fo ignorant as not to know jfchat pjke and herrings 
never met alive in the fame waters. By what mifdttnce,^or by 
what humour, certainly more wanton than eitter candid or be-

been rejected as that of a fool or of a liaf. But if, upon 

looking into the MS. you find, as furely you muft find, that 

I the flrange aflertion complained of is not mine*, you can 

I have no objection to acknowledge that no fuch aflertion is

lifli nothing {o mtich as ridicttle, and feel a pleaflng exultak

fiirdity of their ^ghbour. Among fuch minds, the her« 

rings of Loch-Dowalton have attraficd more attention than 

all the reft of the papery which indeed was neither defigned 

nor itiiied to attr^ any notice to the writer, but prefented 

fome other 6b)e£h, perhaps not unworthy the ileady regards 

of humanity. Hu^ writer ocdy feeb it as a misfortune to be 

caUed to defend himfelfagainft a charges fb fix)lifhr that even 

the defence feems to be iblly« The merry oncs^ will continue 

to laugh, and graver humanity will £eel for him. As thoie 

who pofiHs this ch^rader are the chief objeQs of bis efteem, 

he will be fatisfied with not forfeiting theirs, which- he hopes 

never to do by any breach of truth. As to the rcfl, you, 

I Sir, perhaps have read an anecdote of a French gentleman,

thus : ' The extent of the coafl along the frith of Cree is about 
' three miles ; it is flat and. fleetchy.' I know of no ground 
in this pariih that can properly be called either wafle or Com- 
mon. It is all property, and all in ufe for tBhge or pafture* 
Thete i^ indeed a narrow flrii^ along the frith lately cut oft

<p>The avqn^e fum expended in maintaining the poor is

pnnot be exa£Qy afcertained. But, making a proper allow- 
ance for it, and alfo for all adventitious circumftances of this 
kmd, L. 43 : 4 per annum at an average would be fufficient, 
which is precifely L. 5 fterling for each hundred of perfens 
in the parifh. From having fixed this point on my own per- 
fonal knowledge, I am enabled to go a little farther. If you 
fuppofo the population of Scotland tp amount to 1,500,000 
'perfonsj then by the above computation of L. 5 fterling for 

each 



t» General Jffendlx t$ £ Vol hr. 

l^ach iiundred of pezibas, It will ^akc L. 7$|Oco to maintakt 
tfa£ parochial {oor in this p^it of the iflaad ; a fum which 
one would think altogether ipfufficiepti comparing it wid\ 
the expence of fupporting the poor in England, where I ft^ 
pofe there are 7,ooojOoe of people. By xxxj conqnitation it 
would require only L. 350,000 to ftipply the* poor of £ng-i 
knd, inftead of L. a^pop^ooQj which I am informed is the 
fum it really cofb. 

To a gentleman of your penetration^ I oeed not obfervet 
that were real objefb^ of charity only to Fe%ive relief in their 
own houfes^ and to that extent only which is nece^ary, a 
great (urn might be faved to the country, a Aim more than 
fufficient for the building pf bridewells an^ work houfes for 
the idle and difiblute, and alfo fir improving every acne of 
wafte land in Great Britain \ a fum which, as at prefent ap- 
plied, tends to retard, rather than to accelerate the general 
intcrcfts of focicty. 

I think the poor in general are well provided for in Scot-^ 
}and, at a moderate expence. There are indeed many beg^ 
gars who walk from door to door and aft relief*, but this is 
not fo much from neceiCty as from profligacy, and a defire 
to wander, lather than to be fuppor^ed on a fixed refidence 
by the pariihes to which ibey belong. 

The poor c^ this parifh have been almoft always fupported 
by vQltmtary contributions \ w}iei| that mode fails, however^ 
or is likely to fail, which wa^ the cafe jbr the frft time in 
1757, application is made to the Earl of Uopeton, the (bie 
proprietor of this pariih, who grants an a^flment generaUy 
to the amount of L. 20 flerling \ the one half to be paid by 
himfelf, the other by Iiis tenants in proportion to their rents, 
fis law diredts % and when an afleflment has been neceflary, it 
has noj hitherto been fcrupled neither by the proprietor nor 
\^ tcnant^ fof if i( were^ application might be made to the 

Iheriff

Iheriff of tbc county, who is warranted by law to interpofe 
liis authority. 

The ezpence of maint;uning the poor vtt this parifh has en- 
crea(ed within the bft 30 or 40 years, but no more than in 
proportion to the pric6 of proviiions. This is afcertained bj 
written accounts kept at the two periods reipeflively.

from lending this part of the ftatiilical account. This lift (hews 
this Angular circumftance : that, though this p^ifh is dimin- 
iflicd about one fifth within tliefe 40 years, through its vicinity 
to manufaAuring towns and other caufes I mentioned, yet the 
number of our births are by no mean^ {liminiflied in the 
fame proportion. I afcribe thi^ to the eafe^ afi^ucnce, and 
contentment, in which our people live under our prefcnt 
)iappy government* The flourifhtng of agricultttre, trade, 
manufa£biresy always promotes matrimony and population. 

I could wiih to Gorreft a fma^l, but awkward, miftake, 
which the compiler or puUilker had fallen into, in the prin- 
ted account of this parifli, concerning our Norman camps. 
In the printed account, they 'are called firft Roman camps, 
and then they are immediately defcribed as Norman ones. It 
nught be a mere typographical mlftake ; but it Iqoks awk- 
ward. Norman camj)s they certainly were. One of the hiUi 
where they are is ftill called Normans' Law. Our veftiges 
ff thcfe camps are neither on tlie kind of ground the Ro-

Wd warriors of ancient Rome trufted more to their fword 
and their valour than to heights of difficult acceft. The 
Normans were mere plunderers ; and chofe thefe heights to 
depofit their plundery till xhtf heard of a rifing in our coun* 
try fufficient to beat them off, and th6n hurried down to 
their fhips in the Tay with what they had got. Befides, the 
Roman camps were fijuares, or nearly fo ; whereas our vefti- 
£es are all circles, which was the Norman form.

<p>It is highly gratifjtng to view a fpirit of iaduftiy and inf

^ The writer of this.article has long contemplated with plea- ^ 
fiirc the advantages that would irife, not folely to this coun- 
try, but alfo to all Britain, Were manufactories of linen and 
woollen cloth carried on individuj^ly ; that is, a loom,' or

farmer's abilities^ Iii this parilh there Su-e at leaft 606 acrci

▼aniflieS, by the poflibility of making theni diftinft and fepa4 
rate bbje£ts, fo as that the dne party ihould at no time inter- 
fere with the department of the other. Add to this, that ai 
fource of gain is of all others the moft po\i»erfiil fource df in- 
duftiy \ the produce of labour being eafily tranfported to si 
rtady market; 

It will be (aid, tliat eflablifhing villages in proper fittia- 
tions wotild be a preferable mode of carrying On manufafto^ 
ries« The writer df this article is unfortunately fingular in^ 
iiis idea of the utility of riiUges; They afe ornaments to ai 
country, but too frequently nurfcries of political difquiiitioii« 
•-—Villages, it will be argued, afibrd a ready market CTen for

But, allo'w^uig the utility of villages in its utmoft^ axtent ; 
ftiU the eftablifliment of private manufaclories can be no em- 
barrafsment upon that utility, or upon the bufinefs of fann- 
ing. To corroborate which, we need only look to our neigh- 
bouring country Ireland, crowded with cities and villages, 
and farming alfo carried on. to a great extent. 

Hence this mcafurc, among many other advantages, would 
he a vaft fouirce of population. What crowds of both fcxes, 
m diderent comers of the kingdom, leave their native foil in 
qucft of employment ! thoufands of whom, by a fuddcn tran- 
fition of living, and other cafualties, are hurried to. an un- 
timely p^yc. Had they fufficicnt employuicrAt in their na- 
tive country j few would thiuk of going in quefc of that fub- 
fiftencc they might find where they drew their firft hreatli^ 
and fewer ftill would vifit foreign ihores. Thus would Bri- 
tain cpiadruple its numbers by a race of hardy fons, attached 
by the fruits of fobcr induftry, and bid defiance to every 
ufiirping foe ! France would not then even dare to menace 
her well^guarded fhorc. 

In Ireland, experience, long experience, has fanfitioned 
this mode of manufadlure, and given her the fuperiority in 
the linen market. What has not nature done, what would, 
not induftry do, in that well-fituated ifle ? Profperous and 
hzppj might (he be, were not that happinefs abufed. The 
Iriih lord, wallowing in luxury, is confequently regardlefs 
of the fliamefiil abufe committed by the deftruAive mode of 
wadfetting^ or nearly To, his fraitful foil, by renting it to a. 
few, who are denominated refpe£lable farmers. Thefc fub- 
iet to a fecond dafs ; the fccond to a tliird ; and fo on, to a 
fixth. From the fecond clafs, what ftrides does oppreflion 
make! JBy remedying this Iburcc of grievance, Ireland 
would become happy, profperous an4 peaceful. 

To this mode of oppreflion, how ftriking the following

contraft \ This country, in common wkh others, long kt* 
boured yndcr the fame deftruclivc grievance. But, the pre* 
fcnt j^pprietor, Sir James Grant, fy foon as he got poflcf- 
fion of his property, liruck at the root of this baneful evil, 
by paying off the \Yadfets, under which hardfhip a great part 
of his property laboured -, and thus unfettered the hands of 
indwftry, which he has invariably encouraged. But, indui^^ 
try, when long cramped and difcouraged, becomes flow and 
tardy in recovery : People get into habits and modes of cul- 
ture, which lime, long time, cajn hardly induce them to rclin- 
quifli. Thus Sir James Grant's property in this and the other 
parifhes ftill admits of improvement. And, over what foil 
will the traveller caft his eye where this does not hold true ? 
Still, Sir James Grant, by an uniformity of conduft, in giv- 
ing every proof that it is his earncft wifli to render his peo- ' 
pie happy and comfortable, has the fatisfaftion of being pof- 
ftfled of thcf fincere attachment of a numerous and induftri- 
ous tenantry, with every individual of whom he is perfonally 
acquainted : A proof of which was given in recruiting the 
ift Fenciblc Regiment ; and in this hour of aid and ex- 
ertion, they with one voice declare their rcadinefs to take 
the field, folicitous^ in that event, that Sir James Grant ma^ 
be their Itader.

and urgency, it is matter of furpri2e that exertion has hi- 
therto been fo flow, when every individual is threatened ia 
his perfon, family and property, by an infulting and rapaci- 
ous foe.

pi General appendix to [Vol. ir# 

Muir'hummg. — The fportfman exclaim9| nay, thunders out 
execrations and anathemas againft the ihepherd as an enemy 
to game. Burning o£ heath is in fome degree a fcicncc, 
excctited partially, with confideration and caution ; fcldom 
done but from the ift of Oftober to the month of March, 
and at no time until the heath begins to decay. The benefit 
of it to flieep YS immenfe, in point of feeding and medicine. 
To the game, cfp^dally groufe, it is hixury. The headier 
bells from the young growth, pregnant with honey, the va- 
riety of mountain berries, and the richnefs of verdure, which 
continues for feveral years tntil the heath becomes rank and 
1)egins to decay, afforcl a plentiful fubCftence to the game. 
Could. the feathered tribe articulate, they Would blefs the 
hand which, was the mean of fo plentiful a ftore. In effcA, 
in hoarfc and fonorous notes they do fo.— The idea that 
heath, if never burned, would in time decay and be eradi- 
cated, fcarcely dcfcrves a reply. 

Turnip and Potatofs.'-'n!hz culture of turnip has in mod 
countries been ci^rried to perfeftion ; that of potatoes, of late 
years, has made great progrefs, but, in point of feeding cat- 
tle, not fo unirerfally attended 'to. Turnips are dangeroui^ 
to cows before calving, and many fuffer thereby j but they" 
improve even by a few handfuls of potatoes a-day, and no 
quantity will injure them. Beef fed upon turnips is for in- 
ferior in quality to that upon potatoes'; three bolls of which, 
with ftraw or hay, and a fheaf of com eitch a day, for the 
laft two or three weeks, will completely feed an ox of an or- 
dinary fize. l?eat and turf afhes, if kept dry, and laid in 
drills, fo as to go a greater length, ^ill yield excellent tur- * 
iii^s, and feeding cattle upon the field will fufliciently ma^ 
uure it. Thus the manure cofniAonly ufed for turnips ma7 
be allotted for potatoes ; no matter how rich for fuch as a^ 

' intended 



No. 42.] The Siatiftical Account. jrj 

intended for cattle. But manure for potatoes to be ufed in 
the kitchen, requires great attention. The difficulty of pzc^ 
lerving potatoes in printer will be an objeAion, by fome peo^^ 
pie, againft the culture of them to any great extent. This ob« 
je£Hon arifes from mere indolence. The immenfe benefit of 
them to man and beaft, if properly attended to, will moref 
than repay the labour required in pfcfcrving them in pits, 
vaults and tnlU-leads, that is, in plain Scots, the (heelings of 
the com ; a (mall quantity of which thrown among a niun« 
bcr of bells of potatoes, but covered foot deep upon the fur- 
face, will fecurc them, under a roof, froin the fevereft froft, 
and render them more dry and mellow, and prcfcrvc them lit 
for ufc during a great part of fummer. 

Emnent CbaraBers.^'^Dr. William, Grant, phyCciau la 
London, was fon to James Grant of Rothiemurchus. Hav« 
ing taken his degree of M. A. at the College of Aberdeen, 
he commenced his medical, (hidies in the Univerfity of Edin* 
burgh, under the celebrated Drs. Monro, Rutherford, Al- 
fton, Whytt. Having received the moft ample te{limonials 
of his charaAcr and abilities from his feveral matters, he 
entered the Univcrfity of Francker, in Friefland, where he 
ftudicd for two years. He then removed to Paris, where he 
remained for fix months -, when hearing of a very mortal fe- 
ver, which the French phyficians thought new, had Iw-okc 
out at Rouen in Normandy, he repaired thither on purpose 
to attend the hofnital where it prevailed. At Rouen he con- 
tinued three nronths, and then returned to Paris, where he 
foon after took the degree of M. D. He thence returned 
and fettled in London, in 175 J, where he pra£tifcd phyfic 
for about 36 years. His feveral medical publications fpeak 
&amp;perior abilities in his profeflion } and the eftimation he 
was held in abroad is confpicuous from the correfpondence 

of

in Latin, arc to be feen at the end of the 2d edition of hi^ 
Trcatifc on Ytv€ts. His chief correfpondents were Kauft- 
man, Tiflbt, De Haen, and StoU; the latter of whom de- 
dicated a medical work to him, and pronounces him to 
be a bleffing to mankind; Finding his health impaired, 
he refolvcd to retire to his native foil } where he devoted 
his whole attention to the improvement of his paternal 
property^ and tendering medical counfel and ailiftahce to the 
fick and difabled: Finding a diforder in his ftomach become 
ing obftinatq, he repaired to Edinburgh \ where having lin« 
gered|.with becoming and exemplary reiignation and forti- 
tude, under a fevefe illneis for three months, notwithftand-^ 
ing the united efforts of the ableft phyficians, be refigned his 
laft breath. " ' D f; Grant, in focial intercotirfe, rendered 
himfelf the delight of ^11 his acquaintance* Never was there 
a man who, with fo much knowledge, and fo much energj 
of expreflion in converfation, rendered himfelf more plea** 
fant in company, or was more regretted when he died. 

Alexander Gumming, fon*to Mr James Gumming late in 
Aviemore in the parifli of Duthil, gave ftriking proofs of 
mechanical genius at ,an eaffy period of lift?, when a boy at 
fchool. Being patronifed by John Duke of Argyle, he rc- 
fided under the patronage of the Duke at Inveraray for fevcral 
years. From thence he fettled in London, where his inventions 
and improvements in the mechanical line recommended him 
to the favour of the late Earl of Bute^ and the notice of his 
prefent Majefty. Having, by his merit and induftry in the 
mechanical department, acquired a fufiicient independency, 
be now enjoys the fruit of his labour in ^ villa near London.

I have farther to obferye, as an appendix to the Statiftical 
Account of this parifh, which I drew up in 1791, that a ve- 
ry defireable alteration in the ftate of agriculture has taken 
place fince that period. I then obfervcd, that improvements 
here were in their infancy, and that the fhortncfs of the lea« 
fes was a great bar to their advancement 5 with a very few 
exceptions, i^ years was the longeft leafe that was at that 
time given in this parifh : and though on improved farms this 
may be confidered as long enough, I am convinced it will jU- 
ways be found an infuperable obftacle to the commencetnent of 
improvements. A tenant pofleflid of a capital will never lay 
it out on a wafte farm on fo (hort a tenure. Aboift 3 years 
ago, feveral fubflantial farmers from the county of Angus, 
invited to this cprner by the lownefs of the rents, compared 
with what they paid at home, and the command of the means 
of improvement which our vicinity to the coaft and the river 
Tthan gave them, took farms here j-^-and, I believe nearly a 
third part of this parifh is now occupied by tenants from be- 
yond the Grampians. Mr. Buchan of Auchmacoy was among 
the firft who gave them encouragement to fettle here by the 
liberal terms on which he was willing to fet his farms. A 
good part of this gentleman's property is now let on leafes 
of 38 and 57 years, with a rifing rent at certain periods; 
and though ^t firft fonie of the neighbouring gentlemen ex-?

claimed againft this modej as tying up a proprietor's hand^ 
from the management of his cftatc \ I am confident that Mr. 
Buchan and his heirs will in the end be great gainers by his 
management. In place of a fet of poor tenants, who were 
fcorccly able to pay their rents and cam a fcanty fubfiftcncc, 
and at the end of their leafes went off In arrears to the pro- 
prietor, and left their farms in worfc condition than they en- 
tered with them, he, in his own time, has the fatisfaAion of 
feeing a thriving tenantry, and his lands daily improving-— a 
ftirc r^tal in place of a nominal one~-and, at the end of 
^hefe leafes^ the rents will be higher than they would have 
lifen if let under fhort leafes— the fields in a much higher 
(late of qiltivation, and confequently worth a ftill greater 
lidvance of rent. 

Among the farms let under long leafes, I muft not omit ttj 
inention Tipperty, a farm confiding of nearly jop acresj the 
property of Mr. Turner of Menie. This farm about 1 2 years 
ago, was let for 57 years to a gentleman, who fold the leafe 
in 1793. The leafe was purchafed at a public fale, by a 
gentleman from Angus, who has erefted upon It a moft cx- 
tLclIcnt {leading of offices, wiAi a threfhing machine, a meal 
mill, and barley mill, all driven by water, and is now carry- 
mg on the improvement of it with great fpirit and judgment. 
In Summer I79S he had nearly 100 acres of fallow, bat the 
wetnefs of that feafon wa» very unfavourable to an undertak- 
ing of fuch magnitude, cfpccially confidering the fuggcdnefs 
and wildncfs which he had to overcome. Laft Summer he 
did not attempt fo much, and has got his fallow field com- 
pletely drcfled and manured. I finccrely hope that this gen^ 
tleman's fplrlted exertions will be crowned with fuccefs, for 
his own fake :\nd the fake of the country in general. — ^What 
a pity it is that to many of our proprietors arc fo averfe to

power of improving their eftates, and doing good to their

and would be made to contribute to enrich individuals, and

I (hall only add, that the badnels of our irbads iii general^ 
and particularly to the port of Newburgh, from which we get 
our lime, and which is the general market for Our grain, has 
hithdrto been, and ftill is, a great obftruftion to the improve-

LtfadhiUs, a worthy and well informed gentleman. By a re- 
gifter of the workings, It appears that the kad was difcovcr- 
cd, in the bed of a fmall rivulet which runs through the vil- 
lage, in the year 15 13, by one Martin Templeton, and that 
it Was firii Wrought by Douglas of P^khe^d. For many 
years the work was carried on in a very impcrfeft manner. ' 
in the beginning of the laft century, Leadhills, or Water- 
head, as it was then called^ was the property of a gentleman^ 
named James Foulis, who had two daughters: one of whonr 
married Sir Thomas Hope, .king*s advocate, in the reign of* 
Charles I. ; the other' married Baillie of Lamington. Sir 
Thomas Hope and his heirs became proprietors of Leadhills^ 
in right of his Lady. 

The works have been carried on with various fuccefe, fome-* 
times by the family of ^opeton, and fometimes by companies 
and individuals. At prefent they are fct to the Scotch Min&amp; 
and Leadhills Qjmpanies. The firft is divided into 100 
fliares of L. 1000 each. The Company have a prefidcnt 
twelve direftors, a (ecretary, and clerk. They keep an agent,, 
two ovcrfcers, and two or three clerks at Leadhills, wha 
' tranfmit weekly to London an account of their whole pro- 
cedure. 

The external appearance of Leadhills is ugly beyond de- 
fcription : rock, fllOff heath, and barren till. Every fort of 
vcfgetablc is with difficulty raifedj and feldom comes to per-^ 
fedlion. Spring w^ter there» is perhaps as fine as any in the' 
world: but, the water below the fmeltihg-milas, the moftf 
dangerous. The lead. before {melting is broke very finall anud 
waflied from extraneous matter. It contains frequently ar- 
fenic, fufphur, zinc, &amp;c. which poifons the water in which; 
it is wafhed. Fowls of any kind will not live many days- at 
jLeadhills. They pick op arfcnical p^ticles wth their food, 
which iboa kills them. Horfes, cows, dogs, cats, arc liable

to the lead-bra(h. A cat, when ictzed with that diftcmpcr, 
fprings like lightning through every comer of the houfe, falls 
i&amp;to coEkvaliiom, and dies. A dog falls into ftrong convul- 

I £oD5 aIfo hut fometimes recovers. A cow grows perfe£tly 
mad in an inftant, and mufl: be immediately killed. Fortu- 

I nately this diftemper does not affefl: the human fpecies. 

About 30 years ago, moft if the fmelters died either mad- 
men or idiots. Now they retain their fenfes as well as other 

j people. The reafon given is: formerly fpirits were cheap, 
and the fmelters partook Uberally of ihem at their work. 

I For many years paft they drink nothing at their work/ but 

j pore fpring water ; they now live as long and as rationally 

j u others.

Corrre^ion (by the Rev. WilUam Tbamfon) of a paragraph in 
the Statjflkal. Acctmnt of OchiUree^ ^^^^^ '^^ Pubhc Roads ^ 
to he underfiood of the year 1793, in the hegmning ofjvAich the 
Stati/Hcal Account thereof was putli/hed.</head> 

<p>. The valuation of the parifli of Ochiltree is L. 5213 Scots, 
and therefore the ftatute money for repair of roads at 3d, per 
pound will be L.65 '.3:3 ftcrl. bcfides what is collected from 
the inhabitants of the village at 3s. a family, thofe of pau- 
pers excepted. 

The turnpike roads in the parifh contain in length altoge- 
ther 8* miles and 50 falls, (285 falls to a mile.) 

The principal and moft ferviccable road in the parifh is 
that from Cumnock to Ayr, which palles thi-ough the vil- 
lage of Ochiltree, in the middle of which is the toll-bar; and 
its length within the parifh is 4* miles and 37 fells. L. 20 
a year hath been allowed to a contraftor for the repair of 
thb road, for the length of 4 miles wanting 20 falls. As the 
remftihing i mile and 57 fells have been conjoined, as to re- 
pair with a part of the fame road in the parifh of Stair, tkc 
expence of its repair is not prccifely known, but as the for- 
mer part is through the wctteft foil,^ and is therefore the 

moft 



^p. 3tyl The Staiijiical Account. lof: 

poft difficult to be kept in rqpair, the cxpcnce of the k 
part cannot exceed what is in proportiQn to the former, a, 1 
inay therefore be ftated at L. 3 : 1 2. 

Another turnpike road from Bar&amp;imming Bridge, ^^u^i, 
through two comers of Ochiltree parifli, on the N. W- aiui 
its length in the parilh is 2 miles, wanting 44 £iH$. Cont- 
ceming this road, 3rhich from being Icfg frequented needs 
Icfs repair, we have heard th^t only L. lo was once ex- 
pended on it, fince it was made about 14 years ago. How- 
ever, we will not omit to obferye, that in this prcfcnt year 
1794, L.3 hath beep- expended in the i:epairing of jt. 

Another turnpike road from Stair Bridge leading towards 
Dalmellington, and joining the laft mentioned road^ paiTc^ 
through three comers of Ochiltree parifh, and its length in 
the parifli is 2 miles and 57 falls. The- parts of this road 
alfo which are in Ochiltree, arc conjointly repaired with 
thofe which are in Stair \ and though it is faid that fome 
of thefe parts have not received repair eyery ye^iri and though 
in feft they do not need fo much repair as the Crft roac^ 
yet we (hall eftimate the e3^pence pf their reparation accord- 
ing to the rate of the firft road, at L, 1 1 : 4 annually* 

The overplus of ftatute money or annual remainder, after 
jhe cxpencc of forefaid repairs, it hath been thought by 
the parifhioners of Ochiltree, fliqt^ld be laid out in repair- 
ing parifh or crofs roads, which are moft wretchedly bad, 
and on which no ftatute money hath hitheito been ex- 
pended. That fuch roads (hould be repaired by the fla- 
tute money fecms to be the opinion of Colonel Fullarton, 
who, in his Georgical Account of Ayrfliire, iliys, (p. 39J 

* the turnpike roads are made and repaired by the produce 

* of the tolls, and the crofs roaJs by the ftatute labour of 

* the different parilhcs.* And in the aft of Parliament con- 
cerning roads in Ayrihirc, (p. 26.) it is faid, * The whole

* convcrGons in money, or the ftatute fcrvices, (if exacted as 

* herein before provided,) fliall, in th^ difcretion of the 

* truftees, be folely applicable to tlic feveral roads men^ 
' tii^ned in this ad, and in fuch proportions as they fhall 

* think proper, but only till fuch time as the toll levied 

* thereon fhall be fufficicnt to pay the interefr of the motiey 

* borrowed, or o^ the debts contraAed for ma^ng fiich 

* roads, and to keq the fame in repair, and no longer \ and 

* fo as that ail the ftatute feryices, and all the money to be 
 raifed by the faid converfion in each parifh, fhall be fb ap- 
^ plied to the repairing fbch parts of the fame roads paffing 

* through the fame parilHes as are within its bounds, and 

* none other/ 

But, as hitherto, ijot even the forcfaid overplus of ftatute 
money hath been applied to parifh or crofs roads, the inha- 
bitants of the parifti of Ochiltree can only conclude, that it 
has been applied to t^e reduflion of the debts contrafted for 
making the turnpike roads, and are thence encouraged to 
hope that part at leaft of the ftatute money will foon be ap- 
plied to the repair of parifh or crofs roads j from the badnef$ 
of which, at prefent conjoined with the exterior poiition of 
much of the turnpike roads, the inhabitants of Ochiltree pa- 
jrifli, it muft be acknowledged, fuffer much in their mutual 
intercourfc. 

Finally', on this fubjeft, we fiiall take notice of an objcc* 
tion, which, from having formerly heard it, we fufpeft may 
be renewed againft tlie above ftatcmciit, and we do fo the 
rather, bccaufc wc believe that the confideration of this ob- 
jc^^ion may fcrve to throw light on the whole fubjcft, and it 
is the following, viz. that the parifhes of Ochiltree and Stair 
are but one parifh. In anfwer, wc obferve, that faid parifhes 
were disjoined aboye a century ago, before there was any aft 
for tizf npikc road% or ftatute money in this coxmtry. An4

<p>Name and jB/jfwwAgy.— -The city t{ Brechin is £tutited ort 
the fide of a imall bill. After you enter the eity from th« 
north, you graduaUy dcfccnd all the way to the water of 
Southelkj which terminates the city and fuburbs on the fowth. 
i^ience Brechin probably receives its denomination; Bru- 
mhaun fignifyingj in Gaelic, ^ the top of a declivity.' 

From the eaft of Brechin, you have a delightful profpeft 
of the bay of Montrofe^ and of the rich and fertile country 
irhich lio betwixt Montrofe and Brechin^ containing a fpace 
of about eight EngliQi miles. I am not certain but from this 
circumftance Brechin may have derived ks name ; Breaichuain 
fignifying, in Gaelic, * a view of the frith.' As etymologies 
are uncertain, it is of no moment to inveftigate, in the pre" 
feat cafe, which of theie ought to have the preference, be^^ 
caufe both of them perfefUy agree with the iituatioa of the 
place.

bertles of the boroagh, northward, begin at a fmall hill or 
eminence a fhort way from the entrance of the city, called 
the Gallowbai. It fecms Bt-echin had been ih former times 
the county town, or at leaft the ftieriff had frequently held 
his courts here. As malefoAors, conviftod of crimes which 
fdl under the cognizance of the fhcriflF, had been executed 
on this hill Or toiinence, it retains to this day the name of 
the Galbwhill. 

There is a fmall rivulet or burn which rifes tb the weft of 
Brechin, and runs dircftly eaftward. Several houfes and lands 
on the tlbrth fida of this rivulet are within the Royalty. This 
bum foori iltcri its difeftion, and rurs fouthward througK 
a large den; which Is the property of the boroughj and a 
commoh pafhirage to the cows and cattle of the citizens in 
the filmtner feafon. It is commonly called the Den-burn. 
This fmall burn terminates the royalty on the eaft. No part 
of the royalty is fituated on the eaft fide of this burn, except 
a very iew houfes on what is called the Cadger-brae. The 
taftbrn extremity of the borough, known by the name of the 
Cadger-Wyhdj Ires i¥nolly on the weft fide of the bum: 
This wynd had formerly bicn inhabited by fifhmorigcrs, whofii 
bufinefs it was to frirnifli the citizens of Brechin with a con- 
ftant fupply of fifti from different parts of the coaft; tiehce 
probably it received its denomination. 

The Deh-burn, paffing by the .eaft fend of the Cadger- 
wynd, -^runs a confiderable way fouthward, till it falls into 
the Southefk, at what is calle'd the Ford-mouth. The hou- 
fes on the weft fide, all the way to the Ford-mouth, are with- 
in the royalty. Thofe on the Other fide belong to Southefk: 

The whole length of the borough from north to fouth, that 
15, from the Gallowhill to the Ford-mouth, is nearly an Eng- 
lifli mile.

converted into garden ground. The extent eaihrard) to the 
end of the Cadger-wynd9 is far from being fo largCj confid- 
ing only of 20 acres. 

The city is bounded, on the north, by the lands of Cookf« 
town ; on the eaft, partly by the lands of Caldhame, and 
pardy by the lands of Southeik ; on the fouth, by the river 
Sauthefl^y and the lands of Brechin Caftle ; and on the weftf

the eaft, the upper, ai^d thofe on the iouth, the nether te- 
nements. 

At the end of the nether tenements, there is a ponveiiient 
flonc bridge over the river Southeik, of two large archesl 
The fords here are quite impaflable in ftormy weather } and 
the Inhabitants here and in the neighboisrhopd, as weH as aR 
trarelkrs, would be much incommoded, were it not for this 
bridge. It was repsured fome years ago to great advantage. 
k is very remarkable that there is no tecond by whom, at 
whole expence, and at what ^Q^ ^bis ufeful and convenient 
bridge was erefied; and there are no funds .appropriated fbr 
its fiipport : fo that it muft be rc|]aired, when occafion re«

Brechin is at no great diftance from the harbour of Mon- 
trofe, and ihc tide flows within two miles of our city, A ca- 
nal would tend to increafe our trade. It would be of fervice 
in conveying down the com of the country for exportation % 
and it would be particularly ufcful to the citizens here for. 
carrying their coals from Montrofe to Brechin, the expence 
of carriage being very heavy on the poorer fort, who have 
no carts and horfes of their own. Something of this kind, 
I underftand, is at prcfent in contemplation. 

Brechin in former times had ports or gates at the diflTcr- 
cnt entHcs to the city. The places where they ftood are well 
known. Some veiliges of them are extant ; and the. names 
of north, fouth and weft port fttll remain. 

Brechin, the city properly fo called, conMs of one large 
bandfome ftreet, extending from the north to the fouth port^ 
^aod two others which are called wynds^ the upper and ne« 
ther weft wynd. 

Brechin was twice burnt. Firft by the Danes, about the year 
IOI2, in the reign of Malcolm II. who had obtained a com- 
pleat viAory over the Danes at Mortlich in BanfiQiire. This 
fb irritated Sweno, the Daniih king, thai he ordered two 
fleets, one from England, and another from Norway, to make 
a defcent upon Scotland, under the command of Canms, one 
of his moft renowned generals. The Danes attempted to 
land at the mouth of the Forth ; but finding every place there 
well fortified, they were oUiged to move farther northward,

In the month of March 1645, ^^^ Marquis of Montroie^ 
imce a zealous covenanter, and aftervrards as zealous a royal- 
iil, came to Fettercairh in his return from the north, where 
he had in contradiAion to his late folemn ei^gements, been 
promoting the interefts of the king. He was on his way to 
Brechin : and as a favage and brutal cruelty had always mark« 
ed the procedure of that unhappy nobleman, both when a 
covenanter and a royalift, the citisens of Brechin, alarmed at 
hb approach, left their houies and habitations, and depoiited 
their effects in the caftle and church* This fo 'enraged the 
Marquis^ that he allowed bis foldiers to plunder the town^ 
and in the height of their fury they burnt fixty houfes to the 
ground. Some of thefe houfes were to the north, but the 
moft of them to the wefti It feems, before this period, tho 
houfes and buildings here had extended moftly to the weft. 

There are at prefent very good houfes both on the eaft

The convener of the trades b faid to be a member of the

office of convener above three years, he muft in confequence 
kave the council at the expiration of that period. But it is 
competent for the reflnainihg twelve members of the council 
to choofe themfelves every yesr, if they think pn^er, as long 
as they live, which ftey commonly do ; ib that the town*

For the fpace of 23 years bygone, I only recoUeft two inflaa-

with others in an application to Parliament for what b caHed

abbot Leod was witad&amp; to the grant made by King David to 
his new Abbey of Dunfermline : but where their convent 
fiood I cannot fay, nor do I find any mention of them in 
Brechin aftor this period.

The Red Friars, called dfo Mathurins, and Trinity Friars^ 
bad convents in different ps^s-of the kingdom. Keith in his 
account of the religious houTes in Scotland is abfolately cer« 
tain from antient charters and records, that they had a con* 
Tent in Brechin, but wh^e it ftood, or by whom it was foun- 
ded, he cannot fay. Maitland. in his Hiftory of Scotland 
conjechires» that the convent of the Mathurins or- Trinirjf* 
Friars here, was founded by David the I. who cre^fted the 
bilhoprick. The ruins of the abbey .or convent, flill called 
theColiege^ are yet to be feen in the College or Chanonry: 
Wynd, adjoining to the N. W. end of the grammar fchool„ 
whicli was imdoubtedly part of the faid college, and proba- 
bly its fchool ; and that this college or convent was of large 
dimenlion, is evident from its vcftigia, or remains^ which ap- 
ypear in the neighbouring gardens. 

At the Reformatio^, the rents and revenues of all eccle- 
fiaftical benefices were appointed to be given in to the Privy 
Council of Scotland. The revenue of the fee of Brechin vck 
the year 1562, according to the account then given^ was as 
follows: — ^In money, L. 410 15 Scots; 138 capons, 20 S 
fowls, 18 geefe, one chalder and two bolls of corn for horfes^ 
three barrels of falmon -, money in tcinds, L. 24 : 6 ; 8 
Scots; teind wheat, 11 bolls j 14 chaldirs and 6 bolls. of 
bear, and 25 chalden and 5 bolls of meal: a great revenue 
without all queflion. 

At the time of. the Reformation, Alexander Campbell, 
a fon of the family of Arkinglafs, by the recommendation 
of the Earl of Argyle, got a grant of the bifliopric of Bre* 
cbio while- he was yet a boy, with a new and unheard-^f 
power, to difpofe of, at his plearure,:aU the revenues, which 
belonged either to the fpirituality or temporality of the bene- 
. fice. Of this power he made a very liberal ufe^ by alie^altin^

the Earl of Argylc: fo that, from this period down to th^j 
Revolution^ the revenue was among the fmalkfty if not tha 
fmallcft, of any biftiopric in Scotland^ -^ 

In the time of Popery, bilhops had both a civil and fpirlt- 
tial jnrifdit'bion ; and each of them had their official to judge 
in matters of tithes, marriages, orphans, and poor widows^ 
and to confirm teilaments. At the Reformation, commiiTaries 
were appointed in room of the officials ; accordingly there is 
a commiiTariot in Brechin, the cbmmiflary being nominated 
by the king, who is come in place pf the biihop. 

It is not known by whom the cathedral church of Brechin 
was built. It is a Gothic pile fupported by 12 pillars. Tlie 
whole length, including the chancel, which is now demolifh* 
cd, is about 166 feet, and the breadth $i« The weft end of 
one of the ailes is entire ; the door is gothic, and the arch 
confifb of many mouldings. It has a window of curious an- 
tique work ; on the fide of the wall there ftood a ftatue of 
the Virgin Mary, the niche in which it ftood ftill remains. 
The fteeple is a handfome tower, lao feet high. Tlic four 
lower windows are in form of a long narrow opening. The 
beliiy windows are adorned with that fpecies of opening, called 
the quaterfoil, and the top battlemented, out of which rifes a 
handfome fpire. % 

The eaft part of the church, called the choir, or chancel, 
was deftroyed at the Reformation, and without all- doubt by 
the reformers themfelves. It is to be obferved, that, in the 
time of Pqery, cathedral churches, however different in 
their fize and dimenfions, were all fituated one way, and were 
all divided into the fame general parts in imitation of diffisr* 
cnt parts of the temple of Jerufalem. There was the veftibule, 
or entry to the church, anfwering to the court of the temple^ 
the nave, or body of the church, anfwering to the lanftuary 
pt holy place ; -and, the chancel, ftparated from the body of

The round tower, a4Joining to the churchy well known by 
the name of the Uttk fiee(4e of Btechiui is an- objed of at-f^ 
tdition and adniiration to all ftrangers. It is hollow on the 
infide and without a ftaircafe^ (wo handfome bells are jdaced 
in it, which are got at by means of ladders, placed on woodf 
en iemicircular floors, each refting on the ci^'cuiar abtutntcitts

The perpendiailar height of this famous tower or fteeple^ 
and all its dimenfions within and without, have been fo ac-*

fieeple of the (ame fonn, though far infericnr in fize and di« 
menfionsj at Abemethy, formerly the feat of the PiAiih 
kingdom. It is certain that Brechin, a city of great antiqui* 
ty, was a part of that kingdom. When the church.of Bre« 
chin was burnt down by the Danes in the reign of Malcohn 
n. in the nianiler ahead^ mentioned, this famous fteeple was 
ftandihg, and efcaped the general conflagntion. It is highlj 
probable, that the church which was then bumt^ and the 
fieqple to which it adjoined, as the church does atprefent^ 
Were both of them built during the continuance of the Pic- 
tifh kingdom. 

It has been alledged that towers or fleeples of tliis kind 
could not be intended for belfries, becaufe they are placed 
near to chiirchei, the fteeples of which are provided with bells . 
t)f their own. Thofe who make this obje£tion fhould advert» 
thai the fine (bund 6f bells arifes in great meafure firom theit 
being rung together, or in concert. The large bell in the 
fieeple of the church of Brechui is remarkably fine. It had 
fiifiered ibme hurt feveral years ago, and for that reafon was 
caft anew \ and it is univerfally agreed, that its found at pre- 
(ent is as melodious as former)^. When the lai^e beU be«^ 
longing to the churchy and the two bells in the little fteeple ' 
are ringmg together, the fweet and melodious found they 
produce cannot be exceeded by any bells in Scotland. A cir- 
comfiance which every ftranger pafiing through this city has 
had occafion to obferve. 

There bdon^ to cathedrals certain chapels and altarages* 
inffituted for the devotions of the people, or for faying maf- 
les for the fouls of their founders^ There had been a chapel 
of this kind in the eafternitaoft part of the country parifh, 
which having been dedicated to Saint Magdalene, ftill retains 
the name of Magdalene Chapel. Here is a burial ground, 
which is (till ufed for this purpofe by feveral of the par-

ment for their anccftors. 

There had been fome chapels and altarages at Caldhame, 
pirt of the cotihtry parilh to the'eaft of the totrti t of which 
fome veftiges ftill reiftiain. King James VI. in the yeai* ^572, 
mbrtified to the town of Brcchiti, for the ufes of their p6or, 
all the revenues belonging to any chapldinry or altarage with- 
in the cathedral church of Brechin.. But| in a declarator at 
the inftance of the Laird of Fiftdowriei againft the faid town, 
for declaring the lands of the chapelry of Caldhame to belong 
to 'him, as having fight by progrefs from the chaplains of 
Caldhame 5 the Lords declared in his favour, in regard he 
Was infeft upon, the King's Confirmation Charter, before any 
ihfeftment taken by the town upon their gift of mortifica- 
tion. Accordingly the heirs of Findo\irric continued to poC- 
fefs the lands of Caldhame, till they were purchafed from 
them feveral years ago, by the late Earl of Panmure. 

Brechin is a collegiate church ; one parifh under the care 
of two minifters. The eaft part of the town, and the eail 
and north ptos of the country parifli, with the upper and 
netlier tenements, are called the firft charge. The weft 
part of the town, the upper and nether weft wynds, and 
the wholfc country parilh to the weft and foutb, are cal- 
led the Second charge. When a minifter dies, or is tran- 
flated, his fuccefibr is admitted to the charge he had, whe- 
ther it be the firft or fecond. The patronage of both is 
in the gift of the crown. 

The minifters in the firft charge were the immediate 

fucceflbrs of the bifhop, after the year 1690, when Epifl 

. copacy was ^bolifhed, and Prelbyterian government cfla- 

^,^ / bliflied in Scotland. Mr. WillifoA, afterwards minifter at 

r\ Dundee, was the firft. He was fucceeded by Mr. Gray, 

' who had been minifter at Cabrach, was tranflated to Ed- 



No. 34.] The Statijiical Account • 115 

zel| and after that to the firft charge in Brechin. He was ^ / 
fucceeded by Mr. David ^lair^ who had been minifter at /\. 
Lochlee, was tranflated to the fecond^ and after tliat to 
the jSrft charge in Brechin. He was fucceeded by the pre- 
fent incumbent Mr. John Biilet, who had been minifter at 
Culfalmond, and was admitted minifter of the firft charge in 
Brechin on the gth of November 1769. 

His ftipend confifted at firft of 85 bolls, 2 firlots, 2 lippies 
of mealy 40 bolls 2 firlots of bear, and 3 bolls 2 firloti of 
wheat, and L. 47 : 2 : 5 fterl. of money. It is to hz obferv- 
cd, that the bifhop's houfe and three gardens, which had be- 
longed tQ the biihop, were allocated to the minifter of the 
firft charge^ by two different decreets of the Court of TeincU, 
one in the year 1 702, ^nd the other in the year 17 1 8, in lieu ' 
pf I^. 3 : 6 : 8 fterl. of tlie ^bove mentioned ftipend. 

In cpnfequence of the fuppreffion of the parifti of Kinnaird 
and the annexation of part of it to the parifti of Brechin, the 
minifter of the firft charge has enjoye4 for three years paft 
Lf II : I : if fterhng of additional ftipend. The church of 
Kinnaird originally belonged to Brechin. It was disjoined 
from it in the year 1597, and erefted in a fepafate parfon- 
age } and the patronage difponed to Sir David drnegie. 

The bifhop's houfe was habitable at the Revolution, and 
▼as aftu^y poflefled and inhabited by Meflrs. WilUfon, Gray 
and Blair for fome time. In Mr. Blair's time it became un- 
mhabitable, in confequence of which, he built a houfe of his 
own. In the year 1770, the Barons of Exchequer, on an ap- 
plication from the magiftrates and town council of Brechin, 
granted the fum of L. 250 fterl. for repairing^ the bifliop's 
houfe. The magiftrates of Brechin, to whom the manage- 
ment of the money was intrufted, finding the biftiop's houfe 
irreparable, laid out the money in building a new Iiqufe, a

preient incumbent poflefles and inhabits. 

The part of the countiy parifh which belongs to the firft 
charge, extends from the town eaflward about three Englifh 
miles, and about two Englifh miks northward j it goes no 
farther fouth than the extremity of the nether tenement at 
the bridge over the Southeik. It is bounded on the north 
by the parifh of Strickathrow, 6n the eaft by the pari(h of 
Dun, and on the fouth by the parifh qf Marytoun, and part 
pf the iecond charge* 

P^i/Aj/w«.— -The number of people in the; eaft {ideof the- 
town, and in the upper and nether tenements, counting the 
names from feven years of age and upwards, at which time 
they are entered on the catechifing rolls, ^nd including all 
the diSerent religious denonUnations, amount to 1500. The 
number gf people in the north and eaft fide of the countiy 
parifh, amount fully to '500. 

We have no Papifls, Independents, or Anabaptifls,in any 
part of the town or parifh of Brechin. There will be nearly 
of examinable perfons 243 Antiburgher Scceders. They have 
one minify, hb ftipend L. 60 fterling. Hb parifhioners, in 
the year 1790, built him a commodious houfe. He has a

the town's revenue, and bcfides is preceptor of Mat/on Dim* 

To underftand this matter fully, it muft be obfenred, that^ 
in the times of Popery, hofpitals inftituted for the mainte- 
nance of the poor, or the education of youth, as being of pe^ 
culiar ufefolnefs to mankind, were honoured by the diftin-: 
guilhing epithet of Maifons de Dieu, figniiying, in French^ 
* Houles of God.' There were houfes of this denomination 
in dififerent parts of Scotland. One of this kind was founded 
in Brechin, as nearly as I can learn, in the year 1256, by 
William of Brechin, ion of Henry of Brcdiin, and grandfon 
to Earl David, for the benefit of the fouls of William and 
Alexander, kings of Scotland, John, Earl of Chefter and 
Huntington, his brother, Henry, his £ither, and Juliana, his 
mother. To his charter "of foundation the fubfcribing wit- 
nefles are, Albin, biihop of Brechin, and Robert de Monte 
Aho* The original is infinrted in a confirmation charter of 
James the Third in the year 1477* It was fituated in a ven- 
nal or lane in the upper end Of the town, on the weft fide of 
the ftreet. Tlie fouth wall of the chapel is ftill fianding 
pretty entire ; and the houfe tf the preceptor, who was the 
head of this religious foundation, was inhabited in the me« 
mory of fome perfons ftill alive, but is now quite demolifhed.

ny of the royal family ^ere called Lords of Brechin. ' I^ing 
James the Third's fecond {bn Alexander^ was, in 1480, crea- 
ted Lord Brechin and Navar ; a title which was afterwards 
conferred upon the Maulcs of Panmure. David, 4th Lord 
of Brechin, was in 1321 executed for high treafon. Um- 
fraville, brother of the Eartof Angus, the moft antient title 
in Scotland, was fo difgufted at the execution, that, after 
giving David a decent burial, he repaired to King Robert 
&amp;iice, and begged he might be sdlowed tojell his lands aqd 
retire out of Scotland, as he could not live in a laiid where 
fuch a man as David Lord Brechin had fuffered an ignomi- 
nious death. This David was called The Flower of Chivalry, 

The caftle of Brechin was built on a little eminence (buth 
of the town, but no veftige of it is left. It underwent a 
long fiege in the year 1303 \ was gallantly deftoided agaiaft 
the Engliih under Edward L \ and notwithftanding all the 
efforts of that potent prince, the brave governor, Thomas 
Maule, held out this fmall fortrefs for twenty dajrs, till he 
was flain by a ftone caft from an engine on the aoth of Au- 
guft, when the place was inftantly furrendered. Patrick 
Maule, defcendant of the governor, was, in 1646, created 
Lord Maule of Brechin and Navar, and Earl of Panmure.. 

His family were patrons of the preceptory of MaUbn Dieii, 
which had for many ages been conferred on. the fchoolmafter 
of Brechin^ A full fourth part of the town holds feu of 
the jpreceptor of Maifon Dieu, who grants charters to Us 
VaiTals ; and, before the rebellion in 1 7.15, thefe were granted 
with the confent of the Earl of Panmure the; patron, ma^y 
of which are ftill extant. Upon the forfeiture of the Pan- 
mure -family in 1 7 15, the right was vefted in the crown, 
who, in cafe of vacancy, never fails to prefent to the precep-

Marhts, Trade and 3fj/i«/ii7i//"«f.— There is a conftant 
traffic of hoHes and cattle at Brechin through a great part of 
the year. Trinity Fair, fo denominated from Trinity Muxr, 
a little to the north of the town, where it is held, begins 
on the fecond Wednefday of June, and continues three days 
lucceffively. On Wednefday there is a fheep market, on 
Thurfday a cattle market, and on Friday the fineft horfe 
market in the north of Scotland. There is a market of the 
fame kind in the month of Auguft, on the fame muir, which^ 
from the time of the year in which it is held, is called Lam- 
mas Fair : but it is in eveiy feipeA inferior to the former. 
A cattle market begins on the firft Tuefday after Michael* 
mas, and continues every Tuefday for fix weeks after Mar-» 
tinmas. A horfe market begins on the lafl Tuefday of Fe- 
bruary, on the public fbreet, and is continued every Tuefday 
for fix weeks fucccffively. The weekly market in Brechin 
IS on Tuefday. . There is as good butcher meat here of every 
kind, beef, mutton, lamb, veal, pork and kid, as in any 
town in Scotland. One may likcwife be provided with but- 
cher meat on the Thurfday- The butchers here kill their 
beafts on Thurfday, and carry the flefh to Montrofe on Fri* 
day, which is the weekly market there. 

There are four extraordinary markets in Brechin every 

year.

one on the firft IWday after Martinmas, another on Palm

and the fourth on the firft Tnefdaj after Tammat fair. Thefe 
are foot maxketsy ftanding on the pbUic ^reet» which is at

many difilerent commodities. Ihis occafions a Taft refiirt of 
people fi^m the neighbouring pariihes, expeAing to parchafe 
a variety of articles firom the ftands or tents of the chapmen 
at a cheaper rate than fiiom the merchants' (hops. 

There is a falmon fifhing on the Southeik, the pivperty 
of the Hon. William Maule of Panmure. It is rented at 
prelent at L. 15 a^year; and the average fale, as I am in- 
ibnned, will be firom L. 60 to L. loo. 

In the year 1765, a b ie w eiy was erefted at the end of the 
nether'tenements, near the bridgci with every apparatus ne- 
ceflary for the purpoie. It has been very fuccefsfbl; for- 
niihiog ale and beer, not only to the people of Brechin, but 
to all the neighbouring pariihes, fbmc of them at a coilfi- 
derable diftance. 

In the year 1 786, a diftillery was ereAed at the north port, 
ht diftilling fpirits from malt. The wjiifky, or aquavits,

Gomxnodions houles were built, and very curious machinery, 
every way proper for the purpofe^ was provided. It was g^* 
ven up in September 1790. It recommenced in. April 1792 : 
100 hands, at an average, wdre employed in this maxm£ac« 
tory from the year 1786 to 1790; and 80, at leaft, are em- 
ployed Sit prefent. It is under the management of John Smithy 
'£{q. prefent provoft of Brechin, and CqUu Gillies, Efq. mer- 
chant here : two of our moft fubftantial merchants, and both 
of them diftinguifhed by prudence, induftry and unwearied 
attention to every branch of trade in which they hs^^pen to 
be engaged. 

It is needkfs to menticm the commodities retailed in the 
' (hops, as they are well known. One thing however muft 
be noticed, that there is a greater number of ihop-keepers in 
Brechin at prefent than was ever known at any former pe- 
riod, owing to the great increafe of people^ which occaflons 
a greater demand for fhop commodities. 

&amp;»/, Produce and ^gricuhure.'-^Thc lands around Brechin 
are in gqneral very good. There is not much wheat Town 
here. It is commonly fown in September or OAober, and 
from 3 firlots to 14 pecks an acre, and produces very often 
from 10 to 12 bolls per acre;- is for ordinary ready to be cut 
down alxHtt the middle of Auguft. Barley fown in April 
will be ready to be cut down with the wheat, and commonly 
produces about 10 bolls per acre. The crops of. oats have 
not been fo good within thefe twelve years pai^ : they pro- 
duce, at an average, from 6 to 8 bolk per acre. There is a 
good deal of peafe fown in the parifh ; and, after thepeafes 
barley, with grafs feeds, 12 pounds of clover and 2 bufliels 
of rye-grafs for an acre : and if cut the firft year, they will 
commonly produce from 2co to 300 ftones of hay, which 
. icUs^ at a mediumi from'4d. to (5d. per ftone.

The farmers here fow turnips, with which they fatten 
their cattle in winter. The inclo£bg' with ftotie dykes goes 
on very rapidly ; and in a few years the farmers will be en- 
abled to fatten their cattle in ftimmer. Some of our farmers 
who have indofed fields, fet them From 40s. to 50s. per acre. 

Sir David Carnegie's tenants, who compofe the grcateft 
part of the country parifh under the firft charge, have good 
farm {leadings, and are well lodged. Moft of the leafes 
were of late renewed, and the rents confiderably raifed : but ^ 
fffll they have very good bargains. . Little of their land is fet 
above 15s. per acre; whereas other gentlemen, in this and 
the neighbouring parishes, have fet their lands from 20s. to 
30s. per acre. The tenants here are, generally fpeaking, 
good farmers, well acquainted with the proper methods of 
cultivation ; and many of -them are very fubftant^al, fo that 
they can ajSbrd to lay out a good deal 'of money in improv- 
ing their farms : and there is every chance in the world, 
that what they have laid out, or may lay out, to- this effcft, 
will, in procefs of time, be repaid to great advantage, 

Antiquhiaj Mnd the Riding of the JWiwr.—— There are the tc- 
mains of a Daniih camp near Keithoc, a part of the couniry 
.parilh northward. This camp lies weft of the Battle-Dykes : 
the road leading from Brechin, to the Grampian Hills paffcs 
through the middle of it: It is in the* form of an oblong 
fquare. Its circumference is about one fourth of an Englifli 
mile, that is to fay, what is vifible above ground* In the 
midft of this encampnient is a well of water, generally known 
bjr the name of the Camp Well, and a mount, on the fouth 
fide, about 8 or 10 ieet high, and about 40 feet in circumfe- 
rence at the bafe. But from the beft information I ean learn, 
its original length was about one half of aficots mile ; the one

Keithoct immediatdy at the top of the hill, aii4 on the road 
leading from Brechin to Aberdeen. The Law of ICeithoc is 
about 20 feet hi^ above the fiirfiure of the gitmndj| and about 
or 45 feet broad at the baie, carried iBtp or built in a round 
form, and gradually finaller towards the top. To the fouth* 
weft of this camp, was a chapel, or temple, which is now 
ploughed 'down } and a large piece of land adjacent to thi^ 
temple is ftiU called the Temple or Kirk'Shade. 

At the time of Trinity and Lammas £urs, the youngd^ 
baillie of Snchin, with a ieleft companyy goes on horfeback 
to the North-water Bridge, which is about 5 meaiured miles 
^om the market, in order to prevent fore-ftalling } as no cat- 
tle, horfes or fheep can be fold within that diftance without 
being liable to the ufual cuftoms. At the (ame dme, the 
whole dtizeip. proceed on foot with great pon^ and fo- 
lemiiity, driins beatini;;, pipes playing and colours flying, to 
the Law of Keithoc, alias the Hare-Cairn, which is about 
midway between IB^chin and the North-water Bridge. In 
the days of dub-law, the baillie of Brechin, and his company, 
olten met with rcfiftance in the execution of then: office. 
If or this reafon, the dtizens proceeded the length of the Law 
of Kdtboc, or Haro-Caim, in order to affift them, if there 
ihould be occafion for it, in preferying and mainfaining the 
immemorial rights and privileges of the market, and this 
they were to do on the Ihorteft nptice. In thefe dviliased 
times, no violence is ofEctcd ; the old cufiom, however, is

Patrick de Leuchars, defcended of an ancient family in

year 1 3549 and fome time after was xnade Lord High Chancelr 
lor of the kingdom. 

George Shorefwood^ of the family of Bedihiel in the fhire 
of Berwidci was promoted to the biihopric of Brechin in the 
year 1454 : he was alfo Royal Secretary, and laft of all be* 
came Lord High Chancellor. 

John Sinclair, a fon of the houfe of Roflin, a man well 
learned in both laws, was dean of Reftalrtg, near Edinburgh^ 
and put into the fee of Brechin by Queen Mary. He was like« 
wife, for his fingular knowledge of the bw, firft an ordinary 
Lord pf Seffion, and then Lord Frefident. He joined Queen 
Mary in marriage to Lord Damley. 

William Maitland, F.R.S. whp pu]4i%d a hiftory of 
London in one folio volume, and alfo a hiftory of Scotland 
in two folios, was a native of Brechin. Some of his relation^ 
9re ftill alive. He had ftudied the hiftory of his own country 
with the utmoft care and attention ; and as he had occafion to. 
travel through a great part of it, he defcribes all its antiqui- 
ties, which happened to fall under his perfonal observation, 
with an uncommon degree of accuracy and preciiion. 

Mr. Norman Sievewright, late minifter of the qualified 
epifcopal cbzpid here, finilhed, in the year 1764, what he 
calls, * The Hebrew Text confidered j being obfervations on 
* the novelty and Xelf-inconfiftency pf the maforetic fcheme 
' of pointing the facred Hebrew fcriptures.' lie had written

(Efferent on this fiibjea. Mr. Sievcwright has advanced no 
new argument againft the antiquity of the vowel points. His 
publication^ however, difcovcrs him to have ftudied the He- 
brew with great care, and to hive been no fmall proficient in 
that branch of literature. 

Jolin Gillies, LLJD. F.RJ5. 8c S.A. fon of the deceafed 
Robert Gillies, late merchant here, is the brightcft literary 
ornament of Brechin. His tranflation of the orations of 
tyfias and Ifocrates from die Greek, with his introduftory 
difcourfe on the hiftory, manners and charafter of the Greeks 
from the condufion of the Peloponnefian war to the battle of 
Chseronea, his firft publication, procured him no fmall de- 
gree of literary fame. It pointed liim out as a thorough Greek 
fcholar ; which I have ever confidered ' as the foundation of 
«H real literature. His hiftory of Greece is the completeft 
and exafbft of the kind which has yet appeared. His vic^ 
of rhe reign of the late king of Pruffia, and his parallel betwixt 
that prince and PJiilrp the Second of Macedon, difcovers Dr, 
Gillies to have inveftigated the principles, genius and confti** 
tutiottof the antient ftates of Greece, and the modem go- 
vernments of Europe, with an equal degree of attention and 
accuracy. He makes a confiderable figure in the republic of 
letters, and does honour to the city which gave him birth. 

Mr. William Guthrie, once minifter of Finwick, was bora 
in the parifh of Brechin. He was cldeft^fon of the laird of 
Fitfbrthie ; and refigned his paternal eftate in favour of ano- 
ther brother, that he might be at ntore leifure to profccutc 
the fiinAions of the £icred office. Mr, Guthrie had a 
fufficient meafiilt of "learning j but was peculiarly eminent 
for his piety, and^is fervent, indefatigable zeal in promoting 
the intercfts of Chriftianity. He wrote a little treatlfe, entitled,

In pcrafing the Statiftical Account of the parifh of Bfe 
chin) I was aftoniihed to find an aiSertion in my father's 
aamei relating to the circular tower in that city, which, as it 
can hardly gain belief, even from the moft credulous, is like* 
ly to bring reproach either on his underftanding or veracity, 
or on both^ and which, as equally falfe and impoffible to have 
been affirmed by him, I muft requeft that you vrill do him 
the juftice to have cancelled or contradiAed in as public a 
manner as it has been circulated. He was not capable of fay* 
ing, that the tower in queflion, ' js faid to bend like a willow

aflures me, that though many people have aflerted its vibra*

and moft attentively in fome of the mofl violent gufh of 
wind, he never yet perceived it ; and he is pofitive that fuch 
was the account he tranfmitted in his correfpondence with 
you. I am inclined, therefore, to believe that it mufl have 
been in your abfence, and through the inattention of thofe 
whom you employed at Edinburgh, that fixch a mifreprefen- 
tation has crept into the [h^ } or, perhaps the compiler has 
been milled by the account of that matter in Pennant's Tour, 
though, if I rightly recoiled, what Mr. Pennant fays is far 
from being fo unlikely and incredible as the language of the

quietl of ifune friends to your ufeful publication^ to trouble 
yoQ with a finr remarks on thefe fubjedls^ 

The akerattons in agricttkure may be faid to hate com;- 
JQcnced here about 24 years ago^ Little^ I believe, was done 
before that time in the way of indoiing, cleaning, and green 
crops-, and much yet remains to be done in the fanming lineu 
Things are, however, taking feme turn, and the i^t of im- 
provement begins to appear^ Even our ^crofters have now 
their little ipots of potatoes, turnips, (bwn grafi and' flax { 
though the latter is more rarely to be feen They, now fte 
the advantage of letting their turnips remain m the fidds 
through the ixdnter, that they may haVe the ufe of them in 
the {pring ; though they are a little expo(ed to the d6preda« 
, tions of ftraggling beafts, Winter herding being a^ yet little 
inown. 

But our great improves afe the refiding heritors. Allow 
me, in as (hort a manner as I can, t» take foxdt notice of 
what they have done. Mr. William Breb^ier of Laimey^ 
iriio, in his younger days, had been very fiiccefsitil in the 
mercantile line at Aberdeen, in the year 1767, made a pur» 
thafe in this parifh of a conflddmble extent of gtitnnd, but 
hilly, and much negle£ted. Hi^ fettlement here was of donfi^

^«^/— Before commercial credit mtrltiplied the figns of 
wealth, money bring of great value, the money lender had it 
frequefidy in his power to make, his own terms. The rich 
fanner feldom opened the cheft containing his hoard' to any,* 
but to a proprietor of land, who commonly a£Egned ashis fe- 
curity one or more farms, rent free, until the money borrow- 
ed by h^n fhould be repaid. This was called a wadfet Num- 
beis of thefe exifted in this pariih and county^ but are now 
jiniveffaBy redeemedr 

irf^jn«ftirr^.---The arable part of moft farms was divided 
into intown, fold, and burnt land. The intown (a third of 
which being by rotation annually in bear) was always crop- 
ed for graia. A part of folding ground, enriched by the dung 
of &amp;eep and of cattle, penned tliereon in Summer, duri»g 
the night and heat of the day, or fauched, (a kind of baftard 
fallow), and manured by a litde cMipoil dung, bore three, 
four, or five crops^ and then, according to .the quality of the 
gnmndy'Was sdlowed to reft four, five or £x years. The burnt 
land was pored by the plough^ and' die parings, .G6lleAed in 
heaps and reduced 4o aihes* were fpread upon :the field, by 
which rich crops Wferc for a long time produced on hill and 
dale. When the repetkkm of ^his pradUce reduced the foil 
upon the hills, the ridge was frequently gathered; and the 
Ibrrow, thereby gradually enlargfed, obtained the name of a 
icJkj for the moft part equalling, and not feldom exceeding 
^ fiz^ of- the ridge. By this abfurd praflice^ a great part of

Farming uteniils were extreooely rude. Feat &amp;o|D ttSe mofsi

the rougbeil inatenals werenesct introduced. To th^ fiic-*

ftnifted carts of hoqfie manufaAurei and pcoperly ^pted t^ 
the moving power, are every where in ufe. 

It deferves notice, that before rational fanning dawned, 
fervants had in fummer. little to do, but to drive ^^^ cuy 
grafs, and pull thiftle. They ilept through the greateft part 
of the day, ;md executed the little work incumbent ugQn 
them during the night. But now every lawful day throu^-

A largt number of the fettlqrs in the mofs of EsBcardino

from their native reildence in confequence of the exfienfive 
iheep farms whic^i have been eflabliihed of hte* Had op«

Fortunately, however, they have here foimd, not only an 
arylum but a comfortable fettlement, in which they are ufe* 
iully employed for themfelves, and with great benefit to their 
country. Was this mode of redaifning wade land adopted 
by the great proprietors in the Highlands \ they would not 
only retain their people, but, by retaining them, would aug*

entering upob the imprOTements made in Eincardme mois, 
it will be proper to give a fkort defcription of that moft» and 
of the fubjacent foil which is the object of thofe improTe- 
ments* 

The mots lies upon a field of clay, which is a continual 
tion of thofe nch, extenfive flats iti the neighbourhood oF 
Falkirk and Stirling, dtftinguiOied by the name of cor/ir^ 
"This clay, ^hich is one nniform homogeneous mafi, finking 
to a great depthi confiftS) near the fur£su:e, of diffident co- 
lours, and is-difpofed in layers. The uppermoft is grey; 
the next is rcddifh ; and the loweft. Which u the 'nioft 
fertile, is blue. Through the whole mafs not a pebUe is 
to be found* The only extraneous bodief it contains are 
feaihells, which occiu* in all the yarieties peculiar to the 
eaftem coaft of Scotland. Hiey are diipofed Ibmetimes ia 
beds, (tfnetimes fc^ttered inregularly at diflfanent depths. By 
attending to thefe circt^mftances, it c^hnot be doubted that 
the fea has been the means of the whole accumulation, and 
that it was carrie4 on ii| a gradual manner by the ordinary 
ebb and flow of the tide. Upon any other fuppofitidfi, why 
fhould there not have been a congeries of all the difierenk 
materials that compofe the furface of the furroonding heightslf 
But to whatever caufe the origin of this accumulation may be 
afcribed, certain if is that no- foil is more faYOoraUe to "vege- 
tation, or carries more abundant crops of evoy ImuL 

The furfifece of the clay, wbich^ upon the retreat of the 
fea,. had been kft in an almoft level plane, is every where 
thickly amiTcA with trees, (rhiefly oak ai^ birch, many 06

For the cutting oi'^oody the two common purpofes are, ei- 
ther to apfiAj it to its proper ufe, or that the ground it occurs 
pies masf be cultivated. Jn the prefent cafe, however, nei-* 
ther of thefe tads had been propofed, fince the trees, by be- 
ing left jtift as the)^ were cut were not only entirely loft, but 
the grdtmd was rendered totalfy unfit for cultivation^ Hence 
it is evident^ that the downfal of this wood muft be afcrtbed 
to fcsne noore eztraordfaiary caale } and to none more proba* 
biy than to that expedient, which, as jure Icarri from Dion 
Caffiiid and other hiftorians, the Romans put fo extenfivcly 
in pn£tice, to diilodge from their forefls the antient inhabit 
tants of the Britifh iflandsi 

This hypothefis acquires no fmaJl ciegree of force from a 
ci r comffa dice that occurred in May 1768, when a large round 
▼eflel of thin Brais and curioiis workmanihip, 25 inches in 
diameter and 16 inches in height, was difcovered upon the 
fur&amp;ce o# the clay buried linder the mofs. This veflel, found 
upcm the eftate 6f John Ramfay, Efq. of Ochteityre, was by 
that gentleman prejbited to the Antiquarian Society of Edin-^ 
burgh; in whoi^ mufeum it remains depoiited for preferva* 
1ml And in a lifl^f the various donations prefented to that 
fodetyj pnUiihed by than in I78a it is there denominated 
a * Roman camp kettle/ 

Between the clay and the mofi is foimd z ftratom 9 inchest 
thick, partly dark brown, and partly of a colour approaching 
to blacks This is a vegetable mould, accumulated probably 
by the plants that covered the ground pirevious to the growth 
of Ae wood, and by leaves from the trees thereafter. The 
di£ference of colour muft be owing to a difierence in the ve« 
getaUe fiabftaoces that cdmpofe.it. The brotm mould is

When ttst icctrmulations of bent^grafs and the mdfles had,

feet deep ; ai^d the intermediate fbrface beiiig wholly turned 
Into little hillocks has become dry and firm. By this means

thoroughly dry, it was burnt to afhes to ierte as^.a sianure. 
By this means they added to their farms about half sr rood 
of land yearly. But this plan proved onfuccefsful \ for by 
t}ie repeated aji^plication of thefe afhes, the foil was ren^ 
dered fo looie that the crops generally failed, adly. Many 
farmers ware wont to trench down the low mefi^ and tx cover 
it Jiirrovf deip with clay taben out of the trench. This^ 
though commetidabie as an attempt to improve^ proved 
likewife an ttnsvailing method ; becaufe in a dry feaibn the 
fuperficial tovering of clay retains fo little moifture that 
the crop cdmmonly fails^ 

It has Seen attempted to coter the mois with clay brought 
from the adjacent grounds. But what jBrom the neceflaiy 
impoveriikifient of^ the ground from which the day Was car*' 
ried, and the foftnefs of the mofs, this was foon found to b^ 
impra£licable. 

Draining has alfb befixi propofed as another mode of imi^' 
provement ; and it mufl: be acknowledgedj that by means of 
draining, many moiles have been converted both into arable 
and meadow grounds, which in the end became intereftlbg- 
improvements. But ixi a mofs, fuch as that of EincardiBCt 
this method wotdd be ine£[e£hial ; as for feveral feet, deep it 
is of fuch a nature, that upon being dry and divided iator 
parts, it would bloW- ^th the wind like chaff; and wiven 
thrown afide in the operation of digging peats» it lies for 
^rears without producing a fingle vegetable, c&amp;cept only a few 
plants of fbrrel. 

Hence it is evident, that all attempts to improve this mo(s 
muft ever prove abortive % and that the objeft to be had in 
yiew is the.acquilition of the valuable foil lying undemea^ ;

By the methods above defcribed from 100 to 200 acres ot

In the year 1766 Lord Kame; ehtered into pofifcflion olf 
ilie oftate of Blair Tlmmmond. Lotig before that period he 
was well icquainted with the mofsj and often lamented tha^ 
BO atterafic had ever fae^n made to turn It to advantage. Ma- 
ny diflSaent plans were now propofcd;' at length it was re- 
folved to attcmptj by means of water as the moft powerful' 
agent, entirely to fweep aS the whole body of mofs. 

That mofi might be floated in-water, Was abundantly ob* 
^ous; bat to find water in luffictent quantity was difficult, 
the only ftr^am at hand being employed to turn a corh-milL

having made an agreement "with the tenant who farmed the 
nun, and the tenants thiried^confenttng to pay the rent, he 
imniediately threw down the mUl, and applied the vmer to 
the above purpofe. 

In order' to 'determine the heft manner of condufling tlie 
operation, worlcnieh were now employed for a confidcrable 
time upon the Low Mofs both b^the day and by the pisce, 
to afcertain tlie expence for which a given quantity of mofs 
could be reiridved/ It was then agreed to opefsrte at a cer-

mofi. The dimeniioiis proper for the drain arc found to be 
two feet for the breadth and the fame for the depth. If 
fmaDer, it could not conveniently receive the fpadefuls of 
mois; if larger, the water would efcape, leaving the mofi 
behind. The drain ha# an inclination of one foot in loo 
yards : the more regularly this inclination is obfrrved through- 
ODt, the lefs will the mofs be liable to obftruftions in its pro- 
grds with the water. The drain being formed, the opera- 
tor marks off to a convenient extent along-fiOe of it a fec- 
tbn of mofs lo feet broad \ the greateft diftance from which 
he can heave his fpadefiil into the drain. This he repeatedly 
does till the entire mafs be removed down to the day^ He 
then digs a new drain at the foot of the mofs bank, turns the 
water into it^ and proceeds as before, leaving the mofi to 
porfue its courfe into the river Forth, a receptacle equally 
convenient and capacious ; upon the fortunate iituation of 
whichy h^qipily forming for feveral miles the fouthem boun- 
dary of the efh^e, without the interpofition of any neigh- 
bouring proprietor, depended the very exiften^e of the whole 
operations. 

When the mofs is entirely removed, the clay is found to 
be encumbered with the roots of different kinds of trees 
fiaoding in it as they grew, often very large : their trunks 
alfo are fre^ently found lying befide them. All thefe the 
tenants remove, often vrith great labour. In the courfe of 
their operations they purpofely leave upon the clay a ftrati^m 
of mofs G^ inches thick. This, m Spring, when the feafon 
offcn, they reduce to alhes, which in a great meafiure enfures 
the firft crop. The ground dxus cleared is turned overt 
where the drynefs admits, with a plough, and, where too 
&amp;ft, with a ipade. A month's expoiure to the fun, wind, 
and froftt reduces die day to a powder fitting it for the feed 
in March and April. A crop of oats is the firft, which fel-

dom fails of being plentiful, yielding from eight to ten bolls 
nfter one. 

In the year 1767 an agreement was made with one tenant 
for a portion of the Low Mofs. This, as being the firft ftcp 
towards the Intended plan, was then viewed as a coniiderable 
acquifition. The fame terms agrct*d upon with this tenant 
have ever finpe beeh obfcrved with all the reft. TTiey are 
as follow : 

Hie tenant holds eight acres of mofi by a tack of 38 years ; 
he is allowed a proper quantity of timber, and two bolls of 
oatmeal to fupport him while employed in rearing a hoixie ; 
the firft feven years he pays no rent ; the eighth year he pays 
one merk Scots ; the ninth year two merks ; and fo on with 
the addition of one merk yearly till the end of the firft 19 
years j during the laft five jears of which he alfo pays a^hen 
yearly. Upon the commencement of the fecond 19 years, 
he begins to pay a yearly rent of I2s. for each acre of 
land cleared from mofs, and 2S. 6d. for each acre not cleared, . 
alfo two hens yearly : A low rent indeed for fo fine a foil \ 
but no more than a proper reward for his laborious exertions 
in acquiring it. 

In the year 1768 another tenant was fettled. Thcfe two 
were tradefmen ; to whom the preference was always given, 
as- having this great advantage to recommend -them, that even 
when deprived of water they need never want employment. 
The motives t6at induced thcfe people to become fettlers 
were, ^, 1 he profpeft of an independent eftabliftiment for a 
number of years. 2flf/y, The mofs afforded them great abun- 
dance of excellent fuel ; to which was added the comfortable 
confideration, that, while bufiod in providing that neceflary 
article, they had the double advantage of promoting, at the 
fame time, the principal object of their fettlement. 

lTo(withftanding thefe inducements, Aill fettlers o£Eered

flovly ; to which t^o circumftances chiefly contributed : iji. 
The whole fsurmers furrounding the mofs threw every poffi* 
blc obftru£tion in their way. 2d/y, By people of all denomi- 
nations the fcheme- was vidwed as a chimerical proje£l^ and 
became a common topic of ridicule. The planj lxowever» 
fnpported itfelf; and in the jcar 1769 five more tenants 
agreed for eight acres eich 5 and thns 56 acres of Low Mofs 
were difpofed of. From the progrcfs made by the firft fet- 
ders, and th€ addition of thefe, the obloquy of becoming a 
mofs t^ant gradually became lefs regarded ; fo that iii the 
year 1772 two more were added; in 1773* three; and in 
17741 one; in all 13 : which difpofed of 104 acres; all the 
Low Mofs to which watei* could then be convey^d^ As wa* 
ter is the main fpring of the operation^ every tenant, beflde 
the attention neceflary to his (hare of the principal ftreamj 
£oUeAed water by every poflible means, making ditches 
round his portion of the mofs, and a rofervoir therein to re 
tain it till wanted. 

Tbc tenants in the Low Mofs having iiow beg^n to raife 
good crops, in the year 1774 fcveral pcrfons offered to take 
pofleffions in the High Mofs, upon condition that accefs to 
it fhoald be rendered prafticable. The High Mofs wanted 
many advantages that the Low pofleiled. To the Low Mofs^ 
lying contiguous to the furrounding arable lands, the accefs 
was tolerably' good ; but from the arable lands the High Mofs 
was feparated by 300 or 400 yards of the Low, which, even 
to a man, affords but mdiffcrent footing, and to horfes is 
altogether imprafticable. The Low Mofs is in general only 
tliree feet deep ; the High Mofs is frdili fix to twelve feet in 
depth.' -^ 

It will a]^ar at firil fight, . that without a tozd of con(l-i 
monication the High Mofs mufl for ever have prot^cd uncon^ 
querable^ Without delay therefore^ a road was opened to 

X^ the

the breadth of twelve feet, for feveral hundred yards in 
lengthy by floating o£F the mois down to the day. 

This being effeAed^ and at the fame time an opening gi* 
Ven to admit water, in the year 1775 twelve tenants agreed 
for eight acres of High Mofs each. In conikieration of t]|e 
greater depth of this part of f he mofs, it was agreed, that 
during the firift 19 years they Ihould pay no rent ; but for 
the fecond 19 years the terms of agreement were the lame 
as thofe made with the tenants in th^e Low Mofs. To the 
above-^mentioned tenants every degree of encouragement was 
given ; as upon their fuccefs depended, in a great meafure^ 
the difpofal of the great quantity of mofi ftiil remaining. 
But their fuccefs, however problematical, was iuch, that 
next year, 

1776, 6 more took 8 acres each, 

1778, 4 ^ 

1779, 3 

1780, X 

1781, I 

1782, I 

In all, including thofe upon the Low Mois, 4a tenants, oc« 
cupying 336 acres. 

Though for fome time the difpofal of the High Mofi went 
but flowly on, it was not for want of tenants \ but the num- 
ber of operators was already fufficient for the quantity of wa- 
ter ; to have added more would evidently have been impro* 
dent. 

• In the year 1783 Mr Drummond entered into pofleffion 
of the eftate of Blair-Drummond, and went fuUy into the 
plan adopted by his predccefibr for fiibduing the mofi. At 
thi^ time there ftill remained undifpofed of about 1000 acres 
of High Mofs. As water was the great defideratum, it was 

determined)

detennmcd, that to obtain that neceilarj article neither psdns 
nor evpence ihould be wanting;. Steps were accordingly 
taken to afcertain in what manner it might be procured to 
noft advantage. 

Meanwhile, to prepare for new tenants, a fecond road pa^ 
raOel to the former, at the diftance of half a mile, was im« 
mediatdf begun and cut, with what water could be got, 
down to the clay, 12 feet broad and 2670 yards long, quite 
acrols the mols. This opening was previoufly neceflary, that 
operators might get a drain formed in the clay to dired the 
water ; and it was to remain as a road that was abfolutely ne- 
ceflary, and which relieved fettlers from an expence they 
were unatde to fupport. Thefe preparations^ the progrefs of 
the former tenants, and the profped of a farther fupply of 
water, induced 10 more to take pofleffions in the year 1783 $ 
in tke year 1784, 18 more took po0eflions ; and in 1785 no 
fewer than 27;— 4n all, 55 tenants in three years, which 
diQx)red of 440 acres more of the High Mofs. 

As the introduction of an additional ftream to the mois 
was to be a work both of nicety and expence, it was necef* 
fary to proceed with caution. For this reafcm feveral eagi« 
neers were employed to make furveys and plans of the di&amp; 
ferent modes by which it might be procured. In one point 
they all agreed, that the proper fource for fomifhing that 
fopply was the river Teithj a large and copious ftream that 
pafles within a mile of the mofs : but various modes were 
fropokd for effeCHng that purpose. 

To carry a ftream from the river by a cut or canal into 
the mofs vras found to be impradHcable ; and Mr Whit- 
worth * gave in a plan of a pumping machine, whidi he was 
of opinion wlould anfwer the purpofe extremely well.

Soon after this Mr George Meikleof Alloa^ a very (kUful

and his father's invention jointly. This machine is fo ex^

invention : But perfons ikilled in mechanics view machinery 
with a very diflferent eye ; for to them fimi^icity is the firft 
recommendation a machine can poflefs. Accordingly^ upon 
feeing the model fet to work, Mr. Whitworth, with that 
candour and liberality of mind that generally accompany ge« 
nius and knowledge, not only gave it the greateft praifct but 
declared that, for the purpofe. required, it was fuperior to

Sketch fccoiid contains a plan of the ciftern, and exhibits 
the mariner in which the water is filled into the buckets. 

The diathcter of the wlieel to the extremities of the float- 
boards is a8 feet ; the length of the float-boards, 10 feet. TIic 
wheel makes nearly four revolutions per minute \ in which 
time it difcharges into ihc ciftern 40 hogdieads of water. 
But thk is not all the wheel is capable of performing; for 
by feverai accurate trials by Meffrs Whitworth and Meikle, 
in the refult of which, though made feparately, they perfeft- 
ly agreed, it was found that the wheel was able to lift no Ids 
than 60 faogflieads per minute ; Init that the dfiameter of the 
pipes through which the water defcends from the ciftern 
would not admit a greater jiiantity than what they already 
receive. 

To a perfon at all converfant in hydraulics, the refcm- 
blance of this to the Perfian wheel fniift be obvious j and 
feidced it is probable, that from the Perfian wheel the firft 
idea of this machine Was derived. But admitting this, ftiU 
Ae fiipcriority of the prtfcnt vheel is, in moft rcipefts, fo 
confpicuous, as to entitle it to little lefs praife than the firll 
invention. For, i^, In the Perfian wlicel, the buckets be- 
ing all moveable, muft be conftantly going out of Order : In 
this wheel they arc all immoveable, confequcntly never can 
be out of order, arf/j?, Inftead of lifting the water from the 
bottom of the fall as in the Perfian wheel, this wheel lifts it 
from the top of the fall, being from four to4ive feet higher ; 
by which meafis fome additional power is gained. 32//)', By 
means of the three fluiccs, {a and *, 5, fig, i.) in whatever fi- 
tuation tht river may be, the quantity of the water to be raifed 
b fo nicely adjufted to that of the moving power, as conftant- 
ly to prcfervc the wheel in a fteady and equable motion. In

fbmetiines to cany the water clean aver the ciftenij (bmetimes 
to drop it entirely behind, bat feldom fo as fully to diichai^ 
the whole contents of the buckets into the ciftem. 

It is however but candid to remark, that this machine Ia-» 
hours under a fmall defeA, which did not efcape the ob 
lervation of Mr Whitworth ; namely, that by raifing the wa* 
tcr about 3^ feet higher than the ciftem where it is uhimate* 
ly delivered, a Anall degree of power is loft. To this in- 
deed he propofed a remedy; but candidly oonfefled, thatf 
as it would render the machine fbmewhat morecomplex^ 
and would alfo increafe the friAion, he thought it more ad« 
viiable to keep it in its prefent ftate. At the fame time' he 
jofily obferved, that as the fiream by which the whetl 19 
moved is at all times copious and powerful, the fmall lois of 
power ofcafioned by the above circumfbinces was of little or 
BoavalL 

This fiream is detached from the Teith at the place whero 
Aat river approaches neareft to the mofs* The furface of the 
latter is about 15 feet higher than that of the former; the 
dflem is therefore placed 17 feet above the fur&amp;ce of the 
fiream, fo as to leave a declivity fufficient ^o deliver the 
water upon the furface of the mofs. 

The pipes through which the water defcends from the ciC* 
tern are compofed of wooden barrels hooped with iron 4 feet 
long and 18 inches in diameter within* 

In thefe pipes, having been conveyed under ground for 
3^4 yards from the ciftem, the water at once emerges into 
an open aqueduA* This aquedud, which was formed accord- 
ing to a plan by Mr. Whitworth, is conflrufled wholly of 
earth or clay ; and in order to keep the water on a level with . 
the furface of the mols, it is for nearly two thirds of its 
coorfe elevated from 8 to 10 feet above the level of the ad« 
jacent g^unds ; the bafe being 40 feet broad^ the fummit 18

tlie tenxuQfltiozi of tbe pipes ^ from whence extending above 
1400 jardst it diicbarges the water intp a canal fomied for 
its reception on the furf^e of the mofi* 

For raifing the water to this height there w^xc two rea«- 
Cms. i^, That not only where.it was delivered on the mofi^ 
bat even after being conveyed t&amp; the moft diftant comersp 
it might ftill t'etain fufficient power to tranfport the jpofs to 
the nver Forth. 2diy^ That refervoirs of a fufficient height 
might be formed in the mofs to retain the water delivered 
during ixl^t. 

Li confequence of Mr Whitworth^s advice, a contnuQ was 
entered into with Mr Meikle in fpring 1787 j and by the 
end of OAober in that year, the wheel, pipes, and aque- 
do£l, were all completely finiihed : and what, in ib complex 
-tond eztenfive an undertaking, is by no means common, the 
difierent branches of the work were fo completely executed^ 
and {o happily adjufted to each other, that upon trial the e£- 
ficft anfwered the mofl: fanguine expeAations. The ^tal cx- 
pcnce exceeded loool. fterling. 

To induce the proprietor to CDE^baili: in this imdertaking, 
the mofs tenants had of their f/tm accord* pr^jpMfly come 
under a formal a^agement to psCy the interefl of any fum 
that might be expended in procming a fupp^ pf water. But 
he was determined they fhould not enjoy by halves the fweets 
of this long^^iihed-fo]^ acquifitioil* With a view, therefore, 
not only to reward th^Br paft indnftry, but to xmS^ them to 
fature exertions, be at once fist them ^^ &amp;o^ their engagie«-

This additional ftream, thoagh tiigMy beneficial, yet is not 
more than fufficient to keep 46 men at conftant work. But 
fuch a quantity as would give conftant work is not necefla-

pofe, a fmall ftream that defcended from the higher grounds 
was diverted from its courfe and brought into the mois. 
From want of level this ftream could not be delivered to the 
greateft advantage ; - namely, upon the furfaoe of the mois. 
Yet by making, at a confiderable expence, a drain half a mile 
long, and a refervoir for the night-water^ it was rendered of 
much importance. And during the whole winter months^ as 
well as m- fummer, after every fiiU of rain, it keeps 15 pcr- 
fons fully employed. 

In the year 1787 two more tekiants agreed for eight acres 
each; in 1788, four; in 1789, eight; in 1790, feur tenants, 
all agreed for the (asat number of acres. 

The whole mofs was now difpofed of except that part call- 
ed Phw^mofs^ which comprehended about 400 acres. Here it 
is twice the liAsal breadth, fo fluid that a pole may be throft 
with one hand to the bottom.; and the interior part, for 
near a itiile bcoadr is tluree feet above the Ic^el of all the raft 

of

of the mofs. Hitherto the maay snd various difficulties that 
prefented themielves had been xjvercoxne by perfevisraace and 
jezpence. But here the extraordinary elevation .of the qio- 
rais, joined to its great fluidity, feexned to e:!iLclude aU poffibili- 
.ty of admitting a ftream of water ; and it was the general 
iypinion that the mofs-operations had now arrived at their /^ 
plus ubray and that this qiorafs .was doomed to remain a nui- 
sance for ages to come. 

But the proprietor had now advanced lb far that he pould 
jiot fubmit to retreat ; and he confidered himfelf 9S| in fome 
meafure, pledged to the country for the f ompletion of this 
undertaking. To detail the various methods praQifed to in- 
iToduce a ftream of water into that morafs, would prove te- 
dious. It is fufficient to f^y, that after a thoufand unfuccefs- 
fill efibrtSy attended with much trouble a^d fconfiderable ex- 
pence, the point at laijb was gained, and a ftream of water was 
brought b, and carried fairly acrofs the centre of the morale. 

The greateft obftacle was now ipdeed overcome \ but ftill 
another remained of no fmall moment, namely, the difcour* 
agement given to fettlers from the total iippoilibility of e^efl- 
ing habitations upon the furface of this morafs. To find a 
remedy for this evil was difficult. Happily a refource at la^ 
occurred. This was to barg^n with a certain number of )he 
old tpiants whofe habitations were neareft, to take Ieafe$ of 
portions of the mori^fs. But as fome additional aid was here 
neceiTary, it wjji^ agreed that 12L fterling lboi)ld be gradually 
advanced to each tenant till he ihpuld a;:complifl^ the clear- 
ing of an acre, for which he or his fufcejpbr is bound to pay 
12s. of yearly rent, equal to 5 per cent, upon thj; fuip adyan- 
/ced. When this point fhall bi? gained, they are bound to dif- 
pofe, as moft agreeable^ to themfelves, either of their old or 
pi their new po^[effion j for which, when once an acre is 
ic^e^rpd, purchafers will not be wanting. 



171 tienerd Appendix to f Vol. vi# 

In confcqccticc of the abarc arnmgcmciit, during the yeai* 
1791 no fewer than 35 of the old tenants agreed, upon the 
forefaid conditions, for 8 acres each of the Flow-mofi. Thn$ 
1200 acres are now difpofcd of to 115 tenants. But when 
thefe 35 tenants fiiall each have cleared their acre, then, ac- 
cording to agreement, 35 additional tenants will fpeedily be 
acquired ; and the mofs will then contain in all 150 families. 

To the leafes already granted to the tenants in the Hig^ 
Mofs, it is now determined tp add a further period of 19 
years, (making in all 57 years,) during which they are to pay 
one guinea per acre; a rent not greater than the land is 
"worth even at pefent, but greatly helow its probable value 
at that iiftant period. This, it i^ hoped, will prove to the 
tenants i fufBcient incitement to continue their operations 
till their pdffcflions are completely cleared from mofs. 

Having now gone through, in detail, the whde progrels 
of the colony fince its firft fettlement ii the year 1767 \ it 
ftill oemains to take a general view of the efieAs produced by 
that eftablifhment. 

For feveral years, at firft, the water was ufed chiefly to caf-r 
ry off mofs, in the forming pf new roads, and preparing re- 
fcrvoirs 5 which cpnfiderably retarded the principal objeft of 
gaining land. Neverthelefs there have been cleared full 300 
acres of excellent land, producing lyheat, barley, oats, and 
clover, yielding from fix to twelve bolls after one. 

From the nature of the undertaking, there is good reafoi^ 
to fuppofe that the operations will yearly advance with great- 
er rapidity ; efpecially as the greater number of Ae fettleri 
have only of late begun to ^erate. Many, bcfidcs maintiJn- 
ing their families otherwife by occafional employments, have 
in the High Mofs cleared in a year one rood of land ; ibmc 
have cleared two^ fome three roods, and in the Low Mofi an 
acre.

It was a remark often made, even by perfons of fome obx 
(ervation, that by colle£ting together fucb a number of peo- 
ple, Kincardine woukl be overftocked y and the confcqaeuce 
woold be tlieir becoming a bmthen on the pari(h : for iu th6 
balk of them were iaboorers not bred to any trade and po£- 
feflcd of little iiock, it was forefeen that, for fome tia;ie they 
could not afford to confine themfelves folely to the mofs, 
from which the retiirn muft be flow ; but behoved, for iin- 
mediate fubfiftence, to work for daily hire* Happily thefe 
prediAjons have proved entirely groundlefi ; for fuch is the 
growing demand for hands in this country, that not only do 
the whole of thefe people find employment whenever they 
choofe to look for it, but their wages have been yearly en- 
ereafing from the time of their firft eftabiifhment. In ihort, 
they have proved to the corner where they are fet down a 
mod ufeful nurfery of labourers; and thofe very futners who 
« at firA fo flrrongly oppofed tlieir fettlement, now fly to them 
' as a furc refoiirce for every purpofc of agriculture. Still they 
confider the mofs-operations as their principal bufmefs; none 
pay them To well; and when they do leave it to earn a little 
jnoney, they return with checrfulnefs to their proper employ- 
ment. Many of them already raife from lo to 60 bolls of 
grain, and have no occafion to go off to other work ; which 
will foon be the cafe with the whole. Their original flock, 
indeed, did not often exceed a^l. and fome had not even 
loL; but what wa$ wanting in ftock is compenfated by in- , 
dttftry. 

Of the whole inhabitants fnll nine tenths are Highlander^, 
from the neighbouring pariflies of Callander, Balquhidder, 
&amp;c. ; a fobcr, frugal, and indufl;rious people, who, inured to 
hardihipB in their own country, are peculiarly qualified to en*

gao^ and fpeaklng a dificrent language from the people a^ 
«Qongft whom they are fettledj they confider themfelves in z 
manner as one family tranfported to a foreign land. And 
hence upon all occaiions of difficulty, they fly with alacrity 
to each others relief. Neither ought it to be forgotten, that, 
from their firft fettlement to the {wefent day, not a fingle in- 
fiance has occiurred amongft them of theft, bad neighbour-* 
liood^ or of any other mifdemeanour, that required the ihtcff- 
fOikion of the civil inagiftrate. Nor, however poor in cir* 
cumftances, has any one of them ever (looped to folicit zf^ 
fiftance from the funds of the pariih appropriated to that 
purpofe* 

Thongl^few of the tenants entered with a krge ftdck, one 
only has been obliged jLo leave the mofs from incapacity to 
. proceed. Many indeed have fpent their fmall ^ocks, and 
even run a little in debt: but in this cafe they have been per- 
mitted to fell their tacks upon the following conditions : x/t^ 
That the purchafer fhall be a good man ^ 2^, Th^t the feller 
IbaU take another poileffion. By this manoeuvre a new in* 
habitant is gained ; while the old one, relieved from debt» 
and aided by paft experience, recommences his •operations 
wth doable fpirit upon a new pofleffion. The monied raap» 
again has at once a houfe and a piece of ground } the wvit 
of wliich, chiefly, ftartkd new beginners^ 

Some have even made a kind of tr;ide .of felling ; infi- 
mnch, that from the year 1 774 to the prefcnt, 1 792, no fewer 
than fifty fales have taken place, producing in all the fum of 
L. 849 fierling. This proved from time to time a moft fea^ 
Ibnable recroit to the colony, and gave new vigour and ipi* 
irits to the whole. 

The number of the fettlers is produdUve of an excellent 
cfie£t; that although fome are generally abfent, enough (till 
ftfxain to occupy the water conftantly. In a favourable !|ay

there may be feen hundredsi men, women, and children, la** 
bouring with the utmoft ai&amp;duitj. The women declare they 
can make more by working at the mofs than at their wheel ; 
and iiich is their general attachment to that employment, 
that they have frequently been difcovered working by moon- 
light. 

Another happy confequence arifing from their numbert 

is the great quantity of mofs they confume for fuel. There 

are in all x 15 families. Each family -requires at an arcrage 

10 dargues * of peats yearly. Each darg uncovers a fpacc 

equal to i o fquare yards of clay : fo that by cafting peats, the 

mols tenants gftin yearly stbout 6 roods of land. 

' The advantage, too, of providing their fiiel with to littk 

trouble, is very great. They require yearly 1150 dargs of 

peats ; which^ as each darg when dried and ftacked is va- 

hied at five {hillings, are worth 28 7I. los. fierling; a fum 

which otherwife muft have been expended on the prime coft 

and carriage of coals. Many of them caft peats for fale j and 

looL worth are yearly difpofed of in the town of Stirling, 

the village of Don^n, &amp;c« 

Though mofs-work be laborious, it is at the fame time 
amufing. The operator moves the mofs five feet only at a 
medium;. and the Wfiter, like carts in other cafes, carrying 
it ofi^as faft as it b throwain, excites him to activity. Still 
he muft fubmit to be wet from morning to night. But ba-« 
bit reconciles him to this inconvenience ; while his houfe 
and arable land fill his eye and cheer his mind. Nor is it 
(bund that the health of the inhabitants is in the finalleft de- 
gree injured either by the nature of the work or the vicinity 
ef the mofs.

*Tht qaantity of mofs that one man can more in a day is 
furprifing % when he meets with no Interruption, fddom left 
than 48 cubic yards, each weighing 90 ftoncs. The weighty 
then, of mofs moved per day is. no lefi than 4320 ftooes. A 
cubic yard is moved into the water, and of couric carried inta 
the river Forth, for one farthing. It follows, that the ex* 
pence of moving 48 cubic yards b one (hilling. But the 
fame quantity moved to the fame diftance by carts would coi: 
24 {hillings. Hence the advantage derived from the poffi- 
biiity of floating mofs in water, and the great importance of 
having water for that purpofe. 

The mofs, when contrafted with the rich lands furfoond* 
ing, appeared, efpecially before the improvements, a very 
dreary fpot 5 one wide unvaried wild, totally unproduftivc, 
unfit even to fiimiih fuflenance to any animal, except here 
and there a few wretched ftraggling flieep. Befides, it en- 
tirely cut off all connection bebwixt the farms on either fide ; 
amongft which no intercourfe was praAicable but by a cir- 
cuit of fcveral miles. 

The fcene is already greatly changed. The following are

An excellent gravefl^ed road, 20 feet wide, arid a mild and 
i half long, is now carried quite acrofs the mofs. By this 
means, in the firft places a fhort and eafy interconrfe is efta«

The poileilions are laid off in the manner heft fitted for 
the operations ; and are divided by lanes nmning in ftraxght 
lines parallel to each other. Parallel to thefe again the drains 
are carried ; and this ftraight direAion greatly facilitates the 
progrefs of the water with its load of mofs. Upon the bank 
of mofs fronting the lanes, the operation of floating is be* 
gun V and twenty or thirty people are fometimes feen heaving 
mofi into the fame drain. That the water may be the more 
conveniently applied, the lanes include between them the 
breadth of two pofleflions only. The new houfes are ereftcd 
upon each fide of thefc lanes at the diftance of loo yards 
from each other* 

Before the formation of lanes and roads, and while yet no 
ground was cleared, the firft fettlers were obliged to crcft 
their houfes upon the furfacc of the mofs. Its foftneis denied 
all acce&amp;to ftones ; which, at any rate, are at fuch a diftance 
as would render them too expenfive. Settlers, therefore, were 
obliged to conftruft their houfes of other materials* Upon 
the Low Mofs thcrd is found for this purpofe great plenty of 
fod or turf, which accordingly the tenants ufe for the walk ot 
their houfes. For the rudenefs of the fabric nature, in fomc 
mcafiire compenfates, by overfpreading the outilde with a 
luxuriant coatiAg of heath and other moorifh plants, wliich 
has a very pidlurefque appearance. 

But upon the High Mofs there is no fod to be found. There 
the tenant mufl go differently to work. Having chofen a 
proper fituation for his houf he firft digs four trenches down 
to the clay, fo as to feparate from the reft of the mofs a folld 
mafs, containing a^ oblong, reftangular area, fufiiciently large 
for his intended houfe.. This being done, he then fcoops out 
the middle of the mafs^ leaving on dl fides the thicknefs of

three feet for w^ 5 over which he throws a f oof^ fuch as 
that by which other cottages are commonly covered. 

Upon the fofteft parts of the mofs, even thefe walls cannot 
he obtained. In fuch places the houfes are built with peat 
Ajxg out of the mofs, and clofely comprcffed together while 
in a humid ftatc *. It is neceflary even to lay uponlhe fur- 
face a platform of boards to prevent the walls from finking ; 
which. they have frequently done when that precaution was 
negleded. ' After all, to ibmp with the foot will (hake the 
whole fabric as well as the mofs foriifty yards around^ This, 
at firft, ftartled the people a good .deal  but cuftom foon ren- 
dered it £umliar« * 

.The colonifts have now n^ade ccmfiderable advancement 
in rearing better habitations for their comfort and conve- 
nience. Their huts of turf are but temporary lodgings. As 
foon as they have cleared a little ground, they build houfes 
of brick; when the prc^rietor .a Second time furnifties them 
with timber gratis. It has alfo been found neceflary to relieve * 
them entirely from the payment of the bwdenfome tax up- 
on bricks ; a tax which furely was never intended to fall on 
fuch poor induftrious adventurers ; and which, without this 
afiiftance, would have proved a moft effefliial bar to the cm- : 
ployment of thefe materials. 

There are now crefted in the mofs 69 brick-houfcs, fub- 
ftantially buitt with lime. The total expence amounted .to 
1033I. ftcrling. And it is a very comfortable circnmftance, 
that the money expended upon thefe honfcs is moftly kept 
in circulation among the inhabitants themfelves: for as a 
number of them have learned not only to manufaifture buf 
alfo to build bricks, and as others who have horfes and carts

that too at a time w^en, owing to the gre^ enlargement of

<p>Afwfrfl//.-— There is much coal and linic and ironftone in 
this parifla. Some of the liitieftone which is now wrought at 
Auchincloich is not above 8 or lo feet below the ground, 
and very cafily come at ; it is generally cut out 5f the quarry 
in fummcr, then led away by the farmers to their farms, and 
there burned in kilns about harveft ; and after iliat led out 
and fprcad upon the ground, which they intend to plough 
down in fpring. 

Some of the llmcfione in other parts of the parifli, fuch as 
the Bafliaw, Milnfide, Glengarth, Barhill, and Lochridge is 
much deeper and fcldom wrought. The ftones are of a 
grey or yellow colour; many of them twinkling with mi- 
ca and quartz, and fome of them imprefled with the fi- 
gures of iliells a|id plants. 0)als arc found here in great 
abundance, ftretcliing in two or three ftrata in feveral fields. 
One ftratum near the old manfion lK)ufe of Kilbirnie is not 
above 5 or 6 feet below the furface, but as it is not very 
thick it is not much wrought ; other ftrata in the BarhiU 
and Lochridge arc much deeper and yet wrought to great ad- 
^rantage. 

There is one pit at prefent with a fire engine near the

A view has been ^efented of the general effeA of the di- 
vifion of the parilh out of mn-ridge, to the period when the 
account was drawn up. As an opportimity is now afforded, 
St may be proper to notice the progrefs, with fome partiiu- 
lars of the improvement. 

The tenants have generally proceeded in ere£Ung better 
houfes, cohering them with draw and mortar, inftead of a 
flighty temporary cover of ftraw ropes *— in clearing the 
tround of carth^faft and' loofe ftones;-— an draining wet 
W;— in making the ridges. ftraight, and dreiHng the fur- 
face ;— in bringing on lime }---and in ufing meliorating crops 
of turnip, potatoes, and artificial grafles. Both in peribnal la- 
bour and expence, they have exerted themfelves. 

The dung of the farm they lay on the ground in regular, 
fttcceffive order \ difiregarding the former diftin£)ion of out* 
fcld and in-field. They ufc proper rotations of crops. They

work with lighter ploughs, ind fewer 'cattle;— with foxnc 
new inftruments of huftanh75 and others improved. 

A few more fubftantial tenants, whofe grounds lie near 
Aberdeen, by driving dung from that place, along with other 
means, have brought them to a high ftate of cultivation.— 
From an exchange in refpeft to half of the glebe, for accom- 
modation of a road, foincthing was necefiary to be done* 
I The exchanged land is drained, where needful j freed from 
ftones, iriclofed, and improved. In a marfhy part of the 
other half of the glebe, drains have been filled, and the fur- 
face made up by feveral hundred cart-loads of ftones arid 
earth. — ^Mir Robert Davidfon, fcucr of Balnagalk, has his 
principal fields in great heart, producing, in particular, valua- 
ble crops of potatoes, cultivated by gardeners and others ; 
and is making progref^ in clearing, manuring, and indofing 
his poorer and more wafte lands.— Mr Robert Smith, mafbn, 
lately feuer of North Loirftoim, did a great deal in different 
ways of improving both the wet and the dry ground \ and 
built an excellent fteading, inclofing part of the farm with 
liibftantial ftone dykes. The improvement is carrying on^ 
unHer the prefent proprietor ; and in a little time four or five 
thoufand ells of ftone fence, inqlofing above a hundred acres 
of arable ground, laid out in parks, where one was not be« 
fore, will he completed.— Captain Charles Adamfon im^ 
proves with fpirit his feu, both mclioratiiig the arable land^ 
and gaining on the moor.— Mr Colin Innes, furveyor of land^ 
who pofleffes the largeft farm of Mr Meni^ies of Pitfbddels^ 
befidcs the ufual modes of improvement, has covered fix or 
feven acres of light black foil with clay. It renders the 
ground firmer to fupport a crop firom lodgings mpre retentive 
of clover, and more productive. He alfo firft introduced

tailing and removing the furfade {i:ones he has, by a trench- 
ing plough^ torn in more than twenty acres of ftony, barren 
heath, repeatedly and in different dire^ons ploughed it, 
taken off the ftones, and divided it into fmall fields with 
firaight ridges. Beiides lime m fufiicient quantity, he has 
brought dung from Aberdeen, »i the whole at a great ex- 
pence, laying it down, after turnip and grain, with grafs 
feeds. It formerly was of no value, and fecms improved at 
too high a cofl foe the ihort and uncertain term of leaie* 
Such exertion deferves encouragement. Some acres more of 
-detached pieces are brought Ukewife from a barren ftate \ and 
about ten acres 01 moor are in progrefs of cultivation, and 
will complete the rendering wholly, arable TorfyhiU, the top 
of which lay barren in the midft of a cultivated country,— 
Some individuals have begun to follow Mr Innes's example, 
in taking in ground with the plough from the moor. 

But the moft particular account of the manner of improve-* 
ment, on a confiderable portion of the lately divided and 
feued ground, appears from a letter, on the fubjef): of the 
cultivation of his feus, by Mr David Morice, advocate in 
Aberdeen. As it alfb contains fome articles which fe^m in*

Mafter of Mortifications of AberdeeOj feu rights of threm 
lots of the eaft divifion of the barony, which fell to him, viz. 
Altens, containing about 131 acres arable, and abont 200 
acres moor, pafture, and hill ground ; for which I pay 22!. 1 2s« 
fterling in money, and 24 bolls of oat-meal; of fen duty: 
and Middletown said Tizllos united, containing about 32 
acres infield, 70 acres outfield, and about 250 acres of hill^ 
moor and pafture j for which I pay of feu duty 42!. 8s. dar- 
ling in money, and 46 bolls of oat-meal. 

^ Altens, you know, lies along the fhore on the fouth fide of 
the eaft point of the Grampian mountains, and Middletown 
and Tullos lie a little within the land on the north fide : and 
they all join at the ridge of the hHl. 

* When I entered to poflfeffion at Whitfunday 1786, there 
was not a fingie inolofure upon any of the lots ; and there 
was not a houfe of any kind either upon Altens or Middle- 
town; The firft thing therefore, of importance, which I did, 
was to build a good farm-houfe, and complete fet of offices, 
upon each of thefe two lots. Upon Tullos there were foroe 
cottages, which were left in the occupation of the former 
"crofters. After this, I fet to work to bring the ground into 
fome order, beginning with what had been ploughed at fbmc 
former period. 

* ^iir^w.— The 13a acres on Altens were cntlrciy of outfielf 
gro\md, and ikirts cut ofiT from other farms in dividing the 
lots i-**Iay floping from the bill to the fea bank ;  qnd were 
encumbered with cairns of ftones between the ridges, and 
many carth-fa(V ftones in the ridges themfelves. 

* I have now removed great part of thefe ftones, and by means 
of them, have already inclofed with fubftantial ftone dykes 
near 80 acres ; and am proceedmg to clear and indofe the 
remainder in the fame manner.-*-Having found the arable

ground verj apt to be hurt by firffecc water, dcfcending from 
the hill and moor after rain, and by water ipringing out of 
the ground at the point of ieparation betwixt the heath and 
green ground ; I contrived to rid the ground of both^ by cot^ 
ting a ditch, four or five feet in depth, along the foot of the 
moor, juft at the point of feparation. The c^th taken from 
the ditch I threw on the lower bank  which ferved at the 
fame time to form a fort of fence, and give free admif&amp;on ta 
the water coming from the moor into the ilkch. This ditcla 
had a wonderful efFeA on the lower grounds ; and was con* 
trived and executed long before Mr Elbington, and his mode 
of a iimilar nature, for which he has obtained a liberal pre** 
niium from government, were heard of, and even before 1 
had fcen Nugcnt*s travej^ in Rlecldenburg, where the faxao 
plan IS ftated as having been praftifcd many years ago. 

* The laying dry the wet land below was not the only bc- 
ticft acquired by means of this ditch •, for by the water col- 
leftcd in it, I have been enabled to convey water into every 
one of my inclofures by crofs ditches, and to flood, at the 
proper feafons, fuch of them as arc dry. The flooding has 
had a voy happy effecl ; and I have had great crops on tlic 
ground which has befti treated in that manner. The flood- 
ing of land is perfectly well underftood in dils country, and 
has been praftifed above fifty years paft, fo that we have no 
need of any infiruftions from Mr. Stevens on that point.—* 
On this farm of Altefts, I nc^ raife turnip, bear, oats, peafct 
tares and hay ; and they all anfwer well. I hate not yet had 
any great crop of potatoes on it, but no fair trial on proper foil 
has yet been made. This year I had oats about 6 feet high on 
ground, 'which at my entry was^ not confidercd worth zod^ 
per acre. I have, for improving this farm, ^fed all kinds of 
manure which I could get hold of, lime, fca ware, fiflier dung, 
ftccp dung, ftable-yard dung, and ftot. And they all anfwer

t?cll. I now render the carriage of my lime from Torry pier, 
within two miles diftancej a very eafy matter, as I bring it in 
return when fending the caufe-way Hones, which I manufac* 
ture in clearing my fields, to that pier, to be fhipped for 
London. 

I do not wait for the fea ware drifting in after ftonns, as 
is generally done, but in calm* weather fend out people in 
fmall boats along the fhore, and cut it from the rocks at low 
water, and land it at a creek, which I |iave cleared out ^ and 
fitted with a fmall pier for landing lime, and accommodating 
fiihing boats ; though I have not got thefe laft purpofes yet 
entirely to anfwer. I have made a trial of (heep on this fiinn, 
and found they were tolerably profitable ; but finding that to 
fatten them properly required more grafs than I can yet fpare 
from my horfe^, oxen and cows, I fiave for the prefent part* 
ed with them.— —I have planted a few acres of rocky ground 
near the farm houfe with firs, birch, larix, aller, oak and 
willows, which hitherto thrive very well. And I mean to 
plant a great deal more, as foon as I can get the ground 
inclofed. 

The fea banks produce a great deal of fine natural- grafs, 
among which I have found r^al yellow clover, with flowers 
as large as thofc of t»gh cultivated red clover ** In fum- 
mer the banks are covered with cowflips, and other fragrant 
wild flowers. 

The coaft along this farm is bold and rocky. In many 
places the rock is granite, but is difiicult to work. In fome 
places there are large difUnA veins of quartz running thrc/ 
the rock : but though it is ufeful in glazing flone ware, I 
have never yet been able to find a purchafer for it. I could

fiimifli many tons of it. In the rock are many caverns or 
excavationSj arched in a very wonderful manner. One of 
thefc runs a great way under the land. The brig of ae hair 
already mentioned, is within' this farm 5 and the breall of the 
Tock on each iide of the inlet which divides the iflei from 
the mainland, b ftupendous. 

' MiddUtovm and Tullos^-'^Oti my farms of Middletown 
and TuUos I have cleared, drained, inclofed and cultivated 
ground to prdtty much the fame extent as on' Altens ^ and* on 
thofc fidds I have raifed very weighty crops. ' This year in- 
deed they were rather ^00 weighty for fafety^- and fomc of 
tbc oats, which were higher than the furrounding dykes, fell 
io\vn under the rain and fufFered a gopd deal. 

• At my entry to Middletown there was on it a fwamp to 
the extent of nearly 20 acres, almoft covered with \iTiter, and 
fo boggy that even a perfon on foot could fcarce walk upon 
it This was owing partly to a little ftream of water, which 
comes down the valley, being fuiSeFed to fpread on it, for 
want of a clear channel being kept, and partly from the 
fprings burfting from the foot of the mountain to the 
fcuth of it. The firft malady I remedied by cutting a clear, 
firaight channel of 8 or 10 feet wide for the ftream ; and the 
other I remedied in a great meafure by cutting fuch a ditch 
aloQg the foot of the mountain, as I had done at Altens. Af- 
ter all finding fome bogs remaining in places, which at fome 
former period had been caft up for peat and turf, ^id were 
below the Icvc! of the furrounding ground, I contrived to I 

drain them in this manner : I caft pits in the lowcft places * 

to the depth of 4^ 5, or 6 feet, till I came to fand, filled up | 

thefe [nts whh fmall ftones, and covered them with turf, the

*. Tliis laft mode of lrainiog is not precifely the fame with 
Mr. Elkinton*s bordng, but it is near a kin to it, and has 
proved as cffeftual, and has the ipcrit of not being borrowed 
from him, fincc it was practifcd before he was heard of in 
this country. ' 

On a fimtlar piece of groood, to the wcftward. of the fan» 
Ibodes, I have thi» year laid out a little Bleachfiald and erec- 
ted a boiling houfe where two of my daughters, carry on 
a Ettlc mani2fa£hire of linen threa4F • which, however, as 
welt a« the maiiufaflurcrs, is yet too much in infancy to 
afibrd ground for any opinion of its probable fuccefs. It 
has been contrived to bring the ftream of water coming 
from the wcftward through the middle of it ; and it is in* 
tended to bring the ipripg water from the foot of the hiUs 
into the boiling houfe. 

' I have new in a great meafure inclofed the face of the 
hill rlfing fotttl^ from Middletown, to the extent, as I guer% 
«f nearly an hundred acres, for planting trees, and have, I 
think, already planted upwards of 100,000, cpniifting off 
Scotch fir^ pines, lari^, oak, aUer^ birch, mountain aih, planes^ 
dms, &amp;c* many of which are thriving exceedingly well, 
thotrgh within lefs than a mile from the fea. Tht oaks I 
have chiefly raifed by cafting up fmall pits by a fpade, and 
patting in the acorn, i raife a good many plants in the nur* 
fery bed, but finding it expenfive either to ptu'chafe or ndfc; 
lb many plants as would be neceflary for fo large an extent 
of ground, I have contrived to fow the ground at once with 
the fir and birch fecd%j which I do in this m^tnaer.;'— I caufe

and aDother follow, dropping a feed or two into every fcratcfaf 
and then prefSng it down with kis foot as he goes along* 
This feems to anfwer very well, and will, I think, fave three 
fenrths of the aftial expence of planting. 

' In digging a channel for the ftream in the low grounds I 
found the remains of many trees, chiefly aller and oak, lying 
buried at the depth of 4 or 5 feet \ but there was not a fiiv 
gle tree or ihnib growing on the farm when I got poileffion. 
On the very to^ of the ^htgh hill lying betwixt Middlrtowo 
and Altens, there is pretty convincing evidence that it has 
been at feme former period overflowed by the fea \ as there 
ftill reinain feveral little mounts, compofed of rounded peb- 
bles, gravel and fand, in pretty regular ftrata,fuch as ftill ap* 
pbar on the beach below. 

' Having now nearly completed my improvements on Mid- 
^Detown, I am proceeding to finular operations on the fouth 
weft parts of Tullos, which are in my own natural pofleffion^ 
die reft being let to tenants on lea(es for 19 years. And 
here, I find, I have ftill a great deal to do in draining the 
sufffhy parts and dealing the moor of ftones« I have,' bow* 
ever, great encouragement to go on, as upon examining the 
Mrth face of the hill, which is at prefent covered with ftones 
and heath, I find the foil a very rich and pleafaat one, being 
HMftly a yellow loam, with a mixture here and there of day^ 
black muir foil and fand, very capable on the whole of culti* 
vttioB : and I expeA in $ or 6 years hence to have in cukiva* 
tioa in that quarter 56 or 60 acres, worth 2I. per atre, whidi 
at my entry did not yield fo many pence. 

' The only difadvantage, worth .mentioning, which I find 
in all thefe operations is the want of ready money adequate 
to the extent of my fields, and my ardour for agricultural im'i 
provements : and I believe the fame is the cafe with many 
others ki ^b countiy, though they iti not chooft to vwn it.

The grcatcfl. encounkgement therefore the board of agricul- 
ture and their refpefbable prefident could give us, would be 
to promote an agricultural bank in each countyi at which 
perfons improving wafte lands might be fupi^ed with money 
at a low rate of intereft, on the credit of their f;)rms, in pro- 
portion to the extent of their improvements ; for repayment 
of which the bank' might by law be declared to have a pre- 
ference ofi the ground^ immediately afte^ the landlord or fu- 
perion This J am confideot, would have an effed in£iiitely 
fuperior to any little premiums which can be given with lefs 
expence to government, and no riik. I hope it will fome 
day be ieen in this view by the honourable Board, and adop- 
ted accordingly. 

* The want of good roads in this parifh is no doubt a con- 
fiderable difadvantage ; but that is gradually difappearing. I 
myfelf have on my feveral farms made out about 4000 ells of 
road at my own expence \ and contributed befides confidera- 
bly to the making out about 5000 ells more. Theie arc not 
to be fure fo perfectly completed as to afford eafy communis 
cation with all quarters in winter : but that is owing to want 
of fufficient funds, and hearty co-operation of n^any who are 
materially interefted in them. My horfes, however, (eldom 
lie idle a flngle day of the year on account of the roads, or 
indeed on any other account. During greateft part of the 
ftorm of laft year, while the deepcft (how ever feen here was 
pn the ground, they were aftually employed in gravelling the 
roads, and it proved very comfortable work both for men 
and for horfes. — Thefe improvements have been greatly en- 
couraged by my liberal fuperibrs ; the town council of Aber- 
deen taking care, in feuing out the lands, to &amp;ee them from 
all thirlage and payment of t3ithes, and all ferwces, neceflary 
parochial ones excepted. Thefe advantages I of courfe com- 
mumcated to my tenants ; and fome of them, who have got

fcafcs for 19 years, arc improving their fields, trenching in 
and clearing barren comersi and building comfortable houfes 
for themfelves. 

' Although my general mode of inclofure is by ftone dykesy 
I have tried both ditches and hedges. My ditches I general- 
ly make double ones, divided only by a bank of 6 or 8 feet 
of folid ground, on which is thrown the earth taken from 
both ditches, and on the top I fow whms or plant elder. I 
have fown whin feed on the back of the half dykes, by which 
the planted gronnd is in part inclofed. Whins thrive there 
and every where well, and will be foon both ufeful and oma« 
mental. 

' I have iDclofed a kitchen garden at Middletown with 
hawthorn ; and I have plants raifed by myielf in readinefs 
for indofing fbme other pieces of ground. They appear to 
thrive well. 

* In the couHc of my operations in both farms I have trench- 
ed in with pick and fpade a great deal of ground which had 
never been plowed before. At the Altens, in particular, t 
trenched in about one fourth of an acre behind the houie for 
a kitchen garden, and found as many ftones in it, as inclofed 
the garden with walls above fix feet high. 

' On the fouth declivity of Torryhill was a piece of heath 
ground, fo fteep that it did not admit of being ploughed. I 
therefore left it out in inclofing the furrounding fields, and 
refolved to make a garden of it, which I have done, and I 
have now roles and gilly flowers, and many flowering fhrubs, 
ftrawberries, goofeberries, rafpberries, and mod kinds of gar- 
den fluff, with great variety of trees in nurfcry beds, growing 
where heath and whin only grew about three years ago. The 
hanging garden attra^ notice, and is an ornament to the 
fiuTounding fields.

that naiDe, founded by King William the Lyon in hononr * 
of St. Thomas CBecket, clofe by the town, which was one 
of the jtcheft in the kingdom. It was certainly the abbot's 
borough before the Reformation \ although the charter of 

cre&amp;ioil 



t^i General Appendix to [Vol. ?S* 

^rcffion from Eng James the Sixth, in I599 bears a nova 
ianoy and afGgns reafon that their old evidences of royalty 
Itad been abRra^led by the bifliop of Murray. Yet even bc- 
jbre the Reformation the burgefles had confiderable privi- 
leges ; being under the immediate juriiUi£tion of two baillies^ 
vhf rcof one was chofen by them(clves and the other named 
by the abbot : and there is an agreement between the abbot 
and them, an. 13949 about building a harbour, to the per* 
&amp;£Hng of which both were bound to contribute, but the ab- 
bot was to be at the greateft part of the charge, for which he 
was to have a certain yearly duty paid him out of every rood 
ef land lying within the borough. ' 

The town is compofed of one ftreet, running from north 
ta fbuth, nbout geometrical paces in length ; and another 
tbreet about 150 paces long, being parallel to the fbuth end 
wA the former, about 80 paces from it, and next to the wa^ 
tcr; with three or four bye lanes of wynds, and a fmall ftreet 
en the weft fide of the water. The whole lies on a flat almoft^ 
only a little rifing on the north part ; and the gardens inter- 
^erfed and adjoining to the town take up about three times 
more ground than what b' built upon. On the water there 
arc two bridges of ftonc, one near the north end of the town 
^d the other near the (ea. The town contains about 250 
lKufes, and 2,500 inhabitants. 

The town council cannot tnztzi 19 in ntrmbpr; of whom 
tBie provoft, two baillies and a dean^f-guild are magiftrate^^ 
the deacon-convener being ^x vfficio a counfellor and one of' 
the number. Their offices are of the fame nattue as in other 
royal boroughs in the kingdom. 

The baillies* court, and that of the dean-of-guild, are courts 
of record. The convener and deacons of crafts make bye 
laws for regulating matters relating to the incorporations, but 
have no concomitant jurifdlclion. Th^re are feven trades in- 

corporated^ 



No. 34-1 The Siatiftical Account^. 199 

corporated, viz. fmiths, ikinners,taylors, weavers, fliocmaker^ 
I Wrights, and bakers, each having their deacQp \ bat thefe 
I ieem to have had no other foundation for their privile^'t^s 
than the charter before mentioned, ere^ing the borough, and 
empowering the communitjr to incorporate the trades. The 
I weavers are as numerous as all the other trades put together; 
and the greateft noanufaAory is coarfe linen, which is com* 
monly ibid green, i. e. brown, and the greateft part fent to 
I London. Of late, tle nioft confiderable merdiants have fet 
I up a manufa£hire of white and theck linens, which they aie 
in good hopes to bring to perfection. Next to the weavet:^ 
the ihoemakers are moft numerous, and are much en- 
couraged by the tanning of leather, which is here done Co 
perfe&amp;ion ; and they ferve not only the town and adjacent 
country with boots and fhoes, but furniih quantities of fhocs 
to the merchants, *cvho fend them abroad. 

The town had very little foreign trade till the year 1725, 
. when they began to build a new harbour to the wefhrard of 
tlie old, in which there was no fafety for any veiTels in winter 
ftofms. The work has been carrying on ever fince at a vafl: 
expence for fo fmall a town : and although it is not acceflible 
for large Aiips, yet there are now belonging to the town 
about a dozen from about 1 20 to 50 tons burden, employed 
in trading to the northern colonies in America, the Bahic« 
France, Holland and Norway •, beiidcs veflels jemployed in 
the coal trade and coafting. The flate tjuarrics, which lip 
within 4 miles of the town, afford outward carriage to the coat 
barges^ who'iind a greater confumption for coals (as they arc 
free of duty) than they are aMe to anfwer, fo tlwt great part • 
of that article is bought here by ftrangers. 

Tliere arc no remaricable public .building or antiquities, 
except the ruins of the abbey or monaftery \ and thcfe de-

There b in this parifh an old caftle called the Gaflle of 
Dofibs, concenaing which} both tradition and hiftoiy fay. lit- 
tie. It (eems to have been built for a place of defence \ the 
waDs in fbme places are 6 or 7 feet thick, iituate on a dfiog 
groai|d, furrounded with a ditch 30 feet broad, with a draw- 
bridgci the only place of accefs to it* Within the ditch or 
fofle, there is a fine orchard and garden, ftocked with the 
befi kind of fri^t trees. The foundations of a number of 
boufes are jet to be feen. 

A ftory prevails among the country people that it was built 
by the Danes in the time of King David I. ( othersj that 9 
family of the name of Cheyne came from France, got a grant 
of the ground from King David, and built the caftle in this 
defenfive ftate, becaufe they had been guilty of fome crime in 
France that ezpofed them to profecution. The caftle gave ti* 
tie to Lord Dufflis, who about 60 years ago poQeQed thefg 
lands with many others in this country* 

Brougbeaii t Burgus^Therc is in the weft end of the pa- 
liih a place called Broughead, a village containing 400 people 
who live chiefly by fifhing. 

Here there is a fmall j^romontory jutting into Ae Firth^ 
nfing above low water about 2p yards on the weft and north 
fides, fenced by perpendicular rocks on the caft ; the afcent 
15 vciy fteep, and now covered with grafs nourifhed by the 
mbbifh of the houfes that have fallen to that fide. On the 
footh, the afcent is more cafy, and was defended by three fe« 
parate foflea, through which the fea was allowed to pa^, 
arched over with draw bridges. The area ojn the tap formed 
a xefkangnlar figure; in length 15a yards, in breadth 50. This

when digged into, and appear to have been' defiroyed bf 
£re. On the weft there was a place of worfhip, the remains 
of which ftill appear} alfb a burying ground, which the peo- 
ple of Bro6ghead ufe to this day. Hie whole feems alfo t« 
have been iurronnded on the to^ of the rocks with a ymj 
thick ftone walL From all that I can learn, this fort was 
built by the Danes, as a place of fafety for their arms and 
other efie£b in times of danger, alfo a place of reiidence; to 
fome of their families. When, or by whom it was burnt I 
cannot learn. A fabulous fiory prevails among the country 
people, that a daugber of the King of Scotland was married 
to a Danifh prince who ufed her ill, ilpon which the Scots 
King threatened revenge for the affiont; and therefore, 
immediately after, the Danes came over, brought a num- 
ber of pigeons and other birds, befineared their feathen 
with tar and oil, fet them on fire, and let them loofe 
to fly through the difierent piarts of the garrifon ; and hom 
foon the Danes faw the flames, they fled with what valvabler 
they could tranfport with them. 

Some fay this was a Roman fort ; but from their progrefi 
northward, it is hardly credible they would have built fucb a 
place of defence. 

The bay to the weft of thefe rocks forms the fafoft and 
moft extenflve roadftead for Ihips in aU the North Seas^ 
and the fliipmaftcrs fay there is not a phce north of Leith 
that is fo well calculated for a fea port. Ships of any bur* 
den could come in and lie in fafety in the moft violent fbnn, 
being defended on the north and eaft by the rocks i and the 
bottom of the bay confifts of day and mols i and if a few 
hundred pounds were well laid ou£, it would be the bef}; har- 
bour m Scotland ; and, in the prefent fituation of this coon*

which confifts of 300 acres araUe and grafs lands, befides a

taken together confift of 200 acres, that are indoied. 

The yearly rent paysible out of the land^ is about 1000

visual here. Were the growth of this county ufcd only for 
bread, there would be a fufilciency of vidhial in the county, 
at an ainerage, to ierve its inhabitants. 

There are a great many potatoes raifed in this parifh ; not

count of the goodnefs of the foH only, btit likewife on account 
of its pecuUariy favourable fituation. Befides a foUth expo- 
fure, it is fhdtefed on the north by a hill extending from one 
end to the other, being 2 miles in length. There is a beau- 
tiful bank extending from one ^d to the Other, moft of it 
covered with trees of Various kinds; upon the middle of 
which the houfe of Dunrobin ftaftds. it Hes at the difhnce of

ber in proportion to its bounds. No beaft need be houfed 
these for good livings and very few are houfed, except 
the labouring cattie« A continnance of the preient ma« 
nagement of it will certainly bring it in a little time to a ftate 
of very high improvement, and render it very profitiile to

they cannot be faid to be free of all vice ; yet there is not 
an inftaace of any one in this parifh having committed a 
crime to incur capital punifhment, or trani]pDrtation, for

fuppoied that a little time will enlighten them in that ufeful 
and beneficial art.

The fox has (till a footing in this, and in every other paif 
of the qpunty, much to the detriment of the game. The 
fox kills the young of the deer wherever it finds them^ and 
deftroys the young moor-fowl *, nor do the fheep efirape altor 
gether his murdering plots. But, much to the honour of

When the fox-hunter kills a fox, he is obliged to come imi-

an atteftation, in terms of his own declan^ipn, of the pariih

After tub ceremony b oyer, the huntfman cuts off the eaas 
of the fox, in fight of the.infpeAor, and carries them away 
carefully, to be kept in retefftis till the 30th of April, on 
which day ^e premium is to be paid. On the 30th of April,

As it is di$cult to kill the eagle by ihooting, feveral of them

lure hpule, at leaft the wall part of it, is built on ground 
frequented by the eagle and an opening, left at the foot of 
the wall ftifKcient for the egrefs of the bird. To the outfide 
of this opening a bit of ftrong. flcainy is fixed, with a nooie 
formed on one end, and the (Sther end running through the 
^oofe* After all this opetatioa is finifhed, a piece of carrion 
is thrown into the houfe, yrhich the eagle finds out, and 
perches upon. It eats vordcioufly ; and when it is &amp;Uy (ar- 
tiated, it never thinks of taking its flight immediately up^ 
wards, unlefs difturbed, provided it can find an eafier way to

Allaihett-fi(h of erery kind, except oyfters ; of which, too, if 
(as (ome fay) they would multiply by planting them in fmooth 
bays of the fea, and a firm fandy bottom, there might be plen^ 
ty in this place. There are fmall trout in the bum of Gol-

{ormerly ; at no lefs than one penny per haddock, of a tolera* 
faiy good fize* About 10 or 12 years ago, 20 haddocks could 
he bought for one penny, only they were in general of a Iefl%r 
fize than the prefent ones. If our filhers were fuch ac deferved

for there is ftiU good fifhing ground towards the Caithneft

Perhaps there are not fo many poor in any pariih in Sco&amp;

Yet, though the crop on the coaft fell Ihort of the niixal

habitants, but afforded relief alfo to the" Highlanders. On 
the whole, the crop of the country fupported the people over 
all, befides a referve of feed for the whole country, till the 
beginning of April 178J. At that period, the Countefs of 
Sutherland fent a fupply of foreign vidbial; and her Ladylhip 
continued fending a fupply from time to time of barley, peafe, 
and rye, to the ahiount in all of 6000 bdlls, until the new

There was great lofi of catde in fpring 178a by the (everi-*

ing their farms; and though feveral were brought to the 
verge of baalcruptcfy yet^ by lenity and indiHgence on the 
p^ of the proprietors^ they in a few years rec6v^ed their 
jprcumftances. 

AprU 2x4, 9793.— -At this period, a regiment of Fencibk 
^men is newly raiied in this country. In confequence of Earl 
Gower's having undertaken to raife a fendhle regiment in 
this country, Ciplonel Wemyfs of Wemyft the Colonel-Com- 
mandant, and the Honourable Colonel Stewart the Lieutenant- 
Colonel of the regiment, began to recruit on the 23d of March, 
and in the courfe of 8 days recruiting they completed their 
nombcx with a conilderable overplus. 

Wherever they displayed their colours, the people flocked 
to them in multitudes from every comer, teftifying their loy- 
alty to their king, their zeal for the conftitution, and their 
attachment to their fuperiors Lord Gower a|2d Lady Suther«- 
land. Colonel Wemyis commanded the fencible regiment of 
this country in the years 1779, 1780, 1781 and 1782, and 
the people's attachment to the Colonel had its ihare too, in 
their alacrity to engage in the fervice. 

In the courfe of the few days recruiting, many more good 
men might have been had ; but as the commiflion was too li- 
mited for this country, only the pick of the men were taken, 
19 Ac mortificatipn of many that arc left. 

In 



In lA than 3 vecks sfter tlie anxxmencemiht of the re«* 
cruiting^ this regiment was ordered hj the Commander-in-«^ 
Chief to go upon }iazardous fervicc  and that vtry 'day fimr 
weeks from the cooiinencepdeiit of the reoiaidtig, ievehil 
companies of them fet off to InTcmefs^ to quell 0NninGfrion«» 
that had arifen in that town^ about com dipping in thchar^ 
hour there  the mob to th^ amount of 3000, ^Hedging that 
it was intended fqr ^ fupply to France. They took muth 
of the corn out of the Te^H% stnd fold it as they pleafed. 
Threatening^ of an alarming nature had been^ittered by tho 
mob after thatj which made the interference pf piilitary forca 
neceflary. 

It is perhaps an unheard of thing, a regiment being raiicd 
^ f^at upon fervicc^ within the fpace of 4ireeks.

tempt his neighbour to outbid hiip at next fet, not far dis- 
tant. — As a farther inducement to agricultural improvements^ 
perhaps it might have a good efieft if the landholders fhould^ 
after the laudable example of the Highland Society upon a 
larger fcale, each upon his own eftate, diftribute among hi9 
tenants fome little premiums for improving a fpot of ground 
here and there. Fumifhing them with tools and inftnunents 
of hufbandry might aUb be to ibme purpofe.«^As to fifheries ; 
I have long been pf opinion, that a village coniifting merely 
of profelHonal fifliers could never exifl. in the Highlands. 
•Their fuccefs in &amp;fhing is perfe^y precarious, and, even if 
it were otherwife, they are at a diftance from markets. But 
if the foil Ivere cultivated, fo as to fumifh the neceflaries of 
life upon eafy terms, and manufa^res iet up in proper fi* 
tuations ; inhabitants of various defcriptions would flofk in 
from all quarters, and would in sdl probability in the couHe 
of a few years form populous and flouriihing vSIages. In 
fiich a ft^e of things, there would not be wanting abundance 
of perfons to profecute the fiihing, with the utmoft vigour, 
of their own accord.—- In the meantime, I muft obferve, that 
an alteration on the fait laws is much required. They feem 
to be rather ftriA and intricate for the prefent ftote of the 
Highlands.— *The extenfion of ufefiil knowledge, atfe, would 
have a happy tendency to roufe the Highlander to attend to 
the means of improving his country. For this purpole, 
fchools and miffions ought K be eftablifhed in as many fitua- 
tiohs as poffible. From want of thefe means of inftni^ooj 
the prefent ftatte of the Highhmds is troely deplorable ; and 
it is rather unfortunate that the Society far propagating

ftand as a bar to the benefits ^f the inftitution. Schoob of

If the PoUew road was n?ade the foundation of a packet

AdJUtional Commuuicationt, from the Rev. George Brovm*</head> 

<p>There is a ftrange inaccuracy concerning the poors' funds 
In the printed report of thefe pariihes. The written report 
fiatedi that,' befides 169L fterling, fettled in a gentleman's 
hands for the behoof of the popr, a Mrs Elizabeth Farquhar- 
fon of Jamaicai a native of the parifh^ left at her death 400I. 
fterling to thefe parifhes; aool. were to be fettled for the 
poor, the intcreft of which they were to draw yearly : and 
the other aool. were to be fettled likewife, and the in« 
tereft of them to be given as a falary to a fcboolmafter yearly^ 
to teach the poor children in thefe parifhes, for ever. But 
the trufVees, appointed by Mrs Farquharfon to manage this 
part of her will, took no concern with it for upwards of 20 
years after her death. At lafl, however, one of them, by 
means of his fon, then in the ifland, recovered the original 
400I. with 200I. of interefV ; which niade 300L to the pocwr, 
and 300I- to the fchool. When the report was fent up, 
none of the money was applied to the purpofes for which it

<p>Additional Informationm 

In the Stati(lical Account of the pariih of Cambufnethany 
glrcn in Vol. 12th, Na 38, in a note fubjoined to page 5729 
mention is made that there were feveral perfons in the parifh 
whofc age exceeded 90 years. As thefe perfons are now 
dead» it may not be improper to fpecify their names and 
ages, as inftances of longevity. 

The perfons therein alluded to were two very refpeftable 
ladies, Mrs Margaret and Mrs Anne Hamiltons, both daugh- 
ters of the deccafed James Hamilton, Efq. of Dalzel^ who 
then lived at the houfc of Muirhoufe in that pariih. Mrs 
Margaret Hamilton was born on tlie 2 2d day of February 
1700, (O. S.) and died on the 7th of April 1797, aged 98 
years ; and Mrs Anne Hamilton was born on the i6th day 
of January 1703, (O. S.) and died on the 15th day of April 
1796, aged 94 years. 

It is proper here to add, that their youngeft brother- 
german, James Hamilton, Efq. of Browncaftle, (who was 
alfo proprietor of the lands and lioufe of Muirhoufe above- 
mentioned,) died in June 1788^ aged 91. Such inftances 
of longevity in one family, and in one generation, feldom 
occur ; and it is particularly remarkable, that Mrs Margaret 

Hamilton,

Hamilton, who lived to the greateft age, retained her men- 
tal faculties to the laft* It may be further added, as to other 
inftances of longevity in that family, and in the fame gene« 
ration, that Mr Archifiald Hamilton, eldeft fon of the faid 
James Hamilton, £fq. of Dalzel, and vho fucceeded him in 
that eftate in the year 1727, died in the end of December 
1774, aged 81 years; and that Mrs Jean Hamilton, another 
daughter of the faid James Hamilton, £fq. of Dalzel, who 
tras married to James Roberton, Efq, of Bedlay, died in 
April 1784, aged 83 years. So that there were 5 perfons of 
GDC generation in a family, and all defcendcd from the fame 
parents, whofc ages joined together make up 447 years;

The fine appearance of this bridge attraAs the attention of 
travellers, as they enter or leave the north end of the town. 
-'-As a youth of fingular talents, I capnot omit mentioning 
Lieutenant Charles Pafley, of the Royal Artillery, (a relation 
to the brave Admiral of the fame name.) At the age of la, 
he was as great a proficient in Latin, Greek and French) as 
l}is mafter, eminent in his profeffion, could make him. He 
acquired mathematics almofl: intuitively. No taik in algebra 
. was difficult to him* Drawing without the aid of a mafleri 
printing with a pen in a neat and beautiful manner, and wri^* 
ting verfes, in which he difcovered c^uch fancy and humbur| 
were the (ubje£b of his amufement. His * Wars of Lang? 
holm/ a Latin compofition^ are not only replete with ge? 
^uine humour, but alfo dalEcally corredL His tafte for hi(' 
tory and voyages was infatiable ; but he could not endure nor 
-vels, or any of that light reading, of which young people ar( 
generally fo fond. To the great acutenefs of his underftajul* 
ing, he added alio a mofl retentive memory. His years con- 
fidered, (going 17,) he certauiiy pofleiies extraordinary and 
almoft univerfal abilities. About two years ago, he was ap« 
|K)inted a cadet of the Royal Academy at Woolwich ; and 
about two months ago, piFomoted as abovc^-^It would exr 
ceed the bounds allotted to a report of this kind to mentioB 
many other young men who haye gone from this parifh to 
India, and other places abroad, and are promLQng to do muck 
credit to their nataUJolymy in the army and navy ; and in the '^ 
medical and mercantile profeifions. No parifh, perhaps, ia 
. Scotland, of its extent, can produce fuch a number. 

I mean no difrefpeA to the above refpeAable lift, by addf

<p>One thing has been omitted, of which it had, perhaps 
teen proper to have taken fome notice. I mean .the pra£lice 
of carrying cripple beggars through the country on a haad- 
barrow or wooden frame, for the purpofe of collecting alin5« 
The times chofen for their circumportation, are generdly 
thofe of lowing and reaping^ when it is difikult to find 
hands to carry them from place to place, without interrupt'^ 
itag the work of the feafon. Were it not better, that the pa- 
cifhes to which thefe cripples belong fhould be obliged to 
tnaintain them at home? If they cannot afibrd them fuffi* 
dent maintenance, neighbpuring parifhes ought to alEfi them. 

I was in fome fufpence about my poUtical conclufion, whe*^ 
ther I fhould fend or retain it. As I fometimes met with 
grumblers, and frequently heard complaints, fudx as thofe 
mentioned ; as I now and then perceived a tendency to de- 
aiocratical principles, I thought my obfervations might be 
coniidered as charaAeriftical of Ibme dailes of people in ouar 
times: I thought that fome general refle^ons would be more 
sfefiil than a lox^ dofely profecuted argument ; «nd as the

ancient (landing, was a local on^ like many others of this 
xountry. Of this name there have been, and Aill are, oiaivy 
refpcftable and worthy people. . - 

The barony of Prefton was extenfive ; and it was for ma- 
ny ages the property of a cadet of the ifluftrious fomily rf 
Hamilton. The ancient Cower, called Prefton Tower, now 
in ruins, was the m^uage of the family* It was burnt. by aQ- 
cidcnt in 1663. Prefton Houfe, an elegant pile, ivas ercclcd

as 1704, to Br. Ofwald, fon to a provoft of Edinburgh, 
sdong with the barony of Prefton. 

It is probable the whole of that barony was church or ab- 
bey lands, and fell .tnder grants made, on the Reformation^ 
to the anceftors of the noble family of Ker, as lords of erec- 
tion. But the old writings of the barony and others perifhed 
by the fire which confumed the tower in 1663. 

To the Hamiltons oi[ Prefton, Sir Thomas Nicolfon, king's 
aKlvocate, the celebrated Biibop Burnet, and Sir Thomas 
Craig, the great feudal. lawyer, were nearly related, as ap« 
pears from the wei)rknown and valuable works of Craig and 
Burnet. 

Sir Thomas JNicoUbn Idt no fbns, but federal daoghters, 
* who -married into the beft families. The Marquis of Lo« 
thian, the Earl of Kinnoul, Scot of Maleny, Carfe of Cock« 
pen, Hamilton of Prefton and Oliveftob, Mr Erfldnc of 
Mar, &amp;c. are defcended of Sir Thomas Nicolfon. 

The eftate of Preftongrange, part of the barony of PraflDn, 
was acquired early in the i 7th century by Mr George Mori* 
fon, whdfe father had the lands of Troup in BanffBure, and 
of Pitfour in Aberdeenihire, as his defccodants have had the 
eftate of Boguie in Banfflhire, which anciently was called 
Frendraught, and belonged to Chancellor Crichtoa as f«tr 
back as James II/s reign. 

One of Freftongrange's daughters, Katherine, was married 
to Lord Strathnaver, and (be was mother of Lady Janet Sin« 
clair ;«»**grandmother of the^laft Earl of Sutherland, and of 
Sir John Sinclair; another, Jean, was Vifcountefs of Ar- 
bothnot ; - and a third, Helen, was Countds of Giafgow^ and 
. grandmother of the prefent Earl of Glafgo w.

The cftate of Preftongrange was pnrchafed in 17464 at a 
judicial fale, by Mr William Graat^ then his Majefiy's Ad- 
vocate, and afterwards one of the Lords of Seilion and JufH- 
ciary, who(e eminent talents and humanity will long be grate- 
fully remembered. 

The barony of Prefton was fold by Sir William Hamilton 
to James Ofwald of Fingleton about the end of laft century ; 
and Lord Grange purchafed it at the beginning of the preferji 
century. In 1 752, it was fold by Lord Grange partly to Wat- 
fon's Hofpital, and to his fa^or William Ramfay ; and in 1 770 
he fold it to Dr. Ramfay» who had been tutor, firft to David 
Lord £lcho, and afterwards fador to his Grace the Duke of 
Roxburgh ; and Mr Shaw purchafed the fame foon after^ 
as ftated in the volume and page above referred to, of the 
Statifiicai Account of this panfh. 

TJic cftatc of Northfield, anciently'part of the barony of 
Prefton, was pujrchafed by Mr A. Nifbct, furgeon in Edin- 
burgh, about 1722 \ and was lately fold to James Sime, flater 
in Edinburgh, the prefent worthy proprietor. 

Hie late lord Dnimmbre purchafed his farm in this parifli . 
fome years after \ upon which he built a very good houfe* 
and planted and embellifhed the grounds very elegantly. 
Upon his Lordfeip's death, the Rev. Dr. Finlay bought thk 
prc^rty, which is an ornament to this part of the countiy. 

The eftate of Oliveftob (formerly Holyftop, now called Bank- 
ton) was long the property of another rcfpe£bble branch of 
the great family of Hamilton. Several of the family of Olive-* 
ftob made a figure both at home and abroad. CoImel Tho- 
mas Hamilton, when a younger brother, ferved in (he Swc- 
dUh army. On his return to Scotland, about 1670, be 
became an eminent merchant, and was afterwards one of 
the magiftrates of Edinburgh : and Lord Kames, in his Law 
Trads, and Lord Fount^inball, in hisDaifions, mention him

This gentleman was, by the States of Scotland, in the Con- 
*rcntion i6W, appointed Lteutenant-^^olonel of the Edin- 
burgh Regiment, raifed at the Revolution 1688, as appears 
£rom the 3d volume of the Scots Afts, page 139, and the 
records of the town-council of Edinburgh. 

He afterwards purchased Oliveftob from hfs eldeft brother, 
'Willram Hanailton, who left no ifftie. His eldeft fon, James, 
went early into the army j and was wounded at the fiege of 
Namur, carried on fuccefefiilly by Bang William: in perfon, 
anno 1695. Mr James Hamilton, after the peace in 1697, 
ftudied the civil law, 8cc. at Leyden; and was admitted 
advocate in 1703 ; and was flieriff of Haddington, by com- 
miffion from Queen Anne, till 17 15. He was brother-in- 
law to Lord Grange, He fold his eftate of Oliveftob to Col. 
Gardiner^ who was killed very near the manonr houie by 
the rebels, 21ft Sept. 1745. It was afterwards purchafed by 
Mr Andrew M'Doual, advocate, who about ten years after 
was promoted to the bench, moft defervedly, and, out of de- 
licacy to his old friend Mr Hamilton, took the title of I/)rd 
Bankton, inftcad of Oliveftob. Mr Hamilton died in an ad» 
vanced ^ge in 1757. His fon, Major Thomas Hamilton of 
Oliveftob, was wrecked, with the late Lord Byron and Cap- 
.tain Cfaeape, in the courfe of Lord. Anfon*s celebrated vopge 
in 1742. They returned to London together in 1745, after 
ftfSering incredible hardfhips, and had been given up by their 
relations for loft. The fifter of Colonel Thomas Hamilton 
was mother to the celebrated William Hamilton of Bangour, 
whofe poetic tafte and virtues are known everywhere; She 
was alfo the laft wife and widow of tfie eminent Sir Hew Da}-

Additicm and CorreBions^ from the Rev, Adam Foreman,</head>  

<p>I flioiild not haVe tronbled Sir John Sinclair again fo ^ear- 
ly, had ft6t feve^al tircuihffetnces occurred, which, for the 
i6ke of Accuracy, may be offomcTittk t^nfcquetoCe itothc 
publication of the account of this pariih. 

r. The report or account in 17^5, mnft have beto cOnfr 
dtrablyhighcr, than in the cof(y which you have of l)r Web*- 
fter's account,' In your letter, it makes the nUttiber of fouls 
in this p^ffi'to^be 471. But from my knowledge ti the lo- 
cal fituation of the dwellings, &amp;c. confirmed by niady whom 
I have confultedj die numbers muft have been confidcU^Iy 
greater. 2. Froni feveral ftatements in the pari(h regifter, 
the numbers appear to have then been 540, and in fome yean 
upwards. 3. The 471 muft either have been the examinable 
perfons in the pariih, or elie the -number of fbub in what is 
called properly the pariih, exclu£ve of the number of fouls in- 
the two annexations quoad facrai viz. the barony of Driffi 
belonging to Cathcart, quoad iemporalia ;- and the lands of 
Bufby, belonging to Eilbryde, which pay the tetnporalia to 
the college of Glafgow. 4. But having a few days ago got 
a pretty accurate copy of Dr Webfter's account from my 
friend Dr Porteous, I find the amount of this parifhto be, in. 

the 



Ko. 6.] fbe Siatifiical AccotM. 261 

iJic year 175^5, 5^6; which comes near to the account in the 
regifter, and feems to agree with the conclulions that may be 
drawn from marriages, baptifins, &amp;c. The increafe therefore 
will amount only to 44 fouls. I could Jiave wifhed for the 
lake of refohing the queftion refpefting the population in 
the kingdom, that your copy in this particular had been the 
more accurate one, but for many reafons, unnecefiary at pr^- 
ient to mtotion^ we muft keep by the 5 z6 as the real ftate* 
iaent.' 

2. Hawig endeavoured to gain the exaft meafurement of 
t!he pariih, our account will be more accurate by dating the 
extent thus: From eaft to weft, about 4 miles in lengthy 
from north to ibuth, about 2*** miles in breadth. It is in ma* 
ny places 3 miles in breadth, but in general is according to 
the above ftatement. If however we include the annexations^ 
its extent^ from eaft to weft, will be ^\ miles in length, and 
about 4 miles in breadth from northeaft to fouthweft ; thi§ 
being the direAion in which we can attain to accuracy, if we 
include the annexations. 

Sir Harry Kfoncrieflr wid eaiily reAify tlie ftatement ibr- 
aerly given in, by attending to the above circumftance. 

3. But the principal circumftance why I have confidered k 
^per to write Sir John Sinclair at this time, is tl/oB respec- 
ting the account of Mr Ewing M^Lae's improvements. In 
my actount. Sir John Sinclair will obferve, (as far as I re- 
colled,} that I mention that Mr Swing M^Lae will gain his 
{tarpole, viz. ' of letting* his lands ot ''30s. and '40s. per acre.' 
I know that yon. Sir, are always much pleafed with folid im« 
provement in every branch of agriculture } and as I wi(h, if 
poffible, to infpirit the people here to imitate Mr Swing's 
Isudabte exertions, I coniidered it proper to ftate the follow- 
ing circumftance, which has taken place fixyre I gave in my 
account. Mr Ewing has let a £arm for 19 years^ to the for- 
mer 



26z Ceneral Appendix to [Vol.xvin; 

mer tenant, conHftingof about 114 acresj at 30s. for each 
^crc. Obfcnrc, this is not the ground which Mr Ewing has 
been highly improving with Glafgow manure from the fham- 
Wes ; but the very lands which the fame tenant formerly pof- 
ibiled at about I28. the acre, lefs than half the prefent value. 
Mr Ewing is to inclofe with double hedges, which circum^ 
fiance Sir John Sinclair will underftand, as this mode is fol- 
lowed in many parts of the country where improvements 
have taken place. 

He aUb intends, in confpicuous fituations, and which in a 
high country muft have a very fine effeft from the adjacent 
grounds which lie low, to infert clumps of firs, &amp;c j and he 
means, befides what he has already done, to inclofe the 
whole of his lower grounds, aind the grounds expofed to Xht 
fiorm, with broad belts of plantmg, &amp;c. 

I have mentioned the above circumftances that Sir John 
Sinclair may make any ufe of them in the publication of the 
account, which he fliaU think neceflary. 

I forgot, in the beginning of my letter, to mention a fmall 
overfight. The origin of the name of this parifh, Carmun- 
nock, or Carmannock, fignifies * the camp town founded up^' 
on the hill of heath.* 

Though Sir John Sinclair is now pleafed to order the pub- 
lication of this parifh, I fhall confider it however my dut]/, 
on all occafions, to give him f he ftate of improvement, if any 
fuch fhall take places and if I fhall think my obfcrvations 
worthy of his notice. I know Sir John Sincfeir will kindly 
fcceive this fmall tribute of real rcfpefit.

Additional Information, by the Rev^ J, Cam/SiBL</head> 



<p>The following anecdotes arc not onljr curious in themfelvcs, 
but throw light on the ftate of fociety of Scotland at the 
time to which they refer. They are tranfcribed from tlie 
IBffzy on the Family and Surname of BuchanaOj by William 
Buchanan of Auckmar, p. 57— -p5o. 

In the reign of King James IV. and for divers ages be* 
fore, the Meinzieses were proprietors of a great part of the 
parifh of Kippen, and fome of the pari£h of Killeam, though 
fcarcc any memory of that name remains in cither of tliefe 
parifhes in this age. A gentleman of that name being lalri 
of Ampryor^ at the above mentioned jiiaAure who had no 
children of his own, nor any of his name in tliefe parts that 
could pretend any relation to him) was for fome time at va- 
riance with one Forreftcr of Garden, a very topping gentle- 
man of Ampvyors neighbourhood, who, upon account of bis 
neighbour Arnpcyor'$ circumftances, fent a menacing kind 
of mefiage to him, either to difpone his eftate in his favour 
voluntarily, othcrwife he would difpoileis hin^ of it by force. 
Ampryor not being of power to oppofe Garden, and being 
loath to give his eitate. by con^pulfion to his enemy, judged 
it the more proper, as well a^ honourable method, to difpone 
his eftate to fome other gentleman who would counter- 
- balance Garden, and would maintain the -rightful owner ii^ 
poflfeffion thereof during his life. In this exigency he had 
pecoorfe to the laird of Buchanan, offering to difpone his ef- 
tate to one of Buchanan's fons, if he woHld defend him froiu 

anv 



^s&amp;f-. Cenercd jfypendix to {[VahxTuu 

any riolcncc offered by Garden. Buchanan readily accepted 
of the offer; and fo far undervalued Garden that he ient his 
iecond fon, then only ^ child^ without any other ^uard thaa 
his dry nurfe, to overfee him, along with Ampryor, to be 
kept by him as his heir. Upon notice hereof, Garden came 
to Ampryor'^ houfe with a refolution to kill him, or oUige 
Iiim to fend back Buchanan's (on, and grant his former de- 
mands. Ampryor having gone out of the way. Garden very 
Imperioufly ordered the woman, who attended Buchanan's 
.child, to carry him back forthwith whence he came, other- 
wile he would burn Ampryor's houfe and them together* 
The woman replied, that Ihe would not defert the houfe for 
^ny thing he durft do \ telling him withal, jf he offered the 
Jeaft violence, it would be cevenged to his coiL This flout 
reply was ibmewh^ damping to Garden^ who at the £m3e 
time reflecting, that he wcuild not only he obnoxious to the 
laws for any violent meaiures he iliould take, bat alfo to en?

conditioA of the right witig, and he haftened thither to its 
relief with all the men he could coUe£L McDonald, (a man 
of the greateft perfonal intrepidity, but endowed rather vfith 
' the qualifications of a mere foldier than of a general) bold even 
to ra(hne6) movecf with indignant fcom at the infiilts of the

bufhes, withdrew from the ftrong ground^ where he was fi 
curefrom all danger, to face the enemy on the open field* 
H^ had nigh fallen a facrifice to his tafhnefs. The Co^e^ 
nanters, fuperior to him both by their horfe and number, 
and many of them experienced foidiers« foon threw his 
troo^ into diforder, and repulfed them in great confufion ; 
and had he not quickly retired with them into a neighbour- 
ing inclofure, they had all been cut to pieces, and the royal 
flandard fallen into the power of the enemy. This rafh 
miAake, McDonald abundantly redeemed, by the finguhr 
courage he difplayed in bringing off his men. He himielf 
was the laft man who quitted the field, and alone covered I 
the retreat of his men ; defending his body with a large tar- | 
get, and oppofing himfelf to the thickeft of the enemy : fome \ 
foldiers came ib near him, as to fix their fpears in his target, 
which he is faid fucceflively- to have cut to pieces by a fingle 
firoke of his fword. 

When the detachment with whom McDonald was engaged, 
in the inclofure, faw Montrofe ccnning to his affiftance, and 
perceived that their own men on the left were fled, the horfe 
ran with precipitation) but the foot, principally firefh fol- 
diers, fought with the utmoft defperation, and fell almoft

but inglorious flight. Of the Covenanters, the moft eminent 
perfons flain, were, Campbell of Lawers and Sir John and Sir 
Gideon Murrays* Montrofe loft, cxn the left wing, only one 
private ibldier) and on the other^ where McDonald command- 
ed, 14 {bldiers ; but there were many more wounded. Mr 
Shaw, (Hiftory of Moray), mentions MThcrfon of Inverefchic 
among the flain on the ilde of the Royalifts. This battle of 
Auldearn was fought May 4th, 1645.— -Spalding's remarks

' would appear ; fo inany to be cut down on the one fide, 
^ and fo few on the other : jet no thanks was given to God 
' fcr this great viftory.* 

After this victory, Montrofe gave direAions to bura the 
lands and houfes of Campbell of Calder in Nairn, and plun-

Situation.'^Thcdi united pariihes are lituated about the 
centre of the Mainland, or principal ifland of Shetland. The 
names, like all others in this country, are evidently of Nor- 
wegian origin, though no fatisfaAory account can be g^ven 
of their etymology. Taimg, in the language of that country, 
fignifies ' a point of land ftretching out into the water ;* and 
UngwaU or Taingwall, is faid to deriveits name from a fmall 
ifland, in a water called the Loch of Tingwall, and joined to 
the neareft fhore by the remains of a ftone wall. In this i- 
fland, the courts of law are faid to have been antiently held, 
and to this day it is called the Law-Taing. About two mile^ 
weft finom Tingwall, and feparated firom it by a ridge of 
mountains, extending from north to fouth about 6 miles, II06 
Whltenefs ; and about two miles N.W. firom "Whiteneis, lies 
Weifdale. The inhabitants of Weifdale had fbrmtrly their 
own pariih kirk i but in the year 1722 the kirk of Weifdale 
was fupprefled, the fituation of the kirk of Whiteneis aker- 
ed, and a kirk built at Suretown in Whitenefs, to be in all

Mainland of Shetland, they are fo ftrangely interfe£kd by arms 
and inlets of the fea^ that in no part of them can a foot be

The only village in thefe parifhes is Scalloway. It was for-

Some families of diftinAion lived in it« It was the refidence 
^ the (heriff*depute, the feat of juftice, and confequently the 
refort of ftnuigers from the different parts of the country. 
Of late it has fallen much into decay. At prefent there are 
but 31 inhabited houfes in it; and the only gentleman of 
property, now fefiding in it, is Mr Scott of Scalloway, who is 
almoft its fole proprietor. To the weftward of Scalloway 
there are four inhabited iilands, and feveral fmall grazing

Sent and Produce.-^The arable hnd in thefe pxriihes is ge- 
nerally a rich brown earth, on a dry limeflone bottom ; pro- 
ducing in good feafons more bear and grey oats than the ixw 
habitants can confume. From them, the towns of Lerwick 
and Scalloway deceive confiderable fupplies of OMal, and al- 
moft all the malt they ufe. They alfo fell very great quanti-' 
tics of potatoes to the inhabitants of Lerwick^ and the ftran- 
gers who occafionally put into the harbour of Lerwick. This 
valuable article, they preferve from the winter froik, in pits 
dug in their bam yards about 3 feet deep. After the pota^ 
toes are put into thefe pits, they arc firft covered with earth, 
and then with a ftack of com. For thefe two kft years, black 
and red oats have been tried, and promife to do weH.

The outfield ground is commonly laboured for oats tw0 
jtxp^j and then laid ley one year* No manure is beftov/ed 
on it. This may be coniidered as ihameful in pariO^es where

The manure made for their infield ground is rich and ftrong. 

Inftcad of carrying the dung daily from the byres, it \% 
allowed to remain there as long as there is room for it, and 
Is every day mixed and covered with black mould brooght 
from the hilJs. After the byres are full, and the cattte 
raifcd to the very roof, the whole mixtmre is carried to the 
dunghill ; and then the operation within begins and goes os

There are 78 plotfghs in thefc parifhes, each drawn by 
4 oxen going abreaft, with heavy wooden- yokes acrofs thdir 
necks. The Shetland plough is fingle ftiltcd ; and is faid tw 
be the fame nfed in the cultivated parts of Norway. The 
implements of hufbandry are generally bad. The harrows 
are light, and moftly timber teethed. For this rcafon, the 
plough IS always followed by 3 or 4 people, with fpades in 
their hands, doing what might be done to more purpofe, and 
at Icfs expence,by the fingle draught of a fuflicient harrow. The 
com hooks are fo very finall, that the fhearer who cuts 2 
thraves rf the thickcft com in a day, is hard wrought. Th€ 
manure is carried fi-om the dunghill on horfes, and every 
horfe mud have his leader ; though no place is better calctn

in it, unlefs when it is covtred with ihow. * 

The drynefs of the foil, enables the £urmers to begin and 
end their feed-time fooner than in other parifhes. Their oats 
are generally fovn in February and March^ and their bear in 
April. Their harveft often begins in Auguft and is ended 
with September. 

Their meadow and pafture grounds are very eztenfive^ 
The tenants in thefe parifhes are fuppofed to have at prefent

merk. The dimenfions of the merk varies not only in the 
diffi^rent parifhes of Shetland, but in different towns of the 
^ fame parifh ; and though in fome of the towns, in thefe united 
parifhes, it wili not meafure above half a Scots acre, yet fo much 
does it exceed the Scots acre in others, that the whole of the 
arable land cannot be lefs than 1600 acres.-^The rents are paid

P(?/y«^/Aw.— The number of inhabitants in thefc pariflies, 
Aole of the village of Scalloway included, amounts to 1794. 
The average uf births^ for thefc laft five years has been 45, 
and that of marriages 14, annually. The average of deaths 
cannot be afcertained with preciiion, as it has not besn cuf* 
ternary to reg^firate theou 

Fi/berieSy £5*^ .—Many of the inhabitants are employed in the 
ling fifliing \ though few of them can be faid to follow this 
employment with advantage to themfclves. Their local £• 
Illation feems to forbid their profecuting this bufinefs. They 
carry it on from ftations 10, 20, and 30 miles diftaal from 
their own houfes. Thus they are from home during the 
ikmmer months \ and all they can earn by it, is but a poor 
compenfation lor what their farms, their flocks, and tl^cir far 
milies muft fufier by their abfence. 

The women, when not bufied about farm work, are cm» 
ployed in knitting coarfe ftockings. This has of late become 
an objeft worthy their attention. Formerly the ftockings of 
Shetland were fent to Holland and Hamburgh ; but the difier-

rent of the country : and this difference muft be afcribed to 
the patriotic and benevolent exertions of Sir John Sinclair. - 
There are two very neceflary bndgcs in thefe pariflies ; 
one over a water that runs into Laxforth Voe, and the other 
where the Loch •of Strocne -coi^piuniaites with the Voe of 
Binnanefs. Thefe bridges are at prefent In very bad ovAtr* 
To open a more eafy communication with the town of Ler- 
wick, Mr Rofs of Sound, aided and fupported by Mr Scott 
of ScottthaU, the jheriff-fubftitute, has done a great deal to 
make a good and commodious road. This, over mountains 
and vallies of the decpeft mofs, was at firft thought imprac- 
ticable, and every obftruftion was thrown in his way; but, 
in (pite of difficulties and difcouragement, he pcrfevcred, uo- 
til he had formed a road about 16 feet in breadth, and ex- 
tending from the parjfli .of Tingwall to Lerwick. He is now 
-covering it with clay and gravely and fo much of it as is thus 
covered, looks well, and promifes kiratioii* 

The remains of antiquity in thefe parUhes are hardly worth 
notice. At Scalloway there is an old ruinous caftle, built in 
1600 by Patrick Stewart, Earl of Orkney ; and in fome other 
places, the ruins, of Piftifh caftles, s^d Popiih clu^els, are to 
be met with. 

The minifter*^ gld)c is on a rifiog gronnd, at the north 
end of the loch of Tingwall, three miles north from Scallo- 
way, and two fouth from Laxforth Voe, and in fight from 
both. The manfe and kirk inland on the higheft part of this 
rifing ground. The kirk :was iuilt in 1 788, and the manfe 
in I7P5 ; and both are in good order. The foil of the glebe 
is excellent'; and its being fo remote from the fea, renders 
it the moft proper fpot in this country for experiments in 
^culture : but the want of inclofures, in a country where 
there are no herds, and 'wher« the herding aft has hardly 
l)ccn heard of, muft operate powerfully againft all agricul-

and confifts of 5 11. fterling in ca(h, communion elements in-

Amfterdam weight, 

The parochial fchool.is vacant; md indeed no decent 
man will take charge of it^ until the prefent falary, which is 
only 100 merks Scotch^ is augmented. There isj and has 
been for fevernl years, a fchool in Wcifdale, fupported by the 
Society for propagating Chriftian Knowledge. This fchool L 
taught by Mr George Clunes, whofe ufefulnefs, and attention 
to the duties of his office, entitle him to particular notice. 

The number oi poor in thefe pariihes is about 40. The 
Sabbath Day's collections are divided jamong them quarterly; 
but their principal fupport is fixm the private charity of their 
neighbours : and it may not be improper, to conclude this 
fiatiftical account, with observing, that the inhabitants of thefe 
pariihes, are in general humane, induftrious, decent in their 
inanners, and regular in their attendance pn the ordinances 
of our holy religion.

Next to Dunroiliiefs, this is the moft pleafant diftridt ia 
Zetland. In the fouth part of it, ftands the village of Scallo- 
way, once the only one in Zetland. It has never been very 
large -, though built on the ilore of a fine harbour^ and upon 
a much better foil than Lerwick. It is now rather on tlie 
decline. 

Op. the fouth-eaft end of the village, ftaxuls the old caftie 
of Scalloway, built by Patrick Stewart, Earl of Orkney. It 
is faid, that his obliging the ; inhabitants to work three days, 
on their own charges,* in aflifting at the building, gave rife 
to much murmuring, and produced manv complaints of op- 

preiEon.

prcffion. The fabric is long ago in ruins ; but the \r4ll is 
ftraight and entire as on the day that it was finifhed, except 
where they have torn the freeftone out of it^ The lime of 
this building is iirm and hard, as a rock ; and affords an ad;^ 
. ditional proof, that the manner of preparing lime, fo as to 
give good cement for building, was not loft in the wreck of 
antient Rome, as has erroneously been alledged. This houfe 
has been defigned for defence againft any fudden attack ; 
having on each comer the old-fafhioned round turrets, with 
many little port holes : but it could not have ftood out againft 
avtiHery. 

In the middle of thb village fives Mr Scott b( Scalloway, 
in a neat little modern houfe. This gentleman has done a 
good deal to hinder the village from falling into decay. At 
the weft end of the village is the houfe and garden of Weft- 
{hore. The houfe is a mean old building. The garden, when 
properly taken care of, is by much the beft in Zetland. Here 
are feveral flthibs, bufhes, and even trees, which arc fcarcely 
to be feen any where elfe in thefe iflands ; feveral ellons, 
(elms, I fuppofe,) plane tree, willows, grown to- a good 
thicknefs, but very low. Some years ago, I faw here :hc 
bay, the laurel bay, mezcreon, horfe chefnut, box, afh, and 
a good thorn hedge, and broom, which here is a fine 
Souriihing fhrub ; alfo goofeberries, currants, honeyfuckle. 
Many of thefe are now loft, fince the garden has been ne* 
glefted. 

From Scalloway, north-eaft, is a line pleafani valley, with 
a good many fmall inland farms \ but a part of this valley is 
occupied by two lakes. On the north end of the largeft, and 
at icme diftance from Scalloway, is the kirk and manfe of 
Tingwall. lliis kirk had once a fteeple at the weft end of 
it ; but of late it has been taken down, left its fall fhould 
bring down the roof of the kirk. In the lake is a fmall

ifland) to wbicli they enter by fteppinji^ftones from the xaaan* 
land. Here tradition fays that the courts of juftice were 
kept ; and from this the ifland was called the Lawtaing. One 
cttftom they had is worth mentioning ; That if any perfoA 
was condemned to fuffer puniihment for any crimet the ien* 
tence was intimated to him by the court ; and as only the 
members of the court and the parties were admitted mto the 
Lawtaingy thofe remotely concerned, and the idle fpeftatcnrs^ 
^kood on the banks of the lake. It y^^s allowed to the con-- 
demned aiminal to endeavour to make his efcape ta the kirk 
of Tingwall ; his ^ay led through the crowd of fpeAators \ 
and if he effe£ted his efcape, either by their favouring his 
caufe, or by fuperior fwiftnefs or ftrength, and reached the 
kirk, he was on that account freed bom the puniihment. 
This was a kind df appeal to the people from the fentence of 
the judge-. 

This valley extends two miles N.Ei from Tingwall, where 
It is terminated by the Voe of Laxforth, a very £ife harbour; 
but as there is no trade here, it is never frequented. 

Tlirough all this valley there is great plenty of good limc- 
ftojie, of a bluifli colour, yielding a fine white lime. Some 
very imperfeft attempts have been made to manure the 
ground with it ; but as the ground never is ley above one 
year, and is never fallowed, it cannot be expected tkat lime 
will do it much fcrvice.

The above is an adage well known over Scotland} even to 
&amp;ofe who are unacquainted with the Gaelic language. It is 
expreffive, of the remote and inaccefSble fituation of the coun-« 
try to which it applies. It was viewed in that light by the 
hardy heroes of Caledonia, at a time, when war and hunting 
were their (ble trade and employment, when their wants were 
few, and their defires moderate. Much more ftrikingly muft 
it appear fo to us ; when the progrefs of knowledge and civi- 
lization ha&amp; enareafed our defires for the conveniences, the 
comfertsj and the embellifhrnents of lifie, at Ihe fame time 
that it has in the fame propoftion cncreafed the means of gra- 
tifying them. But though Lochowfide, firom its inland fitua- 
tion, has little intercourfe with other places, the country itielf 
u far from being dreary or unproduflive. The beauty of 
tkc lake, and its ntfmcrous iflands and caftles, with the fertile

plains and cxtcnfive woods along its coafts, contrafted witfl 
the fplendid grandeur of its furrounding mountains, have at* 
trafted the attention of all tpavellers of tafte, and of none 
more than the elegant defcriber of the fublime and beautiful. 
Nor are the inhabitants of this country deficient in genius or 
induftry. Surmounting the dif&amp;culties of fituation, more of 
them, than perfiaps of any diftrift of equal population in Scot- 
land, have brought thcmfelves forward into notice and conft- 
#»uencc 5 and appear, with credit to thcmfelves and with ad- 
vantage to others, in the learned profcflions, as well as in the 
commercial, the military, and the- naval departments. To a 
people to whom nature has been fo kind, it is a pity that art 
fhould not lend its affiftance. They have long envied thofe, 
who, by means of navigable canals, came to the enjoyment of 
rwivantages which were formerly denied them. The diftance 
however of Lochow from the fea, and the expence attending 
a junction of them, prevented the inhabitants of this country 
nlmoft from communicating their wifhes on this fubjeft to 
each other, much more from laying a plan of a Lochow Ca- 
nal before the public. But, now that a fubfcription has been 
completed for a canal from Crinan to Lochgilphead, which 
brings the comrttunication with the fea nearer to Lochow j 
what might formerly bt looked upon as a vifionary plan, be- 
comes now, not only prafticable, but an objeft highly expe- 
dient. 

It appears, from the returned eftimates of an engineer em- 
ployed by the landed proprietors of the country, that a paf- 
fagc may be lAade, from the Crinan Canal to LochoMr, to ad* 
mit flat-built veffels from 50 to 60 tons burthen,

It has been objefted to canals, that they hurt the coafting 
trade, which is fo ufeful a nurfery for manning our Clips of 
war. By the fame mode of reaibning, our Weft India fleet 
ihoukl be obliged to viCt the Cape of Good Hope, in tlic 
courfc of their voyage, for the purpofe of making more expert 
failors : As if the arts of peace were not equally entitled to 
attention with thofe of war ; as if to enjoy life were not a 
national objed, no.lefs than merely to preforve it. To fuch 
objedUons, one anfWer feems to be fuflicient ; that if canals 
have a tendency to add to the refources of a country, its in- 
duftry, iis wealth, and its population, they, in the fame pro- 
portion, add to its means of defence againfl foreign enemies. 
Tbele obje^ons, however, do not apply to the Lochow Ca* 
naL It were cafy to flicw, that it would not only add to the 
eoafting trade, but that it would likewife become a valuable 
pqrfery for feamen. The moft circuitous navigation capnot, 
I without a canal, introduce a fingle veflel to Lochow. The . 

! propoied canal, therefore, would not in the fmoUeil degree in 

I tcrfcre with the coafting trade. Inftead of that, the goods, 

I which are now procured by an expenfive land ciuria^e, wouldt 

I in that event, be cotftcd a conCderable didancc before they 

found their way to the canal. The hardy Highlanders of Glcn- 
' urcl^ and Lochow, who firft came from curiolity to gaze at 

I the maft and the fail, would foon be prevailed upon to ac^ 

 cept of employment on board. Their ambition would net 

! reft here. , When they got acquainted with the tars of the 

Clyde and the Thames, many of them would join them, in 
order to wipe oft' the ignominy of being confidered ^ frefli 
water failors \tj^d by reiigning their old births to a new fet, 
who would foon tread in the fteps of their brethren, the 
jLochow Canal would afford a conftant and increaiing fupply 
of men to the Britiih navy. 
That this can^l would afford a re^ifonable intereflf for the

money laid out upon it, is evident^ from its giving an inland 
navigation of more than 40 miles, being the diftance from 
the Crinan Canal to the N. E. end of Lochow : And this 
mfiilly upon one of the largeft frefe water lakes in Scotland % 
where fhoals of faltnon, trout, char and eel,— -where hanging 
precipices of Itmeftone,-- -and waving forefts, nodding o'c^ 
the deep,—- with the wool of the bleating flocks, fpread over a 
thoafand hiUs,^-^powcrfuUy invite tlie genius of commerce to 
thtl'e long-negleded regions. From the difHculty of exporta- 
tion, the fineft and largeft falmon have been frequently {old 
to the inhabitants at 6d. each. Th6 Lochow trout are nnrt- 
valed perhaps in any part ofaKe known world. They are of 
hc hneft quality, and are fotind from tlie fmalleft fize to 
jclK wAght. As a Specimen of the value of the Lochowfidi; 
woods : The ftool of oak, upon a farm of 40L rent, cut down, 
when only 20 years old, fc^ bark and charcoal, though thcfe 
articles could be exported only by an expenfive land Carriage, 
fold, more than 30 years ago, at 800I. fto-ltng. What tl)pi 
fnaft be the value of fuch woods, when they can be remove4 
by water carriage 5 fome of them probably manufadlured into 
farming utenfils for the comparatively woodlefs diftrids of 
Kintyre, Iflay, Bute, and Arran, and the other Weftem III 
lands ? when the eftablifhment of the canal will make fliip 
building no iQconfiderable article of the Lochow trade ? or, 
when the Lochow oaks will attraft the attention of govern^ 
ment, and be carefklly prefervcd for the porpofes of til^ 
Royal Navy ? 

But, though fahnon, wool and timbtr wonld be the chief 
articles of cxpMrtation 5 they arc by no means to be confidered 
as the only ones. A valuable lead mine has been wrought with 
advantage, for a confiderable time paft, at Hendrom, with- 
in i:: miles of the extremity of Lochow, moft diftant from 
the propofcd canal. Lead and iron ore have likewifc been

fodtid ill difierent places in the ioimediate vicinity of the 
lake. On the cftate of Mr M'Dougall of Hayficld there is 
fine and traniparent granite. The pearl nrafclej from which 
pea^b of gineat vahie have hten extraAed^ is to be feen in ma^ 
ny of the Lochowfide and Glenurchy rivers. A rich vein of 
marie makes its appearance on the eftate of Mr Campbell of 
Inverliver. And there are abundant quarries of limeftone^ of 
fione of the fame quality with the Inverary or Su Catharine 
ftooei ;uid likewife of ftone of the fame nature with that of 
riie Water of Ayr, ufed in poliflririg marble. The lift of ex- 
portations may be clofed^ by mentioning hides, tatlowj and 
the fkins of goats, iheep, otter^, badgers, and foxesi 

As to articles of importation, it may be obfefred, that th6 
inhabitants of Lochowfide and Glenurchy, many of them 
proprietors^ and gentleman farmers, are as fond of the conve- 
niences and the luxuries of life as. their neighbours, and as 
wen aHc to afford them. It is plain, therefore, that the pro* 
ckice of the Eaft and Weft Indies, added to European com- 
modities, not found in their own country, fuch as wiile, por- 
ttf, beer, flour, herrings, fait, (bap, flates, hemp, iron, &amp;c* 
Wodid form their imports^ 

One article of importation, hoWeVer, doals, def*erves mord 
particularly'to be infifted on ; as it would add, in an almoft 
mconccivable degree, to the other impiMts, and to the exports, 
cBd the leglflature fhew {b much indulgence, not to fay poli- 
cy or juftice, as to remove the taat upon it. ♦ The introduc- 
tion of this one a2*ticle, fi^ from' taxes^ to Lochow^ would 
pre it a degree of confequence and profperity, which a lover ' 
rf his comitry cannot take even a profpeflirc view of with- 
out exultation* Inftead of exporting the raw materials of 
timber, wool, 5cc. the indnftry of the people would be, in the

home manufaftiire. The timber would lay a foimdadoii foir 
ihip-buildingy and the making of farming utenfils % the- 
charcoal and minerals^ for furnaces and founderies ^ the bark, 
for tanneries ; and the wool^ for fpinning, carding, weaving, 
and all the other branches of the woolen trade. No where 
are there to be found ftreams better adapted than thofe which 
run into Lochow, from their copious and conftant fupply of 
wateri to give motion to the machineiy ufed in the various 
branches of manufa£bire. One of thofe, the Water of Avkh, 
which gives name to the panfli of Dalavich, merits notice, 
from its being particularly fuited to the purpofes of an cxten- 
iive cotton work. It is fed by a fine lake» 3 miles in length, 
by one in breadth. It was never known to have been frozen. 
In the year 1740^ when the fait water of Lochfyne at Inve- 
rary was frozen^ fo as to admit horfes and carts, when moft 
of the com mills in Scotland were fliut up for a length of 
time, which created general diftrefs) the mill of Avich was 
kept conftantly goings and afforded relief to the furrounding 
country. 

The iutrodu£lion of coal would tend to the prosperity of 
Lochow and Glenurchy; not only by giving riie to the efta- 
blifliment of manufactures, but likewife, by.enabUiq; the far- 
mers to make greater quantities of lime, and to empky, in 
the improving of their mofles and moors, that time which is 
now confumed in fpoiling them, by fearching for peats, or in 
the more hurtful occupation of cutting down the woods for fuel. 

The promoting of the Lochow Canal, is particularly recom- 
mended to thofe noblemen- and gentlemen who have already 
fuhfcribed to that of Crinan. The two canals will be fo mu« 
tcially.beneficial to each other, that they ought to have been 
included m one common farvey, eftimate, and fubfcription. 
Docs Crinan Canal bring the commimication with the fea 
nearer to Lochow ? The Lochow Canal doubly repays that 

advantage,

adramtage» m becoming an excellent feeder to it, and in fub- 
3eAiiig the whole trade of Lochoir and Glcnurchy to its lock- 
ages. The greater the general trade, the more reafonably 
may the lock dues on each Teflel be afforded : and* thus the 
Lochow Canal, will powerfully contribute to take away all in- 
ducement, £rom the traders round the Mull of Kintyrej to 
•continue that dangerous na-vigatio'n, or to wi(h that a cheaper 
paflage had been made at Tarbert.

or 24 computed miles are already finiflied, in a flyle of fu|)erb

Sib, Gigia^ a ijl December y 1 79a. 

Jn the Statiftical Account of this parifH, I hinted at the 
advantages of a canal acrofs the ifthmus of Crianan in Ar- 
gylefhire, and of another between Fortwilliam and Invcmcfs, 
With regard to the former, it mijfl afford pleafure to every 
lover of national improvements to imderftand, that the fub- 
fcriptioh for that important work is now completed^ and coi)- 
fequently (hat there is a prolpeA of its being foon carried in- 
to execution. Beijdes the advantages refulting from it to the 
public, it will be attended with the happieft efieds to the 
poor mariner, at this feafon of the ^ear, when the navigation 
round the Maoil of Ceanntire is fo difficult and dangcih)us. 
If it be not reckoned too great prefumption, I would beg 
leave to mention fome things which occur to me, refpe^ling 
the inland navigation between Invemefs and Fortwilliam. 
'H^ tra^ I have bjid Qccs^on to travel ofien *, and^ though Det 

ther 



The Staiiftkal Accounts 293 

ther mj ftudies nor views were direfled to fuch fulge^Sj I 
'could not reiift a certain impulfc which led me, repeatedly, to 
examine the ground, and ftill makes me ardently wijli, that, 
ibme time or otheri a national fpirit of improvement would 
be excited to open this communication! which nature ieems 
to have intended, as the moft important obje5l, for commer- 
cial enterprise, that ever was undertaken in Great Britain. 

There is no perfon of common obfervation that travels 
from FortwilUam, through Strath Iiochy, to Invemefs, but 
lauft be ftruck with the aftoniOiing contrail; between a levd, 
ypwards of 60 miles long, exten^ng acrofs the ifland from 
fea to iea, and ranges of the highed hills in Scotland ^ 
]ioth fides. This level, which is nearly in a ftraigbt line from 
N. E. to S. W. confifls of land and watcl- : fo that nature 
not only favours fuch an. undertaking (by the flatncfs of tl^ 
jround), but has in facl completely iinilhed n^re than one 
tialf of it already. Lochnefs is reckoned 20 miles in length. 
Loch I^Khy 16, and Loch Oich 5 \ in alU upwards of 40 
miles. 

To enumerate all the advantages of this navigation., is a talk 
I am not quaUHed to undertake ; but to ihofe who are coiv- 
verfant in the feafaiing and commercial lines, and who l\^ve 
enlarged views of the prefent fl*te of the country, they muft 
be obvious and ftriking, even upon a bare inipe^lion of the 
map. As th^ occur to me, the advantages of tliis canal may 
be eoafidered in three points of vi^^w : Firft, As it refpe&amp; , 
the adjacent countries \ Secondly, The conuncrcial int^ereft of 
£agland and Ireland ; and Laftly, Tiie improvement of the 
fiiheries, and the introduction of trade and manufaElures i^" 
to the Weftern Ides and Highlands of Scotland. 

L On the north fide of this level or valley, are the coun« 
tric$ of Urquhart, Glenmorifon, part of Abcrtarf, Glengary, 
mi that part of Lochafaer which furrpunds I^charcaig and 

thence 



2^ General Appendix to 

thence extcf^ds to the head of Lochial. On the fouth fide 
lies Strathharrie, part of Abertarf, Lettcrfinlay, Keppoch and 
Glen-navas. All thcfe extcnfivc countries, abound with cx^ 
cellent woods, (confining chiefly of oak, afh, elm, birch and 
fir ;) which at prefent, however, are of no great value to the 
proprietors, nor of any real advantage to the public, for want 
vof water carriage to bring them to market. In all parts of 
thefc countries, bordering on the fides of the fuppofed canal, 
there are rivers, and copious ftreams of water, for woricihg all 
kinds of machinery * and, notwithftanding the emigrations 
that have taken place from fome of the diftrids, there art 
ftill many inhabitants, who, by habits of induftry, might be- 
come a valuable acquiCtion to the manufa^hiring and fea- 
faring part of fociety. The lakes and rivers arc well ftored 
with fahnon and troi|t ; the low grounds, for the moft part» 
capable of being rendered very fertile ; and the hills not (iir- 
paflcd by any in Scotland for flieep ranges. In fhort, this 
valley between Invemcfs and Fortwilliam, were the canal 
opened, and manufa£hires eftablifhed on both fides of tt^ 
•would foon become the centre of trade in the Highlands ; 
where the mechanic, the merchant, and the manufaAurery 
would find fnfHcient employment, and the induftrious labourr 
cr meet with due encouragement. 

IL With regard to the commercial intereft of England 
'and Ireland, a canal here, on fuch a fcale as to admit veileb 
drawing about i6 feet water, would be attended with moft 
folid and permanent advantages. Afi fliips from Ireland and 
the weft coaft of Britain, bound for die eaft coaft, for Hot- 
land, or the Baltic, could perform tteir voyage in, at leafi^ 
a third Icfs time than now, and with greater fafety. In YSkt 
manner, all the Weft India and American traders, firom the 
caft of Scotland and north-eaft coaft of England, could avoid 
the circuitous an(I dangerous navigation df the Pentland 

Firths

Pikth ; and^ in time of war, could rendezvous at bivemefs or 
Fortwilliam, protected by ihrong forts, and in harbours that 
may juftly be reckoned among the fafeft and moft capacious 
in tke kingdom. Befides, a firigate or two, ftationed in the 
Moray Firth between Peterhead and Fori George, together 
%rith as many on the weft colft, between the found of MuU 
and the north of Ireland, could afibrd greater protefHon Iq 
eur trade in thofe quarters, than many times the number at 
prcfent, when the navigation round the north of Scotland is 
£ fcattcred. 

III. As to the Weftem Ifles, and the oppofite coaft of tho 
Highlands, where every thing, but proper encouragement 
from the government, contribtites to raife them to the high^ 
eft eminence, in a commercial and^maritime yiew, the bene-' 
fits of this canal would be immenfe. Thoufands, who ar« 
kft to themfelvet and to the world, might be ufefully em« 
ployed. Many families, who pine in want, might live in 
affluence; and feveral, who, contmry to their inciinatioo, 
are obliged to leave their native foil, and remove to other 
ftates, might contribute to the ftrength and wealth of their 
own country. Large tra£h of land, now in a barren ftate,* 
might be improved \ and thofe parts, which at preient af^ 
ford but a fcanty fiibilftence to a fmall number of inhabi- 
tants, might be fo far meliorated, as, with the help of com- 
merce, to fupport a numerous population* 

That the above aflertions may not appear too bold or ex- 
aggerated, let it be obferved, that the herring fifhing, which 
at preient is entirely confined to one fide of the kingdom, 
would, by means of this canal, become ojien to both ; fo that 
twice the number of hands might be employed in that 
branch : and the cod and ling fiihing, which is yet but in its 
infancy, might be carried on as extenilvely as the herring 
fiihing. In sjl the attempts hithertp made in the white fifli- 



tp^ Geifetal Appe?tdix to 

ing, people have been employed ait a great ^pence ftotik tke 
craft country, Thefe people, having no permanent place of 
refidcncc cm the weft coaft, are in general ejqHfed to. fo 
much fatigue and danger on their jonmey over land, or hi 
their pafil^ round, through the Pcrttland Firth^and arc Ha- 
We to fo many inconveniences, on their arrival, for Want of 
jj^roper lodgings, and other accommodations, that tbek* exer* 
tions muft be languid, and of courfe their fuccefs precarious/ 
Tliis being the cafe, it is no wonder, that adventurers in the 
white fifliingy after being at confiderable expence and trouble^ 
fhmild drop the plan as totally imprafticable* Now, were 
the canal opened, all thefe obftacles might be removcdr 
Ii!irge reflels, t^ith every convfcniency along with themy 
might be fitted out from Cromarty, Invernefs, and other 
towns in the Moray Firth, which, in the conrfc of a few 
d'.iYs, tnight fail to the fifhmg grounds, where they coubi 
clioofc f.\^(i harbours in the neighbourhood of the beft banks. 
Be fides the adtantage of having all their neceflaries on board, 
the profpeft of returning fooh t© their families and friends 
would double their induftry and eJtertions. In this way, rh« 
white fifliing would foon become fuccefsfal : and the natives 
of the Weftern Ifles, by their intercourfe with theeaft coun- 
try people, tfrotild acquire the knowledge of it m a fhorc 
time, and be able to co-opei*ate with their infthiElors in 
bringing it to fuch perfection, and carrying h on to fuch an^ 
f xtent, as to become a confidcraWe objeA in the commerce 
of the kingdom. 

By means of this canal, the falmon fi(hings on the Urcft 
coaft could alfo be improved, and have ready acccA to tlie 
London market. Thus they would become very valuaUe tt 
the proprietors ; though hitherto they have almoft aU been lit- 
tle attended to, except that of Lochy, near FortwiUiam, where

and lisolumcill; to which may be added, the limeftone, fhclt 
Amd, and kelp of the Weftem lifands, and all the oak if^oodtf 
of the Weft coaft, eTp^clsdly thofc of IjOW, A^pin, Morveff 
and Ardnamorchan ^. But, without di(^eUi)ig any longer 
on particulars, it may be fafely affirmed, that, by fifliing, 
and an interchabg^ oJF cotnmodtties betweeil the eiiaft and 
W6ft coafis of Scotland, through this cahs^, excjiifi^e ^f the 
advantafges in trade and the number of people occupied itf

calculation, might be employed in thofc parts. Cohn^dftcd 
^th the ot)ier two catials, this one woul) occafion a circu- 
btion in trade ; which is a« neceilary to the exiftende of tht 
commercial fyftem, as the circulation of fluids is to that of 
the animal body. And, laflly, all the improvements in 
fifhing, fanning, mechanics, and matiufadures, of the eaft 
country, nught eafily be communicated to the inhabitants of

298 General Appendix iv^ 

As fome people, from confined ideasy may think, that the 
intereft of thofc, concerned in the Clyde and Crianan inland 
navigation) would fuffery were this canal carried on \ it will 
not be improper to obferve, that the advantages to be de- 
rived from the former, can neva* be fully experienced, tiU the 
latter be opened* The three, taken together, as hinted at 
above, will form a chain, in the fyftem of internal com- 
merce, which will, be productive of advantages never to be 
derived from them fingly, or from any two of them, without 
the third. 

Let us now fuppofe, that, in any part of England, the com- 
munication from the eaft to the weft coaft were, for ooo or 
300 miles, interrupted by high mountains, except in one 
place^ where there was an opening or flat acrofs the country; 
nay, let it be fuppofed, that, in fuch a fituatTon, there were 
only two vallies penetrating from each coaft into the country, 
and approaching in a ftraight line within a ftiort diftance of 
each other, where their jun£tion was interrupted by a crofs 
ridge of hills : In this caie, where nature had done io much, 
though {he did not complete the whole level, the enterprif- 
ing fiMrit, for which our fouthem neighbours are (b juftly 
famed, would, long fince, have been exerted t9 furmount 
every difficulty, in order to open fuch a communication \ not 
only by cutting a cantil in the level part of the ground, but 
aUb, by piercing through the hill or mountain which oc«- 
caiioned the interruption. What ihall wc fay, then, of our- 
felves, for our want of attention to this great objeA of nation^ 
al improvement; where nature has, not only given us a con- 
tinued level from fea to fea, but has likewife performed more 
than one half of the work to our hand, by a chain of lakes^ 
where {hips of the line could {ail with fs^y ? 

Befides the above advantages, for facilitating this.great un- 
dertaking! nature has beco favourable in other refpeAs. 

There 



The StatiftUal Account. 299 

There is hardly any continuance of froft in this valley to ia- 
tq-mpt the navigation in the winter feafon. Lochnefs never 
fireezesji and Loch Lochy feldooi. Now, if the canal were 
made on a large fcale, (from 16 to 18 feet deep,) there would 
be almoft a certainty of its continuing sdways open ^ efpecial- 
I7 when we take into the account, the number of fprings 
which abound at the bottom cff fuch high, mountains, many ' 
of which muft be opened in the traA of the canal. 

Another thing worthy of notice is, that the fummit (or 
higheft ground at Lagan-achandronfi between Loch Lochy 
and Loch Oich, which is a flat, about two miles long, and 
half a mile broad,) could be conftantly fuppUed with water 
from both fides by two burns; one (helving down the hill on 
the ibuth fide, about the middle of the ground, and another 
larger one on the north fide, which runs into Loch Lochy at 
the weft end of the fummit, but which could eafily be 
brought into the canal, if found neceflary. 

Upon the whole, the facility of accompUfhing a work o( 
fuch magnitude and importafice, highly deferves the atten- 
tion of every one who has the intereft of his country ai 
heart. May I, therefore, be permitted to indulge the plea(^ 
ing hope, that one, who has fo eminently diftinguiflied him- 
felf, in promoting national improvements, as Sir John Sin- 
clair, wiU, ait fome feafonable time, ufe his influence to di- 
re£l the attention of government and of the public to this 
great objeA ? The happinefs of thoufands of virtuous and 
loyal iubje&amp;, as well as the internal wealth and ftrength 
of the Britifh empire, might be promoted by it. This, at 
leaft, is the pe/fuafion of on/e, who, though little acquaint- 
ed with 'the world, and confined to a retired comer, re^ 
joiccs in the profperity of his country, and, if in his power, 
would cheerfully promote it. This being his firm perfua- 
fion, he humbly hopes, it will be deemed a fufficicnt apo-

<p>SIR, 

Otf the publication of your propofals for compiling a Sta;^ 
tiftical Account of Scotland, I was no le&amp; ftruck with the 
novelty of the defign, than gratified with the profpeA of it9 
execution. From the united exertions of the clergy, a body 
highly refpcAaUe in point of ranks charaAer aUd abilities^ 
refiding on the diftriAs recommended to their inveftigation, 
poflefied of kifure to examine them with precifion, and of 
accefi to every private fource of intelligence, it was natural ta 
expeft a produAion, which no traveller, however aiBduou» 
in his bbours, could equal as to extent, nor, however mi^ 
Qute in his enquiries, could approach as to accuracy. But^ 



302 General Afpen£» io 

among the various articles of a work^ the plan of which 
embraces every objcft of importance, either refpe^ting the 
cotintry or its ii^i^bitants ; I tonfefs my furprize was greats 
to find in the earlier volumes, fo little attention paid to the 
general ftate of education, or the national means of inftruc- 
tion provided for the lower clafles of the people. In the lat- 
ter part of the work, indeed, the fubjeA has been taken up 
with a proper degree of fpirit \ and the clergy have evinced 
themfelves worthy of their truft, by the* pertinent and libe- 
ral remarks they have made on this interefting topic. A 
regular efiay, however, it is thought, would exhibit the mas 
tcr in a more forcible and effectual point of view, than cur- 
f ry and unconnected obfervations ; efpecially, as it is not, 
like many other branches of the ftatiftical enquiry, afieded 
I'V local differences : and the fame remarks are, indifcrimi- 
n.itely, applicable to the country at large. 

Under tliefe circumftanccs, the following memoir is fub- 
initted to your attention, without preface or apology. It 
confifts, partly of fa^,, and partly of obfervations \ points 
out the moft ftriking defefts and hardfiiips in the mode of 
education at prcfcnt employed in Scotland; and propofes 
fome remedies, which perhaps might be applied, if not' with 
fuccefs, at leaft with fafety. Should it afford one hint £or 
further enquiry, or contribute the fmalleft portion of mate- 
rials to your work, a valuable purpofe would be anfwered. 
To that undertaking it ovi^es its ^origin : an undertaking to 
which the public are highly indebted ; as it has given birth 
to many excellent papers, which, but for its foftering pro- 
tection, would probably never have been publi/hed \ or, had 
they been publifhed, would have been buried in obfcurity, 
without obtaining the regard due to their merit, or promo- 
ting the benevolent intentiobs of their authors.

The Siatiftical AccmA. 303 

In every country celebrated for the wifdom of its legifla* 
lion, and the virtue of its inhabitants, the culture of youth, 
70U well know, has been confidered as an objeft of the high- 
eft consequence, and has been provided for by the united ex- 
ertions of abilities and care. It would be an affront, to load 
the page with quotations from the hiftorian and philofopher, 
. or to mention examples of governments in ancient cr mo- 
dem times; fince they are too obvious to be overlooked^ 
and too memorable to be forgotten. Statefmen, by whofe 
falutary regulations the interefts of knowledge and morality 
have been promoted, and fovereigns, under whofe fbllering 
auipices they have flourifhed, now enjoy the reputation juftly 
ioe to their defertsu Learning gratefully repays the favours 
which (he received \ and with honours, fuperior, in the eyes 
of judicious pofterity, to thofe of heroes and of conquerors,

meed aligned to the exertions of Lorenzo de Medicis and 
Peter the Great ; and fucli, in the future annats of mankind, 
will he that of every rninifter or fovereign, who, like them, 
ihall devote his abilities' to the true improvement of the coun- 
try over which he prefides. 

Of the excellence or propriety of any mcafurc, the general 
practice and approbation of the wife has juflly been confidered 
as an almoft unexceptionable proof. But, let us not appeal 
folely to the opinion of others, where we are fully enabled 
0urfelves to judge j nor refer to experience alone, where rea- 
fon alfo is competent to decide. To you, Sir, and to all 
who are verfed in political fcience, the attentive culture of 
youth muft appear a ftrift confequcnce from the founded 
principles of that fcience. It 13 the ultimate objeft of every 
great legiflator, to render his country powerful and happy. 
To be powerful and happy, the people muft be virtuous 
and enlightened. Virtue and knowledge are not the growth

root in childhood, and advance with riper years. They arc the 
fniits of education j and in proportion as education is con* 
diifted with liberality and care, its fruit will arrive at excel- 
lence and maturity. 

The original genius of the prefent govermftents of Etlropc 
was highly hoftilc to the propagation of learning. Barba- 
Tous courage, and Wind attachment to a fuperior, were the 
only qualities that led to wealth, to advancement, and to 
glory. From the nature of the feudal ryikm each clan ex- 
ert rd a kind of repuliive power ; and being thus iniulated^ 
ar .iff-chral barrier was reared againft all intercourfe of friend*' 
ihip, and all commnnication of knowledge. Some princes, 
indeed, animated by the fpirif, and worthy of the remen 
brance, of better times, bravely diftinguifhed themfelves front 
the contemporary herd ; recsdled learning from her obfcure 
retreats, and endeavoured to re-animate her expiring ho&amp; 
ours. But thb dawn was foon overcaft, from a quarten 
whence it was' leaft to be expelled. That religion, which 
was fent from heaven to be a light to enlightoi the gentiks, 
^ad to remove the film oi darknefs from the ijltelle^al eye. 
Was converted into a powerful engine of ignorance and fu- 
perftition. In the primitive ages of Chriftianity, the clergf 
had acquired an unexampled influence over the people, by 
the mild pcrfuafion of their eloquence, and the lUideviat- 
ing re£Htudc of their conduft. Loth to relinqUifii theii* 
power, though they had already reflgned their virtues, they 
contrived other means to preferve, if not to augment it. 
They cftablifhed a new fet of pretenfions, laid claim to many 
fupernatural endowments, and boldly deduced their fuperi- 
ority from the deputation of heaven. Crofs and palpable 
affumptions like thefe can be admitted only by the mofl pafc

^been found to be the fruitful mother. On the revival of 
ieumngf therefore, the alarm was ivuhediai^ely caught by the 
priefthood ; every avenue for its farther difiufion was care- 
iiilly barred ; the people, by more than Mahometan feveritj, 
rere xiot even indulged in the ufe of their bibles } and vigo- 
rous ooeafures were adopted, to f(}uare thdr -knowledge to 
the conveniences of the church, and to adjuft their belief to 
the purpofes of ghofUj edification. Thus, the little lamp of 
learning, that had juft begun to gUmmer, though not totally 
cxtingoiihed, was not permitted to anfwer any beneficial pur- 
pofe. It was employed in the inveftigation of no objeA of 
pra£Hcal or moral tendency, and its beams were confined to 
the chambers of a few; while the darkneis, in which the 
multitude were involved, was equally deplorable in its origin 
. and its efibcts, and equally pernicious to the condud of in- 
dividuals, and to the fpirit of ibciety^ 

Britain had the felicity to be among the firft of the na^ 
tions^hat were emancipated from Popi^ flavery; and its in-

£ftent ^h the enlarged views of true patriotism. In orderi 
more fully, to remedy this inconvenience, in the fecond fet 
fion of the firft parliament of 'William and Mary, it was cn- 
aftcd, ' That there be- a fchool and%fchoolmafter in every 
' paroch ; his fee not under an. hundred marks, nor above 
^ two hundred^ to be paid by the heritors and liferenters in

This fcheme was wifely conceived, judicioufly executed, 
and attended whh a proportionable degree of fuccefs. It was 
even liberal, for the days in which it was projected. The 
fchools were numerous, and ec^uaily diftributed; their endow- 
ments were competent to fupply all the wants of mediocrity, 
without placing the mafter above the exercife of economy, 
or the exertion of induftrious talents ; and the tenure of thefe 
endowments was fimple, permanent, and refpe^lable. Of 
what rapid advantages the plan was produfUve, few, I pre- 
fume, need to be inforpied: For, few are ignorant of the wor-

From the uncommon d^ninution in (he vs^ue of money^ the 
emoluments of fchoolmafters arc totally inadequate to the 
fupport of their character; and it is to be fearcdi that, in the 
progrcfiiaii of a few years, they ^iU become not fufficienC 
even for the necefl^ purpofes of fubfiftetice« It is indeed a 
confiderable time iince this hardihip was feverely felt by the 
fufierers; and an application to parliament was made, by them^ 
for a remedy to the increaiing evil. Being then too youn^r 
to take intereft in theie afiairs, I am not acquainted with the 
particular plan of the biU, or the caufes of its rejeAion. I 
have been informed, however, that it mifcarricd^ partly by 
the imprude&amp;cc of its firiends, and partly by the malignity of 
its enemies : pf friends, whofe fufferings ought to have taught 
them more circum^pe6tioi| \ and of encoxiesj whofe rank and

From fome advertifements in the public prints^^ it appears^ 
that the defign is not yet totally relin^yiifhedj and that

From this detail, it is evident, that a labourer, with iiich 
an income, is barely enabled to protraA exiftence, without 
enjoying what are now accounted the comforts of life. The 
meagre food, on which he is condemned to fbbfift, is Dei«- 
ther calculated to- ftrengthen the body for continued la- 
bour, nor to invigorate the animal economy ; but, on the 
contrary, debilitates the fyftem, injures all its material opc* 
rations, and predifpofcs it for receivfaig and generating na- 
meious and deih'u^ve diftempers. In many relpe£h, haw** 
ever, the fchoolmafter labours, under' ftill greater difadvants^ 
gcs than the peafant» By the cuftoms of the world, the lat- 
ter is allowed to exert his induftry and firugtdity in many ca

sit his hours of leifure, can with his own hand^ provide ma- 
ny of the neccflTarics of a family, which the other is obliged 
to purchafe with a part of his little income ; and the one 
can appear with decency in clothing, which would entail cer- 
tain ridicule and contempt on the other. 

Such is the pidure of fcholaftic endowments, and fcho- 
laftic happinefs, in a large portion of North Britain : a pic- 
ture, where no ftiade is deqened by the colouring of difcon- 
tent, and no trait added by the pencil of exaggeration. In 
the hands of ibme, it would afibrd ample materials for pathetic 
defcripti^, for indignant remonftrance, and for pointed fatire. 
In Great Britain, that nurfery of freedom and pbilofophy; in 
the 1 8th cen|:ury, when the value and bleflingf of knowledge 
and literature are ib well underftood, and fo highly prized; 
and in the reign of G^rge the third, ever de^ed propitious 
to the arts and fciences ; fhall it be faid, that the lowed taK- 
gatherer enjoys an income double of that with which the in- 
ftruftor of youth is provided, and that the aggregate falary of 
five hundred fchoolmafters amounts to fo iiiconfidcrable a 
pittance as 8000I. ? Forbid it, juftice, virtue, l^onour! 

Leaving fuch reile£Hons to more aufgicioiis times, and 
more congenial pens; I fhall content myfelf with a few obfcr- 
vations on the injuftice and the inexpediency of fuch a fyP. 
tern: and which, to ufe the language of the fchools, will 
ferve to demonftrate its impropriety, both a priori and a 
fofleriori. 

It is a principle, laid down by aneminent political writer, 
and which is generally recognlfed in fociety, that the exercife 
of every trade or profeflion ought to be lucrative, in propor- 
tion to the time and expence beftowed in acquiring it. Arts 
that are foon and eafUy learnt, as they can be prafUfed by 
niany, mnft of confequcnce be cheap. But he who ferves a 
Jong apprenticcfhip, who pays a weighty fee, or who enters 

ioto 



312 General Appendix to 

into an expeniivc corporation, always adduces thofe circum^ 
ilances as pleas for ephancing the value of his labour. And 
the pradice appears to be founded in the ftri£tefl: laws of juf- 
tice*. Every trade is expe£bed to fumifh fubfiftence to the cx» 
crcxfer, and to reimburfe the original expenditure \ elfe it will 
be a loilng bufinels, and niuO: foon become extin^. He, there- 
fore, whofe rifle of time or money has been comparatively 
great, muft proportioaably increafe his income ; otherwife he 
injures ^is fortune, and leaves the world unable to perform 
for his poifterity what his predecefibrs did for him. Now, the 
time and expence, attendant on the courfe of education neceC* 
far^ for a fchoolmafter, are well known to be confiderablc : . 
the former, longer than is employed in the acquifition of moft 
other arts-, and tbe latter, more than is required for the know- 
ledge of many* They alfo enter into a kind of corporation, 
which, while it excludes a great nundser, does not operate, by 
that excluiion, to the benefit of the reft. It is, therefore, high- 
ly unjuft, that their wages fhould be fo inadequate * ; it is 
highly unbecoming the nation, which regulates thofe wages \ 
and it is highly injurious to virtue, by difcouraging one of 
the moft ufeful and important profeffions. 

There is another principle, which ieems not lefs founded 
in juftice, nor lefs recogniied in the code of honour; name- 
ly, the duty of fulfilling engagements. If an individual de- 
clare that he has the difpofal of a place of a certain annual 
value, and Invite perfbns properly qualified to become candi- 
dates for that place ; Ihould the fituation turn out inferior to

sot rul]ye£ted himielf to the cenfure of every honeft man ? 
oay, is he not .cognizable by law, and liable to be proTecuted 
for damages ? As it is with iftlividuals fo it is with nations^ 
The Britifh goTemment once had 900 fchopls in Scotland^ 
which ^hey offered as fituations for the acceptance of young 
men of learning and virtue. The emoluments of thefe fchools 
affirded a moderate fubfiftence \ and as the inftitution was 
declared perpetual, it was reafonably expeded that they would 
ftiU continue to afford the fame. Many, therefore^ inere edu- 
cated wit^ a view to cQndu£k thofe £bminaries, and iever^ are' 
ftill prepared for that employment. But one half of the pla^ 
ces are now nearly nominal^ and fcarcely produce fo comfortr 
aUe a livelihood as the moft common manual labour, which 
requires no previous education. Have not thofe youths, then, 
who for fuch difappointed hopes, not only relitiquKhed their 
probabile deftination, but alfo unfitted themfelves for any 
other; have not they a. claim, not on the generofity, but on 
the good faith and juftice of the nation i tibve they not a 
-right to demand provifion ? And how can they be provided 
for more naturally, more eligibly, or more advantageouflvi 
than by augmenting the falaries of the decayed ^mlnaries, 
and thus again laying open to them their original employ- 
ment ? Were xt for nought but their iituation alone, we are 
Wiuranted to pi:ono|ince the prefent ftate of fchools ilUbcrnl 

A third consideration occurs, which ougjbt to have much 
Wright with a generous legiflature, and which feems intimat&amp;- 
I7 connefted with diftributive juftice. Hardfhip and mifer^ 
fliould always be regarded in a comparative view ; their real 
ioiuence can be afcertained, only by examining the relations 
0^ thofe obje£fcs, on which they operate. Hunger and cold,

are more dreadful than death to the female of a delicate and 
Virtuous foul, arc little, felt itkA foon forgotten by her, who 
has been long refigned to licentious pleafure. Diftrefs, when 
it falls on thofe who have feen better days, as it is more poig- 
nant to the fufferers, is generally more commifer^ted by the 
fpedlators. To the pofitive faardfhips of the rchoolmafter, 
which we have ihewn to be of no fmall magnitude^ are fa- 
peradded all thofe which arife from education and habit. A 
cultivated mind, improved fenfibility, fome acquaintmce with 
the comforts of life, and previous hopes of attaining thofe 
comforts ; ?11 confpire to deepen the gloom of prefent pover- 
ty. In relieving the wretched, then, thefc ought to be con- 
fidercd in the forenjoft rank of fufferers, efpecially as their 
diftrefs is the confequence of chance, not of fgjly ; and if 
they are overlooked, it muft be a conftant ftigma not only 
on the feelings, but the juftice of the nation. 

Having now examine^ the nature of the fcholaftic fyftem, 
which is certainly repugnant to equity, let us next glance at 
the confequences^ which appear not lefs hoftile to general czpe- 
dieiicy. The firft important confequence is, that the fchoob 
sire not fupplied with proper teachers, thefe being either too 
young, or pofleiled of too little knowledge \ or, what is very 
commonly the cafe, perixaps deficient in both refpeAs. A fe- 
cond confequence coniifts in the coiainual flu^'hiation of maf- 
tcrs, who feldom occupy the lame department even for a few 
years, and who are always ready to quit the profeflion for 
any opening' in another Une *• Hence frequent vacancies,

from their dependance on the petty patronage of parents, of-

TdSbST, and coafiftency of eonda^ are likewife wanting} than 
which no qualities are more efiential to an inftrudor of yputh, 
or more conducive to the efficacy of his labours. The general 
refult appears to be, what clergymtn frequentlyobierve and 
lano^t, thoii^.,they feem to ha^ve overlooked this leading 
caule of it, % great decay of informajtion and of piety among 
the young, -wh^ are tqo.m^ch. immerfed in ignprs^ce and

and, as a reward for their meHtorious exertions, to enjoy tlie otium cum dignitate . 
in their declining years. Such a union, however, ought to be fdrmed on equal 
terms; and both parties ihould be mutually fubfervknt to their conmron intereft. 
But the cafe is different. The fchools at prefeni are degraded into mere nurferiet 
for the church, and are tatight by ftildetits in divinity, who, being nominated 
£ar the moft part by the interei^ cf the ininiflier« perform jufl as nmch of th» 
«duty as entitles them to the emoluments. This fituation occafions an undue 
dependance on the clergy, and is not propitious, on either fide, to the ftrld di&amp; 
charge of duty. Now, were there to be a preponderance of advantages to ei-« 
ther party, the fenfe of mankind wouVi perhaps give it in favour of the tcach'« 
ers, as moft important and effential to virtue. It might then lie regulated thae 
the church ihould be folely fuppUed by fchoolmailers, to fiicceed according ta

In the firft place— ^alarie^ adeqtrate 10 the coi|vetiienc«9

furniib inducements for men of abilities and worth to become 
the teachers. It might, perhaps, admit of feme difficulty^ to 
fpecify the precife fum proper to be fixed upon for this pur«« 
pofe; which would likewife be liable €0 vary in various dif* 
trifts of the country. But, couid it be contrived, neither to 
enhance the price of education, (which ought to be fixed at 
as low a rate as poflible,) nor to render the' niafter entirely

it is equally vain to devote the moft diftinguifhed talents to 
the bufinefs of education.-— If we likewife refleft.on the reve- 
rence with which children are accuftomed to look up to their 
snafler, and tlicir proncnefs to copy him in every rcfpeft ; the 
importance of purity of manners, and integrity of charafber, will 
be no lefs evident. The greateft deference is due to youth i the 
conduft of their inftru£tors ought not even to be liable to the 
breath of fafpicion : on the coirixary^ it ought to be a power-*

not expeA: from a teacher the confcientious difcharge of hi$

or virtue, when his example is at continual war with his io-i

pie parts of education, in a manner not entirely mechanical, 
a certain enlargement of ideas, and extenfion of views, is 
abfolutely requifitc. If the knowledge of the mafter has beea

courfe at the univerfity, is fufiicient preparation for teaching 
the true elements of knowledge, and communicating thofe 
general principles, which enable the learner to proceed b^ 
himfeif, and without which all learning is a mere automatic 
procefs.— None, therefore, ought to be admitted as parifh

The prefcnt fyftem, far. from giving general and equal play 
to the mental powers, affords employment for the n^mory 
alone. The other faculties aTe condemned to flumber in un- 
difturbed repofe ; and, from this early ina£livity, are neither 
allowed to acquire th^ir natural vigour, nor habituated to their 
future fun£tions. Like the puny limbs of fome wretchej

he has occaiioa for their aid \ or, perhaps, prove pofitively 
hurtful, from the wrong bias which chance may have led 
them to affiime. Arithmetic, the beft praxis of reafon, amd 
the nobleft field for the evolution of ingenuity and reflection,

grateful 9&amp;^ to difparage a ftudf , to which I am proud to 
confefi my obligations, as the duke Unimen laborum^ and the 
foarce of the moft delicious pleafures. On the contrary, I 
would propofe that diAincl academies fhould be eftablifhcd, 
at convenient diiVances, for this branch of education alone ; 
where it might be taught with more eafe, and on a bettor 
plan, thdR is commonly the cafe in our fchools. My only 
teaibn for difcarditig it from the general courfe, is, that the 
time aUotted would be infufficient for both purpofes. Thofe, 
who can afford to fend their fon&amp; to (chool for a confiderable 
number of ycars^ ought undoubtedly to have them inftru^ted 
in the la&amp;guages of ancient Greece and Rome, as well as* 
thole of modern Europe. As for the afTertion, that the 
ftudy of grammar, and paiticnhn-ly of Latin grammar, is pe- 
culiarly adapted to invigprate and fubtilize the intelleAual 
fiKiilti^, and forms the beft foundation for all other know« 
ledge ; it is fo evidently founded on the narrow prejudices 
of pedagogues, and on a total ignorance of fcience, as fcarcely 
to merit notice or reply. Yet, unhappily, it influences^ the 
pra£Uce of half the parents in Scotland, who compel their 
children to acquire even the knowledge of orthograj^hy and 
fyotax through the medium of an apprenticeihip for two or 
three years to the ftudy of .Latin. With equat propriety 
they might begin to teach them hornpipes as foon as they 
are Hit of leading ftrings, or endeavour to make them fing 
fliat they might learn to fpeak. 

From fuch an inftilution as the foregoing, properly con- 
du£)iQd'i what fakitary, what glorious cotifequences might we 
not expe£^ ? What an increafc of curioiity, of aftivity, of 
iaformatioo, of wifdom, of probity, of liberal fentiment, and

tknes leares not much room to expeA redrefs from tais quar^

that the heritors will of themfelvcs bring forward fuch a mea^

us for a moment to fuppo{e that it would be carried with- 
out their unanimous concurrence, much lefi in oppoiition to 
their declared fentiments. 

Neither can the prefcnt junAure be deemed the moft pro- 
pitious for addreffing the legiflature on any topic of reforma-» 
tion. The national grievances which have lately folicited at- 
tention, are numerous, and in quick (iicceflion. Of thefe, 
fome are fo frivolous as not to require feriocs invegiftation \ 
and fome fo incumbered with difficulties, as not to be eafily 
capable of redrefi. Among the national improvements alfo, 
which reformers have been emulous tp projcd, many are fo 
Tifionaiy and problematical, as not to warrant the hazard of 
an attempt, and many fo trifling and. local, as not to compen- 
fete for the trouble of execution. But, independent of their 
infignificance or internal &amp;llacy, the authors have generally 
defieated their own defigns by the mode of application, which 
they have thought proper to adopt. SufpeAing^ perhaps, 
that their fchemes would be fufFered to flumber in negledt, 
,^and enraged to find thofe; fufpicions daily realized, they 
came forward in a body, determined as it were to overpower 
government by their importunity and number, and to exhaufl 
its patience, if they could not convince its rcafon. Addrefles 
and remonftrances were multiplied with rapidity, appeals 
3mt made to the people, and the nation was loudly called 
wpon to attend to its interefts, and to vindicate its rights. 
The nation, however, repofed more confidence in the wiC- 
dom of its legiflation, which had been tried by experience, 
fhan in the pretenfions of the new projeftors, to which expe- 
rience threatened to be the moft formidable foe; and by.ii-

Mortified by difappointment, theje gentlemen now cob« 
fider it as vain to addreis the legiflatm^ on any fabjefi, or 
in any form. WearineTs and difguft, fay they, have ftop 
peil the cars, and fteeled the hearts, of the rulers of the land. 
Petitions, recommended Ijy the importance of the matter, 
enforced by energy of compofltion, and fupported by digni^ 
of fignatures, have been prefented, and difregarded« What 
reception then can be cxpefted, where the petitiouers and 
the fubje^ am equally unlcnown ? Truth there no doubt

* Since the commencement of the prcfent political fermest, there has been 
ie much fufpicion on the one fide, and fo much smbiguous dcHgn on the other, 
that it feems very proper, nay, almoft incumbent, on every man, when he hn 
occafion to mention the fubjed, to declare his fentimcnti in £uch a manner ai 
that they may not be mifundcrftood. The prcTcnt malcontenu of Britain may 
be divided into two great cbfTes. Of thcTe, the firft clafs, equally rcfpedablir 
for their abilities and inoffenfive deportment, are no upftart pctitionert at the 
bar of juftice. Their complaints have long been before the public ; and though 
zealous in their attempts to obtain redrefs, they have not overleaped the bounds 
fyi temperance. In the recent commotions, it has been their misfortune to be 
confounded with the other party, and thus involved in unmerited difgraoe, on 
account of tenets and deiigns, which it is probable they never either encourag- 
ed or avowed.

are generally * men of weak heads^ bad hearts, or ruined fortunes.* Neither

nuni) I moft heartily agree, that ihttead of checks, every pot 
fible fpur ou{^ to be applied to their induftry; but from the 
opinioD that their prefent futtances anfwer the latter purpofe, 
I feel myielf obliged to diilent, as I think it it founded in a 
sniftaken notion of human natmv. All eipertion is prompted 
by the hope of att:uning ibme abicnt good. We arc| ecpiaUy 
inadive when the attempt s^ipeart unneceflary, and when it 
appears impraAicable. Defpair no left efitAoally than pot 
feiiion prevents every endeavour. In this light» fmall fabrics 
Are at leaft as ipjnrioas as large \ aoid if we alkw any virtue 
or honeft principle in the human breaftj the one extreme 
muft be fraught with more danger than the other. If then 
it is clear from experience, that the gteatei^ number of £cho- 
lars, which abilities and attention can poffibly aflemUe, are 
infufficient to fumifh a decent and comfortable fubfiftence 
for the teacher ; is it net likely that a happy medium of fa« 
lary, rendering this prafticabie, and perhaps not difficult, 
would call forth mpre fpirited exertions^ and more unremit* 
ting diligence ? 

Another dafs of men are unfrriendly to the augment;ation, 
for reafons very different fit)m the preceding, not becaufe it 
would retard, but fricilitate the progrefi of learnings an event 
which they deprecate as very pernicious to the lower clailes 
of mankind. They talk much of the pride of fdence, and 
that ' little learning is a dangerous thing.' With this, they 
aflbciate the idea of the pe^le addiAing themfelves to vain 
fpeculations^ of neglecting their hmn^ble and ufeful en^oy« 
^ent, of becoming difcontented with their condition, and of 
ruining themfelves by viiionary projefia. But, on this prin- 
ciple, the immediate abolition of fchoob, and the total ex- 
tinction of knowledge, would be the moft proper and meri- 
torious meafure that could.be employed. Andf if we could 
indeed by auy means reftorc the luppinefs of priq^eval ages^

He fuppoles (p. 354) the falaries to be moderate, ancl

fubfiflence for a familj. Here he ingenioufly ' puts a cafe/ 
and reafons upon it \ although (p. 262) he allows the faS to 
be, that the emoluments arc ' fo extremely infignificanti as 

* to preclude all hope o^ procuring a comfortable fiihCftencc

He propo(es (p. 253) to confider, * whether an augmenta* 
' tion (meaning undoubtedly anj degree of augmentation that 
' may be judged proper) could prombte the caufe of litera-

the cafep, that the ' falary Aiouki \)cfi much augmentedi as to 

* enable the fchoolmsifter to live better without teaching at 
.' all, than he does now with it/ 

Thefe two iuppofitions are no doilbt Tcry convenient fbr 
the conclufion, which he wiffaes to Jraw, namely, that the 
prefent ftlariesare necefiarily beft calculated to excite the iff- 
.^uftry of fchoolmafters : but it certainly is not very decent 
to fuppoie, either that the legiflature at jMrelent would adqit 
the very extreme of augmentation, or that the paiiiameat of 
.William and Mary appointed falaries then fo enormous as to 
be fufficicnt even in thefe days of expeoice and extranragance.

from attaining any acqairements, which might enable them 
to rile above their fomer rankf or, as he is pleafed to ex- 
preis it, which ^ tends to derange that dne fubordinatioii 
* which ought ever to prevail in civil ibciety.* 

He talks (pp. 257 &amp; 260) of the * induftrious part of the 
' community being loaded with a heavy burden/ and of 
^ a great body of the people being deprived of a confideraUe 
^ part of their property,' at the lame time that, by his own 
plan, fae wifhes-to lay all the additional load on the moft in- 
duftrious, and leaft fubftantial, members of (bciety. 

He feems (p. 256) much afraid of the introdfi^on of 
teaching by deputies, for an allowance £iir Ihort of the prcr 
fcnt falaries; while, according to his avowed principles, the 
WOTk muft be better done in proportion to the fmallnefs of 
the wages, as the affiftant * will naturally be induced tq ex- 

* ert himfelf as much as poffible to obtain icbolars, that his 
' prefling wants may thus be fupplied.' 

The liberality of this gentleman's fentiments, and his high 
opinion of human nature, are confpicuous, when he Tays^ 
that ^ where the falaries are high, the profeflbrs arc indo- 

* lent,' and that ^ the fame care that is now beftowed for a

Scotland, or North Britain, ftruggles tvith many natural 
difadvantagesi the climate is cold, the fky feldom ferene, 
the weather variable, the foil unfruitful, the mountains 
bleak, Ijarren, rocky, often covered with fnows, and the ap- 
pearance of the country in many plftces very forbidding to 
Grangers *, yet, by an early attention to the education of 
youth, to form good men and good citizens, (he has uni- 
formly maintained a high character among the nations, has 
always been deemed an exc^^ept ntjrfe of the human fpecies, 
and has furniihed, not foldiers only, but divines, generals, 
fiatefmen, and philofo{bcrs, to. alnloft every nation of Eu- 
rope. 

Our anceftors, towards the end of the laft irentury, turn- 
ing their attention to this fubje£t, beheld with pleafure the 
progrefs already made in ufeful knowledge and jarts. They 
faw that the laws of nattire and religion required of parents 
the virtuous education of their offspring ; but they faw alfo 
that the increafing cares and avocations of civil life, together 
with th^ ignorance of many parents, rendered it neceffary to 
eall to their afliftanoe a body of men appointed by the fbte 
to attend upon this one thing. 

The Ichoolmafters, thus legally eftabliihed, were fuppofcd 
to be men who had turned their attention to the improve- 
ment of their minds, to the dignity, virtue, and happinefs of 
human nature^ to the difiindlons between right and wrong 
in human conduA ; and who were, beiides, * apt to teach,' 
patient, diligent, and faithful. 

The encouragement appointed by the ftate for this refpec- 
table and ufeful body of men, though not great, was yet 
well fuited to. the times, the funds, and diftin^ion of rank

Lours in the dayi or a few days in the year, fupports himfelf

How valuable then is the (ludy of the arts i Indeed^ with- 
out exerting our mental faculties in the difcoverir of what 
is vieful^ we muft remain like the rude Indian^ ignorantf 
wretched^ and folitary* But the productions of art difplaf 
the fields clothed with verdare, and fweUing with grainy the 
ocean is covered with fhips \ fplendid cities arife $ the coun- 
try is adorned with all the accommodation which the haC* 
bandman .can require } and the folitary fbrefi is filled wkk 
gladnefs. 

It is evident from experience, that nothing contribtxtes 
more to the improvement of the arts than the divifion of la« 
bour. But this difcovery has unfolded an article of expence» 
namely, the carriage of commodities. If a man, by his owa 
labour, produce the neceilaries of life, he faves importationis 
from his neighbours and exportations in return* In fhort^ 
he lives within himfelf, and knows neither barter nor com* 
merce. But the divifion of labour has fhown that in this 
fiate he can command none of the luxuries of life, and is 
often expofed to a deficiency of its necefiaries. When an 
individual, therefore, betakes himfelf to one occupation, and 
perhaps to one branch of that occupation, he fells the pro- 
duce of his labour for a piece of money wherewith he buys 
all the other necefiaries and luxuries of life from the difiTe^ 
rent markets^ Hence the neceflity of the carriage of com- 
modities. 

The carriage of commodities being produced by the divi- 
fion of labour, muft increafe with it, and become an obje&amp; of 
importance ; and, as It is plain that a confiderable portion cf 
the labour of individusds muft be occupied in the carriage of 
commodities, whatever invention tends to diminifh that Ur 
bour, may be ranked among the ufeful arts. 

In rude ages, rivers, lakes, and every large body of water, 
would be confidered an obftni^tion to carriage; and the

osean, it may be fuppofed, would form a cotnplrte barrier ; 
ba: when navigation was diltovcrcd, what before was confid-* 
cred a cUfjdvantagCi would then: appear the greateft benefit. 
As the difcovcry of z^ general principle ufualiy unfolds a va- 
riety of fixbordinatc caufcs and cflfe&amp;, fo the Talue of rivers, 
lakes, and bodies of water, in leflening the expence ef land 
carriage, fuggefted the idea of navigable canals in thofe inlaojd 
diftri^h where the navigaWe rivers did not extend ; and the 
fltmc principle would evince the advantages and difadvan^ 
trrges of tach gradation, and Ihcw the method of improving 
en the difcoveries firft made* 

Navigable canals have many peculiar advantages. They are- 
not fubjecl to ftorms and tempefts like the ocean, nor to the 
cbbings and Sowings of the waters, which the mariner muft 
await in creeks and arms of the iea, nor to the fwclling and 
litbfiding of rivers ; and they can be conftruftcd deep or 
Ihallow, wide or narrow, long or ftiort, to anfwer any pur- 
pofc. Their only enemy is froft ; but this impediment is on* 
ly for a fliort* part of the (eafon \ and navigators have now 
difcovercd a rticthod of cutting the ice, and letting the veficl 
pafs, Tlie general advantage of navigable canals being tbca 
famanifeft, let us apply the cafe to Scotland, and in particnlai^ 
to the dlftricl under confideration. 

Scotland is an agreeable as well as healthful country. Tho^ 
in general the foil is barren, yet there are many fruitful val-» 
leys, and even the more nigged parts, in an agricultural view, • 
arc capable of great imix-ovements, and may be converted to 
many ufeful purpofes. But Scotland's greateft advantages are 
ef a commercial nature \ and, in this view, her agricultural 
difadvantages become of the very laft importance. Her bar* 
ten mountains produce a multitude of water ftreams for turn- 
ing all kinds of machinery ; her barren mountains furnifh 
wood, ftone and other materials for buildings of evSry de-^ 

fcri^tion ; 



The Statiftical AccoUnt. 34^ 

Kiiption ; and thefe mountains divide the country into vaU 
leys or pafles that can be eaiily fortified againft an enemy % 
and thus, while the hills of Scotia are the parents of fo many 
benefits they ovei^look our foes with contempt. 

The naTigation of the Forth and Teith, then, miift be of 
infinite beneik in a national view, as a part of that general 
plan which ought to be adopted over the whole kingdom i 
namely, of extending inland naTigation, But let us confidef 
the local fituation of this diftriA^ The river Forth runt 
through a fine level country, of rich deep clay, about 27 
miles long, and 3 broad. The Teith unites with Forth about 
3 miles frdm tiie town of Down, to which a canal could be 
cafily caty or the river made navigable. From Down to Rik 
fiiahog, (a mile beyond Callander), a diftance of 9 miles, the 
river has a cohfideraUe fsdl, tehich would increafe the ex- 
pence of navigattoh ; but this part of the river being very ' 
eligible for watet machinery, the advantage would loon re- 
pay the coft. 

TTie beautiful countries aiong the banks of thefe two ^vers 
form one grand bafon, furrounded with ftupendous rocks and 
mountains, comprehending the parifhes of Stirling, Gargnn- 
jiock, Kipped, Aberfoil, Port of Monteith, Callander, KiP 
madock, and Lecropt ; and alio part of Dumbiane, Logie, 
St. Ninians, Balfron, Buchante, Drymen, dnd Killearn. The 
bhabitants of this large diftrift of the kingdom, as well as 
the whole parifh of BalquhMder, afid a great way to the 
north of that, bring their coal and lime from Bannockburtz 
and Its neighbourhood, by land carriage. The rirft of moun- 
tains furrounding this country ftops all communication with 
the neighbouring diftriAs, except at a few places. ^ITie line 
of roads, therefore, runs eaft and weft -, and all commodities 
imported or exported, muft be conveyed in the fame direc-

tion with the rivers Forth and Teith : and hence the adtatf* 
tage of making thefe rivers navigable. 

The principal commodities required for agriculture and 
dpmeftic confumpt in the diftrids defcribed^ are pit-coal and 
lime. The country to the eaft of Stirling produces cod and 
limeftone in great abundance at many places; but no coal 
has been difcovered weft from Bannockbum. Limeftone is 
pnoduced from the quarries of Aberfoil, about a mile weft 
from the bridge of Gartmore^ and from the quarries at Le* 
ny, a mite beyond Callander ; but the carriage of coal to bora 
the limeftone is nearly equal to that of the lime (hells whea 
bumti ib that the limeftone here without coal is of little be- 
nefit.^ 

Many attempts have been made td get a canal along the 
Forth» or the river made navigable to Gartmore. It was odcs 
tried to bring the great canal that now unites the Forth and 
Clyde roand by Stirling and Gartmore v but that meafore 
failing, the gentlemen interefted ft^m to have loft fpiriti 
.which ftiews that they had not viewed the matter in its true 
light. In the year I774» a very accurate fturey was made of 
the river Forth, and of the fmaller rivers Devon and Goodie 
that run into it \ and an eftimate of making theie riven na- 
vigable, was drawn up^ and reported to a very reijpedable 
meeting of the noblemen and gentlemen of the counties 
of Stirling, Perth, and Qackmanan, on the 13th January 
1774, and who voted feveral refolotions thereon; a copf 
whereof is annexed. The matter feems however to have 
dropt after this, which proves evidently haw fuperficially the 
plan had been viewed by the people in generaL Some men 
cannot fubmit to the fatigue of enquiry and calculation ; the 
time of others is occupied by purfuits of a. diflKrent nature^ 
and fome doubt every thing that bears the charafber of no- 
veity^ and on fuch topics will diftredit even their own calcu-

lations. It is certamly highly prudei^ to weigh well a fub- 
jeA of fuch impoitance9 which cannot be comprehended at 
once» which eiQbraciBS a great variety of circumftanccs and 
for the moft part pcMnts to futurity for the return of the pre- 
ient outlay. 

It k already mentioned, that the two great commodities 
wanted are coal and lime. The diftance from Gartmore' to 
, Stirling by the high road is 20 miles ; and from Stirling to 
the coal and lime works ufually frequented, the average di&amp; 
tance may be reckoned a miles; in all 22 miles to the. peo- 
ple of Gavtmore. The diftai^e from Kilmahog to Stirling is 
17 mile^, beiides the above 2 miles, making the }and carriage 
19 miles to the people of Ealmahog. To the inhabitants of 
Aberfoil, the upper parts of Callander, and of the pariih of 
Balquhidder, the diftance to coal is upwards of 30 miles ; 
yet thefe people come fo far as Bannockbum for fiiel ; and 
even the people of Killin pariih, and other parts of the 
Highlands, ftill more remote, travel the fame road for coals 
to their lairds, while they themfelves have to toil in cafting 
snd preparing peats \ and after all their labour, are literally 
tio better ferved than the rude natives of North America- 
Inland navigation would at once cure the evil. The fol- 
lowing ftate will ihew the" extent of the arable land in the 
parifhes defcribed requiring lime, and the number of families 
le^iiaring coal*

By this table, It app^rs that the traft of countrj under

As part of the inhabitants of KiUearn, Balfron, Drymen, and 
Buchanan, may be fupplitd witlx coal from Campfie and Kil- 
patrick, (though the carriage from thefe places be upwards of 
10 miles), we fliall difoount, off the extent of thefe pariflics, 
453 families, and 16140 acres; the remainder. is 5928 femi. 
Hes, and 76273 acres •, and thpt wc may not ftretch the cal- 
culation too far, we will allow a tenth part of the arable land 
for roads, houfes, and water trafts, being 7627 acres, which 
leaves 68646 acres arable; one half whei:eof n^ay be reckon- 
ed carfe clay, and ftrong foil, requiring 6 chalders or 4t tons 
Ume fticUs per acre, every feventh year, or a fixth part to be 
lwe4 at this rate annually. The other half being light diy 



The Stattjikal Accouni. 54ji 

£cld, will only require to be limed at the half of the above 
rate, being 3 chalders, or 2^^ tons lime (hells to each acre. 

The navigation «f the Forth could not be carried farther 
than Gartmore, nor of the Tcith farther than Kilmahog, fo 
we fliall reckon the land carriage along the riyer to thcfe 
points to be 9 miles^ as a medium for the whole extent ; for 
which fpixe, the land carriage of a ton of lime, Ihellsj or 
coals, will cod at leaft los. 

It is impoffible to afcertain cxaftly the quantity of coal the 
obove families will con fume. But we (hall fuppofe an ordi* 
nary farmer's confumpt to be a ftandard for the whole. Now, 
an ordinary farmer, if he burn nothing elfe than coal, can- 
not be allowed lefs than 20 carts annually; of which, the 
carriage by land, including the prime coft on the hill, will be 
9s. per cart, in all 9I. ilerling annually. 

It may be faid that a great number of the families will 
oianufafture peats, and thus fave the expence of coal. Now 
let us fubmit this alternative to the tcft of calculation. The 
collciftor of thefe reports was at the pains to qucftion a far- 
mer in the parifh of KilmaJock on this fubjcft. He kept 
one fire in his kitchen through the whole year, and another 
fire for about fix months of the year j and thefe fires were 
fupplied by peats from his own mofs, and ccals from Ban- 
tockbum or Auchinbowie. He confumed annually 3 carti 
of coals, and employed 2 men and 4 women for a month, 
^nually, in manufadluring peats, and 4 horles and carts for 
-2 we^s.*

N, B. The diftancc by water from- Lord Elgin's lime fcilns^ 
to the fhore of Stirling, is 46 miles. A fmalL boat carrying 
104 carts or 30 tons of lime ihells, is freighted at iL 19s. 
befides about 4s. for lading anchorage and ihore dues, which 
does not come to rVths of a penny per ton per mile. But at 
the freight for a fliort diftance would be a higher rate, we 
liave allowed 4d. to cover all circumftances. The 30 tons of 
lime (hells though only 2L 3s. by water, would be at leaft 
76I. fterling of carriage by land. 

From this comparative view of hnd and water carriage^ 
the difierence appears almoft incrediUe ; yet the calculations 
are founded on fa£t and .experience, and it is believed beSow 
the ftandaid. In whatever view we take the fnbjeA, there 
cannot be the leaft argument for delaying the fcheme of op- 
ening the navigation of the rivers in queftion a fingle mo- 
ment. The aniiual favinfg would maintain 4525 inhabitants, 
at the rate of loL each perfbn, young and old. 

If an accurate furvey of the diAri£b in queftion were made, 
the exaA quantity of coal and lime required could be known, 
and at fame time the expence of land carriage of thefe tv^o 
commodities from all the difierent places where they are pre- 
fently found ; and at fame time the exad coft of opening wl^ 
ter communication to thofe difierent places could be known, 
and the ^tlemen interefbd would be enabled to judge 
with accuracy the objeSs of improvement. 

Limeflone is procured in the greateft abundance at Lord 
Elgin's craigs, on the cOaft of Fife. It is alfo produced at 
Sauchie and Munrayshall, in the pariih of St. Ninian's, and 
at Aberfoil and Leny. 

Coal is produced on the banks of the river Devon, bc^ 
tween Cobble*Crook and RackmLll, and at Bannockbum and 
Auchinbowiej and the country in general on the fouth fide 
of the Forth,, from Stirling to Carron feems to abound with

pic-coal) which is wrought and produced at many ptace^ iii 
great abundance : but no coal has ever been difcovered on 
the banks oi the Forth or Tcith beyond Stirling. 

From the fituation of the various places where coal and 
Ume are produced, communication by water can be very ea- 
fily opened, and in many places at little or no expence ; to 
the coal of Devon, by the tide-way of the Forth and the ri- 
irer Devon ; to the lime craigs of I^ord Elgin, by the tide- 
way and Frith of Forth •, to .the various coal works between 
Stirling and Carron, by navigable canals from the river Forth} 
and to the lime craigs of Aberfoil and Leny^ by the naviga- 
tion of the rivers Fortli and Tcitlu 

This unfolds a very wide field for enquiry ; sind to atcer* 
tain the cheapeft and moft profitable plan of improvement 
wou\d be very difficult, though a little time and expenccf 
would infallibly accomplish the objeA* In any view, the ad-* 
vantage of water communication would be great ; and the 
only point of enquiry is, which of the-wh^e plans that can 
be formed would be the moft valuable^ 

In the annexed copy of the procedure in 1774, relative to 
the navigation of the Forth, Devon,- and Goodie, a tery ac- 
curate defcription of thefe rivers is given. For making the 
Forth navigable above the tide-way, it appears 5,8331. iterl. 
would have been requifite at that time, befide the value of 
19 acres of land, joccupied by cuts, &amp;c. which may be valued 
at jol. per acre, as the half of it would not be needed in 
perpetuity : fo, had the plan fucceeded in 1774, the whole 
of the Forth navigation to Gartmore would only hstvc coft 
6,403!. fterling. The navigation of the Devon, including 
icvcral cuts, would have coft - .L. 7,10^7 13 6

From thefe eflimates it appears, the coft of the Devon 
navigation was the chief article, and verjr likely ftmck a fa«* 
tal blow againft the meafure. In attempting any new plan 
of improvement, the very cheapeft and fimpleft mode ought 
to be firft adopted, leaving the more complex and expenfive 
to experience* The Devon navigation feems to have been ft 
£ivoarite objeft in 1774 ; and yet the only benefit to be de- 
rived is the carriage of coal, and that, too, only with the 
contraAed view of lowering the price of coal at other places. 
There feems no folid reafon for incurring fo much expence 
to obtain an objeft of fuch a trifling nature. 

We muft keep in view the two grand commodities requi- 
red to the coontiies along the Forth and Teith, viz. coal and 
lime : and iurely, if thefe articles can be procured nearer 
than Rackmill or CobUe-Crook, or the lime craigs of Lorcl 
Elgin, we ihould embrace the cheapeft. 

We then find that coal can 4e procured at Bannockbum 
and Aachinbowie, and lime at Sauchie and Murrayshall. A 
finall canal could be very eafily cut from the Forth at Baad, 
near Craigfbrth, to within half a mile of the lime works at 
Murrayshall, and two miles of the coal works of Bannock- 
bom, to which laft works the canal could be extended by 
one or two locks. The gre'ateft (betch of this canal would 
not exceed three miles : and it is to be remembered, that the 
Forth above the Baad is naturally navigable ; and as the works 
at Craigforth, mentioned in the eftimate of 1774, lie below 
the Baad, and would have coft 403 3!. this fum would nearly 
complete the propofed canal from Baad to Bannockbum. 
From the eftimates in 1774, it -appears, that no more than 
a37ol. would be necelTary for making the Forth navigable 
from Baad to Gartmore. 

Putting, then, the Devon navigation out of the queftion ; 

the prefcnt object is, whether' it would be cheapeft to bring

coal and lime by the tide-way of the Forth on the plan of 
.1774, or from Bannockbumand Murraphall by a new c»- 
nal to the Forth at Baad. It is plain that the canal to Baft- 
fiockburn would be more expenfive than the works at Craig* 
forth : but, in {dace of 3 miks of water carriage bom Baad to 
Bannockbum, you would have at leaft 49 miles of water car* 
riage from Baad to Lord Elg^'s lime kilns, and near 30 miks 
of water carriage to the coalwQirks on the Devoo^ beyond 
Jlackmill. 

The navigation of the lekh would be much more expen- 
five than the Fo^h, becaufe the river has a greater faiL 
From the tido-way of the Forth or from the jun£tion of the 
two rivers, to Down, a fpace oi 3 miles, one lock might be 
iufficient^ as the river has no confiderable fall along this 
Aretch« From the eftknates in 1774 of the Devon naviga^ 
tion, we think the canal to Down would not have coft much 
more than 4ood. fterling 2I that period. Between Down 
and Callander, a (faretch of 8 miles, would be very diffiodt 
and expenfive, the banks of the river being rocky in many 
places. The fidl of the river is, however, pretty gradual ; 
and it is thought that, by clearing the bed, it might be rcn* 
dered £t Ux fmall drag-boats. The Mily impediment to this 
plan is the rugged banks, which the (bream, in time of £kKid% 
has rendered inacceilible in many places ; and it would require 
tery flrong embankments to defend a tewing path. 

Thefe difficulties, though great, fhould not however pct^ 
vent an accurate furvey and calculation. It b proper to keep 
in view the value of this river : fuch a fine body of water, 
capable of moving the largeft machinery for the fpace of la 
miles, b an objeA not to be met wkh everywhere* It b in 
the centre of the kingdom, and immediate neighbourhood of

If the leflening of land carriage occupied fo much of the 
^ttentMHi of the puUic in I774 it ought much more fo the . 
attention of the people of the prefent time. The extraordi- 
nary ixQprovements in agriculture, and the increafe of Scotch 
manula^hires fince 17741 muft now render land carriage an 
important article. The aftonifliing rife of land rents, the 
improvement of the highways, the elegance of buildings^ 
^d the general appearvice of the country, are fufficient 
proof of our increafed profperity and wealth. But this al** 
teratioo mnOi have -naturally increafed the expence of land 
.carr^ge ; and were navigation extended, the effi:^ would be 
at once obvious. 

A maoaufafbirer will never think of ereAing extenflve 
works in a diftriijk where land carriage is fe expenfive and 
eoals fo firarce.. Betwixt Callander and Locblubnaig, mills

20 carts of coab, or 60|00d tons, which would 00ft, for 24

If fuch a faving would arife on the article coal ; hdw mock 
would be the profit on all the other commodities that fiich 
works would require. It commonly happens, that where wt 
meet with rapid rivers and water-feUs, the country is pooT) 
»nd produces very little of the neoeflaries of life* It is ft 
with the banks of the Teith above Callander $ the country 
is rugged and barren ; and were any Works to be eroded 
there, the importations for the fnbfiftence of the workmen 
would be very great, and the land carriage would render liT» 
sng too expenfive. In ihort, were any to attempt mannfac* 
tories on this river, during exifting circumftaBces he muft 
want workmen s as no perfon would pay the high price of 
provifions which the inland fituation of the difbiCt wooM 
create, while he could get work, and be ierved betteri at 
other places. 

But, were the river Teith made navigable, this part of thi 
country would very foon become fiourifhing and wealthy, ft 
would Jiave immediate communication with the rich countiy 
along the Forth, and with the London mart:et \ and the low

An account rfthifibeme far navioatij^g tbf rivers 
Forth and Devon. 



X HE river Forth, in i^ courfe fixm Gartmore to AQoas % 
diftance of 27 miles, meafured in a ftraight line, runs wholly 
in a level plain of a .deep clay foil. This extent oi, the river 
is naturally divided into two diflri^:, the upper Forth, or 
the frcfh-watcr river, which is higher than the rife of (pring- 
tides ; and the lower Forth, or the tideway. 

The part of the upper Forth, which may moft eafily be 
made nayigable, commences near Gbrtmore^ and is fepara- 
ted from the lower Forth by a ^11 oyer a rock at Crai^forth 
dam, where it ends, and the tide- way commences. It mea« 
fures about twenty 20 miles in a ftraight line, and 3^ by 
windings of its channel, which is extremely crooked. 

The upper Forth has a narrow channel, with fteep floping 
banks. The furface of the water ^ generally 20 feet under 
the furface of the ground, and the river is moftly deep } 
there being great diftri^ of it that have always 8 or 10 feet 
water : but thefe are fcparated by fhallows, ibme of which 
have not more than 2 feet water in the fummer time. 

Thq 



%^ . General J^pen£x to 

' The river mns.exceedbgly gently; and, except at tfam 
|)Iaces» it has no very fenfible declivity of furface. Tlic 
lowermoft of thefe is the fall over the rock at Craigfoith 
dam ; where the furface of the river is 8 feet above the neap 
tjdesy and 4 feet and a half above fpring«tides high water. 

The iecond Aream is at the ford of Frewy which» mei^ 
fiuing by the wiadings of theriver, is t8 miles diftant from 
Craigfoith dam. The declivity of the furface is aboot 3 httf 
and. the length of the Aream about aoc yards. Thefud 
appears to be wholly compofed oif gravd, brought thither 
principally by the bum of Bolquhan, which enters therCj and 
|s the only f^r^m that brings mu^ji gravel to Forth* 

The third ffaream is at Cardrofs. It 19 about 7 miles above 
the Frew ; and is about a mile in length, running partly 
upon a rock, and partly upon a gravel bottom. The' per- 
pendicular fall here is about 8 feet and a half when the ri- 
Ver is low, and does not e;Kcc^d 6 feet lyhen there is any. 

From Cardroi^, to a ftream below the hridge of Gait- 
more, I know of no impediment to the navi|;ation, except 
fbme few parts of the river that is rather ihaljow. The 
jbeam below the bridge is about a mile long i and has a ie« 
divity of furSice of 5 feet in that fpace, above which there 
is half a mile of deep and dead water. 

The liver Goodie enters the Forth about 3 miles below 
|he Frew. It rifes from the loch qf Monteith, about a mUf 
If. W. from Cardroft, aud runs nearly parallel to Forth. It 
is a fmall river, but, running through foft ground, has made 
its channel very deep. It is naturally navigable for the fpac^ 
of 4 miles from the Forth, to a mill about a quarter of a 
mile from Thomhill, where there is a fall of a few feet from 
that mill upwards to the miU of Cardrofs. It is alfo naviga- 
|le for a cot of nearly 4 miles in len^, made for the miipof^

of drainage* Sp that the only impediment to naYigation, is 
l!he mill dam bdow ThornhiU, and a finall natvral £dl in tli^ 
liver, at that phce where it is thought that the bottom is 
foft : and the rife could eafily be lowered, and the cut above 
it deqmedti)7 flnxces. 

The tideway of the Fortli commences at Craigfbrth dan% 
which is a6 miles difiaat from Alloa by the river, and 7 miles 
in a ftraight line. 

b is exceffivdy crooked ; and its greatcft bendings lie near 
iStirling, where its channel is narrow, when compared witk 
shat which it occupies at Alloa. It has feveral lords in it 
above Manor, which do not permit veflels drawing 5 feet 
watefr to pafs over them in ncxp tides. The tides are thre« 
hours later at Craigforth dam than at Alloa ^ and the jport 
at Manor is the higheft acceffiUe at all tides for veflels draw- 
ing 9 feet water. That port lies above two great turns of 
the river; and vefleb may be often hfaidred from coming to 
it by contrary winds and freihes. The port of Cambus lies 
3^ miles farther down, and below the moft confideraUe of 
thefe turns) and the Forth is wider and deeper there, h. 
Ues in the mouth of the river Devon \ is 3^ miles from Al- 
loa.; and hstt in the harbour 9 feet water in low neap tides, 
and. 13 feet and a half in Spring tides. The bottom at the 
^uay is compofed of loofe ftones, and may be eafily made a 
foot or two deeper, as it rifes more than that height above 
the low waters in the Fortli oj^fite to it The bottom of 
Devon, above the quay of Cambus, is compofed of {helving 
rocks, not difficult to quarry ; the ftones of which may be 
ufeftil for building fuch works as are wanted there. 

The river Devon is fmaller than the upper Forth, and hr*^ 

ger than the Goodie. It comes from the eaft, and runs for 

snany miles through a fine valley, where it has a crooked 

channel; and the fififace of the water is not far below that 
\ ' pf 



3So Genera f Jfpendix to 

of its talks; part of it from Menfiry dam to Saudbie^ a fpacc 
of three miles by the river^ is dead water, except at two pla- 
ces, of no great extent, the Wefthaugh and Coble Crook 
fords, which together harve a.fall of about 3 fieet that may be 
removed, and this part of the river made the dunncl of na;- 
tigation. 

Menfiry dam is fituated a mile and three quarters above 
the quay of Cambus, and about the fame diftance from the 
port of Manor. The ibr&amp;ce of the water is T74 feet, above 
tieap tides, and 14 ficet above fpring tides, high water. The 
channel of the Devon from this dam to Cambus is perplexed 
with dams and fhallow places where the bottom is rock. 

Above Saochie, the channel of Devon is unfit for naviga- 
tion,, being obftru£led by gravel fords brought in by the rv- 
. vers, but a canal can be cut on the fbuth fide of it from SaiH 
chie to the Rack«mill, a fpaoe of four luiiles. Twenty*throe 
feet of lockage are reqizired to raife this ftretch of the canal 
to the level of the furface of the Devon near the Rack-mill, 
but at leaf): three feet more will be necefiary to carry it over 
the intermediate grounds. 

Hie commodities principally wanted in the extenfive coon- 
tries upon the upper Forth, are lime and pit-coal. The con* 
iumption of both thefe articles is very gi^at, and would be 
much greater were th^ expence of carriage lower. They 
could mofl: readily be fupplied with the coal from thcicxten* 
five feams of that mineral which ly upon the Devon, from 
the Coble Crook to the Rack-mill ; many of which are leveL- 
£nee, but at prefent they can have no^ communication with 
thefe coallieries but by land carriage, and muft' fupjdy them* 
felves at a higher rate either at Bannockbum or at Stirling 
ihore, to the laft of which, coals are brought by the tideway 
firom Alloa, and the coallaries fituated farther down the 
Forth where they muft be wrought at the exponr prices* 

Lime 



Tie Statijiical Accomi. 961 

Lime b (upplied from Lord Elgin's lime works upon the 
Forth, and fixwn the Abeifoil quarries, abcf^t a mile weft 
from the bridge of Gartmore. In the firft place, it is brought 
to Stirling by water carriage/ and tranfported by land to the 
countries that want it. The Aberfoil lime is carried only by 
land; &amp;nd as the coals with which it is burnt are alfo brought 
by a long land carriage, it is fold at a high price, but is of a 
fuperior quality to the other. 

Were the upper Forth and Devon made navigable, and a 
cocnmimication made between them by a canal, or by the 
tide-way, ihofe coimtries would be mutually benefited ; the 
one by the fale of their coals, the other by obtaining them at 
a lower rate than they do at prefcnt. Both the countries upon 
the upper Forth and upon the Devon could be fupplied with 
lime from the tide-way; and the people upon the Forth 
would have their choice of taking either that or the Aberfoil 
lime, which could be afforded dieaper were the prices of 
coals lower. 

In my report to the Right Honourable the I^rds Com- 
miffioners of Police in December 1773, ^ '^^^^ propofcd fc- 
vcral plans of navigation and junftion of thefe two rivers. 
That report has been laid before the public, and has been the 
fubjeft of two meetings of the nobiemeU'and gentlemen in- 
terefled. At the laft of thefe, upon the 2d inibant, certain 
p^rts of the plan were adopted, and fome additions made, 
of wliich I am now to give an account. 

The calculations of the expence of navigating the upper 
Forth were made upon the fuppofition, tliat the difti-ift be- 
tween it and Craigforth dam is deep water; I am now inform- 
that there are feveral fords in that diftri^ and in the tide- 
way betwixt Kildean and the dam. If this be the cafe, the 
expence of removing thefe fords will be found to be confi- 
derablci It may be eligible to lock up at Kildeati^and to

cut a canal one mile in length from thence to the mer above 
Craigannet, at a place called the Baad. lUs cut will fhorten 
the navigation two miles and a half, and will avoid the mod 
perplexed parts of the river; but will be expeniiTe, as tfaf 
cutting muft be deqy and the ground is valuable. I have 
flated the e:(pence of this work in the eftimates preferable to 
the other. It being proper,^ until accurate fiirveys zspc made, 
to reckon upon the greateft expence. . 

If this cut be made, a dam muft be erected at CraiganBeti 
near the upper end of Craigforth rock, where the river has 
a rocky bottom, and ftones lye at hand. The height of ths 
dam may be fomr feet, which will raife the furface of the up* 
per Forth to twelve feet above neap tides high water, will 
fuperfede all dredging below the Frew ford, and probably will 
give a fufficiency of water in the Gppdie to near the Thom- 
hlll mill. 

Another dam of five feet fall may be creSed at the Frew, 
which, without dredging, will navigate the river to Caxdrofs^ 
and will give dead water near to the top of the ford there. 

A third lock and dam of five feet fall, ereAed at Cardrofs, 
will give a fufiiciency of water near to the bridge of Gart- 
more ; and whenever there is a frefh in the river, boats will 
eafily pafs the ftream into the dead water above the bridge.' 

If the cut from Kildean to Baad is laid afide, Craigforth 
dam muft be made gpod, and a lock erected there of eight 
feet fall. The lock formerly propofed at the Frew may be 
placed bdow the mouth of the Goodie, where it will fave al- 
moft all ^he dredging in the Forth, and will raife a fufficiency 
of water in the Goodie. The lock at Cardrofs muft be pla- 
ced below the ford, and muft be of eight feet fall at leaft. 

The Forth and Goodie being navigated by one or other of 
thefc methods, the next point would be to conne£t it with 
the Devon. The beft mes^ of rfedfipg this, I have Ihcwn 

in

in my report on that fubjeft^ to be by a cansd through the 
caries from Menftry dain» and upon its level to Craigforth 
dam, where it milft lock down nine feet fit inches to com- 
municate with the tipper Porth ) but whereas this ctoal waii 
principally intended to facilitate the carriage !f coals^ and it 
has been thought probable that quantities of that commo- 
dity irould be immediately carried Upon it t» would corref^ 
pond to the expence. It is now propofed to execute only 
that port of it which reaches from MenAry dam to Manor 
with the branch to Cambus \ to deepen both theie ports, and 
to make proper conyeniencies to tranfhip the coak; until 
experience fhall (hew which is the beft way of completing 
the communication, by locking down to the tideway/ or by 
the cdnal to Craigforth dam. 

The canal from Menftry dam to Manor being very little 
more thsin the canal from the fame place to the C&amp;mbus, will 
fave three miles failing on the tideway to the boats of the 
upper Forth and Stirling fhore. The Cambus branch is ne-* 
ccdary, becaufe by opening an export fale to Devon coallie- 
rieSf they will be enabled to fend a greater quantity of ton* 
nage upon the upper parts of the river, and thereby raiie 
more tolls. 

It is propofed, to uie the channel of the Devon, from Men^ 
ftry dam to Sauchie \ to lock. up thefe twenty-fix feet by four 
locks ; and to proceed td Meloch foot, or, if need be, to the 
Rack mill, by the canal. At leaft, two of the four locks at 
Sauchie can be cut out of a very good freeftone rock, which 
will greatly leflen the expence, and is accordingly allowed Sot 
in the eftinyites, ^ _ ,\^ • ...^ 

The dimenfions of the canal ape propofi^ to be .fixtqen 
feet wid^ at botVm, with four feet water. The locks thir- 
teen feet and a half wide, feventy-two feet Idng, atM of t)ie 
fidl fpecified. The navigation on the Forth n^ay be catried

inland rivers in England, ahd go on the tideway of the Horn- 
ber to HulL Up6n the canals and Devon, the boats will 
draw much eafier if they are narrow. But, I propofe, in the 
'View of a jonflion being effeAed between die Forth and De- 
4on by locks, that all the bridges and locks upon the Devon 
canals fhall be made of the fame fize- with tbo&amp; upon the 
Forth. So that the boats cOnftruAed for the latter may oc- 
caiionally ply upon the canak. 

Tlie late feafon of the year abfolntcly prevents the making 
minute or accurate fnrveys tit prefent. I have therefore 
made fbme allowance on that account } and I flatter myfelf 
that the eftimates are near the truth. 

The 'account I have given of the Goodie I have firora Mr 
Morriibn, who is well acquainted with it. I am al(b beholden 
to him for the levels and dcfcription of the Devon, and traft 
above Sauchie, which he furveyed in the year 1765. All the 
Mher particulars I have examined myfelf, except the found- 
ings of the tideway of the Forthi which I l^ate upon infor- 
snation. 

I have fixed no price to the land, becaufc the gentlemen 
intcreff^ arc better judges of that article fhia I am. 

As the map of upper Frtti'^is not yet finifiied, the diftan- 
ces of places I have given there are to be cotfiddred only as 
cftimated principally from a plan made of it in the year 1767,

nent of trade in general, as well as for the improvemoit of 
the countries adjacent to the faid rivers in particular.

IN IRELAND^ 
AND OP THE NEIGHBOURING DKIRICT.</head> 



<p>Introduciim. 
I requeft that the deader would have the goodnefs to excufe 
my inierting the following account oi a parifh in Ireland % 
but I am kd to do it, out of refpefl to the memory of a 
very public-fpirited individual, the late Right Hon. Williaai 
Burton Cnynghamj who traiifmitted it to me^ as the only 
account worth [n-efervingi received by the Dublin Society^ 
when they circulated their queries, regarding the ftate of 
Ireland, in 1773 : And indeed I think th^t this pa^r, la 
Ibme degree, explain^ the dtcmnftances wlych have con-^ 
tributed to the rebellion which has lately raged in that 
kingdom, and which, I truft, is now fortunately extin- 
guifhed« It muft fatisfy etery thinking individual, at thd 
fanae time, that by attention on the part of the Irifh go- 
vernment, by the introduftion of iaduftry and knowledge 
among a people fo highly favoured by pature, and by pro-, 
moting, through the medium of judtdous political invef* 
tigatipns, ufeful public inititutions, and. wife laws, thd 
profperity of the country, that the feeds of rebellion may 
bf «radi«»ted. ... 



373t * General Appendix U 

In compliance with the Society's rcqueft of laft June, (1773;^) 
I have employed fome time in examining, as far as in me 
lay, the prcfent condition of the pariflx of Kilronan, in the 
county of Rofscommon, and the adjoining * diftrift ; being, 
employed there this fun!imer, in the improvement of a tra£t 
thereof, which I have taken to farm laft year. 

ift query. The face of the arable part of this pariih is hilly; 
the intervening valGes, in fome parfs a very rich (oil, in 
others, turbarry. The foil of the hills lying fouth of Bra- 
liave momitain, having mofUy a fole of limeftone rock, and 
a furface of kind earth, produces fweet herbage and good 
crops of oats, though the tillage is indifferent. 

The hills eaftward df Crofs-Hill, and extending from thd 
tiver Feorus, to the ftrcam dividing the counties of Leitrim 
and Rofscommon, are compofed, In general, of a brittle, fri- 
able, brownifh earth, on the furface'. As they approach the 
river Shannon, and the lake, they have a bottom, in fome 
{)arts, of good manuring limedone gravel. As they afcend 
lip the fides of the mountains, the foil of the furface remains 
the fame colour and quality, about 16 inches deep, and the 
bottom a rotten flate, through which the water filtrates im- 
mediately, and by which the foil up the mountain remains 
remarkably dry, producing a fhort and faplefs grafs, but nei- 
ther coarfe nor fpiry. 

The parifh of Kitonan is bounded on the cafl by the 
Shannon and Lough Allen \ on the north, by tlie ffa-eam di" 
-viding the counties of Leitrim and Rofscommon \ and rnofUy 
^n the fouth and wefk by the river Feorus 

2dquerj.

The ^atijiical Account. 37J 

id query. Lough Allen is everywhere deep tod navigable^ 
tbout 9 miles long, and the Shannon is intended to be made 
navigable thereto ; though the works at Jamestown, about 7 
miles diftant» fecm to be this feafon fufpended. There are 
two other rivers, the Feonis and the Argnach'; neither of 
which are navigable, but both apt to fwell fudJenly with 
mountain floods, by which they enrich their banks, but the 
latter remarkably fo. * They, as well as the lake and the 
Shannon, are immenfely ftored with pike, eel, trout, perch^ 
Jcc. which may be taken in every feafon of the year, except ^ 
the winter months ; but never, fo far as I can find, employjd 
as a fund of induftry by the neighbouring inhabitants, nor 
fcnt to any market for fale. The river Argnach, I thrnk, 
merits a particular defcription, being in many refpeAs a na- 
tural curiofity. 

It rifts in the glyn which divides Braliave from Shcvc 
Corkrah, and taking a ftraight line from its fource, to its en- 
trance into the Shannon at Balytra Bridge, is about 7 miks 
)ong ; but if taken by its meandrings, would meafure double 
the length ; however, in all its ferpentine courfe, it does not 
deviate more than half a mile from a ftraight line drawn 
from its (burce to its end. No river in this kingdom fwells 
fo fuddenly after a fall of rain, the torrent being irrefiftible^ 
and carrying along an immenfe quantity of fine earth, fand^ 
mountain fludge, &amp;c. In the firft 4 miles of its courfct 
through the glen which divides the two mountains, it has 
many rapid falls through the rocks, and runs in a line rathar 
ftmighter than when it entirely quits the mountains at Arg- 
nach Bridge ; after it pafles this bridge, it meanders through 
a valley for near 3 miles, rendered, by its overflowings, al- 

Yiioft

moit as flat as a water-Icvdj and mightily enriched by its 
Jepofiting there much of its fine earth and ieJiment. 

Time, however, and fome fmail banks raifcd againft kf 
overflowings by the country people, about 30 years ago, hai 
cauTed a change in the river in this valley i it widened and 
deepened its bed, by which it does not npw overflow iti 
hanks perhaps once a year. By this change, the banks vc 
become from 12 to 14 feet higher than the l^d of the ri- 
ver at low water, and produce excellent oats and potatoes, 
the only com or roots ever cultivated here ; and whether 
from the richneis of tlie foil, or from the fun's being re* 
Sealed with more violence from the fides of the mountaiu 
in this valley and diftriA, oajts ripen here near 3 weeks fooih 
tr^ than in any part of the neighbouring counties* 

From the accounts I have had of the foil producing thf 
fine ombro madder in Holland, there is no ipot in this 
kingdom better adapted to the culture of that root, than the 
banks of this river. 

^dquery^ There is one mill on this river, well fituated 
by having no land loft by its water courf} \ it is kept in bad 
repafr, and is chiefly uied for the purpoie of grinding oat- 
malt for diftilUng fpirits. There is another mill at fiallyfu^ 
non, at the ibuth weft extremity of the parift, ufed much for 
the fame purpofe \ and the proprietor of this laft, ereAed kft 
ieafon a mill for the purpoie of fcutching flax i but it mufi le* 
main until the inhabitants of the diftri£k learn to cukivatc 
the fame, or elfe get buSnefs from the county of Sligo fide* 

gth (5* 'jtb querries. There is but one market town in Ac 
parifti, viz. Ballyfamon ; it forso^rly had a good iron-foun- 
dery, and mills, which are now difufed for want of Charcot; 
the weekly market is alfo diiufed, there being no trade ftir- 
ling, but 4 annual fairs are held for the fale of cattle. The 

village

^rfflagc conGfts at prcfcnt of about 10 cabbins; the inhabi- 
ttsote of which fubfift by dram felling. 

In the diftridk are tiro other market townsf viz. Drimkee- 
rin and Drimflianbo; a weekly matket^ however, is only held 
at Drimfhanbo on Fridays, which I have fometimes attend- 
ed, and faw no traffic whatever carried on, and fcemed in- 
tended only f#r an aflcmblage of people for the purpofe of 
whiiky drinking. 

The roads through the parifli and diffaiA and the bridges, 
have been the work of the Ikft 14 years. Before then, this 
diftriA was the moft impenetrable part of the kingdom ; but 
as at prefent a moft convenient paflage from the county of 
Sligo to the counties of Leitrim, Cavan, &amp;c. aUb from the 
comity of Rofcommon, to EnniKktUen, and the north. 

^b query. ManufaAures of any kind, never yet gained 
admittance into the parifli of Kilronan, or neighbouring dit 
tri^V, (the making of iron, now dropped, alone excepted.) 
The only, method ufed by the inhabitants for pa3dng their 
rents, which are lower here than in any part of the king* 
dom I know of, is by the fale of the increafe of their cattle 
and pigs. ^ There are alfo abont 250 hories fed here, which 
are employed in the carriage of coals and culm from Mr 
Jones's coallicry,' all over the adjacent country. Their me- 
thod of conveyance, is, by back loads, in fmall bo&amp;ets, half 
a barrd in each \ their price about 12 s. per ton, for every 10 
miles. They cannot be perfuaded to the ufe of wheel cars, 
thoagh one car would carry two barrels, and the work of 4 
horfes would consequently be performed by one. 

The women are entirely- idle, and have no manner of en»- 
2ioyment. They will not attempt the raifing of flax, for 

which

'are totally unftpployod in this pariifa and diftrid:. The piff- 
iih contains 370 families, which, including' qaea, vomco, 
grown boys and girls, may be calculated at 4 tp a baSiff 
which makes at prefent X480 hands* who only baitly pro- 
cure themfelves a fubfiftence, and are utterly ofidefs to the 
public. The whole diftriA is 'equally weU iabalHled, aad 
equally idlei except about Drimkeerin. 

\^th query. I hear of on^y 2 £unilies emigrated to Aam- 
rica laft feafon, and never any before ; biii by the eager en- 
quiries of the people about t^xeir fuccefs, I imagine, the ipirit 
of emigration might quickly feia^e them. 
,, i6th query. Perhaps this l^ingdom could not furaiib vot 
other diftriA, which could afford fo mu^h fatisfafUoa, ia rc- 
{pe£t to your i6th query, as thi^i to which, however, froa 
;ny w^t of ikill in many .of thefj$ matters, I am diTqualified 
to aflbrd you the fatisfa^tion t c^vld wifli* Howewr, I cas 
inform you, that tbroughoiit the whole dtftri£^ a Tein of ve- 
ry fine coal ihews it&amp;lf j but noi^e is worked at prefent, a^ 
x:ept Mr Jones's, and that b badly, xhat if any water, be it 
ever fo little, comes on thf workmen, they are oUsged t» 
defift, not having even a comQion pump to rid themfelves of 
any part. 

The variety of ftrong fulphnr fpas, &amp;€. ftaltered tfaroogh 
the diftridb, perhaps indicate a variety of minerals, which I 
want ikill to- afcertainj and no place in this Idogdom, afibrdf 
fb great quantity of iron ore \ nor is there perhs^ a place in 
Europe where iron could be made to more advantage, if the 
method of running the fame, with pit-coal^ ix]tft6ad of char* 
coal, could be thoroughly prafHied* 

Here alio is the greateft variety of fine pot^rs earth, tiid 
inexhauftible quarries of flint lie at the diftance of 5 miks 
from Ballytra Bridge. This has^ made me. often Aink, with 
what Superior advantage a pottery might be eftabliibed here,

itt fHtmaim fo ii^f place in StaiAbrdfhiit ; the price of land,

iStk^ quantity and chcapnefs tff fuel, are alt in favour of this 
{dace. Ad^ te d^ the benefit of water carriage, like to be 
foon {o univerfal from this place, by means of the Shannon 
ami Grand Canal. At Durflem, trhere thej manufaAure 
the jueen's«vare, they carry flint^by land 60 miles, and lye 
IMar 60 miles from any fea-pmt. Here, an eafy water car- 
riage is likely fbon to be effeAed, to almoft every principal port 
m the kingdoni. 

The navigation could be eafily extended to the weft coaft. 
T&amp;e north-weft part of Lough Allen is diftaiit from Lough 
031y, which extends to Sligo, about 7 miles ; and the level 
of dicf H^o Waters, taken with exa£hiers, is about 8 feet, 
ifnthet high dills nor deep vallies intervening. 

The ii^e of the farms, I take it, would be aifo favourable 
id ptfpiflatioA ahd manufa£bires.«-^The riflng grounds, as in- 
terfeAed by the valUesf run from 40 to 80 acres. The pro- 
portion of bog and mountain to arable and meadow, exceeds 
o&amp;e half, and I take the whole' diftriA, on improvement, 
wbul'd turn out from ir to i j,ooo acres.

that calculation was finifhed* 

The expeAation of life derived from the above table, of 
the probabilities of life adapted to Scotland in general, page 
2d, is not only much inferior to that corre(ponding to the 
Fife table of obfervations, but is alio lefs, excepting at in- 
fancy, than the expe£btion of life produced from an Edin- 
burgh table, an. 1780. Fsom whence it may be inferred, that 
the bills of mortality are the only proper (burces from which 
fuch tables of obfervations ought to be derived.

<p>Popidatim^i^^T hath not been found convenient to make 
aa a£faial enumeration of the population fince the original 
Report was given in ; few general caufes have, however, 00 
cnrredy to affinrd ground for conjecturing that it hath been 
any way materially afiefted. 

The manufiiAnring of paint from iron ore at Lamancha 
(moitioned in the Report) has been difcontinued \ but the 
ceflation of employment from this circumftance, Would ap- 
pear to have been more than compenfated by the increafed 
demand for labour at the Hme quanies, and confequently at 
the coal mines. 

No confideraUe difference hath taken place as to the 
mode of occupying the lands, to affedl perceptibly the ftate 
of population. In two inftances lands, occupied by the pro- 
prietors in grazing, have been let to farmers ) in one of 
thefe inftances, for the purpofe of tillage, which rather 
(peaks to increafe of hands. In another inftance, a farm^ 
managed by the farmer upon the old unproductive fyftem, 
has been taken into the proprietor's own hands for improve- 
ment ; which no doubt befpeaks additional demand for la- 
bour. One confiderable tillage hrm has been let for graz- 
ing. No other inftances worth mentioning, in point of mag« 
nitude, have occurred either as to union or diqunftion of 
farms, or variation in their mode of occupancy. 

There were few weavers in the parifh dependent upon the 
weaving of cotton : of courfe the population was hardly at all 
afieAed by the fliock given to manufiiAuring credit in x 793. 

Balancing the difierent caufes that have occurred, tend- 
3 C 2 ing 



3tS General Appendix to 

ing to dimlnini or aug^nt the population, I (liould be led 
to fuppofe it incrcafcd, fincc the date of the report, bj five 
or Hx families. 

The bcfore-*nentioiicd csitifes relate rather to the local 
transference, than the real ftate of population upon the 
whole. It may be obferved, therefore, in general^ that Wa- 
ges of all kinds have increafed iince the time of the report, 

. by. nearly one half of the then rate, in addition : Nor would 
this appear to be a mere nominal rife proportioned to the de- 
preciation of money \ but a real bettering of the labourers Jitwh 
tion : For though butcher meat, till very lately, hath beta 
generally dearer in nearly the fame proportion j yet (except- 
ing the dearth arifing from the Parliamentary hue and cry 
in 1 795*6,) the prices of grain feem not to have increafed 
above the rate of one third or lefs of their then rate. In fo 
far then as greater facility of rearing families, affords greater 
kicGuragement to marriage and propagation, population upon 

/ the whole • may be prcfumcd to be progreffive : unlefs wc 
were to fuppofe an unfavourable difpofltion in the elements, 
which indeed, within thefe i8 months, has manifefted it- 
ielf to be peculiarly noxious to the feline fpecies ; cats, in 
this county, as in others, having died within that period, 
by cart-loads, of the yellow lever, as was fometimes imagin- 
ed ;-~the wrath ,of Apollo' fell iirft upon the dogs in the 
Grecian camp before Troy ; and in thefe days of gloom and 
of prophecy, the death of the cats was apt to be viewed with 
apprehenidon as the prelude of ibme dreadful calamity. 

iFor the reafons affigned in my original reports of this, or 
the adjoining parifh of Linton, no exa^ returns can be had 
of births, deaths, marriages, or their refpeftite proportions. 
To lay open the infide of this parifti, and to afford a

which there are not many, get from the farmers, land for lint ; 
. alio what their dung will go over, for potatoes or bear : Shep. 
herds have iheep grazed, and if heads of families, a cow alfo. 

The above ftatements fhow the whole conne£lion of the 
hihabitants with the lands. 

There are no bakers nearer than the village of Linton, nor 
brewer than the burgh of Peebles ; nor butcher except oc- 
cafionally. Though there is a flefh market at Peebles, the 
coaveniency of weekly carriers to Edinburgh makes it 
cheaper to. get flefh, bread, &amp;c. from thence, than to fend 
on purpofe elfewhere. There are no law praAitioners nearer 
than Peebles \ no midwife nearer than Linton \ nor furgeona; 
nearer than linton or Peebles.

vhkh two laft articles may have rifen in rent about as much 9 
and that not merely from the increafed demand for lime, as 
9n improvement of the lands ; but from the increaiing de- 
mand for coal as fuel ; the farmers engaged in their agri- 
culture, finding it more inconvenient than formerly, to fpare 
the time and labour of their fervants and horfe&amp; in prepar* 
ing fuel from the peat moiles. 

Few farms have fallen out of leafe ^fince the date of the 
Report : Such as have, are raifed by the addition of probably 
two-thirds of the former rent. The Icafes were formerly of 
nineteen years endurance; the rents all in money, excepting 
in ibmp inftances, a few poultry or Carriages of fuel. ThQ 
;ibove ftatement applies generally through the county. 

Thofe ikilled in political arithmetic can beft judge how 
far thcfe riles in rent are merely nomif^al, being proportion- 
ed merely to the depreciation of money \ an4 how far they 
are real and attributable to the increafe both of agricultural 
capital and fkill, by which the lands are rendered really more

fiones, Dutch weight. Such are my conveniences and four- 
ces of profit ; the land remaining in tillage being however 
unfit to afford winter fodder for the cattle, this deficiency 
is in part made up by a (mall farm. * '

3$8 General Appendix to 

Gtfteral Oh/ervations on Glebes.--^. The original idea of af- 
fignin'g glebes to the Clergy, fecms to have been *• to fup- 
* ply thetn, through this means, with conveniencics faitcd 
*' to tlieir fituation \ that they might be enabled, without 
"*' unncccflary diftraftion, to attend to fuch minifterial oc- 
•* cupations and literary purfnits as corrclpond with their 
^^ charadler and profcflion." 

The legal designation of the glebes of the Scots Clergy, 
mz.four and an half Scats acres (including the file of his boufts 
and garden) cf arable land ; with contigimis paflure land% fuj» 
jident for thefummer^s grazing of two cows and one horfe^ did 
certainly, however, refer to cuftoms exifting at the time of 
the cnaftment, and which now no longer ,exift.' The pa- 
riihioners had been in ufe to plough the glebe and to cany 
the clergyman's fuel ; fo as to leave him the ufe of his oiu 
horfe entirely for the purpofe of riding upon minifterial duty ; 
a cuftom of which there are ftill fome traces remaining in 
various parts of the country* 

Unlefs the enaftment referred to iuch exifting cuftom, h 
is not eafy to conceive what could have induced the LegiP 
lature to fix upon an ai&amp;gnation of lands which is fb pre- 
pofterous and fo inhabile to any purpofe of accommodatioDi 
as to fecm rather dcfigncdly to have been contrived to create 
embarraffinent. 

It cannot furely be fuppofed to have been the intention 
of the Legiftature that the clergyman, with his one hor&amp;

It is not now the cuftom of the parifhioners to plough 
the clergyman's glebe, or to carry his fuel ; nor is it perha^ 
£t that fuch cuftoms (hould fubiift ; being, fo far as they go, 
deftru^Te of that independence which it is certainly the 
great intention of an eftabliihment to fupport* As matt^v 
ftand, however, it is evident that a mm legal gUbe^ to hr 
from {Preventing embarraflment by fnpplyiiig conventcncy, 
xnuft neceflarily occaiion infinitely mor« diftraftion to she 
dergyman in its management, than a large farm under diro^ 
tion of a confidential fervant ; and alfo much more nopw 
fitable wafte of labour. 

The original intention of the Legtflature is not iiow« 
therefore, anfwered by the enafhnent ; which is inapplicable 
to the exifting circumftances. 

To anfwer that ^ltention, it would be necefiary that 
glebes {hould be augmented, to fuch proper fize of a farai,. 
as would fully occupy (including canris^ of fuel) a manser- 
vant and a couple of woridng horfes ; affiuding alio keeping 
for a horfe ,or poney u(ed foldy for riding : As alio to iiip- 
port fuch a complement .^ cows as ihould confume the fbd-' 
der raifed by the labour of the horfes^ to yield dung for the 
land, and to produce milk and butter, &amp;c. yielding profit a- 
dequate to the ezpence of an herdiman and dairy maid, in 
addition to the fervants neceilary for houfe iervice. Per- 
haps five or Gx cows (according to the fize adapted to the 
paihnv) might be a fufficient complement* And, according 
to the quality of the foil, from 30 to 50 or (So acres^ might 
fuffice for the extent of land* 

The glebe might be augmented from the land moil con- 
venient ', recourfe being vefted in the proprietor whofe 
laxids wcpc allocated againft the other heritors^ and a propor-

donal reduction of the ftipend being allowed to each, accord- 
ing to the proportion of yhat he pays for the augmentation 
of the glebe. It may be objected to this fcheme^ that an 
mconvenienct might be felt by the intrant clergy, in pro- 
turing ftock fiifRcient to occupy fo large a farm ; moft clergy- 
men living no funds, or tery flendcr ones, when admitted to 
abene6ce : When it is, however, con fidered, that every cler- 
gyman upon his admiifion muft, ia geoerai, at all events, hire a 
man fervant and purchase a couple of hcrfes, befides one or 
two cows ; the additional eicpence of this fcheme (:oniifting 
merely in the purchafe of perhaps four cows more, with a 
few additional bolk of grain for (eed) would not appear 
▼cry difiicnlt to, be got over : If tlie clergyman is young and 
vigorous at his admifllon, he might for a time difpcnfe with 
a riding horfe, performing (lisjournies on foot. 

As fach an arrangement may not readily take place, it 
©ay be proper to cpnfider,

Ac fake of method, to confider the ftatc of glebes. First 
in towns, or wh^e population is frequent ; Second ia coun- 
try panihes^ where population is thin. 

First, in towns, or where population {s numerous and 
labour properly fubdivided, and where eivery convenience 
and accommodation can be procured for hire \ it would un» 
doubtedly be moft advantageous for the clergyman to con- 
ttaft his cftablifliment of feryants to what is indlfpenfably 
neccffary for mere menial fervice, i. e. to one houfcmaid, or 
a hoofen^aid and a little girl as afBftant, if his family is nu- 
merous : To let his gkbe for rent to fome contiguous far-

As, however, a clergyman can grant no iecurity 6f tenure 
beyond his own incumbencyi and of couHe the tacUman 
can have no fecurity of continuanoe of intcreft^ to induce 
him to launch out in improvements of diftaat retom ; as by 
coniequence fuch lands muft neceflfarily be doomed to re» 
main in a ftatc of comparative fterility : it might therefiarci 
in the view of public utility, be ftill more expedient that the 
land in fuch fituations ihould be entirely taken away from 
the clergyman (excepting, no doubt, what fuffices for gardeni 
ihrubbery, poultry-yard, and fuch like) and that a com* 
penfation ihould be given hun in an annual payment. Tliat I 
the intereft of the clergyman may however at all times be ! 
confulted, let there be no alienation of the j^ebe, imleb 
upon application of the incumbent clergyman to that efieft, ; 
or of the Prefbytery in cafe of a vacancy : And fiutber, to I 
prevent any fuch meafure from being applied tot coHufivelyB 
let no fuch application on the part of the incumbent be va« 
lid, without the confent of his Prefbytery. When an ap- 
plication comes forward to the ordinary Judge of the bounds 
in this proper ihape, let it be provid^ for properly by IaW| 
that the glebe fhall be fold to the befl advantage, by roup or 
by Jury ^ let the price then be divided amongft the heritors 
pro rata of their valued rent | and let an addition to the fti- 
pend, equivalent toihe legal interefl of the pnrchafe meneyi 
be allocated in grain upon the lands in the fame ratio» 

 
Second, In country parifhes where population is unfre* 
quent, where labotu* i&amp; not fubdivided, and where of courfe 
conveniences cannot be had for hire ; it nuqr be indilpenfa* 
biy neccflary for the clergyman^ in point of accommodation 
to poflefs land.

land than m men kgal gUe, k is evidenti from what has 
been already fiated, at what difadvantage he muft farm it i 
hofw dear his accommodation muft ftand to the clergyman } 
how deur to the public, from the idle expence of labour in 
cflferting nothing, which if properly applied might have been 
highly produftiTC* 

If the glebe is properly indofed and fubdividedi I ihould 
^prehend that the moft profitable mode of occupancy, 
would he U Isy $ta tii whole in grafs\ and, alternately, to 
paftnre the different fields for a feafon ; and to dofe them 
up for hay after haying all the winter^s dung fpread upon 
them as a top drefling in fpring. The cattle kept would be 
merely one horfe, which would perform no work but the 
carrying out of the dung to the field to be allotted for hay \ 
and to carry in the hay ) the other, cattle would be milk 
cows. The only expence of fenrants woi4d be an houfe- 
aiaid and affiftant girl. The fuel muft be hired in. Pro- 
bably it might be neceflary to buy in yearly a quantity of 
fedder, and certainly fome ftraw for litter to the cattle^^f 
any part of the glebe could be converted into water meadow, 
it would greatly add to the winter provifion of fodder, al- 
lowiiig all the dung to be laid upon a difierent field for hay. 
This (cheme however neceflarily implies, that the carriage 
#f fiiel can be procured for hire. 

A ftiii better refource (wha« attainable) would be to rent 
• finafl quantity of la^d lying contiguous ; which, in con« 
junfHon with the glebe, might conftitute the requifite tat 
of ^Eurrn taken notice of (p. 400.) It is however, evident, 
that no legid, arrangement can pofiibly be formed to feoire 
dcrgymen. In fiich fituations, in the requifite fize of farm*

is too fmall to conftrtate a farm by itfclf, for the occupancy 
of a practical farn^r \ it would be neccfTary for that purpc^ 
too, that it iliould have accommodation of (eparate houies, 
which ca»not. be ereoVcd but at aft expencc difprcportiouate 
to its value : Either tlierefore, it muft Iiaye feparate iioufesii

doabt the fyftem of univarTal fiiffirage, however it may be 
admired ia theory, is generally found good for nothing, 
when the queftim is to conduA bufineis upon a ^tional plan. 
The clergyman has, however, no farther intereft in his glebe 
than his own uncertain life, or ftill more uncertain incumf- 
bency \ and can communicate no more permanent fecurity t6 
the tackfman« Withotit doubt, in the courfe of their pro- 
feffiohal education, moft of the clergy receive a tinAure of 
the liberal arts (a mode of education, by the way, which the 
deciiions of the laft General Afiembly have moft decidedly 
enforced) and in point oftajlty hiay be fuppofed ready to exe-

ficient inducement, in point of intereft : The general improve-

principles^than mere tajie^ elfe it will make but flow progrefs. 
Several fchemes have been fubmitted to the General Af*

Upon the whole it would appear; imo, That though

Jn the laft year incloded in Table lU. there was an ex-

3pJ, pfie half of which was given by the heritons; tiid reft 
froia farmers aod fiibftantial tradisfffica*

bcrs fupplicd arc taken from the trcafurer's books-, in 
which, when a family is relieved, the name of the head of 
the family only is marked ; fo that the number of indivi- 
duals relieved may be taken at leaft at double of what is 
ftated in the table. 

Befides fupplying the poor, the falary of the klrkfelEon

Some time ago an heritor in a country parifh brought an

<p>THE late mini{ler though a man of fenfe and learning, 
yet labouring under the infirmities of old age, when ftatii^ 
tical inquiries were fet on foot, did not undertake writing 
the account of this parilh. An anonymous account, how- 
ever, was foon publiflied ; but not being fo complete as 
could be wifhed \ which indeed could not be expected from 
a perfon, who was probably a ftranger to the diftriA ; it 
therefore occurred to the prcfent incumbent, after receiving 
Sir Jolm Sinclair's laft letter, rcqucfting fomc additional 
information on the fame fubjeft, that thb might be a proper 
opportunity of writing a brief Statidical Account of the 
parifli, comprehending as much of the information defixtd 
as can be obtained, or as circumftanccs will admit. 



^e Stafi/iical AaounU 417 



Extent^ Surface^ Soil, t5V. 

Tlie pariih extends from north to fouth, about ten miles j 
and from eaft to weft, between five and fix \ not exceeding 
the diftance of four miles from the moft fertile and improv- 
ed part of Strathmore. It may be divided into two dif- 
trifts, the northern and the fouthern. The northern, or 
the upper part, confifting chiefly of hills and vallies j the 
former, of no confidcrable height, produces, in its prefcnt 
ftate, better crops of grafs than corn, on account chiefly pf 
the diftance from manure. But that the land is by no 
means of an inferior quality clearly appiMrs from the exer- 
tions of fome individuals, and particularly of one tenant, 
who, happening to be in better circumftances than ordinary, 
by which he has been enabled to do juftice to his ground, 
has had, for fome ye^s paft, fuch returns, as may vie with 
the produftions of fome of the moft fertile, and beft im- 
proved foil in Strathmore. In the lower diftrift, extend- 
ing from the fouthern extremity, about three miles north, 
the ground is, in general, very fertile, and produces excel- 
lent crops of oats, barley and turnip, being advantageoufly 
fituated within four miles of marie, a very ufeful manure in 
this country. This part of the parifh has a fine iexpofurc, 
lies in the form of an oblong, gently declining to the fouth. 

Riven — Tlie river Ifla bounds the parifli on the weft. 
This beautiful ftream, after running through Glen ifla, the 
neighbouring parifli to the north, falls, upon touching this 
parifli, into a deep rocky channel ; and after five miles of 
a circular courfe, it leaves the parifli at the cafde of Airly, a 
romantic feat of the Earl of Airly, and runs nearly in a 
fouth direftion, down to the fertile fields of Strathmore.- It 

Vo! XXI. 3 G may

may not be improper to mention a beautiful cafcade^ callcil 

the Reeky-Lin, about two miles weft from Airly Caftlc, 

where the Ida falls, with impetuofity and noife, from a rock 

apparently fixty feet high, into a whirl-piool ; the appearance 

of which, efpecially when the water is in flood, is h grand^ 

that many lovers of natural curiofities have come from a con* 

^derable diftance to behold it. A little farther down is 

what is called the Slug of Achranny, where the banks oo 

^ch fide are remarkably high and fteep, and the water con* 

fined between two rocks very near each other, tumbles 

down a precipice, exhibiting a tremendous appearance. Tbe 

other river, Melgum, is much lefs than the former, though 

it is a very pretty ftream, abounding with excellent trout ^ 

a large fize, that can be eafily catched with the fly in the 

angling feafon. The river runs nearly through the middle 

of the parifh and joins the Ifla at the Caftle of Airly. A«^ 

bout two miles up from this junction, it tumbles over four 

rocky precipices from fifteen to thirty feet highj called the 

Loups of Kenny, the banks on each fide being uncommonl|r 

fteep. In high water efpecially, the fpcAator is entertained 

with an appearance peculiarly grand and majeflic. About 

half a mile farther down, the river moves for a fhort ws^ 

(till it falls into the Ifla) in a moft pleafant fei^pentine dea 

covered on each fide with natural wood,^ which delights tbe 

. eye of every perfon who can relifli the beauties of nature^ 

And this leads me to obferve, that as this parifh in general is 

fertile and improveahle, and waifaed with the two above 

mentioned rivers, it wants only wood to make it one of the 

moft pleafant and beautiful places in this or any other 

northern county. Some clumps, however, of afhcs of con- 

fiderable fize appear about moft of the farm ftea4ings, which 

iflbrd fome flielter and embeiUfhment. One farm parties* 

flrl^i called K4nnaird fpar^ely hailf a oiile eaflward from the 



ttimtli tad a faurm of very good foili is adorned with one 
hundred afh treesi foaae of confiderable age;— «aid about 
half a ipile farther eaft there is another farm named Shan-^ 
tia%, originally the feat eSz gentleman formerly one of the 
hcriton of the parilh, where there is ftill to be feen a good 
immber of very fine old trees, of different kinds^ that are 
very confpiciloos at a diftance, and attra£k the particular 
notice of any perfon who comes to take a view of the 
couatry. 

State of the Peo^^ Buildirt^s^ {aTr.— Tlie ibhabitants are, 
in gencrali difcreet, honeft and inoffenfive ; and fome of the 
£uraicrs are well refpeded* Their drefs is plain \ and oti 
Sundays they are always clean and neat ; and the writer o^ 
this account has the fatisfaAton to declare, that they are 
Tery regular, in their attendance on public worihip ( and 
have every appearance of unafieded devotion. Here, no 
religious difputes or controveriies prevail, as the people are 
all, with the exception of two or three^ of the eftabllfhed 
church } and as they are ib fenfiUe to believe, that religion 
confiAs not So much in entertaining this or that opinion, as 
in decency ^and propriety of conduA. It is furely fome 
proof of their good behaviour, that there has been no cri* 
minal trial from the parifh, nor any (editious mob in it from 
time immemorial. In this and in the neighbouring pa* 
riflies, inoculation has been adopted, efpecially among fome 
•f the noft refpeftable families* b is however a pity, that 
a confiderable number of the country people are ftill pre* 
judiced, tln-oogh ignorance and miflaken ideas, againft this 
noble invenrion, though k is to be hoped their prejudices 
will be gradually removed. With regard to building, the 
houfes are generally one flory of mafon work covered with 
thatch. Of late fome have been bdlt of two ftories and

'Iodge4 having, even in houfes of the fmalleO; fize, one fniig 
neat apartment with a bofom chimney, always kept clean and 
clecenti in which they entertain their neighbours who occa- 
fionally vifit-them. If they are ftrangers to the luxilries and 
refinements of fome other people in the fame line, and 
which to a fupcrficial obferver may indicate greater profpe- 
rity, it may be confidently affirmed that they are ftrangers 
to many of their vices, and that they enjoy a greater degree 
of comfort and happinefa.

ttrelve pounds fterling. Here, from the diftancc of ma- 
nure, &amp;c. improvements are but In their infancy. In the 
fouth and more improved part, there are two tenants, each 
of which pofleffes upward of 150 acres arable, bofides paf- 
ture to a very coniiderable extent. About twelve rent from 
50 to ICO acfcs arable. On fome of the fmall farms, the 
tenants are rather backward in adopting the new fyftcm ; 
but others even of that defcription are very attentive and 
induilrious, there being no lefs than 600 acres in the parifh 
in proper culture, with fufficient quantity of fown grafs, 
fallow and turnip, and the rotation of crops is not altoge- 
ther regular ; there may be nearly about one half in com 
crop, atid the other half in fown grafs and fallow. Very 
few farms here being meafared, the number of arable acres 
b not known. 

There arc five heritors in the parifli, the Earl of Airly, 
Charles Lycll, Efq. of Kinnordy, John Smyth, Efq. of Bal- 
harry, J»me) Ogilvy, Efq. of Iflabank, and John Milne^ 
farmer of Blackdykes. Of thefe, Lord Airly is by far the 
moft confiderable proprietor, having more than two- thirds 
of the parifh. It has been particularly remarked, that this 
Nobleman has granted but very few leafes to his tenants, 
and this fcheme has been conlidcred as hoftile to improve- 
ment. It docs not become a .clergyman to enter into con- 
troverfy, but it is an undoubted faft that the tenants of the 
noble family of Airly, both here and in other parifhes, have 
always been remarkable for cafe and opulence. Few of the 
old refidenters or their defcendents have ever been removed, 
ft confidence between the landlords and tenants having pre- 
, vailed time immemoriaK The farmers all declare their fa- 
tisfaftion to continue at the prefent rent, fome of their pof- • 
fcfSons being very lo\f rated, and none above the value ; 
tod if the proprietor and tenant have agreed upon a certain

number of carriages to be paid as part of the rent^ it does tt#t 
appear to be confiderable. I have been certainly informed, 
that there was a time, when the whole carriages on the 
eftate of Airly were o£Fered to be commuted at a moderate 
conycrfion, but to this the tenants would not agree. A* 
mong the few leafes granted to tenants in the parifh^ ibmc 
are very low rented, and without any carriages. But thofe 
who have no regular leafes, have been in ufe to poflcia ovi 
agreement for a period of between fourteen and nineteen 
years \ and as thefe agreements are never broke through, 
the tenants confider themfelves as in perfeA fecurity, and 
they live fatisfied and happy. May this amity long con- 
tinue. On this head, I think it rather the bufinefs ^ a 
clergyman to preach the gofpel of peace to his hearers, than 
to make any attempts to raife difcord between his parifhioD^ 
crs and their mafter where none prevailed before. But, if 
the mode of letting farms that has, for fome time, been 
adopted in this parifh, ihould be confidered as in any de« 
gree difcouraging, I am certainly informed, that leaies are 
to be granted to fuch tenants aa have no title of pofleffion, 
and who may chulc to have them. It is undoubtedly no 
fmall mark of encouragement and fatisfa^on, as well as of 
tnduftry, that fome of the greatei: farmers have indoied 
very confiderable parcels of ground \ and within thefe few 
years, have cultivated from waiVe land covered with heath 
and whins, forty, fixty or more acres, which they have dif* 
covered to be by no means of inferior quality, and vriucfa 
have produced very good crops of com and barley. 

With regard to the amount of live ftock and their valuey 
I am informed, there are about loo horfes, worth, at an 
average, from eight to twelre pounds fterling, nine hundred 
cattle, worth at an average, when about three years old, 
from five to fevcn pounds fterling \ and near to 200 fhoep,

irortfa from ten to eighteen Ihilllings. How xnucli aninud 
food majr be confamed in the parilh I am uncertain ; but 
yiot leTs than one thoufand pounds worth of live ftock are 
ibid out of it annuallj. In this pariih there are four corn 
mills, one waulk mill, and a lint mill. In the latter, not left 
than five hundred ftone of lint are drefled yearly, which is 
raifed moftly in the parifh. Formerly there was a fufficient 
ipiantity of mofs, and though it is now a good deal eK« 
haufted, yet the moft of the pariihioners are well enough 
ferved with fuel 5 and they 'arc certainly, not ih a wwfc fi- 
tuation in this rcfpeA, than many neighbouring parifhes. I 
cannot afcertain the real rent exa^Uy : but it is computed 
at an average, from nine to ten (hillings per acfCj thQUgh 
fome of the ground is let at twenty Oiillin^v 

Ctunh^ Stipend^ School, Poor.r^Ths church is old and 
rather fmall for the pariih ; but it is proposed to enlarge it 
or to build a new one. There was a new manfe built about 
three years ago, confiding of fix rooms, a kitchen, milk« 
houle and cellar, with other conveniences } ib that the cler« 
gyman is as decently and comfortably lodged as any in his 
ilation can reaibnably expeft. The ftipend was, fince the 
year 1720, not more than 4ool. Scots, with two chalders 
and a half of vi^hial ^ but an augmentation was obtained in 
1 796, and it is now three hundred and thirty-fix pounds Scots, 
pmd thirteen bolls of viftual y lo that at an average, the 
Jiving will amount to upwards of one hundred pounds fter- 
Ung, with a glebe of more than the legal fize, (^ excellent 
£»!, and about three acres more for which the Minifter, for 
time immemorial, has paid no more than twenty-two {hillings 
fterling, little more than fevcn fliillings per acre. By the good- 
»cfs of the family of Airly the prefent incumbent pays no

•Walter Ogllvy of Clova, is patron. There is a very fuf* 
ficicnt fchool-houfc built of mafon work and dated, but not 
yet quite fiiiilhed within. Both matter and fcholars will be 
pcrfcftly well accomodated. Tiic number of fcholars may 
be reckoned from i6 to 20 in fummer, and from 40 to 68 
in winter. As to the fchool falary, which is only eight bolls 
of corn \ it niay be mentioned^ that there was lately a fchool 
xuafler, who rcfided in that capacity about iixty years in the 
parifl) ', and that bo augmentation to the falary took place, 
might be owing to his not demanding it \ and that the 
tenants from long acquaintance, and from a regard for the 
roan, gave him yearly, perhaps, double the quantity of oats 
to which he was legally entitled. The number of poor on 
the feiEon roll is from five to feven. The funds are about 
120I. fterling ; the intereft of which, with the rent of a gal* 
Icry in the church, and from four to five (hillings of week- 
ly coUeflion, with the mort-cloth money, is fufficient to fup* 
port the few that are really indigent. 

Lahsf jinfiquiiies.f'^ About a quarter of a mile weft from 
the pariih, there is a lake, commonly called the Loch of 
Lintrathen, fiiiTounded by rifing grounds, excepting on the 
eaft. There are feveral lakes in this county of Angus 5 but 
this is univerfally allowed to be i^icodiparably tht fineft. It 
is nearly circular, about one mile from eaft to weft, and 
three in circumference. It is believed to be fed moftly from 
fprings, as the few very fmall rills from the iurrounding 
heights, would be infufl5cient for that purpofe. The water 
is tranfpare^t. In fome places the depth is immenfe^*-but 
where it could be done, attempts have been made to difco- 
ver marie, which, however, have not yet been found fucccfs- 
ful. Ccu\d this manure be' found in the loch, to drain it 
might be pafticable. It abounds in pike, perch, trout and

eel, all of cxqnifite quality. The trout, of a large Czc, taftc 
very much like thofe of Loch Leven. It is very remarkable^ 
that, in this lake, the trout have not been ^nown to take 
the fly, except in a very few inftances. About half a mile 
north weft from the Manfe are to be fecn fcveral cairns, 
perhaps memorials of fome engagement, but there is no tra* 
^ition } and on a rifing ground, not far from this, there is a 
ftone of about fourteen feet high, and four in diameter. 
It (lands perpendicular : and near it are other two of about 
the fame fize lying on the ground. But as there is no in- 
fcriptiop upon any of them ; and as tradition is filent, I ran 
fay nothing about thom. Near the weft end of the lak^ 
there was an extenflve inclofure, and there are ftill fome 
remains of it, which, tradition fays, was a deer park belonging 
to Sir Allan Durward of that ilk. On the fouth-weft decli- 
vity of the hill of Formal, near the river Ifla, may be fcen 
the ruins of this gentleman's houfe.

Increafe^ 85 

I cannot account for this increafe, as there has not been 

any manufafture introduced \ it is, notwithftandingy a matter 

of faft, that the popubtion here has been increafing for fifty 

yean back. 

The (lipend confifts of money only, which, with the value 
of the glebe, makes the living amount to 80I. flerling. There 
Have been no experiments made to afcertain the moft profi- 
table mode of managing the glebe. The fame fyftem which 
prevails invariably in this country was always followed ; and 
that is, to have part under com and hay, and part in pafture* 
At the fame time, it appears to me clearly demonftrable from 
calculation, and it is conformable to experience, that no crop 
fliould be raifed in Skye at all, but hay alone. Nature has 
evidently intended this country for pafture 5 and, of courfe^ 
cattle fliould be our chief care. The cGmate is fo unfteady, 
that oqr expe£lations from crop are very commonly fniftra- 
tcd J and the expence pf making that crop exceeds the re- 
turns even when they are moft flourilbing;

duce if not tilled, we fhall find that raifing crops in Skye . 
(hay by all means excepted) is a mod ruinous fyftem. 

There arc no mapu&amp;^res ; no commercial produce ; no

4i3 General Appendix io 

It is unfriendly to the intereAs of this parifli in many ro- 
fpe&amp;, that although there be no fewer than ten heritors, 
none of them reflde in the parifh, except Mr Thomfbn of 
Banchory, who reiides during fummer. 

Agriculture appears in this parifli in all its various forms; 
infomuch, that to give any particular account of the treat- 
ment of the land were impoffible. I am happy, however, in 
being able to ftate, that a fpirit of improvement is difiiifing 
itfelf faft \ and to this the turnpike roads, which are made 
in difierent direfidons through the pariih, contribute not a 
little. 

There are three midwives in the parifh \ and from the 
vicinity of Aberdeen, where is an infirmary and many pro- 
feffional men of abUities, the parifhioners here can be at no 
lofs for excellent medical and furgical aid, whep neccflaiy. 
But it unfortunately happens that the cheapeft is often pre- 
ferred -, and any half-taught apothecary, who places a C/z/Ws 
head over his door, and impudently has the word IkSor 
painted under it in large characters before his name, pro- 
cures more employment among the lower daflcs^ than thp 
moft able phyfician. 

Prejudice againft inoculation is (b deeply rooted here, 
that very little progrefs has as yet been made towards re- 
moving it.

CorreBion, hy tbi Rev. William Strachan.</head> 

<p>In the Statiftical Account of the parifli of Culter, in the 

frcfbytcry of Biggaur, formerly tranfmitted to jrou, it.wai$ 

faid^ that the word Culter was a Latin one, fignifying a 

£oulter or ploughfhare, but on what account fo called un« 

cerfain. This was the only definition I could at that time 

procure, after a variety of enc^uiries at di&amp;rent people, who, 

I fuppofed, might be able to give me information. From 

perfons acquainted with the Gaelic language, I have ilnce 

learned, that Culter is a Gaelic word, and that the fignifica- 

' tion of it is, ' the back, or hinder part, of the land or 

country,' which exaftly defcribes the fituation of the parifh ; 

the county of Lanark terminating with its boundaries on the 

eaft and fouth-eaft, and there adjoining to Tweeddale. A 

}ueftton however here arifes, v4z. Whether this name was 

given before, or fince the divifion into counties took place ? 

But however this may be, I am ailiired, by gentlemen who 

underftand the Gaelic, that the above is the true meaning of 

the name. In confirmation of which, I find that Buchanan, 

in the 6th book of his Hiftory of Scotland, obferves, that 

the country adjoining from the Tay to the Forth was called 

by the antients Rofsy i. e. a ' peninfula *,' and, adds he» 

'^ there are fome figns of the name yet remaining, as C«/. 

^ rofs, a town, which is, as it were * the back^ or hinder 

^ part; of Rofs.'',

tiic river Annan, the central river of Dumfrics-fhire, the 
pariih of Wamphray begins ; and runs downwards, along the 
eaftem bank, ^\ miles : being interfered near the middle by 
Wamphray water ; and bounded by the parifhes of Moffat oH 
the N. ; Kirkpatrick-juxta and Johnfton, from W. to S. W. ; 
Applegarth, on the S. ; Hutton, on the £. } and Etterick on 
the N. E. The breadth varies, from 2 to 4f miles. The 
diftance of the center of the parifh from Edinburgh is 58 
miles ; from Glafgow, 63 miles \ from Dumfries, the county 
town^ 18 miles; from the burgh of Annan, at the river 
mouth, 22 miles ; from Moffat, the neareft market town, 7 
miles ;— reckoning always by the Englifh mile. In all tbcfe

AfpeB and Figure. — The afpect is to the S. W. ; the fi- 
gure, that of an irregular amphitheatre, of which the ftraight 
part is along the river Annan. Thfc fcvel part esttends from 
thence about a mile, to the N. E. 5 and behind it, the travel- 
ler takes notice of two ridges of green hills : the nearer of 
whkh IS nKft)7 araMc ; and the farther, much, higher than 
the other, intermingled with ihort heath, and afibrding ad- 
mirable pafturc for fhcep. From tl-ve heights, the water of 
Wamphray falls down, tlirough deep linns, into the level 
ground ; croiling the great road from Glafgow to Carliflci in 
a gravel bed, and faHing into the Annatt. In this gravel, it 
fometimes difappears *, at other times, it does confiderable 
damage, and even raries terror, cooaing down in floods.— 
From three miles to one mile above the mouth, Wamphraf 
water prclents a beautiful fccnery. Here, it has fhaped out 
ftupcnduoufly deep linns ; the fides of which are fo clofcly 
covered with woods, that it is not feen, except here and 
there, in its rocky courfe, at the bottom. The fall of the 
water has worn the rocks into a number of cafcades. On 
the north brow of the linn are ruins of buildings, where the 
family of Wampliray once refidcd ; and on the oppofits brow 
appears the manfc : the buildings, the tali woods, the deep 
Hnns and water falls forming a fcene Angularly romantic. 
Clumps of trees arc feen in different places throughout the 
parifh ; and to the weftward, the eye marks the happy ^' 
fefts of improvement, in a large plantation of fir trees ; anti 
alfo in the parifh of Johnfton, on a large traA of land, 
which was lately a barren moor, but is now covered with rich 
crops. On the ftme fide are feen the venerable ruins of the 
tower of Lochwood, the old family feat of the lords of An- 
nandale, appearing over the aged trees that farround it.

cd by fudden thaws, or by alternate thaws and frofVfi, injure 
the fbeep flocks : and the injury is the ^greater, becaufe the 
pafture hills are bare of flieltcr ; no large rocks to defend the 
iheep 9 and the woods modly in water courfeSj which are dan- 
gerous under a thaw. It is a thing, in courfe^ to exped our 
Lammas Flood. Winds are feldom hurtful, unlefs they hap- 
pen to catch the ripe corn on hill grounds. A mildewf 
fometimes, though not often, floats on the hokns by Annan 
fide, and hurts the crops. The 26th of Jan. 1794 brought a 
heavy fnow, which, in going off, did great damage to fome 
of our iiore farmers. The grcateft Hood ever rcofiembercd 
was in Auguil 1 797 » yet it was local in a great degree^ and 
the damage lefs than one would have ex]^l€d. We confiJcr 
the climate to be falubrious ; and the. population tables, in fome 
degree, proi?e it .fo. No climate can be fitter f9r the rearing 
4f all kinds, of cattle; violent extremes of heat or cold net 
being much known. 

The rifing of high towering clouds from the fea in the fouth- 
cm horizon, is a received fign of great rain. A light coloured 
vapoury cloud, 4iangiig on the heights of Wainphray, on the 
N. £. is the fign of wind. Tfein fleecy clouds, gatliermg in 
xUt fliv, (Virgil's * tenuia velkra,') arc thought to precede 
rains; the fame is obferved with refpe^t to parallel ranges of

vertical clouds, appearing in perfpedtive, as if they drew to 
a point, at each extremity, and on this account, called hj 
the people, Noah's Ark ; and it is frequently found that the 
wind which follows this appearance, blows dire£tiy acrofs the 
lines formed by the clouds. It is alfb noticed, that even halos 
or circles round the fun, if they extend themfelves, are 
followed by fair weather ; though it is the rcverfe, if they 
contraA and draw near the fun's orb. The falling of the 
mercury in barometers, fuddenly, is generally accompanied 
with an uncommon noife among the crows in Wamphray 
linns, and foul weather fucceeds. We are accommodated 
with two confpicuous weather hills, Criffle to the fouth, and 
Queenfbcrry to the weft. The piercing heights of Skiddav 
Fell in Cumberland, are alfo feen from our high grounds } 
from all which places, the fettlmg vapours give notice of ap- 
proaching rains. 

To accommodate things to the climate of the place, the 
farmer endeavours to have his fown grafs made, and in fum- 
mcr ricks, by the end of July ; leaving the cutting of his 
xneadow grafs till the Lammas rains ceafe. If he fow peafe, 
he chufes the hot feed, to prevent their growing too late. 
He mingles rye grafs with his clover, to help to win it the 
jboner. He fets the ends of all his com ftacks to the foutlu 
And when he has got his com into ftacks, he delays not to 
thatch them. Builders are at pains to lay the ftones, fo as 
to hang a little^ and throw out the rain ; they alio prefer 
that kind of flated roofs, which is done upon laths and all 
the infide rendered with hme. A kind of roof is frequently 
ufed, of thin red freeftone ; but it is heavy ; and unleis the 
ilone be well chofen, and laid fteep enough, it draws through 
the pores, and the rendering falls off. Our fheep farmers 
kave not got into the ufe of circular dykes ; but a planta- 
tion of fir trees, in form of a crofs, anfwers the purpofe muck

better, and this has been tried. To keep out-lyixig bhck 
cattle in condition, coarfe hay is put up in fmall inclofures, 
near their paftures, and from thchce the farmer feeds them 
as he fees neceflary. Potatoes aro preferved without much 
difficulty, in pits, or in low houfes, all the year round. 

It would be well if we were as attentive to the conftitution 
and temperament of the body as to the produce of the earth j 
but all the feafons find us in the ufc of the fame dreft ; and 
hence it is cafy to account for the frequency of rheumatifms* 
The drefs which is warm enough in winter, is certainly too 
warm for fummer. Perhaps it is worth notice, that huiband^ 
ry implements, though high priced, and generally good, are 
little attended to ; the climate is left to work its effefts upon 
them, and aAually defiroys more of them than the culture 
of the earth. 

&amp;»/. — The foil is of three kinds, ift. The deep holmt 
along the courfe of Annan; an excellent pafture foil, and 
with plenty of manure, yielding rich crops ; but it is greedy 
of manure, which is eafily accounted for. Tlie level appear- 
ance of the(e holms, and their fituation, indicate that they 
31^ depofits formed by the river ; and the light colour, and 
loofenefs of the foil, give reafon to fufped an over mixture 
tf fand, or broken particles of freeftone. Let it alfo be ob- 
ferved, that the floods of this river, are fuddenly down from 
the hills, and bring little or no richnefs along, to fertilize 
the depofits made by it. 

2dly, We have a light loam, of difitrent fhades, from a 
Wght red colour, to a dark brown, or even black. This 
light foil is good, and it amply returns all the kinds of ma- 
nure which arc given it ; but without manure it has no great 
ftrcngth. The bright tinge is probably given it by the under 

ftrata;

for fale, but it is of ewe milk ; and this article will probabij 
foon wear out, the trouble, ^xpence, snd liurt -to tlie ftocks 
leing above the returns of it. Oats arc the chief of oar grain; 
barley next ; then peafe. Wheat and beans are otdy on trisJ

extent ; and they arc as furc a crop, and as pcrfeft of their 
kinds, as the foil bears. Flax is only an inferior article, not 
being fo\vn as a crop. Cabbage b very little tried. We arc 
pcftcrcd of late with a fpccics of annual rye grafs, ivhich 
grows well for one year, and then dies out. 

The confiiroption of our cattle ftocks at home is incon- 
siderable, in comparifon with what b fold ; moft of the fat 
ufcd in ihc pariih-' being brought in from other places. Of 
late, however, there is a method creeping in, of fattening 
aged ewes on turnip, which feems to anfwer well. With re- 
fpcft to crops, a great proportion of them is condimed at 
home. And the farmers depend upon their young cattle and 
their barley, together with moft of their fown hay, and 
whatever quantity they can fell of oats or oatmeal, to make 
up their rents and pay expcnce of management. 

The returns from rich pafturc are good. Moft of the land 
inclines to run into white clover, with a mixturo of red and 
yellow; alfa rib-grafi, daify, and other indigenous plants, 
which we. ought to uie in fowing out land, though it is to 
be regretted that we ao not often do our land this juftlce. 
There is a fpecics of grafs, which appears naturally, mingling 
with the fown grafs, fucculent in the ftalk, and bearing a 
Kght ear like a foxtail y but after a year or two, it difap- 
pears, the white clover fpreading its knots over the whole 
foil. 

TTie woods produce very little, though they are really of 
confidcrabie value. Excellent oalcs, afhts, and elms, with a 
few birches and mountain afl)es, cover the declivities of the 
water courfes. We have alfo a good deal ©f planted firs, 
but moftiy young for fale. The whole might eafily be mad© 
to produce lool. a year, permanently. But the principal he- 
ritor, out of a liberal view towards the public. good^ has hi^

The £fliing$ in this parifli are hardly worth mentioning 
though indeed they are in no degree preferved or attended 
to. Minerals are, at prefent, of no account. But there is 
a great deal of freeftone, very accefiible ; and though inferior 
in quality at the top, it may improve. We have a great deal 
of excellent fhell marl, which may be opened up at a trifling 
ej;;pence ; and every perfon of obfervation reckons on thefe 
as future articles of importance towards the general produce 
of the parifh. With refpeA to manufaAures, we have no- 
thing to reckon upon except fome coarfe cloths and linens, 
to the value of 200I. or from that to 300L a year, grown, 
Ipun, made, and worn, within the parifh. 

ilf^/7i/rrx.— -Lime is the chief article, at prefent, under 
this head. Nothing anfwers our old ley ground fo welL Six 
carts, of hot fh^ls, containing each 15 (leeks of the Win- 
chefler bufhel, are laid on an acre. The approved, way is to 
fcatter it on the furface of old ley ground, and break it next 
feafon ; the next method is to icatter the lime on the drills, 
with a green crop, and incorporate it into the foil by the 
plough and harrows. The former method gives the earlieft 
profit, in rich crops of oats ; the other is the beft method to 
cnftire good grafs after the green fallow, and to leave the foil 
out, in heart. 

Mod of the dung goes to the potatoe crop \ fome is ufed 
for turnip, or for barley. We begin to dillike the old prac- 
tice of fpreading dung upon pafhu-e land, and plowing down 
for oats. On meadow, duly drained, it repays largely. 

Compofts of lime and earth aret^ly trying yet \ but it is 
eafy to fee that they will foon become common. 

The carriage of the lime (19 miles) is equal to the prime 
coft ; and altogether, an acre cofb 3I. to lime it \ which is a

faeavj drawback on the value of the lands. When the marie 
pits are opened up» much will be faved to the parlfh. 

Rttntionsj"^ altnoft blufli to mentidn theft. A favourite 
^lece of convenient land has a great deal of indulgence fhewu 
it, when it is put imder the following^ viz. after manure, 3 
crops of oat^ ; dung and drilled potatoes ; nny, twice or 
thrice cut» and 2 or 3 years pa(hire» This as fcvere enoughj 
as potatoes the only meliorating crop in the rotation, are 
fufpe£ted to be an ezhaufting crop, though they clean the 
foil. Bnt the greater part of the land, after lime, gives 3 or 
4 crops of oats.; an4 i$ then left o.ut, quite bare of grafs, and 
poor, to ftock itfelf the beft way it can. Lime is at prefent 
a new manure, and does wonders ; but our foM yrill not 
ftand repetkions of thefe rotations. 

Seed and Returns. '^'^Vhz quantity of oats giycn to an acre, 
Annandale meafure, is of!e I^inlithgow boll and a half, in 
iced. The Annandale acre is larger than the Scots acre, in 
the proportion of 153 to 137* or nearly as 15 to i j. The 
returns, in oats, average four feeds, or 6 bolls, cr 1 2 Carlillc 
bufliels per acre. Barley frequently fiiils to return as amply^ 
as common bear. Early peafc do pretty well. Beans and 
wheat are fcarcely to be conddered in another light than ;is 
ftrangers, not yet naturalized. Early white oats are uiid, and 
in rich land they do well. On the heights they fliakc j the 
ftraw is iaferior fodder, compared with that of the common. 
oats ; and they exhauft the foil more ; but tliey divide the 
labour ; and in a moift fcafon thf y (land better than common 
oats. 

The heft changes of feed that we get, are from the Clyde, 
the Tweed, or the Teviot.

Mode of CMvation.^'Xhts being our principal crop wc 
confume great part of winter and fpring in ploughing for 
them, and getting them into the foil i beginning ploughing, 
with the cleaneft land, to prevent it growing into weeds 
againft the feed-time. Potatoe and turnip land is crols 
ploughed early in winter, to mellow it, for laying up in diills 
at the proper feafon. Peafe are fown hot-fiir. Summer fal- 
low is not much tried. The plough is Scots ; drawn by two 
horfes. Carts, harrows, ai^d all the iqipleoients of huflnnd- 
ry, are light. 

JFiyJIf.— Land which has been long in cultivation is voy 
tbul. Annuals infeft it, and deftroy the crops ; of this kind 
arc gule, wild-kail, day-nettle, charlock, mugwort. Tode- 
Aroy thefe, we lay out the lands. The annuals difaj^pear 
dire£lly after ; but thiftles, knot and quick grafs, and crow- 
foot, remain for two or tliree feafons, and then difappear al- 
fo. The lands incline to ftock themfclyes with .clovers, dai- 
fy, ribwort, and other grailes ; and the pafture continues 
good for years in rich parts of the land i but on dry Ully 
paftures, fog or mofs foon encroaches, deflroys the grafi, and 
forces the farmer to break the ground, unlefs he has the 
command of water to fcattcr over it. Whins and broom 
are alfo very ordinary intruders in warm dry foil i and 
rufli, in wet grounds. 

In thefe remarks, I allude to land, which is left out with- 
out a green fallow -, for this operation cleans it well, and 
the grafs feed comes up unmixed. 

It is remarked that grccn-fallow dcftroys the gulc more 
cffeftually than red-fallow. Wc are too indolent in dcftroys 
ing feeding weeds before they fhed ; and alfb in laying up 
root weeds to the froft. It is an ordinary niiiftake, when 
land is l^d out in fown graft, to be too fparing of pafture 

feeds,

land filling with weeds when the hay crops are done out. 
A fimilar ncgleft is committed when oatlands are left out 
to pafbircy for it is very feldom that our farmers are at 
the trouble of fcattcring common hay feed on them, 2k 
Hiight be eafily done, and much to their advantage. Thefe

have been no lefs than {e,^tn mmifters; viz. Mr Irvine^ 
MefTrs Barclay, fenior, and junior, the latter of whom died 
lately in the miniftry of Haddington ; Dr Barron^ removed to 
St Andrews ; Dr WilUamfpn, removed to Glafgow College ; 
and Mr Donaldfoo, who retired, and in 1^794 was replaced 
by the prefent inctimbent. A minifter of Wamphray, of the 
name of John Brown, who lived in 1659, ^^ ^^^^ (otx^ writ-* 
ings which are in high eftimation here. 

The depoiitlon of Mr Taylor was partly founded on • 
charge of akering the marches of hb glebe, and partly on 
other grounds^. He was an enemy to the revolution and to 
jurant miniders. His temper, as to politics, feems to have 
been the fame with Archbifhop Sahcroft's ; and it had the 
fame ifllie. Mr Taylor joined the Cameronians, was much 
followed, and died rich. He was conne£ted with other fepa^ 
ratifks from the church, McMillan at Balmaghie, Hepburn at 
Orr, and Gilchrift at Dunfcore, who formed themfelves into 
a preibytery of FroCefters;,, and drew down an AA and refer- 
ence of the General Aflcmbly againft them in 1715. S« 
flrong was Mr Taylor's party, after his depofition, that it was 
neceflary for Mr Johnfton, the fteward-depute of Annandale» 
to appear in arms at the church, and open a way to thofe 
who preached by authority in his placCii 

The glebe is not well afcertained^ and there does not 
Jeem to be any authentic document for defining it, except

cows and their followers. 

ficAoo/.— -The teacher does not undertake Latin : but no 
man can be more attentive^ and few are more fuccefsful, in 
fo far as he profefles. The average number of fcholars is no. 
The falary is 150 merks Scots; the fees of teaching are about 
lol. There is no yard attached to the fchooL The heritors 
are handfomely acquiefcing in a petition to the court of fup- 
ply for 50 merks augmentation to the falary ; and what will 
the emolonients amount to when this is granted ? This will 
be very inadequate after all : but the heritors having done 
this, will be admitted to have done as much as the law can 
poffiUy demand of them } and if there be any thing wanting 
after this, the defeA muft be in the law itfelf. 

The law is not defc6iive, however, if we attend to the true 
fpirit of it. Statute law fixes a falary ; and confuetudinary 
law fettlti the fees of teaching. Thefe different ibiu*ces of 
tmolument, when wifely adjuiledi have good effefts : the fa- 
Ivy engages a refpeAable teacher ; the fees encourage him to 
be diligent. Such was the conftitution which our forefathers 
planned out for our parochial feminaries ; and fo long as the 
law retained its true fpirit^ the wifdom of this plan was fcea 
in its effe^. That fpirit is now loft ; and inftead of it, we 
have oiily the deald letter. 

I have in view the Aft of Endowment, 6to Gul. Let any 
one take notice of the real value of the merks at that time, 
and fay what proportion they bear now. Did Parliament in* 
tend the real value of the merks» for our public teachers, or 
Ac nominal Value ? It would caft diflionour upon the legif* 

lature, 



454 General JppetkSx to 

lature, to fuppoile that they intended any thing under the 
real value of the merks ; and this value is beft afcertained 
by turning them into grain. Now, I do not find that Far^ 
liament had altered the legal converficti when they pafled the 
above aA. From 1561 to 1633, ^^ thereafter, the hun- 
dred merks was equivalent to a chalder, in the aAs of Parlia'* 
ment : we muft therefore be of opinion, that the parochial 
falaries were intended to be equivalent to from one to two 
chalders. llbis was doubtlefs what the legiflature propofed 
for them. But, unfortunately their falaries were all modified 
in money^ which has fallen in value out of all proportion* 
and if this had been adverted to, or forefeen, by thoie who 
framed the A£l of Endowment) it is not merely probable, 
but morally certain, that they would have ordered the fala« 
r!cs in grain, and not money. May it not be aiked^ What 
fhoiild hinder an explanatory a£t, to this purpofe, fliU ? A 
chalder for every hundred merks. falary, which our paro€htal 
teachers now poflefs, would reflore them, fb far as the f:darj 
goes, to the enjoyment of thofe livings, which the Revolution 
gave, by ftatute, to their predeceflbrs. It would aUb reflore 
the wholefome fpirit of that law^ do juftice to a ufeful ordet 
of men, and, through them, to fociety at large ; and oontri* 
bute eilentially to the improvement of youth in found morals, , 
and in that fort of learning which is both ufeful and cvna* 
mentaL 

It would then be neceflary, Only, to regulate the tecs el 
tetiching ; and a fimilar rule would determine this alfo. Thcf 
ought to be augmented as money fglls in value : which would 
][revent learning from being undervalued, encourage th£ 
teacheir to afiiduity, and fHmulate parents and youth to make 
the moft of their time ; a real fervice to all concerned. 

It IS nnnfenfe to pfopofe getting folid learning at the ge- 
nerality of our parochial ichools^ at prefent. The privily

•f attaining to this is denied to country pariihes ; and has 
become almoft exclufively the property of refidenters in 
towns or large villages. But, are the youch reared there 
more virtuous than in the country ? Is the fear of God, and 
a due regard to moral duties, as generally and afliduouily in- 
culcated in thofe crowded feminaries, as it vras once in our 
parochial fchools, and would ftill be, were they on their an- 
cient £boting ? 

' A fmattering of learning does harm. This, however, is al* 
ways frequent, in crowded feminaries, where individuals are 
not clofely attended to. If it be found in country fchools, 
it is owing to the cheapnefs of teaching, or to the teacher 
liimfelf ; and the improvement propofed, or rather the rc- 
ftoration of our parochial fchools, would ferve efTentially to 
prevent this abufe of learning. 

Very few of the parochial fchools in this diftrift are le- 
gally filled by authority of prefbjrtery \ nor is it ufual, either 
^ for vifitors or prefbyteries, to infpeA them regularly : pa|*ent9, 
alfo, pay them little or no attention : and it is. really furpri- 
fing that, under tbefe circumftances, we have any attentive 
teachers among us. Tlie youth (who are the fpring) being 
thus negleAed, what is to become of the year ?— Did any of 
thofe lawgivers, who, at the diftance of an hundred years 
ago, made provifion for the difiiifing of found learning, 
without the abufe of it, and of inculcating generally, and 
with efieil, the principles of facred and civil duties, now 
defcend to viflt us, and to enquire into the event of thofe 
wife provifions ; would he not find the fpirit of them gone ? 
He would fee every thing elfe on an improving plan, and 
all orders in fociety augmented ; but on enter ing one of our 
parochial fchools, and enquiring after the infpedlion of 
youth, I blufh to think what feiitiments he would form with. 
relpeA to this boafled age. of improvement.

Poar^ J Funds. "-^Tht general lift contains ao names; of

gard to the prefent circumftances of thofe who fkare them; 
and not) as is done eliewhere, in equal portions. The funds 
arife from the intereft of a bond of 47I.; from collefdons; 
from fines, and mortcloth money : the whole not amounting 
to lol. a-year. But the heritors have given in feveral hand-, 
fome donations ; the Earl of Hopetoun, principal heritor, has 
^fo given money apart from the public aileiSnents ; the far« 
mers of the parifli turned over a balance that was due them, 
on account of ftore meal, to the poors' funds: and, one way 
or other, the poor have, hitherto, been pretty well attoided 
to. It was much to the honour of the heritors of Wamphray, 
that though the parlfh was years without an elder, and with- 
out any public colleAions worth mentioning, the poor were 
not negledled, as the heritors provided for them. It maj 
alfo be remarked, that no difiioAion is made among the 
poor, except that of their feveral neceflities : difienters are as 
equally ferved, as thofe who belong to the eftabliflied church. 
It were much to be wifhed, that difiienting congregations

is made for their keeping. In valuing th^ oM^ regard (bpuld 
bb had to what thej are worth* ftanding \ and the white fod- 
der indemnifies future trouble; 

The other method tf compuCaticm ptoceeds i^KNi what is 
Ibted page 447, viz. that the fanncn depend upon tbei^ 
^oung cattle and their harky together with moft of their 
fbwn hayv and whatever oats or oatmeal tbcj cm fpare^ la 
iti'ake up their rents, and pay expence of management. This 
xpethod allov^ a charge ujpon aU money advancedy but gives 
■o allowance fiar boards nor for keeping of horib or cattle. 
It adrnfts all kiiid&amp; of family expences in fo £ur 93 the familj 
a&amp;ft in the management of the farm, and gives the per centage^ 
not only on ftock and uteniils, but upon faoufehotd fiirni- 
Mre \ including an allowance to the farmer^ as dn;^ wages^r 
but Bo board ; incidental lab&amp;ur, and charges^ for Ume being

ihe other method; As they are both founded in the minute

obfenration of fa£b) they cannot, if accurately adhefcd td^ 
differ widely. 

Let it alfo be remarked, that the a£hial valae of the land^ 
does not certainly appear by chefe computations ; only the 
prefent value is (hewn, according to the method of farming 
that obtains, anno 1798. Another mode of iarming, and 
other times, may occafion a total alteration* When this oc- 
. curs, it will be curious to look back, and trate the modes of 

1798. 

It will be feen that the charges of farming are tery heavy- 
ih this parifh, and the expence of manure a heavy drawback 
dn the lands. On the other hand, the lands; admit of great 
improvement ; and as the foil is fuperior in qu^ity, no ex- 
pence laid out in improving is thrown away. In the courie of 
time, there is no doubt that the lands in Wamphray will rife 
confiderably in their value. At leaft a thoufand acres more 
df good foil will be improved \ and it is hoped the method 
of exhauding white crops will give place to a better, and 
good paftuf^ furface become an objef): to all concerned.

Aivantagis and D^advaniages.^^TLh€ road hom Glafgov 
to Carlifle runs through the parifli of Wamphray and is of 
eflential fervice to it. The vkinity of Engliih markets is 
convenient for difpofing of cattle and iheep. The charadkr 
of the people, which is favourable to indufby and economy^ 
and the nature of th^ ibtl» which is akooft every where good 
and kindlyi up to the hill tops, together with the warm fa^ 
vourable expofure, are all in favour of the pariih* What be- 
nefits may be reaped from the marie and freeftone, time on- 
ly can determine. We have two threfhing mills in the pa- 
rifli ; one going by water,, the other moved by horfts. Whien 
thefe ufeful machines can be conftniAed at fuch a moderate 
expence, as to be within the farmer's ireach, the advantage 
will be very great. A better fort of milk cattle would cer- 
tainly be eflentially ufeAil ; and perhaps it would be advan- 
tageous on fome farms to alter the flieep ftock, and intm- 
duce a kind having better wool. QuarrieB of whinflone mi^^ 
probably be got in the hills, for fences tgainft Cheep; as 
moft of the hedges are almoft deftroyed by the trefptfles of 
cattle, and the tabour of upholding any other fence than a 
ilone dyke is much againft it. A few yearrs will ^)ente a 
change in moft of tfaefe particidarff* it has hitherto been 
much for the odvahtage of this parifli that great part of it 
was ih the hands of the Earl of Hopeton. When hia Lard- 
fhip ihall thbk proper to dHpofe of hh tib/Mc eflate berci 
there is not one tenant on his lands (hat wii be out of 
mourning. • - r, -^ 

The great drawbacks, are tfae.dsAMlcii^frMl the iime and 
coals ; the fcardty of good peat ; and'ckarth and diffieidty of 
getting labourers and fervants« I may add the want of a 
good flax mHl; to encourage the ^rowtti of that ariidc. But 
what people are in poflef&amp;on of every advmtage ? We have 
enough^ if we improve it, and are duly thank6il to the Au- 
thor of nil our coni&amp;rt3.

nal of aboot 4 feet deep* and % feet broad, is fuppofed fuffi-

be dinAed through a ietd ccttntff (, inibmuch, that for a 
fpaee of 12 of 14 miles no lock would be necefiar3r. Still 
the expence of fodi an undertalttng muft be coniideraUe, 
and might amount to ibont 30,oooL 

Before ezpefting a matter of this magnitude to be patro* 
i'ifed| either bjr the heritors in the immediate vicinity of the 
canal, or bj the public at large, it is neeeflaty to exhibit a 
tiew of ibme of thofe advantages which would naturally re* 
fult from the completbn of it : with that defign, what fol- 
lows is fubmitted. 

That part of Perthfliire called Strathem, through whidi 
the canal would run^ is a beanofol and fertile country, capa- 
^ of great improvement. It is furroonded with high lands 
aud glens, which are extremely populous. The foiU in fome 
parts, is well adapted for railing grain, but, in general, pecu- 
liarly fitted for railing green crops. It is naturally a wooded 
country, and well watered with rivers from, the furrounding 
hills and lakes. All kinds "tJ timber, particularly fir, larch* 
oak and a(h, grow to great perfeftion. The people are fo- 
^r and induftrious. 

Under thefe circmnftances, ft is certainly a matter of great 

ojoment to open a communication, by means of good roads

.Tay flde^ fa«hat» in this auinner,.a complete communicatioli

tioned in the Appendix to vol. xx. page 87, note ; namelf, 
by aicertainin^; the proportion the real rent bore tp the valui- 
cd rent in the different pariihes, from whence returns of 
thefe particulars were made, and extending that rate of pro- 
portion to the total valuation of each county. In two or three 
counties, however, a deviation was made from that gencrd 
rule of computation, owing to peculiar circumftan^es affeA- 
ing thefc diAri^. As the real rent of feveral parifbes has 
conilderably increafed fince the ftatiftical accounts of theoi 
were drawn up, the total rental of Scotland (exdufive of 
houfes) muft now exceed - - L. 2,500,000

of 25s. to each family, and eftimatin^ the nvm-

The Statifiical Account. 473 

In peru&amp;ig the foregoing table, It is impoflibl^ to avoid 
remarking the different proportions the real' rent bears to 
the valued rent in different counties \ a circumftance owing 
to the valuitibn of fome bounties haying been taken at later 
periods than that of others \ to improvements in agriculture % 
and to the introduAion of manufaAures« In the manufa£hir» 
ing county of Dunbarton the real rent is more than twelve 
times, and of Renfrew more than eleven times the valued 
rent, while in the paftoral counties of Roxburgh and Sel- 
kirk, the real rent is not much above four times the valued 
rent. But a difcuifion of thefe particulars belongs properly 
to the Analyfis of the Statiftical Account of Scotland, which 
the Author hopes he will liave leifure to complete in the 
courie of the preient year* 



In the tables of the population of Scotland, VoL xx, p. 
S99, the number of inhabitants in Dumfries parifh was by 
miftake ftated at 5600, the number in the town, inftead of 
7006, the number in town and country. The ftate of Dum« 
friesflure with refpeA to population will therefore ftand 
thus :

While thefe iheets^ Were in the preis, a letter was receiv-

MATION. 

• Ongif^'^^At the requcft of King James II. Pope Nicolas 
V. granted a Bull, conftituting a ^^Jludium generali^ tarn in 
'* theologiay ei in jure cancnum et civilly quam in artihus, ei 
*' in qtiocunque licita fikcultate^ to continue in all tiroc to 
come in the city of Glafgow; as being a notable place, and 6t 
for the purpofci by the temperature of the air, and the plenty 
of all kinds of provifions for human life : and, by his apolloli- 
cal authority, ordained, That its doflors, mailers, readers, and 
ftudents fliali enjoy all the priviltrgcs, liberties, honours* ct- 
emptions, and immunities granted to the Jludium generak ol 
his city of Bononia. He likewife appointed William Turn- 
bull, then bifhop of Glafgow, and his fucceflbrs in that fee, 
to be the reflOTs, called chanqellors, of tlie (Aidjludium ; and 
to have the fame authority orcr the doftors, mafters, and 
fcholars, as the reftors have in the Sludium Bononifn/e.-^ThiM 
Bull is dated at Rome the 7th of the month of January 1450, 
and the fourth year of his pontificate. 

E/lai/i/bment.^^By the care of tlie bifliop and his chapter, 
a body of (latutes was prepared, and an univerfity eftabliflied, 
in the year 1451 : confiftlng, beGdcs the chancellor,, of a rec- 
tor, do£lors, and mafters of the four faculties, who had taken 
their degrees in other univerfities -, and ftudents, who, after a 
courfe of ftudy and examination, prefcribed by their fcvcral 

fciculties, might' be promoted to academical degrees. That 

this inftitution might open with the greater celebrity, tlie bi- 
fliop had procured and publi(hed a Bull from the. Pope, grant- 
ing an univerfal indulgence to all faithful Chriftians, who (hould 
Vifit the cathedral cjiurch of Glafgow, in the year 145 1.— We 



of the Univerjiiy of Glafgow. 5 

have.no account of the fokmnity and ceremony of tbe fir ft 
qftabliQiment ; but it appears that David Caozow, licentiate 
in canon-law, and canon of Glafgow, was the firft re^or, (pro- 
bably appointed by the bifliop)^ and that he was, by eltclion, 
continued in 1452. There are more than 100 members men- 
tioned, as incorporated by him in thefe two years ; aod mod of 
them not young men, but fecular or regular ccclcfiaftics, ca« 
nons, rcftors, vicars, and prcfbyters, abbots, priors, and monks* 
Andrew Stewart, brother to King James II. was incor- 
porated in 1456, being then fub-dean of Glafgow. 

Exemptions,^^^T\it clergy would perhaps be the more diC- 
pofed to attend the Univerfity, as, while they were incorpo- 
rated members, they were, by royal charters and a£ls of Par- 
liament, exempted from all taxes and public burdens. And 
Bp.TuRNBULL, io the year 1453, ordained, That the beneficed 
clergy in hi^ diocefe, who were regents or ftudents in his uni- 
verfity, or willing to ftudy while they were teachable, (hould, 
upon aflcing his licence, be exempted from refidcnce in their 
cures, providing they took care to have the religious offices du- 
ly performed. 

Royal Ciarier.-^King James Il.sin the year 1453* ** ^^ ^^* 
quvft of Bp. Turnbull, granted a charter in favour of the Uni- 
verfity of Glafgow ; by which the redor, the deans of the fa- 
culties, the procurators ofthtfoar nat'tQttSy the mailers, regents^ 
Vid fcholars, ftudy ing in the fiid Univerfity, providing they .

Privileges and Ptw^rx.— The fame privilege wa8 renewed 

^7 



f Statijiical utf count 

by fubfequcnt fovcrcigns, and confirmed by a&amp;s of Parlia- 
ment. And even in taxes of an 8th part of all ecclefiafiical 
livings, for the defence of the nation againft ai\ invafion of 
the Engliih, the clergy in the Univerfity of Glafgow, on plead- 
ing their privilege, were exempted. This right, of exemp- 
tion from taxation, was pleaded by this Univerfity before the 
Lords of Council and SeiEon, on the aoth of N6vember 1633, 
and was fuftaincd. 

To thefe privileges, which the b;fhops of Glafgow obtained 
from the Cro^n and Parliament, they added others which 
were in their own power, in confcquencc of the ample cifil 
and criminal jurifdiAion, which they pofTeiTed within their 
own diocefe; to wit. The privilege of buying, felling, and 
tranfporting provifions, within the jurifdidlion of the bi(bop, 
free of tolls and cuftoms ; — the fixing the rent of houfes or 
lodgings, poflefled by perfons belonging to the univerfity, by 
a jury, the one half citizens, the other half perfons belong- 
ing to the Univerfity ;-^thc obliging the magifirates of Glaf- 
gow, upon their eleflion, to fwear that they fliall obfervc, 
and caufe to be obfer%xd, the immunities, liberties, and fta- 
tutes of the Univerfity ; — the granting tlie reflor the neit 
place, in precedence to the bi(hop, in all ceremonies and 
ptoceffions; — the granting the privileges of incorporated mem- 
bers to all the fervants.of the Univerfity; — thz felf-denjing 
claufe in the chancellor's oath, and which ftill makes a daufe 
ini it, — ** Se nihil in academic negoiiis Jine moderatorum et ma^ 
" gifirorum ajjentione Untaiurum ;^ — and particularly, the grant- 
ing to the re£lor, at firft, the jurifdi£iion in all civil and pe- 
cuniary queftions, refpediing members of the Univerfity, and 
in crimes lefs atrocious ; and afterwards, the extending it to 
all caufes and crimes whatfoever : — The power, alfo, cf in- 
fli£^ing ecclefiaftical ccnfure, even that of excommunica- 
tion. 

Capital 



of the Univerjtty of GJafgow. ^ 

Capital Trial. — ^There is, howeTcr, only one indance on 
record of a capital trial before the redor's court \ and tlyit fo 
late as the year 1670. That year, Robert Bartoune, a 
fludent, was indided for murder, before Sir William Fl£E« 
MiNGi reAor; but was acquitted by the jury. 

II. ANaENT Constitution* 

The conftitution of this learned body will appear, by tak« 
ing a view of the parts into which it was divided, and th^ 
powers and obligation^ of each. 

I. EkSion of Office-Bearers^ iffc. — The whole incorporated 
members, ftudents, as well as doflors and matters, were di- 
vided into four parts, called the ^uatwr Nathnes, according 
to the place of their nativity. The whole realm of Scotland, 
and the Ifles, was diftinguiihed into four diftri&amp;s, under the 
names of C/ydefdale, Teviotdakj Albany^ and Rothefay* A meet- 
ing of the whole Univeifiiy was annually called, on the day 
next after St. Crifpin's day. This meeting was called the 
Congregatio Univerfitatis : and, being divided into the four na- 
tions, each nation, by itfelf, chofe a procurator and an in- 
trant i and the intrants, meeting by themfclvcs, made choice 
of a redor and a deputaius of each nation, who were afliftants 
and afleflbrs to the redor. 

FunSlions* — ^Tbe reclor and dcputati had feveral fundions. 

ift, They were judges in all civil and criminal caufes, where- 
in any member of the Univerfity was a party. Every member, 
who either fucd or anfwered before any other court, was guil- 
ty of perjury, and incurred the penalty of expulfion. The 
eecleGaftics in the Univerfity, to whatever diocefe they be- 
longed^ could not be called before their rural deans. 

2dly, 



j5 Stattjlical Account 

2dly, All members were incorporated by the rcftor and 
fjeputatif after taking an oath to obey the reftor and his fuc- 
ceflbrs, to obfcrvc the ftatutes, and prefcrve the privileges of 
the Univerfity, and not to reveal its fecrets to its prejudice, to 
whatever Ration they ihould arrive. 

3dly, The redlor and deputati were the council of the Unl* 
verficy ; who deliberated upon, and digefted all matters to te 
brought before the congregation of doflors and matter. And 
tlic determinations of the do£lors and matters, in fuch cafes, 
were accounted, in rcfpeft of authority, next to the ftatutev 
— Sometimes the congregatio univerfttatis was called occafion- 
ally for weighty matters ; fuch as, the making or repealing of 
ftatutes, or for an embilTy to the higher powers, in name of 
the Univerfity. In fuch cafes, each nation chofe three or four 
deputatii who were joined with the reftor and his deputati^ to 
tranfa^ the bufinefs committed to them. 

Two other office-bearers were chofen annually, on the mor» 
row after St. Crifpin's day ;— a hurfarius^ who kept the univer* 
fity-purfe, and accounted for what he receiyed and expended j 
and 7i prcmoior^ whofe office was to fee that the ftatutes were ob- 
ftrred, and to bring delinquents before the reftor's court, 
which had power to enforce the ftatutes, or to difpenfc with 
them in cafes that were not declared to be indifpeqfibl^, 

II. Faculi'us, — A fecond divifion of the UnivcrGty was into 
its ii'\ff^vtnt faculties. The Pope's Bull mentions four by name; 
to wit, Theology^ Canon Law^ Civil LaWf TiXid the Arts, All 
others are comprehended in a general claufe, et in quacunqw 
iicita facultate. In the dark ages, the profeffions of theolo- 
gy, canon and civil law, were called the three learned pro- 
feffions; as being the only profeffions in which learning was 
expected or thought neceflary. They fitted men for the moft 
honourable and luc^rative employments j for the higheft d^- 

pitici 



d/' the XJfdverJity of Glafgoiii. 7 

flUl.-s in the church; for the councils of kings ; for the offi- 
ces of judges at home ; and of ambafladors to foreign courts* 
To train men to eminence, in theft profeflSons, was the firft in- 
tention of univerfities. The Arts, under which was compre- 
hended logic, phyfica, and morals, were confidcrcd as a neccC* 
fary introduftion to the learned profeflions 5 and, chcreforej 21 
acceflkry part of ftudy in every univerfity- 

Their Plan. — The plan, upon which univerfities wCrC" in- 
corporated by the Popes, wis very like to that of incorporated 
towns and boroughs, and perhaps was borrowed from it. The 
univerGry correfponds to the whole incorporation of the bo- 
rough : the different faculties to the diff:;rcnt companies of 
the trades, or crafts, into which the borough is divided. A 
company is a fmaller incorporation, fubcrdinate to that of the 
borough : has the power of choofing its own head, or deacon ; 
and an authority over thofe who are in the coiirfe of being 
trained to the fame craft. The companies, in the incorporated 
towns, were anciently called collegia^ or colleges; and the 
whole incorporation, comprehending all the corap.inics, was 
CiUttd the univerfttas of that town- Thefe names were, by 
analogy, applied to corporations of the learned profcfllons, 
and at laft appropriated to them. — The word ufed in Pope 
NicoLAb* Bull is not univerfttas hut fudium generale ; and the 
tiniverfiry of Bononia he calls StuJium Bononknfe : but, in the 
charter of King James II. in 1453, ^^ have— ^/wj univerf'^ 
tis Glajguenfisj filia noflra dileBom 4 

Government, — ^I'he government of a faculty was very fimilar 
to that of the Univerfity. E.Kh faculty had its own ftatules, 
determining the time of ftudy, and the cxcrcifes and exami- 
l^aiions rcquifitc for attaining degrees in that faculty. Each 
•hofe annually its own dean, its own iurfarius, and fome- 

lime9 



8 Statijlical' Account 

times four ieputati as a council to the dean. — Wc know vcty 
little of the three higher faculties in this Uaivcrfity, as there 
is no record extant^ either of their ftatutes 9r of their tran- 
fa£libns. There are only two memorandums relating to them 
in the UniverGty record. In the firft we arc told, that, oa 
the apihof July 1460, the venerable David Cadzow^ thca 
redior of the Univerfity, began, in the chapter houfe of the 
predicant friars, the clergy and matters being there convened, 
to read the rubric in the canon law, de vita et boneftate chn-^ 
co^um ; and that he continued according to the pleafure of the 
heasers : and that, on the fame day, and in the fame place, 
William db LevenaX began a title in the civil law. Bat 
wo are not told how long it pleafed the hearers that thcfe 

ledures (hould be continued. In another memorandum 

we are told, that, on the 23d of March, in the year 152 1, 
Robert Lile, bachelor in theology, and prior of the convent 
of predicant friars in Glafgow, began, pro format to read a 
Icflure, on the fourth book of the fentences, in the monaftery; 
in prefente of the reftor, dean of faculty, and the reft of the 
matters ; John Ade, profcflbr of theology, and provincial of 
the order in Scotland, prefiding at the time* 

III. Degrees.-^A third divifion was according to the ac*» 
dcmical degree of every member. The higheft degree in the- 
ology, canon and civil law, was that of DoSor j and in the 
^rts, that of Mafier. In fome univerfitics, Maften of ArU 
are called DoBors of Philofopby ; but in moft they arc diflin- 
guiflied, by the name of Mafter^ from thofc who have the 
Kigheft degree in any of die higher faculties. A matter, how« 
ever, might be chofen to be re£tor, or a deputatm^ "zs weU as 
doAor. — In all the faculties, there were two degrees by which 
a man rofe to the higheft : Thefe were Bachelor and Ucen* 
' tiate. The degree of LicentiatCj as well as that of DoAor oc 

flatter. 



of the Unrverjity of Qhfgoniii 9 

iSafter, was conferred only by the chancellor or vice-chancek 
jdr. The requifites to all the degrees was a certain time of 
ftudy, and the having^ heard certain books .prele£ted upon^ 
And certain exerdfes and examinations : in Bachelors of th6 
Arts 15 yean of nge^ and in Mailers 10* It was forbidden^ 
under a heavy penalty, to give any man the title of Mafter 
by Word of writing, who had not attained that degree ( and 
the penalty was ftill more heavy if arty man took it to him- 
fclf before he had lawfully obtained it— Academical degrees 
were coniidered as of divim indltution, (probably becaufe in* 
ftituted by Popes, who were thought to be infpired by the 
Holy Crhufl;) ; and, therefore, the chancellor or vice-chancel- 
lor conferred them authoritate dMna, et in mmine Patris^ Fi* 
i'ttj et Spirit&amp;i Sanffi, 

IV. Teacihg.-^Thc laft divifion we (hall mention « is intd 
teachers^ and thofe who were taugit.-^On this part of the con* 
ftittttion the records, that are extant, leave us much in the 
dark. We know that four faculties w^re eflablifhed ; becaufe^ 
in the oath taken by matters of arts, they fwore to promote 
peace among the four facuttieSj efpecially with the faculty of 
theology. A fchool of canon law is mentioned as being in ■ 
difrepair, and to be repaired out of the univerfity putfe j and 
it appears that degrees were conferred bt)th in that faculty 

and in theology* Andreas de Ga Rlies/ X^5?or i/i Me* 

dktn'uy was incorporated in 1469; but his name is never 
mentioned again, nor any thing elfe that relates to medicine. 
It is probable, therefore, that there was na faculty of medi- 
cine, rtor any teaching in that fcience Of the teaching in 

the faculty of arts we havfc more full information, from twor 
manufcripts in parchment ; — one of which contains the fta- 
ttttes of that faculty, and its conclufions ; and the other the 
minutes of its meetings, and tranfa£lions, from 1 451 to 1509^ 

Vol. Ult. B and 



lo Statijlical Account 

and from 1535 to 1555. Thcfc manufciipts were tranfcrlbed | 
bjr order of the UnivcrGty in 1 769. | 

Padagogium, — Some yeafs after the Univerfity was foundedy 
many of the ftudents were young men, to whom tuition, as 
well as teaching, was neceflary ; andj therefore, provifion was 
made, that they (hould live and cat in one houfe, which was 
called Piedagogiuriiy or the College of Arts ; where they were 
taught and governed by certain mailers, who were called Rt^ 
gentes In Artibus* This college was at firft on xhr, (buth fide 
of the Rotten-row, and probably was a part of the property 
of the byhop and chapter ; but afterwards a tenement was 
.bequeathed, by Lord Hamilton^ for the College of ArtSf 
where the college now ftands^ 

Regents. — At firft there were three regents in the arfs} 
to wit, Alexander Geddes, a Cillertian monk, Duncan 
BiJNCH, and William Arthurlie. Afterwards we find 
fometimes two, and fometimrs but one. It feems to have 
been the moft laborious, and leaft coveted office in the Uni- 
verfity. Befides teaching and prefiding in difputations omni 
die legibilii they lived within the College, .cat at a common ta- 
ble with the ftudents of arts ; vifitcd the rooms of the ftu- 
dents before 9 at night, when the gates were fhut, and at 5 
ill the morning ; and afiiiled in all examinations for degrees 
in ;irts. In the beginning of every feilion, they propofed to 
the faculty the books they intended to prclc£l upon, and had 
their permifilon. —There was no falary for this office for ma- 
ny years ; and ths fees, paid by the hearers, were very fmall. 
Twice we find a regent prefented by the chancellor, and ohe 
of thefe^e turned off for infufficiency in two or three years. 
Once the faculty turned one out for infufficiency, and put 
two in his j4ace, wiih pQwer to choofe a third, with the con- 
3 fent 



of the Unvoerfity of Glafgow. 1 1 

Cent of the faculty if they found it proper. All that had this 
office, excepting two, continued in it but a few years; and 
very often one who was not a member of the faculty was 
called to this office, and made a regent immediately upon be- 
ing incorporated. From thefe particulars, it is probable that 
there was no competition^ either for this office, or for the pa- 
tronage of it*; but rather fome difficulty to find perfons qua- 
lified who were willing to take it. 

-Blftffir.— The books which ftudents were obliged to hear 
read, before taking the degree of Bachelor, were prefcribed 
by ftatute. They were, PorpbirU's InirpduFtion to certain boels 
%f ^riftotky and Petrus Hifpanus. The fee to be paid for 
hearing each was alfo fixed. --When they had thefc, and the 
other requifites, they were prefcpted by their regent to a 
meeting of the Faculty » which by ftatute was appointed to 
be h^ld annually the day af^er All- Saint Sp 

Examinations, — When they were found to have all the rr- 
quijita^ or wanted only fuch as the faculty faw caufe to dif- 
penfe with, four examinators, called temptatores^ were ekft- 
ed, to examine them, within ten days. Of the four templatorcs^ 
two were regents, (svhcn there were two), ind the other two 
non regents. The examinators, after examination, wrote, 
figned, and fealed their report ; which contained not only the 
name of thofe whom they found worthy, but their onier, ac- 
cording to their merit ; and, in this order, the ^itinxi conferred 
the degree of Bachelor of Arts. — The examinators, when they 
were chofen, took an oath to make a faithful report, and not 
to reveal the f»;crcts of the examination. The candidates were 
alfo fwora not to reveal the fccrets of the examination ; nor 
to (how any refentment, by word or deed, againft any fellow- 
Candidate, by whom they had been refuted in the courfe of 

the 



t± Stattjlical Account 

the examination.— -The examination for the degrees of Ltcen* 
tiate and of Mafter was carried on in the fame way. 

Obligatwn.'^ln the oath taken by one who took the degree 
of Mafter, he came under an obligation de leBura ad bienm* 
urns but this» which implied not only his continuing his ftu- 
dies in the College for two years, but his giving leftures du- 
ring that time, was very often difpenfed with upon paying a 
fine. 

Le8urfs. — ^The ftatutes of this faculty fappofe that every 
mafter is to give preleftions ; for they enjoin, that, on the 
day in which the dean is chofen, the mafters, according to 
their feniority, (hall name the book upon which they are ta 
preled; ; and that, if two mafters choofe the fame book, the 
fenior be preferred, unlefs there be fo many hearers that 
both may prele£^, on the fame book, at the fame time, in difit!* 
rent fchools. Dut, in the minutes of faculty, there is no men* 
tion of any fuch Ie£lures being propofed, or given by any maf- 
ter but the magtftri regenfes^ 

The manner of teaching, and of hearing, is, by the ftatutes, 
ordained to be the fame as in Bonoma and in Pifm. In many 
other things, the practice of fome one of the foreign uni- 
yerfities is made the tule'^ but thofe of England are never 
mentioned. 

D^f]^/i/i^.-i--Corporeal punifliment was fometimcs infiide4 
upon ftudents in the College of Arts. For fome faults the fta- 
tutes order the punifliment to be infli£ted caiigts laxatu» 

Property.-^lt may appear ftrange, that this Univferfity wa$ 
founded without any property in lands, houfes, or rents. It 
came intq the world as naked as every individual does.— The 

congngati^ 



tf the Univerjhy of Clajgow. 1 3 

t^gregaih univirfitatis was always held at the cathedral* 

Sometimes the do£lors and mafters met at the convent of the 

Dominicans^ or Predicators as they were called. All tho 

kjiures we find mentioned in theology, canon or civil law, 

were read there. — There was an univerfity purfe, into which 

fome perquifiteSy paid at incorporation, and at examinations, 

and promotions to degrees, were put. From this purfe caps 

of ceremony were furniflicd, after fome years : but to defray 

the expence of a filver rod or mace, to be carried before the 

re&amp;or at certain folemnities, it was found neceflary to tax all 

the incorporated members ; and on that occaGon we are told 

that David Cadzow, who who was then re£lor, gave 2d 

nobles. 

Two or three chaplainries were bequeathed^ under the pa« 
tronage of the Univerfity, by fomc of its firft members. The 
duty of the chaplain was to perform certain mafles, at fuch 
an altar, for the fouls of the founder and his frienJs ; for 
which be had a fmall annuity. Thefe chaplainries were com* 
monly given to fome of the regents of the College of Arts ; 
perhaps becaufe they were the pooVeft of the facerdotal order 
in the Univerfity, — ^This patronage and this purfe, as far as 
appears, were all the property which the Univerfity ever poffcf- 
fed. Nor does it appear that the faculties of theology, canon 
or civil law, ever had any prope.rty. The individuals had 
nch livings through all parts of the nation ; abbacies, priq- 
rics, prebends, rcftories, and vicarages: but the communi- 
ty had nothing. Its privileges were the inducement to bring 
rich ecclefiaftics into a focicty, in which they lived at eafc, free 
of all taxes, and fubjed to no authority but that of th^ir own 
tcaor. 

The College $f Artiy however, being perhaps thought the 
)3oft ufeful part of the whole, and entitled to public favour, 
^ entrufted with the education of youth^ foon (;ame to have

fomc property. In the year 1459, James Lord Ha^jiltow 
bequeathed to Mr. Duncan Bunch, principal regent of the 
College of Arts, and lils fucceflTors, regents, for the ufc of 
the f.tid col lege, — a tenement, with the pertinents, lying on 
the north fjtle of the church and convent of the Prcdicators, 

together with 4 acres of land in the Dow-hill *. From this 

time ve find the purl'e of the faculty of arts, which appcan 
to have icen heavier than that of the Univerfity, employed in 
repairing and adding to the buildings of the College; faroiib- 
ing rooms for the regents and iludeuts; and things nccefTary 
for the kitchen, and a common table. 

In the year 1466, another tenement, adjoining to the Col- 
lege, was bequeathed by Mr. Thomas Art^urlie. — I5y this 
time, many of the ftudeiits of arts were the youth of the ni« 
tion, whofcgoo4 education was 4 matter of importance to the 
public. They were dtflinguifhed, according to their rank, into 
fons of noblemen, of gentlemen^ and of thofe of meaner rank; 
and, in the expence of their education, were taxed accordingly. 

Suchy as far as we can learn, was the conllitucion of the 
Univerfity of Glafgow before the Reformation. There is rca- 
fon to think, that, when the zeal in favour of a new inftiru- 
tion began to cool, the three higher faculties gradually 4c* 
clined into inaflivity. 

DrfeHs. — From the year 1490, we find frequent complaims, 
of maflers not attending univtifity meetings; of (Vatutes ha- 
ving fallen into cllfufe j of bachelors and licentiates not pro- 
ceeding 

* In this deed, the regents and (ludcnts are required, every day after dio« 
oer and after fupper, to (land cp and pray for the ibuU of James Lord 
Hamilton, founder of the college; of Eufhemia bis fpoufe, Countcf&amp;of 
Douglafi ; of his anceftors and fucceflbrs ; and of all from whom li* hai rt- 
celved any benefit, for ^hich he hasinot made a proper retam.

not being refpefted. Sometlmes at the ele£lioh of a rcOor^ 

not one of che natlcn of Albany was prefent ; and once, none 

cither oi Albany or of Teviotdale. — There feems only to have 

been one dean in the UniverGty for fome'^time before the Re- 

forrnatlon, to wit, the dean of the faculty of arts; and, 

therefore, It is probable the other faculties h^d no meetings. 

la the later minutes of ths Univerfily he is called Decamts -K:- 

ciiltatis, without addition ; whereas, more early, ht is always 

Decanus Facultatis Arilunn *. This ftyle, of Dean of Faculty of 

the Univerfty^ which we fee was a cOnfiderable time before 

the Reformation, continues to be ufcd to this day ; there 

being only one dean of faculty in that Unlverfity, who is con- 

(liered not as the head of one particular faculty, but in th j 

light of an univerfity ofHcer, as the rt£lor is. 

There fecm to have been two obvious dcfefts in the ancIcnC 
conflitution of the Univerfity. The fir ft. That no falaries were 
provided for regular le£lurcs in the high faculties. It was not 
to be cxpe£led, that the laborious work of teaching (hould be 
performed by thofe who could not live by it 5 and who could

* Whatever were the caufes of dedenfion In this Uni?erlity before the Re- 
formation, the 'annal^ of literature mention Tery few of its mcmberSi wha 
jnade any confiderable figure in the learned world. One, howerer, dcfcrves 
to be mentioned. William Elphinston, who had been a canon of Glaf* 
^ow, and had borne the offices both of reOor of the Unirerlity, and dean of 
the faculty of arts, was eminent in the knowledge both of the canon and 
civil law. He was made Biihop of Aberdeen, and Chancellor of Soothnd ) 
and was employed in feveral embaflles to foreign courts.— -He ftmnded the 
Vniversxtt of Old ABsaDZEit, in the year 1496. And, either fram the 
experience of what he had feen in the UniverHty of Olafgow, or from a deep- 
er knowledge of human nature, he fupplied, in his univerfity, both the de* 
fe£ls we have obferved in that of Glafgow : for he gave ialaries (not illiberal 
for the times) to thofe who were to teach theology^ canon and civil law, rac 
dicine, languages, and philosophy, and penfions to a certain number of poor 
fludents ; and likewife appointed a viAtorial power, refenring to himlelf^ tf 
chancellor, and to his fucceflbrs in that office, a dictatorial power, to be exo^ 
cifed occafionally according to the report of the vifitors. 

Jamcs BcAtoN, the lafl popifh archbiihop of Glaigow, deferres alio to be 
mentioned with honour. His fidelity in depofiting every thing he carried • 
wny, that belonged to the archbiOiopric or to the Univerfity, in the convent 
of the Carthufians, or in the Scotch College at Paris, was never queilioned. 
His political ability appears by his having been appointed one of the ScottKh 
ambafTadors, at the court of France, for fettling the articles of the Qoeen'f 
marriage wiih the Dauphin \ his having been again appointed her ambaiiador 
at that court, and continuing in that office from the time of the Reformation 
till her death ; and, after that tragical event, his being appointed Kiog 
Jameses ambaflador at the fame court, and holding that office till the time of 
his own death in 1603, when King James came to be kmg of England.— 
This archbiihop left feveral monuments of his learning in manufcript, which 
arc prefcrvcd in the Scotch College at Paris, to which he bequeathed the 
grcated pait of his t^tCts at his death.

In. History after the REFORMiTioN. 

iTilE reformation iii religion, eftaUifhed by a£t of Parlia« 
liicnt in the jrcat i j6o, brought the UriiverGty of Glafgowal- 
tnoft to aiinihilation. The dignitaries of the church and con« 
Vents, of whom its lo£tors and mafters were compofed, wert 
no more. The chancellorj Jai^es Beaton, fled to France j 
and carried With him the pUte of the cathedral, wich^the bulls, 
eharterj and rights, both of the fee and of the UniVerfity ; 
which he depofited partly in the convent $f the Carthufians; 
and partly in the Scotch College at Paris, (where, they lately 
were), to be reftbred when Popery (hoUld be ie-eftabliihed.-« 
it ought td be obfenred, to the honour of that college, that 
they have alwayir be^n ready to give esCtraAs from the originals 
depofited with them, as v^ell as to gratify the curious by the 
infpeiflion of them. The late Principal G6rdok, of that col- 
lege, made a prefent to the Univerfity of Glafgow of a copy of 
the chartiilary of the chapter of Glafgow, riotorially attefted. 
All that was now to be feen of the Univerfity was that fmall 
part, called the ColUgtdfAris^ or Pjtdagdgium ; the leaft in dig- 
nity, though perhaps not the leaft ufeful. This fmall part, 
with its fmall property, probably much impaired by the con« 
fiifion of the times, add the lofs of rights,— remained ^s a re- 
lic of the ancient Univerfity, and the feed' of a rcfo*rme4U- 
idverfity % dependent for its fubfiftence and growth on future 
BcncfaiJioris.— The rich fabric of the popilh hierarchy, ioi 
Scotland, was pulled down with mote zeal than pruldence, by 
a fierce nation, long opprefTed, and little accuftomed to regu« 
lar government. All who had power or intcreft fcrambled 
for the wreck. ^The Crown, the nobility, and the cities, were 
enriched by it : fome crumbs came, by fecond hand, to the 
iuiverfities.

her, and to which her priory feal is appended, dated the i3t!lr

to Statiftical Accotwt 

One might thinkj that, when to the former fevcnue of tbf 
college were added thcfe donations of Queen Mart, and of 
the city of Glafgow, it muft have been completely endowed 
for the maintenance of 1 5 perfons \ yet it was foQn found no* 
ceflary to increafe the revenue, and to dimintfli die number of 
perfons to be maintained by it. For although the property 
of the DomiiUcan friars in Glafgow, was certainly very cont- 
derable before the Reformatiori ; yet all that the college couU 
make effeflual of that, and all their funds taken together, a- 
mounted only, by their rental, to L. 300 Scotch money *. 

A more eflFedual benefadion was made to this poor focietj, 
in the year 15771 by King James VI. in his minority, widi 
' the advice and confent of the Earl of Morton, regent of die 
kingdom. .That was the re^ory an4 vicarage of the parifliof 
Govan, of which the incumbent was lately dead ^ and the ra^ 
lue reckoned about 24 chalders. It was found, however, diat 
the late incumbent had, before his death,, given a 19 ye^fl 
leafe of the temporality to a friend \ and that friend had trans* 

fcned 

f The reafoirwhy donations, in a^^peannce Bbend, tamed 00^ to ia (anil 
account, was, partly, that the popiih ecdefiaAics, iecuiar and regular, tboafh 
their form of worihip was totally aboliflied through the whole nation, cooti* 
gued to enjoy their temporalities for life, fubjed to a taxation of a third pait 
to the Crown, out of which the clergy of the reformed chnrch were to be 
quintained ; partly, that thofe Incumbents, during their life, pra^Hfed ntf* 
Ay arts to alienate their revenues to laymen, either from friendflup or for 
their own profit, by pretended fen-contnrAs, perpetual or long Itafcs, vA 
iDany other means, which their "priTate intereft, their regvd to relations, « 
their hatred of the new religion, fu^cfted.

afterwards reduced and annulled by the courts of law. Tome by arbitratioo.

charter of foundation to the College ; which, in its aioft cflen* 
rial articles, has continued in force to this day. It is com- 
monly called the nowt ertBio ; all fubfequent changes being 
fuperftru£iures upon this foundation. The charter proceeds 
upon this narrative : InteIHgentes quod annua proficua ft reditus

fteward^ a cook, a porter, and a feryant to the principal. 

£fiaUi/bment.-^The principal was to teach theology one 
day, and Hebrew and Syriac tlie next alternately, through 
the week ; and to preach in the church of Govan on Sunday. 
Of the regents, one was to teach Greek and rhetoric ; another, 
dialectics, morals, and politics, with the elements of arith- 
metic and geometry ; and the third, who was alfo fub-princi- 
pal) was to teach all the branches of phyfiology and geogra- 
phy, chronology and ajlrology. The principal to be prcfented 
by the Crown ; the regents to be eleded by the re£lor, dean

The burfars were to be maintained for three years and a half

*The fteward.was to colle£l the whole revenues, and to pro* 
Tide all necefiaries for the college table ; and to give an ac- 
count, every day to the principal and regents, of his difburle- 
mcnts.— The reftor, the dean of faculty, and the minifter 
of Glafgow, are authorifed to vifit the college four times in 
the year; to examine an4 authenticate the public accounts ^ 
and to fee that all things be carried on according to the inten- 
tion of this foundation, and to corred^ what was not. 

Privileges and Exemptions, — Alt donatio(^s formerly made 
to the College, by whatfoever perfbn or perfons, of whatfo*

him and his fucceflbrs,— {hall be enjoyed by the faid college, 
free from any taxation of a third part, or any other taxation

deed, befides the college, adi that remains of the Univerfity is 
a chancellor, reAor, and dean^ We fee that the Nwa E^ 
reffh fuppofes their exiilence i but makes no change with re« 
gard to their powers, except in giving to the two laft, toge- 
ther with the minifter of Glafgow, a vifitorial power over the 
college. — ^The re£lor and dean are chofen annually; much 
in the fame manner as they were from the firft foundation of 
the univerfity. The re^or always names the principal and 
profeflbrs to be his afieflbrs; and, with them, occafionally 
forms a court of law, for judging in pecuniary queftions, and 
lefs atrocious crimes, wherein any member of the Univerfity 
was party. The uniyerfity has always maintained its'exemp- 
don from all jurifdlflion of the city magiftrates, but not of 
the {beriff or Court of Seflion. 

This may fuffice for a general view of the conflituthn of the 
Univerfity, fince the reformation from Popery. As to the ftatc 
of its reijenues during that period, it has been much indebted 
both to our princes and to fubje£ls. Its declenfion before the 
reign of James VL was not more remarkable than its progrefs 
fince that period. From the fmall beginning, derived from 
the bounty of that prince, it continued to profper to the xra 
of the Reftoration ;• having, at that time, befides a principal,

•f its burfars increafed, and an additional number of other

ftudehts of atll ranks. A renewal of the fabric (whidi faaa 
been ruinous) was begun and carried on, with great enlar^^ 
menti in an elegant mannef for the time ; but not iinflhed. 

V. Donations. 

Soon after th6 new foundation, in the y^ar 1581, the arch^ 
blQiop gave to the College the cuftoms of tlie city of Glafgow,' 
by which it was enabled to found a fourth regent. A nvtt 
body of ftatutes was formed about this timci which are ex- 
tant. By them it appears that the principal and 4 regent; 
were put to very hard arid codftant laboiir ; arid tlie (Indents 
kept under very ftriflt dJfciplirie. Of the fegents, the firft 
and higheft was profeflbr of p'hyfiology, and fub-piincipal i 
the fecond was profcflbr of moral philofophy \ the third of' 
logic and rhetoric ; arid the fourth of Greek. Their falaries 
rofe in gradation ; and when any of the higher offices became 
vacant, thofe who were in the lower were commonly advanced 
a ftep ; and the new chofen regent had the profeiBon of Greek 
for his department. 

In this ftate the 0llcge continued for a long time ; excepts 
jng that, in the year 1621, by a meeting of the vifitors, trf 
which the archbifliop was prefent, the principal Was freed 
from the duty of preaching in the church of Govan. A mi- 
nider was appointed to have the paftotal charge of that parifii, 
to whom a ftipcnd was provided out of the teinds of the pa- 
rifti ; the patronage of the church being referyed to the Uni- 
vcrfity, and the minifter being obliged " to read fome public 
" Icfture in the common fchools of the College, as (hall be 
" prefcribed to him by the officers of the Univerfity, and ma*- 
" lers of the College." This change they were enabled to 
make, from having, by an vlOl of Parliament, in the year 1616^ 
been vcftcd in the tithes of the pariflics of Kilbride and Ren- 
frew f

6f thefe two parilhes^, which are modified by the zGt ; and 
like wife burdened 'with the life- rent of the pcrfons, who were 

at that tithe titulars of thefe tithes. In the year 1637, it 

appears, that a maftcr or profcffor humanmum literarum^ com- 
monly called profejfor of humanity^ had been founded *. 

In the year 1 641,, Charles I. by his fignature, gave to 
the college the temporality of the biihoprio "bf Galloway ; 
tefcrving to himfelf the power of burdening it with the fum 
of Ij.ioo ftcrlihgy to any perfon he (hould name. This jgift 
was confirmed by an zQt of Parliament the fame year.- - • 
The office of chancellor of the Univerfity becoming Vacant^ 
by the abolition of Epifcopal government in the church, Jame9 
Marquis of Hamilton was chofen chancellor, and ^as the 
firft lay-man who bore that ofllice. •After him, William 
Earl of Glencai&amp;n was chofen» in the year i6i5o; 

Though the greateft part of the mailers fubmitted with re- 
.hiflancc to the government of Oliver Cromwell, and 
wifhed a reftoration of 'the monarchy, under proper limita- 
tions, the principal, Mr. Patrick: Gillespie, was a zealous 
republican ; and, by the intereft he had with Oliver, obtain- 
ed great favours for the Univerfity. The Proteftor and his 
council renewed all its immunities and privileges ; adding that 
o^ printing bibles, and all forts of books belonging to the li- 
beral fciences, and licenfed by the Univerfity; He confirmed 
Vol. Ult. D all 



^ In the year 1637, a meeting of the Tiiitorf, the archbifhop being pre- 
fent, appmnted Mr. Robert MAtNE, then profefTor of logic, to: be pro- 
leilbr of medicine, and to give leAures in that fcicnce. At the fame time^ 
the profeilor of Greek was advanced to the profcfCon of logic ; the pro« 
fef&amp;r of hnmanity, to the profeflion of Greek ; «bd a new profefTor of hn* 
ttxanitf was chofen.

all former foundations, mortifications^ ^and donations made 
in its favour, particularly that of the bifliopric of Galloway ; 
to which he added the vacant ftipends of the parilhes which 
had been in the patronage of the bifhop of Galloway^ for fevcs' 
years to come ; and alfo, in perpetuity, the revenues of the 
deanry and fub-dcjanry of Glafgow. This lafl; gift, however, 
was accompanied with feveral limitations and reftriAionSy by 
which the college had not the poiTcfllon of the fubje^s while 
his power lafled ; and, his afts being refcinded at the Refto- 
ration, it fell of courfe, and had no effect. 

The re-eftablifhment of Epifcopal government in the church, 
after the reftoration of Charles II. gave a fevere check to ihc 
profperity of the Univerfity ; by depriving it at once of the beft 
part of its revenue, to wit, that of the bilhopric of Galloway, 
Before arrangements could be made, fuited to this impoverifii- 
ed (late, a great debt was contrafted. Of the eight profeffions 
which had been eilabliihed, three were funk ; and thofe that 
remained were reduced to a very (hort allowance. The col- 
lege now confided of a principal, a profeffor of theol^, 
and 4 regents; a very fcanty revenue, funk in debt^ and a 
large fabric unfiniflied. 

A vifitation of the univerfities was appointed by Parliament 
in the year 1664. The noblemen, gentlbmen, and clergy, 
who vifited the College of Glafgow, after a (lrt£l ezaminatioa 
of their revenue, report, *' That the fum of three thoofand 
** nine hundred and forty-one pounds Scotch, yearly, will be 
** neccflar to be fpccdily provided for unto the Univerfity, or 
** otherways it mud quickly decay and ruinc*." Befides this, 
they fuund it had a great load of debt i and tliat many profef- 

fioas 

* The vifitors pf the college of Gbf^ow were, the Archbiihop of Gla^v^

U'larnock, Ccchiaa i befides gentlemen anU clergy.

Cons were wanting which it ought to have, but cannot for the 
prefcnt poffibly have for want of revenue. In this report the 
▼ifitors were unanimous. 

In this ftatc the Univerfity remained till after the Revolu- 
tion. It is truei that, in this interval, it received fevcral con- 
Cderable donations and mortifications : but thefe were all ap- 
propriated, by the donors, either to the carrying on of the 
bailding, or to the foundatipn of burfars ; and were faithful- 
ly applied to thefe purpofes. So that it mufl have required 
great economy in the profeflbfs, as well as great lenity in 
their creditors, to preferve them from bankruptcy, duiing this 
long interval. 

In the year 1693, ^^-^ ^^ ^^ Scottifh univcrfities obtained 
a gift of L. 300 a-year out of the bifliops rents in Scotland. 
The fum payable to the Univtrfity of Glafgow, was allocated' 
upon the income of the archbifliopric of GlafgoW ; and foon 
sifter^ ftlll better to fecure the payment, the College obtained a 
leafe of the whole rent of the archbifliopric for 1 9 years, which 
Ieafe«has from time to time been renewed by the Crown. 

The Univerfity began now to raife hsr heud, after a long pe- 
riod of depreflion, by debt and poverty, and by the diminu- 
tion of her profeflbrs. The exertions which were made about 
this time were encouraged by the great number of her ftudents. 
Principal Stirling, in his diary, (ays, that in the year 1702 
the ftudents of theology, Greek, and philofophy, amounted 
to upwards of 402. The great demand for clergymen, to 
fill the vacant benefices, immediately after the eftablifhment 
of the Prcfbyterian government, occafioned the attendance of 
a greater nun^ber of ftudents about the beginning of this cen- 
tury, than at any former period. 

In the year 1 706, the profcflion of humanity was revived ; 
and Mr Andrew Rofs was appointed profeflbr. 

In the year 1708, her Majefty Queen Anne was pleafed 

to 



%t Statifticai Account 

to grant the Univcifity L. 2 to ftcrling yearly, payable out of 
the Exchequer : one part of which was appropriated for fala- 
lies to a profeflbr o)[ anatomy and botany, and to a profefibr of 
oriental languages ; and another part of it for augmenting tlie 
falaries of the principal and profeflbrsi according to a fcheme 
of divifion mentioned in the deed. This gift has been renew- 
ed by all the fubfequent fovereigns. 

The gift of L. 300 per dnnum, by King William, was for 
fome time dire£ted to be applied for extinguifhing the college 
debts, and fupporting four burfars* By a fubfequent deed of 
Quecti Anne, in the year 1713, part of it was continued for 
the faid purpofes } and the remainder appropriated for (adariei 
to a profeiTor of ciyil law, and a profiAbr of medicine. 

His Majefty King George I. was pleafed to grant, out 
of the rents of the archbiftopric, a new gift of L.ijo per aar 
ftum; which was appropriated for ^ falary to a profeffiir of 
ecclefitfftical hiftory^ and for augmenting the fmaller falaries of 
the other profefTors.— By thefe royal donations^ the whole of 
the rent paid by the College, for the leafe3of the archbifliop- 
ric, is exhauftcd ; and regular accompts thereof are tranfmit- 
ted to the Exchequer. 

Since that time there has been one profefiion added to thii 
Univcrfity, by the bounty of King George II. 

Alexai^der Macfarlane, £fq. of Jamaica, had ereAcd 
an aftronomical obfervatory in that ifland, for his own ufc. 
At his death, he bequeathed his aftronomical apparatus to the 
College of GU%ow, on condition that they fliould build an 
obfervatory, and appoint an obfervcr. The College very readi- 
ly accepted the condition, and built an obfervatory ; and, in 
the year 1760, his Majefty was pleafed to grant a prefentation 
to Dr. Alexander Wilson, to be fvoicffor of praBical a/lr 
nomj and obferver, with a falary of L. 50 yearly out of the 
Exchequer.

, VI. Present State. 

From the foregoing ftatemcnt, it appears that the ancient 
conftitution of the Univerfity of Glafgow, in the diftribution 
of fciences and modes of teaching, as well as in the form of 

• its government, was very fimilar to that of all the other uni- 
verfities of Europe. The alterations which it has undergone, 
in later times, are fuch as might be expe£led from the chan- 
ges of opinion .with refpcdl to literary obje£^s, and from other 

^ vaiying circumftanccs. The progrefs of knowledge, and the 
increafing demand for literature, have produced many addi- 
tional departments of fcicnce, to thofe which were originally 
thought worthy of a particular teacher. What is called the 
furriculum^ or ordinary courfe of public education, compre- 
i^nds at prefent five branches, the Latin and Greek langua- 

' gcs. 



30 . Statijlical Account 

gest logic, moral philofophy, and natural philofophy. The(c 
branches are underftood to require the (ludy of five feparate 
feflions. , 

During their attendance upon thefe courfcs of languages 
and philofophy, and particularly before thry enter the clafs of 
natural philofophy, the ftudents are ezpeded to acquire a 
knowledge of mathematics and algebra, for which there is a 
feparate profefTor^ and which. is underftood to be fubfervient 
to natural phiiofophy and to many of the practical arts. 
There is alfo a profeflbr of pradical aft^ronomy, whofe bufi* 
nefs is to make obfervations, for the improvement of that 
great branch of phyfics.-*^ After the courfe of general edo^ 
cation, above-mentioned, a provifion is made for what are 
called the three learned profei&amp;ons, divinity, law, and tnedi- 
cine. For thp peculiar education of churchmen there arc 
' four profeflbrs ; — the principal^ who is primarius profeflbr of 
theology, and has, befides, the fuperintendance of the whole 
UniverGty ; and the refpe£live profeflbrs of theology, of o- 
riental languages, apd of church-hiftory. This laft is alfo 
leAurer in civil biftory. 

In law there is only one profeflbr. 

There are, by the conftitution, no more than two profef- 
fors allotted to the faculty of medicine: to wit, a profeflbr of 
the theory and pradlice of medicine, and a profefllbr of anav 
tomy and botany. But the Univerfity, out of its funds, and 
with the afllftance of private donations, has made an annual 
provifion for three additional le£turers ; in chemiftry, in ma- 
teria medica, and in midwifery. 

The Univerfity has now the profpeA of a great and impor- 
tant addition being foon made to the faculty of medicine. 
The late Rev. Dr. Walton, of Upton in Huntingdonfhtre, 
about 20 years ago, in a tour to Scotland, vifited the Univer- 
fity 



of iht Univirftty oJGlafgcw. 31 

fity of Glafgow ; and, approving of its conftitutioni and mode 
• of conducing education, gave to the Univerfity L. 400 fter« 
ling ; the intereft of which, at his death, he appropriated for 
the fupport of a medical ftudenc during the coarfe of his edu- 
cation. About 5 years ago the fame generous benefa£lor 
mortified (funk) the additional fv^m of L.1600 fterling, at 
his death, to the Univerfity ; for the purpofe of fuppoiting a 
lc£lurer in any branch of medicine, or of fcience conne£led 
ivith medicine, which the Univerfity (hould judge mofl: ex- 
pedient or neceflary. By the Doftor's death, which happen* 
ed about thiee years ago, both thefe donations now take cf- 
fea- 

Mifs Christian Brisbane, fifter of the late Dr. Brisbane, 
profeflbr of medicine in this Univerfity, mortified the fum of 
L« 1000 fterling; the intereft of which ifae appropriated for 
the fupport of a medical ftudent, two years at this Univerfi* 
ty, and other two years at any other celebrated fchool of me* 
dicine in Britain, or on the Continent, as the Univerfity fhall 
dired. 

The late celebrated Dr. William Hunter, of London, 
formerly an alumnus of this Univerfity, and, during the 
"whole of his life, waimly attached to its intereft^ bqqueath* 
ed to the Univerfity, at his death, the whole of his Mufaum^ 
ene of the moft valuable coUe^ions in Europe, of hatural 
hiftory, medals, anatomical preparations, books, &amp;c. When 
this collection has continued a certain number of years at 
London^ he has, by his will, direded it to be carried to the 
Univerfity of Glafgow. And, for the purpofe of building a 
houfe for the reception of this noble donation, and eftablifh- 
ing fuch new profeQions in medicine as the Univerfity fliould 
judge expedient, be bequeathed L. 8000 fterling, bearing in- 
tereft from his death ; the one half of which he direfled to 
be appUcd for the fupport of the faid Mufaum^ while it conti-

the period arrive, when both '|)rincipal and intereft (halt be 
appropriated, by the Unircrfity, for the abore-mentioncd 
purpofes fpecified in the deed of donation. 

Infirmary. — The progtefs of a medical fch'ool, in this Uiu- 
verfity, his been hitherto much retarded by the want of ad 
infirmary in Glafgow. Bat there is at prefent a profpe£l of 
that obftacle being immediately removed. A very confident 
We fum of money has been lately raifed, by voluntary fub* 
fcription, for the purpofe of ereding and fupporting an in- 
firmary in Glafgow» A royal charter has been obtained, and 
. a grant from the Crown, of the fite of the Archbifhop's Caf- 
tle, for the buildings ; which, according to a beautiful defign, 
given by the late Robert Adaxii^ £fq. are now finiihed. 

AppGtnimenis of the Profejpfrs* — ^The pririctpal, and the profe&amp; 
fors of church hiftory, law, medicine, anatomy and botany, 
and aftronomy, arc nomiaated by the King. The profeffors 
of theology, oriental languages, humanity, Greek, logic^ mo- 
ral philofophy, natural philofophy, and mathematics, and the 
Ie£lureTs on chemiftry, materia medica^ and midwifery, are 
nominated by the College. — -The average number of ftudenfs 
of all denominations, attending the different claflbs, is confix 
dcrably above 600. 

Salaries^ ^c. —From the (late of the urilverfity f iinds» the* 
profeffors are allowed very moderate falaries ; fo as to depend 
chiefly for fubfiftence upon the homirariums^ or fees of their 
ftudents. This, it is believed, has greatly promoted their zeal 
and their diligence in their fevcral profcffions.— -In fcmi-

tTie bufincfs of Icfturing haa generally gone into dlfufe, or 
been reduced to a mere matter of form ; as few perfons arc 
willing to labour, who, by doing little, or by following theif 
amufcnleht, find themfeltes in caify and comfortable circum* 
lliances. The department of teaching is likely, in fuch a 
cafe* to be devolved lipoA the junior members of the fociety, 
who dffcharge the office of private tiitors ; and who, from 
tfic mtiAient they eater up6n their offices, arc ready to confi- 
'dcr it is a paffing ftate, and to Jook forward to that period 
when they fliall, in their turn, be freed from the drudgery of 
teaching. In fuch circumilance^, when neither the tutor nor 
j^upil is under the immediate eye of the public^ inftead of' 
ftrnggling for difttndion and fuperiority, in tl\cir refpefkivc 
jftatioris, they will be too apt to indulge the lassinefs, and to 
gratify the' peculiar humour of each otheV. In the'Scottiih 
ttniveTfittes, and particiilatly that of Glafgow, where the 
profeflbrs haVe ho benefices in the church, not 'any emolu- 
ments of any kind independent of their labour, nor any thing 
that can be called preferment within their readh, that radical 
dcfefl in the condu£t of education is altogether removed. 
There is likely to grow up with them, in thefe circumftances, 
a habitual liking to their objefls and occupations, and that 
intereft and zeal, \Xx the difchatge of their duty, which are 
mod likely to clll forth the a£livity and induftry of their pu« 
pils* 

It may be thought, perhaps, that, as neceffity is the pa- 
rent of labour, it Would be a dill greater improvement, that 
profeffors in colleges fhouW have no falaries at all. This 
would be indifputable, if all other employments weie left to 
the natural profit which they can produce, and were not pe- 
culiarly rewarded by fixed appointments from the public. 
But if one trade, or art, is allowed a bounty, anorfier fpuft,

Tifia fffLeBuring^ fe*^.— The uniform affiduity of tbe pro- 
^feflbrs in the Univerfity of Glafgow^ and the length of ttae 
which they emp'loy in kAuring, will a£R)rd an iHuftration oC 
thefe remarks. The annual feiSon for teaching, in the Uni- 
verfity, begins, in the ordinary currUulum^ on the tenth of 
O£lobtr; and ends, in fome of the clafies, about the naiddte 
ef May, and in others continues to the tenth of June* The 
leflures, in all tlie other branches, eommence on thcfirft of 
November, and end about the begroning of May. The dafii 
of botany begins on the firft of May» 

During this period, the bufinefs of the Cqllege continues, 
without interruption* The profeflbrs of humanity, or Latin, 
and of Greek, leflure al^d examine their ftudents, receive 
and corred exercifes, three hours '^very day, and four boars 
for two days every week : The profeilbrs of logic, moral phi- 
lofophy and natural philofophy, two hours every day, and 
three hours during a part of the &amp;iiion$ excepting on Sator* 
days, when, on account of a geeend meeting of the public 
ftudents, there is only one le£lure given. The other profcf- 
Ibrs le£turd, in general, one hour every day : The profeflbr 
of mathematics, two hours every day, except on Saturdays : 
The profeflbr of law, in his public department, two hours. 
The profeflbr of {ifra^ical aftronomy gives no public ledure.

Advantages of Public Le^uring. — In thofc unircrfities wbere 
die profeflbrs are uniformly employed in leduring, it may be 
expe£led that the matter of their le£lorcs will correfpond, 
in fome meafure, to the general progrefs of fcience and lite« 
rattire in their feveral departments. A profefibr, whofe con* 
fequence and livelihood depend upon the approbation givea 
by the public to his leAures, will find it neceflary to ftudy 
the principal authors upon the fubje^l : he will imbibe, in 
fome degree, the tafte of the age in which he lives, and avail 
himfelf of the increafe of knowledge and new difcovery : he 
will find It expedient to model Jus inftruAions in the manner 
mdft likely to fuit the purpofes, and to promote the intcreit 
of his ftudcnts. By going frequently over the fame fubje£l, 
he has a chance to corre£l the erroneous opinions which he 
might forrperly have admitted ; and, according to the fcale 
of his underftanding, to attain the mod liberal and compre- 
henfive views of his fcience. If he is poflefled, at the fame 
time, of tafte and abilities, he can hardly avoid acquiring an 
enthufiaftic attachment to the objefls of his profefTion, and 
an ardent defire of propagatiiig thofc improvements in it 
which appear to him of importance* 

In colleges where no Icdlures are given, and where the 
reading and prele£ling on certain books, in a private manner^ 
make the chief objefl of the teacher, the fame difpoCtions 
and Tiews will feldom occur. The profefibr, having little 
temptation to ftudy in any particular manner, that fcience 
with which he is nominally coniif Aed, will be apt topofltfs 
but a fuperficial knowledge of it, and to have little zeal in 
communicating new ideas or difcoveries concerning it. In 
fach a iituation, the prejudices and contraftcd views of lite- 
rature, which formerly prevailed, and which were natural 
upon the immediate revival of letters, may remain to the pre- ' 
fcnt day; and the name o( fckolar be reftrifted to a mere

proficient in the Greek and Roman languages, the vehicbi 
only of tafte and knowledge : the purfuits of philofophy may 
be regarded as idle and chimerical; and every attentpt to dif« 
iipate the clouds of ancient ignorance, o^ to correfl the er- 
rors and prejudices of a foi:fner period, m^y be reprobated as 
a dangerous innovation. 

The diftribution of fcience,^ and the courfe of lectures, for* 
merly edabliihed in all the univetiitits of Europe, were al- 
moft excluGvcly adapted to the education of churchmen, ami 
proceeded upon a much more limited (late of knowledge than 
th^t which obtains at prefent. To accommodate iuftrudiofij 
therefore, to the purpofes ana views of the nation at large, 
and to render the academical courfe ufcful in every fituation, 
it is frequently neccilary, in thofc univerfities where any parti 
of the old plan is retained, that the profeiTors (houid now, 
treat their refpcflivc fubj,e£ls in a difl[crcnt manner, and that 
what is comprehended under particular branches fliould ba 
greatly varied and extended. 

Latin. — In the Univerfity of Glafgow, the ftudents, wha 
attend the humanity Ie£tures, are fuppofed to have acqui- 
red the elements of the Latin tongue, in public or private 
fchools } and the profeifor is employed in reading, explain- * 
ing, and prele£ling upon fuch Roniian authors, as are moll 
fuited to carry on their progrefs in that language. Tq a clafe 
of more advanced ftudents, the profcffor reads a courfe of 
le£lures on the peculiar itie;^ and beauties of the Roman lao- 
gunge, on the principles of cbflical compofitioo, and on Ro^ 
man antiquities. 

Greek, — In the ancient ftate of the Uirivtrfity, It was pto? 
bably not ufual for any pcrfon to ftudy ijnder the profefibr of 
Greek, ui^til he had acquired fome previous knowledge of 

the 



of tb€ Univerjity of GJaJ^ow, jy 

tb^ Greek language. But, as Greek is. now feldom reguhrlj^ 
taught in public fchoolsi the profefTor is under the ncceflity 
of inftruf\ing a great number in the very elements of that lan- 
guage. Tp a fecond fet, who have made fome proficiency 
in that refpefi, he is employed in reading, explaining, and, 
prelefling upon thofe claflical authors, from an acquaintance 
with whom his hearers are ipoft likely to imbibe a knowledge 
c^Gkeek, and, ut the fame time, to improve their tafte in 
literary coYnpolitipn. To a dill more advanced fet of ftu- 
dents, he alfo delivers a courfe of Ie£lures on the higher 
l^raaches of Greek literature, introducing a variety of difqui- 
fitions on the general principles of grammar, of which the. 
regular ftrudurc of tl^at language affords fuch copious il- 
li^dration. 

• 

Phlhfophy. — In the threefold diftribution. of PuiLoaoPHT, 
in the academicalcourfe, logic has, in general, preceded the 
p^her two in the order of teaching, and has been confidercd 
as a neceffary preparation for them. Before the ftudent en- 
tered mpon the fubjcfts of moral and natural philofophy, it 
was thought proper to inftrudjt him in the art of reafoning, 
and difputation \ and the fyltogidic art, taken from the ana* 
lytics of Ariftotle, was, for many ages, confidcrcd as thp 
moft effeftual and infallible inftruraent for that purpofc. Jt 
was foppofed to afford a mechanical mode of reafoning, by 
which, in all cafes, truth and falfehood might be accurately 
diftinguiflied. But the change of opinions on the fubjefts of 
literature, and on the means of comprehending them, has oc« 
cafioned a correfpondent alteration in the manner of treating 
this part of the academical CQurfe. The prcfent profeffor af- 
ter a fliort analyfis of the powers of the underftanding, and an 
explanation of the terms ncccffary to comprehend the fubjefls 
^ his courfe, gives a hiftorical view of the rife, and progrcfs 

of

' of the art of rcafoning, and particularly of the fyllogiftic me- 
thod, which is rendered a matter of curioGty by the univerfal 
influence which for a long time it obtained over the learned 
world : and then dedicates the greater part of his time to an 
illuftration of the various mental operations, as they are ex* 
preflTed by the feveral modifications of fpeech and writings 
which leads him to deliver a fyftem of leflures on general 
grammar, rhetoric, and belles lettres. This courfe, accoO- 
panied with fuitable exercifes and fpecimens, on the part o( 
the ftudents, is properly placed at the entrance to philofophy : 
no fubje£ls are likely to be more i'nterefting to young minds, 
at a time when their tafte and feelings are beginning to opeii| 
and have naturally dlfpofed them to the reading of fuch an* 
thors, as are neceflTary to fupply them with fa£l8 and materia 
als for beginning and carrying on the important habits of re* 
fle£tion and inveftigation. 

Moral Philofophy. — ^The Icftures in tHe Moral Philosophy 
clafs confift of three principal divifions. The firft compr&amp;* 
liends natural theology ; or the knowledge, confirined by hu- 
man reafon, concernbg the being, perfe£lions, and opera- 
tions of God. The fecond comprehends ethics ; or enquiries 
concerning the afiive powers of man, and the regulation of 
them, both in the purfuit of happinefs, and in the practice of 
virtue ; and, confequently, thofe ^ueftions' that have been a^ 
gitated concerning good and evil, right and wrong. The 
third comprehends natural jurifprudence, or the general rules 
of juftice, which are founded upon the rights and the condi* 
tion of man; whether confidered as an individual, or as a 
member of a family, or as a member of fome of thofe vari* 
ous forms of government which have arifen from the focial 
(combinations of mankind. 

Natural 



of the Univerfity of Ghfgow. 39 

Natural P**/g^Ajr»— The Icfturcs in Natural Philoso- 
FHT comprehend a generail fyftem of phjfics ; and are calcu- 
lated, in like manner, to keep pace with thofe leading im* 
provements and difcoveries, in 'that branch of fcience, hj 
which the prefcnt age is/o much diilinguiflied. The theore- 
ticsil and experimental part3 make the libje£ls of two feparate 
courfes. The apparatus for condafiing the latter is believed 
not to be inferior to any in Europe. 

JUatiematicj.'^Thc profeflbr of Mathematics has three 
fcparate cqurfes. The firft comprehends the, elements of 
geometry and algebra ; the fecond, the higher parts of thofe 
fciences ; the third, the general principles of geometry and 
mftroQomy. To teach the application of the fpecnlative doc- 
nines to the various pra£lical arts, makes a very importani 
•bjeA in thb ufcful department of education. 

7&amp;0£^jy.— In the faculty of Theology, the refpeflive 
profeflbrs of theology, church hiftory, and oriental langua- 
gesy deliver a fyftem of le^iures on natural and revealed re* 
ligion^ on the hiftory of the church, and on the Hebrew lan« 
guage. In this faculty, no honorarium^ ^fi^$ is paid by the 
ftudents* If this regulation had been extended to all the 
fciences, it would probably have been fatal to academical ac- 
tivity; but, being limited to a fingle branch, it has been, 
connteraAed by the infiuence of the general induftry and ex« 
ertion which pervade the fociety. No deficiency, therefore, 
is imputable to the profeflbrs in this depalrtment, either with 
refpcfi to their zeal in teaching or with refpe£t to thofe li- 
bera) and tolerating principles which are fo conformable to 
the fpirit and genius of Chriftianity.

feems t6 have excited lefs attention froip Gorernmeht tnad 
Uiat of the other fciences, as thi^ profeflibh Was n6t eftablifk 
ed till a late period^ and as no {roVifion has hi&amp;erto beexl 
made for dividing this branch of educatton among (eparate 
^rofeflbrs. The want of competition appears to have had the 
iifual efFeifls ; and the cuftom of leduring in Latin was long- 
er retained in this^ than in the other fciences. The prede^ 
ceflbr of the prcfent profeflbr was the firft who prelc£W 
on Jujliniatis Inftitutes in Englifli \ and this example has for 
xnany years, been followed in the prele£lions upon the Paiw 
deds. It may be mentioned, as a ftrong inftance of prepd*^ 
feflion in faVour of antient ufages, that, upon this lad inno* 
vation, the Faculty of Advocates made application to the Uni- 
Verfity of Glafgow, requefting ** that the old praflice of 
** teaching the civil law, in Latin, might be rcftorcd.**-^ 
The profeflbr of lawj befidcs lefturing regularly upon the 
Inftitutes and Fande£ts of Juflinian, delivers annually a 
^ourfe of Icftures on the principles of civil government, ia- 
cludtng a particular account of the Briti{h conftitution \ and, 
^very fecond year a courfc of lectures on the law of Scot* 
land. 

Medicine, — The profeflbrs and lefturets, in the medical 
department, it would appear, have been lefs limited than 
thofe in fome of the other parts of literature, by the cfFefi of 
old inftitutions and prejudices. They have thus been enabled

liberal education. 

ImprovemenU. -^Tht Univcrfity of GlafgoWi as has been 

already obferved, was anciently poffefTcd of a jurifdiftion fi- 

milar to that of the other univerfities of Europe, and exer« 

cifed a fimihr difcipline and authority over its caembers. A 

great part of the {Indents were accommodated with lodgings 

in the' College, and dined at a common table, under the in- 

^£iion of their teachers. While this mode of living conti« 

nuedy almofl every thing was the fubje£l of Teftri£lions and 

regulations. But, for a long time, this pra£lice has been 

difcontinued, and the feverity of the ancient difcipline has 

been a good deal relaxed. Ths lodgings in the college rooms» 

after the difufe of the common table, became lefs conveni* 

ent ; and, at prefent, no iludents live within the College, but 

a few of conGderable (landing, whofe regularity of conduct 

is perfeflly known and afcertained. 

Thefe deviations from the ancient ufage were introduced 
from the experience of many inconveniencies attending it. The 
common table, by colleding a multitude of (Indents fo fre- 
quently together, afforded encouragement and temptations 
to idlenefs and diflipation; and, though the mailers fat at 
table along with the iludents, yet few advantages of conver- 
facion could be attained. Contrivances were fallen upon to 
remedy that defe£l, by appointing one of the iludents (gene- 
rally a burfar, or fervitor ) to read a portion of Scripture, or 
of fome ufeful book, while the reil of the (Indents were at 
table. But this pra£lice, it is obvious, in fuch circumilan- 
ces, w^ more likely to bring ridicule upon the fubjcfls, or 
at lead to occafion indifference or conttmpt, than to be pro- 
du£live of improvement. Befides, from \\ general alteration 
in the habits and manners of the people^ the academical

rules, in thcfe 'matters, were found trouyefomc both to the 
teachers and the ftudents. Hence, attendance at the coRimon 
table hccamc a kind of drudgery to the mailers, from which 
they endeavoured to efcape, or to which they fubmitted in 
their turns with relu£lance ; while the ftudcnts procured dif- 
penfations, or pcrmiffions to have their commons in their 
own apartments. This latter was found to be a fource cf 
cxpencc and diflipation, not more unfriendly to literature 
than to morals, llfie common table, it is faid, became a 
fource of mifmanagement and impofition, which could not 
eafily be remedied. 

This change in the mode of living has been attended with 
much comfort and fatisfa£lion to all the members of die 
Univerfity, by fuperfeding many ftrift regulations, and of 
courfe rigorous petialties, which, in the former ficuation, 
had been thought ncceflary : neither has it produced any bad 
eSclk upon the manners and behaviour of the {Indents. AVhen 
teachers are attentive to perform their duty, and difcover an 
anxiety to promote the intetcfts of their fcholars, who arc a- 
bove the age of mere boys, it requires very little authority to 
enforce refpeft and propriety of behaviour. The moft cer- 
tain and cfFeflual mode of difcipHne, or rather the heft me- 
thod of rendering difcipline in a great meafure ufclefs is by 
filling up regularly and properly the' time of the ftudent, by 
int( refting him in the objeAs of his Rudies and purfuits, and 
by demanding, regularly and daily, ap account of his la- 
hours. 

Boardifig.^^ln the prefent ftate of the Univerfity of Glaf- 

gow, fuch of the ftudcnts, as can afford the expence, frequent* 

ly live in the families of the Principal and Profeflbrs ; where 

they have, together with the opportunity of profecuting their 

^ ftudies, the advantages of proper fociety and private toition.

It iB^ at the fame time, in the power of ercry profeflbr, to be 
acqaainted with the behaviouri the application) and the abi« 
lities of almoft every one of his ftudeots. And the know* 
ledge of this is likely to be much more effeflual in exciting 
their exertbns^ and producing regular attention to their ftu* 
dies, than the endlefs penalties^ which may be contrived, for 
eyery fpecies of mifdemeanoiir. A complicated and rigo« 
rous difcipline, extending to innumerable frivolous obfervan* 
cies, can hardly fail, in this age, to become contemptible; 
and, if ftudents are treated lil^c children, it is not to be ex- 
peded that they will behave like M£n. 

IVeekly Mecting.^^Eytrj Saturday there Is a general meet- 
ing of all the public^ or gowned ftudents, which is attended 
by the Principal and their refpe£%ive Frofeflbrs. A Latin 
oration is delivered by the higher ftudents, in their turns : 
after whichy all fmaller matters of difcipline are difcufled. 
By this weekly meeting, the whole of the ftudents are brought, 
in a more particular manner, under the infpe£tion of their 
teachers ; and a good opportunity is regularly afforded of 
mutual information^ refpeQing the ftudies and deportment 
of their fcholars* 

Te/ls not nquind.'^Vio oaths, or fubfcriptions, or i^s of 
any kind, are Required of ftudents, at their admiiGon to the 
XJniverfity ; as it is deemed highly improper that young per- 
fons, in profecuting a general courfe of academical educa« 
t4on fliould bind themfclves to any particular fyftem of te- 
nets or opinions.

be given, in thofc feminariesy by fuch as obtain academical 
degrees, accompanied with various exclufivc privileges. 

It has of iate been remarked, that fuch inftitutions and regu- 
lations, though intended to promote the intercft cf thofc in- 
corporatcd focieties, have proved, in fome degree, hurtful to 
them, by forcing an attendance from a greater number of ilu- 
dents, and confcquently tending to fupcrfede the induftry and 
abilities of the rcfpe£live teachers. But the number of this dc- 
fcription of (Indents, commonly called hurfars^ at the Univcr- 
(ity of Glafgow, cannot have any confiderable tendency of thii 
nature, as their honorariums make but a fmall part of the pro- 
fefibi^s income ; and, it muft not b: overlooked, that the 
payment of fees to the profeflbrs fuppofes that leftures arc 
to be given : fo that this ellablifliment encourages, at lead, 
the practice of Icfluring, however it may tend to produce 
carclefsnefs in the performance. One good efFeft of it is ob- 
vious. Several of thefe burfaries are in the gift of the Col- 
lege ; fo that the Principal and ProftfTors have it in their 
power to bellow them upon {Indents of fuperior genius and 
indulliy, but who have not the means of profccuting their 
ftudi.s. — The charafter of a burfar does not, in the Univcr- 
fity of Glaf^ow, carry with it any external marks of fcrviliiy, 
or degradation of any kind. Several names might be here 
mentioned, that would do great honour to the Univcrfity, 
who were fupported, durirtg the courfe of tlieir ftudies, by 
funds appropriated for that purpofe. . 

The foundation by Mr. Snell deferves particularly to be 
mentioned, as perhaps one of the largefl and moil liberal in 
Britain. That gentleman, in the year 1688, bequeathed a 
confiderable eftate in Warwickfliire for the fupport of ^iitcb 
Jludents at Baliol College, Oxford, who had ftudied for 
fjpme years at the UniverCty of Glafgow. By the rife in the

Rules for obtaining Degrees* — ^The candidates, for degrees 
in arts, arc, by exprcfs regulations, obliged to attend the 
hours of leflure, and the feparate hours of examination, in 
the curriculum, or public courfe already mentioned ; and the 
laws of the church oblige all ftudents to pafs the fame atrrh^ 
culum, before they ican be inrolled ftudents of theology. 
But no fuch qualification is requifite for entering upon the 
ftudy of law, or medicine. Such ftudents, in fhort, as are 
not upon any public foundation, or who do not intend to 
qualify themfclves for the church, may attend any of the 
ledlures which they think moil fuited to their views ; though, 
in cafe of their deviating from the curriculum, they have not 
the benefit of the regular examinations and exercifes of the 
public ftudents. 

The rules, for conftrring degrees, were formerly much 
the fame in the Uaiverfity of Glafgow as in the other ancient 
univerfities. In chofc days, when the art of difputation wa^ 
con&amp;dered as the ultimate objeA of academical education^ 
the candidates were obliged, after a certain ftunding, or rc- 
fidence at the Univcrfity, to compofc and print a thefis, and 
to defend it in a public fyllogiftic difputation. But experi^ 
ence difcovered that mode of trial to be inadequate to the 
purpofe for which it was intended. It, by degrees, degene- 
rated 



46 Stati/iical Account 

rated into a mere matter of form and ceremony. The fame 
fubjeds of difputation^ the fame arguments of attack and de- 
fence, were prefenred and handed down among the (Indents; 
the public difputations were not attended ;— fo that degrees 
became not the rewards of abilities and diligence, but merelf 
the marks of {landing, or refidence at the Univerfity- Thefc 
circumftances gave occafion for a material change, in the 
rules for conferring degrees, in the Univerfity of Glafgow. 
The compoGng and defending a theCs have now become op- 
tional, on the part of the candidate. The fame (landing is 
ftill required; and the candidates for degrees in arts are 
obliged to undergo a minute examination, in the Greek and 
Roman cladics, in the di(Ferent branches of philofophy which 
compofe the curriculum^ and by each of the profeflbrs in their 
refpc£live branches : an examination which, in the manner 
it is conduced, gives the bed opportunity of judging of the 
proficiency and literature of the candidates. 

Degrees in Theology and Law. — Degrees in theology, haf^ 
ing no privileges in the church attached to them, under th^ 
Prefbyteri^n form of government, are, without any regard 
to (landing in the Univerfity, conferred qn clergymen refpec- 
table for their abilities and literature. — Degrees in law arc ci- 
ther beftowed upon eminent men, as marks of refpe£l \ or 
upon (ludents of a certain (landing, after a regular examina? 
lion of the candidate.— The Univerfity of Glafgow admits 
(ludents who have pafTed a part of their academical courfe in 
other univerfities, ad e^ndem, as it is commonly called : that 
is, whatever part of their academical courfe is finifhed tc 
•any other univerfity, upon proper certificates, is admitted, as 
a part of their (landing, in the Univerfity of Glafgow ; (b 
that, without again beginning their courfe, they can pi&amp; 
fprward to degrees, and be enrolled (ludents of tlieology.

Upon proper certificates of having finifhed it at fome eminent

both a private and public examination, on all thediilerent 
branches of medicine, before they can receive that honour. 
It is very common alfo for them, though not abfolotely re- 
quiredj to defend a thefis in the common hall. 

Pmes. — ^The inftitution of Prizes, or rewards of literary 
merit, either in books or medals, to ftudents, during the 
€ourfe of their education, has now been tried for many years 
in the UnivcrGty of Glafgow, and has been attended with 
the beft efFedls, Every effort has been made to correft the 
common defe£ls and irregularities in the diftribution of pri- 
ses, and to render the competition fair and equah Subjedls 
t)f competition are prefcribed, calculated to give fcope to eve- 
ry kind of genius, and accommodated to the (landing of the 
difierent ftudents. 

Library. — ^The Univerfity Library, to winch all the ftu- 
dents have eafy accefs, is a iarge and valuable colledtion of 
books, among which are many how become very fcarce. 
As it was founded about two centuries ago, it is enriched 
with maLy early editions; and proper attention has been 
paid, from time to time, to fupply it with the more elegant 
and improved produ£Hons of the Prefs, particularly in the 
claflical departments. The funds, which are deftined for its 
fopport and incrcafe, are confiderable ; and many private do- 
nations of books have been made to it from time to time. 
It was of late greatly enriched, in the mathematical depart- 
ment, by the library of the late celebrated Dr. Robert Sim- 
soMj profcflbr of mathematics. By the ingenuity of the late

are annually appointed, out of the number of thofe iludents 
who continue at the Univerfity after they have received their

been ordained, or have received licences, occaConally preach 
in the College chapel during the fcflion.

Additions and Corre^ions. 

Iftfirmary.-'^Thc medical fchool in this UniverGty was long 
tctarded by the want of an Infirmary at Glafgow. But that 
obfiacle is now completely removed. In the year 1 790, a to- 
luntary fubfcription was opened, for the purpofe of crefting, 
and fupporting an Infirmary, in this place, for the weftcrn di- 
ilri£b of Scotland. Tliis fcheme met with the moft liberal 
cncouragemetiti from the charitable and well-difpofed, in the 
city of Glafgow, and in the adjoining counties, and was in 
particular much promoted by the adtivity and influence of 
the members of the Univerfity. In the year 17919 upon the 
petition of the fubfcribers, a royal charter was obtained from 
the Crown, together with a grant of the fcitc of the Archbi- 
(hop's Caftle and Garden, for the purpofe of erecting the 
buildings. During the years 179a and 1793, the buildings 
were ere«^ed, according to a moft beautiful defign given by 
the late Robert Adam, £fq. architeA, at an expence of abouC 
8000L : And it is believed, that, in point of fituation, good 
air, abundance of water, and convenient accommodation for 
the patients, this Infirmary is not excelled by any other efh- 
blifliment of the fame kind in Britain. The Infirmary was 
opened for the reception of patients on the 8th December 
1 794 ; and fince that time, the beneficial and falutary efiecb 
of it have been {o much felt, that it is now confidered as a 
public benefit and blefilng to this part of the country. Among 
other advantages, the number of medical ftudents is greatly 
increafed fince it was opened ; and there is every reafon to 
believe, that this inftitution will contribute, in a great degree, 
to the further extenfion and improvement of the medical 
fchool in this Univerfity.

<p>Introduction- 



It may be remarked, to the credit of Great Britain, that 
its inhabitants have not only ercfted fome very celebrated 
Univerfities at home, but have alfo been the means of cfta- 
blifhing fimilar inftitutions in foreign countries. At firft, 
theft inftitutions refembled in fome refpefts fchools, more 
than Univerfities ; only two faculties, that of Arts and that 
of Theology, having place in them : afterwards, however, 
two others. Law and* Medicine, were added j which com- 
pleted the whole courfe or fyftem of education as then 
taught. It is but juftice to Scotland here to obferve, how 
much the revival of learning may be attributed to natives of 
that country *. Of this, the French in particular were fo

^ There arc fome differences between the Bull of Alexander VI. and the

fonwho drew up Pope Alexander's Bull for Aberdeen, had that of Pope Ni- 
cho^ifi before him ; or perhaps there w.s a general form for all fuch grants,

arife among the members of the Univerfity. 

By the firft foundation, dated 1505, and confirmed by 
Pope Julius's Bull in 1506, he ere£b and endows unum Col" 
legium fchdlarium Jludentium et magj/lrorum fub vocabulo sancta

fons ; but by the fecond foundation, confirmed by a Bull of 
Pope Clement Vll. 1526, the number was augmented to 42 : 
viz. 4 Dodors in the faculties of Theology, Canon Law, Civil 
Law, and Medicine ; the firft of thefe to be called Principal ; 
S Mafters of Arts, whereof the firft to be called Sub^princi- 
pal, the iecond, Grammarian, and the other fix, Students in 
Theology ; 6 Batchelors in Arts ; (all the above, except the 
rnediciner, to be in prieft's orders 0^3 poor fcholars ; 8 pre- 
bends for the fervice of the church, of which the firft to be 
Cantor, the fecond Sacrift ; and 6 finging boys. 

Original Con/lit ution.^'^t appears from the foregoing ftate« 
Bient, that, though an Univerfity had been eftablifhed m the 
city of Old Aberdeen in 1494, yet no college was founded 
within it till 1506. During the years that intervened be- 
tween the time of inftituting the Univerfity and that of found- 
ing the college, doctors, mafters and ftudents exifted, and 
were endowed in the Univerfity by popes' bulls and royal do- 
nations ; but they did not form a college. They might re- 
fide, ftudy and teach in any place within the Univerfity, but 
. were, fubjeft to no particular rules or difcipline. To prevent 
the inconveniences that might thence arife, was the intention 
of Bilhop Elphinfton in founding his college ; and, as it is 
the only one that has ever been erefted in this Univerfity, it 
therefore pofieiles within itfelf the whole rights and privile- 
ges of an univerfity. This college having been foon after ta-

was found exceedingly inconvenient ; few of the ftudents in 
divinity made fuch progrefs during the prefcribed term of fix 
years, as to be found qualified for the degree of D. D. ; and 
befides, the time of continuance t)f the regency was confidcred 
to be fo fhort, that when one fet had accomplifhed their 
courfe, others could not be found to fucceed them. Theft 
inconveniences having been reprefented to Pope Paul the 
Third, by William Stewart, bifhop of Aberdeen, his Holi* 
nefs, by a breve irtduki, anno 1538, prorogued -the term of fix 
years *, and allowed thefe regents and ftudents in theology to 
continue to refide in the college, and exercife their fiinftions, 
until others were found willing and fit to fucceed them, and 
as long as the biihop of Aberdeen for the time fhould think 
proper. We ihall'fee afterwards in what manner thefe regu-

known to have been at tjjat time cftabliflicd in the other tini* 
terfities of Scotland. It i&amp; probable that this early infticutioxi 
of a medical profeflbrfliip in the Uniterfity of Aberdeen^ was 
owing to the King's own prcdileftion for that fcience, in which 
he is faid to have been *' a willing and a fkillful practi- 
tioner V and we find certain annud rents mentioned in the 
foundation^ as particularly afligned by the King for tlie Sup- 
port of this office. Fhyficians appear to have been in great 
requeft about that time in the north of Scotland ; for in ijoj 
the town council of Aberdeen appointed lo merks yearly to 
be paid to James Cuiiiin, phyfician, to induce him to ftay in 
the town ; " till he could be provided with a falmon fifhing 
•• of the ufual rent, but without paving any grafliim." TRiis 
is probably the fame James Cumin who died profeflbr of me- 
dicine .in 152 1 ; and he appears to have been the firfl whd 
held that office. 

Bjfljcp Elphtfjfton partiaJarly attached io the JtuJy if Law.^^ 
In the early part of his life, Bifhop Elphin(hn had been at- 
tached to the ftudy of law, which he had taught for 
fix years in the univerfity of Paris with great applaufe. He 
had a£led as official under the bifhop of Glafgow and arch^ 
bifhop of St. Andrews : and large nianufcript compilations of 
canon law, made by him, are *ilill prcfcrved in eleven vo- 
lumes folio in the library of the univerfity. Thcfc habits ol 
jludy will account for the particular attention he paid to th^ 
fcience of law, by inftituting two profeflorfhips in that facul* 
[ ty 5 and with much probability we may afcribe to his fug- 

I geftion, that fingtlar aft of parDamcnt enforcing the fhidy of 

[ the laipr, which has been celebrated as worthy of the antient 

kgiilators. It was paffcd in 1494; the fame year in which

History. 

Commencement of Education, — ^It cannot be determined from 
any of the college records, how long it was after the date of 
Pope Alexander's bull of ereftion, before the teaching and 
le£hires began. We may take it for granted that at lead nine 
years elapfed, as the date of BiOiop Qpliinfton's firft foua« 
dation is anno 1505. This point might have been determi- 
iled with fufficient precifion, if Heftor Boece, when defcrib- 
ing very particularly his polite reception, by the canons of 
the cathedral of Aberdeen, on his arrival from Paris, had 
thought proper to fubjoin a date : for his words (vitse p. 2, 
fol. 26,) imply, that the teaching muft have begun upon hi^ 
arrival, and, as appears from his relation, with' the happieft 
confequences : " £xa^a inde et perfeveranti diligenti^ effec-

66 Siati/lical Account of the 

Additional Revenue by' James IK and Bijhcp Elphin/icn, — To 
the original endowments of the univerGty, confiiling of the 
revenues of the hofpital of St. Germains at Tranent in Lo- 
thian, (which comprehended the churches of Aberluthnotr 
Glenmyck and Abergardyn,) King James IV. added the 
^ tithes of the parifhes of Slains Auchindore and TiUyne&amp;le, 
in the. county of Aberdeen ; with certain hnds and annual rents 
in the county of Banflf. Bifhop Elphinfton likewiie added 
the lands of Balnakettle Mundnrno, Berryhill and others, in 
the county of Aberdeen j moft of which have been loft by 
various accidents, and fome of them repurchafed. 

jBw/j/m^/.— At his own expence chiefly, but not withcrat 
fome aid from royal munificence, the bifhop built the nece&amp; 
fary edifices, in a ftyle certainly magnificent for Scotland in 
that age ; and fuch of thofe buildings as remain not muc^i 
changed, bear teftimony to the good tafte of the founder. 

Profejfar/ G/fi//.— Having with great pains been able t« 
accompliih the purchafe of various lands adjoining to and 
furrounding the edifice, to the extent of 24 acres \ he a{- 
propriated thefe for the glebes, gardens and houfes of the 
profefibrs.

69 Staii/iical Account of the 

Prmcipal Andirfon.-^ohn Biflet became Principal afto" 
William Hay, but rciigned his office, at the end of fix years, 
in favour of Alexander Anderfoh, who was Principal at the 
time of the Reformation. Pripcipal Anderfon's learning is 
commended, and his fpirit in defending the edifice from a 
mob of reformers, whofe purpofc was to have dripped it of 
the leaden roof and the bells, in the fame manner as they 
had treated the cathedral. But perceiving, afterwards, that j 
the whole Roman Catholic eftabliibment was going to wrecks I 
and from the hatred he bore to the reformed religion, he ali- | 
enated fome of the college revenue, deftroyed feveral of its 
charters, whereby many of the lands and rei«ts of^ the hot 
pital of St. Germains were quite loft \ and fold the orna- 
^lents, books and furniture belonging to the. College. In 
1569 he was expelled by the commiffioners of vifitation, to- 
gether with all the other members, on account of their ad- 
herence to Popery. 

Principal Arhuihiot. ^^The Regent Earl of Murray was 
perfonally prefent, and beflowed the office of Principal on 
Mr Alexander Arbuthnot, whofe character ftands yery high 
for learning and worth, and the influence which he poffefled 
among his contemporaries. In his time the revenue of the 
College received confiderable additions, particularly the 
tithes belonging to the deanry and fub-chantery of Aberdeen, 
which were beflowed by KLing James VI. and which now 
conflitute the principal part of its remaining income. 

Nova Fundatio, — ^In the year 1578, vifitors were appoint- 
ed, by authority of Parliament, for new-modelling the ftatc 
of the three Scotch Univerfities 5 and in 1592 the nova fun- 
datio of King's College was drawn up, in name of the profef- 
iors, and received the ratification of Parliament in 1597.— 

By 



Unherftiy and Kin^s College of Aberdeen. ^ 

By this model, which nearly refemblcd thofe adopted for the 
Univcrfitics of St. Andrews and Glaigow, the whole cfta- 
bliflinient ¥ras reduced to a Principal, with four regents, a 
profefibr of humanity, and fome burfars. 

Principal Redfs Dilapidations.'-'^ PibovX this time, David 
Rait, Principal of the G)llege, feued off the manfes and glebes 
belonging to the profeflbrs of medicine, civil law, canon law 
and humanity: and, holding the office of procurator or 
fteward, together with that of Principal, in his own perfon, 
for twenty years, he is accufed of committing vlilanidntions, 
or peculations rather, in various ways, for his private advan- 
tage, and that of hb friends. 

Bljhop Forbes checks thefe abufes ; 55*r.— -Bllhop Forbes put 
an end to thefe abufes, in 1619. Having procured a royal 
con^niffion of vifitation, in which he prcfided, he called the 
offending Principal to account, and obliged him to refund in 
fome meafure : yet treating him very i^pntly, in, refpeft of 
his learning, he allowed him to hold his office during 
life. It was not without much difficulty and labour, conti- 
nued for feveral years, that tliis worthy prelate was able to 
recover the glebes and manfes fo unwarrantably feued cffi 
together with fome part of the other property of the fociety 
which had been alienated and embezzled. He alfo, at the 
fame time, obtained a ratification and renovation, by Parlia- 
ment, of the original foundation j in confequence of which, 
he reftored all the offices abolifhed by the nova fundatioy ex- 
cepting only thofc of the chaplains and finging boys of the 
choir, which the change of religion had rendered no long.T 
neceffary. The* cantor, however, was retained ; and f ems, 
about this tim? t '• :vc got the defipnv.;on of profeflbr of 
mufic. llic comtitution, thus re-eftablilhcd, was ratified in 

the 



fm Sf^ii/tifal Account of the 

the moft ample manner by an Aft of Parliament in 1633 : 
but, in 1639, commiilloners from the General Aflemblyy at 
diat time more powerful than Parliament, fuppreffed the of* 
fices of canonift and cantor^ a$ being fuperfiuous. 

Thus, contnuy to what has happened at St. Andrew's 
and Glafgow, the original foundation of this College lliU 
continues in force with very few exceptions. The moft inaf- 
tcrffal alteration introduced by the nova funddtio regarded the 
fudentes in theologian or regents in arts ; who, in confcqucncc 
of it, became " fuatuor regentes qui juventute infliiuend^ pnt/ini 
•* it PrifKifali auxiliaren/ur, quorum unus p^fi Pnndpakm Jui^- 
•* principals dicitur^ cut quarta claffls eorhmijfa efiP The fourth 
icgent was to be prafeBus prima et infirm^ clajjisy in which he 
taught the Greek language; and the fecond and third bad 
their fcveral dq)artments in philofophy and mathematics af» 
Cgncd to them : and thus all of them became fixed and pcTi- 
snanent maftcrs and regents in the College. This confiitti 
tion, thus introduced, continued, jiotwithftanding the refto- 
ration of Biihop Elphinfton's foundation: the regents at 
that period, and down to the prefent time, appearing, fironi 
the records of the Univerfity, to have been permanent, and 
to enjoy all the privileges of the other mafters, fuch as fitting 
at college meetings, and voting at ^1 eleftions *• 

* About the year T74T the rights and privilcfeg of the regreots were called 
m qirt ftion, on occafioo of the elc^on of Sir WilUatn Forbes to the office of 
civilid : and a procefs of declarator havirg been raUed bciore the Court of $eP 
fion by .Sir W.liiam and the Regents againfb Principal George Chalmers and 
the uoailcrs on the oppofite fide of the queftion, Sir William's ele^ion ira* 
fouu«l good, on account of the regents votes being fufUined ; and as a fcparacc 
bead of declarator, it was found that the regents had a permanent right to fit 
in all college meetings, and to vote iji all eleifiions. and enjoy every privilege 
competent to the other mcmben of Biihop £lphinfton*s fouodatioo.

I 9f divinity was added to the founded members of the Uoi- 
yerHtyy by contributions from the bifhop and clergy of the 
dioceie of Aberdeen ; and the election of the profeiTor vefted 
in the moderator of the provincial fynod of Aberdeen, i*^ith 
two delegates from each of the eight prefbj^teries which coo- 
ftitute the fynod, the Principal and dean of the faculty of 
theology of King's College, together with another of its mem- 
bers chofen by the College for that purpofe.— The money be- 
longing to this fund was fome time after employed in pur- 
chafing lands in th^ parilh of Kinnellar ; on which King 
Charles the Firft granted a charter, dated March 12th, 16/^2^ 
in favour of Mr Adam Barclay, then profcflbr of divinity^ 
and his fucceiibrs in office. In this charter are infcrted tlxc 
rules rdatmg to the eledlion of a profeflor, and the powers 
of the iynod, with refpe£l to his office and revenues. The 
election is to be made on a comparative trial, after ifluing 
programs for that purpcfe ; and the different heads of ex- 
amination are particularly fpecified. In 17531 the fynod, on 
the reprefentation of ProfefTor LumUen, the then incumr 
bent^ feued the above lands inperpet^um to the College. 

Revitiue of the Sit of Aberdeen fronted to tin Kin^s and Ala^ 
rifcbal Colleges. — Upon the abolition of Epifcopacy in Scot- 
land» in the year 1641, King Charles I. granted the revenu: 
•f the fee of Aberdeen to tlie King's and Marifchal Colleges, 
affigning two third parts to King's College : which gift was 
ratified in Parliament, (unprinted Aft 169), and by his royal 
charter he united them under the name of " The Caroline 
Univerfiry.*' This union was confirmed by Oliver Cromwell, 
A. D. 1654, and continued till the Reftoration *, when Aft 
'Sth, Pari. I, Charles II. and Aft 1% SeflT. 2d, refcinding 
all the Afts of the Parliament 1640, reftoring Epifcopacy, 

and 



72 Staiiftlcat Actouni of the 

and annulling all a£b, gifts and deeds in prejudice of the fc- 
veral bifhopricks,— put an end to that union, and annihilated 
the objeA of* it. When Epifcopacy was again abolifhed, at 
the Revolution, the revenue of the bifhoprick was different- 
ly applied. 

Marquis of Huntly^ Chancellor of Caroline Unrver/lfy.^GcoT^ 
Marquis of Huntly was elected chancellor of the Caroline 
Univerfity by a meeting of the members, held in King's 
College, January 1643. 

Members e:petted for refufmg io fign the Corr.w/?/.— During 
theie times of confufion, feveral members 61 the college were 
expelled for refufing to fign the covenant 5 and among thefe were 
Dr Leflie, Principal, and Dr Forbes, profeflbr of divinity : two 
of the moft diftinguifhed of thoft Aberdeen doAors, (as they 
were then called,) who, in the years 1638 and 1639, had 
maintained the controverfy with the Covenanters, and on 
whofe learning and loyalty Lord Clarendon has beftowed a 
Very liberal encomium *.— Dr Leflie was deceived into the fa- 
mily of the Earl of Huntly. Circumftances of peculiar hard- 
ihip attended Dr Forbes's cafe. He was the very learned 
fen of that Btfhop who had fo lately reftored the original 
fcunilation of the College ; and having been elected profet- 
fcr of divinity, he had purchafcd a houfe, in Old Aberdeen,

A Angular fort of vifitation took place in i6f i* General 
Monk fent five Colonels to viiit and reform the colleges, viz; 
Defborough, Feawick, Mdeley, Owen and Smith. Hiey 
remonrcd from their offices Principal Gnildi wi^h fevcral pf

both which refpe^ tbev w highly approved, but for fome 
want of exa£l conformity to th^ ftandard of theological opi-

the other members who fuccceded^ are commended as learn- 
ed and prudent men. . In odier refpe^j.howevo** thefe mi- 
litary vifitofs treated the college not unkindly* The large 
famldiAg ereAed at this time, on the north-eail comer of the 
court, for the accommodation of the ftudents, is faid to have 
been greatly forwarded by a contribution ftqta General 
Monk's oflSicers.

PrtjeBed Umm of the Km^t and Marifcbal CoUegef.-^^Tbc 
vnion of the King's and Marifchal Colleges of Aberdeen has 
often been projeded ; but yarious caufes have hitherto pre- 
^vented it from taking pbce. In 17471 the members of both 
Colleges propofed a fcheme^ which they had concerted for 
that purpofe ; bat the magiftrates of Aberdeen determined, to 
oppofe it unlefs it (hould be previoufly agreed upon, that 
the feat of the United College ihoold be fixed in Aberdeen. 
Another fcheme in 1754 was brought to a confidexable do- 
grce of maturity. It was propofed to incorporate the funds 
of both focicties into one common ftock, fo as to anfwip* the 
foUomig purpofes : xft. To make proper endowments for ak

Infuperable difiiculties again occurred in determining the

to fall to the ground at that time. Other fchemfts of unioft

were enaAed by the College, and fubmltted to the examina- 
tion of the public. In framing thefe regulations, the cele- 
brated Dr Reid's opinion, and views refpedking education, are 
fuppofed in general to have prevailed. It was determined 
that the feffion of College fhould be prolonged from five 
months to feven, beginning on the firft Monday of OAober 
and ending in May s that the ftudents mould all lodge with- 
in the College, in chambers provided for them at an eaiy 
rent ; the College gates being locked at nine, and the cham- 
bers vifited after that hour, by one of the profeilbrs in week- 
ly rotation : that the (Indents fhould all boird at a common 
table kept within the College, at a regulated and very mode- 
rate rate, where one pr more of the profeflbrs were to be 
confhntly prefect: that the fhiAeft pundhiali^y ihouki b« 
obferved by the fbidents in their attendance at ledhires, dur- 
ing the whole of the feffion: that lefs time than ufual fhould

neith all conrenient ipeed.— For ibfiie yeari the good eflSaAa 
of thefc regulations feemed very flattering, and the mafters 
thought they niight congratulate themfelves upon ^ having 
** under their care a fet of the moft regular and diligent ftu- 
** dents to be found any where in the king's domiidon^ •."^ 
Bat oonfiderable difficulties by degrees occurred in coaduA- 
ing the economy of the public table. It was not found that 
lodging fo many young men together within the walk of the 
College was attended with all the expefled advantages. Hie 
number of ftudents diminiflied apace : fome were dilguAed 
with the ftriA difcipline and regular attendance required : 
many could not fupport the expence of the prolonged fA 
fion : it had been thought proper in order to enable the bor* 
fars to defray this encreafed expence that the fmali burfaries 
In the gift of the College (hould be united) and two of them 
conferred on the fame burfar : doubts began to- be entertain* 
ed concerning the legality of this proceeding : the burfaries 
were therefore (eparated again : the length of the ieffion was 
{reluftantly on the part of the College) reduced to its former 
period of five months, and the ftudents left at liberty to 
lodge and board in the town or within the College, as they 
might chufe; but all the other regulations enacted by the fta*

42 peribns, of who&amp;l 2 i were in priefts orders. ' Thcfe are 
how reduced to 23 in confeqiience of the change in religion^

ing leAures on Grecian hiftory and antiquities. 

PbUo/bpbifial Cmrytz-r-Though Greek became -the depart* 
.ment of a feparate profeflbr about the beginning of this cen- 
tury : Philofophy in its threefold diviiion, as comprehending 
the fciences of quantity, of matter, and of mind, has conti- 
fiued to be taught by the fame perfon during three fucceflive 
-feffions* This method has always had its zealous advocates ^ 
in the number of thefe was the late pr Reid, who had ex- 
fKrience of both plans, having taught for many years in this 
Univerfity, and afterwards in that of Glafgow. It certainly 
-poflefies fome advantages efpeciaUy when confidered in its 
relation to the local ciccu^nftances of this Univerfity. In a 
Milage, where parents cannot have acquaintance or relations, 
to whom they may intruft the fupcrintendance of thoir chil* 
dren's conduct, it feems neceiTary that the conne£tion betwixt 
the profefibr and ftudent, fhoi^ld be more clofe and intimate, 
ihan can be the cafe ^in the rapid rotation of annual claifos. 
The teacher being acquainted with the abilities and literary 
-attainments of his pupil, and the ^dudent accyftomed to the 
method and arrangement cif lus teacher, they .may each be 
xnalded to pafs over with advantage, a larger extent of fubjecl 
than could otherwife be accompliXhed in the fame time. It 
/eems to afibrd additional incitements to application and dili- 
.gcncc. The ftudent confcious that his condu£^ is watched 
•with an almoft parental folieitude, is anxious to fecure the 
approbation of one, with whom he is more than tranfiently 
jcono^fled. The teacher confidering himfelf as folely re-

thus alternately devolve on the fame perfon^ and confiderijig

may be ; has, as a preparatory ftep towards farther impiove*

Though the method of teaching and a ir^ n g e m ent of fub* 
jt^ adopted by each profeilbr muft neceflarily vary to a co^ 
tain degree, yet that generally practifed in this UnivetfiCft 
feems well calculated to lead the minds of youth in a natnnl 
progreffion to the atts^inment of ufefiil feience. The pro&amp;t 
ibrs in the philofophlcal departmejat teach three hours every 
day of the week, except Saturday and Sunday; on Sumfcf

Magtfirand Clafs.^^The fcience of aftronomy employs the 
fieginning of the fourth ye^, and completes the phyfical part 
of the conrfe* Under the term moral philofophy, which 
forms the prindpal part of the inftru^iion of the fourth yeau^j 
is comprehended every thing that relates to the abftraA fcien- 
tes, or the philofophy of mind \ particularly pneumatolo- 
gfy or an analyfis of the mental faculties, whether of an in* 
tdltdoal or a£live nature ) natural theology ; ethicS) or prac* 
tical morality; logic, including rhetoric, together with eco- 
nomics ; jurifprudence, and politics. According to the an- 
cient prance cf this Univerfity, logic, and the abftraft fcicn- 
CCS, took precedence, in the order of the curriculum, of ma- 
thematics and natural philofophy. It was then believed that 
the elements rf the other fciences muft be taught to dilad- 
vantage, while the ftiident remained ignorant of the art of 
feafoning and the rules of judging : but mankind are now 
fuHy convinced of the ineflScipficy of the fyllogilVic art, to 
guide the underftanding in the difcovery of truth. The lo- 
gic which can anfwer this end muft have, for its ground 
work, all arts and fciences, and be founded on an analylis 
fM nature hiftory of the intclleftual faculties. Every illuf-

ing the elements of fcience. Man cxerdfes his tinderftand- 
kig before he is formally inflni^led in the rules of reafoning. 
Upon thefe accounts^ logic, together with the other abfiraft 
Sciences, feem more naturally to occupy the laft than the 
firft part of a philofophical courTe ; and affaiated by fuch 
coniiderations, about 40 years ago, the teachers at this Uoi- 
verfity adopted the above mentioned arrangement of -fub* 
jcfts.

Stffion of College — ^The duration of the feffion of College 
has been for a confiderable time paft, five n^onths, coramcD- 
cing on the firft Monday of November. At firft view this 
may appear rather a fliort period to allow of the prde£lio0¥ 
which have been mentioned ; but it fhould be obierved, that 
the profeflibrs teach three hours daily, ^ithpiit any vac^poi)

the ftudy of it net being profeeuted in this part of the coun-^

branch of fcience. 

Medkine. — ^Medicine has hitherto been a branch of educa- 
tion which the Univerfity have been anxious to promote ; 
but from different caufes, it has not fucceeded ; chiefly ow- 
bg to the detached fttuation of the College, with other par- 
ticular local difadvantages, and there being- but one medical 
profeiTor in the Univeriity. Several of the incumbents have 
made various attempts; and amongft others, the late Dr John 
Gregory of Edinburgh, at that time profeflbr of medicine in' 
King's College, who, with Dr David Skene, pbyftcian in A- 
berdeen, (an eminent anatomift) opened a clafs in the town^ 
of Aberdeen for teaching anatomy, phyftology, and the prac- 
tice of medici^ie 5 but they met with no fuccefs/and were oblig-

who are known by the name of libertines. Of the burfars, 

13 were inftituted by the founder; the reft derive their fup- 

port from fums of money or lands mortified or bequeathed 

at various periods by difierent donors for that purpofe. Some 

of thefe donors have retained the right of prefentation to 

thefe buriaries to themfelves and heirs -, others have vefted 

it foleiy in the College. Thofe burfaries which are in the 

gift of the College, and which amount to about 50, are diA 

pofed of according to merit, afcertained by a comrparative 

trial, in various Latin exercifrs. This competition takes 

place at the commencement of each feffion, and provides an- 

■ually for 12 or 13 burfars, being a fourth part of the whole 

BunAer. The number of fhsdents ivbo attend the philoib- 

phical courfe is from 100 to 130; that of fhidents of divini* 

ty from 50 to 70. The founded burfars were anciently dil^

fiead of a rpd ; and were alfo obliged to i^d peters at the

the cenibrs in their refpc£Uve clafies, which office obUgei

of the more public a£)s of delinquency. Every morning dur-

pi teachingi in the College Chapel, at which all the ftudents 
regularly attend. The duty of public prayers is taken for a 
week in fiicceffion by the regents, and profeflbcs of humani-

coniidered as the more fpecial fuperintendant of the morals

added to them, the houfes, garden, church, &amp;c. which be* 
longed to the Francifcan or Grey Friars, lying on the eaft 
fide of the Broadgate of Aberdeen ; alfo, the land^, crofts, 
tenements and fox duties formerly belonging to the Domini« 
can or Black Friars, and the Carmelites or White Friars of 
Aberdeen^ whofe conyentd were refpefitively fituated in the

the period of the Reformation* The property of the Fran* 
icifcans had been acquired by the to^n of Aberdeen j and 
their buildings, being nure entire and better iituated than

VoL.UtT* O rifchal.

myfteries of religion, and the hidden treafures of the word 
of God ', to be Well ikilled in the languages, efpeciaDy the 
Hebrew and Syriac, which were to be taught by him ontt 
every week. He is appointed to eitplain the facred writings 
one hour every Monday ; to illuArate, from the Greek, the 
Phyfiology of Ariftotle, beginning where the third or highefl 
regent had left off, towhich was to be added a fhort expli- 
cation of anatomy j to teach the principles of geography, 
chronology and aftronomy, as alfo the Hebrew grammar, to- 
gether with fome practical application of the rule$ ; to confiEf 
the degree of mafter of 'arts on thofc fludents who, after 
paffing through the ufual courfe of four years, fhould be 
found deferving^ of that diftinftionj and to fuperintend the 
public difcipline of the College. He is Hkewife, in the char- 
ter, required, together with the chancellor, reftor and dean 
of faculty, to prefcribe the authors to be explained to the 
ftudents, in the languages in which they originally wrote.

Suffarifs,^^ln i($44, Sir Thomas Crombie, of Kemnay, 
made a donation, to the magiflxates and town council of 
Aberdeen, as truftees and patrons, of certain lands in the 
neighbourhood, as an augmentation to the falaries of the 
profeHbrs, and a provifion for eight burfars in the Univerfi* 
ty, and alfo for a minifter of the College, or Gray Friars 
Kirk. This is fuppofed to have been originally a weekly 
lefhirefhip in theology, chiefly intended for the benefit of 
the fhidents, as that church was never a parochial one, but 
along with the other buildings of the Gray Friars, was con- 
veyed by Lord Marifchal's charter to the College. This pro^- 
vifion, the town council who are now patrons of both offices, 
feem from the beginning to have joined to Mr Copland's ap- 
pointment for a profeilbr of divinity, fo that hitherto they 
have been always occupied by one perfon. Various other 
mortifications, or pious donations, for the education of bur- 
fars, have been made from time to time. In the year 1711, 
Dr Gilbert Burnett, bifhop of Salifbury, by his laft will, be- 
queathed the fum of 20,000 merks, as a fiind for the educa- 
tion of four burfars in philofophy, and two in divinity, in 
this Univerfity, ** in remembrance of my education tbere^* as he 
cxprefles it, the patronage to belong to the family of Burnett 
of Leys, of which he was defcendcd. Four burfaries in phi- 
lofophy, of 15I. fte|:ling each, and four in divinity, of 25I. 
flerling each, were alfp endowed by Mr Gilbert Ramfay, fw- 
merly mentioned ; the patronage of which is vefted in thf 
family of Ramfay of Balmain. Bcfides the above, thp« sfff

four in philoibphyi left by Sir Alexander Inrine of Drum^ 
under the patronage of that family ; four by John Turner, 
Efq. of Danttick ; fix by Dr Duncan Liddel ; and of late, 
twoj by a genUemah of the name of Lorimer \ and one by Dr 
Ruddiman of Madras, with various others, amounting in all 
to between fixty and feventy in philbfophy, from fifty merks 
in yalue to 81. or 9I. together with eight or ten in divinity. 
Many of the fmallcr burfaries are however in the way of be- 
ing increafed \ fome of them by the rife of the value of the 
lands in which they were vcfted; and others, by being allow- 
ed to remain vacant for fome time, the intereft being yearly 
added to the capit?il. Of thefe philbfophy burfariesi fuch as 
are in the gift of private patrons, are di(po(ed of by them at 
pleafure \ while thofe under the patronage of the town and 
CollegCi between forty and fifty, are beftowed by annual 
competition about the end of Oflober, upon the moft deferv- 
ing candidates, and as they continue for four years, ten or 
twelve become vacant every fefilon. There are alfo two bur- 
faries, of lal. fterling each, for the education of fhidents in 
the higher parts of mathematics, founded by John Gray, 
Efq. of London, in 1 768 ; one of which is difpofed of every 
year, by comparative trial, among fuch ftudents as have at. 
tended the two firft mathematical clailes. 

Umon of the two Umver/itiet.*^^Thc King's and Marifchal 
College^ of Aberdeen being diftinf^ and feparate Univerfi- 
ties, totally independent of each other, though fcarcely a 
mile diftant, it has often been propofed and attempted to u- 
hite them either into one univerfity, or intb one college. Af- 
ter the abolition of Epifcopacy in Scotland, King Charles L 
by a charter, dated the 8th Nov. 1641, makes a grant to 
both Uttiverfities of the rents of the bifhopric of Aberdeen, 
for augmenting the falarxes of the mailers and other purpofes,

that both £hall enjoy and exercife all their primitive powers^ 
privileges, and particular jurifdidioni which they, had held 
and exercifed before the faid union took phca* The twd 
Colleges acquiefced in this iwon and ereftion^ trhich wai 
confirmed by an A&amp; of Parliament of the fame month and 
year. They accordingly enjoyed the cttnjunfi pofieiEon of 
the bilhop^s rents for feveral years, and alfo of another doxu^ 
tion afterwards granted by the proteAor Cromwellj in favour 
of the Univeriity of Aberdeen, and two Colleges thereoE 
They chofe a common reftor by turnsi not judging it necei^ 
fary or expedient to elefl any fuperior ma^fbate, and fuh^ 
mitted to Commillions of vifitation under the great feal, ad^ 
drefled to the principals, pro£:fibr£, and mafters of the Uni- 
terfity of Aberdeen. But Charles II. having rcftored Epifco^ 
pacy in Scotland in i66x, the alienated rents of ihe biihop* 
rics were refumed, and at the fame time the bifhop 6f Aber* 
deen, now reinflated hi his office, and chancellor, €x digmtqft, 
of the old College, laying claim to the fame jurifdi£tion over 
the other, the Principal and mafterS maintained the privilege 
ireferved to them by the charter of unioxt, and refufed to iub- 
mit to any chancellor not eleAed by themfelve^. From this 
period, therefore, the A^ of Parliament, confirming the 
union of the two Univerfities, being underfiood to be re- 
fcinded, along with the other a£h of King Charles L firom 
the year 1637, the members of this Univerfity have deded 
and been governed biy their own proper magtfh^te, and havf 
had little public connexion or intercourfe with that of OU 
Aberdeen.

from the oppoiitien of fome 'individuals of the one or the 
other, hitherto without fucceis. Upon the Sth of November 
1754, after various meetings and confultatiotis held for that 
purpofe, ^ the members of both Univerfities unanimouiiv 
agreed to, an4 fiibfcribed certain articles of union, and appli- 
ed to the Dukeof Argyle, then at the head of affairs in Scot- 
land, for his fuj^ort and influence in rendering it efFe£{ual 
and permanent. Bj this agreicment, the number of profeiTor- 
fliips iu the united College was limited to the number then 
exiAing in King's College, with the fingle addition of a pro- 
fefibr of matheo^atics ; and of thofe offices, fuch as Greek, 
philofqpby, medicine, &amp;c. in which each College had a pro- 
feflbr, the half was to be fupprefled 5 one of thefe profeflbrs 
cither refigning in favour of his colleague, or teaching the 
elafs alternately, until the death qt refignation of one of 
ihcm. The rejpeftive pa|Tns of tHcfe double offices were 
|to prefeot by turns, and all the profeflbrs were to receiv'e a 
coi]4idcrable addition to their falaries, put of thofe to be fup-» 
preil^d. The only difficulty retraining to be adjofted was, 
whether the locust or feat of the united College ihould be in 
New or Old Aberdeen? the Marifchal CoU^, vith the ma- 
giilrates of Aberdeen, and other patrons, iniifting on its be« 
ing placed in that city ; while the members of King's College 
ftrongly maintained a contrary opinion* This point being 
therefore at laft referred to the decifion: of the Earl of Fm- 
later, he determined it in favour of New Aberdeen j but in 
confequence of freih remonfhra&amp;ces and oppoiicion on the 
part of King's College, the whole previous agreement fell 
to the ground, and the two Colleges remained feparate as 
before.

pears to have been ufed to efff:Aan union until the year

1 14 Siaiijiical Account of tbe 

1786, when the Principal and profeflbrs of Marifchal Col* 
lege, in conjun£lion with fome of thofe of King's College, 
again proje^ed a plan for uniting them into one, a meaftut 
which they jndged would have been very much for the ad* 
vantage of both, and of the greateft fervice to the education 
of youth over all the northern part of the kingdom. Thej 
sJfo propofed to fupprefs a moiety o all thofe offices ia 
which each College had a profefTor % but In place of fliaring 
the falaries among the offices retained, they propofed em* 
ploying them for the eftabltfhment of new profeiIbrihips» 
fuch as were wanting in both ; and by admitting of no fine- 
cure plac^, to render the united College a complete fchool 
of education jn law and medicine, as well as in all the other 
fciences. This fcheme, having been firft fuggeftcd by the 
Earl of Bute, gt that tinxe chancellor of Marifchal College, 
was warmly patronized by many perfons of rank^ and com- 
munities, Kho were applied to on the oc^afion ; but after a 
^eat deal of argument and difcuffion on both fides, was at 
length fniftrated by the oppofition it met with from a maj07 
rity of the members of Eang' College* 

Plan of £Jucaticn.'^^Ii0Vir long the fyftem of education ap- 
pointed by the foundation charter continued to be obferved, 
is unknown ; alterations in it were no doubt enjoined by va- 
rious -Commiffions of vifitation iffiied by Parliament; and 
Ariftotle at length refigned his empire to Bacon and New- 
son. But although the profefibrfhip of Greek was fixed in 
1700, it was not until about forty years ago, that the old 
praflice of one profefibr carrying forward the fame clafs for 
three years, and teaching the whole circle of the fciences, was 
relinquiflied. This appears the more extraordinary, when wc 
find that fo early as the reign of King James VI. new foou- 
italion charters, faid to be compofed by Buchanan, were gi-

In the year i755 a new order of teaching wis adopted ill 
this TJniverfity^ by the unanimous approbation of all the 
members ; un account of which was then printed foi* the in- 
formation of the public. Of this arrangement and iyftem of 
education, which has been fuccefsfully profecuted ever fince 
that period, with very little variation) the following is an 
abftrafl t 

The of der formerly obferved in this College ^as that fol-» 
bwed by moft of the ancient philorophers, which was' after-^ 
wards efpoufed by the fcholaftics^ and generally adopted by 
all the Univeriiti^s in Europe* They began with logic, then 
proceeded to ontology, pneuipatology, morals, politicsi and 
laft of all, taught natural philofophy^ The peripatetic philo- 
fophy, at lead as far as it was efpoiifed by the commentators 
atid followers of Ariftotle, was in a great 'meafore. made up 
of verbal fubtleties, "and theories, ill grounded, though inge- 
ntoufly devifed. Thefe were fupported by arguments mould- 
ed into an artificial form, the mechanifm of which muft fird 
be underilood, and it was laid open by the lo^c then in ufe.: 
The chief bufineis of that philofophy was to expfefs opinions 
iu hard and Unintelligible terms ; the ftudent jieeded a dic- 
tionary or nomenclature of the technical words, and author* 
ized diftindlions; experiment W2^ quite negleAed; fcience j

after logic. By. thefe two» the ftud^nt was fafScieatly prepar- 
ed for the verba], or at befti ideal in^ijiries of the other parts* 
But phiiofophy has fioce that tioie been hapj^ily refonned jr 
and is becooie an image, not of homan fancies and concefts 
but of the reality of nature, and truth of tilings. The oidy 
bails of phiiofophy is now. acknowledged to be, an accurate 
and eitenfive hiftory of nattire, exhibiting an c3ca£l view of 
the TariQu&amp; phenomena, for which phiiofophy is to. account, 
and on which it is to found its reaibaongs* This being the 
reformed ilate of phiiofophy, great inconv^iences muft be 
fennd in profecuting the fcholaftsc order of the fciences. The 
ftudent muft make a transition at once from words and lan- 
gnages to pliitlarophy, witkant being jpreyioafly introduced to 
the knowledge of fa£b, the fole feundati^n of, and prepara- 
tion for it ^ he muft be hurried at the firft into the meft ab« 
fbrufe, difficult, and.fubtle parts of it ; he muft be put npoft 
examifung the nature, foundation, and difibrent kinds of evi* 
dence andreafoning, before he is acquainted with, any fpeci- 
mens of thefe kinds, by which they may be illofbated ; and 
in proportion as phiiofophy is more improved and more tho* 
roughly reformed, fuch inconveniences muft become more 
fenfible. For thefe rcafons the profcflbrs of. the Manfchat- 
College were induced to alter the hitherto received order of 
teaching phiiofophy; and after the mofl. mature delifaeratioQ 
they rcfolved. that their ftodents fhould, after being inffarud* 
ed in- languages and cUffical learning, be made acquainted 
jwith the elements of hiflocy, natural and civile of geography, 
and chronology, accompanied witl^ the elements of mathe- 
matics ; that they fhoold then proceed to natural phiiofophy, 
and lafl of. all to morals, politics^ logic, and metaphyfics.

And if by adopting this order they avoid the .inconvenjenccs 
above mentioned, and make the fciences follow one another^ 
according to the natural conne£tiQn of their lubjeds, and the( 
gradual openings of the human mind, may they not expedk 
the approbation of the public, and better fruits of their la* 
boors in forming the minds of youth, to that they may be 
pofieflcd of knowledge more real in itfelf, and more ufcfnl 
for the vanons pturpofirs of human life ? lite order of the 
fciences here eftabHQied, was pretty much obferted by fome 
of the ancieiit ftoics, particularly Panaetins and PoflidoQiuSj' 
and Epi^letus sdfo infinuates that he coniiders it as the pro^ 
per method. Id general, it agrees with the partitions €f 
ictence laid down by Lord Verulam, and perfedUy fuits the 
genius of his pfailofbphy. It sTppears to be that in which tlie 
{cieoces will afford moil light to one another, and in which 
ti^iey wiU hav^ the moft happy influence on life. 

I. The firft year therefore is employed in elaffical learning 
tinder the pFpfef&amp;r of Greek, whofe bufkiefs it is, not onjy 
t» teach that elegant language in which the fciences were 
firft delivered, and which by retaining their origitial terms, 
and from beiag uied by thofe great maftets, whofe works are 
ftill the acknowledged ftandard^ in them, muft always be re* 
gabled as the foundation of learning, but to open the minds 
of youth, by explaining antiquity, by acquainting them wirh 
the lives and charaAers of the chief claffic authors, and by 
pointing out the ufes and advantages of literature for the va^^ 
vbus purpofes of human life. As it is well known that the 
Greek language is little (aught at our grammar fch6ols in this 
country, and that an accurate knowlege of the elementary 
parts* is of the greatefl: importance, the firft part of the feffion 
is neceilarily employed in teaching the grammar. The ftu-'. 
dents then begin to read fome of the eafier parts of the Tef« 
tamentj Lucian's Dialogues^ jETop's Fables/ and towards the

end, are introduced to Homer and fome of the other ports: 
Along \i^Ith their reading, they are fometimes excrcifed in 
making tranflations of eafj paflages from the Greek, into 
Latin and Englifh, in which the idioms of the feveral lan- 
guages are compared and pointed out, and the fcholar there- 
by acquires a more familiar acquaintance with the ftruAure 
and peculiarities of each. 

2* ThC'fubjefbs to which the attention of the fludents i$ 
principally dire£l:ed in the next clais, are hiftory, civil and 
natural, along with Latin literature. The ftudy of natural 
and civil hiflory is judged to be a juil intermediate ftep be- 
tween the ftudy of languages, and general reafonings concern- 
ing things. Hiftory conveys to a young mind inftru&amp;ions 
adapted to its faculties, which at the fame time open and pre- 
pare it gradually for apprehending the conclufions of philofiH 
phy, that branch of fcience which can only be improved in 
proportion as hiftory is perfected. Our knowledge in the 
one and the other muft keep pace, for hiftory relates the 
phenomena, and philofophy explains and accounts ibr them. 
The ftudy of hiftory therefore, particularly natural hiftory» 
muft be proper to precede that of philofophy, not only as it 
opens the mind, but alfo as it furniOies it with the requifite 
materials. As there are not feparate appointments for thefe 
branches of education, the fame profeflbr leAures on hiftory^ 
and illttftrates the claffics at difierent houi^ Imprefted with 
a fenfe of the great importance of claffical learning, he em- 
ploys fix meetings a week in iliuftrating the Latin clafficsi 
The ftudents alfo continue to read Greek in the fecond dafs 
occafionally during the feffion. i. In the claffical department, 
the profeflbr begins with a brief courfe of leAures and iliiif^ 
trations on ancient and modern veriification, and points out 
thofe circumftances which diftinguiftx the ancient verfe firom 
the modem. Ofthefe difcourfes the fiudeiUs receive a print-

ed Latin abridgement. While reading the Latin poets, the 
ftudents are not only exercifed in Tcanning, but alfo accus- 
tomed to read according to. the quantity ; a praftice which 
is attended witli the beft confequences ; and if begun early, 
would wonderfully facilitate the compoHtion of Latin vcrfe. 
The Latin authors read in the fecond clafs are VirgiU Ho- 
race, Juvenal, Cicero, and occaiionally, Tacitus. 2. As an 
introdu^on to civil hiftory, a view is given of chronology 
and geography. Particular attention is paid to the revolu- 
tions of Greece and Rome, the Greek and Roman antiqui- 
ties, and the progrefs of literature, philofophy, and the fine 
arts among the ancients. 3. Natural hiftory conies nett in 
order. This fubje^l is comprehended under fix heads : viz. 
meteorology, hydrology, geology, mincralpgy, vegetation, zoo-^ 
logy ; the laft whereof is introduced by a brief view of com- 
parative anatomy and phyfiology : the (Indents receive a fyU 
labus of the whole. At the fame time, the ftudents in this 
clafs attend the profeflbr of mathematics, for the elementary 
parts, as the knowledge of tlie mathematical riionct: !; an 
abfolutely ncceiTary key to the philofophy of bodies. 

3. J^s material objefts are the moft familiar to young 
minds, and experiments and realbnings concerning them are 
moft level to their capacities, the irudcnts in the third year 
of their courfe, enter on the ftudy of natural aiid experimen- 
tal philofophy, and are inftrufteJ in its fjveral branches; viz. 
mechanics^ hydroftatics, pneumatics, optics, aftronomy, mag- 
netifm, eleftricity, and any others which new difcoveries have 
^dded to the parts already cultivated; At the fame time, 
they continue their application to mathematics, fo as they 
5ttay go hand in hand with their ftudlcs in the different ob- 
j«fts of natural philofopliy. i

the pofition, extent, and folidity of the interfering wall%

Dr George French, profcfibr of chetriiftiy, And, 
Mr James Kidd, profeflbr of oriental langu;^cs. 

Improvanffjf s /ugg^ed,'-''^£ the itniprovemehts ftill wanting 
to render the courfe of education more compiete in this Uni- 
verfity, the public ^ill in fome meafure be enabled it judge 
from the foregoing account of it ; the £[^owifig hOwev^ ait 
briefly fuggefted for their conAdertition. 

The cftablifhment of fhnie new profeilbrfliips is obviooffy 
neceflTary for thb purpofe, particularly one for humanity or 
the Latin language, unleTs fuch an arrangement cdiild be 
adopted, as would enable the prefent pirofcflbrs of tangu^es 
to extend their inj[^£tion$ to -the Other clailes, as wdl as 
thofe immediately under their care,. This appears the more 
necefTary, as it is fufpefted, that the knowledge of Latin is 
rather on the decline, over all this part of the united king- 
dom ; which may be imputed in part, to children beifig fent 
to fchool^and thence to the Univcrfity at too early -an age, 
but chiefly to the prefent fituation of the parochial (chdols. 
Here, the emoluments are fo very inadequate to the decent 
fupport of a public teacher, that they are chiefly occupied by 
boys at college, or others ftill worfc qualified, and in fuck 
circumftances, no one will chufe to remain longer than he 
can find: another employment more advantageous. 

In the medical department there are already two profeflors, 
but to eftablifli any tolerable fchool of phyCc, feveral others 
would be ncceflary. A profeflbr of af^ronpmy Would alfo 
make an ufeful addition to the prefent number, as the vari- 
ous rubjefts taught by the profefibrs' of mathematics and na- 
tural philofophy, leave them but very little leifure for teach- 
ing this agreeable and ufeful fcience. A ready fumifhed ob- 
fervatory alfo affords great encouragement for fuch an cfta- 
l^lifhmcnt, v.'hcre the fame perfon might be fiilly employed 

in

Jn making and recording a regular ferics of obfervations. It 
"would likcwifc be 6f very great fcrvicc to the courfe of edu- 
cation^ that a feparate profcflorfliip was eftablifhed for the 
ftndy of rhetoric an4 the belles lettres ; and in the theologi- 
cal department, another for ecclefiaftical hiftory. 

An addition to the buildings of the College would alfo be 
'very ufsrful, -ttie prefcnt confifting of too few apartments, 
and being otherwife incommodious. For this purpofe the 
(ftinds of the College are 'totally inadequate, being fcarcely 
fufficieiit to anfwer the expence of neceflary repairs. The 
annual flim permitted to be appropriated to the ufe of the li- 
"braryis Tcry fmall, and now that the price of books is fo 
xnuch increafcd, will by no means admit of the purchafe of 
many valuable modern works. Nor has the Marifchal Col- 
lege even the full benefit arifing from the books entered in 
Stationers* hall, as only one copy being fcnt to Aberdeen, the 
right of keeping them has been adjudged to the fcnior Uni- 
vcrfity, though they are declared to be the joint property of 
both. For the chemical clafs likewife, there being no pub- 
lic fund for fupplying utenfils and inftniments, an apparatus 
IS wanted, more complete and on a larger fcale than the one 
prefcntly in ufe, furniihed at the private expence of the pro- 
feffor. 

Another improvement, which has been frequently propof- 
cd, but from prejudice, the refult of ancient cuftom, never 
carried into eflfeft, is the prolongation of the feflion of Col- 
lege. At prefcnt it continues only for five months, which, 
befides being attended with other inconveniences, obliges the 
profefibrs to meet with the ftudents no fewer than three 
times a day, and to conduft and conclude their courfes more 
rapidly tjian would be neceflary in a longer feflion. This, 
with almoft any other deviation from former praftice, can 
only be made by the mutual confent of both Univerfities, 

S 2 which

which, from various circumftances, is not always to be czpefb- 
ed. In this cafe too, fuch an alteration might be unfavoora- 
bly received even by the public, who have been long accuf* 
tomed to the prefent period ; efpecially from its occafioning 
lefs expence to the parents, and being. better fuitqd to the 
low ftate of many of the burfaries. 

The beft and mofl: natural remedy for thefe, or other iio- 
pcrfeftions in the prefent ftate of both Univerfitics, would 
perhaps be found, in bringing about that union of them, 
which has been fo frequently attempted, . By fuch means, 
every deficiency in the number of, profeflbrfhips might ht 
amply fupplied, and a complete feminary of education in ev^ 
ry ufeful fcience, at once eftablifhed, for the benefit of all 
the northern parts of Scotland. The united number of ftu- 
dents would by no means exceed thofe in various other Cot- 
leges, while the very low rate of board and lodging, would 
enable many young men to profecute the ftudy of law or 
medicine, who cannot iifford the expence to be incurred^ bjT 
attending feme of our other XJniverfities.
